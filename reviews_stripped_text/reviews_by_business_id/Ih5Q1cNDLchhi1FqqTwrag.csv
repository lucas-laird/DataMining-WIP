The seared scallops were cooked to perfection. The Malai chicken tikka was unbelievable, sauces were perfect, chicken was so tender and moist.

Thank god they don't throw everything in a muddled cream sauce and call it curry. I hope they stay this way and don't turn it into a buffet only place like many other Indian restaurants have done.
The only critique I have and might stop me from going is the chairs they use upstairs for bigger group tables. There are high bar stools and tables that looked comfy but the bigger group tables and chairs are extremely uncomfortable. The height ratio of the chairs to tables is really odd. I hope management switches those out.

I found the the best Indian restaurant in Vegas that not only offers very creative fusion Indian but also some very authentic finger licking traditional Indian food. 
We started with their summer Fresca salad - beautiful blend of watermelon and feta with spicy quinoa. I have never tasted quinoa this good! This was followed by a very famous Indian street food called Pani puri shots (highly recommend!!) also had their grilled eggplant with peanut sesame crust and Masala shrimp served on crisp filo. So yummmy!! For mains we had the signature chicken tikka masala (authentic Indian food at its best) vegetable dum biryani, garlic and plain naan and masala dosa which was served with 3 types of chutneys and authentic Tamil sambhar. It was delish. We were so full but decided to try some dessert.. we had the dessert trio which had gajar halwa (warm carrot pudding) mango kulfi and gulab jamun. Also tried their Apple cinnamon crumble. Everything was just perfect! Our server Ronald was the best, gave us some great food recommendations, very efficient and friendly.

But after we entered and went to the bottom floor bar/restaurant area the music was much more mild and the ambiance was a lot more relaxed. 

Decor is simple and modern and there is a beautiful open window area for people watching. Container park is across the street so you might just get to see the praying mantis dragon spew some fire!

Next up? The eggplant appetizer. It had a significant kick to it, that I was not at all expecting. That was fun. 

For the main we decided to split the tandoori platter: salmon, shrimp, chicken and lamb. With a side of naan. 

Here's where disappointment settles in. The shrimp were severely over cooked. The chicken breast was dry. The lamb popsicle was only, meh. We've had better. The salmon was also over cooked. The salad was okay. The delicious thing on the plate was the minced lamb, but it was slightly dry as well.

We walked in for lunch on a Monday when they had just opened their doors so the restaurant was empty but the aroma of spices literally dragged us inside!!! 

The servers were amazing! Very polite, welcoming and quick! The restaurant is clean, smells nice and is well lit. 

We ordered the aloo tikki chaat for appetizer. The portion size was good and can be easily shared between 2! The chutneys were nice and spicy as we wanted them to be and tasted really authentic. 

For the main course, we ordered dal makhni (served with 1/2 naan, and a cup of rice), butter chicken and butter naan. 
The naans were nice and soft and well buttered. 
The dal was awesome with great amount of spices used. 
The butter chicken was very authentic in appearance and in taste.

3969896,2016-10-24,13,Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag,"This restaurant has been a long time in coming so the owners had plenty of time to decide on their business plan.  The latest of a trio of Indian restaurants, I think this one has an identity crisis.  Is it more of a bar in the Fremont East District that just happens to serve Indian food or is it a restaurant that prominently features a bar?

I entered about 10 minutes after it's 5 PM dinner hour opening.  I was shown to a table in the bar area.  Unlike other Indian restaurants, this one had the football game on TV instead of the normal Bollywood music with dancers.  That's OK with me though.  It's up to them.

When I looked at the menu I was surprised by how limited it was.  On the back was a list of traditional curries and to my memory they were all vegetarian options--again OK--but not what I was looking for.  I saw a sign out front that said the soup of the day was lentil soup (see my photo for the exterior shot and you'll see the sign).  When I asked the server about this, she pointed to an $11 lentil soup on the menu.  She then said she could have them make a cup size portion rather than the larger size.  Seeing nothing else I wanted on the menu, I opted for the beef curry and I ordered garlic naan.  I had already been brought the iced tea I asked for when I was first seated.

A server brought me a small Indian cake as an amuse but I couldn't understand his description.  (A Yelp friend let me know that this is dhokla made from chick pea flour.)   It was good with some nice Indian spices in the cake.  Then came the lentil soup.  It was a large bowl but it wasn't that deep which was OK.  However, I didn't see a lentil anywhere and I'd refer to it as lentil broth rather than lentil soup.  There was not even a texture of ground lentils in the bowl.  (Check my photo against the lentil soup photo someone else has posted and note the difference.)  

The beef curry came.  I had ordered it at spice level 4 out of 5.  If you like spicy food, order the 5 because this could have had more zing to it.  The curry was OK but nothing exceptional.  A serving of basmati rice came with the curry.  The naan was OK but needed more garlic.  My iced tea was refreshed without asking.

They have recently opened but there are a couple of things to note.  The lunch menu appears to have more of what I'd want than the dinner one.  When I asked my server if they had two menus, one for the bar area and one for the dining room area, she said no and brought me their lunch and their dinner menus.  Lunch has lamb rogan josh--something I would have ordered instead of the beef.  When I  pointed this out, she showed me the lamb rack that's on their dinner menu and said that could be made into rogan josh--just ask.  Really?  If I want curry chicken I have to guess that you'll make it for me.

As for the surroundings, this is where the Fremont East District comes into play.  There is a counter running along the windows of this corner restaurant with stools so people can sit at the counter and watch the people at the Container Park or just coming and going on Fremont Street.  Yesterday, all three garage door style windows were open.  One was shut when the west breezes were strong and almost blew the menu off the table.  The windows facing the Container Park remained open all the time I was there.  

I saw last December that this restaurant was coming in 2016.  It finally made it and I was glad to give it a try when I knew they were open.  My experience tells me that it's the one and only time I'll be there.  We have just too many better choices for Indian food without having to get beef.  You need to decide what kind of business you want Turmeric to be.  Note:  their website does not yet have a menu listing.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,21,13,2,-TcFjK5bSkbyNwhZ7Lz9Bw

The entrees come with choice of plain, butter or garlic nan. We had the garlic nan and it was delicious--light, crunchy and chewy in all the right places. Service was nice, I appreciated the honesty when I asked about having the chicken tikka appetizer as my lunch, and was advised that the appetizer portions may be smaller than I would want.

4352951,2018-02-21,0,Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag,"Ok I have been thinking a really long time about my feelings on this place.   My first encounter had been through a yelp elite event,  and that experience was 5 star specifically because there were some stand out dishes that were so amazing they conteracted some of the items that were not excuted in the best manner. Two of the items that blew my mind the most were the spinach kofta and the grilled eggplant.   I had been thinking about them everyday for a full week until I finally asked my boyfriend if he would go on a downtown adventure to satiate this need I had. 

When we get to the resturant I thought it would be fun to sit more towards the front this time so we could see the container park.  The last time I had been sequestered in the back where there are no windows to take in the fun that is downtown.   However this was my first mistake because in the front they have this lighting that beams down on you in multiple colors and  was making my eyes hurt and tear up.   When we left my eyes almost breathed a sigh of relief from the strain they had been put under.   The effect of the lighting was also weird because when we got our food it made all the curry's and drinks the same color.  Not very visually appetizing,  and not smart if you want people to take pictures of the food to promote it later. 
It was all this intense shade of orange. 

Now I was willing to put up with all of this because I wanted the magic I had experienced the week prior.   First off, while the eggplant was good,  it was not mind blowing like the prior time.   The first time they seemed to have cooked it longer renduring it with a deeper smokey flavor and more tender mouth feel.   The other sauces that had the tang, sweet,  and spicy qualities were still there and amazing,  and the labneh cooled it down and rounded it out,  but it still just was not the same. 

I still had hope my spinach kofta surely would not disappoint me! Here it comes along with my boyfriends chicken tikka masala.  All looking the same weird color under the light,  and I take a bite and it is different tasting.  The kofta itself is still delicate and full of texture and wonder, but the sauce that was supposed to bring it all together tasted off.   I had my boyfriend try it since I had brought leftovers last time,  and he agreed it tasted different.  I asked the waitress if they changed the sauce.   She checked with the chef and said it was the same and apologized it tasted different.  She said maybe it tasted different since it was not the same chef as the day of the yelp event.  My boyfriends sauce tasted weirdly similar too, and later I realized it was the fact that they both were just overly salted that it took away from all the amazing flavors, and now was just basically one note.   I even felt my tummy a little more aggrivated that night from the food,  which had not happened before.   

Now I will say the waitress was very nice and apologetic, and asked if I wanted something else.  However I was already a bit filled from my appetizer and some of the food I had.   I also was thinking it would all just be the same problem if the chef was just not on point that night.  

I did enjoy my mango lassie, it was unique and had spices you don't normally find in the beverage. It's just for prices like 19 dollars for the kofta, and 17 for the chicken tikka,  in a world of all you can eat 10 and 12 dollar Indian buffets,  you have to be on your A game.  You have to be consistent even when it's not a special event, and you need an environment that is enjoyable to sit in.   For future reference there upstairs outside terrace will be open soon,  however that was not an option yet.   I want to love this place like I did the first time,  I want to be able to give it a better review.  However, all things considered, for now this what I am left with.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,3,2,3,R88lTeV6N3akE4niPpTU3w

Anyway, all of their menus are slightly different and Turmeric is a little more adventurous as its not your traditional Indian fare.

House-cured Salmon ($12) with green pea relish, potato chaat, cress, and puffed rice. Delicious salmon paired with great Indian spices. A light start to your meal.

Aaloo Papdi Chaat ($10): Spiced potato, garbanzo, wheat crisps, cilantro, tamarind, and yogurt chutney. One of their tasty salad options; again, light and a great combination of flavors.

Lamb Rogan Josh ($16): Kashmir-style lamb curry with brown onions, ginger, fennel, and spices; served with basmati rice and roasted vegetables. This is, hands down, one of my favorite Indian dishes! Extremely flavorful! I loved eating it with the rice and naan.

Black Lentil ($8): Slow-cooked black lentils with tomato and fenugreek. Perfectly hearty with great flavor! Great side or even a main dish.

Garlic Naan ($3): I love an affinity for all breads and naan is one of my favorites. Slightly chewy, lightly crispy on the exterior from the tandoor, and garlic, flavorful!

Stuffed Naan ($5): We opted for Paneer (a type of cheese) and again, tasty. I loved using this one to eat the Lamb since the flavor of the naan was mellow.

Berries and Ginger Crumbles ($11): Mixed berry compote and ginger crumble with vanilla ice cream. Very much like a cobbler, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The compote was delicious and I loved the ginger crumbles. Fantastic dessert!

I'm not in DTLV often, however, this is a great option if you're in the area and if you want a little different take on your usual Indian food. Service was wonderful and they have a really cool rooftop bar with views of Fremont Street.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,9,7,4,Gwq3pkwtG_I_cXXAGMQ6xg

My only suggestion is to have more service staff on the weekend. Our waitress had a lot of table to attend too and even though she was very efficient, she seemed a bit overwhelmed. It took a bit of extra time to get her attention. Other than that, this place is a must go!

After 7-8 minutes of nobody even acknowledged us or took a drink order. It's like we weren't even there, so we decided to leave. ( they were about halfway full in back room).

I ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. The food was good I'll have to admit, but I have ate at just about every Indian restaurant in town and it was not as good as some places. And the prices are very high, the place is just way overpriced for what you get. $18 for the masala compared to $13-15 at most places.

It is not a traditional Indian restaurant, it is modern meets Indian. The decor, food and bar reflect that. The food is more appropriately portioned to share a bit and try different things. Not like your traditional huge plates of food that leave you absolutely stuffed, although if you want to, you can always ask for more ""gravy and rice"". You can eat nicely here and still feel like you can grab cocktails after. Speaking of cocktails, they have a decent bar with a good selection of specialty cocktails, beer and wine.

The service was very good and the chef came out to greet us after our meal. You can tell he really cares that he creates something unique and enjoyable.
