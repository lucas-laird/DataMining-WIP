Expecially Lisa she always greets us with the most genuine smile, she makes sure everything is exactly how we want it and always makes us feel so welcome everytime.

584661,2017-06-06,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,"The app doesn't work. There is food on the app that is not present at the restaurant. When we got to the restaurant to pick up our food, they had accidentally deleted the order. I re-ordered, and ended up being charged twice. The store refused to give me a refund for the second order saying they didn't know how.

Addendum: I called the store the following Monday, the manager, Nick, told me that he was busy with training, and will call me back in a couple minutes. He never did. I called back in the late afternoon, and told him that I needed a refund for the food I never received. He told me that there was nothing he could do. He seemed to be totally apathetic. He said that somebody else would call me back, but never did.

I called the corporate office in Reno, they were helpful. They  were  pleasant and apologetic, and refunded my money.",DDlGkjQuxoGl_eVn3Kd7Ig,0,0,3,3X5gaZh1CL69pTVpIufWGw

I bought the #9 pastrami and provologne but after the pastrami she put turkey instead of provologne. Meh not a big deal so I dont say nothing. Then I asked for mustard and the guy put mayo too but its fine i dont really mind mayo. Then when he passed it too the checker he said it was a #13 and thats what they rang up. Doesnt matter im sure its around same price. Overall it was good experience. Pastrami and turkeys pretty good together. They should just relax more no need to go so fast.

1417964,2017-07-25,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,"I spent $14 for a large sandwich, small macaroni salad, and a cookie. So expensive and no drink. 
The smell when you walk in is devine-fresh baking bread. Then you eat it and it's tough and dry. The lettuce looked old. 
The salad came in a large container but was only filled less than halfway. 
It took over 15 minutes to get my order and there were only 2 people in front of me.

1898344,2017-10-03,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,"I came in today around noon for lunch. The guy behind the line (homely looking dude with a beard) pulled his pants up 3 times (while taking 10 minutes) making my salad. Once before touching the spinach and once while scooping the cheese. This is unacceptable and way to long to wait for a salad.

Can your employees not afford belts, or are they two disgusting to wear them? Are they not trained to change gloves after touching non foods items?",VhFpC73FTGBCGW6SPg2RrQ,0,0,1,wql9jEO4TbWfp_qkubA7Jg
1994346,2018-01-04,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,This is the worst port of subs I have ever been to. I have tried to go to this port of subs many of times only to discover that they have closed early.  If you are lucky to catch them 20 minutes before they were suppose to close they won't offer the full menu either. I was told that I could only have a turkey or ham sandwhich on white bread because they put everything else away. On top of that I waited out front for 5 minutes for them to even come out and greet me because they were too busy in the back trying to close the building down. I will never give this place my business again. This location gives port of subs a bad reputation.,ehp3PE0HXtHTYYg-RAdocQ,0,0,1,nYBVqRHjnIJR7oUX6HcIbA

4264956,2013-05-14,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,"For some reason, this place just doesn't pack the same goony goodness that the location on Charleston does. It's all the same ingredients, same decor, same EVERYTHING-- I just don't get it?

The staff is real nice, we went in today and it was one of those days where we came at the right time bc as soon as we sat down after we ordered, everyone in the neighborhood seemed to be hungry at the same time and the line wrapped around the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff seems to get quite overwhelmed with the lunch rush, doesn't seem like they're very used to it by the looks on their faces and the frantic-ness felt around that time. It was to the point to where they ran out of 2 different sodas and they couldn't send someone to go to the back and take 2 seconds to change out the syrups. 

Like I said, for some reason even though this restaurant has the same everything, seems like the location on Charleston has some secret ingredient that they're not sharing with this location.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,0,3,tSMs6tIQREFxYEaLagU3mg

5821696,2009-02-04,0,fHNWz_t5jM5MP8o19flX8w,I finally tried this place and I wasn't disappointed. I had a Chipotle Chicken Sandwich (which I think was a special item on the menu) and Broccoli Cheese Soup. I love how this place slices their meats and cheeses right when you order. It makes this place stand out from any other chain sandwich place. The ingredients here taste fresher. The soup had good sizes of broccoli and it wasn't salty. It was perfect. No need to add anything. The soup was self served and I got a refill but I'm not sure if you're not supposed to. No one stopped me. My meal was SOOOOOOOOO YUMMY!!! I definitely will be back.,xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,2,4,uHZfpic_hS93s1txKXB8bg

Out of bacon?  How does that happen.  So I quick pick-up for an online order turned into a live re-order and kind of defeated the whole  point.
