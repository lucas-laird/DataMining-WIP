The space in Kaizen is very nice, with bamboo, nicely stained wood communal tables, and just the right amount of light to create a very chilled out ambience.  Even though the space is quite nice, there are a few major issues with the experience as a whole.  

We sat at the bar around 11:00 on a Saturday night, along with 5 or 6 other people in the restaurant.  It was not very busy, and the other diners were enjoying their food when we ordered.  Like other reviews have stated, the chefs take a long time to prepare your sushi here.  When it did arrive, I was fairly disappointed.   

The prices I list are ballpark, as I can't recall exactly what they were.  We decided on the following:

A trio salad plate (I can't recall the name) - This appetizer included a seaweed salad, octopus salad, and tuna poke.  The octopus was quite good, being flavorful and tender but the poke and the seaweed left much to be desired, both in texture and flavor.  ($8.95)

Tuna Sashimi w/ garlic ponzu - Awkward cuts of tuna drowning in a sauce that just didn't taste quite right.  The presentation was nothing special, and the flavors were forgettable.  ($13.95)  

Tuna, whitefish wrapped in Cucumber, no rice  (again the name eludes me) -  Six pieces a little too big to eat in one bite arrived on the plate.  This wasn't too bad, but for $13.95 you must have something exceptional in that roll, and exceptional was no where close.  


I don't understand the prices for this place, they are way too high for the product.  You can pay these prices at a few other sushi restaurants in town and get a much better meal.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,0,0,2,2DIuip1Rq764sK3C2D1Mrw

Most of the tempura rolls were actually regular rolls made w/ tempura something or other rather than an entire rolss fried, which I really liked bc what is the point of sushi if it's totally unhealthy anyway right? My personal fav was the green chili roll but my gf lked the holy cow the best. I felt everything could have been just a little more well executed, many of the rolls were starting to fall apart when they arrived at our table, & I was also disappointed at how many of the rolls were smaller than 8 pieces. Even during happy hour it was nearly $50 for 5 rolls which isnt BAD but, w/ ayce sushi on every few blocks around here I think they should really step it up. Next time I will definitely be looking more into their extensive app selection.",hH3B1_kB4RPwJllDuiy06w,2,2,3,_UdMtRDKyWQlenPQYPkssw

First thing I noticed was the huge variety on the menu. Great selection of sake plus just about every different type of roll you could possibly want. We ordered a bunch of different rolls for the group and stuffed ourselves silly.

Favorite dish - the ahi tuna appetizer on wonton crackers. Had a baked salmon roll which was also delicious. Will be going back for sure!",rjoUmuNmlsSjRKQasn6kMg,1,0,5,cs7EVslBBidF2Q62Z3jlgw

1897718,2011-02-15,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"YAY SUSHI! I've been to the location on Paradise a number of times, but I had yet to visit this one (even though it's closer to home.) I placed an order for pick-up, which was waiting on a nearby table when I arrived. 

The inside of the restaurant looks exactly like the Paradise location, but about two or three times bigger. All of the food is excellent. I've brought people who have eaten sushi in Japan and people who have never tried sushi and so far, everyone has enjoyed the food at Kaizen. My BFF's fiance swore he hated sushi until he agreed to try a chicken teriyaki roll. Now he's hooked. That's what Kaizen does to people.

Although there aren't a ton of vegetarian rolls, the few they have are excellent. They offer a vegetable tempura roll and a shiitake mushroom tempura roll that are just to die for. 

The best part is definitely the dessert menu. They have green tea and red bean ice cream and FIVE types of mochi ice cream! 

Overall, great restaurant. I really like the variety on the menu, and the service is always good. Plus, it's open super late (like, 3 a.m.)",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,1,1,5,alC815yxS0k13nsU1T5Y1A

2320167,2012-08-21,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"I came here for the all you can eat lunch for $22, and I was not disappointed.  There are three whole menu pages of all you can eat menu items, including steaks that are usually $20 or more.  My wife and I both did the all you can eat option, and we shared six rolls and three appetizers between us.  All of the rolls were great, but sometimes a little heavy on the sauce they were plated with.  The only disappointment was the ""yummy yummy crispy tuna"" appetizer, which consists of large chunks of ahi tuna served on fried wonton wrappers.  The tuna was tough to chew, and had lots of connective tissue/fat that I could not eat.  Other than that, the rest of the fish was very good.  The service was also great, and our waitress was very professional, but there were only two couples in the whole restaurant at the time.  The sushi roll prep could have been a little faster, especially considering that there were only two groups ordering food in the whole restaurant, but they might bring on additional chefs for busy times.

Overall, a great restaurant, and I will be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",V28MqLYwagJz62YfyPi3qg,2,0,4,kdEeyn2-FGV80lLomW-Gxw

When you walk in you almost feel like you walked into the one on Paradise, but feels slightly larger.  Food was fantastic, service was great as well.  Definitely no complaints.  We ordered the Rose Roll, Hamachi Kama, and a whole bunch of other stuff that I can't remember, but all the food was delicious.  My friend doesn't really go beyond California rolls unless someone else orders it, he loved the jalapeno popper things I order.  Those were my favorite along with the Rose Roll.

2716880,2013-01-06,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"Love you Kaizen! (Or Umaya ? or whatever you're called now).

This place has changed their name so many time I don't know what they're called anymore so I just call them Kaizen still. Whatever. They could rename their restaurant to Crap Sushi and I'd still come here.

I don't do sea food, which is hard when your friends all want sushi. Kaizen makes it easy for me. Katsu chicken? Sure thing, and it's delicious. And if you're in the mood for a bit of sushi that is fishless, the BBQ ribs roll is AWESOME. 

Sushi loving friends put this at the top of their lists - AYCE is fairly reasonable, especially for being so close to the Strip, and the service is quick and super nice. As someone who goes through a couple diet cokes per meal, they even refill quickly (thanks for that!).",PcqqldYB1hi0Mb6cwb2caA,0,0,4,s3hris5TBNxQx_B9UHen2A
2738848,2012-07-01,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"We came here last Saturday and it was the worst service ever. First let's start by pricing on the AYCE. It was 26 dollar and it wasn't even the whole menu like other sushi restaurants. It was a specific menu that doesn't even have half the specials rolls the restaurant menu has so its very limited to the rolls that probably didn't have that many ingredient. Next, there was only one server that is taking plates out to the all tables other than the bar. The next thing that I ran into was this place didn't offer half rolls. He mentioned that most rolls were going to be 6-8 pieces but half were rolls we're not allowed. I ordered ribeye and it came out cold. What also can't out cold was the baked mussel. Not only was it cold my fresh oyster only came two per plate when it was really suppose to be 3 per plate. The food took forever to come out and hen it finally did come to our table all the other plates were empty. That's how long it took. I would never come back here especially for what I paid.",Os_wlycAH5O2zQIkjJGOag,0,0,1,qVd7qT5fK2YtQ02ILQxvnA
3136085,2011-01-20,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"So I was staying at the palms place for work again. I have eaten at almost all the places in the palms and so I thought I would venture out. So I walked across the street and made my way into Kaizen. 

The place was pretty empty but it was a Wednesday at about 6PM so I understand why. The place is pretty nice inside with a neat urban but Japanese feel. Sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef was sooo nice. So there are so many things on the menu that it is hard to choose. All the rolls kind of scared me because I was wondering what the quality of their fish really was due to so many rolls and not so much sushi. 

Ordered sushi of Spanish mackerel and it was very tasty so I thought lets try the sushi. I ordered the Chirashi which is a traditional bowl of sashimi. It was AWESOME!!! I had three pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, squid. Two pieces of Delicious halibut, Spanish mackerel, shrimp, crab and the kicker yellow tail belly. Topped off with a Japanese mushroom, rice, seaweed and salmon eggs. It was soo good. If you order the Cherish you have to be willing to eat what you get. This bowl is for a true sushi lover. Also it is an awesome deal at only $19.95. Tip: let the sushi chefs make it their way. Don't ask for any substitute. 

Overall a great dining experience. I was by myself and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. 

I hope to be able to come here again.

Their very generous with the food portion. We ordered the tiger eye roll Which was my favorite roll out of the 6 rolls we ordered it was deep fried calamari rolled with crab, avocado & cucumber. Also try the Energy Roll!!!! in it there were fresh water eel, yellowtail, yama gobo, green onion & smelt egg. all the rolls were really good and we were stuff after leaving. i wanted to try their fried green tea ice cream but i was way tooo full to order it.",h3lKJCoo0Oi6KkTgMdpanw,1,1,4,RXG_mw1QBl9aaTODPbTuzw

Pieces of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, a stick of cucumber all wrapped in seaweed and squid(!) with an outer breading. The roll didn't have rice, so you'll be good if avoiding carbs...

Also had the chicken katsu bowl, which was nice and crispy.

Seaweed salad was very good though it couldve used some sesame oil on it. A ""side"" portion was large enough for us to split as an appetizer.  My daughter ordered the standard California roll - nothing special but the ingredients were fresh. I had the ""twilight"" roll which consisted of fresh water eel, avocado, fried eel, spicy tuna, and a spicy and sweet sauce. Absolutely to die for and very filling since my daughter wouldn't try it. Finished off our lunch with green tea tempura ice cream. Server was attentive but not overbearing. We'll definitely be back",qN3bsY-OnkYNy3zQfpRQsA,1,0,5,NSlny7CDAE8-2SHpNkulDA

They will alternate any rolls for you to fit your diet needs.  They are pretty pricey for, about $10 a roll.  I think the best rolls are the tempura rolls, but you cant go wrong with fried stuff.  Anything baked, yummy too!  The baked salmon roll was to die for!  Eel sauce, glazed over, with baked salmon on top, so tasty!  The service is great, always on top of things, food comes out at a decent time.

5141755,2012-08-15,0,lhxG1Jlp4nMpLMoix31OYg,"Kaizen was my first AYCE sushi visit in town.  I will say on the one hand, if I totaled up all my items as if I ordered ala carte, then I definitely saved money.  Just beware that when they say $26.95, it's really more like $37 after tax and auto added tip.

I liked the spice on a few of my rolls but others came off as just average.  The tuna poke was solid but it was the first time I've had that so I can't say if it was better or worse than other tuna poke.  A friend I was with  said this place had nothing on places in her hometown, which happened to be a fish mecca (Seattle), so it's a tough comparison.
