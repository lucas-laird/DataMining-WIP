149190,2014-12-16,1,6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw,Average - this place has gone down in estimation in my opinion.  It's been at least 5 yrs since Ive been to obe of these joints and I was pretty disappointed with the food. Pick two: pasta & soup. Everything was too salty and portions have gotten much smaller since I can remember :-(  Girls at the counter were very nice though.,bGUs2VtGoIj2ri_5hNSh-g,1,1,3,yAQJV7icfxp-Nej08pKg_A
159109,2014-08-14,3,6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw,"First, the food is amazing!  Everything is great, fresh, well made.  Absolutely no complaints with anything they offer, whether it's pastries, coffee, sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, salads, or soup.  Wish they served Coke products instead of Pepsi, but their ice tea offerings are fantastic so I'm not terribly bothered by this.  My faves: Mac & cheese & Fuji Apple chicken salad.  

Second, my review is based upon their lunch service only and nothing more.  I've been to this particular location several times during the week, during lunch hours 11am - 1pm.  Because my office is a good 20-25 minute drive from The Orleans, I always call my order in for pick up as I'm walking to my car to head their way.

The good news is my order has always been ready & waiting for me upon arrival.  The bad news is by the time I pick it up...my mac & cheese (or whatever hot soup I've ordered) is cold. They have 4 registers but only 2-3 running during lunch service. The line is literally out the door upon arrival. By the time I've waited 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) in line...well, you see where I'm going with this. What should be a quick in/out to pay & leave...is not.  I do not understand why they can't have a dedicated line for persons like myself.  It's very frustrating.  I'm at the point the next time I phone in my order & arrive only to receive cold _______, to give it back & ask for a new, hot, __________.

They are promoting their ""RAPID PICK UP.""  See my photo...it promotes avoiding the line by ordering online.  The only way this works is if they have a dedicated register to handle these orders.  Otherwise, what's the point?  At minimum it's false advertising; at best it allows customers, whose office is not near, the option of takeaway...rapid it most certainly will not be.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,5,4,3,gqQpTE9YT7pKp8yv3OojHQ

I love their seasonal Strawberry Poppyseed and Chicken salad [All-natural, antibiotic-free chicken, romaine, fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, fresh pineapple, Mandarin oranges, pecans & fat-free poppyseed dressing] - the dressing is sweet but not overpowering.

For lunch their You Pick 2 is always great because you get your choice of 1/2 a salad, cup of soup, or 1/2 sandwich - which is great portion sizing for lunch.

Panera Bread is a great place for the most important meal of the day~(breakfast!) and lunch!
Friendly service, and a fair amount of items on the menu to choose from. You can do combos or just pick one thing to your fancy. Bread, soups, pasta, sandwiches, and panini's, all cozy wholesome foods. 
I ordered the cuban chicken panini with baked chips on the side, my friend ordered soup in a bread bowl with a side of apples. Both were decently sized and tasty!
This place gets very busy on the weekend, lots of families come here after their games for lunch. Lot's of seating available, booths and tables, and some couches too. So its a good place to hang out with friends and even study.
It would be nice if the seating area could be maintained better though. Having to sit on  breadcrumbs and on the table wasn't that great, but its a small fault.

If that wasn't enough we waited 15 minutes to get the wrong  order and had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the re-make.  The quality and consistency wasn't there.  Also,  there was no management roaming around at all to greet us or listen to our displeasure.  We spent $48.00 for HORRIBLE food.

  The staff...I am not exaggerating when I say I have rarely been in here and not encountered at least one employee who seems uninterested and/or miserable.   I often will stand at the front ordering counter for long periods even after people, who I see working the front counter later,  clearly see me, making eye contact but do not even address me.  The only thing that,  in my opinion,  could lend to such widespread unhappiness and sometimes poor service and attitude is bad management, since it seems almost every employee does not seem happy to be there at all.

1162068,2010-08-18,0,6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw,"I guess the irony would be that I've never actually ordered  from the bakery menu here, because of course Panera specializes in Artisan breads and speciality breads, and all kinds of baked goods from bagels to pastries, cookies, cakes and muffins.  

They also serve sandwiches, soups, and salads, and while I've heard the sandwiches and hot paninis are good, all I've ever ordered, in my health-oriented way, have been the salads -- which means that I actually have enjoyed their bread, because a slice of freshly baked french bread comes with every salad, and it is very good.

But the salads are what I really know and love about Panera.  I've had the Fuji Apple Chicken, the Asian Sesame Chicken, the Grilled Chicken Caesar, and most recently the Strawberry Poppyseed Chicken.  All of these are excellent, but my new favorite is definitely the Strawberry Poppyseed Chicken.  

Aside from the wonderful taste of their salads, the great thing about them is that they use all natural, antibiotic-free chicken.  That is a major plus!

The price of their salads does seem a little high to me, but there's a remedy for that.  I always go with a friend who enjoys their salad as much as I do.  We order one salad and tell the cashier we're going to split it.  They bring it to our table in two bowls -- with a slice of french bread for each of us.  That's a good deal, because half an order is plenty for light, satisfying meal.

Negatives: Didn't LOVE this location (Experienced way better locations), particular location was too busy, dirty, no effort in food preparation. 

I find the Panera Bead Chain to be AWESOME. Great place to casually meet up with friends for a light lunch. Great place to meet up with someone you just met. Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience with this location. The lady who brought me my lunch also was sweeping the floors. Dishes were stacked high at the trash cans. Lines to order were 7 people deep, food took a while to get to me considering I only ordered a half a sandwich and some soup. Crazy how busy this location was for a Tuesday afternoon.

Price/Food: $10-15 Lunch. Food is always really light and refreshing at Panera Bread. Its basic safe ground for your picky eaters. In my opinion the food is a little bit pricey for the quantity, type of food, and preparation effort you are getting. I paid $12 for a half a sandwich, a bowl of french onion soup, and a soda. Was not so impressed with this particular location. Spoon was not very clean and had water spots, sandwich was very tiny and falling apart (3 big bites for a guy), and soup was just warm. I asked for the soup croutons on the side and they gave me about 4 croutons in a soup container. They didn't even bother to cut my bread in half. They just ripped a chunk off the loaf. I do however like how Panera Bread uses real cuts of turkey, and not the thin sliced pressed stuff.

Service/Ambiance: I like how the cashiers are separate from food preparation area. As busy as this location was, the cashier took the time to answer my questions and offer and explain to me about their rewards card. The customer service was spot on and everyone was friendly, but the food took forever to come out. This location cannot keep up with the amount of people that are coming through. Tables were dirty, floors had trash, trash cans were over flowing. Parking lot was packed. But on a positive note; there is a burger place next door, and a Panda express next door to that, with tables all outside, for those times when each person is in the mood for something different.",zYyo7vPdtmzLdBDqS89jAA,2,2,2,xqmjndOJQ-6i4eWrcSqLYQ

I've tried various combos between their pastas, soup, salad & sandwiches. My favorite is as simple as it gets: Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Tomato Soup, Green Tea & Chocolate Pastry. You have a choice if you'd like chips or a side of bread with your combo too. 

The price isn't the best and meals are hit-or-miss but it hasn't stopped me from coming here. Soup is always piping hot, sandwich is toasted, drink is delicious. When I've slurped my Green Tea to the last drop, I refill with their Acai Berry Tea, which is equally delicious as well.

I noticed the chips were missing. Not a problem, it happens. Walked back and was given back the chips with an apology. 

By the time I get home I noticed the bag was wet and dripping. The soup cap wasn't secured all the way and soup spilled all over the carpet in my car. And to top it all off, of course I was given the wrong soup. Wish I would of checked more thoroughly the first time to see if my order was right. I didn't check the soup because it was in the bottom of the bag under the sandwiches. I just assumed it was right. 

So furiously, I drive all the way back and ask for the manager. I give him my receipt to prove my order was wrong and asked to replace the soup and be compensated. He had a dirty look on his face and didn't even sincerely apologize about the whole situation.

He was acting as if I'm one of those free loaders who complains all the time and tries to score free food. I'm not that kind of person, it takes A LOT for me to get upset and complain to a manager.  I was given my money back with a new soup, but honestly I could care less about the money. I just want to pay for excellent customer service and good food and that be the end of it. 

All in all, terrible customer service today. Not sure if I'll never come back because my previous visits were smooth. I guess it's just a hit or miss coming to this location.",AdU2cLrnacy_7pc8nMcfMQ,1,0,2,lR2K3k4QxTXqNs749ciecw

The general manager Luke strikes up conversation with me every morning, asks how things are going with me, and is genuinely interested in me as a person. The same goes for Ashley, a bubbly ray of sunshine even at 630AM. Maddy, Natalie, and Bianca who work the front register are all phenomenal as well. The assistant/catering managers are all wonderful. I've only had a handful of not-so-good experiences, but that is to be expected.

I will say that the morning crew is leaps and bounds better than the afternoon crew.

Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich

+tasty 
-menu said it used roasted bell peppers when i read that i assumed strips of roasted red bell pepper it's more like chopped up cubes of bell pepper didn't provide much flavor
-wasn't a lot of feta cheese
- a dust of garlic powder would have improved flavor a bit but that's cause i dust all my sandwiches with it

Cream of Tomato Soup
+ very very nice with the sandwich
+ sweet and tangy
- some unknown flavor i couldn't identify

Overall
Be careful what you buy here, if you're drawn by their advertisements of fat free or low calorie or what ever order something you know is low in fat and this defeats the purpose but ask them to not grill or press the sandwich they lube with oil and that's fat.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,4,MUgQBkEYKJs2ykjY1ltPxw

I got the pick 2 special and chose the 1/2 Napa almond chicken salad sandwich and broccoli cheese soup.  The chicken salad was ahhh-mazing, not at all dry and packed full of almonds and grapes. That equals a ton of yummy in my tummy.  I even commented on how the lettuce even had a taste...like the lettuce that I grew on my mini farm in Tennessee.  

The broccoli soup was delish! Good amount of bright green broccoli and a nice creamy soup that had the perfect amount of cheese so it wasn't so overwhelming. The guy was lucky enough that I let him snag a few bites and he must have loved it cause I was getting puppy dog eyes the rest of the meal. He perked up when we split the chocolate pastry.

The cashier was very patient with me while I took my time to order. I ordered a full sandwich w/ French bread-like bread on the side, a cup of soup w/ apple on the side and a regular drink. The side came with each item I ordered.  I thought it was like a fast food type of environment but they handed me a number so I sat down. The cashier recommended that I get a REWARDS card with Panera so I can start receiving deals. I didn't hesitate because I enjoy collecting reward cards from different stores I go to. The server brought my food to the table. I started off by dipping my bread into my cup of soup. The bread was very fresh and soft that it practically melted in my mouth. It was that GOOOOD! I was full by the time I was done with half my sandwich, cup of soup and the bread on the side. Next time I'll know to order a half a sandwich, soup and bread on the side. NOW while I was waiting for my food to be served, I went on my phone and registered my rewards card. At the end, it indicated that I can claim my FREE cookies or pastry. I waited until I was done eating before I went back to the cash register. When I showed my card, the cashier swiped it and she said that I can pick anything from the cookie/pastry area. I chose a Cinnamon Roll. This Cinnamon Roll was huge. It was like approx. 5-6 inches. If I were to just buy the Cinnamon Roll by itself, it would cost over $3.00 each. Man, don't get me started on the Cinnamon Roll!!! My goodness!!!!! I think I just found myself a new sandwich shop to go to thanks to my boyfriend who introduced me to this place.

In my opinion, this location stands out as the cleanest and most consistently delicious with the most friendly staff! The staff are always smiling and eager to take your order, speaking to you like you're an old friend! 

I stopped in here this morning to grab a quick bagel and coffee before work. I rarely eat bagels, but have been craving one for weeks. I ordered Asiago Cheese, toasted, with cream cheese and a large coffee. Coffee is self serve (unless you order a latte) and I really enjoy their Hazelnut brew! I also ordered a pumpkin spice latte for my girlfriend. 

Bagels were ready in just a few minutes and always taste fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the cream cheese comes in a small container and you have to put it on your bagel yourself. This is a bit inconvenient for me as I prefer the grab and go style quickie breakfast. 

When I drop in for a quick lunch/dinner, I always go for the ""you pick two"" option because I can never decide between soup or sandwich/panini. I don't think I've ever not enjoyed a sandwich from here. Everything is always made fresh with quality ingredients (meats, cheese, veggies). Also, you CANNOT go wrong w/ the broccoli cheese soup - yummy!!!!

First, they were out of Broccoli Soup at 12:45 in the afternoon. I would have understood had it been later in the day sure, but you are in the middle of the lunch rush and you run out of a key item. Second was I ordered a Tomato and Mozzarella Panini and it was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. The sandwich had 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese, 4 slices of tomato and and a pathetic amount of sun dried tomatoes. Third, the Turkey & Bacon Sandwich had no flavor what so ever.

Being more health conscious these days, it is not just about where you eat, but WHAT you eat.  I find that Panera bread has a lot of tasteful selections that still allow you to meat your health/nutritional goals.

What I opted in today for was the ""You Choose two"" menu:

- Half Asian Sesame Chicken Salad (200 cals,10g fat)
- Half Smoked Turkey Breast on Country Sandwich (280 cals, 7g fat)

My third item I got on the side was an apple.

The salad was very good.  Fresh, off-the-grill chicken with: the romaine lettuce, almonds, crispy wonton strips and sesame vinaigrette was very flavorful and did not disappoint.

The Smoked Turkey Sandwich was equally satisfying.  This half sandwich was more like a full one portion-wise.  The sandwich was put together with some good slices of turkey breast, leaf lettuce, tomatoes and red onions with mayonnaise, spicy mustard, salt and pepper.

The experience from walking into the door, ordering our food and having it on our table was a very quick experience and we enjoyed a nice clean atmosphere to eat our lunch.

I was expecting the place to be much more busy, however since we arrived at 1pm for lunch it had all its booths filled up, but not very tables - which is where we sat.

If I'm out and about and needing something to drink it's good to know there's someplace out there offering top notch, gourmet restaurant style iced tea for an affordable price.  At Panera you can get a large cup to go for a couple bucks. They've got mango (my favorite), regular unsweetened, and a tropical hibiscus, if your into that.

When they've got it in stock, there's nothing better around, and they keep the flavor pretty consistent.  I say ""when"" they've got it in stock because sometimes they run out and I don't realize this til after I've paid. I've made a habit out of checking the tea urns to see if their full before ordering.  Most of the time I get lucky though!

I'm not sure I can recommend the food. I haven't tried much.  I had a souffl√© not too long ago, and it made a really decent breakfast for the price. Every time I've visited after, however, they've been sold out of these, so get here early if you're interested. Everything else I've had has just been so-so.

They do an excellent job at making you want every pastry and treat they offer. The display case is set up really nice and it's hard to pass up their sweets, or not order some form of bread selection from the wall.

I had a bagel the other day that had an okay taste, but was hard to chew. I'm not sure if it was way over toasted, or just really old. Either way, I don't think I'll order a bagel anytime soon.

The M&M cookie I tried had a burnt butter taste, and I didn't enjoy their cheese Danish either.

Definitely come here sometime because it's a really nice store and a decent place to hang out with family or co-workers and talk. There's free wifi, which is never a thing to pass up.

The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and I even when I go during the lunch rush there is rarely a long wait. The eating area is kept clean, the only thing that could make this panera better is the parking area can get a little crazy at times. 

I don't particularly care for the ""soup schedule"" (soups that are available one day aren't necessarily available the following day), but it is very rare that Panera doesn't have a soup that appeals to me every time I go in. And I really love that the employees will let you sample the soups if you are having a hard time deciding which to get!

Nine times out of ten, I go with the 'Pick 2', which allows you to select soup and half a sandwich, or soup and salad, or 2 soups, or a sandwich and salad... you get the idea. I've never been disappointed with what I ordered in terms of flavor or portion size.

4074211,2013-08-08,0,6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw,"As far as Paneras go, this one is a-okay. As with most restaurants it can be hit or miss depending on the day, time and employees when you are there. I find that in the evenings, the ""C-crew"" is usually on duty. That means SLOW service, small portions, and an unwillingness to make the customer happy. On several occasions when I've dined here after 6 pm I've been told that they were ""out"" of different soups, whole grain bread, etc. with no offer to fix something else. Call me crazy but I think a restaurant with ""Bread"" in its name ought to have whole grain and plain baguettes, which come as standard sides with every meal, cooking up fresh. If the kitchen is out, then they need to bake more! What the heck? 

At lunch time the ""A-crew"" is usually working so you get better food and service. This place gets insanely crowded during the lunch rush so get there early if you want a seat and you want to avoid lines. The staff tries hard to keep the tables clean but there are always some jackass businessmen who get there at 9 am, order coffee, and then sit and hog boots or tables made for 4 people all day long. So rude. 

The interior could use a little TLC and renovation; the place is usually pretty clean but the furnishings are falling apart (note the photo I took of one of their chairs with a huge hole it in fixed with tape). 

The salads here are really good and they use good ingredients. I do agree that the portion sizes can be very small, especially if you don't eat bread or carbs. I usually have the cobb salad here since I'm a low-carber. Check out my photo of the salad they actually served me recently -- the chicken portion on top was SO SKIMPY, even by Panera's standards.

The food is fresh, filling, and of great taste. The ingredients always deliver quality!

There was even a circumstance in which someone in my party was told they were out of one of his orders and this would have been completely fine if he was told immediately, but he was told after a twenty-minute wait which meant he had to wait even longer. We were forced to eat ahead of him to avoid dining on cold soup. *tear*

Other than that, Panera's a pretty decent spot to have a healthy meal! I would have given them a four-star rating if it weren't for the service... I do love all of their soups and the Iced Green Tea is a must for those who like a refreshingly sweet beverage! The ""You Pick 2"" is also perfect for numerous combinations!",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,2,2,3,kkVIKZQK_UqfZpnRivQwMQ

The food is okay. My favorite is their broccoli cheddar soup & their cinnamon crunch (?) bagel. I don't like how they don't serve their soup first thing in the morning. You have to wait til 9 or 10. I've gotten a couple of bagels that were burnt (not extremely but burnt enough). Sometimes their bread is also tough. However, most times their food is good. 

Service is okay. A lot of the workers here aren't very... Welcoming. Some don't know how to smile. I mean, you don't have to like what you do but part of working in the food industry is being a people person.

Whether it be as simple as forgetting extra dressing on the side, or an extra baguette we paid for, all the way up to forgetting the roast beef in my Asiago roast beef sandwich! We have even had pieces of a plastic bag in the soup we ordered. I've eaten at other Paneras across the country and I do not recall as many issues as this particular location has, which leads me to believe poor management is responsible. We have brought it to several different manager's attention, and the issues are still ongoing. So beware if ordering takeout, be prepared to double check your order, even unwrapping your sandwich to make sure they didn't forget the meat. If dining in, chances are you will be asking the server to bring you an item they forgot to include, but at least they can correct that while you are there.",zzvV3l9IqTRX7Db8nxThbA,1,0,2,QYfBdA_zg0EnApK5aiXUeA

The turkey was horrible). I also had the barbecue salad (this was a little better than ok). If I got a great I might eat the salad again, but that is a huge if!",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,2,1,2,1HR7bwPLcxtS7_JDXWCu6w

5928812,2013-04-16,1,6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw,"I have always been a fan of Panera. Whenever I want a tasty sandwich or a meal that will make me full without feeling guilty, I come here. The You Pick 2 option is great! I usually order the Chicken Caesar Sandwich. The chicken is cut into good sized pieces and the three cheese bread is awesome. A very tasty sandwich, although it can get a bit messy. The Mac and Cheese is my other choice. There is an extra charge for this, but I don't mind because it is so delicious, hot and creamy! My husband likes the Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich. I have also tried the Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT in the past, but did not like it. For some reason, it was very bland, even though it had bacon in it. The sweet tea here is also pretty good. Its not overly sweet like the one from Mcdonalds, 

You may have to wait a while for your food, but the good thing is, they don't make it until you order it. Customer service is usually pretty good and friendly. Recently, one of the cashiers charged me for a cookie that I did not order. I didn't notice that on my receipt until I got home. I mean, it was only 99 cents, but still, they need to pay attention to these things! I sent a complaint through the company's website, and got a email from one of the managers who apologized and told me to print out this email and bring it in on my next visit for a free pastry. I still have not had a chance to use this, but what I don't understand is that I have their MyPanera card. So, why couldn't they just add the free pastry to my card? Wouldn't that be easier than me bringing a printout of my email, explaining it to the cashier, the cashier calling a manager over, causing confusion.....geez, it will take me 10 minutes just to get one pastry that I already paid for! Ridiculous! 

Speaking of the MyPanera card, I really don't understand this program, LOL. Its free and the cashier swipes this card whenever you purchase something. But, it doesn't keep track of any ""points"" or how much you spend. Apparently, you will get ""surprise rewards"" according to what you like to eat, and the more you visit, the more ""rewards"" you shall receive. Very vague! I come here at least twice a month, and the only thing I got was a free pastry on my birthday. 

However, I do like the food here, so I will definitely be back.

Their process is very quick and they seem to be quite streamlined to get all the food out in a timely fashion.

My soup was basic. I like to pick up pastries from time to time, namely the pecan roll, but they are good for what they are. As I was walking out, the line had already tripled in size and it was out the door, so make sure to avoid peak times here.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,DgdGgh4Q_vcND7lpRMl91w

The ingredients are always 100% fresh and clean, and they are never ever stingy with their food. Whenever I order online for rapid pick up it's always ready within 5 minutes and it's ALWAYS accurate. If you go to any other location in town, like the rainbow location, they are stingy and don't give you a proper sandwich, and their lettuce is dry and blackened. This location is definitely the golden child. 
Also, they don't have true vegan options but almost anything can be customized to be vegan!",VoRYTBty1GI2Dw6yOYeTqA,0,0,5,pn5rpQGH1DqPxvayhh-Ojw
