Tapioca Express is one of those Boba Tea House that is above the rest of the pack. Their ingredients r fresh new natural. Not like so many Boba Drink stores that use artificial flavorings. I love the extensive selections of drinks which includes teas, juices, smoothies, shave ice, tea lushes, expressos, milk teas, n import sodas. Their snacks r great too, just wish they have more selection n not the norm I can find in another Boba place!

I asked her about one of the items in the menu, and she looked really puzzled. She then answered that she doesn't know at all mainly because she doesn't work in the kitchen. That right there is a bright red flag that I probably should have left. As someone that works at a restaurant, you should be well aware of what it is you're selling. Not only that but she also made various mistakes on our order. All of this was going on while manager was clearly standing next to her. He did absolutely nothing to help us or clarify anything. The food, itself, is not as appetizing especially for it's price. I do not recommend getting the sisig fries. It was pretty disgusting.",DySm2INsmljvsYcPWa_5ww,2,0,2,gB0t2AbxPYUb6QBX0q6Bbg

However, when adding egg pudding you can't adjust the sweetness. When I ordered a regular milk tea with the egg pudding, it was just like sipping through a bland/no flavor pudding. Since I've tried other drinks like the honeydew- it's good! Saw them make it with fresh cut but frozen melon. 

If ordering any food here like their small 3pcs of taro bun, just go to Seafood City and you can get about 6-9pcs for the same price. I have not yet tried any other snacks they offer but I'm scared to due to portion and unreasonable prices.

Still earn my 4 stars for having a delicious boba though. Enough for me to come back when I can. I know that the store is still new but I believe they'll make progress.",dnX-mtga4DN-lZpZYji4YQ,1,0,4,RP7CqiOblkZEHVrwrW2Q-w

Service was acceptable. They called our names in a timely manner, but they forgot that we ordered a green tea with our food. So, they rushed to make it.

The food was great. The tea was nice. It was sweet with a nice aroma that hit the back of my palate the more I drank. The sisig fries were delicious. Exactly what you'd expect, fatty, carby, filling, and bomb.com. It was more than sufficient for that bulky, pre-workout meal.

1602575,2015-04-06,1,A81a8oV8DAxnGLY2_r8dUQ,"Not terrible (as in, still better than some boba places) but definitely the worst Tapioca Express I have been to. I love TapEx in the Bay Area, and I used to go every week for boba and crispy calamari. The location here, while still providing solid tapioca pearls, fell short in customer service, efficiency, and final product. Really, the boba is the only reason to return.

Overall, they definitely still have some kinks to work out. They were unable to answer questions about their menu and told me they had no soy milk and could not add soy or milk to the tea I ordered; behind me, a customer with a diary allergy ordered a drink with soy. When her drink came, the employee said she didn't know what was in it and continued to tell me they didn't have soy. When someone has an allergy, this is just unsafe. 
Ultimately, it came down to her saying that they did have soy, but she refused to make mine with soy milk because she didn't think it would taste good. This, to me, seems ridiculous. 
Really, they retain their three stars because the boba was still delicious- chewy, flavorful, and good to the end of the drink. However, the crispy calamari took about 4-5 times longer than they said it would to make and instead of the flavorful, crispy batter I have grown to love at other locations, this had a heavy overcooked crunch. Knowing how good the product at other TapEx locations is, this was quite disappointing.",vvwO7O6jYgUCJaQ0SNLS_A,2,0,3,R6k6cOmqYWEQZYnhgemXcA

Service: semi-quick + super friendly

Yula, the cashier, was super nice and welcoming. She recommended some of her favorites on the menu, and convinced me to try the longanisa fries (filipino sausage that has a sweet savory taste) even with a prior disclaimer all warm foods take 15-20 minutes to be served which makes sense considering it's primarily a boba place.

It goes to show, good things came to those who wait, because I legit could marry the longanisa fries and my green tea kit kat with boba. The fact this place isn't more busy is a mystery, but it feels great to know I found another hidden gem in Vegas. 

Atmosphere: Calm + Quiet

Aside from the music playing in the dining room, it's mostly empty and quiet. It's ideal for studying and apparently you can use the wifi from Jason's Deli next door for free.

Sure this place had the logo and menu, but unfortunately falls far short of my expectations for a Tapioca Express, quality and customer service wise. 

Customer service is atrocious by my standards. I've felt like I'm more nuisance than welcome on the few times I've been here. Also, when ordering for take out, check for straws because they've never put straws in there for me.

Drink quality, I notice that their blended drinks always have bubble caps rather than the sealed lid. Big no no on drink quality based on the measurements used to make blended drinks. If you have that much extra product after blending a drink, I guarantee you added way too much ice and your drink will taste watered down. 

2 stars for the boba consistency, food, and nostalgia, but this is not the Tapioca Express I'm used to.

Tapioca Express is conveniently located by UNLV, and its ample parking, wide selection of food and drinks along with lots of tables to study makes for my ideal study spot. Unfortunately, the quality of their drinks and customer service seems to be going downhill and I have been disappointed lately. 

SERVICE
First off, some girls here got major attitude. I am a huge fan of milk teas and have tried many of the milk teas here. My most favorite (and sadly one and only drink I like from here) is their oolong milk tea. The problem is...they've been out of oolong tea for what feels like an eternity. Probably ever since dinosaurs existed. Too long!

Back in May, I kindly asked one of the girl if they have oolong tea back and she goes ""Ooohhh, we are probably not getting it back for a loooong loooooooong time"" with rude and snarky attitude. It made me want to choke on boba and walk out of here. She could've apologized for the shortage or at least be a little bit more professional.

I have also overheard these servers talking smack about customers. Unprofessionalism at its finest.

DRINKS
As stated above, I only like oolong milk tea here. It is one and only milk teas here that you can actually taste the tea. Their black milk tea is extremely sweet and taste very artificial. Not even a slightest taste of tea. Jasmine milk tea is ok, has a really distinct and weird taste that I am not a fan of. Other milk teas taste artificial as well, like it is made from powder and syrups.

I do enjoy the boba here. Has the perfect texture every visit. I also got to try their mini boba for the very first time. Personally not a fan but a lot of people seems to enjoy it. 

CONCLUSION
Oolong milk tea seems to be the only thing worth coming to this place but they've been out for a while...I can't speak for other drinks such as slushes or flavored teas since I have yet to try them but I am not sure if I want to deal with the servers here.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,5,2,2,P-MOZn7mj25Wm3jkDlVDLg

What I like about Tapioca Express is not only do you have drinks, but they have a selective menu of finger foods too!  Almost like a little bistro type atmosphere.  But honestly we stopped by here after a HUGE meal in Seafood City consisting of goodies from Grill City & Crispy Town.  I was already stuffed!  But the kid wanted a sweet drink to wash it all down.  Nothing like spending $5 on copious amounts of sugar water!  Oh, and tapioca balls.

I'll give them this, their boba is smaller in size that just about all other places, making it much easier to drink through a smaller straw.  But I dunno, I'm just not all that into boba anymore!  I've done enough tapioca ball chewin' to gain myself like 5 pounds back then.  I drop all that sugar & starch...I drop weight.  Plus I'm not on a sugar high!  I just go back to sugar-free Red Bull or Monster when I have to ha ha ha!

I don't remember what flavor boba smoothie we got, but I'm pretty sure one of the flavors was ube.  We halved it with another flavor.  I took a few sips.  Smoothie had good consistency, almost like a Slurpee & the boba was chewy but not too chewy.  Kid liked it, I thought it was OK.  Nothing I'm gonna drive all the way across town for.  Like spending money on some hipster drinks?  Go to Tapioca Express!  Yes...at the time there were also hipsters hanging out.

But I may have to go back to try some of the food on their menu, looks tasty!  Boy do I have a hard time resisting them croquettes...

But this franchise, like most people mentioned, isn't quite similar to its Californian counterparts. They offer similar drinks but they cater to more of Filipino food aficionados, compared to the Taiwanese snacks that are found elsewhere. With longanisa fries and sisig, I'm not complaining. 

The drinks are not bad but not that great. I like being able to taste the tea in my milk tea but unfortunately of the drinks I've tried, they're either too milky or watered down. HOWEVER, I do recommend asking for your milk tea to be ""blended."" Basically where they ice blend your milk tea into sort of a smoothie.

4108165,2015-05-11,6,A81a8oV8DAxnGLY2_r8dUQ,"The gospel of small tapioca pearls, according to Chris V.

In the beginning, there was bubble tea. The masses tried the sweet drink and chewed thoughtfully on the tapioca pearls. And they saw that it was good.

The drink spread throughout Taiwan, and then across the ocean to America. So it came to pass that this beverage would build a devoted following.

Most establishments that served this beverage utilized large tapioca pearls. Giant straws that could convey the pearls were necessary. Many would enjoy the novelty of these tools.

But some people would feel that these unwieldy instruments forced them to consume the drink far too quickly. They did not like this, nor did they entirely appreciate the alternative of simply not ordering the chewy boba.

Some practitioners of the art turned to small tapioca pearls, rumored to be the original form used in the creation of bubble tea. They found a similar chewy texture that could be enjoyed through a regular, smaller straw. And with that straw, they would finally be able to sip their drink slowly.

Unfortunately, not all vendors would embrace small tapioca. Even in such locations as San Jose and Orange County, these providers appeared to be few and far between.

Lo and behold, the small tapioca pearls have finally been brought to the great desert oasis known as Las Vegas. Whereas other businesses have ignored the allure of ""mini boba,"" one franchise of the chain called Tapioca Express (not known universally for this particular add-on) finally unveiled this option.

On the 11th day of the 5th month in the year of our Lord [that's literally A.D.] 2015, I arrived at this first Tapioca Express of Las Vegas, and I found the small tapioca that I had only previously witnessed in the land of California.

Although TapEx's standard milk tea ($2.98, +$0.50 for large size) is prepared from a product that is markedly sweet, an employee did indicate that they can adjust the sugar levels of certain flavored teas. This brings significant hope for the future.

Regardless, if the burden of an overly sweet milk tea must be weighed against the beauty of small pearls (+$0.50 per topping), I will cheerfully choose their small pearls because they are properly chewy and do not clump.

So come all ye boba lovers, and try the small tapioca! See what you've been missing all along.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,11,4,lKfBWuRJa5b6TPn6Uw3jow

My cousin and I came here to check it out with already high standards of how things should be. It is located right next to Jason's Deli, Wingstop, and Seafood City (Asian central, basically). Service was on par. It was quick and the girl who took our orders was very friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the Halo Halo and Avocado snow bubble. I'm not sure why people weren't able to taste the avocado in theirs. We tasted ours and saw the lady use real avocados to make them! We also decided to order the Matcha fried Oreos. It was served with 4 Oreos and a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle. They were good, but nothing special, especially since I didn't taste the matcha that much. However, it didn't meet our standards and while the food and drinks were good, it wasn't anything spectacular.

Seating is plenty and it's very spacious and clean here. I'm glad it isn't as cramped and dirty as some other boba places, like Tea Station or Volcano Tea in Chinatown.

I decided to give this place a try as my friend was in the need of boba tea. Upon entering, I was greeted right away by a friendly and cheerful employee. She explained to me that what makes them stand out is that they have two sizes of bobas. They have the smaller size ""pearls"" which a regular straw would accomadate and the bigger (more common) ""pearls"", in which the fat straws are needed. 

I decided to go with the bigger size boba since the smaller ones were not availble at the time.  I'm guessing it was because I came right when they opened so maybe they didn't get to make it yet? Nonetheless, I went with the taro flavor in the larger of the two sizes they offer. 

Order came up fast and I was on my way eager to see if I found a new spot for boba with my friend. The flavor of taro was very artificial and powdery. The drink was cloyingly sweet-even for me who would be Mayor of Sugar City if they had an election. Texture of the boba was ok, but had zero flavor.

I had a busy day at work last week and decided a bubble tea might make my day a little better and I stopped by on my lunch. Bad Idea. Short ribs took a while to prepare. I guess that's a good thing they were piping hot and succulent. Could have been slightly more tender but for a bubble tea place not bad at all. The garlic rice wasn't very garlicky. Which is funny because the manager asked if I wanted garlic rice and I said ok! Then he says its a really good garlic rice. He lied :/. 

The milk tea I ordered came with the combo I ordered a regular and they gave me a large. They charged me wrong and undercharged me and I told the cashier and they said not to worry about it because they couldn't figure out how to do it in their new registers as the place had only been open a few days. 

The royal milk tea itself was pretty good. Not my favorite I've had but not bad. The boba was the standard soft slightly mushy boba you find pretty much everywhere besides KFT. I love KFT but no one makes their boba like them. I think everyone should get in on the secret because it has amazing texture and flavor. 

Service was great here the first time. Second time it was ok. Not as good as the first time. My second visit I came today and we ordered a Thai tea and a taro slush without boba. The Thai tea tasted too strong and was undrinkable IMO. The taro slush was pretty good but again I think KFT is killing the boba and taro slush game. Overall this is an ok option if you're not willing to drive all the way to Chinatown.  I can see this place as a chill spot to study or chill with drinks and grab a drink.

That was the life, listening to Beyonce's crazy in love, sippin' on some boba, chatting on AIM, while downloading illegal music...and no adult responsibilities. 

Anywho, Vegas finally has TapEx as of last year?! Still the same! In a good way. It's a solid chain. Can't complain. Service is always so-so. 

TapEx is still cool because they are the only ones in town that have hazelnut snow bubble, mini boba, and decent spicy popcorn chicken! 

The overall space inside is great. For a boba shop, plenty of seating! 

Who is in the mood for a sugar high? TapEx advertises drink specials like: green tea kit kat, ferrero rocher, and tareo (taro+oreo?!). TapEx also offers more food items than other places, including some Filipino inspired dishes. 

Side notes: 
- I only order two things: caramel or hazelnut snow bubble. Same thing forever. It's good and comforting. Not mind blowing.

- I have tried: earl grey milk tea. Not impressed. Actually, I dislike their milk teas here.

On a recent shopping trip with my parents and tita(aunt) in this busy shopping plaza anchored with Seafood City. It's not hard to missed a Boba Tea shop near Las Vegas default Filipino town, which is one reason why this place gets a decent amount of customers and not much competition in the area. The majority Filipino staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the flavor of the actual milk teas were ok plus they don't have the option to adjust sweetness level. I prefer my drinks less sweet so I'm able to taste all components of my drink. I do like the option that they have two sizes of Boba, regular and small. 

The shop is much larger than others in town, makes it an ideal place to hangout with a group of friends or family. Plus, they have various Meriendas (snacks) that have a Filipino twist.

The milk tea and Jasmine milk tea taste about the same from California, but other drinks - my fave, lavender milk tea/snow bubble is unavailable. The papers menus where the cash register are, are unreliable because they have items listed (like lavender milk tea) but don't actually have them as a product in store: they use menus from other stores as references haha so just rely on the menu board in store.

decent popcorn chicken in Las Vegas but found something in my popcorn chicken today (not my first time to order it) 

they stopped having stamp cards also. I had one stamp remaining and then would get a free one - the only reason I came lol

2.5 stars rounding up but the popcorn chicken will satisfy you, milk tea - eh, skip.",cO-pVqt2ZKLItpeQZi5gjg,0,0,3,NheHlXTZSwWILlO1kCvGkw

The owner gave us free crispy chicken and heck, it was so good we decided to eat here. On top of that, ordered crispy chicken again (rice) and sisig rice as well :) The food was not oily at all, for it to be fried. The place was clean, the workers were nice, and the food was delicious!! Definitely deserves 5 stars!!!",P70Eh7osdzsMJ392yiLGqQ,0,1,5,I7WSZrHOZBPsp1dsj1QYVQ

It literally never fails. They aren't welcoming and they always seem impatient to get the transaction over and done with. 

I'm not there for them, though. I just want my boba and sisig fries or mild crispy chicken.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,1,1,4,h05qgwxDT-yO9XDaOmv9kQ

5715781,2015-09-11,1,A81a8oV8DAxnGLY2_r8dUQ,"Went 9-10-15 around 6PM cuz' I was craving boba! 

 $11.60 got me some chicken fries and a large jasmine tea with boba. 

The fries were great...hot and crispy.  They were topped with some delicious popcorn-sized pieces of fried chicken, cheese, and some kind of sauce.  You can choose your level of spicy. 

Years ago, Banquet made these fried, breaded, barbecue chicken wings that were outta this world good and I was on a perpetual search for them until I found out they don't make them anymore.  The chicken on these fries tasted exactly like the Banquet chicken.  I was in heaven. The cashier said it comes with water or plain tea unless you want to upgrade to a fancy-schmancy drink.  

The jasmine tea....meh.  I'm kind of a beginner in the world of boba but every other jasmine tea I've had from different places came already sweetened.  The milk tea here did not.  Note to self....next time ask for some Splenda.  By the time I got it home the milk was curdling and separating from the tea.  It still tasted fine, though.  But the boba was reaaaaal mushy-there was no texture left to it.  Kinda turned me off.  

Pretty neat place...can't wait to take my husband here!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,2,2,4,fDmZg-mE3jcRFAuyJSIvDw
5719153,2016-02-05,0,A81a8oV8DAxnGLY2_r8dUQ,One of my favorite boba places in town.. I absolutely love the snow bubble texture and the many flavors they have.. The place is really clean..  I come here often with either my boyfriend or my mom and I've yet to have a bad experience. Workers are pretty friendly and helpful too if you're looking to experiment with a new flavor or mixture of any drink.,fkf5UTsQTakNIAiwZfDW5g,0,0,5,ftBYYJ_CEVDPxb3PKnUqNA

When you walk in, you'll notice how spacious this place is and how clean it is. When you go to the register, you'll notice a little black board filled with daily specialty drinks. When I went, they had captain crunch and nerds added to their board. Seemed very interesting to try later on. 

I always, ALWAYS, always order the cantaloupe smoothie here. It is to die for if you're a big fan of cantaloupe. Their coconut and yogurt drinks are amazing as well, but I stuck with my usual and ordered the cantaloupe smoothie. Since I was also hungry, what better way to pair it off with the crispy chicken rice plate (extra spicy please!). I always have the hardest time choosing between the crispy chicken rice and the longanisa fries because they're both so yummy! 
Such deliciousness in my mouth. 

Food:
The crispy chicken rice plate consists of:
Chicken,steamed veggies, two scoops of rice, and an egg to top it all off. (Very filling)

This will always be one of my go to spots if I'm craving cantaloupe or near school. The workers have always been consistent with their service, food, and drinks. Will definitely see this place again sometime soon since I'm craving cantaloupe again!",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,3,2,4,PRDu_J-bs3D5Cdcqr9gbug

They're super nice and always smiling! They suggest good stuff too and now my favorite that I'm always craving is the chocolate bubble! TapEx also has this thing where you can do a drink upgrade, for cheap! Awesome. I love their longanisa fries, the sauce (or whatever they put on it) is SO GOOD! Definitely love coming here whenever I have a boba craving. MMM!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,0,4,Y43rV2wLoeKHZ0KrKQLYsw
