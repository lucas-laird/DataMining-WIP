432457,2011-10-17,0,39rjgt5MpEACNzyFnUmyaQ,Best paninis ever!!! Don't expect to eat in fancy atmosphere as it's a part of the food court in the Venetian and it's a little loud. But the paninis are amazing!!! Be ready to pay about $10 each and it's definitely worth it! You can get 1/2 panini also. It's pretty big and soo delicious!! Wish we had them in LA.

472809,2011-06-05,0,39rjgt5MpEACNzyFnUmyaQ,"Came here for lunch with a coworker on 6/1/11. It's located inside the Venetian at the food court upstairs(next to Johny Rockets). When we got here, there was a line so the co worker and I thought that was a good sign. They had a display of what they offer by the register and the tomato and mozzarella panini caught my eye. The coworker was also interested in the same sandwich so I decided to get something else so we can both try two diff sandwiches. I ordered the Portabella Mozzarella  while she got what initially caught my eyes.  I tried my order first before i tried her half and it was good! The bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft  inside. There were plenty of mozzarella, tomato, and red and green lettuce inside. My only complaint was the amount of mushroom it had. For a Portabella sandwich you would think it would be filled with it, but it wasn't at all.  The other sandwich on the other hand was also good, but not as good. Possibly because it had basil and pesto in it which I think doesnt do a lot of justice in sandwiches. It was served in a toasted panini unlike the other sandwich and had plenty of the same things the first sandwich had, minus the Portabella. Overall, both were tasty but pricey. I spent around 20 bucks for the two of us and that also included two large 'freshly squeezed' lemonade. So if you're around the Venetian upstairs and are looking for something light to eat, do stop by here!",kDUoBp9SgJSeS7-5443k5A,0,0,4,wkiyLLSJF5wR5TQGex2ytQ
558700,2014-04-16,1,39rjgt5MpEACNzyFnUmyaQ,"The food was what you would expect from a non-chain. I ordered the tomato mozzarella, and it was surprisingly really good! I normally like eating sandwiches with meat, but I had meat the night before, so I was like why not get a sandwich that's vegetarian? So I asked the cashier, and she said she would get tomato mozzarella. It was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.

I'm giving this place a 4 star because the sandwiches were pretty pricey, and not too big... If it was a bit less expensive, it would be a 5 star.",Xnc7vVLBJXDofxOSla7PEw,1,1,4,CZ_433ac_VuXkVcaE3YUCA

They offer their sammiches in either half or whole portions. Half actually is plenty for me. Tried their clubini, which had turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce and swiss. Best panini I've had thus far.

2502545,2011-08-25,0,39rjgt5MpEACNzyFnUmyaQ,"Bella Panini is a small sandwich shop located in the Venetian Hotel food court. This place offers an array of sandwiches, salads, and wraps; a healthier option for hotel guests. I ate here several times during my stay and even got all my friends to as well! I ate one of the sandwiches called the Clubini, which was delicious! It contained Roasted Turkey Breast, Bacon, Mixed Greens, Avocado, Tomato, and Provolone sandwiched between toasted white Panini bread. I also had the California Chicken Wrap, which was my favorite dish there. The chicken was really tender and there were plenty of avocados!

The biggest reason why I like this place over any of the other restaurants in the Venetian Hotel food court (Panda Express, Johnny Rockets, Nathan's, etc.) is because their dishes do not contain all the grease and fat as many places do. Although the food is somewhat expensive, ranging from $8 - $14 per entr√©e, you get the personal satisfaction that you snacked on something on the lighter side. So if you are staying at the Venetian Hotel, consider Bella Panini for your health-conscious needs!",hTjBPgbI_OEX1HCaMzPMUg,1,0,4,_MuVnjKVWUpQeOYJ0ckz5w

If watching people kill themselves all day smoking, drinking and gambling makes you crave fresh foods like salad, come here.

bella panini was one of the only places that stuck out in the food court, honestly this part of the grand canal shoppes is a big disappointment i come to vegas not only that i enter the venetian i really don't wanna see a panda express or even a freakin johnny rockets.... c'mon now

there was this interesting bistro but since i was in the venetian i was in an italian mood so i moseyed on over to bella panini, all the sandwiches looked good, but the price is what killed me.. but then again i was on vacation mode so i didn't mind spending a little bit more on a sandwich at what looks like a fast food place. but then again vacation mentality so i ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich with an order of fries, another thing i didn't like was that each sandwich didn't come with a side of fries or even offered a combo... 

the sandwich was good, chicken nice and crispy, the fries on the other hand were a disappointment i believed they labeled the fries with some kind of adjective that praised it... only reason i got them was that word, oooh marketing it's gonna get yea

wouldn't really come back, would rather try the bistro across the court next time and other places in the venetian and vegas before trying another sandwich from bella panini",kbzXkH-bxG966-7lgpvRLQ,0,0,3,Ts0d5QxXK56UffVEobQ7sg

1. Clubini, 10.95

- Breaded chicken breasts, grilled eggplants, mozzarella, marinara sauce and parmigiano Reggiano shavings

- In Venetian food court. 
- Attractive non-chain. Must-try. 
- A bit expensive for just a sandwich. I'd probably just go to Earl's in PH or Palm's. For value. 
- Clubini was great! Excellent cold sandwich! Gotta love a sandwich was bacon. 
- Chicken parmigiano was superb! Delicious taste. Tender chicken. Great mix.
