Great music and friendly people.  The only downfall to this experience is that we always seem to get the exact same waitress no matter where we sit in lounge, which would be fine if she knew the menu, drinks, and how to actually provide an enjoyable dining experience. I would just like for the Manager/Owner to be aware that some of the employees they have working for them are actually taking away from a wonderful hidden treasure.",csvWpiLtNfotaL1TwBWa5A,3,1,3,76cheV-ORrC9VLEPezWVWg

Ichabod's is near my work so I have been here several times for lunch and every time we've had bad service.  We almost always have to wave someone down to get a refill on our water, and getting the check can sometimes take 20 minutes.

If you have an hour lunch... you can expect to use the whole hour, and you might even be late.

1572954,2010-03-08,0,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,"We went to Ichabods because I had a coupon and wanted to try something different.  It is located in a shopping center so I was surprised when we walked in and saw that the decor is very old Vegas - low lighting, red tablecloths, candles on the tables.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bar and dining area are separated.  If you have children in your party, you enter the dining room through the door on your left.

The prices were very reasonable (less than $10 per person for breakfast and lunch).  I had the Monterey Chicken Philly with no mushrooms and the dressing on the side.  The roll tasted nice but was large and the chicken did not fill it all.  I guess I am used to seeing the meat spilling out of a philly.  The fries were adequate.

My husband had his standard two eggs, hash browns, and toast.  A plus was the availability of turkey sausage (although there is a small extra charge).  He said it was nice - which is a compliment.

Our waitress, Debbie, was very nice and attentive.  She was busy but still came by to check on us and fill our drinks.

I would return to Ichabods except for one thing - the toddler.  She was a little loud for the atmosphere.  If you do take little ones, keep in mind that Ichabods does not have a children's menu - thus no crayons - so bring something to keep them occupied.  This is certainly not a complaint about the restaurant, just an observation.  Other than that, Ichabods was pleasant and well worth the money.

The decor is the best I have ever seen in a Sports Bar. There are two areas, a bar with dining area and a separate dining area, bar smoking, dining non smoking. The chairs at the tables in the bar area are like someone would see in a gourmet restaurant, in fact if you took a picture of the tabletop and chairs and showed it to people everyone would say it was a picture from a gourmet restaurant.
The bartender was friendly and I was chatting with two people sitting next to me.
The  next morning I had a urge for Chicken Fried Steak, so Ichabods. Arrived a little after 7am, sat at the bar and ordered. When it arrived the eggs were done properly but very small. The home fries were excellent. The Chicken Fried Steak, the star of the show, was terrible. The meat was very small surrounded with a lot of breading, which was not crunchy and had no flavor. The gravy was tasteless also.It gets worse, every 24/7 sports bars serves this item, price ranges from $4.95 to $7.95. this one was $10.95. This might be the most expensive sports bar Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas.

The menu here has a seafood emphasis, with steamed mussels, seafood salad, and several specials (salmon, fish and chips, roughy) in addition to the usual apps, sandwiches, burgers, etc. 

The hype about the salad bar brought me in (available 10am-10pm?), but I ordered gyro salad instead, along with the soup of the day. Food was hot and fresh, especially the produce. The salad dressing and soup tasted like they were made in house, but the gyro meat seemed prepackaged. I'd try a different salad here in the future.

Dining room is going for an upscale vibe with dim lighting, table cloths, and flowers on each table. You can also order from the bar side, which has plenty of TV screens to watch a game.

They also had an AYCE salad bar, but it wasn't to extravagant and it looked like they were running out on alot of items.  

As for the service, it was good, but not that good.  Our server had little to no personality and was way too sarcastic.  Our food was brought out by the chef himself so that was nice.

You can smoke, drink, dine and gamble in the bar area, which is separated from their regular dining room.  The patrons and staff are a cross-section of young and old, but everyone is very friendly. 

The Saturday night we were there, they even had a piano player serenading us while we enjoyed our well-prepared entrees of grilled pork chops (me) and NY Steak (him). The piano player even takes requests! 

Service was friendly, albeit a tad slow, but it was a full house and our server was also training someone, so we cut her some slack. 

I felt like I was in one of those wonderful supper clubs you see in movies from the 60's, where people gather to enjoy good food, good music and a little tobacco throughout the evening.  Ahhh, the good ol' days!

Ichabod's is now at the top of my list of dining establishments in Las Vegas that accommodate smokers AND has terrific food.

After mentioning how disappointed we'd be to take our business to Outback, the hostess quickly found a booth she could clean up to fit us. After a short wait it was ready, we were seated and began to peruse the menu.

The atmosphere is pretty nice, though it's definitely dark. The lounge area is completely blocked off from the restaurant, which allows people to smoke at the bar as well as letting the establishment serve food. While we were there they had a guy playing piano and later he was accompanied by a man playing the flute. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib special, an order of hot wings and the greek town cheese-steak with chicken. The prime rib came with the unlimited soup and salad bar; most of the veggies looked fresh enough, there was a lot of canned things available, about 4 dressings and two soups were out, though one of the soups was pretty low. When the wings were brought out, they seemed a little undercooked. The meat had a chewy texture, not crispy at all- and was juicy to the point of almost pink. 

The prime rib was very pink and tender and came with a tasty horseradish sauce. The mashed potatoes were chunky, so that's a plus; means they most likely used real potatoes. 

The greek town sandwich was alright, but the chicken breast was a little dry. The fries it came with were good. 

Our friends ordered a cheeseburger well-done and it came out pink in the middle. He sent it back and the second one was a little more finished but not cooked all the way through.

The nachos looked good; they were a HUGE portion! Definitely not an appetizer for one or two people, it's geared towards feeding a whole table. 

The portions were big and the food was decent but nothing to get supremely worked up over. The atmosphere is definitely the highest point, as it feels like old school Vegas.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,3,pHZCBx48AX9zlEfK5apyVg

There has always been an abruptness about the arrival and seating process, and the order taking and service is much the same. Impersonal, I guess, is the word that comes to mind. Which leads me up to Thanksgiving. We made dinner reservations as my cousin, who also lives in the neighborhood, didn't care to drive far. When we arrived, no one said, Happy Thanksgiving, only, Is this table OK? Then came the server - she was rushed, and wanted to be sure we knew she only had a certain amount of time to take our order. That done, the turkey dinners came. And this is where  Ichabod's has lost me for good: all processed white and dark meat. Pretty disgraceful. The sodium was popping inside my mouth.

I thought, ""This is gonna be great if the remainder of the food was as tasty and they gave you as much!""

Unfortunately, the specials really let me down.  The pastrami sandwich was salty, salty, salty.  The ribettes were super super tender, but lacked any flavor in the meat.  It's as if they boiled them and slathered some bbq sauce on it.  Yech!

The inside of the this place is creepy dark, almost to the point of tripping over furniture.  The small Tiffany-esque lamps on the tables and huge, heavy-looking furniture add to the quirky atmosphere.  To top it off they have someone playing a piano to a Casio-style beatbox!  It's a fun spectacle that must be experienced to be appreciated fully,

I had the Neptune wrap for lunch today.  It was quite tasty.  The avocado was fresh and the French fries are coated with something that give them a little extra crunch.  I think the Strawberry Fields salad is on the agenda for my next visit.  I was offered a candied walnut from the salad by my lunch companion and it was sweet, but not disgustingly sugar crusty like your typical candied walnut.

My only real complaint is that they are used to working with a senior citizen clientele here, so service can be a little slow.  However, when we told our server that we were on a time crunch to get back to work on time today she was pleasant and incredibly helpful.  

Ichabod's is definitely on my list of favorites when work takes me to the east side.",bj9RFpzAekozJpSWOU_0xQ,1,0,4,mE5NEavdTxIGREHSTb1zgg

We are a small group of 3-4 who eat every Tuesday night after our class. The employees have ALL gone out of their way to accommodate our needs. We are welcomed like family and they know what we like to order. They have offered split salads, they make sure our different dietary requirements are met, and even our special occasions are acknowledged like birthdays. We are in love with the hot spinach salad and salmon! We miss the pizza fries, we have ordered eggs and potatoes and it has all been delicious.

We thank the twins who started serving us but no longer work on Tuesdays, Shannon is our regular server and makes sure we are happy. Frankie sometimes serves us when we arrive in between shifts, Juan comes out of the kitchen  and serves and cooks for us, Kim starts us with drinks, and Chris the night bartender always walks us outside to make sure we get into our cars safely. This is all great, and they go above and beyond and we truly appreciate all of you!

The restaurant is located on the eastside of the Strip in a shopping center. Once you enter you are brought into an old world style of Las Vegas. The great difference, a SMOKE FREE GLASS ENCLOSED ROOM! (This is how we found Ichabods) I have asthma so it makes a difference. There is live music , and old photographs that are fun to look at.

 Ichabod's served up a bomb omelet for breakfast. I get the impression the rest of the menu is solid the service was friendly and nice.

If you want to remove yourself from the culture and worries of today, get to Ichabod's immediately. 

We love coming to this place because it makes you feel at home. The music playing in the restaurant takes you time traveling to a simpler time, the food is delicious and the booths give you an unexpected amount of privacy and romance. Perfect for a cheap date night where you just want to eat something that makes your stomach happy. 

Our order at Ichabod's usually looks like this:
1. All you can eat salad bar! Why? Because it's fun, that's why. But also the salad bar is always fresh and gives you lots of great options. I'm always grabbing seconds and thirds. 

2. Chicken wings! Choose from breaded or non. Enjoy a variety of flavors from BBQ to (my fave) lemon pepper. 

3. The cheesesteak! Now, not usually my go-to in a place that serves many different types of dishes. I'm a cheesesteak lover, so I don't risk ordering it at restaurants in case it's bad. But this cheesesteak is TO DIE FOR. The bread is soft, the meat is stacked, the cheese is cheesy and gooey. Perfect. 

As for parking, lots of options for handicapped parking. The lot always looks packed, but no worries, you'll always find a spot. 

The bathroom is pretty standard, although I will say it seems as though maybe the doors were put on backwards or something.  Just another quirky addition to this establishment.

Went in late on a Friday evening to see a bartender friend who I learned was now working at Ichabods.  Unfortunately it was her day off.  Decided to grab a bite to eat at the dining room.  

The dining room is nice in a vintage way.  It looks fancy, but is absolutely causal.  No smoke smell at all from the adjoining glassed off bar area.  There is a salad and soup bar.  Everything (including restrooms) was clean.  Prices were reasonable and the service was competent.  I had the open beef sandwich and my dining partner had the beef stroganoff (daily special) and the soup and salad bar.  We were both pleased and based on this visit, plan on returning again for food.

It was cute hearing the patrons and servers talking like friends. You can tell the customers are repeat customers who come often aka regulars.

I had a California club with potato wedges and a cup of Manhattan clam chowder. My friend only got a side of fries because she wasn't hungry and it totaled about $15. I thought it was a lot of food and the quality of the food was surprisingly really good. Those were the best potato wedges I've ever had in my life! The club had buttered bread that was toasted and I thought it was a nice touch.

The staff was really nice and the restaurant was really clean. The food came out slower than one might be used to, but not slow. & I didn't care because the food was good. They have a huge menu with pastas, fish dishes, steaks, and the typical breakfast stuff like omelettes and pancakes.

My only complaint about the place has to be the smell. It smells of cigarettes and something off putting. We sat on the side away from the bar but it still smelled. It's probably just because it's old.

This is nice so the smoke doesn't overpower the dinning room. It's a quiet, dark atmosphere in the dinning room. It has nice booths and some tables and chairs in the middle. They have a nice small salad bar in the back too. 

Service: They are a bit slow here sometimes, but depends on the waitress you get. Mostly they seem pretty friendly. I liked the waitress we had today. 

Food:  So far the food has been pretty good. The prices are middle ranged, but true have nice sized potions. 
This time I ordered off the daily special menu and got the clams linguini. 
It was good. Lots of clams, lots of garlic (maybe a tad bit much), and good sized portion. It came with 2 small pieces of very good garlic toast. 
My Grandpa got the prime rib. It was a big portion, and he loved it. I took a bite, and it was tender and cooked perfectly for me. The problem is he wanted med-well. It was more med to med-rare.

The real reason to update my review is that I started playing Video Poker on occasion and their Royal starts at $1500 on the progressive for quarters.

The atmosphere is dim lighting and very relaxed feeling. I enjoyed that. 

The food is tasty, however, they do need to learn how to serve a hamburger. When I ordered my chili burger, it came out... well... sort of served bar style? The top bun was cut in half and the bottom bun was not... but... why would you put the burger and chili and toppings on top of BOTH buns, and slop it all over the edge so I can't rearrange the sandwich? I ended up having to eat it open faced with a knife and fork, which is NOT why I ordered a burger.

The waitress was a bit surly and unpleasant, and bordering on neglectful occasionally. She seemed to spend a lot more time focusing on the obnoxious table next to us, who made a lot of noise. I guess the squeaky wheel does get the grease.

I had the beef and cheddar sandwich, which is an all-time favorite of mine. They have set the bar very high with this one. The sourdough was cheesy and crunchy with every bite. The beef...oh my, the beef! It was consistent. Juicy and oh so good! They must dip in au jus. The fries were nice and crispy to the last one. Even the pickles were awesome!

It's a very cool ""old Vegas"" joint as many note.  Even lunch on a weekday had a nice vibe to it.  It was dark, low key, with nice music playing.  I had the San Francisco sourdough burger, which comes with cheese and mushrooms on parmesan bread.  I added fried onions, as I usually do when fried onions are available.  The bread was great, you could definitely taste the parmesan.  But, it was overly greasy, which got worse when you add the cheese and the burger patty.  The chipotle mayo was very good, had a nice kick to it.  But, annoyingly, I was not given my fried onions with the order.  So, I ate the first half of the burger without them.  They are solid, basically small onion rings.  I recommend them, and hopefully you get them with your meal.

Instead of fries, I tried the potato wedges at the recommendation of the server.  They were good, but not homemade.  I did prefer them to fries, so she was right on in that regard.

Every employee was very friendly.  I'll return and likely try an entrée next time, and I'm sure I'll update my review to 4 stars.  It's a cool joint, we need more of them in Vegas.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,0,3,y_1KYUKQY9eAFP1FDVVnPw

5182444,2006-07-28,1,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,"As fun as the Strip is for out-of-towners, it's incredibly frustrating for locals: a traffic nightmare of epic proportions, and assuming you can actually get somewhere and park, you still have to negotiate swarms of tourists everywhere you turn.  Most of the time, it's just not worth it if all you want is a quick, no-fuss meal in a quiet spot.  That's where Ichabod's comes in.

Located in a kind of blah strip mall, Ichabod's doesn't look like much from the outside.  Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside, either - it's quite dark, with strips of Xmas lights running around the walls, and green plants spilling out of boxes atop the dividers between booths (I guess they must be fake, since sunlight rarely penetrates Ichabod's).  It's usually slow, and the servers don't seem all that enthusiastic, and are sometimes hard to find.

The food makes up for the depressing ambience, though.  The Bloody Marys are excellent, and I'm told that their soups are great as well.  The menu is pretty casual, diner-type stuff - lots of sandwiches and salads.  Their wraps are the specialty, and definitely worth trying, especially the chicken caesar wrap and the Neptune wrap.  Packed with meats and veggies wrapped inside spinach- or tomato-flavored wraps, they're huge and tasty.  There's some kind of salad bar there, too, but I've always been afraid of its janky appearance (though that's kind of an Ichabod's theme).

This is by no means a hip or trendy place, and if you see other diners at all, they'll be older couples and families.  But if you're tired of the touristy throngs and just want to go someplace where you can walk right in and be seated (and not pay $12 for a burger), turn to the dark side and try Ichabod's.",Ffa1cXIvFAy8H1sorICaiQ,5,2,4,QqPYmo2qEBshr3_iIV3R8w

The bartenders are beyond friendly, your drink is always fresh, and the regulars are always down for making conversation.

5633123,2015-07-18,0,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,"Old school Vegas. Good food, good service. Nice atmoshphere. The salad bar...boring. I hate these salad in a bag places. That is what they offer. Lettuce cut up somewhere else and trucked in in plastic bags. Veggies sliced somewhere else and shipped in in plastic bags or containers. Boring. 

Now the good part. I ordered the ribeye. One of the best steaks I have eaten in some time. The steak was flavorfully cooked, juicy, and flavorful. My guest ordered a pasta dish that was not what she wanted. It was too full of wine sauce. We asked the server and they replaced it with my guests second choice from the menu. No Charge even thou we offered to pay for the food. It was not the kitchens fault. It was just not what we expected. 

Service couldn't have been better. Wonderful service, wonderful food. Lots of old people. Not a real young peoples place. Keep up the great work!!!!!",CIfb8avje6UhqQZaF74VVg,1,0,4,MuO6B-_FPk_ALQDf0SdRjA
5643524,2017-05-03,0,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,We dined last night and had the worst service! It was a Tuesday night not that busy and yet the servers were non existent once we were seated. Finally a server came by and asked have you been helped. We ordered right away. I ordered a meal with the soup and salad bar.  The soup is not on the bar so I had to ask someone who explained they would have to get the soup for me out of the kitchen. I told her what kind I wanted and were I was sitting she said she would get it for me. It never came I asked someone else for the soup it to never came. Now the food came and the server dropped off the food and never came back. My husband asked for rolls and butter from someone else and when they finally came there was no butter.  The food is just average. And every time I have been there the service is lousy! Beginner servers maybe?  It is always an older crowd maybe they don't care weather the service is lousy or not! Don't waste your time or money!,CxsKf6BQ1RnKm7vd8oqI3Q,0,1,1,FzPHU66olfywE2bKk3byTg
5663553,2014-12-07,1,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,"We used to visit ichabods at least once a week when you could get the best salad bar in town  for free with an entree.. Then the price went to $2.99, we still came because it was still the best in town.  Then it jumped to $3.99 and we noticed smaller portions and higher menu prices. . So we stopped coming. . After about 6 month or so we stopped last night as I was craving that salad bar.  I ordered the hot turkey $8.99 and my partner had the chicken parm sandwich. We then asked to add the salad bar and was told it was now $6.99 to add the bar to a sandwich. So, no salad bar for us.  You can only get the salad bar for $3.99. If you have an entree or order a special. The chicken parm was delicious,  a true winner.  My turkey, was a tiny scoop of mash and bread with a few turkey pieces. . While good, the portion was Def smaller than ever. . To say the least I think they probably have lost 3 customers for good,  and yes that salad bar was still looking good but, they took the soup away and now you have to order it from the kitchen instead of it being at the salad area.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,7,0,4,Pa4-J7A5qjJwWOt4QT6TxA
5688683,2013-01-10,0,kPV1DlXSkcXY5G8r2LLmEA,"This review is pretty much only a nacho review because I heard that the nachos were the best in the city and lately I have become a bit of a nacho tramp and I'm working my way around the city to find the best batch. The basic rundown: the bar is a typical bar but the restaurant is actually pretty cozy and perfect for hangover Sundays...or Mondays...or Wednesdays, you get the point, it's dark, dimly lit and has lots of booths. It has a very old school feel with pictures of old school Vegas. The server was awesome (minus the Raiders shirt), nice and very attentive. 

On to the food, I hate reading too many positive reviews about a place because then it places my expectations too high and all I read was how good Ichabod's nachos are. Well... the reviewers were right, the nachos were pretty good. I didn't want to believe people when they said it was some of the best in the city but it definitely warrants top 5 consideration. Right blend of cheese, chicken, and no overkill on the chips. Sold.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,5,3,4,dvAbwO5Yh-juCQER84_RtA

I've lived in this neighborhood for five years, passed Ichabod's thousands of times, and never until today made it inside.

I am five years late.

This place is my new favorite restaurant, bar, hangout.  Super clean, great bar ambiance, and the kind of friendly waitresses that you remember from the 'old days' but can never find anymore (Julie was A++). Our Bloody Caesars were out in a flash and absolutely yummy; the food that followed was surprisingly fast, hot, and tasty. 

*Happy note for other Horrible Smokers : On the bar/lounge side, there are actual ashtrays on the actual tables, and nobody will give you stink-eye when you light up.",6XO9sx-kktvBE_9FlI5G5w,2,0,5,DkmgXXMd65rdhVF0cBVaTg
