Totally unfair to compare this to Capriotti's, Subway, Firehouse, or Port-a-Sub. This is the gourmet of subs, in my book. The ingredients are freshly sliced in front of you, the tastiest bread, and flavor abounds. Sure it's a bit more expensive than the other places, but the care, flavor and service are all there and worth it.",EruLYDd5XMWX--aT2l3MTQ,0,0,5,D1hfWlWFuUioOkaADoRwZQ

When your in a competitive market like sub sandwhiches you would think if your going to charge more, you would offer more. Not here. You get about half the vegetables to choose from and cant even get a footlong. 15"" is a little to much, but when you got half of the fixings I guess it ranks out to be about the same. They need to change there prices to reflect the market. There trying to get more for less. Thats not going to work with me.
Good luck.",RdYgKsrLR6jN-B7nsLZbSg,0,0,3,KU3UmFZc-fsqsPQFOr4tZg

We were actually closer to a different one but decided to drive to this location because it had better Yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed! We were greeted immediately by the cashier (Alayna). The general manager (Manny) was on his way out the door but stayed to chat with us when we told him that this was our first time at a Jersey Mike's. We ordered two sandwiches -- the pastrami and a cheesesteak. Mmmmmmmm... We were in heaven! We'll definitely be returning to this place! (It's on West Cheyenne and is a couple doors down from Steiner's.) By the way... Thank you, Kyle! You made my sandwich perfectly!",EQTQ4uv7bwI_Q5s2cSDAmA,0,1,5,AwzmHBeG7lWr54qsMlkkkQ

1526403,2017-11-11,0,HkAj0bamytrhj8FQM5I-zw,This is by far my favorite sandwich shop. My parents owned a Subway franchise and I grew up making sandwiches and waiting on customers. I have eaten Subway my whole life up until the point I found Jersey Mike's. The sandwich is simple not too many fixings and it just comes together perfectly. Sometimes I eat there twice in a day and rack up my points 4 a free sandwich. Tuesday is double Point day so I try to make it there on that day but any day is a good day to go get a Jersey Mike's Sub. Thank you so much for the nice staff they even know my sandwich by heart when I go in there. That's why I keep coming back every day and get a number 9. Always with the bacon.,noVEFdHrJ3QiulPcSnMHdQ,0,0,5,dnsdbef50dD8aQMaG2waMQ

I usually eat at a restaurant a few times before writing anything because everyone has off days but everyone also hits first time home runs so I usually look for patterns and these guys have the consistency. Best sandwich?........ the Philly Cheese with chipotle sauce on it....

The meats are sliced to order and bread fresh baked. We ordered two club sandwiches it came with turkey ham and bacon with provolone cheese. I believe they had a few different choices of bread  but We choose white bread  and omitted a few condiments and a personal favorite of mine is shredded lettuce i don't know why but shredded lettuce is just better. The portion size of the sandwiches are huge fair warning lol I couldn't finish the medium one. 

I loved every single bite. 

The staff was quick and very friendly. This location was super clean and had plenty of seats to dine in. I'm looking forward to our next visit for sure!",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,3,1,4,5t8wNpkgjYYKwP_J_Gy4tA

3129896,2015-12-21,2,HkAj0bamytrhj8FQM5I-zw,"TWO STARS FOR TOO EXPENSIVE!

I came here hungry and left broke and still hungry!

I only ordered a (7"") Regular Sub Sandwich a Bag of Chips and a Regular Size Drink and it cost me over $13.00 WOW!  They don't even give you a FOOTLONG sandwich here. What's up with that?
Your choices are 7"" or 15"" in length ONLY!
Keep in mind, this is considered a fast food restaurant, at these prices I could have went to a sit down restaurant chain and have got much more food for my money at a better price.

The sandwich was very good, but good and small, not even a FOOTLONG, like Subway. A Reg. Sub here is only 7"" in length, average price between $7.45-$7.95 and a Giant Sub, is about $12.95 about 15"" in length. They made my sandwich, rang me up and then gave my sandwich to the guy ahead of me who got his To-Go, they then asked me what I ordered and had to remake my sandwich over again. SMH... Needless to say a costly dinner, and I still left hungry. I guess this is why I always end up at Subway if I want a fresh FOOTLONG Sub Sandwich for about $6 Bucks!

4723618,2016-05-14,0,HkAj0bamytrhj8FQM5I-zw,"A few weeks ago (Mid April-ish), my boyfriend and I tried to go here with about 30-45 mins left before they closed and the open sign was off and they were cleaning. We figured they didn't want service if they had their sign off. Also figured people who do that usually give horrible service. We picked somewhere else to go that night.

Tonight (Friday, May 13 at 8:00pm), with 1 hour left to be open, my boyfriend and I wanted Jersey Mikes but we already knew that this location was weird about people coming ""late"" so we were hesitant. 
We got there and there were quite a few people in line. We had to maze walk through all the people ordering their food because they had the whole store blocked off because I was assuming they were cleaning. Ordering the sandwiches and paying was great. I got a free Giant sub because I eat at Jersey Mikes so often that I racked up enough points to get a free one. The girl who made my sandwich and rung us up was the best out of the three employees that night. We were eating there because my boyfriend had to go back to work. 
Since they had literally the whole store blocked off except the two tables by the door, I moved a chair that was blocking the walkway to go sit in the ""restricted"" zone because someone else was sitting at the other table. Another couple did this also right after us because why would we sit all right next to each other when there is a whole restaurant available?
I'm sitting down eating for about 3 minutes and I can hear one of the male employees say ""Do they not understand that when something is blocked off, you don't go through it"" or something along those lines. He then said ""Now I swept and mopped for nothing"". He only had two tables to clean after we left because of the other couple as well. 
My table was the closest to the crowd control rope thing (about 5 feet). That employee then came over and picked up the rope stand and set it down right next to my boyfriend so we can't cross into that section (which I don't know why we would have). As soon as he set it down, he shook his head at me and was continuing to shake his head all the way to the back room. I was fine with the complaining about us initially being in that section but the head shaking took it too far. It was just rude. 
The whole rest of the time there, he was still complaining to his employees about it. It's one thing to say something like that to your coworkers but for your customers to hear you saying stuff is inappropriate. (I was actually fired from my job as a teenager for doing things like that so I learned my lesson.)

I really love you Jersey Mikes but you need to get your employees in check here. I will be driving to another location where I know they give better service.",NB-8ugr8dEcF6XFDQWk-pQ,1,0,2,AlZFMbNe91jfUseK1mYIyw
