I couldn't wait to get my nails finished so that I could grab a sub to take home. Upon entry the great music hit my ears & I bobbed my head to the beat. The man behind the counter greeted me with a 'hey girl!' & I'm immediately offended. When I do business ANYWHERE I expect to be addressed in a more professional manner. I corrected the man by telling him I'm not 'girl' I'm 'ma'am' to which he became visably annoyed.  He immediately started with the silent treatment & even put my change on the counter instead of in my hand. RUDE. CHILDISH.

I ordered the Vito & asked for it minus the onions. The young lady who made the sandwich began to hand the sandwich to me & then pulled it back saying she needed to make it over. Since I was in a hurry to end this unpleasant encounter, I asked what the problem was & she said she had mistakenly put onions on it. I took the sandwich & told her that I would pick them off. Little did I know that the sandwich was MOSTLY onion, very little meat, no cheese, & no dressing making for a very dry & smelly lunch.

Before leaving the store, I asked if there was a phone number of a manager or owner. She told me that the unprofessional man who addressed me as 'girl' was the manager. How very sad that he is the example that people who work there follow, as he seems to think that being 'cool' is more important than securing repeat business by being professional & getting orders right.

I won't be back for more disrespect & dry bread & onion sandwiches no matter how convenient it is.

It's not like other chains where you go down the line and pick your toppings, so I think that helps with the speediness of receiving your order. I had a hard time finding this place because the store front does not face the parking lot so be advised of this. 

When I finally made it in, I was quickly greeted by a friendly cashier who proceeded to take my order. I told her I wanted the Gargantuan sandwich and then made it a combo by adding a drink. Jimmy John's gives you your choice of a cookie, chips or a drink to make your meal into a combo. By the time I was done paying, my sandwich was already ready. Talk about fast service! The Gargantuan is a HUGE sandwich, hence the name. They take their homemade french bun and pile it high with genoa salami, smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese. Then they add lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo and Italian dressing. I found my sandwich to be a bit dry. They need to add more mayo and more dressing, especially on a large sandwich that has so many items. The sandwich is super filling and I almost packaged up half of it for later, but I decided to go full glutton and eat the whole thing. Oh yes I did.

I waited for about 5-10 minutes, went back inside asked if it was ready just to find out she wasn't even making my unwich but she was making other customers sandwiches that came after me. At that time I asked for a refund, as soon as I asked she pushed the sandwich that she was making rolled her eyes and said what? To me with an attitude.

If you're considering working at a Jimmy John's sandwich shop, you may want to read the fine print on your job application.A Jimmy John's employment agreement includes a ""non-competition"" clause. Non-compete agreements are typically reserved for managers or employees. but at Jimmy John's, the agreement apparently applies to low-wage sandwich makers and delivery drivers, too.

By signing the covenant, the worker agrees not to work at one of the sandwich chain's competitors for a period of two years following employment at Jimmy John's.

I guess my only issue with this particular location is the service. While not horrible, it certainly isn't spectacular either. After receiving lackluster service on my first visit I made it a point to not review this place until I had made at least a few visits. It seems to be pretty consistent. Maybe the bar was set high by the crew on the Windmill and Eastern location I used to frequent, but they always seem to be in a bit of a blah mood here. 

I'm sure I'll end up by here now and again, but I think maybe it's time to branch out and check out some other sub shops in the area.

As for now, this Jimmy John's is A-OK.

I really like the bread they use...dare I say better than Cap's bread?  Yep, I said it.  I had the Club Tuna, #15 to be exact, and the quality was really good with all of the vegetables being fresh.  The only thing I'd prefer is that the tuna had a bit more flavor...some simple relish would suffice.  Also the drink offerings were not my style...I don't drink soda.  How about some fresh brewed ice-tea like everyone else has?

Service was good all around and the place was clean.  The restroom even had soap in the soap dispenser!  One confusing thing to me which I suppose could be a problem on a busy day is when the sandwich is done they just call out its number (i.e. ""Number 15"")...what happens on a busy day when maybe 3 people have the same order?  A brawl could ensue!

All in all it was a good place to grab a quick lunch since I was in the area.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to get here but if and when I'm driving by during lunch I will definitely stop back in to try another sandwich.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,2,1,4,d1S-g43XOGQKF9piXpcu3Q

Firstly, it's a Jimmy Johns, so the sandwiches are solid. But this is an abnormally good Jimmy Johns. Several reasons:

1) The Staff. Today they recognized that I didn't have my son with me like I usually do. They're friendly, but not ""corporate drone"" friendly. This is good customer service. Also the staff appears relatively happy, which is important for quality food. Also this visit: the guy who made my sandwich (in like 90 seconds) said ""I made this the 'wrong' way so it doesn't fall apart when you eat it."" He was right. The sandwich was superb (Italian night club with pep).

2) Mayonnaise. Present in every Jimmy Johns but bears repeating.

3) One time I went in here they were blaring Heavy Metal and I heard that terrible ""F"" word like seven times. I'm a married banker with a kid, and I don't particularly like Metal, but it's nice to have that ""privately owned"" feel.

4) This place is never busy. And you wouldn't wait long anyways, since this place has handed me my sandwich in the amount of time it took to process my debit card, but still, it's awesome.

5) Want to save calories? Not be a giant fat-ass? Well no one does the lettuce wrap like Jimmie Johns. Extra Mayo Unwich for the win. 

The bad:
A lot of the time they just hand you the sandwich if you just get one, and then you forget to grab napkins, and the mayo and pepper juices mix and drips out the back of the Sammich on your pants, but that's your fault. Take some personal responsibility. Also they have sprouts on the menu. They taste like you're licking a tree trunk covered in moss, but I know people who think they're exquisite.

LONG DETAILED VERSION:
The sandwiches were fine from what I was told (I didn't eat anything from here), the staff however were extremely unprofessional. That alone is enough to give this review. 
Upon walking in the guy at the register standing closest to us acknowledged us coming in (group of 5) but kept his back towards us and continued his conversation with the other employees, one of the other men then asked us (mind you not in a polite tone) ""does anyone know what they want?""   
We hesitantly placed our order, we were given back the wrong change, he handed us back $8 out of $10, we told him he gave us too much back, instead of saying thank you he argued that he counted it back correctly and didn't give us too much back, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE ARGUE THAT YOU OVERPAID US? Anyways, sandwiches were ready quickly,after opening the sandwiches we realized one wasn't correct, we asked for no tomatoes, handed it back and gave us the correct sandwich. The issue here is, the gentleman who was behind us ordered that sandwich with tomatoes, and the sandwich we TOUCHED and opened up with our hands was given to him! 
All while this is going on, the business card/ gift card holder has been knocked off the counter the cashier just looked and the customer like he should pick it up because it fell in his side even though the cashier had knocked it down. I mean the whole place is a joke. We will never return to this location. It's a bunch of incompetent immature assholes who treat paying customers as an inconvenience.",NnQnunmIR6VDlrefrwIVmQ,0,0,1,bQJuNoCUYeBAtK3erxx8LQ

Sometimes, your fella is super indecisive about what he wants for dinner, and mentions 4 different places.
Sometimes, you decide on a place, and are heading that way, and a brilliant idea pops into your head:  ""Hey...Jimmy John's is over there too...""

And sometimes, your fella says things like ""Why you gotta know exactly what I wanted?  Jimmy John's it is!""

I had been to this location once a year or so ago, and used to have Jimmy's deliver at work for a while, but its been a really long time since I've had it.

This location is small, but very clean, and the staff are great.  Quick, polite, and they even asked my fella what happened to his hand (sprained it 2 weeks ago) and wished him a quick recovery.  

The sandwiches were great. 
I had the #14: The Bootlegger.  This is roast beef, turkey, lettuce, mayo, and tomato, although I always get mine with no tomato, with cheese and oregano.  
It was delicious.  The roast beef was really good.  I'd have liked a touch more mayo, as it was just a tiny bit dry, but all in all in was great.

Fella got the Gargantuan, which is just an enormous, meaty pile of deliciousness.  He loved it, and wanted to keep eating, but ran out of food.

This location also delivers, which is good to know, for the days that I don't want to leave my fireplace.  I will definitely be eating here again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,1,4,EVR4_qkAxxkF2YMgR9plSQ

I've had two subs here - the Vito (Italian sub topped with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & Italian vinaigrette) and the Totally Tuna. Both sandwiches feature above-average toppings including vegetables that smell and taste fresh, not like the typical bagged produce flavor that defines places like Subway.

The bread is noteworthy - it's hard and crusty on the outside but with a nice soft crumb inside. It's similar to the bread used at Jersey Mike's, only without the corn meal dusting.

Best of all, a filling 8"" sub (yes, I just typed those words) is only $4.75.

If they make freaky good food, freaky fast... could they make 35 lunches in a freaky fast time?

Why yes, yes they could! We placed our order on line, which went very smoothly, and indicated our desired pick up time a couple hours ahead of time. 

I went to pick up the food and as I walked in the door, they were literally wrapping up the last box lunch and packing the 4th box of sandwiches up. After paying the staff was very gracious to help carry everything out to the car with me.

That's what the cashier said to me when I walked in. I gave him a half smile as I really thought about what he said and then placed my order. 

Ordered a #9 and #10 combos, a good solid Italian and roast beef sandwich respectively.

Service speed hasn't changed much. It is still as fast and speedy as ever. My sandwich's are always done before I can even fill up both of my drinks. 

I bag up the sandwiches, chips and put my drinks in the carrier and walk out. As I started to open the door, the same cashier told me to ""Have a great day"" and gave me a smile. 

I really started to think about what he said when I first walked in there. ""Welcome to the best part of your day.""

He didn't know I was having a crappy day. That I was at work since 4:30 in the morning, finally getting a break from work at 1 pm even if it was just to drive a pick my president up a sandwich. He didn't know that I was stuck in a 4 hour meeting today. Nor did he know the handful of new policies I had to write and implement once I got back to work.

I drove back to work thinking, that man was ALMOST right. The best part of my day is always coming home to my hunny and son but other than that, it was a good part of my day. 

I am not trying to be too personal but I just need to relate a little and make you feel how important customer service truly is (at least to me). As stated in my previous review about Jimmy Johns, they have a good solid sub. Love their pickles and cookies even more. You can't go wrong with their food. 

However, this location had lacked in the customer service department. And in a business where customer service is YOUR business, it is a very important detail. And during my last couple of visits, the service has been better but not great but after today, I just had to do an update and upgrade them to a 4.
