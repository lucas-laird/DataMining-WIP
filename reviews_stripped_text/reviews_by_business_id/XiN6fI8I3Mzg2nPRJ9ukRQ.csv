The decor and configuration of Prosecco invited us in, BRIGHT, COLORFUL, WELL LAYED OUT!.  We decided to have a late lunch/early dinner.  What a great decision.  The menu was impressive to read.  The food was fantastic to eat.  I ordered the Cappelini Pomodoro and my Lady ordered the Enslata Prosecco and we split the meals.  WOW, WOW, WOW!  The Cappelini was spectacular and the salad was fresh and delicious with lots of colors and flavors, just like the decor of Prosecco.  We sinned a bit at the end with a Cannoli for desert and that too was wonderful.  My Lady is 100% Italian and she was so happy with our experience at Prosecco.

Did not help with the menu and apparently didn't know how to smile or even pretend to be happy. The food was pretty good. I think it's the ruby salad the we really enjoyed. The pasta was great. The 3rd time we shared the ribeye of the menu. It was cooked perfect and seasoned well but the quality of steak was terrible. A step above a steak you would get from a bar when ordering steak and eggs. It was 38 $  they need to take off the menu. Terrible. The first time went I got the 8 oz shrimp special. The shrimp was over cooked.  I'll go back again with hi hopes that they are improving.,kF-MShn_2Qtta2EAaVARuw,0,0,3,1jEt9jwi_FPTSiJn30QSKg

My family and I walked in, literately, around 6pm for a quick dinner to this new restaurant we were eyeing.  We were expecting a cafe style restaurant and were pleasantly surprised at the elegant and inviting decor and atmosphere. The waiters were professional and the service overall was great. Now to the food.... AMAZING! Authentic and delicious! We ordered the lentil soup which was the soup of the day, so good! We ordered the heirloom caprese salad, so good! The margerita pizza was yummy, the house bread and oil was delicious. As an entree we had the shrimp paprika - to say it was delicious is an understatement. Each bite was mouthwatering. For dessert we had the gelato and shared it, also delicious. Coffee was good too! 
We went with our four year old daughter and while we felt welcomed to dine as a family, we would likely opt to eat there for an adult night/date night in the future and maybe have a few glasses of wine with our meal. Great place to have dinner with friends or for a date night. Also great if you just want a meal guaranteed to hit the spot. When we arrived it was quiet, however, within minutes the place was full and you could hear laughter and great conversations happening. One of the owners even walked around with a smile on his face greeting everyone. It can't wait to go back again and again.  The prices seemed high when looking at the menu, but the food was quality and it was worth the price. Hard to find places like this that feel authentic and satisfy!

SPECTACULAR.

Ambience:  inviting, modern, hip, non-pretentious.  Best use of orange I've ever seen.
Attire:  consider dressing casual with a bit more effort    :-)
Menu:  much enticing variety.
Food quality:  casual gourmet, noticeably fine ingredients.
Food prices:  Very Fair.  Pasta entrée $12.  Big soup $7.  Coke $3.
Presentation:  Artistic, classy.  Probably the best you'll get in zip code 89123.

Service:  MUCH better than most LV restaurants.  Hostess - classy, warm welcome.  Server Juan Carlos gracious, professional, impeccable level of service.  The Chef personally presented our entrees, including a magnificent ravioli truffle special-of-the-day.  Juan Carlos and his assistant kept our drinks full, anticipated our every need, made appropriate menu suggestions.  Thank you for a WONDERFUL spontaneous dining experience.

My sister and I enthusiastically tipped 25% on this lunch.

The owner's attention to detail and quality is so important to him that the restaurant's business cards have his personal cell number on it.  I called owner Giuseppe moments ago to congratulate him on his marvelous dining offering, and he answered the call after two rings!  (He was mixing drinks at the time and was delighted that I called.)  And then he called me back five minutes later to add more information to the answer I was seeking.  How's THAT for entrepreneurial excellence!

I recommend Prosecco Italian cuisine for a bright and cheerful lunch with your sister, for a romantic afternoon or evening dinner date (with someone other than your sister), for a business lunch, or for any well-deserved meal in a casual setting but with first class service above and beyond what we Nevadans usually get at other equally respectable restaurants.

My next visit to Prosecco will be a date night.  I'll catch a 7pm movie next door and then go for a later dinner seating.  Caveat -- although the dining room stays open later, last call to place a dinner order is 10pm.

As of today (Oct 3) their website is not up yet.  But for questions, just call them.  Again, they're very gracious.

A very refreshing lunch or dinner experience.  They're newly opened.  Try it now while you can get a good seat -- it's a matter of time before their reputation makes them the new hot spot in the area.

Thank you for a superb lunch.

There were 3 of us for dinner. When we walked in, we were asked if we had a reservation. We did not and didn't think we needed one. The restaurant was less than half full. We were seated and no one came to greet us for at least 10 minutes. Finally ""someone"" came over and asked if we wanted drinks. I say ""someone"" because we were never told his name. It took a while to get a coke, iced tea and a water. At this point it started to get busier so we ordered. We had the calamari appetizer. It was good. Our meals included lasagna, eggplant parm & canneloni. Decent sized plates except for the lasagna. It was not thick and was more flat and long.  The taste of the food was decent. Prices were a bit higher than average. 

I paid great attention to the details and the surroundings. As the place filled up, 2 men walked around introducing themselves and spending time with each table full of guests. No one came to our table. We had to ask for refills on the water and eventually the other drinks.  It is a cramped setting. Too many tables inside along the front area. Perhaps the tables (for 2) along the windows shouldn't be there. The guests had trouble getting through the table area and the servers certainly had difficulties as well. We had approximately 1 foot between our table and the one next to us - I felt like I was on their date with them.

My girlfriend and I live just right down the road from here and we have been waiting forever for this gem to open. We went on a Thursday night and had such a great experience there, the chef absolutely knows what he is doing and the front of house staff are very knowledgeable. If you are looking for authentic Italian food then this is the spot, we started our meal off with a Caesar salad and calamari. The calamari was excellent, great breading which was very light and seasoned just right. My girlfriend is a huge Caesar fan and gets this salad almost everywhere we go, she said this was one of the best dressings and I totally agree with her. For our entree's I had the Ribeye medium rare, the steak was cooked to perfection and was much better than any other strip steakhouses in my opinion, just salt and pepper seasoned so you are actually tasting the great quality of the beef. My girlfriend had the Linguine Mediterania under dry pasta's, they sure do not short you on seafood with this dish. Her scallops in the pasta could not of been cooked any better, they were like butter! Nico one of the owners was a very nice gentleman who made sure he stopped by every table to ask how things were and to tell a little bit about the restaurant which was very nice. Overall this was a great experience and we will most definitely come back. Next time I am going to try the pizza from their woodfire oven!

The pasta dishes I recommend are their raviolis and their pasta in the cheese wheel. The cheese ravioli is my favorite dish here because the sauce is made to perfection. The cheese wheel is not only a delicious dish, but is also comes with a table-side presentation where they mix the pasta in front of you.

DRINKS: They have an interest bar with a wide wine and cocktail selection. I highly recommend the Southside, it is my favorite drink here. The bartender is really great at making the drinks to you liking and will fix any drink if it doesn't come out how you want it.

SERVICE: The waiters here are very friendly. I am most shocked that they are very knowledgeable about the dishes. The waiters are able to tell you how the dishes are prepared, what dishes would be best for your liking, and they are even able to bring out the dishes and serve them properly. I had a fish dish and the waiter deboned the fish as well as split the serving without the customer having to ask. The manager and chef even came out to my table to introduce themselves and make sure everything tasted good.

ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is beautiful. They bring out candles, bring up the blinds when the sun is setting, and have a gentleman playing the guitar and singing to set the mood for the restaurant.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,12,11,5,_qnlucwfr49e9HDAEwT0EQ

Coming from a super authentic Italian family of chefs, I'm really critical of Italian food but this place was one of the better Italian restaurants I've had in the valley. We tried the spinach salad, minestrone, and tiramisu and it was all perfect. They even included a little bundle of bread and dip, which was a great touch!

1057718,2017-03-05,6,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"We just finished dinner there no less than 20 minutes ago and to be honest we were very disappointed. We were dining with our my mother in law who was turning 69 today and we explained as such to the beautiful hostess.  But there was mention throughout the evening by any staff member of the special occasion, nor at dessert which is fairly commonplace.

 To further add insult to injury, we arrived for an 8pm reservation  of 4 at 7:56 but weren't seated until 8:19.  I get that there are some uncontrollable aspects with multiple other parties not clearing their table as expected, but no offset was ever offered.  No compliementary cocktail, no appetizer compliementary of the chef, no apology whatsoever.

Overall the food was very mediocre at best. The bread was delicious and the large portion of herbal dipping oil appeared fantastic, but the reality is the oil was it was seriously lacking any seasoning and tasted more like grass/herbs than a typical higher-end dipping oil for the price points in this restaurant.  We ordered the special octopus, which was a huge portion but terribly under seasoned and nothing compared to the top octopus in the city at Milos at Cosmopolitan.  It was effectively chargrilled with no seasoning at all.  It was she first time I have ever had to salt octopus.  We ordered the sausage entree which was fairly spicy and fringe undercooked which hopefully does not come back to haunt us tonight.   We ordered two pasta dishes of which one was a B and the other C-.  Both were heavy on the pasta and light on the ancillary components that sold the dish: the meat, cheese, and veggies.  Finally we had the ""people's favorite"" pizza with artichoke and prosciutto which was okay.  It was a white pizza which the menu didn't describe, but the waitress happily brought a huge portion of marinara when requested to supplement.  

Overall we were just sorely disappointed as first time guests for an avg check of $26 per person before alcohol.  With so many delicious Italian options on Eastern, I don't see any of us ever coming back to Prosecco.",VbUUJb0EFNSVn_qPnIwC_w,1,0,1,Kekq78B1RUdKR7-mOB35fw

It was in many ways. The décor is a fresh, clean and bright feeling, much more up to date than the old red and white, typically dark Italian restaurant. The food tasted very good. My husband had Caprese which was a step above the norm. I had the quinoa and hazelnut salad which was very nicely underdressed and had good flavor. The dipping oil for the bread did not have the taste of the herbs in it, and might have been better with some garlic or balsamic in it. The bread itself was very good. My husband had linguine with clams and loved it. I had a ravioli with gorgonzola and asparagus creamy sauce. The flavors in mine could have been more pronounced and the homemade pasta was undercooked. For dessert we shared a custard with strawberry coulis. It was not too sweet and a nice way to finish off with something light. 
The service could have been friendlier, such as giving us their name and pointing out the special and fundraiser. Also, the I initial contact and bread were slow in coming. Water filling was prompt. Food service was prompt. Service overall had a hesitant feel, so perhaps this can be attributed to their being open only one week. One if the owners came and spoke to us, which was very nice.

Looking forward to a nice dinner with friends, we were all anxious to experience a new place.  An experience it was.  The service wasn't quite what I expected.  We didn't have a definitive waiter.  Many gentlemen stopped at our table during the evening.  It was unsettling when we had to repeat our order at the end of the evening because he didn't know who ordered which entree.  It was also unsettling when I ask one waiter if they offer Moscato and he says yes.  A different gentlemen comes back with Riesling telling me it's the same and they don't have Moscato.  I reluctantly took the Riesling but the magic act was unnecessary.  

For my meal I started with the Caesar Salad.  It was a very large portion I which I could share with my husband.  Great flavor with freshly shaved Parmesan was delicious.  

I also opted for the Stuffed Salmon.  Well, you could probably just name it salmon because there was very very little crab stuffing.  The fish was also over cooked. It was not a dish I would recommend.

Today we were looking for a place to go for Sunday brunch. Several breakfast/lunch only places have opened in the area. While most of them are OK, none really distinguish themselves. It was a beautiful Autumnal morning, soI thought I would try Proseco because they have an nice outdoor patio area that is nicely separated from the parking lot. Made a reservation which they honored. To our very pleasant surprise, they had an outstanding jazz sax player on the patio. Really nice touch!!! The brunch menu has a good assortment of omelets and other standard brunch items as well as a couple of more traditional Italian offerings. I went with the Ocean View omelet.

There is seating indoor and out. It would be nice to sit outside in the fall/spring when the weather is nice. 

Dinner begins at 3pm so we didn't qualify to order off the lunch menu. First bread was brought out. It was so crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, so good! The ravioli with the truffle sauce was the best, chunks of truffle in every bite. If you love truffle, this dish is for you. The scampi paprika had some very large shrimp and was also a great dish! 

The kids pizza and fries is quite large, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have 2-4 kids to share it. The fries come on top of the pizza. It's a wood fired pizza and very thin crust. 

For dessert we had the chocolate gelato. Also, large portion. But so delicious, tasted just like the gelato in Rome. The espresso was perfectly made as well.

1999782,2016-10-06,0,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"I've tried this restaurant twice now, and the first time it was decent, but the 2nd time around I'm not so impressed.
The location is nice, with pleasant décor and outdoor seating.  The tables and chairs outside are a bit cheap in quality, as they are wrapped in a plastic wicker cover, and they've decided to place an untethered seat cushion on each seat.  This arrangements is a bit frustrating on two levels, the seat cushions easily slide off and/or move so you have to be annoyingly cognizant of what you're sitting on, and, the plastic wicker table obviously has holes in it, so be careful not to spill anything as it will drip through and on to your pants/skirt/legs. 
The Staff was courteous and friendly each visit and pleasantly accommodating.
The reason I gave the review two stars is for both quality of the food and for lack of concern when the problem was pointed out. 
We ordered the mixed cold cuts and cheese appetizer for two, which I would have expected generous portions provided since the appetizer was $30.
Instead we got paper thin 4 slices of Mortadella (Italian bologna), 5-6 small slices of Prosciutto, and 4 slices of salami (ea. paper thin and the size of 50 cent piece).  There were 4 small cubes of cheese (unknown kind because the waiter didn't bother explaining what's on the plate), a dollop some marinated green peppers, a dollop of some marinated mushrooms, one small artichoke cut in half, and 5-6 Kalamata olives.  There's no way you convince me that was a $30 appetizer. I've had much better at other restaurants for half the price. (So I would recommend avoiding that at all costs)
The quality problem was actually with that very same appetizer.  Parts of the Mortadella were dried out and had the consistency of a potato chip.  There's only one way that could happen, and that is the meat had been previously sliced and not stored properly, as the meat dried out and hardened. 
When I pointed this problem out to the waiter, he said he would let the chef know about it. 
Sadly, 10 minutes later the waiter came back as though nothing had transpired, and asked ""So, how was the appetizer?""  
Needless to say, neither the waiter, the chef, or management ever came by to address the problem with the meat.  I guess I was just expected to eat it and pay for it, regardless of how it was mishandled.
The other issue I had with the dinner that evening was the timing.  After we got the appetizer, it literally took 35 minutes for the entrée (pasta dishes) to arrive. So about 10 minutes to get through the appetizer and 25 minutes of waiting for the next plate.
At the end of the dinner, as we were leaving, the waiter checked with us and said ""I hope everything was good"" and I replied ""everything except for the appetizer"" and his response was ""Yea, sorry about that.""   Well, I'm sorry too, but my sorry is that I'm not going to be spending any more money there anytime soon.
Overall, nice place, but needs some significant fine tuning.",aB0-26qIFZ-eBmb7AwJdYg,2,0,2,xdRx3guHqArpov9qmgVn3w

2077075,2016-09-03,2,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"We were anxiously awaiting this restaurant to open where Gabriellas used to be. 

The food-4 out of 5 stars. The owner is from Sicily and the chef is from Venice. So I guess we can call it Italian fusion if fusion can be used as a replacement for over priced. Sauces are very good but for what you get it is not worth the price. The over priced food can possibly be the downfall of this place because I do not see many return visits for that reason.

Service-3 out of 5 stars. Our waiter was eager to please but had zero knowledge of what was available from the bar and I had to get up and walk to the bar to see what beers were available on tap.

Ambience-1 or 2 out of 5. Far from a quiet or possibly romantic place for a quiet dinner. High ceilings and kind of loud.
I normally like and get a good feeling when the owner is present,this place the exception. The owner Nico interrupted our dinner conversation twice and he comes off as a bit of an arrogant prick in skinny jeans. When he talks to you it feels like he is talking down to you and I don't think the employees respect him but they are certainly afraid of him which makes for a very uptight feeling amongst the staff. I think he would be better served staying in the kitchen and keeping things running smoothly from there and find a nicer restaurant rep for out front.

Ambiance
Mod/European interior with a mix of industrial exposed ceilings and fancier touches like crystal chandeliers and modular art. A mixture of tables, semi-private booths, and more private booths.  Feels expansive and open yet intimate and warm.  

Service
We were seated quickly and then waited some time for service although servers came to check on us.  Most likely a factor of needing to fine tune team work. One of the owners (the same one who'd seated us) passed by and asked if anyone had helped us and took our drink orders. Later someone else (I think the other owners) told us about the specials. We then placed our orders.  The appetizer came quickly, but the food took a little longer. The guests at the next table looked over at us and asked if we had our food yet as they hadn't received theirs either. I am guessing that there may have been a miscommunication in the kitchen.  We received our food shortly after.  The owners made multiple attempts to turn the evening around as they sensed there was disappointment among the guests regarding bringing out the food.  He offered us free prosecco on the house and a free crème brulee.   I believe that intentions of the owners was for us to have a superb experience and I truly appreciate that.  All of the evening could have been smoother with just more communication among staff.  Sometimes it is not about being ""perfect"" with regards to businesses, rather to do anything to show that you appreciate the business of your patrons.  Having been a part of opening a restaurant before, I know there are small kinks here and there.  This place has a good start and plenty of potential.

Food
1) Cocktails: Well flavored and balanced.  Spritzletini was one of the drinks and I loved the presentation and flavors.  Nice combination of fruity and aromatic.  
2) Appetizer Bruschetta: nice balance of fresh-fresh tomatoes and herbs.  Crusty Bread.  Also the bread basket with tapenade was amazing!!!  They refilled it for us without asking and I'm glad they did!
3) Caesar Salad: nice of the staff to split it into two bowls, going that extra mile.
4) Shrimp and Lemon chicken entrées: Shrimp was jumbo and plump, juicy and sweet.  Sauce tasted really good.  Medium sized helping of pasta.  Sauce slightly on the saltier side, roll out those margaritas....oh....wrong place :)  Lemon chicken hearty with lots of vegetables.  
5) Crème Brulee: on the house - beautiful rustic chic presentation with meringue cookie.  Nice touch!

Mojo
1) Go for the ambiance, a nice place to spend the evening and catch up with friends (new and old).  Take a leisurely time and have dinner like they do in Europe: a night of conversation and finishing with cappuccino...and/or fruit/chocolates.
2) Get the cocktails, ask for the dessert menu.",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,3,1,4,1MGI4H0k6N2igDPhEZed9A

Took my girlfriend and her mother here (had to make a good impression).First, we were greeted by the hostess and the owner right away. Was seated in front of the kitchen so we could our food being prepped and all the handmade pasta being created. Already amazing. The server was very friendly and prompt. Introduced himself, memorized all the specials, and made some great recommendations. After snacking on the homemade bread or food was ready in an instant. You can taste the love that was put into the food like it was your own mother! Every bite was better than the last. While enjoying, the owner stopped by to check on us and made sure everything was going well. To end the night, we had Crema Bruciata (highly recommended) and Limoncello to finish it off. Everything was very reasonably priced for what you are getting. On our way out the owner thanked us for our business and hoped to see us again. Well my friend, you will. 

If you are looking for a great Italian kitchen, look no further. This place is relatively new, but seems like they've been doing this for years. A+ service, food, and atmosphere!",RqxK1RJW8t5Hn2oQuCx6KA,0,1,5,ZgZjT4EehZ9zxz5tmSLZUQ

Service was outstanding!  I ordered the Spaghetti and meatballs and my wife, the salmon.  Both came with as side salad.  My spaghetti wasn't as sweet as my homemade sauce but that's not unusual.  My wife enjoyed her salmon and brought the leftovers home.  Lunch did take a little time to arrive but that gave us time to enjoy our appetizer (a daily special) and salad.

The food, however, is the best part.  I've lived in Vegas for 6 years now and been to so many great Italian places, but none this good (including i Mulino, carbone... etc). Prosecco has the best meatballs I've ever had and every entree/side I've ever gotten has been 5 stars.

We were seated immediately and our server or servers (we definitely had more than one) came over timely to take our drink order. The place wasn't crowded but there was definitely a steady crowd for a Thursday night. While my boyfriend had wine I opted for just water so I can't speak on their wine selection but from what I saw they have a book full of different red and white wines. I ordered the Caesar salad and my boyfriend ordered the minestrone soup. Both were absolutely delicious. The salad is big enough for 2. I couldn't finish it by myself so we ended up sharing it. They brought out bread with some type of olive oil dressing/spread. Whatever it was, it was good. When I asked for vinegar as well our server kind of looked at me dumbfounded for a second and then brought out vinegar but with no saucer bowl. Idk maybe that's an east coast thing, olive oil and vinegar with bread. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was absolutely superb. The sauce was simple and delicate yet flavorful and the meatballs were big but not too thick whereas they end up dry in the middle. The meatballs were delicious down to every bite. Towards the end of our meal a gentleman who seemed to me as though he was the owner came by our table to check on us and ask about our meal which we raved about.

I had the Cannelloni Gratinati it was ok but not for the price. It says on the yelp menu $14.00 it's actually $16.00 once you get there. Please change the prices on here :/. Also surprising is that with these price you don't get a side salad? My sister had the lasagna and my mom the eggplant both were ok but again not for the price. I could see having these prices if your on the strip but your not. I probably won't visit again there's too many other Italian restaurants in town with better prices and better food.

3157308,2017-03-30,0,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"SUMMARY: If possible, I'd rate 4.5. The food is very, very good---but portions quite small, and delivery charge is high at $6.

Overall, $40 spendy for 4 pieces of ravioli, 3 ping-pong-sized meatballs, and a piece of tiramisu size of a *small* square drink coaster.

DETAILS: Stumbled upon Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen on a night when there was no food in the house and decided to order out. It is too expensive to do this very often, but it was incredibly delicious, fresh, and thoughtfully and expertly prepared.

My Order:  Agnolotti di Zucca (""Moon-shaped pasta with butternut squash and ricotta cheese sautéed in a light butter sage sauce"") -- very modest portion, but exceptionally good -- hand-crafted pasta, like a ravioli, the sauce was just as described, perfectly seasoned, and accented with a jot of fried sage. 

Ordered a side of meatballs, which was fortunate, because the portion of the entree would have been insufficient a meal -- with the 3 meatballs, it was perfection! The meatballs were scrumptious, served in its own little container with a flavorful marinara sauce, with a little bit of accenting cheese over the top, and bits of fresh basil. They mischarged me for thee meatballs at $6.00---I later learned their standard charge for THREE MEATBALLS (which, again, are ping-pong-ball-sized) is $18.

The meal also came with wonderful, fresh, bread--and an herbed dipping oil. Complex, subtle, and delicious.

One review said that this very oil ""needed seasoning,"" by which I'm guessing they meant salt.  

However, one of the *best* parts of this restaurant--unlike most of the quite pedestrian restaurants you can order from in this region---htheir restraint in ""seasoning"" (meaning: salt) throughout the entire meal was a relief, and let you actually taste thee natural flavors--not just a salt bomb.

For desert I tried tiramisu--which was wonderful, and in keeping with the thoughtful ""seasoning"" of the savory dishes, it was not overly sweet. Most places in the Las Vegas Valley, I ave found, smash you over the head with sugar. This didn't.  My first impression was the tiramisu was on the teeny tiny side. However: like everything else, it was of the very highest quality, and in factm among the best tiramisu I've had, with slim slices of homemade, ever-so-slightly sweet cocoa/chocolate ""bark"" perched on top in addition to the traditional nice bitter cocoa dusting of tiramsu. The cream/custard was sublime. And there was a wee dollop of chantilly cream to the side, along with a spriglette of mint. The only misfire of the whole meal was a 1/2 maraschino cherry in the cream. At first I thought it was a raspberry, which would have been nice, but a maraschino cherry? An ironic wink, perhaps? But unnecessary.

The meal before tax and delivery-tip was $28---for one smallish but delectable entree plus 3 very modest-sized meatballs.   The delivery fee of $6 seemed high.  All told, it was $40 with tax and delivery and tip.

This quality of restaurant--the elevated taste--is rare near Henderson.  Most places that deliver, particularly, tend toward mediocre, run-of-the-mill, and/or chains.  Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen is unique, smart, creative, and could hold its own, and be popular, in any major city with an educated clientele with high expectations and discerning palates. But for me, given the price, a once-in-a-while splurge!",ZBPW5RoxD7eFE5OwVYlegQ,1,1,4,zzeIMqLJvNNMluyQmZPk0A

3273270,2017-08-22,1,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"I will preface this review with the fact that I am Italian and I am from Long Island, N.Y (roll your eyes, but the fact remains I know great authentic Italian food)..

Ordered delivery from this establishment this evening via EAT24. I have been dying to try it.. as authentic Italian cuisine is obviously up my alley, especially on days when I don't feel like cooking. Ordered a margherita pizza, calamari, and tiramisu. I figured the old standbys should give me a sense of quality with this place.

Delivery was 20 minutes earlier than the EAT24 app estimated. Great!  Everything should be hot then. Wrong!  Pizza and calamari were stone cold. Tiramisu was so-so.

I'm half dressed (Hello! Hence delivery), so I couldn't really run after the delivery guy.  I immediately put the tiramisu in the fridge and heat my oven to 500 degrees, in hopes of saving the pizza. While the oven was going, I attempted to place the pizza on my pizza stone and it was such a project because of how soggy it was. Still, I hoped that I could save it in the oven.

I start eating the calamari, which was edible and probably my favorite part next to the complimentary rustic bread (that's where your 1 star came from, thumbs up on the bread and tapanade). $13

When the pizza came out, it was even worse than when I put it in. I gave up and just ate it because I was so hungry. Flavor was ""eh"" on top of it. I make a better margherita pizza at home. I'm so disappointed and I was most looking forward to this pizza, I wanted to love it so much. $11

Tiramisu pictures from being served in the restaurant (posted by other Yelpers) show a nice, huge piece of my favorite dessert. That's why I ordered it at $6 a slice. My slice is the tinest piece of cake I have ever had from a restaurant. 

With tip, I paid an even $40 for utter disappointment all the way around. But here's my tip for YOU, Prosecco.. if the quality of your food cannot be upheld, and the integrity of your product is at stake during the delivery process, DON'T OFFER THE SERVICE.",SadH2tQh5jHut4nRlwWcsQ,2,0,1,b02v4H4lAt9JpRwZOzs9HA

I had the shrimp and lobster omelette and the person I was with had the salmon pasta. The pasta was devoured in a tasty vodka sauce and could have been a suitable dish for brunch, lunch, or dinner. The omelette seemed a little empty outside the seafood, but was good once the toppings of avocado and tomato were sort of mixed in. The bottomless was top notch and worth all $19 for sure. And the prosecco they use is very sweet so be sure to ask for additional prosecco for side pours to make the brunch more memorable.

I knew the owners must be Sicilian and Southern Italian because their special was pasta with black ink sauce- very Sicilian. Then I overheard a conversation in Italian, and finally heard my favorite Italian pop star, Jovanotti playing in the background. With all of this observed as I sat down I asked for a Moretti and wouldn't you know it- they have it dark and light and on tap. 

I really didn't even need a menu. I had to try the calamari and eggplant. Eggplant is my personal  test that soooo many Las Vegas Italian restaurants fail. I am a Jersey/New York transplant who had a 100 year old grandmother from Calabria cook me meals every weekend until her death. I am not easy to impress.

The calamari was perfectly cooked, my son loved it and their red sauce was spicy but not crazy hot. The eggplant was done the right way- not some crazy California interpretation. It was just a little mushy in the center, but eggplant parm is not easy.

The gelato and cannoli were excellent! The menu said Sicilian cannoli and it does the island proud. The service was very good, very friendly and I look forward to returning with friends and family.

Definitely worth a go. Crunchy and spicy, not chewy. Then my wife had the double stuffed pork chop. So big she could finish, not to mention tasty.  The ricotta cheese stuffing was to die for. We opted for the seafood ravioli.  They were cooked perfectly with more seafood on top and a light tomato based sauce. Desserts were a delight: creme brulee style custard and I had the Nutella and banana crepes both had the best cappuccino we've had in forever. Be sure to ask to have Rhonda wait on you.

I've been here two times before and something's always been a little off but it wasn't worth mentioning. But today will be the last time I ever step foot in this restaurant. I decided to stop in for lunch, I had the Caesar salad to start and it was terrible. Oh my gosh the lettuce was wilted, yellow and a little red I was actually scared to take one bite. I couldn't believe they would try to pass that off to anyone but nevertheless things happen so it wasn't the end of the world. What bothered me was the servers reaction to our concerns and also that it was still on the bill at the end. When we mentioned it he seemed so irritated. Also, being here previously I was expecting the delicious complimentary bread and olive oil but it never came and I never mentioned it because I assumed that it must be just for dinner service. I was really disappointed when I saw that the two tables beside us were offered the bread. Maybe I'm looking too much into it but words can't describe how this type of service can make a person feel, was it the way we looked, the way we were dressed?

The location is twice the size of the old Round Table Pizza and very, very nicely decorated.   From the very first greeting you receive from  ""Nicco"" and the staff at the front, you know you are in an establishment that caters to the customer.
We were seated near the bar in a single sided booth with tables right next to us.  Not my favorite seating, especially for a cozy dinner with friends.  But, that was overshadowed by all the good aspects of this restaurant.  Our waitress was ""Teya"" who was also the bartender.  Sharp, classy and efficient.  She checked on us periodically and her assistants always kept our glasses full. 
Our group started with the Ruby salad which was very fresh and cold.  It would make an excellent lunch as it was large and tasty. For our main courses my guests had a chicken and veal dishe and I had the veal chop.  All very good with excellent accompanying sauces.  Dessert was a treat with our favorite being the banana Nutella crepe.
My only regret was waiting so long to try this place. We have been missing out on a great local dining establishment.  We might request a normal table or booth next time, and hope Teya can be our server once again !!!",T2YYLWJGu1in2siQu-1unw,0,0,5,UwkniJTsURny16GEbKPcMg

The dishes we ate 

Caesar salad - very good salad cold bowl and cold lettuce added to the wonderful crunch . The chunks of Parmesan in the salad were great and plentiful. 

Prosecco salad - mango , heirloom tomatoes , avocado , Persian cucumber and a nice creamy balsamic . 

Capellini pomodoro- really good angel hair with a light red sauce and basil . Really good classic dish . The Pasta was very fresh .

Cheese ravioli -The best dish of the day. Gray raviolis in a light creamy cheese (beschamel ) . Every bite a gluttonous delight.  Truly a great pasta dish.

We came on a Saturday around 5pm so I thought we'd be the only ones, but there was already a large group and the tables started to fill up quickly. 

We ordered
- Grilled octopus, served on a bed of couscous 
- Ossobuco with a saffron risotto 
- Asparagus with lemon and butter sauce
- Pepperoni pizza with bell peppers and mushrooms added

My favorites were the veal shank and octopus. Both were so tender and seasoned just right for my taste. I wouldn't usually order asparagus, but my mom likes it so we ordered it. We both thought it was ok, but probably wouldn't order it again. The pizza was a bit salty for both of us and the crust was too thin...or maybe the topping was too heavy?! In any case, I prefer my pizza to be of the Unfloppy variety :) But it did force us to fold to eat it and look like we were from the east coast! 

Service and vibe were quite pleasant, food was mostly good, but the bill seemed a bit high considering we didn't have any drinks. So overall I give 3 stars using my very scientific method of taking the excellent service and 2 out of 4 dishes (5 stars), and subtracting for the 2 out of 4 so-so dishes, price value and likelihood I'd be back for dinner (2 stars), making it a strong average 3 star.",4ilItg9QgjlIvYGkOWehXA,0,0,3,9_biNeI_0-22B2MocTFROQ

On my last visit, my party did mostly specials - the octopus appetizer special was absolutely fantastic, perfectly cooked with lovely texture. We also split up a salmon fettuccine in vodka sauce, which was divine. I opted for the sea bass special which was also very well cooked, and a friend did the osso bucco over risotto. After I tried some, I had some regrets about not getting it!

Don't skip dessert either. I'm not a huge fan of the cannoli here but the prosecco-infused custard is to die for. I also enjoyed the small bit of tiramisu I managed to steal from another friend's plate.

Unfortunately, Prosecco didn't do enough to earn our return business.  
Service was friendly but slow. Waters sat empty. Drink orders were forgotten, came out wrong, and then to add insult to injury - double charged. Since it took 40 minutes for our food to come out we were now hungry, thirsty and annoyed. The kids love to play restaurant where they stand at the table and ""take our order."" Despite half the tables having kids with them, the owner came over and asked ""are these yours?"" (Our children) and then lectured us on how unsafe it is for them to be standing where waiters may be walking. 
It's a shame because the meatballs and calamari were both quite good. Clam linguine was pretty light on clams, including multiple shells that came out empty.

Arriving around 9 we were immediately seated. Red shade lighting hangs overhead and setting is slightly intimate. 
Cocktails orders placed and add bruschetta, the cocktails came and were stiff, bruschetta on crispy Ciabatta with delicious yellow and red heirloom tomatoes with a zesty seasoning was a good start to the meal. Food ordered, squid ink spaghetti and prawns, and Chicken Marsala. 
I'd requested the prawns in a spicy fra diavlo sauce which he said he could do, however when it arrived it was essentially plain tomato sauce, totally void of any sort of heat. The prawns were huge though, I must say. My hubby's Chicken Marsala was pretty tasty, accompanied with baby carrots and a handful of green beans, artfully arranged on a long rectangular plate. 
Service was attentive and friendly. The owner (I think he said his name was Giuseppe) came over briefly and introduced himself.
Dinner minus tip was $122. Kind of steep for two at a strip mall Italian place, but I would consider returning. I like supporting small mom-n-pop places.",njUgJcn8ZN0BdZdNEswRwA,3,1,4,EQeLdRDk6-gpX64egUJPIw

4331510,2017-08-24,1,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"Came in here for an early lunch on a Monday morning because the wife had a craving for tiramisu. I thought the place seemed oddly familiar - 3 years ago when I came out this way it was a dark and dingy pizza joint and now it's a bright and beautiful Italian restaurant.

We were very quickly seated and greeted with a warm welcome. There were two servers working at the time and they were very polite and attentive.

We ordered ravioli, a pasta with bolognese sauce and a pizza for my 2 year old. The ravioli and pasta flavors were amazing, you could definitely tell they were freshly made. As a precaution though, their sauces seem to be a little heavier on the wine content than most other places (but I didn't mind!) The pizza we got for the kid was HUGE for a kids meal, and was oddly topped with a handful of fries - which was a little weird.

Oh, we also had the calamari appetizer - the portion size was great and it was fried to perfection (with clean oil) and served with a slightly tangy but light marinara sauce. I don't normally like marinara because it's so thick and chunky at most places, but I feel they really perfected it for this appetizer by keeping it on the lighter side. 

You could really tell that this place pays close attention to detail - from the homemade croutons, to the amazing olive oil dipping sauce for the bread, all the way to the completely spot free glasses they pour your drink in.  This was a truly wonderful casual lunch experience. I hope their dinner service is equally as good because I want to go back and try the seafood linguine!

In summary, it's a wonderful local Italian restaurant that really hits the spot.  Keep up the good work!",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,1,3,5,k8gkU9Jtgd_1zoinDH8X0A

4382188,2016-11-14,2,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"On Saturday night we dined here with friends. The food was pretty good, but I'm still cringing at the awkward service. 

This is obviously the hot, new spot. I made reservations for 6:00 and I'm glad that I did because the restaurant filled up quickly. OpenTable didn't show availability, but when I called the restaurant they took my reservation.

Let's start with the food since this was pretty good. To begin we were given a bread basket with a sauce that looked like pesto, but seemed to be made with olives. The sauce was tasty and a nice step up from the usual bread or oil for dipping. 

I began my meal with the Ruby Salad. I really liked this salad and the portion was large, too large for me to finish. The beets were tasty, the salad dressing was delicious, and the goat cheese was the perfect amount to round out the flavors. The Scampi Paprika didn't disappoint. The paprika sauce had a nice flavor and I enjoyed the simple spaghetti served with the shrimp. My husband had the Salsiccia e Rapini all Cabrese (sausage) and he said that he liked the dish. For dessert I had the Tiramisu. It had a nice flavor and was okay, but it wasn't something I would order again. 

It's not often that I say this, but the food was overpriced. The Scampi Paprika was five pieces of shrimp with spaghetti so $29 seemed a bit steep on this dish. Even my husband's sausage dish seemed overpriced at $18 for a sausage with broccoli. Starters and dessert prices were comparable to what other restaurants charge.

I'm sorry to say that the service is the main reason that I probably won't return. I wanted to like this restaurant since it's close to home and located in a parking lot that is simple to access. It started with the wine. Long story short, our friend asked if they had Moscato and the server said yes, but returned with Riesling in the hopes that she wouldn't notice. The wine was served by a different person which made the situation more awkward and he was rather pushy with trying to get her to take the wrong wine initially. He ended up backtracking and insisting he would take it back if she didn't like it, but he'd already pushed quite a bit by this point. Through the evening it didn't seem like we had a dedicated server. I've seen the team approach at other restaurants and it works, but here it just began miscommunication after miscommunication which made the whole experience feel awkward. At the end of the meal a gentleman came by to ask if we could repeat everything we ordered so that he could prepare our checks. What? Why didn't the person that took our order share that with him? It was, you guessed it, awkward. 

Overall, the food was pretty good and we enjoyed the evening with our friends, but the service soured the overall restaurant experience.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,11,4,3,rFuiz4G3vgWzvFY_DVXjnw

Giuseppe (co-owner) really took care of us when we went for Mother's Day dinner, making us feel like family, not just another table of patrons. He patiently guided us on our individual orders, including the bottle of wine (a smooth & tasty chianti). When I confessed that I couldn't decide between the filet mignon and the filet medallions with mushroom sauce (non mi piace il funghi), he suggested that I should get the tomahawk. Although I love a good steak, but having never heard of such a cut, I told him that I don't know what that is. ""It's wonderful. That's all you need to know,"" he assured me. When a server (or owner) of a restaurant boasts emphatically about the quality of something particular on their menu, I have learned that such advice is prudent to take. A tomahawk is a jaw-dropping sized hunk of beef at the end of an approximately 18-inch bone (I regret not taking a picture of it to show you before I dove into it.) And it WAS incredible, just as Giuseppe had promised. He told me that it had been aged for 80 days, but all I know is that it was absolutely the best steak I can EVER remember eating! I also got the ruby salad, which, if you like beets and goat cheese, you will love! My wife got the salmon in a lemon-based sauce with a prawn that arrived at our table looking magazine-perfect, and she said it was delicious. We also ordered the minestrone soup, which we thought was perfect. My brother ordered Branzino (sea bass) ravioli in a lemon butter sauce. Delicious, perfect portion. For dessert- Bavarese al Prosecco e Fragole (creamy delicate prosecco custard served with coulis) and another similar custard item, creme brûlée, both of which were as outstanding as they were beautiful. There's something for everyone on this menu. I felt somewhat remiss in not ordering something more typically Italian, but I have no regrets about my tomahawk (other than not taking a picture of it).

We were excited to try this restaurant since we'd heard great things about it but I will make sure everyone knows what lack of customer service is provided here! 
I originally reserved a table days before to ensure our seats. Unfortunately they didn't listen to me when I told them the amount of people. When we arrived and they realized it was a smaller party they hurried us out of the original table we were seated at to move us to another. The way they rushed us like cattle was upsetting. The server was abrupt and lacked of personality from the moment he asked what we wanted to drink he acted as if we were a bother to him. The server and the owner treated us as if they thought they were better than us.

This is not fine dining! This is a local business so act like it! Treat people as you'd like to be treated. Las Vegas is known for customer service and this restaurant sure missed the mark. 
As I was leaving I told one of the employees that I would be speaking to upper management and he laughed at me and let me know he was the owner. He sure didn't act like an owner, an owner would be sincere and apologetic and would try to improve the situation not antagonize the guest. 
The only apology we got was from the hostess who mistakenly reserved for a larger party. It's too bad we didn't get to try the food here but I won't be coming back here or recommending this place.

First time:
They serve complimentary warm bread with pesto which is to die for. No shame that I ate almost the entire mini-loaf of bread and left one piece for my partner. 
Ordered Burratina as an appetizer. It was delicious, fresh, and plated beautifully. The prosciutto was crispy and delicious. I could have eaten an entire meal of just that. 
For my entree I had the Agnolotti alla Piemontese which was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time. The ravioli were clearly handmade and the creamy truffle sauce was rich and flavorful. I made sure to use every last drop of sauce because it was so delicious. 
We shared a bottle of Prosecco which was chilled and refreshing on a hot summer day. The atmosphere was nice and we had an amazing time dining here.
The owner came to the table and we mentioned a hilarious review we saw on Google about a delivery driver hitting on someone's wife. We laughed while reading it, but the owner was distraught. He told us they use GrubHub for deliveries and this person was not affiliated with Prosecco at all and was NOT an employee. He was extremely sad that this bad review brought down his overall rating, which shows he cares about his customers and his reputation. He chatted with us a long while & offered us some Limoncello on the house. 

Second time:
We enjoyed our last meal so much we decided to come back for dinner again within two weeks of our last time dining here. This place is truly a hidden local treasure. 
We once again ordered the Burratina (the fresh mozzarella and crispy prosciutto will have you coming back for more too, I promise.)
I once again ordered the Agnolotti alla Piemontese because like I said before, I have not had such a rich and flavorful pasta dish in a long time. It may not seem like you get a lot of ravioli, but they are extremely filling and both times I could not finish my meal. 
We shared a bowl of muchroom risotto which was probably the best risotto I have ever had. That is a bold statement because my mom makes awesome risotto (sorry mom). We DEVOURED the enormous bowl of risotto like it was nobody's business. 
My partner had the Branzino fish which he finished so fast I wondered if he even took a breath between bites. 

We love this place, it's one of our new favorites. We will continue to come back here for dinner. I have a feeling this is one of those places that no matter what you order, the food will be good. The staff are actually Italians at straight from Italy, the hospitality and service are amazing.

So nice to have the choice of indoor or outdoor dinning, we chose indoor to soak up the ambiance. Which has an open floor plan so your able to take it all in, while soft Italian music plays in the background. Now for the food, which is what brought us there in the first place. The waiter told us the Chef's specials which had me change my mind and go with Chef's stuffed veal chop, my eye's are rolling back in my head, so delighted with this choice. My husband chose the fire roasted Lasagna. I'm sad to say he told me MY Lasagna doesn't hold a candle to this.

First we were served some fresh hot bread with a side of I believe it to be a pesto like olive oil. 

If you like beets, the beet salad was wonderful, combining just the right amount of beets, goat cheese and candied nuts with a light dressing on a bed of greens.

Second course; was the butternut squash ravioli's in a sage butter sauce, Also equally delicious.

I would have liked to try their desert but I was to full but will be going back again.

Service wise, my boyfriend and I had a bit confusion when we asked about the specialties and menu items. The server has a thick accent so it was more like a language barrier but I can tell he knew his menu very well. It wasn't a big deal at all. The wine list was all reasonable priced too so we couldnt miss out on a drink.

We ordered three entrees- 
Canellonni Gratinati: Very cheesy oven baked pasta. We wanted to order the alfredo but went for this instead. It was equally delicious and we did not regret ordering this instead

Bianca San Daniele: Pizza with proscruitto, arugula, and truffle oil. The hint of truffle oil was great. We had left overs so we took it home. 2nd day pizza tasted much better.

Lobster Supreme: Lobster seafood pasta!!! This one was devoured first. The lobster tail was soft and tender. I am not a pasta expert but the pasta noodles were so soft and yummy! Cant beat house made noodles.

Creme brulee: My boyfriend said he was stuffed and cant eat any more. Guess who ate more because it was delicious.... (yup). I am not the biggest fan of creme brulee just because sometimes it tastes way too sugary or you can taste the vanilla extract a bit too much but it wasn't overpowering at all!

The inside was much nicer than I anticipated & we were seated promptly. We came in around 5:30pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy.

The server was very nice and the busser was awesome he kept refilling our water so quickly. 

Cajun shrimp pasta was awesome! It was a white sauce and their seasoning was so good not too salty but so much flavor. The shrimp was served on a skewer and they were charred and delicious!

 Fettuccini Tocca with short rib (beef) was a red sauce and very flavorful, a little more heart. The beef was tender.

We also got the grilled octopus appetizer which was soooo good!! We also got the tiramisu for desert along with the cappuccino. Although they don't have milk alternatives...

All in all the service and food was awesome.
The only reason I couldn't give this place a 5 star was that l, the owner/manager there, greeted and checked in with all seated and newly seated tables while we were there. He checked on them asking how their service was, food, even having small chats with a few regarding wine and such. Never once did he approach our table. He even stopped by the table next to us just to say hi and see how the guy was. New tables of families were seated and be greeted them all. I just thought it was odd and rude that for whatever reason, not once did he ever stop by our table to say hi or ask how everything was. I even mentioned it to my bf who said that he noticed as well. That kind of rubbed me the wrong way...I mentioned it on a note card they provided with the bill...so hopefully in the future it's something they can keep in mind. If you're going to treat your customers and build that relationship and atmosphere, perhaps that should be done with all.

While driving back from boulder to Vegas we decided to give Prosecco a shot and we were not disappointed.
They started us out with their amazing house baked bread served with an incredibly tasty olive spread; which I could have eaten 4 baskets on my own if you let me.
For appetizers we had 2 orders of the Bruschetta and a Calamari Dorati- a perfect start.
For the Insalati we ordered two:
1. the Heirloom Caprese, the Burratta (mozzarella) was perfectly creamy and salted and the heirloom tomatoes were tender and sweet and the EVOO they used was of the highest standard.
2. the Ruby, which is abeet salad with goat cheese, pecans, and greens drizzled with a sweet vinaigrette. The perfect combination of sweet, bitter and crunch
We loved both
For dinner we ordered family style:
Margherita Pizza - this I did not get to taste my 15 year old devoured it before i looked up. He said it was good 
Agnolotti di Zucca - a pasta filled with butternut squash and ricotta cheese in a sage sauce. Light and delicious
Tagliatelle al Salmone - pasta sauteed with salmon and in a vodka sauce. Perfectly cooked pastawith just the right amount of cured salmon and vodka sauce not to overpwer it.
Spaghetti e Polpette - spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was a perect al-dente the meatballs very tender and the marinara scratch made
Fettuccine Tocco - fettuccine with braised short ribs. OMG the short ribs were so tender you could eat it with a spoon
We finished dinner with 3 desserts and coffee:
Cannoli - reminded me of little Italy NY
Banana Nutella Crepe - you can't go wrong with Nutella
And the chef's special an Apple crisp served with a Tahitian Vanilla Gelato.

1.  This location, 21 years ago was an Italian Restaurant called Round Table Pizza. Ate there once and always wondered why it was always empty.

2. About 3-4 years ago, another Italian restaurant opened up, called Gabriela's Italian Grill and Pizzeria.  It had a nice decor, nice dessert area and a beautiful kitchen. Ate here twice.

3.  Today in the last year, Prosecco opened up with two guys from Italy opening it and I wanted to try it for a long time. It was THE BEST!

Food -  We went for lunch and they have some great lunch specials for a reasonable price that includes soup or salad.  However, I asked if we could see the dinner menu and if we could order from it.

Pulpo - For an appetizer, we ordered grilled octopus on a bed of couscous.  So tender and tasty was this octopus that I am not sure why I usually order Calimari.  this octopus was tender and juicy.  The couscous was perfectly cooked al dente and that made the taste just right.

Veal Chop - I decided to try the Veal Chop because I have been having this at other places and found it to be a bit hard to make.  Here, the Veal Chop is on the bone and incredibly juicy, tender and flavorful.  A nice cut of Veal on the bone is perfect here and where many places make this a bit tougher, you can tell that this was a quality meat cooked to perfection.

Osso Buco - I always order this as my go-to when available to compare Italian restaurant.  This Veal Shank has meat that falls off the bone and is so succulent and juicy that you cannot believe it is meat.  I am not sure if I actually chewed it or swallowed it.  OK, joking but wow, I was impressed.

When you get great service, with great food cooked amazingly tender and juicy, what more can you ask for as a great meal?  I say check the place out asap!

It was pretty slow in there so we were greeted by the server quickly & he got our drink order. Nothing crazy, just some waters & an iced tea. Then he quickly went over the specials, which didn't seem to special just like slight variations from menu items. We ordered the Burratini appetizer and a ruby salad. They came out relatively quickly & tasted great. Then we ordered our entrees. I got some raviolis & my husband got the special filet medium rare. My food was good, there was one tough piece of asparagus, but whatever, the rest was good. My husbands steak, however, was over cooked. When the server came over, he informed him the steak was over cooked, the server kind of froze and another server came over, the steak was brought back to the kitchen where the cook poked at it, then she brought it back & said ""it looks pinker in the kitchen light"". My husband was so shocked he didn't know what to say so he just decided to eat it. My husband didn't want to cause a scene, but he's a chef, he knows how a medium rare steak should look. Pro tip: when the customer says the steak is over cooked, YOU GET THEM A NEW STEAK. Don't argue, that's not cool. Dinner started off well enough, but we won't be back.

Their pasta is truly homemade we had the Fettucine Tocco which was ribbon pasta with braised short ribs unbelievably flavorful and the Agnlotti alla Piemontese a stuffed pasta filled with porcini mushroom and ricotta cheese with creamy black truffle sauce. AMAZING. I normally never indulge in pasta but this was truly so good and am so glad to of experienced what homemade pasta tastes like. Our appetizer was the octopus carpaccio and it was huge in portion and so delicious. The octopus was infused with lemon and a garlic sauce. To end our meal their dessert the Bravaresa al Prosecco a delicate Prosecco custard served with a strawberry coulis was light fluffy and the right amount of sweetness. Service is exceptional and our waitress Rhonda was wonderful. I highly recommend this place food-atmosphere and service was great,9d6tmxW7RJIx3YZcU4gsLA,0,0,5,pHPW8dUQ46zX2tD6PiW5aA

My order was delivered and I open everything and find I'm missing the pasta which I was looking forward to since everyone was raving about it. I called the restaurant and the women was less than helpful apologizing and saying this was her first day and I can speak to the chef , and they must of forget since it was busy today. Unfortunately this ruined my whole meal and was left hungry with a caesar salad and a piece of very oily eggplant that was not edible.

The managers and wait staff are very friendly as well. We tried the Burratina as a starter and it was excellent. It was a cripsy crostini, some burrata, tomatoes, greens and a balsamic glaze. I would say that i would have liked more tomatoes as there were only 2 small ones for the whole plate and maybe add some of their great tasting homemade pesto that they bring to the table to start with bread. For main courses we tried the 4 cheese ravioli which had good flavor and the pasta had great texture. The chicken parmesan was good, although nothing that special and could have used a pinch of salt. I would have also preferred freshly chopped basil on top to just the simple placement of the basil leaves. Overall, fairly authentic Italian food for decent value and great service.

Atmosphere - the decor and atmosphere is very warm and inviting here. Everyone was buzzing and enjoying their dinner on a Friday night, that's for sure! The waitstaff and hostesses were very friendly and accommodating as best as they could be. We did have the baby in a carseat and ended up keeping her in the booth to avoid her being tipped over with narrow space between tables. The booths were just a tad too small for 2 people and a child.

Food - The food was awesome. I had the chicken with lemon sauce and capers. It came with very fresh baby carrots and green beans and had the perfect balance of savory and tangy - it was around $21 which seemed fair for the portion size. My husband had the ravioli which seemed to be a pretty small portion for $22. My family had pasta dishes that they enjoyed. We all shared the mango salad and the quinoa salad which were both very fresh and delicious and reasonably priced around $9.

Overall we enjoyed our dinner out here. The owner came around to the tables to welcome everyone and our server was very polite and friendly to explain everything

As an appetizer we got a chicken Caesar salad. When we told the waiter we were gonna share it, he was nice enough to split it into two separate bowls for a friend and I before bringing it out to us. The chicken was a bit dry and there were just way too many croutons. But on the bright side, there was just the right amount of dressing unlike most places I've been too where they don't put enough dressing. The portion was also surprisingly good even when shared with another person. 

For the entree, I got the Pollo Marsala which was chicken breast with a wine Marsala sauce over it. It came with potatoes, sautéed string beans and carrots as the side. The sauce was great but again the chicken was a bit dry. The portion was also a great size for lunch.

It has a very warm, welcoming vibe, great energy from the staff, a true Italian run restaurant.   Service was excellent but not stuffy or pushy. Our food came out in a timely fashion, the quinoa salad with hazelnuts and blueberry dressing was an exciting new twist,so sick of the ceasar salad and caprese salad. There is so much more to our culture than these cheese laden salads.  Our chicken dish didn't come out drenched in wine and butter, it was light and flavorful.

Really good Italian food - a lot to choose from, everything I had was amazing. Their soups, their appetizers (especially their octopus), their pasta, and their creme brûlée (has a different name but you'll recognize it) - everything was delicious. 
On top, everybody working here is nice and accommodating - I reserved a table for 18 this past Saturday for an event and they were very helpful and nice. We all ended up being half an hour late because of the event before and I was freaking out. I called and explained and I was very surprised how nice and accommodating they were.
I will be back. Soon!",AY-giXkQLUQYA4tzwhR-JA,0,0,5,27vXFp-d6qcV-szs45VA_g

5626366,2016-12-06,2,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"Food was pretty good. I had eggplant parm with pasta. He had an alfredo dish with Cajun shrimp. The marinara was a little orange and a little too sweet for my liking, but that is just personal preference. If you like tangy sauce, you may not like it. The eggplant tasted like it had a little nutmeg. Excellent. The alfredo and shrimp. Excellent. 

They bring fresh bread after you order your drink with a thick pesto olive oil. Very good. 

We had the tuna tartare for an appetizer. Very good. 

Now, the reason for only three stars. You guessed it - service. Marco G was prompt when we arrived, getting our drinks fairly quickly.  

A few minutes later when the bread was gone, so was Marco. The kitchen area has a glass window, so you can see all of the guys in back - talking, laughing, eating with their mouths open, and showing each other stuff on their cell phones. More laughing. Meanwhile, boyfriend's drink runs out, and it's 30 minutes later and we don't have our entrees. 

I can see this being the type of restaurant where it's about Italian family (most of the men had hair to their shoulders) where everyone is one big family and guests are included. This could be okay for someone who is drinking wine and hanging out for a two hour dinner. We were not. 

Oh, and the fungus nats from the plants were bothersome. I told the girl on the way out that if they put an inch of sand in their plants, it should stop that problem. They are attracted to vinegar, which of course, I had balsamic on the table in a little bowl that I had to constantly watch. 

So overall, good food for a decent price, if you have a couple hours. We will not be returning.",yfvuGT7nWIglHZJ4z8v4JQ,1,0,3,QQj0kqccSfMV9ZtLGOm7Dw

Friendly staff all around with a very clean and open restaurant that definitely reminds you of being in Italy.  The outdoor seating is great when the weather allows, unfortunately everyone moved inside on my first visit due to winds but I'm sure it didn't take away from their excellent dining experience at Prosecco.  Great place for a date or a romantic evening and there's even a bar to dine at if rolling solo.  The portions are just right and perfect for family style.  My first meal at Prosecco included the lobster ravioli as my entree which was delicious preceded by the mango salad which was large enough to serve 2-3 people in my opinion.  The taste and presentation of both dishes were excellent and pricing was very reasonable.  Definitely going back soon!",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,1,5,cm-BXFVfZ0W7yOHknx6dNA

We ordered the bruschetta, it was delicious, not too bad for $6! Wish there was more though! 

My girlfriend ordered the lasagna, it was good, fresh! But the portion size was small for it being $14. I ordered the eggplant, it was good, better than most Italian restaurants that either drudges it in breadcrumbs or doesn't season it well. This one was worth $14! It came with spaghetti as well!

The added bread with the garlic oil or whatever it was, was super delicious!! 

We did order the banana Nutella crepe for dessert and it wasn't bad! I didn't know there were nuts on it, but my girlfriend loved it!!

Hopefully we can go eat there next time! Try new foods!",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,1,1,4,rIlI7xjuyZtqhplCmFEEnQ

5913546,2017-05-16,2,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"0 for 2 with Prosecco. I will say all of the staff are very italian and very friendly, but that's where the fun ends. On our first visit we ended up walking out after no one ever came over to us after being seated. 

I only returned because my mom chose Prosecco for mothers day brunch. We arrived right on time for our 10:30 reservation. We asked for 11:00 but were told it was overbooked. Needless to say there were many open tables the entire time we were there. 

We were seated quickly and had our water glasses filled. Again it took quite a long time for our waiter to come over and acknowledge us. He took our drink orders and said he would be back for our food order. Someone else brought out the drinks while we watched our waiter visit many other tables. He did finally return. My mom ordered the strawberry crepes and I ordered the ""benny and the ham"", their play on eggs benedict. 

The food took a while to arrive, but that was expected for mothers day brunch. Although my mom enjoyed her crepes, my dish was absolutely terrible. Overcooked eggs on top of bland potatoes and the most dried out overcooked piece of ham I have ever eaten. The poached eggs were cooked completely through. Our waiter never returned to check on us and see how the food was or ask if we wanted drink refills. Dirty dishes sat in front of us long after we were finished. 

After two very disappointing visits to Prosecco, there won't be a third.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,8,1,2,SLB9xL1VaWXFDNePnra28w

Loved the  food menu. 
Had the lobster supreme. Hubby had meat lasagna. Says it was very good. Portions are large. 
A little noisy but it was Saturday night. 
The dessert looked so freaking good. 
We will be going back again. 
Took an Uber here. So that was nice. 
They have delivery too. 
Check it out! 
Reservation was easy to make. I used open table.

5930629,2018-04-17,1,XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ,"So this restaurant is close by to my house and I've been dying to come here! A few weeks ago I came here with my friend to have an early dinner here. Upon entering the place looks open and airy. It was a busy night and we got a booth in the back area. The place looks nice and clean. The waiter we got we weren't crazy about. It looked like he was just doing his job ... not very personable or friendly. No smiles or anything. BUT the manager that walked around to each table was super friendly and personable! he seemed like he cared about his customers that comes in there.. making sure they are happy! Before we got our meals he was already at the table greeting us and being friendly. We enjoyed talking to him. 

Okay so I ordered a cafe latte to start and enjoyed the drink. The bread with the oil dip sauce was so tasty! loved eating it. Anyways we asked about the specials and opted to order one.. the fettuccine pasta with a pink sauce and a GIANT shrimp cut in half was on the plate as well. Well when we got the plate.. the shrimp was overcooked... it was hard and dry. the pasta was okay but nothing amazing. We sent it back and the manager made sure they cooked it right this time.. he even said when he brought the plates in the back and cut into it...it was indeed overcooked. The second time they made it the shrimp was cooked okay.. wasn't overly cooked. The pasta dish we opted for alfredo sauce instead tasted kinda bland... nothing amazing. Overall for this dish i probably won't order again. 

I was impressed with the manager on duty tho.. he knew we weren't too satisfied with the second dish and took 1 plate off our bill.  I honestly really wanted to like this place! i wanted to try so many other dishes they have on menu!! but this experience wasn't too great on food and service. The only great thing about this experience is the manager who was extremely accommodating to the situation. He was super nice and charming. He aims at making sure the customer leaves happy or at least not mad. His customer service skills is amazing. He was hands on throughout the night and just awesome! the 3 stars I'm rating this place is for him! 

Overall I would say that I wasn't impressed the first time coming here but am willing to come back again to see if service will be better with different waiter serving me.. and if the food that i order next will be tastier! :) I look forward to coming back for a second dining experience and maybe i can change my 3 star to a 4 or 5 star the next time around!",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,1,1,3,MjQsOmP-PGZU4pP5DyvHdw

Service took alittle too long for my preference, getting our meal took longer than 20 mins I think, maybe they are fresh made to order ? Not sure. Would not suggest ordering the Bututa Chicken, it's expensive and flavorless with some arugula on the side. My husband had to put my sauce from the cheese ravioli on top of it. The strawberry crepe wasn't the best either- too thick to be a crepe and the strawberries inside were not fresh and soupy. The special chocolate berry mouse was good on the other hand!",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,0,0,4,1FweelvgOOQk6XLlK-_Jaw

I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants across the country and this was the first one I've ever been to that plays Modern Italian music. It was very refreshing.
 
Interior is beautiful with a lot of versatile seating for booths, seats and 1/2 and 1/2 style tables.

Bread served before our meal was great.

My husband had the eggplant parmigiano. Very good and he has been dreaming about the delicious sauce it came with ever since.

I had the sausage with broccolini and golden potatoes. Great spice and flavoring on the entire dish. I can tell they make their own sausage in house and it was the best sausage i've had in Vegas so far.

Highly recommend this place. We're certainly going to be returning here often.",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,5,MGQsOYdW3eO7VJjPxgSFbA
