Kalua pork and cabbage
Hamburger steak
Korean chicken

The korean chicken was fantastic. Just alittle but of crunch on the skin of the chicken and just the right amount of spice. 

I've had better Hamburger steak, but it'll have to do. I wish there were more vegetables on the plate

I've had waaaay better kalua pork. There isn't much flavor to it. 

The mac salad on all the plates was just like home in Hawaii. Just a dash of pepper and it was like being home.

On the second floor of the California Hotel and Casino, the restaurant's location and kitschy Hawaiian decor made me question my decision almost as much as the nearly empty dining area.  Determined, I went to the counter and ordered ahi poke, kim chee saimin, and spam musubi.  After a helpful and welcomed proper pronunciation lesson from a friendly man behind the counter, I took a seat at a near by booth and awaited my food.

Everything came out quickly, starting with the poke that was shortly followed by my saimin and spam musubi.  Considering that I only spent $12 for my meal, everything was generously portioned and could have easily been shared by two people.  Although the ahi in the poke wasn't the best I ever had, it was a great value for $4.75 and was served in a nice green onion-soy sauce.  The saimin bowl was enormous!  Soft squares of tofu, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of beef, yummy kim chee, and noodles float in a savory, slightly spicy broth that is sure to delight any saimin fan.  And, at $5.75, it's easy going on your wallet.  The spam musubi was also very good, but you really can't go wrong with grilled spam and rice wrapped in nori.

In addition, for those that no nothing about the California Hotel  - it primarily caters to the folks from the islands and there were plenty of them here.

For those not familiar with the downtown Vegas hotels, unlike the strip, these hotels will charge for parking. Fortunately, at this hotel, as long as I had the restaurant validate my visit, I got a refund prior to exiting as I had to pay $5.00 upon entering.

AS can best be described as having a simple decor with the menu board posted on the wall as one waits in line to order.I chose the chau siu ramen and ordered for an extra charge won tons with it. The ramen is offered in two sizes ( regaular and a larger bowl). The food will be brought to your table and i got it in no time.  After all, we are talking noodles in a broth right.

I've been to the Hormel plant in Austin, MN where Spam is made.  It's comprised mostly of leftovers from the kill floor.  They use everything from the pig except for the squeal.  Trust me on this one.  Everything but the squeal.

Yes, I did try the spam musubi.  Thanks for asking!

I also had the Moco Loco, which looks like a big pile of cow excrement.  It's comprised of white rice, seasoned ground beef, two or three eggs, and brown gravy.  Very tasty with some Tabasco on top!  I'm a fat guy already, but I'd be over three bills if I ate this dish with any regularity.

I ordered the chicken plate the first time and was just blown away at the taste.  I mean, i looked at the plate and could probably count up the ingredients for all the items on my plate in 2 hands.  super simple, super good.  the chicken was skin-on, thigh meat.  3 big pieces on a bed of fresh sticky rice and a big scoop of mac salad.  good to the last scrape of the plate... 

2nd time around this trip, i had the ribeye plate.  2 thin cut slices, on the bed of rice and mac salad.  My brother got the local plate, which should be renamed to the LOVE plate, cuz it had love all over it.  it was Chicken and  Beef teri, and 1 spam musubi + rice & mac salad.  

great grub at normal prices (not vegas prices), but the only downer part is that this place is downtown and not on the strip (~$20 cab ride each way).. i was tripping, so im still giving this place full blast Yelp kudos.

Instead of the waitress making sure she had the right table, she starts passing out the 1st dish (loco moco) to that family. When she calls out the 2nd dish (another loco moco), no one ordered it. She THEN REALIZED ""oh wrong table."" She then comes over to my family & puts down all the food, minus my order of loco moco. When I ask her about it, she lightly brushes it off & says ""its coming."" Walks away. 15-20min later, she brings the other family's food, but STILL no loco moco. I held my patience long enough, I go up to the front & before I am able to talk to the head person, she comes & says their cooking it now. I told her off politely that it was her mistake & not mines & now I can't enjoy my meal with the rest of my family whom is already done with their food smh.

I feel bad because the food is good but that one waitress is careless & can't own up to her mistake.

I mean Korean chicken at a Hawaiian restaurant? I guess! It literally tasted like my mom's (Vietnamese) chicken but sweeter. Which of course isn't bad but I was really expecting something amazing, especially with all of the reviews. The portions are very generous, however. You will have to share or have lots of leftovers !

It also states that people should not sit until they have paid. Obviously, people do not follow this rule and the business does not enforce it. 

The topping to the cake was when I finally got to the front of the line and the cashier ignored me. Did not even bother to acknowledge me. A nice ""I will be with you in a moment"" would have been appreciated. Finally after refunding someone's money and ignoring me she finally took my order. As I gave her my CREDIT CARD she points to this TINY sign that read ""CASH ONLY"". I got sooooooooo pissed because it did not have this sign at the entrance.

We shared the kahlua pork and cabbage plate and the aloha special.  Talk about an AMAZING feast.  We've had Hawaiian food a couple times, but nothing as tasty as this place.  We of course left so full it was hard to work (as other reviews note).  I found the kahlua pork to be tender and flavorful - I especially enjoyed when I got a perfect bite containing pork, cabbage, some rice and mac salad... YUM!

It's in the California Casino, which is in North/Downtown Las Vegas. If you've never seen this part of Vegas, you might want to check it out just for kicks. It's usually our desperation stop when we lose all our money elsewhere and need some lower-limit tables to make a comeback. 

But back to Aloha Specialties...

If you've ever eaten at an L&Ls or other Hawaiian BBQ joint, you'll feel right at home here. Loco mocos, hamburger steaks, chicken teriyaki, macaroni salad, spam musubis, they're all here. Stick with the plates, and if you want a soup, only pick the saimin. It's all pretty good, and portions are extremely generous. It's definitely no substitute for ""the real thing"" from Hawaii, but it's not as terrible as L&Ls... 

Aloha Specialties is a very low-key place where you show up really hungover and collapse all over tables. Trust me, you'll look like an idiot if you show up at all dressed up expecting the usual glitz and glam of ""Vegas"". Everybody is very relaxed, you won't be hooking up with random strangers here (unless you're old to really old locals who don't talk much), and service is friendly without being the slightest bit overbearing. 

The ordering system is a little weird, as you order your food in a line, then sit down at any table you'd like, and then they bring you food and continue to bring you things you request afterwards. You'll have to specifically ask for certain things that you'd normally consider ""essentials"". I guarantee you that even if everybody only orders just what they want, you will end up with too much food, which is a good thing.

The process of ordering and waiting can be frustrating if the line goes past 10 at this semi fast food popular spot!

Three of us were starving we all kinda shared three dishes:  Chicken Curry, Aloha Bento and Korean Chicken

Chicken Curry:  Lotsa rice and good portion of Chicken with onions and mushrooms.  Needed to add tabasco/pepper and dash of shoyu to kick it up.  Hearty flavor.  Good for spoon sharing!

Aloha Bento:  No rice, but you get two spam musubis!  Nice layout with a big piece of daikon(yellow radish).  Nothing special but very reliable quality.  That dollop of Teri sauce in the musubi makes it ++++!

Korean Chicken:  No need the tabasco on this one - we fought over this one.  The grill char on the skin made it spicy crispy and so good.  The skin made the meal.  Chicken was cooked perfect. There were three nice pieces of Chicken - perfect for three of us to share.

The mac salad here is pretty good just add your tabasco/pepper to make it pop.  We all wished for brown or at least hapa rice.  HINT HINT!!!   its 2017, you need to add another rice option....pls?

We love to come here and share the generous portions.  If you do only one day meal a day in Vegas, make it this one.  We decided to do a intermittent fasting day with no food from 8pm to 3pm the next day so we were ready for this big DUNCH(Dinner and Lunch)!

Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love staying at the Cal Hotel when they go to Vegas.
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!

At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)

Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.

There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.

Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!",emF8KqAfI2VL6Sfaek9gFg,7,8,4,GBEAnRiFYv1OsGNGlzjC9g

Ahi Poke - DELICIOUS! If you are a fan of raw fish, this appetizer is an absolute must. It is chunks of tuna perfectly marinated in some wonderful, addicting sauce with raw onions and scallions. It was so good that we ordered 3 more to-go, just so we can eat it later. This is just one of those dishes that you simply cannot share, because you'll want it all to yourself!!! 

Kimchee Saimin - Comes in a huge bowl with addicting kimchee broth. It is definitely shareable, unless saimin is the only thing you want to eat. I can't tell if this had MSG in it or not, but my friend said it didn't. This dish is very similar to ramen, but the noodle is different. We were only expecting kimchee in our soup, but to our pleasant surprise, there were also pork slices and tofu cubes!

2x Spam Musubi - It was my first time trying musubi and I honestly thought it'll just taste like spam and rice wrapped with seaweed. I'm not a fan of spam so I didn't think I'll like it much. But I have to say, it was pretty good... probably thanks to the sauce that was between the spam and rice. 

4x Coconut pudding - For only $1.75, this might be the best coconut pudding I've had in my life. It's hard to describe but the texture and taste of the pudding is very similar to the coconut meat you manage to scrape off the shell after you're done drinking all the juice. It isn't overly sweet nor artificial tasting. I can go on and on trying to describe the taste from memory, or you can go ahead and try it!

We wanted to order more but we were about to go eat again shortly after this meal. (What else do you do besides eat when you're on vacation? ;)) So this ""light"" breakfast actually turned out to be more filling than we thought! By the last bite of our coconut pudding, we were more than satisfied.

Environment:
Located on the second floor of the Cal. It's an open restaurant that has seating ""outside"" (aka in the hotel walkway) but small. Expect a wait on crowded weekends, especially tournament weekend! Order and pay, and they will deliver the food to you. They bus your tables for you.

Food:
I've always loved their saimin, but this year I was sad that my saimin wasn't HOT. It was warm. The noodles were great like usual, but the broth tasted like tap water. Bummer. After I added my shoyu and hot mustard, I was in saimin heaven. We ordered a side of kim chee (pass on this) which was not good and probably out of a grocery store jar and a side of mac salad which was good BUT had too much mayo and was too salty for my liking. The mac salad had good texture, crunch, and color though. The portions are huge! My bro ordered the small saimin and it was comparable to a regular portion at any ramen house in socal. I ordered the chicken and tofu saimin and I think it's served in a large bowl. The chicken was moist (thigh meat?) and the tofu was regular cooked tofu. The haupia was firm but the flavor was bland.

Why four stars?
Nothing compares to my grandma's cooking, but if I'm in Vegas, this is as good as it gets for Hawaiian food, especially saimin.",HKnZArO9uMJBiLvrggfKkQ,0,0,4,f5rlvcl65RvUfJE1_mK6hg

They have some great Hawaiian food at an affordable price.  This place tends to get packed but it's worth waiting.  Luckily, this time around, we made our way here a little after the lunch crowd had already left.

Got their Aloha plate ($10.99) which includes chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, 2 spam musubis and macaroni salad.  I forgot that this doesn't include rice because it comes with 2 spam musubis so I went back to order some rice ($1.25).  This proved to be pointless because I only took 4 bites of rice and also had 1 spam musubi left over.  The beef teriyaki can be a hit or miss sometimes.  Unfortunately, the beef was somewhat tough this time around.  The chicken teriyaki was great though.  I also like their mac salad because it doesn't seem too heavy.

Once you order your food, they give you a number to put on your table.  They bring over your order and you're on your own after that.

Definitely a Hawaiian local favorite. If you walk into a restaurant and most of the customers you see are Hawaiian, that tells you something right? 
-Local plate: the chicken was good. The beef didn't have enough of that charbroiled flavor/texture (not enough heat) and they pan-fried instead. Their teriyaki sauce was quite good though. Light yet still holds that flavor and spice in it. Musubi has too much rice but was still quite good. I finished it. Go figure.
-Loco Moco: Hamburger meat a bit dry but flavorful. Egg wasn't over soft/medium cooked (runny) like it should but over hard. Over-fried is more like it. So this is main part i didn't like about this dish. Their gravy was actually good and worked perfectly. 
Overall, i actually liked this place more than a few places i had in Maui. Just cost alone made me happier here.

Price: 
Very descent. Loco moco plate ($7.50) and Local plate ($10) which has teriyaki beef & chicken and 2pc of spam musubi. Their portions are very generous too!

Ambiance:
Very casual. As you walk in, seems like a regular dine in pad but you actually go order first and pay, then go grab your own table. They have a water table where you can serve yourself and they will bring you your utensils. Place is clean but very casual like where it may seem unclean and a hole in a wall to some. Generally a laid back place. 

I do want to say this place may be more 3.5 than a 4 and not that bad to be a 3. Knowing for the good bang for your buck, portion and i know ill be coming back despite a few flaws, i kept it at 4 stars.",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,0,0,4,1Lz9ffegFZ-bBhPq67EYng

On the local plate you get beef, spam musbi, and teriyaki chicken and rice and mac salad. Wish I could substitute the sweet and sour spare ribs for the beef.  The beef is just meh.  The teri chicken is PHENOMENAL.  The skin is crispy and the sauce so perfect.   Not too sweet or salty - just perfection!!!  OMG, I'm craving a local plate now that I'm writing this review.

Only downside is that this place can get crowded.  Sometimes you have to share a table with someone.  The other downside is that it's in a dive of a casino in downtown that is filled with cigarette smoke.

The Aloha bento is on their special menu and consist of teri beef, korean chicken, mahi mahi and hot dog on rice with furikaki and some little side stuff like fish cakes and takuan --the highlight was definitely the korean chicken. The ahi poke had huge chunks of fish, super fresh, as good as poke from Hawaii --had a little too much onions and not enough limu but the freshness and quality of the fish more than made up for it. I originally hesitated with the ahi poke just because I thought it might be grey and stinky but it was far from that and definitely exceeded my expectations.

The food here is delicious. The portions are large and decently priced. Definitely get more than what you pay for in comparison to other hawaiian spots. I always leave Aloha Specialties stuffed and satisfied. My favorites are the Garlic Chicken with Gravy and their Loco Moco. Meat is proportioned well with the rice that the meals are served with. Recently tried their Portuguese Sausage with rice and egg, which was appetizing as well. The sausage was a little on the salty side when eaten without rice, but balanced perfectly when scooped and eaten together...

I would give Aloha Specialties five stars, but the line to order is horrible. It has grown in popularity and is always busy, so it takes forever to order your food. They only have one cash register, which is part of the problem. When renovating, they should have added a few more registers (or even at least one more at the minimum) to prevent such delays in ordering. I will say this though...It's evident that all the employees work hard...every worker is always busy and on the go with their duties. While occupied though, they are still always happy to help.

The other thing to get here is the Korean Chicken.  Spicy, but sweet and salty all at the same time..  The best way to describe it is a spicy teriyaki chicken cooked on the grill top.. 

And for the plane or car ride home don't forget to pick up a few spam musubi's.  No respectable person from Hawaii would leave home with out it.

Pros: one of the best hamburger steaks, even better than most places in Hawaii.. korean chicken, mac salad are good too.

They have the best Saimin ever!  Don't even try comparing Aloha Specialties Saimin with L&L as there is no comparison.  We also like ordering the teriyaki plate which has teriyaki chicken, beef and pork with a side of white rice and macaroni salad.  Their macaroni salad is to die for.  Mix their macaroni salad with a little bit of their thick, oh so yummy teriyaki sauce and it's like you have died and gone to heaven.   In addition, they believe in giving you generous portions and have reasonable prices. They have a good sized menu too, with a little something for everyone. Service is always friendly.  The only downside is they take cash only and at times their lines can be long!   And when I say ""long"" lines, I mean lines that go way out, past the entrance to the restaurant.

Alright back to writing reviews from our roadtrip.  I think all the reviews hit the mark with this restaurant...esp if you're a local from the HI....it's no Zippy's but when in Vegas, will take it.

Staying in the California Hotel aka the 9th island, it was great having a place like this to go to especially if you've been on the mainland for quite some time. Got myself a spam musubi and the aloha bento special...definitely not a place to go to if you're on a diet...was laden with fat, sodium and grease like any good ole spam can and made with aloha.

Just remember, this place is technically separate and independent functioning from the hotel so CASH ONLY...no DEBIT, no CREDIT, and you can't charge to your room..it was also super hard finding an ATM around the hotel and the only one I could find is the one downstairs between the main lobby and the entrance to the casinos.",C7fCrXJkBigA1Xw51fiL7Q,1,0,4,1itWlxhDsuHHbr4DoNYXdw

2585300,2015-09-14,10,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"This review is long overdue as I've been here more times than I can count, over the years. 

The California Hotel & Casino is like the capital of the 9th Hawaiian island, known as Las Vegas. If you're from Hawaii, you know this to be the truth! Take a stroll thru the casino - the odds of hitting the lottery are better than never seeing someone from Hawaii. 

Anyway - some locals like to go the California to eat at Aloha Specialties. Somewhat reasonable prices for decent portions. This last visit, I had a bowl of Saimin with won ton and a side of macaroni salad. The Saimin broth is ok but the noodles are a little thick and a little chewy. Won tons - too much dough. I prefer to have more meat filling. A little on the chewy side too. To clarify - not a crunchy chew but bordering under cooked pasta. Al dente.

Macaroni salad - made with too much mayo. I love mayo but if you take a look at my pics, it was like instead of using one entire container of Costco size mayo, two were used. 

Walking in - get in line to place your order then find seating. No table service. Your order is brought out and if you want water or refills, there's a water station. I can't speak as to refills as I opted for water. 

I know I have posted other reviews that are critical of ""Hawaiian"" restaurants. This one is no exception. Having been born and raised in Hawaii - I'm not a fan of this place and I only went because family was craving one of the dishes served there.",I2qJvA0tbGdZJ3XrwzwfzA,12,9,2,QBY1H2hVuo2B2x1zfCE8UA

2616067,2017-09-26,5,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"If there's one thing I miss about living in Hawai'i, it's the food! 

Somehow, my mom convinced us to dine here this past Sunday during one of the busiest weekends of the year in Downtown Las Vegas. We made our way to The Cal, which by the way is THE hotel to stay in if you're from Hawai'i, in case you didn't know. Vegas isn't nicknamed the 9th Island for no apparent reason, people! We reached the top of the escalator and my god, I've never seen a line so long for a plate lunch!

This was my first time dining at Aloha Specialties, so I wasn't too sure if the line was always this long or if it was just because we were waiting with a third of the festival goers from Life Is Beautiful. We patiently waited for about 45 minutes or so before placing our order, but I didn't mind because it gave my indecisive ass some time to figure out what I was in the mood for. 

I was back and forth between the Hamburger Steak with grilled onions or the Spicy-Korean Chicken. My sister ended up ordering the Spicy-Korean Chicken and I figured I could just sample hers and order my Hamburger Steak! Winning!

The portions at Aloha Specialties are more than generous. Let's just say that I couldn't even see my plate because it was completely covered with rice and brown gravy. I love my rice, I'm Filipino for crying out loud! But I personally think that my plate came with way too much rice. Not to mention the size of the Hamburger Steak was about the size of the plate. Talk about overwhelming! The Hamburger Steak was thin and crispy, just how I like it, but it could've used a little salt. There's no way I would be able to finish my meal alone. Can you say kanak attack?

Spicy-Korean Chicken- Not your typical Korean fried chicken! Aloha Specialities nailed it with this one. The chicken is extremely flavorful and moist, but the best part is the crispiness of the skin! 

My mom swears by their saimin! I tried some of the broth and it was just okay to me. Not the best, but it wasn't bad either. There was a big variety of vegetables in it too.

As a (now) Vegas local, I appreciate the fact that there are many options to choose from when I'm missing the flavors of the islands and Aloha Specialties is now on my go-to list for when I'm craving a taste of home. I would highly recommend this joint to everyone. Great food and friendly service. 

Shoot, even the Hawai'i locals can't stay away from the food when on vacation here in Las Vegas! Needless to say, the line is worth it.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,5,7,4,rBleUWegJ7LnY5df68KYBA

After 2 months of renovating I am finally able to come back after the renovations
Cons:
~45 minute wait in line (this maybe due to their outdated POA system and/or person(s) operating the cash register)
Health Grade of C (Yes you read that right)

Pros:
Food is delish (if your willing to buy food at a place that has a C rating)
Consistently good food
More seats inside
Modern (ambiance, seats, tables, etc.)
Spicy Korean Chicken (my personal fav)
Loco Moco got better (idk maybe I havent had loco moco in a while)
Prices
Right across an ice cream eatery

FYI Saimin is now only one size (used to be small or large saimin, not a big deal tho!!)

I love me some hamburger steak so that's what I ordered. There wasn't enough gravy but the taste, rice and mac salad made up for that. I enjoyed it very much. 

My family and I shared the large saimin noodle. The soup wasn't very tasty (I think I'm just used to ramen broth) but everything in it was good. It just wasn't like ""OMG THIS IS DELICIOUS.""  We also had some korean chicken, which was pretty good. I would have preferred it to be crispy all over just not on one side though :p

Me and my boyfriend were HUNGOVER damn near still drunk from the night before (Don't judge We're in Vegas people! ) lol
Whats better to eat when hungover than some soup....

Walked in and the line wasn't too long maybe 10 people in front of us...

We're both super dizzy, and its so stuffy and hot in there! No air flow at all...

It took us LITERALLY 45 MINUTES just to get to the register to order. Service is VERY slow

They had only two girls working. Both running out food, and only one of them were taking orders so basically she would take a customers order, and then do about 10 minutes of delivering food and waiting on customers already seated.


Anywaaaaaayyyysssss

We ordered 2 Large 'Saimins' & 2 sodas. The total was $27.   (One Soup is more than enough for 2 people to share)

We sit down, our food comes out maybe 15 min later, we ate a few bites, then I see my boyfriend looking at his bowl with a weird face (Weirder than it already is) haha

Me : ""what""

Him : ""Is that a ""F***** Bug""

Yes, Yes its a dammmmmn bug in our soup that we waited almost an hour to order, and eat.

He scooped it out, placed it on a napkin and flagged down the server. 

She came, and quickly snatched the napkin out of his hands, crumpled it up, and said I'll refund your food. (as if this happens frequently and she was following a protocol)

Geeezussss...

They refunded his soup, (NOT MINE) even though I told her I no longer wanted mine as well since I was completely grossed out from seeing a bug in his.
Our soup looked like it hadn't been touched they were practically brand new I could have sold it to someone standing in line.

It was a really nice change from the 3 inch square of fish that you'll find in most restaurants. We also split the ahi ahi poke, which was under $5 for a bowl filled with ice cube sized fish chunks. The sauce that it was swimming in was a little sweet but the cut of fish was pretty tasty.

The Aloha Bento was a plateful of rice, fish, hot dogs, chicken and beef teriyaki. The Aloha Breakfast contained a variety of meats including Spam and the ever popular luncheon meat. Only those with a taste for meat in a can will distinguish the subtle flavors between Spam and luncheon meat.  The small saimin was actually a medium in some ramen restaurants.  The salmon was probably the smallest of the dishes, but came with white rice and macaroni salad.

In Hawaii, the whole pig is laid out on chicken wire and stuffed with hot lava rocks to start the cooking from the inside. The pig is placed in an imu (underground oven with hot lava rocks) and covered with banana leaves and buried for the day. When it is done, the pig is pulled from the imu and the pork is juicy and tender. At this point, the kalua pig is eaten or stored for later use. Kalua Pig and Cabbage is a great way to use the pork. The rich, salty pork works well with the cabbage when cooked together. The cabbage and pork juice is great on sticky rice as well. Mac salad is served alongside for a creamy flavor. 

Teri Beef Sandwich is also a quick lunch stable. The teriyaki flavor was good, but the beef portion was kind of small. One more slice would be better.",aGUZKSRPA-MHHj6b8GhOww,0,0,4,IKmK-SYgkP_axBMr4E7Imw

Definitely order a bowl of the traditional Hawaiian favorite - saimin and add some wontons to it. It's a good size bowl that might be large enough to split if you're ordering a few spam musubi.

Overall rating is a solid 3.5 stars.  I wanted so much to fall in love with their garlic fried chicken.  I loved loved their gravy but I seriously did not taste any garlic on them chicken! =/

My dad was born in Hawaii so we are always on the hunt for some good local food.  Aloha Specialties is one of the must eats when my family or bf comes to Vegas.  

I usually get the Garlic Chicken and Ahi Poke (when they have it).  The garlic chicken is a pretty hefty plate with three breaded and fried chicken thighs slathered with brown gravy.  I love anything with brown gravy and I like my dark meat.  Like I said, a heavy meal... take a nap after eating this.  The ahi poke is on the specials list and isn't always there.  If you see it you should get it!  Large hunks of fresh tuna and onion soaked in sesame oil and soy sauce goes great with a bowl of plain white rice.  Better than sushi!  It is always a bummer when they run out or don't have any poke.  My brother is a big fan of their Loco Moco.  Too much hamburger meat for me but he loves it.  I usually get a fruit punch to wash it all down and complete my local style lunch or dinner.

The hours are kinda limited for a Vegas eatery... they close at 9pm or 10pm.  Be safe and come for a yummy lunch.

Aloha Specialties is hands down the number one place in Vegas for local food and was definitely a must-stop for us. I even took some of my college friends here to experience the foods I grew up with and they enjoyed it as well. 

The space (a lot like the rest of the California) has seen some needed upgrade since my high school days -- check out those floors and that fancy looking menu board! It's a pretty big space but still always busy and there's a line pretty much no matter what time of day you go. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table. The atmosphere is casual but inviting, due in part to the friendly staff and in part to hearing the chatter of all the other patrons. There is something so comforting and familiar about eating here after years of being away from home. Food was a little slow moving from the kitchen to the dining room but we didn't mind at all. 

Between everyone at our table we got the kalua pork cabbage, saimin, teriyaki combo, mix plate, and teriyaki steak. Most of the plates come with rice and mac salad. The portions are HUGE and we had a hard time finishing everything. I ordered the kalua pork and cabbage and dat buggah was ono! It was really moist and had a good cabbage to pork ratio. I also tried my friend's saimin which was also HUGE and it was pretty good, the broth wasn't too salty and the noodles were good and chewy. There is also Aloha Shoyu on the tables so a huge plus for that. 

It's clear why this one is a favorite for so many Hawaii people and I'll definitely be back on my next Vegas trip!

TL;DR: Big portions, cheap prices, friendly service, good food. My only complaint is the mac salad is pretty bland but everything else is so good that it makes up for that!

P.S. They'll validate your parking here too! If you wanna do the Fremont Street Experience it's a good way to save on parking costs if you're already planning on eating in the area anyway!",H7YVaxQtLIiOvy0-Xu1soA,0,0,5,QW7s72KC8SpWw4Nns3CwXA

This Hawaiian joint is located inside the California Hotel, on the 2nd floor. It took me awhile to find the place because all of the signs on the casino level just has arrows pointing to a very general label of ""restaurants."" Finally, I bumped into an employee who pointed me the right place. 

Went on a Wednesday afternoon, around 4pm. Really empty. I find the menu a little confusing, hard to tell what each item actually comes with. After some thinking, I went with the Loco Moco and two spam musubis. The cashiers were all very warm and welcoming, made it a very pleasant experience. I took my order to-go.

Loco Moco was delicious. The hamburger patty was a little dry, but I find that it had flavor even without the gravy. I like that the gravy is not overpowering or overly salty; it complemented the hamburger patty very well. Sadly, the over easy eggs were more over medium/fried. When I broke open the eggs, barely any yolk came out... so disappointed!!! Musubi is good, definitely hit the spot with the teriyaki sauce.

If you're hungry and in the mood for something with an explosion of flavors, do yourself a favor and order it. Loco Moco. Write it down. Memorize it. Love it. Feel it. Eat it. 

Other then that, the restaurant is located inside of a casino so sitting outside of the restaurant is optional, but it might be a little intoxicating due to the heavy amounts of tobacco smoke coming from everyone else. So, if you have kids or just can't handle the smell of tobacco (don't worry, I can't either), sit inside and enjoy your meal!",erywWqnqC4dVQ3b9gf52Dw,4,1,5,gE4mYlx41X9tFIm4JfvNVw

My girlfriend and I got here around 1:30 PM on a Saturday.  They were moderately busy and there were about 6 people in front of us in line.  About 20 minutes later we get up to the front and the cashier promptly starts doing other stuff instead of taking our order.  We order and go to find a place to sit.

There are signs clearly posted all over the restaurant stating that people should not sit down until they have ordered -- basically don't reserve a seat while you are working through the line.  We look around and notice people who have reserved a table even though they haven't ordered (notably a husband and wife).  We inform an employee and they did nothing to get the lady to move.  Instead we waited for someone to clean off another table and took it.

Now we wait... and wait... and wait.  After 30 minutes I go up and ask about our order in case they forgot and they say it's coming soon and they only work on one order at a time, as if my asking them about my order after half an hour was some huge imposition!  We did not have a large order -- just rice and chicken teriyaki.  After another 5 or so minutes our order comes out and they left out one of the orders of rice.  The server did not apologize, but instead ran off to get a copy of the receipt to show us what we ordered and asked if we would like to make another order for rice.  No, hell no, screw you.  I'm not waiting another 30 minutes for a bowl of rice.  I was so upset by this point that I returned my food for a refund.  

Almost an hour after I entered the restaurant, I left without any food.  I will never, ever, ever come back here again.  What a disgusting level of service...",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,0,1,gbfWZwfxDhZPRgKZibxi0A

I ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of ""small"" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.

A couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:

- It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.

- It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.

- You can order take out.

The only reason this is a three star review is because the food is just as phenomenal as it was when I was young. The Sai-Min is incredibly flavorful and soothing. We ordered two bowls of the Chicken Tofu Sai-Min with added vegetables, having ordered the regular as well as the kimchi before. 

Usually, service is fine. This time, however, service was horrid. We waited 45 minutes for two bowls of Sai-Min. Usually this wouldn't bother us, we're fairly patient people and all we had planned we're errands. What made the whole experience agitating was the fact that people who ordered after us were receiving their food, and we were just sitting there, very hungry. I understand that some dishes take longer to prepare than others, but it was simply ridiculous. I was prepared to walk out. On top of it, our waitress kept singing loudly and high pitched, and something terrible was going on the hallway beside the kitchen. I have no idea what it was, but it was slightly gear-grinding and loud. Almost like a fork was stuck in a sink's garbage disposal.

The decor hasn't changed since I was small. Frankly, it looks dirty and unmaintained due to age. I love the photos of the owners, though. It puts a smile on your face, honestly. Drinks are pricey and the water station is a serve yourself, open to anyone who'd like to sneeze on the pitchers or in the ice. So many problems...but the food. The food is still great.

And when we arrived there was this humongous line and I was like.. ugh... I'm so hungry, can we go somewhere else?  It took a little over an hour to get through the line, and I can admit, it was absolutely worth it!

Prices here are soo reasonable, I think we paid about $65 for four people, we all got a main entree plate and got an additional two saiman and an order of ahi poke and a few drinks.  Ahh.. ahi poke.. I only wish one thing:  that I ordered more!  But the sad truth to it all, is that at the end of it, we didn't even finish the saiman, we were THAT full (and this was not without lack of trying).

The only thing I will warn is this.. the local plate comes with spam musubi (in which there is a nice chunk of rice inside the seaweed) it DOES NOT come with additional rice for the teriyaki beef/chicken.  If you order a side order of rice, you will not need it all, you can probably split it with a friend (we ordered two sides after the fact and it was toooo much rice, my sister didn't even finish her spam musubis!).  Bento plate is essentially the same plate except the spam is served next to a giant bed of the rice (and no seaweed) with the teriyaki meats.  I could have probably shared the rice on my plate and no one would have had to order extra.  The last thing ordered was the Aloha plate.. all I can say is, no one had any complaints.  Everything was delicious!  We would have finished the saiman.. if only, we had, more room in our bellies!

Now I can see why this place is so popular.  Definitely worth the hour wait, and the line never ended.  The only thing we were sad about was things slowly started disappearing off the menu (sold out) as we got to the front.. literally, they ran out of garlic chicken right before we reached the order window (darnit!).  To be fair, we did hit the register around 8:30pm and that was close to closing time.  

I don't know if this place could go any faster, there is one lady working the orders, one guy expediting orders, and he helps serve along with another girl, and the kitchen seemed to be cranking out orders as quick as they possibly could.  Everything was fresh and tasty (can't complain). The staff was nice, which is always a plus in such a hectic kitchen.

We will definitely will be back if I'm down by the Californian the next time I'm in Vegas!",ZdQ3Y0NPiEh1u4YMrT5V4A,4,1,5,Z3KT47vd5lofLKV8Cnhj6A

Moved to Las Vegas in 1991 and I have fond memories of finding the only place in Vegas to grab a saimin or mixed plate was at the California Hotel in a hole in the wall reminiscent of my favorite Mom and Pop joint back in the islands.  Back then there were barely enough seats to call it a sit down restaurant, basically you walked up to a window and got your food to go or waited for a table to clear up.  Surprisingly enough one always did by the time your food was ready.

The Aloha Specialties of 2010 still has that same charm as it did the first time I ate there, with a lot more menu items and few more tables.  There are now 10X the amount of ""Hawaiian Style"" restaurant in LV but I still claim Aloha Specialties as the best in the Desert.

The Mixed Plate is a winner, 2 scoops of rice, mac salad, teri chicken, teri beef, and fried mahi mahi.  Saimin is a staple.  When I am in the mood I will treat myself to a Korean Chicken or Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.",AXToqRIfh_TF8PkZkQkw1g,1,1,5,NNaSCd5GA18tDhj7ydcehA

I was recently introduced to Aloha Specialties. I was totally blown away the second I tasted the saimin. So much so that I came two days in a row. I'd recommend getting the small size. It's already pretty big. Get it with wontons! The noodles is simple really. It's a perfect cure to a long night filled with good memories and alcohol. The broth is very plain yet so crisp it makes you want to smack your tongue. You get a deep bowl filled with crinkly noodles, bbq beef and wontons. The wontons are heavily wrapped with wonton noodle and the meat inside was just divine. Again, nothing about these bowl of noodles will jump out at you and attack you with flavor. It's simple. It's satisfying.

Pair the saimin with an order of spam musubi. It's just a great combination!

With the new layout the lines seem to take forever now when waiting to order your food.  Never used to take use more than 20 minutes or so to get to the front of the line.  This time around it took 30 minutes!  Perhaps it was because the place just recently reopened.  Finally after ordering we got a nice booth/table combo with new furniture.  It was busy so it took another 20 minutes for food to arrive to our table.

Is it just me or did the food get changed up a bit??  My usual order of a teri chicken bowl with mixed veggies and extra teri sauce on the side was NOT the same.  HUGE mound of rice, barely any chicken!!  Like literally a thigh and a half worth of meat.  Used to be at least 2 good size thighs.  Thankfully the teri sauce didn't change, still tasty.

And what, no more LARGE saimin?  It's all one size bowl now?  Luckily it was their large bowls.  But guess what?  The portion is now cut!  We ALWAYS order a large saimin to share at the table for the 3 of us and we always have some leftover to take home.  But no longer!  We finished the saimin easily.  It for some reason didn't taste the same either, broth was light on flavor.  Overall the saimin was light on garnishes as well.

The teri burger and the macaroni salad were still the same however.  I like the teriyaki flavor with the flat top grilled patty.  

Other pet peeve with this new upgrade?  The prices!  I know they creeped up over the years but now it is obvious that just about everything on the menu shot up in price.  One entrée is nearly equivalent to going over to Main Street Station's buffet for dinner.  Not sure if it's worth it because those entrees that were coming out of the kitchen were chock FULL of rice.  I love rice, but I need something to eat with it!  Expect to spend more now on your next visit to Aloha Specialties.

Biggest problem with me?  This was a bit back around a couple weeks after their re-grand opening but...did no one notice the big 'C' grade from the food inspector posted on the wall??  I mean, it is not is shut down territory but definitely there are some sanitary issues.

I couldn't stop thinking about it.  And after the wifey & kid didn't like the food this time because it's changed, we haven't been back since.  For the money we often end up somewhere else.  

Sorry Aloha Specialties, but where has the classic magic gone??  Please bring it back!!

On my most recent trip to the Ninth Island, I hit three places I want to share.  I finally dropped by here after I started Yelping.  Aloha Specialties is in the California Hotel in DT Vegas.  The hotel caters to junkets from Hawai'i, and AS offers local, casual cuisine.

I ordered the Aloha Bento ($10.95 - Teri beef, Redondo hot dog, korean spiced chicken & mahi mahi over furikake rice).  In addition, I got a side of mac salad ($1.95).  My wing man ordered the chicken tofu saimin ($6.95) w/ wun tuns ($1.50).

The bento was a ton of food!  However, none of the items really wowed you.  In addition, the mahi mahi was buried under tartar sauce.  Nonetheless, its hard to get Redondo brand sausages & hot dogs on the mainland:  3.5 Stars.  Secondarily, the mac salad was excellent.  It was made w/ Hellmans vs Best Foods, and you could taste the difference.  But the portion was so big, I was stuffed afterwards.  I'd rather have a smaller portion of mac salad, and remove one of the proteins, or give less rice in the bento.  There is way too much rice in the bento:  4 Stars.  Lastly, my wingman really liked his saimin.  The portion was large, the noodles were chewy, and you received a ton of wun tuns for $1.50:  5 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, it is a traditional, casual Hawaiian place.  The only difference is they bring the food to you:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, I thought the cashier was giving me attitude at first, but I realized she just had a ""bitchy resting face"" - a la youtube - LOL!  She was actually nice, as was the waitress who brought our food:  4 Stars.

I know of no better place to enjoy Hawaiian grinds close to the strip.  In addition, if you find yourself in the California Hotel between 11 pm & 9 am, the coffee shop downstairs serves oxtail stew - Ono grinds!!!",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,49,47,4,9oeLU4ImtEp9qdNR2eXiPQ

The cashiers get you processed quickly and they are fast with clearing and cleaning tables to get the next party dining asap.  Waters and drinks are self-serve which I have no issue with as the dispenser is an ideal location.

Grindage:  My two faves here.  1) Loco Moco = white rice + hamburger patty + gravy + egg (sunny side up for me)  you mix it all up and I'll throw in some hot sauce to get pure bliss. This was were I had my first Loco Moco many years ago and since then I've had many more! 2) Local Plate = Teriyaki beef +Teri chicken (no rice) + 2 spam musubis + mac salad.  This is such a great combination of food put together.  All the dishes with chicken and beef is a win for me and I also enjoy their Saimin noodle soup.

Ambiance:  Walls, seats, tables and decorations makes for a very clean casual setting for Hawaiian food.  Timing is everything as lines can pop out of nowhere because people seem to travel here in groups.

4071287,2018-03-21,1,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"Affordable, filling, unique...this is the place to hang out after some late night gambling and strolling on Fremont Street Experience.

The small quaint store is located inside the California Hotel on the top floor. It's not a place to be missed with its bright open French doors and some ""outside"" seating.

I ordered the local plate consisting of teriyaki beef& chicken, rice, mac salad, and musubi. I also ordered a side of coconut haupia for dessert.

The teriyaki sauce was plentiful, sweet, and savory. It pairs wonderfully with the marinated beef, chicken, and white rice. 

Next comes the musubi which is basically nori wrapped around white rice slathered with teriyaki sauce and spam. Despite the simplicity of this food, the sweet teriyaki sauce and the saltiness of the spam with the rice combines wonderfully. Additionally, the crispy nori yields a snappy crunch as you bite into the soft warm rice.

Next comes the mac salad which is macaroni mixed with celery, mayo, and carrot shreds. The mac salad is creamy, sweet, and cold. It's a surprisingly delightful contrast to the main course and provides the warm and salty tongue a rest.

At last comes the coconut haupia (by the way, I'm filled to the brimmed with food at this point). The coconut haupia has an interesting jello/pudding texture and oozes of coco-nutty aroma. The sweet and creamy dessert is extraordinarily light even though it was made with coconut milk.

In conclusion, this place is worth a visit for a taste of simplicity, warmth, and no-frill home cooked Hawaiian meal.",-1MF2tosrw2WcCxeVNk81Q,3,1,5,EhPo2HXfKP3SkEZGaNhLKA

I arrived on a Sunday and made it a point to drive directly here after landing from  So Cal. I had a Hawaiian grub itch that needed fixing quick. After valet parking (self park $3.00) I jumped in the long line to place my order and  opted for the small saimin and Loco Moco since I couldn't decide  on what to choose. Not long after being seated the friendly waitress brought me the two entrees.  I cracked up BC she was looking for another person to give a dish to. Even the customer next to me was shocked what I was going to attempt to do. We laughed about taking leftovers for dinner. Hey at these bargain prices - how could I possibly go wrong? It's cash only so leave your plastic in your purse or wallets people.

The saimin broth was yummy, chau Sui seasoned to perfect flavor - not overcooked or to sweet and just the right amount of fat. the small order was generously sized and hit the spot. The loco moco was also gigantic with a steamed rice base topped with a hamburger patty and drenched with gravy and a medium cooked egg once top . Talk about comfort food - this definitely is the place to find it. 

There's seating out front if you''re nto people watching while dinning and many entrees sell out as did that day. I'm looking forward to returning and sampling  additional island style favorites.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,8,6,4,hrMOV_HUD33Ee9SxEtuyhg

THE FOOD:
    Korean Chicken- I hate when places only offer chicken thighs!!! (Chicken Breast is just so much healthier for you) It was O.K. but once you peeled off the skin the rest of the chicken had no taste.

$6.50 for an Aloha breakfast platter... a generous slice of spam, three slices of sausage, a nice slice of luncheon meat, THREE eggs (!!), a great big bit o' rice (NOTE: this is like Asian/Hawaiian/Filipino/etc. rice, not like pilaf or Spanish or anything) and!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's located inside the California Hotel/Casino (a popular place with Hawaiian tourists due to Sam Boyd's longtime marketing specials) in the downtown area, where you park in the parking garage, take your ticket, take the elevators down to the casino, and then self-validate the ticket at the counter. Take the escalators up (2nd floor) to the restaurant. You stand in line (the menu is on the wall, making it easy to choose what you want), place your order and pay, get a number, select a table or booth, where a server brings you your food. There is seating right outside the restaurant wheren you can people watch as they walk by. Due to its popularity, it does get crowded very easily. We've been coming here for years. (Save room for ice cream- Lappert's is across the way- that's what we do, every time.) And just so you know, we've been to Hawaii many times, so we are very familiar with Hawaiian food. I also have a Grandmother from Hawaii.  

I've had the saimin (large bowl- I can only eat half of it), korean chicken (spicy, just a warning for the mild folks out there- I've been ordering this dish more lately), and the teriyaki plate (order it skinless, just a tip). The plates come with macaroni salad  (yummy) and a couple scoops of rice. Everything is really good. All the Hawaiian drinks are available (like Pass-O-Guava). It's very reasonable. If you're looking for ambiance, this is not a place for a great setting. (I just wanted to mention that because there are some people out there that love that sort of thing.)

1. The food is actually really really good.
2. But the service is super super slow.
3. BUT the portion sizing is huge.

This place is your typical Hawaiian diner.  It's probably the best thing you can have at the Cal and Main without having to leave the hotels.  The food here is really good. But the service is super slow.  The people work like on Hawaiian time, never in a rush. But that doesn't stop the line going out the door.

mac salad - a little on the heavier mayo side but really good
spam musubi - too much rice to spam ratio but you can never go wrong with a spam musubi. and it's 2.50. a great snack
breakfast spam, eggs, and rice - nothing too fancy but it's fantastic in my opinion
mixed vegetables - mix of cabbage, bean sprouts, and celery (just an fyi)
teriyaki chicken and gravy bowl - super basic. the gravy is not too thick. i wish they didn't leave the skin on the chicken and that the chicken was a little more crispier.",9r6E_QI2Eg8c2Lu5v-Guug,0,0,4,n9IaZ4QjU47GGsUPLzf6uQ

This place is a mom-and-pop and hole-in-the-wall restaurant in California Hotel. I know a lots of Japanese live in Hawaii but  a place selling Teriyaki should not be named Aloha Specialties and should not be categorized as a Hawaiian cuisine.  I ordered Teriyaki Combo Plate. It comes with three types of meat: beef, chicken, and pork on a big plate of white rice and macaroni salad.

First of all, teriyaki sauce used here is a very generic teriyaki sauce you can find in a grocery. I think Yoshida's Teriyaki sauce from Costco is more fancy than the teriyaki sauce use in this restaurant.

Beef Teriyaki was a thin slide of a cheap steak and it was tough. I spent more time on cutting it and chewing it than enjoying it. Chicken Teriyaki was odd. It definitely has a big slice of chicken breast but it had small pieces and breaded together. The breaded cover was loose and thick. Pork piece was actually descent. It had a big chunk of fat with it. It's bad for the health but it was delicious.

Fast forward to 2011. Hawaiian food can be had pretty much everywhere in the valley. But I'll always have a special place in my stomach for Aloha Specialties. I'm not sure if it's the absolute best in town, but they get the nostalgia star bump.

Rest assured. I'm not reviewing based on memory from a decade ago. I went back to Aloha Specialties about a week ago. I scanned the menu board and quickly decided on the tripe stew. I do love me some tripe stew, or pretty much tripe anything.

I was supremely happy when it came out and lived up to expectations. It confirmed that Aloha Specialties still ranks up there with the best in town. The stew was solidly on par with my other favorite place, Ross J's Aloha Grill. It makes sense because people keep telling me there's some sort of connection there.

One thing that strangely impressed me was the mac salad. I've gotten to a point where I don't eat the mac salad at most Hawaiian places or I'll substitute it for more rice (something that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ offers). The mac salad at Aloha Specialties was actually quite good--just the right balance of mayo and other ingredients.

Every year I play in a basketball tournament in Las Vegas, and I have stayed at the California Hotel for 4/5 of the times I've gone. Therefore, I've eaten here and sometimes multiple times during the weekend. Aloha Specialties is located within the hotel, and my friend told me something about the Hotel being Hawaiian owned, or something along those lines. With that in mind, Aloha specialties is the real deal when it comes to good Hawaiian food. 

Food: Oh man, I've had almost everything on the menu. A couple of my favorites are the korean chicken, teriyaki steak, and the kalua pig and cabbage. Honestly, you couldn't go wrong with any entree you choose. The korean chicken is my favorite because it has a kick of spiciness, and the chicken skin is nice and crispy. The marinade they use is to die for. If you love spicy food, try the korean chicken first! The kalua pork is tender and they have always done it right!  The portions are great, but the amount of rice they give you is excessive. If you like rice, you'll like all the rice. :)

I dropped in on a  recent Thursday for lunch.  6/28/12 to be exact.  I expected the usual good food and fast service.  I was really disappointed.  I ordered a plate lunch to go.  I took my receipt and sat down to wait.  I never left my seat right in front of the counter.  The cashier(younger lady) that took my order began eating her lunch right after I ordered from her.  No biggie.  I waited and waited and waited.  I started to notice that several people that ordered 15-20 minutes after me were receiving their food in the dining room.  No biggie.  I continued to wait and after 35 minutes I walked up to the front and asked hey where's my plate lunch.  A different(older lady) cashier looked at me like I was crazy.  I noticed that there was a partially boxed up meal to go right on the counter.  I asked is that mine?  She looked at me again like I was crazy.  The original cashier that was now finished with her lunch said ""oh yeah, that's his order""  WTF, WTF!!  I've been waiting for my to go plate for like 40 minutes!!  In disappointment I took my meal and walked out of the casino.  When I opened it in my vehicle the entire meal was COLD, gravy was clumping up.

I know that Aloha specialties does well but you need to step up the service or fire some of your lazy employees.  The entire time I was waiting the staff kept going on about what they were going to do later that day and so on and so on.  

I realize that this review will not affect their business at all but if ownership is reading this just remember nothing lasts forever.  You do have good food but your service is in the dumps.  Hire some people that actually want to be there.  Every one looked like they hated their jobs.  There are a lot of people looking for jobs right now.

Initially I went over to Market Street Cafe at California Hotel, but saw that they were busy. I noticed the sign for Aloha Specialties however, so I went upstairs to the 2nd floor of the California to try this place out.

Aloha Specialties is a very casual place. There are a fair number of tables inside the restaurant with a few right outside on the mezzanine. The offerings here, all of which are cheap would be something you would find at the plate lunch places in Hawaii. Things like Spam musubi, macaroni salad, saimin and meat plates.

I tried the ahi poke ($4.95) which was on special, the flash rice bowl with chicken and beef ($3.25) and washed it down with some raspberry tea ($1.50). My order came out wiki (fast).

The ahi poke portion is very generous. Big chunks of ahi with big pieces of onion and plenty of soy sauce. A very traditional version of this dish. This is salty, so make sure that if you order it that you get a side to counter this. Liked it well enough, though I am a fan of spicy and sweet versions of poke. The rice bowl was cheap and filling. Meats were tasty drenched with the sweet teriyaki sauce. It is reminiscent of the teriyaki you find around Seattle.

It was such a nice change of pace to be off the strip, the vibe was chill, prices weren't inflated; it was just nice to get away from all the lights, loud music, crazy people.

My friends ordered the Loco Moco which was awesome, nice char on the hamburger patties and the sauce didn't taste like normal generic loco moco sauce. I had the spam and shortribs which was also equally awesome. Everything was under $10 and i wanted to order the whole menu.  This was no frills, straight good Hawaiian food, with large portions.

4932051,2008-05-28,0,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"First understand that if you're from Hawaii, you probably visit Vegas often and always stay downtown (never on the strip).  This sets the stage for what has become known as the ""Ninth Island"": the California Hotel (AKA the ""Cal"") and adjoining Main Street Station (both Boyd hotel/casinos that cater to the Hawaii crowd).  If you've never been to Hawaii before, this is a pretty good cross section of the local community all lovingly united by a constant flow of Bud Light and the chirp of Blazing 7s slot machines.

I'm a Hawaii transplant now living in the Bay Area, so I especially look forward to Vegas trips for the food.   On the mezzanine of the Cal is a small restaurant called Aloha Specialties which IMO has the best local food menu on the mainland.  In CA we're limited to Hawaiian BBQ joints like L&L which pretty much offer the same spectrum of choices.  Aloha Specialties has some of  my favorite dishes:

TRIPE STEW: Pretty good, could use more and bigger chunks of veggies.  Tabasco makes it even better. (4/5)
SAIMIN: Not as good as what you get in Hawaii, but far better than the crap they have at places like L&L.  And it's cheap. (4/5)
BEEF STEW: Tastes the way I expect it to and don't understand why other places can't make it (see my L&L review). (4/5)
POKE: Too sweet.  I also prefer the onion/sesame oil style (2/5)

Like I said, I eat here because I don't get good plate lunches and other local food on the mainland.  One of life's biggest mysteries is why visitors from Hawaii -- fresh off of their red eye flights from the land of Kim Chee II, Rainbow's and Helena's -- will wait in a long line for food they could get back home.

He had tried earnestly to suggest another restaurant, but it appears that everyone else wanted their version of Hawaiian food from this place.

We ordered their special - the Hawaiian special lunch plate of pork lau lau, mac salad, tuna poki, and beef (or tripe) stew.  We also added an order of spam musubi and two drinks.  Total - over $15!  WTF?

Whenever I eat Hawaiian food outside of Hawai'i, I always go for the pork lau lau, so I've had my share of this specialty.  With a little shoyu, I took my first bite of the pork lau lau and looked at my friend.  He took a bite himself and knew exactly what I was thinking.  ""This is bad.""  It was dry, flavorless, and ultimately, I think it was old.  In all fairness, I dug in deeper, aiming for the center and was equally disappointed.  Moving onto the mac salad, this was a shame too.  Again, tasteless.  There was no flavor whatsoever in this mac salad.  Moving onto the tuna poki.  There was chunks of low grade tuna sitting in a sauce.  It was okay, edible and had more flavor because of the marination.  But nothing to rave about.  Thank goodness for the beef stew and sauce.  The chunks of beef had flavor and we poured all of that over our rice.  The spam musubi could use some serious improvement too.  I think they are using the cheap version of seaweed, or maybe it was old.  I just know that when I get a spam musubi or make it myself, the seaweed is a lot tastier and fresher.  

The only good thing this time was the free refill on the drinks!  I still gave this place a two star because everyone else was happy with their order.  Then again, they had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it's really hard to mess that one up.

If you feel the need to be immersed in the Hawaiian theme and surround yourself with Hawaiians and Hawaiian stuff, take a walk on over there.  You'll pass by Lambert's Ice Cream, Ethel M Chocolates, and lots of people in Hawaiian garb.  And you'll probably find a bunch of transplanted Hawaiians hanging out there or visiting.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,2,2,XPspyfknURLxczv4O2ZUvg

I got the Aloha Bento for $8.75!  Man this plate is AH-MAZE-ING!  Let's start with a bed of rice, seasoned with furikake, a seaweed seasoning.  Then you have Teriyaki beef, Korean chicken, Redondo red hot dog and mahi mahi.  My gosh!  Worth every penny.  Let's start with the tender and nicely grilled Teriyaki beef.  The sauce really makes it taste like home.  Then you have the hotdog, sliced in half and grilled.  This hot dog is only embraced in Hawaii.  I grew up on this and love it!  It's red, which is weird to some, but awesome to others!  Then the Korean chicken was super flavorful.  Grilled chicken thigh.  The sauce seemed to stick well and such a nice tangy taste to it!  Last but not least, the mahi mahi was breaded with egg and topped with a light tartar sauce. Probably the best part of the dish.  I've grown to love all types of fish and breaded mahi mahi has to be one of my top 5 favorites.  The tartar sauce really pulls the taste together and brings a very light element to the overall dish.  

Man, I'm so glad I chose this meal.  Now I know what I'm getting from now on and will definitely be back next week.  Gosh, I hope you have the opportunity to try it!  So delicious :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,2,1,5,m6grF9tQut94HZhj-TDKuA

I did want the mahi mahi, but unfortunately it was sold out. They did have poke which I love and for $5 how can you go wrong? I knew that wouldn't be enough food, so I got a teri burger for only $3.50! It was pretty good sized and tasty for that amount. The poke wasn't the best I've had, but for the price it was good. My wife ordered the small saimen w/ wontons and she thought it was great. It was a good portion for the price and I tasted the broth which was good. 

This is a place I would definitely visit again. For the prices and the selection, it's probably better than the cafe downstairs. Sure, you can't get a $4 steak dinner after 11 PM, but overall the food is better.",Rjd9Td7yYOqu0A1e2KDAyA,3,1,4,8ZLci-xfA-UtxQU85G7HBg
5049646,2011-06-26,1,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"The BF and I take his mom and grandma for lunch. 

The BF got teriyaki ribeye- the meat was thin sliced and pretty soft. It's thick style teriyaki sauce which I'm not sure if I'm fond of, but its true Hawaiian style. 

I got the garlic chicken with gravy- this was decent, but it was stingy with the gravy and my 3rd piece was a bit burnt on the bottom....burnt garlic flavor is no bueno. I was debating between this or the ocha zuke bento. The family all ordered a plate, but we shared so I picked the more ""family friendly"" dish since the inlaws dont like fish.  

BF and I shared a ahi poke- It was okay. The cut of the fish isn't very uniform with small pieces being really marinated and some pieces being 4x it's size. They give you a good amount for the $4.95, but it's better to go to a poke deli if what you're wanting is good poke and thinking of coming here for it.

Mom got korean chicken- the BF and I loved this dish at Ross J's and hearing the two are associated by owners, we thought this would be a way to let her try it. It was good, but not nearly as good as Ross J's. They make the skin there crispy a bit so it's not nearly as fatty feeling with the skin. 

Grandma got chopped beef steak- this was pretty good stir fry with beef, bean sprouts, bell peppers, onions. She enjoyed it, but she took a piece of the korean chicken and liked it better. 

Each plate was about $8 so 4 plates, poke, and 4 drinks came up to $45ish so it was okay pricing, but I've had cheaper for better. 

Now, parking at the California is a plain fucking bitch. There's always a lack of space for the amount of people going here. We had to find parking elsewhere and wheelchair his grandma over on the street. They are pretty good about taking orders at a good pace so if you see a long line, it'll probably be about 10-15 minutes. 

Being a place with a line, a positive rating and a place associated to Ross J's (which we do really like), I was expecting a lot of ono. Not that it's a no-no, but it's just good food, not great food. It's not what I would say is worth the trouble and the wait . In the time it took us to find parking we could've gone to Henderson and took the family on a lil mini trip. Next time, we're gonna make the drive to Ross J's for the craving and skip this place.

We have been coming here for years, even when we moved to California and would come to Vegas it's always a must for us to have at least one meal here. Sadly, I've noticed the quality has been steadily going downhill throughout the years. The service even though slow, was always pleasant but lately it seems that everyone is on the edge and very easily irritated by people. Last Saturday I witnessed the cashier snap at someone in the back/kitchen in front of patrons and they weren't even discreet about it. So awkward and unprofessional if you ask me. Also the food isn't what it used to be taste wise, portions are still ginormous but what's the point in that if I don't even want to finish it. The Korean chicken is still flawless, thank God for that! Perfectly crisp skin and tender juicy meat with a kick ass marinade. The teriyaki hamburger steak was awful, the steak was dry and the teriyaki sauce had a cloying sweetness that was undesirable. Kalua pork was ordinary, the one I make at home tastes so much better. No lie. Lol

Their Green Valley location is still my preferred place as not only the staff nicer, but they offer a wider variety of the menu as well. They have Chicken Katsu and Fried rice for example that their California Hotel location doesn't carry.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,8,5,3,k7SyRSQALJdvU5uIwA-00A

I've been a fan of this place for 20+ years. Before I moved here from Hawai'i, every time we visited Vegas, we always made our way to The Cal and ate at Aloha Specialties. In the past few months, we have been eating here every week and it doesn't disappoint. Food is still the same as it was years ago. The renovations are modern and nice. It feels more spacious. 

Lately, they seem to have more on staff to keep the line moving. There's still a line and maybe a 10 minute wait at most since this is the most popular Hawai'ian spot in Downtown. But the line moves fast. Now, there's 1-2 cashiers and 2 waitresses, for Saturday afternoons. 

They're the sister restaurant of Ross J's in Henderson. One star off for this location. They have the same food but the only thing that doesn't make sense is I can't order the Korean Chicken as a side. I don't eat white rice or mac salad anymore because of my diabetes so it would be pointless to get the plate. Ross J's offers it as a side. If the owners read this I hope they'll consider adding it as a side order. We come here more often anyways because there's more activities to do in the area. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu, all are onoliscious (delicious.) What I usually get is Korean chicken, Kim Chee, steamed broccoli and haupia. All are onoliscious. Haupia is made fresh, one time it had a good amount of sweetness, the next week it wasn't as sweet. 

Other great options: The Bentos, Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, huge bowls of Saimin, breakfast plates, Spam musubi, Loco Moco, Kalua Pig and sandwiches. Everything is tasty. 

When at The Cal I prefer this place over the cafe on the first floor. Will be back again and again!

TIP: They also sell shortbread and cookies at the cash register. Depending on the wait time, it's worth getting a package to hold you over ;-)

5124216,2012-12-02,1,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"Literally EVERY time my family is near Las Vegas we make every effort possible to stop by Aloha Specialties Restaurant.

My grandpa introduced my dad to Aloha Specialties when it was still located on the other side of the Cal Hotel. Some may think Aloha Specialties is a small location now, well from what I have heard their current location is a huge upgrade.

Aloha Specialties is located on the second floor of the Cal Hotel, right across from a snack shop and a chocolate shop. They have a small location with a decent amount of seats. However, their prices and food seem to draw a crowd so big that seating can get scarce. For the most part their lines literally go out the door. Worry not, the line tends to go quick and the food doesn't come that much later. You order upfront, pay and take your number to your table.

I have tried numerous things at Aloha Specialties and have a few recommendations.
I would definitely recommend the Combination Plate with pork, chicken and beef. It's only a dollar or so more than the bowl and its big enough to share with others. The plate comes with rice and a side of macaroni salad. All meats on this plate are flatten out and covered in teriyaki sauce. I enjoy every meat on this plate because they are all juicy and tender. 
I also recommend a bowl of Saimin, don't ask what's in it, just try it! 
Lastly, I recommend there Aloha Breakfast which comes with portuguese sausage, spam, eggs, rice and Hawaiian bread. Their portuguese sausage was pretty good, the spam wasn't bad but honestly you can't really go wrong with it, eggs are eggs, rice is rice, and the Hawaiian bread was yummy. 

Cheesy
Aloha Specialties is probably up there when it comes to a typical themed hawaiian restaurants. They have cheesy decor and random table cloths.

Overall
This restaurant isn't literally a 4 star restaurant. However, it's a 4 star overall. You get good ethnic food for a more than reasonable price.

Kaluha Pork - Juicy, tendered, and perfectly seasoned.  This is one of my all time favorite dishes and it is legit here.

Spam Musubi - Get these not matter how much food you order or even if you think you are too full because they make the best late night eat or quick bite between casino hopping.

Unfortunately, it wasn't that great.  It wasn't the food.  The food was amazing as always.  And the service (once you do order your food) is pretty quick.  Honestly, turnaround here is pretty fast considering how many people they go through.

No, my experience had to deal with customers.  And maybe there's something the restaurant can do about it.  The seating here is basically, seat yourself.  But with such a small seating area, and a line that is usually out the door, sometimes it may get a little hard to find a seat.  But as I said, turnaround is pretty quick at this restaurant, and usually it works out well where there can be a constant flow of customers without too much ""I can't find a table to sit at"" distress.

However, on this past experience, the line was all the way to the escalator.  A party that had about 20 people decided to save seats when they were clearly at the end of the line, no where near ordering.  By the time we had ordered and gotten our food, we lucked out finding a place to sit, but alas, only 4 seats for 5 people.  We kindly asked these other customers if we could borrow a seat while they waited for the rest of their party to order, but they rudely declined.  Only after my friend asked a second time did they begrudgingly let us ""borrow"" a chair.  Long story short, we finished our food, and this party that had taken up 3-4 large tables still hadn't even ordered yet!

What was most disheartening was that you could see older people start to look for tables to sit at, and there was no where for them to sit because of this large party.

How to possibly fix this problem?  Possibly make it a courteous rule that you can't ""reserve"" a spot until you get your number/order your food.  That way, the people who are eating can actually sit down and eat.

And of course, this doesn't happen all the time.  In this instance, it was really the customers who were rude.  But sometimes, it would be nice for the establishment to step in and let them know it's not cool to reserve that many spots when they clearly weren't even close to ordering yet.

Overall, their food is still bomb, and it a Vegas trip really is complete with a trip to this place.  I won't let this one sour experience deter me.",CZz9iFuILPC9FDYVG_zunQ,5,4,4,mDY1Quc61KYSApkvgxmXwA

I had the Korean fried chicken plate. It was like BBQ chicken with a Korean twist. They give 3 thighs and it was tasty. The skin was crunchy too. The mac salad, however, wasn't so great. It was too mayonnaise-y and tasted like mayonnaise is all they put in it, no other seasonings. I should have stayed with the Korean theme and ordered a side of kim chee instead. 

My parents ordered saimin and I had a taste of the noodles. They tasted freshly made and the portions are huge! It costs extra to add on wonton and vegetables. 

I was afraid to, but I went off on a limb and also ordered the ahi poke. I live in Waipahu,HI and compare poke to Tanioka's so, especially on the mainland, I am afraid to try raw fish. I do not like frozen fish and hate getting upset stomachs. To my surprise the ahi was fresh! I do not like limu too much but there wasn't too much of it. The only thing I didn't like about the poke were the huge cubes. They could have cut them a little smaller and it could have soaked up more flavor from the shoyu, onions, etc. The onion slices are large, too. It was pretty good besides that. 

While we were eating, I saw an order of musubis come out and could tell they are made to order; the nori was still crunchy looking (just how I like it)  instead of wet from the rice and moisture. 

Although it is not advertised, they offer free refills on the beverages. You just have to bring your cup to the counter.

I was hungry when I stopped by with the fam for dinner after hitting the floor at the Cal an working up an appetite.

The fried saimen is so good.  Noodle are tender but with enough tooth to them to be respectable.  No pasty or gummy fare here.  Toppings are fresh and flavorful with bright green onions with just a little tang to them.  Bean sprouts are crisp and milky white with a fresh taste.

I also had a cheeseburger in the same sitting (I was hungry and from Hawaii).  The patty was moderate in size, not thin and not gluttonously large.  It was hand made and contained fresh juicy beef that had that homemade flavor that no process patty can compete with.  Lettuce, onion, and tomato were firm, fresh, and juicy.  FYI you can get a side of kim cheese and toss it in the burger for a wonderful kim chee cheeseburger, not for the faint of heart or heart burn prone.

The restaurant is located on the second floor.  It is not a fancy restaurant.  You stand in line, place your order and they give you a number and they bring your food to you.  The prices are cheap considering that it is getting harder to find a good bargin meal in Vegas.

I had the kahlua pork combo that came with rice, macaroni salad.  I also ordered the saimin soup and nibbled on my mister's aloha bento that that came with fish, teriyaki chicken, bbq short ribs, and portugese sausage.  For dessert we had haupia.  

My kahlua pork was tasty, maybe even better than King's, but the rest of the stuff was just all right.  The haupia was just coconut flavored agar-agar, kinda like jello.  Nothing special.

Their menu includes bentos and combo plates for such a good price. We ate here twice; once on Monday night for dinner and again on Tuesday morning for breakfast. On Monday night, we ordered the garlic chicken with brown gravy and the mixed plate, which consisted of teri steak, chicken, and mahi. 

The garlic chicken with brown gravy was so delicious--so much so that my friend couldn't wait to eat it when it arrived to our table. Unfortunately I wasn't able to snap a picture. The brown gravy though stole the show. Reminded me of a pork cutlet type of gravy; so rich and flavorful. 

The mixed plate on the other hand had the three meats: beef, chicken and fish. The teri beef and chicken both had a glaze of teri sauce while the mahi had a spread of tartar sauce. On the side was a scoop of mac salad. The teriyaki glaze tasted so delicious. The mahi was also tasty and with all of the flavors together, it all worked together in perfect unison. 

On Tuesday morning we ordered beef stew and the saimin. The beef stew coupled with the mac salad really brought me back to my mom's home cooking. My friend loved his saimin and I did too! The broth definitely made the dish for that's where all the flavor came from. 

Whenever I'm in Vegas I'll always visit this restaurant at least once. It reminds me of home and the food is delicious. If you want a taste of the islands definitely give this place a shot.",tmk9UysAEwAj0PA1icTJsw,2,3,5,taaSwKH9FREVfjjIiSN2oQ

There is a long and boisterous line, so you will have plenty of time to decide on your order and discuss life and the menu with strangers in line. I heard lots of passionate opinions about both. After much consultation I decided to get a chicken bowl, with onions and mushrooms.

Sit down after placing your order (the table turnover is pretty quick) and the food is brought to you.

Came during peak lunch hours on a Saturday and was expecting to wait awhile to order. I was pleasantly surprised to only find a short line, which moved rather quickly. After placing our order, we were given a number and easily found a table.

My teriyaki combo came with steak, chicken, pork loin, and side orders of macaroni salad and rice. Out of the three meats, I enjoyed the steak the most. However, even the steak was just okay. All meats didn't have a lot of flavor to them. They were each drenched in teriyaki sauce, which I wasn't exactly a fan of. However, the sauce definitely gave all three meats some much needed flavor. If you are a fan of rice, this combo had a lot of it. I found the macaroni salad to be just okay as well. I did like how the mayo wasn't overpowering.

I also had the chance to try the kalua pig and cabbage dish, as well as the spam musubi. The kalua pig was definitely much better than my teriyaki combo. It had a nice smoky flavor to it and was tender and juicy. The amount of pig that came with the dish was rather generous as well. The spam musubi was good, but nothing memorable.

They also renovated the restaurant not too long ago so it is more modern looking.

The only thing I don't like about the new set up is that there is only 1 cashier and a few workers.  So there were times where it took half an hour to an hour to get order, even quick orders like spam musubis.  Ill assume they go in order of who orders first, but when you have small orders that can go out quickly, especially to-go orders, they should definitely be faster.  With that being said, the line to order can get very long.  Ill also assume that they only have 1 cashier because their restaurant isn't big and if they have multiple cashiers, they wouldn't have enough seats for the customers.  The last time I came here, I ordered two spam musubis and a loco moco to-go (oh and I wasn't happy that the loco moco didn't have any gravy on it). That quick and simple order took more than 45 minutes to fulfill.  I really hope they are just understaffed because that is unsatisfactory in my eyes.

Throw in a scoop of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice, and you're in high fat, high carb heaven.

Since this was my first trip to Aloha Specialties, I decided to try one of the standard plate lunches:  chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, Spam musubi, along with the obligatory macaroni salad and rice.  For dessert, haupia.

Chicken katsu is basically breaded and fried chicken, rolled and sliced.  It was OK, but not especially crisp or flavorful.  ""OK"" pretty much described the beef and Spam as well.  Nothing was bad, but it wasn't exciting either.  The haupia (coconut pudding) was downright disappointing.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,2,0,2,oFRwDQVo-CZbCMaauL0uOQ

Bold statement I know but for the price, quality, quantity, service and consistency this place has it all. We've been going to Vegas for decades now and we've tried hundreds of restaurants from the ultra high end on the strip to the soul food in the hood. While there are absolutely some great eating spots in town we always find ourselves coming to Aloha Specialties every trip, if not multiple times. I get the same thing every time too, the garlic chicken with gravy over rice and a spam musubi. I could probably eat that every day of my life. Lunch hour can get crazy so expect to wait in a long line and for a place to sit. On weekends I've seen the line go out the door and into the casino. The service is pretty quick even when busy. This place is inexpensive and only accepts cash. But if you're rolling around Vegas without any cash it's probably time for you to go home.",w-fkht6rk_MszTx6g9zqXg,0,0,5,wXlanMi34R1panN7IRIR7w

For some reason, I always order Raspberry Tea whenever I go here and I never order it anywhere else. It is totally a psychological thing or maybe it just goes well with my meal. Who knows? 

I recommend anyone to check this place out. It is one of my favorite Hawaiian food restaurants. When I used to be a tourist, I would always made the effort to go to Downtown just to eat at Aloha Specialities.

Aloha is located on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel down near Fremont Street. We got here just before noon and didn't have to wait in too long of a line to order. This place is CASH ONLY and no coupons are accepted. 
The menu has plenty to choose from...combo plates, saimen, spamusubi, loco moco, breakfast, etc. We ordered a large saimen and the teriyaki combo plate with mac/rice. The saimen was good....lots of noodles and tasty broth. The combo plate was yummy also, a variety of chicken/pork/beef with tons of rice and some good mac salad on the side. Portions are large and hey, even if you're still hungry it'll roughly cost you maybe $5 more to order some more!

Garlic Chicken is the bomb. Crispy and garlicky goodness. Mac salad was on point. I just have to remember to ask for gravy on the side lol.

5849645,2012-10-15,3,wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg,"Last review from my Vegas trip.

Went here for our last dinner in Vegas before hitting up Marquee.

This restaurant is far off the strip. Heading over here we did pass by the ""Pawnstars"" shop & the wedding chapel that they used for ""The Hangover."" Pretty cool! Also the self-proclaimed ""World's Biggest Souvenir Shop."" Place was HUUUUGE! So I wouldn't doubt the name at all.

Walking into the hotel this restaurant was located in was AWKWARD. Apparently that hotel attracts the OLDER crowd. I didn't see anyone our age at all. What made it eve more AWKWARD was that we were dressed in clubbing clothes so all the older people were staring at us like we were hookers or something. lol. Walking into the restaurant got us lots of stares since we were severely over-dressed & looked out of place. Besides that, here goes my experience.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki, musubi combo. It comes with 2 MUSUBI'S! Yummy! The macaroni salad was sooooo good! The chicken teriyaki, WOW. They were not stingy when it came to portions. I ate as much as I could since we were going to be drinking alot that night & it still looked like I didn't even put a dent into it.

The prices are unbelievably low. I guess going off the strip makes things a little cheaper.

I would go here again, just sayin'",y975lu1oBjpW47TT1QdFHQ,3,3,4,ByyVVSN1Kd0LS-oFUQfCiQ

We're all from Hawaii, but currently live in the Pacific Northwest so this restaurant is a little taste of home. I've tried multiple things here over the past several years, but my favorite is the Aloha Bento. The korean chicken and teri beef are super ono! I also get a spam musubi every time I come here, but I save the musubi to eat as a snack at a later time cause the portions here more than enough for me to eat in one sitting. The portions here definitely make the price worth it.

The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it always takes a while to place an order and to get your food. There's often a long line, which makes the long wait for the food to come out understandable. However, on my last visit, there were only 3 other people in front of me and the line moved slower than ever. I'm not sure if I went at a time when they didn't have as many workers, but everything took a really long time.

Even if I know the line is gonna take forever and I'm gonna end up waiting for a while to get my food, I can guarantee you that I will eat here every time I stay in downtown Vegas.",4rlnl-ElfpfU6P4ki0lkHA,0,0,4,5XM2KTwwn_zX_usR0sOQCg
