Someone randomly coming up to me the next day to explain how trashed I was.. even tho allegedly I was so sober that I purchased a very very very cheap bottle of tequilla (which probably tasted just as bad as it looked if I even drank tequilla which I don't)for 233 dollars. Instead of just purchasing the bottle of Jack from the bar in my suite for 30-40 dollars which I would have drank no problem, had I been coherent enough too know what I was doing.  If I had drank it I probably wouldn't be here now able to tell what happened.  And I tried talking to the manager the next day to possibly return said bottle and was met with a manager lady who was very rude and not very helpful at all.  I love MGM casino and the pool and every bar inside the Casino but will be taking my money elsewhere from now on just from the way I was treated in 10 mins at this bar.",KLjonKK96HUowHmuZXCKdg,1,0,1,JXzgM3RmJaOeUYbO13UIhA

The credit card company noticed a $18 tip which apparently caught their attention. I disputed the $18 tip and my credit card company corrected the problem. I have been staying at the MGM Grand since 1994 and this is the first time I've experienced an issue with being overcharged at the property.

I picked a table at the back and honestly, no server came up to me as I sat there for about 10 min. I'm certain she saw me there, but she never came by. I was close to walking out when I saw a table open up near the stage. I snagged the table and instantly was greeted by my server Rizza. To say that she was awesome and provided amazing service is an understatement. She was a damn superstar! Quick, sweet, knowledgeable and always a smile. 

A couple of my friends showed up, some of them former bartenders, and they were also impressed by Rizza's ability to show us and her other customers an awesome time. The country band from Nashville that played that night was also great and had a whole lot of people dancing. By the time we knew it, one round turned into several, well let's say 8 or 9 rounds of drinks and a stay much longer than expected. Rizza continued to come around often and interact with us despite how busy she got.

I ready how they get down at night with live music and dancing. Grabbed a few beers including one in the plastic boot! The waitress was amazing, after talking to her for a bit I found out it was only her 2nd day. She was def. A pro though. The shots, beers, and overall service was on point. She made sure as soon as I got low on beer a new one was on its way. It seemed really small so we didn't go back for the night festivities. However id totally go back to chill for some day drinking again!",bDF4XoMF-bApT_YQD_duTg,1,2,4,RpSegQCC3rLuTJ15W8CESQ
