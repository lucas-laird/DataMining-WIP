34600,2015-06-24,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,Wanted a romantic night with my man away from family and kids so got a room at Downtown Grand.  When we arrived we were told we got a free upgrade.  The room was amazing.  We had a great view the bed and pillows were so comfortable the bathroom was so big and the decor was modern retro.

54643,2015-02-08,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Likely The New Best Value In Las Vegas Luxury Accommodations!  We stayed at the Las Vegas Grand back in November (4th-5th), not knowing what to expect.  When we arrived, Keith at the front desk staff was friendly, courteous, and professional.   Then, he surprised us by going above and beyond, upgrading our stay to a beautiful corner room without our even asking...    We couldn't believe my eyes when we saw the room.  Amazing value for LUXURY ACCOMMODATIONS.  The hotel's gorgeously appointed rooms were world class for the same price or less than I would have paid for a bargain basement room on the strip.   

We were so impressed by my first experience at the Downtown Grand Las Vegas, we just checked in for our second stay, and Alina, the lovely, fun and friendly front desk agent greeted us like High Rollers.  She took time to find us just the right room and made us feel appreciated and welcome by so being genuinely kind and thoughtful.  

The Downtown Grand really knows how to treat guests right and it's hard not to notice.  They've earned my loyalty and I'm looking forward to many happy returns.

Tip:  Check out the spacious Premium Rooms; The WOW FACTOR is more than worth the few extra bucks for the upgrade, especially when your looking to impress your overnight company ; )",_d7Wy2vcdrXxr5chUgb1bg,0,0,5,gLpl15CqEZOL7xARMjqMGQ
59397,2016-08-23,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"The room was nicest part of this stay and it was little separated from The Freemont Street Experience so not terribly loud. We were on the far side of the tower so we were sheltered from the noise of the pool but had a view of the Binions Parkin deck only.  The shower did not have hot water so that was a bust. The room was clean and spacious; We had a king suite. Free coffee is nice but it's in the lobby only. And there are advertised ice machines on the 5th floor that are not there so you have to search. 

The people staying in this hotel were rude, gross and complained every time we were in the lobby. We didn't even go to the pool happy hour because of the crowd it attracted. I guess the lower prices attract a lower class. We wanted to stay downtown one time for the experience and we go it!  It's not entirely the hotels fault. I will never stay here again though. Downtown is ridiculous now.",k7Zjd36zIIZZPX-KdivZlw,1,0,2,S7X-MHL7OzvqPtbE_O3mFg
65841,2015-07-10,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Very late review but I stayed in this hotel from May 22nd until May 24th; I pre-paid for 2 rooms. On May 24th, in the early hours of the morning as my partner and I were asleep in bed, 2 individuals used a key card that was programmed for room 1835 and entered our room. Let me repeat that, they used a programmed key card and ENTERED OUR ROOM. 

When they entered and saw us laying in bed, they specifically asked ""Is this room 1835?"". Fortunately, they realized that there must have been some error, apologized, and left the room. Imagine our shock, surprise, and confusion at waking up to strangers entering our room.

I then called the front desk to question how this could have happened. The front desk person responded with confusion and could not provide an answer but offered to send security up. I responded that they already left the room, they had a room key for our room, and that sending security up would have been of no use. I think asked to speak with a manager. Again, the manager responded with confusion and offered to send security up. I informed him that security was not needed but I wanted to know how this could have happened. He then said that he needed to have security do a key log check in order to determine what happened and would call me back. We hung up and he then called me back and stated something to the effect that the couple that came into our room had requested a room change. He did not offer an explanation as to how our room was given to them. I informed him of my concerns for our I safety and security and he responded with a nonchalant attitude and tone. I then told him that we did not feel comfortable staying in the hotel anymore and feared for our safety. I asked how this incident was going to be made up for us and I specifically asked to have our room comped. The manager then said ""You already paid for it so I can't comp you"". He then gave us a $50 food and beverage credit to our room. 

I am grateful that the people that you incorrectly gave our room to were decent individuals. They could have been high, drunk, indecent, unscrupulous people and a bad situation could have turned worse in a heart-beat. I will NEVER stay at that hotel ever again.",sXop0vviMqduBqs97WJskg,2,0,1,5DLK-eH_l1T44214rVNMxQ
78312,2017-06-03,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"We were pleasantly surprised by the Downtown Grand. For starters, we mainly wanted a place with a good pool, and the Citrus Grand Pool Deck was great! Not a huge pool, but just we needed. The lounge chairs were very comfy, we never had a problem finding seats, the pool was small enough to actually warm up during the day, the music was good and at an appropriate level. Bonus, the food on the deck was delish! Get that hummus. 
The rooms were clean + free water bottles + free wifi and room service was nice. 
Overnighters beware: the Downtown Grand hosts loud ""dance"" parties at the pool four nights out of the week and although there was no one at the party, they continued blaring the music until roughly midnight. You can also hear Fremont street (although the hotel provides earplugs). So if you're in Vegas to experience night life, cool. If you're there for some kind of tranquil getaway, you'll want to stay somewhere else. 
In conclusion: great value, good comfort, decent style. Perfect place for anyone younger or on a budget to chill for a weekend.",gf1PO8nuPzfeSL_V1R0bdw,0,0,4,7ZdHXtAFXTI9dIk-cZMT0A
80146,2016-10-25,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This place is ok at best. Debated on giving it two stars but there are some nice things that I did enjoy about my stay. Bed is ok. No fitted sheets and they don't tuck the flat sheets in so that kinda grossed me out. I liked the color scheme and decorations in the room. The showers are weird, the glass partition covers LESS THAN HALF of the shower. The water pressure is great but since there isn't really a shower door water shoots out like a fricken waterfall getting the floors soaking wet. I used all the towels in the room and still couldn't dry the floors. I talked to housekeeping about this (very sweet woman, the rest of the staff treats you like a second class citizen) and she said all the rooms are like this. You can see the bathroom door is warped on the bottom from water damage. The location is great if you're into Freemont St. Its so close, you can hear the live music/DJ from your room loud and clear at 1am on weekdays, later on weekends. The casino has a kind of steampunk/vintage feel with a touch of modern that I really liked. Parking is in a garage off site(free) valet was 7 bucks(even for guests) Long story short, I would stay on the strip next time, really didn't save much money by staying out here at just an ok hotel.",CBwrmyZtdnpEpAh4En2pSQ,0,0,2,8bBtqiHFKt2TTxSb-JZbSw

94250,2015-03-25,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Pros: Great value for the money. Cheaper than the strip, higher quality than the other downtown hotels
Great location right next to the Mob Museum and 2 blocks from Fremont St.
Rooms are clean, fairly spacious.
Friendly receptionist and dealers
Free(!) valet parking for hotel guests.
Pool area on 3rd floor deck, with lots of chairs and couches.
Fast elevators. Weird compliment I know but I have bad memories of waiting 5+ minutes for an elevator at larger hotels on the strip.

Cons:
Casino not very lively
Tiny fitness room. Felt claustrophobic even with only 2 other people in there
Bland room decor, reminded me of IKEA
Pool itself was quite small, can't imagine doing much swimming if it was a busier day.

Everywhere you go inside the place, there a photos and videos of ""Citrus"", the pool deck, but when you try to go there and cool off, it's always closed.  There's a friendly sign saying, ""See you at 9AM!"" but it doesn't say when it closes.  Turns out it's 7PM!  What?  Las Vegas is incredibly HOT at 7PM!  There were several people, including hot, sweaty kids also wanting to use the pool.

I couldn't sleep because the smell of smoke was so strong. I couldn't wait to check out. The room seemed clean enough, and the bed was comfortable,  but there were only two pillows. Everywhere else I have ever stayed always gives you four. The shower had no door, just a glass panel covering half of it, so you are pretty cold until the hot water warms up the entire bathroom. No one cleaned our room, either. There were no pens or paper in the room. I was going to leave a note for housekeeping to replenish the complementary bottled water, but couldn't.  This didn't matter anyway, since they didn't come. I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff, however. Everyone we talked to was curteous and helpful.

There is something cozy about this place and yet it is very classy at the same time.

The staff at the DT Grand ALL were so inviting and warm.  We especially appreciated the cocktail waitresses who were down to earth and very accommodating.  We did not once encounter a cocky waitress  like we often do down the strip.

There is a large LG screen TV where you can check the weather, see movies, your folio, see what restaurants they have.  You do pay a resort fee which includes wi-fi and water. You can get free coffee or tea at the Art Bar in the morning which was very convenient. Only ate in Stewart + Ogden and meals were very good. Great desserts too. The chocolate cheesecake was outstanding. It's a small casino but what is nice is that you don't have to go through the casino to get to your room.

157483,2015-11-01,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"On the plus side, Tina at the Commissary bar was fantastic! She showed her excellent guest service and bar tending skills while navigating a bar full of competing Mets and Royals fans, during World Series game 4. Thanks Tina for a great time. If I could just rate your service it would be five stars,or as my score card read, a 10.5!

This is our second stay at the hotel and although our time in the Commissary bar was great, it will likely be the last. As many others have posted, the outrageous valet fee for hotel guests is unheard of in Las Vegas. I'm not sure if this fee is disclosed on the booking sites but I feel like the $20 ""resort fee"" should cover it. And, don't get me started on the deceptive practice of resort fees. I know it's not unique to this hotel, but If it's required it should be included in the room rate! I'm typically apposed to government regulation, but it's time for this practice to be addressed.

My best friend and I decided to go to Vegas randomly so we last minute booked a room at this hotel and they had told us that they ran out've double queen beds but we requested for them anyways. 
Check in time was at 3pm but we got there around 2pm and asked if they had any double queen beds left they said yes and told us our room was ready, prior to that, I love love love that we were able to text the valet number our car ticket number five minutes or so beforehand so that our car would be ready for us downstairs, and also props to their valet people for being so helpful and hilarious! Hahhahah it was a pretty sad but funny scene though watching them run back and forth to the lot and hotel loll

Every where we walked to we were greeted by their workers in a very kind gesture. 
Phillip the bartender guy was just too awesome for making pretty bomb drinks and it was nice chatting with ya as well, thanks for those Vegas life tips! 
Sorry to the other bartender by the pool bout not being a lakers fan anymore hahha, kudos for recommending the pool perfection drink though I liked it very much!

lol it's kinda weird though, for some reason within the four days we were there, there's always different people working 

The rooms were pretty spacious and very modern looking so that was nice but they should do something bout the awkward half standing shower though, like at least add a sliding door or curtain. 

Other than that, 7-11, and Fremont street were literally just a block away, and the strip was just bout 10 min away so it wasn't too bad of a drive there and back, this hotel was just very convenient.

They spent a ton of money and completely remodeled the interior so no more Lady Luck here. It's very hip and trendy. My room was nice -- not necessarily luxurious -- but aesthetically pretty, clean, and comfortable. 

Like someone else noted, the only weird thing is the shower. It's like the shower only has half a door that's permanent. But other than not being able to aggressively rinse my hair, it was generally fine.

357550,2014-05-28,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This was my second stay at the downtown Grand. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. They are small but functional. I liked the extra power outlets by the bedstand for charging all my devices. My only complaints are the showers. They are not fully enclosed and No iron in room. Other than that the place is convenient to Freemont street and away from the noise.

Update 7/1/14

Downtown Grand has proven generous in comping rooms. However if they are serious about attracting people then I would suggest changing the pay tables on their video poker and changing the pays on Blackjack. Good games with full pay will attract locals and visitors. I gambled at the casino but wouldn't video poker (Went to main Street casino for full pay) I tried the slots and played some but they seemed really tight. The food and coffee are great (Pizza Rock is so worth the walk) but the bad odds on games prevent me from spending too much time on the property.

Final note: it is a walk to Freemont street. The area can feel a little sketchy. If something was done to clean up the area even more I think they would get more foot traffic.",dWsL5OBp-Y3_R5WqjFCvrQ,0,0,4,DJOumO_fjV65TZLdeEU_2A

Casino was small but still nice enough.  Felt clean and decent air quality most of the time.  

Few downsides..
We had family staying on Fremont St so one downside was the walk from this hotel to Fremont.  Didn't feel safe making this walk alone at night after being approached for money a couple of times.
Another downside is that there aren't many food options without walking over to Fremont.  
Last, we haven't received any offers for room discounts since we left.  We have other hotels we didn't even stay at sending us offers left and right. 

We would probably stay here again if we could find another good deal on rates.  But not our first choice for Downtown Vegas.",w8w3w4_YktrIfFXM5y7K5w,0,0,4,ISE-c6lk14Ip6cFC8oNKHQ

On the first night, the self park wasn't available so we had to park in valet, which is usually an additional $11 on top of the mandatory resort fee (for newspaper, gym, pool, horrible tasting purified w bottled water, complimentary coffee/tea, and Wi-fi for ""two"" devices despite the ""free"" Wi-fi sign in the room...all things we did NOT utilize but had to pay for). The valet attendant gave us total attitude, as did many of the employees except Chris the bartender.

Room didn't get cleaned despite being gone since early this AM. Seems like the remodel was done on the low budget side as it wasn't thorough. For example the electrical outlet and bathroom counter weren't replaced so they didn't really match the rest and seemed outdated.

(DON'T STAY DIRECTLY ON FREMONT STREET.) Hotel staff was extremely helpful and knowledgable. The pool area (""Picnic"") is great. The hotel was recently renovated and is very stylish, hip, and modern. All that said, other guests have complained about noise at night from nearby Fremont street. That was not a problem for me as I was on an upper floor, however. As such, I recommend guests request a room on an upper floor before arrival.

A couple of deficiencies: 
1. No coffee maker in the room. Whuh? Seriously, this minor oversight is incredibly annoying.
2. No business center. This can be an issue if you need to print a boarding pass. There is a horrible computer/printer machine where you can print a boarding pass by the concierge, but this machine is incredibly frustrating and functions like something from the Soviet Union. Plan on a 30 minute process just to print a boarding pass and plan on missing your flight if somebody is ahead of you using the machine.

Good News:
1. Hotel is right by Fremont Street, which is fun. 
2. Hotel is directly connected to the Strip by a very modern and convenient bus only steps away.
3. Pool is fantastic.
4. Hotel is not directly on Fremont Street.

Checking in was quick and we headed to my room. We crossed the bridge to the elevator and it took us to our room. Our room was nice; however, I was confused on why there were ear plugs in the room. I quickly realized why. Fremont Street is about a block away. There's a stage that plays live music is along Fremont Street. I forgot what time it got quiet, but it's definitely after midnight. I think this would one of the drawbacks for families with kids. If your single or don't have kids, then you probably won't be home until after 2AM. Thus, the noise won't be an issue.

That's very convenient and just far enough away that the noise and crowd is drowned out.  The casino is incredible small but adequate.  all the tables are $5 which is relatively cheap.  The center bar and the casino in general was very new and nicely decorated.  The pool area was great as it's on a third floor rooftop with lots of deck space but the pool itself is small and not very deep.  

I did have some late night food at their cafe restaurant and it was pretty good and reasonably priced.

Now for the bad which is why it only gets 3 stars.  I felt the customer service was lacking.  The center bar wouldn't comp me some of my drink choices even though I was dropping big bills into the machines.  That's unusual.   The gaming itself was small-time. I like Keno and max bet in the whole place was just a quarter per card.  So that was a huge letdown for me.  

I spoke with a security guard at the security booth for a simple question. I was very polite. And in return he pointed, didn't look up from his newspaper, and never said a word. It was pretty rude actually. 

I think this place has a lot of potential but I get the feeling management doesn't have their crap together just yet.  I say bring in fresh management because so far this place is going to ruin itself if it doesn't turn it around. Shame too because the casino itself is beautiful.  

Oh, my room was pretty nice.  It had a good view and was nicely decorated.  You could tell it wasn't a high-end expensive room by the little details but it was still well-kept and clean.

So on that note I told the valet attendant where he and this DUMP can go, also told them I hope they are the next hotel to be IMPLODED!!!!!! I would actually pay $12 to push down the PLUNGER myself!  What a joke this casino is.  They should seriously be embarrassed!  And anyone who would play their EXTORTED prices to park in their lot is TRULY a SUCKER!!

I will make this very short and sweet!  STAY AWAY unless you enjoy bad service and getting RIPPED OFF!  I will never return!! Enjoy.",d724Yf1hvRjgl9zx_-dR3g,10,1,1,O_u56mUcMHmD0_2G64emeA

625152,2014-02-26,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Often we hear the phrase "" there comes a time when all good things must come to an end"" . That is not the case for the Downtown Grand Hotel.  For this hotel it is just the beginning. 

In recognition of their grand opening celebration in November, I received an invitation for a complimentary visit to their new hotel and I must say I was slightly apprehensive about taking advantage of the offer simply because of the bad publicity I've heard over the years about the downtown area. 

I come to vegas several times a year and always stay in one of the larger hotels located on the strip. It has been about 20 years since I've been to the downtown Las Vegas area so I thought I'd put the past history and rumors to rest and take the Downtown Grand Hotel up on their offer. 

The airport shuttle dropped us off and we had to walk through the casino to get to the front desk and the very first thing I noticed as I walked through the casino door was how fresh the air was. I expected to get hit with the odor of cigarette smoke and I could actually breathe and as I walked through the the casino to the front desk I could even smell the fragrance of air freshener.  I'm not sure if they have a superior air filtration system installed but being someone who suffers from asthma the clean air was wonderful.

I was greeted at the front desk with such a warm, inviting welcome from all the staff and Nuvia (Front Desk Agent) was wonderful. The V.P. of Operations, Jimmy Palmer even made a special point to come out and introduce himself and welcome me to the hotel. 

Once my room was ready Nuvia personally walked my mother and I to the second tower and elevator and explained how to get to our floor. As we walked she gave us a brief history of the hotel, suggestions for dining and things to do while we were here. 

We got to our room and I was quite pleased with the accommodations. The decor was very retro and stylish. The bedroom was separated from the rest of the room by double doors which was nice. There were 2 full bathrooms in each room with a fully enclosed shower and plenty of towels in each bathroom. 

After a full long day I was ready for a good night's sleep. When I crawled into bed I could not believe how comfortable the bed was and the pillows were just as comfortable. I generally have issues falling asleep the first night in a hotel but my first night here I was out like a light and slept through the night waking up feeling well rested. Almost slept better than I do at home.....

From the minute I walked through the doors it has been one good experience after another. The only negative I would have to say is having to go home.

I would definitely recommend the Downtown Grand Hotel for anyone looking for the ultimate las vegas experience. It is a place where you can go to get away from the fast paced crazy environment of the Las Vegas Strip and still have an amazing time. A block away from the Fremont Street Experience there is plenty of security and police presence in and around the area. 

The experience definitely begins at the Downtown Grand Hotel.  I'm looking forward to my next visit and I'm hoping the pool area will be open at that time. 

Thank you to Mr. Palmer and his team for creating such a warm welcome and for making my stay one to remember.",I5l8KIh6dlATEjtVZBPCpg,1,0,5,x57gRP6v2kFeBHNWnT1xyQ

The renovations appear to have been done farily well, however, that's the only compliment this place gets. 

Pull into the valet and the first thing the attendant says is ""we charge for valet....is that OK?""  What? Huh? How are you going to compete with all the other hotels (most that are of a much higher quality) if you have this policy.  The attendant then says just go inside and have it validated.  

Went inside and the cashier says, ""You have to sign up for a player card AND meet some kind of gambling minimum to get the validation"".  OK, now you're just being stupid.  Went over to the player club booth to get the card.  The women working there was not at all friendly. My guests each had a matching play offer, so off to the BJ table we went.  Upon arriving at the table (nobody playing at it), we were rudely greeted by the dealer who seemed bothered that we interrupted him while he was.............. doing nothing.  He knew nothing about my guests' matching play offer and neither did the pit boss.  (I couldn't make this up, our experience was getting to be almost comical)  The pit boss comes back and says, ""Oh, this starts next month"".   NO WHERE on the match play were there any restrictions or limitations stating this time frame.  

Nonetheless, we played a few more hands with the 'irritated' dealer who was replaced by another dealer, who seemed to be disgruntled as well.  Wow, well we had enough.

703146,2015-10-09,3,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"There are much better places to stay in DT Vegas. As for the hotel rooms: they're definitely modern and cute, but... uncomfortable - the only way I can describe it. The shower/tub is strange, with no door OR curtain, just a plate of glass that covers half of the shower. The other half is wide open, meaning 1) you're reaching a couple of feet around the glass just to turn on the shower (unless you want to stand in it and wait for it to warm up), 2) water ends up on the bathroom floor, and 3) it's cold... since there's no shower door to close and help trap the nice warmth. I don't get it. Nothing about a half-door works in a shower. The pillows were also totally strange. They're almost tootsie roll-shaped. I know people have different tastes but it's impossible for me to get comfortable with a pillow that thick and firm, and I do believe I'm not alone in that. There are no other options available either. Seriously, it's the crappiest night sleep I've ever had in a hotel! The television does not work either. And the only reason I'm even trying to turn that on is because Fremont Street is blaring right now. Yes, yes, I'm in Vegas and I appreciate the fact it's noisy. But I'm on the 14th floor, facing away from Fremont... And it's REALLY loud. 
I'm not a fan of blowing the big bucks on lodging in Vegas, since little time is spent in your room anyway. BUT, when you are in there, you want to be comfy, right?  This is not the place to get comfy!
On top of that, now there's a actual fee for valet parking? I didn't even think that existed in Vegas. Simply put: that's outrageous. 
Oh and by the way this casino has virtually no table games. Not sure what happened there but this is not the place if you want anything besides video poker and slots.

While checking in the front desk charged my card twice for my stay. They are supposed to just charge you the hotel deposit and resort fee. I booked them through Expedia and when I called Expedia they contacted the hotel and the hotel admitted their mistake and said they would reverse the charge which turned out to be an extra $300 that I wasn't looking to pay.  I called throughout the week to speak with a manager and they kept blowing me off saying that it was an accounting issue and that I just had to wait. This was a huge inconvenience to me being that I was on vacation. It got to the point that when id call the front desk would tell me a manager was busy and would call back. I then called ""Choice Hotels"" their corporate office and filed a formal complaint in which the hotel had 3 days to respond to. They didn't respond so I called the corporate office back. They were able to contact the hotel and I was told that the hotel would respond to the inconvenience they caused me. Needless to say I spoke back with the manager ""Nubia"" or ""Nivea"" and all she did was offer me an upgrade on my next visit to a better suite because the money had gone back to my card....

The Ogden & StewRt restaurant seemed very pretty, clean and nice. But we never got a chance to eat there. Next time. 

I DID get to eat at The Commissary. Loved it. Really good bacon cheeseburger. The bacon was a bit over cooked but beyond that...the burger itself was REALLY good. For breakfast I had their strawberry creeps. It's $6 for one. The one is very big and will more than likely fill you up. I didn't even finish mine. The Mexican hot chocolate was really good as well.

Very nice pool area. It's pretty shallow. Probably 4'.

I loved my room. I was in Room 2135 in the Grand Tower. Nice decor. Clean. Comfortable bed. Good view of the pool and mountains. Bathroom was a good size but I agree with all that say the shower was weird. The 1/4th glass enclosure is odd. It is drafty with all that openness.the water pressure for the toilet is very hardcore which is cool. But the water pressure for the shower was so weak!!! But with most of the  shower being open I would imagine it has to be low pressure or else water would really fly!!!

I loved how they serve free coffee and tea everyday from 6:30am to 10:00am in the Art Bar in the lobby.

Also this is a great location. Right by Fremont Street!! 

Be aware that there is a $50 per night incidental fee. I had to pay $150 for my 3 nights. Fabulous!!! They have no mini bar and nobody uses the room phones to make calls anymore. Why $150??? I'm just sayin...",GOJxcojcS17xc-inAb7isw,3,0,4,-Ywu5rbM4m6A1d4PMGaOyg

I was thankful for the ear plugs provided, but I was nervous to use them, due to the fact of not hearing a fire alarm if one had gone off during the night.

793745,2017-06-13,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"It's a nice place to stay, but the value has declined.

We've been staying at the DTG since it opened. Last week (Monday-Friday) was probably about our eighth stay. I so much want to love this place, but they continue to have quirks that detract from the overall experience. If you just want a nice, clean room a bit removed from the noise of the Fremont Street Experience, it's an excellent choice. It has a ""boutique"" feel that is unique among the 15 or so Vegas properties we've stayed at over the years. It's well-kept, housekeeping is good, the wifi works well (rare for a Vegas property), and it's convenient to all of downtown.

Our biggest issue is that the pool is a public pool. They even advertise the fact on a billboard on Las Vegas Blvd. You pay a $26 per night ""Grand Experience Fee"" (including tax) which their key folder notes ""Includes: Access to the pool during seasonal hours."" Problem is, you don't get any priority over non-guests for the limited lounge and pool space. It's not a large pool or deck. Last week was very hot, and we found the pool and lounges crowded with locals, who came equipped with pool toys and coolers. There was no attempt to screen people. One afternoon we watched a homeless man arrive, carefully put his things in his day pack, and wash off in the pool in his shorts. We were talking one night with a local woman in an East Fremont bar. When she heard we were staying at the DTG she said ""Oh yeah, all my friends use that pool."" With the Vegas kids out of school for the summer (starting this week) it's bound to get even more crowded.

It's also difficult to find any shade unless you rent a cabana. There used to be shaded lounge chairs along the west side. That's now reserved cabana space too. Only a few small umbrellas are available that, if you score one, have to be constantly worked around.

The restaurant is in it's third incarnation. It's now Freedom Beat. Main change is that it features live music at certain times. The food is fine, but service has been inconsistent since the DTG opened. Passing by one evening, a man was leaving and loudly cursing at the host that it was the worst service he'd ever experienced and he'd never return. We ate there once this visit without incident, but have had awful service at times in the past (basically you get seated and ignored, and/or the food takes way too long to come once ordered, and once served you are ignored).

The casino is also a mixed bag. It's pleasant - not smokey, the music isn't too loud, the servers are friendly and frequent if you tip them decently (I think they're the best downtown). There are reasonable table limits and good video poker pay tables. But homeless people wander in, sit down and put a buck in a machine, wait to get a beer, then cash out and leave. They also use the bathrooms for the toilets and to clean up. To some degree this is a problem in all the casinos, but it's more visible at the DTG.

Casino staff are pleasant, but are often confused about the rules for their promotions. This lead to our being told one day that we hadn't checked our results soon enough in a tournament, when we had been told at the Player's Club we had to wait until that day to do so. To their credit they eventually straightened it out, but it's a weekly tournament so the confusion is surprising. Also, no one could tell us what benefits (other than free parking) accrue to achieving higher tier levels in their club. Even online, the link leads to an ""Error 404"" dead end.

They seem to be aware of some of the issues. The Guest Services Manager and Director of Player Development even came over and talked with us one day after we had voiced some concerns to one of the servers. There are apparently differences of opinion within management about what changes are needed.

So, overall, if you are just staying there chances are you'll be happy. If you use most of the facilities you may be less satisfied. Their tack-on $26 fee is now the second highest downtown (after the Golden Nugget), but we don't feel the experience has improved along with their rate increases.",vfv2VLE77MMU5lF9uMCYgg,3,0,3,uanwPp2-fM67UDyr4yIvFA

Noise is a problem from Freemont street as you can hear the bands all night.  They only have ice machines every other floor which is a pain.  The room walls seem not to go flush to the windows as you can easily hear everything going on in the rooms next to you.  The ventilation is bad as smoke comes through the vent.  I am on a non-smoking floor but it stinks.  When I walk into the bathroom it smells like someone just smoked in there.  It can get really bad. 

The casino smells less smokey than my bathroom which is nice.  If you don't like to drink a lot then this place is for you as it takes forever to get something to drink.  After 45 minutes at the craps table I finally had my order taken only for the waitress to never bring it.  I caught up with her 15 minutes later and she said ""I thought you ordered water"".  I have no problem if she got the wrong drink order but I didn't even get the water she thought I ordered.  At that point I cashed in and will gamble elsewhere for the rest of the trip.  If you can't get ""free"" drinks in Vegas you might as well go to your local indian casino.

When we stay downtown, we usually hit The Nugget. I had an offer for 2 comp nights at the Downtown Grand, and figured I had nothing to lose! I must say I was pleasantly surprised with everything at one of downtown's newest offerings.

We arrived at about 5:30 on a Saturday, there was no line to check in. Having done my thorough research, I knew to ask for a room facing away from Fremont to get a good night's sleep. We were accmodated with a room in the Grand tower on the 7th floor. The view was nil, but I didn't care. Peace and quiet was paramount, and I got it. 

The rooms are done well. Modern, but basic. Very clean, and pretty cozy. The bed was firm, which I prefer, but could have used another pillow. No fridge, no minibar, but 2 complimentary bottles of water. Plenty of accessible power outlets to charge all your devices. 

First order of business was a shower to freshen up. I'm sure you've seen the numerous comments about the open shower in the bathrooms. I must say, it is a really confusing design choice. Quite frankly, it looks like a way to save on glass when they rehabbed the hotel. The last thing you want to do in Vegas is look cheap, and choosing to forgo shower doors does just that. The shower pressure was weak, and slightly stronger than rainwater.

Had a good time in the casino, played most of the night. I pounded more than my share of Heineken, even had a dispute over a blackjack hand that was resolved with the pit boss and surveillance in a quick and professional manner. Dealers were friendly, as was every employee we encountered. Drink service was quick, as the casino floor is pretty small. Good selections of slots and denominations, and didn't feel like we were getting killed. There was a decent live band playing on the casino floor, which is a great idea.

Complimentary coffee in the commissary Sunday morning was a welcome relief. They do not have traditional room service here, but in room take out. Your food arrives in Styrofoam containers in bags. Ordered breakfast, and it arrived quick and hot. No complaints.

Overall, I was impressed with the downtown grand but there are some problems.   The rooms are well designed with stylish modern decor.   Casino was busy one night but somewhat dead on my second night.  Just a block away, casinos on Fremont were fairly busy both nights.   Employees were friendly and courteous.   The attitudes of employees was a big plus.   Far and away the biggest negative to the rooms is noise.   Street noise and noise from neighboring rooms are barely blocked.   I fall asleep easily so it was not major deal for me but I think it might be one for many.
As for restaurants, the commissary and Stewart Ogden were pretty good.   Downtown grand could stand out if they had good buffet ( all the ones downtown I tried were gross).",PoOjfNrj0Y3awUvx5084xw,0,0,4,yV1AgMT4r6RStsUjl-8dmg

1100664,2016-01-05,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I've stayed here about five times since the place opened a liittle over two years ago and I used to like the place a lot.  Unfortunately as other reveiwers have noted over the last six months a new management team has taken over and I have noted a lot of changes for the worse.  Downtown Grand's new penny pinching is likely to put the place into a death spiral.

They raised the resort fee from 11 to 22 dollars a nights and now charge $7 to valet park even if you are staying in the hotel.  Way to drive away your loyal customers geniuses.    Self parking is still free for guests but it is in a decrepit older structure a block away.  Trust me you don't want to do that.  It's littered with empty booze bottles and has outdated elevators that look like they were taken from Fallujah bomb shelters.  If you survive that you get to lug your suitcases for about ten minutes to check in.  Nah, I'll just pay the 7 bucks.  Strike one.

The City Suite rooms are still nice and still have the floor to ceiling windows for great views of the surrounding area.  However, I noticed one of the sinks had a broken latch and was stuck in the closed position.  Deferred maintenance is usually a sign of a struggling hotel.  Strike two.

The showers still have the stupid half doors.  In the past I've always stayed here in the spring or summer when it's like 100 degrees out so being cold wasn't a problem.  However during my last visit in December it was like 30 degrees out so the taking a shower with cold air pouring in on your is no fun.  Even if you crank the heat up in the room beforehand it's still cold in the shower.

For me the worst change is they shrunk the gaming pit area in half so they now only have four blackjack tables available.  During Christmas week one evening they had no seats available at any of the three 10 or 15 dollar tables, and one table priced at 100 minimum with no players and a dealer standing there doing nothing.  While waiting for a spot to open I saw at least four people ask the pit boss to lower the limit at the 100 table so they could play, only to be denied.  After a few minutes of watching this management stupidity I gave up and decided to go play somewhere else.  Strike three.

Are you trying to become a slots only parlor or do you want to stay a real casino?  If so please add some more tables and hire some more dealers.  Otherwise two years from now I'm sure you'll be bankrupt and/or out of business.",X6YqqdHiDJSnNTlbD8M25Q,9,1,2,wYRKi9oy-CVg0mlRgjh6ZA

It is exceptionally clean which I value higher than most things. The rooms are spacious, modern and nice. 

You do get some noise from Fremont and Gold Spike but it isn't anywhere near as bad as the hotels in the heart of the Fremont Experience. They also provide some pretty heavy duty earplugs and as soon as I had those in I could not hear a thing. 

The staff was great. No complaints there. Jason checked us in and I thought he was really friendly and did a great job explaining things. The resort fee (19.95/night) is higher than I would have liked but you will get that most places. It covers newspapers, bottled water in the room and wifi. A new addition is that this fee also covers coffee and tee at the Commissary across the street until 10:00 AM. Now this I REALLY appreciated.

The valet price was $11.00. I am guessing it was higher because we stayed on the weekend. Valet service was great, and since we got 50 points gambling each day, the fee was eventually waived. I also really liked how you could text them in advance so we never had to wait for them to get our car. 

Overall, the stay was great. It is a cheaper alternative to the hotels on the strip but way nicer than almost all of the other hotels downtown. We have stayed here before and will definitely stay again!",-Xj9sRGorIWlo7GDWhUQew,4,0,5,gHkjAIBVkQmHc8mAnFE7XA

The rooms do not have a thermostat, so you cannot control the temperature.  The water pressure in the shower is no good...it feels like a trickle.  The view of the Mob Museum was nice and most of the furniture was newish, but there were some stains in the carpet that weren't thoroughly cleaned up.

1.   I tried calling the toll free line about my reservation but when I selected reservations, the phone either went dead or just rang with no answer.  This was regardless of what time I called

2.  I ended up having to come in person to extend my reservation.  The rate was much higher than other places but i needed to get some sleep so i took it. 

3.   The noise level of the room was unacceptable for the price i paid.  Neither ear plugs or the Tv drowned it out.  This is from someone who can not sleep in silence.  The noise went on until 3am.  

4.   When i asked switch rooms because of the noise, there was no apology.  

5.  The bed doesn't have anything to secure the mattress so it slides around.  

6.  The pool has weird hours.   9-3

7.   I asked for a blanket and i was given a sheet as they didn't have any left.  

8.   I tried to get a meal for takeout and i wasn't allowed to from the menu i wanted.   

9.   My new room has a weird smell. 

10. The so called quiet room is possibly louder than my old room.  

11.  Coffee comes with the resort fee but nobody told me this or where to get it.  

12. The TV keeps losing channels.

It is just a block from Fremont Street if that is your thing, a block from a Walgreens if you need something last minute, across the street from Gold Spike a cool local bar with good food and drinks, a block from Rachel's if you are needing a healthy breakfast of lunch. A one minute drive to the 15.

The hotel itself is two different hotels and by that I mean the lobby and the restaurants have been designed by someone with a clean, modern take on design, The dark lobby, the tiled walls the light sconces, the chic modern ""diner"" the mob bar with heavy leather furniture are all great. Then you get to your room. The rooms are all the same decor and it is like a 100 percent turn around from the lobby. The rooms are a beige, sea foam green Ikea feeling set up. They in no way resemble what you would think from the lobby or even when you first get off the elevators.

In a new hotel why in 2014 do you not have rain shower heads? More than one reviewer mentioned the cold draft in the shower and I agree 100 %. The step in showers remind me of a cheap shoer ar the bargain gym. 

No ironing board or iron in room. No robes. I didn't expect a mini refrigerator and there is a lobby store that sells most needed things BUT it closes at midnight. I have asked the front desk why it is not open 24 hours and they responded not enough traffic, Really?...how would you know.... it is closed!! It is as the left as soon round the corner for the elevators.One night I came back to room around 2 am and wanted a cold bottle of water and something to eat, it was closed and I asked the from desk if they had cold water or anything and he said no but they had essentials......when i asked what the essentials were he said cigarettes and stuff like that. Gross. 

The self parking garage is easily and quickly accessible. 

The beds and pillows are great. Much better than at The Golden Nuggett that needs to seriously update the bedding. (I come to Vegas monthly for work and have stayed at either rod these two places..)

I had an over cooked chicken dinner in the restaurant one night that the manager was happy to take off my bill. He offered desert and I accepted. I ordered the molten chocolate cake. If you have ever had a molten chocolate anything you know it takes 20 minutes to prepare. Well this thing came out in 2 minutes and the only thing molten was my attitude. It was a luke warm brownie. When the waitress asked how is it I replied it sucks but you bought it for me anyway so I can't get it taken off my bill.

A few things that bothered me more than I thought it would because I was expecting it from last time were:
That ridiculous half shower glass wall. It makes the shower cold and still no place to hang a towel within reach. 
No in room coffee. Getting dressed and trying to make it downstairs to the lobby before 9 is not my Vegas mode. 
The incredibly bright room in the morning even with the curtains as closed as possible. For goodness sake it's Las Vegas, I don't need to get up at the crack of dawn to plow the fields. 
The swimming pool closes at 7pm! Really? It was 106 at seven. I had hoped to take a dip around nine when the temperature dropped down to a chilly 100 before heading out for the night. 
They removed a game my wife likes, it is electronic craps. Not sure why it was removed, staff didn't know but we ended up gaming a short walk away at the 4 Queens.

Bathrooms:
Tub: The half glass door, I don't get it. Water was all over the rug and floors after a shower or bath.
Sinks: it's literally a 2 inch deep square sink. It looks esthetically grand, but poor function. Either its made this way to combat people from using the sinks as ice buckets or the person in charge is a huge asshat.
Water: cold to warm, no hot water. Drainage is very poor as the water in the sink took forever to drain.

Room:
Amenities: TWO bottles of water. No mini fridge or microwave or even a standard coffee maker. You have to rent them at $/day.
TV: they locked out the HDMI port so gaming or Chromecast is impossible.
Windows: No blackout curtains and windows do not retain room temperature. As for music, yes the bass is real at 12 to 2 am in the morning.
Temperature: Our room became hot and then warm and then hot. This must be some type of scam because the hallway was cooler than my room. Many attempts were made to change the temperature, everything failed.

Bring a small kettle water heater, because they have no coffee maker.
Bring a cooler because they have no mini fridge.
Bring water, because really 2 complementary bottles of waters?

If you don't use it then they give it back upon checkout in full, however it can take 5-10 business days. Don't forget about the hidden resort fee of 19.95 per night which isn't refundable. 

As far as amenities, we purchased a premium king non smoking room, we could smell smoke from the other rooms anyway. Also the room doesn't come with a microwave or fridge those are extra. They don't offer a continental breakfast just coffee which was horrid. They have a cafe attached to their hotel called the Commissary which I bought breakfast from the first night, it was just ok. We ordered breakfast bowls. When we arrived and unpacked we inspected our room and found hairs and black dots all over our sheets and pillows. In the bathroom I found orange/red stains on our floor rug which was folded up as if to hide it. The bed is comfortable, but the shower is dumb. It has a glass wall/door but it only covers half the shower so water gets everywhere and doesn't stay hot in the shower because the steam escapes. I didn't want to step out of the stream because it was freezing. The water pressure is also terrible it is strong for about thirty seconds then weakens to the point of almost turning off and repeats this during the whole shower. The sink does this also. The outside noise is horrible but they do supply earplugs. I  think the design of the room is beautiful but they missed the mark in a few areas.

 Their restaurant in the casino is amazing. The prime rib was awesome, same for the BLT and the mozzarella sticks and parmesean fries. 

The casino was fun enough for us to dabble in gambling, and the complimentary alcoholic drinks they provide are great. We ordered bloody marys and long islands both were great. 

The staff were not very nice but no one seemed to be nice in Vegas. 

Overall the stay was not what I thought I was paying for and was very disappointed however it was better than staying in a crappy motel and suited our needs. We will not be back to this hotel.",cU4I_nuuNBMrhA0tFvs-6w,2,0,1,OZsKzd1ophnoMqsTPZQvSA

1294523,2015-05-16,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Check in: Jackie was very reassuring that our late arrival would not be a problem. Preston was very informative when we checked in around 9pm and gave us a coupon book for local spots. Parking is free in the nearby structure with validation.
Location: Hotel is within walking distance of Fremont St. Yes it gets loud if there is live music, but they give you ear plugs in your room. I didn't notice any noise around 1am, but we did travel during the week, maybe it's different on the weekends.
Pool: They had some music playing over the speakers while we laid out on these teal round bed things. The staff out there were really nice and the other hotel guests were mellow too. There was a corn hole game set up along with a foosball table.
Room: When we entered the room to my surprise, the flat screen TV had a personal welcome message on it. I felt like a VIP after having such a long drive. Everything was very clean and neat. The only thing I was concerned about was the shower.
I looked at the other pictures on yelp after the fact, but our shower was different. Instead of having a tub bottom, there was only a small lip to keep the water inside. The first night I took a shower, the bathroom was a big puddle of water. The pressure was so high from the shower head that it ricocheted off my body onto the surrounding walls and floor. This wouldn't seem like much of a problem if there was a shower curtain or door but there wasn't. It was a small half piece of glass that barely kept any water inside at all. We used all of our towels to sop up the water. I feel that it could potentially be a safety hazard if you're not watching your step, especially if you're an older guest. I also feel like if you don't have common sense and wanted to plug in the blow dryer (which was provided) while standing in a huge puddle of water, it could potentially be very dangerous.
When I called the next morning to ask for more towels, they formally addressed me by ""Ms. [insert last name here]"" and I really felt like I was their top priority. I did not mention anything about the water situation the night before because the water had dried and all we had were wet towels. We were also exhausted from the drive still and didn't want the hassle of moving all of our stuff to a different room. Within 3 minutes, we received a phone call saying our towels were waiting outside. I wondered why they didn't just knock, but I actually liked that they gave a courtesy call instead of startling us with a knock. My fiance opened the door to find a gentleman holding our new towels. He gladly took our heaping pile of wet towels and wished us a good day. I was so pleased with the efficiency and amazing customer service!
The next night I showered, I was able to slightly move the shower head to face the wall. It helped somewhat, but I would suggest maybe investing in different shower heads that have a pressure button adjuster. Also, the half piece of glass is sleek and I get that it gives it a nice modern look, but another half piece of glass could be attached to the other side of the wall to create an opening door from the middle of the shower.
Other than that issue, we didn't experience any other problems. The water was always hot enough when we took our showers and the pressure, like I said, was not lacking. 
Inquiring at the Front Desk: We were pondering staying an additional night due to the 20% off coupon in the book we got when we checked in. Kurt was very nice and was honest about there being a large music event starting the next day (Friday). He checked the rates and room availability anyways and let us know that we needed to call a reservation line in order to redeem our 20% off coupon. After calling and getting pricing for an extra night with the discount, we decided since it was for a Friday night and the rate was exceptionally higher due to the weekend music event, that we would not be redeeming it at this time. I was pleased with the patience and amount of effort put into trying to accommodate us for an extra night.
Overall, we checked out feeling very pleased because we got our money's worth at the Downtown Grand. I will definitely be considering staying here again. It was an artsy, hip, and modern hotel/casino all in one.",FwyvIQ8GHey-_hqhPaqMIg,2,0,4,WS-umgEuxwENRrpLQriH_g

You aren't going to get the boob job and cocaine crowd that places like the Cosmopolitan bring in so if you're coming to Vegas to be around the pretty people try something else. If you want a nice room and a hotel/casino that isn't packed 24/7 this is the spot. The pool is pretty decent and has nice high lumin tvs so you can watch games outside.

Flat screen tv with working remote and good selection of channels, safe, lighted makeup mirror, plenty of outlets, high speed internet with NO limit of devices. Our room over looked all the action below. Now for the bad, this place is LOUD, we dont go to bed until around 2:30am when we're in Vegas so it was over by then, the room came with earplugs, i have stayed in the heart of downtown,  Plaza hotel and had never heard of a room coming with earplugs.The bed is too soft we all woke up with back & neck aches. The bathroom is really large but poorly laid out, 1 light and its over the sink so the shower area is dark, did not have a tub and the shower had half of it glassed in so water on the floor& cold air, its not a vacation if i cant take a nice relaxing bubblebath so that was a downer. I absolutely hated the public bathroom toilet the ugliest thing i have ever seen and make sure to put the seat down b4 flushing, the water comes spraying out, yuck.

They had just had their Grand Opening on Nov. 12th, so we probably were 2 of their newest guests. The valets were friendly & the bellhops were there before we even got out of the car! Check-in was smooth, upgrading our room wasn't a problem. We were even able to check in early. The room was beautiful - light & airy. The beds were comfortable, they're platform beds, so they'll probably move about if there's excessive movement. There wasn't room service yet, but I'm sure by the next time we visit there will be. There is no buffet, but there's a small bistro & a small Chinese resturant. They own the entire block, so outside there's a biker-themed bar, a pizza place & an old-style bar & grille. We went to the biker bar & it felt a little like being in Sturgis. We took the advice of a gentleman we met while checking in & went to the grille for dessert. It looks very nice - all dark wood & dining alcoves. The hotel is just a short walk to the Fremont Experience & the Deuce bus runs really close by. We never drive around Vegas, its much easier to take the Deuce: $8 for a 24-hour pass & it runs along the Strip & out to the Premium Outlet. The rooms come with complemtary water, but so far there are only ice machines on every other floor. There are LOTS of bars!  We had a nightcap in the Mob Bar. There's the Art Bar, where I think you can get bar food & its where the daily complementary coffee is. We've decided this is going to be THE place where we stay in Vegas.

1379136,2016-02-27,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"There are alot of comments about this hotel so I will keep this short.  

The location of the hotel is ideal for anything in the Fremont street area. 

The hotel is clean,  the casino is intimate,  the rooms feel new,  and the staff are extraordinarily friendly from maintenance, to security,  to maids,  to front desk,  to bartenders,  to waitresses... Everyone. I've interacted  with maybe twenty people so far and all of them were friendly,  helpful,  and attentive. The place smells and looks clean. 

The price is amazing. I know some have criticized the lack of vending machines but I think that misses the point and,  in any case,  the hotel has a very nice snack bar,  coffee shop,  etc. that is cheaper than anything else on or near Fremont street for a quick snack or drink. 

I'm an admitted hotel snob. This hotel is well above what I expected,  especially for the price.

Really the only negative I can think of is that the resort fee of 19 dollars a day (for free parking,  which 90 % of the guests can't use,  and two bottles of water in the room every day) felt like a little bit of a trick, but this is a resort town so that's the way it goes. I would like to have had a refrigerator and coffee in the room but for the price I do not remove any stars over the omission. 

I would give the hotel 5 stars for its price range,  but for the resort fee. We will be coming back to this hotel.",vLO8-pEsQIUm5EUUmEBIYw,2,0,4,VlXZu6mHzH_nK_L9ei11Zg
1386856,2013-11-04,4,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"As a local, I like to be aware of goings ons, as well as like to support local projects.  Made it a point to check this place out, and, even went on to book a room the first weekend of opening.  Looking past some of the glitches to be expected in a brand new establishment of this caliber with a fully green staff (like being assigned to a room that didn't exist), there are some major pros, and, some major cons...

Pros: The interior and lay out both very well done, a perfect blend of industrial and elegance, very apropo, very chic.  The staff was very friendly and engaging, and, there's unique food and lounge outlets that make for great exploration.  And, if the casino outlets leave you wanting more, this place is perfectly situated to allow for easy access to all of the offerings of Freemont Street.

Cons: The disappointment, upon arrival, there is no parking garage.  Self parking happens to be a personal preference (but, I was told that self parking was going to be coming available in the near future).  

The other, more resonating disappointment was the little game that's played with the room rates.  The room was advertised for $49 / night, upon checking in, there's a $20 ""resort fee.""  Really?  Perhaps this can be justified at a 5 star establishment, but, if this place plans to gain any favor with locals, either advertise a $69 room, or knock it off with the resort fee nonsense.  Because, add to that, then there is tax - on each charge individually, bringing the total to $99 at check out!  After some dickering, we were told that the resort fee would be knocked off - only to see it appear back on the card.  The charge is *still* being disputed.   I'm not suggesting that $99 is outlandish for a stay in Vegas, but, had I known, I would have either opted to stay on the strip in a hotel of that caliber and convenience - OR I WOULD HAVE JUST DRIVEN HOME BECAUSE I LIVE HERE!",n7r8WpRboAI1fUcd5dl6MA,2,0,2,YFfjEDHgSvSbGnf_mqiFfw
1386877,2016-03-09,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"To make a long story short, this place has a nightly $22.34 semi-hidden ""experience fee"" on top of their regular rate.

They are charging me for three nights experience fee, even though I modified my reservation, in advance, in accordance with their written terms, and only stayed one night. I notified them of all of this before checking in, and was told I'd only be charged one night of the ""experience fee."" 

I've tried calling them, I've tried having hotels.com (who I booked through) call them, I've been promised callbacks and not gotten them.  Finally, after my fourth attempt on the phone, today their manager Alex concludes they are going to charge me the three nights because their front desk didn't make a record of me checking out after one night (or checking out at all, apparently). 

I've wasted a bunch of time on this nonsense trying to get it resolved, and in a weird way, find it hilarious that they're essentially admitting to overcharging me on the basis of their own incompetence. 

I think their attitude towards resolving customer concerns is embarrassing for a ""hospitality"" establishment. Management fail. 

I hope this bad review costs them much more than the $44.68 they overcharged me. In fact, yelpers, if you're reading this, go stay somewhere else just to vindicate me.",OQxAJ8Rh431rdUqSHSMwHg,10,2,1,CMqvudOklRRsC92P2IgqMA

Before you think I lost my life savings, I actually won $600 more than I spent.

The casino is nice and the rooms are adequate. And most of the staff is actually above average. I had some great conversations with a few of the crew, especially a young lady working the till at the Commissary, early in the morning.

Squirrel! A random thought just passed through my head... the beds are low but kinda soft. I slept like a baby (without all the crying and wetting of diapers).

Okay, this is why I rate it below average...

1. Upon check-in, I was given a room without a working television. (Why maids aren't tasked with checking lights, TVs, ACs, and curtains is beyond me.) After several calls and three lost hours, I was given a different room.

No apology, no ""We'll send up new keys and a bellman,"" no anything! I had to go down to the front desk and ask for the manager WTF and discovered that he had assigned me new keys but hadn't bothered to call my room.

2. The Grand Tower is a PITA.

There is a Casino Tower and a Grand Tower. The Grand Tower is only accessible through a store on ground level or through a series of escalators, stairs, and bridges. And the store (the Commissary) isn't open 24/7. So you literally have to walk across the street, through a lobby, up an escalator, down some stairs, across a bridge... to get to an elevator... OR you can cut through a convenience store (the Commissary, when it's open) to get to elevators.

Really?

3. The Downtown Grand is a block or a block and a half off of Freemont Street. That single block takes you from Park Place and Boardwalk around the corner to Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues. The streets behind the hotel and to the sides are very shady. My female guest said that this was the first time she ever felt unsafe in Vegas.

I prepaid my stay and saved about $30 a night which makes it an even better deal if you know your dates won't change.

The hotel is comfortable and is in two towers. One tower is above the casino and the second is across the street connected by a second floor skybridge (Tip, if you have luggage, walk out the ground floor and across the street to the elevators, it is much faster). The rooms are spacious, comfortable and not dated. There are safes in each room for electronics and there is free wifi which works reasonably well most of the time. 

There are a couple of downsides which knocked off a star for me. The first is that the casino itself is dated, very smoky, and they only have one restaurant which is completely average inside the casino. There is a steakhouse and pizza place across from the hotel but not affiliated. There is a bar in the tower across the street and a ""commissary"" where you can by essentials and snacks but it closes at 10pm and is guarded by a security guard because all the food is out in the open. However, they do not have vending machines at all so you aren't able to get bottled water etc., after about 10pm. Also, if you are on a lower floor of the tower across the street, you'll definitely here the Hogs and Heifers, the bar on the ground floor that is not part of the hotel but under the tower.

The beds are comfortable, the showers are clean, there are no tubs, only showers in the room I stayed in. Carpet is a little dated and worn but the service is exceptional. I like this area of town because it has more of a local, working class feel, not the ""Disney"" feel of the strip. I'll definitely stay at this hotel again.

The casino is small (as noted by other guests)... but that was great for me.  They don't have machines crammed in every available spot and you NEVER feel like other patrons are sitting on top of you!!  I tried out the restaurant on the casino floor (S & O?) and it was good.  Just basic food at basic prices!!  The staff were also attentive and made sure I had everything I needed.  I did walk through ""The Commissary"" a few times.  The place was clean, well maintained, and looked very nice. I plan to check it out the next time I visit.  The hotel also has a ""Grand Promotion"" where they give you back up to $1,000 in losses in free slot play.  The losses must be ""earned"" during the first 24 hours.  You go back after noon the next day they will give you 50% then, 25% in 1-2 months, and 25% in 6 months.  It seems to be identical to the promotion that Palms had a few years ago (they may still have it... not 100% sure).",1oYN6TJquvSnKsZSXPX1_Q,0,0,5,rfm1CBKkQE9jDjZJ-zxPXA

What we liked:
-free water bottles in the room that was replenished daily (huge plus)
-pool area was nice to sit and chill
- we got to the hotel at 11:45 and the receptionist told us if we wait til noon we can check in with no fee, if we checked in at 11:45 there would be a $15 early check in fee. That was nice of her, obviously opted to wait 15 mins. 
- close walk to Fremont area.
-free parking

What we didn't like:
- shower had no door, floor got really wet
- we were on the 8th floor and there wasn't an ice machine on our floor.
- parking lot was on the next block. The walk wasn't far but I prefer on site parking. What I didn't like was the lot had no attendants and it smelled like piss. Elevator was broken and parking did get packed in the evening.

1) Could not get connecting rooms or even on the same floor as the friend I brought. ( even though we checked in about 4:30 on Friday night )
2) The pricing was incorrect on the screen I was expected to sign 
3) Called ahead to advise the pricing was incorrect - your manager told me she would have to pull the call.  If you listen to the call we were on a three way conversation and told a couple of different things.  Over 27 Dollar - Which I can assure you all 5 of us lost more than that in the casino. 
4) We were locked out of the room on Sunday.  I went down to the front desk, to get the room opened, meanwhile the Security guard came down and carded me.  I asked him to let them in, but he informed me I couldn't since I was not there.  (my friend in the meantime almost missed her flight)
5) I was advised I should have added my friends to the room
   a/  I wasn't even asked
   b/   I'm not your employee and you could have asked
6)  I let you know ahead of time it was my birthday and m friends birthday, thus the reason coming out.  Not one person said - Happy Birthday, I received no comps, not even a scoop of ice cream, nothing. 
7)  On Sunday night when we came back to the room - HOUSEKEEPING had straightened the bathroom and made only 1 bed.  I have photos of this already posted on Facebook.  I called down and was told the would send up clean sheets ( so I can change the bed)  Hum, not really why I stayed in your hotel.
8)  I was told by your night front desk, that the Housekeeping Mgr would contact me, I've had no such call.
9)  Ear Plugs - really, ever think of double pane windows 
10)  Not black out blinds, they were fitted incorrectly and leave a gap at the bottom
11)  Small Pool and only open until 8:00pm  - 
12)  Explain your resort fee?  Internet and water?  18.00 a day for this, I think maybe an explanation from our staff would have been more in order.
13) Card center use to be in the front, more open - friendly, happy.  You now have it attached to the cashier and we only got an interaction after we engaged them
14)  Drinks at the bar were good, fast and friendly
15) you have a  Star waitress - I apologize for not having her name Sunday night, long blonde hair.  She was Johnny on the spot, friendly and did a fantastic job!

We came on a small budget for a quick get away and it was either get a new hotel in downtown or stay in a p.o.s spot on the strip and spend more $$$. As you can tell from this review the new hotel won. A block from the Fremont Experience and a short short taxi ride (5-20 min depending on time of day) to the strip this place was a winner. I really enjoyed my stay! The staff was super friendly from check in to check out, the room was perfect and the pool area was the bomb. I was at the pool chillaxing every day. The music was good and the vibe was great! People complain about the shower...big damn deal. It was 100% perfectly fine. This is actually a trend in updated homes in Los Angeles and as a real estate broker I see the half showers almost every day...very nice! People also complain about hearing music from the street. I could hear the music from my room only once.  Again no big deal we still slept fine and also because we were out partying the rest of the nights . Who goes to Vegas for peace and quite? The only thing they could improve on is adding more umbrellas to the pool area. The sun is no joke in VEGAS and brothas can't take all that heat...lol. I will be back! Missing Vegas already!

On this third afternoon, inexplicably, all the tables had a minimum bet of 10 dollars, when all had been 5 dollars on the previous two afternoons.  When I asked the floor supervisor whether there were any 5 dollar tables, I got an impassive stare and was told that all tables were 10 dollar minimum today.  Played the 10 dollar tables and lost an impressive amount of money over a few hours.  Moved to another 10 dollar table, only to see a woman at the table playing 5 dollars per bet.  When I asked about it, she told me that the floor supervisor had told her she could play for 5 dollars (at the posted, 10dollar minimum table).  Really unbelievable, and borderline unethical.  Of course, the floor supervisor, caught in bad behavior, had to let everyone at the table play for 5 at that point, while never changing the 10 dollar minimum that was posted.  A conversation with another supervisor rendered only the feedback that the supervisor ""had the right"" to make those decisions.  So beware, the rules are not the same for everyone.

The place is always clean, the staff is friendly and the rooms are updated.
The prices are super affordable. They also have free garage parking with ticket validation.

The only problem is that if you get a room near Freemont the noise is ridiculous! Is like the Outdoor concerts are happening inside your room, they do offer ear plugs and they are lucky I am a heavy sleeper, but besides that, I really enjoy the hotel. (You could always ask them to put you in a room on the opposite side, where noise is not a problem)

Another thing worth mentioning is that the rooms are pretty basic, there is no coffee maker or really anything besides a TV and an iron. To be honest, this is pretty standard in Las Vegas anyway, for example the Golden Nugget has coffee makers but they charge you $10 for the coffee packets...

Slowest internet ever and I had to go elsewhere to be able to get online. This is the second time we checked in and there was something wrong with the room as in this last time the safe didn't work. After wasting two hours after checking in to have this fixed (battery was dead) this is NOT how I want to start off my stay. Also there was some crusty stuff on the padded headboard!! YUK!!! I told housekeeping about it three times. It was never cleaned. One washcloth in bathroom....NOT 
okay, no fridge not okay, homeless people hanging out in the parking garage right by our new car! Had to pick up booze bottles under and around car everyday! Billing all screwed up on our bill and the manager gave me major attitude. This is NOT okay. Also, light burned out in room entryway. Told the front desk about it when I addressed the safe. Never changed it! Quality control is NOT here. WHO is checking the rooms!!! These things should be checked regularly.
The only plus is it's location some of the time! The music at night is loud. So if you want to go to bed early, good luck. Never heard from the hotel, they have never done anything for us since we started staying here. Even after I told them that we have stayed 3 times and 3 times things were NOT okay they just ignore us. So guess what people, we will ignore them.

I'll take it! THEN with the coupon book we received a whole bunch of match plays. Great deals here and the staff is all very friendly and accomodating!

There was a really noisy group in the room next to us so we called the front desk and they offered to have security go up or do a room switch right away.

First time here and we got here very late and we asked for a late check out- their check out is pretty early at 11AM. I was told quite coldly that they can't do anything till the morning and I should call before 7am which of course defeats the purpose of getting a late checkout and sleeping in late, right? Tried to explain this concept but they just didn't get it. It's ridiculous. Most nice hotels give a little leeway especially when you check in late and explain you've never been to the hotel before and you want to enjoy it... NOPE. I've seen cyborgs have more personality. This hotel really needs a front desk upgrade. Oh- and of course we still have to pay the 18 dollar ""resort fee"" even though we don't really have time to actually enjoy the ""resort"". This just might be my first and last stay here.

Update- Went back late tonight and spoke to Roberto- who like his work mates does not smile and seems to treat his guests with an air of suspicion. Roberto after much haggling agreed to give us one extra hour. I then asked how busy they were on Sunday and he gave me a look like I just asked him if he was now or ever a member of the communist party. He told in a harsh tone that he's not allowed to tell me how busy or not busy there are with a look that was telling me to mind my own business. 

Seriously people what happened to customer service? Not one of these front desk people smiled, welcomed us to their hotel. Told us about the gym or the pool or that we have free internet. Didn't mention there's free water in the room of that there's a happy hour in the bar every day. Nothing. I might as well have just checked into a kiosk. And so now instead of enjoying the hotel all we can talk about is how bad the service is. And now I'm writing all about it to let you Yelp know all about it.

1732067,2014-02-25,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Well I've stayed at a few hotels since I've been in Vegas for a couple of months and the Downtown Grand isn't bad at all. It has a very retro feel to it with the ocean scenic colors. It also has some very modern furniture that I would not expect for the cost of the room. Flat screen tv, full size closet/cabinet and dresser draws. Basically everything you need except for a refrigerator...

The biggest dislikes I have is all those hidden fees. They say free internet but I believe that's part of the hidden $12 daily hotel fee that they failed to mention. Also there's a $50 a day hold for damages if need be. Also if you opt to park across the street at the self parking, be prepared to look over your shoulder in that spooky garage.  

All in all not bad for it to be downtown Vegas. The restaurants in the lobby are what I consider on par with the rest of the Grand experience.",B1C_81Ff1RgIoSIqBM2ocw,5,0,4,OAEChe2RrIKr1QkR7SZPwQ

I can't say I had visited this hotel when it was Lady Luck. I have stayed in enough Downtown hotels to be a little squeamish about how clean our room will be. But I'll have to say it meant our standards. The building is still old, but the rooms are kept well and bathrooms are clean

Booking online, we opted for the one-bedroom king suite. The prices are very affordable, so if your budget can allow it, go for the upgrade. We loved the spacious living room, master room, TVs for both areas, and most importantly, TWO FULL BATHROOMS. Yes, it was just the two of us, but we all know how much us ladies appreciate all the counter space we can get, and the guys appreciate not seeing all of our lotions, make-up, and nicknacks! We loved the red decor of the room, it gave it a modern vibe. And red is my favorite color. *wink*

We requested a quiet room. I think being in its location, it's very hard not to hear the street noise. We were on the 5th floor and we could still hear it, but not enough to keep us awake. I'd suggest to ask for a very high floor if you need more solitude. This was the first hotel that provided ear plugs on your night stand.

Hotel service is A-OK. We requested foam pillows and it took about 1/2 hour. Our maid did a good job with the daily cleaning. Room service is available from their 24hr cafe downstairs. There's no coffee-maker in the rooms, but hotel guests are offered complimentary coffee every morning downstairs in the Commissary, where they also have breakfast, lunch, and a bar. The casino still resembles much of the majority of Downtown casinos, but it's kept clean and orderly. Bartenders and dealers are friendly, The location is great to experience Fremont Experience, you can just valet your car and walk everywhere! That's what we did. Man, I'd forgotten how fun and crazy Downtown night life can get!

Overall, I'd have to say it's one of the nicer places to stay in Downtown. We would definitely book here again!",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,17,13,4,zOBljY7Nr7m-rwLr-0yMYg

Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the slow waitress service taking/bringing drink orders to the table. They could have been short handed and it was a busy Saturday night.

1746145,2014-01-13,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Thank you, Downtown Grand, for making me actually *want* to go to Vegas again! 

Even with an invitation for 2 free nites, my fiancé and I were reluctant (we've come to hate the concrete/neon jungle, and ""poser"" atmosphere that Vegas has become.) And, since we live in Reno, casinos are not a novelty to us - we definitely prefer the mountains to a casino any day!

That said, having never been to downtown Vegas myself, and learning there were no weekend restrictions on our 2-free-nites (plus resort fees were waived), we decided to make the trip.

After reading the Yelp reviews of the Downtown Grand, I kept my expectation in check.... and, boy, were we pleasantly surprised!

We loved just about everything about this property! The reservations, front desk and valet staffs were very friendly and eager to help. We loved our Premium King Room on the top floor (floor 26). It was comfortable, modern with smart decor, quite spacious, and views of the mountains that took our breath away. 

An added bonus is we were just steps away from the Mob Museum, (one of the highlights of our trip!), and just a block from the Freemont Street experience.

I really loved the downtown area and the retro-chic ""old-50's-Vegas"" vibe they are going for - a refreshing change from the strip. 

Even with the ""side-show-like"" atmosphere of Freemont Street, that area has a much more ""authentic"" feel, and the people there seem infinitely more more ""real"" than those on the Vegas Strip. And, without all the congestion of the Mega-casinos, it just felt like you could ""breathe"" in this area. Plus, there's a great art community around the fringes of downtown that was fun to discover as well. 

Some reasons why I loved this hotel:
 1) Fun, modern decor
 2) Comfy bed
 3) Awesome views!
 4) Relatively quiet
 5) Two free water bottles in your room every day
 6) Complimentary sets of ear plugs (two new pair each day) 
 7) Great location - within walking distance of most downtown points of interest
 8) Friendly, helpful staff 
 9) Easy checkin/check out (and no extra charges or hassles for early check-in)
 10) Great value
 11) Separate vanity area with sink across from bathroom
 12) Hotel in separate building from Casino (you don't need to step-foot in the casino if you don't want to!)
 13) Fun, stylish and intimate mexican food court area on the first floor of hotel
 14) Housekeeping took the time to gently organize and tie-up our cell phone chargers that we left plugged in next to the bed
 15) Easy to connect to Free Wifi
 16) Nice desk and plenty of outlets throughout room
 17) Large, flat-screen TV

The only reasons I rated a 4 instead of a 5:
1) No bathtub
2) Heater seemed to have a mind of it's own: on our last morning, it kept reseting itself to warmer than we wanted the room to be after we turned the heat down
3) Large pillows weren't the most comfortable - felt like feather pillows on the inside, but unusually hard and stiff on the outside.
4) 10 mins after we checked in, housekeeping knocked, did not wait for our reply, and walked in on us as we were starting to change* 

(*I quickly forgave this, as having worked in hotel before, I figured the head housekeeper was double-checking that the room had been cleaned properly, and probably hadn't gotten word from the front desk yet that the room had been assigned to an early check-in ... that said ... word-to-the-wise: 
Be sure to engage the security lock and put out the Do Not Disturb sign as SOON as you get in your room!)

Wish List
Would've been a nice touch to include a refrigerator/mini-bar and coffee maker to the room, as there was a nice wet-bar-style area with lots of counter space and large, empty cabinets - but not a big deal to us that they weren't there.

At first, I thought there was no blow dryer. I called the front desk, and one was promptly delivered to the room (along with a sewing kit I requested). Later, I found there was a blow dryer after all - hidden by my clothes, it was in a black clothe bag on a shelf in the closet.

Addressing the Yelp Shower Issue: 
It did seem they had the newer shower heads with lower water pressure (being it's a desert, probably a water-conservation effort), however it seemed a sufficient pressure, and there were no problems with the temperature - it warmed to our liking. It was a bit small, and had a funky open-design without a shower door, but not a deal-breaker by any means. 

Transport
Cab fare to/from the airport is about $29 -- for two or more, that's a bargain and a real time-saver considering a shuttle often makes multiple stops before getting to your property. Cab fare to the east end of the strip (Stratosphere) was about $10; to the West end of the strip (MGM Grand) about $26.

All in all, if/when we ever make it back to Vegas, it'll either be to the outskirts of the town, or back to the Downtown area and the Downtown Grand -- thanks so much for the deal! We will be back!!",NwAnNtza5hZyAaAhO9CvnQ,11,2,4,Ms7MT9UmWGmSYEnEkv5kNg

Brandon, who if I haven't mentioned is a grade A asshole, offers to move me to the room I booked the second night as if he's doing me a favor. I begrudgingly accept because I have no choice at this point. Brandon then sashaes back into his office without the faintest of apologies or attempt at customer service. He literally acted like he did me a fucking favor. So, it gets better. I get a call at 10a from the front desk that I have to be out of that room by 11 in order to get the room I booked sometime between 11-3. Sweet, now let's trek back to the front with all our shit, stow it and go fuck off until they call me when the room I booked is ready. I finally get the room I booked at 130p the next day. I relay this situation to a different front desk person the next day and they admit that the hotel will give away reserved rooms to walk ups and then treat you like they're doing you a favor by throwing you into whatever.

I got a flyer for 2 nights free and took advantage of it.  Everything was free except the $11 a day fee, which a lot of the hotels were doing so I was fine.
The hotel was walking distance to Fremont Street which was nice.  This was my first time in downtown and I like it.  Looser slots.  Less crowd.  True walking distance, you dont have to fight traffic to park in a garage to walk 10 min before getting to the casino.  Location was not at Fremont but a block away so just far enough.
Valet was free and self parking is free but you need to get validation before leaving the hotel.
I booked for a king bed and confirmed 2 times that I will be checking in very late Friday night.  As I get there the lady told me they are out of king begs and asked if 2 queen was fine.  Then she said we can check tomorrow morning and see if any rooms open up.  So I said ok but wasn't super ok.  So she made some phone calls and was able to get me a room in the opposite tower.  
It was no the nosier side but I was tired and can sleep thru noise.  They do give you a pair of ear plugs.  
Bathroom was a stand up shower for our suite.  I looked on the emergency map and it does appears there are some tubs in some room.  We got the corner suite so it was slightly bigger.  
They took away our floor towel the 2nd day so we had to use our bath towel for the floor.  There are no shower doors so it does get wet.  Toilet requires 2 flush and you must hold it down.
There is complimentary water but they decided not to give us water the 2nd day as well.  Not sure why the service was so bad.  I give them the benefit of doubt because if I really wanted I could have asked room service to bring it but I didn't.
The pillows were huge and nice.  Blanket was thin.  AC was loud and room stayed pretty warm.
The renovation made the hotel look new.  My guess is this hotel is more new looking than the others in the area so it was a good transition from the strip for me.",3iSOND_5_LIQSxiYHeNdVg,0,0,4,kuEUmgxW6D6ZzeFVhQPP2A

This year thanks to an offer for a two night complimentary stay I checked into the Downtown Grand - once the Lucky Lady Hotel and Casino. This modern hipster destination, just a short block from the Fremont Street Experience was a pleasant surprise. In fact, the whole block was a surprise after having seen it in a completely different state during my visit this time last year. I was amazed at the transformation from seedy skid row to quaint inter-city block lined with tables and chair that front restaurants, a popular biker bar and shops. Truly a welcomed and needed change to this once neglected area.

Parking is a little tricky, there is only one way to access the front of the hotel and valet parking off Steward - self parking is off Ogden across from the hotel/casino.

Here is where I say, there is nothing like staying in a newly built hotel, everything is so shiny! The rooms are small but nicely done and include a flat screen - beds are pillow topped - yes - and the bathrooms are modern - easy Internet access. Let me not forget to mention the central air - a wonderful thing! They have a nice little diner on the casino floor - Steward and Ogden - where a delicious and reasonably priced meal can be enjoyed. I had breakfast there and it was great. There is the ""Mob Bar"" - it is dark and inviting - you'll have to check it out - I would have hung there if the good jazz band had been a little quieter - leaving the noise of Fremont Street, I would have enjoyed a little lower decibel level in the cozy bar. 

The Casino is fitted with all the newest machines and gaming tables and is lain out in such a way that it is easy to find your way around. There is a lovely shallow pool on the third floor roof and lots of seating along with a picnic area where on selected nights they offer live entertainment. 
 
A couple of things I did not care for. Completely over-priced Cabanas - $350.00 for the day. Hey, guys! That is what The Hard Rock charges, and they have private tents with TVs and small refrigerators plus a real sand beach. You are over priced for what you are offering and quite probably, your clientele's budget. Also please, please give each floor an ice machine and provide more than one room key at check-in. One should not have to chase down their traveling companion every time they want to access the room.

Why does it take 20 minutes to check each person in? We finally get to our room and no refrigerator, no coffee maker! We were not warned of the noise level in this hotel. We were on the 22nd floor and the music was so loud! Then the TV stopped working! I  immediately called the front desk and they said it was an IT issue and would send someone up. After an hour went by, I  called the front desk again and the person who answered had no knowledge that I already called an hour ago! Really???? So I  decided to go downstairs to the front desk and complain about everything that had happened.  The so-called manager immediately had an attitude!  Didn't offer an apology or anything! Her response was, ""I can just check you out and give you a full refund"" REALLY? ??? JUST CHECK US OUT! UNBELIEVABLE and UNACCEPTABLE! Finally after 2 hours the TV was fixed.  The second night, I requested 2 extra pillows  and 2 washcloths  at 5pm. After 5 hpurs, I  called the front desk and again they were unaware that I requested these items 5 hours ago!

1786093,2016-07-04,8,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Whenever my work brings me to Las Vegas, I always choose to stay in the Old Town/Downtown section, because it feels so much more genuine, quiet and peaceful that the much newer and overly-glitzy/hyped Strip section of Las Vegas which is located about 5 miles to the south. While I have stayed over the years at several hotels in Old Town/Downtown, I have, for the past two years, stayed exclusively at the Downtown Grand, which first opened only about 2-3 years ago; it is located in the buildings that had formerly held the old and venerable Lady Luck casino/hotel for about a million years until it closed circa 2012. Downtown Grand then took over the property after it had lain unused for a bit, and renovated and updated it very well, in my opinion.

I just completed a lengthy stay at this hotel, and I had also stayed here for about 10 days back in September of 2015. As with my prior stay, I purposely reserved a sufficiently high-grade room (Premium Non-Smoking) for this stay so that I could request that I be placed once again in a higher-floor room in the Grand Tower, which is the taller tower of the two towers; it is the one located on the west side of 3rd St. My main reasons for wanting a higher-floor room in the Grand Tower was for the view of the mountains to the west, and also because the higher-floor rooms in this tower are very quiet -- the noise from Fremont Street and nearby outdoor concerts barely reaches these rooms. 

As was true of my first stay at this hotel a few months ago, my stay here was great. Check-in was easy and fast, the rooms are large and clean, and the housekeepers are very friendly and helpful. Oh, and the hallways are all very wide and clean, and there are a number of large and very fast elevators available. 

I am a non-smoker, and I can report that even when I took shortcuts through the casino -- which is located on the ground floor of the hotel on the east side of the street -- to reach the street or to grab a taxi, I really never smelled any tobacco smoke. Likewise, whenever I have eaten meals at the S&O restaurant (located also on the east side of the street, and just feet from the casino), I have never been bothered by smoke. 

My check in at a bit past 5 PM, which occurred during a rather busy time for the front desk, was quick, smooth and effortless. This is one of the very few hotels in the US of which I am aware that uses a very modern front desk check-in system, one that also features a small touch-screen keypad device for use by customers in signing/okaying various options during check-in. As a result, check-in is very quick and easy. The front desk staff always seems to be very competent and quite helpful. 

The rooms are very large, at least compared to the size of hotel rooms back on the East Coast. The bathrooms in the hotel rooms are also very large. 

The main in-house food and meal options are, aside from room service ordering, the aforementioned S&O restaurant located near the casino on the ground floor of the hotel on the east side of 3rd street, and The Commissary, located on the ground floor on the west side of 3rd street. The hotel also operates a steak house called something like Triple George just a few feet down 3rd St. from The Commissary, and it also leases space to a large and rather famous pizza restaurant (yes, they have slices to go also...) located a bit further down the street from Triple George steak house. The hotel also leases space to a rather large biker bar, located between the steak house and the pizza restaurant.

BTW, if you crave brains as I do, I must tell you sadly that NEITHER restaurant located inside the hotel offers any brain dishes, nor do either the Triple George steakhouse, nor the nearby Pizza Rock pizza restaurant. What a shame! So, if you often need to eat brains, and particularly brain tacos, as do I, then you will need to visit one of the Vegas locations of Tacos El Gordo; the nearest shop is located just about two miles from the hotel, on East Charleston. 

As was true for my first stay as well, I requested a loaner fridge for my room, and it was promptly provided, and it worked just fine. In short order, I filled it with brain tacos from Tacos El Gordo on East Charleston.

Monica is the person whom you will usually reach if you call Housekeeping on the hotel phone, and she is very helpful and very competent.  

WiFi service was, as always, great and trouble-free. 

There is usually a taxi queue waiting outside the main entrance to the hotel located just off N. 4th St. This is very handy for grabbing a cab quickly. 

The hotel offers guest laundry service through their outside laundry contractor; both dry cleaning and regular laundry are available. The vendor picks up laundry once per day from Housekeeping at the hotel at 9 AM, and returns the cleaned laundry to the hotel at 5 PM. I used the service for regular laundry late in my long stay, and the fee was very reasonable. The laundry service did a perfect job.

Will return.",Ariwz06at3CtbWZM-gPMAg,17,10,5,RrCbOTjRf_e8wN4g7Eyr2g

There is valet parking for about $7 but the parking garage, which was actually clearly labeled if you took a second to read, wasn't far at all.

Some say the parking garage was scary, but it wasn't. Sure it's dirty, but I didn't see any sketchy people in the structure at all. It's downtown Vegas this is not the strip. Those complaining may have never been anywhere remotely ""rough"" before. It's not THAT BAD and had arrived at 11pm.

The lobby and restaurants look pretty new. It is right across from a few eateries/bars. I prefer this hotel over the old rooms in the golden nugget. Our room was clean! I liked the bridge leading to the hotel elevators because it had a nice view of the mob museum. 

You get bottled waters for each day, free parking in the structure with validation so hang on to that ticket. 

If you are sensitive to noise, they give you ear plugs. I didn't hear my neighbors at all, but I could hear the music down in Fremont or the bars. I think that went on till 12am? Either way it didn't bother me.

The shower is only half a glass. Weird but didn't bother me. Low water pressure though.

As many of these older, refurbished hotels go, there is still a faint but distinct odor of cigarette smoke in the room. Noticeable, but tolerable.

On Sept 6 I was downtown gambling at your establishment between 10pm and  12 midnight with my boyfriend. An older man was hailing cabs for two couple when we got there. Cabs were flying by and it took him a while to get three cabs for the groups ahead of us so there was plenty of time for him to realize he needed to get another cab. Once the two groups ahead of us were on there way he turned around, acknowledged my boyfriend with a ""hello how are you doing"" and continued walking into the little valet box and into another door. He never told us to wait a minute or that he would be right back. We waited for a few minutes confused and not really sure what was happening. When I asked the gentleman standing inside the valet office what was happening he just gave me a blank stare. Ten minutes later and nothing. I got pissed off and just walked to the street and hailed my own cab which seemed much easier than being ignored by one of your employees. As we pulled off he walked out and chatted with the valet. I will never return to your establishment to gamble or otherwise since you let your employees treat people like this. I hate bringing up race but the other groups were Caucasians and seemed to receive great service. As we walked away another minority couple mentioned that the same happened to them and they were guests of the hotel. We come to vegas and stay at much nicer hotels(Mandalay, Palms, Palazzo) and have never been even remotely treated like this. Don't stay at this hotel.

1850561,2018-01-29,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,Very nice and clean hotel! The first time i came here was for the Capital Cities Pool party during Life Is Beautiful festival. So this time around I decided to stAy here this past Thursday and Friday there were a couple of conventions going on but i ended up booking it a few days before coming and got a great deal cheapest rooms I actually found too. This hotel is extremely clean and all the staff were friendly. We were the 7th floor and facing the bars they own on the same street. It honestly was that loud or i guess it didn't bother me and I'm a super light sleeper and they provided you with ear plugs but i didn't need them. Also its going to be loud your close to Freemont street and bars. I wouldn't expect anything less its vegas. As far as coffee makers and refrigerators alot of vegas hotels dont even offer these as amenities but you can rent one I believe. Just bring a cooler! I will say did stAy at Main Street casino and brewery and they did have a fridge with was a nice surprise but Downtown Grand is a much nicer hotel and has awesome incentives too. They have a daily slot tournament that you get a free spin that last a minute and then the next day you check to see if you won any money. Kicker is everyone wins! Free money why not! My boyfriend won 40 bucks from the free money he got! Im pretty sure we also got free money when we signed up to with their players club. I will say the 24/7 freedom beat restaurant the service could be a little better. Also you can get 50% off one a day on specific menu items. There is a computer kiosk by and you print off your 50% off. The bar in the middle of the casino has dos xx but the freedom beat does not. The bathroom only has half a glass but water doesnt all over the place and the toilet does look like something of a public restroom but who cares probably easier to fix than an regular toilet. All and all the hotel is clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean the beds were comfortable. People focus to much the little things that don't matter its VEGAS! Ive stayed all over vegas and I highly suggest this hotel and plus its so close to freemont street so you dont get all the noise that the hotels on freemont street get!

We are arriving June 30th and checking out on July 2nd. We have free rooms for June, July and August. They would not honor our free nights because it is 2 different months. We kept our rooms at The D they honored our free rooms with them. I called the Californian and Binions Casino and they all would have honored or rooms with them also. Even thought they were 2 different months. They said as long as the first day was in June they would use the June offer. I was willing to forfeit the June and July offer, but was told no.

I am going to miss S&O (I like the street name reference).WIll reserve judgement of the new restaurant once it is complete.  I think they could do something great with the Mob Bar area because everyone has to walk back that way to get to the elevators. Wish they could figure that out. 

The POOL is AWESOME!! Though I wish the water was not so cold, we still spend all day out there. Sometimes there are too many kids, but what can you do. The ladies are ALL so helpful and quick with their service. One thing I notices this year is that some locals were camped out. That was a bit weird.

4 for the hotel - 1 for the service. 

We got an upgrade from expedia points. The room was big, clean, overall pretty, big bathroom, but the shower doesnt have a door, kind of awkward and not very practical. The room wasn't really loud and they provide you earplugs in case of big party - It's Vegas after all. The view sucked but can't have it all I guess ? 
They have everything you need like in all good hotels.
The pool area is nice but beware the pool is so hot it's more like a Jacuzzi.
The hotel is well located downtown and not in the very noisy Fremont street.
The restaurant is good enough and prices are ok.

Now the bad stuff.
So there is the $20 ""resort fee"" including wifi pool and fitness. 
First night was a friday and a pool party was advertised everywhere. We got ready and showed up, but the doors were closed. ""Oh ya it got cancelled"". No explanations, no apologies. 

My boyfriend phone didn't get the wifi, so after a day we talked to the front desk, his answer was ""change your phone, I can't do anything"". Lol, ok.

Then one night we came down to grab some food at the restaurant and only one elevator was working, it took us 15 minutes to go down. so we talked to the front desk that said ""yes 2 are broken"". Didnt seem bothered by that fact. Ok.
When we went to go back to the room around 20 people were waiting - The last elevator broke too. So I asked were the stairs were, no one knew. 
Someone said he would reach help but didnt. 
After a good half an hour I found a staff member and he finally called someone for help in front of me. We were now maybe 30 people waiting.
Someone got tired of this ridiculous situation and took us to the service elevator.

So the next day we complained to the front desk and asked to not pay the resort fee. A lady was trying to help us and was about to call a manager, when ""Skylar"" took over the situation, asking ""what is the problem ? So if I understand well you got back to your room after all right ? So what is the problem ?""
So rude and unprofessional. Do get that at that point no one reacted nor apologized. 

We did got one night of resort fee comp but honestly after the way this woman treated us that didn't feel right at all. 
I can understand that the wifi may be weak, I can understand a cancelled pool party and even (3) broken elevators, but the lack of reaction and professionalism I can't.

This is a shame because this hotel has a lot for itself and I was really happy about my choice at first, but those incidents in 3 days is too much.",EFfuBWGQ1xoBxf1CA6pTFg,5,1,2,jSdeThAze9sBD1AXADnY1w

First, parking is a pain in the butt. We parked in the muti-level lot and had to drag all of our things across the street to check in.

While walking the hallways, I was impressed with the furniture and art. The outside decor was nice and staylish, but the room was drab. We stayed in a king and everything looked .... okay ... but it wasn't as nice as the hallways. We had a room on the 15th floor with a view of ....  the hotel across the street.

1941690,2017-12-31,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"For a hotel that bears the name, I don't see anything ""grand"" about it. It looked and felt like a regular hotel for us. 

We stayed for 4 days, 3 nights. Stayed at the Grand Tower. Elevator can be confusing. To get to the Grand Tower, you can either take the escalator, turn left, walk through the ""bridge"" connecting the two towers and then take the elevator to your room. Or, you can take the ground floor elevator to the 3rd floor, walk through the ""bridge,"" etc. 

Room is clean. Due to its close proximity to the Freemont Street Experience, yes, it can be loud (outside) at night. Earplugs were provided. The ""noise"" did not really bother us at all. It's coming from either the bars or Freemont Street. It's live band music ""noise,"" so it can be entertaining. It's subjective. 

Comfortable bed. I wish they have extra pillows. We did not bother asking, so I'm not bothered by it. 

Bathroom is ok. It's a little weird taking a shower though. No shower doors!!! We had to be extra careful to not wet the bathroom floor too much. Water pressure was good enough. 

Time to time we would here this grumbling noise. It totally sounded like that grumbling noise your stomach makes when you're hungry.  Could it be plumbing????? No idea. 


Ground floor has casino, restaurants, bars. It's right across the Mob Museum, and walking distance to the Freemont Street Experience. Lots of restaurants/bars within walking distance. Complimentary parking (across the street). 

Rooftop pool. Very spacious area to hang out with decent size pool. 

Friendly staff.

So I was going to see if there were other rooms in the area as I couldn't stay in a pot smoke filled room. When I looked on line there were several rooms available at this same hotel. So I don't know why Tim lied to me instead of helping me. I took my bag and walked back to the front desk and told a young lady that our room smelled like pot and she immediately and nicely gave us a new room. Not sure why Tim couldn't help me.

Or so we thought, this is a nice hotel but being nestled on third street next to a biker bar was a little sketch especially when on the second morning we were here there was a shooting and four people were brought to the hospital. Really great place to be with your 7 month old. I get it, it's Vegas. But it doesn't leave you comfortable about leaving the hotel. 

Gambling is good and the restaurant availability is decent as well. But overall if you're looking for a high priced meal you will find it in Las Vegas. $5-$6 for oatmeal?? Come ooonnnn. 

The set up was slightly confusing at first, valet was a joke and the free parking is in a sketchy garage across the street, so lugging all of our luggage and a baby and a playpen down the parking garage through the casino was enough but then we learned we were directed incorrectly and ended up on the wrong side of the hotel,  there was no one available to let us know about the sky bridge crossover. We ended up bringing our 7 month old and her stroller up the escalator. But once we figured out the set up we were golden! 

The pool atmosphere is great and the pool is refreshing, really cold at first but refreshing overall. Drinks are overpriced especially with that resort fee but whatever we just went to the room a few extra times to get drinks. 

Speaking of resort fee, oofdah we haven't even checked out yet and I'm dreading that, not to mention that I just learned that we were not informed of the wifi passcode so four days here and checking out tomorrow and I haven't used a perk of that resort fee.

It was my bday weekend so it sounded like an awesome idea cause it's free and I had stayed there before. First thing I noticed was the valet had started charging $11 a day on weekdays and $7 on weekends, that was a red flag from the start! What hotel in Vegas charges valet? None! 3 nights in a row they took over 20 minutes to bring out my truck and they couldn't find where they had parked it. I let it slide until the last day when me and my party woke up at 4:30am to beat traffic and be on the road by 5:00am. I get to valet and the guy tells me my 2015 Cadillac Escalade wouldn't start?

I spoke with management and they resolved the issue but I did not leave the hotel until 6:15am and I got traffic back to LA. Lastly when Checking out from the hotel they gave me three free nights and didn't want to compt me the four night stay and the hostess said "" I was lucky I got three night stay"" what service and promotion is that.

Check-in service was quick amd professional. The room service staff was also quick to bring us our towels when asked. The hotel even gave us a later check out time when requested. The hotel and casino itself was clean and less ""smokey"" than other hotels. 

Reason for the - 2stars is the design of the bathroom and lack of Internet even though it was promised on the package when booking the room. One of the light bulbs by the entrance was out, the curtain was torn and the bathroom toilet splashed water all over the seat cover every time we flushed. Apparently the bathroom was handy cap accessible so there's only half a glass covering the shower. The other half was exposed so water splashed everywhere. It's a great idea for people with wheel chairs, but it would have been even better if they included a shower curtain to allow more options. The thing that was a big no-no for us was the lack of Internet. There was a malfunction with provider,  and the hotel could not do anything bc the service had been outsourced.

However, the downside is the parking situation. You have to leave the hotel to self park and then walk your luggage across the street to get to the hotel. That's a pain especially if it is too hot or raining. True there is free Valet parking, but still...that's a bummer.
The other thing is the Casino. It's okay for a Casino to be small, but there is no way to win or enjoy a good time because all you do is lose. Even at the tables. I never ever ever heard someone even yell a winning hand or a winning slot machine.  It's ridiculous.  I mean we went with a party of 7 people and NONE of us actually even won $1.00 in the the slots or the tables. It was like constant losing.  Which always gives me a bad feeling of the Casino doing something ""Odd"" when so many people are losing.   
Other than that the experience with the room and cleaning service was good. Not great but good. Will I stay there again?  Hmmmm maybe not, unless the casino experience suddenly increases.

OH OH OH...AND ON TOP OF THE STOLEN ITEMS...the hotel bathroom shower door is non existent.  So most of the shower water will trickle out onto the floor making it dangerously slippery.

2157096,2018-05-10,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Recently returned from a 4 day stay at this hotel.  Normally I'd choose to stay somewhere along The Strip or nearby but hotel prices were unusally high that 4 day weekend....turns out I'd forgotten about Cinco de Mayo.  I'd chosen The Grand because I thought it was a good deal.
The rooms were nice, big and clean.  

Customer service could be better...check in was as expected. Front desk call at night took a while to be answered, then was placed on hold a quite a long while, which I gave up and hung up. Another night wanted to order room service...got a recording that all agents were busy and will assist me as soon as they can.  I waited for about 10 minutes then gave up also.

The noise level was an issue for me.  Of course it's not the hotel's fault what kind of characters they get for their guests.  But the walls were extremely thin and I ended up having extremely noisy neighbors who'd played loud music on their boombox after midnight, yelled and screamed and pounded on the wall and dresser. Luckily they left about a bit after and returned about 5 am with more noise.  The hotel is also 2 blocks from the Fremont Street Experience so all through most of the day, and especially at night, you'll hear the thudding of the bass from the music.  Please note: they do provide you with ear plugs (on the bedside table).

Parking was not the most convenient nor pleasant.  Situated across the street from the hotel and given that it's the downtown area, it was dirty.  Homeless sleep in the doorway by the elevator, while drunks and druggies or questionable characters hang out around the parking building and entrance into the garage.

2168619,2014-03-03,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This was the first time I'd ever stayed in one of the Downtown hotels, and I was a little nervous. Being a fan of the Strip, I prefer my hotels to be newer, clean, and modern. Overall, the Downtown Grand did not disappoint! Although probably a little more expensive than some of the other hotels Downtown  ($120/night + $11 resort fee), I feel as though it was a great value for the money. It is pretty well located, right across from the Gold Spike, near the Mob Bar and Pizza Rock. 

The hotel itself is very modern and clean. They definitely spent some time and effort on the remodel and it shows. It is very close to being a ""boutique"" hotel. Getting into the valet area was a little confusing, and I guess there are two towers, , but those are small things. Check in was smooth and easy.

The room itself was really pretty! It isn't a very large room, but the decor was very lovely. Everything was overall clean, but there was a pretty big red stain right by the door (as if someone spilled paint, and it never came out of the carpet). There is a large flat-screen tv, with lots of channels, and the bed was very comfortable. They also provide you with earplugs, which I thought was a great touch, since it does get pretty loud downtown. (they weren't very effective, but it was a good idea anyway).

The only downside of the room was the bathroom. While it looked very modern and inviting, it really wasn't practically designed. The shower was particularly poorly set up. There is only a 1/2 glass door, so the back half of the shower is open. That is unpleasant for a few reasons. One- I felt like I never got a hot/steamy shower! Even though the water was warm enough, I shivered through my shower because of the draft coming in from the open space. 
Two- having the open shower means that water gets on the floor! It wasn't like a flood or anything, but it was a bit irritating.  The sink also was not very practically designed. It was one of those large, shallow sinks, rather than a deep sink, which also meant that water splashed on the counter and if you need a full basin of water- it isn't happening. 

The beds and pillows were very comfy, but they don't give you a blanket/bedspread/comforter. I'm sure that I could have called down to housekeeping to get one, but I wish that one had been provided somewhere in the room. 

One other thing that was pretty neat is that you can text down to valet with your ticket number, and they will bring your car around! They send you a reply text with an ETA, and when you come out at the appointed time- your car awaits! I thought that was a great service, and I hope this catches on at all of the hotels.

We also visited the 24 hour sportsbook deli/cafe in the wee hours of the night and got a quick meal. It was delicious! We just got fries and sandwiches (I got the ham, egg, and cheese croissant), and it was really yummy.

Very clean, new or refurbished 2nd tower where my wife and I honeymooned. The bed seemed newish, room was clean and had an art decor kinda flair. It was modern, clean and stylish. Staff was minimal. 
Location: it is at the beginning of the ""Fremont Street Experience"". Which was fun and a very short easy walk around the area. There wasn't any riffraff , but the downtown original Las Vegas is being revitalized. The city has spent some money in that area. It is obvious. The strip is nice, but quite a different feel than downtown Las Vegas. Each area should be enjoyed. 
We were in room 1938 in the newer 2nd tower. We didn't eat at the hotel or gamble so we can't comment there. I took away 1 star because of a lack of friendliness or welcoming to their establishment. I own a business and am quite friendly with my customers. I understand how far courtesy and respect to patrons goes! Nice rooms though in the new tower on the 19th floor.

2198060,2016-01-04,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Stayed for New Years Eve weekend.  We had read some of the reviews but it was too late to change. The noise from below is deafening.  We were on the 25th floor.  You can feel and hear the bass drums and guitar. Ear plugs don't help. We were out late New Years Eve so we missed it, but the other nights it was almost 2 AM before the bands stopped playing. The showers suck. The shower heads water pressure is very light.  The vertical piece of glass does not stop the water from spraying the floor behind it where it is open.  The fitness room is three pieces of equipment.  The parking sucks having to go back and forth across the street to park or retrieve your car and walk down the piss-covered stairs. ONE PLUS- The 'commissary' is great for breakfast and coffee although the idiot cook brought out other people's orders who came in after I did.  No tip for you dumb ass.  The rooms need updating. Not even a freaking microwave or refrigerator to warm food or chill drinks.  They make sound-proof windows for cars, why not this hotel?  The casino downstairs sucks too. Old machines and old waitresses.  However, one of the black-jack female dealers was very courteous to us. Biggest complaint was a couple (could have been a pimp and employee too) was having a huge fight for 20-30 minutes at 645 in the morning, and it took security forever to kick them out.

2199224,2017-03-28,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I took a chance on this hotel mostly because of location (and a friend's recommendation). It is centrally located between all the activities planned for the weekend. I'm not a drinker or gambler so I had planned museums, concerts and shows for my trip. The Mob Museum was literally across the street. The National Atomic Testing and Neon Museums are minutes away and Freemont Street is down the block. It was easy access to the freeway and even though there's free self parking we chose to valet since it was only $7 a night (charged to the room)!!

I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the check-in process or how the staff was rude but I had a pleasant experience with every single person I spoke with. The entire staff was grade A in my opinion. Checking in/out was super smooth and the room was really clean. I'm a non-smoker so I requested a higher floor to get a way from the smell and get a nice view. I have a very sensitive nose and I hardly noticed the smoke, even walking through the casino. They put me on the ""quiet"" side of the hotel since the music from Freemont Street is so loud but it can still be heard. I don't think there's any avoiding that but it wasn't loud enough to disrupt my sleep. I was on the 24th floor. There's free earplugs on the nightstand but I had no need for them. The beds were very comfortable (2 queens) & we had unlimited free water. We didn't eat in the restaurants but requested a mini fridge for extra cost since we brought our own food. Coffee drinkers could get a $1 cup downstairs in one of the restaurants that has unlimited refills until 10am.

The only downsides to this hotel are: the mini fridge was dented and door was broken but I'm sure they would've replaced it had I bothered to ask, no coffee pots in the room and there's only ONE SHOWER DOOR! I'm sure it's because too many drunk people kept falling through! Wasn't necessarily a problem, just weird and water got all over the floor. All in all, this hotel was very pleasant and I'll definitely be staying here again. 

Normally I don't leave reviews but I figured more people take time to leave the negative rather than the positive and I took a lot of time researching all my destinations for this specific trip. If this review is helpful to the next ""me"" than I'm glad I could help :)

Also, I had trouble finding this on my maps. So I searched for the Mob Museum to get me there or maybe the next person can try The Lady Luck Hotel & Casino since that was the prior name.",z-zQ7d0Sm6bhRcWsaMVEsw,5,1,5,LbH_NCzJ-oCGBtc4PLanjQ

The Valet is awesome. I don't understand some of the poor reviews. Obviously Valet was free when I stayed here but it was also free when I just came to play once. The ability to text when you want your car & be texted when it is ready is awesome. The rooms are nice except for the shower half door.

2221293,2015-04-15,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"A big part of the star rating has to do with price.   Did the premium room for about $45 a night.   If it was $100+ per night, then this would be 3 star.   It's all relative.   The night we checked in, the going rate was about $250.  If I had paid that much, the rating would be 2 stars or less. 

They did a nice job updating the hotel.   Very boutique and almost posch.   But you could also tell that the bones were still the old lady luck.   Low ceilings, small gaming floor, and it is down town.   

The room was nice (paid a few extra dollars for the premium room.)  Roomy, clean, well decorated.   Bathroom had dual sinks, the funky half shower door, nice TV.   Room faced Freemont Street and the music was noticeable in the room which went somewhere between 11pm and 1am depending on the night.   The room did come with ear plugs which you would need.   I always travel with my own set and they were needed. 

The good: cheap, clean, easy valet and you  could text a few minutes before heading down and your vehicle would be ready (and it actually worked!).   Restaurant was decent.   Good basic gaming floor with $5 blackjack. 

The bad: rooms not well sound insulated.   Wi-Fi was unusable.   Located downtown with a crappy drive down Las Vegas Blvd to get to the main strip.   Long walk from parking to room.   

Things to note: not very busy and was lacking the usual ""vibe"" of a strip hotel.   Good if you like downtown and want a slower pace.   Walking distance to a lot of down town things.   $18+tax resort fee... Not sure what this was for.   Pool looked like fun. 

In summary: if I can't find a good deal on a strip hotel,  and these guys had another good rate, I would consider another stay.   I did really miss being able to walk down stairs and be in the middle of everything on the strip.   Every day we were driving back to the strip for things to do.  Someone mentioned about needing to validate parking each time.   We didn't have to.   We just kept the same claim slip each time we parked and we were good to go.  Again mentioning the text to pick-up, awesome! I wish more places had this.   The vehicle was always waiting for us when we walked out the door.

I've stayed at the grand a few times over the last few years. My last visit was two years ago which was great. When I called for casino host he was able to give me a really good deal for two nights for my wife's birthday vs online/Booking. It's really hard to rate this review it would've been a five star trip until the last days. 

My room was the city view suite which comes with a Jacuzzi large tub so I used it. After I was done in the water drained out I noticed ......it's really hard to explain that's why I took pictures. 

Truly I don't even want to think about what it is but basically it was poorly maintained and I don't think used often due to the pictures.

When I was checked out I complained the Person at the front desk made it seem like it wasn't a big deal. I showed him the pictures and ask him what do you think of it ! He agreed he would not be happy. 

He did a credit my full stay and I think I had $21 for beverages. I ask for that he said he would have to put in a request. I will see you in the next few days. He said he would bring this matter up with the housekeeping manager. Ok good!

The sad part is there was no even effort to try to keep me as a customer. I would have a manager over. Offered free breakfast on my way out. Try to take me up from being upset too maybe happy.
Free 2 tonight's.....ect

The grand I remember knew you when you sat down at the table to gamble you have that one on one which is very hard to find a Vegas.  There has been many changes on the last two years.

They took the commissary out and turned it into some kind of game and bar thing Friday and Saturday only ,close the rest of the week nothing in there-Who made that decision losing money$$! The food they have been there before was great affordable oh yeah and they took out their own little shop store and put vending machines-They were high tech. WTF ....You can't pay somebody $10 an hour to have personal one on one service......


I felt like there's a lot of cutbacks ,less personnel, I don't want to search for somebody for Assistance I'm on vacation. They  tried turning the Café  into a hip kind of food truck restaurant??? Very small menu......ok The only thing I like was loaded fries and 

Gaming -the machines were a lot tighter. Lots of tables closed. They are limited on the table games to start with.  if you have a game it should be open one player or zero players!!!!!! Cutbacks 

I think it's time to move on to a new location!

Then once you accomplish this and ask for the validated parking they not only deny you but laugh in your face for believing such a gullible tall tale.

I have lived in Las Vegas since 2008 so I am extremely familiar with the hotels on the strip, in addition to that I was a travel agent here for three years. Each year I do something on the strip for my birthday, but this year I knew I wanted to do a suite and I wanted to try one downtown because of all of the renovations downtown had gone through. 

We booked a suite at the DG for my birthday party. My DP and I passed out about three in the morning on top of the covers, the next morning we woke up and decided we were going to be intimate with each other. We pulled back the covers off the bed and there was a large circle of dried blood on the sheets on his side of the bed, and a smaller blood stain on my side. He immediately asked me if I was the one bleeding, we checked and I was not. 

I instantly called down to the front desk to tell them what happened and the complaint was pushed back on me, that maybe someone was bleeding the night before, and why didn't I check my sheets when I checked in. EXCUSE ME, what kind of question is that. 

The director of housekeeping came up to my room and inspected the bed and knew right away these sheets had been here and apologized for what was happening. After some back and forth I did receive a full refund of my room price (which I did the legwork on) and was offered a free night in another suite at the hotel (which I declined) and all of my meals that we had in the hotel to be comped (which did not happen because we paid cash, and apparently the hotel did not take me at my word where we ate).

I submitted a formal complaint to the Nevada Board of Health and I wrote a complaint to the Governor's office. 

This experience forever changed my opinion of this hotel and I would never recommend them to anyone and have already shared this story to every person who has asked me how my birthday party was.",hQ_PtIjdnssuG2xXi5XjTw,12,1,1,Ert_RAnec2x_vi0OpXsfIQ

Plus they say you get two bottle of waters each day, well that was a lie, we got it for two days, then they refused it all together and said it was only on day one! Make up your mind! Then... The cherry on top. On the last day we leave around 11 am come back at 9 pm to find our room was never attended to. I call housekeeping, they say... Oh sorry be right up. 45 min pass no one comes! Oh but wait i call the front desk, say hey its really late we check out early tomorrow, just send up towels, sure they say. 20 min later I get towels. Yes! Finally sleep. 11:35 pm.... Knock, knock.... HOUSEKEEPING!!!! ... Are you kidding me! If you stay please be aware of the chaos!

Then let me move on to the water pressure of the shower, we stayed in room 1531 and the pressure was a joke! I think if my husband spit at me, I would have gotten a little more wet! 

Then the commissary we wanted a coffee and a hot chocolate. Long story short they couldn't ring us up after multiple attempts and the manager got so frustrated he just turned around and said it's on us. He himself was very rude to the workers that were trying hard to figure out all the chaos, I actually felt bad for the two girls that were working.

We redeemed two comp nights at the DG August 27-28 and they placed us in the Grand Tower. The lobby is small, but beautifully decorated and check-in was quick and friendly. Rooms were great, but the commute to the Grand Tower sucks! You have to go behind the check-in desk and use a very steep escalator, which is quite tricky to traverse with oversize luggage!! Do yourself a favor and do NOT get stuck in the Grand Tower if you can help it, it's quite a jaunt!

Having said that, everything in the room and about the hotel in general was simply fabulous. Rooms were larger than I'm used to in Downtown, exceptionally clean and the bed was very comfortable. Linens were not overly heavy and the pillows were firm and plentiful. Bathroom was large, clean, and nicely appointed. Shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion are provided and smell wonderful. Plenty of towels were provided, hot water was plentiful, and the water pressure was splendid. Air conditioning worked magnificently (An absolute necessity for the August Vegas heat).They also give complimentary bottles of water and have free Wi-fi, some great perks!

We ate twice at Stewart and Ogden on the casino floor and the food was very good, especially the flank steak and eggs breakfast I ordered! Service was good and the restaurant was nicely decorated. 

The casino is large, clean, and you can barely detect any smoke. Game selection is plentiful, and they had no shortage of newer games. I played enough to end up getting $5 off one of our meals at Stewart and Ogden, and ended up walking away with money- always a plus! 

Plenty of restaurants surround the DG if you don't want to eat at S&O, we had an early dinner at Pizza Rock (excellent), and the Triple George Grill is right outside as well. You are a mere one block away from the Fremont Street action, and the walk takes no time whatsoever. 

Valet service was quick and friendly, and we never had any trouble retrieving our car. 

All the staff we ran into were very friendly, and since my Other Half is a frequent visitor to the DG, several of them remembered him specifically, that's a very nice touch. 

Overall, I can't think of a reason NOT to stay at the Downtown Grand- fast, efficient, friendly service, excellent rooms, a fabulous casino, and access to delicious on-site/nearby restaurants are my ideal requirements for a return visit.

Effective Sept 1st, even guest (unless you are on highest tier of the players card) valet parking is $7. My friends and I spend at min $50 a day at the pool for drinks and as much as over $300. Now we have to pay for valet service and the parking deck (same price). The new management is mistaken that this is the ""right"" thing to do. I can go to the pool at Mandalay and valet for free (and swim for free). I can valet at almost every other hotel downtown (exception being the D) for free. I alway tip well, but if I have to pay $7 I'm not tipping. People that work valet will suffer, as they rely on tips as the bulk of their salary. I'm not sure why the change but management, this is Vegas and we don't expect to pay for parking. It's petty and you will lose business. You change your guests a resort fee of $20 for Internet, pool and whatever else constitutes ""resort fee"", that should include free parking. The Grand Experience and catering to locals (as you express on fb is slowly disappearing. The 3rd street experience that has gained popularity amongst locals to come to your corner of Fremont/Downtown is becoming no more. As a local I've recommended your hotel to my out of town guests in the past as well have paid cabana fees and eaten in your restaurant many times. Please consider changing your policy or modifying to make it more Grand.",RXgw_3pfAHY3a4gMFlfWPg,1,0,1,8w-i4tbCX7J4C1gjOeOPsA

I am only writing this review because Sarah H. did respond to my initial review, however, when I called the front desk to see if they could get us into another hotel pool, Preston, the front desk mgr. said he would call me back and didn't. Bad customer service. I called him back the next day, another almost 80 degree day and he simply said, ""oh, I forgot"". Really, how do you forget to call a guest back when you said you would and now both of their days were lost. Sorry, I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but we simply didn't receive the type of service you expect from a hotel, which is customer service 101. If you say youre going to call them, call them! The 2nd day  when I called him back, Preston said, ""the Nugget charges $15 for non-guests to use their pool"" however he didn't call me back to inform me. They didn't offer to pay the $15 or think that we would of paid it ourselves so he just ""forgot"" to call me.  I would of paid the $15 to enjoy a day at a pool. Just sayin!

(Resort fee an extra $23, but that's a lot better than most Vegas hotels.)  Fine for the amount of time we spent there.  I thought the half door on the shower (that seemed to bother other reviewers) was fine, and a lot better than a billowing old shower curtain.  The mattress was comfortable for me, but my husband's a big guy and he wasn't a huge fan.  No noise problem at all, but we were there mid-week and Freemont St. may be louder on the weekends.  Ate twice at the lobby restaurant and food was good and reasonably priced (for a hotel) too.

In general, the place struck me as well-run, a phrase I don't use much anymore.  Very friendly and accommodating staff, prompt service.

My only quibbles:  We reserved a smoking room and had to downgrade to get one.  My brother wasn't able to get one at all by the time he checked in.  (Realize this won't be a problem for most people, but hey -- in Las Vegas?)  Also, be aware that the casino is small, with a lot of video penny machines.  If that's your thing, you'll have fun (my daughter loved the giant ""Sharknado"" machine) but serious slot players will have to take the short walk (two blocks, give or take) to Fremont.

Bottom line -- I would happily stay here again.  It's a smaller property than most Vegas behemoths, and I think that fact makes you feel a little less like a minor cog in a giant money-eating machine.",IP-jyORomTv6lhc6KOpMmw,2,1,4,XxkjxJBH9gfZM_tZDAOKiw

It's kind of assumed that hotels not on the LV Strip will be older, run down, etc, but The Grand was beautiful!  Upon checking in we received a coupon book good for % off meals within the hotel and just outside at Triple George, Pizza Rock, and coupons for Hogs & Heifers as well as discounts at the Mob Museum.  We had a room on the 18th floor overlooking Hogs & Heifers and even being that high up, whenever a motorcycle left or pulled in, I could hear it. We had a king bed, small char, lots of lighting, and the entertainment center kind of coincided with the desk and armoir to hang your clothes. No standard hotel room sliding door to the closet, it's the armoir and some drawers. The casino is small but lots of penny slots, some tables, and a center bar. Oh, and valet parking is available with validation from the hotel for overnight stays, and if you're not staying there, you can get it validated from the players club or one of the local restaurants (ie: Pizza Rock or Triple George).  My only complaint is the shower. It's a glass walk in but only half glass. Think sliding door for a shower, but there's only one door and it's stationary. Some water on the tile in the bathroom because of this, but not flooding..thankfully.  Didn't have a chance to check out the pool because it was super windy and a tad chilly when we checked in, but apparently it's a rooftop pool with some cheap cabanas in the summer.

I went to check in and was told they ran out of rooms... what?! okay so not quite the reservation experience that Jerry had on Seinfeld because instead, they were upgrading me to a suite. And man, was it sweet! There was a wet bar and a living area, a huge ass comfy bed and two bathrooms.  I totally tuned out the red walls and red furniture... I slept like a queen.   We were only there for the night so I didn't get to check out the pool but I did use the ""fitness center."" It was kinda sad.  It had two treadmills, an elliptical and a stationary bike, no weights.

Hotel room is very nice, modern, new and clean, however, there is only one tiny gift shop and few restaurants.  The self parking is really really long walk and for female guest like me is very scary to walk there even during the day time co silts isolated. Elevator is dirty and dark. Saw graffiti and strange people are hanging around and loud loud music are being played at somewhere. And most of all it's very dirty. Worst of all, parking ticket machine cannot read guest park bar code so far we had to pay $5 and $9 for two nights. And we are about to go home, I'm sure we have to pay again for the 3rd time, even front desk said should be fine after failed twice. They said something wrong with the parking machine. So in order for us to get credit we have to charge to room for some expenses, but since it's a promotion stay and room is comped we had to force ourselves to buy coffees and so but still not enough to cover to get credit full amount.  So we will eat these parking fees at this time . I know it's free to stay what is a big deal for some, but it's a basic service issue and still I am not happy with this situation. 

Well,  I could have used the valet in that case but I go out and back and force bet . hotel and stores and shops for 4-5 times a day, paying the $2-3 tips each time will cost more. Bit I guess since the parking situation was so bad I should have used the valet......bit I have no issue with other hotels at downtown.

At check-in I mistakenly booked a smoking room and wished to get a non-smoking room, when asking whether the room would smell or be fresh in the smoking room, my partner and I were told that it would be fresh and smell clean. When we got into the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. Fortunately, we only stayed one night so we didn't feel the need to change rooms but I didn't like being led to believe that the room wouldn't smell. Additionally, my partner and I felt like we were being ignored during check-in when we asked questions about availability of any non-smoking rooms. 

There's no shower door to the shower.... That's kind of weird...

When attempting to call housekeeping, no one answered the phone for a long while. Once someone did answer and I requested for towels, no one showed up to drop them off. I called the following day for towels and was limited to 4 but at least this time someone answered and delivered the towels in a timely manner.
The gym was very small and limited to hotel guests so when my partner wanted to use the treadmill, both machines were taken as well as the other equipment in the gym. Luckily, there is a 24 hour fitness half a mile away so my partner was able to go there but it was a bit of an inconvenience. 

Other than those things, we had an OK time at the hotel. It's small and and kept up nicely and the 3rd floor pool and bar are nice. I wouldn't mind staying again.

The room was generally large and well appointed, and had a fantastic view of downtown Las Vegas and part of the strip. My room looked directly over the Fremont Experience which has live pop music blasting until 1AM. While that might be great for people who are here to party, it was not so good for a traveler who had a meeting in the morning. The hotel supplied ear plugs did little to quiet the noisy loud music . 

In the morning, I tried to order room service but was put in hold by the front desk for twenty minutes and eventually gave up. When I tried to get my checked bags out of storage, I had to wait a similar amount of time to find a bellman.

I am giving this hotel 2 generous stars because the room is pretty comfortable and retro looking. The Spread deli was great, probably the highlight of my stay. Good food and the best service I encountered at the Downtown Grand. Unfortunately, I have a laundry list of complaints to go along with this review.

1. Parking structure not attached to the hotel. 
2. Elevator out of order in the parking structure. Had to take the urine flooded stairwell with luggage in hand. 
3. Must validate parking everytime you leave the structure. You would think a remodeled resort would have keycard access to parking.
4. No fans in bathrooms. 
5. Bathroom very bland.
6. Customer experience is subpar.
7. Was given directions to the wrong tower.
8. Valet attendant yelled at me for not having a validated parking slip! Really?!!! I am a guest! I am paying to be here 

Morning add-on:
Slept well, bed is comfortable. However, the room does not have an iron standard and it has to be delivered upon request. Secondly, there is no where to put soap or other toiletries while showing. I had to place my stuff on the ground in the shower. The shower also only has one door which leaves a wet slippery mess on the floor and quite the ""drafty"" cold showering experience.

When leaving the parking structure I inserted my validated parking pass and I was asked to pay 9 dollars! Are you kidding? I am a guest! I had to get very insistent with the crew on the ""assistance"" phone line to get let out of the garage! 

This visit was awful, almost like a nightmare I couldnt escape. In closing, I think the Downtown Grand needs to reevalute ways to Wow their clients and make their processes more efficient. I recommend valet parking for all and no self parking. Also a paperless system for parking and revisit room ammenities. It wouldnt hurt to liven up the casino with music and other attractions. It is a littlw unclear what the hotel theme is. That is an important part of being successful in this competive industry.

I was staying here for a work conference and honestly couldn't sleep until at least 3 am, which is ridiculous.  I am not interested in partying or staying out late while on business trips, so this was the worst possible hotel choice that I could have made.  When I called the front desk to ask to be moved to a new room, the worker was snobby and told me that they were fully booked because of the conference.  He said I would just have to hope that the music would quiet down within the next few hours.  I would not recommend this hotel just to save a couple bucks, I can see why it is not a top choice.

Their casino floor was very nicely laid out. It was clean and had a very nice atmosphere. We played mostly slots, so we ended up jumping from one slot to another because we just weren't hitting on any of the machines I guess.

We are Vegas locals, and my husband and I had a wonderful staycation here. The hotel staff were all very friendly and accommodating. We spent a lovely afternoon at the Citrus pool roof deck, where the water temperature is kept at 80°, and you can order drinks and food from the bar. The entire hotel was remodeled under two years ago, and the new decor feels fresh and modern. The kind of place where you don't mind walking barefoot on the hotel room carpet - rare for Downtown! It's located one block away from Fremont Street so you can walk to all the tourist action there, but still far enough away that (with ear plugs!) that same action won't keep you up all night. The art collection here is great, with stunning original artwork down the hallways everywhere you turn.  As an artist myself I just wish that they had little plaques crediting the artists. Tip: there's free parking at their self park garage, but no elevator that we could find, so drop your bags at the door with someone before you park - same advice if anyone in your party is in a wheelchair or walker. Then remember to bring your parking ticket to check-in to get it validated.

2633636,2016-10-06,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Pros:
Price and location.
Cons:
Room service is a joke (food)...youre better off just going somewhere yourself. It comes to you in a fast food to-go container with plastic utensils and a generic plastic bag. They don't have basic things you'd like you could order. For example, I couldnt order water, sparkling water, or even club soda. What kind of place (especially with a bar) can you not order club soda?? They even place club soda on the menu when you get a cocktail but they can't give you that??? It makes no sense. 

The Fitness center is NOTHING like its described...there are no weights or great machines. Its literally a tiny room with low ceiling (important if your tall and decide to use an elliptical and your head touches) two treadmills and two elliptical. No weights as described.

Room items. Things most every hotel from dump to expensive offers that you don't think you'd miss until a place like this doest offer it...like getting a pen an notepad in your room. I was desperate to find a pen and I thought...I'll get one in my room. No such luck. You don't get fresh glasses in the bathroom. Who cares you say? Well some people like to place there toothbrush upright in one. Its the little things. You don't get offered a shower cap. Who cares? Well maybe you don't want to get your hair wet and need to take a quick shower. Extra pillows. Ive yet to got to a hotel that didn't have that extra set of pillows or blanket in it. This one does not. You get two long pillows. So, if thats not to your liking (not mine. Its uncomfortable and still and an odd shape) then tough luck. A bathrobe would be nice. No luck. The TV...my entire three day stay the TVs were broken and told there was some kind of satellite issue and techs onsite were on in. Three days. Not ONCE did anyone on staff offer a solution outside of that. They didn't even offer free on-demand for the inconvenience. They FULLY expect you to purchase on-demand even thought their TVs are broken. I know this may not relate to someone reading this later after the issue is fixed, but this shows you something about the service. 

In all, this place must work for others because its cheap and not a dump. I dunno..it was really not happy with my stay. This was a business trip and if i had a choice I wouldn't have stayed here past day one and would have switched hotels. If looking for a getaway in the future I wouldn't come here or recommend it. Of at the least, send them to this review so they can know what to expect and maybe bring from home.",6iefiFIIRc84NUnfb6_Xyg,3,0,2,bM-eXpLIZq650Qnielnv8Q

2659273,2015-09-08,6,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Downtown Las Vegas has taken a strong hit in recent years. Competition from the Strip resorts and extremely competitive room pricing has led many casinos downtown to either close or at the minimum, close their hotel offerings, instead relying on revenue coming exclusively from their casino. 

The Downtown Grand sat vacant for many years as the former Lady Luck closed down and the new resort could not find an adequate buyer. Located a block from Fremont street, the Grand went through a massive remodel and had differentiated itself from the others by offering modern rooms with flat screen televisions and upgraded bathrooms and an extremely cool rooftop pool with several lounge areas. 

Let's go through the good and the bad:

The Good:

1. Beautiful rooftop pool, bar, and lounge area. 
2. Upgraded rooms with flatscreen TV's, comfortable beds, and modern shower/bathroom.  
3. Upgraded and remodeled boutique casino with a generous players club and nice bar settings. 
4. Good value on nightly stays, but excessive Resort fee of $20 a night that is simply a waste and kills the value aspects. 

The Bad:

1. Hotel guests must pay $7/night for valet service. This is ABSURD. The one group of people that shouldn't have to pay extra for valet are the hotel guests. For the $20/night resort fee, this should most certainly be a complimentary service. 

2. $20 resort fee. With the fee you get Wifi and two bottles of water and access to pool and fitness area. I'm sorry but this is a casino in Downtown that is charging a resort fee that a Strip casino would charge (and the Strip casinos at least include free valet!). 

Overall, I like the property and I firmly believe it offers the nicest pool in Downtown and one of the nicest in the city. If it wasn't for the $7/night for valet for hotel guests and the $20 resort fee, this review would have easily been a 5/5. My wife and I booked a one night room as a mini staycation with the kids and our experience was very nice with those two exceptions. Though  do recommend the Grand versus other properties due to the pool and the upgraded rooms, I cannot recommend the value due to valet and resort fee. It is a dirty move on their part and is discouraging to say the least.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,17,6,3,2Z0s3KTf4D5fry1bv6QpmQ
2668723,2013-12-23,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"My husband received an offer out of the blue for two free nights at the Downtown Grand.  We'd never heard of it, but after looking into it, decided to take advantage of the offer and check the place out.  We booked in December after they'd been open only about three weeks.  

First, as we drove up to the address we were a little confused as we could see an unloading zone and we could see the front desk through the doors, but there was no one there to greet us and no bell desk.  the husband went inside to check in and find out about parking while i waited outside.  After he'd checked in, they told him that complimentary valet was on the other side of the building, so we drove around to the 4th street entrance to unload.  Couple of weird things about this.  First, I like to park myself, but at least the valet was free, so that was okay.  Second, I understand why they made this the main entrance since it had the large lot and the other side is just the street, but in order to get from the valet to the front desk or the elevators, it's a long way through the casino... kind of strange, whereas the other entrance is right next to the front desk.

When the husband checked us in, they told him we were in the grand tower, but no one said how to get there (at least that's his story and he's stickin' to it).  So we first went up the elevators near the front desk... except they don't go all the way to the floor we needed!  So, we went back down and figured out that we have to go up an escalator, then take a bridge across 3rd street then go up an old rickety growly scary elevator to our floor.  It was a long way to get there!

The decor of The Grand is very nice.  I know they were going for upscale boutique and they did a pretty good job of giving the Old Lady Luck a facelift.  It was definitely much more than putting lipstick on a pig, but architecturally, there were elements that reminded you that you were still in an old building, like the windows in the bedrooms which were high up and long and short.  Sort of strange.  That was fine, though, because everything was clean and new.

In the rooms, the beds and bedding were comfortable and there were nice pillows.  The decor was stylish and there was a new flatty on the wall although the furniture set up was a little odd, the TV was very off centered from the bed, so a bit awkward.  The bathroom was large and clean, but the shower was a disaster.  I don't know who thought the small glass half wall would be appropriate instead of a full shower door or a even a shower curtain, but the water sprays all over and it's COLD to take a shower without something covering the opening!  I HATED the shower with a passion.  The amenities provided were products by Gilchrest and Soames in the BeeKind line.  Unfortunately this line smells like lemon pledge and feels a little like it, too, so I didn't care for them.

The wi-fi worked pretty good and I guess there is normally a fee of around $11 per night for the resort fee which covers your wi-fi, coffee in the hotel (not sure where) and bottled water in the room.  My understanding is that they are also affiliated with Choice Hotels and you can earn and use points here, but I could be mistaken on the points part - but if you're a member, you should check that out.

The casino was small and we signed up for players card and got our WHOPPING $3 sign up prize and we played a little on the slots, but not much.  I also played some craps and the husband played some blackjack.  For the small amount we played, we had a good time because we actually WON.  Surprise surprise.

Inside the hotel, they have a couple of restaurants, we ate at Stewart and Ogden for breakfast both days - you can check out that review if you're interested and they have an affiliation of some kind with Pizza Rock across the street which we had dinner at one night - also a review you can see.  Other than that, they have a Chinese restaurant on site and a couple of bars and then neighborhood restaurants surrounding them.  You're literally across the street from the Mob Museum (one of my all time favorite museums), Hogs & Heifers bar, Fremont Street Experience, and the Gold Spike.  What's nice is they are really sprucing up this downtown area and it's getting to be really fun and upscale and kind of funky.  Just a nice place to be.  After this experience, I can definitely see us spending a little more time downtown (you can see some of my other reviews like the Container Park, etc) and even staying here at the Grand again.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,5,0,4,7NT74Uu6aZ5X_m46qXOEhg

I liked their casino as well.  Good blackjack game (full pay 3:2 and other good rules for player) and usually they have several $5 tables (six deck and single deck).  They even offer a $10 match play coupon to guests of the hotel.

Self-parking was a little annoying; you have to keep making sure that you have a validated ticket.   The valet parking staff was great.

Location is great.  It's just one short block from Fremont Street.  It's right off  highway 515.  Very easy access to nearby highways.

Overall, if you're going to stay downtown, then I highly recommend this hotel.

My only critiques is that they need to open up some more blackjack tables, they usually only have four tables going, and they should lower the minimum bet at the double-deck game, $5 minimum would be nice for the double deck game.",HV_bIOZfz_b9zvJ7aLE9Zg,0,0,4,0cQIhpMk5qilKujfkLyVTA

the room is small, with an Ikea-esque desk/closet unit and mounted flatscreen tv and 2 queen size beds. not that i even cared, but there was no coffee-maker with complimentary coffee or teabags (which i never use anyway), but there were 2 complimentary water bottles (which i gladly did use). you can call and have them bring you up an iron and ironing board if you need it as well.

the slots, tables, sports book, and bar areas are very basic as this isn't one of the high-roller's hotels, but the advantage in that is that the minimum bets required at the tables are cheaper (ie: $5 blackjack), and there are great Downtown attractions that are within a short walk like the Commonwealth, Gold Spike (which is right across the street!), Container Park, and Insert Coin(s).

for about $30 a night, it's not at all a bad option to consider when you're making a quick weekend trip to Vegas. my only complaint is that the parking structure across the street is supposed to be free when you validate your ticket at the Cashier's (as i did after both nights when we were gonna take the car out again for the day), but for whatever reason the sticker they put on my ticket the last day didn't work and i still had to pay $9. when i went back to the Cashier's, they were no help; they claimed they didn't have any sort of cash to reimburse me and that i'd have to go to the front desk to get reimbursed. seeing as we were leaving that day and i was more concerned with grabbing a bite to eat and hitting the road, i just chalked that up as a loss. the lesson there is to just valet park, let the attendant run across the street and retrieve your car. it's worth the few dollars tip.

The Downtown Grand is nice enough. The rooms are clean and relatively comfortable. The temperature control is a set point so you can not decide on a temperature, just high medium and low. That is not explained by anyone so my first night there was miserable because of the temperature. 
The shower has a half door. So the floor gets very wet and slippery. 
But our last visit my guest left a pair of shoes. I called and explained the situation to front desk person who forwarded me to lost and found. But no one answered and their voicemail was full so I got sent back to front desk 3 times. Next she forwarded me to security but the lady that answered wasn't interested in hearing my story and transferred me to list and found AND back to front desk. And unfortunately our guest had to leave without her belongings. 
We called the next day and after explaining our story again we were told they do have the missing items but we would have to pay shipping to get it to our guest. Had ANYONE looked for the belongings the day before our guest would have picked them up on the way to the airport but no one was willing , so we asked for the manager and we were again told there is not a manager available.

The walk from the hotel to Freemont St. is a short block, well lit, well traveled route, and indeed we felt safe. A self park garage is just across the street and a much shorter walk than any of the self parking for the hotels on the strip. The pool area is awesome!

I remember back in the year 2000 is when I first stepped foot in the Lady Luck. The place was a pretty foul, run down, toilet of a casino. Still I did have a couple of fond memories of winning some money there when my brothers and I visited on a road trip from Phoenix at the time. Well fast forward to February 2006 to when they closed the Lady Luck. It sat there for many years becoming a ""carcass"" of a casino (famously referred to by Oscar Goodman). I was so glad to hear that they were doing something with the place when the remodel began.

Well, since that time I've been here a couple of times, and it is MUCH nicer than I remember the Lady Luck. The casino floor is quite small. They have a small variety of slots(including a Family Guy machine(giggety) and video poker as well) and also a fair amount of tables. They do have a William Hill Sportsbook with a deli nearby. 

I haven't seen the rooms or eaten at any of the food outlets yet. Although I'm sure I'll be back to try something out one of these days. They do seem to have alot of specials for locals available from time to time.

My experiences so far have been.

-Machines peeled my money faster than I could say, ""Awww shi-""...those things are set tighter than a frogs ass!

-People in Valet and the Cage were very friendly and nice...especially the guys in Valet

-Kind of blows that they have no self parking available...valet only..

All in all, the place is a huge improvement over the Lady Luck and I love seeing the continued revitalization of Downtown, but the place is kind of small and theres nothing to really set it apart from other options around town or even Fremont..

But I'll be back sometime...its...OK..

The room was very large and the desk area good for work. The eleveators were all working well and the free morning coffee on the ground floor was a nice touch.

Perhaps they need to have an improved allocation management tool so someone streaming a movie doesn't take too much wi fi bandwidth and slow it down for others.

2925642,2016-06-12,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"It's sad to give this two stars as we have stayed here before and loved it. 

First, the rooms are great! However with the new management or owners they now nickle and dime you for everything! Also they sugar coated and told us parking was free with a receipt from the  commissary but failed to mention you had to spend $10 a day. (Mind you the pool where my group spent over $100-200 a day doesn't count towards this.)

The blonde cocktail waitress with the heart glasses was fabulous and on point. The next day we had another waitress and all of a sudden the policies they had the day prior had changed. She also completely ignored our area several times and paid more attention to the young 20 year old kids.  That was her fail considering we actually have jobs and can afford to drink. I totally would've had more beverages if we weren't ignored so much and tipped big. It's too bad she assumed that a group of 36 year olds were too cheap to tip. Unfortunately she got 10% from a person who tips 20% on a normal basis because of her lack of consideration.

Also, we asked one of the pool boys if we could move an umbrella and he said yeah as long as no one is using it. When my friend started to move the umbrella the security guard came and told us no and i explained that we asked the pool boy. He then proceeded to interrogate me hasking for his name and I explained that I didn't know his name but he was wearing the pool boy outfit and was bussing empties back to the bar. He basically was calling me a liar and i don't appreciate that when I'm a guest. 

The bell boys were fantastic, the valet was awesome and the servers in the diner down stairs were awesome and the Saturday night Art Bar bartender was awesome.

Your communication skills to your guests blows and as a result you end up paying for a things as a surprise. I think I'm totally staying elsewhere from now on and you should consider it too.",NJXvIvErzxpWZtn1GXKaQA,9,0,2,zPpFX5GvGIbs7-K-V9O7Rg

$20/day resort fees for:
   -pool access (which is ""closed for this season"")
   -coffee and tea in the morning until 10 or 11am
   -access to gym (small)
    -2 bottles of water per day
    -spotty wifi (we tried using but it was useless)
I asked them if I still had to pay the full amount since we wanted to use the pool but like they said it ""is closed for this season."" And that I didnt get my 2 bottles of water per day in our room.

Also the valet is $7/day of stay. The hotel&casino does not have direct access to the garage parking; you have to cross the streets to get to it which is a hassle and dangerous! :( 

Some nights it is really loud with music from concerts. That is why they provide ear plugs (only one pair) on the bedside table, I guess.

From walking the property before dinner I saw a mixture of plaza and Cosmo decor (the lobby bar screams Hipster with all the art on the ceiling). The casino is rather boutique with not a ton of machines and tables which I'd rather have than a lot of the low-ceiling crammed Fremont St joints. 

I dined at the Ogden cafe with some friends and wasn't impressed. Our average entrée price was $15 but the portion or quality didn't make it worth it. Granted they are always adjusting the menu, but it seemed a bit pricey for what you got. The decor was wonderful with atomic like furnishings and colors!

However, there were SEVERAL issues with their service and I'm really not one to be picky at all.

First, check in took about 25 minutes even though I was very next in line and it was Tuesday night. The hotel was dead. Second,  we ordered from their ""In Room Take Out"". I was a little confused at the title because it didn't make any sense but it turns out the food comes in styrofoam to-go containers in a plastic bag. We did not receive any utensils or napkins. No problem, things happen, sometimes you forget, but when we asked for some, he replied, ""Oh we don't normally do that."" Huh?! Okay...so we used the hand towels in our room as napkins... Next, we had a bottle of wine and forgot to bring the opener from home so after the guy told us they don't give napkins or utensils, we asked if we could borrow a wine bottle opener and he told us that front desk could help us with that. Again, they sell bottles of wine on their weird take out in room dining service, so I don't understand why we couldn't just borrow one. Soo we called front desk and explained and they said that they only have ONE bottle opener and have lent it to another room and they haven't received it back. Okay honestly,  one bottle opener in the whole hotel? What a load of bullshit. Just tell us that you don't lend them out! Then, one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard, they told us to take our bottle downstairs and have either S + O or one of the bars open it and then take it back to our room. What?!?! Then I was starting to get annoyed so I said, ""You really want me to walk downstairs in your hotel with an open wine bottle? You can't just borrow one from the places you told me to go to and send it up??"" And he said no! Oh my goodness. And that's what we ended up doing since we didn't even receive a knife from the in room take out. Then in the morning when we received our car from valet, we saw a worker kick the door open of a car, completely hyperextending his leg, making the door almost hit our car! And he just looked at us as if we were in his way! 
Overall, good room to stay at for one night for cheap but heaven forbid if you need something I guess you're out of luck. I have never been given such weird excuses for horrible service!

Pros.
 * Rooms are nicely decorated, clean and modern!
 * Large lap-top friendly safe.
 * Resort fee includes: 2 bottles of water daily, fast WiFi, morning coffee & tea in the café. 
 * Bed & pillows were very comfy!
 * Great location!
 * Strong security presence - something you want in the downtown area!
 * Large wall-mounted TV - that retains your last channel and volume level!!
 
Cons.
 * Noise. Knowing the hotels reputation for being noisy at night, we specifically asked for a quiet room away from the Hogs & Heifer's bar. Well dummy me failed to check our room out, thus we wound up having to change rooms at 10:00 pm because the H&H was so loud you could feel the bass reverberating! Our next room was much better, but the fact they supply you with ear plugs says a lot...
 
 * Parking. The valets attendants will tell you they have no dedicated registration parking area, thus your options are to park in their lot across the street or use valet services, however the front desk told us we could have used the loading area directly in front of the hotel.

 * Slot & VP machines have ads, which can be removed - but this grows tiresome. 
 * Beverage service is still haphazard in the casino.
 * Ice machines not located on every floor
 * Insufficient shower water pressure.
 * During both trips the escalators had operational issues. 

Tips.

* You can access the west tower without going thru the casino via the elevator located in the commissary.",g5ihTl7F8VmVuKHtpPYCaw,12,0,3,um-2RbIvbGCyg7A7W7OnWQ

Parking in the garage across the street on Ogden(?) is free if you remember to have your ticket validated. If you didn't drive, it would be easy to have an Uber or Lyft pick you up in 3rd street. Supposedly there is a free shuttle stop somewhere close and Big Bus Tour stop. 

It may be possible to walk to Fremont street.

The bed was okay. It was too soft for us and our backs ached so badly. 

The shower was weird. There was one glass pane covering HALF the shower - no door or shower curtain. The water would splash out and it was a cold shower since the heat of the water was escaping from the open part. Who is the genius that thought that up? 

The next issue we had was the noise. We were on the 9th floor far away from the pool area and we could hear the DJ until 2 am in our room. We went to check out what the commotion was and there was no one really up there, just a few barflies. The music doesn't need to be that loud. 

The walls inside are REALLY thin. I am not exaggerating - we could hear the conversation next door. It was creepy because all of a sudden someone started talking. We even heard our neighbor's TV all night. I could recognize which episode of Fresh Prince they we watching because we can hear the TV clearly.

I honestly was amazed that there was no kind of reaction from this woman when we complained. It must be completely normal to not honor people's paid reservations at this place!!

The shower is usually the first thing I want to do after flying across the country. So, off I go... There's no shower door or curtain. There's no way to turn the shower on/off unless you're standing there under the freezing cold/scalding hot water. You have to stand there under the hot/cold water to adjust it too because there's no way to reach the knob or turn the shower head away. As I'm showering I'm totally saturating the bathroom floor and toilet (recall there's no shower curtain or door). The best part, I've now made the bathroom floor more slippery than polished ice. I used the tiny bath mat, as well as a bath towel for the floor so I wouldn't fall. I am being extremely serious here. The floor is very slippery once wet. The shower head puts out the horrible old fashioned motel 6 ""mist-like"" water pressure that doesn't accomplish anything but wetting the floor. I took a plastic cup into the shower with me to collect water to pour on my head so I could rinse the shampoo/conditioner out. The soap is so tiny it's honestly almost impossible to soap up the wash cloths. 

The walk to the room 2033 was long and arduous. Done hanging out on Fremont, up ""the alley"", across the street, across the casino floor, up a giant escalator, down some steps, down a hall, across a bridge, up an elevator, down a hall, finally at the room. Imagine all the stages of drunken and weird a single woman might find in the maze I just described. 

The bed is made up with flat sheets instead of fitted. So, the bottom sheet buggers up and you end up sleeping on wrinkles the size of canyons. The pillows are heavy, hard feather pillows that quickly go flat.

Normally when we leave Vegas we just leave, and go about our way. Well, The Grand called us twice after we left. We, at this point, were at the airport trying to go through security, etc. After another missed call, we finally call them back. It seems they wanted to know if we checked out. Well, of course we did. So, make sure you do the ""check out procedure properly"" or they will haunt you.

After this very long but hopefully somewhat amusing tale, I/we would never ever stay here again.",LvJsVRG7R9XmnbWGPIV6Fg,2,0,1,f8Vl6QxYgqwToMWDA3viDg

3087751,2017-05-22,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"We were attending a concert at the Golden Nugget last weekend and wanted to stay downtown instead of ubering back and forth. There are some hotels downtown I will never stay at, but of the ones I will, the Golden Nugget and Downtown Grand are the best. Of those two options, Downtown Grand happened to be $10 cheaper. 

The hotel stands out for being modern but not in a trying-too-hard way. It's also not full of cigarette smoke and people that look like they've been playing slots for 24 hours straight. Check in was easy, and we were informed there was a pool party happening that night, but we didn't attend. We were also informed that we would get free wifi and bottles of water. This surprised me as everyone knows most hotels in Vegas will stick a mini Fiji water in your room and charge $10 if you open it. Well, same sort of concept because when I was signing my bill I found out that the bottles of water, wifi, and fitness room were part of a $23 or so ""experience fee."" I assume this is similar to the popular resort fees on the strip, except I guess the Downtown Grand isn't exactly a resort. We didn't use the wifi or fitness room (so small) but did drink some of the bottled water, which was not very good. So basically whatever price you see advertised, add on another $20 plus tax to stay here. 

We had to walk across a skybridge to our tower, but it's not a long walk and the view is nice. Unfortunately we weren't able to take our elevator to the ground floor which was the street level so any time we had to return or leave our hotel we had to go through the main lobby. The rooms are very nice, and we had a corner room overlooking Sunrise Mountain which I love. We also happened to be able to see the pool which was cool, though we could hear the music from our room. It didn't matter because we were going out anyways. 

We debated going to the pool in the morning but skipped it. Overall I like the location of the Downtown Grand: close to Pizza Rock, Gold Spike, Hogs and Heifers, and Nacho Daddy. It took about 5 min. to walk to the Golden Nugget for our show. It's a whole lot better than staying on Fremont where the music never ends outside. If you want to stay in a nice hotel downtown and not be in the middle of all the craziness I would highly recommend the Downtown Grand.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,5,2,4,C_g1z6YMtf02PXy0Ao3tXg
3122171,2015-01-09,3,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"It's a shame that I have to give Downtown Grand one star- even with the weird shower, and the location making the rooms noisy, I liked it. But it's run by very poor management, with little organization (with one exception, see below.) I work in the industry and these people should be ashamed of themselves.

My husband and I stayed the night on 12/23/14 - he had a job interview downtown so he brought his suit with him. (We were in the process of moving from San Diego to Vegas.) When he got back from the interview, the company called to offer him the job! In the excitement, when we left to check out, he accidentally left his $500 suit there. He realized it an hour after we left, and immediately called. They found it, logged it, gave us a confirmation number and told us they hold onto it for 30 days. Since then, he's talked to them twice on the phone and has been told the suit is still there. 

Today my husband finally had time to retrieve his suit- so off to Downtown Grand he went, only to be told they didn't have any record of his suit and they changed their policy (without calling us) to only hold items for 7 days, so it's gone by now even if they did ever have it. 

Now tell me - what kind of hotel has that kind of policy? I have worked for two casinos, one boutique hotel and one resort - nobody has a policy like that. The last hotel I worked at, an item of high value had to be kept for 90 days. And they have all of our information- why would we not get a phone call? Or an email? SHADY!

After being told his suit wasn't there anymore, my normally very calm, mild-mannered better half internally lost it and had to walk away. This is his favorite suit. So I called to figure out what was happening. After almost a half an hour of holding (really downtown grand, you're that busy when there's an angry guest on the line?) I finally got a front desk manager and explained the situation. She told me she hadn't heard of a 7-day policy. She connected me to Edwin, who I talked to at length. I have to admit, at this point I was furious and he could sense that. After a bunch of people ""looking"" for the suit, Edwin found it after not even ten minutes. He also let me know their 7-day policy has been in effect for quite some time, even before our stay, so for so many departments to not know such a big piece of information, there is clearly a huge problem with internal communication.

So how does a $500 suit get lost, but once I called and made it clear I wasn't accepting that answer, it gets found? I let them know my next phone call would be Metro for stolen property, or I would get in the car and come help them look. Then the suit gets found. Now my husband has to go all the way back there a second time. I'm disgusted with the way they handled this situation- I will never ever stay at this Motel 6 in sheep's clothing again. If you're going to be bringing anything of value on vacation with you (and I'm sure you are), I wouldn't risk staying at Downtown Grand.",jHN9V2Wr54ItVRrLBRaJQw,8,0,1,N4GEMCGWC6TJfGUE-6gh2Q

Taking a cab down to the strip is about $22. 
I would have to give the bathrooms a one star due to the shower head you can't turn it away from you when your trying to turn it on. You get hit with a blast of cold water since there is a piece of glass that doesn't move & the other side has nothing causing water to get all our the floor. The toilet is an old-school toilet. 
The outside noise level is so loud at night that they have to give you your plugs by your bed but I've been so tired from work it hasn't been that big of an issue. An added bonus is that you have a few great hidden pocket restaurants in the area that are within walking distance.

The only big downfall was, as stated by others, the shower. I knew how it was before so it wasn't a shocker, but experiencing it for ourselves it would've been nice to have a curtain or something mainly so we didn't have a draft when showering. It got a little cold if we had the door open, but closing it and letting the hot water steam it up worked ok. The separate vanity with sink was nice, and had a stool so I could sit and do my hair and makeup.

Hotel is probably the youngest of all the hotels in the old downtown area.  It is modern and has that artsy, hipster feel, including a bar called Art Bar.

Check-in was flawless and the Agent even wished me a Happy Birthday.

Room:  nice size King smoking room (so I can use my medication) on the 18th floor overlooking Zappos HQ building at 400 E Stewart (must go on that Tour on my next trip to town) and the City.  Pretty city lights at night.

You get 2 free bottles of water per day, probably more if you ask nice.

Skip daily room cleaning, if you like.  Just hang out the MOVE ON door sign.

Room came with 2 pairs of ear plugs: you find out why if you are in your room at night in bed like we were!  Fremont Street Experience music goes on until 1AM and it is as loud as can be.  

One negative:  on our last night we had people in the room next to us and boy, could you hear them!  TG for the earplugs again!!

Nice casino downstairs.  I liked that it was not packed and I could breathe, not heavy with smoke.

Go to The Commissary across the street for your first free coffee or all the fast snack items you might want to grab to bring back upstairs.  You can kickback in here and have coffee or beer, too.

It was a fantastic visit to Vegas, great to be here at Christmas time, it's all decked out to the nines, and for my birthday too!  Visit to the Coach Store at the Outlets topped it off perfectly!

I guess the ear plugs in the room should have telegraphed the fact my room would be shaking with the sound of bass and music from the nearest Fremont Street stage from about 5PM until 1AM. If you value peace and quiet in your hotel room, please consider staying somewhere else. Since this is key for me, it really knocks this place down several stars. Better double or triple paned windows would help... that, or a warning on their reservations site that the place is loud for the better part of the night so that people can choose to stay somewhere else, would be helpful. Also, the gaps in the curtains let in a lot of outside light and there was no way around it. If you need dark to sleep, this is not your place. There is a Euro-style closet that was fine for me, but our friends in the room next door did not feel that it was big enough or that there was enough room for their stuff. Their room with the two queens was cramped. Our room with the king bed was spacious. There are also minor nit-picky complaints like no pen or pad of paper in the room (something I didn't think I'd miss until I needed one, repeatedly! LOL) and the funky chair in the room was really uncomfortable, but this is minor. I wasn't there to hang out in the chair in my room, after all! There was a slight mix up regarding keys and we witnessed a couple checking in who had stayed there before requesting one of their quieter rooms, if possible... this is a known issue to them and they do not care about noise complaints. Full disclosure would eliminate complaints.

The positives are: Good restaurant S+O for breakfast (the cinnamon roll waffles are wonderful) and lunch was decent, too. The casino is clean, well ventilated and well lit. The decor is retro and funky and clean. Public restrooms, clean. Free WiFi decent, not great, but not the worst, either.

Those were the pros.

Cons:

The half door on the shower floods the bathroom.

The  very stylish design sink did not drain, so when rinsing my swimsuit out (after 30 minutes of swimming before I was asked to leave) - there was no room to rinse, for the sink was full of standing water.

The rooms come with ear plugs, Why you ask? The music is so darn loud and the walls and windows are so inadequate  - Rip Van Winkle could not sleep. 

And on top of the noise - after the music finally stopped at 2:30, sleep was inevitable UNTIL the sun came up at 7 and filled the room with light. The Curtains are too small. groan......There is no dark, cold and cozy in the room after the sun comes up.

I called prior to making a reservation to ensure they had a pool for there are no pics on the website. I was assured they do. But, I visited the pool the first night at 6PM and was asked to leave promptly at 6:30 for the area had been rented for a private party. The pool hours are 9am - 7Pm - yes......pool closes at 7PM in LAS. Go figure.

I needed to stay  an extra night for work. My first night was $69. I am not complaining for $69. However, the second night was $229. No negotiation.

Folks, this is not a $229 per night experience. I moved to the lovely Renaissance Hotel for $129 and was amazed at the difference in quality.  What was I thinking?

If you don't need sleep, a pool after 7pm or a reasonable rate - THIS IS YOUR PLACE!

Received the room we paid for which is a King bed no smoking deluxe room.

3304310,2013-11-27,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"You can add DG to the list of hotels that have cleaned up well in the wake of the downtown revitalization.

What used to be the Lady Luck is now a totally re-modeled boutique style hotel. Like the Plaza and Golden Nugget, Downtown Grand really illustrates how the redevelopment of downtown is moving along nicely. During the remodel they chose to keep alot of the exposed steel girders and brick facades giving the casino a industrial look. DG has a nice chic feel to it and they definitely didn't cheap out on the hotel rooms. The rooms have been completely updated and have a sleek modern touch to them; for the ~$50 they charge, its a great deal.

The casino itself is pretty small, there are a few bars and small restaurants littered throughout. From what I saw, the prices on drinks and food were very reasonable. It looks like Downtown Grand relies alot on Triple George Grill and the like just outside to really satisfy diners. Overall DG is a great edition to Downtown and 3rd, its nice to see DTLV on the up and up.

They now have ""free parking"" across the street in a ""secure parking lot"" however it's not free because they now charge you $23 a day resort fee for the parking and 2 waters in the room.

I went  down the stairs of the parking lot because the elevator looked run down, and there's a guy in the stairwell shooting up on drugs!

Room was nice, but we were facing the street so I knew it would be loud....they did put ear plugs in the room and we used them so no sweat.
Did not eat dinner here, but returned for some gambling.
Bartenders here are just awesome!  Ever time I sit at the bar I get treated like a queen.  I ordered champagne and got a big glass while hubby ordered beer.  We had some luck and moved to pennies on the floor.
More luck! Keep playing...kept ordering drinks.  Cocktail waitresses were fast, efficient and super fun!  Suddenly.... A message popped up on hubby's machine offering two free tickets to the Smith center.  He went up and got the voucher that we used last night for the Cabaret Jazz event.  The tickets were valued at 49.00 each and they were great seats!
I decided to celebrate with more penny play and ended up hitting over 100 dollars on a floor machine!  We ended up 40 dollars ahead for the night and once again had a complete blast!
This place is great!  I just love it.
Next morning however, the S+O restaurant was having issues due to not enough servers.  We never got a refill on coffee or water, which was disappointing, but we did get another coffee that is offered complimentary to guests, so in all we were OK. Probably will not return to S+O because the food was lacking also....we just happened to have a 7 dollar food allowance.  Next time, we will use it at commissary instead.
I refuse to let that give this hotel a lower rating.
Are there nicer properties in downtown?  Yes.  But, is there a more fun property in Downtown? It is the Downtown Grand...hands down.

Parking was right across the street from the hotel and the elevator was extremely disgusting inside the parking structure.  I know downtown Vegas is supposed to be known for its grunginess, but this was just filthy. 

Once inside the hotel, it seemed pretty nice. We went straight to check in, and the line was pretty long. There was only one person handling check-ins, so we were in line for a good 25 minutes prior to being helped. Once we were ready to be helped, the associate said that we were going to get upgraded, but then later said it was an accident that she said that, and never upgraded us after all. 

Once in the hotel room,  we were trying to get assistance by dialing through the phone. We tried housekeeping, bell desk, front desk - basically anything that could connect us to anyone. We tried dialing for about 45 minutes, and the end result was that no one ever answered to assist us. 

Overall, this hotel to me was a huge disappointment. I was hoping to have a nice stay, and it ended up being being a complete let down.",chhv5egoLSXHs4my1HCJeg,1,0,2,QBWXsaYlpWqfQiEVfFbSwA

1. Check in was a breeze.

2. The pool is a wading pool that is 3ft deep. It is clean, and quite busy.

3. The Room is spotless.

4. Yes, there are earplugs in the room, we were on the 25th floor in the Grandtower. Honestly, the noise level from here was normal, we are in Vegas after all, so I didn't  expect dead silence. We didn't  use the earplugs.

5. The shower is different,  but if you stay behind the glass, it's fine. 

6. The bed is a bit lumpy, and the pillows are a bit hard. That is the ONLY reason I deducted a star. 

You're on vaction! Enjoy it. There are people that would give an arm and a leg to be here. Nothing is perfect, we can't always get every single thing we want.

3457096,2016-01-04,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Pro: 
clean
Good price

Nice interior. Not the best, but good enough in downtown.

free parking for downtown (since it is more difficult to find free parking in downtown compare to the strip, why not stay in a hotel in downtown with free parking if you are driving.) If you read other reviews, let me tell you this - THE PARKING IS REALLY NOT THAT FAR!!! It's just not indoor next to porker tables and stores. It's closer than Caesar Palace to the Forum Shop. I've also seen securities, but No one can't guarantee your safety in downtown. 

nice front desk and staff (they smile to you even you are just passing, not pretending they are working. They give you all the information you need before you ask)

Feel they actually care their customers (people complain the noise and there's nothing they can do about it, so they provide ear plugs. I mean what you want the company to do? Shut down all the activities in downtown?)

Con:
Bathroom
Biggest problem I have is the same as other yelpers mentioned - half glass shower door
Seriously! It's freezing! Don't know if I should keep my front or my back warm. 

I would recommend if you want a place to stay for the night. If you are looking for free valet parking, spa in the room, staffs treat you like a princess and not paying more, sorry, you are not gonna find it anywhere. Let's face it! You get what you pay for.

3490344,2017-04-27,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I chose this hotel for it's close proximity to the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, its modern look (I figured there would be less smoking), and the very reasonable price. I have never stayed off the Las Vegas strip before, so I had pretty low expectations. I figured, oh well, I'm in Las Vegas for work not play.

My stay here turned out really awesome!

Pros:
- Check in was really easy. Receptionist was really friendly. Due to availability, I was upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. No complaints!
- No smoking in the lobby/hallways. I really appreciated this. Although the casino is off to the right of the lobby, you barely notice it.
- The suite was clean, spacious, and comfortable. 
- I really like the shampoos/lotions provided from Bigelow Apothecaries. The lavender and peppermint combination is awesome. Very soothing and relaxing after a long day.
- Comfortable workstation for when I continue work from the hotel. 
- Two bathrooms!! Both with a shower!
- Complimentary bottles of water.
- 24/7 in-room service from Freedom Beats. Always nice to have the option to order in-room service.
- Bed is very comfortable.
- Has a small fridge if you want to keep some beverages nice and cold.

Cons:
- Not sure why the shower is so small. For the size of the bathroom, the shower space really could be much bigger and more comfortable. I can't turn on the water without it shooting out the door. It also takes fairly long for the water to turn hot. I take pretty quick showers, like 7 minutes tops, but the water isn't fully hot until toward the end of my shower.
- TV is difficult to control. Screen doesn't react very well to the buttons. At all. My advice is that if you want to watch TV, just keep pressing 'guide' and you'll get to watch TV.
- Ice machine is not located on every level. I stayed on the 6th floor in the Grand Tower and had to go to the 7th floor for ice. Not the reason I mention this as a con. The con is that they don't have any signs that tell you which floor has an ice machine. I got lucky going up just one more level.
- Curtains not long enough, so plenty of light comes through at night.

I think this is the best choice in the entire area if you're looking for a more modern and comfortable stay. You get the downtown experience without having to hear or smell it constantly. I would stay here again.",yPO0z5R7kNUmU9keMnX0uA,0,0,4,pVhphcfxFxK0MVISZTrUmg

Checked in a little late, and the first thing the host at the front desk says is ""That'll be $25.99/night."" When I asked what the charge was for since I had already paid for the room, they said it was the ""RESORT FEE.""
No where was there anything about a ""resort fee"" and when I inquired further, I was told it was for ""bottles of water and wi-fi"" and then I was handed a pamphlet that said the following: 

GRAND EXPERIENCE FEE INCLUDES: 
Access to the pool during seasonal hours
24-hour access to the Fitness Center
Complimentary self-parking with validation at Front Desk
Two bottles of water in room each day
Local & toll-free phone calls

After getting upstairs, the ""non-smoking"" room smelled like SHIT. The whole room smelled like a combo of bad weed and sewer pipes. Thankfully, we weren't in the room/hotel most of the trip...

By the end of the trip, I was charged an extra $80 resort fee for things I never used on top of the original $300 for the room.

Figured I would gamble a couple of hundred dollars and get on their radar but I needed a new players card. When I got in line for a card there was one person in front of me and all 3 attendants were helping people. One lady even walked the two people she was helping to a machine to make sure they knew how to use their card with the machine, then she walked away. The next attendant finished helping her guest but then never looked to the line, so I assumed she wasn't ready to help anyone but someone came up from the other direction, ignoring our line and the attendant helped the walk up, then a new line started behind them. The third attendant did take the next guy in line front of me but then while they were together, the next line started behind them. So now here I am with two attendants, three lines and I was there longer than ANYONE ELSE in line. So, when the next attendant was available I asked nicely what the plan was. Since there was now a 3rd line that started,and only 2 attendants. She replied to me that the new line that popped up across from me was indeed a proper line. I said ok, but who is going to help our line. She said, "" Oh I'll get someone"" and then beckoned to the next person in her line, she never picked up the phone or a walkie talkie and totally ignored me. This is after I was in line for about 7 minutes or so. I was so frustrated I just walked away. The only thing that made me even consider giving this place another chance was the doorman out front.

3580370,2014-05-28,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This place is pretty awesome. It's a block off of Fremont St, which some might think is a bad thing due to the shady history of that part of DT Las Vegas, but It's perfectly safe and the walk from the front door of the casino to Fremont St takes about 3 minutes max. 

I usually self-park but since the lot was across the street I decided to valet, which was free (like most if not all LV casinos). You simply text the number on the back of the ticket on the way downstairs. My car rolled up about 5 minutes after texting. 

Check in was extremely stress-free and quick, considering they only have a few hundred rooms. The staff was extremely genuine and very helpful (was immediately told by a security guard when we walked in the door with our luggage that check in is to the right).

The elevators in our tower were very quick. We never had to wait more than a minute or two, despite it being a sold out holiday weekend. If anyone's ever stayed at some of the nearby hotels, waiting 15 minutes to go back up to the room because you forgot something is incredibly annoying. 

The standard room we had was spotless and smelled fresh (because they're brand new). The furnishings were modern but pretty modular looking. The desk had an outlet built into it with a USB port to charge your phone/device. The lamp on the nightstand also had the mandatory charging outlet for your devices. There is a clock radio with a jack to plug in your phone/ipod (the speakers are about 1.5 watts. The room had an extremely comfy chair so you don't have to lay in bed to watch the TV (your significant other will have to tho). Beds were average. Check this out though... our standard room had a 50 inch LG tv. I know ""this is vegas..."" but watching south park on a big screen in a hotel is an excellent way to nurse a hangover and that in itself is a major plus. Our room's AC pumped. The room never smelled like smoke despite having guests who were partaking. The ventilation system in the casino must be state of the art. The bathroom was average and I don't even have to mention the shower door issue other than the hotel should take note and spend the $20.00 a room and throw up a curtain to stop the splatter onto the floor. It didn't bother me but based on the other reviews was a big deal to a lot of people. 

The casino was very nice and had minimal smoke (I don't care, but based on reviews, I guess this is a major thing in casinos for many folk). The exposed duct work shows that they spent a fortune on a major ventilation. The table games were friendly and the staff was totally cool with a little lively fun at 5am. The casino is slightly smaller than average. It's about the size that you can tell your travel-mates that you'll be downstairs and they will have no problem finding you in 5-10 minutes. The decor of the casino is pretty cool and modern. Lots of exposed structural steel and duct work. We noticed a lot of details that aren't exactly fancy like the cosmopolitan or anything, but show the extreme attention to detail that went into the finish design of the hotel/casino.

The pool is small and sunny. The deck area itself was pretty nice looking. I didn't spend too much time out there as I was already sun-baked from the day before and there wasn't any shade. 

As a long-time Vegas participant I feel they did a fantastic job at resurrecting a vacant and blighted part of downtown and completely invigorated it. I'm not hyper-critical of hotels like some yelp reviewers are but I see this place has some heart and I can tell there are people running the place who are actually trying. With some fine-tuning the place can be a real winner as long as they keep up the good work.",ZO8XIS8K2dAtZQjPgU-0Qw,5,0,5,l21epUmaDUbBDcNidWl7rA

I check in having reserved two rooms, for a personal trip to try out this hotel for our future company retreat, and this is where the fun begins! I end up taking six trips down the escalator and elevator, and six trips up to our room because the staff at the front desk cannot program my key room. 3 hours after checking in we still don't have access to one of the rooms!! The engineer ends up opening the room, to come to find out the ppl across the hall were experiencing the same problem. We go out and come back exhausted Saturday morning, for the room key to not work AGAIN, once more back to the front desk. For all this the hotel manager BRANDON offers to comp off our resort fees to our rooms. Nowhere at this time does he APOLOGIZE or extend his sympathy, obviously unaware of his job duties or may have not been properly trained. There were two women in the front desk on a Friday night, at one point only one was up at front desk during my six trips downstairs. So obviously it's understaffed! Supposedly Mgr Brandon says he's going to waive our resort fees and when checkout time comes up, guess who's charging us resort fees still!!?? I speak with the hotel Manager Lauren Phillips, who when I mention Brandon and Jennifer's rude demeanor, she automatically shows signs of previous problems with those two employees. Ms. Phillips contacts me a couple days after checking out with a future 2 free night stay, which I strongly regret right away.

Your room is air conditioned and it's cold and when you take a shower, you dry off while in the steam to stay warm but with this half glass, I was freezing my butt off after the shower to dry off.

Rough tissues and toilet paper

Small gym only weight machine is broken

$15 for a fridge 
$15 for a crib


Pros:

Inexpensive 
Free parking right next door
Liked the Adler toiletries 
Not too smoky 
Bed was comfy
S+O restaurant in lobby has good bacon and is reasonably priced

Solid spot 3 days for $80 was excellent value. Casino is small and wasn't really smoky. Fremont street is overrated... but in the summer and if you're young I'm sure it's a blast. If only we could solve the noise issue this place would be almost perfect.

The people playing with us were friendly and we're having fun. Only bad part is we didn't see a waitress for the first hour. Once we commented to the put boss, she came by and brought us drinks. We played for a few hours and rode the roller coaster of ups and downs. Luckily I walked away breaking even. I placed a few bets and was down to 8$.

We went to the checkin where the girl at the desk was friendly. It was 11:45 and she could not check me in until 12:00 without charging a fee.  Really, the room was ready, but ok we can wait. She did arrange for both rooms to be adjoining which was great. 

Resort fee is a joke, as much so as the gym with a few treadmills and elliptical machines.  The pool was closed. I did not feel there was anything resort about this place. It's just a casino hotel. Oh you get free coffee. 

Room was clean. Nothing special. Tv worked fine. Bed was ok, and pillow really hard.  One thing in room was really strange. Earplugs next to bed. Ok, that is not good. Must be bad road noise. Nope, it's the dang Fremont Experience Music at night. It shoots right at hotel and really really loud. So they did come in handy late at night. 

Casino vibe was bad.  Total bummer. No energy for a weekend. I really tried, but it was about 25% full. Dealers were just ok on friendly meter. Free drinks, well there is no service in the tiny sports book. I ordered a Jack D on the rocks at bar and got a glass that was more flavored ice then ice floating in JD. Maybe it was just that one when I was sitting at bar playing machines.  So I ordered at blackjack table and got the same flavored ice.

The rooms are really nice and new, beds comfortable, and no drain issues. My only complain is that there are no hairdryers or irons in the rooms, also refrigerator available upon request. The fitness room has fairly new machines but it's a complete glass room, so everyone walking on the connector bridge can see you sweat, very hot!

It is very loud at night due to the music several of the bars/clubs on the same street plays, so plan accordingly. Parking structure is a block away from the hotel lobby, in a different building, so be prepared to walk.",8ZryN_S-n48g6rsa3W3QtQ,29,21,4,B08SnAp3oQoDbMj1rwXYgA

I could tell you every song and the lyrics.  They need to step up to double paned Windows.  Horrible night.  Woman on phone was rude and snooty even though my husband was super low key.  She said we couldn't move rooms.  Also said this was posted on their web site - referencing the motorcycle event no doubt, but motorcycle noise was not a problem.  It is the flimsy windows and the music that is a killer.  By the way, I can't find any mention of any noise or motorcycle event on the web site, so she also apparently 
does not speak the truth.  Horrible, horrible, horrible!

Also, we were on hold 20 minutes when they hung up without answering.  No coffee maker or other amenities.  Pretty decor but ruined by noise.",98boXj260R0pYRCyXBfd6g,0,0,1,FTBdiLYQ-62sDhyuJmU3Cg

Unfortunately I fell a little under the weather during our stay. I bought some Theraflu but needed hot water in order to drink it. When I called down to the front desk to ask if some hot water could be brought to the room, I was told no without any explanation. I thought this was a little strange given that I was staying at the hotel for more a week. So I went down to Freedom Beat and got the hot water myself in order to take my medicine.

Lastly, my wife and I found holes in our sheets during the last night of our stay. That was disappointing and because it was very late, we were too tired to inform anyone.

The casino and bars looked nice, although I didn't utilize any of them. There were a few negatives for me. Small ones are that they charge $8 per night for valet, even for guests. Although, they do validate for self parking which is across the street. Also, they charge $15 to get a refrigerator for your room. The lighting in the room is also odd because they have a big stand up mirror near the front door and dim lighting which isn't close to the mirror. With the rest of the lighting only being lamps. The restroom was nice and the king-size bed was comfortable. The main reasons I'm giving a 2 star is due to having issues with the wifi and the sink being clogged. Also, mostly due to calling for a bellhop several times and after 45 minutes of waiting without an ETA, we decided to just bring our stuff down ourselves. Which was difficult due to the amount of stuff for 2 people to carry down. Excluding those negatives, I consider the hotel average with above average amenities.

The standing shower has no curtain and only half a door so water (when it worked) went everywhere on the tile floor causing me to nearly fall several times after the maid service took the floor mat and did not replace it. The water pressure was inconsistent as the showers would sometimes turn to a trickle. I made the mistake of not requesting a quite room. So, I had the loud buzz or bar music, motorcycles, and distinct performances from Fremont st going through my room into the AM hours. I could even hear the people in both rooms next to me coughing or in the restroom so I left my TV on all night to drown them out. If you were thinking free valet was a good deal you may soon be disappointed. It took them 30 minutes to retrieve my vehicle (no exaggeration), making me late for a job I just started.

She arranged for everything without us worrying about much at all. From the food tasting, to table linens, personalized reception drink for me and my groom, arranging for uplighting, to bringing us each drinks and food before entering our reception (and during!). Her and her staff always made sure we were never at a need for anything. 
I arrived Friday before the wedding and brought all my reception items (and I never had to touch them again until I got them home!) and staff picked up and stored my items, and on the day of my wedding, they both arranged and cleaned up my reception space (Grand Ballroom). We got a wonderful room upgrade with a great view (the room was gorgeous!), a bottle of Champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries & the sweetest card in our suite when I arrived!

A couple days after returning home, we got a survey from the hotel to rate our experience. We told them exactly what happened in the survey form and sent it off the realm of ignore on the internet.

The VERY NEXT DAY, we get an email from the General Manager of the hotel! Not a form letter, a genuine, someone took the time to actually write - letter! It was also co-signed by the head of housekeeping.

The letter profusely apologized for the issues with the room and included a promise to look into the issues we addressed, specifically with the pot smoke.

The biggest surprise was a gift code and them asking us to come back for two free nights on them. Zero room cost, Zero resort fee. 

As I had to go back up the following week for the second interview with the company I was trying to get hired onto, we accepted. True to their word, we didn't pay one cent for our two night stay and everything was EXCELLENT.

It is exceptionally rare that any business will take the time to contact you back and offer to try to make things right. The Downtown Grand did and by doing so earned a loyal customer!

I'm not hating.  OK, maybe I am, because I wandered in here expecting a higher end experience than the rest of downtown.  I figured I'd do a bit of gambling at the bar while sipping on a scotch.  I asked the bartender what single malts he can comp and he said none.  Really?  That's not normal for a higher end property.  I guess I could settle for a Johnny Black, but he told me the only scotch he can comp is Dewar's.  If you're not a scotch drinker, let me tell you that Dewar's is terrible.

I heard their video poker paytables were good at the casino for one day and they quickly changed that.  So I'm getting the typical vibe in downtown of casino owners/managers being too cheap.

3920159,2014-04-19,4,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"From what i hear, the newly renovated hotel is very different from what it once was. The feel is more mid century, old vegas, with an edge by having the Mob bar and Mob museum next door. The overall experience was good, but here are the pros and cons.
Pro=
-Cant beat the low cost, and added vouchers to use throughout the hotel.
- Large rooms
- Being walking distance from Wallgreens, Freemont Street, and places to eat.
-When we asked for an iron they brought one up quickly.


Cons=
- The shower, as everyone said with the door not being present, water goes everywhere. But from a girl who likes hot showers, it also makes the heat escape and in order to stay warm you have to stay below the water and not move. 
- The noise of the motorcycle bar below, and when they have live entertainment by the pool. i would suggest asking for a room closer to the mob museum and away from these two things.
- The walls are semi thin, I could hear the maid next door cleaning and sneeze.
- I do not smoke and they put us on a smoking level because thats all they had. The level reeked of pot. So much so we went to Wallgreens our first hour to buy fabreeze which I sprayed all day every time I came into the room. 
- Our requested refridgerator was never given to us, but luckily we brought a cooler and went to the level below us to fill it with ice... sooo it wasnt all bad, as long as you prepare. 
- You cannot control the air so your room goes through stages of being cold and muggy. By the third day us and our family were all sick and it ruined our trip. After deducting all the possible reasons how we got sick... this was the common factor that bothered us all. 
- I did not have an issue with this, but my boyfriend said the bed was short for him. 

Food wise was okay, but if you're a veggie like me just bring things as you probably already do, and know that Nacho Daddy and Pizza Rock (both walking distance) have vegan and gluten free options. 
I might stay here again depending on where Im trying to go and if they work on these issues, I could see it as a great place to host an event.",kVyqJ4B4TC6gfhYvMdI-2Q,8,3,2,vEBAe0uTKoFEw9UcNOTVgw

After dinner on Fremont Street, I walked down 3rd Street to check out the newly opened Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino.  It's such a pleasure to see the downtown area coming alive again.

I decided to get a slot club card and the line went quickly.  The place is really nice and has that new look and smell from the new carpeting.  All the slot machines are also new.

It's a small casino.  I really can't remember much of the Lady Luck which used to be here as it closed so many years ago.

I did a walking tour of the casino and dining areas and it's all very pleasant.  I played for awhile and came away up $3.  Wow, big spender--major winner!

The area is dark and the only sign is one neon sign which says casino.  The place isn't ablaze with lights.

When we first walked in the casino it had a strong smell of motor oil or engine.  I couldn't tell if maybe the exhaust from the cars out front were filtering in, or if it was the Corvette they had on display right as you entered the Casino. But you walk a little further to find the cutest little cafe and you begin to get the feel of the hotel.  

The rooms were very quaint, but well decorated.  Actually the smallest room out of all the hotels we staid at, but that didn't seem to bother us much.  Who goes to Vegas to hang out in the room.  They were well decorated, and had very comfy beds.  The bathroom was a little odd with the half shower and lever style toilets, but I can't complain everything was very neat and clean. 

For this hotel being off the strip they have so much to offer their guests. They had live music every day & night that we were there.  The tavern below the 2 towers always has activities going on and the street between the two towers had a car show!! The Commissary is a great hang out at all times of the day, The Pizza Rock is a great place to get pizza by the slice & the pool is amazing!  Not only was their a live DJ, we didn't have to pay for the comfy chairs or for the shade!!!! The pool assistant even moved the umbrella for us to get more shade. The drinks and food at the pool weren't over priced and the pool staff had magazines for people to read while we relaxed in the sun. The overall staff was amazing at meeting our needs.

I'm completely ashamed to say that this hotel is in Vegas.

My mom is in town for a conference and they have her staying in this particular hotel. It all started with parking. They don't even have on site parking they have a parking garage a few blocks down (And they charge for Valet). So after lugging all their luggage down the street to the hotel we went to check her in.

The receptionist checked my mom and her co-worker in and then gave them their keys. We went up and to our surprise there was a maid in our room. She quickly shooed us out and said we were in the wrong room. So we went back downstairs and she gave us a different room.

We had booked a room with a king size bed but they gave us a queen. No bathtub just a shower, no coffee maker in the room, there wasn't even an ice maker on the floor.

They did however supply us with two sets of ear plugs which should've been sign enough to leave and go to a different hotel.

There's no possible way anyone can sleep in that hotel. On top of the beds being EXTREMELY uncomfortable the noise level is so high from inside the hotel and outside the hotel that even with ear plugs in you can hear everything. The screams, the yelling, the live bands, the shenanigans. It's horrific.

We had people staying in the room next to us who had to of had at least 18 kids staying with them and they just let them run up and down the halls until well past 3AM banging on doors and screaming at the top of their devil lungs. We called to complain and nothing was done so finally i had to say something.

After the long trek from the parking garage i decided to bite the bullet and pay for valet, although I have no idea why since it takes them over 15 minutes to bring up your car each time...

We stayed here for 4 days and we only pay almost 200 dollars including the resort fee. There's a free coffee in the morning 6-9am. The room was nice and clean. Free 2 bottled water every day, soap and body lotions. No toothbrush though. They have a rooftop pool deck, it's very nice. The food was reasonable and delicious. Don't do room service, though. They charge 2.50 and the serving was too little. Just dine in and you will enjoy more! We also enjoyed the slot machines! We don't usually go to the casino, but we played the penny one and luckily won 100 bucks in a slot machine. That was really fun!!! The location is 10 mins away from the strip and close to the outlet. There are so many restaurants around the hotel that you can choose from. Go to Le Thai!!! The food was super delicious!

The Fremont experience:
Pros-live band, souvenir shops, games and entertainment.

So far, amazing, the room is spotless, the bed sheets are fresh, the room is not humid like many other vegas rooms. The finishes are excellent, granite, hard wood, lush carpet, well appointed by even the most deserning standards. 

Wifi Included!

I was able to run my HDMI cable to their LG HD LED T.V. And now I am enjoying anything I want to watch.

4139732,2015-03-22,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I am really on the fence with the Grand. Let me start off by saying that I had a pleasant experience here. Nothing horribly bad happened that would make me not want to stay here again. 
I am going to make it quick by listing Pros and Cons.

Pros:
Clean and very nicely styled
VERY comfortable bed
fast wifi
2 free water bottles (suprising in Vegas)
Cable tv with great channels
away from the party action in the Fremont experience
Close to Fremont st where you can walk it. 2 blocks
free valet
great service during my visit

Cons:
not well soundproofed
parking is a block away
could hear Fremont St stuff going on until 2am
restaurant was ok
Casino wasn't great
Average bathroom
rooms can end up being a slightly lengthy walk

All the cons are an easy fix. they do provide you with earplugs and honestly some people don't sleep until after 2am in vegas anyway. They might even be out partying in Fremont St so it wouldn't matter. The thing is that I wasn't amazed therefore I wouldn't make this my go to hotel. I wouldn't mind staying here again if the price was right though. Also this hotel was cheaper and way more nice and clean than some cheap places on the strip. I didn't mind driving to the strip either. It was so close and wasn't a hassle at all. I believe I enjoyed the Gold Coast a little more but I guess I would have to stay there again to see how it stacks up. There are things that I loved about the Grand, like the super comfy beds, but it gets overshadowed by a Con like the soundproofing. I wouldn't say to stay away. I would say if you can deal with those Cons then this is a great place for you. Also if this place has a good deal going on then go for it.

Now for the good and bad...
Let's go with what is good about this place first:
*Clean rooms
*Nice staff who are easy to work with (since I had to move rooms)
*Comfortable bed
*Nice conference room
*Directly downtown by Fremont Street (if you're into Downtown Vegas this is a plus)
*Free coffee for hotel guests at the West tower restaurant. 
*Free bottled water every day
Now why I will never stay here again:
*It's loud.  You can hear the DJ at the pool during the day and the noise of downtown at night till about 2am.  They do supply you with earplugs though (how thoughtful *me being sarcastic*)
*I had to move rooms after my first night because of the noise of DT LV; loud music till 2am and I was on the 16th floor.  It's cool if I was there to party, but I was there for a seminar and just wanted to get a good night sleep after a long day.
*No 'in room' coffee
*It's DT LV, and it's not my thing.  I'm more of a 'strip' girl.  DT LV is trying to clean up, but it still has that dirty feeling.
My main complaint is that it's loud, and there were plenty of people complaining about it.  
Like I said before, if you're there to party in DT LV then this is a great place for you, but if you want it a little more quiet and posh then I would stick with the strip.",YVV7cqk3i8bOHQKf_X6leQ,2,2,2,Nq98fQTxbmoHSIGF_Gokww

Other reviews about the bathroom area being inadequate with the half/glass are accurate and the noise could potentially be an issue etc if you're on a low floor.  If you're looking for a restful night request a higher floor on the non-Pizza Rock/etc side of the hotel (not sure of the name of the street).  The TV was huge and the room itself was great.

The dealers are all really friendly and nice as well as Ken in the sports book run by William Hill.  People seem to genuinely like working here which is nice and it seems less smoky than other options around downtown.  It's certainly less crowded as well.

The sportsbook is one of the better places downtown to watch games as long as no one near you is smoking.  As far as gaming goes they have a few good Blackjack tables but unfortunately not a lot of good video poker payback odds.

Hope they get some better video poker so I can drop by and play here more :)

Upon bringing the tickets of money spent in their sports book the valet there at the time had no idea what we were saying and that spending at only specific areas of hotel granted valet credited.

Its lovely and clean and doesnt smell like hella smoke! The casino area isnt crazy and crowded, but it also doesnt have a crap ton of different slots. I'm mainly reviewing the casino area, and bathroom as those are the only 2 places I visted whilst being there. 

It took me forever to find a slot that I liked, I did sign up for a card and was issued 3$ as a bonus. I was wanting to get a drink, alas drink ladies werent around. The slot areas were all clean which was a plus. 

The bathrooms are large and towards the front of the entrance. They were also very clean, just a little dark. 

All in all the Casino area is nice, and its located in a great central area, valet and tip for quickness!

4357282,2014-02-15,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I found this hotel because I am a Choice Privileges member and Ascend is one of their brands. So to preface, this is the site of the old Lady Luck hotel. I stayed at the LL 10 or so yrs ago and OMG, what a disaster! It is MIND BOGGLING what a facelift they gave this place...it is a completely different hotel! It looks and feels like it should be in Beverly Hills as it is super contemporary in both amenities and boutique chic in decor! 

The hotel itself is MASSIVE and has two towers. Be warned, if you don't want a cardio-walk workout, then do not stay in the Grand Tower as it is trek from the valet hotel entrance! Also, I got a fantastic nightly rate, but with the tacked on $11/day mandatory ""resort fee"" (which is basically for the wifi, though it includes coupons to the various restaurants and free bottled water in the room) and taxes, the rate ended up not be as amazing as I initially thought, though $60 total/night when all is said and done is still a decent rate for this kind of hotel.

The room was great! I had a king room and the bed was super comfy, the set up was cozy but amazingly functional and being on the 21st flr, I had a great view! I was also having a love affair with the pillows! My neck and I usually dread the lumpy, impossibly small pillows that have become the new hotel standard, but I had four amazingly plump, large, and just delicious pillows all to myself, I practically made myself a pillow fort! 

The bathroom was roomy and the complementary toiletries were fantastic ""Bee Kind"" products made with real honey (they smelled amazing!). The only thing I didn't like was the shower didn't have a door or shower curtain, it was just a half glass pane. I was afraid the floor would flood; it didn't, but the showermat towel did get overly soaked, plus it was kind of uncomfortable as the a/c air crept in and even though I had the showering running hot, I still got a chill.

The pool wasn't yet open, which was a shame because it looked like that place to be from above. They also have a minimal fitness center with ellipticals and treadmills, but not much more. I did have to ask for the water bottles that were supposed to be in my room on both days I was there, but the bellman was kind enough to get me some the first night and the housekeeper the second. The staff, especially the valet and bell desk were very accommodating and nice, though the girl at the check-in was a bit dry and cold. They have an awesome thing where if you valet your car you can either QR your ticket or txt your ticket number and they will text you back instantly with the number of minutes it will take for your car to be curbside. I used this 3 times and all three times it was like clockwork! You gotta love technology when it works!!

Overall, a great stay. I think with it being such a new hotel, they still need to work out the kinks, but I think they will get there. The product, though, definitely lives up to the Ascend brand!",efMDfLm2k7LY6l5sg4t8fQ,10,1,4,Sb0EBLXjW8GXMgMISAR7ag

Clean rooms with nice bright colors

Standing forever just to catch an elevator
Sunlight still beamed through the bottom of the curtains

What we found was a lovely hotel, recently renovated, with comfortable rooms/beds and a very good location. The hotel really needs to put coffee makers in the rooms - going down to the lobby for free coffee is fine, but not desirable when you aren't quite ready to get dressed. The restaurants all looked like they were squeezed in as an afterthought with banquet room chairs and strange ambience. I didn't mind the weird shower door too much since the water pressure wasn't strong enough to hit the back of the shower. There was a Zumba convention in the area and on Saturday they closed the street outside and Zumba-ed. We're odd in that we like to go back to the hotel for an afternoon nap so the racket from Zumba made it difficult to enjoy the room thoroughly. I'd consider a return stay but there are so many other options downtown that it would be a while before I'd go back. 

By the way, it was nice to be away from the strip, and $30 cab rides there made it even more desirable not to go there.",iyFT9D39KwuY8NCuX2FW4Q,0,0,3,pvD8zicJ1WLi1EHIMcZabg

The website we booked through stated parking was free so I assumed valet was still free.  Well only self-parking is free!

The customer service was excellent. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The front desk clerk who we spoke to for the upgrade got us a room facing away from the bars on the street so we didn't need the ear plugs even though we were only on the 6th floor.
For only $50 more a night we got a suite. If you look online it's the ""red room"". That room was beyond amazing. Separate living room and guest rest room in addition to the spacious master bedroom and restroom.

The rooftop pool area is called the Picnic on the 3rd floor. A very nice place to soak up the sun and relax. Good music playing and good drinks but a little expensive for being in downtown Vegas (piña colada was $13) The pool isn't very wide but it is long.

I only had $40 with me but figured we can play penny machines for a bit.  I sat at a machine and played.  Moved to another.  Then another.  Then saw my friend and sat at open machine.  I put some money in it.  It was a penny machine I had never played before.  Played and won something but didn't really pay to much attention because cocktail lady approached and friend ordered drink and we were chatting.   After cocktail lady came back I had about $53 and played it down to $50.   Didn't think much of it.   Cashed out and gave my friend $25 b/c we split winnings.  Then we played other machines.   As I continued to play, about 30 minutes later, a man approached saying he was security.  He asked if I knew why he was there.  I thought I won a raffle or something.  I said no.   He said that at some point I was sitting in a machine were a person forgot to cash out and I cashed out his ticket.   I had no idea what he was talking about.  Then he said it was a machine by bathroom. That was the machine that I cashed out $50.  I told him I put money in it and played and won something.  He said someone had stated that he was playing multiple machines and when he realized he failed to cash out a ticket went back to a machine and someone had cashed out $50.  He claimed it was his.  The security said he looked at video and I had not played the machine for too long before I cashed out.  Which is true since I usually cash out after I double my money.  But I did play for a while since my friend was waiting for his drink.  And if he saw the video he would have seen me put money in the machine.  I again explained I put money in it and was playing it.  He said he was hoping I would do the right thing and give him $50. Told him I honestly did not see any funds in the machine before I put money in it.  Which again was true.  Moreover I told him I too left my money in the machines since I played most of the $40 I came with.  Also, told him that very unlikely this person, had he failed to cash out, had left $50 in a machine since I put money in the machine and had won something.  The person only looked at the amount cashed out and for some reason wanted it.  He said if I did not want to do the right thing and give him $50 he would 86 me from property so I could not come back. There was no one by the machine when I sat down.  Moreover, I honestly put money in the machine and played and won something.  I got the impression this security guy just wanted $50 since I did not even see the individual claiming he left money in a machine.   He asked me to follow him and asked security desk to give him a form.  Nonetheless, I simply told him I did not have to sign an 86 form because I had no intention of visiting the Grand again.

1. The new $5 valet charge is a hassle.  I was told it would be waived if I ate at a DG restaurant.  I did so twice, but received no receipt from the restaurant.  I had to go back for a receipt, then found out my breakfast hadn't been posted to my room charge, so I had to re-check out of the room.  Then, Valet seemed confused about the whole restaurant receipt thing.  Why not waive the valet fee automatically when restaurant fees are charged to a room?  Also, restaurant patrons should automatically get a receipt to take.

2. I stayed 6-7 times with them in 2015 and was very pleased.  This time, the casino was much more smoky and the customers in the lobby seemed ""from the other side of the tracks.""  I'm no longer comfortable recommending DG to my female friends and colleagues.

3. Some extra, thinner pillows in the room would be nice, and the half-glass shower is a drag.

4. The whole resort fee thing has become a joke-- $22 on top of the room fee.  I know it's standard practice but properties should either charge more for the room or make the resort fee optional-- in order to access extra services.  

I am honestly thinking about turning to AirBNB.  There is a risk of inconsistency, but the value is better and I won't be nickled and dimed to death, or have to jump through a bunch of hoops to avoid a fee that shouldn't be charged in the first place.",OGtoZYKBqDHENC2XWjEGSA,1,0,3,uW22YLzR9vcNNUWKhM_iKg

4509728,2015-04-08,4,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"The Las Vegas Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino is located in the newly updated and Vegas featuring Downtown Fremont Street area.

What's particularly nice about the Downtown Grand Hotel is it's a smaller Boutique Hotel than all the massive behemoths on the Las Vegas Strip.  When here for a business conference or workshop, you can actually make it from your room down to the business rooms area in a matter of minutes.  It won't take you 20 minutes to cross the football field to get there.

The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and welcoming.  

My room was nice.  Not exceptional.  The room was comfortable.  The Housekeeping Staff just needs to be a bit more attentive.  There were multiple items of clothing in both the bedroom closet and the bathroom hook left from previous guests.  Security came to pick up the items.  Hopefully they went to the added trouble of contacting the prior guests to help return the items to their owner(s).  They'd be phenomenally impressed. 

Odd and Uncomfortable: There will be no month of the year that this feature would be advantageous.  The shower stall has a permanent half door only.  Yes, that's right.  There is no full door or shower curtain.  So you cannot close it.  Year round, you will freeze during your shower. 

This odd uncomfortable feature also means, you cannot turn on the shower head to warm up the water without getting sprayed with the initially cold water. 
TIP: Cover the shower head with a washcloth.  It will drip massively onto you, but you can redirect the cold water at least a little bit not to splash over your whole body.

The hanging area in the closet is designed for those 6 feet tall.  I had to reach up significantly to hang my items.

They leave out ear plugs on your bedside table.  I bring my own.  I had no difficultly with my room and street noise.  But that is something to contend with were you facing the Fremont Street Experience or staying in a hotel right smack in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience.

More on the Odd and Uncomfortable is that the window drapes feature a cafe curtain break in the curtains.  So, major sunlight streams in early morning into your room.  The large glass framed poster next to my bed was so reflective that it actually disturbed my sleep the first night until I trained myself to face the window with light streaming into my room instead.

The restaurants are nice, just a little limited for my longer stay.

All in all, the hotel is clean and newly renovated.  The furnishings are obviously new and sparkling, so you feel like you're staying somewhere quite nice.

Price Point Warning: If you found the Downtown Grand based on price, just know your room really costs $20 MORE per day than the daily rate. They force you to pay a Daily $18 Resort Fee for ""Free"" Wifi, 2 small water bottles, Outside Pool which is only open Spring-Early Fall, and Tea/Coffee until 9AM in the Commissary downstairs.

Parking is in a Parking Structure across the street.  You will have to schlep your luggage down and then across the street.  

No place is perfect.  The Downtown Grand is sparklingly and the customer service attentive and friendly, not like the jaded service you get on the Strip. Would likely stay here again in the future.",doqjzWCz8eXnDh4gDh3o8A,11,9,4,duRqgGwJCsvHb_8vSs27NA
4513450,2015-11-11,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This is a nice hotel.  It is the old Lady Luck.  It has about 680 rooms and it locate a block North of the Fremont Street hoopla.   The hotel rooms and lobby have been renovated.  They did a great job.  Here is my criteria for a 5* hotel review -

1.  Room must be clean   (yup.  very nice room).

2.  Bed must be comfy.   (yup.  nice bed).

3.  Room must be quiet.  The hotel is a block from the very loud Fremont street so I am giving them a pass on this point.  It is Vegas.  It is downtown.  It is loud.  If you rented a hotel room on Bourbon Street it would be noisy - same thing here, but you are a block away.  At least this hotel gives you ear plugs.

4. Shower must have great pressure.  Hotel lost 3/4 of a star here (so we rounded down to 4 stars).  I understand the dynamics of water in a desert, but the shower was the only disappointment of the hotel.

5. Hotel check in must be seamless (waiting after a long trip is not cool).  (check in was ok).

The hotel bills itself as a casino.  It has slot machines, but very few table games; this is fine, as there are many hotels within a 5 minute walk where you can lose your money and the casino staff is very nice.

I recommend this hotel as the price is right.  Watch for the 'resort' fee.  I hate resort fees, but if you combine with the room fee I guess you cannot get too upset.  Just wish they would do away with a 'resort' fee.",M5HcMq0m0WvI-m0RqbvRxg,1,0,4,vG5JjOjcJiaRjvsQaDJKxg

It was a tad noisy, but I expected that from the location, not the hotels fault. The only negatives about the hotel were the drapes in the room, which were not as long as the window, so light was peeking in. Also the shower!!!

We appreciated their good customer service, easy check-in and attentive housekeeping. 

Our room was in the building across the bridge in a separate tower, so it was quite a walk in the mornings to the car and at night getting back to our room when our feet were already killing us. The room itself was okay; modern, clean with excellent working a/c (thank God). There was no in-room coffee, tea or hot water, which I rely on when traveling, so that was a little disappointing. We ended up making stops to Starbucks each morning instead. Although the bathroom was clean and stocked with products, towels, hairdryer, etc.. there was no shower door!

There is a public parking structure across the street that the hotel validates for.  But what they don't tell you is how dangerous it is.  After dropping off our car and heading back to the hotel, there was a young man who looked rather disheveled, who appeared to want to get off on our floor, then returned back to the elevator with us.  I was in the elevator with my wife on a disability scooter and (2) service dogs in a wagon.  I am certain that if I had not been there, my wife would have been robbed and assaulted.  When we got to the bottom floor, their was another young man that the first was signaling to.  I made it my business to get away as quickly as possible.  Understand one thing, the downtown area is full of homeless people with an assortment of problems.  Make sure that you are in observational mode at all times for your own protection.  From that point on, we used the valet to park the vehicle.  It cost another $8/day plus tip, but was well worth it.  With regard to the dog situation, I had to drive approximately 2 miles to Symphony Park to walk the dogs, as there was no grass as far as the eye could see.  If they spent a couple of bucks and put in a little grass area on the property, I am sure that they would pick up more potential clients.

4647417,2015-08-25,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I'm giving them 1 star for the quality of service that was given during and after my stay.  I rented a room for a staycation for my boyfriend's birthday.  When we opened the door to my suite there was a RANDOM foreign stranger in our room.  Apparently the doors to the adjacent room weren't locked after cleaning and he found his way to our side.  The language barrier was an added touch of difficulty in trying to get him to leave.  Simple mistake I suppose, but an embarrassing start to my surprise for my boyfriend.

Then, I wasn't told about the extra hidden fees at the time of check in until it was time to check out and I was told my $50 deposit wouldn't be refunded in full since it would go towards our ""grand experience fee"".

Later, we got back home and my boyfriend realized he forgot his tie (one that I'd just gifted to him) so we called lost and found and was told our suite had already been cleaned and nothing was found.  The employee said they would send someone to double check the room and call us back.  LITERALLY 2 minutes later, we received a call back saying there was no tie.  They must've thoroughly checked our room -_-

A week later my boyfriend called lost and found again in hopes it'd pop up and it did!  Same pattern, brand name, room number, and date it was lost.  The worker gave him a confirmation number to pick it up and two days later when he drove down to get it, lost and found said ""it's already been picked up"" WHAT???  I understand lost and found is a courtesy, but if it's confirmed it's been found, I hold the company responsible for the item until it's returned to the proper owner.  Why was he given a confirmation number?  Are lost and found items given to any claimant without proof?  The worker even insisted that he remembered my boyfriend coming in for it.  After my boyfriend had to argue he DIDN'T claim it already, lost and found told him they'd have to look through their inventory again and that ""it would be a while"".  FORTY MINUTES later and the tie was finally brought out.  All too much hassle for what should've been 5 minutes in and out.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone I know.  I chose it because of its walking distance to surrounding bars and restaurants, but with all these mishaps added along with the lack of guest service, my experience was poor.

Valet is free with validation, if you're checking into the hotel just ask the front desk and they'll put a sticker on your ticket.",BoA83SDJI9HV3lJzFs8laQ,1,0,3,lweY2f1QYc8nHquVLjmNfQ

What they don't show you are the complimentary ear plugs... yes... and even the ear plugs are not enough to drown out the incredible volume from the near by live music- not to mention police, fire and ambulance sirens! We were on the 18th floor, so its not like we were at street level. It would probably be ok if you're out partying until the wee hours of the morning, but if you're like us, going to bed at 11:45pm... even 12:30am... forget about trying to sleep!! I can't really describe the volume... it was seriously loud! 

Then in the morning when we woke up, laying in bed contemplating the lousy nights sleep... the sound of a car driving by, 18 floors below, was still loud! Crazy!?! Maybe some better insulated windows are in order? 

Seriously disappointed in this hotel. The employees are nice enough. The room was clean. Decent sheets. Towels looked pretty tired and old. 

Travelers beware! If you're looking for a good night's sleep, this is NOT your hotel!!! It was a Friday night so there is a chance it was louder than usual?

Even though I was on the 32nd floor I could hear the music from the pool party going on.  They provide ear plugs.  I came back to room to sleep after 1AM so the loud music had stopped so there was no noise and I got a good sleep, but for a early sleeper I wouldn't come here.

Location is the old strip near the Fremont hotel.  Parking is confusing.  The valet service is slow.  But there is an option to self park in a garage across the street, but you need to get the parking ticket validated from check in desk otherwise you have to pay for parking.  Once you get a validated however you can just enter and leave as much as you want using the same ticket.  It not bad system once figure it out, but it was confusing at first.

The rooms were clean and new looking.  Shower is weird.  At 1st it looks like the zen like half glass door will keep the spray from going all over the pace which would be cool, but in practice the shower head pressure is just too high and water just ends up going all over the place and you end up using towels to soak up the spray.

On top of the web price, the hotel charges an additional per day $20 resort fee on top the price I paid during booking the room on the web.  This is not optional so I am annoyed at this deception.  I think the consumer should know what all the hotel charges ahead of time instead of hiding the fee until you show up.  Anyhow I guess this is standard Vegas practice so I'm not going to ding their yelp score for this.

Overall for the price I would come here again.  There are obviously better hotels if you have the extra cash.",F79EqnX4WcvVotjvfH-2dg,5,1,2,jtrfM0Tdndiykog1FJZJQg

I do wish the room windows opened, even just a little, for fresh air and be careful at the bar video poker games..they do not pay out at all; I tried three machines and just couldn't get ahead a bit (but then again that is Vegas for you I guess).

Review #24:
nice & new; located a block away from Fremont St., so a bit quieter & more sophisticated; this is a pretty small place, so limited options if you want to spend a lot of time here; the restaurant & bar choices on adjacent 3rd Street are much better; sadly, the cool-vibed Mob Bar has shut down recently except for private parties; very tiny but nice sports book; 2nd floor is mellow but deserted; the pool & rooftop Picnic restaurant area were closed when I visited, so can't comment on that; best craft beer bet = it is sadly almost non-existent, which really sucks for a brand new property; only good choice is to walk across the street to Pizza Rock, which has an awesome 20 taps (including 5 local beers), plus great food & lively/loud atmosphere",sg3wRRtKMfugbO7A3AX4Ew,1,1,3,GXCGYBK9DEJr1HH_JRTD3A

We called the front desk to inquire if they knew when the music would quite down. They said they had no idea, We asked to change rooms to the other side of the hotel they said they were completely booked, it was a Tuesday night. They were completely unconcerned.

Biker bar Hogs and Heffers features two intoxicated bartender females who prod and cajole customers to buy them shots. This bar opens at noon or so, by 1:30 they had six shots each. They also overcharge, watch your bill.

The Grand has so much possibility, shoddy customer service like waitresses who don't like serving drinks to players, preferring instead to chat amongst themselves at the bar, diminish it's chances to excel. Also, front desk staff fail to shine when they respond to a request for final bill print-out with, ""there is nothing to print out"". The bill showed outstanding balance of zero.

The customer service and detail to this place was absolutely breath taking. From the valet parking to the casino workers. 

Valet parking. FREE parking with great smiling workers eager to get you your car! Opening your doors with a smile. I felt like I was going to the oscars with the treatment they were giving me. 

Customer service / rooms. 
It was so easy to check in, the person who helped me was very nice. Explained everything thoroughly. I felt like I was VIP here. The room was spacious, only downside was their random one glass door in their showers. 

Casino. 
It's small, nothing crazy here so don't expect any fancy high roller type of gambling. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it because the workers here were so friendly! We stayed 3 nights and made friends quickly with the dealers. They were so fun and we really enjoyed our time with them. They treated us like regulars that come here daily. Everyone was very helpful in teaching us whatever game we were playing. Hands down the best casino experience. If your low key and enjoy a more personal gambling experience. This place is most definitely for you! 

Decoration /vibe 
The atmosphere is very homie. The decor is interesting not extravagant but simple. 

I really don't understand all the other 2/3 star reviews. Some people just gotta enjoy what this hotel has to offer and stop being so damn greedy. If you have a problem with the hotel. Contact them first, instead of blowing them up on the internet. The people who work here are humans too, sometimes mistake are made. I'm sure no one INTENTIONALLY wants to make your experience bad.

After Yelp deleted my first review I thought, I have to find the time to write again and write everything. 

1. At the evening, when we came, we got the room with wet, smelling vomit carpet. 
Before they gave to us this room, receptionist, the girl, said: this is the best of five same rooms that we have now, it's quiet and have a good panoramic view.
View was good. Really good. Just it. Room was cleaned after vomit just before we arrived, noise came from Fremont Street, so loud, that you barely can sleep. 
After ten minutes we came back and ask to change the room, girl rejected our request immediately, and said: we don't have same rooms more. Are 4 another rooms just vanished for ten minutes? 
Receptionist's answer was rude and wasn't true.

2. In the evening, when we came after shopping and parked across the street, in secured hotel parking place, someone broke front right passenger glass in our car and stole all cloths that he can reach out.. 
We were sure, parking secured properly and easily left bags with cloths in the car. 
It wasn't something really risky to stay unsecured, just cloths. 
But in the morning, we found how wrong we were. 

After hour prolonged local investigation, security person that should keep safe all cars in parking lot, just left with a word ""after you visiting police department, you can come back and we will vacuuming glass out from the car"". Well, thank you then. 
It should make me happier. Especially on the way to Bay Area, more than 500 miles away with broken glass. 
Okay, we have what we have: missed time, almost $1000 harm and worse of all, ruined impressions.

There are a few signs that are misleading as to which building it's in.  One small on that appears to be random building about a 1/2 block to the casino seems really out of place, unless they are offices are something.   Another is the billboard type signage on the building across the street from the casino hotel. Parking Garage maybe?  2nd Tower?  I honestly couldn't tell.   Anyway, it gives the appearance that the Grand is HUGE!

Upon arriving, I discover a very new looking casino - with all new machines.  Very clean and very open.  Much taller ceiling that the casino's on Freemont Street.  I also noticed it wasn't as busy as Freemont Street. In fact, it wasn't busy at all.

The machines were well organized and not crammed into everything corner or extra space like the casino's on Fremont street. While a very clean look, I felt it actually has less to offer as far as gambling was concerned.  

I joined the players club, and received my $10 free play after playing the obligatory amount which takes me about 12 seconds because I usually max bet everything.  Played a couple more machines, and left.  Quite frankly, I was bored.  It took me a few minutes to realize there was a little TV on every slot where you control your players card info.

That's not free, that's ""included"" you can upgrade your Wi-Fi, if you want to pay more per day. The ""free"" Wi-Fi was terrible. We didn't use it. The other very disappointing surprise, was the morning coffee, which used to be included ""free"" in the resort fee, is now $1.00 for a cup and free refills. Well they might as well of handed us a dixicup. The cups are half the size they were when we were there 4 months ago. Literally every time we come, something has been cut, reduced, or just gone, but the resort fees keep going up and up. 

You want your guest to feel like WOW, what a great place and not really concerned about the resort fees, because they include greatness. Please stop cutting services and raising prices. 


Our go-to hotel, when we come to lv, 2-3 times a year. We love the hotel! It's very clean, far enough from the noise of Fremont St, but close enough to walk there. The staff are always so nice and polite. However, we do not eat here anymore. A while back they switched the restaurant to the Freedom Beat. We have given it so many chances and it has been awful every single time. Everything taste like it's days old and cold. We finally gave up and always eat elsewhere. It would be nice to have the old restaurant back. 

Also, if you stay in the Grand tower, there is no ground floor access. They cut that off about the same time they opened the Freedom Beat. We used to have ground access to the Commissary, but for some reason, the Commissary is gone! Long walk to the main tower, via sky-bridge and elevators. If they had decent food and access to the ground floor, I would've given 5 stars.",Q64ittScHim9q6Tqm4Xvtg,2,0,4,ZFoze1enwpC9rrev4-5IMw
4951817,2014-05-11,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,The Commissary at the DT Grand is the place for great rotisserie chicken. If you are in the mood for some casual fare this is the spot. It is across the street from the main casino so you don't get that frenetic charge casinos give off and you can relax. On three separate occasions  enjoyed their tasty chicken with a side of quacamole and chips and a cold beer.

So some office manager named Alex or Alan whatever his name is said  he was going to take care of the situation and everything. He called me and said he would love to put me in a suite at the regular room rate the next time we decide to stay at the hotel. So I decided ok what the hell let's do it. So I called him and thought I made the arrangements with him for another weekend. I gave him all my information and assumed it was booked because he said he will book this for me  so don't worry about a thing. So. Something told me to call and make sure the reservations are made. So I did this 3 days before I was suppose to stay there. The reservation desk had no idea what I was talking about and thought I was a complete moron. Oh. And I forgot to mention that Alex or Allan whatever his name is emailed me a letter stating that I would receive this deal whenever I was ready to except it. So anyway. I digress. I ask to be transfered to Alex or Allen and of course received his  voice mail. Still have not received a call back or nothing.  People. To sum it up. Please DO NOT waste your money or time with this hotel. They obviously care more about the money and revenue they bring in and not the client that   brings it.

I had reserved 3 rooms for 6 couples, and as I'm writing this review they are waiting without rooms and it's already 1.5 hours past their check in time. Because this group of visitors can't speak English that well, they are taking advantage of that and telling them they can get split up into different hotels, or they would have to wait until tomorrow for rooms. How is this even acceptable? I made this reservation over 3 weeks ago. That's THREE weeks. Not today, Not yesterday. I even booked them to go see a show which is in a couple of hours and they are exhausted without rooms. It's been 8 hours since they arrived in Vegas, and they patiently waited for their check in time at the hotel to only be denied of their rooms. This is the worst hotel experience ever.

The reality?  Even through the ear plugs, the room was VERY noisy on the 16th floor.  This was a Thursday night, where the noise continued until 2am.  The weird thing is that there was no music/noise Friday night.  Check in was also NOT good.  Young man could not explain (in three attempts mind you) the self-parking.  He made me out to be an idiot so I just stopped asking and figured it out myself.  When you check into a hotel, you need to be greeted warmly and with knowledge.  He had neither.  But on to the good.  Casino area is very clean and with VERY friendly staff.   Casino floor is VERY small with a VERY limited selection of slots.

Only cons - Valet only, shower doesn't have much pressure, and seriously could use a fwe more trash cans. I also kinda prefer a one switch turns on all the lights too instead of going to each lamp. gym is VERY small - there was only like 4 things. Pool could open earlier than 9AM honestly.

This hotel was acquired and redone a few years ago. The rooms are pretty good sized with many amenities and a surprisingly good bed. Central air. 

I personally will NEVER stay here again for two reasons. $11 valet on the weekends/ $7 during the week. No big deal you say?  Name me another hotel that charges for parking in this town. There ain't. 
You can get one night fee waived if you provide a receipt from Triple George Grill across the street. 
The self parking is across the street in the smelliest, dark and dirty structure. Narrow spaces and smells like pee. 

Second thing is the $19.95 resort fee. C'mon, this ain't the Mirage. The wireless works when it wants. Two 12 oz bottles of water?  Please. 

It's location is close to the hip container area just up the street. The Mob Museum is also nearby.

One thing to note is that there's a LOT of street noise. They do provide earplugs in the room for those who sleep lightly. But seriously, it's Vegas, if you came for peace and quiet, you probably should have stayed in Summerlin. 

Parking sucks. If you have a car you can use valet, but if you're on a motorcycle like I often am in Vegas, you have to park across the street and then haul your crap over. At least it's free. 

We spent a full day at the pool while we were there and that was really cool. The place is really nice, the service is great and the cabana pricing is WAY better than the strip. Basically you're just guaranteeing them a certain amount on the bar tab and the cabana is free. The drinks and stuff weren't terribly out of line either.

Now I will make this a point. We are all locals. We do not need a hotel at all. We chose to stay in this hotel specifically for the bunk bed suite for 4 people. So at check in, we left our baggages with the bell hop and came back in the afternoon for normal check in time. We had valet take the car and they had to come find us because they couldn't figure out how to get the keys out of ignition. Ok, simple mistake. When we finally did get our keys and went to the suite, we found a 1 bed suite for 4 grown adults. We were more than a little bit disappointed. When we contacted front desk, they said they don't know what had happened and that the bunk bed suites were given away to someone else. Once again, we were the first to check in, and did not get the room we reserved and they thought it was ok for 4 people to share 1 bed. They offered 1 roll in bed. We declined. In the end, they gave us another suite on the same floor with another 1 bed and $50 comp to use for restaurants in the casino. So not only did our group separate, we also didn't have enough beds. You don't expect this type of service or mistake from a casino hotel. Please also check out the freedom beat review. Same type of service. First to go in, last to be served. During the night at midnight, we wanted to get more ear plugs. We called the front desk from the hotel phone and cell phone and was put on hold for 27  minutes. I don't see a reason to be out on hold for so long at midnight.  It's Not like its a call center nor did they have every room calling at the same time. So why did it take so long for someone to answer the phone? Next day, we ate breakfast after we have checked out, but when we tried to charge the room, we were not able to b/c they didn't tell us to charge it before we checked out. Another information that was not relayed. It's not like we were embarrassing, berating, or harassing anyone. We were never rude.

The negatives....not much, I didn't like the fact that you have to pay $11 for valet service even if your a guest. The self parking was a across the street in a slightly shady parking structure. To make it worse, if you did pay for valet, most of the cars get parked over the structure so I don't see the point of charging. 

We also had a little trouble with the front desk. We booked our stay through hotels.com and everything was included in our up front payment. I even called a day before to confirm and the front desk confirmed that everything was included in our purchase including the resort fee.

They get a perfect 10 for their attitude.

We stayed here in November and April and the check in was awesome. Despite a small-med sized line we were checked in within 10 mins. When I booked i asked for a low noise room and They accommodated us and put us in another tower facing a parking garage. The room was nice and exactly what we were looking for.

The hotel itself seems a little more upscale than the other offerings in downtown. We've been to every single casino in Fremont multiple times, and this one seems the most relaxed.

They are about 1 side-street away from Fremont. Less than a 3-5 min walk to Fremont. We went back and forth multiple times. They have a few decent places to eat nearby. We tried Pizza Rock and it was awesome!

Because our rooms were away from the bars, it was pretty quiet. There was a small party in the room next to us but it's Vegas so really didn't care. The beds were nice and comfortable.
Our stay in April we had nearly the same room and no noise, it was super Quiet!!!

We recently visited the pool and we were very surprised on how nice and clean it was.
they had a bar close by but did not drink anything.

In the morning hours they have free coffee and it's actually really good. I had a few cups and relaxed in the lounge area. We'll be back again soon! Love your prices!!!",kpZNOAe-A3f8t8RTOjOs0w,8,3,4,NyOe-O2janMKPkoOnNTSCA

First off, we booked it on Expedia for about $50 and it was far better than what we paid for. Everybody from the valet to the bell hop, cleaning lady, concierge and everything in between, was tremendously pleasant and super professional. 

It was the first stop on our road trip and definitely was the best hotel we stayed at. Great work Downtown Grand Staff. Hope to see you again soon.",cFiKarutBJnDr_fqzr2a6g,5,3,5,CmcCz7zHQ6cbHyXIBseKvw

They were putting in a lot of new slot machines, but none of them were paying out either. You absolutely need the ear plugs they provide in the room. I think it's the bar across the street that's just so loud.

5119732,2014-08-10,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"The Grand has been updated very nice. I had originally passed this hotel as a destination point, only because in the past this wouldn't be a hotel or area that was good, even being 1 block off of the main attraction area of freemont...... 

I read several reviews and decided to try it. I wanted something close to freemont. I booked with only two
days before my trip arriving on a Saturday. The room rate was $95.00 plus tax plus resort fees for a total of $127.00.

The hotel was very nice and busy but not packed, it was comfortable . The room was nicely decorated and CLEAN! The furnishings were new, not beat up and I really must stress this room was furnished nicely. Nice comfortable King size bed and the bathroom was CLEAN and udated to match the room. Carpet was new and clean and no spots or stains.....no smell of cigarettes! 

The hotel gaming area was very nice and updated and the hotel center bar was nice with table electronic Keno etc. The staff was polite and personable and funny. NO SMELL OF NASTY CIGARETTE SMOKE, GOOD VENTILATION! 

The Hotel has really come along way from years past. The only thing that they haven't done is updated the parking structure which is detached and across the street. There is a very very small elevator which was absolutely a disgusting mess and very dirty, dated and smelled pretty awful. 

 The parking levels were littered with trash as well as empty beer cans, bottles & food stuffs, jus filthy!  I really didn't want my nice car parked at this location, it was like another world compared to the hotel. They do offer valet service but I didn't want anyone driving my vehicle, and I'm pretty sure they don't park valet parked cars across the street in this parking structure.

Not one time did I see security in the parking structure and checked on my car several times in 24 hours that it was parked. A lot of questionable people lurking around the parking structure both on the street level and various levels in the structure,  it really needs attention with visible security!!  

The hotel did in fact validate my parking ticket and it was free. Upon attempting  to leave the parking garage and using my validated parking ticket the self service automated  machine attempted to charge me, I think 12 bucks or more and wouldn't lift the parking control arm, there is no person working the booth. So basically it's  holding you and  your car hostage waiting for payment...I reinserted my validated ticket several times and the machine finally released me from its clutches and the control arm lifted so I could escape without being strong armed into paying by use of my credit card, which would of been the only way to pay I guess, can't remember if there was a money slot for payment.

Bottom line is it just didn't feel safe in the parking garage and that's to bad they forgot about this portion of the hotel..... I won't park there again!! I'm not sure where I would park and I would need to further investigate other possibilities , simply put without a safe and clean parking garage this could keep me from staying at this great hotel in the future.

The garage filled up on Sarurday nite and it was very packed with cars.

The walking distance to the hotel is just across the street from the parking structure and to freemont street was easy and fast using a pedestrian corridor that was well lighted.

Can't beat the location  and hotel but beware of that parking structure ......

Check in was very slow (300 pm / 330 pm  Saturday) with only two reps working the counter but check out was quick with 4 or 5 reps at 11am on Sunday morning.  All of the charges matched my quoted confirmed booking........

If that parking structure  and elevator gets attention with a good steam cleaning and daily maintenance along with visible security this hotel would deserve a five star plus rating.

My wife brought some to go food to our room from one of the hotel's restaurants at 230am and it was absolutely great, hot and fresh with no issues, eggs , potatoes and sausage with pancakes syrup and whipped butter and a club sandwich that was delicious.

There you have it.......
Be mindful of your surroundings if you choose to use the parking structure.

That's it!!......",SnVmVgcoVW8TE1DVZZ-ySg,4,1,4,w3E0j4ekaEGFHPvdtP1nLg

I do recommend it over all the hotels downtown. Hence, it's newer and the decor is pretty upscale at least for the area. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. However, like others I agree a resort fee of $20 is out of control and unnecessary. As well as the daily valet charge which was $10 when we checked in and then $5 the following day. I mean you're better off staying on the strip! Regardless, since our festivities were at the local spots steps away it was a great stay for us. A staycation never hurts and it's a perk if your having a night out with friends. It's very convenient to be able to walk to and from your room. 

Everyone who visits Las Vegas should definitely spend a day/night downtown to get the historic feel and a taste of the local culture.

The staff in the Lobby and game floors were friendly. When we checked out and got to the car my girlfriend noticed she left an item in our room. I immediately called the hotel and was transferred to Security,  where I was told that no one had turned anything in and I should check in later. I called again later that afternoon, and was told the same thing. I filed a lost and found claim online, and was contacted by the manager Robert Winbush, Who told me to file an incident report on what happened and told me that he would conduct an investigation and call in a few days. After a few days of not hearing anything, I called the hotel and found out Robert had went on vacation and didn't notify me or anything, three more days later I contacted security again to leave a message with him. I received a voicemail the next day from Robert who told me to contact him,  once I contacted the number it went straight to a dead line I had to call the hotel and get transferred but was disconnected and kept trying to call him throughout the day and get them in contact with him. I finally was able to reach him and was told that the investigation came up with nothing and they questioned the housekeeper for that day who said they did not take it. I was then told that it was my own fault for leaving my item and told that it was her word against mine, and I left it at another place. And was told afterwards that it was my own fault and they would do nothing for me. 
I'm extremely unhappy with this hotel and will be telling everyone to stay away and spend the few extra dollars at the nicer hotels on the strip where you'll actually be treated better. If I could give zero stars I would!",5s7jhVdVf_PQQt23h8DPkg,1,0,1,9CtXQvd7wlt4fE1SwWo1_g

Stayed here with a couple of friends during EDC weekend. Nice new hotel in downtown. Got 2 queens for 4 people, right next to the elevator. The room was quite nice. They gave us extra towels when we asked, but never gave us our blowdryer. The shower is a bit strange as you can't close it, but was designed well enough that it didn't matter.

Free internet, was reasonably fast, but not super quick.

Did not really check out any amenities like pool, gym as we were busy most of the time.

Did not end up going to any of the food inside as there were plenty of options in downtown. There's no restaurant that is fast inside.

Free parking with validation from the hotel. The garage is across the street from the hotel. Except for the machines were dysfunctional letting us out, and I had to try multiple times to actually be let out of the garage.

Very close to the highway, so was super convenient to drive to the speedway.

The venue is fairly new or recently updated, which can be seen in the contemporary architecture and interior design.

The room rates are reasonable based on the amenities the hotel offers. As a caveat, add approximately $20 to your rate because when you check-in, there is a mandatory resort fee to cover the ""free"" wi-fi, coffee/tea in the morning until 9am on Mondays through Thursdays, 2 daily water bottles, etc. 

Cleanliness of rooms is standard and room service is daily quick and easy to request. We asked for several towels and housekeeping came up within 2 minutes.

One issue we have with this place is that we were placed in an ADA-accessible room, so there wasn't a shower curtain... So water from the shower flooded the entire bathroom, all the way to the toilet. Hence, the request for extra towels. Hotel management offered to change rooms the next day but we declined due to the additional hassle. We didn't mind as much.

5280969,2016-01-09,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"As a hotel snob, the Downtown Grand is my #2 pick for downtown Las Vegas--sorry but you can't beat the Golden Nugget. I paid one-fourth of the price you would normally pay at a comparable hotel on the Strip. I will say that paying $7 to valet park in Las Vegas (where it is typically free) is a bit off-putting. In other cities like Chicago and San Francisco, I have paid way more to park, but this is Vegas!

The air was thick with the smell of stale smoke. They need to talk to Aria about how to they can purchase the Asian Vanilla Wood scent they use in their hotel, but I digress. At least the casino area was small, so I did not have to walk a long distance to get to the front desk.  

My room had a blue color scheme, which was very calming. The bathroom surprisingly had a modern look.  The areas in need of improvement include the following: TP, shower doors that close properly, descent room service, and sound proof walls (not just ear plugs on the nightstand either).",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,2,3,3,TTzQepsNYF5_yqGEn_GT7w

There were some things that Downtown Grand got right; for the most part the modern decor gave the hotel a nice feel.  However, we weren't fans of the orange walls in the hallways of the hotel room floors.  A couple of oddities about this place that ultimately left us with a bad taste in our mouth and resulted in this 2-star review:

1. There is no lot for self-parking; there is only valet.  Granted, the valet is free; however, this was a HUGE issue during the busiest hours.  When we checked out, it took us an hour to get our car because there were so many people checking out at the same time and the valet attendants had to retrieve everyone's cars at the same time.  My mind shudders to think about what happened to visitors that ended up missing a flight due to the fact that it took so long for them to get their cars!  It's nice to be able to text the valet attendants before coming down to pick up your car, but you still have no idea how long exactly it'll be before your car is ready for you.

2. In order to check out of the hotel, you need to wait in the same line that you waited in to check in.  I don't get this one.  So many other hotels have it so that you can either check out via the in-room TV, or drop your hotel keys in a drop box.  Why is everyone required to wait in line just to check out?",wAo_skbKZ4zse_FmcguktA,9,3,2,BZx78ORbX6nKyuiJfEbLmg

5297768,2016-06-07,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I stayed here for 2 nights because it was very close to my course at UNLV dental school that I was taking over the weekend. 

Location: Just a block down from Fremont Street and right next to Gold Spike! You can easily walk places downtown. I had a car so I was able to go back and forth to the strip. The parking garage at Downtown Grand charges for parking if you aren't a guest, but since I was one, it was validated. Valet is also not free (but I mean the strip is already in the process of charging for valet and parking for MGM properties and might eventually spread!).

Front lobby staff: Like other yelpers say, it's really slow. I think I was the first one in line waiting for 3 people at the front desk, and I was standing there for over 5 minutes. The guy I worked with who checked me in was really nice though. I just found it really funny/odd when he asked me on 3 separate occasions in the span of 3 minutes ""How many cards do you need for your room?"" He didn't even ask it in a way where he was trying to apologize that he forgot. He was asking it to me as if he never asked me the question before . And the lady checking in next to me looked at me and chucked as she noticed what I was going through. 

Casino/stuff to do at the hotel: The casino itself, it's pretty small. I didn't really care much for what was going on here since I was always out.  I was just here for sleeping purposes. They do have one little restaurant and bar and a pretty nice swimming pool though!

Room: Very clean! The bed was comfy and big and pillows were very soft. I even liked how you could extend a table out of your nightstand to place more stuff. I found no issues with the room itself. It was perfect! 

Bathroom: I really liked the style of the shower. I had a similar shower at a hotel I stayed in Chicago with a half glass shower door but I think the hotel shoulda considered making the shower head to come straight down from the ceiling to avoid splashes outside like other people complain in reviews. I think my only complaint would have to be to be the sink because while it does have a nice design, I noticed water splashing out of the sink when I washed my face or brushed my teeth. 

I never had an issues going to sleep with the sound going on outside. But that just may be because I went out at night and arrived late to my hotel ready to sleep like a baby. 

Overall verdict: If you're looking for a hotel that is affordable and great quality, I highly recommend this place!",Rzs4pdzUSIh8fmhQENY15A,4,0,4,r8cGJUtMdpH5P-f8894ibQ
5304378,2014-12-30,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"We had a regular room with 2 queens.  The room was very large, which was nice, but they should really think about getting a larger TV.  From the bed, you can't read it, even with 20/20 vision. The shower, as others have mentioned, has only one glass side door. I mean only one half of a door, half of the water ends up on the floor.  Also it is a solid glass door that doesn't slide. So, short people like me can't barely reach around the door to turn on the water.  And what if you put the shower on too hot?  Well, you have to burn your arm to turn it down.  I think the hotel was going for a modern look, but should have really went for a functional shower.  

As I mentioned, there is a whole lot of space in this room.  You would think with all this space, they could have a $50 fridge in the room.  Or a coffee maker or microwave would be nice.

They do provide you with ear plugs for the noise outside.  It didn't seem to bad to me, but we stayed on a weekday in winter.

Valet staff were incredibly nice and there was free valet.

Oh yes, the hotel has two towers.  They should really think of color coding.  Many....and I mean MANY people were lost trying to get to their hotels rooms.  Including us.  Then we asked the non-English speaking maid, and she had no idea there was another tower.  Crazy mess.

5310315,2017-07-10,6,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I grew up with family in Vegas.  My mom's aunt and uncle were semi-pro gamblers, so I spent the 80s learning keno at Binion's and bingo at Sam's Town.  That being said, I love downtown.  I am not going to lie, every stay, I wistfully long for 1.99 steak and eggs and 50 cent keno at Binion's, but the gas crisis is over, Reagan is gone, and those days are long past.

Nonetheless, I stay downtown every other trip to Vegas.  Almost always at the Nugget - it appeases my wife as a ""Strip-like"" hotel.  But, this time, I sought variety (and a deal), so we went to the Downtown Grand.  

Sure, it's the old dumpy ass Lady Luck.  But, it's been redone, and it's nice.  Don't let the earplugs in your room fool you - it was a pretty nice room, and, after the cheap drinks downtown (and free drinks at the tables in the lobby), I slept like a heavily intoxicated baby.  (Remember that smoking baby from Indonesia?  I slept like that).

We stayed in the premium tower, so we got a beautifully red corner room - it was seriously huge.  Added bonus, my wife had a great view across the street where they were filming some semi-pro porn video in another tower.  (No, seriously, she took pictures).  The pool area was super nice, and I liked the free water in the room (because you know - you get screwed on that stuff everywhere else).

Ok, so why not 5 stars?  They seemed a little short on staff, when I checked in, there was only one valet working, so I waited half an hour to unload my luggage.  There were only two people working at checkout, so there was a long line.

5322913,2014-07-20,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"The Downtown Grand is just that: Grand.

Formerly Lady Luck, the property has been completely gutted, remodeled, and modernized. The Grand is swanky, hipster, and chic. As all Vegas hotel-casino combos do, there are tables games, card games, and multiple slots that sing and dance and light up. The Grand also hosts the Art Bar (pro-tip look up when drinking them down here) and Mob Bar and several little decked out spots on the casino floor. There is a small diner located on the property (Stewart and Ogden) and Red Mansion (which is only open on select nights) and there are a host of several awesome, locally owned establishments across the street (Pizza Rock, Triple George, Hogs and Heifers, and various other awesome places within reasonable walking distance). What's really cool about the Grand is that there are signs telling you which direction these places are located. PROPS! The Grand's pool is called Picnic (free access when staying) which has faux grass, is kid friendly, and has a variety of specials.

The rooms did not disappoint either. For $63 a night, you're furnished with awesome views of the city, a large king bed, a large flat screen tv, free wifi, and because downtown tends to get loud, ear buds. The rooms have also been updated and have a modern touch until you get to the bathrooms. No big tub, no fan for when you go boo-boo, and it isn't anything really too special.

5351119,2015-06-11,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I stayed at this hotel in the casino tower, on a high floor (room 1535). Perfect location to get to everything including the pool, the casino, restaurants, lobby and The Freemont experience. Almost a requirement for me as I like to sleep when it's bedtime and other parts of the hotel are LOUD (there are ear plugs in your room but I didn't need them once)

Positives: 
The price: I paid $39.00 for a non-smoking king bed room in early June. 

Rooms: The rooms underwent a great remodel with nicer finishes. Rooms look refreshed and updated. They are comfortable with the items you would expect including a safe, complimentary bottled water, a hairdryer, shampoo/conditioner/lotion/soap and plenty of room for your stuff. There were some complaints about the positioning of the shower head location and the water temperature. I didn't experience those issues or perhaps I showered early enough and my arms were longer to turn the shower on without getting wet.

Location: If you like downtown this is perfect. You can walk everywhere and it's easy to find your way. Literally next door to the Freemont experience, the Mob museum and so many great little casinos and restaurants. Personally I like the El Cortez for gambling downtown but that is just where I have had the best luck and most fun.

The pool: Holy cow. Unexpected for downtown. It's perfect. Lots of shade too. I went early in the morning (opens at 9:00) to avoid the party crowds and it was heavenly.

Staff: super nice and accommodating. Really great here.

NEGATIVES:
Room cleaning/towels: Every third day. Um what? So I am probably spoiled, but I want my room tidied and fresh towels everyday. Very disappointing although I supposed more green.

Casino: Small,  small, small. Really if you just want to roll out in your pjs and gamble with the free morning coffee from the commissary, then fine. If you want a game selection...explore  some of the bigger ones close by. I knew it was small but it's REAL small.

Pillows/AC: Pillows as Hard as rocks. AC blasts all the time no matter what it's set on. I mean I get it...is 112 degrees outside...but I literally had to cover my head with the blanket so I didn't get pneumonia (that was a bit dramatic but you get the idea).

Food: two words: Pizza Rock. It's right across from the casino floor. Get a slice to go of whatever (late at night is when it tastes best) and an icy cold cherry coke. It's heavenly, I promise. The other two are just ok...the commissary and the S + O. Didn't go to Hogs and Heifers or the Steakhouse.

Cab fare: from the airport it was $40 with tip. High. I think you can get a town car for the same price and not have to sweat to death in the cab line upon arrival. To the Bellagio it was around $28.

Promotions: New guests get a coupon book but really, not impressive. I got $5 in free play for getting a card. This should be better considering how small the casino is and how little people seem to win there.

So in short I would absolutely stay here again. I love the location so much and the rates are super reasonable. I love the strip too but it's a totally different experience. If you love downtown, give it a shot.",Z8AL_JyIUZE9QYjm-eLXHw,6,1,4,OR5L6L60MAhI2yQIlVmGsg

If we were eating or gambling they would validate our parking, but not if we were actually staying at the hotel!  We followed their directions around the back to park and check-in prior to self-parking.  As we pulled in we could hear super loud music from the club across the street and loud motorcycles, not to mention the whole area reeked of weed.  When we checked in we asked for the quieter side of the hotel, and the clerk simply said there was nothing available on the quiet side.  We decided to see how bad it was and had our bags brought up to the room.

When we got to the room it was just as loud as standing on the street!  In fact, the room actually came with two sets of foam earplugs on the nightstand!!  We were told the noise went at least until 3:00am every night.  No one was going to sleep with the walls rattling so we turned around, lugged our own luggage back down to the car and demanded a refund.

If riding the DEUCE, you can get off at either Fremont Street Experience or Stewart @ 4th. The latter is the closer stop, but some lazy bus drivers will try to end the route at Fremont if you're the only one left on the bus.

The lobby is really nice, without being pretentious or overdone. The casino is small, but that was no problem since I gamble no more than $5-10 per visit to Las Vegas.

My room, on the 16th floor of the casino tower, was pretty much perfect. Spacious, clean, and newly remodeled, my only minor complaints were the shower (low water pressure or overly efficient showerhead) and the sink (completely flat and very shallow, so it splashed quite a bit and it was tricky to fit a cup or bottle under the faucet).

I stayed here for the 4th of July weekend, and the hotel hosted a special BBQ on the pool deck (which, by the way, has the only rooftop pool downtown). The food and selection were great, and I definitely got my money's worth. They customarily do barbecues every Friday evening.

During my visit, I ate at Pizza Rock (across the street) and S+O/Stewart & Odgen (off the casino floor), and I was happy with both. Pizza Rock was very overpriced, but the food and ambiance were worth it. S+O is obviously budget-oriented and it shows, but for $9.99 prime rib, it can't be beat.

5400297,2018-04-09,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"My family & I stayed at The Downtown Grand this past week. The lobby is very clean & modern, along with the room. We stayed in the deluxe room, with two full size beds, & flat screen tv. There are is no coffee pot or mini fridge in these rooms. 
There is an enclosed bridge that connects the two towers. 

It is within walking distance of Freemont Street, The Container Park (highly recommend if you are traveling with kids), & the MOB Museum which was nice. I did read on another Yelp review that if you are traveling with a toddler/baby it is best to request a room on the opposite side of Freemont Street, being that it is very loud & you can hear the bands/DJ's playing throughout the night. So I took that advice since my daughter is 1.5 years old. I asked for a further room when I booked my stay as well as requested a crib/pack n' play for my daughter to sleep in. 

The reason I have given The Downtown Grand 3 stars is because I was told the pack n' play would be set up in the room on our arrival date. It wasn't, so I called the front desk at about 5:30 pm once we were unpacked- I was told they were a little behind but it should be on it's way up in about 20 min. - No big deal... Then that 20 min turned into 3 HOURS. 
I called twice within those 3 hours & was told it should be up to our room shortly. When that didn't happen I had to go down to the front desk to complain. By that time my daughter was VERY tired & ready for bed. They apologized and gave us a $20 credit for their Freedom Bar & Restaurant they have downstairs. We didn't leave the room on our first night there due to thinking we would miss them bringing the pack n' play up. So that was very inconvenient. 

Reason number 2, the pool was very nice & family oriented BUT almost half of the white metal couches didn't have any cushions. So if you got there late you had to scramble to find other small pillows to piece together to put on the metal couches. So if you don't want to sit on the turf, or a hard metal couch frame you should get to the pool as soon as it opens.",E-rva4-pndAJ2aFweaUzPA,1,0,3,q2jko1QoMLufH3IA5lXg0A

5441742,2017-08-05,6,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Will never ever ever stay here again for sooooooo many reasons. I wish I'd have read the Yelp reviews before booking/staying. 

1 - hotel is on the most awkward street ever
2 - pulled up to valet, realized i don't have cash. Told valet gentleman and he said I can park across the street in their lot for free 
3 - Played chicken to get across the street. Remember, this hotel is awkwardly located
4- get to lot, realize (as I'm going up and up) that the higher I go the more unsafe it looks.
5- call the hotel FOUR DAMN TIMES, pressing 3 to reach the concierge for assistance. On hold while it rings maybe 10-15 minutes. Call back and press zero for operator.  This takes me to the lobby where they check you in. I asked her if they offer free valet and let her know I don't have cash. She tells me that the valet guy was supposed to tell me that the charge can be placed on hotel tab. Le sigh. 
6 - take my frickin parking ticket and car and leave the parking lot. But not without paying 8 frickin dollars to park from 9:04-9:22. WTF!!!!
7- played chicken to get back across the street. Pull up to valet and see the same guy. He's like ""oh your back!!""  I explain what happened and he's all ""yeah! You can put it on your tab. Sorry! And you should have pressed the help button to get out of the garage without paying"". Seriously bro? 
8 - get to lobby to check in. Wait in line about 10 minutes. Check in person is the same person I spoke to on the phone. Tell her about the $8. She's all ""oh you could have pressed the help button"" sorry I didn't tell you that on the phone.""  What in the complete eff!!!!!
9 - talk to manager and tell her I'm not pleased. Said to dispute the charge for the parking and apologized. Great, something else I need to do. No, let me waive your valet for one night. Nothing. Sigh. Whatever. 
10 - I had to trek to get to my room. Fine. 
11 - opened the door and the fucking tv turns on by itself and it's loud as fuck. Scared the shit out of me. Why the HELL would a hotel do this automatic bullshit at night!?!?!!!
12 - I hate this room. Looks weird
13 - I have been here all of 40 minutes and I've itched the entire time. Not sure if it's the sheets or what but I am
Itchy AF.  Had to take Benadryl. 
14 - There is no enclosure on the shower. Just half a glass window near the front. 
15 - The room is dark even with the lights on. And there is only one light in the bathroom so it's dark in there too. 


I have absolutely no confidence that my stay will improve tomorrow. I wish I could go home now but I can't. I will never stay here again. As a Cali native I've been to Vegas numerous times and honestly I think this hotel is the worst I've experienced to date.",Tf4jjIe_t2AUfp-4nKGaGA,4,0,2,KHc0Vkd2yPdNG3snZCmHmg
5444860,2014-12-14,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Ah, the artist *cough* I mean building formerly known as the Lady Luck. 

I know it as the place my aunt worked at when she first moved to Vegas way back in the 80s. I remember wandering around it quite a few times as a young one (as a teen I wandered around Fremont St. in general really). It was a garish and smoky monstrosity on the inside with pink tube lighting and mirrored walls and ceilings. And yet on the outside it basically just looked like a big ol' office building. It still had a strange charm to it though. 

Then it closed. And sat. Idle. For almost 10 years. In 2013, it FINALLY reopened as the Downtown Grand.

It's nice that this corner is no longer dark and idle. It's also nice to have an active 3rd Street Corridor leading from Fremont to Stewart where The Mob Museum is. And I LOVE the exterior. I just adore the Gilded Age/Roaring Twenties influence they were going for.

And yet, upon walking in, my expectations fell kinda flat. I was definitely expecting something akin to the exterior, a 20s sort of vibe, and yet it felt very sterile. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something just seemed to be missing from the place.

I would be open to returning (it's probably inevitable either way since I spend quite a few friday nights just wandering from place to place in and around Fremont anyway). The rooms look fantastic, I've heard lot's of good things about The Mob Bar and I enjoy the little Downtown 3rd area that's popped up, but beyond that, eh.

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Enticing exterior
Helping to rejuvenate the vicinity
Appealing rooms and lounges

Cons:
The fun exterior just doesn't translate well to the interior.

5450865,2014-08-15,1,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Downtown Grand has potential, but some policies are not clear.

There's a major problem with the extra $18 fee charged per day and what that covers. You do not get any paperwork of what you are signing. 

Keith, working the hotel desk, said that bottles of water were complimentary on day of check in. The maid also said this...but she added that if you want water each day you should call housekeeping or leave them a note (but paper and pen are not provided).

When a manager of the hotel was asked what the $18 covers each day, she printed off their website when you reserve a room and the note mentions ""Please note: Grand Experience Fee of 18.00 per day includes high speed internet access, in-room bottled water, local and toll free calls, morning coffee at one of multiple locations and our Grand Experience Book featuring a variety of discount and complimentary offers from Downtown Grand Las Vegas, etc...""

It seems to me that they pretty much do what they want, when they want. Can't run a business successfully that way, in my opinion.

They also have specials which say that they can be discontinued at any time...no notice.

You have to be savvy about where the specials are...which bar and which restaurants because the staff will not necessarily tell you that you can get a $2 domestic beer at the bar showing your players card instead of $6 for a Corona Light. 

You do hear everything in other rooms...the first night the room next door left their TV on loud all night. No sleep. 

Being near Fremont St. is fine but if your room faces it, you will deal with the noise until it closes up for the night.

We are here for 2 weeks from an Expedia deal. The hotel is ok and as I wrote it has potential.

We have another week to go and that will determine whether we ever come back.",xeQuks1wAs5GU-BZno1vgA,3,1,3,9s0gYJBK-ArlMRMaGYkhdg

I think we paid $109/night on the weekend, so it's in line with everywhere else around. There were some BOGO coupons for drinks at the art bar and mob bar in the guest packet, so we tried some new things cheap.  Haven't eaten here yet, but the restaurants look to have some good selections.

I think they own the whole block, including the triple George and the pizza rock (hell, yes, that was good around 3am!).

 Located on 3rd st it is nicely set back from the seedy environment of the Freemont st. It almost has it's own little private block, closed off my the Mob Museum and the nice row of restaurants, has a safe, secluded and clean feeling.

 Took me a while to figure out that the parking structure is across the street, valet had to explain it to me, I kept trying to storm employee parking area. Structure is free to hotel guests, valet does charge $7/night. 

 I was offered a choice of either tower upon check in, kids wanted to be up high, so we stayed on the highest floor we could have at the pool tower- 17th. Second tower is 25 stories high, but we want to be a little closer to the pool. The Commissary offers free coffee for the hotel guests 6-9am, which is a nice touch. Free WiFi, two free bottles of water and a few coupons for dining and play to get you going all come in handy. 

 Property is updated, fresh and modern, decor of the hotel and rooms leave little to be desired. 
Loved the pool located on the roof of the 3rd floor and the panoramic view of the surrounding area it affords. Nice bar with reasonably priced cocktails and a selection of beers on tap, food options are available as well. Kids had a nice pool side lunch, and I may or may not have enjoyed a few cocktails and beers. Pool setting is also very pretty as well as lounging areas, which are plenty. 

 Restaurants across the street are Triple George, Pizza Rock and Hogs and Heffers. We have visited two out of three before, but kids pushed for Pizza Rock, and it was all about them anyway, so there we went. 

 Topped off the night with a zipline over Freemont, deep fried Oreos and Twinkies from Mermaids and tucked in for a night of comfortable sleep.

5661398,2016-04-23,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"Not horrible, but nothing to call home about.

First off, self parking is free! But do yourself a favor and skip that, and spend the money for valet. The self parking garage is not monitored by security (at least, the dozen times I've been in there since DG opened, I have never seen a single security guard), and the stairs to access it (among everywhere else in the garage), are frequently used as a bathroom by drunk people - watch out for puddles (unless you're into that). You can also find plenty of beer bottles, drink glasses, solo cups, empty cans, etc that make you really wonder if you want to leave your car in this place with the people ""driving"" around in there. There's a sign in the casino near the front that says how many gaming points you need to earn to have parking charges (valet included) waived. Not sure if this is your best return on the investment, as you'd have to gamble $100+ to save $5 on parking. 

The casino is cute, very industrial feeling. It is small, and doesn't have a lot of table games. I seem to remember more being there when they opened, but last time I was there, it appeared most had been replaced with video slot machines. 

Hotel rooms are eh. They're remodeled, but in a very budget fashion. Yes, showers only. Yes, the shower has a weird glass door that doesn't close and will get the floor wet. The beds are pretty thin/flat. But if you were going for comfort, you wouldn't be staying here. And the resort fee - yes, this is Vegas, and they will nickel and dime you for everything. And yes, you agree to a resort fee when you book the room. However, that doesn't mean you can't say you don't agree with the value of it. A couple bottles of water and access to the pool is not worth $20/day. If you stay on the strip, or even in some other places downtown, you will pay a similar resort fee and get about 100x the value for it. Will you use it? Maybe. But again back to the fact that you're staying here because it's cheap means you probably just want to get drunk and crash and leave. They should at least waive the valet charges. Ice machines are on every other floor (odd numbers, I believe). 

Then there's Pizza Rock, which is a must visit if you like quality pizza. Of course, if you're a local, you can now go to the one at Green Valley Ranch, which is about 1000x nicer of a place to be at than Downtown Grand. Too bad none of the hotel food ""offers"" include Pizza Rock. 

Honestly, it's a decent place to crash for the night. If you want a better experience, spend a few more bucks and stay on Fremont. Or spend a couple more bucks and stay on the strip - your dollar will go a lot farther there. 

Will I be going back? No.",MQ7BoAs7XWXeuJPmiMa0aw,3,0,2,L0-tKNKqH4roMf5GieNkZQ
5663474,2014-07-16,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I received a comp in the mail from the Downtown Grand. I am a VIP Platinum member in the Venetian Palazzo and they treat me like garbage. Jessica Hernandez booked my complimentary reservation over the telephone. She was very courteous and professional. Very friendly! This is what I expect from the so called Five Diamond Resorts I am loyal to and spend so much money on. Those joints probably bribe AAA for the 5 Diamond Award  just for the prestige. The smaller places want your business and they are showing you that they want it by excelling in great service.

Thank you Jessica. I hope I enjoy my stay and I look forward to being a patron. I am tired of so called  5 Diamond  joints that treat VIP's like everyday garbage and give you attitude, I salute you for your outstanding service.


Next up, I will rate my stay.

The place was clean, and the staff were very friendly. This place deserves more people in their casino because you can tell they put a lot of time an effort into renovating. The hotel is kinda cute and has a small work out room. Pretty budget hotel.

I am one of those guilty one of playing in the bigger casinos. But next time I will give them a try.",5i_Hd6u_BNOAxtjbmV5luA,3,0,5,TKlcB8P0asDzctk8RZtjSg

5667389,2014-06-10,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"So my short review is we liked this place a lot and would definitely stay there again......now on to the details and pros/cons

We decided to have a fun (staycation!!) night on Fremont St. and go to First Friday (let me add here that F.F was 1.5 miles away, which I was not aware of...we walked it, but that was a surprise, apparently I need to pay more attention to where things are located) Anywho, we got a King Suite and really enjoyed it. 

Pros:

Check in was fast and room was ready early for us. Room looked/felt very clean. Bed was great. I slept very well and I am usually a bad sleeper in hotel rooms. Room was very stylish and large. Two bathrooms. Fixtures were very swanky/modern. Pair of earplugs in room (definitely needed..see cons below) Air conditioning was nice and cold. 2 free waters in room, along with a refrigerator you can put your own stuff in. Free coffee downstairs in the morning. Dealers were very nice at the tables and the slots were fairly loose, especially if you are comparing them to the Strip. 

Cons: These things didn't necessarily bother us, but I am trying to think of things other people may be bothered by

$50 hold on your card for possible room damage. Walls/Windows were THIN. You could hear the people next door like they were in your room and the street noise past 4am. Furniture had some stains...which of course, being in Vegas makes you think of what nefarious situations left those stains, but since the room felt pretty clean to me overall, I wasn't really bothered by it. Shower was open (no door/curtain) with just a small pane of glass covering about half which made it fairly cold (being open to the large bathroom and room) and also allowed water to get on the floor. Air conditioner was loud, again didn't bother me, but just wanted to mention it. 

So like I said, I would stay again for sure. I liked it much better than other places we have stayed on the strip. We didn't get a chance to check out the pool which looked beautiful and it made me wish we had booked an additional night. Hopefully we can make it back again soon :-)",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,3,2,4,zZwjjbL_0BARtFLUqpA7uw

I dislike how the hotel rooms reek of smoke even if you request a non smoking room. our view was next to the mob museum! winning! They provide 2 bottles of water in your room during your stay along with ear plugs.  the cons were water pressure in the shower, it was horrible.. the water would drop to no pressure and appear to turn off then kick back on. it took twice as long to shower, it was a gorgeous bathroom just it had a half shower door so beware water will splash on the floor and you have to use more than 2 towels to keep the floor slip free.  one last disclaimer is when you check in they put an automatic $100 deposit hold on your account temporary but you do get it back.

I've not stayed in the hotel, so I can't really talk about the rooms.  They also don't have any ""self"" parking, it's valet only.  Speaking of valet - they also prvide free parking for Pizza Rock, which is just around the corner.  The best part is that you can text a number on your valet ticket and ask to have your car pulled around.  This makes it MUCH quicker and will be amazing in the summertime when it's too hot to wait outside.

First of all, for a Wednesday late check in, they did not have the room requested (king sized bed) was given a double. Most hotels on the strip will accommodate the guests by offering a complimentary upgrade or something like within that nature.. But I didn't really expect much other then the room which we booked.

When the hotel first opened, the resort fee was affordable and was only $11; a year or two later, the fee is not $22.95! They offered the guests complimentary wi-fi and free coffee from the beginning, but now charges $7 or $11 for valet parking. We don't use valet but when I overheard that, I was dumbfounded. 

When we called front desk to ask for a later checkout time, the front desk lady told me ""unfortunately, we have a high occupancy this evening..we can't.."" I asked"" not even for an hour?""

Hotel gave commentary ear plugs but never used them. Only heard the neighbouring rooms rarely but spent little time in my room. I MEAN IT'S VEGAS WHY BE IN THE ROOM AT ALL!

From things as simple as non automatic entrance doors (trust me it matters when you're carrying all of your luggage from the OFF property parking across the street) to hard as a rock pillows...  the way things are run is just subpar...  not worth the money. 

Had to argue at check in to not be in a different room each day (yes, I had a reservation), called asking for different pillows and was on hold for half an episode of Roseanne, of course what they brought are the identical pillows we had, rocks.

No sound proofing what so ever so hope you enjoy hearing every song from Freemont St (even though it's blocks away), HALF a roll of toilet paper (just odd lol) that is worse than sand paper, and WiFi so horrible you just turn it off.  Yeah, the owners are cheap.  Place looks cool, that's about it.  Not worth half the price.

5761039,2013-12-24,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"The Downtown Grand is the pearly gateway to Downtown Las Vegas.  The upbeat and modern city grandeur coupled with warm Las Vegas hospitality.  Every single member of the staff is eager to go out of their way.  The Downtown 3rd family including the Downtown Grand Hotel, have created the sense of cultural atmosphere previously lacking in Las Vegas.  The hotel is beautiful; rooms are modern, yet conservative; casino although smaller, is complete with an array of slot machines and slot tournaments, a plethora of tables; a sports book; and a variety of bars throughout the main floor.  I was completely blown away by such a wonderful experience.

5771716,2014-10-05,2,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"It's too bad I could only rate this hotel with three stars because the hotel itself is great.

It's fully renovated with nice spacious rooms. It's a nice medium size boutique hotel and definitely the best in the are when it comes to rooms. All other hotels in the area are old and you can definitely feel that.

Staff is friendly here and they accommodated all our requests. Valet is free and access to the rooms is easy. 

Having into consideration the price of this hotel getting rates as low as $18 during the week you can't really complaint about it. 

Now let's get to the bad:

- They close down the street right next to the front entrance and thru have different celebration. They have a bar in the street with strippers. I'm ok with all these. My problem is when right on the street they will grab a mic to talk to people and start using language with F******, ass, shi* etc... And the bigger problem is when your son actually can hear that on the 22nd floor of the hotel. That's not cool. This will take me to the next issue.

- I don't understand why they didn't add soundproof glass. It's extremely noisy and you hear everything that's going on outside. They even place earplugs at your room so that should tell you how bad it is. If you are a light sleeper then don't even think about staying here or you will be miserable.

- Shower only has half door and the floor gets wet a lot.

- Their wifi is beyond horrible. I mean... I can't even explain it. Remember those old days where you had to dial to get online and wait several minutes? Well, you will go back in time because you will have to wait several minutes to open a web or refresh you FB. This bothered me as I use Internet often and the hotel has a mandatory resort fee of $18 per day that includes wifi. Are you kidding me? Technically yes, they offer wifi but you won't be able to use it. 

- self parking is across the street and if you have a lot of stuff is hard to carry everything out.",beMkFfyPUB2LORU1ponmwg,6,2,3,XxvC4vy8tg-STzrx6CUcog

Excellent room rate at $42, resort fee $20 so not too bad a rate compared with Golden Nugget at almost double the price. Greeted at valet by a friendly guy who showed excellent customer service. This was a prelude to our entire stay as everyone we came in contact with was nice, friendly, and very helpful. Especially Jonnie at the pool who was always smiling as she hustled from place to place and seemed to be the only one working the pool area. Drinks at the pool weren't the most fancy, but they also weren't ridiculously priced as some places. The pool isn't really much other than 3.5 feet deep of cool water to set the heat of the day back. 

The room was very nicely decorated, modern, and comfortable. No complaints at all. In fact, no complaints about anything here except the machines were a bit tight. Fortunately we wandered around and Golden Nugget provided numerous winners that paid for everything and my friend had an extra $600 for her move, and I walked with a few hundred more than I started with. 

Conveniently located across from Pizza Rock and Triple George Grill, and just a block away from the Fremont Experience so it wasn't quite as noisy as other places. 

I rarely give out 5 stars, but I felt this was a great price and great accomodations, and the customer service was top notch from everyone we came in contact with. I really liked checking out on the TV, and texting valet to get the truck ready which timed out perfectly as we walked out the door.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,13,6,5,CNxtSRpi0yQlBD7GLOY9cw

I travel on business A LOT and have seen the inside of a ton of hotel rooms, and I would rank the Grand in the top 20 percentile - with some exceptions (I will address those in a bit).

First the good: great location. The hotel is located a block or so away from Fremont so you are right near the evening festivities, plus it's right across the street from the Mob Museum (a must-see visit). Breakfast at Stewart-Ogden bistro was quite good and very filling. 

The hotel itself is very, very nice. The rooms are ok - nothing really spectacular but they're clean, spacious, stylish and adequate (reminds me of an upscale Holiday Inn - which has really stepped up their game over the last couple of years).

The bad: No in-room fridge. 

The ugly: The shower. Not sure what the designers were thinking but function should sometimes take precedence over form. It's glass enclosure is a partial one so you get a bad draft into the shower. It really sucks; while your front is getting hit with hot water, your backside is getting whacked by cold air. Not cool.

Overall, it's a good value. If you can get past the ""unfinished"" shower, you'll enjoy your stay.",99oPCoJQZaZJZoEZqAR_Jw,7,0,3,2_75ZN0sdvHaLcuQu47eMw

5873545,2014-04-15,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"This hotel just re-opened a couple months ago (former Lady Luck) , and is now one of the nicer hotels in Downtown Vegas.  Service was great here; everyone was so accommodating.  

A few things to note about the hotel-

1. There are 2 towers, with a bridge connecting the 2 towers.  After a certain time at night, you have to go the long way, out of the main tower to exit the hotel.  If you are carrying your own luggage to your room it can be a bit of a hassle.  

2. Our room was facing the motorcycle bar at the bottom of one of the towers.  The hotel provided us complimentary ear plugs, I guess because it can be pretty noisy with the motorcycle bar right below the rooms.  We didn't need to use the ear plugs though.

3.  I guess with all the updates they did to the hotel, they didn't have enough money left to put a full shower door in.  Just kidding.  But the shower in our room consisted of a glass wall that only covered half of the shower, the other half of the shower was left open.  None of my friends, nor I were too fond of the shower.  If you move around in the shower you're definitely going to splash water outside on the floor.  Also, there were no bars or anything in the shower to hang up the washcloth.  It was a very 'modern'.

First off, this place is a complete 180 from the old Lady Luck Casino. Man... was that place dodgy. Anyway, the remodel did an amazing job with place and it really reflects the new life being breathed into downtown LV. Now on to what matters. 

Room: The room was adequate in size and the furniture all retro modern and new. The bed was very comfortable and all the amenities perfect.

Casino: The usual casino with the full array of table games and video poker and slots. Nothing to crazy here. It wasn't smoke filled either which was nice. That new casino ventilation system must work really well. 

Front Desk/Staff: Everyone was really friendly and very helpful during our stay. When we checked in, they gave us a coupon book with tons of buy one get one free drink and entree coupons.

5895233,2015-01-20,40,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I'm on the fence about this somewhat new hotel Downtown LV.  The hotel itself is nice, well-decorated and in a great location but there was just something that was missing.  I saw that the average rating for this hotel was 3 stars on Yelp and the 4 and 5 star reviews had some really great things to say and my friend told me she loved this hotel so I booked a 5-night stay.

LOCATION  |  I like the location of the hotel being off Fremont St. away from the madness but a quick walk to Fremont when I felt like being where the action was at.  The hotel has a prime location right across the street from the Mob Museum and Gold Spike.

CHECK -IN  |  The process was pretty seamless.  They have a small lobby and I checked in at close to midnight so there was no line.  The customer service was OK and I would have liked if the employee was more informative instead of me having to ask questions about Wi-Fi, express checkout, etc.  

ROOM  |  The room was nice and bright and I loved the modern look and feel to it.  The room had just about everything (safe, iron, hair dryer, etc.) except a fridge or mini bar.  I loved the long counter in the bathroom but was so confused about the shower.  There weren't any curtains and the shower door only covered half of the shower.  ¯\_(?)_/¯

ROOM SERVICE  |  So the ""In Room Dining"" as they call it consisted of take-out from Stewart and Ogden, the restaurant on the first floor near the lobby.  Stewart and Ogden's food is pretty good (separate review to come) but our food got delivered to our room in takeout boxes and plastic bags which was fine but I guess with a name like ""Downtown Grand"" I just expected a little more like the usual plated meals on a tray.  

CASINO  |  Downtown Grand's casino floor is pretty small compared to some of the other hotels downtown but being a newer hotel, the casino didn't have a prominent  cigarette smell like most other downtown hotels, which was nice.  They have a rewards program called ""My Points Downtown Grand"" and you can sign up for a card right outside of Stewart and Ogden.  I mostly played roulette and lost some money but had fun in the process because the dealers were pretty friendly.  

FOOD & DRINK  |  S + O (Stewart and Ogden) is their main restaurant right at the edge of the casino floor across the sports book.  Food isn't bad there and they're known for their $9.99 prime rib plate.  The Art Bar is a small bar located next to the lobby and is good for drinks and appetizers.  The Commissary was my favorite.  It's a restaurant, coffee shop and café rolled into one with a nice, clean, fresh and spacious ambiance.  The Furnace is the bar in the middle of the casino and the Ninth Island is at the corner of the casino near the street entrance.  Although I love the name ""Ninth Island"" (reference to Hawaii locals), the drinks weren't for me.  They serve sweet alcoholic drinks like daiquiris and shaved ice which is nothing like the shave ice back home.  Picnic, a restaurant and bar is located on the pool deck.  

PARKING & VALET  |  The parking garage for Downtown Grand is located across the street and valet is free for hotel guests.  The valet employees were nice but they all lacked sense of urgency.  At almost every other hotel I've been to, their valet hustles and literally runs to get cars and brings them back quickly for guests.  At the Downtown Grand...nope.  Each time, we had to wait a long time for our car to pull up and one of the last times we waited for our car, we waited for almost 20 minutes.  This isn't acceptable for me, especially when the Downtown Grand isn't one of the busy hotels on the main strip or even downtown.  There wasn't an instance during my stay where the valet lanes were busy or full so not sure what the holdup was.  

ETC  |   The pool is located in the casino tower, on the 3rd floor.  There's a fitness room available to guests 24 hours a day.  There are heaters on the sidewalk near valet for those cooler desert nights.  Housekeeping leaves a couple of bottled waters in your room every day.    

POST CHECK-OUT  |  My credit card was charged twice for my stay.  I called the hotel and got transferred several times but was able to talk to Brent, a manager who was apologetic and took care of my refund.  Not a big deal and I'm glad that Brent took care of everything but really?!  Double-charging for my stay?  No Bueno.  

Overall, the Downtown Grand is a nice hotel and room rates are reasonable but they just missed the mark somehow.  I think that Michael U's review hit the nail on the head with them struggling on their branding.  I still don't know what to make of this place.  When you walk into a hotel, or any business for that matter, you can pretty much tell what they're about and what their theme is.  I feel like the Downtown Grand is all over the place.  I'd stay at the Downtown Grand again but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,52,44,3,DmYEFljptagjjxnPgGEjCA

The hotel is newly redecorated, and I really enjoyed the pool/picnic area and the comfy beds. The bathroom is very odd, and I was given a ""handicap accessible"" room to boot, so the my bathroom was even weirder than what others yelped about (no shower curtain, weird bench in shower, no counter space or soap holders in the showers, loud flushing toilet... lots of floor space for a wheelchair tho!)  I also got a pretty nice view of the city. 

They also don't really have ""room service"". They have a limited ""in-room dining"" menu and bring food up to you in paper bags/boxes like take-out. However, I'll give them an extra star for having watermelon juice on the menu :)

Service was super duper friendly, and for the price ($57/night) I can't complain. They offer free coffee/tea in the morning at the Art Bar.  Valet parking is complimentary for guests, and they have a nice text-messaging service for getting your car ready. Decor is hipster/modern with weird Asian influences.

That being said, the customer service at this hotel is appalling. It is very clear that no one working there wants to put any effort into meeting your needs. I called ahead of time and asked to get adjacent rooms, but the person on the phone basically said that someone else in the hotel assigned rooms and they were unable to until we checked in. Our flights got delayed the first night and when we arrived we were informed that there were no more queens available (even though I booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds, with 4 guests per room, and had called earlier that day). We were forced to take king beds, and the person checking us in told us to come by in the morning and we would be moved to queens and comped for the disservice. My sister called in the morning and was told by someone that there were no more queens available and there was nothing they could do for her (even though the guy promised us the night  before...). Meanwhile I went downstairs and was lucky enough to get someone who changed our rooms to queens. Of course there was no comp (even though this was promised to us before) and barely an apology for the s*** night of sleep we all got on the floor/sharing a bed a with 3 people.

The rest of the weekend was filled with similar experiences of customer service. it was common to walk by the front desk and see a line of 10-15 people. Personally every time I stood in a line of THREE people it took them at least 20 minutes to help us, so I really felt sorry for those people. (it was rare for them to have more than 2-3 people working the front desk... laughable). Their computer system also appears to be one giant joke and was the main reason everything took so long. We requested a towel for our room and it took them over an hour to get it to us.

5979709,2016-12-29,0,aKcqKNcbwNydCBnvAA4TeQ,"I like to get what I pay for. I honestly feel like I didn't here.

First the hotel itself. On Priceline they claim it's a 3.5 star hotel. I'm calling it 2 1/2 to 3 stars. There should be the basics: cleanliness, amenities, and supplies. 

They're clean. I'll give them that. Amenities, as basic as it gets. There's a shower half enclosed with glass. I would have preferred a full plastic curtain to the water splashing all over the floor. As for the supplies, it was a nice touch with a couple sets of ear plugs I'm assuming are for snorers? I guess they replaced pens and pads with those plugs. Interesting trade off. And their cable is the most basic of cables. 

But the real issue here is the customer service. I don't know if they were slammed due to the holidays, but I didn't see any smiling welcoming faces. I arrived a little sick and tired but in time for 3pm checkin on Xmas day. I was met with a curt woman. Not what you want to experience after a 4 hour drive. I asked politely for a room with a view. I was curtly told that the rooms weren't ready and that I'd have to wait 15-30 min as they were still being ""inspected"". I was ok with it, left my number and waited in the lounge...for an hour, after which point I went to the register desk. Finally got another unsmiling face's attention, the assistant manager, and I explained I'd been waiting an hour and haven't received any calls. At the same time I noticed they were checking in people in the line. Wtf? So I still politely asked, ""Are you checking people in""? Curt response, ""I'm already gonna take care of you just relax!"" Meanwhile I'm still relaxed. Just answer my question instead of being rude. He said yes but he had called me twice and I didn't answer. I called that bs by showing my call log. 
Response: ""It wouldn't show there if it goes straight to your vmail."" 
Really? Ok so where's the voicemail?
Response: ""Just relax I'm gonna waive your resort fees. That's $44!""

I hate being lied to my face. I hate rudeness, especially when I'm still polite. I hate an unwelcoming staff. They gave me 1 star attitude. 

But for convenience sake I added a couple nights stay. And when I went down to question why there were resort fees, they said that adding nights made it a new transaction. I asked for the guy that waived them in the first place and they said he went on vacation. There's convenience! Anyway I spoke to a curt supervisor and she did nothing for me. I had already added the nights so that's a loss. I wanted to stay one more night but not with this rude staff. I booked a room on the strip for my last night in Vegas. Kicking it old school wasn't what I expected. Were they this rude back in the day here in downtown?",FswlGaOWbocMCYwmA2jEJw,2,0,2,XvZOYXREOlWRFoivwaZfug

About a week before the event I decided I wanted to surprise my wife with some specialty b-day cupcakes for her and the gang. Since I couldn't bring the cupcakes to the event itself without spoiling the surprise for my wife, I decided to see if I could drop them off earlier in the day and then bring the cupcakes out later that night so the surprise would be complete. To do this I needed help, so I called the DGH & C and asked for a manager to help with this small, but important task. I was immediately conneted to F & B Manager Reba, who without hesitation agreed to help. So the plan was set, I would drop them off Saturday morning, leave the cupcakes with the hotel staff, and reveal them to my wife before the crawl that night. As the big day approached, Reba even went so far as to call me back on her day off to help me coordinate the cupcake drop off with another manager who was going to be covering that morning shift since she was on the evening shift. Then on the big night, Reba organized the cupcakes on a nice tray and even allowed one of her waitresses to help light some candles and carry the tray to the bar in order help pull off the surprise. In the end, my wife was super surpised, loved the cupcakes, and most importantly, was very happy,  It was a pretty small event in the grand scheme of Las Vegas happenings, but Reba and her team went above and beyond to make it happen.

I come with friends to Las Vegas on an annual basis. Usually we stay on the Strip but this time, the Canadian dollar is not doing well, we thought this would be an opportunity to stay in the Downtown area and make our dollars stretch.  I chose the Downtown Grand because it has a pool, not noisy, close to Fremont Street. I purchased our stay directly with the hotel figuring if there were any issues, there's a better chance of it being rectified because it wasn't purchased through a third party.
Monday - We took the WAX bus from the Airport to the hotel for only $2.  It wasn't difficult at all.  Checking in was a smooth process, kudos to Danica, she was very helpful and informative. We would have 2 free bottles of water daily with our stay, several coupons to use at the facilities attached to the hotel (restaurants, casino). We stayed in the tower across the street which isn't that much of a walk when you compare it to the massive hotels on the Strip so that's a plus! After unpacking I called down and spoke with Danica who recommended the S&O restaurant in their hotel for the prime rib dinner for $9.99! I discovered we had a free appie coupon when we buy 2 entrees and they accepted it!  After dinner we returned to our room and discovered our tv didn't work yet it did prior to dinner. I called and one of their ""Engineers"" Sylvester, was sent to fix it.  He was pleasant and it appeared to be the HDMI cable then we checked out Fremont Street which is less than a block away.
Tuesday - we started every morning with breakfast at the Commissary which was located on the Ground floor of our tower. After breakfast, my friend would go to the pool to suntan and I'd go to the gym, work out then go join her at the pool. Their Gym is small, definitely there's room to expand it as the area around the gum is empty. The gym consists of a tv stuck on sports (no remote control to change channels), water cooler, recumbent bike, 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals and a universal gym that was broken.  There were no disinfectant wipes which is normal to have in a gym. The room is quite cramped, hard to maneuver through the machines when there are others in the gym and no area for stretching or floor work which was a downer. 
Wednesday this is when things really go downhill....9pm our tv isn't working, Engineers Sylvester & Raoul came. Kudos to them, they gave recommendations on where local go out to eat but determined our tv wouldn't be able to be fixed during our trip, and out of no where a man came to our door with room keys for a new room!  We didn't want waste time, pack up all our stuff, schlep it around, unpack and set up our room again. I went to the front desk, spoke with Adam who was in charge during this shift, explained the entire situation, we didn't want to move, tv hadn't worked Monday and Wednesday and won't for the rest of our trip, spent 2 hours waiting for the tv to be fixed, our keys had been de-activated, didn't want to waste anymore time on this issue, we could live without the tv and what other solutions would he offer? He says since he had done his piece by offering a new room there was no more resolutions he was willing to offer.  I was nice, polite and professional. He wasn't willing to change except remove 2 day of resort fees of $19.99/day but the TV only worked 1 day! At this point it's 11:30pm, we hadn't had dinner so I left. Thursday and Friday I attempted to follow up with Manager Christina, went and called to the front desk. I was sent away many times told she'd be back in 10 minutes, then 15 minutes, then told she was in a meeting then that she'd be in back-to-back meetings all day and would call me.  I never received a call, no voicemail messages on our hotel phone nor a note when I checked out.  I was unhappy there was no follow up with management.  
I was hoping Downtown Grand would be our new go-to place when we do our yearly trips to Vegas but was unfortunately disappointed even when I gave the staff several opportunities to redeem themselves and their hotel.",xnof7J_8etQ9b4n3rX9zsw,1,1,2,XbhTUmIrXFP3Jb1vD25G9Q

It was wired like a 1920's feel with a modern twist. I really want the designers name :) We went to a few other places on Fremont and the strip and the staff was rude did not care about helping and just walk by. If any managers or staff read these all I can say is that the Grand had the best staff and it's much appreciated and will keep me coming back to stay!!,PrLhQXis6Esw5z8E_68SxQ,0,0,5,HMWRQZ2-PCAGcyQuzzmgOA
