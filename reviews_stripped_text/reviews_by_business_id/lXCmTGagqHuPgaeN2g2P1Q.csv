355963,2012-06-30,0,lXCmTGagqHuPgaeN2g2P1Q,I love marco's pizza. They are the best. Since I started ordering from here I will not order from anywhere else. My pizza is always fresh and hot and the service is always top notch. The delivery driver is always fast and friendly. The online ordering is super easy to use and I can add the delivery drivers tip right to my bill.,X0tqkyQSkGS8a2CcN56Vow,0,0,5,BBJnFeHE1y7WOoECFSKgWA
446315,2014-06-25,0,lXCmTGagqHuPgaeN2g2P1Q,"This review is based on my first visit.

The pizza was hot and full of flavor. The pepperoni has that genuine sausage-y flavor that you get at real pizza shops. We also ordered a chicken, spinach, white pizza that was delicious. It's not too pricey if you order with a coupon. 

I love the online ordering option, You can build a custom pizza online or alter their signature or special pizzas.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,2,0,4,jbFX_qqSg8SxZ7FdfSscLw

556791,2015-11-05,0,lXCmTGagqHuPgaeN2g2P1Q,"First few orders were fine, MY LAST order it was missing TWO crust toppers that we specifically ordered because we get no sauce on our pizza. The cheese also was spread unevenly on the pizza like they didn't care. So i call in explaining my missing items & i'm now home with a cold pizza that we cant eat or enjoy so i would like it remade. They insist on asking me several questions over the phone, insulting me telling me they used correct amount of cheese... the main issue was its missing my crust toppers. MOST places will just remake it. There is a girl here with RED / PINK hair name she said started with an A. At first she wouldn't give me her name, are they required to wear name tags here?? No employee's had names. Anyways, she was very rude argued with me when i got there, still insisting she was in the right.. I told her i'm the customer, i order food, you make it plan an simple, how can she get it right times before but yet this time the system didn't tell her?. SHE pursed to get into a arguing matching with me over it, in front of customers & employee's telling me its there system n she knows how to make a pizza. I asked to pull up my receipt on machine she refused..saying she knows its wrong. She handled the whole simple remake me a pizza thing VERY VERY unprofessional & needs to be RETRAINED on customer service skills. She needs to realize without the customer she has no JOB. YOU have now lost my business & i was a weekly customer... i will tell everyone i know to boycott this location...",kX11PK-Q0xJQM9MITeDTyg,0,0,1,HLRhk6PM32RknCXmKjW3QA

781346,2017-02-09,0,lXCmTGagqHuPgaeN2g2P1Q,"8:10pm phone order:

Used MAILED COUPON $13.99 two-top pizza XL, specifically asked for hot sauce & ranch FOR THE PIZZA!

Used MAILED coupon for FREE cheesy bread that can be used with other coupons, asked if red sauce & ranch came with it, they said""YES"".

Made sure we had all 4 sauces! Was told our delivery will take 45 mins. 

9:08pm: delivery showed up.

Charged $17.99 pizza & NO HOT SAUCE. Asked delivery guy how much total was, he said ""Well I guess it's $4 off from the total right?."" I meant HOW MUCH WAS THE TOTAL SO I CAN MINUS THE $4 OFF MYSELF.

We asked for hot sauce, he said ""U ordered hot sauce?"" We said we asked specifically separate sauces for the pizza & asked if the cheesy bread came with red sauce & ranch & you said yes. He said Sorry & he will come back to drop some off.


THIS IS AT LEAST THE 4TH TIME WE HAD OUR ORDER INCORRECTLY DELIVERED!


9:46pm: I called the cell number of the driver & he said ""Yes, I'm still delivering the hot sauce, I'm just waiting for another delivery"" I said might as well have not ordered if I have to wait 2 hrs for my order to be delivered correctly! He said ""It's not 2 hrs It's only 1 hr & 15 mins,but ok."" WOW! What a response! So helpful of him! AND HE HUNG UP ON ME!!!!


Over the phone he referred to the supervisor as a ""she"". Must be only 2 ppl working because they sounded busy. The man who took our order was the same man who delivered because his voice matched. Also told us that he was the one we spoke to during the delivery. The supervisor woman gave the phone to the man, and he kept saying she was too busy to talk to us. She was JUST on the phone with me, and must've been telling the man to tell me to call back because I could hear him speaking to her. She did NOT want to speak to me. They told me to call back tomorrow after 4:30pm to speak with Jay (woman General Manager). Very upset because more than half of my total orders from this place has been WRONG!!!! I feel bad reporting this situation b/c I am NOT trying to get anyone in trouble, I am simply trying to get my orders right! And on time!!!!! This is very frustrating! It is obvious these employees are being spread too thinly and seem too stressed. They tried to be polite but not enough. was very frustrating because they could not give me any solutions just condescending answers!!!! We placed our order at 8:10pm, 9:45pm - I'm still waiting of the hot sauce I was promised.

THE ONLY REASON I ORDERED AGAIN FROM THIS PLACE IS CUZ THEY MAILED US THESE COUPONS! WELL, IT WORKED FOR THEM! BUT NOT FOR US!

NOT ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN!!!",HIMNPUUiYW2fv-e-c5W4jQ,1,0,2,cjuVVxGR8v1Mrd1atFJIDQ
