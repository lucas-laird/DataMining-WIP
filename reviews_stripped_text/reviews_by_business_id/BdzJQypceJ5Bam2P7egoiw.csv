10488,2018-01-03,2,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"Completely turned off about this place after today. Last couple visits were a little shaky, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back.

Today i show up at 130pm om a Wednesday order 2 mr poke sushi burritos. They get the tortilla and rice and soft sheel crab on the counter and put together, then decide to tell me they are out of crab salad (main filler in this order) 

Normally i would just pick something else but thats a main ingredient in 90% of their menu items as i comb over the board. 

So at that point my burrito was half made and felt obligated to purchase that one. Told them to forget the second one all together. Paid for something i didnt even really want and left.

Honestly there are just too many poke places in vegas to settle for this. How are you out of main ingredient for majority of your featured items at 130pm on wed??? Ita crab salad. Pretty sure smiths, vons, albertons all carry it so at that point its laziness to not run and grab some in the meantime until your order arrives.  And at that point ill take my business some where else. 

Not to mention when the skimp on cream cheese, especially after it when from slices to just little clumps of it that take 10 mins to put on and still dont get enough. 

Just cost themselves a consistent poke consumer. Too bad... it was on my way home from work and everything started out great and has just gone downhill.

So in the middle of making our orders they say "" were out of avocado but we have hard avocados "", them we immediately were not happy due to lack of knowledge upfront.

995944,2017-03-05,0,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"So this is the first time I've ever had a sushi burrito. I hear so many good things about it, I knew it was time to try. This place is not far from me and I randomly noticed it while driving up rainbow. We did however order delivery lol. We ordered the jalapeño bombs and the crabby rangoons. The jalapeño bombs really were bomb! So tasty, 4 pieces. The rangoons were okay. I think they were only stuffed with the crab mix. Not bad flavor though, 3 pieces. I built my own burrito with salmon, crab mix, shrimp tempura, masago, avocado and cream cheese. My boyfriends ordered the 702. I liked my burrito, it was pretty good, I think I probably should've put something else together though lol but like I said, it was my first time. My boyfriend loved his! The soft shell crab in it was surprisingly awesome! I kind of expected it to not be good quality lol. But actually all the fish was very fresh and delicious!! Our order came to be about $44 including delivery fee and tip. Not too bad but we are always iffy about spending so much when we could just go to ayce sushi. But we are happy we tried it, it was actually very filling. I couldn't finish all of mine, maybe I shouldn't have gotten the appetizers, but man were they good!!",DxH-xZ-OwYG7nLOQIbTdXQ,1,1,4,7ZvNk5czZKq7Qro--zDHvQ

1208944,2017-03-09,2,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"Believe me when I say that I so wanted to love this place. :( Down the street from where I work, I hate the drive to Soho down Sahara -- so I was thrilled to see this place open literally 0.2 miles away! But sad to say, with the recent supersaturated trend of sushi burrito/bowls within the past year in this town, this place lacks... something. 

The venue is easily accessible on Rainbow, has a lot of seating and has extremely nice employees! And while I do believe that is a very important part of opening a restaurant (and that's where my two stars come from), the food plays a big factor too obviously. I have ordered from here twice (once a poke bowl, another time a sushi burrito)... and it just didn't do it for me.

COMPLAINTS:
- Their portions need to be a little bigger (I felt like my burrito did not hold shape and was a little floppy, making it very difficult and not to mention messy to eat).
- Their tempura is not made fresh (shrimp tempura and soft shell crab tempura did not have that crunch I expected, instead was soggy).
- Their sauces need a little more oomph (They say the sauce is boss... this is an important part of the meal as it adds flavor to the whole thing, and it just didn't have that kick.)

I believe this place maybe opened when they just weren't ready. But it's all a learning experience though, right? The sushi burrito/bowl craze is hot right now and they just need to get it together a little. I will definitely give this place another try, especially due to the fact is so close to my work and convenient... but honestly, it is not something I would go out of my way for at this current time. #StrikeTwo :P",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,7,0,2,KZbM7ZMszYbnd0eeEmdy9A

The rice was cold, so I'm guessing its the same rice used in their bowls and burritos. Would be much better if the bento came with hot rice. My reason for the loss of star. 

I would suggest they offer a curry option (especially during the upcoming winter months) because its so easy to prepare and add to any katsu dish. I did notice the boxes the Bento come in are very flimsy so a hot curry dish may not hold up well in them.

1865190,2016-11-20,13,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"Mr Poke is yet another poke bowl and sushi burrito spot popping up in Vegas. Unfortunately, in an oversaturated market, they're not currently up to par. I realize they're in soft opening and intend this entirely as constructive criticism for management- because your employees can take their time training but it doesn't matter if the food has no flavor.

I ordered two of their signature dishes, the 702 (as a sushi-rrito) and the Sin City (as a bowl). My total was nearly $30 to feed two, which is higher than most other places in town, and the portions were small- the bowl was 3/4 full of rice with maybe a half cup of actual fish, and the burrito just looked skimpy. Both items included a sauce (creamy cilantro and screaming sauce) but I couldn't taste either- it was just chopped fish. I even had to use a soy sauce packet on the burrito because it was so dry!

The location is cute and service was polite, and it was nice that they included a drink and miso soup for their grand opening special, but someone needs to rework the menu and prices, and pump up the sauces, ASAP.

2012764,2017-02-13,1,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"Poke bowls have become my go to for a light and tasty lunch. I have a couple of favorite stops, but the one closest to my work has a line out the door so I decided to try Mr. Poke today...it seemed to be a little busy (usually a good sign).

First, the young girl dishing out the protein scooped way too much rice in my bowl. Perhaps a good sign when it came to the protein? No. I decided to create my own bowl and asked for ahi tuna and salmon. The young girl scooped out a small portion of the ahi. Then, she scooped a smaller portion of the salmon. I should have said something or canceled my order at that point. I'm not kidding you...it was less than half of what you get at the majority of the other Poke restaurants. 

Second, you get to choose the mix-ins. There was a good selection, but you pay extra for cream cheese, avocado, mango, and seaweed salad. (I passed on those.) 

Third, the checkout was pretty easy.. my complaint? The cashier offered a punch card to the person in front of me but didn't offer me one. Maybe the look on my face while staring at the lack of protein told her I would not be back??

Taste...it was okay. If you read the other honest reviews, they comment that the tuna is warm. It's definitely room temperature. 

For the price, this does not compare to my other favorite stops. I will drive the extra two miles and stand in line. Better yet, I will start using the app at one of them so I can skip the line. 

Mr. Poke, there is a reason the competition has a line out the door. Hope the protein portions and other things improve. If they do, I may be back.",S07xLw7oD9gJkAQ3HzFNeQ,1,0,2,S3LrtCjY4WKVoojlwZGvSQ

2084397,2017-01-11,8,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I was super happy to see a sushi burrito spot pop up my 'hood. I appreciate that they have a drive thru because I have a baby and it's a PITA getting him in and out of the car. I noticed that the drive thru doesn't have a specials board as they do inside. This is really a bad move on their part because the outside menu only shows poke and a couple sides. How will anyone know they are offering other items such as chicken katsu and desserts? I wouldn't have known myself if I hadn't checked out the other reviews beforehand. 

I ordered the O.C sushi burrito on a seaweed wrap, and the Mr. Poke in a bowl with white rice. I also got extra sauces on the side- the spicy ponzu and screaming sauce. It was just under $20 for two meals which seems pretty spot on with competitors. I tried the burrito first. It was pretty tasteless. The sauce was very minimal so I'm glad I asked for extra on the side. One of the ingredients in this burrito is seaweed salad and I think it overpowered the other flavors. I would order sans seaweed salad next time. 

The Mr. Poke bowl had an okay amount of fish but I would have preferred more. The bowl was mostly full of rice and toppings. I was disappointed because it was so DRY. I am so glad I got the extra sauce on the side because otherwise it would have been quite disappointing to eat. I'll admit I like my sauces. So I start poking around the bowl and take a bite of the tuna and it's warm!! I almost threw the bowl away but then I got to thinking whyy is it warm? I noticed the tuna was right next to the soft shell crab which I assume is heated up so that must have made the tuna warm. Let me tell you warm raw fish is gross and I don't recommend it. I was also disappointed that the lady asked me if I wanted soy sauce or ginger and I said yes to both and none was found in my bag. I was looking forward to not having to trek all the way to Chinatown for poke bowls and sushi burritos, but this probably won't be a spot I frequent often",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,5,2,74kEWENXsRXuzDeInxu5fA

2651242,2016-12-11,3,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I really wanted to try this place and I really wanted to love it but sadly that didn't happen. We came in on a Monday around 5pm- as soon as we walk in I see all the workers and smile and not one greeting. It was obviously my first time in and the workers just stared at me while I looked over the menu- I had to ask what they recommended and had to ask probably two or three times because they couldn't understand me. The guy working answered with the 702 and the Ginza (sp?) as a bowl or burrito. 
I ended up going with the 702 without scallions and my boyfriend went with the chicken katsu special that came with miso soup. As we are paying the girl working is holding a tray and I didn't think it was my food and she just tries to hand it to me without saying a word I grab it and then another worker apologized and says they missed something and they put something fried ontop - I still have no idea what it is. I didn't think anything of it MINUS the fact that that girl trying to give me my food seemed lost. We also grabbed from chai tea lattes from the fridge (would not recommend if you enjoy a strong chai), we sat down and it was fine at first - but the first bite of tuna was not pleasant to my taste buds. I am a textured eater so I just figured it was me but when my boyfriend tried it he didn't like it either. I am not a big raw fish eater so i choose to ignore this in this review but man oh man the rice -terrible. Maybe it was the cilantro sauce that was it drowned in or something else but I had to force myself to finish my meal. The only super yummy was was the cucumber and avocado (which is impossible to mess up) so after eating what little I could stomach I got up to see if I had to clean my own table or someone else did and noticed the trash area had a tray drop off so we went to throw away our stuff and leave. Not once did anybody check up on us- and nobody said good bye or thank you when we left. I understand they were all kids (or atleast it seemed like it) but the place was spotless and they had probably 4 people on the clock the least one of them can do is stay busy and see how the food is. I didn't see one person leave from behind the counter besides to bring out food. 
Overall- I really do wish I loved this place. I had to ask my boyfriend to try it out about 5 times because he didn't want to like it since it's in a spot he called haunted with bad business. But oh well. I would've given two stars but they got the three for being clean. But like I said they just need to talk to the customers and not just stand behind a counter doing nothing. Customer service is everything and the way a customer perceives your staff is also a big factor in whether or not the experience is worth trying out more than once.",s1ZTkHxh0I0hFA9dI2pQMQ,7,3,3,un5GEH5Y56nVjfOjIkOO3w

I ordered the 702 & it was very filling. The rice to protein ratio was spot on. Not too much rice & just enough for all the meat. The fish was super fresh & the tempura style crab was sssssooooooo good.

I choose the 3 proteins and added extra stuff.  I wanted to try different sauces so I got all that on the side and they did a good job with all the packaging.  However the extra I paid for avocado was a huge joke.  It was 2 tiny pieces that was like a finger thick.  I was stretching that amount and just took tiny bites of that with my fish.  

I almost called in to complain because I thought they forgot my tuna but I realized that it was just a tiny amount and it got mixed in with my salmon.  There was plenty of spicy tuna which wasn't seasoned to my liking.  

So all in all, it was a fresh fish bowl, quality was decent but seriously, i think they could have put in a little more fish.  Plus that they let you add lots of extras for free like corn, edamame, garlic chips...

Drive-thru menu selections aren't too exciting.  Ginza bowl happened to have the fish that I like.  Portions not as much as other poke places in town.  I'm actually not sure if they serve salad poke bowls, since they didn't ask.  They only asked what kind of rice I wanted.  Brown?  Dry boring supposedly healthier brown please.

It tasted alright.  Not the greatest.  Sad I didn't see if this place offers to pick our own sauces.  Maybe inside the restaurant they do???

Friendly customer service but it took a while.  Lady gave me a miso soup for waiting, to make up for it.  She was apologetic.  Okay well keeping the third star and it's for the lady.

Thing is I'm not so impressed.  What would make me wanna return?  Even to check out if its different inside the restaurant with more choices, like as far as choosing salad and our own sauces.  I'd rather make the extra drive toward southwest where I know I'll get a better poke bowl.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,42,35,3,BG92ZGecryb9XcE_fT3hLQ

It's nice and clean, I'd come back to dine in and try some of the appetizers on the menu. My only nit-pick: the menu is a little confusing, even though I frequent these types of restaurants. They have their available items in three different places, it's not too cohesive. But everyone at the counter was friendly and engaging, they asked if I had questions while looking. 

For my quick bite I customized my sushi bowl. The portions are generous and it was almost $12, I was satisfied with the quality of the ingredients and the fish was fresh.

HOWEVER, the only reason I'm not going to give this place 5 stars is due to the fact that I found not only 1 but 2 hairs in my bowl which I know aren't mine but I found them shortly after opening them :/ The first one was very short and I disregarded it thinking it was lint or something. The second one was longer and most definitely a hair (which is on the picture). I'm really disappointed that I got that upon my first impression of the restaurant.

It was very slow when we walked in with one couple eating in the dining room. It's meant to be casual counter service. The cashier described it as ""like subway but for a bowl or burrito"". The soda machine was out of order but we never drink soda so it didn't matter (to us). My wife ordered the chicken katsu 6.50 and I had the Ginza burrito 10.45. The cashier was very nice and helpful. My burrito was not wrapped so well and fell apart as soon as I took it out of the parchment. Overall, the meal was better than expected. The prices are certainly low. Im sure they expected busier business when they opened. I hope they do well. Very humble little shop. The music playing was absolutely terrible gangster music.

I had the sin city poke bowl which came with a nice blend of ingredients, but it just felt like something was missing. Maybe it needed more sauce or different ingredients, I don't know.

Walking in, the menu looks a bit disorganized and confusing. But the nice staff behind the counter help you through the process. I got my usual two proteins, salmon and yellow tail with sushi rice. The sauce selection is large, but they did not have great recommendations for combinations. They also do not mix the sauce with the fish as other places do, sauce is just poured on top. A wide choice of toppings, with different choices such as hot cheetos. Although a lot of the ones that are usually ""free"" had a small charge so I went lighter than usual. 

After the ordering process, we sat to eat. Aesthetically, the bowl looked good and well put together. Unfortunately, taste told a different story. As mentioned before, the fish portions are small and not very fresh. The sauce was not well incorporated, and the toppings weren't fresh either. The cucumbers I added in particular had an icy bite, it was semi-frozen still!

This place is so cute and super clean. You can tell it use to be a fast food chain like Taco Bell or something by how it's set up. It has a drive thru and they actually use it! 

When I walked in I was immediately welcomed and I told them I've never been here is this like soho? They said it's similar and asked if I had any questions. I didn't i usually get the same thing in either a bowl or burrito. Today I wanted more protein than usual so I opted for bowl. 

It was amazing. The fish was fresh along with the rest of their ingredients. I always fear trying new places especially with ahi poke but I can tell right away with my first bite I had nothing to worry about.

5280438,2018-04-11,2,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I'm disappointed this place didn't really live up to the reviews. All the reviews and pictures looked like it would have been an awesome Poké spot to go to. It's so hard to find a good one in the Summerlin Area. There's barely even any.

When we walked in we just stared at the menu for a bit. The workers just looked at us awkwardly like you can sense them saying ""hurry up and order already"" in their heads. I had to finally say ""I'm sorry, it's our first time here."" Then finally someone spoke up and asked if we needed help and do you know how the place works? I stated yes.

Right when we got in though this lady from the back which may have been the owner came out. I think she was overseeing her workers. The energy in the place seemed very hostile. I wasn't getting a good vibe in there, neither did my boyfriend. That took away from the experience. 

I got a Poké bowl with greens. It's sucks they don't let you do tofu as your rice or greens. Sweet Poké let's you do that. So fine I did greens. I asked for salmon and shrimp tempura. OMG this place is stingy with their proteins. I got barely any salmon and 2 pieces of shrimp tempura!!! That was another strike to me. Maybe the kids working were being stingy because they were being watched. I got the spicy ponzu and some wasabi type sauce together. It's sad because it was actually really good the sauces. Only thing is they're lazy and they don't mix your protein in the sauces. They just put it on your bowl. Most places will toss your proteins together in the sauce to make it delicious. That was another strike for me. Then when I was almost done adding my toppings, I asked for tofu, and they like that's going to be a 50 cent charge. The lady at the register basically yelled it. She was like ""DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT? TAKE IT AND GO, ILL DO 50 CENT CHARGE FO YOU."" After that I ended up getting a little snippy and responded saying ""whatever just do it."" 

Anyways whatever, I guess that's how their business works but I'm just used to having good customer service, hefty amount of protein, and not being up charged for tofu. Not to mention paying extra from some stingy people. If you're actually giving me what it seems like a good amount for my add on I wouldn't mind. 

Maybe they were just all having a bad day. Who knows. I definitely probably won't be coming back here. If you want a good Poké bowl spot. Definitely try Sweet Poké, it's a thousand times better!!!",lMTCG3qG5prxSzLTArZV3g,2,0,2,NaiM1xr3TpPRwmbAE9eL4Q

They have really good customer service which is why i gave them 3 stars but when it comes to the fish..meh. Every time I've given it a try the fish is always bland and doesn't taste fresh. Especially compared to other poké that i've tried. I get no sauce because I want to savor the flavor of the fish so maybe that's why i notice this so much. Most of the toppings don't taste fresh either. I think I would go here if I was really craving poké and do not feel like driving far. Also, as a plus they do 15% off with your student ID. For some reason on one of my visits they only gave me 10%. Their stamp card is also a good deal. Free mochi with 5 stamps and a free bowl with 10.",gXC3a-Z_hyi4FxXjuPRaaQ,1,1,3,o0pueOqnABtpHKjDlK6KWg
5555780,2017-05-01,2,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I came by this place because it's close to my school and needed a quick lunch. Huge disappointment. I ordered a poke salad with tuna & salmon and asked to to just use poke sauce as dressing. First thoughts , portions could be bigger. For 12 bucks hardly any poke or avocado.. and the bowl size itself is maybe equivalent to the size of a side salad at a restaurant. The dressing soaked the bottom 1/3 of the bowl and no dressing on top. I ate the first few bites and thought meh.. pretty bland. And as I got towards the bottom I couldn't take more than 3 bites . Not sure if they loaded with extra wasabi or what kind of peppers they use with the dressing but it is UNBEARABLE. Each bite burns horribly and can't stop tearing. I can literally feel the burn through my nose and to the back of my head! 

Also had a Thai coffee which was tasty for the first couple sips.. but as the flavor set in it is just way too sweet. Taste like condensed milk and sugar with a splash of coffee

i would recommend adding garlic chips but don't overdo it! the man gave me lots and i spent a few minutes picking it all out because it was too over powering.

We go often, and we are always greeted with smiles and a happy and helpful staff. 
They keep up with points by phone number so you get extras for free after a couple visits, even though the owners are likely to let you try something anyway.

The first time, none of the staff wanted to be very helpful or cooperative. They acted as if it was an annoyance for us to be there and were immediately very condescending when they started taking our orders. I went again today and stood at the front of the line for 15 minutes while the staff (only one same person as last time in this group) stood around and argued with eachother. It took an extremely long time to get my lunch, and I would say they were understaffed but there was a group of eight people standing around doing nothing but arguing for a long time while the line of customers got more and more frustrated. 
All of that being said, I'm always very pleased with the food here and I love the convenient location. Would definitely come in to eat more if the staff's organization was better and their time was spent more wisely.",eV6wMkE_VIJDUrRTHOnTVQ,1,0,3,HXeA_I1Z0Daa_0jM_Y9ARg
5908566,2017-06-12,1,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I'm a big fan of poke bowls but this was pretty bad. First When I walked through the door I smelled a strange odor immediately. I didn't turn around immediately because it wasn't a fishy rotten smell, so maybe I could still give them a try. Then I noticed it was quite warm in the restaurant, as if the A/C was out or on low. Difficult to keep raw seafood fresh at these warm temps. Then the decor and color is so plain and unwelcoming. Not particularly clean and bright. Nothing you'd expect from a relatively new fresh poke Joint. So within the first 30 secs i was quite turned off. 

But I forged ahead and got their recommended Sin City bowl, their most expensive signature bowl. Has all the fish I usually like. It took less than a minute to prepare. Visually, it was quite plain, no pop of colors, unlike other poke places I frequent. Then the taste - very very subpar, to be nice. The ""Screaming"" sauce was so bland. No taste at all (or appetizing taste). The only thing it was screaming to me is ""No! Don't ever get this again"". The fish was room temp warm.  Then the mango - there is no way this can be fresh. It added an awkward sweet, but rancid taste to my bowl.  

I'm thinking the whole time I'm eating ""boy I hope I don't get sick"". This is the only place I can remember that I am thinking more about not getting sick than about the food. Oh, and the total bill for the frightening experience is $14 (no drinks).",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,1,KkdqjBmy7e1IgEiPdz7erQ
5918795,2017-02-14,7,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"First of all, the ingredients in my order was extremely fresh. From the cubes of fish to the cilantro. Typically fragile herbs like cilantro are dried out or wilted by the time they find their way into your food at these pre-preped fast casual dining establishments.

So bravo to F-R-E-S-H-N-E-S-S!

With that said let's dive right in to my review. 

I actually was not aware of this Poké bowl/burrito spot actually being opened. I have driven past this stretch of Rainbow Blvd a lot less frequently since I moved over a year ago, but the trusty GPS advised me to take the 95 on my way to obtaining a new ""Health Card"" and I saw it as I drove by. I was really hungry and thus made a mental note to return once my business with the SNHD is completed.

So I head back and decided to give it a shot, in spite of the trend of lukewarm reviews. Believe me, I sat in a warm car in the parking lot skimming through the posted reviews before mentally brushing past all the reviews advising me to try a different place or the other voice telling me to just be a good boy and have some English Cucumbers and oranges for a light and healthy dinner.  But you can easily guess how that debate ended.

The restaurant is clean, with a decent size dining area, and 5 or 6 eager staff behind the counter waiting for me to place the order. One was ever so courteous in offering to answer any questions I might have and assist me in the ordering process.  Ultimately I decided on their Sin City signature sushi burrito (Tuna, Salmon, Crab Salad, Yellowtail, Avocado, Cucumber, Cilantro, Mango, Screaming Sauce). It also listed Red Onions, but I don't recalling seeing it or tasting it, but not a big deal for me.  The portion is large for the about of the above mentioned ingredients that could physically be convinced to stay under a traditional sheet of pre-cut seaweed. Once rolled up like a typical signature sushi roll at your local Japanese restaurant it is wrapped in paper and cut at a diagonal, to optimize the exposed surface area of sushi burrito.

The roll tasted pretty good, but could benefit from slightly more Screaming Sauce or have a little more served on the side in a 1-2 oz portion cup.  The avocado inside was scooped out of the shell and cut into pieces at the time of preparation, so none of that off-putting oxidized look of the sad old avocado. As mention before, even the cilantro looked like it was freshly washed and picked from the stem as a last minute garnish.  

The only thing bad was a hair I found as I filet my Sin City Sushi Burrito where they had bisected it before wrapping it up and sealed it with a thank you sticker.  But as far as possible physical contaminations goes, hair is gross but not as dangerous as other foreign objects like shards of glass or metal shavings. Plus it was not curly, which is ranked higher on the gag reflex scale.

Anyway, besides the unintentional surprise, the rest of the sushi burrito is good and fresh. But with stiff competition from all the Poké bowl, sushi places that have opened up in 2016, Mr Poké should definitely considered putting more sauces in their rolls or offering extra on the side, if that is the consensus opinion of their customers.

Oh yeah, if you plan to stop here on a regular basis, take advantage of their stamp card. And if you hate getting out of the car or the weather is being a hater, they have a drive thru window for your convenience.

5970623,2018-05-30,3,BdzJQypceJ5Bam2P7egoiw,"I stopped here for take out dinner towards the end of the day, just an hour before closing and there were still people eating inside, as well as ordering take out. 

I was quickly attended, the staff made a great duo, production was smooth, quick and kind. Seriously so polite, genuinely welcoming and friendly, all around good vibes which stood out to me most, their customer service. There was the guy who greeted me as I entered while tending a previous takeout guest order, then made my sushi burrito and patiently answered my questions about the appetizers and drink options. As well as a younger cute green haired cashier named Isabel, who was super sweet, as she helped gather my items and assured to thoroughly ask and confirm if I had everything I ordered right. While also tending to the guests that were seated too. I was never left waiting too long, which I appreciate.

I had Thai tea (no boba included, not offered here), which was a bit more milky, not really as sweet this time. I also tried the jalapeño poppers for the first time, they were unfortunately not like the picture, it looked like 1/4th slice of one jalapeño, instead of the 1/2 slice it seems everywhere else, it was much thinner / smaller than I thought mostly tempura batter, much thicker slice than the photos on here appear, with bits of tuna it wasn't very spicy either to be honest I'm not sure if it was because of the sweeter sauces, or just not as spicy of a jalapeño, or possibly because it was less jalapeño than I thought, but it was good aside that they were much smaller than I they appeared - Might consider ordering again in the future for comparison. Also had the miso soup, which was okay also not the most flavorful this time a bit too watered down for my taste but at least it wasn't overly salty I guess, though I might've preferred that. I also had some seaweed salad, the portion was very generous actually, compared to other poke places, I had some leftover I was too full to finish, but it was good. And lastly the ginza roll which was spicy and yummy - my usual sushi burrito go to from here, as I've had it two other times and it was always good, also filling as I only ended up eating half with the appetizers, otherwise it should be good and filling enough on its own, but I wanted to try a little of everything. I would like to eventually try the hot Cheetos dust crumbs on the rice of the sushi burrito rolls. 

Also thought it'd be worth sharing that they also offer yelp review deals! This time it was a free cheesecake to redeem on my next order, which I'll consider if / whenever I return. And they have a rewards system too I wasn't aware of, guessing it's new?

The interior design is simple to the point, nothing decorative, really casual, but what I did notice and liked were all the illustrations everywhere on the protein station providing a bit of info and white board specials menu with illustrations of little lucky cats. 

Honestly think it's the way they tend to their customers needs, that I really liked most about this place. Despite that this particular order was not as satisfying as other orders I've had that were from here, on prior take out / delivery, I couldn't just give them a below average rating, because they do a good job on that end which I think is what is doing this business good, as the food this time was not as good but the way they treat their guests, is what will probably have me return for another do over of this order in hopes of a full circle satisfaction.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,2,2,3,RnsLTwV8HiICuyU1HDednA
