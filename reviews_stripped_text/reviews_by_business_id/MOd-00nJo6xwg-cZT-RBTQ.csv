I agree that the front desk staff is often rude, curt, and makes me feel as though I am an inconvenience. The guest service of the entire staff is unacceptable. I've received attitude from the front staff, nurses, assistants, and even the doctors themselves.

Today the doctor left the room to get prescriptions for me, and the nurse brought them back. I asked the nurse if I could see the doctor again because I had more questions to discuss, and I was told that my apt. was over and that the doctor had moved on to other patients. I was never asked if there was anything more I needed before the doctor left the room. I let the nurse know that I will not be back to that office.",we2xgvPCA1WiLJ4aPHeRKg,2,0,1,RQoN2HeQ-IMb00_JtsQtOg

Using our hard earned benefits for no quality service. 2 days ago the Dr.wrote me 6# prescription I left with 6# she wrote one that was over the counter, not the cough syrup with codeine I called to bring the Dr's attention the front desk told me she wasn't in get something over the counter.

The second and third time I came back he was just as polite, just as caring, just as respectful, and just as friendly.

So many different people trying to figure out what the dr. wanted them to do. In and out of my room where I was waiting. Miscommunication upon miscommunication. No one is on the same page. Equipment was ancient. One machine didn't work and then I had to wait another 30 minutes for one in another room...The charade went on and on. The nurse was cold and impersonal. She was snappy with me because I didn't know when my last pap smear was... ummm... I the only person on the planet that doesn't keep up with that crap? Anyway, terrible customer service. Felt like they didn't really care about helping me. Dr. Yudez was a nice enough guy. But, I'm still waiting on a referral that he said he would get me over a week ago now. I've called and left messages. I can't improve in my health until I get this referral. Ugh.",40t5RkkYjB-DsMqiSxD_Eg,0,0,1,Ub3lnOtJrwEJ40JxCaGRwg

Joe reeked of cigarettes and was criticizing other patients right outside our exam room door.  Every visit, even as a new patient, took less than 5 minutes. The one follow-up, which we had to attend for lab results, was a staggering 3 minutes. 

I work in the medical field and understand how the industry is changing, but Joe's dismissive and judgmental demeanor will never be welcome in this profession.",k2YDuc0ClYuW86L_6ISnKQ,7,0,2,W5ovE-0URz3AmVDRh8SI6A

However, the front desk staff is horrible. They are snappy, self entitled, and incompetent. 
 If they don't do an overhaul we'll end up leaving because it doesn't matter how good the Dr is if every single time I have to go back three times to get my scripts filled correctly. Their attitude gets worse with every screw up.
I'd rather get so so service with a so so Dr than great service that goes no where due to the desk harpys.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,5,2,2,q8MVRYHeeqW5uKTvenyd2w

I can't handle an office that doesn't answer their phones, doesn't respond to refill requests, and calls you back FOUR (4) days after you leave a message & require an appointment to refill a med you've been on for 8+ years after you had blood work done less than six moths ago.",w3L3cJJh577bzP2xDz-z2A,2,0,1,qTood66BhBcvIdNs2uKWyg

The office does not answer the phone calls from the Pharmacy, they don't answer your phone calls as a patient, but they sure as hell want their money. 

I went in for my annual exam last year (which are free once a year by the way) but since my Doctor brought up something that I had previously discussed, I am being charged my co-pay. 

Also, I have a prescription that is needed filled once a month. In December, my Doctor switched my prescription. Now, I can't get a refill because I need to be seen by the doctor again to make sure I liked it. I called and they wouldn't even speak with the Doctor about it because ""That's not our policy."" 

Seems like this office is all about the money. Between scheduling too many patients and having to sit and wait in the waiting room for an hour+ just to be seen, re-coding things in the computer to get that co-pay. Making patients come in for a two minute visit for prescription refills. Too many patients, very little customer service. We are just another number in their books.",4EcXeoU6_soBxm73UbDNRw,3,0,1,wx6Mes3EoM7SbQ7QNITmvA

The front desk staff, particularly Dawn is the most impersonal and unfriendly people I have ever dealt with. 

They open at 7:00 but they don't even start taking patients for their blood work until 7:30. Not sure what the point of opening early is if you aren't even ready to see patients. I am fasting for blood work because I'm pregnant and now feel light headed and dizzy waiting to be seen. If Dr. Yudez moves from Themis practice I wouldn't be upset because every visit is over an hour to 2.5 no matter how simple the procedure.",ovheJ6EJNLJ--dslnRQ72w,0,0,2,2QOkfymTTWYt8iSDvtkUgA
