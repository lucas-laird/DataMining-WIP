Then I get it back to the office and my chicken sante fe sandwhich was a big sloppy mess and also had a complimentary hair in it. So, In a nutshell it was expensive and disgusting. Threw it out. It has been a while since I had Carl's Jr. But now I'll definitely steer clear.",P5neFGzLzxsvFLFEhxKx3w,0,0,1,Gkx4f01YsIVHrFPDRDZMow
1549160,2013-08-31,2,Seq3iuRR5vThdVeXDc6Dnw,Carl's is one of my favorites.  I remember in my home town this was the first fast food eatery I used an ATM card in to purchase a double bacon cheese burger with fried zucchini.  This location is indeed interesting.  Very clean for an establishment in the area of the 15 & Charleston.  Service was friendly.  Food was I a sure to Carl Karcher's standards.  Just beware of zombie's that might wonder in from time to time.  With that said...be sure to lock your vehicle.,HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,3,4,78MdWRVh3MbEFepM2m8Zwg

I should have shopped around.

Tried one of their 6 dollar burgers...meal came to a whopping $12!!!

Everything that tastes great here is packed with calories, fat, carbohydrates, and the price is like a nice sit-down restaurant.

I got the Six Dollar Jalapeno Burger value meal with an extra patty and extra jalapenos. Holy sh*t, it is really good for a fast food burger. After you eat, you basically feel like a sumo wrestler walking out. WARNING, you may need to be rolled out pf thw restaurant after your meal.",eM09Q7l7akt2w-rLOQ19fQ,0,0,2,RHzqRGNtKIx7v7VsoOjKFQ

Somehow we ended up to order hamburger sets for breakfast.

They are a bit heavy for breakfast, but they tasted great.
The meat was juicy, and the buns are soft and flavorful.
My guest from Japan was impressed by the quality of the food, and he told me the food is worth the price.

The service person was friendly and kept asking if we need anything.  It was equivalent to the service we receive from regular restaurants.  It was a satisfactory breakfast that energized us to keep working til evening by skipping lunch.

Nearby Burger King offers only sweet carbonated drinks, but Carl's Jr serves unsweetened teas and other drinks. It was a plus.",kdpBx1fW8il6KtYnh_QVsg,0,0,5,byIAevvqtPDNMNrPz1ZJOA

3528645,2014-10-15,0,Seq3iuRR5vThdVeXDc6Dnw,Average fast food at best.  But what can you expect from fast-food.  Prices and deals are great.  I favor the breakfast vs lunch or dinner.  Service is fast and correct which means a lot,ccl5JZivv93oVySmX6TBjQ,0,0,3,K_BKsh28wudKGl0L0L3ofQ
4147039,2012-06-21,0,Seq3iuRR5vThdVeXDc6Dnw,"Okay, so Carl's Jr. is a large fast food chain and it is unusual for me to review such a place.  But the Carl's at 1522 W. Charleston (just off the I-15) is a good place.  The service is always friendly.  The food is always fresh.  It comes out pretty quickly even if the place is busy.  And it does get busy around lunch time.  There are a couple of hospitals and a dental school in close proximity.  Walk in there around 11:30-noon during the week and you will almost be guaranteed to observe a sea of scrubs.  It kind of makes you feel safe.  Like there are people who can take care of you in the event of a medical episode.  But I am getting off topic now.  To make a long story short, good service and good food is hard to beat. Oh, and they now have sweet potatoe fries.  They are amazing.  Perfectly crunchy yet tender inside.  A little overly salted for me.  Still good though.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,1,4,i6bKteklgS-ZafIbBrRAqg
4558297,2011-07-17,1,Seq3iuRR5vThdVeXDc6Dnw,"This is my go-to Carl's when I'm hungry after driving back from LA. I just get off the I15 and, here we are. At that point, I'm not looking for anything super delicious or anything... I just want something in my belly to fill me up and last me a while, seeing as I have to get home to do laundry, getting stuff ready, buying groceries...

On more than one occasion, I've come here and it's been empty. That's actually the default situation here, it seems: the dining area will be about 95% empty, and there'll be a few guys manning the kitchen. That doesn't really present a problem for me, because people or not, I need to eat. But since it's always empty, I can usually walk right up to the counter and have someone take my order in 30 seconds or less: teriyaki turkey burger, hold the cheese, criss-cut fries, ranch, Sprite. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best meal in the place. Sure, the $6 burgers are great, too, but they're also about 1000 calories. (I know the Sprite, ranch, and fries aren't the best idea, but that's why I get the turkey sans cheese!)  I usually get my food out to me fairly quickly, and it's consistently pretty good. My only major gripe with them is that their bread seems to always be the worst bread ever. I don't understand it. It's bad on the turkey burgers, and it's passable on the premium burgers. Maybe it's because these guys are so liberal with their sauce that the bread absorbs it? That's my current theory. 

Also, the prices here are on the higher side. I've always felt there's a scale for fast-food restaurant prices: starts at McDonald's on the low side and ends with Carl's on the higher side. The food here is better than McD's, so I guess it's ok. But just be aware of that.

As far as this location goes, it is clearly not on the best side of town. I'm not complaining about it one bit, I'm just stating that this isn't the burger joint to take your girlfriend's parents (take them to Create). It's never been a problem for me, because I roll with the homies, too. The actual restaurant is in pretty good shape, which is a plus. 

All in all, I'll continue coming here when I get off the freeway. It's in the perfect spot for that, the service is quick, and the food is good. That's four stars right there.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,1,4,8tIBO7F1PSGgsvV6mT5tSQ

4 adult and a kid

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Needed a quick lunch before heading back to Reno.

Atmosphere - lots of tables and the place was very busy and clean

Food
  Appetizer - none today. 

  Main Course - I had the chicken strips for the first time. Wow they were so tender and plumb.  Could have put these on a fancy plate and I would have never know it was fast food.

  Dessert - Just a quick bite, no time today

Service - The cashier was an older lady but super sweet, friendly helpful a true customer service experience, I wish I got her name.  The older man bringing out the food was completely friendly and making sure you got what you needed.

Future - Sure, but I doubt it will be any time soon as I live in Reno.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,0,0,5,Zv-zeeo5pBb8PKr7hF5E_A
