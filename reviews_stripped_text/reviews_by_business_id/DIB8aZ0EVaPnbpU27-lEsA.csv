We talked with the one of the owners, Nicole, prior to ordering and she was very helpful and had great suggestions, all of which turned out to be awesome.  The hummus, tatziki, flafel wrap, and spanokopita all hit the spot.  It was nice to be able to try so many of their menu items,  but they were all so good I guess I will just have to order them again next time I go!  For a good experience customer service wise and food wise head to My Buddy's Greek Cafe...oh and make sure you have the baklava too...very moist and has a great flavor without being over sweet....a tasty way to end a great meal!  Thanks Nicole and Buddy for the great experience...I will be back again soon!",YGlHJG1xQ49evnveYZ_UrQ,0,0,5,ow2PUznxjB2-gK_novcCKw

The staff is always friendly. They hook us up with spicy green sauce. I haven't figured out the flavors, but it's good stuff! I love the gyro with a kick. My only complaint is that I prefer a softer more pillowy pita.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,3,_N3O0TUAlxVPXyjTzhH4Rw

Havin' never had a gyro before I was a little weary, but my husband told me I had to try one (& hes a picky eater, so i trust him, lol)

When we walked in, a young lady who worked there opened the door for us. How sweet. It helped because my hubby was carrying our one month old in her car seat. Buddy, the owner and this young lady were all smile and very friendly. They explained the menu to me and told us how they cook everything. such great service. i could tell right away that this was a family owned place that made everything from scratch and really appreciated their customers. they treat you as if youve been going there for years. love that type of service. made me want to come here all the time, and i hadn't even tried the gyros yet. 

I've always heard that lamb is gamey, but this lamb was cooked to perfection. It's very tender and sliced into bite size portions. The cucumber sauce stuff they put on top is very good, and thats surprising to me cause i can't stand cucumber. impressive. Tried the garlic fries & they are delish! Very innovative. Had never had such fresh garlic fries. Mmm, good. Yes, they do put a little too much garlic, but hey, what better way to keep the vampires away, hehe. Jk'ing. But garlic fries are only for the die hard garlic fans.. in which i am one.

Buddy came by twice to make sure our food was okay and to ask if we needed anything else, how sweet! the last time he came by, he offered us a sample of one of his sweets. Don't remember the name but i didn't like it. The hubby did. But Buddy gets an A+ for trying.

This is the place to go for lunch. We've been here a couple times since and will continue to do so. We'd come more often but we live 25 mins away.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,0,4,eI0aZoIndxm_Vt4rw6kcbg

5167210,2010-12-24,0,DIB8aZ0EVaPnbpU27-lEsA,"My friend has been raving about this place for a while now and keeps saying how it has the best gyro in town. I just always thought he liked it so much because of the fact all gyro's are $4.99 each. I thought I'd give it a whirl yesterday for lunch with my little 11 year old friend, Natalie. 

As soon as we walked in, all smiles and cheer were given to us. A very friendly and welcoming greeting was in place. Luckily, we already knew what we wanted to order. One gyro combo worth $7.99 which included a fat gyro, fries, and a drink, and another gyro for me. Natalie and I shared the fries. There's the option to get garlic fries, so we got that one. 

With excitement building up, we got back to the office and started pigging out! I'm happy to say that the gyro was great with full of flavors and the combination of cow and lamb was a hit! It didn't need any sauce which surprised me because I always want the sauce with it. As for the garlic fries, don't get it. It was a mixture of being bland overpowered with fresh garlic.  It also lacked in sodium.  Now, I love garlic but boy was the garlic in this poured way too much. Possibly they should rethink their strategy on the fries. I would not recommend ordering this to anyone. Sorry Buddy. 

I will, however, order the gyro again. As for my little 11 year old friend, Natalie, she has never eaten Greek food before and loved it. For a little girl like her nearly ate the whole fat of goodness.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,2,4,Tsqv8oWZBHHSvLWHuUPH9A

the regular gyro, (for 4.99) was well below average, edible but not good. both the sauce and the veggies tasted wilted, and expired.
the chicken gyro tasted foul... if that was grilled chicken..... (taste like it was boiled first then thrown in a microwave... absolutely disgusting. 
(the veggies and sauce also tasted off on this one as well)

i'm all for bargains, but even if they were a dollar each it would still be over priced. (and mcdonalds mcdoubles are light years ahead of this place.)",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,2,2,1,bEYQXeFjCw4hnjsXgPKiaQ
