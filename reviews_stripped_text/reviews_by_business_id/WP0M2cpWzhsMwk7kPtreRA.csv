They are moving soon apparently, so hopefully the new location will be at least as good as the current one.  Great choice for vegetarians since there is a whole veggie section in the VERY extensive menu, with more options than the usual cheese enchiladas.  Spicy and good salsa.  Portions are huge so come hungry!  Before you even get your meal you get chips with salsa and bean dip, jalapenos and onions, and soup!  Great live music...you may get serenaded at your table.  The bar has a good selection of Mexican beers and tequilas too, as well as many flavored margaritas.",2WniIUDY7MqU1rNL1nwolQ,1,0,4,BTFYU8POeZUczY7ELODCJw

-Food - everything I've tried on the menu is delicious
-Salsa- great variety, from 1-10 chiles.  If you're a chile head like me, get the habanero salsa, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not, don't worry, there are plenty of milder choices so pick your heat level & jump right in.
-Chips- fresh, served w/mild salsa & bean dip.  Restrain yourselves, as portion sizes are quite large & you need to leave room, trust me.
-Tequila- Good selection, but pretty basic list.  Still, good choices to be found.
-Location- If you visit Vegas & want to get off the strip, great choice.  There actually is a real Las Vegas.

449106,2011-02-16,0,WP0M2cpWzhsMwk7kPtreRA,"I heard a lot of good things about this place so alas I gave in to try it. I must say that I am a skeptic when it comes to Mexican food. I am from New Mexico which is famous for it's green & red chile so I get a little excited when I see a restaurant that uses NM chile.

First up - the usual chips, salsa & bean dip. The standard salsa wasn't bad for being super mild. I need fire so alas you can request something hotter and they are more than happy to oblige. There are 11 other salsas to choose from that I didn't know about until the end of my visit.

Next, fideo - the fideo here was flavorful and much more hearty as it had veggies in it and used a thicker noodle than the usual vermcelli noodle. I did enjoy the twist on the traditional fideo.

Entrees- These suckers came out quick within 5 mins of ordering, which makes me question the freshness. But then again it is Mexican food so a lot of it you can't make spur of the moment. My friend comes here all the time so she ordered her usual carne asada tacos which she swears by. I didn't taste them as I was full from my chile verde plate. The pork was tender but not very spicy. Actually it was a little watered down for my taste that the flavor was gone. How you have disgraced the famed NM green chile by denying it's full flavor to shine! haha The flour tortillas tasted as if they were store bought instead of freshly made. I was a little disappoint because I miss freshly made tortillas.

We had a couple cervezas to add to our order. On the second round, it took our waiter at least 10 mins to bring us our drinks. For a minute I thought he had gone on break and forgot until he saw us and remembered.  So while enjoying the atmosphere and the guy playing on his guitarra, we get the bill - we spent $50 for 2 people. Hmm paying $16 for mediocre chile verde and $13 for two small tacos and $4.50 a beer. Good lord that bill racks up quick. 

I think my next trip there will solely consistent of drinks and apps. It's a pretty entertaining atmosphere. If you're picky like me, get the lunch special or bar special to save a few bucks. I can't complain too much because the service wasn't bad.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,1,2,3,nM6BvuMdmuCR8WTMaC98Rg

If you come here and leave hungry, its your own fault.  (Perhaps you left hungry because you don't like Mexican food, in which case, you probably should have gone elsewhere.)

The standard chip basket is served with a really tasty bean dip.  From there, I had a simple dish: huevos con chorizo y patates.  It's basically a breakfast scramble with Mexican ingredients.

We live in san diego so mexican food is something we're pretty darned familiar with.

I had a combo with flautas (which turned out to look more like a enchilada, i wasn't expecting it to be covered) and a taco. My wife had a tostada. The chips you could tell were made fresh, and the salsa was pretty good as well.

765951,2011-01-18,0,WP0M2cpWzhsMwk7kPtreRA,"I got the Carnitas and my wife got the Enchiladas De Verduras (vegetarian).  My wife's meal was OK, the vegetables were fresh and cut into small chunks, but it was very bland and had no taste.  My Carnitas were nothing short of disgusting, both in looks and taste.  My dish came with rice, beans, tortillas, and two thin slabs of the most fatty, disgusting looking, and tasteless pork I've ever seen in my life (my wife stated ""That looks disgusting"").  The menu says the Carnitas are pork loin, but this is not true.  Pork loin is a lean meat, but the stuff (I can't call it meat) I got was more fat than meat.  I tried to eat around the fat, but spit out most of what I put into my mouth due to the overwhelming amount of fat.  In the end, all I ate was some beans, and tasteless rice, nothing else (I left this place hungry, very unsatisfied, and very mad).  To add insult to injury, when the woman who cleared our plates (seeing I didn't really eat my meal) asked how was everything, I responded ""mediocre, at best.""  She smiled and walked away.  I can only guess she didn't care.  11 dollars for my Carnitas lunch is no bargain, but the fact that it was uneatable puts it in the rip-off category.   My wife and I have been to hundreds of Mexican restaurants all over the country, and this was by far the worst, no contest.  Although we hate fast food, I would rather go to taco bell than this place.  After reading all the reviews about this place, we were so excited to go and get some great Mexican food.  Maybe they had a bad day, but the fact that they didn't care that my meal was uneatable, shows how much they don't care about quality food, or the customer.  We paid close to 40 bucks for lunch (our meals, soft drinks, and tip), and felt totally ripped-off.

I had a cup of albondigas soup and ceviche salad.  
The soup was good and hearty for one cup.  
As for the ceviche salad, it was a very generous portion. Unfortunately, I had my heart set on the ""ceviche de camaron"" not the ""shrimp ceviche salad"" but I guess I mispronounced it or something.  The good news is that the ceviche is same in both recipes and costs exactly the same but I left so much lettuce I felt wasteful.  
After my early dinner, the busser/co-waiter gave me complimentary churros! So yummy and fresh tasting.  The churros were warm, like right out of the fryer, not heated in a microwave.

Some of my faith in Las Vegas Mexican food has been restored by Viva Mercados. The restaurant resembles some chain Mexican places (Chi Chi's Macayo, etc..) but that's where the comparison ends. This is a good restaurant with great specials. 

If you sit in the Cantina, you may order some of the Cantina specials. I had a Carnitas Taco & Margarita special ($8.95). The margarita was a good ""restaurant"" margarita, and the carnitas was flavorful and well made. I asked for it spicy, so the chef used some very hot Chili d'arboro. This taco was en fuego y delicioso! 

The menu is pretty big, and there are lots of items I'd like to try. The service was wonderful, and the people working there seemed honestly happy to be there. It often goes unappreciated, but a positive morale amongst the staff really improves the dining experience for the customers. Whoever is responsible for training the staff at this pleasant place needs to write a book, because so many other restaurants in Las Vegas could greatly benefit from this ""Zappos-like"" approach.

We went here for dinner tonight and I had to review this place right away. 
It hurts to even type right now and I even bought home half of my meal. 

Hope your hungry when you arrive at their door.

We frequent parts of the Baja California Sur....and the simple fact that their is A LOT of bad Mex in this town...it was refreshing to find a simple, sit down Mex restaurant in this town.

First of all...I can not understand why some reviewers could not tell this food was fresh and made in house. Maybe Mexican is not your fav style of food. It's not mine either but I know fresh Mex when I see/taste it.
Being a person that hates the R place (disgusting) and has not put Taco Bell (or any fast food or texmex type stuff) in their mouth for about 20 years...This place is good. Why would someone compare the R word to this place? :D 

Their choices of salsas are AMAZING and I have only seen the sauce variety one other place in the US. Their menu is large. Overwhelmingly large.

Of course we started with the free chips, salsa and bean dip. I'm off spicy things for a while so I did not order any free fried jalapenos, but I wish I did :( I'm not fond on the free chips and sauce thing but I tried a few and enjoyed the very mild salsa and mild bean dip.

Hubby and I both ordered water to drink, even though 2 for $5.95 margaritas were calling my name..hubby can not drink tequila he is allergic and it makes his face turn the color of an oopla loompa :)

A few minutes after ordering I saw someone get a cup pf soup and it's a cold NYE night and I said to hubby ""wow soup sounds good I wish I ordered some I wonder what is in it?"" About that time our server sat two cups of soup in front of us! Hubby is not a big soup fan but after I did a few yummms out loud...I looked up and his soup was gone :) We loved the light tomato based broth soup! It had a dash of fresh oregano and some tiny skinny noodles in it! Different!

Service was fast and the water glasses were huge! I only needed one refill and that was drinking A LOT of water.

Our entrees came out promptly and we were both very pleased with our order.
I'm not a big red meat eater...but for some reason I always try and get hubby to eat something that I want to try one bite of :)))))))

It worked tonight and he ordered the carna estada burrito enchilada style. I tasted a bite of the yummy sauce and the meat and I was very surprised at how light and fresh the sauce taste! Not too salty and not grainy/powdery tasting. 

Both of our entrees came with rice and beans. The beans were lightly mashed and the rice was soft and fluffy and not saucy. 

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sFIrlJWl4ojLhJy4L-pFMQ&userid=zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA

My entree was VERY good. It was the fish tacos. 
I almost broke my neck whipping it towards the server when he ask......""do you want Tilapia  or Sea Bass??!??!"" oh wow, I have a choice :) I ordered the Sea Bass in flour tortilla. I should have tried their corn torts. It came with a side of spicier salsa similar to a pico but finer chopped. I can hardly ever get hubby to eat fish and he said it was DELICIOUS! The two tacos were filled with fish and the cabbage slaw with oregano vinaigrette was very yummy. Grilled to perfection here is an up close picture of it:

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA

Needless to say I could only eat one of the huge tacos and a bite each of my beans and rice. 

Our bill after the 20% off (CHECK IN through yelp and they will look at your phone)  was only $24.xx. Walking out with a heavy to-go I think it was an extremely cheap dinner for the size and quality.

loved the chicken enchiladas too. whole list of different salsas numbered for hotness. husband tried the top 3. 10 was crazy burn your taste buds off with no flavor but other than that they had their own unique flavors. highly recommend trying a few. you get little cups to sample and can purchase the larger size. we bought some to take home. was a nice clean atmosphere. servers were all extremely personable and helpful. nice chill feel. not loud and you don't feel rushed. also found they have nice bar area where you can eat too. went with my husband and three year old. noticed they sat us in the back area way from the quieter diners and instead with other kids which was refreshing.  will be back again soon. really enjoyed it.",U6Yb2BFi-5tDyqD_9aeSlA,0,0,5,yQttWWL3yA2KNtZuPOry9Q

Greeted with grins from the staff upon entering through the front doors. Hostess sat us in no time and gave us the option: window or non-window seat. Whole place was scattered with x-mas lights, ribbons, ornaments.. In conjunction with their already decent decorated interior, the holiday theme just set a nice warm tone.

Chips and salsa and bean dip!! Chips were typical but they threw in some green, red and some black chips in there.. I don't know about black but the green and red, X-mas Spirited Tortilla Chips! Oh, how creative.. Salsa was alright. But I've only been to a few places that served bean dip, which was great! And it tasted great as well!

El Burro: Carne Asada Burrito with Monterey Jack Cheese Melted on top, green chile and red chile both on the side. Also comes with rice, beans and salad. Diced pieces of meat that had some real authentic flavor to it! Combine a fork full of meat with the Monterey cheese and (I liked) the red sauce = Definitely up there for me! I really enjoyed it! Only thing was the Burrito looked pretty small  for the plate. Rice, Beans and Salad = No Complaints.

Chile Colorado: break-apart tender cubes of meat smothered in its red chile sauce (how its supposed to be and its not really spicy at all). Not a bad version of this dish, pretty tasty but more peppery than ones i've had before. Also came with beans, rice and salad (plus I opted for flour tortillas). 

* Staff were on top of their game: drinks were refilled quickly, server brought 2nd round of salsa and bean dip without asking and food was taken and served pronto..

Summary:
Service was on Target *Bullseye!*, Well Decorated, Price was a bit high for the portions given and the Food was a Solid 4 Stars!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,5,2,4,bHx7N81X1AeDX4zdj0YZNQ

we were a party of 7 so we were seated in a large and comfy booth.  our waiter was super friendly, and while he set us up with two baskets of chips and 2 sets of salsa and bean dips, he recommended a few favorites on the menu before getting us our drinks.  [i totally appreciate that it was before he took our drink order because we could think on his recommendations while we read the menu and waited for our drinks.  it just makes sense!]

they have a great fresh salsa and amazing bean dip.  we killed it, and our waiter wasn't hesitant to refill the chips, salsa, or bean dip! dope!!

First and foremost I had a large large margarita and large large shot of tequila!  
and after that .... I had a big big sombrero to wear for the remainder of the night during dinner!  how fun right?  It really was.. I have pictures.   

I had the chicken flautas.  It came with MORE fresh salsa, guacamole, a mini side salad, beans, and rice!  It was sooooo yummy.  It was my birthday so I can't say much for anyone else and what they thought of their food.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the place... but I think after a couple drinks everything starts to taste good.

NOT! 

Actually to tell you the truth it was a bright, hot & sunny day [like usual in Vegas] and my great aunt and uncle were visiting. Needed a quick, and close restaurant to grub at. Mexican food sounded good..

Hey, look its Viva Mercados!

[my aunt] so you've been there?!

[me] No.. but lets try it.

Walking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.

The hostess sat us quickly. 1 star for that. lets just state.. I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy. 

Quick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.

Didn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]

The food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good

Would have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,1,1,3,t57thGdsF0of7iFM7R2crQ

We've been coming to Viva ever since they were at there former location on Flamingo.  I really loved the funkiness of the first location and initially felt that the new location on Rainbow was a little, I don't know, sterile in comparison. 

We hadn't been to Viva for a long while - and we had some celebrating to do!  We arrived pretty early for dinner on a Friday and were seated immediately.  Being the good Yelper that I am, I immediately checked in.  To my surprise Viva offers a 20% off your bill check-in offer!  Win!

Once we were seated we received a basket of their complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip.  I like the salsa, but LOVE the bean dip.  It's hard to leave room for the main course!  We ordered up our entrees and drinks - Tostadas Acapulco-style and a Sauzarita Margarita (Sauza Gold w/ Grand Marnier) on the rocks for me.  They serve one of my favorite fideo soups here, and it was as good as I remembered it. 

When the entrees arrived they were RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!  My tostadas were piled high with a ceviche-like mountain of chilled shrimp, langostino, and crab with pico de gallo, queso fresco and a dab of sour cream.  Refreshing citrus flavors and huge chunks of seafood.  So yummy - but I could only finish one.  We asked our terrific server (didn't get his name but he was great) for boxes - and they surprised us with complimentary freshly-made churros at the end of the meal.  I managed to polish off one of the churros, even though I was totally stuffed.

 The fideo soup is kid friendly and tastes great. My son loves this as well as the beans with his chips. Again, our kid loves to come here.

I also have a problem with the prices of the food. The dips for the chips are just OK and the service is decent. Margarita will kill a diabetic though cause of the amount of sweet mix they use.

After paying out the nose for a middling Jetta rental (word of advice, NEVER rent a car from a hotel downtown. Just pay the 30 bucks to get to the airport) we finally got away from the bland flavors of downtown dining and got into the real Vegas experience. 

Viva Mercados didn't let us down. 

From the starters (great chips, excellent salsa and wonderful bean dip) to the margaritas (not acidic, just-so) to the meals this place hit spots for me I hadn't experienced with Mexican dining before. 

The prices were a little high, but for the quantity and quality it was worth it. Every bite was special. My barbacoa pork was textured, succulent, and bursting with flavor. My partner's tamales were remarkably like home cooking and everything else we tried was equally spot-on. 

The decor is somewhat cheesy, but the service is excellent. Why can't expensive restaurants be attentive like this?

Another person in our party ordered the Mexican style soft chicken tacos -- she said they were good, but agreed with my beans and rice evaluation.

They serve chips with salsa and beans and it was pretty decent salsa they give you. I however did not want to stuff myself too much on chips.

The menu is extensive, but wasn't exactly finding what I was looking for in the appetizers- none sounded good and they are the same price as some entrees, so thought I might as well get my favorite thing which chile verde (pork) enchiladas.  Off the ""combiaciones mexicanas"" menu you can pick a choice of one two three items which come with rice, beans and fideo soup. I just got one item of the chile verde enchilada. It was pretty good actually, the green sauce is a bit tangy which I like and the pork in it was tender. The fideo soup was just OK- it had good flavor, but it was a little cilantro heavy...less cilantro and it was be quite nice actually. I thought the rice was good with my entree (I asked for no beans).  I got a jamaica to drink and their mix is good. I've had it plenty of times in other establishments where it was just way too sweet and had to be cut with water. 

Mom and Gma shared a combiaciones of a cheese enchilada and a chile verde burrito and added a cup of albondigas soup for Grandma. Gma liked her albondigas and it was very generous with the meatballs for a small cup so she wants to come back for when she's feeling like having her favorite soup. Grandma liked the enchilada but the tangy green sauce on the burrito she did not like as much. Mom however agreed with me that the green sauce is quite nice and a favorite for both of us. She was in agreeance with too much cilantro in the fideo, but that it was promising. One set back was that on part of moms half of the enchilada it was lukewarm and cheese wasn't hot and gooey like the rest. 

Service was OK. We were check in on once by a manager. I never got a single refill, but mom got hers once from our server. At that time though everyone was about done eating so I just finished my water instead before leaving. 

I thought what I got was good, but we had some setbacks with no refill for me and a cold spot in moms enchilada. The price isn't too expensive, but it's $10-28 a plate for dinner  with a majority on the upper end of things, around $16-18 which is quite more than some other Mexican sit down establishments. My single enchilada was $11  (a plate of 3 of them was like $16). I'll probably drop in for the lunch specials or try more of the signature dishes for dinner since it's right by work. So far though my impression is that it is a okay spot, but there are definite hole in the wall spots I currently much prefer for price, taste and hospitality.

Bobby from Viva Mercado;

Thanks for a comment back. However I need to point out something that does not make sense. So my receipt for dinner with the combaciones mexicans one item plate dinner with enchilada, rice, beans, fideo was $10.50, not the $8.95 you quoted.

Also on your website it says $10.50 right there on the dinner menu. 
http://www.vivamercadoslv.com/dinnermenu3.jpg

And that lunch one item is $9.50.
http://www.vivamercadoslv.com/lunch1menu.jpg

Just saying, that this is confusing for a customer to have the owner say different prices than the website says and what my receipt told me.

Since I've been there to the time you commented a few days later, did the price drop or something? I doubt it so something doesn't add up right here that needs to be cleared up.

This is a nice little joint to check out if you have a big appetite. Right off the bat I can tell you the proportions are large. They'll start you off with red sauce and bean dip, which I was pleased with as the red sauce had a kick to it and it was just perfect as far as texture goes. I was more than satisfied with my order of TACOS DE PESCADO (TALAPIA/Corn Tortillas) with beans and rice. Believe me, the tacos alone will fill you up. Except the rice was not so good, bland in taste. My friend had an order of green chili enchiladas. The chicken was tender, the cheese was good, blended, and melted nicely with the dish BUT the most important part of plate- Green Sauce- was no good :( I was disappointed. Normally, green sauce is sweet and spicy- but this type of green sauce seemed sour- and ruined the enchiladas. My other friend had a red chili carne stew, that's right, I said STEW. So why did his plate come out with carne, red chilli sauce on top, ON TOP of rice? Not your traditional Mexican stew, but none the less when my friend complained, the waiters and waitress were more than happy to replace his meal.

It seems like Viva Mercado's has been here forever.  From the salsa down to the awesome mariachi they have on the weekend, everything snaps with charm when you walk in the door.

And a really cute full bar right in the middle of the place makes me feel right at home. (yep, I was born in a bar.)

The biggest reason I wanted to YELP about Mercado's is, they're moving soon and the word needs to get out.   They are moving from a strip mall on West Flamingo and Jones to a free standing home on South Rainbow and Spring Mountain. (thankfully still in my 'hood.)

When in the mood for that tasty random margarita night, this is the place to go hands down.  I can't wait to see it's new home, and hopefully I'll see you there.....sombrero' and all.",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,1,0,5,4xVTcUa88L-ADPsyMzd4qg

I love this joint. My family and I have been coming here for years (back when they were tucked away in a strip mall in Spring Valley). 

The location is large and I have never experiened a wait. As soon as you are sat, a man rushes over with fresh salsa, hot bean dip, and warm tortilla chips. (Heaven!) Luckily, their menus are coated in plastic, otherwise I would have killed 236 menus in my life time.

The prices have gone up over the years, but your chips and dips are unlimited and you get free soupa de fideo when you order an entre (dinner only). I like to add a spoonful of salsa to mine for a little kick. 

Where to begin on their vast options. Their ceviche is delcious and comes with fresh avacdo. They blend together to create a magical flavor. To die for. Their enchiladas are superb. Yum to the yum, yum, yum. The fajitas sizzle and smell and taste delightful. My sister is a fan of their queosdillas, she would recommend the chicken; it's her ""usual."" (Two reviewers under one review!) My Mom really loves their carne anything. And she will tell you, anything. (It just became a three way).

There are several different dessert options; the usual suspects: flan, fried ice cream, sopapias. The fried ice cream is delish.

Viva Mercados hits the spot. Decent prices. Friendly and efficient staff. No long waits. Clean place. Good, consist food. They had me at Bean Dip!",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,5,3,4,le1zMCbpQHX9dA6YOVt9qQ

It has tender pieces of steak, grilled and stuffed with pico de gallo. It's known as a big burrito, they say a pound plus, comes with rice and frijolles de la olla inside. It was also comes with sopa de fideos, arroz, and frijoles refritos. It is a lot of burrito and I ended up taking half home for lunch the next day! 

The flavors are good, the steak tender and juicy, and just right amount of spice. I enjoy most the menu items here and am never disappointed. The margarita's are sweet and cold, the service is fast and they are friendly. We never seem to have a bad meal here.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,4,qiwfgPsf0t1JNg7zgXqccQ

We (party of 5) came in today for Brunch.
After asking two waiters 3 time for water and half way thru my meal, I finally got water.  I also asked our waiter for the habanero sauce which I had to remind him again half way thru my meal.  After paying our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the Bar where I stood for over 5 minutes while the Bartender and servers watched the game ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no service.  I finally said in a loud voice to the Bartender. Quit watching the game and get me our drinks. This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.",gWTOYTdpcm0xsgY6k57PGg,1,0,1,Q-NH17roMK2ZnPgarwllwA

After moving to the big location in the Wal-Mart parking lot it lost a little bit of appeal as it's always packed and not quite as quaint.
Start you off with the traditional chips, salsa & bean dip. Traditional soup before your meal and then dig in! We've had multiple offerings here on multiple occasions and the one thing that always stand out above everything else is the INCREDIBLE customer service we receive from our server!

The place was very clean with open spaces, and the atmosphere is nice.  They had a mariachi, but he had more style than I was used to, wearing a simple nice shirt, pants and tie instead of the sombrero/serape combo that all supposed stereotypical mariachis seem forced to wear.  Even better, you could enjoy his crooning without him getting in your face, so it wasn't awkward, and kept on the pleasant side.

The food is tasty and served very quickly.  I tried the chicken with cream/wine/garlic, and it was spicy.  Not overbearingly so, but just enough to give it a full flavor.  The servers were good about attending to your needs.  Prices are fair enough for what you get.  They seem to have a healthy tequila list of which I'll have to sample for the next time.

Admittedly, I was in a bit of a grumpy mood when I went there, but the overall restaurant experience lightened me up.  I had a good time with the place, and I'm sure the experience will improve as my mood does for the next time.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,0,0,5,kHwi4PbG6772dSW4bm-gIw

Wrong, we had just dropped off the car to have the tires rotated down the street and the guy said okay thank you we will see you in an hour and half. So we decided we would go grab a bite to eat. Why not try Viva Mercados. 

For the time being around 5:30 I expected to wait but that was not the case, we were seated immediately and the server was on top of the bean dip, salsa, and chips. We were a very easy table for the drinks, 3 Waters with lemon and and kids apple juice. While looking over the menu I was a little taken back by the $8 Kids meal price and the high prices on the food, I may sound like a cheap skate here but I'm sorry I did not feel like we were walking into a upper scale Mexican restaurant. My chimichanga was good and i did have leftovers but the entire time I was thinking about the fact that I very easily could have received the same exact item at a hand full of other places for almost half of the price. 

Enough about the prices.... The chimichanga I mentioned above was the shredded beef chimichanga that comes enchilada style with sour cream and guacamole, beans and rice and your sopa ahead. The meat was very tender and flavorful and the beans were pretty good, my only complaint was the rice, it was very dry. As far as i could tell the drinks must have been strong since the ladies in the booth across from us seemed pretty tottered... Overall the food is good and the service was great but I personally feel the prices are a little steep..

Anyways, from what I gather, Viva preceded the Lindo restaurants and Lindo ripped off their model with the bean dip and fideos soup and I've had passable meals at Lindo restaurants through the years, but I far prefer the experience at Viva.  The food seems a bit zestier.  The atmosphere is a little more sophisticated, plus they originated the Americanized Mexican restaurant model that the Lindo group seems to have taken over.  

They do have the same overly cheddar-topped, canned refried beans and sitting in a steamer spanish rice thing as the Lindo's but somehow it seems  better and tastier to me.

I usually ignore traditional mexican restaurants, as i tend to find the rice and beans untasty, opting for the americanized albertos type of mexican food.

This place was well decorated, with friendly service. I ordered the flauta and my companion ordered 2 carne asada tacos. i loved my flauta. (its basically a burrito that they deep fry before hand.) Mine came with beef that literally was moist and so tender it was falling apart on the fork. it also had  nice sweet marinade to it. the 2 carne asada tacos were good too. It had a nice meaty taste to it, but defintiely not as good as the flauta. the portions were pretty big. i opted just for a single serving (as they gave you options to order another portion for 3 dollars more), but i couldn't even finish one portion.

each dish came with arrozo ( a noodle tomato soup was terrific) plus rice, refried beans.  All for about 11 bucks.

A decent price for top notch food.

I'll definitely be dropping by here again the next time i'm in vegas.

Yes, your large party policy is a direct reflection of your customer service, since it affects your customers. I'm sorry too. My family and I have been regular customers for over a decade and will not be returning. There are simply too many other restaurants that put a higher priority on customer service, with equally as good food.

Las Vegas is lacking in quality Mexican food, but this place is all right in my book. Not the best, but definitely worth checking out in town.

They have a good variety of salsa, all you need to do is ask for some more options. Some of their breakfast / brunch specials are pretty delicious and you can add an alcoholic beverage for not too much more money.
