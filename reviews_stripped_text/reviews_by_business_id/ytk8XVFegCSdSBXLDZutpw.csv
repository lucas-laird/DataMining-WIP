The star of the show was the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Which on the show, looked amazing.  The chili cheese fries were made with copious amounts of oxtail and was a meal in itself.   I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.  That's the same price as a burger!",yctYv9E1rK6AYTx1FHU3gw,1,0,2,fOhjdG06CzRRTD2VvYPuVA

121419,2016-03-05,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Six of us went to Bachi Kitchen and had the worst experience.  It will be a while before we try this place again, if ever.  Two of us ordered the short ribs loco moco (included fried rice and macaroni salad).  One of us got short ribs on top of polenta and the other got short ribs on a bun with onions which was specifically requested to be omitted. When questioned that we got the wrong orders, we were told that they did not have fried rice and our meals were substituted without even asking us.  Another in our party ordered an omelet.  The omelet came runny, uncooked.  The omelet was returned.  Not a very pleasant experience.
Also, the salt on the table looked like pepper!  Thinking it was pepper, we all put salt on our food thinking it was pepper.  The waitress should have told us it was a special salt. We had to ASK for pepper!  What's up with that?  Why wasn't it on the table?????",Pmg-yDDfzrKVGgxK5NRwfA,0,0,1,LwEeztjDHRBaKEynNiTAHA

275214,2015-07-18,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"I've heard a lot about this place so I was really looking forward to eating here.  Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  While the food was good, service was absolutely horrible.  We walked in at about noon on a Tuesday, the atmosphere was nice, but we waited almost 10 minutes just to be seated.  The restaurant was about half full and there were quite a bit of open tables.  No one acknowledged us for a couple of minutes, and when the server did, she just called across the restaurant that she would ""be right with you"" as she continued to do other things.  There were three servers, one obviously was new since he didn't have a clue what was going on, and all three continued to ignore us.  So like fools we stood there waiting.  In hindsight we should have left and gone somewhere else, but we really wanted to eat here.  A party of 7 or 8 arrived after U.S. and left because it took so long just to be seated.  Finally we were seated and it took awhile to get our menus and drink order.  We waited another 15 minutes to order our food.  We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, miyagi burger and the bahn mi burger.  Took a little over half an hour to get our food, but the food was great.  That would have made up for the horrible service had the server not dropped the aioli sauce on the ground causing it to spill on my friends shoe and all over his chair and the ground.  The sauce left an oil stain on his shoe.  At least the server apologized profusely and comped one of his drinks, but I didn't think it was enough.  At that point we were irritated and just wanted to pay and leave.

Food was really good, service was really horrible.  Bachi burger - you need to hire more servers to provide better service!

Definitely not eating at this location ever again!  Hopefully another location can provide better service so we can enjoy the delicious food.",iPrIKg6fajJsQSiZEowv5w,2,0,1,2Z8KU5q-mDLt6eTtYpLH0g

When only five tables occupied it took me over 50 minutes to get a burger and then it was wrong. Each time I have gone it has been to see it improve but instead it just diminishes. Their menu is limited, some items not even available. They seem insulted when you don't want their magic aioli curry concoction or ask to change what is on their menu as they overdue everything on it. Overpriced, sorry staff, and marginal food. Better bet Wendy's or even the burgers at Black Bear Diner a few blocks away, at half the price and they don't mind making it the way you want.

671957,2015-09-02,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Stopped here this past Friday night for dinner.  Based on the previous reviews, I was expecting a crowd.  We showed up around 6:30 and there were only about 4 tables seated in the restaurant.  Not that I'm complaining about being immediately sat on a Friday night.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries based off of the many Yelp recommendations.  They were ok, but both my wife and I thought the chili was oddly sweet.  

The sweet trend continued with the burgers.  I had the Miyagi-San burger and my wife had the Black & Green burger.   I ordered mine medium and she order hers well done (I know it's a sin, I'm working on her).  However, mine came out well done and hers came out medium.  If we had ordered the same burger we could have just switched but it would have been a difficult task because of the different sauces on the burgers.  Mine had that same oddly sweet flavor from the chili cheese fries, while hers did not.  The buns were solid and held up to the sauces well, but I just couldn't get past that sweetness.  It was a decent enough burger, but when you're paying $15+ for a burger it better be extraordinary.  This one was just ok, but with a side of sweetness.  I would go back to try one of their other concoctions, but I would shy away from the Miyagi-San.",9U93GIZX00iEgfOTsW1taw,1,0,3,s3OIAKEEwYjDhLe5rLBWMQ

Like no kidding sherlock, you refused to serve us any french fries so that is correct that I won't pay for them.

    This has got to be one of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas! A friend of mine invited me out to the Bachi Burger on Windmill a while back and was just blown away by the tasty dishes. Sadly (for me that is) the windmill location has certainly gotten a lot more popular and therefore a little crowded when I go, but not to fear! Bachi Kitchen is just as good if not better!

    As you walk into the Bachi Kitchen you're greeted by the excellent staff right away. There's never a crowd when I go so my party and I were seated right away. As you look around you'll notice a more colorful and modern decor (at least compared to the Windmill location). Our server was very generous (and I apologize greatly for not remembering your name good sir) and always made sure we were never short on drinks while answering any questions we had. Any staff member I've ever had wait for me at this location has been very patient and well-spoken. Now to the food!

    I'll only be reviewing the food that I ate of course, but first and foremost.. Ox Tail Chili Fries. A heaping helping of fries covered with Ox tail chili, cheese, jalapeños, and topped with a fried egg, this is a must for anyone that goes to Bachi. More than enough to share with a party of 4, I appreciate that they lay down additional plates to take from the pile(probably to avoid the carnage of 4 people fighting over this wonderful creation). Along with the Ox tail fries we ordered a bowl of garlic butter edamame which is incredibly addictive! We had it prepared via ""sautéed"" but either way (the other being stir-fried) is sure to please your taste buds.

   For the main course I always order the soon-to-be-famous Miyagi-San burger, made of a grass fed Wagyu burger patty, chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. This heavenly creature is sure to leave you feeling full and satisfied. Seeing as I am a health nut, I like to add avocado on there as well because why not?! Probably one of the best burgers I've had, and continues to be whenever I order one.

   To conclude my first ever yelp review I have to say, if you are ever in the vegas area and want to enjoy an awesomely prepared meal with some ""not your everyday ingredients"", then Bachi Kitchen is a must! I love coming to this place for lunch, and thanks to the great staff and chefs, will continue to make the trip out here while recommending it to others.

   One last note, if you don't order the Oxtail Chili Fries, did you even go to Bachi Kitchen?",JIWx5yepJDRlztdLosu7-w,9,9,5,WakaZAy_mq4CCHncewZT_A

1184426,2015-07-19,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"In Las Vegas visiting a friend and we decided to try Bachi Burger.  When we first walked in the restaurant was far from full and we were greeted immediately and asked to wait for seating. At first it seemed there was only one server for the whole restaurant and she looked overwhelmed. After a couple minutes we were seated and another server arrived and took our drink/appetizer order. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. Our server was making drinks at the bar as well as taking orders over the phone for takeout, it was clear they were understaffed for a Saturday night.  That being said the servers were kind and highly attentive while at the table.  At this point in the experience you're probably wondering why they received 4/5. 
 The food was absolutely amazing, so good that even a decent speed of service would have received 5/5. The Salt and Pepper French Fries were outstanding. Layers of jalapeños and cilantro were complemented by a spicy but flavorful Garlic Chili Aioli. The choice of burger was the Spicy Miso Burger, honestly the best burger I've ever had. The meat was ordered medium and cooked to perfection, stuffed with flavorful onions and a hand full of shredded lettuce that provided freshness and crunch. The combination of sauces were creamy and spicy with the perfect hint of miso in the backgrounds. As if that wasn't enough there was also a fried egg, not one flavor overpowering the burger.  I finished the meal off with the Chocolate Hazelnut Malt, a must after any burger. 
Being someone who holds costumer service in high regard giving this 4 stars was difficult, but the food was just that good. All in all I will revisit Bachi Burger next time I'm in Vegas and hopefully the service has improved.

We started strong with their Ox Tail Fries topped with Egg, seems to be the only way to do it.  If you do want to wasteful, try to have at least 2-3 people going after this.  The ox tail was slowly braised down to perfection with texture similar to chill and topped onto the fries, and the egg just help brought out the Asianess and enhanced the flavor for the dish.

I got the Ronin burger for main course, the meat was juicy and cooked nicely, and the sauce was not really needed.  I was a fan of the coleslaw though.  We ended our meal with their Seasonal Warm Bread Pudding.  The ice cream on the side was a nice addition, and the bread was not flavored enough though, still decent, but not amazing.

Kikis Burger - Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. 

Cooked to a medium. Perfect temp for burgers. Not too rare. Not too cooked. Nice and juicy. I havent had Bachi in a long time but i feel like the burgers reduced in size. I'm not much of a fan of eating burgers but once in a while, its ok. Though its probably been a good few years since ive been to Bachi. Oops? Burger was nice and flavorful. I didn't notice the variety of mushrooms in the burger though. Garlic Chili Aioli is delicious. Love garlic anything.. AND its spicy ! yum ! Lol

Brought my coworkers here a few weeks ago for lunch and everyone raved about their food, it was their first time trying this place. My Kiki burger which is my favorite was also really great. Everyone ordered burgers and their fries with pineapple ketchup which is so delicious. 

Came back last week to do it all over again and our experience was very different. The burgers weren't as juicy and barely warm. Weird because we were the only people dining at the time we arrived. The caramelized bacon wasn't cooked well so it was extra chewy and I had to get rid of nearly all of it and most of the mushrooms that come on the Kiki burger weren't cooked evenly because some of them were sliced thinly and others were very thick. Had to remove most of them as well. It was almost like a completely different burger :(

Service was off as well as our sever forgot our fries until nearly the end of our meal and wasn't around often to refill our drinks as she kept disappearing. 

I do like this restaurant and I feel like their other locations are much better but prices are high. A burger, fries and a drink will run you between $14-$18 for lunch. When the ingredients aren't cooked well it definitely doesn't make it worth it. 

Hopefully they can fix a few things and they should offer lunch specials with smaller burgers that come with fries. Just my opinion.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,44,35,3,pYFF2Mtk5hMi-aG6uqSdCg

And for anyone in shock about this, ask yourself, if this restaurant wasn't associated with the ""Bachi"" name, would you really rate your overall experience as high as you did? This was my 2nd time here and both visits were for brunch. The food is good but the service is slow and painful .. The first time, our food took 35 minutes.. This time it was 50 minutes before the orders came out .. correct. Let me explain... The restaurant was open an hour by the time we arrived and there were no customers. This should tell you service should be quick as well as cooking time since the grill should be wide open. After ordering, it was 15 minutes before our waitress told us they were out of the short ribs for my short rib loco moco. I was calm about it and asked for the wagyu patty cooked medium. My fiancé ordered an omelet with roasted tomatoes.. 20 minutes later, he was told they were out of roasted tomatoes? When we said, ""Omg .."" The waitress said ""hey, I don't do the ordering.. Don't shoot the messenger."" By the way, there were 3 of us and by this time, my sis already had her food which was the salmon latke (latke is a potato pancake - looks like a really flat hash brown). The omelet followed .. And it was missing the hash browns. Why this wasn't made at the same time the latke was, we'll never know. Fiancé told the waitress it was missing and she said she'll bring it right out. Before this happened, my loco came out. The patty which now was at 37 minutes in, was completely raw on the inside! We all asked waitress to have them cook it longer and also put the omelet under the heat lamp before that gets cold since STILL no sign of hash browns .. Waitress said 2 minutes more .. Salmon latke still waiting .. If it wasn't a fairly cold dish to start, it would have been. By this time, the couple who arrived 20 minutes after us, are eating their burgers and fries and another couple had arrived. In total, there were 7 diners in the entire place and we were STILL waiting.  Finally, the fiancé said he was hungry and the experience was ridiculous and suggested we leave.  I was so upset because I've always enjoyed Bachi Burger and thought my sis visiting from Hawaii would love it. Instead, we were all so disappointed by the service and nonchalant attitude of the server AND the manager!! We got up to leave and the server rushed over with our plates; 1 in each hand and said, ""but we are going to heavily discount your meal..."" At this time the manager was near the door and looked at all of us, and then walked outside??? Then, he walked back in, but NEVER came over to ask what the problem was.. He didn't even walk near us. He walked to the back of the restaurant and didn't come out again. P.S., the manager I am referring to is Joseph J., who claims to be a foodie that absolutely loves the smile he can put on people's faces after delivering exceptional food and service!  By the way, it is also his ""passion to exceed your expectations in every way."" Well, it must be your expectations because he batted 0 for 3 with us. It was like he consciously ran from the situation and had this horrible server make the situation worse. I actually remembered her from the last time, but she wasn't my server then .. We did ask her for something .. Again, the place was pretty dead .. I would estimate 8 people at the most.. We wanted to add to our order and our waitress wasn't to be seen ... So, we asked her and she said, ""well, I'm actually on my break.."" We could not believe she told us that when the restaurant was only open for 2 hours .. Why would you even take a break during peak brunch hours? While writing this, I still can't believe the manager and how he avoided the whole situation.. In any case, we left and won't be back. I am sad about this because as mentioned, I do like Bachi's food but 2 occasions now..

She was very sweet and offered to make another vegetarian option not on the menu (loved it). The server said they'd had a big to-go order of 17 burgers and there were three other tables, all six to eight tops in the dining room, which was clearly too much for the inadequate number of staff. I counted one server, seemingly newer because the poor kid seemed nervous, and one bar tender. Three working in the kitchen. Eventually another server showed up, but I think by that point the damage was done. I never saw anyone acting as a manager. One table called the cook out to the dining room and chewed her out for several minutes, which resulted in a big fight in the kitchen.

I watch as the appetizers arrived along with everyone else's food. I ordered a Waygu burger with bacon and cheese. I wonder everyone else's food in the restaurant arrived. My burger never came. When asked the waitress told me she had forgotten. Well too later cause everyone else was finishing up their meal. What a way to start the day. Endless to say the meal without my burger was $108. Pulled my card out to pay and was charged $208.  My missing burger cost me an extra $100?  Brought it to their attention and although there was only 10 tables seated  they got our bills mixed up. Maybe it just Vegas bad luck.  Should have gone with my gut and had a Big Mac and a smile. Never coming back. Better ways to drop a $100.",-vn3Rh2r-t-YeWIB45_dRw,0,0,1,BNC62OzYbtzC2bS3anwp8A

If we had the same food at that location as we did at the Rainbow & Russell we would never have had a 2nd visit. May 16th 2016 we visited the Rainbow & Russell location. Facebook just reminded me and I still had a bad taste from the experience so figured I should write. All our burgers were overcooked but one child's burger which was undercooked for how it was ordered. It took way longer for the food to arrive than the other location. It wasn't busy at all and that should have been our 1st hint. One group was wrapping up when we arrived and another showed up after we were already served...that's ALL the other customers. I will never go back to this location and I haven't been back to the other locations since then. This experience soured me for Bachi Burger...,O-cDycPDJRBZsKc1qmkzFw,0,0,2,-a_Bu-UzekKe_98sRoMteg

We tried this place when it first opened as a breakfast place, but also ate here for dinner a few times. I find the quality and taste of the food to be the same as the Bachi on Windmill. However, they are understaffed since they are not as busy as the Windmill location so the service is not the same. They usually have the wait staff act as hosts and buss tables too. We came for dinner once and waited quite awhile to get seated even though there were open tables, waited another while for our server to take our drinks and food orders.. BUT the waitress was super nice and friendly, we can see that she was busy doing a bunch of stuff at once, not like she stood around talking or was a bad waitress, she was just really busy. 

I don't mind the wait for the service at all, at least we get to sit and wait instead of standing like at the Windmill location. I love Bachi burger, my go to place for burgers.

Today was just bad. As a server myself I will not name names because I don't believe in hurting others' jobs. 

But I stopped in just now for a quick lunch and got one of my favorite burgers and asked for medium. 

Your normally juicy burger was way overcooked; it was well done. But I could've dealt with that. 

Here's where it gets bad. I literally had eaten 3/4 of the burger before the server even asked how I was enjoying it. I  was straight forward and said the burger was overcooked. The response ""sorry about that"" and they just walked away. 

So the follow-up on the food was way late and then no attempt was made to make it right. In fact, the next interaction was 1 minute later when the check was dropped.

I won't say I'll never be back because I can't fault Bachi for one bad experience. But talk about feeling like crap when you're only one of the three tables in the restaurant.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,0,0,3,jQGIVhO21ec2R3bk18_w1w

We started with the Brussel sprouts and the kale salad. Both were really great and filling. We probably could've ended our meal right then and there and been satisfied with not only the quantity but the flavor. The kale isn't bitter or overly earthy like you would expect. The dressing complements it very well and the cranberries are a sweet addition. 

We then got the oxtail fries that everyone was raving about. I expected it to be just oxtail in spices braised but it came out as a chili. The dish was too salty overall for me to truly enjoy it and I was really disappointed because it was a huge portion and we had to leave it. 

We ended with the shogun burger. This burger was so so. The first bite was really good but you can't really taste any of the components except for the eel. A bit pricy but I understand the ingredients warrant it.

The Russell location is one of the newer ones and the interior is super clean and super cool. With very nice and friendly staff that will accommodate anything you would like. My wife order the simple build your won burger and I got the Pork Belly Baos because I am a huge sucker for pork belly anything. We also ordered the Oxtail chili fries and a side of regular fries for my daughter. 

The food came out fairly quick which is a good thing when you have a terrible 2 year old and a fussy 7 month old. We shared the oxtail fries and both my wife and I loved it. Fries reminds me of McDonald's fries as far as look goes but tasted a million times better. The oxtail chili with beans was a nice touch with a slight tangy sweet flavor. My favorite part was the runny fried egg on top and the fresh jalapenos. These fries are worth calling my new obsession. The Pork Belly Baos came out on a long plate with 3 small but decent size baos. The bun was super soft and had great texture not to mention the perfectly sweeten flavor. The Pork belly ""the star of the show"" was tender, sweet and melts in your mouth. The thin layer of fat makes my mouth water just talking about it. With a tiny bit of veggies and a slice of hard boiled egg and no extra muss or fuss. These little things are so good on their own but to push it over the top they give you this amazing dipping hoisin sauce that is mind blowing. 

The Burger OMG the burger the grilling and the seasoning is ""perfection"" and the juicy tender patty with the right amount of chard is insanely good. Topped with melted cheddar and a side of the fixing this burger was tasty but, a bit pricy I think it was $16 or something without fries or anything else.

Always start with the oxtail chili cheese fries. A blend of shredded meat, chili, gooey cheese, peppers, and a fried egg atop a mountain of fries. On point!

They used to have a delicious burger for vegetarians. Apparently they got rid of that for some reason, and replaced it with a veggie sandwich. Really, a veggie sandwich?!? You're a burger restaurant, why would you make that switch? Fine, okay, whatever. I decided to try it and, uh...I don't know why they'd serve this thing to people. It tastes like charcoal. I tried a couple bites from a couple different sections of the sandwich, and then asked them to take this charcoal sandwich away. Definitely not a place for any vegetarians to come with friends anymore. Sad, because it used to be with the burger they got rid of.

As for the service...seems like they're understaffed. I'm hoping that's why our waitress was so unpleasant, but who can say. She didn't seem flustered, rushed, or anything like that.

Ordered Bone marrow; there was no freakin marrow! Couldn't even fill one piece of toast. It more like a jam that they mix with marrow then place into a bone. Complained about having nothing to put on our toast, so they gave us a small dish of marrow jam, which made up for it. But I won't order it again. I want Bone marrow, not the mix they made out of it.

I usually order Kiki Burger and this was not it. Totally left out gruyere cheese, garlic aioli, & caramelized jam. It was so dry! I was wondering why it was lacking. Looked at menu and noticed they left ingredients out! I didn't bother to complain about this because we complained about our other dishes.

Bachi Loco moco with Risotto. This is usually our fave. But the Risotto wasn't cooked! Who wants to eat hard ass rice! They forgot to give us the Sriracha jam which was needed because the flavor was lacking and rice was undercooked. Had to ask for that too. We did complain about the under cooked Risotto.

*General opinion*
Bachi Burger has a creative menu with a few GREAT items, and some items that have great potential but don't quite cut it.

What I love:
Ronin Burger
Miyagi-San Burger 

I definitely prefer the angus over the wagyu. Strangely, the wagyu is very lean while the angus is much juicer and more flavorful.

What I don't love:
-Oxtail Chili Fries. Sounds incredible, right? It had so much chili powder, that's all I could taste. Much too overpowering.
-Bone Marrow. They scrape the marrow out of the bone, mix it with the onion jam (?) and then put it back onto the bone. The jam has a nice flavor but that's really all I could taste. So in essence, it's just oily jam. Why go through the extra work when you can just serve the marrow in the bone with the jam on the side? 
I've tried several other dishes that were pretty good but not worth mentioning.

*Long rant*
While they have less great items than not-so-great items, the burgers I enjoy are what I keep coming back for. However, today might have been the LAST time. I'm am so thoroughly disappointed with the kitchen manager who was cooking today. The very sweet server brought my daughter's mini corn dogs out and I could see from across the room that they were overlooked. They were grayish brown with some black spots. I took a bite of one and sure enough, they were burnt to a crisp. It was so bitter with burnt taste with a charcoal-like texture. We sent it back but we couldn't have it replaced because that was the last of the mini corn dogs (btw we were the first customers of the day). Then my mother, husband, and I all started eating our burgers that we ordered medium. All 3 of us had hard, dry, beyond well-done patties. As in, the edges were burnt to a crisp and tough to chew. We kindly let our server know so she could inform her manager. Turns out, the kitchen manager was the one who was cooking. They did offer to replace them but we couldn't accept the offer because we had already been there a long time and our two toddlers wouldn't have made it another 20+ minutes. So we just ate what we could of the burnt burgers. I could only stomach 1/4 of it. My mom, half. Another sweet server came by and apologized and offered 10% off our bill. I appreciate the gesture, but 10%? Made me feel like my business doesn't matter to them. They recognized us as regulars, not some random people looking to complain and get discounts. Today, I'm ranked #1 for yelp check-ins at Bachi Burger. 10% was enough to comp one of our sodas. A much kinder gesture would have been an apology from the manager. Or maybe offer 25% off, or even just 25% off our next visit. Or a complimentary dessert. Or comp our 2 fountain sodas. Anything to make us feel like they still want us to come back. We were willing to put aside the fact that the cook HAD to know the food was burnt. It was very obvious, and a professional would definitely know. A professional would never have sent the food out that way, hoping the customer wouldn't notice. When I walked by the kitchen to the restroom there was an undeniable smell of burning food. But they didn't seem to care. So, we will likely never return.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,2,0,2,jdXfMK08ULHw3LvukCfYMQ

But an off-strip location that is a gem hidden from most tourists and also a local's favorite.

So we went to the original location on Windmill Lane and there was a long wait even on a late Sunday afternoon.  The hostess told us that they had a new location on Russell Road, about 10 minutes away, and there was no wait.  So off we went!

When we arrived there was indeed no wait - in fact the place was less than half full.  We were greeted by our server and was seated promptly.

The Kiki's burger was topped with a nice blend of sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, some exotic greens, bacon and cheese.  I opted for the ""no onion"" version, otherwise it would also have come with sweet caramelized onions.  A really yummy garlic chili aioli sauce was served on the side.

The sauce at first looked like some ordinary burger sauce.  But one taste and you'll discover that it's da bomb that complemented the burger perfectly.

The regular Bachi Burger was served with a generous portion of fresh lettuce and thick slices of tomatoes.  Again, we opted for no onions.

The beef patties for both burgers were cooked perfectly - charred on the outside and medium on the inside.  The quality of the beef was good.  The charred burger retained its juiciness, and it also gave the patty a slightly burnt ""crust"" which I really liked.

Saw this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives a few years ago, and recognized the chef, Lauren Watada.  I actually met him in college when i used to live in Hawaii and i used to be a waiter at one of the places that he was a cook under one of Hawaii's most famous chefs.  So i've been wanting to try Bachi Burger for some time and i made it a point to go this time i was in vegas.

The burgers are masterfully crafted with quality ingredients, angus or wagyu beef, and definitely has the Asian flair of Hawaii Regional Cuisine.  Ingredients like furikake, spicy miso, Kalbi, and ox tails scream of Asian or modern Hawaiian food.  His time spent with Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi are very evident in the entire menu.

I had a difficult time deciding what to get, since i was only here for 1 meal.  My server was very helpful in pointing out what was most popular as well as what was his favorite.  I went with his suggestion (favorite) the Spicy Miso burger.  It seemed the most out of the box and unique so i went with it.  It was great!  Meat done to a perfect medium (as requested) still juicy but nothing raw.  Shishito peppers, roasted garlic, a spicy miso sauce, a fried egg, green onions, onions, a fresh artisan bun, OMG, so good!  All the flavors of a spicy miso ramen but in burger form!  I could have done with out the red onions though, the server said to try it with fried onions next time to add a crunchy texture to it.

I asked another server about fries, and if he preferred the parmesan truffle fries or the salt n pepper fries.  He said that he liked the truffle fries.. I had in mind the salt and pepper fries because it comes topped with sliced jalapeños so its inspired by salt and pepper chicken wings or pork chops that you get in Chinese restaurants (at least that's my take on it.)  But the other sever said that he liked the truffle fries, so i went with that recommendation.

The truffle fries were too strong a favor for me.  I know most people would probably prefer this stronger truffle taste but it was too earthy for me.  it also came with a tomato aioli which i wasn't too crazy about, not bad by any means but i think i'd prefer ranch or something.  Should have stuck to my guns on this one and gotten the salt and pepper fries.

I also wanted to try their short rib loco moco, braised short ribs on top of risotto topped with an egg, Ox tail fries, and the Miyagi San Burger, but that will have to wait till next time I'm in Vegas.

Service was very friendly, helpful, and easy to talk to, the place was not busy (off hours) the food did take a bit longer to come out of the kitchen but, i understand that everything is made to order and there are a lot of little things that go into making each burger what it is.  Definitely worth the wait!  I think Bachi burger could easily be featured in one of the major casinos on the strip and compete with other upscale burgers.

As for the name, Bachi it's short for Hibachi (Japanese for an open flame grill) or a warning of bad karma (a reminder to treat people with respect and kindness) quite clever.",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,4,4,4,HoPR3eYS5P1wnFBaZLhu8g

There is a nice size bar area with seating and you can also see the chefs in the kitchen preparing your food through a glass window.

There seemed to only be one server for the entire restaurant.  Although there were many tables seated, she was very patient and kept her cool.

We ordered the following:
*  Oxtail chili cheese fries ($11) :  A must try!  I order this every time I come here.
*  Bone Marrow Jam ($10):  Sooo good!  This plate came with one bone and 4 small pieces of toasted bread.  I honestly wish the portion was twice as much.  
*  Da North Shore Shrimp Truck ($11):  I think there were 5-6 shrimps.  It was good, but I wouldn't order it again for that price.  
*  Miyagi-san burger:  I've ordered this a few times before.  It's one of my favs!
*  Thai iced tea:  I've had thai tea many times before at many different places.  This was okay.  It was way too watered down to me.

My only negative:  The restroom was dirty and trash needed to be emptied.

It was 15 minutes from when I finished my food to when I was offered the check. After I had been served,  no one followed up, and my drink wasn't refilled.

I started with a pomegranite ginger soda. Awesome and refreshing! It was killer hot out that day so it was a perfect drink. 

Then we moved on the the oxtail fries. Now I had read o. Yelp that they were a definite must. The pictures looked amazing so we couldn't go and not try it. Glad we did! 

I had the roast duck bao sandwhiches. Another dish I ordered from a picture lol. It was definitely different but one of those pleasant surprises. The duck mixed with the sauce they serve on the side was delicious!!!

Also tried the poke and bone marrow jam. Poke was good, nice chunky portions of fish. The bone marrow is a unique dish, not really seen in many restaurants so my curiosity got the best of me. It had a strong flavor, one that you might need to get used to.

The thing holding this location back is the staff. We were seated promptly among the other FOUR guests in the restaurant. Six total customers. There were about a dozen staff members there, at least 10 on the clock. At least 5 minutes after we were seated someone finally came to our table and brought us water. Then a few minutes later the server arrived. Slow. Very SLOW! After the server finally made contact with us, things got better. She was a nice gal and paid good attention to us. The Parmesan fries were nice, but whatever sauce the put on them made those fries it touched, cold. Hmmm. The burgers were OUT OF THIS WORLD! 5 star burgers, 2 star staff so I'm gonna say 4 overall. That's probably generous, but I will go to Bachi again, maybe on the east side next time. The food is worth going back.

Everyone I know says they never have any service issues at the Windmill location, and I usually go to the Sahara one, but this one is the closest to me. I admit I keep going back to the Sahara location in hopes that one day they will improve their service, because their food is so darn good. But no.

2352029,2015-09-13,3,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Let's begin with look at my damn pictures! This place is on point with presentation. I feel its casual up scale dining. But getting back to the beginning..

Walking in this place is large and gorgeous. Lots of space, modern decor and a type of kitchen view in which you can almost watch the cooks prepare your food. I am impressed with this because then I feel as if they are not hiding anything. I decided to sit at the bar.

My server was Naomi who serving me at the bar. They had sports on and also another criminal investigative show which was really interesting. There was another server Carla who would drop by to ask how my meal was and if I needed anything. It was nice to have such prompt servers who cared how my meal was and if I was content. Naomi recommended their homemade pomegranate soda. Very refreshing, not too sweet.

Let's start with my favorite dish to compare to the many I've had from other restaurants.. Calamari. Light fry coating. Perfect. I can't stand when the calamari is greasy, it's seafood and supposed to be light. Calamari wasn't fishy, and it was paired perfectly with mint, tomato julienne, lemon to garnish and their tangy sauce. You had to really get all three in one bite to capture the flavor. 

Ultimately I decided to go with something outside of my comfort zone. Be different. Be unique. My choice? Brussel sprouts. YUCK! But your not going to believe it.... these brussel sprouts were to dye for. BEST BRUSSEL SPROUTS EVER. did I really just say that? YES. They had this delicious sweet sauce, bacon and pears. What a combination. my mind was blown, sweet and salty. Please go try those. I will come back just to get my brussel sprout fix. 

Next I choose the mushroom fries.. I cant remember their exact name but it was just as delicious as the sprouts. I'm not a mushroom fan but the waitress recommended them, so why not. I asked for ti on the side as a safety precaution. It was very rich mushroom but not the type of mushroom flavor I was expecting. I found myself constantly dipping them. I saw on the menu they had a homemade pineapple ketchup so I asked for a side of that as well. Sssh, don't rat me out but I ended up taking that home because it was the best ketchup ever. I'm going to have to find a way to recreate it.

Lastly I went with another third item out of my comfort zone... fish sandwich. Side note, I'm not a fan of lots of onions so when it came to my bar spot I almost dyed. I kept thinking of my breath and the fact I wouldn't be able to kiss my boyfriend for days. Carla reassured me that the onions had a mild taste because they soak them. Well, they hadn't done me wrong yet so in I dived in the fish. Whoa! She was right, the onions were mild, yet crunchy.. gave it an amazing texture. The fish had a sweet but tangy sauce on it and really pulled it together. I've had fish at other restaurants in which once you bite into it, the fish falls to pieces. Not this one. This fish was a champ and determined to not disappoint. 

Lastly, the portions are ginormous, I couldn't finish everything. I almost felt like letting the waitresses know I felt they were too big. Like, I the customer was ripping off the restaurant for the size of food I was receiving. Great prices for what you get. I walked out like a bloated whale and almost had to unzip my pants. I probably would have but my shirt was too short so I had to suck it up. Next time I shall order less and get dessert.

It was so good. The meat was so moist and the cheese itself was the perfect touch. We also had fries with a very good and unique ketchup that came with pineapple in it. Made it extra sweet. The other fries came with truffle oil and were so good too. My friend ordered a burger with bbq sauce, bacon and onion rings that I tasted too and everything was really good. One thing I didn't like was the sangria. It was very bitter and I asked them to put some 7up in it to sweeten it up and it was a lot better after that.

2375326,2017-08-12,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,I'm so sorry for this one. From beginning to end I just wasn't impressed. Walking in we was greeted by an older gentleman who asked us to wait (politely) while he cleaned the table we would be sitting at. While we were waiting another younger gentleman came over to assist with seating and was pretty much asked to go away by the older gentleman. We were seated and told someone would be right with us and about 15 minutes later we were finally greeted at our table. We placed our order and the fries were brought out about 10 minutes before our burgers. So of course being hungry we eat the fries first until the burgers come and then eat our burgers as well. When we were almost done my lady placed her plate aside so she could look something up on her phone and she was asked if she was done with her food with a hand pointing at the plate in question literally about an inch or 2 away from the food. That alone was just gross to me because you can ask without touching anything. Overall the food was ok but I can admit that there were many distractions so I could have just not been focused on enjoying my meal. There was a lot of food delivery services in and out and a bit of frustration with the lack of good customer service. I probably won't be back but I'm glad I tried it.,QumfaCySHpyxVfpKnWzQaA,0,0,3,ynLCgABwlU8gUYC3JYcGdg

We arrived there and was greeted by the head waitress with a ""be right with you"" which was fine but there were many open tables and booths we could just seat ourselves but ok whatever. Then no one came to seat us...it's like what's going on? U got 4 peeps just like totally ignoring the door! She tells one of them to go get seat us. Finally get seated no utensils on the table...thought they were going to bring it later...never did. Just stole some from Neighboring table. Finally get the order in...tell her to bring truffle fries first and kids meal. Says ok walks away. After that...we were invisible. There were like 6 groups of peeps total in the restaurant. We sat there with no attention from the waitress not even a glance over or a lemme check on your food. We wait like a good 30 mins. Finally we gotta flag down our waitress. Then she says lemme check on your order. 5 mins later food comes out...Luke warm. Waitress was like im sorry the cooks lost your ticket and didnt know who to serve the fries to. So basically shes blaming the kitchen for messing up our experience and not getting us our order. Last i checked in EVERY FKN restaurant i been to...the waitstaff deliver the food. So how the FCK is it the Cooks fault? My wife is pissed asks for compensation for our terrible experience. The waitress comes back with a $4 discount on a $40 bill. HAHA. 

Items forgetten: Kids meal milk, kids sundae (ran out of chocolate) if these items are of MINIMAL importance to your restaurant....don't serve kids meals! It may mean NOTHING to your staff but to basically deny A CHILD of their order is the absolute WORST thing you could do! 

Terrible experience and not a great way to rep Hawaii in vegas. Maybe u need to hire some local 808 waitstaff or some peeps that just plain Give a shit about working in your establishment.

I HOPE the owner reads this post because if your business is to succeed you better look into this matter. Pitiful excuses and the blame game doesn't go too far with diners and burger joints are a dime a dozen in Vegas. Also, my 2 year old daughter left hungry.

I ordered the Kiki burger. There was two mushrooms and it was missing the cheese. 

My sister ordered a cyo with cheddar and lettuce. It came out just like that. I guess it wasn't to basic to mess up lol. 

The service was sluggish and felt like we were a burden being 3 or 7 people currently being served. No water refills or napkins were offered to us.

As usual I ordered up some appetizers and tackled a burger I haven't tried yet. The chili n garlic fried chicken wings were awesome. Not too moist with the chili and perfectly crispy. The bone marrow with oxtail was some of the best I've had in a while and no words to describe the deliciousness of the oxtail chili cheese fries...this dish is always a must during a Bachi visit. 

Last up was the spicy miso burger. This burger was more on the savory side in comparison to other burgers I've tried here. This isn't a bad thing because the burger was great. Still by far the Miyagi-San is my favorite burger here.

I see breakfast is served now so can't wait to pay a morning visit. Great food!

But dang it, I just really wanted a good burger. I'll make up for it. Jillian Michaels is gonna kick my butt but it was worth it. 

We were in for a tasty treat. We started out with the Bachi pickle plate. Consisted of a variety of pickled veggies. Not something we'd normally order but it was tasty, fun and a nice start for the palate. Eye appeal. 
I had the Kiki's burger and hubby had the Miyagi-San. Both medium. Both delicious, cooked to perfection and loaded with flavor. I didn't need the side sauce. I dipped some of mine in hubby's burger drippings lol. Holy cow. So good. I could only eat half of mine. We split the Salt & Pepper fries topped with fresh jalapeños and cilantro. And I think shredded ginger maybe? Tasty and salty. Dipping sauce was good, but again, I almost didn't need it. Finished off the salty meal with a salted caramel shake topped with roasted marshmallow. Wow. I could only have a few sips. We decided we'll be splitting a burger next time since we want to try the oxtail fries and the 'seasonal warm bread pudding' with butter cream ice cream (or something like that) and bourbon sauce. Hope the bread pudding is still there by the time we come back. Yeah we'll be back .. after several hard workouts and a bit of lean, clean eating that's for sure. I also want to try the Caesar salad and a few other things that stood out on the menu. 

Service was perfect. Cool waiter. Not over the top, yet attentive. Nice atmosphere. Pleasant experience with good energy. Great location. Easy to get in and out. Went right around 6:00.

1. I am impressed by how they maintained the quality of the food across all branches - kudos to the chefs!
2.  It does not get as crowded as the one on Windmill and Bermuda. 
3. The interior is modern looking and well-lit compared to the other two locations. 

My favorite burger here is the Miyagi-san. I tried the other ones but I always come back to this one.  It's a juicy burger with crispy fried onion rings and fried egg with furikake seasoning. This one is just amazing. It's a perfect balance of crispy and savory flavors. The sweetness of the sauce is balanced out by the saltiness of the onion rings. Perfect marriage of food!

I also love that they have the blackberry cider here. This one is such a rare find. It used to be called Fox Barrel but now it's called Crispin. It's my favorite cider and this is the only restaurant I know that serves them. Also, you must order the truffle parmesan fries. It's perfect every time. 

The service at this branch can use some improvement. We dined here one time (Saturday for brunch) and we had to wait for our food for over an hour. We were later informed that someone in the kitchen was in training so the food took a little longer than usual. Our food still came out perfect so I had no complaint.

Then a few minutes later they didn't have roasted tomato for my omelette and suggested peppers instead. Why peppers? After around 35 minutes or more the food began to arrive. The smoked salmon latke looked great and taste good too. The steak burger which is what we replaced for the short ribs on the loco moco was rare in the middle. We ordered it medium. The omelette served was still waiting for the hash browns. I prompted the server to put the omelette in the hot window so it wouldn't get cold. So now two of us don't have food and the one meal we do have is not being eating out of curiosity. Now no manager ever visited our table.

I struggled on deciding what to get, either pork belly steamed buns or the Banh Mi burger. Luckily our server was very helpful and made some recommendations. I went with the Banh Mi and it was great! 

The only thing I had a problem with was the service. They were very understaffed for the amount of people walking in the door.",ugoUeWfb0uV64mBkGZ9znA,1,0,4,qtW1pNZ6Jy0KFczwW14Zvw

We all ordered burgers and the food is consistently good in all locations. I had the myagi wagyu burger which had Carmelites bacon, spicy mayo, and fried onion rings. Very juicy and flavorful. First time trying this burger and was not disappointed at all. The cilantro garlic fries are a must but my husband and I forgot how large the order is and ended up sharing one while the other day untouched. I wish the server would tell you it is large enough to share. 

After the meal I asked the server to put some candles on the cake and she brought it out lit much to my brother's horror, he hates they kind of thing.

We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and loved it. The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because we ordered a shake to come with the food and it took forever to come out. Our server (or should I say the only server) asked us specifically if we wanted our shake to come out before the food or after and we told her before; it ended up coming out after. We were one of maybe 4 tables there at that time so I'm not sure why it took so long for a drink to come out. The wait for the food took awhile and I was excited to have a few sips of my milkshake while we waited. It was fine though because we treated it as a dessert after our meal.

Fries were very good. Truffle fries were only as good as the porcini sauce it comes with. Brussel sprouts were not bad and a welcome change from the rest of the grease-laden food there.

The bleu cheese, bacon, and mushrooms played nicely with each other.  I was thinking about building my own burger, but for my first visit, I thought it was a safer choice to go with something that their chefs created, which is what I recommend you do as well, if you're a first timer.  The Peking Duck Bao's were awesome as well.  The Bao was so soft and fluffy, and the sweet hoisin-like sauce was perfect with them.  I saved the Ox Tail Chili Fries for last, as they were the most surprising to me.  I expected everything to be great here, but these awesome fries had me feeling some type of way!  Keep in mind, I had already devoured my big burger, and had some Duck Bao's, and I couldn't stop eating the Ox Tail Chili Fries.  The Ox Tail meat is shredded and mixed into the chili, which has a semi-sweet flavor.

Ronin Burger, I mean this one is a Bachi classic. It has a fried egg in it FYI!! Its delicious. Order it if its your first time here.

Black and Green Burger, this was the first time i tried this one. What drew me to it was the bacon and the blue cheese.

My Kiki burger was over cooked and I wasn't really feeling it. Truffle fries were okay. Matcha green tea was watered down :( The signature burger was bomb and wish I got that instead.

Overall, service could be better. Tables were left with leftover food for too long. Some people didn't even finish their food, mostly noticed the oxtail fries. It could have been in relation to the wait, not entirely sure, but it was lowkey alarming why so much food was left over.

3911033,2015-07-13,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Almost got 5 stars but my bun was burnt, they didn't put the beer battered onions on my burger and I couldn't get a glass of water or another drink. 

Decor: modern. The seating is made of light wood. The floor is painted concrete. Middle strip of the ceiling has flowers panted on the rest of the ceiling is open industrial ducts. We saw two paintings/artwork on the walls. I only really noticed them because I read on here that they have local art on the walls for sale. Unless you were told about them you wouldn't know to look. 

Service: room for improvement. When seated the hostess placed down the drink menu and and two menus for each of us. One was the lunch/dinner menu and the other was breakfast. The breakfast menu said available until 11am. It was 12:30pm so we couldn't understand why she still passed those out. Talk about a teaser. We had two different servers come up and ask our drink order blonde white lady and brunette Asian guy. Seems like they work each other's tables or they are confused since both said they would be our server. They never came up for beverage refills. And I really was thirsty. My friend ordered water with lemon and I ordered Thai tea which I wanted another one of or at least a glass of water. 

Food: Thai tea too much milk not enough tea. I never thought I would ever have a bad Thai iced tea but this one wasn't made right. Not a biggie but still it was a hot day and I was thirsty. The oxtail chilly cheese fries spicy yummy goodness! Get these fries!!! Pricey I think they were $13. There is a sunny side up egg on top. Fresh jalapeños mixed in the chilly topped with with some cilantro. The burgers DO NOT COME WITH ANY SIDES so I got just fries that came with a side of pineapple ketchup. This ketchup was amazing!!!! And I am not a fan of ketchup. But it was so sweet and thick because of the crushed pineapple. It gave ketchup a tropical feel. I loved it. The pork belly buns are delicious! You don't expect them to be like little slider sandwiches with a slaw inside and teriyaki sauce on the side. There are only three of them so get something on the side of you are a big eater. I ordered the lonely bird without tomatoes. Now the lonely bird is under sandwiches not burgers but it is a burger. It's ground chicken and turkey molded into a burger patty topped with brown ale batter onion rings, tomato, mixed greens in a grilled bro he bun with pesto sauce on the side. The onion rings on it made me decide on it and guess what was not on it.... The onion rings!!! I was so happy when I saw the bun. I cut it in half and took a bite and noticed the bun was a bit crispy but the party was soon flavorful and good. Halfway through I notice the rest of the bun was burnt and remembered they didn't put the onion rings on it!!! 

By that time I had finished my tea my friend was out of water. She came with the check and went to take our chilly fries away. I said I wanted to take them home. So she left the plate asked if we wanted dessert. We really were thirsty but no use sitting there downing water so we left and hit up a gas station for our water fix.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,3,2,3,9YLRocqlfHIm4SvGuGXlEQ

Before I come to this location, I've been to bachi burger once, I don't have too much memories of my last experience, but this one is just fantastic.

When I enter with my boyfriend the waiter greeted us politely. And later on turned out he was so attentive (checking on us every 5 minutes, which feels a little bit weird but I know he's doing it out of care)

We ordered the shogun burger, which was sooooo amazing! I usually hate burgers due to their greasy taste but after having this one I just can't help but craving for it all the time!

Have consumed many burgers in this town and the burgers here are by far the best in Vegas. Just tried the chili cheese oxtail fries. A giant portion that easily feeds two people. Great flavors with salt being the dominant flavor. Ended the meal with the dessert that is made just at this location, bread pudding. The bread pudding tastes like it is made from a banana nut bread which in itself is excellent. Add on a bourbon glaze and you have perfection. Get an extra side of the bourbon glaze to appease your sweet tooth. For a drink I tried the green tea which stood up to its name. It was greener than a spinach and spirulina smoothie. By far the strongest green tea I have ever had. All and all I will stick with my favor burger, the Ronin burger.

3977819,2015-04-16,8,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"I finally got my first taste of a Bachi burger, and I am happy to announce that I was quite please with my burger and fries. I ordered the Black and Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, fresh Spinach Bacon
Point Reyes Blue Cheese which I replaces with Gruyere, and Roasted Garlic for $16 with a side of salt and pepper french fries, and I can't for get the ice cold Sapporo's!

I asked for a medium rare temp, and I was very pleased they were able to deliver on the mark. The beef was very moist and tender, however its flavor was milder than what I expected. It was very good, but instead of providing that beefy flavor that lingers on the palate, it provided a milder light buttery flavor. 

The sauteed mushroom was tender to the touch, well seasoned, and tasted great. The bacon was crispy, very flavorful, with a bit of a chew, which I rather enjoy. The fresh spinach was abundant and well stacked on the burger. I got to give them credit, this was a very neat and nicely stacked burger. Also, the bun was very nice with its moist texture and glistening top. 

The fries were very good, but the should of been a little more crispier. I enjoyed their flavor and felt the salt and pepper seasoning was spot on. Also, the garnish of freshly sliced jalapenos and herbs was quite good and a nice touch.

Service was good, but I felt it could of been a little more attentive, and those ice cold Sapporos were just great and made the Black and Green taste that much greater.",WG3w_73scm_JUWJ_3Lgn0Q,16,10,4,uLINM-b8p-8LLOfWCCHwHg
3992681,2016-09-11,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"I had a bad first impression of this place because of the service. The first time I came here with a friend, it was early afternoon on a weekday and it wasn't that busy. We were immediately seated and able to put our order in quickly too. However, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food to come out. I wish that was an exaggeration, but sadly, it's not. And it was disappointing because it wasn't a big order...it was just my friend's salad and my burger. And we were surrounded by a table of 8 and also a table of 5 who were seated AFTER us but they got their food BEFORE us. Water refills were almost impossible to get as well. I was hungry and upset about the service...I considered walking out before my food got there and never coming back. 

But when my Miyagi San's finally got there and I took a bite...the flavors were just too good. I knew that I would have to be back. The burger was cooked perfectly, the bun didn't get soggy (which is an annoying trait that most burger places have), the flavors were different but in a good way. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.

I've been back to this location a few times since then and I've been to another location as well and I didn't have a problem with the service. I don't know why the first time was so terrible.",2j1LhP97p3CtaA11oP5X4w,0,0,3,ac-qPeacZ8Il1HbjIcq0mw

4108220,2016-01-24,5,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"They might not be all-in on the ""Healthy Life"" concept anymore, but they still serve some great breakfast here.

Formerly branded as Bachi HLK and now featuring a prominent Bachi Burger sign on their facade, this location is referred to by the name ""Bachi Kitchen"" on their web site. Whatever it's really called, it's definitely still worthy of bearing the Bachi banner.

Note: I didn't order any burgers here last time because they barely offered any, with most of the offerings oriented toward brunch. I didn't try any burgers this time either. Even though they have their standard burger menu here,  I could just get the burgers (my favorite in town still, by the way) at their original Windmill location. That drive is significantly shorter for me.

They've pared down their breakfast offerings significantly since they first launched, and the detested green tea crepes (more on that if you can dig up my Bachi HLK review somehow) were no longer present. Sadly, the Country Hash was also gone, but they still have some appetizers, pancakes, several egg dishes, and a few kid meals. Presumably they've kept these because they're the best offerings, so I was pretty optimistic.

Well, that positivity was definitely warranted. I started off with the Short Rib Benedict ($15) with hash browns (rather than fingerling potatoes). Disregard all my older reviews - this short rib is actually the best that I have had in town. It was tender, pink inside, and _not_ puzzlingly salt-deficient. That's an issue that I've tasted time and again, but I didn't experience it today. Instead, the taste brought back old but very pleasant memories of savory beef, which I'm surprised that I could've ever forgotten.

That short rib alone makes the dish my favorite eggs benedict yet, but I enjoyed the bearnaise sauce and the perfectly poached eggs too. The hash browns were relatively mundane, though they were certainly crispy, plentiful and well-seasoned, and the greens were lightly dressed and fresh. Actually, the red onions were a little stringy in texture, but I appreciated their flavor contribution.

I also had the Almond Brioche French Toast ($11.50, although the menu said $11), which was quite good as well. The toast was dusted with powdered sugar. While it wasn't too crispy, it definitely wasn't soggy. The raspberry puree, mixed berry compote, and banana were all nice touches. The maple syrup and the thick coconut syrup (served warm for a reason) were a bit annoying to pour from the dispensers, but they both paired well with the dish. The server was nice enough to give me small plastic containers for these sauces (I had leftovers, sadly).

No changes to the decor as far as I could see, with lots of lighter colored woods used for the seats and tables. They also have a bar with plenty of liquor on display, which would not have been the best call for me at 10:30-ish a.m. before a meeting with a prospective employer.

Admittedly, the sample size is smaller, but I feel that this Kitchen is serving food that's at least as good as, if not better than the new breakfast hotspots in Henderson. If you're a fan of Bachi, take the time to try their breakfast concept. If not, we'll have to agree to disagree on their burgers, and try the breakfast menu anyway.

[QUICK UPDATE 4/20/16: Ronin burger and oxtail chili cheese fries were both on point. So yeah, this truly is Bachi Burger but with breakfast.]",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,11,5,V48HzTyVt1HH_o6-UTsc-w

We always liked Bachi Burgers  but the visit in this particular  branch is quite disappointing. 

We started with truffle fries which was very good and crispy. The flavor of the truffle comes through. It's an all time favorite. 

Grilled kurobota sausages were juicy and tender and comes with honey mustard dipping sauce. 

My little one got the grilled cheese with bacon and egg sandwich which was pretty good but the apple slices that come with it were inedible like it has been soaked in some type of un identified nasty solution. 

I got the Shogun burger with unagi and foie gras - the burger itself was cooked well and juicy, but somehow the combination with the unagi does not work. The unagi was not fresh, overly sweet, dry and has an unpleasant fishy taste leaving a weird after taste. For a $26 burger, at least make it decent enough to eat. That was such a disappointment.  

Hubby got the Miyagi Burger which he really liked. Fried onion burger toppings although greasy were crispy. 

The GOOD:
Pineapple ketchup is our favorite, love it with the fries. 
Truffle fries were always a hit. 
The BAD & UGLY: 
Service is so-so. It does take a long while before they take your orders. 
Apple that goes with kid's meal tastes weird.

I also always get the truffle fries, which are so so so amazing. The service is fairly speedy, everyone is friendly, and i enjoy coming here often to eat. 
There is a bit of a downside, however. It seems there is usually a *minor* problem each time we come to visit. For example, i asked for a well-done burger and i get a rare burger. Or i ask if we can split the check between two people and they forget to do it. When i ask them to correct it, we verify what i've bought and what my friend bought and they still manage to mess it up.

This the only Bachi location serving breakfast, from 9am to 12 noon. Bachi Burgers are insanely delicious, so Monkey eager to try this again, even though menu has been significantly reduced. No more Taro Pancakes- Boo!!!

Monkey do:

Organic Sumatra Coffee
SHORT RIB LOCO MOCO over risotto(instead of kimchi fried rice), grilled onions, gravy aside
BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST- dipped in coconut almond custard, mixed berry compote, maple & coconut syrup

Awesome SRLM to hold Monkey for a long day. Gravy too salty for Monkey taste, but I know some like it like that. French toast is toasty, dry bread with jam. Menu say banana, but I don't see?  It's okay.  Ate it the next day. Grub!

Clean restaurant with several booths and tables for larger parties. Parking lot is shared, free and dirty. Service is friendly, smiley and helpful when you just can't decide. Slightly pricey, but plates are shareable. Monkey will definitely return for that short rib and try pancakes!",hjou4Tcftqgd2peMPECmeA,2,2,4,aeAF382xtX2Rq5aqpXo1GA
4332695,2015-06-13,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"After eating at The Noodle Man, I decided my tastebuds weren't fulfilled in culinary delight, with that being said we decided to go to Bachi Burger down the street since this new location just recently opened up (I've been to the Henderson location and Summerlin).

The restaurant is hard to miss if you aren't looking hard for it while driving on Russell. When we walked in there was no one there and we were sat immediately and given menus. The menu is not any different from the other locations except I found something new- ""Happy Hour""! Great, we were just in time for this treat. $6 appetizers and 50% off appetizers that were under $6, $6 speciality drinks and $5 draft beers. So we ordered:

Bachi Pickles- My friend ordered this and loved it. I do not really like pickled dishes although it was an assortment of colorful veggies that were just... pickled. 

Fried Chili Chicken Wings- Okay so since I have been to all of the locations in Las Vegas (there are newly opened restaurants in LA now; they've gone corporate), the overall food flavoring is very SWEET, this includes the chicken wings, the wings were fried very well but the taste was a sweet flavoring, close to the liking of.. think orange chicken from panda express. It was good if you like the taste of sweetness. The plating was great with scallions and sesame seeds. 

Oxtail Cheese Fries- Again, the sweetness! I would have loved this dish if it tasted more like pho broth and oxtail pho sauce than a sweet BBQ taste. Overall I liked this dish because... well who doesn't like chill cheese fries.

 Ahi Poke- Even though this was in the appetizer list it unfortunately did not get any of the happy hour discounts. Great pieces of sashimi grade tuna but was decent with flavoring, I would try Hawaiian Style Poke restaurant if you have a hankering for poke instead. 

We decided on seasonal strawberry/mango sangrias and the Japanese cucumber/ginger mojito, both were very delicious but a little watered down and couldn't taste the flavor of some of the key ingredients listed in the drink.

Overall, it is just like the other locations. Service was prompt and inviting would go back only because the service was beyond par and happy hour isn't too shabby either! :)",14vrA4FwKqzcqoNt6MdXHg,1,1,3,ZFcNXWdnFvh49JLDbCiVxQ

After reading the reviews my friends and I decided to start with the overrated oxtail chili cheese fries. For the first couple of bites it was pretty good but after that it became overwhelming. The chili began to taste a lot like bbq sauce. It was REALLY SWEET but also salty at the same time. The oxtail meat was also dry. 

The burgers tho... The medium rare is more on the rare side but I'm not complaining. I got the KiKi's Burger and it was delicious. Although it wasn't waygu (whatever), the meat was really juicy and tasty but also very oily. 

I also tried my friend's Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and damn you can really taste the difference in the beef! I recommend you try the wagyu beef if you haven't. This burger was also oily and definitely on the messier side.",u4xlkK0im1hNqhsoy4Jphg,4,3,4,EneuHkSX1F6ITWJ5-mavDQ

We also got an order of pork belly buns, but we didn't like it. It was way too thick and fatty. We may have been better off with the peking duck buns.

4411678,2015-07-21,2,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"I came here a a few months ago and it was closer to a 4 star place. The burgers were good and service was friendly and relaxed. The first time I had their Bachi fish burger, I was so impressed I went twice in one weekend, even if the 2nd time wasn't as good as the first. 

I don't know what happened... When we went this past Friday evening, everything was terrible from the service to the food. It wasn't that busy, but somehow no one even bothered to get us water or take our order for more than 10 minutes. The food took forever to come and when it did come, it was unforgivably bad. I ordered the fish burger but it did not even resemble the fish burger I used to crave. The burger pretty much fell apart right on my plate because they just mindlessly piled up the ingredients between two pieces of bun. The fish fillet tasted lukewarm and rubbery with a watery sauce that made the bun soggy. The lettuce inside the burger fell out in a clump as soon as I tried to hold the burger and take a bite, at which point it became more of a tasteless salad without any dressing. I left the clump of ""salad"" alone while I picked through the fish and the soggy bun with a fork. 

I can forgive bad service, but I can't forgive terrible food, and unfortunately this place is only as good as whoever is in the kitchen. One star for the clean decor and memories of once awesome burgers.",ZKwO9lkpAnOnQlBL1fXf1w,1,1,1,YPf6bPO_g5QYYixfWv16nQ

ordered the bone marrow appetizer, was pretty good, came with foie gras butter, YUM
could have used a couple extra pieces of toast though.....definitely would order again

friend had ronin burger...sorry, I think that was it, was good, nothing memorable
I chose the bachi fish sandwich....SCORE!!!
I really enjoyed this, as it was pan seared, not fried
my friend tried and that's probably what made her burger secondary
really guys, well worth a try, unless you do not like fish

It was also connected to a Ramen restaurant, so we weren't sure which one people were waiting for.  We headed to the Russell location, and this one was half empty!  Not sure why, but we were happy!  Turns out I came here before for bunch when it was known as Bachi Healthy Life.  I guess they converted it back to a Bachi Burger, though the interior looked the same.

Two friends were not impressed with their burgers - one found it way too sweet.  She had ordered the Bahn Mi Burger and didn't like all the sweet sauce (which is found on all their burgers, I think).  My other friend got some special burger with foie gras, which wasn't very good either.  I think her burger was $20-30!  Yikes.  A third friend go the Kimchi burger, which she enjoyed. I got the Ronin Burger, which I liked.  I like their burgers bc I do like sweet food, so if you're not a fan, you might want to skip this place.  Oh, order the onion rings - they are really good.  I'm not usually a fan of onion rings, but these were made with the lightest and crispiest batter (similar to a light tempura batter) - they were really good!  The Parmesan and Garlic fries were thing and crisp, too.  Their drinks were also good.  A friend got some non-alcoholic peach drink that was delicious!

Once we finished our food it took about 10 minutes to have our plates cleared and another 25 to ask for a to go box! AND THEN another 15 to get our check!

Didn't really care for the loco moco. I like my loco mocos simple and not overly dramatic with fancy ingredients, which some places tend to serve. The jasmine rice they serve it with is like mush and when you eat it with the meat, it's too mushy. I see why they throw in some onion rings.

I tried the Portuguese donuts... and it's nothing like malasadas. They are deep fried donut balls served on a smear of fresh berry jelly (I think it was strawberry). The bread was overcooked on the outside and almost raw on the inside. I wouldn't try it again even if it was cooked better.

This location is nice and clean with somewhat of a hipster vibe. I have one gripe and it's the finish they use on the tables. I know it's for waterproofing the wood, but I find it too sticky at times and sometimes the napkins get stuck. It just reminds me of a soiled, sticky, poorly cleaned table.

The window where I could see what food was coming out was pretty cool. It was a different kind of environment then I have ever been to.

I was seated immediately and given many choices and recommendations to choose from. I had never been there and wanted to know what the servers recommended.  They were educated and well trained in the menu. I ended up getting the Miyagi Burger, and the truffle parmesean fries. 

The food came out within 15 minutes and not just saying this but it was the most amazing burger and fries I have ever had. Not like what you would get anywhere else. The servers came over many times asking if everything was ok. Which was a change to most sit down restaurants. 

I highly recommend it to anyone.",jtmipiz6F_ShWWF9f30oiA,0,0,5,p7GCGjdgkPFURPRJpj29yg

4995894,2015-01-05,1,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Meh. I liked the idea and concept, but it was poorly executed. Service was impeccable. Our server Ray was attentive, and very helpful with suggestions. 

Miyagi San- The Wagyu patty was cooked perfectly. The bun was nice and soft. The onion rings were soggy/oily. All the flavors went together beautifully, but the flavor profile was just TOO SWEET. They put way too much furikake for my liking. A heaping amount of furikake paired with the glaze on the patty made the amount of sweetness overbearing. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- DELICIOUS!! ...but again, TOO SWEET! The chili was too sweet and overpowered the oxtail. They used the sweet white beans like you see in Pork & Beans, and I think that just threw the whole dish off. They could have balanced the flavors better by chopping up the jalapeños and cilantro so all the flavors can come together in each bite. 

Overall, it was nice to try, but I don't see myself coming back. I will stick to Umami Burger and Fuku Burger. Yelp has failed me, yet again.",nJxXW3Mq0T_0dWQv6oBOFA,3,2,3,Q0oYZvTuTFZd4QP2txMw4g

Bachi burger is a fusion gourmet burger restaurant that also serves breakfast all day. They charge $$ for a burger because their meats are better in quality: ribeye angus and wagyu.  But beef is beef when it's all ground up. I certainly didn't taste the difference. My friend ordered medium rare, another friend medium and I ordered it cooked medium well. When they came out all of them was medium well so it's not like they do a great job of cooking it to your preference. 

I got the spicy miso burger and my friend got the Kiki burger. Yes our burgers were juicy and relatively decent sized but it's really not worth the price. The ingredients in my burger.. Miso paste, gochugang, egg, lettuce, didn't really seem that special to me. I liked the Kiki burger for the mushrooms though. 

We also ordered the oxtail fries. It was a big portion of fries but they skimped on the meat and the spicy garlic sauce. When I asked for more sauce they wanted to charge me :(. 

If you're into fancy fusion burgers where the burgers are slightly sweet, slightly spicy then this could be your jam. However this place isn't for me.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,6,2,3,Uk8j66v8i4-Gk792E16EnQ

I know it's just burgers but match that with quality beef and the freshest of ingredients and you get one succulent and gratifying meal. I got the Kiki burger, there was a lot going on with all the components but all the flavors melded together creating an incredible burger paired with truffle fries and the moan inducing (in a good way of course!) salted caramel marshmallow shake. Hubby got the Mr. Ho's burger which was amazing as well (if you love lap cheong this is definitely the burger for you) with salt and pepper fries and a guava milkshake.

Sure they're a little pricier than your average burger joint, but I'd pay LV strip prices any day to get the first class quality of food and service here.
Shout out to the manager Chris who came out to chat with us and was very proud of his work of art (milkshakes) and their house made caramel and marshmallow.

5228806,2015-04-13,2,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"I went to Bachi Burger originally about 5 years ago, at their Windmill location.  I loved it then, but never really found myself on that side of town when I was craving a burger.  

A while back, I had bookmarked Bachi HLK, but never had the chance to try it.  
Fast forward to a month ago, and I noticed driving home one day, that the location of the Bachi HLK was now a Bachi Burger.   YES!

The other day, I was craving a burger, and so my fiance and I decided to head over for dinner.

The location is a little small, but very open, and very clean.  

We experienced super polite service from several employees, from the person who sat us, to our server to the busser.  Everyone was super polite and friendly, which made for a pleasant experience. 

My fella and I split an order of the homemade pickles, which are to die for.  We had: pickled cucumber (pickles), beets, japanese eggplant, onions, and garlic.  (all pickled) 
Oh. My.  Word.  
So delicious, I think these have improved over the last 5 years.  The onions and garlic are my favorite!  These are a must, every time.

We also had the duck breast bao buns.  These had
Muscovy Duck Breast, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, and Hoisin BBQ Sauce.  
These were incredible.  All of the flavors worked so well together, and the Hoisin bbq sauce was a perfect compliment.  I'd had bao buns once before, and thought that they were good while others said that they were awful (at another restaurant), but THESE were amazing.  They were light, airy, delicate...SO good.  I can't wait to try the pork ones!

Now, the burger.  
We chose the Banh-Mi:  Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce. 
Wow.  We had it cooked medium, since there is pork, we wanted to make sure it was cooked through...we're definitely more medium rare people, but this was cooked very well.  
The burger was delicious.  Juicy, and packed with flavor.  They brought out a small dish of fish sauce (Nuoc Mam Sauce) to use as a dipping sauce for the burger.  I am not usually a fan of fish sauce...I think it smells like feet. 
THIS one though, had no unpleasant aroma, and actually enhanced the flavor of the burger!  

A friend that was with us also had the Brussels sprouts, which were really tasty as well.  

For drinks, we had the plantation style sweet tea, which had mint and was sweetened with pineapple juice!  It was really good.  

I had the Adult milkshake, the Kona Nightcap:  that has...a whole bunch of deliciousness that I can't remember...I know it had Godiva chocolate liqueur, Kahlua, Baileys....and ice cream. That made me very happy.

They're a little pricey, but they have some insane Weekday happy hour deals.  Monday through Friday from 3-6:30 they have $6 appetizers...and that includes the oxtail chili cheese fries (which are good, even second hand and cold like I tried them the other day.).  

I plan to be back to his location often, especially since they are right near my house.

5255582,2016-05-09,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"A couple of years ago, we found Bachi Burger/Kitchen on the Food Network, so we decided to give them a whirl.  Since then, we've been back a few times per year since we live on the other side of town.  Each time, we've never been disappointed including our family and friends who we've taken over time.  Today, the wife and I decided to have brunch there for Mamacita Day since we were coming from Town Sq.  Good thing we did.  

First off, they had a special buffet menu for Mother's Day which they allowed customers to sample over 10 items, and as many times as we wanted... all for $20.  They were trying to do something different for special occasions, and to drive more traffic during non-peak time according to their Corp Chef, Kellen, who happened to be there today and came out to chat with us about our dining experience.  That was pretty cool... and let us tell you, their potential new menu items were all AWESOME with a capital ""A""!    And so was our server Alex!

On with the food for all you foodies!  
Instead of our regular Oxtail chili cheese fries and Banmi Burgers being avail, they had bottomless mimosas for all moms, and $5 bottomless for everyone else.  All dishes were petite size which allowed you to taste several dishes before getting full.  But if you found something you liked, you could order more.  The short rib hash w/sunny side egg was probably the best dish of the day.  Talk about Asian/American fusion food... Hope this item makes it on their potential new breakfast menu.  We had something very similar in Philly recently, but this was by far much tastier.  We also had their Wagyu sliders, Pan roasted chicken, Smoked Salmon Benedict, maple glazed bacon and sausage, and Pork belly sliders to name a few.   If you're a fan of pork belly, you've got to come to this joint.  I really like the sliders over at Fat Chows, but Bachi has hands down the best in town!  They apparently cook the pork 3 different times before serving them with the right amount of Hoisen sauce.   It's oven cooked, deep fried, then pan sautéed before serving.   Yum and borderline take us to ""Ohio""!   

Two big thumbs up Bachi Burger/Kitchen for having outstanding and extremely tasty foods, but also for having courage to expand your already successful menu!",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,2,1,5,bq177E4MJoksWMjjo1y3qQ

Pretty fast service --- but it was early in the lunch hour.    I used the bar - but there are table and booth options.  If you like sports tv -- they have it on.

Parking super easy -- but there is a lot of construction across the road, so watch out for construction trucks, etc.

Menu straight forward and simple --- pick one of their combos or do a make your own burger.

We went that hunger but there were other items on the menu that sound delicious like the oxtail chili cheese fries. The service here was good, but there were not that many people at the restaurant. Prices are fair and food is tasty. I'll probably be back someday but not anytime soon.",4lWQjFGyGQZa61AfdcRr_Q,4,2,3,sy1nAU9BVDL_ii9pWzyLLw

We all ordered burgers (which came out like 30-40minutes later) but I never got mine. So I asked if they forgot my order, and our server just said, ""hold on,"" went inside to check, then came back and said ""sorry. Its coming out now."" It was obvious that he missed my order because he had to ask me what I had ordered. He didnt even ask me if I still wanted my burger since everyone else at my table was already almost done. Anyways, long story short, i didnt want to make a scene so I just asked to put the burger in a takeout box. Asked for the pineapple ketchup but never got it. And I was charged full amount. I sure wasn't happy about it at all. My friend asked for takeout box but she never brought one, so she ended up asking another server for it. My $16 burger doesnt taste that great now that its been sitting in a box since im back at work now. What a unhappy experience.",g2uNtyAV9cX4ZyDJ3ygQcw,0,0,1,QyezDkh-8w9rLDBuXrpp9g

We waited nearly an hour to get full service, another 30 to get our food & when we did, boy were we in for a surprise, we got the black and green burger cooked medium, more like medium rare with a taste of cold & not fully cooked. Ugh it literally made my friend so sick. My daughter's cheeseburger was fully cooked and a little to much if you ask me, completely burnt from the bottom side I had to cut it off for her to eat it, the poor guy tried his best to do what he could on a busy afternoon and he was completely understaffed which explains the waiting time and delays, however the kitchen was fully staffed and we were not the only unhappy customers. I WILL NEVER be back, we got a refund for the awful burger but it still took us a good 15 minutes while the waiter asked his fellow coworker and the cook, TERRIBLE! I hope the owner or manager gets it together & doesn't depend on one person to run a busy shift.",fesmBxZyYQSElqWD11F4bQ,0,0,1,v7xKO360Sx-PBOe3vBL4OQ

Very convenient location at rainbow and russell that is simply decorated with wood booths and tables.  Must try is the oxtail chili fries as an appetizer.  The iced matcha green tea is very refreshing and goes well with every meal, love unlimited refills btw.  All the burgers are excellently prepared with great flavors making it difficult to try the same one during different trips to Bachi Kitchen.  Personally my favorite is the Kiki's burger with mushrooms, bacon, guyere cheese, veggies and special sauce.  Always cooked to perfection when I order it medium well and the buns aren't typical ones used at other burger joints.  If not in the mood for a burger, I would recommend either of the bun dishes: pork belly or duck.",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,0,0,4,1I_aIYZzfV52U7rb78RmwQ

5708094,2015-03-16,1,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"The food was good but it was pricey for a non-celebrity burger joint located way outside the strip. Just because the place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives doesn't mean I should pay $12-18 for a burger ala carte plus an extra $4-5 for fries. The kids menu items were a bit pricey too ($11) but those included sides at least. There are 3 locations for this place but the competition is either Five Guys or Fatburger, etc. It's not a celebrity burger joint like Bobby's Burger Palace or Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so please do not charge prices like these places unless you're actually in a hotel/casino on the strip. It wouldn't have been so bad if you'd include a side of fries with those burgers.

5727176,2016-02-14,0,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"Oh Bachi on Russell, I'm worried about you! We live very close to this location, and although a bit pricy, it's one of my very favorite spots because of the food!!! Their burgers can't be beat, period. Last night I tried the no meet burger and then regretted my choice, thinking there was no way it would be up to par. It was PHENOMENAL. So good that I'd even chose it over some of the meat burgers. I've never, ever had that much flavor in a veggie burger. Best I've ever had BY FAR. And their cod burger... I seriously crave it.

We LOVE all of their fries too, but last night outs were very soggy and undercooked for the first time ever. Bummer. 

Now let me share why I'm updating with a lower rating. The service here is embarrassing. It's never been great... They always seem to be understaffed. But again... The FOOD! However, it's getting worse.it wasn't busy at all last night... Maybe 3-4 tables, and 3 servers (one was also tending bar on and off), and no hostess. I haven't seen a hostess in here for ages, and they need one!

Since it was quiet, we were seated fairly quickly. Then it took forever to get a seat. Then it took forever to get a server. Once we got a server, he took our drink order, and disappeared for a while. We then had our order taken. One minute later, another waiter came up and asked if he could get us started with our drink orders. With only three tables full, there shouldn't be any confusion. To add to that confusion though, 5 minutes after our order was taken, food was served. However, it wasn't our food, and it wasn't our waiter. Oops!

As we were eating, we saw about four other parties come in. There were only two tables full at this point, and we watched these people sit and wait for a table in a nearly empty restaurant for at least 10 minutes. There really is no excuse for that. One party just finally seated themselves, one or two left, and the other finally got seated. It was embarrassing to watch.

Another issue last night. We ordered the kale salad. On the menu, it states that it comes with pine nuts. When ours arrived, it had walnuts. I'm allergic to walnuts, and luckily saw them before I took a bite. I understand not having ingredients, but it's not okay to sub other ingredients without letting customers know. Especially with nuts, because they are well known allergens. They took the salad back and made us a new one, and apologized twice, which was nice. 

And lastly, please, PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, bring back the pickled veggie appetizer!!! It was the most unique, flavor exploding dish on the menu. We were told that you can only get it at the other location now.

Bachi, we love you. We know you can turn this around. But you've got to work on it, and quickly before you lose more customers.",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,0,0,3,OjYLTXMC6bB8hqrH6lp_Mg

As always, the Kiki burger ceases to disappoint. Always so delicious. Fries would also be a yummy addition but seeing as I usually don't finish my burger, I forego it. Coincidentally, this last visit I finished the entirety of my burger. Either it's gotten more delish than usual or I was actually that hungry.

Service was a little slow since there were 2 servers and only 5 tables seated. It could have been the time of day, 3pm. Staff maybe getting ready for the dinner crowd? I won't ding them for this because we were not in a hurry.
I ordered the 7 oz Angus Burger. The burger is good, Angus is my favorite beef and the portion is just right. I dislike giant burgers that leave me stuffed and wanting a nap. 
My wife had Kiki's Burger. It was obvious she was very pleased with her choice since she did not offer to let my try nor leave any on the plate for my to sample when she was done.
We split an order of Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. The fries were very good, I always put pepper on my potatoes and you can never go wrong with garlic.

Someone from higher management needs to take a look at the wait staff in this location. Nobody is paying attention to the tables as they chat behind the bar where there is not a single customer sitting. They act bothered when you ask for anything. 7 people are on the floor but nobody is doing anything more productive than marrying the sauce bottles. This is a town of service workers..

5915299,2017-11-26,4,ytk8XVFegCSdSBXLDZutpw,"We used to frequent this location all the time however we moved zip codes so now our default location is the Sahara location. We were in the area earlier this week and decided to stop in for dinner. Man has this place changed. I have always commended the brand for maintaining a consistent product at their locations however this location seems to have gone rogue. The food here is nowhere near the expectations and standards of the other locations. The first fopaux on this visit came with our wings. The plating and presentation was very nice however the looks were very deceiving. The top 2 wings tasted as they should (sauced and at the right temp) however the bottom 4 wings were ice cold and raw in the center. 
The second issue came with the fries. The salt pepper garlic fries did not have the same shishito pepper taste, only 2 or 3 slivers of peppers and were super salty. The truffle parmesan fries were cold, did not taste of any truffles and only a small drizzle of the brown mushroom sauce and NO parmesan on it. We had to ask for a side of the mushroom gravy and sprinkle it ourself. 
Now to the burgers... 
We have frequented bachi enough to have tried all of their burger (with the exception of the shogun) and have settled on what we like.

Me: spicy miso add bacon medium/rare
The lady: Kiki burger medium. 

So the lady's burger came out ""ok"" however the bacon was undercooked and very skimpy (maybe a 2"" soggy sliver).
My spicy miso was super sad:
The shredded lettuce was not the normal type that we are accustomed to (don't know the exact name) but rather old shredded iceberg lettuce. As mentioned with the lady's burger my bacon was also undercooked and very skimp. Usually the bacon is crossed and sticking out of the bun however all I got was one small (less than 1"" piece) of undercooked bacon. 

The good:
The service here on this visit was very attentive. They did seem to be a bit short staffed however they did their best to be attentive to us and all of the other guests. They did empathize with the undercooked food and offered to comp us for the chicken and discount our the remainder of our check. 

This last visit was really disheartening as we have been avid supporters of the brand and constantly promote it with all of our guests and visitors. After this visit I can. I longer recommend this location. I hope that management can take the constructive criticism and improve the product consistency at this location. For now my recommendation is to satisfy your Bachi craving at one of the other 2 location.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,6,5,2,PKJBR3IJQNKuHH6bArDgwg
