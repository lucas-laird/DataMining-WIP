We stopped in for dinner after a movie. We were the last ones in before they closed the kitchen, and for that we were thankful. We were all out grateful that they never once made us feel rushed.

We skipped appetizers, as we had had popcorn at the movie. My hubby ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and I had the veal francese. The alfredo sauce was fantastic. There's not much in it but cream and cheese and it's done well. Extremely rich. The lemon sauce on the veal was out of this world. Perfectly balanced lemony but not sour and buttery and herby. The kitchen was out of mashed potatoes, which is the typical side for te dish. The waitress and I discussed it and I got angel hair with more of the lemon sauce. It was just the right substitution, and I will order it that way on purpose in the future!

The big winner of the night was the tiramisu. Chef Dianna has something REALLY special there. It was heavenly perfection with just all the right stuff. We will be back for more!",HjbMIiQ5Qg5gkzdVFt_JIA,1,0,5,43SqbeLktMTblM-AmQq7xw

Don't ya just love it when the waitresses' first words are ""how are you guys?"" to a table of two men, two women?  Gross!

Food was good...just soured by poor customer service, ugly room (including the putrid green seating in the booths)
What looked like a manager spent our entire meal conversing with a couple at a nearby table, and he, along with rest of staff, never asked the usual ""is everything ok?, are you enjoying your meal?"", etc.

2081048,2016-07-05,3,zTkMh_RUVZW-J3lh7-l09Q,"Pasta Cucina is an Italian restaurant located inside Boulder Station casino. My friend invited my boyfriend and I to join her and her hubby for dinner. She made a reservation for 7:30pm on Friday 7/1/16.  

The ambiance here is nice, but misleading. You walk in and it looks like you are about to have a 5 star meal. Dim lighting, cozy booths, comfy seats with cloth napkins, fancy fancy! Our server for the evening was Quentin and he was the best part of the meal. We ordered drinks  and then breadsticks with warm marinara and alfredo dipping sauces were brought to the table. To me, it's a red flag when alfredo is brought out for free, because that is usually a more sought after sauce. Everywhere else that serves Alfredo is usually extra $$$ if you want it on the side. I dipped a breadstick into the sauce and found that it was very goopy and had thick clumps. Ah ha! This is why it's free. I enjoyed the marinara more and that is rare because I love alfredo sauce. We ordered some appetizers to start, the fried mozzarella and the meatball sliders. The mozzarella came out so fast and it was lukewarm. The cheese didn't even stretch when you pulled it apart. The sliders looked better than they tasted. The meatballs were not all that. 

We ordered our entrees a short time later. I was going to get the alfredo, that is before I tried it, so I decided to get linguini and clams. My boyfriend got the baked penne and our friends got the veal and chicken parmesans. All entree's came with either a salad or minestrone soup. I chose the salad with the house dressing. I expected an Italian dressing but instead got a sweet dressing. It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting. Then the entree's came out. I had about two bites of mine and I was done. It was not good at all. I have had linguini and clams before, and it was flavorful. This dish, although it was supposed to have wine, garlic, and butter tasted like mop water. Quentin could tell I wasn't enjoying my food and asked me if I would like anything else. I ended up getting the baked penne my boyfriend had. Now that was good. There was lots of cheese and sausage and meatballs mixed throughout. I would order that again. All in all, if you are looking for good Italian food, skip this place. You're better off going to Olive Garden.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,1,2,0vOS59bFEr8EghSh5Mwwzw

Been to this one multiple times and the one at Palace but the Palace Station one sucks sucks sucks

Have to give it 5 stars for exceeding expectations by a ridiculous amount. It's not in the nicest part of town, hell it's also in a casino, but once your inside MOST of that doesn't matter. Once there were a couple trashy women in torn jean shorts and dirty white tees, blech.

Of course went on a date-

Anyway... food gets 3.5 stars for being above average and prices are surprisingly low for the portions.

Service = 5 stars, the waiter we had (and ask for) was excellent. Far better than you would think, i had to leave an exceptional tip he was attentive, genuinely wanted to be there and serve, and somehow convinced us to get dessert which is rare for me to agree with! (He wheeled out a dessert cart, which looked yummy, and we had the canoli? and it was superb!) Once had a female who seemed un-enthused but lets let that one slide.

Decor gets a 5, really really set the romantic mood and just being there made me and my girl giddy and cute right off the bat.

2250573,2011-06-27,2,zTkMh_RUVZW-J3lh7-l09Q,"With tickets for the Railhead (John Waite!) in one hand, and the other hand resting on my hungry belly, we decided to try Boulder Station's Pasta Palace.

Our luck has been mixed when it comes to the Italian places at Station casinos in the past. San Lorenzo, at Texas Station, was delicious and simple with A+ service. (Then they changed the menu. Fiends.) Capri, at Sunset Station, was as uninviting in taste as it was in decor and the  demeanor of its host. Pasta Palace at Palace was quite good the first time, but on the second visit we experienced a case of ""glad we had a coupon."" We went to PP at Boulder with no expectation other than Chef Boyardee not to be in residence.

From the moment we were greeted at the podium, the staff made us feel graciously welcome. Our waitress was warm and professional, making useful suggestions (such as turning our lemonades into raspberry or strawberry lemonades - not on the menu) while also being cheerfully clear about cost ($1 extra, unlimited refills).

As we sat in our (comfy, and we're both ""fluffy"" people) booth, I noted with a mental thumbs up how well the dining area is laid out. Spacious distance between booths/tables, and cozy, dark elements in a casual but tasteful design.

One corner of the restaurant is open to the working back area of the Metro Pizza operation next door. It doesn't detract from the ambiance, being away from the main dining area, but I do wonder if Metro fulfills Pasta Palace's pizza orders.

One of our assistant waiters (we had two or three) made a small mistake with our drinks - no big deal - but I was impressed with how apologetic both he and our head waiter were. Who cares about a little mistake when your servers are obviously so committed to you having a great meal?

Wait, you may say something to yourself, isn't this a two-star review? She sounds so comfortable and happy. What gives?

I know, and my clicky finger does hover over the three-star (""A-OK"") mark just because, darn, it was so nice there, surrounded by friendly people and endless raspberry lemonades, but... but... the food. The food. (Dramatic, ""hands are tied"" frownie face of disappointment goes here.)

Of all the Station properties, the food at this Pasta Palace had to be the most bland and cheap-tasting. My husband's rigatoni tasted like it came from a packet - you know that sort of gummy taste? Like that. I leaned across the table. ""Does yours even have sauce?"" Like me, he'd gone for a mix of alfredo and marinara sauces, neither of which brought out anything good about the other on this occasion. Nothing sharp, nothing mellow - nothing really at all. (So it's just as well that his pasta was barely coated in it.)

I had the cheese ravioli. ""Meh. I've experienced better."" (That's me quoting Yelp's two-star catchphrase.) I'd shrug if I were eating it at home, in front of the television, probably slugging on the salt and pepper with the hand not holding the remote. At a restaurant, though, I expect a sensation beyond ""Yes, I'm swallowing an inoffensive wet lump.""

We did like the salads for having a little more artichoke and banana pepper, etc., than you might get at, say, Olive Garden. The bread basket was warm and fine, if a little uninventive. (Garlic sticks, not very buttery, and somewhat dry foccacia, no flatbreads.)

It could be that we ordered ""poorly."" Maybe Pasta Palace delivers on the promises of its setting and staff with a few great dishes that we missed. I don't really accept that excuse, though: if it's on the menu, I expect it to be decent, and my one clear definition of ""decent"" is ""has some value beyond what you could easily get from a packet or can.""

Because the food was so unremarkable if not a little gluey/heavy/icky for us, I can't quite nudge myself to that third star. (Three stars implies that we might go back.) But, if you're looking for good service and good lemonade, and your pasta expectations can be met by what I described above, then give Boulder's Pasta Palace a try. The dessert tray did look rather delicious.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,0,2,u4YARplOKFO9BQhsAP6M9A

They used to have excellent artisan breads, now you get breadsticks you can buy in a big bag at Albertsons for five bucks. They are warmed up and sprinkled with granulated garlic.

The house salad was generic and the spaghetti and meatballs couldn't give Chef Boyardee a run for his money. 

The staff was professional, friendly and attentive.  Too bad the food they have to serve is so sub-par. Typical of big casino management trying to get by on the cheap.

My mother received a coupon for Pasta Cucina in the mail and we figured it was a good enough deal to get us in. I'm weary of Italian places because I just feel like a lot of them are overpriced and not very good. Hmm, my inklings continue to prove me right. 

Let's begin with service - lackluster and cold. The BIOTCH waitress who served us was just terrible. And yes, she was indeed a BIOTCH in all rights. She knew we had a coupon and we didn't order her much pushed on us wine. Therefore we were done, for her, by the time we ordered our raspberry iced teas. Everything else about her service to use was electronic and rude.

Food - the raspberry iced tea was incredibly too sweet. I felt like I was drinking tea spiked with Hi-C fruit punch. Terrible for a ""nice"" restaurant to serve such a drink. I ordered the Tuscan Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken (add $2). The plate was being overtaken with angel hair, and all the other ingredients were lost. The dish boasted pine nuts - I think I got a total of five in the whole dish. Instead of lovely combo of flavors, which the dish should have been, it was just a mound of angel hair with some chicken pieces thrown on it. My mother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a dish that is wonderfully traditional, and which she loves. The meatballs were large and they were good. The sauce was decent, but alas - my mother asked to have the normal spaghetti replaced with angel hair and guess what? She got regular spaghetti.

By this point we were stuffed and had only eaten not even half of our dishes (they're just HUGE). We got to-go bags and received our bill. If I had been paying the waitress would have gotten half the tip my mother left her. 

I will not return to Pasta Cucina. Overpriced Italian food restaurant strikes again.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,1,2,nqN5GThK4dAfAhYr0ny_qg

i thought this place was one of those fast did place because it seemed like very restaurant here looked like it.  but this place you walk into the doors and then the restaurant is inside.

we had to wait around 30 minutes.  I really suggest you call and MAKE A RESERVATION.  you get in a lot faster.

I think we came about 1.5 hour before the place closed.  when we finally got to our table, there were a lot of free tables open but we still had to wait 30 minutes to get a table.. WTH weird and that kinda annoyed me.  they better have a good reason for making me wait!! 

I loved the eggplant Parmesan at this other restaurant so I tried and ordered it here.  i didn't know that this was battered and it had spaghetti noodles on it too.  I did not like this dish at all.  there was too much batter that's all I tasted and the spaghetti sauce was whatever's.  I would have rather eaten it as an appetizer instead of being it's own entree with the noodles.

I forgot what entree I ordered but it was really good.  it was linguini and it had clams, mussels, and shrimp in it.  it was also in a red sauce that kind of resembled marinara but was more watery.  the sauce flavor was good!! ask for this dish if you go here.

We've never had any issues at Sunsets location. Food is consistently good service is a ok so we were thinking it would be the same here. 

The decor here is way nicer a little more intimate where as Sunsets location is just an open area looking out at the casino. That's about all that's better at this Boulder location. Doesn't make sense for us to come here unless it's comped. 

It's super smokey here. So smokey u can smell it all the way inside of the restaraunt. 
A short visit will have your clothes and hair reeking of it. So disgusting and not so good for your health either. Yikes ! 

Our waitress was nice and filled our drinks quick but was nowhere to be found after as we were waiting on our breadsticks which took a while to come out. I usually go for the chicken & artichoke pasta which is consistently good at Sunset. While the taste was good here it was swimming in sauce.

 Apparently the chicken parmesan is the bomb. Everyone loved it, and the portion was huge. Seriously it's the thing to get if you are starving or just want to heat up leftovers the next night.
 The breadsticks were fine, the water was great, the service was great. The waitress was very honest as far as prices go and all.
 The decor makeover was very impressive, it beautiful in there now and the seating is more comfortable.
 However the fancier dishes seemed to be a no no.
As in they can heat things up here but not... ""cook"". Artichoke pasta was and I quote "" Disgusting like wallpaper"". I ordered veal marsala and got chicken ,I didn't make a big deal out of it immediately, but then the sauce was disgusting. Cheap sugery nasty goop. By then I would have held everyone up to have them fix my order as I did have to say something once I noticed the sauce, but I just said forget it. The waitress did offer to fix the problem.

Being a top tier member I have already had the privilege of experiencing a fantastic  dinner at the Station Casinos. Tonight was no exception we had dinner at pasta Cucina and it was amazing. I had the Carbonaro and Justin had the osso bucco two must haves. My suggestion is to sit at the bar with Amber. She was so diligent and attentive and I am very hard to please when I go out to eat. Not because I am an asshole but because I work in the industry and I feel that it is hard to live up to the standard I set for my self when I am taking care of guests. The food was awesome and the service was even better. We had the Italian stallion to drink an espresso martini for dessert and a huge piece of chocolate cake to finish things off. I f you haven't dined at either of these establishments I recommend you do so. The pricing was on point for a nice dinner but had a relaxed casual feel to it.

The desserts are divine and because the portion is so generous, we found it was better to share one. The staff is amazing, the attentiveness they have given us makes us want to return often. Even the leftovers are delicious! Our new favorite reasonably priced Italian restaurant!",q9W6TMP0dAc0-MrZk93TbQ,0,0,5,_qZtc-D-hYv9yNdvNqYd-A

Out of 5stars
Service (5):  Our server was very personable, sweet, & wonderful!
Food: (4.5)  The food was delicious.  I love their lasagna & their blu-crumble cheese steak ( i dont actually remember the name of the entree i bought, but it was amazing!) & their price are worth the good  
Atmosphere (5): It seems like they renovated the place because it seems like you are not inside Boulder station casino, but in a very classy restaurant.  It is very vibrant and lovely.  

Tip:  They charge for a cutting fee if you bring a cake.",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,3,2,5,0JW5RfasU0fw4qCzVaKcIQ

But once the food did come it was good. This is the old pasta palace. But redone. It is a little off the strip, but worth it. Good odds gambling and good food are what i look for when i come to vegas. This station casino has both. If you have a car and want good italian food at a good price come here. I am a picky eater and like this alot.",6BjjbdDxyYPGg4uyAhcELQ,0,0,4,tVxsZWa51qVP2pVfe8shEA
