I was there for the happy Hour so I ask the waitress about sitting on the comfy chairs up front. Her reply was it's not a 1st come , 1st served and we would have to charge your party of 5 a 150$ I was like just to sit or is that how much food and drink we needed to order . Her reply was "" just to sit. "" we started laughing , not high rollers at all. We gently walked ourselves over to the bar stools . Hahahaha.                                                    Over all experience was cool, not a bad seat In the house . Good choices for beers if that's your thing. The Yard was a good look, we ordered up all the appetizers and felt the jack Daniels wings were a hit too. Will be looking for another sports bar upon returning to Vegas .

124279,2012-04-20,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"In a case of 'I was in the building so I figured I'd try it out', I had to be at the Monte Carlo this week for a meeting right around lunch time and thought I'd take that opportunity to try a new burger spot. While not a single person has recommended me to The Pub, I figured I'd try it out nonetheless as their menu listed several different options online and a friend said she had a great burger there. So have I stumbled across a hidden gem?

Located in the always desolate 'mall' area of the Monte Carlo, The Pub as its name suggests is very much focused on their beer selection. The space is huge, with a lot of high top tables, and a sinuous bar that seems to go on forever through the room. The menu offers many selections from typical bar food, to some more atypical items like wiener schnitzel, shrimp po'boy, and muffaletta. But placed in the center of the menu is a highlighted Build Your Own Burger section, with several pre-made choices placed next to it.

I went with the Pub Burger, which consists of cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and The Pub secret sauce. Upon first bite the meat had great char flavor, but that kind of got lost as I got into the rest of it. The 'regular' bun I went with was way too big, thick and dry. It had a good buttery smell, but that hint of flavor didn't come through enough. The meat had good flavor overall as well, it was cooked just right, but was not as juicy as I would have liked as there was no mess at the end. I see that mess on my plate when I'm finished and it makes me all the more satisfied. The cheese was non-existent in the whole assembly, but it had ok flavor when I pulled some out and tried some on its own. The secret sauce was almost non-existent too; luckily there was some sauce on the onions I pulled out so I was able to sample it. It was eerily similar to In-N-Out sauce, seemed to be a relish-based flavor. Overall this was a decent burger, nothing outstanding. Maybe if the bun was a bit smaller and less overpowering I could have enjoyed the overall flavor of everything a tiny bit more.

My beer-battered fries were ok, they had decent flavor and were cooked well. Nothing out of this world. Can anyone suggest a place they've had lately with stand out fries?? Probably not. By the end of my meal I was full, maybe even satisfied, but not blown away. This was just another run-of-the-mill decent burger, I feel like a lot of the bars I go to lately are just coming through on creating a slightly better than normal burger that fits the formula. I miss being blown away I guess. My burger, fries and iced tea came to just over $18 which is acceptable for a location on the strip I suppose, but there are far better options on the strip if you're specifically going somewhere for a stand out burger.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,L-FDWeJ2BxqeQZIAosK4Sg

I had friends from out of town come in and wanted to watch the game. We brought them here for the large tvs thinking it would be a great place to enjoy sunday night football. Unfortunately on average is has taken us 20 minutes to receive our drinks each time. We never got our table clear of our appetizer plates. And we had to ask for several things more than once. When I finally got a managers attention to let him know of the service he was very uninterested and looked confused. In the end 3 red Bull vodkas with sky cost $51. 2 angry balls (fireball and apple cider) were $36. Outrageous prices for terrible service.

154916,2010-06-16,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"We were staying at the Monte Carlo and I'll admit the only reason we decided to check it out before going out was because of the ladies drink free from 6-7pm(also 10-11pm) the free drinks are all well drinks and also one type of beer.  They also have a happy hour from 4-7 and I think it had two for one well drinks and I'm not sure what else.  So my review is a bit biased with the free drinks.  But after ordering the first one, the bartender kept them coming without me even asking for the rest of the time.  Also at 7pm this one bartender did this pretty awesome trick of pouring these shots, definitly worth staying and watching.  The bartender was very friendly and happy go lucky.  I really liked the ambience, we ordered the fajita nachos to munch on.  They had a good selection of appetizers for snacking on and the menu looked pretty interesting.

They will let you watch a game until the next patron comes in and wants to watch their team. We came early and made sure they would allow us to watch the whole game.

208687,2012-01-06,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"Wanted to try this location for several years. Love the pub concept but, it is sadly done here. Went here as a result of a client staying at the Monte Carlo. Client is from Holland and when we sit down he asks if they have any Dutch beers. Waitress looks at him, puzzled and says no. He asks, what about Heineken or Amstel? She says, ""oh yeah, we have those"". Now, I'm not asking the staff to be geography experts, but a simple knowledge of mainstream beers is not too much to ask for a place that holds itself out to be a beer lovers heaven. I order a run of the market Hef and it comes out totally flat. Not looking for a coke, just not a stale/flat beer.

Food was pitiful at best: Ordered what I thought would be a safe bet at a beer pub, sliders. Buns were stale and rock cold. Fries as well. Waitress no where in sight to even register a comment. This was a Thursday afternoon, not exactly prime time so the place was not packed at all, just business lunch goers like us. This was not a complex order.

331969,2010-01-26,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"The upside: 78 taps of draft beer; good food at decent prices.

The downside: $8 per pint. Seriously.

I walked into The Pub on a Sunday night, and it was dead, but my attention was grabbed by the taps behind the bar. I noticed they had 20 or so -- a rarity on the Strip and in LV in general -- then I saw more. And more. And more. 78 in total, with an excellent selection of domestic craft beers and imports, in addition to the usual Bud/Coors/Miller. The menu listed 59 beers, and the waitress filled us in on the remaining 19. I grabbed a Stone Pale Ale -- so far, so good.

Turned to the food, and it looked good: standard bar fare like burgers and appetizers, some flatbreads and some heavier entrees. The waitress recommended the burgers, which didn't disappoint, and at $12 for a good-sized burger and fries, are good value for the Strip and in line with off-Strip prices.

As I said, it was pretty dead, maybe 5 other tables. It seems like The Pub would be a great place to watch a game, they have plenty of TVs including a large projection screen that drops down over the stage. It's got a sports bar feel to it, and the decor is nothing fancy.

All was good until we got the bill and realized the pints were $8 each, which even for the Strip, feels a bit over the top. As a previous reviewed mentioned, perhaps they've built what they don't charge you in a cover into the price of the drinks, or maybe it's how MGM plans on paying for CityCenter next door. In any case, ouch.

So keep the high beer prices in mind and consider yourself warned. If you're ok with that, there are a lot worse places you could go on the Strip for decently priced, solid if unspectacular, food.",afZAAOVBbSdQUxSMnEurWw,1,0,3,XGn0IoIStS3f4qsroKA55Q

At the end of our meal we asked for to go cups so we could take our beers with us when we left. So we ordered another round of beers to go. 

Our waitress brought over clear plastic to go cups for us. My brother poured his brand new 22oz beer into the to go cup. To everyone's surprise the 22oz beer fit perfectly into the 16oz to go cup.  So The Pub has been selling 16 oz beers and charging their customers for 22oz's. 

We then tried our own experiment just to make sure. We poured our waters into the empty 22oz glass that the beer came in. Then poured the water from the 22oz glass into another empty 16oz to go cup.  I'm sure you already know the outcome, all the water fit into the 16oz glass. 

When we showed our waitress this, and asked why The Pub is scamming their customers and charging them for 22oz beers when it is really 16oz she acted disinterested. Then we showed the bartender and he ""doesn't order the cups. I just pour the drinks."" The asst. manager, Ryan Blair, was a complete jerk to say it nicely. He was very hostile and defensive. 

This was the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had. Ryan Blair really needs help on his customer service skills. They took $6.85 off of our $170.00 bill to give us our money back for the difference in cost between a 22oz and a 16oz beer. 

I hope many people read this review and now know that The Pub is ripping off their customers when they order 22oz drinks. Everyone should try our experiment and see for themselves. 

I can't wait to get a response from management regarding this review. What could they possibly say??  Blah Blah Blah.",Lz6AOhh96bt7Bz6WPIGrPA,4,0,1,7pGPg1dAjDlFQ0-eogCAKg

The wall of beer taps was pretty impressive. I was looking for food more-so than drink however. We had our choice of tables and it was incredibly hot so at first putting us by the pool seemed like an interesting idea, the heat from outside was just to much and they were pretty open to us sitting wherever. Turned out not to matter however as the pool people would wander in and bikini clad girls wandering by immediately made this place at least a 2 star. 
The food was moderately priced so me and a friend split a plate of ""whale wings"" (larger than normal buffalo wings) and a tower of onion rings. The wings were tasty - had a slight amount of heat and the provided blue cheese dressing made em finger lickin good. The onion rings had a tasty shell but the onions inside were slimy.
Only kinda off putting moment was when the table behind us started getting ignored - they were a rather large table and were sat down just a few minutes later than us but by the time we got our food they had not even gotten their drinks. The place filled up really quick too. While we had our choice of tables within a half hour the place was nearly packed. The bill wasn't bad though for some fairly tasty food.

They were good, but nothing to write home about. They had many bartenders on the clock, so we never had to wait for a single drink.

Our first bartender was rude and made our whole group (6 people) sit at the very back, because he was it was easier for him if we all sat in the same area.  Why that matters, I'm not really sure, because we were all paying individually.

My second bartender was fine.  When I asked for a whiskey and coke, he acted like he had never heard of such a thing.

Another bartender was beyond rude to two individuals in our group.  When one of our guys asked for a beer (a common, big name beer), the bartender yelled at him, saying that The Pub has X number of beers and he should get one of them instead and gave him a hard time for wanting the beer he wanted.

536445,2014-08-26,2,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"In my self-proclaimed foodie opinion, the overall delicious rating to nearly any restaurant can almost always be measured by two factors - their beverage menu, and their fries. 

For starters: Beverage Menu. 
They definitely offer some good brews from around the globe, but it's also apparent that they are corporate as there is nothing outrageously unique or exciting for those of us who really know beer. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed my Westmalle Belgian Duble and good beer is to be found. 

Secondly: Fries
I am a sucker for sweet potato fries so they naturally were delivered to my spot at the bar along side my burger. Big strike against any establishment who tops sweet potato fries with more sweetness. The marshmallow dipping sauce would have been a home run in a room full of little kids, but to appease a more development pallet, they need some saltiness to contrast the sweet. It's like adding that pinch of salt to the cookie dough that takes the cookies from yummy to outofthisworld. 

Overall review would be that it is good. Overpriced (but that's to be expected). And caters to the typical American pallet who seem to follow the motto that sugar and/or cheese can make any dish better. The good news is that most people visiting Vegas probably fall in that category so many will be pleased. But for those who prefer burger and fries with a little more sophistication, it may not be it. Although I've yet to find an ideal burger spot on the strip so this may be as good as it gets.",q1p8v0omTinO4xYHpbstLg,5,2,3,pm-h4cliFp7qxlL8ohZBgg

One was while wandering around the casino lost, I ended up engaged in a 45 minute conversation with a super geeky hostess about everything from craft beer to Star Wars to having brothers who live in neighboring suburbs of Kansas City.

The other, is the fact that The Pub is probably the best spot on the Strip for escaping the monotony of Bud Light, Corona, and faux-microbrews that seem to permeate absolutely every other drinking establishment in Vegas.

The Pub has over 300 beers on tap, the majority of which are various real microbrews or other legit craft beers. Prices range from a 6-7 dollar a pint Dogfish Head type beer to a 500 dollar a pint Duvel, which had better either grant eternal life or be like the Felix Felicis potion from Harry Potter to be worth it. I treated myself to a perfectly poured New Belgium 1554 that was absolutely delicious.

Our bartender was super friendly and efficient too. I won't name him, to keep him out of trouble since I got my 9 dollar beer for the ""Dueling Piano special"" price of 2 bucks that was intended for the Bud Lights. But he knows who he is, and treating a guy who clearly knows his beer to a little discount was a nice touch in a city so known for being so ungodly overpriced.

And yes, they do have dueling pianos on some nights. The guys were cheesier as hell (marvel at how many times the one can mention his tiny pecker in a song!) but that was clearly the point, and it was an enjoyable accompaniment to my beer.

So yeah, if I'm ever in Vegas again, and have a bit more money to spend, The Pub at the Monte Carlo will definitely be one of my haunts. I have 299 more beers to try (well, 298, I'm not touching that Duvel) and those nachos I neglected to order looked absolutely fantastic.

It was cooked perfectly and the fries that came with it was so good. I was snacking on the fries in order to break from all the cheese.

Just before causing trouble on our first night, we arrive at the Pub looking for some dinner. We place our names down for a table and was informed there is a 10 minute wait. The hostess says we are free to grab a drink at the bar to wait. So we stop by the bar which overlooks the main dining area and the guys playing the dueling pianos. We immediately notice, there has to be like 20+ some odd tables that are open but we wait. In about 5 minutes, I stop by an ask the hostess if there was a table available and she says ""no not yet, you have about 6 minutes left"". Yes, she really did said 6 minutes. So I go back tell everyone what she had told me and we all have a good laugh. So we wait exactly 10 minutes (no joke) and we get seated.

We get seated right in front of the stage with the dueling pianos which is kind of cool and kind of loud making it difficult to talk to the others in the group. After getting seated, we wait for the waiter to stop by the table. We wait some more. About 20 minutes rolls by and someone in our group finally grabs anyone that works there to get our drink and food order. We order the calamari for the group to share and my gf and I get a margherita pizza to share between the both of us. The food is just average and for drinks its hard for the bartender to screw up Ketel One on the rocks so there isn't much to comment on.

Skipping to the end, I think The Pub should change its name to The Wait because if you come here, you will definitely be waiting a lot. Its not like the place was packed on this Friday night with the 20+ open tables in the joint (which probably says a lot right there), but service is definitely lacking here. The only highlight of the night was dueling pianos and the guys playing them. They were awesome and quite funny. Unfortunately, I don't think it was enough to make up for everything else this restaurant did wrong.

It has consistently offered fine burgers. My favorite is currently the mushroom burger. The flatbread pizzas and chicken wings are quite tasty too. 

The current stand out feature of this place has to be the ""all-you-can-drink, make-your-own-drink,"" bar buffet. Not sure if it is offered year-round, but we were there on a Saturday in October for college football. It works like this: Pay $30 and from 11:00AM to 3:00PM you walk up to the bartender, who pours you whatever poison you want, as many times as you want during those 4 hours. There is a table set up with all sorts of mixing ingredients for you to get creative with. I made one hell of a Bloody Mary...just couldn't say no to all the different peppers and horseradish in front of me.

There was an event for piano dueling and one of my friend wanted to go and see. We were going to have a couple of beers and an appetizer then head on to dinner afterwards. The hostess said that we have to wait at least 10 minutes for a table. We only had a party of five and there were bar tables and long tables unoccupied. We waited anyhow and we were showed to our table.  He ID'd everyone because you have to be 18 and over when you're in the pub. We were ordering our drink and I told our waiter, Timothy, that I was sick and I did not want to drink alcohol. I asked if he had any other drinks other than beer and he gave me an attitude by saying ""do you mean non-alcoholic drinks?"" After that happened, i ended ordering the ice tea, my friend ordered a sweet bear, two miller lites, and a pear cider. We also ordered the Chili Garlic chicken wings because Timothy suggested it and it was edible. Nothing I would go running back for and definitely would not beg to eat. The way he gave us our food is the most aggravating part. Like I said, I ordered the tea and he slammed down the sugar next to me and the tea. He proceeded with tossing me the straw. The worst server I have ever encounter. I was wondering why it was so slow because they had an event going. I figured it was because of the night club goers, but it's just the horrible customer service. He slammed every drink and our appetizer. I asked him for napkins because I was sick and my nose was running, but he took his sweet time getting it for me. We kept trying to get his attention to ask him for to get another order for my friend's food and another cider, but he's not attentive whatsoever. We finally got his attention and he responded with ""got it."" I don't understand why you would open a business just to watch it fail with your employees but it is their business. It was also difficult getting the check. Our bill came out to be around 50~. We gave him our card and he came back with it. I expected a ""thank you and have a great night"" and what I actually got was ""just sign it and leave it there"" we tipped out of courtesy, but we were bitter about it. I doubt that they will survive because one of the yelpers explained that it actually changed to a pub, but they would not get any money from me anymore. 

Bottom line: Even if you want to grab a bite and thought about this place, just go to McDonalds. If you wanted to drink, just go to the casino and order the drink then tip the cocktail waitress. Avoid at all cost.",ZAtkPeQYsm-p7DnNeUBfwA,0,0,1,iMkPW_sEANw-fh6BrT1h5A

When I arrived at the bar, two black males had been standing there waiting for drinks. They were completely and blatantly ignored. The bartender did the same to me as I watched him serve all the other white patrons. When I asked him if I would get some service, 20 minutes later, he acted as if I didn't exist. So I decided to walk away and someone else offered to buy my drinks. She was served by the other Hispanic bartender who was cordial and respectful to everyone who was ordering. 
Later that night, we moved to the back corner of the pub. I was told that the younger bartender was fair because he did first-come-first-serve. Once again, I stood there for a long time as he served all the other white patrons around me. When I asked for service, he just shrugged his shoulders and served people who only showed up a minute beforehand. 
I brushed off the first incident but when it is done multiple times, it's a pattern and it's obviously racist. I had warned a few other colored people at the bar about the worst service I have ever experienced. They later came up to me and told me they were refused service as well. They were mostly Kenyan and Fijian patrons.

I can't review the food: as a bar it's fine, not great. It's Vegas, so I feel like there is always going to be some element of big bars feeling like a cattle call with hit or miss service, but because we were staying there and it became our default bar, we got a good feeling for what this place was about. Roughly 30 of us stayed in the Monte Carlo, and overall the experiences I kept having and hearing were the same: hit or miss with service. Some of the bartenders were excellent, some were surly and took forever. The hostess was consistently rude. Sometimes we felt welcomed, sometimes we felt like we should just leave. 
It was fine because it was in the hotel, we were mostly just happy to (eventually) get a drink and see each other, and when the Spazmatics played (the 80s cover band) we all had a blast dancing and singing along.

I do miss the brewery being gone but this has nothing to do with that so back on topic. The 8 Pound Hamburger Challenge is the story. We didn't go even knowing it was on the menu but after a few minutes of indecision on ordering food we laughingly said for 30 bucks the picture would be worth it. So the menu says 8 pounds, fries and a 32 ounce beer served in a boot mug. I figured we would split it not planning on ever trying to finish it in the time limit. When the waiter went to put the order in he came back and said that we couldn't split it for 30 dollars and it would be 50 if we wanted to. The goal was to get it free or pay if not eaten in the time limit. Not sure why it would be more but he pointed to the menu. Seems we didn't read the bottom part. That said if not up to the challenge share with 2 or 3, 50 bucks. We still said dinner for two 50 bucks what the heck. Then comes the boom... the waiter now tells us no beer in a boot for us. I say read the words and I say no boot no burger give us menus back and he says ""R U Sure?"". I Sez ""I R!!"". He then said we can get a beer for 3.50 or some thing like that. I said read!! sooooo new order. Then manger man comes in with the same story on how it doesn't come with a beer if sharedddddddddoh. Refer to """"Read"""" so now he caves as  if he was doing us some favor when the reality was the bar was dead and nobody orders that burger that was just about ready and he knew where it was going. I don't type curse words, I do say them sometimes but I think it's an effort to type a curse word. Typing doesn't just slip out. That being said, We got our burger and beer in a boot. C'mon 50 bucks for a burger and he is sweating the beer money. You should get what you pay for in a service industry or never return. Food review part now...... The 8 pound burger maybe weighted that much but there was maybe 5 pounds of meat at best. It had cheese, tomatoes, onion that was grilled, jalapenos and lettuce with some kind of sauce. It was a bit salty and peppery at the same time. It came with a large pickle stuck with a toothpick on top. On the side we got sweet potato fries that had sugar and cinnamon on them. They came with marshmallow dipping sauce that was like pudding consistency. We cut the burger like cake and finished half between both of us and barely notched the fries. It was all good with no regrets but it wasn't worth 50 bucks. Me and my pets enjoyed the rest over the next day and are you wondering if I will ever order it again??? I will do the challenge alone and just enjoy the huge ridiculous 30 dollar dinner and leftovers while my wife drinks the free 32 ounce beer that i never even wanted since i don't drink beer !!!

My mother who goes to Vegas at least twice a year knew that they changed this joint and neglected to tell me.  Grrr.  It was one thing that the MC stopped the monorail years ago, but now there really isn't any reason to trek all the way down that corridor.  
The bf and I (who go to Vegas every Xmas) were all about the brewery in '06 and the shocking changes were none too appreciated.  
Ugh!  Yeah, the vats are still there so we ask what brews are on tap to which we got the ""duh, yer lookin' at 'em"" response.  Thinking that the older dude is new and clueless, I state that this is a microbrewery and he tells me that I'm so obviously wrong, never indicating exactly when these horrific changes came into effect.  
So, the new schtick is watery, overpriced domestics on tap, Justin Timberlake and other screechy pop crap blaring from the tvs, and rude, condescending bartenders.  Cool.  Looks like the MC Brewery is following Vegas' bar trend.
It really is a shame because I've been going there since '98 or so and the beers were consistently good.  The bartenders were competent and socially adept.  The music was a bit more eclectic and it was an oasis for me in a sea of ""Strip"" bar establishments.
Criminy!  Monte Carlo, you so disappoint.  Now there really isn't anything compelling to drag me into your casino.

Food items were also crazy expensive and were not that tasty! All I have to say is you might be disappointed in the mac and cheese (didn't seem too cheesy and somewhat bland) and the shrimp po boy (fell apart and was overly breaded). The vegetable flat bread was decent but nothing extraordinary. 

This place would be worth my time to watch a game during happy hour and for convenience. While the beer selection is massive and amazing, it's really not all that when most of them are bottled.

1669794,2009-12-21,3,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"During one fine ladies weekend in Vegas, it was decided that we'd meet at the pub to get some drinks in us and decide where to go from there. Some drinks turned into many drinks, a few bull rides, more country songs than I can count, and a couple of cowboys all in our business.

It so happened that our ladies weekend was running in tandem with the national rodeo finals weekend. The pub obliged and provided large plastic boots to fill with beer, a mechanical bull for silly drunk girls to ride, and a country band so that cowboys may drag you onto the dance floor to act a fool. My group of ladies obliged and tried a little of column A, B, and C.

The selection of beer was impressive. I would guess somewhere over 50 on tap and delicious. For $10 a boot, we thought the prices were almost equally impressive. There is a super long bar, so even though we had our share of waiting for a table, we had a place to sit, drink, and not really notice. There's a big stage where there is live entertainment, and that is always a plus.

After much debauchery, we were ready for some food, and that would be the only notable disappointment of the night. The food itself was delicious. The price at about $10-$15 per appetizer seemed acceptable. Then there was the quantity. Two egg rolls?  Four bite-sized quesadillas? A little on the slim side if you ask this girl.

I will have to see what it's like on a non-rodeo weekend, but I would say almost a solid 4, minus 1 for kid-sized appetizers at adult-sized prices.",gi9yQpVJj2Mps5SbBMMHSA,5,2,3,aU1isM9vAL1obktglxlxiw

We went in for dinner at 9:00 pm on Saturday night to hear the dueling pianos.  There were 5 of us and we weren't very hungry so ordered appetizers:  french fry trio, chicken quesadilla, nacho's, artichoke dip and a salad.  It was a lot of food and it was good.

The place was not busy at all, the piano players were asking for birthdays, anniversaries, etc so I wrote down it was my daughters 21st birthday with her name and put $3 or $4 dollars in the tip jar.  Didn't even request a song.  They never mentioned her even though they were begging for suggestions, etc.  

So my 'tip' would be to write down what you want and hand the piano player your ticket and money so he sees it.  Don't bother with anything less than $5 if you really want a song played.

2 piano players started and then swapped out 1 player for another and they duplicated a song which struck me as odd since they'd only been playing for about 45 minutes.

They were decent and fun but don't go if you want to talk and socialize because you can't hear anything.  Staff was nice and attentive even though we weren't drinking.

They have an interesting make your own burger like the Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay Resort  (with a lot less options) . My buddy concocted his own creation and commented it actually tasting better than the Burger Bar.  
The place can get quite busy and the service can get spotty.

Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong.

The first time I dined at The Pub was back in September, my boyfriend and I wanted to chill at the bar for a few hours before heading to the airport to go home. The plan was to sip on mimosas and bloodies while munching on appetizers to pass the time.

We approached the hostess stand where zero customers were waiting and two hostesses were chatting. We waited a full 2 minutes before one of them acknowledged us. Excuse me if I'm old fashioned but I find it ridiculous that they couldn't even say a simple ""We'll be right with you"" even if they weren't quite ready to seat us.

Despite the restaurant being 30% occupied we were told there would be a 45 minute wait. We browsed around inside and asked if we could take a seat at the bar to which they obliged.

Seated at the bar we waited yet another 5 minutes to be acknowledged by an unfriendly bartender. She served crappy food with an even crappier attitude.

Our experience with the food can be described in two words: underwhelming, and overpriced.

Fast forward two months to when we returned to Sin City for the Rock'N'Roll Marathon. We'd decided to reside at the Monte Carlo again for our trip, and the glorious whale logo and tease of the many seasonal beers on tap was too much to resist. ""Let's give it another shot!"" I begged my boyfriend. ""Please! I NEED to like this place!""

After finishing the half marathon and wanting nothing more than a beer and some comfort food, my boyfriend obliged. I was pleasantly surprised to find that we were greeted and seated right away. That's where the ""pleasant-ness"" ends.

Our waiter arrived at our table approximately 2 and a half centuries later to take our order. Having had ample time to memorize the menu, we decided it would be best to place our food and drink order right away, as we did not trust the waiter to return as often as we'd like.

We guessed correctly. The waiter returned 15 minutes later with two beers--NOT the beers we ordered, as they had run out of those, but the waiter had grabbed two other beers hoping we would like them. We accepted the beers, being unwilling to wait another 15 minutes for a beer of our choosing. 

The food, again, was unbearably mediocre and unworthy of the infrequency of waiter checkins we had to deal with to get it.

Fantabulous setting, sure helped me keep up with my fantasy players!  The Pub has a wide selection of brews, check out the expansive drink menu or better yet, just ask your knowledgeable server.  He suggested a couple of hefeweizens and we were excited to hear they offered the German Franziskaner Hefe Weiss.  The little one thought she was ultra cool with a Joe's root beer in the bottle.  BF was super-satisfied with the Cubano, which was filled with a good cut of pork roast with ham, unlike other places that skimp on the pork. Little one had the chicken tenders and fries, which she was happy, happy with, and she's pretty finicky.  My choice was the Reuben, on a nicely marbled rye with corned beef and pastrami, plus a nice addition of sauerkraut.

We were seated about 9:50 right in time for the games.  We saw a table flyer that looked appealing.  It was ""all you can eat and drink for 52.99"" plus tax and tip.  It was a little on the expensive side but it said until 4pm.  So we thought great.  We can get our money's worth.Paid and received our wristbands.  I couldn't of been more wrong.  The open buffet starts out with salad, scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, french toast, sausage, soggy wings, make-it-yourself nachos and pizza baking under powerful heat lamps.  The all you can drink special was only for bud light, bud and a couple other basic beers on tap.  You could also get skyy vodka basic drinks.  The beer wasn't very cold and you need to order 2 at a time because the server isn't coming back for at least 10 minutes.  We were told by the server that breakfast is over about noon and then lunch comes out.  So we waited because we weren't very impressed with the morning food.  So we continue to drink and the service is so slow which she knew she would be because when we were seated she told us that if we couldn't find her and needed something that we could get them at the corner bar.  Which was an extra inconvenience and more money since you always have to tip a person making your drink.   Which is what we ended up doing.  So about 2:00 comes and I go to see the new foods for the lunch and I see everything is the same and basically gone!  They still had soggy eggs left, and some hard chips.  We weren't very happy so we asked for a manager.  The manager came over to our table.  He said that the special is over at 2.  I said, that's not what this table flyer says and he claimed that our server should have told us it ended it at 2 and they are in the process of having new ones made.  I said, she didn't but that's ok.  Then I explained to him that I just wanted to express our complaints to you so maybe you can make this better for the next person.  He was a little defensive and kept harping on how they go from 8-2 now not 9-4. So I said, we were also told we had lunch that was supposed to come out.  You still have eggs and breakfast up there.  Well he admitted that was a mistake they should not have eggs out at 2pm.  So the only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because the manager did have 2 burgers brought out to us.  With that courtesy I didn't write a review either.  We paid the 120 and left our server that basically did nothing 25.00.  

So with all the managers promises we decided to go back the following week.  Because it is a great spot to watch some football.  They have the sound going and tvs to see all the games.  Well to our surprise the same table flyer was still there misleading saying from 9-4pm. Same food, same slow service.  For a strip hotel we are both very disappointed and won't be going back.  We ended up dropping another 150 this week.  We at least got to enjoy some of beers we enjoy by not doing the all you can drink special.  I wish they would just pick it up a notch because I would really enjoy this place.

We got a couch, three chairs, a table and a patio heater...so we were set up!  The deal was all you can drink domestic beers and well drinks from 8p-12a...no gimmicks, no catch.  In addition to that, and unbeknownst to us, they also came around constantly with the most amazing hors d'oeuvres and served us at our table.

2246833,2014-07-10,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"Came here because I had a voucher for a $100 bar tab during the Dueling Pianos from playing MyVegas on Facebook. I stopped in early in the day to see if I needed a reservation and the hostess was super friendly and told me no to just show up and that it was first come, first serve for seating (The voucher included VIP seating for the event). 

Pianos started around 9 but we didn't get there until about 11. The place was pretty empty and there was a new hostess. When I told her that I had the voucher she seemed very annoyed and told me only two people could use it. Really!? I mentioned that it did not state that anywhere and it would be crazy to expect two people to drink $100 worth of alcohol in an hour (they close at 12). She told me it was just for two and my friends (one other couple) would have to pay for all their drinks. I usually can hold my cool but this time I did get a little snarky with her and asked her how she was going to control me ordering for everyone and handing over ""my alcohol."" She ignored my comment and said well there's a seat at the bar for you. I then reminded her that the voucher indicated VIP seating to which she got huffy and marched us over to a table near the pianos.

By this time I was hot and about ready to just leave and forget the whole thing, however once a waiter came over, Timm, things turned around. He was great as as our other waiter (wish I could recall his name!) and gave me no issue with the voucher. He even gave us to-go cups when we still had money on our tab and they were getting ready to close. We left him a very nice tip due to his superior service. 

They have a large selection of beers, wine, and other specialty drinks. We tried several and enjoyed everything we tried. The pianos were decent, similar to others I've seen. They also had karaoke which was pretty entertaining this late at night:) The atmosphere of the place was nice but a little dark. The place was huge and very open.

All things considered I would go back, however they need to monitor their evening hostess, as she may be part of why it was dead when we were there. Vegas is a tourist town with tons of restaurants and bars; her behavior could easily send someone to another place.

2248506,2013-11-27,3,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"Hands down a very unfortunate let down. I was pretty excited to see that the hotel we were staying at, the Monte Carlo, had their very own pub to hang out in. I was even more excited when we were able to claim our free myVegas rewards for a BOGO beer flight. Everything was going great until we walked up to the counter on a early Friday night and the hostesses slurred their way through letting us know that we would have to wait about 15 minutes before we could be sat down. Wait... we gotta wait when this place is pretty empty?? That makes NO sense but whatever, we waited and they continued being pretty unprofessional while standing up their in their little desk area. The place was pretty loud but that's expected out of a pub so I was pretty excited again when I walked in. Unfortunately our waiter took forever and a day to come by our table to even just bring us the menu and he did so with such an unpleasant tone, constipated face that made me want to just want to get up and leave. Took our orders in and again took a long time for us to just get our beer flights. While waiting I noticed a few tables next to us getting filled up with customers that just walked in rather than wait to be seated. Not only did they just walk in, they also were helped faster than we were. Made me feel very unappreciated and unwelcomed. But how can that be??? This is suppose to be a fun, outgoing pub?? Insert huge sad face here. We get our flights and I am then informed that they are out of one of the beers I wanted and he gave me a different one that he chose. Well that sucked, that only made this place even worst. Needless to say, we pretty much just chugged our beers and tried to flag down the waiter again as fast as we could to get the hell out of there. It is Las Vegas after all!! There is way better places to explore and hang out in that this Pub. They also close pretty early. Long waits, poor customer service, unwelcoming, crappy place...

The first time I went there, we were seated by the hostess rather quickly. However, they were extremely crowded and we waited for 30 mins and the waiter never came to take our orders. We waited a little longer until my boyfriend couldn't take it anymore and insisted upon leaving; which I understood. So, we left hungry.

The second time we went there, we were excited to know that there was happy hour! There were advertisements all over the hotel that read ""$1 sliders at The Pub."" That sounded appetizing! We went there during the designated time. This time it was not as busy. We asked our waiter about the happy hour sliders and he told us that they were not on the happy hour menu. We explained that there were advertisements throughout the entire casino and hotel that said sliders were $1 during happy hour. Our waiter did not honor it. After we ate our food and asked for the check, the waiter told us that he asked his manager about the special and apparently there was some sort of miscommunication regarding the slider specials. He also told us that if we wanted to come back tomorrow, he would honor it. This upset me because I think he purposefully waited until we were finished eating to tell us.

The idle girls at the hostess's desk didn't notice us immediately because they were engrossed in conversation. When we were acknowledged the hostess saw our jerseys and looked on her chart for our team. She then said we have no seats near your team. Sorry! I ask how many tvs have our team (3) can you switch a different TV to our team (no), are there seats at the bar near a tv with our team (don't know). I brainstorm through all of this and ask her to show me the tvs. At the 2nd of 3 I see that there are indeed seats at the bar. There was also an empty 8-10 seat table but she said she couldn't put two people there. I don't see why they couldn't try a communal table. If other people watching our game arrive we'd all be happy to share a good view of the game. But no we squeeze in at the bar. I got the feeling that the hostess would have been fine with us leaving to find another bar option. 

The bar is very long, maybe 75ft of meandering wood with a padded edge (no purse hooks, sorry gals). But there are only 6 tvs viewable when facing the bar. To be clear, there's lots of tvs in the venue, but the bar's focus is the visually appealing keg display (pics attached) As far as I'm concerned this is wasted space, or at least ill-used. There's 20+ seats at the bar who cannot see any TV. If this is supposed to be a sports fan experience, it's a frustrating fail. 

I see tables with one person, likely to stay all day watching the games. They could've seated a couple with him and made more money, as well as happy customers. 

On the bright side, the football buffet was decent. Bbq chicken and ribs (ribs baked and not very flavorful), tasty buffalo wings, flat bread pizza, chili nachos, mac&cheese, salad, breakfast potatoes and scrambled eggs for $18. And bottomless booze for $35 more (bud, shock top orange, bloody Mary's and mimosas) or the combo of both for $45--not a bad deal on the strip. 

Another bright spot was the Irish bartender who was friendly, funny and fast--everything I want in a bartender. 

And the hotel offers fast free wifi, so we fired up our direct tv on the iPad and enjoyed our game.

The place has changed since I went a year ago.  Last time I went it was the Brew Pub, it concentrated on serving lots of beer for a relatively ""cheap"" (Vegas Standards).  I usually split a beer tower with a friend or two and get wasted.  Now this Pub is more like a traditionally restaurant.  Hands-Down, the food was much better than before.  My Wild Mushroom Swiss Burger was amazing:  Toasted bun covered in mayo with perfectly cooked medium rare burger topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion, mushrooms, and cheese.  However, THERE ARE NO MORE BEER TOWERS.  Instead I got a $10 PINT OF DRAFT ""SIGNATURE"" IPA BEER.  It was ridiculous, to put it in perspective, I got an Absolut® and Soda at the MGM Centrifuge Bar for $9.  Word to wise, eat but don't drink at the ""PUB"" unless a ten dollar pint is up your alley.",L7VEJP1RrpXRRRWsYIu3tA,1,0,2,E-1ZpM4JCDsIAmvhwH4QXg

The trio of fries was definitely not worth the $11 price tag, at least not for such a small quantity.  I'd think that $11 would get you enough fries to share among our table of 4 girls, apparently not.  The mesquite fries were the best, they were crisp and seasoned well.  The sweet potato and regular fries were a disappointment because they were extremely soggy.

They have some pretty fun alcoholic float options but I wish they'd advertise that out on the patio.  It was a semi-ly different menu menu inside.  They also have a beer sampler combo which I liked but it was much too early for me to start drinking haha =T

However, they get 1 star for having crappy management because they are always understaffed the past 3 years I've brought my groups of 50+ there. The manager two years ago who did a terrible job was replaced this year with another assistant manager who does an equally terrible job. For the past three years in a row I've had my UK alumni club and out of town fans watch games here. The first two years they didn't guarantee us volume but we got it because we came there in large numbers to bring them all sorts of revenue buying overpriced beer and food for going there twice (understandable seeing it is the Vegas strip). This year, they fed us a bunch of crap on how they could not give us volume as they are managed by MGM/Monte Carlo's sports book and have no precedence on channel/game preference. However, some of my members went to the sports book and the game was on with full volume. I knew these guys were knucklehead idiots because the audio receiver and DirecTV boxes were located right in the front left of the restaurant and it's a simple change of the channel from in there.

On the flipside, they do cater with various happy hours during the week from 3-6 as well as give locals a discount card which should help out.

The beer list was awesome and the food I ordered was all great. The service was also timely and attentive. Even on Friday and Saturday nights the place never got too busy so we could actually hear each other talk.

Singing karaoke along with the pianos was a blast. Each night there were different piano players and different hosts. Karaoke runs from 9-12. Sometimes the piano players would just sing themselves, and every few songs they'd call someone from the crowd up to sing. The song books were quite short but there were enough songs to pick from. 

My only issue with this place was the host the second night. He would NOT let me and my friend sing! We were first on the list but for three hours he kept skipping over us. I even went up and gave him $10 tip to no avail. The thing that really irritated me was there was no queue of singers. He kept announcing ""we need more singers, come on up!""

The Happy Hour (HH)specials looked fantastic and when I saw those burgers dripping happy meaty juices on people's plates as we walked by and their BYOB (Build Your Own Burger)menu I knew this place was meant for us. So today, on a whim, we went to The Pub and left feeling just, ""Meh."" 

My fiance may have a different opinion, but when I was just not impressed. We started with the nachos. We saw pictures on Yelp and they looked delicious. They came to the table and oh no, cheese sauce. Oh fake cheese sauce. I have several pet peeves when it comes to my food, and I do not pay $14 for somewhat stale tasting chips drowned in cheese sauce. There was some real cheese on these nachos, but the overwhelming appearance of crap fake cheese sauce turned me off. The guacamole I yoinked from the top though was AMAZING and perfect in every way. The nachos seemed confused though, and any avid nacho eater like myself needs nachos to be worth the 2000 calories per plate.

Since we ate outside, I felt like a Cobb salad. My fiance got the 12 buffalo wings. First, his buffalo wings looked pretty darn delicious, and he said they were somewhere in taste between Hooters and BWW (the man has an obsession with the ""wings"" at Hooters, ha!), but to me, they looked great. The presentation was on a wood cutting board, two dressings and carrots and celery. VERY little grease on the board and they looked crispy and juicy. Nicely done. This is part of the reason why they received the 3 stars.

I will take a deep breath before speaking about my Cobb salad. I have been spoiled by the Cobb salad at Wildfire back in the Chicago area, because this Cobb was disheartening. I did not expect something gourmet, but for $17 I would expect lots of Cobb salad ingredient happiness. This Cobb had the grilled chicken placed on top of a salad that I had to toss in order to find any of the ingredients listed on the menu. Avocado? A few pieces. Bacon, barely one slice cut up in the salad. Goat cheese? Two chunks. Tomato? A decent amount chopped up in the salad. Vinaigrette? PERFECT. The salad was just bland. Nothing exciting. Cobb salads are not supposed to be healthy at all, and this one WAS healthy and in the bad way. For $17, this dish is something I could too easily make at home. No bueno.

Service? Decent. Nothing exciting, but decent. We are not high maintenance eaters, so it should not have been anything too intense. Amidst my salad and nacho disappointment, we are going to go back and attack some burgers. A BYOB Kobe beef burger situation? Yes, let's do it. 3 stars may turn into 4 stars if their burgers are as good as the restaurant Monte Carlo advertises in every Vegas brochure imaginable.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,3,qhUA7LP0I7KvY9UJIwcnPQ

It's a great place to watch football with multiple TVs around the restaurant and lots of high-top tables around the bar. The food is typical bar fare, but they also offer flatbread (my friend ordered the short rib and goat cheese flatbread and it was good). They have an impressive beer selection on tap. Horrible service and never busy. If your looking for a place to watch the game and grab some fairly inexpensive bar food this is it. 

Both times I have visited The Pub I have ordered the wings. I was nervous the first time, seeing as the wings are listed as ""classic wings"" on the menu. I didn't think they would be spicy enough for my taste, but I they packed a punch, and I liked them enough to order them again two months later. Decent blue cheese and ranch... pretty typical for a bar. 

Condiment recommendation: Red Pepper Remoulade 

I first discovered the red pepper remoulade during my first visit. It came on the crab cakes and it is amazing!

Another plus is the sides they have.  You can get your fries prepared several ways, one of my favorite is the sweet potato fries that include a marshmallow dipping sauce.  
My parents enjoy this place because of all the beer which is on tap.

If they aren't showing a game here than chances are they have the dueling pianos which will play all your favorite songs for a little gratutity.  Nothing like having a live juke box on site.

Ate here last night with family... there was 6 of us.

Service: 2 stars... they weren't *that* busy... maybe 1/3 of the tables were sat... and when the server asked us if we were ready to order... he walked away and attended to another table and came back 5 minutes later... and then when we ordered 1..yes... 1 appetizer... the wrong one came out... so we had to wait even longer for the 1 appetizer... and then when we ordered our drinks... he brought them out one by one rather than all at once... very strange.

Ambiance: Nice bar with high top tables and regular tables... TVs everywhere so if there's a game on... you can watch it

Food Menu: 4 stars on creative burger selection

Taste:  3 stars... the appetizer we ordered (Ancho Chili Shrimp) was 'eh'.  Nothing much going on taste wise... it just tasted like shrimp with burnt seasoning... my chopped salad was very good... but it's pretty hard to mess up a salad... another ordered the meatball flatbread.. again... Nice!  Burgers were juicy and big... with lots of fries which the guys really liked.  A couple guys ordered the sliders and they seemed big for 'sliders'... and you got 3 of them... so it filled you up.

Beer: 4stars...  Seems like they had quite a few beers to choose from... and you could put your own 5-beer sampler together... each was about a 5oz pour... so you got a good taste of each one that you sampled

Price: it's a strip joint... so expect to pay a bit more just cuz it's in a strip hotel... but it's not ridiculously priced... for 6 of us with tip it was $195 (so...$32.50 pp and we all ordered a beer or 2 or in some cases 3.)

The place was packed and the service was stretched to their limits, but our waiter did a pretty solid job.

I had the Italian Burger, Pretty much imagine if Bruschetta and a hamburger had a delicious baby. 

They also have several french fry options. I chose the mesquite fries and I have to say it was the best decision I ever made. I was expecting fries covered in some sort of BBQ sauce, and when they were delivered I was surprised that looked like normal fries, but when I tried one I became one happy fat kid.

You know when you have a bag of BBQ potato chips, and you get to the end of the bag and in the bottom there are those little chip peaces and BBQ flavoring dust that is so good you want to cut it into a line and snort it? Well these french fries are covered in that seasoning. I'm pretty sure I could eat nothing but these for the rest of my life and be one happy guy...dare I say the best fries in vegas

wow I just wrote 2 paragraphs about the fries...they are that damn good!

I will be going back any time I find myself over on that end of the strip.

Oh and for an added bonus, it's next to the pool so there is some delicious eye candy to go with your meal!!!",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,4,2,4,T3fS_AdEiD0Ds4n1h02fag

The Islanders were playing the Rangers...ads for 2 for 1 drinks were all around....$1 sliders and wings were the kicker...it was time to hit up The Pub for Happy Hour.
TEASE 1
Quickly you see on the menu 'select beers' for the 2 for 1 special.  I get it.  The place has an encyclopedia of beers and some of them are expensive.  Then the bartender told me the happy hour beer selection....Miller, Coors, Bud.  Really?  Not even some of the various domestic taps you have??  Even with a special how can you go to a place like this and get a Bud Light.  
TEASE 2
Ordered 5 sliders for $1 each as advertised.  Score.  They came out and were exactly the size of a munchkin.  Fail.  The people next to us at the bar giggled at the sight of these little burgies.  One bite wonders.
TEASE 3
I'm not sure if this one is even a tease.  $1 wings.  That doesn't even seem like a deal.  Ok, maybe if they are big Dinosaur BBQ style wings $1 makes sense, but they are not. They are just your average sized buffalo wings. $.10-.25 wings is a good happy hour special for these.

My party of two arrived at about 10:15 am for breakfast. There was only one other woman who was seated and seamed to be waiting. The hostess said the wait would be about five minutes, so we said okay cool. 

During the alleged ""5-minute"" wait, we went to the shop directly across the pub and did a few minutes of window shopping - we returned to the pub, and the hostess apologetically says ""the kitchen is backed up so the wait will now be around 20 minutes."" We are patient people so we say ""fine"" and head back to the clothing store across from the pub to shop and kill time. After about 15 minutes passes, we proceed back to the pub, the woman that was sitting alone earlier was still waiting and now there's an even bigger crowd of people waiting to be seated. 

To our surprise, the hostess approaches our party AGAIN and tells us the kitchen is still backed up and it may be another 25 minutes, then she suggests we go to the buffet at Monte Carlo! If we wanted to eat at that buffet - we would not have been waiting outside the Pub for 30 minutes. 

Nevertheless, we keep our name on the list to be seated and go to check out the buffet the hostess suggested. We went, checked it out, and decided to wait to be seated at the pub for breakfast. 

When we get back, it's now coming up on the 11 o'clock hour and the hostess informs us that the menu changes at 11am and breakfast will no longer be served. We finally walk away, and never intend on trying that place again.",ne5HeKchzMXRlrpbTHGRpQ,1,0,1,GwPHetF6_PBKQLUtI0bHBQ

My husband LOVES to try new beers and this place has a sick beer list. They were running a Happy Hour from 3-6pm and we literally could not wait for 3 to roll around so we could come here. 

Upon arriving, the hostess seemed almost annoyed to greet us. We asked if we could sit outside and she said ""yes"" and never took the initiative to show us to a table so we just ventured over there on our own. Once we got to the patio, we saw that all but two of the tables with umbrellas were already taken BUT those open tables were completely covered in dirty dishes and glasses. I guess it was for the best because the music blaring from the pool area was so unbelievably loud that we wouldn't have been able to hold a conversation anyways, yet alone relax.  So back inside it was. This place is HUGE and there was maybe  15 people in there. We weren't sure where to sit so my husband politely asked a bartender if there was somewhere in particular we should sit and in THE MOST RUDE AND SNOTTY TONE he replies, ""This bar is closed. Go to the other side."" To be honest, I was in shock that he responded like that, especially after the rudeness we received from the hostess. We walk a little further and my husband turns to me and says, ""You know what, I don't want to spend our money here after how we have been treated."" I COMPLETELY AGREED and we left without spending a penny.

Such a shame. We were really looking forward to this place. The Pub needs to train their employees on customer service. I don't care if the customer is the biggest ass ever (which we totally are not), what happened to service with a smile??",kiHby7Jotm24QDM3SB32LA,4,0,1,TqmaCm0TTdk2Iu9MpysKEQ

After being seated, we were greeted by a waiter who did not seem very happy about his job.  We asked about he milkshakes, and he looked so confused.  We said ""its on your menu outside???""  Then he just turned around and walked away.  Now I am confused.  He walked outside to look at the menu, then came in and said, oh we dont server those anymore.  I was like ""well you might wanna look at taking them of your menu""

Anyway, we were there so we ordered some warm pub pretzels with cheese and mustard and a beer and a coke.  10 minutes later, we got the pretzels.  But no drinks :(  A few minutes later, here come the drinks.  The pretzels were ok, but nothing to write home about and the mustard was just yellow mustard squeezed from a bottle.

I love how the decor was so bright with the nice ocean blue color, and the brands of beer, and photos around the restaurant. The type of vibe I got was sort of a bar with their wooden chairs and tables and open area where you can see people walking by. The workers where really nice and very fast at delivering and taking our orders. 

I ordered the ""bone-in rib-eye"" which came with a huge rib-eye with the bone, mashed potatoes and some greens. The mash potato was really good, I know because I ate it all. My rib-eye was also on point! Very juicy, full of flavor and that thing was so huge that I still had extra to go. This huge plate was only $23 not bad for a lot of food. My girlfriend ordered the ""Pub burger"" for $14 which is a huge burger, your choice of vegetables and type of bun (potato) but what makes the burger special is the ""secret sauce"" that they use. The burger was so huge that even divided by three we would still not have eaten it all. And my other friend ordered the buffalo wings with blue cheese as a dipping sauce for $12. The wings where also huge and really juicy with lots of meat! Everything here was good and for a reasonable price. We didn't try the beer or drinks but I'm sure they where good too.

Fast forward to my last visit in 2010. It's a lot more...douchy. I'm not sure what made them make such a drastic change. The place used to smell of hops and malt (which smells like burnt wet oatmeal if you haven't had the pleasure). Now, it's just like any sports bar on the strip. Gone are the tanks, the smell of brewing beer, and that brewpub feel.

And it is freaking expensive. Unless you make it for Happy Hour - which unfortunately we were too early for. I talked this place up and was sorely disappointed by the changes. I really had no reason to come to the Monte Carlo other than this spot. We had to walk through that hotel/casino that smelled like old lady perfume. I had such a headache after that adventure.

I was pleasantly surprised that some games are even played with sound.

The main downside is ho-hum service. The Eastern European hostess' bad attitude can only be attributed to either several decades living in a Stalin era gulag or having a small mammalian creature lodged in her distal colon.

We sat on the patio overlooking the lazy river and it just had a very relaxed vibe. I could have stayed there all day. 

We ordered 2 plates to share. The southwest skillet with scrambled eggs, chorizo and potatoes and the carrot cake pancakes with citrus cream cheese.  The skillet was a little small and pretty average in taste but those pancakes were killer.

We stopped here because there wasn't a soul in there and it looked to be fast. Couldn't have been more wrong. We have a group of 8 and the hostess states immediately that we can't split bills for parties 8 or bigger. Which is not true. So we ask if we can split into groups of 4 and eat, she says that's not possible. Also not true.

We are seated together and wait at least 15 minutes to get waters and a drink order. Keep in mind not a soul in here. The waitress is back talking to her friend near the bar. Cool. So we order our food, from a relatively limited menu of burgers pizza and sandwiches. No joke, waited an hour and a half for the food. When I got my cubano sandwich, which was deli ham and pork on a bun, it was cold. Whatever. It's Vegas and I'm starving so I eat it. It's edible so one star there. 

When we go to check out the waitress says she can split the bill, proceeds to ask all of us for our cards. Disappears for 20 minutes, comes back and asks us for our IDs. Disappears for another 20. Comes back with only two of the cards ran. What are you doing back there?!

Some people in my group raise hell and get the manager. She took our drinks off the bills as a consolation. But in all honesty we should have eaten for free this is so bad. And the two people (one of which was me) had already gotten their cards ran for full price.

Everyone was generally unhelpful with an attitude. Not a great way to rep your casino. But when your rooms are cheaper than anywhere else on the strip you can do whatever you please apparently. 

Pros: not a bad beer list. $5 pints of Leffe blonde Belgian beer is way way cheaper than anything you can find in Vegas with alcohol in it.

We all ordered drinks just sodas and waters. A different waiter brought out the drinks and it turned out they forgot to bring one of our drinks. Since the waitress did not appear to check if everything was ok we tried to hunt down another server. We finally found a server and when we told her our  server missed our drink she acknowledged us but in a rude ""its not my table"" way.  I guess she went and told our other waitress and she came back.  Just to add all of the sodas were flat too. Well after that our food came out as I said I ordered a hamburger with sweet potato fries.

I had a regular burger when I was here.  I was not blown away or anything, but it was juicy, cooked well, and there was nothing off about it.  The fries were okay as well.

Our waitress in the morning (didn't catch her name, she's worked here for 21 years) was fantastic and took great care of us. That changed dramatically in the afternoon. We waited for over 30 minutes for the new server, Saul, to check on us. He never came back after the first time.

Since it's a busy day we shared our long table with another party. We were clear from the start that we weren't together. They had to go order drinks from the bar due to Saul's neglect. When we finally flagged Saul down for the check it arrived with an added 18% gratuity. When I asked why he said it's because we have a party of 8. I explained that we're not together and hadn't been charged the gratuity on the first check. He said it didn't matter because we're all sitting at the same table.

Starting with host. There were a lot of open tables, yet they made us wait. I understand that why they do it, but I don't like it when they don't properly explain. 
Regardless after a short wait they took us to our table. We didn't realize that it was a piano karaoke bar now. If we had realized we probably would have chose another venue, but what can you do? 
The dueling piano bar singers were average at best. The host is super cheesy, but surprisingly the karaoke singers were quite good. 
Food. My friend's split nachos and said they were delicious. Mac and cheese was also pretty good. 
They have a pretty good happy hour. It says it's M-F from 3p-6p, but apparently if you are local and sign up for some kind of reward card you get hh anytime.

We had a nice, low key dinner here after a busy day.  The Mac n' Cheese really hit the spot for me, and the bartender seemed knowledgable about the beer menu.  I find a lot of servers just say ""everything is good"",  which isn't very helpful.  She was able to articulate details about the flavors of the beers which helped me make a choice I enjoyed! The prices also seemed more reasonable than some of the other dinner options we looked at.  It's bar food!  I love grease as much as the next tourist, but it shouldn't break your wallet.

Some potential cons, depending on your tastes:

If you're not into sports, this may not be your place.  The inside is filled with big tvs playing whatever game is on.  We hate sports, and were so glad we chose to sit at the bar (just to be served quickly) where we weren't immersed in game noise and screaming bros.
Shortly after we arrived, they started doing their piano bar karaoke night.  Again, NOT our thing!  So glad we were at the bar and well away from the host, who was desperately trying to get some audience participation out of the people inside who probably just wanted to watch tv. You may want to ask what the event for the night is before you find yourself seated in the middle of this.

Definite Con:
The young hostess was an asshole.  I stood a foot in front of her, plain as day, and asked nicely to be put on the waiting list for a table. It was as if I were a ghost.  She just looked right through me, past me, around me, and then kept straightening up the menus at the hostess stand.  It felt like I was being told I wasn't cool enough for her to bother with or something. After stating several times that I would like to get on the waiting list, she finally responded with ""There's a wait.  Do you want to be on the list?""  HELLO??? Clearly, 8th grade graduation is not mandatory for hires.  After a few more communication blunders, we just had her seat us at the bar (which ended up being a good choice).

I ordered coffee and eggs Benedict.  The coffee was okay but $3.25.  The eggs Benedict (which was said to be amazing) was awful.  It was DRENCHED in salt.  I almost couldn't eat it.

Our waitress approached and was fake and uninterested from the time she made contact. We ordered our beer flights picking out some of their more popular options and six $1 sliders (was told offer was no longer valid but was honored). After a while the flights and sliders arrived. Sliders were awful with burger cold and buns hard and more disappointingly several of the beers were lifeless (lines were being worked on). I can't express enough how bad this waitress was. I could have dealt with the flat beer and cold sliders but this waitress' demeanor was horrid, by far making a bad experience much worse.   

To be honest I tweeted about my experience and the Monte Carlo immediately responded requesting more information which I provided. 2 days later the manager on duty during our visit responded directly to me apologizing for our service, food and drink experience. She extended an offer to replace the flights and a free appetizer during our next visit. I will take her up on that offer and update my post.

We were there on a Monday night, and the place was packed because of the Duke/Butler NCAA Championship game.  Everyone was watching the game there and enjoying their beers.  My coworkers watched the game from there as well, and I joined them after the game.  Luckily, the place cleared out after the game, and we got our food pretty quickly.

Their motto is ""Food You Can't Forget; Drinks You Can't Remember"".  I would actually agree.

I ordered an oven baked pizza - Chicken, Asparugus, & Fontina Cheese and one of my coworkers ordered a Margherita (which I took a small slice to try).  Both were really good (and recommended by our waiter, Jose).  Definitely exceeded my expectations of a place that's called ""The Pub"".

Not bad considering it's a bar and not retail, and that I've paid twice that for a bomber retail (FF Eclipse as one example) Still a solid place, being on the strip. 

Craft beer oasis on the strip. However,  rememberthat when your there, this bar is in a Mega Casino in Las Vegas on the strip, I'd recomend visiting during the afternoon, or lunch time hours. At night, or during say a Pay per view fight, or March Madness, it's a very different experience, and the bar can get VERY VERY crowded. 

My wife and I stopped in for lunch, and took our time looking over the beer menu, which has over 70 taps on it. A large amount, as you would imagine, are macro's, with some great exceptions though. We both ordered the Russian Imperial Stout from ""Fox"", which is a local brewery to Las Vegas, and based in Neveda. The Russian Imperial Stout was quite good too actually. We followed that up with another RIS from Tenaya Creek, also very good. 

The bartender was pretty cool chatting us up, and even said when we inquired about the happy hour speical that started a few hours later ""Please, why would I insult you, your drinking $9 beers"" which we both thought was funny, and a good point. It is vegas, so the pints were not super cheap, but I've paid more than that, and I apprecaited the sentiment that both he and us knew what quality beer was. 

The food was very good too, and recomended for lunch, the sandwiches have a lot of flavor, which being vegetarian, I really appreciated.

LOCATION

Located inside of the Monte Carlo... on the public indoor pathway between their shops. It's huge inside... one of the first things you notice is 300+ beers on tap along the looooong bar counter which stretches atleast 100 feet.

There's a ton of TV's and tables inside... their maximum capacity has got to be like 500+. This place is huge.

FINAL THOUGHTS

So obviously I loved the $1 sliders. 

If you're balling on a budget and it's between 3 - 6pm, definitely swing by cause those bad boys will satiate you for $5-$10. The regular food was pretty damn expensive so if you're looking to spend a decent amount of $$$ for food I'd pass. Definitely a good spot to watch a game and grab a beer cause their beer menu was expansive. One of the largest I've ever seen. But yeah... come for the $1 sliders... not much else cause they're pricey. Even my 10oz. Hofbrau Hefeweizen was $8.00 :-/",1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA,4,2,3,4HW70ZJ1bfGfLe7oeLgUPQ

4024654,2010-09-12,5,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"(short review alert!)

During the Vegas trip the guys wanted to hit up a bar...  Being a Vegas veteran knowing that there really isn't any ""stand along bars"" available so decided to check it out.  (Most of the bars in Vegas are infused into the casinos as a Bar/Lounge style next to the slots)  The pub's got a cool logo of a whale with fire coming out of it's blowhole so I guess that was the draw of my attention.  (I enjoy these little things)

Once we were here, we noticed that it was more of a restaurant than an actual bar.  The place was wide open with decent decor, dim lighting, and dark furniture around the facility.  Since we were looking for a bar and my friends were more disappointed because it wasn't an actual bar (and actually wasn't crowded at all), so we decided just to have quick bite to eat instead.

Ordered chicken quesadilla with mango sauce, calamari with 2 sauces, and nachos...Quesadilla was great... I mean, how can you go wrong with tortilla, chicken, cheese, and sweetened sauce?  An easy and safe choice.  Calamari was fried to perfection with decent sauce accompanied with the dish.  Nachos were humongous in portion, but it was overly salty and the cheese looked fake... so the nachos wasn't a hit at all.

We didn't get any drinks as we were really looking forward to a bar, so after the meal immediately we left the pub so that we can get some drinks in our system.  The entire meal (appetizers) cost us almost $40 so it's not a cheap meal by any means, but I guess you are paying just like the whale with the fire out of the blowhole....(is that why he is burning inside?)

I may or may not come back to this place... some entertainment was happening on stage but it wasn't really grabbing anyone's attention so perhaps Monte Carlo have to rethink their strategy by having this place within their facility.  It's just another another mid-high priced restaurant with mediocre food...

The first time:   My gf and I were looking for a spot that was showing Monday Night Football, and we were staying at the Monte Carlo so we figured we'd hit up their happy hour and watch the game.  We sat at the bar-- staff was nice... but slow.  I ended up getting the $1 wings- which were actually pretty good.  My gf ended up getting the nachos for us to share.  Meh.  Not great.  The nachos had green peppers on them, and what tasted like cheez whiz on the chips... I'm not a fan of either... so I wasn't thrilled.  We ended up drinking more than we ate-- which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we did go for dinner and drinks.  It was what it was-- not great, not terrible.  And the decor is actually very appealing.  I can see why people would want to go in and order food.  It's a sports bar away from home.  

The second time:  So we ended up going back a few days later... again because we were staying in the hotel.  We figured that the first experience was not the ""greatest"" because we hit up happy hour.  This time was going to be different.  We were going to order REAL food.  We ended up ordering artichoke dip and Margarita Flat bread.  The artichoke dip was actually good.  I even said, ""I'm glad we gave this place a 2nd chance.""  I was so happy that I even ordered an IPA that was on tap... figuring that we would stay here for a little while.  The IPA came out... the food was good... we were just waiting for our flatbread.... waiting... waiting... waiting... Beer is gone.  Artichoke Dip is getting tiresome... still waiting... FINALLY 40 minutes and we have a Flatbread.
Me:  It looks good babe, how does it taste?
Her:  It's cold.  The cheese is cold.  The crust is cold.
Me:  Are you kidding me?
Her:  No.  Have a bite.
I do... and it is cold.
Her:  I'm sending this back... and we are going.
Me:  *Sigh* Okay.
The waitress is super nice and sends it back.  She had no questions, she just apologized and asked if we wanted something else.  We reply no thank you.  The waitress brings our check... and that YUMMY IPA that I had-- is starring back at us with a $10 charge.  Over. It.  Now, I'm not one to b*tch about a bill but..... we had (1) Artichoke Dip, (1) Miller Lite, and (1) IPA-- Bill was $32.

There are lots of TVs, so even though it is not a sports bar, there are plenty of games on the tube.  The burgers were good, though I think the buns were a little too big.  The nachos were tasty, and the hot wings actually had some heat.

On the negative side, the other entrees seemed lacking.  The steak was reasonably priced, but it was pretty flavorless.  The dueling pianos never did duel, just took requests and played songs.  depending on who is up there, and they rotate so there are always a pair playing (at least when we were there) they range from fair to decent, but that is about it.

The turkey was like lunch meat. With some onion mayo it was a nice sandwich. Not outstanding though. Last but not least was dessert. We ordered a rocky road brownie with five spoons.

I think what my problem was, was that I ordered the burger the way they have it listed on the menu, which is with minimal toppings. Onions, aioli, lettuce. something like that. I suppose that's to enhance the flavor of the meat itself, which of course is what is supposed to be happening. I shoulda done the build-your-own which comes with every different meat choice, a bunch of cheeses, all kinds of veggie options, too many sauces, and choice of a ton of breads. 
The pub itself is pretty cool, though, with more tap beers than you can count and they have root beer on tap, too! they dont brew their own but it's still pretty damn good that way. I dont know what root beer it was (shoulda done my homework before writing this review) but it didn't taste bitter or too licorice-y, and it wasn't too sweet as well.

At about noon the We Don't Hate Fun club sauntered in and were promptly seated.  This is a great time to show up, since not more than 30 minutes later the place was packed with college football fans.  However, the service was still top notch -- we even got one of the TVs changed to the loser game we were following -- and we were definitely in good hands.

The food was decently priced and came in large servings.  There's a pretty extensive menu that's guaranteed to satisfy any palate.  But let's be reasonable -- the true selling point of our afternoon was the $29.95 all you can drink special from 11am-3pm.  As my friend so succinctly observed, ""Are you serious?  That place lost money on you and Craig alone.""

Basically there is a bartender serving the hard stuff.  Tip him/her consistently and you'll get the generous pours (which I suppose doesn't really serve as a perk when it's all you can drink, but hey, when you're a fat lazy ass like yours truly, it saves a trip or two).  Then you arrive at the smorgasbord of mixers -- every juice you can think of, a gigantic bowl full of Monster energy drinks, a shrine made entirely of Bud Light, a garnish bar that looks more inclusive than many a Vegas buffet, and the piece de resistance -- a complete Bloody Mary spice/veggies table, with hot sauces and Worcestershire sauces and even fresh horseradish, oh my!

I remember at one point in the afternoon just sitting back, attempting to hold my head up, and just soaking in the awesomeness of the scene.

Apparently we were the only ones passing, because we got extra special service after that.  (not that anyone was ignored, they were just really attentive).  I started with a chocolate stout and husband had a draft of something like Hoegarden or Stella.  The menu is nicely arranged by type of beer and realy helps you narrow the amazing amount of selections.  

After that round, I saw that they had both Stella and Matilda on tap, so we got those and got one free because I had the end of the tap - totally not necessary, but very appreciated.

We also ran into a couple next to us who were from the Chicagoland area and they asked us all about what we were having, but were the typical budget happy hour folk and got nasty Coors Lights and some $1 sliders.

Was feeling a bit parched so we stopped in here for a cool refreshing beverage, (or two, or four), and a bite to eat while simultaneously taking a break from our financial downfall. (Contrary to popular belief, I cannot live on beer and gambling alone).

We both decided on the turkey / avocado clubs and sweet, (and I do mean sweet), potato fries. I started off with a 22 oz. Firestone Walker IPA, (draft of course), and while I've tried it before, it was exceptional... (Maybe it was the buzz???).

Our club sandwiches came and they were uber tasty, especially when, (dumbass that I am), I put the marshmallow sauce intended for the fries on it by mistake!!! Seriously, I thought that shit was ranch dressing, but boy am I glad I'm ""visionally impaired"", lol.

Which takes me to the sweet potato fries... Doused in a delectable sugar / cinnamon mix, these babies are friggin' good. Once you dip those little shits in the creamy marshmallow dipping sauce that accompanies them, you have effin' died and gone to heaven!!! Probably went thru a months worth of caloric intake at that bar but I really didn't give flyin' f*ck. I had died on gone to pub bar ""food heaven"".

Drinks were 2-for-1, with wings and sliders both going for a buck. Not too shabby. We each ordered a drink not really thinking it would be 2-for-1 on whatever we each got, meaning it wasn't buy-one-get-one. No biggie, it isn't like we came here to take it easy. 

The wings here are really good. I'm particular about my wings - I like a crispy exterior with only a light-to-medium dousing of sauce. I detest slimy wings that are all mushy and texture-less. These rocked. I'd suggest sticking with the classic buffalo flavor. The garlic variety were way too powerful, which normally wouldn't bother me but it was a faux garlic taste. If you're doing happy hour pricing, maybe get a couple to check them out but I wouldn't do a whole order unless you know you like them. 

The sliders are simple - meat, cheese, bun. They were a bit dry, but a nice dollop of mustard can clear that right up. 

We also got an order of the mesquite fries. We would've gotten sweet potato, but they come with cinnamon and sugar on them, which sounds more like a dessert than anything else. And I don't do dessert fries, sounds like something fat people order to combine two of their favorite things. Mesquite fries tasted like BBQ chips but in the body of a fry. Not quite sure I liked them all that much.

So what makes this place just ""OK""? Well, like many others have said, it's just kind of overpriced for what it is.

The menu is sub-par, and the beers are alright but I liked it much better when they used to brew their own beer & give it to you in the yard taps at the table. The servers are nice & personable, but the food is WAY overpriced - and if you go during happy hour for beer, they charge almost 19 percent for a 'live entertainment tax' since they have a band during that time (except they fail to let you know that BEFOREHAND). If you want to get your money's worth during happy hour, I'd suggest you bring a bunch of girls with you because they get free all-you-can-drink Miller 64 and/or certain vodka concoctions.

We decided to take advantage of the happy hour special ($3 off draft beer) while waiting for my sister and her friends to meet up with us. Since it was also on special we decided to order some munchies as well. 

It took a while to flag down a bartender and when we did he rushed off the happy hour specials as he walked away. When we caught him again we ordered two beers, which were brought over promptly and were a good price for Vegas. Then we made the colossal mistake of ordering food. We ordered the chicken fingers and fries as well as some boneless wings to split. The chicken finger basket (normally $14) came with 4 small chicken fingers and fries so over done they snapped apart when you tried to bend them. The wings were marginally better but still on the level of microwaved frozen wings. We left about 2/3 of our food untouched, which no one questioned.

The bartender closed us out before our food even arrived but then I had to flag him down after we finished our meal since he still hadn't taken my card. Then again because the check came back without a pen (and no it was not busy). He seemed like a nice guy but for some reason service was just really difficult to get at this bar. 

To be fair there was a huge selection of beer on tap and the $3 off made it some of the cheapest drinks we had in Vegas but the food was definitely the worst of the trip.",wbvjiDpw0FoZDeqbzAIcDQ,2,0,2,c4gBdd2yp1sc2sC393Igcw

A Guiness was called for since it was St Paddy's day but also it was March Madness and after my beloved Wildcats proceeded to get their butts kicked I did end up drinking quite a few other beers whose names I can not recollect. Their selection is huge but skews more toward the pale ales and they didn't have many of the darker beers that I like. Overall it is a great place to watch a game.

Now everything has changed.

Yeah, they still serve beer in giraffes (large long tubes that have a spout) which are really just creatively designed pitchers that serve more to let everyone know you intend to drink your weight in beer than anything else.  Now it appears their house brew is the Sin City Stout, which tastes more like a awful version of Beamish.  Yeah, they have a decent selection of beers still but nothing original and definitely nothing you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else.

It was around 5:30PM on a Saturday when we arrived and although it was a busy weekend for Las Vegas (college basketball tournaments, St. Patrick's Day), they weren't busy and we were able to grab two seats at the bar right away.

The bartender was nice and relatively attentive (we didn't need much attention). We glanced at their food and beer menus and ordered within a few minutes. The draft prices were decent for the strip and we were pleased with our selections. 

I chose the Mayan Steak Salad ($15) to munch on something light. I ordered the steak medium rare and the salad came with baby spinach (not listed), red onion, jicama, cherry tomato, canned Mandarin orange (listed as just orange), roasted corn, avocado, and cumin vinaigrette. The steak was cooked appropriately, but lacked any kind of flavor. The salad was sad and not worth $15. They tried though and the description seemed promising. I'm sure they do ""bar food"" well (or at least I'd hope), but if you're going to sell a salad for $15, it better be good.

We visited The Pub when it first opened in Fall 2009 (after revamping itself from ""Brewpub"" with a seven-month hiatus) and both enjoyed our experience. However, we hadn't been back because we rarely find ourselves in Monte Carlo. I'm not sure if things have changed since then, but I didn't order anything fried and/or greasy this time to make a fair comparison.

I've never visited The Pub for its food. It's their beer menu that pulls me in time and again.

The beer menu is several pages long and offers you a choice of about 200 different beers. The selection is categorized by type, so you can quickly find an amber ale, some barleywine, a Belgian abbey-style ale, a Hefeweizen, an IPA or a lager. It always takes me a good 15 minutes to scan through its many offerings and decide what I want to drink, as their selection includes beers I have never seen anywhere else, or have only been fortunate enough to drink while traveling in Europe.

Some of the more interesting selections (for me) are from the menu's Witbier section, which are typically harder to find.

Witbier is Belgium's answer to a wheat beer. They are often pale and cloudy, and traditionally flavored with a concoction of herbs and spices, but its flavor profile generally incorporates coriander and orange into the mix. If you've ever had a Shock Top Belgium White, you might be familiar with these flavors, but here you can also find Joseph Spelt Ale from Belgium, a Gayant Amadeus Beer from France, and a Hitachino Nest White Ale from Japan that is oddly considered to be one of the better beers of this type.

I am also drawn to the dozen fruit beers they have on the menu, including the unique Morimoto Soba Ale from Rogue Ales in Oregon that has a honey-like graham cracker taste, Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat, and Wells Banana Bread from England that tastes like the delectable cake its named after.

While the beer menu can be intimidating, it is very well organized and it's relatively easy to find something you might like. Just look for a favorite and choose from the beers around it. If you're a fan of Chimay, which appears in the Trappist ales section of the menu, you will find at least nine other authentic Trappist brews ranging from $15 to $95 for a 12-ounce bottle.

Unfortunately, relying on the menu as your guide is the only viable way of discovering a new beer at The Pub.

On the three occasions I've visited The Pub in the past year, the waitstaff and a couple of bartenders I dealt with seemed relatively clueless and detached about the beers available. They were also very timid when asked for a recommendation.

One time, I inquired as to what the Hitachino Nest Commemorative Ale in the herbed and spiced beer section was flavored with or what I might expect, and was told a ""mix of spices"". Another time, I asked how the Yabun Kitsune rice beer differed from other Pilsners, and if it tended to be more floral or more bitter, and received nothing more than a shrug and a ""dunno"" in return.

Fine. I appreciate that the menu is vast, and I don't expect everyone that works there to know everything about each and every beer on the menu, but would it hurt to take a minute and ask someone who might know and be a little less dismissive? If a diner has a question about the way a restaurant dish is prepared, most waiters will pop into the kitchen and ask the chef if they don't know the answer.

On another occasion, I pointed to the seasonal beers section on the menu and asked the bartender serving me which beers were currently available. He replied that he was kind of busy and did not have time to go check what was seasonal. ""Chances are there aren't any available, anyway,"" he added. Really? The seasonal beers were out of season and you you're too busy to respond to a customer's request?

When I first heard about The Pub, I was hoping for an experience of sorts. A place where a knowledgeable bartender would be able to tell you something about the beers that were available, introduce you to something unique, or make a confident recommendation based on your likes and dislikes. I did not expect them to have a cicerone (a beer sommelier) on duty, but I did hope to see staffers who were proud to be working there and who might take an interest in their grandiose selection of beer.

So while I have enjoyed most of the beers I have had here -- and there have been many -- the service at The Pub has had an impact on my initial impressions.

Maybe this isn't the right place for a self-proclaimed beer geek -- I certainly don't want to feel embarrassed asking questions that might come across as haughty or pretentious, but one would hope that with so many different beers available, someone working there would be equally geeky, or would want to share their contagious excitement about them. Instead, the staff I've dealt with has always seemed disinterested and maybe a bit overwhelmed, and might be more comfortable dropping a bucket of Bud Light Limes on your table.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,5,4,3,ZHXdanC4BhLB2b_h8MP2hQ

I ordered the fish and chips, the breading was absolutely dripping in oil, enough to sog out the fries underneith.  I pulled all the breading off and the fish just plain didn't smell right.  The fries under the fish were soggy and laying in a pool of fishy oil.  My wife ordered the portabello burger which was mediocre at best, no marinade, just a plain mushroom on a bun with fixings.  One positive, I wasn't hungry when I left, I lost my appetite.

Now for the beer... Half of what they had to offer was crossed off the list.  What they don't tell you when you order a glass is that they are charging you $12 for a 20oz glass.  that's right $12....  I have never paid so much.
 
The place was basically empty during a weeknight dinner service.  No one goes there, there is no reason to.  Ellis Island and the triple 7 downtown run circles around this place in every way.  If you are desparate for decent food, head over to Excaliber for a Baja Fresh burrito, 10 minutes away, cheap, filling and reliable.  If you are after a microbrew, hop on the Deuce and get a great beer at the triple 7 for $1.50.  The food there is much better too.

First and foremost, it needs to be noticed that The Pub has a very impressive list of tap and bottled beers. Trust me when I say that there is something on their vast menu for everyone, even for those who aren't much of a beer snob (like myself). What helps is that the wait and bar staff are pretty knowledgeable about the beer menu, so don't be afraid to ask questions.

The food at The Pub is good, a bit above average, but not incredible. Think of it as nice, upscale bar food (finger foods, burgers, etc.). Don't get me wrong, all of the offerings that I've had here over the years has been delightful, but nothing that's going to make me say ""We need to go to the pub and have [insert amazing food item here]!""

A nice little bonus during the warm months is that The Pub is directly next to the pool via the outdoor patio. So being able to people watch while having some lunch and a nice cold beverage is fun (that's not creepy or anything... right?).",QNb1ffvoWAJIdF0hF5B5DA,1,1,4,w9Y41qH28V44ro7csCHCug

The hostesses look confused the majority of the time but just kept adding names to their list and giving times that we certainly unrealistic. 

A couple bar seats opened in the main dining room bar and we made a beeline to them as they are supposed to serve the full menu there (and it was first come, first served).  We sat down and waited as the bartender walked back and forth in front of us about 5 times without even an acknowledgement.  He finally asked what he could get us (after waiting about 10 minutes) and we asked for a food menu.  He grabbed a menu and set it in front of us.  It was a drink menu....no food.  He said that he was leaving and that we would probably have to get our food and drink at the other bar and walked away.  I thought surely the restaurant would replace him as there were about 15-20 people still at the bar when he said that he was leaving (it was about 7pm and busy....so I am dumbfounded how a manager would let the bar go unattended in prime time hours with that many people waiting currently to be served and because of the ever growing list at the front).  He left the bar area and we saw him talking to what looked like a manager.....he was there for about 15 more minutes.

They have quite a selection of craft breer and the service has always been very good.  However, we were here today, and someone had reserved the entire 1st floor for a special event.  Because of this, they opened the 2nd floor to the rest of the customers (we didn't even know until today that there was a 2nd floor). 

We go up in the elevator and find seats at the empty bar.  First thing my boyfriend asks for is a beer list.  They couldn't find one because the beer is usually sold and served on the 1st floor (???).  They finally found a menu, and he orders a Maredsous 10 (bartender didn't know what that was).  He said all of the beers are downstairs, so he went there to get it.  Surprise, surprise....they didn't have that beer.  So he orders another one, and guess again....he has to go downstairs.  It took about 15 minutes for my boyfriend to get his hands on a beer.   Side note:  no one has arrived yet for the event taking place downstairs..  So imagine how long it will take when it gets busy downstairs. I don't want to stay here and find out.

So people....if there is a special event going on downstairs, turn back around and find another place to have drinks because they are not prepared to take care of the ""other"" customers.

From their Hang Over Cure burger (topped with a fried egg and bacon), to their flat bread pizza's, everything here has been very tasty.

This place is pretty big. It has a long bar, lots of seating, several tables and several televisions.  The decor is kind of cool as well, tons of beer company logos lining the wall of the bar.  Not a bad setup.

The beer menu is massive. Huge selection of beers on tap and bottled, pricing is fair with the exception of a few that are a bit overpriced. That's Vegas though, they gotta pay the bills for renting the space somehow I suppose.  Their bar food, at least from what I have tried is pretty good too.

The bartender was pretty nice, actually pretty mellow but he got us squared away so I can't complain.  The food took a few minutes but nothing agonizing. I was watching some old guy manning the pizza oven cooking and slinging out the flatbread pizzas left and right and it made me want one.

The first visit was a Sunday evening about 9pm, just for some drinks. The place had quieted down since all the football was over for the day. We sat at the bar, and I ordered a Pyramid Haywire Hefeweizen (something I can't get on tap back in Denver, but it's my favorite beer) and my husband ordered a Blue Moon. They were out of both. My second choice was Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Out of it. My 3rd was Widmer Hefeweizen. Finally, a beer they had. But my 3rd choice. I realize it's a Sunday evening after a busy day of football, but when you boast about how many beers on tap you have, you really should have them. 

Our bartender was very nice, super social and apologetic for the lack of beer.

The next night we went for dinner during the Monday night football game. Our meals were excellent. My husband had the Hangover Burger and said that it was almost TOO much for a burger, but delicious. I had the Fry Sampler, which had two types of french fries and sweet potato fries plus accompanying dipping sauces. All 3 were awesome. 

However. 

Again I ordered my Pyramid Hefeweizen. On a Monday, thinking the beer was likely delivered that day since they were out on Sunday. Nope. Still no Pyramid. I did get my 2nd choice, at least. 

The bartender was not very attentive. He had 7 people at his area of the bar, and spent his whole time conversing with a couple at the far end of the bar. He was nice enough when he came to serve us, but it took a while for him to do it.

Would I go back again? Probably not. The food definitely was good, but if I'm paying $8 a beer, I'd rather not chance that they have what I want.

Service was great and they barely let the drinks go dry before bringing another one, which is always on my list of good things.

I had a burger, which was cooked just the way I like it (burned!). I got the bacon on it, which came out a little weird. It was just a bunch of bacon crumbles on the meat. It turned out tasting excellent, but sometimes you just want to chew on a strip of bacon!

The happy hour offers 2 for 1 drinks so that makes it a little more worth it. The reason I'm giving 2 stars however is several different reasons. The first time I came here, the place was about half full and after 15 minutes of no one coming over to take our order, we got tired of waiting and just left. The second time we came here was on a football day and the wait for a table was over an hour so we just left again. The most recent time we came here and actually ordered, we were asking about the happy hour. We noticed when checking in to the hotel there were signs that said their happy hour included $1 sliders and $1 chicken wings. We asked our server about that and he had no idea what we were talking about. He said he would ask the manager and then when he came back never brought it up. We ended up splitting some chicken nachos and having a beer each which wasn't bad at all. After we finally got our check, the waiter told us:

""my manager said that there's communication problems between the marketing dept. and restaurant and so they are advertising that but we haven't started offering it yet.""

He was pretty sneaky to wait until we were done eating to bring it up because if I had heard that before we ordered I definitely would have wanted to speak to the manager myself. I think it's ridiculous that there were ads all over the hotel for these $1 sliders but the restaurant was not honoring this. If I knew this information before we ordered, I probably would have gotten up and left this place for the third time in a row. For the location, amount of tvs, and quality of food, you would expect more than a 3 star average from yelp for this place, but because of the TERRIBLE SERVICE, I can definitely see why it ranks so low. I will be coming back here but, next time, I will demand that they honor their ads rather than considering the possibility that I was just mistaken.

For some reason we followed him to the seats and were stuck in an odd spot where it was harder to watch the game. My sister sat down and I stood up to watch the game and he was talking to her a bit, not a lot though. We ordered beer and pretzels and the bartender was great. The beer selection there is great and the pretzel was excellent. As the game went on I started chatting with a few England fans (we were there to watch Italy). I didn't think anything of it until the guy who had led us to these ""great seats"" started saying things to my sister like ""I thought you guys would be more grateful for these seats"" and making comments about us talking to these other guys. Fine, whatever. Then he tries to get the guys kicked out (and almost succeeds) and takes my sister's seat from her and makes her stand up. Again, really childish but whatever - there are a lot of jerks out there. Then he starts loudly telling his friend how stupid we are and going on and on. I looked at him and said ""You know we can hear you, right"" at which point he told me that was the point. I was furious. So I went and said something to the hostess. I told her which guy he was and I saw her speak with someone about it and here is why I give the Pub 2 stars (and will probably never go back here out of principle). 

No one did anything. Here is a patron who is essentially belittling two women in your establishment and you DO NOTHING because your buddies with the bartender. Is this really how you want to be known? I couldn't believe it. Then he almost got the guys we were chatting with kicked out again. Apparently, if you are a local it is overlooked. Absolutely ridiculous. And the worst part about it is they didn't even have to kick this guy out - it just would have been nice if they would have had a word with him to show that they cared he was treating their customers like pieces of garbage.

Doubt I will be back, it's a shame with their beer menu but there are plenty of other places that will appreciate my patronage more in Vegas.",5eskcS3I-h3MDex16Hkqnw,0,0,2,eIhsap01IQqkL2od0KGqAQ

Unfortunately, they no longer brew their own beer, so don't be fooled by the large brewery equipment in the windows.  They have a lots of smaller teles along the bar and a HUGE television as you enter on the left side of the restaurant.

I was able to enjoy a pint of Goose Island Matilda, but then I didn't enjoy the $10.53 price for it.  Oddly enough, they have a lot of beers but actually so few beers.  What I mean is they don't have a large selection for people who are really into interesting craft beers.

When Tim did arrive at the table he took his time and answered any questions that we had.  We placed our drink orders, I had a root beer that was on draft.  The root beer was served in a beer type glass with no ice.  It was some of the best root beer that I've ever tasted.  

I ordered a Lil Boy Blue burger.  The burger was perfectly cooked to medium.  The toppings were fresh with two types of onions, caramelized and raw.  It also had a lettuce, tomato, and of course Blue Cheese.   You have different options for the buns, I choose a whole wheat one.  It was fresh and tasted great! The fries were delicious and hot, just the right amount of salt!

5958474,2012-08-13,0,U-zsJM-VN89i3PbaIbKmJw,"The good news: The wings were good and the happy hour pricing for them were reasonable for Vegas fair. 

The bad news: 
1. The burger buns totally ruined what could have been a good burger. Stale, hard and huge. More bun than burger. 

2. Who serves a flight in 5oz pours? If I'm going to pay $25 for a flight, give me 10 2 once pours instead of 5 5ounce pours. I want to taste your beers!

3. Our service was terrible. I was in a party of about 30 people and we waited 30 minutes for people to come around for drink orders and another 30 minutes to get said drinks... some of us had to order our drinks twice because we never got them the first time. I didn't feel we got the attention we deserved. Which makes #4 that much more awful. 

4. With a party of 30 people the tip was already included in the tab. Which is probably why we got such crappy service, because the waitress knew she'd get paid no matter what. But here's the thing... she didn't tell the bill payer that the tip was included. He hadn't ordered food, just a drink, so he hadn't read any notice on the menu and did not know it was included. EVERYWHERE I HAVE EVER BEEN has told us that the tip is included with parties over whatever. Granted, he should have looked at the tab closer, but with a $900 bill, he was just trying to make it as painless as possible by handing over the credit card. By not mentioning that the tip was included, he left her an additional cash tip. The waitress was the cheeriest she had been all night when we got up to leave. But as far as I'm concerned, she stole from us and that is not okay. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone since they make a practice of thievery.",_SJ0NH7Dm0QPibNlMDjMqw,0,0,1,-Jmpe24VrlASyxspSowcEw
