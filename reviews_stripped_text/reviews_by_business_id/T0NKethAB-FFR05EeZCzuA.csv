Time spent in the drive through was never less than 10 minutes, and that's only if they acknowledged my presence before 5 minutes of waiting at the speaker. My order has never been right, the workers are rude, and the place is filthy. We decided to go in today to order, due to my previous drive through fiascos, and we were as equally disappointed with the inside service as the outside. This location needs a complete overhaul of employees or to be shut down altogether.

I'm from the East Coast where BK does breakfast on Sundays until 11 am, thought I was safe. However when I got into the drive thru, they informed me that they were no longer serving breakfast. However, Nicole (from Kenmore, NY) the drive thru girl went and asked the cooks if they could make me a breakfast burrito and they very sweetly did. The burrito was delicious and the service was even better. So I want to thank the staff and especially Nicole and the young man also at the window. They really went above and beyond the call of service and I will certainly be heading up to this BK again and will be calling corporate to let them know that they have got some great employees at this store.",6pKbF79HXMHeT0qGe--lgA,1,1,5,ZwrcpvYBPFshSmb_g68UPQ

First off I ordered for my kids and I, A whopper with cheese, a chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and a few orders of fries. The fries were completely inedible and very stale as if they were sitting out for 6+ hours or longer, the chicken nuggets were disgusting and were also extremely stale, my kids wouldn't even eat the fries or chicken nuggets, (and my kids will eat ANYTHING!!).

This is not something you want to see right after your food just came from there!!

2128928,2015-07-08,7,T0NKethAB-FFR05EeZCzuA,"Last night I was driving home at approximately 1:30 AM- being tired, hungry and having just had a confusing conversation with a girl (but hey, what conversation with a girl isn't confusing), so clearly my judgement was a little clouded.  But I decided to stop in to put $1.50 of my hard-earned skrilla to good use to the tune of 10 chicken nuggets with some bbq sauce.  When I arrived home, I threw on The Amazing Race Season 5 and resumed watching where I had left off while double (hell sometimes even TRIPLE) dipping my nuggs in the aforementioned sauce.  All was well.  Or so I thought...

I then woke up disoriented on the couch about 6 AM, feeling like my stomach had suddenly reached the furthermost depths of pain and discomfort.  I felt sick.  I was sure I was food-poisoned.  All I could taste was the nugget remnants mixed with the taste of the vomit I was sure I was about to spew everywhere.

Although I stayed by the toilet feeling miserable for over half an hour, I somehow made a miraculous recovery and avoided puking and was able to fall back asleep.  It was like a sign from God; a warning.  No more BK.

So next time you get the craving to ""have it your way""- unless ""your way"" is lying on a bathroom floor at 6 AM with your head on the toilet asking the good Lord to just take you, remember this tale and heed my warning.  It's never worth it.",c1qnBMfMsGe4YUZxDGuC4A,3,0,1,VXcTzD-b5z6LzwaoLkA_mw

I just don't know how difficult their jobs could be.. so i called.. the manager was nice enough to put my name down so next time when I come back.. I would get free chicken fries (it's not free.. I've already paid for it and they forgot to put it with my order).
So I'm on my way back to work.. so i stopped back to get the chicken fries so my co worker would have something to eat for lunch.. and i went through the drive thru again.. no cars in front of me or next to me or behind me.. I had to say hello hello hello for someone to say something.. I'm just so confused to how difficult it is to have any customer service.. and if its not a job they dont want to do.. they shouldn't be there..",H0cBZx1rlrXB3tGmgp3LYQ,0,0,1,gdJSxKZ-M0MRKgfNyaLRFw

I don't eat cheese, and I can't even count how many times my sandwich has had cheese on it.  The good thing is that they always replace it when I call them and explain.  The bad thing is, I really just wanted my food right the first time.  When you are hungry and on the go, it's nice to get what you were expecting.  It's such an inconvenience to deal with this, I rarely go to this location anymore.

What I got was a longer than expected wait, employees who weren't knowledgeable of their own menu and excuses. The woman in front of me ordered the Rodeo chicken sandwich, but was given a fish sandwich, she told Michelle, the cashier who took her order, Michelle tried to relay that to the cook who responded with he doesn't know how to make that. I watched as Michelle took the fish sandwich from the customer and place it back on the warmer to be served again (EW!) once the cook came out and talked to the customer directly he was able to understand exactly what the woman wanted (Michelle kept saying 'rodeo' in a way that made it hard to understand)
I had to wait about 10 minutes to order while being told that they are short staffed and that I would get waited on when she gets to me.
My order took about another 10 minutes to get. Food was about warm. 
Definitely wont be returning after watching food get handled by a patron and then placed back to be served again instead of thrown away. I get you pay for what you get but geez!",eXdGPNNav8k97zmW0o6aaw,0,0,2,v1Mo4gAO3AwfNB5CDBJ4zA

The drive through people are downright awful.  In the last four trips I have been here, three times was just to order iced coffee and milkshakes and have been turned away every time to either machines being off or coffee isn't ready yet, or they are cleaning and don't want to turn the machines back on.  On top of that, the drive through people don't even care or apologize.  The last time I ordered food here they shorted my order chicken nuggets.  I don't know what kind of business they are running but they obviously don't like making money and will hire anybody who has a pulse.  Upper level management or the ownership needs to step in and get this place in order.  I would give them 0 stars if I could but that is not an option.

He asks if we want whip cream & we say no. He reads back the order, ""Fruit Loop milkshake, no whip cream."" Correct. 

Drive up, pay & we get a Fruit Loop milkshake WITH whip cream, no customer service whatsoever & although the flavor of the shake is great, it is so thick you can't get any out of the straw.

I drove to another Burger King and used a second coupon, the exact same and ordered the exact same thing and they gave me $12 in change back, which is correct. The North Durango location is ripping customers off. Additionally, while my mom was inside she noticed that there were at least 25 pre made sandwich's and no one was in line.
