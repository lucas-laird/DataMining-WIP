3173,2014-10-06,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,So happy there is finally a SkinnyFats closer to home. And this one seems like much more space. My go to is the Slow boat to China. Mr Green is a good drink as well. Customer service was good.,WBhn6b-r2D7p-Z4XjgsImg,0,0,5,BBXIto7IZaP6d9RV6VDPQA
3604,2016-08-07,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"Hello, today I visited SkinnyFATS for the first time.  I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.

The customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.

SkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service.",EmLSHnNmge833K98Gm1zMg,0,0,3,1aXrhLqtAu06LppGMlnG7g

16463,2016-08-29,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"My girlfriend and I tried this place after thinking it looked something like Greens & Proteins.  We were wrong!  The menu is pleasing and sounds good, but that's where the illusion ends.  After getting our food, a steakcation and the meltdown with a side of truffle fries, we anxiously waited for our food.  When it arrived, my burger was super greasy and the meat and cheese were absolutely bland.  My girlfriend's salad was equally dull.  The meat lacked any flavor and the dressing failed to redeem the enjoyment of the meal.  The truffle fries were ok, but nothing memorable.  All in all, the food sated our hunger pains, but left us feeling completely unsatisfied.

A few hours later, I felt sick to my stomach.  I don't understand all the rave reviews, but it didn't sit well for us.  We won't return.",IPYbq_wHyg5rQllDHkebtg,0,0,1,2aY4Vc5mKmjhOwYDZiSZKg

have had it all they are always coming out with new specials. 

The customer service here is also fantastic. The atmosphere is really mellow. Mostly EDM music, but not so loud that you can't talk to a friend or date. 

Inside they offer both table seating and a type of bar seating around a large high table. They also have one giant screen TV and one projected TV, typically showing sports. They offer outside seating as well under nice string garden lighting. 

I would recommend this place to anyone. They do have another location which I have been to. however, the atmosphere does not compare. This location is highly recommended for your first time!",MjoqIL3lTigoJA_FM2dMmg,0,0,5,G9jGqnjgAY1o4W-C63YqIA

The sandwiches are stacked for height, not even distribution.  The cookies are raw in the middle.  Theres sugar in the bread they use.  And theres little things here and there which I would think they should do better, but its alright.  They try to say they are a healthier option and in some aspects that might be true, but not terribly so. Also, the truffle fries were nothing compared to those you find at Bachi Burger.  Service is good and I was very impressed with them today.  I tipped extra because of the extra attention they gave to the newbie in my group.  The establishment is nice and clean which is of utmost importance to me. I would come back.

While waiting, the blonde guy behind the  to-go counter bent over and half of his bare ass was shown to anyone waiting to order. He then pulled up his underwear with his bare hands and proceeded to put plates together before sending them out. Disgusting.

Our biggest advice is that their menu is really, really diverse.  There are some more typical things as well as some more adventurous dishes.  After trying a variety of different things during our repeat visits, there were things we LOVED and things we wouldn't order again.

The ahi taco is one of our repeat favorites, we've tried both the healthy side version and the happy side, and both are delicious, and prefer the healthy one since the tuna is raw & seared instead of fully cooked.

Happymess - pieces of steak, crumbled blue cheese, on a bed of fries.  Good but not great.

Smotherload - a HUGE breakfast burrito (that lives up to its name).  Good but would honestly love to have a smaller version of it on the menu too!

Chick and Waff-a-Doppolis - So simple - just chicken tenders on a waffle with syrup, but it was delicious.  One of my favorites now actually.

And lastly, not sure what the name is, but it was brown pancakes with a turkey patty in between, egg whites, and raspberry sauce - this was our least favorite and we actually didn't finish it.  Overall it was way too sour unfortunately.

Overall awesome place and once you find what you love, it's easy to get addicted.  We'll be back!",GdsNZN_yMfKNQ6Mf0c3hGw,0,0,4,uhb5SCX-qffi87-NFTCDGg

I'm glad it wasn't busy otherwise seating would have been tricky with a toddler in tow. The food was dynamite. I ordered the chickety China and it had a great combo of tangy and sweet. The slaw was nicely coated and crisp, even my one year old loved it. My husband had the cherry popper burger, it was delicious. The meat had a nice fresh taste and the aioli was great. The truffle fries were super tasty. We ordered off the happy side and will definitely be back to try more and the healthy side looked great too. Hopefully this location catches on, I've been to a few different restaurants at this spot.

I will not be returning.

I ordered a chicken sandwich no sauce. It came out with sauce, burnt. I sent it back. It came back again, no sauce, but burnt...again. What are the chances the chicken is going to be burned twice in a row? I'm talking so burnt it hurt my mouth to chew. Oh, and they burned my husband's chicken also. How do people burn fried chicken? 

The ONE diet soda choice in the whole restaurant had no syrup. Told some employee about it. In the forty minutes I sat at my table, no one at the restaurant fixed it. I paid 2 bucks or whatever it was for a soda cup to fill it with water. Like, I'm already blowing my day's calories on this mediocre chicken sandwich - can't you put some damn calorie free syrup in your machine so I can drink my money's worth in soda? NO? Oh okay. 

Overpriced. Oh boy is this place overpriced. Restaurant prices for a fast food type experience. Yeesh. You'd have better luck taking your money and buying one of everything at the Sonic right across the parking lot. You'd probably enjoy something at Sonic more too.

I'm giving it two stars because the food wasn't so bad that it was inedible and the inside of the restaurant was modern and hip. Never going back, however.",t5nkLYfi7spS8uvX-eRLag,0,0,2,VZcKnmMj0D_gGNHk5kxfyw

The asian theme burger was really wet and hard to eat, and wasn't amazing flavor wise compared to the Umami burger the dish was meant to mimic.  My date got the chicken and waffles, which were OK, but nothing special (and lets be real, chicken and waffles are kind of hard to mess up.)

The service was about what you might expect from a place like subway, with the ordering happening at a front counter, and the reception of a number.  We didn't get silverware or condiments on our table, and had to go in search of those things ourselves.  We didn't see the waitress at all, really, until we dropped the tip on the table, even though it was late and we were one of about 3 tables currently in use.

I'm a big soda fan, and they had some really good original recipe stuff on tap.  Everything from creme and orange soda to root beer and some kind of red velvet thing.  I tried and enjoyed all of them, and if there was anything that stood out it would be the soda.

I have to say that I don't feel like I am eating ""healthy"" food because all of the items on the menu are so tasty and don't feel like they are missing cheese or butter aioli. However, when I eat the ""happy"" menu, while I am very happy I also feel very heavy! haha. But what I love about this place is that when I am on a mission to get healthier, we can still dine here and my husband can order off either menu and doesn't feel like I am forcing him onto my diet. 

The only thing I can say is that I don't think the location is as good as Dean Martin, but the lines are definitely shorter which is a plus! And I think the menu could be enlarged and the prices reduced. Case in point, the buffalo cauliflower is very tasty and healthy, but it is over $6 for a handful of Cauliflower. Compared with an ahi taco for a similar price which is way more filling and made with more expensive ingredients. I would suggest more consistency in their prices.

After talking to my Elite CM Nate, he gave me some good advice ""don't post a review after the first visit and just because you had a bad experience - give them a second chance because everybody can have a bad day"" and he's right. My first visit here the Strawberry Lemonade was terrible but after I left my review and I returned, it was perfect! So I made the decision to delete those previous reviews and write a fresh new one after I've returned multiple times as I do love giving second chances, so here it goes! 

Skinny Fats has a great environment, even when they are busy an employee always says hello and welcome as you enter. There are times where the line is a bit of a wait but the food is so worth it! At this location online ordering is not available which is a bummer if you're looking for convenience but you can call it in ahead of time and pick it up for to-go! I've had a few things off both sides of the menu and surprisingly enough I've only enjoyed the meals I've had from the Healthy side so far. I did try their ColdExpress ""juice bar"" as well and for $10 I was still hungry afterwards which was disappointing but that just proves I'm not a juicing person but at least I tried! They have a secret menu on their iPad and sometimes share the items on Facebook which is fun, I love the Secret Punch drink! So my point is, give this place a try!

I love the idea of having an outdoor seating (even though its getting quite cold now) but it would be great when its like.. mid 70s low 80s ! *heart* haha they have a good amount of seating (much more and spacious compared to original location) and also a huge table for those single go-ers or if you just like the bar height style seating ! 

coming to this location, its not a first time experience. but considering how close it is and convenient, my friend and I had determined to try something new every time we come here :D 

my favorite item - chix on broadway - Breaded chicken breast, BLT, cheddar, red onion & lemon herb aioli on brioche w/side - im actually not sure if this changed or it was maybe a 1 time thing or chef difference.... the chicken was bigger (not complaining) but a bit dryer and not as juicy and flavorful as i remembered... 

truffle fries... again i think it my be a location or 1 time thing... first time i ordered this, the fries were a bit soggy, and not as fresh/crisp. still love the availability of the jalepeno ketchup hahah XD 

chik-a-waff-a-dopolis - fried chicken tenders over buttermilk waffle - the fried chicken tenders were seasoned really nicely (similar to the chicken in chix on broadway) but the waffle was a bit of an upset. yeah its big but too firm. not as light and crispy as i had expected a waffle to be like. the

wrap supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a WW tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt - one of the first lighter menu items ive tried..... and it is definitely lighter ... in terms of calories (i think) and flavor... a bit bland actually... the cajun cilanto lime yogurt is not enough to eat with the entire wrap. 

finally got to sit outside for once but unfortunately it was getting cold (jacket weather) and they couldnt figure out how to turn on the gas space heaters (tip - low on propane.... Lol)

after tryin the healthier side.. i might be a bit more biased than i already was towards the non... healthy side hahah XD !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,3,4,c5Qf1tD_6mwohD8T9fngGQ

Had a 15 minute drive home and called to place an order for pickup. Clarissa answered the phone and asked to place me on hold for a minute. Pretty standard so far. As I continue to drive, I think to myself ""geez I've been on hold for a long time."" Before you know it I've arrived at SkinnyFATS and they still have not come back on the phone. I check my phone and I see it's already been over a 15 minute phone call. Wonderful! 

As I drive past the front door, I see that the store is pretty busy, but not a single soul in line! That's pretty infuriating to put it mildly. I consider going inside while still on hold, and getting in line to place an order and tell them ""seems it was faster to drive 15 min here and order in person instead of calling in an order!"" Ultimately, I decide to just leave as I wouldn't even enjoy my meal from here today. 

As I pull out of the plaza and I'm about to hang up, Clarissa comes back on the phone ""thank you for holding, can I get your name for the order?"" I say ""no thanks! That was pretty long hold. I just drove by your store and there wasn't a single person in line! So that's pretty upsetting."" To which she replies ""there must have been some mix up in the order of the phone calls."" Seems more likely I was forgotten about on hold, cuz how many phone calls were ""mixed up"" ahead of me for 15 minutes???

We both never had dine in either places. So, it didn't matter which place, but pics for SkinnyFATS on Yelp   were enticing! 

We came in and line was just starting to get busy at around 6pm. I ordered the Chix on Broadway with a side of truffle fries. Our order came in a timely manner. I was first impressed that the chicken to bread ratio was pretty darn good! The breaded chicken breast was huge than normal. It was also very moist. 

However, taste was not there. To me, the breaded chicken was bland. The toppings that came with the Chix on Broadway were BLT, cheddar, red onion, and lemon herb aioli. All these toppings didn't help with the chicken being bland. Also, I prefer my bacon cooked crispy. I don't know if they cook their bacon not crispy all the time. Hey, but it's an easy fix! Ask to cook it crispy then?

I chose the truffle fries as my side that came with the meal. The fries were served barely warm and the fries were not the best I've had. Overall, I will try SkinnyFATS again for a second visit.

Firstly, this place gets PACKED. I have yet to come here and experience a wait for a table. The waits have all been short, but a wait is a wait. 

Secondly, I have ordered from their ""everything"" else side just one time because their healthy side is that delicious! I switched sides for the Chicken & Waffles which, if you're wondering, is worth it!

I ordered the Cranburkey burger from the healthy side the first time I stopped in, and during this visit. I wanted to try something else, but something about that perfectly cooked cranberry turkey patty called me back. I did opt for the truffle fries instead of the sweet potato fries though...so my meal wasn't 100% healthy. I washed my meal down with a glass - or more like, awesome reusable cup - of their fresh strawberry lemonade.

1624176,2015-07-24,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,I've been to Skinny Fats several times over both locations & have loved it every time. Normally I get the Ahi Taco San & Slow Boat to China but after seeing the RaspBomb.com on their FB page I decided to order that up with the truffle fries ($12.97). I was highly disappointed. There was no raspberry taste what-so-ever to the sandwich even though the bread appeared to have raspberry swirled throughout it. It tasted just like a grilled chicken sandwich with alfalfa sprouts. I asked for alfalfa sprouts after the sandwich came since I forgot to ask when I ordered. Truffle fries were disappointing as well. No flavor although they said there was truffle oil on the fries. There was no salt as I added that myself. I wished I would have gotten the sweet potato fries one of my lunch mates had. I hate ketchup (gasp! I know the absurdity of that) so I asked for ranch from one of the servers & even after I said I don't use ketchup she told me there was a 50 cent charge for ranch. Seriously? I am not using both - but using ranch in place of ketchup. I would have thought they would have told me they were charging for alfalfa sprouts instead of ranch since alfalfa sprouts would be a higher cost to them. I told them to forget it. I tried the fries with the Jalapeno ketchup that was on the table. ICK. Sad to say today wasn't that great of an experience at Skinny Fats.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,2,5VRlO8PaUv-SGX_AWe_dyA

The girl at the counter was very very nice though and had no qualms explaining the menu.

To start I got the rosemary hummus and vegetable chimichurri which was undoubtedly the best thing on the menu. My hangover remedy juice was yummy, no complaints there but the mean bean vegan burger I got was gross. Mouth feel was all off, and the whole thing just lacked flavor and texture in all aspects.

They also have great smoothies and cold-pressed juices. Their smooth immunity smoothie reminds me of an orange julius , but better. I hate soda but their cream soda here is pretty good.

She got in contact with me 30 minutes after my initial review.

My mom and I stopped in yesterday and had a wonderful experience.  

Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive.

The restaurant was very clean.

Our food was awesome. We had the two different kinds of ahi tuna tacos. I loved the fried one. We also shared the cauliflower bites. The cherry popper burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had.

One of those times the line is out to the door and they only have one girl on the register. Everyone else is kinda just moseying around. One girl is slowly doing roll ups, I see a couple employees walk past the register and no one ever acknowledges there's a line. I wait about 25 mins IN LINE to order food. It was honestly one of the most aggravating me experiences when it's clear that another employee should be in the register too, it's busy enough! Then I wait for 20-25 minutes for CHICKEN TENDERS AND FRIES. At one point I was like I'm sorry I didn't realize it would take this long for food. And I'm like I have to go. Just cancel my order. And the girl working as the expeditor says it'll be up in just a minute. Well I came an hour before work and I have no food so I have to go.
The next time I called in my order, thinking it would be faster. They don't give me any instructions on how or where to pick up my food. So I obviously stand in line and wait to get to the register. I'm in like for 15 MINS and I see people just going right up to the counter and picking up food/paying!!! So as I'm standing in line I flag down an employee and tell her I have ordered food to go and I need to pay. She brings out the food and points to the register and was like she will ring you up. I was like well I have to go, I thought about just leaving the food bc I really did not want to waste my time. The girl, Nichole I think her name is, ends up taking my payment. I've never not tipped them but I did not tip this time bc I was so peeved.
The food is good but it takes too long to order and if you order to go it seems to be an issue. I really don't know if I'd come back. I've talked to a couple of my friends and they all had the same reactions about this location, IT TAKES FOREVER.",LOaoIwS5fdU9KmfaRcPQCA,1,0,1,hb6XoY_MXb40Ba4RkFONVg

If you've never been here.... Here's a tip

You walk in, grab a paper menu and check it out even before standing in line to order. They have so many great things you'll have a hard time deciding on your first selection! There's a happy and a healthy side, although the happy side can also be pretty healthy. Both sides do not skip on flavor either. They've recently added a few things from their secret menu to he permanent menu, like the Filet o' fire. With your sandwiches you also get a choice of a side and my go to choice is always truffle fries, I'll go the sweet potato route if I'm being strict on my diet. 

I always get a fresh pressed juice (liquid defense), but they also have soda that they make. So it's soda on the healthier side.  Also, they have infused water, if you just want a water cup. 

When you dine in, your meal will be sent to your table on real serve wear and not plastic!!! They also clean the tables after you, so make sure to leave a tip!!!!",a9UymHuKxZKMnHXOo3nLKA,4,2,5,4fHI1oNKJYcvDUSKXN_KCw

With the burger taking nearly 15 minutes to move made from an order, the quality of this place just makes it worth it. 

Presentation wise Skinny Fats does it solid with every dish. I'm impressed with each dish. I may not have the best viewing angles of the foods but none of the pics can demonstrate the size of each food item. Honestly all of them are very large in portion and plenty for 1. 

But onto the food taste, the most important part. This burger really shined on it. For such a large burger I wasn't expecting such a high standard but this burger nailed it. Bun was fresh and light, not too chewy while the patty was juicy and didn't spill over at ALL. IT DELIVERED.

The patty itself had me drooling and it was perfect. Flavor wise it knocked out of the park with a nice herby juice oozing out of it. 

Decor is nice as well, even the outdoors when it gets 100 degrees out. Most of us were in shade so that helped.

I've had their fish tacos (both versions) before, but a healthy-side staple for me is the Nice to Greek You flatbread: plenty of toppings, good mix of flavors, portion is a big lunch or enough for leftovers later. Underwhelmed by the side of truffle fries. They're a generous portion, and crispy, but have very little flavor. I do wish they had a garlic fry option because I think they'd rock. A ""side"" of fries should be less than $3.50 and not big enough for an entire table to share, cut the portion and price to something more reasonable.

There's an indoor area as well as an outdoor area. The line to order can often be out the door. Next to the register, there is a screen that displays the various specials of the day. Be sure to check out the specials!

The prices are alright. It doesn't seem bad in relation to the quality and quantity you get.

For drinks, they do serve beer. They also have a variety of smoothies and juices, as well as natural sugar sodas. The black cherry soda is delicious!

Beware that there may be significant lag time between dishes arriving at your table. We had one arrive long before the rest. Like really long. The other dishes arrived separately too, but the time in between wasn't bad.

We tried a variety of food - chicken and waffles, red velvet waffle, buffalo chicken tenders with truffle fries, and their take on a Philly cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. The Philly cheesesteak was my favorite. It's got cherry peppers and banana peppers on it! And it has pepper jack cheese and cheese sauce. Yum, yum, yum! Even the roll is was on was delicious.

I like that you get to keep the cups, and if you bring them back on your next visit you get $0.50 off your next drink.

Inside seating was full, but luckily the weather was gorgeous so we sat outside. The food came out quickly, considering how busy they were. The tu nuts was good, but it was not filling. The fries were just okay. Not really truffle-ly.  I tried the sweet potato fries and they were good, I will get them next time. Honestly I was still hungry after eating.

On my first visit no one explained the menu sides and I got laughed at for asking if I ""really need two"" of the tacos, plus a side of fries and drink. On top of that, they forget my fries with my order! Granted the taco was tasty, I was peeved at the cashier for making a rude comment. A simple "" the tacos are kinda big, are you sure you'd like two?"" would have been nicer. (Hint for anyone order, order one plus a side and you'll be happy!)

The second and third time I came here wasn't by choice but because of group carpooling for business. Had the buffalo Chix (tasty and good portion size!) but fries were kinda soggy in the truffle oil. I asked for a second side of ranch for the chicken but it never came. Third time I got the healthy version of the ahi tuna taco (first time was the happy version).  And a cookie. This was also quite good, but I never got my cookie! When I asked one of the girls bringing out food about it, she took my receipt (I assume to go get it) and never returned. I went up to the cashier after I finished (about 5 min later) and she got my cookie for me finally but by then I was already annoyed that they can't get the little things right. 

I'll try my luck at the other location if my group goes again but at this rate, food is winning over the crap customer service sadly. I really want to give this place 5 stars but they need to step it up in order to do that.",oKjYwXEkqYB9CwA65TcGbw,0,0,3,hF6NY8XY1ubdwWq6n9DDCg

First off, thank you for always fulfilling my inner fat kid. I almost always order from the happy menu (the more unhealthy menu). And I have no ragrets. Not even a single letter.

But on a more serious note. The food here is always on point. Depending on what time of day you come in, this place is usually packed and busy. The outside seating is nice during spring and summer.

I would suggest ordering any kind of burger on their happy menu. Medium rare. And throw in an extra fried egg if the burger doesn't already have it. You're welcome.

Also. They serve alcohol! Try out one of their cocktails. They're usually a fusion of something incredibly healthy, if that's what you're looking for. But the drinks taste pretty good.

The wait here may take a little longer than expected but that's because the food is made fresh and there's usually a ton of people here. Which is definitely good for business.

The staff are always kind and you are greeted right away upon entering and leaving. 

SkinnyFATS is dangerously located about 5 mins away from me and it gives me even more reason to frequent this place with my hanger (not hunger).",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,2,1,5,_bqiCXrMnsiOmK2RgnoF7Q

I like the concept here but the employees def need some training on what's in their food.

I asked what was in the citrus dressing to the cashier and he said, ""idk, citrus?"".

Okay obviously there's citrus in the citrus dressing. So he asked another employee next to him what's in the citrus dressing. She goes, ""ya know, it has a citrus taste with citrus in it.""

Wow after that I couldn't help but to burst out laughing. 

She's like ""what? Is that not good enough for you?"" 

I mean, no it's not good enough. That doesn't give me enough info on your dressing. After that, it just got awkward. 

Anyways,

The menu is pretty big with lots of options. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and it was pretty good. It def did not feel skinny since it had butter on the bread and it being drenched with teriyaki sauce. The balsamic vinaigrette tasted like the one from trader joes.

2206290,2015-08-17,2,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"The Skinny: decent burger for the price, the Steaknation not much as they skimp on the protein. Pass on the truffle fries(3) Service is counter service (3), Value: for $23.50 for two people for lunch given what we ordered? Meh - I've definitely had better (3)

I can't help to think that the concept of a healthy/happy side was pretty appealing for me. However when perusing the menu, from a nutrition stand point, the healthy side didn't seem so healthy to me with the exception of a smaller portion size. 

After badgering the hubby to come with me, we settled on selecting what we would get. The hubs got the Steaknation ($11) off the healthy side while I settled for The Classic ($10) burger from the happy side. Coming with sides, the hubs ordered the sweet potato fries while I opted for the truffle fries. 

Being curious of the Boyland cane soda fountain, we ordered a small soda which came in a pretty cute reusable cup. I heard rumors that you get a discount on your next purchased drink if you bring in the cup although there isn't anything on the website or in the store that agreed with this. Overall, the handcrafted soda fountain was kind of a miss for me. Yeah, it's made with real cane sugar but it is awfully sweet. They also featured Shangri-la brewed iced tea which tasted really watered down. The cucumber/lemon water is a nice touch though.

I thought the Classic burger itself was a solid burger. The burger was done to a perfect medium while the flavor of the SF sauce (basically a upscaled rendition of the 1000 Island Big Mac sauce) was delicious. However a few minor details kind of detracted from the experience. I didn't like the fact that they shredded the iceberg lettuce, taking away from the crispiness of the produce. The steak tomatoes were sliced too thin as well. Second minor quibble was the quality/size of the brioche bun relative to the burger patty. I thought that the bun lacked sufficient butter flavoring and was overly large for the meat. I would give this burger about a 3.5 stars overall.

The Steaknation was from the healthy side - which meant that they kind of skimped out on the meat inside the sandwich. What meat was in there was a bit dry although seasoned well. The horseradish yogurt was also a bit bland as well and rather unassuming. Definitely needed a bit more kick to it. I liked the arugula but the hubs felt it was a pass. Again, the tomatoes were too thinly sliced for my tastes. 

The truffle fries were really disappointing. Soggy and without a hint of truffle oil, they were terrible. Would not recommend this option at all. The sweet potato fries fared better and I would have preferred this over the truffle fries any day of the week.

Overall, considering what they charge, I would consider this a 3 starred joint. For what you get on the happy side, it seems a bit overpriced if you think about the portion size. The burger is decent but it's not perfect either. The soda fountain options were a bust for me being too sweet and the iced tea being too watered down. Long story short, I think I'll pass on this joint. (3 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,1,3,zumVV5lu9eJQeoGc5C6joA

The communal table is cute though with the pallet stools.

Cooking rice is a basic skill and they managed to mess it up. Second, they drowned my bowl in teriyaki sauce. The bowl overall was too sweet and made me lose my appetite.

Skinny side has a variety of veggie and vegan options, salads, and lighter fare. Fats side has burgers and fried chicken and the like. It's all delicious and the best part is, you can order from both sides!

DRINK
Fresh pressed juices are delicious and not crazy expensive either.

Joyful and friendly.

We were greeted immediately, and asked if we had any questions, staff was very friendly. I ordered a Cranburkey Burger with a side of fruit, and my lunch pal ordered the Nice to Greek You flatbread. We both got fountain drinks and it was around $25, not bad! 

I loved the decor, very bright and hipster/yuppie which I'm all about. I also loved that their fountain drinks were cane sweetened Boylan soda!! Awesome! And their cups are re-useable/dishwasher safe! 

We sat outside and it was so comfy and nice. It would be awesome at night with the twinkle lights they have strung up. 

The flatbread was a nice size, my companion didn't leave hungry, or overly full. Good toppings ratio, nice presentation. 

My burger was great, I wish I had thought to add cranberries at home! The bun was delicious too. I appreciated that the burger wasn't loaded with salt, like at so many other restaurants, and the bun wasn't slathered in butter, but was still moist.

This location even has a lovely outside seating area and a dedicated juice bar attached next door. Way to improve. 

I love that their menu is divided in to healthy and not so healthy. Also, they only list calories for the healthy side. The kids both like this place, which is rare that they both agree on much and they have a cool kids menu with some good options as well. 

One of my kids likes the chicawaffadopolis (chicken and waffles) but a good friend thinks the chicken isn't seasoned well and the waffle is nothing special. But we both agree that the Steak Eyes is really good. I personally like both sides of their menu.

The big chunks of Portobello and Cauliflower that they give you are delicious. They also don't serve too much but after you don't feel like you're stuffed. 

My boyfriends Steak Eyes had country fried Filet Mignon medallions over biscuits with 2 over medium eggs and gravy. The gravy is delicious paired with the biscuits. The eggs were perfectly cooked and so was the filet mignon.

The establishment looked clean and nice. I liked the projection of the football game (on at the time) on the wall above the dining room.

Steak Eyes: they originally come with country fried filet but we opted for grilled. I love salt but this dish was so salty I couldn't take more than a bite. 

Ahi Srirachi: love at first bite! Scrupulously delicious 'slaw chee' with the sweet mango pico was just too good for words.

This place was all new to us and from the reviews we had read we were so excited to try it out... When I walked in I loved the atmosphere and the interior design only thing I didn't expect from here was the horrible customer service that was about to unfold... The girl who greeted us and checked us out was very rude, when I walked in I thought it was a restaurant where people sit us down and so I said table for two and she chuckled and said must be your first time... I was slightly offended but it gets better... As I was trying to review the menu and order she was too busy chit chatting with her co worker to assist me in any way... I asked her for a suggestion and she just showed me the secret menu on the tablet that's displayed... So I had to choose based on a picture, because she made it seem like it was such a big deal to describe some foods I was interested in... After I ordered I had to check out and ask the girl at the counter my friend has my wallet let me grab it; please keep in mind my friend was sitting at the table by the fountain drinks. It only took me a few seconds to get it and she was already taking another customer and the girl had the nerves to tell me ""Oh sorry... I thought you'd take awhile"" from there I was beyond irritated and annoyed... The food was good but not as good as I would have expected, my friends sandwich tasted a bit blend... It really wasn't like a WOW experience for me... Maybe because I came with such high expectations and with the poor customer service we had received from the start I was let down... Overall it was just okay, but to be honest my first time would have been a lot better if there was better customer service. PS the worker should never tell a customer NO PROBLEM, when a customer says THANK YOU... Because there wasn't a problem in the first place, we say thank you out of courtesy and respect...

Typically, my go-to is the Veg-Which, which is a mushroom burger that is to die for! I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers, but they lather this baby with tomatoes, jalapeños, sweet peppers, pickles and their special sauce! It comes with an amazing bun that is not greasy as well as your choice of a side! I always get the, ""yummus"" with cucumber to be healthier but sometimes I splurge for the truffle or sweet potato fries! As someone who doesn't eat red meat, this burger is one of the best and affordable vegetarian options and beats places like Yardhouse and BJ's by a landslide! 

I love that they make all of their own condiments including hot sauces, ranch, spicy ketchup, and more! Also, they make their own soft drinks and beer! Haven't tried the beer but definitely going to soon! 

Overall, SkinnyFATS is an innovative concept and a great combination of healthy and savory. So grateful to have this local concept in so many locations across the valley.

There's something for everyone: delicious and ""skinny"" choices for those health-conscious and delicious and ""fatty"" choices for those...not.

I had the naked chix bowl: chicken breast, brown rice, mango salsa. It was soooo good! The chicken was grilled well - neother greasy nor dry. The mango salsa wasn't overwhelming and didn't drown the chicken and rice. If I remember correctly, it was around 400 calories and fit well within my macros.

My friends ordered the el presidente burger with fries, the lentil soup, the boat to china, and the hot chix bowl (buffalo chicken salad). Everyone finished their food so I'm guessing they found their food to be delicious as well. 

The ambience was super chill and the restaurant was clean. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food and the fresh taste. Staff was friendly and offered great suggestions.

An American culinary fusion of wraps, salads, burgers and bowls, choose from one of the two parts of the menu: the healthy side, or the not so healthy side. I'll admit, I chose one of each, which my heart gratefully thanked me for but my waistline hated. Order at the counter to dine in or to-go, and wait for your stomach to enjoy. 

Be forewarned: the font size of the menu is itty bitty tiny. So, if you're blind like me, remember to grab your reading glasses out of the car. 

The atmosphere is welcoming with a 70s hippie, modern hipster vibe that makes your tofu bowl and brown rice fit right in like a hot dog at a baseball game. Don't worry, they'll welcome your fried ahi burger too. 

They also have their beer license, which complements well with their large TV projector against the wall. Watch a sports game with some truffle fries, and appreciate the SkinnyFATS joys of life.",DLFsh9efiyvubidumNb54g,0,0,5,Q4hmJsWi-9KgdTgSYNf-vA

I got the chicken & waffles, which I thought was okay.  They used chicken tenders instead of bone-in chicken.  The chicken tender was a nice twist, but I prefer the chicken in bone for the juiciness.  

We also ordered the truffle fries.  So, why the 2 star?  Well, one of my pet peeves is that the food should come out hot.  The food we got was luke warm to warm only.  It was like it was sitting out for awhile.  The fries came out first and it was luke warm, so maybe it was just the fries - NOPE.  Our meal came out and it was warm too.. Not a good sign.  they need to get the food out quicker to the customers or invest in some heat lamps to keep it hot.

2543691,2017-11-19,1,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"I have been a long time patron of SkinnyFats. But after our visit this morning, I can sadly say that no more.  I ordered for breakfast, as I always do, the Steak Eyes (with my eggs over medium).  

When my meal arrived, I was dismayed to see that not only had the eggs not been cooked as ordered (they came over easy), the steak medallions were considerably smaller than they usually are (think a third of the size) and the biscuits had been replaced with what appeared to me to be a cornbread muffin.  I let the staff know, and they informed me that they had just changed the menu and that the new jalapeño cornbread biscuits were now standard.  Fine, I figured, I'm open to trying new things.  But the tiny fillets were a major disappointment.  In any case, I sent my eggs back to be cooked correctly.

I waited five minutes as my companions began eating their meals.  When my food arrived, the eggs were AGAIN cooked over easy despite my explicit request that they be cooked over MEDIUM.  At this point I said ""f*** it, I'm hungry"" and ate it anyways.  I was already behind my party and decided to eat it as is.

Needless to say, this visit was deeply disappointing for a few reasons.  First of all, the recent ""menu change"" clearly translates to much smaller portion sizes (two of my companions, who have also been SkinnyFats fanatics for years, also noticed that their portions were more meager than usual on the sandwiches they ordered).  Secondly, it's clear that there is zero quality control from the kitchen.  The fact that my eggs were screwed up not once, but TWICE, was frustrating to say the least.  

At the end of the day, I'm bummed that one of my favorite local eats has let itself go by forgetting the formula of customer service and quality that made me fall in love with it in the first place!  RIP SkinnyFats.  You will be missed.",USbfD7i0BwAcHymoNpLHvA,2,0,2,I6dVauf7wHQqJuDtCbLRpA

2647061,2015-02-10,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"Let me begin by saying, I love Skinny Fats. It is definitely one of those places you have to visit before you truly understand the high reviews this place receives. My mother raved about this place for months before I made it in for the first time. The quality of the food is outstanding and each menu item is unique. 

I would give this place 5 stars but there was this one incident...

I was waiting for my to-go food and happened to overhear an order taking place. One customer asked the employee what ""GF"" meant on the menu. The employee told the customer that it meant Gluten Free. But the real kicker was when the customer asked what gluten free was, the employee had NO idea.  I'll admit that I did stand there chuckling at first, later I realized how embarrassing this really was. I almost jumped in and answered for her, but I saved her the embarrassment and let the customer order it anyways. 
Granted, gluten free is not as common as lets say, sugar free. Employees should still know what the menu items are/mean. 

Other than that, I recommend this place to everyone. For all of you yelp readers out there, here are a few general tips that I wish I knew from the start..

Tip #1: If you are ordering the sandwiches, eat there. Taking them to-go is not the best idea. The bread can be soggy, but nonetheless the food is still enjoyable. 

Tip #2: At least half the time your side should be the Slaw Chee. Absolutely fantastic. 

Tip #3: If you are ordering to-go, call and find out what the specials are. There are plenty of items that are not on the general menu that are available to order. 

Tip #4: If you do order to-go, you can skip the line of people waiting to order. This line can be very unappealing and somewhat frustrating as you stand there and listen to all the little questions each customer has. Simply walk up to the front and say you have an order to go. I was told to do this, so I assume it is a common understanding among the employees and customers.",8Es0EjM8WqWuX9wdkPzGAA,0,0,4,zs_CkN8T4vuOkPbvVyiy-A

The truffle fries that came with it was seasoned with parsley I believe, and then something else that I can't put my finger on.

Located conveniently off Durango and 215, this place offers the same healthy and happy foods for those of you who live on the westside, without having to drive over to Dean Martin. A few months ago when I found out some of my favorites were going to be cut from the menu, I was a bit sad, but eating here recently confirms that those cuts allowed them to really focus on their current menu offerings and really improve them. Some of my favorite items are the Wrap Supastar - healthy, but delicious take on a breakfast wrap. The chicken is unbelievably not dry and the produce they use was so fresh. For those of you looking to be happier and splurging, get the Steak Eyes for breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are so much better than the standard fare you get at any old regular breakfast spot. Their cold press juices are also well made and come in reusable, dishwasher safe containers. There's also a patio out here that makes you feel like you aren't in the middle of a strip mall and a drugstore is just right across the street - very well done! My couple of gripes - my chocolate chip cookie was harder than usual, instead of chewy like I'm used to at Dean Martin location, and headlights of cars parking right in front are pretty blinding.

I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time. When Island Flavor was closed up the street, we called an audible and decided to finally try SkinnyFATS.

I ordered the S'motherload ($11.99), which is a breakfast style burrito with steak, sausage, and peppers, mushrooms, pico included. My friend ordered the Hot Mess, which is a bowl that includes  flour tortilla, chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalapenos, sour cream & jalapeno ranch sauce ($9.95).

The S'motherlod was actually pretty good. This isn't a burrito that was meant to be picked up and eaten, but enjoyed using a fork and spoon. It was good, but not nearly worth the price tag. More like $7 dollars.

The Hot Mess was an epic disappointment. The chicken was way too salty. There was the tasty of salty chicken, jalapenos, cheese sauce....it was such an awkward mish mash of things that did not lead to a pleasant taste. It was so unsatisfying that I had to stop and grab something to eat on the way home. Seriously. 

Service was nothing to write home about either. The girl at the counter who took our orders was pleasant, but the waitress was borderline rude and argumentative. Seating was also cramped and uncomfortable. I understand it was during a busy time (Sunday, 6pm), but it was pretty claustrophobic.

These 2 dishes plus 2 small sodas ran us $29.05. So, that means the sodas had to be in the $3 to $4 neighborhood each. 

Ugh. Totally not worth it.

This is definitely a ""one and done"" for me.

Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian.

The first time at this location, I got the chickhumm, which is a chicken breast sandwich with hummus and sprouts.  Skinny side.  It was good, but not oh-my-gosh.  I've learned that I need to only get stuff from the fat side!

The last time I went there, I got the sweet cheesus, which is a steak sandwich with nacho cheese and hot peppers.  Totally more my style!  

I sent my hubby here and twice he got stuff from the skinny side and said it was decent but not excited to go back.  I told him that he needs to get stuff from the fat side, obviously!  I mean, I'm glad they have those options, but we eat healthfully at home usually, so I'm just going to continue only getting from the ""happy"" side.  :)

It is open until 11pm, which is great for us, because we can pick stuff up after work (hubby works late and it's hard for us to get food after 10pm).  For that, we are thankful!  Also, the price is very affordable.  I'd rather spend $12 on an OMG sandwich than go to Subway late and spend $6 on bleh.

I have had both sides of the menu and happy to me is always better. :) The first time I came here I was trying to eat healthy and order sweet potato fries and eggs. They just weren't very filling or tasty. I came again to try a bowl. I got the smoke in a bowl. It comes chicken, peppers, pineapple, rice, and beans. It was OK. It wasn't very flavorful and just didn't fill me. I really love the black cheery soda they have tho. So tasty! Also they have lemon and cucumber water for guest. The last time I came with some friends and ordered from the Happy side. I did get a salad, but I got the Hot Chix. OMG, bleu cheese party in my mouth. It comes with buffalo chicken, avocado, pico, fried jalapeno strips, bleu cheese and buffalo ranch. It was so good! So much great flavor and it was so filling! My friend got the spicy cauliflower and said it was so hott. She also got some kind of chicken sammich and said it was very plain and also not filling. Honestly, I need to stick to the Happy side because it makes me happy! I always see they special on Facebook and I think i need to try their cookies and sundaes. They look amazing!!!

The seating is limited though since it's usually busy.

I'm sure the person before me didn't realize it wasn't shut all the way, so when I pushed it, the door opened and I accidentally walked in on her (oops). We had chosen carry out and when we got home, I realized they forgot an item. I called the store and the person I spoke to, I believe her name was Megan, was happy to help me.

What I received for $10.00 was a bowl full of sweet fries, 3 small pieces of chicken, literally 3-4 cranberries, a sprinkling of feta cheese, and barely any arugula.

One of the servers there (Stephanie) was extremely rude. It is 3pm and there are only 5 tables occupied, it is not busy at all. When Stephanie brought us our soggy cold food, she did not ask who's food was who's, she just set it down like she couldn't leave fast enough and snatched the number off our table. And to make things worse, she grabbed utensils and literally tossed them on the table half behind her back since before she could even bother to properly set them down she was already in a hurry to walk away.

It's the perfect venue because my little ones aren't vegan, so it makes it easy for everyone in the Fam-bam to enjoy a meal together without cooking 4 dishes! 
My last and favorite part of dining at SF is the service! Even before I was a regular, everyone was super amazing and friendly!

Tonight the family and I went. We ordered at the counter and our food came a while later. I have two kids and they always order the clucky toes. Kids grabbed a table and wife and I ordered. I ordered their clucky toes with plain fries. 

Food comes and there is only one order of clucky toes. I told the server we are waiting on another order and a minute later the cashier (Asian female with an attitude) comes over and says ""you didn't order two orders of those ) and drops the receipt on the table to show me. To her 
 Credit she read the order back to me when I paid, but I could not hear her so I just said "" sounds good"". There was a crying kid right next to me in line. 

Here is where it went south. I have ordered for my kids for the last 10 years. I have never, not once, forgot to order for one of them. In fact, when said Asian female with attitude took my order , she said ""you want plain fries in both of them?""  It was almost like I was made to feel like I was trying to cheat the system the way she accused me. 

Maybe a better approach would have been, ""I'm sorry, I checked the receipt and there was only one order paid for.""  But it got worse. 

I told her, well I need another order as my daughter has no food to eat and I pulled out cash to pay (I am not trying to cheat the system and am happy to pay if an order was not charged for ).  She walks to the kitchen and asked the chef to fire another order because "" he forgot to order them"". 

Listen, I am not cheap, I pay for my stuff, but maybe some training for the staff would be nice. There is an easy way to not accuse anyone of forgetting and still get to a happy outcome   

I've been here prob 20 times since they opened in Sept, and have never forgotten to order for my kids.   Next time try the , I'm sorry it looks like only one was billed"" approach.

You love food and don't know what you would do without it, but hate the extra pounds it adds to your amazing physique.  Yeah, this place is golden for you. 

You walk in and are greeted with enthusiasm from the staff that works there. The decor is bright and cheery and one of the walls even boasts, ""live happy."" I can't imagine not being happy when walking into this place. The menu can be a little overwhelming because it is quite jam packed, but make sure to read it through before placing your order. You don't wanna order something in a rush and miss something you could really love.

I ended up going with the Chickawaffadopolis (basically chicken and waffles). It was AMAZING. The chicken strips were perfectly crispy and the waffle was delicious. My friend got the Cranburkey with a side of truffle fries. I stole some of her truffle fries and they might be some of the best I've had here in town. 

I also went with one of their coldpressed juices: the Summer Quench (cucumber, celery, Apple, and lemon) and it was great!! I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again. 

I think what I honestly enjoyed the most was the friendly atmosphere the staff treated the guests with. The person at the counter was amazing and super helpful since it was our first time. I will definitely be going back again soon!",FH4wHvhB95Yo7EBspN5Ulg,1,2,5,uv2rbevWvmpIOiIHkpuTZg

Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for amazing party food or even if you want a tasty bite to eat. I love that their menu is split up into skinny and fat, such a unique idea, and I also love their new location. A really lovely upgrade from their previous establishment.

I was mind blown! Hubbies best man said let's goto this place becuase it was like a healthy portion that he could have compared to our decision of going to robertos tacos....

Walked in and the decor was so awsome! Very chic and stylish and laid back. You just feel care free and kind of keeps your eyes constantly busy. Everything seemed refurbished like using crates to build high counter chairs and just pieces if wood painted to decor the walls and create the benches on the cute little patio. They have an open kitchen to be able to see all the delicious different foods that come out along with being able to see all the kitchen staff work so hard and still be happy ahahahaha.

Me being me i couldn't just try one thing coming into dine somewhere for the first time and I definately thought it would be more resteraunt style where I could sit and study the menu and after seeing the pictures of the food I totally thought it was a sit down resteraunt, but boi was i wrong! You first order at the he register and then they deliver the food to you and you get to grab your own drinks.

This place has 2 different concepts which is absolutely AWSOME for me becuase a lot of my friends are very healthy and i just am NOT! They have such a variety from SMOOTHIES....COOKIES....BREAKFAST....SHAKES....KIDS MEALS.... DESSERTS...SOUTHERN....AMERICAN....ASIAN...THE WHOLE SHABANG!
Luckily we had three people in my group so what I ordered didn't seem too extreme if it were to be just me and hubby but this is what we did

CHICKAWAFFADOPOLIS $12 * must say I was quite impressed with light batter on the chicken & the waffle was thick fluffy & crispy

REDICULOUS $11 * just the right amount of sweetness & some fresh fruit to cut through the creamy cream cheese frosting

WTFRENCHTOAST $10 * friend had this & it was the least of my fav.

HAPPYMESS  $10 * this was ORGASMIC addiction in my mouth with so many different flavors especially with the add on of a sunny side egg & Bleu cheese with diced tomatoes

ONE-EYED MONSTER $7 * creamy gravy goodness with a sunny side egg & some bacon strips

PIZZA-WAFF-ADOPOLIS $11 * just a pizza on a waffle... a twist of a pizza

LIQUID DEFENSE $8.50 * definately more on the healthy side 

PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE * they bake it for you!! 

STRAWBERRY-BANANA-NUTELLA SHAKE * love it but I only WISH that they had WHOLE MILK for the fatty side of people like me hahaha

They also have different kind of soda which aren't Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is unique

This was my first meal of the day and it was a Kickstart to an awsome day & I will definately be back to try many more new items along with the ones I have tried as well !!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,9,9,5,UYyqGzofz-ca_Zj-1EgjtA

I had the Green Mile (basically the juice of a ton of green veggies like cucumber, spinach and kale) and an Adobo Hobo. My husband had the Bleu Balsamic salad. He didn't realize that it came with steak so he ordered grilled chicken. It came out with both and that was okay because the salad was delicious and big enough for me to have a few bites. 

The Adobo Hobo is tangy yummy vegetarian goodness on a whole wheat tortilla. The Green Mile juice was just what I wanted - not sweet at all and full of green goodness.

Recently moved to the area, I've been coming to the original location and the Warm Springs location since they opened. The Warm Springs location just needs to work on the little details.

The food and beverage is phenominal, a consistently overcooked burger won't keep me from returning, but again, it's just the little details that could be improved to make it 5 stars.   

Recently they've been shouting Hello and greeting guests entering the door.  I find this to be annoying, just like Jamba Juice staff shouting across the store to greet.  Refinement.

The menu had a lot more options than initially expected and ranged from healthy to greasy. Prices were very much on the high side but the quality is right on line. Portion sizes are a little small for the prices as well which hurts my review of the restaurant. 

I had the bbq chicken bowl with brown rice and pineapple. It was a delicious dish and pretty filling considering it was pretty low calorically. 

I might come back because it is becoming a Vegas staple with the health phase zooming into sight in the area. And it's close to my work which is a plus.

I did order their Benny Special this past weekend and it was to die for! They always have specials that are not broadcasted on their menu, but rather on their social media pages.  You would have to follow them in order to see what the special of the day is!  Also, their pressed juice? So fresh and so yummy!

I love the decor in skinny fats also.  Very laid back and modern. Staff is always so friendly and quick to attend to your needs regaurdless of how busy that are (and they are always busy).

I'm giving it a five star based on uniqueness and customer service. Food and price were 4.5 stars.

We walked in and a sweet teenage girl greeted us and was soooo excited it was our first time and to tell us all about how to order. Then she hands us grown ups and kids menus and then tells us about the special screen menu that was scrolling all these delish photos of their specials. I thought I knew what I wanted going in...had to rethink by having a seat.

Decided, went to counter to order and got a number - this place is deli style? COOL! We were pressed for time so it was nice to cut the wait time out.

I'm looking around at their décor... Little hipster meets American picker. Place is smaller than I imagined... But cute indeed.

Food was quick to arrive and staff kept up with chipper attitude and making sure we had everything we needed. Honestly never seen so many polite teenagers before. Kudos to manager!

As for the meal: pretty awesome, perfect portions (not too big) and great flavor. We ordered all from healthy side except pancake and cookie (guilty exceptions).

I think everything we had was in the ""wow"" category and I kept thinking... ""How is this good for me?"" Pics speak for themselves.

I normally order the wrap superstar. My favorite even if there is no rice with it. It it is on the healthy side of the breakfast board. 

It's been a few months since I've been to skinny fats so when I walked in this morning, the menu board was different so it took me a little while to find the usual. However, I thought I'd be a little different and get something with fried rice. So I opted for the Mor Cow Bowl. Not my favorite at all. Let's just say that rice should be left to be made by asians. The rice was. Or cooked well that it was crunchy. I hate crunch rice. And I'm. It much if a beef water so the filet mignon was a little too much for me. 

With the negative experience of the beef teriyaki bowl, customer service is always good, atmosphere is nice and clean and the outdoor patio is welcoming but it gets a little too much sun in the morning.

Just as polarizing as their publicity, SkinnyFATS' menu has an interesting dichotomy; one half depicts health-conscious, fit-inspired meals, while the other half is diabetes incarnate. It's really odd to see 400 calorie vegan burgers alongside burgers that require needing triple bypass surgery upon completion. 

It's hard to define what's good and what's bad, because SkinnyFATS is such a hodgepodge compared to what you'd normally expect at a restaurant. What I will say is that anything you like, you will love. Recently I had the Naked Chix, which is Mango Basil Chicken with Jasmine Rice and Cilantro Mayo, and it was exceptional. SkinnyFATS also has everything dish labeled very well, whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, or eat gluten free like me! 

You may have to explore the menu a bit to find something you like, but SkinnyFATS does a lot of things right. This location specifically can get packed during peak hours, especially since it's right across the street from a gym, but it has something for everyone, regardless of diet, which definitely makes it a good option when you're out in a group.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,1,4,Bivnaos0nP9AFEXw76rN_w

I ended up going with a skinny steak sandwhich, the ""STEAKation,"" which is shaved NY strip with arugala, tomato, onions (I didn't get the onions), with a yougurt horseradish sauce, on a wheat hoagie roll. 

The hoagie roll was ridic!! It was so fresh, I would have just been content with that. The sandwhich as a whole was good. It would have been better to have a little extra steak and yougurt horseradish sauce. I did get a side (truffle fries) with this for the $11 charge. The fries were outstanding.

The sweet cheese us ($12) is always overflowing with shaved NY strip, peppers, onions and mushrooms. It's one of my favorite steak and cheese sandwiches when I need a quick fix. For something healthier, the skinny Q flatbread ($7) was decent with it's crispy crust and moderate amount of grilled chicken, cheddar and red onions covered with an agave BBQ sauce.

They've got a kid's menu too, but my son prefers a side of grilled chicken ($4) over their chicken tenders. Their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good. Served warm, the edges were slightly crispy, with a chewy and moist interior.

3559253,2015-02-11,1,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"Nice food concept. Are you feeling healthy or fatty? Good place to go if you and your date have appetites on opposite ends of the spectrum.

Be warned - this location is a little far from the strip. It's a newer location, but well worth the drive. There's plenty of seating inside with a large community table in the center. I like how their stools are 4 feet high. There's also seating outdoors. Overall ambiance: hipster. 

Food (all on the happy side):
1. Chicken n Waffles
Nicely fried (but not oily) pieces of chicken tenders. Served with a thick waffle and syrup on the side. This was GOOD, but not amazing. I ordered this because I was craving something along the lines of fried chicken and breakfast, but I wouldn't order this again. 

2. Ahi tuna taco
Not worth trying in my opinion. My expectations of ahi tuna is either RAW or seared RARE. This ahi tuna was neither. Tuna was deep fried, and the center was very dull pink. Comparable to tuna in a can? I'm leaning towards that put down. 

I would return to try other items on their EXTENSIVE menu. Which reminds me: 
Dear SkinnyFATS owners, please include some sort of pictures on your text-heavy menu. My eyes and alcohol infused brain do not have the attention span to read and decipher your food map.

Otherwise, rock on with Vegan Diabetes.",_I62JinFrlF_S0mMhOg6RA,0,0,3,1LBDwNvUcvnAC_lQplNpXQ

I had a waffle sandwich my last time out here, definitely a Happy side special, but it still wasn't so bad. While it was supposed to be a pumpkin chicken waffle sandwich, there wasn't much in terms of pumpkin flavor. That being said, the flavors were excellent.

My friend got the naked chix, which was pretty good with the mango sauce, but the rice is rather plain. However, we mixed in a bunch of habanero chili sauce with our order of truffle fries and the rice and everything got tastier!

I've enjoyed SkinnyFATS before, but the new location is both roomier and easier to get to for the majority of people. Their layout is fresh and modern, with a nice outdoor area really adding to the amount of people they can handle.

3592621,2014-11-08,18,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"I have never been accused of being ""hip"". In fact, having used the word hip in a sentence probably indicates how far off I am. But I've been around long enough to know that our attention starved society thrives on the mindless pursuit of trendy behavior that leap-frogs from fad to fad in a desperate attempt to stay relevant in a culture where being odd is more highly valued than being - well, just about anything else.

Traditionally, this type of pursuit has never served the restaurant industry well. Most attempts to shake up the culinary comforts of the nation as a whole have failed with spectacular results. Even those few dubiously places who manage to grab the attention of the culinary media, with a spotlight on some cable food program, usually end up falling out of fashion as fast as they rose into it. 

Trying to be different in the culinary scene is never as successful as trying to be better. There is a reason places like Franklin Barbecue in Austin Texas have people standing in line for hours every single day, they serve better barbeque than anyone else - in a place that saturated with barbeque. You could try and recreate barbeque in Texas - I mean, it's a stupid idea, but you could try. You might even get Guy Fieri to stop by on his road show, or have Adam Richman try to inhale 20 lbs of Macedon brisket in 15 minutes. If you do, chances are you will have massive success in your new stupid adventure (for a short time at least). But after your 15 minutes of culinary fame have ended and Guy no longer answers your phone calls, what you'll be left with is a small but dedicated troupe of regulars that can't afford to keep your stupid alternative barbeque restaurant in business.

Trendy but doomed restaurants are usually very easy to spot. Take for example this place called SkinnyFATS. See what they did there? Clever huh? They took skinny AND fat, and put them together in one place - - hash-tag: mind-blown - POW! 

I wish I could explain to you how SkinnyFATS dichotomy of culinary concepts works, how the fat and the skinny are magically brought together in one revolutionary concept, but - well, I have no idea. And from the looks on the faces of everyone else standing in line, they didn't know either.

You see, SkinnyFATS fancies themselves as being on the leading edge of cool, hip, trendy (whatever you want to call it) culinary fashion. So much so, that their menu is a clusterf**k of confusion - ""I mean a literal clusterf**k of confusion."" You see the name of the menu item, and read through the entire description under of its ingredients, and you still have no idea that they are talking about a stupid burger. I wasted an ungodly amount of time on the skinny side of the menu, and didn't figure a single thing out. In fact, the only thing I am sure SkinnyFATS has on their menu is a burger with cherry peppers, because that's what I ordered (of course, I had to confirm it was a burger first).

Now listen, the burger was really good! I mean it, I enjoyed it immensely. I will probably go back at some point, although I am not certain I will ever order anything else off the menu, just for fear of having an aneurysm trying to discover what it really is.

As for the trendiest of trendy culinary fashions on their menu, the truffle fries - well, they just plain suck. I mean it, stay away!  It's not real truffle oil, it's not made from truffles at all. It's a nasty chemical concoction that is made from petroleum and some cheap oil, and it tastes like crap. The fact that a single gram of truffle costs around $26 should alert you to how obviously fake these fries are.

The staff appear to be enjoying their time as the cool kids on the block, they have an air of superiority that is well deserved, since they are most likely the only people who know how to translate the menu. Don't get me wrong, they are the ""friendly"" cool kinds on the block - they're not likely to pull your shorts down to your ankles and laugh at you, but their collective indifference is plastered across their faces. Usually this type of unfriendly customer service is a result of being forced to labor for less than a living wage under greedy owners, but I'm only guessing - maybe young people just hate work all together. 

I am not disappointed in SkinnyFATS, in fact I appreciate the fact that they have chosen a moniker that is the culinary equivalent of a book with a picture on the cover of a muscular man (with long flowing hair) holding a woman (with a 12 inch waistline) in his arms - it pretty much sums up what's inside.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,14,8,3,739NXV9z1-j-jWSy0pCX3Q

Here is what I've tried on my two visits..  

Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis
Bomb Diggity Sandwich 
Liquid Defense Juice 

First Visit...
My husband I both ordered the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis and were both underwhelmed with this option. It was just alright and we both thought it was a bit bland. I guess we were expecting a more elevated version of this dish. I also ordered a juice to go since we were in and out in a hurry. The juice ended up being my favorite of the above items. I really like the 'Liquid Defense' which was a blend of orange, lemon, lime, basil, carrot, and apple. This was my first time trying basil in a juice and I really enjoyed the herbal kick it added. 

Second Visit...
I decided to come back and try something else with a co-worker for lunch. He ordered  the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (against my advice)  and I ordered the Bomb Diggity, My sandwich was served on toasted sourdough bread with thick crispy bacon. I ended up adding avocado to it. Avocado makes everything better. I liked my sandwich and he liked the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis with extra syrup (which just shows you that everyone can have a different experience with the same dish- it just wasn't my thing).

The decor and vibe is super laid back and casual. It has a funky and artsy twist to a casual cafe. They have a sweet outdoor patio to soak up our Las Vegas sunshine and one can't help but smile when you enter their cafe. The service has been was warm, friendly, and welcoming when ordering at the counter. The staff was eager to suggest items to try.

I got the Cinnutella ($8.95) which was not that great. I tried my best to finish it but I did not enjoy it all that much. My friend got the ""More Cow Bowl"" ($11.95), that was okay but it seemed like something you could find at Costco in the frozen food aisle. The meat was okay though. My other friend got the ""Filet O Fire"" with Truffle fries ($13.95). It was recommended by the cashier, thinking it was a burger... but it was a sandwich. The look of disappointment. The truffle fries was probably the best part of the meal. The sandwich barely had any filling, it was mostly all bread. 

Overall, there is nothing I ate at SkinnyFats that will make me want to come back.",7_V6mLM3WRmUOrZyYQNt_w,3,3,3,-7HMT76BYi45HGPz2GUoww

It was good but not great. I think the buffalo sauce was a little too empowering and the chicken was pretty soaked in it. I also wish it was stacked on top of the fries cuz then my fries were soaked in buffalo sauce too. Other than that, the service was nice and the atmosphere was even better.

This is the first time I've ordered a juice from here and will be the last. I asked to add 2 extra ingredients at $1 each and it was very apparent that neither been added to my drink. Normally I don't complain about things like this but it was already a pretty overpriced and honestly not good enough. $11 for a juice that didn't have the added ingredients is not a good way to sell your business.,nTqTtm-aAJrT2lV6D4wigg,0,0,3,aqP46G4iAfaIauOYBiDoTg

Well, after seeing pictures of some of the 'Skinny' side of the menu, I took a chance, and was so happy to be surprised!

I ordered the Applebottom french toast and it was delicious. I seriously could not believe that it was under 400 calories! A friend ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich and also really enjoyed her 'Skinny' meal! The men in our lives (of course) ordered off the other side of the menu and liked their meals just as much. The truffle fries that I stole off my husband's plate were amazing. 

We also ordered a pitcher of mimosas made with fresh squeezed orange juice. They were so, so good. If you didn't have some friends to split the mimosas with, though, it would be a bummer - they only sell them by the pitcher! 

This location was pretty crowded on a Sunday afternoon, so if you're coming at that time be prepared to sit outside.

The Meltdown: fantastic, filling sandwich with perfectly cooked meat, and tons of cheese melted together. The bread was also perfectly buttered and grilled to crunchy perfection. Came with tasty truffle fries.

Nice to Greek you: most delicious flatbread pizza I've had anywhere. There are so many flavors in this, it's definitely a must try. 

Cheezy peezy: they aren't lying when they say this is cheesy. It was good, although I wish we had out style meat on it to go with all the cheese.

Yummus: your standard hummus appetizer. Was good, though the pita was a little to hard for my liking. 

Bleu balsamic: steak and bleu cheese perfection! Tender cooked beef and sweet tomatoes and red onions to go with made this one of the favorites. 

Black cherry soda: get it! It tastes like a slurpee but better!

In addition, got a huge order of sweet potato fries. Those were great! But I can't really make a meal on sweet potato fries alone. People say it's vegan and vegetarian friendly here, but I honestly didn't see that many options. And I didn't want to be that annoying customer holding up the line asking questions. My partner really likes this place though, so I may be trying it again on our next trip to LV.

- great ambiance for eating IN, but its quick, made-to-order flow makes it a superior option for taking OUT.

- ideal for eating INDOORS, but there's also a beautiful patio if you want to eat OUTDOORS.

then there's the food part.

there are two sections on the menu, a 'HEALTHY' / SKINNY side and an 'EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPY' / FAT side, which contains the more caloric/indulgent entrees. seriously, each item on the menu sounds delicious and aligns so well with its respective section.

okay, and here's the real reason why i love this place:

they have my favorite beer (delirium), which is actually the only beer they have in stock (or from what i saw) AND they serve smoothies (my favorite beverage of choice). there's no way. NO WAY.

having stuffed myself to the brim during my trip in vegas, i opted out of the bottle of delirium and decided to go the healthy route by ordering the popeyes delight smoothie and the TBLT sandwich. the popeyes smoothie, which was blended with spinach, orange, strawberries, apples, FF yogurt and ice, was AMAZING. the turkey bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich was well-made and came toasted on a multi-grain bread slices. also comes with a free side. i cheated and got the truffle fries. it was heavenly.

(Notice to management- you had 3 servers/counter staff not seemingly busy)   We ordered the #Merica* - (shaved NY chicken fried steak, 2 biscuits and a side of 3 eggs), the S'motherload (steak, potato's , eggs, peppers, cheddar & pico wrapped in a tortilla with ""Cajun cheese sauce), coffee, and a cold-pressed apple juice.   Husband says the apple juice deserves  5 stars itself! The #Merica was fine. We had to ask for a side of gravy as there was only a scant bit on each biscuit. The gravy had good flavor and the biscuits were good although slightly crispy. Their take on a breakfast burrito was much better. The sausage, sliced thin, was excellent!  I loved the potatoes as well. I have to say it would be better if there was a version without the steak and more potato, egg & sausage, which I'm betting they would do.  At the beverage bar they offered water with cucumber & lemon! Refreshing! 

If I could offer 3.5 stars I would based on the juice and pretty good food. We would totally comeback to give them another try - hopefully the tables will be wiped clean by then.  Cleanliness aside, the staff was pleasant and did check on us several times. 

P.S. Hallelujah! At 10:30, one of the staff started to clean the tables although it appeared that an owner or manager type had walked in.",tAcY4S3vIuNlAoRlCcz5VA,1,1,3,4xmoFZXXUY1wMeaklyzGlg

The menu here is fantastic and offers so many excellent ways to mix veggies with rice and other staples. This is just a small sampling of what they serve here. When you walk through the doors a huge fan is circling above your head. It looks like a fan and that belongs in a bar somewhere next to the beach. When you proceed to the line there is a giant happy face behind you on the wall. It is a sign for the way the food is going to make you feel. Or I hope so.

The cashier was very friendly and pleasant. He answered questions that I had about the menu and the toppings on their menu items. I am so impressed with the customer service of the staff here too they take friendly to the next level ensuring that the guest experience is excellent. The service here is exceptional too. 

The food is absolutely wonderful with the smell as it sits in front of you overwhelming. It stimulates the old factory and starts the motor skills to pick up the fork sensation. Delightful smells fill my head and delight my tongue. 

I ordered the breakfast potatoes with only peppers. They were cooked to perfection and smell heavenly. The staff associate that brought my order to the table directed my attention to the various catchups that are only found here. With many varieties I found the Unipeppercorn the best flavor. One can taste just a subtle hint of the black pepper. The cauliflower rice that I ordered was divine too with the best smells coming from cauliflower at that.

I've been to Skinny Fats a handful of times. They offer healthy stuff like a fresh juice bar while offering a lot of indulgent culinary concoctions. Pick from the Healthy side or the Happy side.

This most recent visit I got a hot tea and the 'Merica. Perfectly named! As soon as the plate got dropped off I shouted, ""MERICA!"" . This dish included: two buttery biscuits topped with quality chicken fried steak, and creamy country gravy. It also came with three eggs any style. I'm still dreaming about their biscuits. They were so good!

The tea was a let down. They offer quality tea but just give you a cup of hot water to bring to your table. Refills on water are free, but hot tea should be served after steeping the tea bag. NOT A DEAL BREAKER! The tea they served was good but I think they should steep the tea for you. Just saying. 

I still think they should offer a server service as the customers would be more inclined to tip the staff! Their staff is awesome and already do the work. 

I recommend this place to everyone. Some other recommendations would be their chicken and waffles, all of their burgers, all of their flat breads/pizzas, and their two cucumber boats!

Everything we had was delicious! Great portions for great prices! It's a unique and fun experience. They go the extra mile with their food. Everything was exceptionally prepared and in a timely manner. 
The atmosphere is half between a sit down restaurant and a fast food. You start by checking the menu and ordering at the register then finding yourself a table where you place your order number for your food to be delivered. They check on you the whole time to see if you need anything as well as being you to-go boxes. 
There menu is split between healthy food and happy food. But if it didn't say that most of the things on the healthy side you would know were the ""healthy choice"". 
The juices were delicious as well as the ketchup choices. 
I suggest checking their Yelp menu for secret menu choices before ordering. 
I fully believe anything you order will be a great choice!

Also the tables are almost always dirty and you're lucky if you even get one. I am a vegetarian and one time I ordered a vegetarian meal (duh) and not only were there little pieces of bacon, but also steak.

It's the closest brunch place around where I live and I pass by it every day without really realizing that it's there. It more than met my expectations and I was absolutely impressed.

The decor of the place is superb. The inside is pleasantly quirky and the outdoor seating area very comfy. The menu was very interesting, with one side called the ""healthy"" side with calorie counts, and the other side the ""happy"" side without the calorie count. Naturally I went for the happy side. I got the S'motherload and the Skinnyfats punch, but I almost ordered the steak eyes too after seeing my neighbor getting it. The Smotherload was kind of like a wet steak and eggs burrito with spicy melted cheese poured over it,  and it was absolutely fantastic. The meat was very tender, and the rest of it was very tasty. I asked the waitress what they put in the cheese and she told me it was a secret ingredient and they cannot give it out, I liked that answer because it made me crave it more  All the items in the menu had very unique names and very thoughtful combinations. It showed how much effort they put in to invent these dishes. The Skinnyfats punch was a perfect combination of all the fruits that I love, combined in somehow the perfect ratios, in seriously the best fruit punch I've ever had.

The atmosphere is fun, with a super cute outdoor patio. The healthy breakfast menu is a bit small, but prices are not terrible.  I got the rosemary jane (chicken and waffles). The chicken was very dry and flavorless. I needed water to help it go down.  Yes...It was that dry.  The waffle was also very dry...more of a consistency like dry toast.    My friend got the 3 healthy chicks, and the egg whites were sooooooo bland.  Salt didn't help.   But the turkey patties were good at least.  

And while the food was bad, the service was even worse. The extra plate we requested never came, we had to hunt down our side of pancakes, and not one person ever stopped to clear our plates, so our table was overflowing with dishes. We had them stacked 5 high at one point and still no one stopped.

I give it 1 star for atmosphere, and 1 star because they have healthy options in a world with too few restaurants offering that.

First time at this location, we decided to indulge and go for the 'Happy' side of the menu. Since it was still early, we were in the mood for breakfast. Top of the menu was the S'Motherload. Wow. We sort of glanced at the rest of the menu, but that one sounded amazing with filet mignon, sausage, potato, fajita pepper and topped with Cajun cheese sauce and pico. Yep, we chose that one. Oh, and there was a case of incredibly enticing cookies at the register, so I had to have one of those as well. Definitely going for the 'happy' menu here today. 

As always, we split our meal. That might sound weird, but if we don't we are just too stuffed and miserable. Either that, or now we have to carry our food around with us while we run errands. Splitting works for us. Their soda was good. They serve Boylan sodas, which are made with pure cane sugar. It was a nice change from the 'usual' selections. 

They brought out the burrito on a regular plate, no plastic or paper here! Real silverware was nicely wrapped and secured in a black napkin. They even brought out a second plate for when we split it. The burrito looked great, and tasted better! The tender pieces of meat and sausage were a bonus. The tortilla was nice and thin, not overwhelming like some places. So glad we tried this location, as the Dean Martin location is just too cramped for us, and also that we opted for the 'Happy' menu and not the 'Healthy'.

We ordered the Cherry Popper burger, which had a nice kick from the cherry/banana peppers. The truffle fries came with the burger and were way overcooked and plain as hell. The Right Stuffed was a little bit of a let down, but when I reheated it at home, it tasted better... ?

We also had an order of the Tu-Nuts, which had extremely fresh ahi. That dish had so many different flavors that tied together so well. I usually stay away from sweet potato fries because they usually taste terrible but their truffle version was fresh and not oily. I actually ordered another serving to take home.

The food was pretty decent, but I'm docking a few stars for a couple reasons. One, I ordered my Smoke in  a Bowl without the chopped onion, which they not only forgot, but when the waiter brought it out, I mentioned ""I ordered this without onion"", not only did he not take it back to fix it, he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. 

Second, if you are going to advertise and claim to be a healthy restaurant, I would think you would do the obvious and put basic nutritional information on the menu, or even your website. Nothing.

And, the place is super packed most of the day so it is hard to get in there. Generally, there is a line around the corner on most lunch days, which is a testament to the quality of the food.

What I like the most about this place is their creative use of sauces. Instead of high-calories mayonnaise based sauces, they use homemade yogurt based sauces. This lowers the calorie count by a lot and makes it a much more light meal. Unfortunately, I cannot go to this location very often because of the wait to get in around lunch time.

If they were in a better location and had a larger facility, I would give this five stars for the food and staff.",9auFKOnjngvpgL4h3iwO4Q,0,0,3,UbR0dsDjXyuJW5Rie0D8Mg

I wasn't feeling that hungry so I ordered one thing from each side - On the fat side I odered the Tu-Nuts which is the spicy ahi tuna with sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat with almonds, avocado aioli. On the skinny side I got the Yummus which is a rosemary hummus with carrots, celery & flatbreads.

So when my friends suggested it for dinner, I was stoked. I was glad to come to a second location, to see how it compared. I'm 100% still in. Come to Southern California!! 

This time, I got the Caprizza - flat bread pizza with tomatoes, red onion, basil, mozzarella, and grilled chicken, drizzled with a balsamic glaze. It was amazing! Crust was the perfect blend of crispy but not overdone and slightly chewy inside. The ratio of toppings was perfect and it looked so pretty on the plate.

I come here frequently for lunch so I'm surprised I have not yet reviewed this place.

Everything is good. I personally enjoy their Chicken Salad, their Happymess Fries, and today, the Ahi Tuna Sandwich.. sorry I don't recall all their cute names.

Their juices and smoothies are delish too-- recommend the Cucumber Strawberry smoothie for a hot day.

Seating is first come first serve. But please, don't save seats if you haven't ordered yet. I guarantee that a seat will be available for you once you're ready to eat since that's how the system of turnover seems to work. Plus there are communal tables and an outside patio that you can resort to.

Parking sucks. I park by CVS and just walk over.

There's also a location on Dean Martin by the strip. That place is tinier than this with less parking. Also, it's frequented more by tourists.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,0,5,lOLuYWnK4OnknhKa1GZWZA

I walked in and was greeted by friendly waitresses. You order at the front from either the healthy or happy (aka unhealthy) side, or maybe from both. Then you take a seat with your number and wait for your food to be delivered. We opted to eat at the patio since there was more privacy and heat lamps were present to keep us warm.

They also have alcohol available if you want. If you're a penny-pincher like me, then most likely you'll opt for the free cucumber water.

I got the Chicks on Broadway from the happy menu. It was a deep fried chicken breast with bacon and a green tomato along with some other garnishings. It came with a side of truffle fries.

At the patio table we were at, there was the very necessary napkin dispenser with a variety of sauces, including regular & jalapeno ketchup and chalula.

The food, decor, and experience were all very good and I had a pleasant experience here. The only reason that I can't give this place 5 stars is the prices. They're pretty high.

They have limited seating to begin with, and since the place is popular, it's always busy.

Very good food, again. But, I do have to be honest in saying that there have been multiple times I have opted not to come here and have gone somewhere else because I didn't want the headache of not finding a seat. Often times when you do, you're forced to sit at a table that still needs to be bussed, or if it has been bussed, goes without being wiped off.

Just imagine a restaurant where you have both an ""Indulgent"" (AKA Fat menu) and a Healthy menu; it will please any and everyone in your party. I had no idea what to order when our friend took us here but the cashier was super friendly and helpful and had a few recommendations. She also let us try some sort of slushy drink as well which was nice of her. 

I ended up ordering the ""Avocatoast"" which is essentially Avocado toast because I am a basic millenial trying to be healthy. Even though this was a very simple dish, it was one of the best I had during our trip to vegas. The avocado toast was delicious: it was piled high with guacamole on a perfectly toasted toast and topped with feta cheese and a fried egg. It was also surprisingly filling and didn't make me feel overly stuffed. 

They have all day breakfast which is a bonus. They have everything on this menu from chicken and waffles to burritos to tacos and soups and they pretty much have the ""indulgent"" and healthy version of every dish. 

What's pretty cool is that they have a raw juice bar connected to their restaurant! What is pretty cool is that you can either order one of their drink combos or customize your own!

But she was able to find something she liked on the menu. She chose the chicken and waffles. I like that you have the choice of the healthy side or the happy side. I like a place that can accommodate different tastes and styles of eating. I truly do like the happy food but really should be eating the healthy food. So I'm glad that my grandmother was able to get something from the happy side while I dined only from the healthy side. We ordered way too much. I ordered the two tacos: the Ahi tuna and the steak taco on the healthy side. I also ordered a kids size whole wheat pancake as a dessert. The tacos were about seven dollars and the large kid's sized pancake was only four dollars. My grandmother had the chicken and waffles and was also craving some sweet potato fries. I think the entire meal was $35 total. It was well worth it and there was a lot of extra food. I have never seen my grandmother eat so much. She ate the entire chicken and waffles. It came with four chicken tender strips and a large waffle. She loved it! My tacos were just OK. The meat taco was really good, kind of had a Mediterranean flavor to it. That he taco was bland and kind of boring. I probably wouldn't order it again. The four dollar pancake was a steel  (see picture). It is large and filling and enough for one adult person. The sweet potato fries were tasty, crisp, and hot. I tried a bite of my grandmother's chicken and waffles and thought it was very good too.

I ordered a burger that came with two 1/4 lb. patties, two different cheeses and spicy mayo (which I requested on the side). I also added bacon and requested no bun (they didn't offer a Lettuce wrap, so I assume they don't do that?). For my side I picked the Truffle Fries based on my cashier's suggestion. I took a number and sat down. They were nice enough to package everything to-go - I ate what I could there and took the rest home. 

Both the burger and fries were on the greasey side which is absolutely ok with me! The burger was juicy, simple and delicious. The fries had that great Truffle flavor, but needed a little salt in my opinion. 

I also grabbed a cookie for later. It had caramel, pretzels and huge chunks of white chocolate chips. I was happy to have it at home so that I could warm it! This cookie had quite a chew to it thanks to the caramel and great Crunch from the pretzel bits.

While passing through Vegas, I always get excited to stop at SkinnyFATS because of the plethora of different choices and flavored of food they offer. While passing though town today I worked up an appetite for a plate of chicken and waffles and I'm probably not the first to tell you that SkinnyFATS has hands down best chicken and waffles I've ever had (ever!). The waffle is light crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The chicken on top is lightly breaded, deep fried and is so juicy! It is served with a light dust of powdered sugar and a cup of maple syrup on the side. Absolutely LOVE the sweet and salty combo of this dish. I've been to both locations in Las Vegas, and are equally satisfying and great. I WILL be returning :)",Y9cc6iVJ4JbV4B0_04Nazw,0,0,5,7B_2Wpf0aSaHq7kPV2XAow

Finding a healthy and innovative menu with quality ingredients is hard to find in Las Vegas, and Skinnyfats does a great job.  I've only ordered off of their healthy side, but everything that comes out of the kitchen looks great.  I wish they had a couple more salads on the menu, because they understand the concept of high quality greens & salad dressings, and don't drown the salads with the dressing.  

I was all set to give it 5 stars.  However, this last visit, I made the mistake of showing up at lunch time.  The inefficiency was hard to watch.  I used to go to a similar size restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating in San Francisco which also had just one cash register going, and delivered the food to the tables via number.  Night and day difference in terms of getting customers through the process from arrival to departure in a timely manner.  Skinnyfats has a salad called the slow boat to china - we were all making jokes that the line should be called the slow boat to skinnyfats.   .

We ordered delivery via Postmates and received our order within 30 mins.  Nobody really complains about fast delivery but that should have been our first warning.  We did receive our food hot, I ordered the Chix on Broadway sandwich with a side of truffle fries and my husband ordered the Bomb Diggity with a side of yummus pita.  The breaded chicken on the sandwich was bland.  It had absolutely no flavor in the fried batter.  Also, the bread on my husband's sandwich tasted old and rubbery and his sandwich in general was justcompletely dry.  The yummus was also very bland.  Everything tasted like it was prepared days before.  Honestly, we would've been better off ordering from McDonalds.

Today 8/22/2016, I went here for lunch with some co-workers and the line was long so I ordered online which was not a problem.  Some of us waited in line to order to go.  I had placed my order and was given a time the order will be finished and mind you that my order was placed 5 minutes before the co-workers that waited in line.  I ordered the Ahi Srirachi and  Ahi Taco-San.  My co-workers ordered the Meltdown (medium well) and the other ordered Filet O Fire(well done).  Their order came out before mine and my order was finished 15 minutes after the given time.  We bring our order to work to eat and my Ahi Taco-San was delicious as normal but my Ahi Srirachi was not so.  The ahi was rubbery which normally means not fresh.     My co-workers Meltdown which she ordered medium well was at medium rare.  My other co-workers Filet O Fire which she ordered well done was about a medium.  So I guess you get your meats 2 levels down from where you want it.  I usually go here 3 times a month but I will not be coming here for awhile since there are many other options now in this area.  Maybe it is a new cook that they have or something.  This restaurant was one of my favorites but service and food quality is dropping.

I went back to Skinny Fats at a later date to give them a second chance and the food was delicious as normal.  I guess they had an off day or something but I will be coming back more often.",hB60vBj-0Ua0NLjMCn4jqQ,0,0,4,KmXDYXu8dEjGxaz6X8OSHQ

The 1st time I went, I had the chicken & waffles.  It was alright.  The chicken was seasoned & fried nicely without it being overly greasy.  The waffle was fluffy but that's where I had a problem.  It was almost too soft.  I had a hard time cutting it up.  It kept tearing & falling apart.  The idea was awesome & had the waffle not been that consistency - maybe more crisp - I would've loved it.  As for a drink - I ordered a mocha.  The 1st mocha I got tasted like burnt coffee.  No chocolate flavor at all.  I asked that it be replaced.  The 2nd mocha tasted like the 1st.  I got a bit of attitude when I explained that it tasted the same & I was in a rush to go, so I didn't bother asking for a replacement.  I just drank some of their complimentary fruit/veggie infused water.

The 2nd time I went, I had the red velvet waffle.  I wanted to see if all the waffles were the same as the one with the chicken...plus it's red velvet with cream cheese frosting - who doesn't want that, right?  That would be me.  The consistency was the same.  Too soft, kept tearing apart.  Reminded me more of a shaped pancake more than a waffle.  The cream cheese frosting was good but between the frosting, the chocolate chips & the waffle itself, it was a bit much for me.  This time I ordered a straight coffee so that the mocha incident wouldn't repeat itself.  It was ok.  Your regular coffee.  Nothing exceptional about it.  This time my boyfriend actually joined me & I tried some of his food as well.  He got a wrap from the healthy side & some truffle tries.  The wrap wasn't bad but the fries were delicious!  He got a soft drink which we were both impressed by.  We liked the variety of soda flavors & that it wasn't your typical fountain selection.

The 3rd time I went, I decided to try the drunken monkey pancakes.  I figured their waffles reminded me of pancakes so maybe they exceeded in the pancake department.  They were good.  VERY sweet.  Very rich.  The bananas, marshmallows, chocolate sauce & everything on top together worked better than I thought.  I could only finish 1/2 the order because of the sweetness & I think next time, I'd ask for no marshmallows (not a huge fan).  The bacon on the side was actually my favorite part of the whole dish.  Mmm...bacon.

The service was alright. Friendly (except for the mocha issue) & fairly quick given the fact that they are always busy.  If I had one suggestion, it would be to use BOTH cash registers when you're packed.  Each time I went in, there was only 1 girl taking orders/working the registers.  

I'm sure I'll end up back there at some point.  Hopefully I find something I really love otherwise it's bacon, truffle fries & fountain drinks for me. Ha.",vb4Y_Kw9JGS6DKgSQE_XrQ,0,0,3,_u9R63YrD0x3QTpuXODU-Q

Sweet Cheese Us- sorry was not impressed.  Did not taste or see any meat.  It was tasteless and boring.  It tasted more burnt and charred then anything.  I threw half of it away.  Couldn't even bring myself to eat it and not let it go to waste.

Wrap Supastar-  looked really good but was also tasteless.  I had to season it with salt and pepper.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled, wish it had some flavor to it.  Luckily the cajun cliantro lime yogurt sauce was tasty so that helped.  Won't be ordering this again.

The ahi srirachi tacos are still my favorite after all these years....been coming here before it was even hip at the dean martin spot...
Thank goodness the warm spring location opened =)

I had ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed at all! It looks small but omg! It was so filling and had so much! The chicken was so tender, it was cooked to perfection. 

My cousin order the buff chics which is buffalo chicken strips! That was so good and she had truffle fries which are the best!

My other two friends ordered sweet things like the drunken monkey cakes, which is super sweet, big, and delicious, (it has bananas and marshmellows!) and unBRIEleviable, which had berries and Brie.

There is a Skinny ""Healthy"" Menu (for those who are dieting and those who are health conscious about what they eat) and a Fat ""Happy"" Menu.

I love going here with friends because I'm usually that one person that is dieting or ""tries"" to eat a little more healthy that when going here I never feel bad because both me and my friends are happy. Yay! :)

I love the Ahi Sirachi Taco (3.95)- it was a light Ahi Tuna Taco over a wheat tortilla that had slaw chee, mango pico, teriyaki sauce and spicy-yo aioli sauce. The sauces are perfectly zesty, spicy and sweet. I did not feel guilty or overly full after eating two.

Also got a hold of that secret menu and ordered the Fat fries. Those fat fries though... If you love garlic and cheese; you'll love em!

4872918,2015-11-05,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"If you've never been to SkinnyFATS, then you're probably in for a treat. At least that's what Toni and I thought after walking into the Warm Springs location. At first walking into the two front doors felt like we had just been transported into a friendly neighborhoods backyard, complete with friendly greetings from the staff and chatty tables all around. If I could pinpoint a feel to it, it would be the, ""Casual California Weekend Backyard Meetup"" feel. There was also an outdoors section which was a welcomed sight to see, complete with backyard wood fence and comfortable seating between both sides.

The walls are colorful with wood boarded styles. The staff is clearly visible working the meals and making sure they go out within reasonable times through a kitchen half window. The front counter shows the large selection of funny titled selections, including sections that clearly distinguish between healthy conscience choices and the equally awesome listings by the simple color and title columns of ""Healthy"" & ""Happy"". 

In between Toni and I getting the cleverly hilarious food titles and possible movie references, we wondered on how the healthy and happy choices actually differed, but then we just looked at our hungry faces and shrugged and ordered what sounded good to us. There were several choices, most of them with their own sections and categories between sandwiches and bowls and even breakfast sections and pressed healthy juices and desserts.

On the drinks side, we were surprised with the lack of usual labels only to be equally excited about trying some real cane sugar sodas. Something that is usually overlooked until you try to scratch the recesses of your mind and picture something similar or better than the Jones sodas you randomly had growing up, then combining that with all of them being different flavors coming out of a soda fountain. Our minds were blown as we were recommended by the lovely cashier to try out and mix ""Cream Soda"" and ""Black Cherry"" and we just let it happen. I had one of the two unsweetened (I'm diabetic) iced tea flavors and some of the cucumber iced water. 

Toni decided on the ""Bomb Diggity"" - ""applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, lemon herb aioli on sourdough, sandwich.""  that came with some ""delicious"" sweet potato fries on the side. I'm not sure if that was due to us being hungry or the sandwich just being that good but her only complaint was that the bread was a little rough. It's sourdough, it was meant to be a little rough around the edges, it's not the bread's fault.


I decided to go with the ""Hot Chix"" salad bowl. ""Chopped buffalo chicken, bleu cheese, pico, avocado and fried jalapeno strips over romaine tossed in a buffalo ranch.""  Clearly the winner here for healthy choices. Not only did I get the awesome taste of some well-cooked seasoned boneless buffalo chicken nuggets tossed with greens, but the blend of ranch and avocado presented in such a way that was inviting and not just clearly tossing my salad (apologies). As far as condiments, They had their own signature sauces which were flavorful and delicious on specific plates, but I had to give them props for including the rare green habanero hot sauce. Though the food was amazing on it's own, I love me some spice as well as flavor, and the 3rd party habanero hot sauce was a definite welcome in my book. Tapatio would have been my second choice instead of Cholula.

The portions were great and the music and atmosphere complimented our mood of just feel good eats and laid back Bob Marley-like chill tunes. If there was anything else I would have changed, it wouldn't have been as balanced as what they have done with this well-liked and awesome location. 

The Good
* Great original food and drink selections
* Laid back atmosphere and music selection
* Service with a genuine smile and decent order to table times.


The Bad
* Only 2 locations (Dean Martin and Warm Springs)


Bottom Line
SkinnyFATS is a place for great original food at pretty decent prices without all the bling and glam of the inner city. You just head there with the mentality to kick back, enjoy some happy & healthy dishes, drinks and bring some friends as they will most likely thank you for it. Just make sure they return the favor the next time they suggest heading out anywhere.

We got there just in time because after we ordered a large line started to form. The Eggs Benedict of the week was eggs with mashed potatoes and strip steak with a demi-glace and cracked pepper hollandaise. The sauces on this were incredible and I hope they have this special again! The Sunday Sundae this week was a ice cream cookie sandwich with nutella buttercream on top. I mainly wanted this because I am in love with anything Nutella and it didn't disappoint. 

In addition to Sunday specials they also have many other specials you can find on their instagram or by stopping into the venue and looking at their special board next to the cash register. 

I will be back for many more Sunday specials!",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,0,0,5,1zb_tA-RcWRiHeV4uI4C_g

I actually really enjoyed this item. The country gravy was very rich and flavorful, the batter outside of the steak had a nice seasoning and the steak itself was perfectly medium-rare.  I asked for eggs over easy and they were. nice and runny. 

Also tried some truffle fries which were pretty good. 

Not all items on the menu are winners as I learned in my first few visits. I'd personally avoid the chicken and waffles all together until they change their recipe for the chicken. Way too bland. 

I'm avoiding the juices in the future. There's nothing wrong taste wise but I just don't see the value in them and I prefer to make it myself at home for 1/10 the price.",XOCyTfXy26xi4gZeun9v9w,3,3,4,bQ_Vt0iBCkd31Jam3zhTQQ

I have eaten here several times and the food pure quality and has that rustic farm to table touch. Great menus for kids not to mention the specialized sodas. We were lucky enough to be the first to try their cold press cocktails. A mixture for fresh juice & booze so you don't feel like your being bad.  Try the filet o fire if you like a good meat sandwich.  Hipster are welcomed.,z7KZbn2705aEvsajPw-BNA,0,0,5,u_4odl1IB3xza1vjwFxWjQ

The menu is extensive(healthy menu & tastier menu) with a lot of details, it's probably best to know exactly what you want so you don't hold up a line. I ordered the chicken and waffles (chick-waffa-dop-lis). We sat down and it was packed(Sunday afternoon) but we managed to get a seat indoors. There was an outside portion but the seats were taken. I received my ordered after about 10-15 minutes. The presentation of my order was great. I felt the chicken was more on the tougher side, but overall I was good but not great. I felt it was a little overpriced as well ($12.00). The atmosphere was relaxed and the interior decoration was impressive.  Service was straight forward.

Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Cleanliness - 5/5

Overall - 5/5

Great place to go with friends if your looking for something healthy or something that makes you happy. This is one of the few places where it is actually somewhat pricey but I still enjoy going to it because I really like how the food is prepare and tastes. I normally sway away from places like this that charge a premium for the ""healthy"" niche but SkinnyFat does offer a great variety of selection that can help you be more health conscience but still maintain the flavors in the food. You don't have to sacrifice flavor for health.

The menu consist of a Healthy Side and a Happy Side. The menu mirrors each other meaning the items are closely similar, just varies a bit on ingredient choices and portion. 

--------------------------------------------Food - 5/5-----------------------------------------------­­­----
Healthy Side!

VegWich - $10

Very delicious sandwich with portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, jalapenos, banana peppers, spinach with some horseradish yogurt as dressing.  This was something that my friend got one visit here and I came back to try it out. It was absolutely amazing, I never though I could enjoy a veggie sandwich that much especially when basically a mushroom based sandwich.  The dish has minor kick from the banana peppers / jalapenos and horse radish, sweetness from the tomatoes and the well seasoned mushroom creating a flavorful dish.

Skinny Q - $7.00

I ordered this the first time I came to Skinnyfats. It was late at night and I wanted a item that wasn't too heavy right before bed. To my surprise, this was very flavorful. The grilled chicken on flatbread with red onions, peppers, and cheddar lightly dressed with BBQ sauce and Ranch had the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. Highly recommend this if you are craving for pizza and want a healthy alternative.

Slow boat to China - $7.00

Late at night once again after exercise, we decided to stop by for dinner. I wanted something very light once again and I thought the name was funny and ordered it. I was reading the menu item and it listed this as ""Asian Chicken Salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/ almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli""  For some reason I was thinking it was a salad, but it actually came out to be a full cucumber topped with asian chicken salad and the listed ingredients. To my surprise, I never knew a cucumber can be made into a full meal that was quite filling and delicious. After eating it, I was quite impress on how creative the chef was in creating this menu. It is not my favorite item on the menu, but I would recommend it for those that want to try something new or eat something light. It's basically a giant cucumber with dressing and chicken. 

Happy Side!

Meltdown  - $12.00

Two 1/4lb patties with caramelized onions with cheddar and spicy aioli on sourdough. Once again, patties were well seasoned, the mix of flavors from the sicy aioli and caramelize onions mixed perfectly with the patties and bread. It was a very well though out dish and quite yummy if you are looking to eat ""Happy"" tonight.

Special Item - Mac and Cheese 

I decided to try out one of their special items that was on the menu that one day. It was basically a giant bowl of Mac and Cheese with chicken friend steak like meat. (Wasn't exactly sure what it was). I am a big fan of Mac and Cheese and decided that I will spoil myself that night. It tasted great in the beginning but you start realizing that it was a lot of Mac and Cheese and got kinda boring as you kept eating it. Not a highly recommend item on the menu, but it was still very tasty.
----------------------------------------------­­­Service 5/5-----------------------------------------------­­­--
Service is great, employees are very helpful in helping you make a decision on the menu after it could be quite confusing your first time. The employees are very up beat and seems to embrace the companies culture.

Very clean atmosphere, great for lunch, dinner or get together with friends. 

Overall
Great experience and great food every time. It is one of my favorite places to go in the southwest with friends. Normally stop by there for dinner late at night when we want to have the option of eating a bit cleaner, or a great location during a lunch break. Also with the creative menu, there are always items I still want to try.",sCb9265DeUJLDIcvs03Owg,1,0,5,A_Bh63Z0EusiQCssmHK11Q

The waffle, burger and fries were just ok to me my son only took 2 bites of his burger and he LOVES burgers.

4926717,2016-01-20,4,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"I found SkinnyFATS to be just okay. The food is good, but these are dishes I can easily make myself at home for a fraction of the cost. BUT I guess I can understand the hype.  The food is just complex enough that people who don't cook a lot would consider paying the price for. It's good quality and all very well put-together but if you know anything about cooking, you can easily eat on that level every day.

We went in for lunch on Monday and it was busy but not overly packed. We were able to order within 10 minutes and got a table right after. Fiance ordered smoke in the bowl and a soda, and I ordered the naked chix.  We also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to share. The bill was a shocking $26. The service was great and we got our food pretty quickly, but again for that price I was seriously like, I could've just made us this exact dish at home. I guess it's worth it if you're feeling lazy and just want a good healthy meal out and about.

Also, I liked the Naked Chix way better than the Smoke in a Bowl. Much better harmony of flavors. The bbq sauce on the Smoke in a Bowl was a bit bland. We had added avocado but it didn't go well. We ended up putting the avocado in my bowl of Naked Chix and it was much better!

I ordered the Steakation on whole wheat on the skinny side. All in all, the sandwich was great. I definitely need to go again and if I order it again I will definitely add egg as a friend suggested.

The truffle fries were a bit disappointing. Reading the reviews were what sparked my interest to order it. Hopefully it was just a fluke but my order had very little truffle oil in it. I've used enough truffle out myself to know it. Flavor was faint and the smell was not there. Will definitely give it a try again next time I come.

The food choices are very unique, SkinnyFATS basically means two different type of meals. On one side of the menu you have the Happy side, which is the food that isn't the best for your slim diet, and tastes amazing. Then you have the healthy side, which is obviously more of the leaner selection, and also tastes amazing, and the price can't be beat for the quality of the food served. 

Also, they update their menu, and are very social media active for comments and feedback, to always improve to provide the best experience possible.

4983456,2015-03-22,0,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"This is a review of the Skinny Fats on Warm Springs, their Dean Martin location is smaller, but always amazing. 
  Every time I have gone to the Warm Springs location I have unfortunately had to wait 30 minutes to 45 minutes for a To Go order. The first time I ordered 2 of the Ahi Taco San with no mango pico and an order of the BuffChix. I know from going to the Dean Martin location that with anything made to order there would be a small wait, plus they were a little busy for lunch service. After 20minutes of watching people that came after me now receiving their food, I started to get worried. But I continued to wait, sipping on the complementary cucumber lemon water, which is quite refreshing. After another 10 minutes one of the staff asked if I needed help and told him that was just waiting for my to go order. He said that he would check on it and after another 15 minutes I finally received my food. A super tall gentleman said he was sorry for the long wait time and asked for my name, number and email so he can ""make it right"". I got home to my now super hungry wife and to her dismay, there was mango pico all over the Ahi Taco Sans. I  also haven't received an email/telephone call to make things right since (about 3 months ago). 
  Last night the same thing happened again. Except it was only 30 minutes wait and the good news was that there was no mango pico, the bad news was that her Ahi taco San was now cold. 
   Two out of Three times we have visited this location have been disasters. I love the Dean Martin location, and will probably continue business there. Still hoping you can make things right with a repeat customer.",Q4yCegI7ybqHY6IT_nBjeQ,0,0,2,vDufqrYTVX46eYceuIOu_g

The patio is very bright in the morning because the sun is shining directly on top of you. So not very pleasant and with their little seating inside. They originally charged me $6 for my kid's chocolate milk. Not a shake just milk with chocolate syrup. Then when I brought it to their attention they only refunded me two dollars. Meaning I paid $4.00 the same price as a kids shake. I always thought the prices were high but this was ridiculous. The only reason they get two stars is because of their cool cups.

Also got a veggie healthy drinks, absolutely delicious. Can't remember the name of it, but I think it contains carrots, ginger, and celery, there are more for sure.

I opted for the healthy/skinny options and ordered the bare chicken with the side of slaw chee because the cashier lady told me it was similar to kimchee and I go nuts for that stuff. 

The portion of my chicken entree was pretty good, I did not feel stuffed at all, maybe that's because it was part of the healthy options. It comes with a mango sauce which was pretty good with the chicken and the brown rice but I also came with some kind of cilantro dressing which I had no clue what it was for, it tasted very good but it didn't really mesh with the meal. 

I would describe the slaw chee as coleslaw with a bunch of random dressing, it was just alright.

5278371,2015-02-04,3,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"On the way to a friend's house who lives way out in the boonies (because Fort Apache is literally that far from where I live), I screamed ""THERE'S SKINNYFATS!!"" when I sighted this highly rated eatery. Luckily for me, my husband and I were both starving. 

Customer service is amazing! Right when we walked in a barrage of cheerful greetings were launched at us. The cashier was quite chipper and gave a quick overview of the rather large menu. I think my husband was overwhelmed by all the options, but decided on the Cherry Popper Burger after the cashier recommended it. I ordered the Veg-TO-Bowl. Wait time was about 7 minutes for the food.  

HELPFUL TIP: Check out the menu beforehand online at http://skinnyfats.com/skinnyfats-menu/ The menu at the restaurant doesn't have pictures and there's just so many options it's hard to know where to start. The online menu will better assist you in picking your order.

CHERRY POPPER BURGER ($12): This burger ain't kidding around. Topped with a fried egg and served on a Hawaiian roll bun, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Plus, it's gargantuan size is enough to intimidate the bravest of burger lovers. My husband enjoyed his burger but didn't care for the cherry/banana peppers inside. He said he wouldn't order it again on a return visit.

TRUFFLE FRIES: These fries were included with the burger. I only managed to nab 2 or 3, but we both liked these flavorful fries. 

VEG-TO-BOWL ($9): I ordered this because the ingredient combination was creative. The bowl consisted of bell peppers, tofu, and random pineapple pieces served on top of a shallow bed of ""portobello fried rice"". Teriyaki sauce and aioli sauce was layered on top of the bowl. 

I though I would like the pineapple but it turns out the flavor just threw me off. The tofu was the super soft and squishy kind. I wish there was more rice and more tofu in the bowl. The dominating ingredient were the bell peppers. This entree made me super thirsty! I think it was the aioli sauce. I wouldn't get the Veg-TO-Bowl again. It was good but not good enough to get it twice!

FOUNTAIN DRINKS($2-3): The soda at SkinnyFats is made with cane sugar. This soda is probably the best I've ever had. I had their equivalent of a Coke. My husband tried the root beer, which was also spectacular. The cups they give you are actually reusable! If you keep the cup, on your next visit you'll save $0.50 for a drink.             

PRICING: A meal for two came to $27 and some change. We weren't expecting that high of a price tag! There's also a tip section on the receipt after you pay at the register....

ATMOSPHERE: Totally trendy, but I love it! I seen a real live hipster on the premises. Tapered beard, curled up mustache, too tight clothes - the whole sha-bang. 

Return Visit? Yes! It just likely won't be in the near future since both SkinnyFats locations are sooooo far away from I live/work.  :(

Now open on Warm Springs Road with early morning hours starting at 7am it was finally on Saturday that curiosity led to breakfast at SkinnyFATS - a half-dozen item order that saw me seated next to owner Reed Slobusky as his front-of-house team of four worked diligently amidst newly refurbished digs of whimsically painted reclaimed wood rising high above concrete floors as tracks from Lorde played loud.

Expectedly the first patron of the day as the doors unlocked it was with a short explanation of the ""Live Healthy, Live Happy"" concept that I was greeted on entry and after piecing together an order to be delivered in two courses a table was selected - College Gameday projected on one wall while a flatscreen displayed the same for those soon to form a line.

Generally not one to dine-out healthy as my weekday consumption is essentially 100% 'clean' it was from the ""Happy"" side of the menu that breakfast began and with free WiFi plus an informative conversation with Mr. Slobusky helping to pass the time it was not long before the first round arrived; the juicy tenders atop a crisp yet pliable waffle pleasant yet predictable with pseudo-Maple syrup that unfortunately added little while the daily special ""One Eyed Monster"" proved a far more innovative concoction with smoky bacon adding just a bit of crunch to a breadbowl reinvention of traditional biscuits and gravy that likely won't find its way onto the Healthy side of the menu anytime soon.

Moving on to more happy things as Reed discussed everything from On Strip expansion plans to Boylan's line of soda, course two began with a triple stack of buttery pancakes beneath an pile of bananas, whip, marshmallows, and chocolate that entirely delicious even without the aforementioned 'syrup,' and once again eschewing any semblance of dietary discretion its tablemate UnBRIElievable would offer the best bites of meal with the eggy brioche proving impressively crisp around a core of molten cheese and fresh berries with while fresh basil and reduced Balsamic provided an aromatic finish that lingered on the lips.

Never one to invest in 'quick casual' or the kind to be caught off-guard craving a 'healthy' meal outside the home my appreciation of Mr. Slobusky's concept hinges largely on the fact that SkinnyFATS is a bit of an anomaly in the growing trend of 'quick and healthy dining that seems to be overtaking many local markets - not only because it is locally owned and operated, but also because it offers the sort of menu that is built to please all palates without seeming preachy or judgmental in the least.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,2,4,pDZRpW43Ec6YjG-m0F3g7g

5296873,2014-12-19,2,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"This place is an absolute overload. The restaurant interior has a LOT going on (in a good way) so it's quite an experience to soak it all in while trying to decide what to order for the first time. What kind of restaurant blatantly separates healthy from happy foods? Bonus points that this is their defining factor. You actually consciously make a decision whether to eat healthy or happy.

Of course it was my first time, so I had to go all-out. I decided to pop my Cherry Popper burger cherry with the Cherry Popper burger. $12 for a half pound of beef with cherry/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack, and a fried egg on a Hawaiian roll. The bottom bun was completely soaked by the time I got my burger, but it was sturdy while I ate it. Messy messy messy, but sooo worth it. For those who like spicy burgers, Cherry Popper is the one for you. Half pound is actually quite a lot of meat for the average person... or maybe I just have a small stomach. No regrets about the Cherry Popper. Hands down, hit the spot.

Anyways, I got my burger with a side of their Truffle Fries, which I am not a huge fan of. They were a bit overcooked, but they did taste like truffle oil. Kinda wish I went with the Sweet Potato Fries. Love all the other creative and tasty sounding options on the menu. I will be back for more!",adKonsQWY64vJYglPotH5Q,3,3,4,brPF_2GbePdgeMhMoe3wiw

They initially told me they won't make it but I argued that I had it made for me many times even though it was not on the menu.

I looked on their website for a contact us link (email) and there isn't one. I didn't want to speak to someone at the restaurant because who knows if it would make it to management.

The only thing that is less than favorable is the parking lot situation; it gets super packed at lunch and dinner time.  On lazy nights, it's the best alternative to actually cooking dinner for me and my love.

We're so addicted to their delicious, healthy options.  So here's a quick rundown:  50% of the menu contains calorie conscious choices, 50% of the menu is the 'Do anything--no holds barred' choices, with 50% of each choice being breakfast, and then 100% of everything they offer, delicious.

I've tried quite a few of their menu offerings, and to date everything I've tried has been amazing.  My absolute favorite is the Flat Chix, which consists of chicken breast covered in arugula, capers, tomato, red onion, cucumber, caper vinaigrette & balsamic reduction.  His top pick is the Naked Chix, which has seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, topped with cilantro yogurt.  Other items of noteworthy mention include the: 

Wrap Supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a whole wheat tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt

Slow Boat to China - Asian chicken salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli

Smoke in a Bowl - Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt

Also worth noting, you can add extra protein choices to any dish, or swap out the meat selection.  I'm kind of an ahi nut, so when I'm feeling splurgey I add on ahi to my dish. The add-on protein choices include chicken, portobello, steak, ahi, or shrimp.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,3,3,5,jWauzAR0k2B2PZ10K5cfUA

One day I decided to see how far off it would be for me to try this location and was surprised to find it takes about the same amount of time to get to from my starting point (UNLV).   

What if I told you that the menu, friendly service, and aggravatingly small parking lot all existed at this location, but that you didn't have to wait in a 30 minute line to place an order or reenact the Hunger Games scrum to get a seat?   (cue harps and angels singing)

You can read my review of the Dean Martin location for a more in depth description of the food I tend to order, but one of the great things also about SkinnyFATS is they constantly update their menu (for the better!) and test specials for possible inclusion on future menus.   I'm a happy guinea pig for their experimentations.

My favorite relatively recent discovery here is the Hot Chix bowl which is essentially a buffalo chicken salad.  I find it hard to resist ordering.   The Pimp Shrimp is also awesome especially when stealing an idea from their awesome server Kelly to replace the cucumber boat with brown rice.   That should be another point of emphasis: they are awesome with substitutions!  If you see something on the menu that needs a few personal tweaks, don't be afraid to ask.

My old favorites the Cranburkey and Cherry Popper burger still hold up across locations as well.  

Initially visiting this location felt a lot like cheating on the original.  Now over the course of the last year it's become wifey to Dean Martin's mistress status.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,2,5,vmdR0XhbqR2Qe-yHr485aQ

  Tonight we had the Caulifire appetizer. It's cauliflower in some sort of franks red hot type of sauce. Very tasty with just the right amount of kick. Next I had the Vegewich as my entree. It is a portobello mushroom sandwich on a wheat bun. It is vegan. Lettuce, tomato, avocado and some sort of vegan sauces dress it up and you get a choice of one side. I also ordered the Mean bean to take home and eat later. It is a veggie bean burger with lettuce, tomato, avocado and a spicy hummus dressing and choice of one side. I ended up eating half of each sandwich and taking home half of each. I am happy to say both were delicious and satisfying.

I ordered all items from the healthy menu:

Ahi Srirachi - A wheat soft taco with seared ahi, bunch of slaw, mango, pico & spicy yo-aioli. It was ehh

STEAKation w/ Truffle Fries - Basically a roast beef sandwich in a sense that uses shaved NY Strip...it was good and had good flavor

Summer Quench - Juice that contains cucumber, celery, apple & lemon...fuck I haven't had fresh pressed juice in a long time and this shit was lightweight refreshing. Little heavy on the celery flavor but it was good

She was also a little rude and asked me to pay for the ranch before she went and got it ""to save herself a trip."" It wasn't even busy so I was a little upset she was so demanding about it.

Caulifire - this is amazing and although it's listed as an appetizer I can definitely eat this as a light meal. The cauliflower tasted as if it was on the barbie, the smokey taste and then tossed in buffalo sauce. The sauce that comes with it helps cool down the temp but it will definitely linger after biting into it. 

Flat Chix - my honest thoughts, I didn't really care for this salad & it probably has to do with the fact I'm not a fan of capers. I did say no capers but realized the dressing had capers but didn't think it could be bad only bc a balsamic glaze was with it too. The chicken was cooked perfectly though.

5586482,2015-05-25,1,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"I must say, my dining experience left me a tad bit disappointed. I live in Southern California and have several friends that have had relatively, pleasant, sanguine dining experiences here. I've long since seen photographs of SkinnyFATS' entrees on Instagram and was intrigued enough to visit their website to get a better feel of what this place had to offer. The contradiction in the restaurant name, I found amusing, inviting. It sparked curiosity inside of me so great, across the state line I went, hungry to delve into the enigma that is ""SkinnyFats.""

 I really wanted to like to this place.

I ordered two items, one from the ""happy side"" and one from the ""healthy side."" I had both their ""Happymess Fries"" as well as their ""Skinny Q."" My order came to over twenty-one dollars with no beverage. 

The Happy Mess Fries, I found to be particularly pitiful. The menu claimed them to be truffle fries, an item, I'm not exactly sure they are knowledgeable in its essence. The shoestring fries were topped with New York Strip streak, pico de gallo, and bleu cheese. I suppose the food delivered, as what I received were bland fries, chunks of tomato, onions, cilantro, large chunks of salty blue cheese, and a single sliced canned jalepeno at the bottom of the *hapless mess.

What the fries were missing were a sauce--something to tie it all together, as opposed to being ingredients simply mountained on top of one another. They have ketchup and Cholua conveniently situated on the table, none of which did anything to remedy the hapless situation. Give me something creamy; give me a house made sauce with my fries. (2/5 Stars)

The Chicken Flatbread was alright. There was nothing memorable about my meal. I look back and think, ""Meh, I've experienced better"", although I found it to be ""A-Ok"", which is why I am giving this dish three stars (3/5). As for tips to improve the flatbread, I'd first recommend, seasoning the chicken. Again, season the chicken. If you didn't catch it the first time, season the damn chicken. Also, it'd be nice if you shredded chicken on my flatbread, so I don't have to take mouthloads of your bland chicken to the back of my pharynx all at once. At least give diners the opportunity of masking the bland chicken with the agave barbecue and ranch you've got below. (I'm on your side here). Also, portion size; on my flatbread was perhaps a single ounce of poultry. I have no problem getting dressed in the dark to put food into my stomach, but priced at $9.50, I felt robbed. ""Where exactly did the ten dollars that I payed go towards?"", I sat bemused in thought upon receiving my meal.

(Don't worry, below I have attached photographs to document my accusations.)


Overall, a poor dining experience and last taste of Vegas. Great concept; however, poorly executed. It is simple, rudimentary food they are attempting--chicken & waffles, loaded fries, flatbreads; it is nothing revolutionary, and they are falling short on production. Don't allow your eyes to fall prey to deception; the food is mediocre at best.

Three (3/5) stars for SkinnyFATS.",zdJ8UlERuMa8IMuBfs4iLA,4,0,3,YOzS-OItHlY16Tl77wOJzg

Half the menu is healthy, the other half not.. It would have been interesting if they posted the calorie count as well, but they didn't.. I also had to resort to their online menu for pictures. The food looks amazing.. Wish they had pictures in the restaurant. 

**something to think about, owners!**

Off the ""Happy Menu"" (unhealthy): We ordered the **CHEEZY PEEZY** which was extremely simple.. Flatbread with cheese and pepperoni.. But I liked it a lot.. Totally hit the spot.. It was my favorite item today actually.. 

We also got the **S'MOTHERLOAD** which is basically a really tasty steak breakfast burrito. The sauce that came on it was a tad spicy, and I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender and the eggs and potatoes were perfect.

Off the ""Healthy Menu"" we got the **AHI SRIRACHI**. Not because it was healthy, but I didn't like this too much. The flavors were lost on the sweetness of this item. There are diced mangoes in this taco and it completely masks the spicy. 

Overall I'm really happy with this place! I'm already dying to come back to try the Chicken Waffle's among other items!

We were there last night (8/5/15) after a really terrible early dinner. We got 2 Ahi Siracha and sweet potato fries with truffle sauce/dressing & 2 drinks. 

We patiently waited for an hour.  Wondering where the food was as others that came after us already ate and left.  We made mention to a passing waiter -- but it was Chasen that actually was the most professional. He introduced himself and made sure he checked on our meals. As well as keep checking back periodically to make sure we left with a smile. 

Not only did he corrected the situation. Simpathized with our situation. And went above and beyond expectations. And took it upon himself to represent the company in the most positive light.  Simply saying ""we don't roll like that."" Implying that SkinnyFats is an establishment that does care or doesn't want anyone to feel less important as a customer. 

To find this is already few and far inbetween for places in Las Vegas. This place and it's employees  (Notably Chasen) -- make a place worth going to time and time again.  And the amazing food is a plus!!

I hope that management will see and recogize this individual.

The interior is very unique with paintings all over the walls with quirky quotes and the whole place just had a very urban industrial-esque feel to it. Upon one glance at the menu, i could not hold my giggles in because all of the items have very funny and puntastic names.

I finally decided on the ""cherry popper"" and my friend had the ""#America"". They were botj delicious! The cherry popper was a burger on a hawaiian bun with hot and sweet peppers and a bunch of other things i cannot remember anymore. But i just remember it being so good, especially with the truffle fries on the side. Delicious!

But the star of SkinnyFATS has to be their soda bar. You will NOT find your typical sprite, coca cola, neste raspberry iced tea here. They have a soda bar full of old fashioned root beer, cola, orange soda, ginger beer, etc. My favorite was the cream soda!

My experience of this restaurant was total meh. Party of 3 came in for lunch around 130pm. I had already Yelped it (obviously) and was reallly excited to try it. My gf even drooled on my arm while looking at the pics #truestory. 

We started with the 'hot mess' appetizer which is nachos with buffalo chicken, cheese, jalapeños and sour cream. It came out with the rest of our food. They were not hot, the cheese had kind of hardened from being cold-ish and there was no jalapeño ranch, like it said on the menu. 

I ordered the 'hot chix' salad. I was underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time. I felt like there were too many flavors going on between the buffalo chicken which is actually spicy, the bleu cheese, the fried jalapeños and the buffalo ranch which tastes more like chipotle ranch. I love buffalo chicken and I didn't like this one. 

My friends ordered the 'meltdown' which she said was really greasy and the 'sweet cheese us' which was pretty good and the hoagie roll was soft. 

My salad came out before anything and so we all sat there waiting for the rest of the order. The 3 meals with app and 2 drinks was about 60. I probably wouldn't go back except the guy next to me ordered the chicken and waffles which he said is really good.

Short version:  Overhyped, espensive, not worth it.  

Long version: 

Went on Sunday 10-11-15 around 12:30 PM.  No line at all so we ordered right away at the counter. $26.84 got me a regular size Mr. Green juice, a ""Sweet Cheese Us"" sandwich, and the ""Brussel Crowe"". No high chair was offered for my kiddo so I held him in my lap.  Not sure if they have them or not.  

After trying one of their yummy juices at the last yelp event I figured they were all that tasty so I ordered up a ""Mr. Green"" which is comprised of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine, celery, cucumber & apple.  At $9 it is definitely the most expensive non-alcoholic liquid I've ever had in my mouth. One sip had me re-thinking my decision and contemplating taking it back.  It was watery and terrible. I decided it was probably just my personal tastes and dumped my expensive-ass juice down the drain and refilled it with some Boylan ginger ale.  What a waste. 

The ""Sweet Cheese Us"" was listed on the menu as shaved NY Strip, cherry/banana peppers, caramelized onions, portobello, pepper jack & cheddar sauce on a hoagie w/side.  I chose sweet potato fries as my side.  If this sandwich was on the healthy side I would have been impressed.  It was too big and sloppy to fit in my mouth so I ended up eating it with a fork.  Bland strips of steak and portobello topped with the most bizarre cheese sauce I've ever seen.  Somehow it managed to be grainy and runny at the same time.  While I appreciate the effort to be more natural than the neon yellow stuff from a can, I would definitely pass on this one next time.  Sweet potato fries were really good, though, and that jalapeno ketchup is nothing short of genius.  

The ""Brussel Crowe"" was my most anticipated dish of the day.  I love brussel sprouts!! The menu described it as brussel sprouts w/marinara, basil, provolone & pepperoni.  Like brussel pizza! It would have been awesome if the sprouts weren't completely raw.  Trying to masticate them bad boys was tiring.  I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be or not but I definitely wouldn't order this again.  

If I ever go back I'll definitely get breakfast.  From reading the other reviews they seem to be the tastier items.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,12,9,3,9cU5FdH0op7S3l-0rS-SfQ

Perfect combination. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. The truffle fries were so truffle-lyyy.. I could tear up because I was happy haha. The breaded chicken burger was amazing. I had it with the peppered ketchup they put out on the table along with the chipotle ketchup. What went well with it too was the syrup from the waffles and the gravy. Drool!!

It took me a while to get it, but looks like the general idea of the place is that you have a healthy menu for items easier on your tastebuds and a happy menu for those who want more heartier and savory things (hence the name SkinnyFATS). Very convenient for those who want something a little less taxing on their tastebuds and also want to stay fit!

I was also very impressed by the selection of their menus - I came in, worrying it was solely a burger place, but they also have salads, fresh juices, breakfast items and desserts as well.

We had the Greek flatbread, Banana pancakes and the goat cheese club sandwich. We shared bites, all dishes were wonderful.  :-)

Seating is a little weird. All indoor tables were taken, and I don't care for the communal high table thing, so we had to take a table on the very small and crowded outdoor patio. But it's a gorgeous day so it was perfect. Lots of self-important diners, trying look cool. Fun people watching. Sat next to a really uppity older couple.

The girl behind the counter explained how you can order on the one side which is the healthy side and the other side you live happy! 

I guess we were both in the mood to live happy.

My husband ordered the Waffle and Chicken and I had the Hot Chix Salad, Wow when they were both brought out we could not wait to try!!

My husband really enjoyed his. He had never had Chicken and waffles together so this was a treat for him. He let me try his and I thought the Chicken was so tender and the breading was amazing. I could go just for these!

My salad was really good. It had the buffalo chicken on top of lettuce which was really tender and lightly battered it was slightly crispy along with blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes, Avocado and fried Jalapenos. 

Omg the fried Jalapenos I could make a lunch out of them by them selves!!!
They were lightly battered and crispy and not spicy at all but the flavor was amazing! I am so hooked on them I want more now! :) I can not stress enough how good they were!

It was served with a Jalapeno ranch dressing that had a little kick to it and a perfect touch to the salad. The only complaint I have is I think it needed a tad bit more lettuce under it. There is a lot of toppings but not much lettuce. Otherwise it was very good.

The concept of this place is great. You are sure to find something you want to eat! So many different items on the menu which is cool. 

We both agreed we really enjoyed it and are looking forward to going again sometime.  
We highly recommend this place!! It is VERY good,

We had the coffee which was good a long with flavored creamers.
After our breakfast/lunch we bought one warm chocolate chip cookie which came out warm and the chocolate was soft and the cookie was very good! A great way to end the meal!

We are fans for sure! And will go back. If you have never been here stop and check it out. We left just in time there was a ton of people going in as we left and not a table to be had.

5821466,2015-03-13,4,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"i was a bit confused as to why this place is called ""Skinny Fats"" thinking everything will be healthy much like ""LYFE Kitchen."" I learned from the cashier  that for every food item, they provide the ""skinny"" (healthy) versus ""fat"" (happy) version of the same dish. At least, that's what I think the girl was saying...

Great thing is you can get breakfast all day here and i was craving for some waffles and fried chicken at 10p.m. 

CHICK-A-WAFF-A-DOPOLIS -- 1 star.  Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don't know if they bake it or how they seasoned the breading for the chicken tenders, but I didn't enjoy the flavor one bit. I ate 1 out of 5 chicken strips. The waffle was also an OK. I asked them  if it was some type of ""skinny"" recipe because it lacked in flavor and texture was a bit odd. Apparently, I was eating regular buttermilk waffles. Looking back, it may have been that I didn't get to slab on a ton of butter like the true fattie way of life, and dunk it in some full fat maple syrup. Hey, if I'm going to order off the ""FAT"" side of the menu, I'm gong to go big or go home. 

THE ORIGINAL burger - 4.5 star. 
I don't know if it's cuz I was eating some mediocre chicken strips and waffles immediately prior, this burger made my night. I was confused once again, what was ""healthy"" 'till my brain kicked in and I realized this item was listed under the ""FATS"" (or ""happy?"") section. Hence, it's a NORMAL burger, with bacon, sauce, cheese, and avocado on a brioche bun. 

Truffle fries- 1 star. Is this supposed to be the ""fat"" version, because it sure tasted like a ""skinny,"" i.e. not as good as what fries or better yet, truffle fries normally taste. 

Service- Great cashiers that are super enthusiastic to be working there. 

So...I'm still a bit confused about the SkinnyFATS concept. There's a lot of semantics going on with them interchangeably replacing the words ""skinny"" with ""healthy"" and ""fat"" with ""happy."" So wait, the ""skinny"" stuff makes one healthy, but not happy?  I went through a whirlwind of confused states trying to make sense of what was going on when I was ordering, and it continued to persist as I ate parts of my meal.  

On a brighter note, I guess I can share a meal at the same restaurant with my vegan, vegetarian, ""skinny,"" and ""healthy"" friends while I shamefully order from the ""fat"" menu and stay ""happy."" 

Speaking for myself, I'd go somewhere else to eat a healthy meal, because it's just too dang tempting to see the non-healthy options alongside. And as for eating some fatty, happy, meals, I'd go somewhere else to ""get my fattie on.""",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,3,1,3,Rqmhp4eT1l50R5Z3nN5V6Q

5913714,2016-01-07,2,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"SkinnyFats has been on my bookmarks for months and I finally was able to stop by for lunch. When I arrived at 1130 there were still plenty of seats but the seating area is quite small. I liked how the menu was split healthy and happy, something for everyone. 

The cashier was nice and patient while I looked over the menu. I went with the Deep Veggin and the TATS sandwich with truffle fries. At about $20 with a drink it was quite an expensive lunch. I wish I had seen the complimentary cucumber infused water before I ordered but oh well. 

The food came out all at once. The deep veggin was okay but the sauce was way too spicy for me. There panko breading was very plain. The TATS was pretty good. The bread was toasted nicely and it had lots of spinach and avocado. I didn't taste any of the ""spicy yogurt"" however. The truffle fries lacked any truffle flavor and were quite plain. 

Overall it was okay, but I can spend half as much and driver half as far for a much better lunch.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,6,4,3,rJk4LcynvuWUlHglfLAtmw
5918922,2015-02-08,8,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,"Not a fan of the potential long lines that you may encounter at SkinnyFATS.  But after a trip to their original location and seeing that unappetizing long line and no seats, I decided to check out their second location.  The line was still long, but it was not as bad as the first one, plus the seating capacity is much improved here.

The menu looks identical, so unless I am deathly close to their first location, I will likely never go back there again.  If you can order online, that will probably be very helpful in saving time as well.  Service from the cashier and order taker was good.  The staff that delivered our order was also good.

Once you place and pay for your order, you are given a number, so your order can be brought out to wherever you find available seating, both indoor and out in the patio area. The weather was nice, and the building provided sufficient protection from the sun, so we eventually made our way out to the open table we found.  Eating out in the patio area felt like having a picnic outdoor, complete with the baby or fruit flies that wants to partake in the meal as well.

After looking over the menu, we decided to order the following:

Ahi Srirachi Taco: Seared Ahi, Slaw Chee, Mango, Pico & Spicy Yo-Aioli in a Wheat Soft Taco.  My Fav Asian liked it and that's all I needed to know.  She did add more habanero hot sauce to her tacos for more fiery kick. *Did they misspelled Sriracha on purpose?

Ahi Taco-San: Tempura Ahi, Sriracha Slaw, Mango Pico, Teriyaki, Spicy Aioli in a Puffed Shell.  This one is a winner, but probably not one of their relatively healthier menu items.  It is messy to eat, but I can't complain with the paper napkins within easy reach.  4.5 stars worthy all on its own.

Cherry Popper: 1/2 lb. Beef Patty, Cherry/Banana Peppers, Spicy Slaw, Pepper Jack & Fried Egg on a Hawaiian Roll with a side (Opted for the Truffle Fries).  Not sure why it gets positive reviews.  I thought it was just average or maybe the execution was just off.  Asked for medium rare, was served a burger closer to well done (it was still juicy and not dried).  The Hawaiian Roll did nothing for me in this burger, as it was not toasted and was way too soft and soggy after all the liquid from the slaw got absorbed into the bun.  I will pass on this one and done burger.

The Truffle Fries was okay. At $3.5 per order it is not expensive, but again the execution felt subpar. Half of my fries look and tasted overcooked (the ones on the bottom covered up by fresher, acceptably executed batch of fries), as if it was the last of the leftover fries scooped up from the fryer just before it has no wiggle room left to go except the trash and served all on my plate with the Cherry Popper Burger.  Not even close to McD's fries.

If I was not already in a good mood just spending the day hanging out with my Fav Asian, the rating would not be so generous to even earn the A-OK 3 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,12,9,3,pq7OgtCRnIc6i6cC7183IQ

A short explanation of how their menu had a ""healthy"" and ""happy"" side would have helped since it was our first time there. I honestly thought that this restaurant just served healthier versions of food that are normally high in calories, high in sodium, etc. But she didn't even care to ask. I'm a picky eater, so most of the menu did not sound great to me. However, I still wanted to give it a try, so I ordered the Buff Chix - I mean how can you go wrong with chicken tenders and fries right? 

Wrong! The buffalo sauce was waaaay to salty. After the first chicken tender, I didn't want to eat anymore. The truffle fries were very soggy, tasteless and just drowning in oil. Gross! Their sodas were made with real cane sugar, but both the diet and regular cola tasted weird. I can't remember what my husband ordered, but he agreed that the food was not great. 

The restaurant was clean. If you dine in, you will place your order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table. 

Gave it a shot, but will not be back. I can think of a lot of other places where I can eat healthier food for less money and be satisfied!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,2,2,8RaoMRna4z63Qoy_a1_Vaw

The first night we dined at this location we had the pleasure of sitting next to the parents of the executive chef. We were able to meet the chef and shake his hand to congratulate him. 

Chef Josh Green is by far the sickest chef when it comes to flavor combinations. Everything we have tried has left us looking like Sally from the diner scene in When Harry met Sally. Our favorites are Tu nuts, Happymess, and chix on Broadway. We have full intentions on trying everything  on the menu.",lPdVdn5HQSo1hzgJn7QqKQ,2,1,5,Ho1eq3FuX7KdnIC5BWkxcw

The location is larger than their original location but the seating is still pretty tight. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table when it's ready. I have had the turkey burger on a previous visit and found it to be a little dry and flavorless. Fast forward to this time, I actually really liked it. They seem to be taking constructive criticism and improving which has done a world of wonders.

Service was good and aside from a few hiccups everyone was very nice and helpful. If I return to Skinnyfats, I still I'll stick to this location.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,9,4,j8i7T4zajouj3OCQY01AnQ

Yesterday, I decided to try the Warm Springs location. First, let me start off by saying it was busy. That's always a good sign in my book. I ordered the Cherry Popper burger. It was amazing. It's $12, so a bit pricey for a burger, but that included a side. My boyfriend ordered off the breakfast menu, the Smotherload, I think. That was yummy as well. My little sister got the classic burger. I can't remember if that's what it was called though... but anyways. She ate the entire thing and the fries. So, there's no way she could have gotten something from the kids menu. Haha. Our bill came to about $40 for the three of us. I would complain about the prices if the burgers didn't include fries... but they did. 

My only complaint was the LONG wait to order. Seriously. We were in line forever ! There are 2 registers, but only one person was taking the orders, filling various drink orders, etc. It took absolutely FOREVER to order. I went back up to order a drink later on. There were 2 people in front of me and one at the register. I was in line for an additional 16 minutes. 16 minutes to order a drink ! 

But anyways, besides the busy, rush-hour, my experience was great. Th only reason I'm docking a star is because of the long ordering process. There should have been someone else taking orders. Or at the bare minimum, someone help filling the behind-the-counter drink orders (hot water, coffee, strawberry lemonade, etc).",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,0,0,4,H1upPoem2ZyBGW0f2JHQTg

I had the Smoke in a Bowl (""smokin a bowl""?), which was good and flavorful. My boyfriend had the cranburkey burger and sweet potato fries.

Your mind is telling you to go for the Skinny but at the same time you're tempted to choose Fats. So you stand there ideally looking at the menu hoping to narrow it down to at least two entrees but it's difficult. As you near the cashier, you're really pressured to select the ultimate meal that highlights your night. And that's exactly how I found myself being in love with their chicken waffles. 

Uhm, yes. I've succumbed to the dark side with chicken, waffles, and syrup, synchronized together into one perfect bite. I'm a huge fan and while it's been a while since I've last visited, I am also tempted to purchase a smoothie to go. And pretty much everything they offer. Seriously, just give them all to me. 

The service here is always friendly. I remember going on 4-20 and they were offering cookies. As if you need more reason to like them, right? It just keeps getting better.  

Also, my girlfriend is a big fan of their burgers. She can't get enough of how delicious they are. I often make fun of her because she always says that she'll get a bowl but right when she gets to the counter, she immediately changes her mind as though getting something other than a burger is a sin. But I mean, I can't blame her. They are pretty damn delicious. 

One other thing I like about this place is that they are vegetarian friendly. I love how they have a few meals on the menu so our vegetable-loving friends can also have something here too!
