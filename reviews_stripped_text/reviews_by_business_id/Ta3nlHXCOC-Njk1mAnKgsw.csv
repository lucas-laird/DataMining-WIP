It's a (seems to be a permanently parked) food truck in a church parking lot. Once you know you're looking for a truck, it's easy to find. 

First visit we got the seafood gumbo and a crab pot. They didn't make it to pictures. Lol. My friend is a man from New Orleans and even he was impressed. So much so, that he declared we were going back today.

The food is made to order, so the pots take 25 minutes (ish) to make. But you can order online or via phone and pick it up!

So today I called to place an order and learned that the gumbo had already sold out (horrible news)!! So we ordered the catfish, with BBQ beans and Mac and cheese, and the combo pot (snow crab and shrimp with potatoes, corn, sausage and rice). 

This time I got photos (not great ones), after we started eating. 

My friend had the catfish, and reported that it is nicely breaded strips, Mac & cheese is good (but mine is better ), and the beans were good. 

I had the combo pot, and it was as delicious as the crab pot was the first time. Spice level is on point, rice is perfectly done (and buttered!), and the corn/potatoes/sausage are all cooked in the same spices so they are awesome as well. 

We'll be back again soon, next time hopefully before the gumbo sells out!",mq3bS8CjuuzNzaXUbU7Qnw,0,0,5,oqVY5X7POm_Rkm41w46HJg

I encourage EVERYONE to try it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. There is no other southern food, sea food, or BBQ place that you will find all wrapped in one, for affordable prices, and the BEST Food period hands down!!",mZOec2B7yBGZYQMGLQrENw,0,1,5,KGmuyNo7MusHbHfV92HjGw

3277811,2018-03-29,0,Ta3nlHXCOC-Njk1mAnKgsw,I tried this place for the first time today. The I ordered BBQ ribs with greens and baked beans. The BBQ ribs are great and the greens too but I expected the beans to taste in BBQ baked beans not chili. Kinda disappointed but not bad. They could use a little more help with their service. Too much of a long wait when you order online and give an option to pick up on time. Unorganized on that part,-LExcdL997PFs2vPowLzGw,0,1,3,Buf38A_g7I263nUiaM-Y5w

I'll have to come back to try the BBQ. Being at this spot for two months is good, hope they stay and do well.",wRqOw05E-gDiNYsWkzmDqg,1,1,4,w7fqP2Lm2h2k8XF1c5PVKw
