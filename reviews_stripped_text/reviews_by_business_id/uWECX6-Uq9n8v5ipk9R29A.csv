I ordered the Gumbo, my husband ordered the Catfish and Grits, and our daughter ordered the BBQ Shrimp. When the food finally came out, my Gumbo was warm at best.

Then we had dessert. We shared a Bread Pudding and Bananas Foster dish.  The bread pudding was really just a banana bread (or so it seemed to be, but it wasn't bread pudding) with caramelized sugar spooned on top, then topped with a small scoop of ice cream. No bananas in site. All in all, the food was OK in taste, portion sizes are small for the price, and the service was SLOW!

82582,2015-04-07,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"My rating is not based on their food but on my visit to their establishment a couple of weeks ago. My 3 friends and I, ironically, found Lola's on Yelp. We read the great reviews and decided to have dinner there. We noticed it was stated ""reservations preferred"". Keyword, ""preferred"", not ""required"". Walking up to the entry, we observed at least 3 empty tables on the patio and a couple inside and knew we would be able to have dinner. We walked in just after 6:00pm and were greeted by a gentleman/host at the entry and told him 4 for dinner. He looked at his seating computer and said, ""We're unable to seat you. We have reservations for 7:00pm that will fill all our seating. Let me look again...no, we can't do it. Maybe you guys can fit in at the bar. No, that's full now"".

WOW!!! The 4 of us were flabbergasted! We couldn't believe with an hour before the ""supposed"" reservations, that we couldn't be seated and served. And who's to say that every reservations would have been on time or there could have been a cancellation. Well, we'll never know...about any of the above or the food.

My parents and I decided to drop in for dinner before catching a show at the Smith Center. You'll notice their Louisiana spirit just by taking a glance around! Their dining area is cozy and a little tight so you should call in advance if you have a large group.

The fried catfish po' boy was my catch of the day. When it finally came to the table, I peeked into my sandwich and saw a meager catfish filet that resembled those of my poor college student days. The breading was bland, but the fish was moist. Other than that, they followed through on my request to be easy on the mayo and tartar sauce. Their bread is magical. I don't even know how, but it is.

The service was mediocre. Perhaps it was just a busy night and we were in a hurry, but our food seemed to take forever to get from the kitchen to our table. Not sure if the bread was complimentary or if it was to appease our growing appetites as we waited. On a positive note, our waitress was very accommodating and even put in a rush order for us, which I'm very thankful for.

124305,2013-02-28,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Every now and then I come across a specialty restaurant known for some amazing ethnic food or just something completely odd that also happens to serve the perfect burger. I'm not here to present one today, as Lola's didn't provide me anything worthy. I've really enjoyed all of the dishes I have tried over the past couple years, but never even considered getting a burger there until someone suggested it months ago. And as the rule typically goes for me, if only one person in this city has suggested the burger there, it's probably for a reason.

Lola's is a really tight space in the Holsum Lofts building on Charleston at the 15 next to a now-abandoned antiques store. The restaurant has a bunch of two and four seat tables, 6 seats at the bar plus another little 2 seat high top, and a bunch of seating outside during the warm months. It can get very packed very quickly during lunch and dinner so either get there early or prepare for a bit of a wait if you choose to come during peak times, I think they may also take reservations. The parking lot sucks and also fills up quickly so keep that in mind if you're running late. Their menu features everything you can expect from a restaurant with the title ""A Louisiana Kitchen""; crab cakes, catfish and grits, po'boys, bread pudding, etc. Everything I've had here has always been rich and tasty, so when someone suggested the burger I got a bit excited. How can a place that does nearly everything right screw up a burger?

Lola's burger is a never frozen, lean beef patty with lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard. Knowing what typically gets served here, I was shocked to see a puny burger show up in front of me. The meat had ok flavor, but no char and totally overcooked beyond the medium rare I ordered. The bun was thin, small and way too generic. The tomatoes were not very red and fairly weak, the mayo and mustard were barely present. Overall there was nothing juicy about this as their online menu claims, and I really questioned whether I need to try a burger at every single place in town just in case they have that one secret amazing burger. I'm starting to think the answer is no. Everyone can put a burger on their menu to satisfy that one odd person in the group that doesn't want to eat the amazing Louisiana food that's served there, or the pizza that everyone else is getting, but if it's nothing great then what's the point? There are certainly exceptions to the rule, but I need to start limiting myself to restaurants that I know for sure provide something at least somewhat worthy of reviewing.

The fries on the other hand were actually pretty good. Not sure if they were entirely fresh but cooked really well; skin on with a decent amount of seasoning. There were lots of little crunchy bits, but I wish there was a bit more of the larger pieces as there weren't too many actual fries to chow down on with my burger. My meal came to $12.42 with an iced tea and an extra dollar for my not completely melted swiss cheese, basically far too much for a burger meal of this caliber. I don't think I need to reiterate that you shouldn't come here for the burger; there is plenty of great Louisiana style food here that you can't go wrong with, so just stick with that.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,IvZmHQ3noIrSJKN2TRKiGg

When we heard about this place we had to give it a try. This place is very small (like it would be in NOLA) and the employees are very friendly. As soon as we walked up we were greeted by a very nice hostess. She didn't have a table for us, but offered us but was very attentive while we waited. I took advantage of the opportunity to enjoy an Abita Strawberry while we waited. Once we got our table we ordered the gumbo and the crab dip for appetizers. Both selections were good. I should have asked for some file for my gumbo, but it was good. The crab dip was delicious. Main course I had the jambalaya with shrimp and extra sausage on the waitress's suggestion. Full of that NOLA love I was looking for. We split the bread putting for good measure. It took a while to get a cab from here on a busy day, but no worries we just went ahead and ordered up some more Abitas chatted with the staff and let the good times roll.

We hit the tail end of a weekday lunch rush.  I tried the shrimp and grits...scrum! Really moreishly creamy grits and perfectly grilled shrimp with spicy oily sausagy sauce. Just the right size portions, too. Left room for desserts! Hubby had bread pudding and I had sweet potato & pecan pie with chantilly cream. Both divine, but mine took the cake!! 

Only (very minor) drawback is that I couldn't really take my parents there because they're on low-sodium diets. The food was on the brink of being overly salty (it's not outside the realms of possibility that I am more salt sensitive than the general populace), but the spice balance was otherwise excellent. We will defo go back and are looking forward to trying more of the delectable looking menu choices.

The restaurant is pretty small, which is both good and bad; good, because it's cozy and intimate, bad, because it often takes 30min+ to be seated.  Lola's has taken some creative approaches to finding places to seat more people: in a vacant corridor next to the restaurant, outside in front of other businesses, etc. While I commend the ingenuity, unfortunately the service falters when sitting in these areas.  One last note, given the incredible business that Lola's receives, I expected a sturdier table and perhaps a candle atop for ambiance, it would've been an inexpensive investment in their business.
The po' boy that Guy Fieri ate on DDDs is, indeed, delicious, but at $11.49, I expected a bigger sandwich.  I've tried most of the menu at this point, and in addition to being unreasonably expensive, the flavour has also been lacking.  Not to mention most come with 5 shrimp, literally a cup of rice, and then whatever the accompanying sauce may be.
Here's the biggest secret of Lola's, and the most compelling reason to return: the bananas foster bread pudding! This is simply the most delicious dessert I've ever had! If you come to Lola's, if nothing else, try this dessert! 
If the hostess had been friendlier, and the food either more reasonably priced or portioned better, I would've given Lola's a 4 or 5 star review, but I feel that the restaurant is coasting on the DDDs visit and tourism, rather than perfecting their dishes, and their customer's experience.",gDJAZ9rR8DSAlnEC_Fqgiw,0,0,3,Nxy84A7j8gidP-yBoS9bvQ

The second time I went, it was unfortunately the exact opposite. The order was not put in correctly, came out wrong and the service was not good from the beginning. Their solution was to take the Po Boy I ordered and flip it over onto a new piece of bread to get rid of the mayo. Not cool.

After having visited my hometown in SC, I was craving some southern goodness and after searching on Urbanspoon, we picked Lola's. I didn't realize it had been featured on DD&D until I read the reviews on Yelp. 

Lola's is quaint. The restaurant has about 10-15 tables. It's best to get there before 6 if you want to minimize the wait time. When all my friends arrived we ordered. I ordered the jambalaya. It was really flavorful and tasty. The only problem is that the rice was so over cooked and mushy, it resembled something you would spread between bricks, not put on plate. Again it was very tasty, yet mushy or ""moggy"" in the words of my southern mother. 

A friend ordered the read beans and rice of which I had to sample. I've eaten rice with every kind of bean imaginable so I figured this would be good. I mean how can you go wrong with rice and beans. Well Lola's was utterly FLAVORLESS!!! No taste whatsoever. 

Could I come back? I guess, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice.

Came to the Downtown location for lunch - go early or late because it is small and gets crowded. Ordered the CHICKEN plate, fried, with 2 sides- the grits and red beans & rice.  Uh - so full just thinking bout it but I wanted to try my favorite things. 

The fried CHICKEN was cooked great but the meat itself needed some seasoning. Waitress offered the house hot sauce which I adventurously accepted (I love hot sauce) but this was toooo spicy - even for me. And I didn't love the flavor of it. And it cost an extra .50cents (I'm not cheap it's just the principle, I wouldn't of cared at all if I really liked it ;).

So the RED beans & RICE were yummy! But the Gouda GRITS are ""da bizness"" and I can't wait to have them again! Note: both of these Sides have an ""upcharge"" which is noted on the menu for the grits but the not the RB&R.

We wanted to find a downtown location that could accommodate a large group. After several failed attempts at making reservations at other downtown eateries, my friend called Lola's. We were able to make a reservation for 17 without any trouble. When we arrived, I was surprised to see what a small space it was. Even though it's such a humble space, we didn't feel cramped. Everyone in the group, even the picky eaters, were able to find something on the menu that tickled their fancy. The food all came out at the same time which is something I truly appreciate when dining with a large group. 
On my first visit I tried the gumbo and crab cakes. Not only were they delicious, but the presentation of the crab cakes is adorable with cursive L's drawn in tasty lemon-garlic aioli. Everyone in the group was pleased with their choices. Some people in our group were a little surprised by how spicy their meals were. Word to the wise, if the menu says ""spicy"" don't take it lightly! I had the bread pudding for dessert, and it was tasty too! Everyone agreed that one highlight of the meal was the bread. It is sliced thin and lightly grilled. The bread is pillowy and has just the right amount of crunch. Yum! They also have a nice selection of Abita beer. 
As we left, they wished me a happy birthday, and I promised we would be back soon. I kept true to my word, and we ate dinner there again tonight. We had the hot crab and artichoke dip. It came out piping hot, and did not disappoint. I had the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya. It is a generous portion and very flavorful. Tonight's dessert special was peach cobbler. It was totally perfect.

My crab cake was good BUT, it had huge pieces of crab shell in it and it almost chipped my tooth and I don't mean a little piece of shell because that is understandable but I could tell you exactly where the piece of hard shell came from(claws, legs, and it body..and it wasn't a leg shell). I did takeout and it took an hour just to get my food and I was hoping that well hopefully I will have a great experience with the food...NO NO NO I ordered the blackened catfish Po'Boy as well and my fries were burnt, very flimsy no crispness, and they weren't hot. Oh I did have one crisp fry that wasn't burnt...Like the fries were fried this morning and been sitting there all day and they mixed in a fresh batch just to make it seem like they were just fried or they recooked them. Then my Po'Boy uhhh where do I start!!! The fish was very bland and I don't understand how it can be bland and it's blackened. It definitely needed salt for taste. Waaaay to much mayo and the tartar sauce tasted like unflavored mayo. So in my mouth I just taste a bunch of oily based spread. The bread was stale so when I bit into it..well I tried to. The whole inside slipped out and I was left with still trying to tear a bite off the bread. Overall I give it a BIG ZERO. That's why either Guy Fieri only talked about the Beef Debris Po'Boy because everything else was nasty or they allowed for the recognition to go to their head and now they don't care about the food quality...and I'm guessing the second part is right because I had autographs on both of my takeout containers and I didn't even ask for it.

After the last experience I had there I will not be visiting it again even though it is a few blocks from my home.  

My boyfriend and i arrived and were handed menus by the hostess who said, "" there is only two tables outside I trust you can find it.""  This is not a seat yourself kind of place but we were happy to oblige.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp po-boy and I ordered the beans and rice.  After about 30 min. we were still patiently waiting for our food, after 45 we asked to get it to go because we could no longer wait.  As if by happenstance our food came out within the next min. we were given to-go boxes at the same time that way if we wanted to take a few bites before packing it up we could.  IT WAS COLD!  The sweet potatoes were cold the rice was cold... everything was cold... I did not receive the bread nor the coleslaw it was supposed to come with either.  I went to the hostess to inform her of the situation.  She offered to put it in the microwave for us to heat it up, other than that there was nothing else she could do but get Lola.  However they just had a very large to go order and Lola was working on the line.  ( I am sorry I wish they would have told me in advance that they would not be able to accommodate my order because they had a very large order to take care of.)  

I went back to the table and sat.  Our bill was promptly brought to us and then my boyfriend questioned the quality of the food with the time waited to the waitress.  She offered to get Lola but other than that there was nothing else she could do... we paid and waited some more.  She still did not come.  Finally on our last effort at realizing we just wasted $25 on food that was not fresh we went back to the door and requested Lola; just to be told that Lola was busy and could not come out. I am very disappointed in my experience at this place.  I love to support local businesses especially in the downtown neighborhood, however this place will not be one of them.

It was nice out that day and Lola's had a nice little patio to dine but I wanted to experience the whole Louisiana ambiance so we decided to dine inside. The decor had a new Orleans theme going on but the one thing that caught my eye were the vibrant paintings. You can certainly tell that the owner shows a lot pride and passion form where she is from through the decor.

So let's get to the nitty gritty ""THE FOOD"". I was disappointed at their beer selection. They had the typical Budwiser, millers, etc. But they only had two Abita beer selections and for those beer lovers Abita is brewed in Louisiana. Although they had only two, much props for having the SOS (save our shore) which was brewed as a charitable beer for the most recent oil spill in the gulf. This again reflected the owners passion to her home town. We went there for the crawfish so we ordered the 5 lb special and after seeing it come out it was well worth the 41.99 price. There were only two of us and the 5 lbs would be good for 4 people. It was time to get in ""caveman"" mode, took the first crawfish ripped off the head and sucked it's delicious juices. The seasoning was perfect, there was a little kick to it but not too spicy where it overwhelms your palette. The tail meat was sweet, with the taste of shrimp and the texture of lobster. ""Crawfish the poor mans lobster"". I didn't care much for the claws so I kindly shared them with my friend who had more patience cracking them open. I skipped on the potatoes and corn that came with the boil because I just couldn't stop eating the crawfish.

Overall my first crawfish boil experience was a very good one and plan to come back to try Lola's other dishes. So if your from Louisiana and live in Vegas, I'm sure you'll feel a little closer to home when you eat at Lola's.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,1,0,4,kAi0ewsoyISRH5yp_kYSag

The meal arrived and looked great.  Five large shrimp, U-20's I think, on top a bed of rice, soaked with the spicy Cajun style sauce that the shrimp were slow cooked in.  Cayenne pepper was on the rim of the plate that immediately cleared my sinuses. 

I ate with delight, took some bread from my girlfriend's catfish po-boy (which was also delicious) and mopped up the sauce.  The meal was delicious and not overwhelmingly filling.

Thank goodness they had some chairs outside in the shade.  So we chose to sit and wait till opening.  One of the managers was kind enough to bring us some ice water and around 11:45a, allowed us to come inside until they were ready to start service.

My mom and I were driving along Charleston Blvd when we came across this place. This was my first attempt at Cajun Food - let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS! 

I had the Blackened Catfish with Grits. Never had Catfish nor Grits before, so needless to say, I was super apprehensive. Coming from Hawaii where Spam is King, Catfish and Grits are not exactly on the menu everyday.  But, I was assured by the super nice Waiter that it's Lola's special and that I would not be disappointed. 

When the dish came out, it was more than I could have expected! The cajun spices were amazing - it has a spicy bite, but not to the point where you are dying for water. It's the perfect combination to the flaky soft fish. Combined with the grits and mushroom sauce...omg...it's a party in your mouth. 

Fast forward to dessert, my mom has a sweet tooth so she had to have something. But, she couldn't decide between the Bread Pudding and the Banana Fosters. Lo and behold, Lola herself comes out and suggests the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding. Apparently, a lot of other people were in the same predicament and so Lola combined the two desserts into one. 

If you go here, you must try the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding. Words will not do it justice, so I will not even try to attempt to express how amazing this dessert it. Go there. Try it. I promise - you will not be disappointed. 

Lola is the nicest lady ever - she came out from the Kitchen and greeted every single table. When she stopped by our table, she greeted us like family and immediately made us feel like we've known her for years!

Anyhow, we've been there twice.  The first time we went on a Sunday night and it was really quiet as it was just before closing time.  Our server advised that we come in on a Friday night to have crawfish.  My boyfriend is from a small town in Louisiana and LOVES crawfish.  So, we ended up coming back to eat on First Friday. 

The atmosphere was great.  There was a great band playing and it was very laid back.  We did have to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes for a table, because it was at the peak of dinner time.  Plus, this isn't the type of place where you eat and leave right away.  It's nice to sit back, have a beer, and just talk.  

The food is delicious.  We ordered about five pounds of crawfish, the crab dip, and for dessert, we had bananas foster and bread pudding.  The dessert was wonderful.  I'd go just for dessert!  

I think they could definitely work on being a bit more organized when it comes to seating.  My boyfriend gets cranky when he is hungry and made a comment that there were two tables that had been empty for about five to ten minutes that just needed to be bussed.  I was enjoying the weather and the band - as they have an outdoor patio.  Plus, I always think to have a small snack before we go anywhere new - just so that I'm not starving if we have to wait to be seated.  

I personally love the atmosphere.  I adore downtown Las Vegas - as it is the closest thing that we have to history and art in this town.  I know that we have the fine art galleries on the strip - but I love being able to experience a city and its people doing normal things like gathering for dinner.

Sorry Tierney and anyone else who says they had a bad experience at Lola's - with respect, I disagree.  I'll go to Lola's over any of the overpriced celebrity-joints on the Strip anytime.",N996K0H4Tjx_A7OceFHOPA,1,0,5,JNB1kjGw3hYSYRcBdbnWgw

Having been to New Orleans this place is as close to being there as you can get. When you first walk in you can tell its a New Orleans place with all of the saint pictures every where. I had the crawfish corn balls which were excellent. Next I had the fried shrimp po-boy which the bread is from the famous bakery from New Orleans which is a must have. Last but not least I had the pecan sweet potato pie which I really enjoyed. If you love Cajun food like I do give this place a try.,EnkN58MPWLAydD1Q8d1LZQ,0,0,4,ztOg5nPuIO8tcJJl81L40g

Good thing too because when my party and I arrived,  it was packed but we were seated right away. Had we not made one, there would've been a wait. The place is very quaint but there's outside patio seating which is nice.

Our server was a gem. She was so sweet. Unfortunately,  I don't remember her name. However, if I could describe her,  she was about 5' 4"", blonde hair shoulder length, but parted and w/ one braid on each side. (Eek...hope that helps)

Being that the first leg of my vacation recently was in NOLA, I wanted to try something new. So I ordered the Catfish (nuggets) & grits made w/ actual gouda cheese. I'm not really a fan of Gouda but the smokey flavor of the grits was pretty good. And the catfish was amazing! 

My son ordered Gumbo but kept eating my food!! (The nerve). He started w/ the crab cake for starters which he loved!

So eventually since most of my food had been eaten, I was forced to eat his Gumbo. (Really tasty..btw). Portion size with each meal was perfect. 

And on to dessert....do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pecan pie!! I died and went to heaven for about two whole minutes. Jesus wouldn't let me stay,  He told me we should order another one, so I had to oblige!! 

Since my party and I DEVOURED the first one, we ordered a second one, even after the bill had arrived! 
The crust just melted in your mouth.. and the combination of warm sweet potato with pecans...just sinful! Woohhh!!

Lastly..The atmosphere, with the combination of the decor, the music and the pleasant staff really took me back to NOLA. The only thing missing was that NOLA accent which I love! Ahh well... can't have everything right?

We sampled each other's order and agreed the etouffee was the best overall.  The shrimp was also superb.  Least favorite, but still good were the crab cakes.

1) Crawfish hushpuppies and they melted in our mouths like butter and were perfect. The bread they serve is flown in directly from Louisiana and it is the most sumptuous, airy, perfectly toasted, and perfecty buttered bread I've ever had in my life. 

2) Catfish and grits. This is their speciality and the server was so excited about this dish that we could not pass it up. Amazing does not even begin to describe the perfect blend of spices and textures of the catfish and the grits. The bread they provided you was also a necessity to sop up all of the delicious sauce that came with this dish!

3) Banana's foster. It doesn't look like it's on their menu anymore, but I wanted to eat at least a pound of it. It was heavenly and yes, the best Banana's foster I ever had. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal.

I arrived at 7 on a Friday night after an aborted trip to El Sombrero (too crowded).  Fortunately, I arrived about 15-20 minutes before Lola's got slammed, so my appetizer and entree arrived promptly.

I ordered the crawpuppies and an Abita beer to start.  The crawpuppies were unusual, but very tasty.  Wish I could say the same about the Abita - marginal at best.  Oh well.

I reluctantly ordered the bronzed catfish and grits, only because they are the house specialty.  I'm not a grits fan, but the waitress convinced me I'd like the grits.  And she was right.  The grits were cooked with gouda cheese and were very tasty.  The catfish was cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sauce was wonderful.  Very complex taste, no wonder it's the house specialty.

As I mentioned earlier, they pretty much got slammed while I was at Lola's.  From my vantage point, it didn't seem like they handled it all that well.  So you may want to hit Lola's outside of prime dining hours.

The big problem was that everything I had, except for dessert, was bland. Why would a Cajun restaurant be hesitant to season its food? I got the red beans and rice. It tasted fresh, but it was a bit too thick and had too much of a tomato flavor. What happened to the meat broth taste? They put one small slice of sausage on top of the rice and I think I detected a few tiny pieces of meat in it. The coleslaw that came with the beans was also bland although it had good ingredients in it. The crab cake also was not seasoned well and more on the soft side. I like some crisp to my crab cakes. 

Another thing that bothered me was the place was too small, so it felt as if the staff was right next to you while you were eating. They were constantly walking up and down, sometimes colliding with each other, right next to you. Usually in restaurants this is not so noticeable. I felt as if I had no privacy to eat my food since they seemed to always be walking right next to me and sometimes glancing at my table. They need to improve this because it's hard to fully relax and enjoy a meal there.

On a positive note, the service was good. My waitress was friendly and attentive. Lastly, the bread pudding, which I came there for, was delicious. It was my first time to have bread pudding so it was a great way to be introduced to it.

this is the 3rd restaurant at this spot ( i ate at one of the others - the name escapes me ) in the last two years or so. 

decent job in remodeling the place - simple, yet comfortable. 

sis had cup of gumbo, crab cake dinner; gf had bronze catfish with grits; i tried the gumbo and jambalaya. 

they provide a sorry ass basket of stale bread ( maybe it's meant to soak in the gumbo - who knows ? ) 

gumbo ( $4.25 ) - cup - alot of shredded chicken, small shrimp , some andouille sausage bits a lil bit of okra - decent taste. personally, i prefer a darker roux /base - provides a little nuttier, richer taste but still, not bad. 

the crab cake dinner - 2 nice sized crab cakes on a bed of greens - nice portion of crab in the cake - good flavor. the greens ok to but it had the look of an appetizer - asked the server if it's the appetizer , "" no the appetizer is one crab cake ) - $15 - a little pricey - but still good. 

the jambalaya ( $10 ) - very good, spiced just right, good mix of sausage and chicken ( did not go with the shrimp option - $13 ) - the andouille sausage slices on top tasted like smoked polish sausage , possibly farmer john brand - ok by me. 

the winner was the catfish / grits. the description mentioned a mushroom ragu - but it should be mushroom surprise as in try and find the mushroom ! still, great cheesy grits, tender flaky catfish browned, not blackened. sorry, i forget the price but pretty sure under $15. 

we shared the bananas foster - very good - wanted to try the bread pudding but i ain't up for the raisins ! 

overall, service pleasant. Had a nice chat with the manager ( or was it the owner ) - giving my 2 cents and more importantly, well wishes that they succeed -

It has been about a month since my last visit. The food here is really good except this time I did not wait around. After sitting at the bar area where there were only 2 people  and only one eating I saw that one of the employees was watching TV. I sat there for approximately 7 to 10 minutes with no one coming over with a menu or asking if I wanted a drink. I left and went somewhere else. Hopefully management will read this. It might explain why there were only 2 people in the place.,J75hetoklH9MoQWIa74pAg,0,0,2,n-KB7jFTN__UI-zGmONIUA
1222341,2018-03-24,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I've never had authentic Cajun/Creole food and have always wanted to try.. this place really set a high standard for me! It's a cozy little spot just off the I-15 neighboring the North Premium Outlets. It's a small place, so claustrophobic people beware! But the food definitely makes up for the lack of space.

Appetizers:

Crab Cakes (5/5): Very moist and perfect consistency. A little crunch on the outside from the pan fry, but not dry at all. The lemon and garlic aioli was thick and perfect not to overpower the taste of the crab cake.

CrawPuppies (5/5): GAME CHANGER! Not usually one to reach for hush puppies or crawfish, but wow.. they were very flavorful! The true test was splitting it in half and seeing the steam rise from the inside.. lets just say it passed with flying colors! Served with Cajun aioli that gives it that little kick of heat.

Hot Wings & Fries (4/5): Nothing too out of the ordinary. Love the French fries, you can definitely tell they're fresh in house.. not the frozen bagged crap. 

Side Caesar Salad (4/5): Gave an extra point because of the portion size. For a ""side"" salad it's HUGE! Flavors were the usual, nothing that knocked my socks off.

Gumbo (5/5) : Super hearty and filling! Packed with flavor and just the right amount of heat. Rice was also cooked to a good consistency where it's not mushy like jasmine or too hard that you got to chomp chomp. Good for those who do not like a lot of heat in their food.

Jambalaya (5/5):  Spicy and delicious. Generous amount of protein to rice, they did NOT skimp out. If you're sensitive to spicy foods, it might not be the dish for you. Otherwise, the plate was completely empty.

Shrimp Creole (5/5): VERY GENEROUS portion of shrimp. Loved the tomato based sauce and just the right amount of spice. You will LOVE this dish if you are in the mood for something spicy, but not over the top

Fried Catfish Platter (5/5): Heaping amount of catfish. I want to say 2 decent sized fillets! The remoulade was light and tangy enough that it didn't over power the fish, not like it needed more flavor anyways. Breading was crispy and perfectly seasoned. Came with house fries, which were also good. Trust.. this is better than other catfish platters, must better portion.

The food was BOMB. The service was great! Also looking that the menu, they have a little something for everyone. Don't be afraid to try it out!",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,5,jOq_Dj5ZpK4D2rI7Dmjaeg

Overall, a fine meal with a couple of small hiccups. The waitress did her part, keeping a close eye on the table before my wife arrives, bringing drinks, offering appetizers, the whole nine. We sat outside and enjoyed the rare perfect Vegas weather, one of two tables out there for a late lunch. That's only important because I think the kitchen took way too long under the circumstances.

We both ordered po' boys - me the roast beef debris ($9) and she the blackened catfish ($11.) For a couple of simple sandwiches, the kitchen was really slow. I felt bad for the waitress, who kept looking at us and going back to the kitchen over and over. It was at least 20 minutes with only one other table ordering in front of us.

The bread was the star of mine, fresh and with a good spread on it that added a lot of flavor. The beef was fine - nothing special, a touch dry but still enjoyable. I'd thought about getting the fried oyster po' boy and I think I'd go that way next time. The catfish was spot on, blackened with a little spice, no fishy taste at all. My sweet potato fries were solid, her regular fries were excellent, clearly fresh cut and not too greasy.

Check came to $24 with tip, which I think is a little pricey for a couple of sandwiches. That's the half-star I yanked from what would have been four stars otherwise. On the whole, good enough to get me back in for a second try.",GuhSD-jy--l7yG2HvFR8TA,1,1,4,dGgo89k_cWXd_EzA4SCNqw

My visit here was back in November 2015 around Thanksgiving. My family and I were looking to try something new. 

When my Mom chose this place it looked quite sketchy to me because of the dark windows and small location. But as soon as I walked in you felt the Louisiana vibes. 

The staff was very welcoming and extra accommodating to our needs. 

The food was AMAZING!!! We started ourselves off with Cajun hot wings and fries along with some gumbo. 

My mom had: Bronzed Catfish and Grits
I was able to have a taste of it and let me tell you..... I hate grits but this was delicious! The grits and the catfish complemented each other well.

My dad had: Fries Chicken Salad

My Fiancé had: Blackened Salmon

I had the fried Chicken Breast and my goodness it is by far the best Fried Chicken I ever had. No grease! Thick, crispy, and crunchy skin! And the meat was so juicy and flavorful. 

We finished everything off with their Banana Foster and that too was delicious

I would definitely return on my next visit especially at the fact that we had wonderful customer service. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of our server but she was so sweet. All that I could remember was that she was young, Caucasian and pretty.",dYuPm-lb7HzvGKSK3qKKag,5,4,5,OqqVY1h-3eZ--5uT64xBBA

My husband and I walked in and it was completely empty besides a could of people eating outside. We were seated and the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. However, a worker walked up to her and told her here was an issue he needed to show her. She just walked away. Didn't say I will be right back or got our drinks first, nothing. 

The place started to fill up and other people started to get serviced by other waitresses before us. We were annoyed. So, the waitress servicing the other tables asked us for our drink and apologized for the other waitress. The first waitress comes back. She never gave us her name and just re asked for our drinks. 

We ordered our food We both got po boys. I asked for sweet potato fries but got regular fries. The second waitress which actually did her job well brought out our food. The first waitress that was waiting our table just asked if we needed anything and never came back. We never got a refill we never were asked if things were good or not. 

The food was decent not the best but I wouldn't return because of the horrible service. I tip well but for that kind of service you can have a penny. She sucked at her job and I wish the second waitress had been our waitress.

Friends had recommended that we make a reservation, and we're glad we did. We asked for a table along the wall, which we got. Otherwise, we might have been stuck in the middle, which is a long row of closely placed single tables that almost looks like community seating. We've heard Lola's was super loud, but it was fine for us --  maybe because it was Thursday night, or maybe we just got lucky.

We started off splitting a crab cake and six char-broiled oysters. These were both so good that I wish we would have doubled the order. For his entree, my husband ordered the Shrimp Charlotte, which was marked on the menu as one of ""Lola's favorites."" Although the shrimp was fine, my husband wasn't too impressed with the angel hair pasta. I was really pleased with my entree, the bronzed catfish and grits. The fish was served in small pieces atop cheesy gouda grits and bits of andouille sausage. This dish was spicy but delicious, and I would definitely order it again! 

Since it was a special occasion, we ordered the bananas foster bread pudding to split, and although I am not a picky eater, I actually sent it back. From the menu description, I was expecting bread pudding with sliced bananas on top, but the bananas were mixed into the bread pudding and were pretty indiscernible. The waitress graciously swapped this out with the traditional bread pudding, which was much better. But I think they missed the boat on my original order. Maybe next time I'll order the bananas foster and pour them over the bread pudding myself! (Or maybe they should add this to the menu as an option. I bet it would be a hit.)

A good selection of Abita beers and great service made up for the small shortcomings on the menu, and we'll definitely be back so my husband can try another entree selection. I think I'll stick with the bronzed catfish and grits.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,ecwQhHuMJmgfXAtE9IGpLg

Third-if you have been To Louisiana and have had traditional regional cuisine than take this place as a solid attempt.

The food- we started with red beans and rice, it was very, very bland.  We had to add a pot of salt and hot sauce to even mimic any sort of flavor.

My wife ordered the fried shrimp PO Boy, the batter on the shrimp was ironically so salty neither of us could eat it.

I ordered the shrimp and grits, it was amazing, grits were perfect, tons of flavor in the shrimp, and sauce that came on the edge was amazing.  We both agreed it was definitely worth coming there for the shrimp and grits.

The indoor and outdoor seating areas are both very small. The staff was not rude but not overly friendly either. My husband pointed out that it was almost closing time and they were probably tired but honestly they could be a lot more friendly and welcoming. Both of us love Cajun food so were excited to try the dishes. My husband had the gumbo and liked it. It was well spiced, traditional and served with rice. I had the shrimp and grits. You get five large shrimp, cooked well on a bed of grits with a sauce of sausage and mushrooms.  The gouda grits had great flavor but I was not a fan of the texture. I'm from the south and this is my favorite dish. These grits had the consistency of mashed potatoes and were almost gummy. Again, the flavor was very good I just did not like the thick heaviness of the grits. The grilled garlic bread was also just ok. Very little flavor and inconsistent preparation, some was barely warmed, others had char marks. Our waiter was generally attentive but again not very friendly. He also didn't recommend or offer suggestions for anything. The price wasn't bad but honestly have had similar quality for half the price.

 I've had for so long skipped this place for being located in a not so attractive industrial area of Las Vegas not knowing what I was missing. But after picking up a friend from UMC after all his cancer tests came back negative we decided to go and celebrate, after a quick search on yelp we ended up at Lola's.
 Of green color walls decorated with Mardi gras and the saints memorabilia, a little bar and only a handful of tables the small dining room makes you feel like you had actually traveled to a different state. the Jazz music on the background and the smell of Cajun dishes from other patrons around you only confirms it. At Lola's not only they bring you the food they serve in Luisiana, they also take you there. But if leaving vegas is not your thing, they also have some patio seating with a view of down town and the Las Vegas premium outlet mall. Either way you can't go wrong, you'll be enjoying some of the best comfort dishes this side of the strip.
Service was decent, not stellar but only what was required, our waitress was busy so we didn't expected too much, got our food and beers and we were happy.
We started with the crab cakes and they were not the best, sad to inform, they were a little too mushy and not crab flaky but passable and tasty non the less. Vindication came when my bronzed shrimp & grits and the shrimp Charlotte arrived and we realized we had made the right choice. We ordered those because they were two of the most popular dishes at Lola's but I can't wait to try other items that also sounded delicious, and if the crab cakes are worst thing they offer and the shrimp & grits the best, anything in the middle is going to be fabuloso.

I've been 5 times now all during different Vegas trips and each time get to bring someone new to share the experience and flavors.

My favorite is the jambalaya w/shrimp of course. That shrimp is freakin amazing. The overall flavor is spot on with the rest of the spices and ingredients. I've also had the gumbo and shrimp n grits. All are amazing, no lie. 

Another plus is the amazing service we've recieved each time we've gone. Amazingly helpful and honest, thanks for that.

The lot around back is large but would be a little daunting at night. The remains of buildings of years gone by make it a rough road to traverse. We went during daylight hours. There is also a parking lot on the east side of the building. Good luck finding it on your first visit. 

Walking across the back lot and into the building is a challange the first time as there are no signs to guide you. But...we found it...right through the back door along a hall and into Lola's beverage service area. We heard the crowd and zidego (sp) music knowing this was the place.  

The lunch crowd was large and loud....a lot of fun and Lola was wandering around the dining room making sure that patrons were being taken care of and assisting the waite staff when needed. Appeared to be a very hands on owner. 

The food was amazing. My wife and I had Po'Boys. She had the oyster 'loaf' and I tried the Roast Beef Debris. Both sandwiches were very good, hot and fresh. The oysters were huge and mine was like having a pot roast on a roll. The sides were french fries (could've had a little more crunch) and cole slaw which was nice and fresh. We observed other dishes being served. It's not hard to gawk is a small room. The shrimp Etoufee' looked very good as did the catfish plate, gumbo and crawpuppies. 

To finish up our experience our waitress recommended the 'Lola's Famous Bread Pudding'. OMG is all I can say. It was warm and covered with  Jim Beam praline sauce and toppped with whipped cream. Yum.

We will definitly go back and the next time we'll know where the back door is and not get sorta lost. The front of the place faces east Charleston and looks nice when you drive by ON Charleston. But you can't get there from there. Use Mapquest.",tIjhXTwrkDJCo070eUIuhA,2,0,5,l2mzp7HTsSMLh5NVp9Ma6A

Friendly staff!  Food was delicious!!  Price could have been a little bit better!

Between my wife, daughter, & I, the bill ended up being approximately $50 (inclusive of tip) for a late afternoon lunch.  I had the po' boy oysters w/sweet potato fries.  The wife ordered the oyster platter and small cup of gumbo, while my teen daughter settled for the chicken strips w/fries.  The oysters dishes were great and they are a must order, in my opinion.  The sides were all prepared well and complimented the meals perfectly.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price.  I think everything we ordered was worth the price tag except for the gumbo and chicken strips.  $5 for a small cup of gumbo and $10 for some chicken strips was, in my opinion again, a bit too much.

1. this place only has a beer and wine bar. There's something wrong when I can't get a hurricane with my crab cakes!
2. it closes at 10pm in a city that never sleeps. 
3. Food was nothing to rave about.
4. For sure, pass on hot wings

In fairness, I want to expand on 3. We had the crab cakes, hot wings, jambalaya, catfish Po Boy, and red beans and rice. Everything was very fresh, so that's a plus. There was a hint of what I remember to be Cajun food but overall, it tasted like something i would expect at a chain restaurant.

The po-boy and gumbo were excellent.  The gumbo was the best thing I had here.  The ettouffe was not really very good at all.  It had the texture of lumpy gravy, which is not normal for ettouffe.

I was in town for work, so I didn't have to pay for it myself, but if I had I would have been upset that it is kind of pricy and they charge you for every little extra.  For example, I got charged a few dollars for an extra cup of rice for my ettouffe when all it came with a little bit.

I would go back to Lola's, but it's not a priority for me in Las Vegas.  I have been back to town and not stopped by, trying other local restaurants instead.

They were merely cold, sliced bananas dumped on a plate with old, cold sauce of some sort...Not even an attempt at the real deal.

Had the gumbo appetizer which was great and had some good kick to it. For dessert had the bananas Foster bread pudding unbelievably awesome. Great service with our large group of 12 people. Only downside was the venue is very loud as it constantly packed with people.

Our waitress Megan was very attentive and even went as far as bringing a sample of the creole sauce out to taste it to see if I'd like it. I didn't request that, I simply had some questions about the sauce while ordering and she took the initiative in bringing a sample out to be sure I'd like it. She was great!

The food came out and we ordered a deep fried soft shell crab which was good to share. We also shared a bowl of gumbo which was very delicious.  Our entres were both very good (Shrimp creole & Shrimp n Grits). Finally desert came (bananas foster) which was just OK. Def not the best I've had - plain Jane desert, wish we would have ordered the seasonal Apple bread pudding instead. 

One of the girls clearing our plates was on the phone talking which was a little rude and we sat near the kitchen wall and every few minutes someone was poking there head out and we were the only ones in sight of them so that was starting to get old - them popping their heads out and locking eyes every time.

I have to say, Lola's trumped several of the popular restaurants in NO.  Lola's has been on my food list for a couple years and last week, we made it.  On Fat Tuesday.  I didn't realize it was Fat Tuesday until I stepped onto the casino floor and saw all the festivities.  

Lola's is small, but I like the genuine southern-look.  Lola, herself, was passing out beads and welcoming people in.  Obviously she has a local following because she knew most of the room by name.  Later, we see her in the kitchen working as if she was a line cook.  I love that about owners.  You get right in there with your staff and get those dishes out.  Not like the ""celeb"" chefs who only lend their name to a restaurant and you get dishes that taste like crap, but you've paid for the name on the door.

We ordered:
Crawpuppies with Spicy Aioli-type sauce:  These are hushpuppies with crawfish ground into the mix.  A delight!
Fried catfish with sweet potato fries and slaw.  The fish was golden and fried to perfection.
Fried oysters with rice and greens:  I am leery when ordering greens as everyone does them differently.  Lola's greens were collards and they were done wonderfully with bits of hamhock or bacon.  With a dash of tabasco, I was hooked.  The oysters were so succulent, not over-fried.  Thanks Lola!

The options for me were obviously limited. I went with veggies over angel hair pasta, cooked with some Cajun spices. It was delicious, although I wasn't raving nearly as loud as the others at my table, who were eating some sort of shrimp over cheese grits... they loved it and talked about it all night. The other vegetarian offering was fettuccine alfredo, which you can never go wrong with. 

We shared a few bottles of wine and the others passed around the oysters as an appetizer, which I hear was very well done. The place has got a nice New Orleans atmosphere (especially if you are a Saints fan) in a smaller restaurant that would be perfect for dinner for two.

I'm just disappointed that I had to wait 20 minutes to be greeted by our server without the thrill of a lap dance.

We were so thrilled when our server finally arrived, that we gave him our drink, appetizer, and entree selection. I'm not sure if you've heard, but this is how service at a restaurant normally works: You arrive, you're greeted by the host/hostess then seated at the proper table that will accommodate your party size comfortably. Next, the server or server assistant greets you within 5 minutes to take your drink order and offer some appetizer suggestions. Once the drinks arrive they take the order for both your appetizer and your entree or just your appetizer and give you some more time to look over the menu while they put your appetizer in...should I say more? Guess what happened after he took all three orders? Another 20 minutes of staring at each other and our appetizers arrived. They took so long to get to us, I forgot what we ordered! Apparently, we ordered the Craw Puppies. They were good, an innovative dish with an original sauce to match.

Unfortunately, the appetizer was a tease for the beast (my stomach). Guess what came after the appetizer? Another wait...by this time, I was trying to think happy thoughts and sing some lullabies to keep the beast distracted. My date asked if we could have some bread (since all the other tables around us had some) while we were waiting. He also asked the server if he could check on the status of our food. My date decided to take a smoke break while I started to die in slow motion and feel my stomach feed off itself.

Finally, our food arrives. I had ordered the catfish platter which came with two sides. I chose greens and sweet potato fries. The starvation I was experiencing made me so delusional that I actually thought the word ""platter"" meant more than one piece of fish. Nope...just one. As long as the food took, I was hoping that the cook had gone to the lake and caught a  school  of fish for me to eat. Can you believe that after all that my greens were gross & cold?! AND my sweet potato fries were lukewarm. Unfortunately, I had to work the next day...so I couldn't send them back. I did ENJOY my  catfish, however, as long as it took to make...I was expecting it to be ORGASMIC. I did want to try dessert, but like I said before...I had to work the next evening.

It had a very cozy ambience with friendly service.  Oh and how cute!  Lola actually picked up the phone to take my reservation!  

Here's the spotlight on the food =)
1.  Charbroiled Oysters - ""Fresh Oysters charbroiled the Cresent City way, with lots of garlic, lemon and a blend of cheeses.""  Usually I shy away from any cooked type of half shell oysters suspicious that it is the stuff that they're trying to hide the unfreshness of with cooking it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with my favorite robust flavors of garlic and cheese and the lovely toasted slices of french bread
2.  Crab Cakes - ""Lump Crab in Lola's special blend of spices, pan fried and served w/Lemon-garlic Aioli.""  This is not the usual crab cake you'd expect.  It seems to be 99% crab meat.  Not crispy but very crab meaty.
3. Fried Oyster Po Boy on New Orlean's French Bread fully dressed, meaning that it comes with all the slaw glory.  I love po boys!  I enjoyed the deep fried goodness of the oyster with the slaw a bam of hot sauce.  bam bam!
4.  Jambalaya with chicken, sausage and shrimp - fluffy flavorful rice 
5.  Etouffee - a cross between a roast and a gumbo.  Gravylicious

Dessert!
1.  Louisiana chocolate sheath cake - the cake was very light but every bite was a chocolate dream.  We made it a la mode with praline icecream and it was perfect!
2.  Bananas Foster - loved the flavor, but hated the mushiness.  I've had others where it was not so mushy.

Conclusion:  All the flavors were excellent.  One southern style food restaurant under my belt.  Woot.

Recommend:
CRAWFISH by the pound- didn't specify any flavoring because it is perfect as-is. Good portion size, variety of sized 'fish (some bigger, some smaller), hot and fresh.
CRABCAKE- delicious on top of a frisee salad and with an L-shaped drizzle of lemon-mustard mayo sauce that perfectly complements the flavors, nicely crisped. 

As for entrees, I was less impressed. Quality and freshness are still there, but this part of the menu is overpriced for the small portions.
SHRIMP & GRITS- $17, too much gravy and too little grits left me with a puddle at the bottom of my dish. Five flavorful, blackened shrimp were plenty, but grits were a smear in the middle of the bowl instead of the star. And they were gluey.
JAMBALAYA- $11, served in a tureen you might find a side of asparagus in. Packed with flavor, added ""extra"" shrimp for $4.20 and got a total of 4, not sure how many come with the dish regularly or if ""extra"" is meant to mean ""add some to it in the first place.""

Décor is on point and in keeping with true Louisiana style, but Ambiance of the restaurant was more like a slightly-rowdy bar, due in large part to the riotous group seated beside us, screaming with laughter. Good times a-rollin' here.

The site was so cute & decorated with New Orleans fare throughout.  Tables were secure and it was clean.  There is also a grill in the front.  It is small but intimate. Servers were very nice.  Hence one star.

If you enjoy cayenne pepper & a runny nose, this is your spot.  I am from New Orleans, born & raised & I was insulted.  This food had absolutely no flavor.  Not only did it not have flavor the gumbo was uneditable it had so much cayenne.  It tasted as if the only spice was cayenne and no base in any smoked meat or flavor enhancers like bay leaf, smoked necks as the base, and garlic powder, onion powder, granulated garlic or anything.  Nothing I had was from home.  I also had the crawfish.  Sadly cayenne was the star.  The potatoes that they added to the boil were not boiled with any kind of salt. Ever had a boiled or baked potatoe without salt?  Horrible.

My table mate had the crawfish étouffée.  Cayenne abounded and no flavor.  She said the rice was fluffy.  Another table mate had the green beans & I'd ordered the greens.  Greens lacked anything & tasted like they came from a can.  Bacon pieces were obvious.  The green beans had a good crunch & a little flavor.  We also ordered the grilled oysters for our table.  They were seasoned with Italian dressing.  Different and average.

Of the Po'Boys, the Shrimp was my favorite...so far =) and Jambalaya had the perfect kick to it.

The girlfriend had the crabcake dinner which was just ok.  It's not one of their stronger menu items. Location is great and would recommend a reservation on a weekend evening.
My only criticism is the servers were subpar to what you'd expect at a 24 hr cafe. The venue is a little spendy, so I expect some fundamentals of service from a wait staff. It's not worth getting into and doesn't reflect the quality of the food, but definitely was reflected in their tip.",ixg9slI38gXsxT3CCfhU_A,0,0,3,a_oyvx1xGA6ksLp-nWc_MQ

My expectations were way to high for this place. 

The service was terrible. It took our waiter 10 minutes to get our water. We didn't get our bread and crab cake another 20 minutes. We didn't get our entree food until about 1 hour after ordering. Other people got their food way faster than we got our food and we were there before them. We were really ready to walk out on this place. If it weren't for my partner suggesting to stay I would've walked out. 

The food was mediocre. The Shrimp and Grits was ""okay."" nothing I would eat again. The grits were very gummy and gritty. The Shrimp was good and very well seasoned.  Pauls Jambalaya tasted good. Nothing we'd order again. I don't think we'll be coming here anytime soon.

This place brings up all sorts of wonderful imagery - everything about New Orleans life is rich and full of flavor and this restaurant plays into that.

It's located downtown - right near Charleston and Main St.  This is perfect for First Friday art scene goers, and it usually serves as my go-to spot for pre-festivty dinner.  This last Friday I ordered the Gumbo and the Shrimp and Grits.  I can say that the Gumbo was fairly average.  

But I can't take that away from the restaurants score because the Shrimp and Grits absolutely beat everything I'd had in the last month.  They were buttery.  They were cheesey.  They melted and they spiced.  And it was the sort of food that makes you take a double because it was just that beautiful.  A dish of dishes - I will order this every time and be thankful.

My niece also ordered the Fried Chicken and couldn't finish it because of the large portions (which meant it was mine for the taking!).  It was clean chicken breast fried up to brilliance, and I was very satisfied with it.  Everyone at the table gave the dishes a try, almost family style, and we all left happy and full.

I remembered how crowded it gets so I was happy to see that it takes reservations, especially since this was in the middle of my work day. It was crowded when we walked in- and we were  instantly welcomed by the workers and shown our high top table that was reserved. Both my friend and I got the chicken salad- I got it grilled and she got it fried and both of us made it spicy with a 7/10 on the spice scale. Food was delicious, service was just the right pace- and we both like spicy a lot and found their flavor to be delicious. Next time I think I'll get an extra side of the spicy sauce to add into my salad along with the chicken being tossed in it. It was an extremely tight fit though- we were tucked into a corner next to the grill and counter seats- I would have preferred a seat in the main dinning room that would have given us some more surface area. I know it's a popular place so I actually really appreciate how they try to get as much seating as possible, but I still feel like a sardine when I'm told ""excuse me"" by staff every few minutes.

But I digress.

While me and the hubs were leaving the outlet mall after working up an appetite from shopping, we were at a loss for where to go to lunch.  As we are at the stop light in front of Lola's, which is located next to that old Holsum Bakery (you've seen it- bright neon lights on Charleston, with a large clock), I made a fast turn into the parking lot.

We walked into Lola's and its a very small, quaint little place that has that has that feel of ""this could be either really good or really bad"".  Luckily for us, it was good!

Our waiter, totally forgot his name (Frankie?) was really nice and gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted.

We decided to share a crab cake appetizer and the Bronzed Catfish and Grits.  Me, being from the Midwest, I've never had grits and was very excited to try them!

On the menu, it says there is a $5 charge for sharing, but it's just there to discourage people from doing that all the time, so there really isn't a charge- hooray!

OMG- the Bronzed Catfish & Grits- Fresh bronzed Catfish served over Smoked Gouda Grits with an Andouille Sausage and Mushroom Ragout.  Totally DELISH!  WOW!  

The seasonings on the catfish will blow you away- perfect amount, just a tiny bit of spice (if you don't like spicy, you will love this as there isn't really any spice at all), cooked flaky.  The grits, ohhh man, the grits.  These gouda grits are so yummy!  creamy and have great flavor!  I don't like sausage (hey- get that 6th grade humor outta here! ;) ) but this was very good.  However, I don't remember a mushroom ragout... maybe it was mixed in?

I would layer my fork with catfish, grits & sausage and smile as i was chewing, it was that good.

The crab cake appetizer was good, but unfortunate for us, we asked for it to come out with the catfish & grits and the catfish & grits totally took over and we ignored the crab cake.

We would love to come back and try the crawfish... we hear Friday's are the day to enjoy them!

I wasn't upset I wasn't dissatisfied with our meal(s) at all we enjoyed the vibe and the food however as a tip to Lola and her staff....If a customer says the food is undercooked that maybe it's not cooked enough for their liking and just fix it! 

I recommend this place if you go in earlier in the day not wait till your the last of the customers and don't get the greens unless you like allot of vinegar with your greens....The grits, soft shell crab and the artichoke dip is amazing, the gumbo was just okay!",wAwlgeJpWY_-RUqHLGTx3w,3,0,3,zuVccedzUfuKRkPP5JcuUQ

2138639,2011-08-17,3,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I wish I could give this place a five star rating. I absolutely loved the food the couple of times I've eaten there. However, service was miserable on my second visit.

Starting with the food - I've been able to try a bunch of items on their menu. The Catfish with grits is amazing. I've never been a big fan of grits, but Lola's has definitely changed my mind. It's not the tasteless mushy crap you get at other places. Both their shrimp po boy and philly cheese steak po boy are good, especially for their price. And their red beans and rice had great flavor to it, and even has some sausage mixed in with it. The only part that semi bothered me was they don't give you much rice with it. The proportion of rice to beans is extremely off. 

Now on to the service. The first time I went, there was only a couple other tables that were filled, and service was decent. It definitely wasn't the service I expected seeing as that they weren't very busy, but it was something I could live with. On my second visit, the service was miserable enough to make me never want to go back. 

After we were seated, we were not approached again for another 6-8 minutes. Someone finally took our drink orders, with the promise that our waitress would be any minute. He came back with our drinks, and another five minutes later - no one had approached us. Finally, the guy who took our drink orders, came back & said our waitress was busy and that he would take our food orders. I ordered a po boy and asked for it to be dressed. When the food came, it wasn't dressed. Our two drinks sat on our table empty for a good ten minutes. Finally, a waitress asked if our ice tea needed to be replenished, simply because she had a pitcher of ice tea in her hand, but completely ignored the other empty glass on the table. Also, the wait to get the check was long as well. 

By the end of the meal, I was so annoyed at the horrible service and wait time I had experienced. I can usually deal with sub par service, but Lola's took it to the extreme. 

Will I be back? I'm not quite sure. I'm in love with their food - but don't think I can handle another shitty experience.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,4,3,3,Tpo_89LKbKG9Xout4WJFAQ
2140496,2015-06-26,2,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I enjoyed Lola's very much! I've driven past it a million times (well, not a million, but many), and always wanted to stop in. 
It's not much to look at, and it is pretty small, but it is decorated with lots of New Orleans memorabilia and could accurately be described as quaint.
When we arrived shortly after 6p on a Thursday evening, it was only moderately busy, but by the time we left, Lola's was completely full, with people waiting outside for tables.
Service was very good, especially considering how busy they were. I especially appreciated the young bus boy politely asking each time if he may take away my dishes. 
I feel as though I didn't quite order the right thing (an oyster po-boy) and a side of the Gouda grits, because I wasn't especially impressed with the po-boy. It was okay, but nothing to write home about, and I've certainly had far better in NOLA. However, the grits were amazing! They were thick, dense, tasty, and the mushroom ragout and sausage only added to the flavor.
My dining companion loved his jambalaya, with the only complaint being that there wasn't enough of it! 
Next time I definitely will order one of the combo platters- the catfish looked amazing too! 
We finished with a delicious slice of the sweet potato pecan pie, which was a great way to cap off the evening.
Prices were very reasonable, with entrees ranging from about $15-$25. 
Just a note, Lola's only serves soft drinks, beer and wine- no hard liquor. That didn't bother me a bit, but some people might like to know!

We ordered the gumbo and crawpuppies as an appetizer. Gumbo was decent and we really loved the crawpuppies. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp Charlotte. It was amazing!!! Grits were moist and had a good flavor and the shrimp was blackened a bit. Whatever sauce is on it had a kick to it. The shrimp Charlotte was good although I'm not big on pasta. We ordered the banana foster bread pudding too. Really tasty!!!!The total bill was $60 which was way cheaper than I expected. Service was good.

We finally got around to making a reservatoin (recommended) and we tried it on a sunday afternoon.  HOLY MOLY!!.  My family is from New Orleans.  My mother cooked some of the best creole food ever.  Notice, I said Creole, NOT cajun.  There is a difference between the two.  Cajun food tends to be HOT and spicy.  Creole food is just seasoned to perfection and does not burn your mouth.  It just gives you a really nice feeling and it is hard to quit eating it is so delicious.  Lola's has this down.  The Gumbo is tasty, seasoned well, not overseasoned and not spicy hot.  Just right.  I had a fried oyster poboy, we called it an oyster loaf in NO.  It was fabulous.  It really helps that they ship their french bread in from NOLA.  You just can't get french bread like that anywhere else.  I only wish they had a ""seafood gumbo"" with crab and shrimp.  That would be really good.  I will definetly be back again.  Remember, if you are looking for Cajun food, this is not the place, but if want Creole, get to Lola's.  Also, Have desert!  The bread pudding is amazing.  We shared it.

The thing craving most was good true authentic Po Boy. You see them around town but all the ones ever tasted not mention names but horrible. I always felt starts with the bread if bread not true then say got problems. The bread was perfect. I got full dressing with my soft shell Po Boy option but well recommend it comes with the sauce/ shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes and the Soft Shell were MONSTERS. LIterally two on sandwich where just one alone more then half the size of the bread. It fried too perfection. All other Po Boys had not enough of protein order in the sandwich and all taste not as fresh. Lola the soft shell crab sure fresh just on size of them. The fries were good. I really looking forward too Po Boy once realize huge portion you got had no room for the fries. Still eat half! They have five or six of them on the menu. You can count on me going back not only try more Po Boy but so many other things want try jambalaya, gumbo, and goes on and on. 

The atmosphere if very much New Orleans flair from the Saints decorations, I love independent family run business feel, such small place probably hold less then hundred people, and seeing Lola active walking around the restaurant or going in the back cooking it up and talking guest refreshing see in restaurant owner cares. She greeted me walk in and nice person cool see on tv then in person. 

It was pretty packed so good thing just me. I sat at the bar even that is about as small as it gets think eight seats or less. It not bar bar but bartender was really nice guy. Talking stories with him at times. If anything you get too see them grill off bread serve too the tables for entertainment. Do have widescreen there too just saying. 

I huge fan of Lola. Without doubt for me if want TRUE too the HEART creole or new orleans cooking Lola is only place too go. Make sure if go busy times might  want put reservation really small restaurant.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,6,5,zWaKbX_8M-HaEI7nC--SvQ
2288897,2015-08-31,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,This place has the New Orleans vibe on the inside but the food was not impressive one bit. It lacked the creole Cajun flavor I'm use to when eating a true Louisiana dish.,iDIjPiwE1JS5fp90AoUt_Q,0,0,2,JQ0KdG_ZdJbAw8tsdTm9Aw
2290269,2014-08-21,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I have to say, after reading the reviews I was very disappointed by the  Yelp community.  This place should not have 4 stars.  I think that even 2 stars is being generous. I had high hopes for this place but they sizzled to the floor moments after I walked in.

We went to Lola's on a Friday evening.  It was busy like most restaurants in Vegas are on Friday so I don't hold it against the establishment.  What most people don't realize is that this is a TINY restaurant.  There are not very many tables at all.  It is insanely loud too.  The table we sat at was not even and we had to constantly shift weights on the table to keep it level.  Our order was taken pretty quickly after we arrive and we ordered some oysters for starters.  We use to live in coastal Washington so when a restaurant has oysters on the menu, we typically order them for the nostalgia they bring.  Our oysters were more than broiled, they were burned and hard to chew.  This is frankly one of the worst oyster experiences I have ever had.  Oysters should never be hard to chew.  There was liquor in them either.  Even broiled oysters should have a liquor--even if it is just a bourbon or butter based sauce, it needs to be there.  They cost us $12.49 for a plate of inedible chew-balls from the sea.  They were tiny too--like the size of dimes for the oyster meat--or, at least what was left of the oysters after the kitchen got their fiery hands on them! Because I understand that not every dish is created equally I still held my hopes high for the main course.

Those hopes were drowned by the 50 minute wait time from appetizer to entree.  We watched guests that were seated after us be served their dishes well in advance of us.  We really felt ignored.  Our waitress filled our water glasses once during the entire night--even though we were there a few hours.  

I ordered the Catfish platter which on the menu has a number 3 beside it, indicating there would be 3 fillets.  Because I spent a lot of time in the South and I love ""bronzed"" catfish I ordered mine to be the same.  I must note that bronzed fish in no way translates to dried, black, inedible fish.  When my plate finally arrived it had one very blackened piece of fish on it.  My fish was so dry I quit eating shortly after I started.   The seasoning was over salted as well.  The waitress never came to ask how my dish was either.  I was very disappointed.  For one piece of dried out horrible fish, it racked up the bill another $15.   My fiance ordered the the Shrimp Creole ($15.99) and his shrimp were also over cooked but not to the point where they were inedible.  So, he shared with me.   My daughter ordered a plain Caesar salad ($8.99) because there were no children's options and she is a vegetarian (this place is NOT vegetarian friendly at all--they actually make a point of hinting at that on the menu: most things are non-vegetarian and they make no acceptations or substitutions!  God forbid some grits not have chicken stock in them.)   

We ordered two glasses of  wine and were given the wrong type of wine or a very poor substitution for what we ordered.  The sodas are also pretty expensive so make sure you are prepared to spend 10-15 on just a few glasses of coke if you order this.  Our bill went over $100 which is sad since 1/2 of the items we ordered were cooked wrong and even things we could not eat.    

It's been a few weeks since our visit here and I still have eater's remorse.  We wont come back to eat here ever again.  We're still on the hunt for a good Cajun place in Vegas--- *sighs*",uyFqrPdYiAr_onr24BUEDQ,2,0,2,TYdPiFMuz4jy64dJrmlmHQ

I hadn't heard of Lola's but apparently they're a big deal and have appeared on ""Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives"" for their roast beef po' boy. I was glad to try a local spot, away from the strip and downtown casinos. Lola's had a quaint, simple atmosphere that was very welcoming (and some TVs in case you need to catch the game). Our waitress was great, positive and seemed happy to be there.

I had a glass of chardonnay ($6) and it was pretty good. Some native Louisianans were super excited for Abita beer, of which they had many varieties. 

Bf & I split the Shrimp Étouffée and the Cafish Po' Boy with Fries and Potato Salad. The Étouffée was very tasty but could have been a little spicier. It was warm and comforting and filling though - exactly what I wanted. The catfish po' boy was a big surprise -- it was WAY better than I expected. The hoagie roll (apparently flown in from Louisiana) was amazing. So soft and fluffy and crispy. The remoulade was amazing too... I could have maybe just had that and bread and been satisfied. The fries were tasty, the potato salad was very ""meh"".

Believe it or not I ate my whole plate of Shrimp Creole. I saved room for dessert, and I chose to do the Bananas Foster. It was sweet and warm and so good.

2367783,2013-05-26,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Summary:  2-star food, with 1-star service.  I'm rounding up by giving them 2 stars.  Let's review this by separating the kitchen from the waitstaff.  Note to Lola:  You were at a wine tasting, and your staff does a horrible job when you are not there.  I'm sorry for the detailed review, but I'm hoping that Lola actually sees this and responds.  

Food:
Drinks:  Interesting beers in bottles.  Nothing on tap.  
Apps:  Crab/artichoke dip was good.  Crawfish puppies (hush puppy knock off) was not worth the money or the calories.  The salad is unimaginative and tasteless, but at least it wasn't brown lettuce.  
Entree:  a pound of crawfish, ordered medium, came out with the appetizers and was cold when we wanted to eat them.  They remade them for us, but it was so spicy and salty that it was impossible to enjoy.  The crawfish are pre-cooked, instead of being cooked to order, as told to us by our server.  They had blackened salmon on the menu and tons of po' boys, so I asked if they could make me a salmon po' boy...no dice.  Apparently, no one in the restaurant was willing to ""take the risk"" of changing the menu while Lola was out of the restaurant.  Anyway, the blackened salmon was well-cooked, but over-seasoned.  I like spicy, but you lose the flavor with this amount of blackening spice.  I asked for a side of sweet potato fries, but I can't tell you if they taste good or not (see the service comments).  Debris po' boy was all hype, and not up to DDD (curse you Guy Fieri).  The meat was good, but the gravy was cold.  The catfish po' boy was solid.  The soft shell crab po' boy was a nice sized chunk of crab, breaded and deep-fried.  Too much breading, too much bread, too much mayo.  

Total bill $150, and I'm going to make some food now that I'm home.  I'm hungry and irritated.  

Service:  
Ambiance:  We sat outside, so some things are harder to control, but the entire patio was blinded by the setting sun, but no employees did anything about it, even after we asked.  I had to go take one of the restaurant umbrellas from the side of the patio and position it to block the sun.  This helped enough tables that I received a large round of applause.  (We weren't the only table suffering.)  Flies all around our table too.  
Servers:  Our server had little knowledge of the menu, since she was a vegetarian.  Our water glasses were never filled until the end of the meal when someone asked for some...and she only filled that one glass.  The crawfish entree for one of our group came out with appetizers, with no response from the server.  She acknowledged that they shouldn't have come out so soon, but left them there and walked off.  They took my silverware away with my salad, so I had none for my piece of salmon.  I waved politely to get someone's attention, but one waitress in particular (Beth - blonde curly hair) looked right at me on three separate occasions and walked away.  (note:  Beth was not our waitress.)  They brought me the wrong side dish (no big deal) and made me sweet potato french fries (which the waitress had recommended).  And I had asked for a side of BBQ sauce, because it is the greatest condiment in the world...The waitress asked if I wanted the house-made signature BBQ sauce or the stuff they get from a bottle...duh.  5 minutes later, the fries were still pretty hot, and I reminded the waitress for the BBQ sauce.  So 15 minutes later the fries were warm, I asked a 3rd time for the BBQ sauce.  After 35 minutes, my fries were cold and I had given up on them entirely.  My GF asked the waitress ""what happened to the BBQ sauce?"" and she brought me out a tiny cup of it, and told me it was ""the junk from the bottle"" since it takes too long to make the house-made sauce.  Oddly enough, I didn't feel like eating it.  When it was time for our check, we gave them our credit cards and waited for 15 minutes.  When no one picked up the cards to process them, I walked them in and gave them to a waiter (again, not our own).  10 minutes later, as I came back from the restroom (filthy), I saw our check and walked over and asked a waiter (again, not ours) if anyone could please run the cards so we could leave.

When I received my ordered I was speechless. By looking at my lunch you can tell how much love they put into my dish. My Red Beans and Rice appeared to be slowly cooked and  the  sausage grilled with a light char. The Craw puppies were evenly fried all around with a nice toasty color. I took my first bite of the Red Beans and Rice and WOW it was even more than I was expecting, flavors bursting out from everywhere. The Red Beans were so tender  they literally melted in my mouth .The  char on the sausage had a nice grilled flavor that compliments the beans in a wonderful way. The Crawpuppies were delicious as well, they   were crunchy on the outside,moist and soft on the inside with a delicious dipping sauce to dip them  in. My Coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and the Toasty bread they serve was tasty also. The service was also a big plus, as soon as you walk in they greet  you immediately, you automatically felt like part  of the family and they were also very attentive. Finally the bill came and it too was rewarding. Everything was reasonably priced,The service was attentive and the atmosphere felt  just like home.

I ordered the Gumbo spicy, and it was moderately spicy. For $13.00, they really skimped on the chicken and whatever else was in it. The Oyster House definitely has a better gumbo, and they make each one from scratch. Only problem is you'll probably wait three plus hours. 

The Famous Banana pudding saves the day. They make a toffee sauce that consists of a Jimmy Bean reduction. It was absolutely out of this world! In the viewers opinion, it is the best bread pudding he has eaten that dates this review. Outstanding.

A couple of reasons. 
Firstly and mainly- the food. 
Everything was good. The wings (level 10 is like a level 5 of Thai spice) for sure made with a homemade Louisiana style sauce. 
Crab cake- yum. 
Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken was for sure from scratch and had a hit of Cajun flare. 
Shrimp Charlotte, angel hair with light sauce, mushrooms and shrimp. Spicy and a tad dry but the flavor & a squeeze of a lemon made up for it.

You should probably stop reading reviews and just go there because this is the best NOLA food you'll find in Vegas! If I'm wrong please tell me because I love me some NOLA food.

We drove out from the strip ( only a couple of miles ) and had a late lunch here. It is a little place in a small strip mall, but the food is very good. The service was quick and friendly. We tried the grilled oysters for an appetizer, which were pretty good, but not quite up to the Acme Oyster House in Louisiana.The crawfish ettoffee was very good and not overly spicy. Some places haven't figured out that the key to good Creole food is the flavor of the spice, not the quantity. The fried seafood platter was good, not great. It was a little greasy, but overall was OK. For this type of food to find its way into Las Vegas, is a great change of pace to the overpriced, over hyped places in this town.

Started with the craw puppies and hot crab & artichoke dishes. As I'm not a huge fan of hush puppies the craw puppies were head and shoulders above the norm. Very good, moist and seasoned just right. Enough of a crunch, but not overly hard. The crab and artichoke dip along with their special bread they fly in daily from New Orleans was creamy, hot and spiced perfectly. 

For our lunch entries we had the fried shrimp and fried oyster po' boys with sides of sweet potato fries and red beans and rice.   Angela,our server, was nice enough to mention that the po' boy could be split between half shrimp and have oysters.  The shrimp can be ordered blackened, bronzed, fried or grilled.  I went with the traditional fried. The sandwiches came ""fully dressed"" (lettuce, tomato & mayo).  The oysters and shrimp were perfectly fried. Crunchy, seasoned and NOT oily or soft. Spot on. Our sides were up to par as well. 

All in all a great near downtown eatery to have a business lunch and grab a taste of the South.

I had never heard of this place before and just happened to see it as we drove by on the way to Frankie's Tiki room. Lucky us!! It was about 5pm on a Friday afternoon and there were a few tables open, but we like to sit at the bar and eat. Right away, a really nice guy came to us and asked us where we were from and told us about the menu and the food we were considering.  (I'm mad at myself for not getting his name. I usually do) After we ordered, he talked to us for a while- really nice fellow.

We ordered the Gumbo, Shrimp and Smoked Gouda Grits, and Crabcake Entree. All were awesome and I was especially in love with the grits. Being from the South, I've had my share of grits and I can honestly say these were the best I've ever had, no lie. For desert we ordered this amazing ""pie"" I don't remember what it was called but the bottom part was cherries in a red wine reduction sauce topped with homemade cheesecake. Oh Lord it was good!!!

First visit was a Sunday, and we learned when we arrived that they feature a Saints gameday brunch.  Everything you'd expect from a proper Southern brunch, and we each left approximately five pounds heavier.  (This was also the Sunday that the Browns inexplicably beat the Saints, so we were careful to hide that particular Yankee affiliation.)

Second visit was weekday lunchtime.  I had the jambalaya with shrimp, the bro had the shrimp & grits, we split the crawpuppies appetizer, and all were fantastic.

The food alone would be reason to return, but part of what makes Lola's work is the service - very Southern in the sense that they treat you like family immediately, right down to the good-natured ribbing.  When Lola talked us into the bread pudding dessert, another server passed by, smiled, and said, ""Did you tell them what they're going to order?""  That kind of thing.  The bread pudding is absolutely dynamite, by the way - save room for it, if you can.

Hubby and I had the chicken wings (sooooo darn tasty, borderline salty, but real good... stuff I think I'd crave if I'm pregnant ;), the bronzed catfish was UHmazing, melt in your mouth spiced goodness with equally scrumptious cheesy grits and a mushroom sauce.  I was so happy to have found a place that had charbroiled oysters (not raw, not baked, but a good in-between prep) topped with butter, lemon and a little cheese. If the oysters were larger, it would've been perfect.  And since it was my very first time to try gumbo (yes, it was), I can't really say if theirs was good.  But if they did serve a typical gumbo, I just don't think I'm a gumbo gal.  

The place has a good selection of beer and wine, but I was desperately craving vodka or a light cocktail.  Wine just fills me up too fast when I'm already having a heavy meal.  The crowd also significantly thinned by 8 and 9pm.  Maybe they wanted something substantial to wash away the heavy goodness... or the disagreeable service.

It's like they knew us and we were friends over for dinner. 

We ordered the gumbo and char grilled oysters and I gotta say.... they kind of missed the mark with both. While both were good, the oysters were small and overcooked. They were seasoned perfectly but cooked so long that they literally would not come out of the shell. The gumbo was more of a seafood gravy with rice. Definitely too thick to be a gumbo. It did have a good flavor though. 

We also ordered the hot wings (not pictured. They tasted like they were just drowned in hot sauce. Seriously just hot for no reason. I love spicy food but when something is so spicy that you can't enjoy it... it's kind of pointless.

Lastly, we ordered the pecan sweet potato pie. It was... interesting. It sounds much better together than it tasted.

Friends and family had noted that Lola's best items were in things like the Jambalaya, craw puppies, Etoufee and things like Po' Boys were nothing too remarkable.

Knowing this, for lunch, I shared the craw puppies with a friend, and had the Jambalaya.  Crawpuppies were ok, but unfortunately didn't stand out too much for me.

Jambalaya was not quite as good as I had hoped - it was a bit soggy/mushy/overly moist and undercooked and was a bit clumpy as opposed to the rice grains standing on their own, and didn't have this nice crust some Jamabalaya comes with from the well cooked rice (a hallmark of Paella as well).  Had to add quite a bit of seasoning to the Jambalaya as well, as it was underseasoned in my assessment.

I really hope Lola's can make it happen at this location.  Based on other reviews here of Lola's which are generally pretty good, perhaps my experience is unusual, and I will likely try Lola's again to give it another chance.  This is a great location, particularly with the RTC, County Government Center, City Hall, UMC/Hospitals/Medical Offices, Arts District, UNLV Shadow Lane Campus and many courts and law offices in the area - and a mid level good restaurant should do well.

My man and I walked in on a random Tuesday night to a fully packed house. The 2 servers looked a bit overwhelmed but ushered us to a table (I was glad I had made a reservation!) and gave us some menus. As I looked around the restaurant, my excitement only grew. Lola's certainly makes you feel like you're at someone's kitchen in New Orleans. Several New Orleans photos hang on the walls, and a Saints flag is on display at the front of the restaurant. And, while the colorful umbrellas hanging from the pipes were a bit kitch, they were cute kitch. 

Unfortunately, it was the food that disappointed. First, bread caked with butter (I'm assuming garlic bread but we were not sure) came out to the table. It was almost inedible. Thankfully, the charbroiled oysters came out next, and they were delish. Soon to follow were the crawfish puppies (they taste a lot like conch fritters), which were also pretty good. Finally, what should have been the star of the show, the bronzed catfish served over grits, came out. As I dug into my first bite of the grits, any excitement I had for eating grits in Vegas went out the door... the grits were stone cold. I mean, super duper cold. When I asked my server if grits were supposed to be served cold, she said no and promptly took our plate back to the kitchen. I assumed that she was going to have the chef remake the plate and send it back (as we had like 4 bites total of the fish). Instead, they had simply removed the old grits, plopped new (potentially microwaved) grits on the plate, and reserved the same plate! Unfortunately, the fish got cold because it took about 5 minutes to bring the plate back! And, any stock on the plate had now disappeared because they had scooped it all out when getting rid of the old grits so that the food became extremely dry. 

All in all, a lackluster meal with lackluster service. What a shame.....",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,3,2,2,8xXIK2XznoLG2do6iovYYA

I had read the rave reviews on Yelp and wanted to try some Louisiana food so I could compare it to what I'm used to as I lived in New Orleans for over 10 years. But as you're driving from the outlet mall towards Lola's, it's hard to tell if they are even open. This time we decided to take our chances and drive over there. The parking lot is actually on the side of the building and difficult to see from the street. I'm so glad we made it to Lola's! We started out with the tasty crab and artichoke dip served with garlic bread. I have to give a shout out to the bread also. It was delicious. We also had the Cajun wings which were good but not overwhelmingly so. For my entrée, I had the bronzed shrimp and grits. One reason I decided to try this dish is because the shrimp is served over gouda grits. An andouille sausage and mushroom ragout is drizzled around the outside of the dish. I really enjoyed this entrée. The only thing is that the next time I will have the ragout omitted. Everyone else said the sauce was fine but it wasn't my preference. The customer service is A+. Thanks to our waitress for answering our numerous questions and making suggestions on how to ""customize"" some of our entrees. We enjoyed Lola's so much that my friends insisted we come again two days later. Our second visit to Lola's was on the last day of our trip. This time I had a half fried shrimp and half fried oyster po-boy with a side of gouda grits and coleslaw. Everything was great. No complaints from any of us.

I said: ""All right, all right, all right!""

Getting here is kind of tricky. The best method from the freeway is to take the I15 Northbound and exit the Charleston exit south and dive into the first driveway opening on the right and find the first parking spot available. The next best ways are to approach on Charleston from west to hit that driveway or take Grand Central Pkwy going north to south and drive straight into the driveway to the parking lot. You cannot make a left facing west to get in to the parking lot.

Accommodations included indoor and patio dining. Indoor dining is small space that has a sports bar feel with wide screens on the walls. We should have made reservations but the waitress was very cool and gave us a seat right away. Decor all over is NoLA fun and party ready.

We went family style eating off each other's orders and requested of the kitchen the Char-Broiled Oysters, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, Jambalaya-Chicken & Sausage with extra sausage, and Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened shrimp. Let's start with the oysters. First, I do not like oysters in general. These I will eat. About grits, I am not a fan of grits either. To use my dinner friend's phrase: ""The grits were a revelation."" They were very creamy and went well with the shrimp and other food on our plates. Other highlights included the table favorite jambalaya (everything on that was perfect) and blackened shrimp fettuccine (nothing too oily nor overcooked; the pasta was fresh, al dente tasty and shrimp followed suit). No missteps here. The clean, orderly presentation was a great touch.

What's my bottom line? My friend was right. This is the best place to get your down home  Louisiana fix at. Great food, quaint atmosphere, sports game on the widescreen, southern hospitality in a western state. The experience made a limited Cajun skeptic like me into a NoLA cuisine believer. I've got to get the red beans and rice next time. My work friend swears by them. My actual rating is a solid 4.6 stars...",azBg2Tl2ncITAXKdX07tGQ,4,2,5,uC29kYUtZIWcDlCF2cY7bA

You could taste the crawfish and they were hot and fresh so that was good.  I was underwhelmed by the shrimp and grits. I have had this dish at different restaurants and I have to say that Lola's version was not the best. It wasnt bad, I just expected more flavor.  The grits were hot and creamy, which was good. But the actual shrimp mixture lacked flavor in my opinion.

My friend got chicken and sausage jambalaya which was also tasty! (I tried it...I always do) It was perfectly spicy, not too much for his sensitive tongue.

As seasoned amateur foodies we like to each order different plates so we can share and try a few things at once.

My wife and I started off with an appetizer, the ""Craw Puppies.""
Sorry we didn't read the ingredients, but they were very good.
They had the perfect amount of heat, flavor and seasoning. As my wife put it, ""the dipping sauce was like WOW! you could have licked the dipping bowl clean it was so good."" LOL!  And I totally scraped all I could from it. :-)

Up second was the ""Roast Beef Debris Po-Boy"" Sandwich as seen on ""Diners, Drive-in's and Dives""

Man this Po-Boy was one of the best roast beef sandwiches we've ever had-hands down. It had just the perfect amount of beef gravy and it did not make the bread soggy. The bread crust was flakey and had a nice medium crunch to it.
The beef was tender, the red onions added the right amount of flavoring to it. A must try for sure!

3rd on the list was the ""Shrimp Po-Boy Blackened""
Using the same bread, this sandwich had real Cajun flavors in every bite. The blackened seasoning was again WOW! Spectacular! We loved this sandwich and if and when we return to Vegas we will no doubt get this as a go to sandwich.

Finally dessert. We decided on the ""Bread Pudding.""
This had small chunks of walnuts and raisins with a home made sweet sauce covering it, topped off with whipped cream.
This was very good, not soft and soggy, but firm enough to cut with your fork and not have to eat with a spoon. LOL!

But the home made sauce was what really put this dessert over the top. At first we couldn't figure it out, then it hit me, so I asked the waiter if the sauce had any Jack Daniels in it? Smiling , all he would say was that ""it has some booze in it."" 
He wasn't willing to give away the secret sauce info. LOL!

All in all, we really loved this place and would definitely go back in a heart beat. And the prices are very reasonable for Louisiana Creole-Cajun style cooking.

I was excited to return - I'd come by when they were in their first couple of months of operation for dinner and had a wonderful time.  Today was not so hot. The food was excellent - the service? boooooooooooooooo.

We were there for lunch and it was clearly busy.  But we didn't see a waiter or waitress for nearly 20 minutes after being seated.  No drinks, no menus, no nothing.  I finally saw a guy at the other end of the cozy dining room and raised my hand to get his attention.  He actually looked up, waved at me, rolled his eyes and proceeded to continue laying out silverware as if we didn't exist.  Is he related to someone there?  Only reason I can think of to have such a bad attitude at the front of the house representing your business. 

A few minutes later the (manager? co-owner?) came by and finally asked to take our drink orders.  I let him know about the fact that his staff had ignored us.  (eyeroll was still laying out silverware at the end of the dining room, so was easy to point out).  No apology and no acknowledgment from that guy either.  Fish rots from the head down i guess.

In Depth Review: I have been driving by this little restaurant tucked away in the old Holsum Bread Bakery on Charleston Ave and wanting to check it out since it opened 5 years ago. This past Thursday (7/17/14), I had the chance to go after a shopping trip across the street at the Premium Outlets with my wife. We got there at 8pm and the sign in the window switched to ""closed"" as we were walking up. The same sign said: ""open til 9pm,""  so we went in and took our chances. Restaurant was full and we were greeted by the GM named Hank at the entrance. Hank was friendly, said he would get us sat and that they switch to closed at 8pm sharp as that is the last seating time. So arrive early folks or you may not be seated to eat. This small but cozy place was full on a Thursday night. Seating is very limited, so I advise a reservation in advance (especially on the weekend). 

I was thirsty. Hank suggested a Louisiana micro brewery that they carry named Abita. Never had it and went with their Amber beer. It was chilled and was quite possibly the best beer I have had in a long time. Have since went to Total Wine & Liquor here in Vegas and filled my fridge with it. Try it, you can thank me later. 

Hank knew we were very hungry and that it was our first time visiting Lola's, he was kind enough to bring over a nice sampler of three of their best selling items. This was a nice touch and it solidified what we would eventually order as our entrees. He introduced us to our waitress and she was very knowledgeable of the dishes and made made good suggestions, including the crab-cake appetizer. We each ordered one and they were AMAZING! This is real crab, they are fresh, massive and not the frozen ""Krab"" cakes that many high-end restaurants try to pass off as ""authentic"" in Vegas. 

For our entrees we ordered the Catfish and Gouda Cheese Grits and Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits. The dishes were large and plentiful. The dishes were love at first bite. These Gouda Cheese Grits are a divine experience. Every bite was full of flavor. I inhaled my Shrimp and Gouda Cheese Grits and literally used the soft garlic bread to wipe the plate clean of any remaining evidence, I mean sauce. Both plates are a MUST try! 

We took some of Lola's special ""bread pudding"" home with us to eat later as we were both very full after eating our entrees. The bread pudding was also a divine experience that you must have if you visit. So good!!! 

Hank checked on us as we were finished and was kind enough to introduce us to the owner, Lola. We spoke to her and she was very kind and welcoming. She was happy that we had finally stopped in and invited us to come back and be part of the ""family."" I felt her words were legit and that she truly meant that. Good to see an owner be a gracious host and talk to the tables and guests. She touched every table and said goodbye to everyone. Could tell many guests were her regulars as she knew them by first name. What hospitality, you just don't see this in Vegas these days! 

Overall: I cannot wait to go back. I have already told dozens of people about my experience at Lola's last Thursday. Lola, Hank and the entire ""family"" at Lola's will welcome you with open arms. Just call ahead first and make that reservation, space is limited and it will fill up.

The food is okay, but nothing rave about and the prices are so so.  We arrived at 11 am as they opened so the place was empty.  I'm a quick eater, as were the other two I was with, so we finished quickly.  We finished our meals, and we didn't get a refill on our drinks.  It didn't take long to understand why they didn't give us refills on our drink.  The place had filled up in 40 minutes.  It wasn't long before someone (I presume it must have been Lola, but not sure since this person didn't identify herself to us) approached us and asked us if we wanted a refill.  I told her I didn't, but one of my coworkers said they would like half a glass.  We were told there were others waiting outside for a table, so we got the message that we weren't welcome anymore.  My coworker told her never mind, and then she offered a to go cup.  

We weren't ""hogging"" a table, but were made to feel that we weren't welcome.  Needless to say this is the last time we will eat at Lola's because their management does not respect their customers.

E.g Hot & Juicy would be slightly above average compared to what you can get in the South when looking at quality and price.  But everything is relative to where you live, so this place really stands out for cajun/louisina food.

 I ordered the Crawfish Etoufee and cup of Gumbo.  The Etoufee was well seasoned and spiced.  I liked the bread they served with the Etoufee to mop up all the juice.  The gumbo could have used a little more kick.

Located right off Charleston and the I/15 you will find this hidden gem of a restaurant. I get random invites all the time from clients on these business lunches and I sometimes run out of places to think of to go eat on the spur of the moment. Today was different though I have been craving some Cajun style southern cuisine dishes and thought hmm why not check off this Lola's in my ""bookmark"" section on Yelp!

For starters when you are traveling to this restaurant for the first time pay close attention because it's super easy to drive right past. Look for this small turn in of an entry to the Holsum Bread bakery and Lola's will be right next door. Upon arriving it was to my surprise that they weren't as busy as I had anticipated especially around lunch time! Seated right away?! Score! Our server was awesome and super attentive to us the entire time we were there. I can always appreciate great customer service at restaurants when they make recommendations knowing it's my first visit. 

Lunch was as followed:

Drinks: 2 ""Muddy Waters"" Pretty much Lemonade & Iced Tea

Appetizer: Crab Cake- Lump blue crab, hand-formed with special seasonings. Served on a bed of mixed greens drizzled with a lemon garlic aioli sauce.

Blackened Chicken- Served with two sides (country potato salad/Mardi Gras Coleslaw)

Bronzed Catfish & Grits- Seasoned and bronzed catfish served over Gouda grits with an Andouille sausage & mushroom ragout.

Food total is going to be a 4 out of 5. The crab cake appetizer was so-so I do believe there was too much bread or something in it that took away the crab taste. My client is from the south and knows much about crab cakes and agreed. Overall though, this place definitely didn't disappoint and will return very soon. I was informed on this visit that they also have a Summerlin location which for me would be so much more convenient!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,19,18,4,UbTuSwQoCXB6hoMszCN63w

The employees are really weird here. They just stare at you and are generally awkward. I thought it was just me but others have commented on this. In addition to being weird they aren't friendly. They will try to not give you bread on your order and fill your food up halfway. I bought banana pudding and it was so close to halfway full that I took it back. There's no way I'm paying all that for a half of a container. The main dishes are never filled when you order to go. I don't know how it is ordering in because I never wanted to sit and eat with the creeps who work there. 

I'm not coming back for the mediocre food, weird people and stingy portions. I even had an employee come out and tell me that I couldn't park in the red. If I'm in the car I'm stopped not parked. When I was in the restaurant you didn't say thanks or anything but now you can come out to tell me to move? Are there police around or are you just being a pain? I wasn't parked there for a long time and I was really upset. 

The food is terrible! The jambalaya tastes like tomatoes with pepper. They give you such a tiny portion you need something else to go with it. The beans and rice are bad, there's no real seasoning to them. They are stingy with the sausages in all the dishes I've tried. The banana pudding is good but not great.

Two waitresses were walking around serving the other tables just next to us but didn't even take our drink order.

My wife doesn't eat seafood so she went with fettuccine alfredo with chicken ($14) and I got the shrimp and grits. The fettuccine was really tasty, a lot more flavor than most pasta-focused places and the chicken was delicious. It was slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside. Her plate was a pretty large portion but the shrimp and grits seemed really small for $17. Either way, it was killer! The Ghouda grits are some of the best grits I've ever had...really creamy and taste amazing with the spiciness from the rest of the plate. There are 5 decent size shrimp on top which were plump and juicy. We also went with the bananas foster for dessert which was good but a little pricey at $8.

I even watched her show the table next to us how to get the meat out of the crawfish they ordered. All people working there were so nice!

3255622,2014-10-10,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Nope. We won't be back. 

Let me start by saying the service was great. Our server was a sweetheart. So, there is that. 

But right away we were disappointed when  the hostess told us there were no available seats within the restaurant. It was empty. But I guess there was some kind of event going on. Yet, all the attendees of the event were milling about outside. The entire time we were there, we never saw them go in and sit. This means we could have sat inside. 

We were not happy about sitting outside. West Charleston is right there and full of traffic. Annoying. Not to mention we were seated right on the curb so cars pulling into the restaurant were a mere arms length away. I just don't find sitting in the street with traffic a great ambiance for dinner. 

The food was just ok. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and I thought it was very good. For dinner I ordered the blackened salmon, green beans and grits. I was not impressed with the beans. They were slimy and tasteless. The grits were fantastic. They were the highlight of my meal. The salmon? Ugh. I'm a salmon junkie. I love salmon. I'll eat it cooked (or not) in any fashion. I eat it at least once a week. This was, hands down, the worst salmon I've ever had. The outside was covered in some kind of spicy seasoning. That would have been fine but the inside? No flavor at all. Zero. With all the spicy seasoning on the outside, there is no reason my taste buds should have been searching out for flavor. But they were. 

My husband had the jambalaya. He said it was good but then he said it would be hard to mess up jambalaya. He said it didn't taste any different than any other place he has had it. It was good, but nothing special. 

Even though they messed up the salmon--like seriously just terrible salmon--the gouda grits and the great service would have had me back for a second try--if not for the crappy location.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,1,0,1,7OprvWkVjOcwzoIYVf5n-g

The place is quite small but quaint, had good energy. I was greeted at our table right away since I came in a few minutes after my friend. I order moscato and shrimp and grits. My friend already had a Belgium beer and he ordered the crawfish Ettouffee. The food arrived fairly quick for a very busy restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Their garlic bread was awesome, and my shrimp and grits were by far the best I've ever had. I've had it at 2 other Cajun restaurants and they were mediocre. The seasoning was perfect for my taste. It was plenty of food, unfortunately I did not have room to finish it all. And no room for dessert! Their desserts looked amazing! It's been two days and I am already craving to go back.

Im giving Lolas 3 stars because besides the grits I thought the food was okay. I got the fried catfish platter with two sides. My sides were grits and red beans and rice. 

Catfish was moist and friend nicely. Red beans and rice was good too but neither was something I was wowed about. HOWEVER need i say GRITS again? GRITS GRITS GRITS. If i had only had that 5 stars. marriage proposals the whole 9 yards.

The gumbo is fantastic - rich, flavorful, full of ingredients. We had the gumbo on both visits. The entrees we tried over the 2 visits were the bronzed shrimp and grits, the jambalaya, and Mama's red beans and rice. All were rich, flavorful, and satisfying.

Food was ok though not spectacular (grits were overcooked & rubbery) and paying extra for cheese grits and red beans & rice at a Cajun joint seems like it oughtta be illegal. The real bummer came 20 minutes after we paid the bill. Poor service can sometimes be overlooked when a server is having an off night but you don't expect it from the manager or owner. I was reuniting with a close friend I haven't talked to for several years so our leisurely dinner was nearly two hours long and we had been talking for about 15 minutes after we paid the bill (which came very late) when the manager came over and told us a large group was coming in and he would need our table. He sounded perturbed and when I asked if he needed us to leave right now he suggested we could move to another table if we wanted to keep talking. We said no thanks and when I told him I didn't appreciate being rushed to leave our table he backtracked and apologized but didn't seem much effected when I told him I probably wouldn't come back. There are plenty of other good restaurants in downtown LV that don't mind letting old friends catch up for a few minutes after dinner.,FC5OCsFcOvdtJlwc4191iw,0,0,2,UMAZulXFM8YpqJNpnfxr0A

For our meal, we ordered the catfish and grits. It was a good portion size which is great because we always split our meals at restaurants.

3327055,2013-08-21,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Ok, I admit it - I got sucked into the DD&D's hype over this place.  I bought into the pizzazz and popularity, just like Chris Humphries did with Kim, and had my own whirlwind romance - his lasted 72 days, mine lasted about 7.2 minutes.  But I think my romance ended a little better than his - glad I tried Lola's, it was good, but it didn't blow me away.

The gumbo was fine, but lacking a kick or any real distinguishing characteristics.  There's a place in Chicago that I grew up going to that does it so much better, so it was tough to not draw comparisons.

I got the shrimp & grits based on the waitress's recommendation of that item being ""what keeps the locals coming back.""  Please note that I am in no way a connoisseur of grits, but these were way too cheesy and smooth for me - almost liquified, and completely overpowering with cheese.  But the gravy that included mushrooms & andouille sausage was good, as was the shrimp.

My dad had the fried chicken po' boy, and we found it to be boring - there was barely any chicken or sauce on it, and so it just felt sad and not Louisiana at all.  But his french fries were good.  My mom went with the jambalaya, which came out way too thick, like the consistency of the filling for chiles rellenos or shepherd's pie.  It did have a little kick of spice to it which was nice, but the rice was so so overcooked. 

Everything came out lickety-split, so if you're in a hurry you'd have no problem here.  If you've been to New Orleans and enjoyed the food, this doesn't feel like a true substitution for the real thing, but it's reminiscent enough to make you want to plan another vacation back to NOLA.",gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,1,0,3,zpVXNWhCe5ah4wsgqxdSpQ

My dad ordered the Roast beef debris. My mom ordered the Shrimp Etouffee and I ordered the Shrimp and Gouda grits. With out getting into too many details my dish and the shrimp etouffee that my mom ordered were easily 5 out 5 star dishes. The Roast beef debris po-boy was a 4 out of 5 star dish. Did not seem like the dish I would feature on DDD. Still a really good sandwich though. The only disappointing thing I had was the sweet tea. It didn't taste like the good sweet tea I've had in the south. It might have been old though. No big deal really,  just had a beer instead. More appropriate anyways. Dinner was great!  Service 5 out of 5 stars! The dessert was next. And this is where I was floored!  Ordered the banana pudding and the bread pudding. They also had a combination banana fosters bread pudding,  but I'll save that for next time. Anyways, the 2 puddings were spot on!  I'd put them both up against some of the best puddings I've ever had in Alabama,  Florida or Louisiana! These 2 desserts I'm praying are going to be featured on DDD.

However, the staff were very pleasant and playful. Enjoyed that. 
We ordered the hot artichoke and crab dip.  Pure oil and cheese. No flavor whatsoever. I topped it with Louisina hot sauce and that made it better. 
I ordered the salmon and my two sides were red beans and rice, as well as the greens with bacon. Both were under seasoned and bland. The rice was overcooked and loaded with water. The greens were soggy and absolutely had no flavor. The blackened salmon had an amazing Cajun rub, but was overcooked and dry. I've been to New Orleans and I hear the owner is from there .... so why is there no QA?  Someone needs to watch how this food is made and improve the dishes. Maybe it's a local thing and they take the spice out because most tourists are boring and don't like that kind of fare.  However, the cheese grits were amazing!!!!!  
I didn't taste or see any ""Holy Trinity"" in this place. It's an easy 3 ingredient with onions, bell peppers and celery. To make it even better add garlic, shallots and parsley. It makes any dish amazing.

we started our meal with a crab cake appetizer topped with creamy lemon aioli.

my husband's jambalaya did not impress me- it was kind of mushy, but i've never been a huge fan of the stuff anyway. i loved my entrée, though- the shrimp were spicy and perfectly cooked, the gouda grits were rich and creamy and the andouille-mushroom sauce on top of everything was super deliciously savory. i sopped up every. last. bite.

Food:
-Crawfishpupies: I found them really bland. Nothing more to say.
-Artichoke and Crab dip: Nothing stood out from this.
-Red Beans and Rice: Also very bland.
-Shrimp and Grits: This was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it, but it's not a dish that would have me coming back on my own accord.
-Bananas Foster Bread pudding: This was good. It wasn't what I ordered, but it was good.

Service: 
I understand if it's your first day as a server, but you should at least have a pen and pad on you at all times if not just to take notes. But also if your short term memory is really bad, and you know it is, a pen and pad would be really helpful so that you're not constantly running back and forth several times just trying to get the drink orders right. And why not just shadow the ""real server"" if you're just going to be relaying everything back to her and then mess it up or forget?

I also don't understand why service was so slow, especially with the speed our food came out. At the time we were the only people sitting on the patio, and it slowly started filling up, but we still had no food and we had an insane amount of empty cups on our table.

I had requested a bananas foster and a bread pudding to-go and was given a bananas foster bread pudding. I told the waitress that that wasn't what I ordered and she said, well that's what I was told what you ordered (from the first day as as server kid). I asked if the check reflected the two separate items and she replied, with attitude, that no, I have to fix the check now. I was already disappointed with the service and that the food didn't live up to the hype so I just wanted to get out of there and told the waitress that I'll just take the desert that I have now and she seemed shocked and said that it'll only take 4 minutes to get what I had originally wanted. I said no thank you, I will just take this desert and maybe your other server should carry a pen and pad with him. and she replied, with an attitude again, sorry it's his first day, but have a nice weekend.",QV9XCO5lpj1PbE5JGMONYA,3,0,2,gnrLLlLQkvqfEV5P9-uwaQ

3527295,2016-07-21,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I've been in Vegas for about 3 days.  My hotel in on the heart of the Strip.  Tons of places to eat, tons of places to go.  However, most of those places are crap as far as eating.  I went to Guy Fieri's for dinner and I can't decide which was better, that restaurant or the Denny's down the street.  Finally today, a friend of mine who is living here scooped me up and took me to Lola's.  

Exterior-wise, Lola's is nothing to look at.  It's in a commercial/industrial complex.  I thought it was a framing store at first.  The interior was a little better, but the Chandelier it ain't.  Very basic but clean decor.  I would call it industrial homestyle.  We got off to a bad start as the hostess asked us if we would be able to eat in about an hour and a fifteen minutes.  I was taken aback by that even though she asked very professionally and courteously.  They were having a private party soon.  The other issue that got us off to a bad start was that in the bathroom were about 4 floaters.  By no means the restaurant's fault, but that's not usually the image you want before you look at the menu.

So I forgot about that (until I started writing this) and glanced at the menu.  Andy was our server..  Andy was interesting because we had an odd back and forth about the difference a half-and-half, an Arnold Palmer, and a monsterade (or something like that).  According to Andy, an Arnold Palmer is unsweetened tea and a lemonade, a monsterade is sweet iced tea mixed with lemonade, and a half-and-half doesn't exist.  As a Baltimorean, this is absurd but I was more hungry than I was argumentative.  Before I begin on the food, I have a disclaimer to make.  I have a bizarre habit of almost never ordering seafood if I'm somewhere inland.  Lola's menu is predominantly seafood because of the Creole faire. I decided to roll the dice and ordered the shrimp and grits.  Here comes another disclaimer; whenever shrimp and grits is on the menu, I order it so that I can compare all of the shrimp and grits I've had.  My friend ordered the soft-shelled crabs.  Our food came out at hyper-speed with a lovely presentation.   My shrimp and grits was good.  In comparison to the other dishes I've had, it was good albeit a bit on the spicy side.  I love spicy, but it seems like the spiciness was masking the lack of other seasonings.  Still delicious though.  My friend DESTROYED his soft-shelled crabs so I assume they too were good.

3541934,2011-04-03,3,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Hot n juicy what? Crab corner who?  That's what u will be asking yourself after tasting Lola's crawfish. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned

So after we went zip lining at Freemont Street this afternoon, we were HONGRY...As we pass by a sign indicating that Lola's have Louisiana Style boiled crawfish, Friday and Saturday, I quickly yelped Lola's. Called and learned that 200lbs of live crawfish is flown in to be boiled for perfection. Sounds good to us so we made a U-turn.  

When we walked into this little restaurant, we immediately feel as if though we were somewhere in Louisiana.  The decor was mardi gras-ish.  We looked at the menu and saw that 5lbs of crawfish, w/potato and corn for $41.99.  That sounds pretty awesome but we played it safe and ordered 1lb to see if it meets our expectation prior to going for the big bang.  After 5 mins or so, our 1lb of crawfish along with a corn on the cob and a cute little potato came out.  We each grabbed a crawfish...it smelled right...snap off the tail and peeled off the shell, took a bite and WOW.  The meat was tender and juicy, was seasoned perfectly.  They were not drenched in oil and/or butter like the competition.  No need for any condiment.  Lola made it right.  We then quickly flagged our waiter down and politely asked if we may take advantage of the 5lbs deal by adding another 4lbs to the order.  He asked Lola and she was so awesome to allow it.  10 mins later, Lola brought out the 4lbs of crawfish to us herself.  She is such a wonderful and funny lady owner.  And, best of all, she knows how to make delicious crawfish.  

We also ordered a dozen wings with fries.  We liked them naked fried so we asked the waiter beforehand if they were battered fried or naked fried.  He responded that they are naked fried.  WRONG!  They came out battered fried.  BOOOOOO.  But the flavor was there so we let it go.  We learned that our waiter has only been there for 2 weeks so it's ok.  The crawfish was so tasty that it didn't matter.

To end this wonderful lunch at Lola's, we   ordered the bread pudding.  It was warm and moist, with a hint of Mr. Jim Bean secret concoction.  YUM.

It has been hard for us to find a place that makes crawfish like how we remembered it to be in the South.  All the other items on the menu looks delicious, but we can't find ourselves ordering anything other than crawfish!  As soon as crawfish season is over, we will delve into the other menu items, like the red bean and rice, jambalaya, and so many more...

In a nutshell very Friendly and upbeat staff.

I'd like to go back and try some other entrees to get a better cross section of good quality. But, I'll review what I had.

Apparently, it's pretty popular! everything I read mostly was all good. I've learned one thing over the years and that's popular doesn't always mean ""Great."" That said, Lola's is GOOD, but not GREAT overall n my opnion.

Crab Cakes were good. Nicely seasoned, nice size and decent texture. The little greens it came with were not that good. the Gumbo was OK... just OK. It was rich, dense and dark. Slightly smoky. was lacking real flavor compared what i have had in New Orleans not even close.

Now the Jambalaya reminds me of what you'd get in New Orleans to an extent. the flavor was on point and I would definitely order that again.The Shrimp were amazing in the Jambalaya. The pricing for the portion was not cool at all though lol.

All in all..... I would probably give it another chance and try other things on the menu like the Shrimp Creole for example. which I read was very good. It did not reach my expectations but the food was decent overall.",Ishvcor7iAYRMgCr1odT9Q,7,5,3,WYDhK-ha3tNxigWCuIhxpQ

The service was pleasant. We were well taken care of throughout the visit.

When you walk in it is very cozy and friendly. The staff is also a plus. 
We had the craw puppies and a crab cake for starters. Both were really good. The craw puppies are their take on a hush puppy but so much better. Little fried craw fish balls of delight. The crab cakes at this place are so good and might I add that Lola is very generous with the amounts of real crab meat. It came out on a bed of greens with aioli drizzled on the top.
For dinner, I tried the signature cat fish and grits and my friend had the blackened shrimp po-boy. The fish and grits were very good with pieces of sausage and mushroom in the sauce. My friend loved the po-boy and thought it was just the right size. The sweet potato fries were really good and even better with a side of the secret craw puppy dip.
We were so full but had to try dessert anyway. We share the bread pudding and bananas foster. BEST BREAD PUDDING I have ever eaten and I have tried a lot all over the country. It comes out nice and hot with a side of whipped cream. The bananas foster was a hit too. The presentation wasn't a five star but the taste was a ten.
After we finished and were ready to go, Lola herself came out to see us. I have to saw that I was shocked that the owner took time away from the kitchen to see how they did. She is a sweet lady and very hospitable covered in Saints gear.

I'm that girl that's willing to sit at a table by herself with her little bib, hiding behind pounds and pounds of those tiny little critters. So when I saw that there was an authentic southern creole restaurant that can be found in Vegas, I went nuts. Sadly, being from the South, it didn't live much to my expectations. 

I ordered the shrimp & grits and it wasn't everything I hoped it to be. Grits were a little bland, but grits in general are hard to make flavorful so I'm not too hard to judge on that. But overall, the dish was just okay. 

However, the one thing that will have me coming back again and again, is their fried oysters. So delish. It's a must try! .. But that's pretty much it. I've also ordered the crabcakes as a side item in the past and it's not my favorite, and something I wouldn't go for again. 

Business still seems to do well here so there must be something I'm missing. It's a small restaurant that can get pretty crowded quickly. A waiting area for a table is pretty much non-existent. My server was quite busy and wasn't very attentive. She was also helping another large table, so I'm not too fussy about the service. 

I still need to come back for the crawfish, but it's only served on Fridays, so it makes it a little difficult. Hopefully I can make a 3rd attempt at Lola's before the crawfish is out of season.

I noticed that Guy Fieri has featured a few Las Vegas places on Diner's Drive In's and Dives. Lola's was obviously one of them.

I actually ate the Roast Beef ""D Brees"" which is listed on the menu as also being the item Guy Fieri ate. I don't know what I was looking for in this sandwich, but I get the feeling Guy liked it more than I did. I'd order it again, but for reasons I can't explain, I just didn't taste the ""wow"" in the sandwich.

My wife, if I am not mistaken has a shrimp po' boy and she enjoyed it very much.

Again I watch too much of the Food Network.

Between entering Lola's, looking at the menu, and waiting for server to take our order, we of course looked around the establishment. Cute decor, I love to look for Guy's ""face"" in the diner's, drive-ins and dives that he has visited. But I also noticed a few nicks here and there on the walls. Obviously from tables and chairs hitting the walls.

Again I watch too much of the Food Network, because after I noticed the walls, I couldn't help but wonder what would Guy's friend Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible think of the chips in the walls?

We arrived within the first hour of business. By the time we left Lola's was impressively crowded.

Another part that bothered me is what is there for kids at Lola's. I noticed here on YELP that Lola's is listed as kid friendly. I wouldn't say no, and I wouldn't say yes to that. I didn't see a children's menu. I would only take my kids, if we could sit at one of the four patio tables.

Everyone told me ""you must get the shrimp and grits...""  what do I do?  I get the Shrimp and Grits and two other dishes...haha...sharing with my friends of course!  

Now I've been to New Orleans and I've have the authentic grits from the south, Grits in NOLA is still the best, but the shrimp and grits at Lola's comes PRETTY close to the grits down south!  So creamy and cheesy and perfectly paired with cajun spiced shrimp....amazing and fixed my craving for the time being!  If you are craving some shrimp and grits, Lola's is definitely the place to go to get that in Vegas!  

Another memorable dish I had here were the crawfish hush puppies or they like to call it the crawpupppies!  Very good, crunchy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside.  I think I ate like 3 of those delicious bite sized pieces of fried goodness!  

I wasn't a fan of the BBQ shrimp, and we also got a noodle dish that was pretty good (forgot the name). 

My other friend ordered the Gumbo, which tasted like gumbo.  It was good, and tasted authentic, but when it comes down to what was the best dish, The shrimp and grits won the challenge!

It was a nice little restaurant with a nice Louisiana / New Orleans atmosphere. I really liked showing up around then, the restaurant had a few others dining in it so overall it was a great quiet dinner with my girl. I ordered a ""Fat Tire"" beer and she ordered a Riesling, which was a very good wine. 

We Decided on an appetizer of ""Hot Crab and Artichoke Dip"" served with bagel chips was I thought at first lacking in seasoning, namely pepper, but I let it go and come to find and enjoy the subtly of the flavors we ended up really enjoying this dish.

For an entrée I ordered there ""Shrimp and Grits"" which were served with smoked Gouda grits and Andouille sausage and mushroom ragout. I have to admit I have never had better grits in my life and I like grits. Eating the grits with some shrimp and sausage all together gave a really great flavor. I used some of the toasted bread they serve to sop up the sauce... Nom Nommy Nom Noms!

My girlfriend ordered the ""Shrimp Étouffée"" which was also very tasty though I have to say we both loved the shrimp and grits better and she was very envious of my choice. My girlfriend happens to be a ""grits Nazi"" and she even said they were up there in her book. ~Grins~

To end the meal we shared ""Lola's Famous Bread Pudding"" and well... It must be this bread pudding rocked. I love bread pudding. It has a nice firm yet moist consistency through and through not like the stuff you get at casinos where the bottoms all soggy and scrambled at the same time. It came covered in a nice rum praline sauce that was just right. The bread pudding part of it had no raisins or chocolate etc... jammed into it, which it to speak for itself and we really enjoyed that.

The server was very nice and fast and it was really nice that the owner and chef ""Beth Pokorny"" (I looked her name up online) came out to ask us how our meals were and if we were enjoying ourselves. You just do not see this much these days.

Our bill was not bad for everything we enjoyed and overall I think we have a new favorite place in Las Vegas. We will definitely be going there again for my girl's birthday next month and if you have not tried Lola's I would sincerely recommend you give it a try.",8-OX2_HEYDbArnMSDyJe5g,1,1,5,w0nmZkSuuA0LM3QBhEYCHA

We tried the gumbo and the crab/artichoke dip to start, both were awesome!! I am usually not a fan of any kind of spinach/artichoke/cheesy mess of a dip, but this was AMAZING. It was full of crab meat and was seriously delicious.

They also have Abita beer which is a huge plus-it brings back crazy nights in New Orleans and it goes down great with the spicy food! 

We all had po'boys, blackened and fried shrimp and the roast beef one. The blackened shrimp was bomb-spicy but not overpowering ( I accidentally poured on too much habanero hot sauce but it was still delish) but if you don't like mayo-request for them to skip it.

The environment was ehh soso, kinda small & packed in.

First off the food was quite expensive for my taste. My husband had a Blackened Shrimp Poboy that was way to spicy for me to even try since he knows my threshold for spice. He however said he enjoyed his sandwhich, not to the extreme of the price that they charged for it. I ordered the fried catfish platter with my sides of green beans and greens. Never had I been so disappointed! I have never had to salt my food so much at a restraunt before. Both sides were boiled with bacon & I think that was it. NO FLAVOR!!!! The fried catfish in part was ehhh, ok. It was a tick cut of fish, oh did I mention you only get one filet!!! The breading was bland, had no seasoning in the cornmeal & when I got my food the entire bottom side of the fliet was SOGGY!!! nothing like eating a bland soggy piece of fish that had no flavor!

I had the shrimp and grits with sausage.  I can see why it is a Lola's favorite dish!  The grits tasted like they were made with cheese and sour cream and melted in my mouth.  The shrimp had great flavoring.  The sausage was not too rich and complimented the grits well.  I added a bit of Louisiana hot sauce and it was very delightful.

My wife had the crab cake dinner (she usually gets the crab cakes when she goes to Lola's).  The crab cakes were very tasty; the spices and meat were mixed well so one did not overpower the other.

Our dinners cost $13 and $16 dollars

My wife had the Abita light and I had the Abita Amber, from Abita Springs, LA.  We are now fans of Abita beer!  Oh, and the beers only cost $4.5, not bad for a microbrew while eating out.

My wife has raved about the Banana's foster for months; we skipped it tonight though to have more beer. 

I am a fan of Lola's; it is Tuesday night and my wife got the last table for two; the rest were reserved and that should tell you all something!",FPEDwrWxK-CPjlgJM8r3fQ,0,0,5,rTB3y3PnduUlMLz7HcoMIg

It is very small. The tables were very close to one another, I could have stolen a few sweet potato fries  from the couple sitting next to us :). Felt a little claustrophobic at first but every one was so nice, it felt homey after a while. 

Now to the food . We had the broiled oysters and a cup of gumbo for starters. They were both pretty good although I still prefer my oysters raw. The hubby could not stop raving about the gumbo, he was reluctant to even give me a little taste. It was good, a little too spicy for me. For our entrees, I had the shrimp and grits and he, the crab cake plate. The grits was oh-so-creamy, so so good and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. I loved every bite although I thought the sauce/gravy was a little salty and that is where the sweet tea comes in to save the day. The crab cakes were beautifully presented. It was good but nothing special. We were both pretty full but I refused to leave without trying the banana foster bread pudding even ifI had to be rolled out of there(haha). It was amazing! The hubby, who dislikes desserts ate more than I did.

Our total bill with 2 beers and sweet tea is $77+ . Kinda expensive but we can't complain. Everything was good, the food was good, the servers were very accommodating, love the vibe and they even give military discount.

The band definitely sets the ambiance for a nice moonlit dinner on the restaurant's outdoor patio.  It was quite warm, but a nice cold beer definitely fixed that factor.  The blues jazz band was amazing, and was a super plus to the environment, and the fabulous food.

For appetizers, the love and I had craw puppies and a dozen charbroiled oysters.  The craw puppeies is an awesome creation and is so good!  Crispy on the outside, and yummy on the inside.  Perfect sauce to go with it too.  The charbroiled oysters are really good too.  Just the right amount of flavor, and the right amount of cooking.  I will definitely order both the next time I come which is first Friday of October! :)

For entrees, my boyfriend had the Shrimp Jambalaya, and I had the famous Catfish and Grits.  OH-EM-GEE!  The super kind waitress told us that this was Lola's signature dish and my oh my she was NOT kidding.  I love fish, but this fish was so flavorful, and the bed of grits it lay on was perfect!  The sauce...amazing!  There were mushrooms and sausage that lay in the sauce too....perfect combination.  All together, it was an amazing dish!  If you come here, the Catfish and Grits is a definite must try.  My boyfriend's Shrimp Jambalaya was just as flavorful.  He enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed my dish.  

For dessert, we had the banana foster.  To admit, the presentation wasn't all that great, but it tasted wonderful.  I love bananas, so it was a defitnite cherry on top to my awesome dinner.  

We are definitely coming back again!  Great date night if eating on the patio, great place to get cozy with friends, or just come for really good food in a good vibe type atmosphere!  2 thumbs up Lola!!!! Love it!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,3,1,5,DurrxDQBULKn7j1g24AzZA

Dining here makes you feel like you are eating over at a friend's house.  It is ultra small and cramped and busy busy busy.  

Service was just fine but not great.  Our guy was definitely busy and it showed.  

Prices are fair.  Beers are cheap.  

I had the shrimp and grits.  Delicious!!  Six large shrimp and a pile of grits with bacon.  What more could you need? Oh yeah..cheese!  The grits are gouda grits.  Buttery, cheesy and yum yum yummy.  My husband said they were too cheesy.  I do not believe in such nonsense.  No such thing.  He was quite pleased with his grilled shrimp po boy and said he would order precisely the same thing when we return.  I also slyly nibbled my sisters jambalaya.  It was spicy and flavorful.  Very good.  I can't imagine there is any better Louisiana style cooking in Las Vegas.  

Maybe the best part of the meal was the delightful fig dessert.  The best way to describe it is a large homemade warm fig newton topped with ice cream.  I've never ad anything like it.  It was excellent!! My fellow diners were skeptical of ordering such a wild card but it was the favorite!

At first we were seated asked for our drink orders and shortly after we ordered our food but that is where the service ended. As we watched around us tables were getting bread it seemed at random and although we ordered entrees didn't see a crumb. It took 30 minutes for us to get our food and when we did it was cold. Not just the top of the food but all the way through like it had been sitting in a pot out back and they just slopped it on a plate. My husband had the Jambalya and it was cold all the way through, only the shrimp on top were hot. He said it had no flavor at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it too was cold like mushy paste with some hot shrimp on top. I liked the flavor but it was more like left overs I just got out of the fridge from the day before. 

My guess is they plated the rice and grits and forgot about it then 30 minutes later realized they didn't add the shrimp, topped it off and the waiter dumped it off on our table. If we were not on our way to a conference and hungry as all get out we would have complained and refused it. What made it worse is, no one came back to refill our drinks which were down to the ice the entire meal, the waiter just dropped off the food and walked off and we didn't see anyone again until we were done and ready to pay our check. 

It's a real shame because I had high hopes for this place. We love small mom & pop restaurants and this one unfortunately unless they shape up, train their staff and check their food quality before it leaves the kitchen will be seeing the doors close sooner than later.",4DYhXbD-ilOY8gEJ19KraQ,13,1,1,KXHcZznNu6bpieUr0aTY5w

However, the food was a real disappointment. The fried oysters were super fishy and the texture of the actual oysters was almost kinda crumbly. Weird, but I'll let that go because maybe all fried oysters are like that?? I had coleslaw on the side which seemed to just be shreds of cabbage with none of the mayonnaise-y sauce. Seriously none and I'm not even a big mayonnaise-y sauce fan. Maybe they made a mistake back in the kitchen when they were mixing up the coleslaw and forgot to put the rest of the ingredients in? Sweet potato fries were decent. My friend got the jambalaya, and it had a weird texture, too. I only had one bite of it, but she didn't have much more.
The prices are another strike - actually they're not bad at all for dinner, but I would have really appreciated a lunch special since we were there for lunch. It came out to over $20 each with our meal, a soda, and tip.
Overall, I'd give it 1 star, but I so want to love a local place downtown with a cute patio that I'm giving it 3 for now and hope to go back to try some of the other dishes (gumbo seems to be popular?).",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,0,3,YN8A4TWbbPyQYlK-em86Pw

This time I figured out the sexy salad I saw walking by my table on my last visit was a Caesar salad with blackened shrimp.  I also figured out that I was going to order something more exciting than a salad!  I had a the fried oyster po boy and my man had the blackened shrimp po boy.  My po boy was perfectly dressed and the oyster breading had a peppery kick.  Still liked the blackened shrimp best but glad I tried the fried oysters.  I had coleslaw and kept stealing fries.  Their fries are really good, but I found the coleslaw a little too creamy for my taste.  I like a little vinegar in slaw.

Since Lola's was on Triple D we decided to go after the lunch rush.  Triple D dives are notoriously busy after being aired.    
  
Lola's is a nice and quint place. The décor is purely Louisiana flair, all things New Orleans are on the walls and hanging from ceiling.  As you walk in there's a small two or three person bar on your right and the dining area straight ahead, which appears to seat about 25-30.  
  
There were a few people still seated from lunch and a couple arriving after we had been seated at our table.  Considering they had just finished lunch rush, the empty tables were clean and ready to be seated.  
  
The menu has all the standard New Orleans fair, as it was around lunch we settled on a Shrimp Po Boy and I had the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy.  
  
Our waiter was very attentive and friendly along with a waitress who wasn't busy at the time we sat down.  Between the two of them, we were very well taken care of without actually being hovered over.  
  
I love New Orleans' food.  I go to NOLA every chance I get, two or three times a year, mainly to just eat!  So when I say the Soft Shell Crab was every bit the Po Boy as those I've had in NOLA, I'm telling you the truth, Lola's takes you right back there!  My po boy was seasoned just right and the batter was light and crispy.  Better yet, the crab was fresh!  The crab was prepared properly, so all you could taste was the sweetness of the crab.  The Shrimp PB was also a wonderful surprise.  The shrimp were medium-sized, plump and sweet. Way more than could fit between the bread halves. Once again, very fresh and lightly breaded so you could enjoy the flavor of the shrimp.  
  
I didn't get the gumbo, but the couple at the table next to us did.  The gumbo looked and smelled delicious.  So next time, I will be getting some gumbo.  
  
The prices are very reasonable. Especially considering the freshness of the seafood and French bread which is flown in.

If you blink you may not see Lola's so look for the Holsum Design Center and you will see Lola's right in the center.

Do not let the industrial area fool you, there is REAL Cajun food in there and just like a crawfish, once you get past the shell you will find just straight up deliciousness inside.  The inside of Lola's is a cozy very inviting restaurant.  The staff brings authenticity to a Cajun atmosphere.  They are friendly and they LOVE the food.  

Our waiter asked my husband what he enjoyed most in food and helped him choose the BBQ shrimp dish.  I needed no assistance, as I listened to him speak with hubby,  the passion with which he described the dishes I knew to order one of the most difficult dishes to prepare on that menu, well at least to prepare it properly, the way a true Southern chef will.  It needs experience, patience and LOTS AND LOTS of love.  Lola's has this in spades so I ordered the Etouffee.

There are a few dishes I NEVER order out, like Moussaka, Lasagna and Etouffee.  These are dishes that personify their prospective ethinicities and are rarely worth eating in a commercial setting.  Well Lola's Etouffee is as good as it gets.  As soon as I took that first spoonful in my mouth I was transported back to New Orleans and their amazing cuisine.  The crawfish perfectly prepared, the sauce was spicy and the vegetables were chunky and fresh.  It is served with rice and a basket of freshly grilled bread.  The bread dipped into the sauce is amazing.  I skipped the rice and just used the bread because it tasted to wonderful together.

Hubby loved his BBQ Shrimp dish and devoured the entire dish before I was even halfway finished with mine.  He said the shrimp was also cooked perfectly and the sauce was fabulous.  He loved dipping the bread in his sauce too.  We also had crab cakes and crawfish puppies to start with, both were EXCELLENT.  I would go back for those crawfish puppies any day of the week.

Unfortunately we were stuffed and avoiding the sugars, so we did not indulge in the desserts, but I think we will have to make an exception next time and have some.

Side note for my doggy lovers, they do accept dogs on the patio as long as they are leashed and well behaved.  Also rumor has it they are opening a second location in Summerlin at the end of the summer.  I CAN'T WAIT, they will be oh so closer to us then.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,5,2,5,yZ0z0lLAAQ-7EZedipK7VQ

It's got a different more inviting feel. I can't tell you enough good things about my experiences with Lola's. I have celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, and date nights here. I spent a lot of time in the south as a young kid. When I dine at Lola's it takes me back to days of long past. The food will put a smile on your face until the last bite. My only small gripe is the beer selection on tap. But still I won't hold that against you.

It's a small place, so don't come with a party of 22 lol. Today it was just my husband and I. What this place lacks in size it more than makes up for with the amazing, flavorful and just delicious food. I have to tell you--I had the Shrimp Poorboy dressed with mayo & tartar with a serving of coleslaw and sweet tea. So flavorful and good! Wow! Party in my mouth--especially with the Crystal Louisiana hot sauce which complemented it so well. Don't use Tabasco sauce--use the Louisiana hot sauce--so much better for this dish. The breading on the shrimp was light and crispy, but not greasy at all. 
I think KeiKei B. was having an off day & maybe burnt her tongue before she came in or something because Lola's has awesome food. I was worried because of her bad review that the food wouldn't be flavorful but boy that was so wrong & way off base! I also tried some of my husband's bronzed shrimp and grits--oh my heaven! Such a rich burst of flavors! Grits had just the right bled of creamy & cheesy goodness. Sauce & sausage had s complex rich flavor that complemented the grits perfectly. The Bronzed shrimp was sooo good! Glad we shared so I could try both. You gotta try this--it's just YUMM.",NZ8jpEw9nuvIqjkG5oVb4w,0,0,5,Dp0_twSRRzX94utuduteAQ

Private parking here so no issues. They offer outdoor dinning but I was dinning solo and opted to sit in the bar area since they were quite busy that evening.

Started off with a bowl of NOLA gumbo which was full of yummy ingredients and had a kick to it which made my forehead break a sweat!  I followed with an entrée of crawfish entouffee which was delicious.  My friendly waitress suggested dessert and I didn't hesitate a second - chose the Fosters bread pudding which was topped with ice cream. It was awesome!

4142717,2013-04-26,4,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"So I was finally able to check out Lola's.  I grew up in New Orleans and still love the NOLA food, but it is hard to find good stuff out west.  I found out about this place from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on TV.  It looked good so I added it to my list.  It only took me a year to get down to Lola's, but I did finally get there!

We went for lunch and were pleased by the menu.  It offered a lot of yummy NOLA specialities and things I remembered from home, especially the Po Boys.  Let me tell you, nothing beats a good shrimp Po Boy in my book, so you know I ordered that!  We also got a catfish Po Boy, because that is the second best sandwich in the world, if I do say so.

Well the food came out and it was good, a little better than average, but didn't blow my socks off.  We ate everything on the plate, meaning our entire sandwich each and all of our fries, but were still a little hungry.  We didn't have time for dessert because we had a crazy 18 month old with us, so we didn't get to sample any of the desserts, which did look good, but not enough to deal with our crazy monkey.

It seems that for the price we paid for the sandwiches ($12 each) that we would have been full after eating every single scrap of food on them.  I know that Lola's imports their bread and seafood from NOLA, so I am sure that is why the prices are a little higher than I would expect, especially for Downtown.  I think it would be worth it if you got an extra piece of fish on each sandwich and maybe an extra piece of yummy Gulf shrimp to make the price a little more reasonable.  We actually were talking to a neighboring table a lot and they had the same comment about the price that we had and they had order entrees like red beans and rice and gumbo.  So the food was good, but a little high for what you actually get, in my opinion.

I would have given Lola's a 4 star easily, but our service was rather lackluster.  We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came over to us.  We had actually had more interaction from a server in the next section because my daughter, the crazy 18 month old mentioned above, was flirting with him and blowing him kisses.  I never get any attention from anyone unless she is around!  Anyway, if we had had him for a waiter, I think we would have had a better time, but our server was just swamped or something.  We hardly saw her and when we did, she seemed not to really care about us and just bothered with us.  I am not sure why because we are super nice and great tippers, oh well, her loss.

So we will probably give Lola's another shot next time we are Downtown and hopefully we get a better server.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,3,3,zefsPXoEnMXAOxGDAvavEA
4147121,2014-04-17,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"My first trip to New Orleans was with a group of co-workers for ones birthday.  Well, maybe not THE New Orleans.  We went to Lola's to celebrate over lunch.  I was excited to try it.  I have wanted to for quite some time but haven't really had the chance until now.  I tried a while back and was met with disappointment as on that particular day the parking lot had absolutely zero parking spots available.  Today was another story though.  There was parking and there were many seating options outside.  So the four of us were seated under the canopy just close enough to the entrance to barely hear the music playing over the sound of traffic on nearby Charleston Boulevard.  We were asked if we had a reservation but we did not.  It did not matter on this day as we were seated right away.  It took a few minutes for each of us to decide on our lunch for the day but once we did the waitress was right there and took our orders.  I chose the Mama's Red Beans and Rice.  I was asked if I wanted extra sausage but I turned that down.  In hindsight I perhaps should have considered the extra.  My very wide but somewhat shallow bowl of food showed up with only one piece of sausage resting on the scoop of rice.  The menu says it containes andouill and smoked sausage.  Something was missing from this equation.  Regardless, it was actually very good.  The beans were tender as could be.  The soupy sauce was well seasoned with just the slightest hint of spicey heat.  The bowl of coleslaw on the side was good with the cabbage and bell pepper liberally dressed creamy style.  But the stand out for me was the French bread served on the side.  It was buttered and grilled to the point I could see the marks from the grill grates.  This gave the bread a subtle smokiness not unlike a fresh grilled burger.  No doubt it was picking up the flavors of grilled meats past.  A small scoop of beans with the lovely ham hock meat on a bite of bread was just the way to go.  Overall I am happy with my first experience.  I wish I had been given more than one slice of sausage but as a co-worker pointed out to me, I ordered red beans and rice and that is what I received.  I acn say with relative certainty that I will be back at some time to try perhaps the sausage and chicken jambalaya.  Also, the desserts sound insane.  They have bread pudding.  They have bananas foster.  They even have a bananas foster bread pudding for those who can't decide.  I am in that group of restaurant goers.  I would order that in a heart beat.  Two of my favorite desserts rolled into one.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,1,4,CP5f-5IAwmkOEWOa5QAImw
4150816,2014-10-10,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"First off, I am not a real Cajun/Creole food fan as I find it on the salty, fatty or bland side. Lola's, overlooking ugly and busy Charleston Blvd in Las Vegas, is simple and quaint inside, however. This is definitely not a fancy place. With Party City Mardi Gras decorations and fleur de lis decor, it has a cheesy feeling of the bayou and the Creole music is somewhat charming. We ordered apps of grilled mussels, coated in some tasty buttery and slightly cheesy topping (good, but not drop you to your knees good), white baguette slices flame grilled and a green salad, it was a decent start. The dark beer on tap was really good though, making me happy. The blackened grilled chicken I ordered was fair, again, nothing too spectacular. The people we were with commented that they enjoyed their plates of red beans and sausage, crawfish and crab cakes. My hubby had jambalaya which he said was pretty good, but not a very big serving. He finished my chicken and French fries. Entrees come with 2 sides of your choosing; green salad (literally 6-7 pieces of lettuce, 7-8 pieces of teeny-tiny cucumber fragments and I think a sliver of tomato), red beans, coleslaw, or French fries. The desserts looked good, but we shared a Bananas Foster which actually was delish! The rum and brown sugar syrup over the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream was tasty! Service was good, waitress very nice, wish they'd turn the AC up for the Dear, she was sweating her butt off.

After a little bit of research we opted in ordering the Rockefeller oysters , cajun wings with sweet potato fries , blackened catfish and grits , bronzed shrimp & grits, and fig for dessert . Boy was I starving. 

Cajun wings w/sweet potato fries : They had an option for ""spiciness"" level from 5 to 10. 5 being mild and 10 being spicy . We  decided to go with 7. The wings were delicious. It was coated in a nice buffalo flavor. Next time I'd probably go with 8-9 level. Sweet potato fries were good as well. I was starving so I kept stuffing them in my mouth . 5/5

Rockefeller Oysters: Mmm charbroiled with Romano cheese and a lemon garlic butter marinade and it came out piping hot . Sprinkled on some lemon and they were exquisite. (Don't forget to dunk the garlic bread in the remainder of the sauce . 5/5

Bronzed Shrimp & Grits: The grits were nice and creamy. Although it was a little salty to my liking , the shrimps had a Nice Spice to them. I also enjoyed the sausage that was in the dish. 4/5

Blackened catfish and grits: If you like shrimp more then catfish then the shrimps and grits are a better option. The catfish was ok , but after a few bites I was already sick of the flavor . 3/5

Fig delight  : Ohhh my goddd. I experienced a foodgasm when I put a heaping mouthful of this delicious concoction in my mouth. From the butter pecan ice cream , to the caramel, to the figs infected in a light crust...my taste buds were jumping for joy. If you're planning to get dessert , this will definitely leave you satisfied. 5/5

Overall, this place was a great option for a taste of New Orleans. Service was also really good . Would probably stop by again if I'm in the mood for Cajun food when I'm back in Vegas .",BGL5TiRzYp8BG-LvFuxv5Q,2,4,4,nbg0LFJ0prKGk_C-c9MAdw

I had the crab cakes and they were excellent. All crab and no filler with Cajun spices and a good sear. It also comes with tons of salad and a delicious aoli/dressing. 

My mom had the cat fish and wouldn't share but I gotta taste of her crab cakes and they were so creamy and delicious. I could've eaten a whole plate. 

Although it took a while to get the food, it was totally worth it, and the service was very good. Especially since they let us in after their official last seating.

The crab cakes were fine...standard fare...nothing special.  The soft shell crab was OK, and went nicely with the cole slaw....but it was not anything special.  The étouffée was really disappointing.  The roué was weak, the spicing was weak, the flavor was not well developed.  In short, it really let me down.

I went here for a late dinner. The location is a bit hidden. It's a hard place to spot since most eyes look to the Holsum Bread factory when driving by. The entire place has this sort of local groove that I feel in the atmosphere. The entrance is left open to the patio, with a clear view of the downtown lights in sight. Sets a real good casual mood to accompany the meal.

I ended up ordering the bronzed catfish and grits, while the person I was with ordered the crab cake dinner. Portions are definitely not as heavy as you'd expect from Cajun food, to which I'm used to getting immense servings. I guess the focus is more reliant on quality than on quantity; which was definitely shown here.

-Bronzed catfish & grits: I absolutely loved this meal. The catfish in itself very tender, succulent and flavorful. The grits that accompanied the fish were outstanding. They were made with a smoked gouda cheese, which added an awesome twist to usual grits that I'm used to. I could see me coming back here just for this dish. The meal left me trying to clean my plate off with my spoon to get every drop out of it.

-Crab cake dinner: These crab cakes are served on top of some greens. Seemed more like a salad type of deal. After I swooped in to steal a sample from my brother's plate, I noticed a unique sweet flavor to the crab cakes.  Also worth noting is that these cakes are very crab heavy. They don't skimp you in the amount of crab they put into each cake. This looked like a very light dish though. Not something I would order if I was hungry.

-Bananas Foster: I wasn't a huge fan of this dessert. It didn't really stand out to me. I should have ordered the bread pudding, like most people recommended on here.

When you walk in, the restaurant is small and the seating is close together. Honestly, it's like going to grandma or moms on Sunday for dinner, so I didn't mind the set up at all. For appetizers, we started with the Crawpuppies, hushpuppies that has crawfish mixed in. OH LORD, were these amazing. I wish there was more than 4 per order, but it's still something I'd recommended. For dinner, I ordered the Étouffée with shrimp and Steven ordered the Combo Plate with cheesy grits and greens. As y'all will see in my pictures, I definitely enjoyed my dish. It has a nice spice and creamy texture and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I've never had grits so Steven let me try his and my life hasn't been the same since. These grits are made with Gouda which provided a rich flavor to the grits that we both loved.

Hooks for purses at the bar. Alleluia! A woman must own this joint! ;) (those of you that don't know, Lola IS a woman, lol). 

I just took my medication so if this review is all over the place, you now know why, ha! My favorite part of the meal was the shrimp and grits. Grits were creamy with a smooth texture that complimented the shrimps that sat on top of them. I was pretty disappointed on the shrimp to grits ratio, I would've rather have had more grits on my plate. 

Our last visit was quite a disappointment, we had sandwiches that tasted quite disgusting, I forget what it was called, garbage or something, and really, that's what it tasted like. The last time that I had the étouffée it tasted a little burnt and wasn't much of a fan but this last visit changed my mind on a lot of things, for the good :)

The shrimp were the star of the show for my meal, they were seasoned beautifully and tasted great. However, the grits were a huge disappointment, I ordered this plate for the grits especially and they were caked in some overly creamy and slightly tarte cheese that made them incredibly hard to enjoy on there own. The sausage around the grits were boring but helped the flavor of the grits when eaten together. We had sides of greens which were dry and incredibly tarte. The potato salad was simply okay.

Sometimes I get homesick and need some good eats to get me through. I think I just found my spot. Lola's is centrally located at I-15 & Charleston. Plenty of parking around the side. Not very many tables, and the place was full. Our waiter's name was Brennan. He is not from Louisiana, but he has eaten at Brennan's in New Orleans. The smells had my mouth watering while we were deciding what to order. My girlfriend and I ordered a large bowl of gumbo and a large bowl of Shrimp étouffée. Presentation was pleasant. Gumbo had okra. I prefer filet gumbo. After discussing the differences with Brennan, he brought out some filet powder for me. Nice touch. I added a little for taste hoping not to make it too thick. It smelled like sassafras.  Both dishes were really good. The gumbo had some odd taste that I could not place. Perhaps it was the sausage. I don't think they use andouille. Étouffée is not my favorite but this étouffée tasted like the gumbo I was hoping for, and it had five huge shrimp. Between these two dishes I would recommend the étouffée. Forget the name and imagine it is gumbo. We watched other people's food. Next time we will try the shrimp and grits and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was red like New Orleans style (not like momma makes it). We were full but ordered banana foster for dessert anyway. It came with vanilla bean ice cream. It was light and airy. I was hoping more for thick and rich, but it was pretty good. Even had some small vanilla flakes. The bananas were just right. The brown sugar butter was runny and alcohol was overpowering. I enjoyed it, but will probably try the bread pudding instead next time. Two big bowls and a dessert came to just shy of $40. A bit pricey, but worth a little piece of home.

I'm a southern Californian who is a self-proclaimed foodie. I refuse to eat bad food.  I'd rather starve.

We came here after picking up a couple of friends from the airport.  It was roughly 3:30 by the time we arrived in the PM, and we were all STARVING.

I was good; I ordered a blackened catfish with some sides.  All my other friends ordered ALL kinds of stuff.

What I love about this place:

1.  I know this is weird, but I love the fact it was small and crowded. Very divey.  When you think Vegas, you think ambiance and to me, it's just too snooty.  I love that this place is totally anti-Vegas.

2. THE GRITS.  Whatever you do, get the grits as a side.  Among our company was a young lady who went through her undergrad in NOLA, and she said those grits are NOTHING like anything she had back in the South - THEY WERE BETTER.

3.  I just remember everything tasting great.  Seriously, just GREAT.

What I didn't love about this place:

4.  Well, it's definitely OFF the strip.  You have to really be looking to get to a place like this.  Doesn't seem to hurt their business, though!  ;)

5.  It is NOT ideal for a big group.  This is a great place for maybe 4-5 people tops.  We had 5 with us and I felt very caged in here.  It's a double edge sword.  On the day we went, I didn't mind it.  If I was in any more of a bad mood, it would not be cool with me.

6.  The fried platter was a bit bland.  My friend ordered that and I literally ate almost all of it.  I was really hungry and she wasn't even though she ordered this huge plate!  Ha!  It was a'right, but nothing spectacular.  It carries with it a higher price tag, too, considering how much seafood you're getting in there (that's fair, I suppose).

It was a no for us. When it came time to order, my mother got the catfish platter with the greens and French fries, I got the platter  (catfish, shrimp, fried oysters and a crab cake) with green beans and French fries and I got my daughter the chicken strips and French fries. The catfish and shrimp were amazing! So good. The oysters, French fries and greens were salty. Like overly salty. My crab cake was good too. A bit spicy and I loved it. But the highlight had to be the green beans. They were seasoned perfectly and had tons of bacon. Oh and my daughter gobbled her chicken strips.

4484325,2010-03-26,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Lola's is a friendly little Louisiana kitchen that resides in the old Holsum bread factory off the 95 and Charleston. My husband and I and I eagerly anticipated dining at this restaurant long before it opened since it is close to home and we were regulars at the restaurants of the two previous occupants, The Grill (miss those salads) and Bistro Divino (miss those pine nut cookies). I hope the third time is a charm for this location since Vegas is missing good Southern cuisine and because the owner, Lola (AKA Beth), is as sweet as the splendid sugary yams you may have the privilege of enjoying if she happens to have some on hand or if you specially order them.

I think this was our 8th or 9th time dining here since it opened last year, and although everything is pretty good, we tend to stick with our favorites. To start we had the craw puppies ($5.99), deep fried morsels of crawfish and cornmeal batter served with an addictively spicy aoli. These are a wonderful way to start the meal and a unique creation of this particular restaurant. For my entree I ordered the shrimp remoulade salad ($8.99), which is the simplest and healthiest dish on the menu, but perhaps also the most underrated. It consists of plenty of perfectly poached shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce, accompanied by tomatoes, quartered hard-boiled egg, and lemon wedges (be sure to squeeze them over the shrimp for the proper acidic component). The remoulade dressing made with whole grain mustard and mayonnaise really makes the dish stand out, and the salad is a refreshing antidote to the heavier items that pervade the menu. Ian got the bronzed catfish with grits ($14.99), that he always opts to have blackened rather than the aforementioned bronzed preparation. It is wonderful when you can have catfish that actually tastes good, and Lola's does an excellent job. Ian tends to douse it in the Louisiana Gold hot sauce (the real deal), but it is certainly delicious on its own. The plate hits on all cylinders, and the only change that could be made would be the addition of a bit more cheese in the grits to add some saltiness.

Even though I didn't get it this time, I would also suggest the rich and flavorful gumbo, properly prepared with a dark roux and plenty of sausage and seafood. It's a cup of Southern goodness, though you might want to ask for it extra hot since sometimes is doesn't come out the way I personally prefer which is best described as ""burn the roof of your mouth off hot."" The baked oyster appetizer is another hit, and please don't forget to ask about those caramelized and gooey yams to round out the meal. The Purple Haze Abita beer ($4.25) is also a must to complete the experience. On the downside, I haven't been too impressed with the po-boys as they are heavy on the bread and the steak wasn't too well-received by Ian's best friend and fellow chef Jason. Boiled crawfish are now temporarily offered on the menu, however, which I anticipate will be terrific and look forward to trying next time so I can compare them to Hot n' Juicy Crawish.

It is evident from your first visit that Lola's serves up authentic Louisiana fare prepared with love and a genuine desire to make bellies happy. Although the food is not as refined as that of the late Commander's Palace where Ian used to work, you can certainly imagine it coming out of your grandmother's fragrant kitchen, should she happen to be from New Orleans. The yummy food, homey atmosphere of the restaurant, and Beth's smiling face keep us coming back time and again, and I hope we don't see any more restaurants in this space.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,2,4,IuCgedLCN-YgKmapCua5fQ

So I called on Wednesday and made a reservation for 4pm Saturday.  We got there early because we were done at the outlet and I was hoping they could just get us in.  Well, thank goodness that it was not crowded at that time because there was no reservation for me.....
The place is SMALL.  The tables remind me of something in the south set up in someone's grandma's basement.  Not restaurant style at all. Out table was actually a little wobbly.  But who cares, bring on the Nola food!
The food is pretty good.  I was a lil piglet and wanted to try everything.
First to start we ordered fries, garlic bread and the soft shell crab as an appetizer.  The soft shell crab was EXTREMELY small but whoever it was that brought it to our table (chef, manager, not sure) noticed how tiny it was and said that he apologized for the size and can either get us another one or let us have that one and take it off of the bill.  We'll take option #2 please considering we had never had it before and just wanted to taste it.  It was very tasty.  The fries were fresh cut and tasted amazing!!!
For dinner we ordered the Combo Platter which consisted of catfish, fried oysters, shrimp and a crab cake with sides of red beans and rice and side salad.  I ordered the Chicken with sides of Low Country Greens and Gouda Grits. Ed said the combo platter was tasty but the oysters were extremely fishy.  But the red beans and rice...to die for.  I don't like beans and wanted to order my own side of them.  They were amazing. 
My chicken was very bland, no flavor at all.  NONE.  But the Gouda Grits....OMG!  The best grits Ive had EVER!  I couldve eaten those with some turkey sausage and called it a day.  The greens were pretty good also.

Location, exit 15 north turn right on charleston it's going to be a street light and you're going to go through it and quickly turn right up towards a sign that says something about Italian bread in neon lights. It's before the next bridge. Hard to find the first time, too easy after that. 

The ambiance: pleasant, they have some metal tables out front with lights that would be fun to sit at on a spring vegas night. They view is of charleston street (a 4 lane street), but still nice to be outside. Inside is a tight squeeze. We were placed on a tiny high top table in the bar area. At first I was super bummed, but it ended up being fine since the waitress had to walk past us everytime to get bread for the other tables...so the service was very responsive. 

The food. 
Obviously the blackened shrimp and grits (15.99) is the best. Just look at the photos. They have truly sailed in that sauce that it is just delicious! Shrimp is a little over cooked if that bothers you, I would recommend the blackened cat fish it has less of the over cooked texture. 

The gumbo (12.49) is ok, they say it comes with shrimp but I spotted 2 tiny ones for my whole bowl...rest of it is sausage and okra. I will try something else next time. Probably just 2 blackened shrimp (hehe)",wdDLGg9IZ9_tafvKQ7qShg,1,1,4,_gjF1WZQQplHpacIRdAwgA

We ordered a shrimp appetizer, crab cakes, and of course the Corned Beef Special.  Lets start with the Cajun style food, the shrimp dish was true to the Cajun style of spicy but was really good.  The Crab Cakes, WOW, the best I have ever had.  With all that being said there was no way the corned beef could not be good and it was better then good it was GREAT....very tender and tasty and really ranked among the best we have had.

She explained that it came from a pot.... (no kidding)  So my inner ""Colombo"" deduces that it sat under a heat lamp.  If you buy the gumbo & select shrimp, you get 3 of them.   Oh Boy, for $11-$12.99 you can get 3 shrimp on top of a heat lamp-ed dish of gumbo, Id rather stay home & eat zatarains.

Then for lunch I ordered the shrimp creole which was absolutely nothing special although the shrimp were cooked absolutely perfectly.  The shrimp creole was $16.99 and only came with 5 shrimp!!! Seriously I'm only getting 5 shrimp for 17 dollars you have got to be kidding me! I wouldn't have minded if the dish was mind blowing or if it was something that I had absolutely zero chance of replicating at home but that just simply isn't true.

Every single dish here just feels so authentic and flavorful. From the catfish and the jambalaya to the gouda grits and the grilled shrimp, each item is memorably different from the rest of the food around and other Cajun restaurants to which we've been. It doesn't feel like the flavors are from a seasoning thrown at the end (the way places call French fries with some old bay seasoning on top Cajun fries). Instead, each dish is naturally and purposefully infused with different notes of heat and spice.

For me, the joy of this restaurant comes in the form of the shrimp Charlotte. I've never had a pasta like it, where the flavor and pasta are one in the same and no sauce at all is needed. And the shrimp are grilled perfectly. It's a dish that is intriguing all the way through and with each bite, you wonder how they accomplish so much with just angel hair pasta and if you could somehow figure it out and make something just half as good  because that would be a success.

Now, it can't be just any ol soul food, but I told them it had really good reviews. In the car we go and head there. Woops, it's so quick off the freeway we missed it! Take the streets and try again, a little slower this time and we found it. 

This place is literally a hole in the wall-so small. But those are usually the best ones. We were seated, read over the menu with Michael Jackson playing in the background, so singing and reading. They have a good variety on their menu, greens, potato salad, coleslaw, etc.  However, I did not see mac and cheese. I was a little bummed, but knew I would find something else. I ordered the catfish with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. Some others got the same, and 2 ordered the catfish Po-boy. Now I wait for the food to arrive, and hope it's to their liking. Reputation is on the line. Food comes out and set on the table. I take a bite of mine, delicious. I can't have catfish without dousing it in hot sauce, but it was good. The greens and sweet potato fries were done just right. I love a crispy sweet potato fry. 

Now, 1 of the 2 was picky about her soul food and when she took a bite, I just looked at her, hoping good news was to follow. She took another bite and said, ""Ok this is pretty good. I like the way they fry their catfish."" Wahoo!  Do a little dance. I was happy she enjoyed her food, and that I could enjoy mine too, cause it was delicious.

The gumbo was horrid! It was a disgrace to even title it as such! My boyfriend who has been going there for years even said it didn't taste how it use to. The issue began when we told the server that we didn't like the taste and would like it to be sent back and taken off of our tab. They refused and stated it was against policy. Our server sent over a wannabe manager to repeat the same thing. She stated that if I were to say gumbo were too spicy then she would be able to take it off of the bill. I'm thinking to myself ""what difference does that make??!"" After my boyfriend and her went back a forth for awhile, she then admitted that the gumbo had been changed a couple of weeks ago. Which should had been a green light the gumbo to be refunded. Still no budging! So I interjected and suggested that we replace our gumbo for something else. In which they did with no problem.

Our waitress was nice and attentive, but the curtain to the kitchen was open while we dined, and we were treated to competing radios. The dining room had some nice easy-going music that matched the theme, but the young kitchen staff was blasting some heavy metal and goofing around loudly. I wouldn't mind if I paid ten bucks for my meal at a food court, but when you're charged $15 for a small sandwich, you don't want to feel like you're intruding on a staff party.

I have to say , I am not a huge purveyor of Southern cooking, however, after reading yelper Michelle W review of the place, figured we had to give it a shot.  Had clients in town from Italy and France and one of my colleagues wanted to try Rhythm Kitchen and so I suggested Lola's.

1.  Quaint - When you are traipsing around the Charleston area, me thinks the last thing you are going to think about is quaint, cute, cool.  This place is all that and has character. Small, few tables, small bar, and it has just enough of whatever it is to make it just right.

2.  Service - Dominic was there when we entered waiting for our guests. Very nice, knowledgeable, gave us the scoop on the wine he preferred and also on the food.  They set up our table nicely and when we had to add one more, they were very accommodating. We had a party of 9 in here and they took care of us.  I think the place serves 20-25 total?

3.  Food - I was looking to give our out of towners a unique experience to try something uniquely American.  So this is the place we chose.  

Crab Cakes and Craw Puppies - The crab cakes were very substantial, flaky, moist and tender. I enjoyed it.  It was one per order, however, as they are decent size, we asked for each to be cut in two pieces and we ordered enough to share. Ordered craw puppies for the table, never having this before.  Deep fried seafood is the best I can describe this.  Not greasy and bite size tasty bits of seafood. Nice.  Each is the size of a small meatball, 5 per order, so we split two orders.  

Jambalaya - to me, the right blend of spice, rice, seafood. I also ordered the shrimp as an addition and it was just right. Juicy and hits the spot.

Salmon and Sweet potato fries - I think this was the only let down.  The fries had such great flavor yet the salmon was very dry  Dry fish is not too bueno, so this was  of a downer.

Gumbo -Seafood soup like bouillabaisse or cioppino.  I did not have it but one of our friends did. It looked really, really good.

Etoufee - I thought this was something a bald buy wore as he got older?  Perhaps I will need one soon.  Naw, this is a dish similar to the gumbo, just that it is thicker and more like a stew. Whereas the gumbo has seafood, this one here has either shrimp or something else, was the choice, but it was not  mixed like the gumbo.  Now I did not order this, but man did my friend enjoy it. Very nice.

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie a la mode with ice cream - YOu have to come for the desserts.  This is what the wifey and I ordered, and it was really great. I am going to go back for their Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Don't be shy, order the dessert!!!

GK says, check this place out for sure! I enjoyed it as a unique dining place. Not sure if it is a frequent place for me yet, however, I am going back for other desserts, so I will let you all know.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,8,5,4,vPHZvQDM_zc7y7cs6UAxog

1st visit: saw it on Triple D w Guy Fieri just before I flew out here so had to give it a try. 
Lunch: gumbo was good, nice flavors but more sausage and less seafood than I would have liked, excellent garlic bread served with it.
Po'Boy, 1/2 fried oysters, 1/2 fried shrimp: nice size, good flavors, good bread. Sweet tea delicious, freshly made, looking forward to next visit - 4 stars.
2nd visit: Disappointing! Ordered the grilled oysters, they were as small as clams, mentioned it to the waitress but no response, no mgr checked on me, think the complaint died w waitress, way overpriced for 1/2 doz grilled oysters that was the equivalent of 2 decent size oysters. 
Ordered the crab cake, picture shows white lump meat but reality was brown crab mush (shredded crab mixed w spices). 1 1/2 stars.",TWR15IRIM2BNDO7Q6GvK6Q,2,0,3,E22WBuk58ScVL1AYLB0hoA

Service was very good despite the crowded house.  I also had an unusual side of cole slaw, can't remember what it was called but it was so good.
The sandwich came and I told the waitress that it should be called the ""we don't skimp on the shrimp"" po boy.  The shrimp was falling out of the roll.  It was good, but not great.  I felt it lacked a little seasoning or spicyness.

This place is smothered with all things N.O. Saints, if that works for you. The bar is small, only 6-7 bar stools.  Everyone in here seemed to be a local.

Got the crab dip to start.  This is a fine version of a dip, nothing special.  My wife had the crabcakes.  You get 2 large cakes with the meal, but they are on a bed of greens.  This destroys the purpose, in our estimation, of getting that good crispy exterior, because the lettuce makes the bottoms of the cakes soggy.

The restaurant is pretty intimate and by ""intimate"" I mean cramped. Anyway, I ordered the crab cake dinner but as soon as I saw it I was already a little disappointed. Judging by the looks I could tell it was mostly breading. The inside tasted fishy and was not appetizing at all. The order comes with 2 cakes but one was burnt on one side, leaving a very bitter taste. Of course they served it with the burnt side down thinking I wouldn't notice. It was inedible to me. In fact, most of the plates came out over cooked and over fried (not just blackened or charred).

The décor is cute. This is a really tiny hole in the wall, Louisiana themed. I was told by a friend their other location is noticeably bigger. 

My friend ordered the garlic bread and crab & artichoke dip for an appetizer. The bread was really tasty, and I only had one bite of the crab dip, but I would definitely order some for myself next time. I had been eyeing the crawpuppies on the menu, but didn't order them right away. I saw someone else at the table had, so I did eventually order them. They were really good! There is a tiny hint of spice, and they were soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside. Yum. 

I ordered the crab cake dinner for my meal. It's two crab cakes on top of lettuce with some sort of dressing. It was in the shape of two ""Ls"". Pretty basic. They were tasty, but could have used something else. Not sure what. It didn't come with anything, so I ordered a side of coleslaw, since I love coleslaw. The coleslaw was pretty good. 

My friend ordered the crawfish. He is from Louisiana, and he said it reminded him of home. He ate the whole 2 pounds! It came with 2 potatoes and 2 pieces of corn. It smelled really flavorful. 

I'm not sure why other reviews say the servers are creepy. We had a really nice lady with a broken foot, and she still kicked ass. I liked this place!",64WaWNeYSmN45a1MdiFv5w,1,0,5,NmMA1sWFNw5s6ix1IF3Azg
4990767,2016-06-04,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Preface:  My wife is originally from LA. So when we travel and I come across a Cajun or Creole restaurant on Yelp, regardless of the ratings she always says ""look for someone who is from the south and read their review.""  

We got lost finding the place, even with GPS.  Coming south on Charleston be ready to turn right as soon as you cross the freeway.  We missed it and because of construction ended up running around for fifteen minutes trying to get back to the restaurant.  I'm glad we did.

The atmosphere is amazing.  My wife said, ""Now this is a New Orleans style kitchen"" as soon as she walked in the door and smelled the food and saw the New Orlean Saints Super Bowl banner plastered on the wall.

We had made a reservation through Yelp, we were very quickly seated even though we were early.  The service the whole visit was exceptional.  Our cups never ran dry and our server was great at helping us decide on appetizers and my wife's dessert.

We both ended up getting the D'Brees sandwhich we both had ours dressed a little different but from the first bite to the last it was good food.  My wife made many comments about how it reminded her of home in Louisiana.  I should mention my wife's pregnant and when she finished her sandwhich and saw the dessert menu the first thing out of her mouth was and I seriously quote, ""It's a good thing I wore my Maternity Pants.""

She ordered a Banana Pudding which came out in a large bowl with a broule'd marshmellow topping.  She pouted when she finished it.

We plan to return again probably during this same trip here in Vegas.  If your looking for great food, amazing service, and a reasonable price this is the place to stop.  It's a very close quick drive from downtown Vegas.",m-kzKybwiWDhxQWzhXT-dQ,2,0,5,v4QeZxFAl3psrf_TdmekJw

Thank goodness we made reservations cause the place got packed quick and we got the biggest table there.  For starters we all got the craw puppies to share. It was small morsels of tasty crawfish. Crawfish flavor wasn't powerful but you can taste a hint of it. Don't smother it with too much sauce or else that's all you'll taste. Our table got an assortment of things, but I ended up getting the catfish with Gouda grits. I was debating between that and the Shrimp creole. Upon the waitress's recommendation, I went with the catfish. The food came at a relatively slow place. But the kitchen was small and we were the biggest party in the restaurant. My dish was good... The grits are not overwhelming cheesy and the catfish was nice and tender. The dish lacked some texture though. Everything was mushy. Also it lacked some herby freshness... You know when the dish is getting kind of salty and you want something vegetably or herby to cleanse the palate?  It was good but I should have known that this would be a heavy dish. It came with the best toasted bread though. I love the toasted bread with olive oil. My friend got the jumbalaya with shrimp and I really liked his dish. It was spicy and sweet. However I didn't think the shrimp upgrade was worth it. They charge you 4 bucks more for 3 shrimp on top. I also got to try the smoked chicken. It was very moist but I wouldn't order that at a Cajun restaurant. We also shared the sweet potato pecan pie and bananas fosters. Was a little disappointed they don't have beignets. The sweet potato pecan pie was not that amazing. It's like regular pecan pie with a layer of sweet potato. I think you can imagine the flavor. The banana fosters bread pudding was like pure Carmel and brown sugar. I can feel the grittiness of the clumps of sugar in my mouth. Thank god we shared and everyone only had to eat a bite.

Let me start by saying that the location could be better.  It's on a very weird intersection on Charleston and in the middle of an awkward strip mall-ish building.  I didn't really get it.  Also, thank goodness we made reservations...there were two tables in the entire restaurant (I'm being fecitious).  All in all, the place offers a very cozy, intimate and homely setting.  We were even greeted by Lola Beth herself.  What a treat!  I must add though that it was hard to say that she was completely welcoming.  Our first impression was that she was a nice lady, however, when talking with her at our table later in the evening, her facial expressions really wasn't as welcoming as we thought.

We decided to order a bunch of items on the menu so that we could put the accolades to the test.  Here's what I tasted:

Crab Cakes- Loved these cakes.  A lot of lump crab meat and not a lot of filler.  The way a crab cake should be.  I loved fact that it sat on a bed of greens and was accompanied with a lemon aioli.  Fantastic combination.  My only criticism is that it was about 6 dollars and included only one cake.  For four people, we ended up getting two orders.  I little pricy in my opinion, but I would pay for that again.

Craw Puppies- To me, I didn't think this appetizer was memorable.  Not something I would choose to order again.  I'm a huge fan of crawfish, but not a fan of hush puppies, so the combination of the two did work for me.  The remoulade did help bring the dish together in the end.

Catfish Po Boy-  I thought this was an excellent choice.  For dinner, I wasn't looking to eat or spend a lot.  Great choice.  For about 11 dollars, I enjoyed a great sandwich.  The bread was grilled nicely.  It wasn't hard or soft where it would become soggy with the lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  It was perfect.  What sealed the dish for me was the side of fries I had.  Super crispy and super homeade, which made it that much more better.

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie- We did decide to add chantilly cream and that was what made this dessert good. I'm not a fan of pecans. Because of that, I didn't really find myself going back for more.  My hope was that the chantilly cream would help mask the taste of the pecans, but unfortunately, it did not.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding- Now with bread pudding, I am a HUGE fan. This dessert did NOT disappoint.  SOOOO delicious.  I found myself fighting for the last bit of bread pudding with my friends.  The run praline sauce was superb and although it wasn't offered on the menu, our server was nice enough to suggest also adding the chantilly cream on this dessert.  Such a fantastic combination!

Bananas Foster- Although I didn't admit this to my friends at the time, I had never tried bananas foster before.  This was an ""AH-MAZE-ING"" first experience.  C'mon!  Brown sugar coated bananas with vanilla bean ice cream.  How could you go wrong!  Each spoonful presented a new pleasant feeling that just ended the evening with a positive experience.  What a great dessert!

All in all, I'd say I had a great time.  I was accompanied with three wonderful friends and discovered a ""dive-type"" restaurant that offered, for the most part, wonderful Cajun Connections, as their website states.  Being a fan of southern cooking, I will not be opposed returning to try other menu items and of course, Lola's famous bread pudding!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,1,3,d0-Gc4N_A2nshvD8vpEn7w

I have a hard time passing up gumbo if it's on the menu, so that is what I ordered here. Although it was made from a darker roux than I have previously had, it was still delicious with a lot of andouille in the mix. I also got a taste of the grilled salmon and fried catfish and found them to be very good. 

Dessert-wise, I can say with all honesty that the Jack Daniels praline sauce that comes with the bread pudding is one of the tastiest confections I have ever had and if I had not been in public and surrounded by 7 of my closest friends and 30 strangers, I would have probably drank the rest of it and licked the plate clean. 

The jambalaya also looked very appetizing and the po' boys menu has piqued my curiosity. I will be returning in the future that's for sure.

Just a word of warning though, Lola's has a higher-end/gourmet style of presentation so if the only experience you have with Cajun/Creole is the pan roasts at Big Al's, you may find the portions to be a bit lighter than what you're used to. However, you will be more than compensated by the quality of the food, ambiance of the restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff.",sVGPIe1iSP8J1USyQU2soA,2,0,4,-k8I0i2pJAhqKrA6c8j1mA

This find was an absolute bomb idea, and I have to thank my yelppies for directing me to it.  This place is in the outskirts of Downtown Vegas, I would like to say a corner of the industrial district but I don't know the location to well.  It only took us 13 minutes to get there.

They open at 11 and already several people were waiting. That's a good sign!  The closed signed turned to open and everyone stood up.

Inside filled of every thing NOLA is about, colors of black, purple, green, yellow, gold, Saints banners, feathers, beads. So if you are really against the NOLA Saints, then go elsewhere but you'll be seriously missing out. The menu has a decent amount of selections.  I was at NOLA this past April and sort of knew what I wanted to try. Pitting NOLA food to Vegas.   I ordered the blackened catfish and grits, my husband ordered the Roast Beef Da Breeze (in the PoBoy section). I also ordered a side of red beans and rice, and 1-crab cake patty.

The food came out fairly quickly, they put my meal in front of me and I was already salivating. I couldn't wait and had a spoon full of the sauce. At first I thought it was rather salty and it took down my excitement down a notch. But as I mixed the sauce with the grits it was perfect! The grits were cheesy but without the sauce, it was missing its seasoning. Combine the two it sings in perfect harmony. Seriously, I enjoyed every bite. I thought, DAM just like NOLAs.  It was so good. I took the rest back to the hotel to eat (even though they didn't have a microwave, I was willing to eat it cold). My husband's PoBoy looked appetizing, and he said it was good. It was slathered with gravy on top. He did say he would prefer the gravy on the side. I didn't taste the poboy since I was really attempting to eat my meal. The red beans and rice, was just okay. The crab cake was very moist, and real crab!!! Would love this in a sandwich.

One of the better Jambalayas I've had, made even better by the house-made jalapeno hot sauce. Not too hot, TONS of flavor. Perfectly cooked rice, excellent sausage, just plain great overall.

I also had the Shrimp Caesar salad and had the shrimp blackened. Amazing. The Caesar dressing was so thick and creamy, but not too rich. 
Shrimp and Grits. Let me tell you, I have never been a fan of grits, but I made an exception, and I was patting myself on the back for doing so. Very creamy, nice and garlicky and the shrimp were huge! ( Had them blackened as well. )

Lola's is pretty unique when it comes to dining near DTLV. Nothing about it reminds you of The Strip. It's understated, casual, and fairly easy to score a reservation. 

I took my parents here for a belated b-day dinner in January. It was a weeknight and I wasn't looking to spend big bucks on a meal. Lola's takes reservations on Yelp and, as I said before, kind of a unique gem near downtown. Not your typical strip mall or casino eatery.

We started with oysters and crawpuppies. And for an entree we tried etoufeee as well as gumbo. All of the food was cooked well and came out quickly. All of this paired well with an Abita beer or glass of chilled white wine. 

As it got later into the evening, the restaurant started filling up quickly and was getting loud. Being that I was with my parents who are older and hardly ""party people"", we ordered dessert to-go and made it an early night.

Overall, I'd recommend Lola's to anyone looking for a relatively authentic NOLA meal way outside the south. Also, for folks looking to have a ""normal"" dining experience in Las Vegas, this is a solid spot to pick.",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,14,10,4,aOgWj1bax3J4KZgGK2OaLg

Crawpuppies are divine and I am not a fan of hush puppies at all. The crawfish really adds another dimension of flavor to the traditional dish. Had a cup of gumbo and the only bad part about it was that I didn't order a bowl. Just a hint of spice so you know it's there, but not overwhelming. Perfect on a cold day. My boyfriend has tried their chili dog po' boy. I'd say skip it. The bread is the best part, but a chili dog is a chili dog. I had a platter with a little bit of their seafood choices. It did not disappoint. Catfish is cooked to perfection; it is some flaky moist goodness. The mussels we heavenly. Easily the best thing on my plate. Crab cakes were good, but nothing to write home about. My friend ordered the shrimp & grits and it was creamy goodness. If you've ever wanted to try it or you're already a fan order it. Now on to dessert. I saw bananas foster on the menu and that is what made me drag everyone here with me. (and reasons I have gone back since) Who doesn't love bananas, with buttery, sweet, sugary sauce and vanilla bean ice cream? Probably the same people that enjoy clubbing baby seals. If I was on death row and had to place my order for my last meal bananas foster from Lola's would be part of that order. Only bad thing about this place is the size of the dining area.

We went with the Charbroiled Oysters to start :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2KX0qqRWWzza4lvTzNQ1cw

They are dressed with Garlic, Lemon, and a blend of cheeses! These were pretty good!  Not mind blowing but good at around $12-13 if I remember correctly.

I went with the Blackened Shrimp Poboy on New Orleans French Bread! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?select=-rgLE3shfCXIeA1fprAIGg#09IBYP8kA8h-iBcCyldMuA

Great sandwich...just wish the shrimp were a little larger taking into consideration the price, but they were cooked well and had tons of flavor!  For some odd reason, I was served my sandwich without my fries though...they came later, after I took my time taking pics of both entrees, eating bites of both entrees, and starting on my second half of the sandwich, the fries finally came.  I did like the seasoning on them though...slight cajun salt style on some ""well done"" cooked fries.

The Bronzed Catfish and Grits : 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#26bezKK4tDMzoxIcy2zvdA

Fresh Catfish, Bronzed, over Smoked Gouda Grits with Andouille Sausage and Mushroom Ragout. Cooked well and very yummy! Would recommend it!  Portions were a bit small in comparison to other cajun/southern style places we have been to in town though, and the prices were not cheap (not expensive either) in that reflection, but still good.

For dessert, there was a miscommunication...we wanted the Banana Foster Bread Pudding but got the regular banana fosters instead :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2nBYfnTojNkJf_zpe0iAoQ

It was good, but not nearly as good as the bread pudding! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lolas-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#6VaYCDgiODV53TnSZylS_A

It is made of Banana Bread / Bread Pudding, fresh Bananas, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Fosters Sauce! Very very good!! This was the highlight of the night for me!  The top of the ice cream had a slight creme brulee like crisp on it too!

Small complaint.  When we saw that we received the wrong intended dessert, we told the server and she ordered us the right one.  We had a bite or two of the wrong dessert thinking there might be some bread pudding hiding in there, but we quickly realized it was the wrong order.  They never took the wrong dessert off the table, so we ended up picking at it a bit, but still left at least 70% of the dessert on the table.  When the tab came through, we got charged for both.  I didn't complain or say anything, but the server asked us if we ate any of the wrong item, and I said we picked at it, but left most of it on the table.  She then offered to pay half of the plate costs $4 of the $8...

If this was almost at any other restaurant in town, the wrong order would have been comped.  If I would have raised a fuss, it would have been comped.  But because I didn't do that, Lola's paid for half..take it for what you will.

Overall, I can recommend this place, but the price/portion ratio isn't as solid as some of the other Cajun/Southern style spots in town, and the food was good, but not mind blowing good like Cajun spiced food should be!  A very solid 3 star spot in my book.

We were also probably the last people to leave for the night. I think we got in around 8pm, we didn't leave til about 10pm. It's a good thing the food made up for the service. I ordered the jumbalaya and my boyfriend ordered the gumbo. His friend ordered the chicken strips with fries. Overall, we really enjoyed our food. The jumbalaya had quite a kick to it. It was really spicy. I tasted some of the gumbo and it was also quite tasty. Prices were reasonable considering it is Vegas and off the strip.

A few things to note. My boyfriend and his friend are both blind. He doesn't need you to help him put a straw in his cup, especially when he says that he is fine. Please don't assume someone needs or wants your help just because they have a disability. Ask before doing. I know you just want to help but trust me the person will appreciate it more if you ask before helping them.

They are buttery and a good amount of garlic. The best part you dip their grilled french bread in the oyster juice and WOW I'm already craving it now haha. The blackened catfish and grits are so good and the fish is flaky and the best part is the grits arn't bland. You also gotta have abita beer which is from nola with your meal. The owner Lola is always there with her husband cooking and entertaining guests. This place is super small and it's off of the 15 on charleston. It is right by the premium outlet malls. It gets pretty busy at night so it's good to make a reso.,4cdPjnXl6DNngTeVDafPkg,0,0,5,cOCjulq-lZVx-d9mGy49vA

Looking back on recent trips, I decided I want some New Orleanian food.  So, off to Lola's I went.  The place was busy (always a good sign) and I was greeted by a friendly server.  With all the fleur de lis, Abita logo, paintings of antebellums...I was in Saints country without a doubt.  I sat under Guy Fieri's signed picture.

I got a sweet tea (as I should) and my sister ordered some char-grilled oysters.  According to her, they were good but not similar to Acme Oyster House's grilled oysters.  Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I have to believe it.  She had the shrimp and grits and she loved it.  I like their grits too...really cheesy!  I got the roast beef debris po' boy with fries (featured on Guy Fieri's show on the Food Network: Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives).  My fries were salty so I had to dust off the salt and dip them in lots of ketchup.  They're like the fries from Five Guys but 3 times the salt.

For dessert, we had the sweet potato pecan pie and the BANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING.  The pie was quite good.  The bread pudding with the homemade caramel sauce was out of this world - I don't recommend sharing it.

They have oysters, po' boys, sweet potato, bananas foster, sweet tea, gumbo, étouffée, gumbo...all they need are beignets and alligator.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,7,4,ukzc-xEh7ok70lSDssy8zg
5322524,2014-04-09,3,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"When my father was in town we decided to pay homage to my hometown state of Louisiana and with the crisp, chilly weather ghosts of Gumbo past had me cravin' cajun. I've had Lola's bookmarked for a long time and based on Yelp reviews, it seemed legit. 

Walking in, I noticed a stack of King Cakes and Louisiana paraphernalia decorated the walls (beads, fleur de lys, Bourbon Street signs, and Saints flags). I felt like I had stepped into a restaurant in the French Quarter, it was small and quaint. Recommendations are strongly recommend. My father and I lucked out and were seated at a hi-top table near the bar. 

Our server came over and greeted us with a smile and warm, ""Hey y'all! What can I get you to drink while y'all are lookin' over the menu?"" authentic accent and all. (Seriously, it's a portal to Louisiana and Southern hospitality.) I ordered a sweet tea (which is SO hard to find West of the Mississippi - besides Texas) and our drinks were ordered promptly arrived with warm, freshly buttered and flashed grilled bread. We both ordered a cup of Gumbo and we're still narrowing down our choices.

The Gumbo arrived with lightning speed & was on point. It was thick (a lot of people think it's a soup, but it's very much like a stew) and filled with chunks (not bits) of Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken, and okra. Tasted like home; it was excellent.

For entrees we ordered Crawfish Etouffee (my FAVORITE Cajun dish of all-time) and Shrimp Creole. The etouffee was amazing, the butter, garlic, and green pepper flavors well balanced and there was just the right amount of heat. The good times we're definitely being had by my mouth. Shrimp Creole was also amazing, tomato-y, peppery, garlicky, onion-y paradise. The shrimp were also huge (love me some oximorons). I found out that their shrimp, crawfish, and catfish were flown in from Louisiana. At this point we were way too full to try dessert. I am planning a second trip back to explore more of menu and to give that Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. 

I got to live the Louisiana state motto: ""Come fall in Love with Louisiana all over again"" on my trip to Lola's. It's great to know that there is great Creole & Cajun cuisine just around the corner. Excellent service. Standout, authentic food! A warm, friendly atmosphere.

5355407,2017-11-19,0,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"I'd give them a 3.5 if I was able to. It's an easy place to miss but it's worth the stop for a bite of decent food. We are in Vegas for another weekend and as I almost always do, I Yelp every business I think of trying to see what my fellow Yelper's have experienced. In this case, I couldn't help but see (or taste) for myself to find out which reviews I could identify with. Bottom line, as it has been stated ""The food is GOOD, but not GREAT"". I 100% agree with this statement.

I took photos of the food we had except for the wings and Red Beans & Rice I missed those. We had a sampler of items; Gumbo, Red Beans & Rice, Jambalaya, Chargrilled Oysters, Craw-puppies, Cajun Hot Wings & Bread Pudding. How was it? The Red Beans & Rice was good and so was the Bread Pudding. The wings at a #8 level of spiciness was indeed spicy but flavorful. As far as the other items...well, I wouldn't order the Gumbo again, not that it wasn't good, the taste was just off for me and I also thought it lacked seafood; mine had half of a shrimp tail as I recall. The overall taste was ok but having had gumbo in so many places including New Orleans , I'd have to say, in comparison, the gumbo at Lucille's has better taste than Lola's. The  Craw-puppies; two (2) issues -cost to food ratio and taste; you get four (4) bite size (literal bite size) pieces for $5.29, I wouldn't order it again, the crawfish wasn't the main ingredient, it was moist breading with a strong mayo/mustard combo taste. For the very small size and qty, I thought it would be packed with crawfish and be bursting with flavor but it was not and did not. The Jambalaya was ok, my husband liked it enough -for me, it didn't have the tomato and seasonings infused to the rice taste but more like seasoned tomatoes sauce that was stirred in. I did enjoy the taste of the Chargrilled Oysters, they were deeeelicious, the most flavorful of all of what we tried and you get toasted french bread with it which is a plus in my book -the negative: the actual oysters were really tiny. Also, the cost for that size; $12.99 for six (6), is not worth the money because there wasn't much of the oysters to be had. I would order it again if the oysters themselves are bigger because they were good.

Lastly, the service. I read some reviews that said the people were awkward and they just sort of stared at you...I didn't experience that at all. The woman that was our server was very nice and pleasant and checked on us often. If we needed anything, any server walking by was glad to help. I felt the service was pretty good.

I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was plain and just not very good. A little less than two years ago, I went to New Orleans and had fantastic food. We went to very good restaurants and had everything from barbecue shrimp to Gouda grits to gumbo and more. It was all absolutely delicious. I loved it. Due to this, I thought... Let's give this restaurant another try. Well... I'm sorry I did. 
Lola's is terrible in comparison to the quality of food that I had in New Orleans. I ordered the shrimp and grits again. Grits should be smooth, not lumpy, and just taste like heaven. The grits at Lola's were lumpy, pasty, and the consistency was that of a dish that was left out for a few hours and has therefore hardened rather than being smooth. The taste is not very good and leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, there is a diner with a few restaurants here in town that makes grits 10 times better than Lola's. The shrimp was plain and I would not order it again. My friend ordered the barbecue shrimp with rice and did not even finish the dish because it was just OK yet she would not order it again nor would she want to come back here again. She was disappointed. We did order the fried okra as a starter and it was not bad but it was not anything to write home about. The best part of our meal was the garlic bread! Pretty sad.
We did not even bother ordering dessert.
Lola's is not a restaurant I would recommend to anyone who asks me about great Louisiana food because I have tasted way better.
The service was OK. It was slow at times.
I know that this restaurant was on DDD's, which I'm not at all impressed by, yet I think that is where a lot of the hype comes in.
I was hoping that after going to New Orleans, where we stayed several days and ate a lot of great food, I would appreciate this restaurant more. It in fact did the opposite. Maybe this is what home cooked meals are supposed to look like, which aren't very good if that is the case, but this is not at all great restaurant quality top-of-the-line New Orleans quality food and I will not be going back.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,2,n5gQ5ll7NnSCKwgRFYbyjQ

Located in what used to be the old Holsum Bakery, Lola's was not too far out, and I was definitely more on track to getting (for me) what the flavor should be like.  Yes, I am picky when it comes to my Southern type food.

I had a nice lunch here last week.  A small one, but it worked.  I tried their gumbo, and it was good.  I thought it was nice and meaty, but I wanted just a little more flavor.  Overall, I did like it.  I think a shot of Tabasco would have gone a long way, but that's on me.

The jambalaya, however, was some seriously good stuff.  THAT got my face a little flushed, and I scarfed that down with gusto.

The place itself is respectable.  Nice little patio with some good ol' fashioned jazz playing.  I've heard they do live bands on the weekends, which I will have to check out.  The service was also not.  Very helpful, not pushy, and certainly knew the food.  Being a newcomer, I try to go off of recommendations, and what the waiter suggested suited me just fine.

I will certainly try them again, and go for some of the other items on the menu.  I had a light lunch, but it was a very satisfactory meal, and one that I would definitely try again in the future.

Crawpuppies:   A little expensive for the small order.  They don't look pretty, in fact they look a little burnt.  Don't let that fool you.  These things were soft and tasty on the inside.  They come with an aioli, but I decided to go with a hot sauce.  You choose.  You can't go wrong.

5476661,2013-06-12,1,uWECX6-Uq9n8v5ipk9R29A,"Let's start with the food, well it's actually pretty good, it's close to what you will actually find in the Big Easy, it's not up to the standard of some of the good New Orleans restaurants but it's pretty good.

I had the BBQ shrimp, which is 5 shrimp (of a good size) on white rice with a BBQ sauce...For $16...Yeah the price is a little steep for what you get, but it was good. Now it did instantly remind me of the shrimp dish I had at Grind Brgr Bar in Palm Springs, just not as good and 3 times the price.

The wife had the Shrimp and grits....Yeah she is a good southern girl...Wanna be, her Cali heritage though actually liked the dish, again 5 shrimp, grits, for $16...

For dessert we went for the bread pudding, now, this is the star of the place, it's probably the best bread pudding I have eaten, period, so if you are a bread pudding lover then head over there just for that.

Now you are probably wondering why only 3 stars, well, the service.....

Holy crap, we could have easily walked out of the place without paying the bill, despite being seated in front of the waiter station, for whatever reason our waitress decided that we were to be ignored, I actually had to call someone over to ask if she had died....

I should have guessed it was going to be this way when the busser took our drink order, told us """""""" would be our waitress, then after a while he took our order and delivered the food...then refill drinks, even though by this time he was actually off the clock and in street clothes ready to go home.....And the bill....Yep he dropped of the bill...In fact the only time she actually showed was to collect the bill....

Now sure, wait staff can get busy, but this is a small place, you would really have to be trying for the wait staff to lose you...

But she actually managed to top her no existent service act...She performed an act that is becoming a little bit of a common problem out her...

The bill was $63.48, $100 bill given, change was $36.....Hold on a second, where are the coins...Yeah, for whatever reason she decided to kept the coins...

This has happened a few times at other places. normally a quick ""hey you shorted me on my change, but I will just take it out of your tip, grab it from the register"" seems like a quick way, but how do you tip someone that hasn't done anything except pick up the bill ???

Well the wife is nicer than me, let's leave it at that...

But overall, good food, horrible service except for the busser (or maybe he was a waiter going off shift, not 100% sure).",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,4,0,2,TZDf1TLIYkK7fZ4WdJGOLQ

REALLY GOOD: Charbroiled oysters, Fried Oysters, Catfish, French Fries and the BBQ shrimp (twice). Bread Pudding is as good as I have ever had...Damn near perfect!

NOT AS GOOD: Gumbo is tasty but needs to be darker. Fried Crawpuppies tend to come out still cold in the center. BBQ shrimp (third time) had to be sent back. Crabcakes are full of bread but this is NOLA  style not Baltimore. I know they are having problems with the bread getting stale unless it is grilled or toasted.

PRETTY BAD: The Crawfish Etouffee was terrible, very few crawfish and the gravy tasted of nothing but ready-made under cooked roux, YUCK!   The Sweet Potato Pie was pasty and insipid and the crust would make a Cajun Nana cringe.

I am not sure how ""authentic"" the n'awlins fare is (and I've been to NOLA) but the ambiance is nice, the waitstaff is pleasant, and the food is great.

I had the gouda grits and the roast beef po'boy.   When I was in New Orleans in the late 80's, the po'boy seemed to be a gimmick offering that was all about just making a huge, almost un-finish-able sandwich piled so high with meat that you could not even get your jaws around.

At Lola's, the sandwich is more about making an amazing tasting sandwich vs just a huge sandwich.  It is covered in a heavy gravy and stuffed with high quality ingredients.  It was extremely tasty and I finished the whole thing (unlike po buys I had in NO).  The gouda grits were great, nothing like the typical bland grits (sorry, southerners) you get most places.  The cheese really makes this dish pop.

Since I was travelling for work, I was only one person and they sat me in a little 2-seat table by the 'bar', which was perfect for me.

I saw Lola at the door, greeting and saying goodby to customers, which was nice.  I saw one lady with a midwestern accent telling her ""I saw you on TV"" and she was very nice and accomodating to all of the guests.

I would definitely come back.

The manager was brought to the table and I explained what was going on. She just looked at the fish while I was telling her I was not paying for this. She didn't say sorry she just took the plate and brought it back to the kitchen. She took the fish off the bill but charged me for the sides. I'm like really.

3.I ordered the crawfish hush puppies to start and jambalaya with added shrimp. My bf ordered the fried shrimp with the fried oyster, and crab cake. He asked for gritz and greens on the side. The crawfish puppies were interesting.I don't eat crawfish much so I'm not exactly sure how they supposed to taste so I'll just describe what it tasted like.Tart.The jambalaya came and LOOKED very promising.That jambalaya HURT MY FEELINGS. It was the mushiest, no flavor having jambalaya I have EVER TASTED. This jambalaya was the WORST ever. It taste like tomato and mushy rice. The chicken was very small and the shrimp just had no taste to it. My bf's food was COOKED perfectly.His fish was crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside. He took his first bite and said ""It needs A LOT of hot sauce"" I tasted that fish and AGAIN no flavor! I mean..NONE I was soooooooo confused because Cajun food usually has SO MUCH FLAVOR..He used half their bottle of hot sauce to give that fish flavor.He taste the grits and actually sent them back because they were so bad. Just so you know my bf isn't the type to send food back. He rather just pour a lot of salt and pepper on it and ""make it work"" Needless to say, after that HORRIBLE meal and the $70 bill we were done.

Apparently everyone likes this place too as there was no immediate parking.  After 10 minutes of parking lot stalking I found a spot and went inside.  The dining room is small and jam packed with tables. It actually reminded me of some of the places I sampled ages ago when I was in New Orleans.  The menu has po' boy sandwiches, gumbo, creole, remoulade, catfish and more NOLA favorites.  The restaurant has been featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives and the owner comes from New Orleans.  The wait staff was excellent.  Although they seemed like they were running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they all took time to ask how I was doing.  My waitress suggested the Bronzed Catfish and grits and I took the bait.  

Due to the crowd, the wait for my meal was longer than I would have liked for lunch and I received several apologies from the waitress and the manager.  When the meal came, it was truly worth the wait.  The grits had absorbed the flavor of the well cooked catfish and the gouda/mushroom mixture.  The catfish was well seasoned with a light coating that didn't overpower the fish. 

The bread was an afterthought and did not add anything to the meal but did assist in cleaning the last bites of grits off the plate.

I would have liked it to have more of a cajun kick and will definitely try a spicier option the next trip out.

The po'boy was fantastic. The meat was perfectly tender and the gravy with it was awesome. The lightly toasted bread had great texture and flavor. The gumbo cup was super tasty.  It was rich and flavorful loaded with sausage, chicken and, okra. The rice on the bottom added a nice balance to the dish.  The grits reminded me of a risotto. They were perfectly done. Not too runny or too set. The flavor was well balance and the addition of the cheese was a masterful touch.

Don't get discouraged when you see their flaming fire sign on their menu. If you're a big spicy eater, I'd compare this to a mild you'd find at boiling crab or soon du bu. For entrees, it looks like everyone goes for either the shrimp & grits or the catfish & grits. My friend got the catfish option. Their catfish was delicious. It wasn't deep fried, but still had a nice crisp texture on the outside. I was craving some pasta and got the shrimp charlotte. Its a light mushroom based sauce with shrimp on top of angel hair.

Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go all-out and try a ton of menu items. We made a reservation for Saturday night and were greeted by Lola, herself, at the door. The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall. Here is the low-down on the meal:

Crab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious! Lots of crab and not a lot of filler. A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic. The crab cakes were second only to my own.

Craw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive! These were crispy and delicious, but maybe a touch too soft/undercooked in the middle.

Gumbo - The gumbo looked good and started off great on my palate, but lacked seasoning, mainly salt, and spice.

Catfish and grits - OMG the cheesy grits were unbelievable, I literally did not want to eat the last bite. The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected. They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up. 

My dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread. I was able to steal some french fries and was so glad I did, they were fantastic. My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me. 

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.

Banana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste! It was the best banana's foster I have ever had. A delicious sweet brown sugar coating with the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream...yes please!

Overall, Lola's is a great Cajun alternative to the real deal. There were definitely some high points to the meal, but there were a few mediocre points as well.

I first stopped by last year right after a trip to New Orleans, was super excited to see barbecue shrimp on the menu. It ended up being a big let down - think it was $17 or $18 for 4 shrimp in a not spicy sauce and a huge mound of rice. I left feeling a little ripped off- it felt like that should've been a $12 appetizer vs an entree.  
I went with friends for lunch last week and LOVE Lola's now. We were seated outside and I think the server forgot about us for a while. But the food made up for it. I had the soft shell crab po boy - huge, bread was cut in half with 1 crab in each so perfect for sharing. Crispy yummy crab on their light flaky bread. I got the potato salad, which was just ok. Fries were also mediocre, but sweet potato fries were possibly the best I've ever had. Had some of my friends fried shrimp po boy too - only 4 shrimp total, which is a little skimpy but the shrimp were pretty fat and super sweet.

I was torn between shrimp and beef for my sandwich so having some shrimp in the gumbo made it possible to satisfy both cravings. Satisfying is an understatement for this dish. Well done, 5/5 for sure. 

Ordered the roast beef debris po boy with all the dressings. I really liked the flavor combination. The crispness of the bread was perfect contrast for the soggy gravy. The meat portion left much to be desired unfortunately. Although I enjoyed the flavor profile I am disappointed that I left hungry. I wish I would have taken a picture so I could compare it to future visits. This was during dinner so I assumed it would be a good representation of their flagship product. Unfortunately, it was not. I will give it a second chance just in case it was an off day or a stingy cook. 2/5

Went in last night with about 10 people for my boyfriend's birthday. We all order a bunch of different things so we got to taste a little bit of everything. Everything was delicious.

My boyfriend ordered the oyster app, which was probably the most delicious oysters I have ever had. This says a lot because I'm from California so we used to go to the pier and have fresh seafood all the time.

I ordered the hot crab artichoke dip, also really good. The only down fall is not having enough break for it. The bread they give is omfg amazing. I think I ate a few pieces of the bread by itself (probably why I ran out for the dip).

For entree boyfriend ordered New Orlean's BBQ shrimp, I got the shrimp creole. My dish was so flavorful and so fresh and amazing, my only complaint was not having enough shrimp on there but it's not even a big deal because you can literally just eat the rice with the sauce and it's fantastic.

We got the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding and the Bananas Foster. Both are absolutely delicious. The Bananas Foster comes with vanilla ice cream which is much needed because those bananas are effing hot. The bread pudding was also amazing.

We ordered some beers and sweet tea which were also really good. 

For having such a big table of people, the restaurant was able to accommodate us inside comfortably. The service was great, could have been a bit nicer but it's not something you really care about because you're distracted with all of your friends to care. They get really really busy and for good reason. We were with someone who grew up in Louisiana and he also enjoyed all of the food.

I ordered jambalaya and my fiancé ordered the gumbo and I found myself wishing I had ordered the gumbo. The spice level in his dish was perfect and they brought garlic bread to sop up the excellent flavor. My jambalaya was fairly bland which I wasn't expecting at all! The dish was maybe 20 percent chicken and sausage and 80 percent rice. I added hot sauce just to give it some sort of kick and wished someone had talked me into ordering it with shrimp. We finished with Lola's famous bread pudding which was too rich for me but my fiancé loved it. Very dense but too much with the sauce, raisins and candied nuts, in my opinion. We also tried the banana pudding and that was probably my least favorite banana pudding I've ever had. Maybe because it was 7pm on a Friday and it was not the freshest? It was bland with a burnt marshmallow topping and very soggy nilla wafers. I did have some community coffee which was smooth and not bitter at all. I had two cups and a to go cup full as well.

Another stop for my DDD list.  I am not sure why I keep falling for this.  Of course the food was,""Killer!"", like everything Guy seems to eat. 
Well the crab cake, what we started with, was not ""Killer.""  It was mushy, under seasoned, and tasted and had a texture more like paste in the inside than lump crab. 

I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the blackened salmon, both totally edible, in fact they weren't bad.  I wish that the sauce on my grits was a little more viscous.  It began to get watery at the end.  My friend enjoyed the Salmon, but apparently it was slightly over seasoned in areas.  

My partners main complaint was that the portion size did not match the price.  For the price maybe the salad should come with the meal.  Also they're grits for crying out loud!  It's cheap hominy corn.  Put some more of them on the plate with the four shrimp.  It was an entree right?  ""How long does it take you to cook your grit?""  Joe Pesci fans, Unite!

They had a special memorial day dessert, it was for the troops of course, so we tried it.  It was advertised to us as a cobbler, but it ended up being more of a shortcake type of dessert.  Never-the-less it was delicious and we gobbled it up.

The final downer was the being rushed, but we're not rushing you atmosphere.  I hadn't even got my full ass in the seat before the waitress was asking us what we wanted to drink.  How about bring us some water and a menu.  I almost stabbed a bus boy with my fork when he attempted to grab my plate before my last bite was gone.

We had the combo platter and it was mostly fried but lightly battered. The crab cake had great flavor and wasn't full of filler. The shrimp was great and you could tell they were fresh and never frozen. The collard greens werent great but acceptable. My GF said they weren't real collard greens and she wished she could find at least one place that served them right. (Any ideas let me know please)

I had the Blackened shrimp pasta. It was wonderful. I wish I had asked before ordering as I would have loved a piece of their catfish blackened like that and they do serve it like that so if you want blackened catfish I would give it a try.

The crawfish balls were good but had a little tangy flavor I couldnt place. I would try them again.

The decor is typical New Orleans style and it is small and almost cramped inside. I guess they call it intimate but I dont like having to listen to the conversations of those around you. 

The staff is very knowledgeable I ended up talking to our server after our meal and their lunch rush had left. She said you lucked out by being seated so quick. You should always call and make a reservation as they dont have ample seating.

Can't wait to return for another awesome meal! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Had 2 shrimp dinners that were perfect.,Ht2iwCEELaepTtU_VW0g5w,0,0,5,T-MIx6axHL2JFTm9Qmtb2A

The Gouda Grits were excellent (I'd never eaten grits before) and the oysters on the half shell were amazing (I'd never eaten those, either!).  Finally, the desserts...  The Bananas Foster Bread Pudding was just...  well...  I can't think of another superlative!  Oh, and the service?  Professional but very, very friendly.  The staff have great senses of humor!",T972sjXPqZuQbSqMr-9lVQ,0,0,5,brRLtKvrJSguDCC4AWmj6g

I typically flock to any joint on Triple D but I guess I just don't make it near the Strip too often.  Came with my wife and baby, and although dinning area is small, we sat comfortably.  Staff was especially friendly and the owner walked around greeting tables. These are the things that impress my wife.  As for me, it's the food that really matters!  Lola's does Creole right and then some.  From hush puppies to soft shell crab to jambalaya, you can't go wrong.  I will point out that I've never lived in LA so my opinion is that of a Nawlins tourist.  But I know what my taste buds like, and they tell me I need to go back to Lola's again sometime soon!",s81YWGDJpgdIfsC3rOtiyQ,1,1,4,aynPG-Or74knYjqHMpqwwQ
