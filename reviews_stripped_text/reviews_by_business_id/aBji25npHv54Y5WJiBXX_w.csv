The cashiers were nice this time, but the food still sucks and it doesn't look like management is going to do anything about it. Stop making your food with the cheapest ingredients you can find, and actually try giving a shit about your customers. Maybe then you'll get more customers.

I got a carne asada burrito to go and the meat was disgusting...it was mostly gristle and cartilage, and the chunks that were chewable were dry, tough, and flavorless. I live nearby and try to support local business, but I'm going to stick with Chipotle and Cafe Rio until something else comes along. Gross.",BiL7ixiHM27nZbHwWwupqA,0,0,1,v475dDdnnUV8fvsxJM2HgQ

Other than having great service they have a large selection of food within their menu. Definitely a highly recommended place to go.",mcaaxE101zOpLl2phvaPmQ,0,0,5,RxSZI_hyoKQDRYB79v4sCg

I didn't care for the Asada's seasoning and the meat was a bit dry. It was very greasy. The carnitas was fairly good although it was greasy too. I think I'll give them one other try. I liked the spicy cilantro sauce. I also got a side of beans. It was a lot and it tasted as if they came straight out of a can. I don't know if I'll try them again.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,4,0,2,FqwAzT2NoFijVHLE3012Xg

2010572,2016-02-12,5,aBji25npHv54Y5WJiBXX_w,"Yet another subpar taqueria in a predominantly Hispanic 'hood with better options literally in the same parking lot. Prices are about average but quality is less than- corn tortillas were slick with grease, lengua was adequate but barbacoa was barely passble. $2 ""side"" of a beef tamale was okay, if a bit heavy on the masa. Doubt this place has what it takes to stay in business though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,6,2,DhAxzVC0uANMEHbmMoPSmg

I always either use the drive thru or use the recent delivery option. They recently changed the name and are going with Los Reyes. They also extended the hours, which is great! I just love the delivery option when I'm in a pinch working from home and need food quickly. They will deliver in under 20 minutes.",zYl_FvnrdsbYL4yQeKBA8w,0,0,3,v1Zbg_EsXDZQJ-XWKWvkig

4371075,2015-12-04,0,aBji25npHv54Y5WJiBXX_w,"Where do I begin?  This place has an entertainment coupon for buy one menu item get one free. So we make the trip to try them out. They refused to use the coupon from the entertainment app.  They made many excuses why they won't accept the coupon. Example: we will lose money, we will never see you again if we let you use the coupon.  I advised it can only be used once and if they are confident in quality of there food, they should not worry about us not returning.  There was nobody at the restaurant or the drive thru. They rather turn away business then honor there coupon.  They tried to say previous owners went under by offering promotions. Well sorry to break it to you sir, but your business will go under by trying to save a nickel instead of pleasing a potential new customer. There are good places in vegas to try that don't give customers such a hard time. As a long term yelp reviewer,  please read other places I recommend and avoid this establishment as they obviously don't care or know how to obtain new loyal customers.",SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,3,1,1,80MHyF1lcwfMs_UWaP7ZlQ

I went to the bathroom and noticed a huge stack of boxes on top of a cabinet.   It looked unstable as if it could easily be knocked over and upon closer inspection it was boxes of food serving containers and supplies(one could just look inside and see white plastic lids in a plastic bag)!   I find storage of food serving supplies in a bathroom disgusting.   I don't see how that is acceptable.   I was concerned about trying the food,  so I left.",Cfwvos6oFlDquGiI2Qy1gQ,0,0,1,epTAGB51ohxQHMVVkfFyDg

  I came in here for lunch while on break. I was pleasantly surprised by the Owner working the register and preparing the food. He said he just took over and was making a lot of changes. 

I ordered a Asada Burrito. When I got it, he brought it out to me and man was I surprised! It was huge!  I was not only surprised by the size but on how great it tasted too! 
 
 I have since been back and the food has not been a disappointment at all! I  am highly recommending this place as a must go. 

It's a  hole in the  wall, but it's a gem of a place to eat!",igai9QqTHy6cPOCZZAUMtg,0,0,5,7bVAAlv_2JV52kj85mucvg
