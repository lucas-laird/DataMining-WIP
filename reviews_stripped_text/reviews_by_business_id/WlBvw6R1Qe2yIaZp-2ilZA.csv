45067,2014-11-21,0,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,I love this place so much. I always get the chimichanga and let me tell you.  It's so amazing. My wife always gets the ceviche .. it's so so amazing. Perfect amount of lime and spices. It's so good. Also there's such nice people. This one girl I think her name is Melissa ? Or Michelle ? I know she's new. Her attitude is amazing  she always comes with a smile and my chips. Which ! They are made fresh every day. I'm getting hungry just thinking about.

60961,2013-11-06,9,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"First of all, I'm a major YELP user, and like most of you on here, I look at Yelp for food recommendations; however, I am a terrible Yelper and never actually post anything on here. This place was so bad, that I actually had to find time to post something to inform the public on how terrible this place is!

Coming home from Red Rock Canyon, we (party of 4) decided to give this place a try.

The hostesses seemed lost when I requested a table for four. She just walked in a circle around the restaurant before going back to the front to ask another hostess for help on where to seat us ?!  

We ordered the mussels, which were super tiny and came with half of them still closed. Why would you serve totally closed mussels to your patrons?  The dates, at a whopping $6 for three, don't even have a nut in the middle like Firefly giving them no texture.  The sangria was good, however, it was overloaded with ice in an attempt to minimize alcohol content and maximize volume with ice.  The bruschetta with ham (NOT PROSCIUTTO AS IT SHOULD BE) was good, but for 7-8$ for two tiny pieces, it was way overpriced.  We also ordered Scallops, Sausage, and another item which we cancelled because we just wanted to leave and find another place to eat.

Basically, everything is so overpriced that you will spend 40$ per person and leave totally hungry.  The quality of the shrimp, mussels, and other meats is so poor and tiny that it seems that the owners are simply taking advantage of the ""Summerlin Area"" by charging such high prices for such low quality.

Finally, this ""Tapas Restaurant"" actually has gaming machines and huge flat screen TV's all over it with football playing loudly on all screens making this a hyped-up PT's rather than a Spanish-feeling restaurant. 

Stick with Barcelona, Firefly, or another tapas restaurant if you want to leave full and satisfied, not hungry and ripped-off.",c0FnXW37yhrzwkRrTDbVfA,14,7,1,C830wF0TSlFigswD_2cfJg
124516,2014-03-21,0,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"Went to Toros for a dinner on a Friday night.  Service was good, but could have been better.  I had to flag our waiter down for utensils which weren't on the table but no big deal.  In other Tapas restaurants I'm used to the waiter coming over pretty frequently to check if you want anything else since they are small plates.  
We ordered an array of tapas including the padron peppers, pil pil shrimp, and ox tail.  We also ordered the pork sandwich.  The peppers were tasty but I probably wouldn't order again.  The pil pil shrimp was excellent...lots of flavor and cooked very well.  I would skip the ox tail next time although it was done well.  The sandwich was terrible...dry with no sauce on it.  We ended up dipping it in the pil pil shrimp sauce which wasn't bad, but definitely do not order this.  We will probably be back to check this place out again, but it won't be a regular dining experience for us even though it's close to home",XLhIOMXZYvCVswu54we3dw,0,0,3,yUzncYVzGE1PVsgsgDdcrw

We were sorely disappointed when everything we ordered was significantly lacking in flavor. I don't even think salt was used on any of the dishes. Tapas are supposed to be packed with taste-bud tickling flavors and that is definitely not what we received.

203224,2014-02-17,1,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"After receiving such horrible service at another tapas place located downtown yesterday, I am urged to update my review of Toros.  

The service is wonderful...I am very intuitive and I can read body language well...the staff here truly mesh in the right way and often have smiles on their faces while remaining professional and maintaining boundaries (I saw one bartender who was concerned about a seemingly very drunk customer and handled the situation with calmness and gentle rigidness...very well done!)

The food is wonderful but it takes time to find what ""wonderful"" means to you.  To me, the saffron chicken was bad (bland, tasteless and mushy) but I wasn't charged for it as Rhiannon could tell that I didn't like it.  I didn't complain, she could just tell!  Nice!

Now I stick to the bacon wrapped dates, calamari, brava potatoes, meatballs and padron peppers..maybe a few other choices here and there.

I appreciate the personalized letters in the mail thanking ME for being a patron and offering me vouchers for match play and free tapas when I come in.

I've been treated with warmth by the bartenders, servers and the manager...all of whom remember my name when I come in (and no, not just when I put my gaming card in and they can see my name on the computers!).  

Great place to pop in before or after a run, bike or hike to Red Rock.  I often arrive in my Brooks hat and UnderArmour.

230930,2014-08-31,0,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"Happy to upgrade our Toros rating to 4 stars!

Haven't been here is several months but noticed they changed their menu from Spanish to Mexican and were offering a Groupon so why not give them another try? 

We were off to a great start soon as we arrived. Seated promptly on a Friday nite and we were looking to watch the UNLV game while we had dinner and the asked if they were showing it on one of the TVs. The host promptly turned the channel for us!

We ordered a few items to share: 
~Carne asada NACHOS were perfect! They fry their own tortilla chips which to me is a must-do if you are a Mexican restaurant. 

~TACOS: The ground beef is crunchy shell and also home-fried, was our fav of the tacos. Al pastor was a bit sweet for my taste but still good. Barbacoa was tender and flavorful. Overall- I like spicy so just wish they had some hot salsa on the side - which they might. Meant to order the cactus salsa but forgot- plus it costs an extra dollar - salsa should be a ""given"" in a Mexican restaurant. 

~SIDE:  Corn (elotes) was fresh and buttery served with cojita cheese but needed a little spice shaker. The cilantro rice was green. Like Kermit green. Didn't look natural so it threw me off and it didn't taste very good.

~Finished off the meal with the homemade CHURROS recommended by our waiter. They were served hot covered in cinnamon sugar--crisp on the outside with a warm soft inside and fresh whipped cream. So delicious! Even better than Bobby Flays at Mesa Grill",0qka5xnvBpBm7ZfGsU9oCg,0,0,4,OGutP3tPJWJWtsReltcEgA

We started off with one of their signature cocktails, I had the cranberry fizz and he had the bloody Caesar. Although the drinks were pricey, they weren't watered down or tiny. The first thing that came out was their bread, and honestly it was the best bread I had at a restaurant in a long time: super rustic and crusty, served with some sort of aoili. The Manchego cheese plate was really good too. Stuffed Piquillo peppers, just ok. Garlic shrimp: well cooked, but I expected a little more flavor and punch. Meatballs: succulent and flavorful. I was slightly put off by the continuous use of red sauce, though. 

I love the decor of this place and it certainly helps that it's a short walking distance to our house. I really hope that it does well so the neighborhood has more options besides John Cutter.",IZ6jUBQVfG6l2DSPqhejFw,4,1,4,Vq2P1HX7zfi8qnzPPeTZKA

We had: Calamari ( needed a few more seconds in the fryer), cantimpalitos ( excellent), tortilla (good), scargots ( probably canned, sauce was great). Bread service was good. Skip the sangria saince it was weak and watered down. 
Back to service: not even one table check, we had to waive for service for several minutes while being ignored by several staff members. We ordered round two of tapas, no table bussing or drinks offered. 
Without going into technical service issues, the staff need to be trained in genuine customer service. Smiling and general hospitality were completely absent from the place. Server was obviously "" in the weeds"" without a busser or assistant for the entire table turn.

531184,2013-12-30,7,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"Reading over the reviews submitted so far for Toros, I am baffled.  Most yelpers rave about the wonderful food; the few exceptions thought the food was fine but too pricey.  I couldn't disagree more with either camp.

First, the food.  I have a fairly strict standard for eating out:  Trader Joe's frozen entrees.  Huh wha??  Lemme 'splain ... a while back I discovered that Trader Joe's offers remarkably good frozen food - no, not as good as making everything from scratch with fresh ingredients, but orders of magnitude better than any other frozen cuisine.  After sampling a few dishes, I decided that if a restaurant wasn't noticeably better than TJ's frozen, it's just not worth it.  That's when I decided to never again eat at the likes of Friday's, Bennigan's, Outback, etc.  Mind you, the restaurant doesn't have to be fancy.  I'll eat at a hot dog stand, as long as it serves really good dogs.

Although Trader Joe's doesn't offer Spanish tapas, I'm pretty sure that if they did, they'd be a helluva lot better than the menu at Toros.  Wow, what a morass of mediocrity.  Started with the chicken in saffron sauce and the braised oxtail.  The chicken had no flavor (just bland white meat chicken), and the saffron sauce just tasted like a generic cream sauce, straight out of some bottle.  The braised oxtail meat was OK, but the sauce it was drowning in was off.  If I kept the meat and vegetables out of the weird sauce, it was OK.  Then I ordered bacon-wrapped dates, grilled asparagus, and seared salmon.  The bacon-wrapped dates tasted awfully generic.  I don't know what the difference is, but the b-w dates at Jaleo are a thousand times better.  The grilled asparagus with aioli was the best dish of the night, although that's damning with faint praise.  And the seared salmon with spinach and garlic sauce was nowhere nearly as good as whatever frozen salmon dish at Trader Joe's.  I didn't realize it was a garlic sauce until I saw it on the menu just now because it tasted like flavorless white cream sauce (tasted the same as the supposedly saffron cream sauce - I'm guessing Toros's ""saffron"" is Yellow Dye #something).  The salmon was overcooked, therefore a bit dry and lacking flavor.  And the spinach was horribly salty.  Finally, on to dessert.  Apparently the Spanish version of rice pudding is rice pudding with cinnamon sprinkled on top.  If you're craving rice pudding, buy it at Costco - Costco rice pudding is worlds better than the stuff at Toros.

The atmosphere left me somewhat annoyed.  The server/bartender (I ate at the bar) was very nice but got a bit annoying because instead of asking me how things were, she kept asking, ""Isn't everything just amazing?  Isn't the food fantastic?  Don't you just love it?""  No, no, and HELL no.  I ordered a glass of sangria, $6 for cheap red wine mixed with 7-Up and a lot of ice.  Toros is also a ""Nevada-style pub,"" which means they have video poker at the bar.  For most of my meal, there was a group playing the machines, and they were quite raucous when celebrating every little win.  I'm not criticizing them, but be prepared for that if you eat here.

The one thing I'm not criticizing at Toros is the prices.  The menu prices are all very reasonable.  I had a 50% off Groupon, but even at full price, my bill for the large quantity of food I ordered wouldn't have come to much.  Also, they have happy-hour (forget the hours) when a lot of the items are half-price.

If you're idea of a great steakhouse is Outback or great Italian is Olive Garden, then you'll probably love Toros.  Me?  I'll save my money for Jaleo.  If I had the opportunity to eat 52 meals at Toros for the same price as 1 meal at Jaleo, I'd savor the meal at Jaleo and enjoy my heated-up Trader Joe's the rest of the year.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,18,2,1,P02ODyHkOPuF8atafMdifA

Love the music.   Love the picking my own utensils from the Mason jar.  But the food, AAAARRGH!  TOROS - I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED BUT YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME WITH THE FOOD!!!  The reviews about your food being lukewarm and bland are absolutely true! The only thing you have going for you now is a captive audience (i.e. those of us who live nearby and appreciate a place close to home where we can hang out on a weekend night).   I tried you when you were new and the food was, well... lukewarm and bland.  The service was okay.  I held off on writing a review and decided to give you a second chance a few months later figuring you needed some time to work out the kinks.  The service has greatly improved, but the food... UGH!  How can you mess up CHICKEN?   I ordered both the Saffron Chicken and the Roasted Chicken.  They were horrible.  I took them home and fed them to my dogs.  That's expensive dog food.  As I write this review, I am stuffing my face with a bag of popcorn from Costco to get the ""ewe"" feeling out of my stomach.  Anyway, the lukewarm and bland food will eventually drive people away.  You've got one more shot, Toros, before I throw in the towel.

644067,2014-03-04,1,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"Went here last night. Mondays are the night to go - 1/2 off tapas. It was busy, but probably because it was on a Monday.  Also, I liked that there is no smoking. 

They had a pretty good selection of tapas. We probably tried about half of them.  Here is the list: 
Pil Pil Shrimp - came out sizzling hot in a cast oven pan. The shrimp were good sized, I think there were five or six shrimp in butter, garlic and other seasonings. 

Calamari - Tried both the fried and the grilled. I liked the grilled calamari better than the fried. Decent portion size, not huge but it is tapas. The calamari was still tender and the grilled had a great flavor and was served on squid ink.  The fried, still good, a light batter. There was one sauce missing, it is supposed to come with marinara and two aioli's but it only had one aoili.  

Striped seabass - This could easily by a small meal, one piece of fish.  It was still tender. I liked the onion and peppers it was served with. The fish in itself did not have much flavor. 

Stuffed piquito peppers - There were two in the order. I could have ate a whole plate. Grilled peppers stuffed with gooey cheese - need I say more. 

Fried Manchego - I love cheese curds, and this was like the spanish rendition. The manchego was a little salty, but Manchego is.  There are three wedges provided - it was tasty but a bit greesy I may skip this in the future. 

Pan Bohli - Two pieces of breach with serrano ham and cheese on it.  Good, a little greasy as they grilled the bread - but nothing really noteworthy so I probably would skip this again. 

I can't remember the name but sausage on potato - the waitress recommended this. It was good but I would probably not get this again. There were four servings/pieces - the sausages were about an inch long and although they had good flavor they were a little tough. They were sitting an a small mound of mashed potatos. 

The normal tapas price ranged from $6-$9 approximately. For the size of the items I think the price is a little high for the amount you get, but for 1/2 days it is a steal. We also got a pitcher of red sangria ($26) - it was okay, but not very sweet and had a more prominent wine taste than you normally get in most sangria's. I prefer it to be a bit sweeter. 

I was also impressed that they had Estrella beer on draft (the only place I have seen it) and $6 for a 16 oz poor which is good. Their wine list was also reasonably priced and although small they had some decent wines, not the normal Chateau St. Michelle etc you always see. I can't remember the list but I noted that they had Tobin James Cab. 

The waitress was nice and the food came out quick. Also they have half off sangria on Thursdays and happy hour from 4-6pm and 11pm-2am with 20% off tapas, and drink discounts for beer, wine and well.  Overall I liked it here for the price, I would come back on Mondays or during happy hour.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,4,wiRNdcbxYVa9sm_OfzEW2Q

The bartender refused to order the meal for the one person in our party who wanted to eat. No employee came over to seat us, & last time I checked customers aren't supposed to choose a table & seat themselves. Since the bartender was being neglectful & rude, we decided to finish up drinks & leave. When we were paying, the bartender began arguing with some of our party. She had an attitude the whole time we were there, did not bring us our chips/salsa, refused to put in a meal order, & was argumentative. It's a shame because the margaritas were really good. One of our party posted a review after we left last night & then received a private message from someone named Luz who told her she was a negative person (which I can assure you she isn't) & then Luz posted a 5 star review to try to cancel the 1 star review.

1441652,2013-12-08,0,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"So we went in for dinner.  Having been to numerous tapas restaurants before we knew what to expect- basically small sharing portions.

First- it was FREEZING in there.  Half the patrons were still bundled wearing their coats (I being one of them).  And, we were seated no where close to the door.

Second- the music was so loud that our waiter missed some of the dishes that a guest at our table ordered.  The items that we ordered, I felt like I was screaming, I had to repeat a few times until they were clearly understood.

Third- Our waiter was horrible (and not because he couldn't hear orders over the music).  When we first entered, it was fairly early dinner time.  There were other folks sitting and being waited on.  Not us.  Finally, he arrived took our drink orders.  Then he disappeared.  Drinks dropped off.  Again, he disappeared.  Time passed, he ran by dropped off bread.  Disappeared.  At the time, we were is only table.  After about 20+ minutes he finally came by to get our food order.  Disappeared.  He only reappeared to toss some food on the table.  Finally able to flag him down and ask for more bread (I wanted it to sop up some yummy morsels I left on my plate).  Without asking, he just grabbed my plate and told me I could get a clean one.  The whole point was I didn't want and clean one.  It is also a pet peeve of mine when a waiter/waitress touches my plate without asking..... It was at that point we informed him that some of our food was missing.  So, after a longer wait (at this point the place was filling up) we finally completed our meal.

Fourth- Pricing.  Again, we know tapas.  But somehow, the prices did not match at all to what you were getting.  Firstly, It's located in a very ""family"" style community.  There is another restaurant catty cornered to this one.  They understand this concept and although they are considered a ""tavern"" are constantly packed because of the family friendly prices and atmosphere.  Secondly, I personally don't think that paying $8 for 'tempura artichoke hearts' (when 3 pieces come on the plate, they were barely a mouthful each, and they obviously used canned artichoke) is worth it.

Overall, despite the pricing, most of the food was good. The 'sliced trio of Chorizo' was extremely greasy and oily.  'Bacon wrapped dates"" I've had better.  Bacon was nearly burnt, they were served over shredded lettuce that made no sense, and there was no sauce. The 'Gambas con Arroz' for the price ($8) was worth it.  My only issue with that was again, canned mushrooms and canned peas.  

At this point, I think I'll stick to my other tapas restaurants.  I feel they are a much better value.  For dessert (because I couldn't take the waiter anymore, I was uncomfortable frozen, and the music being so loud we couldn't have a conversation) we opted to go to the grocery store across the parking lot.",SXdiFSfvp2MstzUn96Fvdg,1,1,2,HPCPrgfHH5S69wkwn9MpLw

Being a long time Tapas fan, and with Firefly in the news every other week, we really wanted to like this place. After reading mixed reviews, I was concerned, and hungry...ok, more hungry than concerned.

I have a rule about new places. I assume that the servers know what's best. I often ask the servers to bring me the best, and leave it at that. Some servers shudder, some embrace the challenge, some know their menu so well, they barely blink before deciding what to bring. Our server, Omar, was the third type. He quickly decided on three items, all perfect, then two more, still perfect. What did we have? Well, come on by and ask your server. You see, our drinks and menu items were tailored to our tastes. Your experience may be different, but I hope, equal to our experience.

I saw a lot of poor reviews from a few months ago, but my understanding is that they have a new chef. Check it out, it may be better than you had previously experienced.

Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day.

The decor is a little odd, flags all around the bar, and near 100 or so pier one type tin lanterns with the stars punched out (you know the kind...).  Booths all in one corner, and large enough to fit 8, I personally don't like high tops, so sitting here felt super odd.  
We sat waiting for a waitress to come over for about 5 minutes while it wasn't busy at all... not the end of the world, but something you defiantly note the first time you go somewhere new.  Being a spanish tapas place I ordered chicken nachos and my hubby ordered the chorizo, meatballs, and bacon wrapped dates (all tapas).  I know that tapas are served as their done, but being that nachos are chips on a plate, cheese, and then into a salamander to melt i totally thought those would be first.  No wrong, all 3 of his dished were served at the same time the bread was brought out... like literally less than 5 min after ordering.  I thought it to be strange at first, but upon tasting it was clear this was all reheated food.  The chorizo was hard, like the texture of a giant slim jim that had been left on a counter for a week.  The dates just rated off, almost as if the oil they'd been fried in had dent been changed in quite a long time.  The meatballs didn't gross me out as the other two did, but hey, you can keep those sitting in sauce and it'll keep well.  
I had moderate hopes for my nachos as they were hopefully freshly prepared being that they were not served immediately.  nope.  
Now its not hard to make nachos, as described earlier.  When I ordered I asked if the optional chicken was shredded or chunks, and our waitress said shredded, I was expecting the type of cooked in a salsa, until the chicken falls apart shred.  This was like canned chicken sent through a food processor, more baby food than ""shreds"".  
In addition to this, the plate consisted of chips, shredded cheese(not fully melted btw), and olives. No peppers, no salsa, no sour cream, a plate of chips with cheese, olives and chicken.  
So none the less we won't be back, I can't see where these good reviews came from, we did go on a sunday afternoon, so maybe at the slower times you get the crappy food? I don't know.",n1MUh0PfMHdUmDkB1hXSYA,9,2,1,BWWI8hInfrbMXgypLz8KBw

2124880,2013-11-12,1,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"A lot of restaurants send out appetizers on small plates and call them tapas, but for a truly authentic menu of Spanish classics there are only three choices that I know of in Las Vegas- TOROS, Jaleo and Julian Serrano. The only real difference between the food at the other two is that those places cost about two to three times more!
 
I have been to TOROS three times now and I have tried almost everything on the menu (including four types of their Pallea!). Having authentic Spanish food brings back great memories of the times I spent living in Spain, the amazing sights and the friendly people.  I have been to Jaleo and Julian Serrano at least half a dozen times each, and they, like TOROS, are spot-on when it comes to authenticity.  

Brian B. said that the pitchers of Sangria seemed expensive but at four glasses per pitcher that works out to $7.50 per glass.  It seems pretty reasonable for hand crafted and properly made sangria, especially since it's basically impossible to find even a cheap glass wine for $7.50 a glass.  I also read another comment about only having one beer on tap, but they didn't mention that it is Estrella Damm one of the most popular beers in Spain.  Having a real Estrella with authentic tapas is actually a thoughtful, authentic touch at TOROS.

While eating at TOROS I met several people that actually have experience with genuine Spanish cuisine from having lived or traveled a lot in Spain or having gone to very authentic Spanish restaurants, like the reviewer Anarae A.  They all agreed that TOROS is amazingly authentic.  If there is something on the menu that you are not familiar with, just open your mind to something different and enjoy the flavors and culinary style of old-world España at TOROS!",hA1a7Q38JDodC8Zf2GYFBA,3,1,5,fzr_MbgmPb_wVl8hlRyD8A

Ambiance: Empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 8:30pm. Hip hop - pop music at Spanish restaurant. Gang members with unconcealed weapons and lit cigarettes in a non smoking restaurant. 

Food: seafood was rotting and had to be returned.  Even the sangria was poorly made, although drinkable.    Rice pudding had decent flavors but was not finished cooking (rice was hard and liquid had not yet been absorbed).  Oxtail was good. Ahi tuna is tasteless. Fried artichokes are sour and runny.

The restaurant is VERY dark inside but I enjoyed the music that was played there - your traditional top pop hits. 

I was given the late night menu which consisted of several types of tacos a la carte and fajitas. After reading other Yelp reviews with the issue of food being just warm and not hot, I thought that getting the chicken/beef fajitas would ensure the best chances of getting my food hot.

Since it was slow, the food came out fast. The
Fajitas come with the fideo soup with noodles and it was just warm, not at all hot. Right behind it however the fajitas were already out and came with 3 corn tortillas. They do charge for extra tortillas here, but the 3 that come with the entree simply aren't enough.

The portion was pretty good and enough for two people. The rice and beans plate was very nice. At this point I ask for chips and salsa again as I had asked for it earlier. The green salsa especially is excellent. The red salsa definitely tasted fresh though.

In all, the experience was good. It isn't a place that would be my first choice on any given night, but if you select your food wisely, you should come out with a decent experience.",zPf0o5w4LH5vm5iF2Clpkg,1,0,3,QWOQsQoDWCB5xTloyJei9w

Now I am as girly as they come for drinks, I like them sweet as can be and this was not it.

Thankfully the bartender went in and fixed my drink after I has asked. The food came out and after more convincing I ordered a fire tortilla soup with totally different expectations for what came out. The soup was a tomato paste mess and I didn't want to send back yet another thing. Overall the service was tentative but the food hit a low.

Moving on to the service, the host had zero personality and mumbled everything. Our server was pretty good, but the food took at least 20 minutes to get out. For Mexican food, that is far too long.  The salsa with the chips and salsa tasted store bought. The only redeeming quality was the chips. They were good. 

The entrees were pretty bad. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, drive far away from this place. If you are looking for sub par Mexican food, then this is the place for you.  The tortas tasted like Greek gyros. The tacos were ok, the carnitas was seasoned well, the shrimp was masked by globs of guacamole, and the carne asada was dry and tasteless.

So of course, I expect a bowl of Albóndigas. But when my food arrived, it didn't look anything near Albóndigas. This was just by sight. It looked really dark red-brown. I said okay, this is different. I took my first taste of the broth. It tasted nothing like Albóndigas. I tried the meatball next which was by far worst. It was like a spaghetti meat ball mixed with pre cooked Mexican rice. I asked the waiter to bring me another dish to replace it because it was horrible. I ordered ""sopa de fideo"". It arrived, by sight it looked normal. So I tried it. The broth was great until I got the noodles that seemed like broken spaghetti pasta. The fideo was never fried before making the soup. Anyhow, I let the waiter know. In fact the waiter was a Mexican lady who spoke perfect Spanish. I told her I'm Spanish "" this food you brought me wasn't albondigas nor sopa de fideo"" she said ""I don't know I'm just the server"" I relied, but you know how the traditional taste like.

Toros is actually a gaming restaurant as well & I do appreciate that it's a NON-SMOKING gaming restaurant. That actually why I gave this place 5 star rating instead of a 4.

Cocktails- when you text Toros to 99158 , you can get a free drink! So I did & my first cocktail was Strawberry Bojito! It tasted like a Mojito & I'm a fan. My second drink was a white sangria. Oh gosh, worse sangria I ever had. lol only bad thing about this whole review was that darn white sangria. 

For foods! 
Stuffed Piquillo Peppers 7$- It was stuffed with crabmeat and goat cheese swimming in a tomato sauce. BUT, it only comes out with 2 peppers (as seen on my picture) so when it came out, me & the beau looked at each other like ""that's it?"" But boy was it delicious! 

Sliders $9- those were cute. I didn't really think anything special about it. Only thing different about it is it had a slice of ham in it which added a bacon effect to it. 

Seared salmon $8- one of the best salmons I ever had! It came out with sautéed spinach which was so good! It was laid on a garlic sauce which was oozing with flavors! 

Meatballs 7$- It comes with 3 juicy meatballs. Nothing really to say but it was delicious! 

Buffalo wings $12- of course everywhere we go we the beau ALWAYS has to get buffalo wings! These were really spicy and it came out with a spicy aioli dipping sauce! That really made those chicken wings memorable! 

Flan- & for Dessert, my favorite! It was the perfect amount of sweetness and was the perfect size to end our meal. 

The waitress was new but she had a lot of knowledge about the items. She was honest  about not trying most of the foods yet but gave us direction on popular items.

She said there was a party of 15 that has been seated but wanted to put our order in first so we wouldn't need to wait so long. Wow! Now that is some great service.

The interior is pretty cool and doesn't look too much like a restaurant or a bar, but a neat combination of the two.

While you're waiting they serve you chips and salsa. The chips have that authentic, home-made crunch and taste. I'm pretty sure they make it in the restaurant and are terrific.

The carna asada tacos are to die for. Not only do they taste amazing, they are like $2.50 each. 3-4 of these and you'll be pretty filled. DON'T get the fish tacos because they were less than stellar. If you want seafood then get the shrimp tacos.

I ordered the carne asada bowl and for the price you get a pretty big bowl. The ingredients taste really fresh and appetizing. The best part is all the food came out in less than 10 minutes. Not only was the service great but speedy.

It's not a bad place, but overall this is a pure Red Blooded American Restaurant, that serves $15 tacos ($19 if you sub shrimp) & plays country music & soft rock. You know, to make sure it doesn't come across as ""Too Mexican"".

I ordered their house margarita and it tasted like a combo margarita tonic drink. Very watered down and only had a couple gulps before I switched to something else. The place was not busy, but it took forever to get my steak fajita. The server came by three times to say it would be out shortly. While the portions were large the meal had way too much salt on it for my liking. Had a few bits, but left 80% of it. Also I was disappointed that they do not offer the green and red salsa plus bean dip with the complimentary chips as they use to in the past.

This time here, we ordered appetizers we've had before like the Ahi.  It was rather bland and definitely not as good as the past visits.   The seafood soup was mediocre at best as well.

It would seem perhaps that different cooks are preparing different days, and some of them are better than others perhaps.

The chips oily with no salt... they serve this soupy bean sauce and a very bland generic salsa ""sauce"" with the chips turns out the same beans are what they serve with your dinner.  After trying some, I asked for that traditional simple cup of soup that you really can't screw up.  When dinner arrived, I requested cheese to maybe thicken the ""beans""  and add some flavor and it was very fake flavorless cheese!  The rice is Uncle Ben's with frozen vegetables way too many for my taste.  This rice did not resemble Spanish rice at all.  The only thing I ate was the Shrimp.  When I first walked in I thought the place looked great and the manager and server April were very nice people.  The bartender just walked around with a scowl and food in her mouth most of time where I was having nothing to do but really observe the place.  The three basics I think you expect at any Mexican restaurant whether it be authentic or not are decent beans rice chips and salsa...they need to work on that.  As far as the pictures posted here wow I should have looked at those and maybe would have had a better meal.  Regardless, I will not eat here again.

Having read a few positive reviews and since this place is pretty close to our home, we thought why not.  The weather was in the high 70's today and nothing is as good as a cool crisp sangria on a warm spring day.  Of course the sangria has to have some flavor, which this one did not 

Our server was good and very attentive.  The place was pretty empty but it was 4:30 so it was to be expected. We asked our server for some recommendations and ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the scallops, the sliders, some shrimp and the peppers. Everything was just ok. The dates were not as good as Fireflys and we only received 3 of them. The scallops had a sauce made with cinnamon that was a little off putting and the shrimp were way over cooked and had zero flavor. I couldn't talk my husband into eating the last slider either. 

Our bill was $60 which is pretty expensive considering how small all the portions were, it was also supposed to be happy hour but they only discount their Tapas 20% off the regular price.

Our server was friendly and helpful. Service began with a basket of bread. Orders are submitted to the kitchen electronically table side. The orders were delivered fairly quickly. 
The Angus Sliders (3 to an order) were tasty and have a smoke paprika flavor. If you look at the inside of the burger it may seem to be under cooked but it is actually the paprika that's mixed with the meat. The Sizzling Chili Shrimp (5 to an order) are very good. Use the bread to soak up the sauce, YUM.  Sweet Piquillo Peppers stuffed with Crab Meat are delicious. They come 2 to an order and are served in a tomato sauce. This is another winner.
A pitcher of White Sangria was reasonably priced and had a nice fruit flavor. 
The menu has a good variety of items which calls for a few return trips.

Upon entering there was no one manning the reception desk. My self and the duo in front of me both thought it was ""seat yourself establishment"".  

To my surprise a man came running around the corner and attempted to seat is both.  We still had to grab our own menus from the counter and carry them to our seats.

Upon being seated  I was finally able to take in the ambiance and decor.  The place was overall very dimly lit. The chairs and tables were of all of a different color and seated very close together.  The place is not very big, and when I went into the bathroom for a pre meal hand washing; I was greater by a man splashing water all over place as he scrubbed his face, head and entire arms.  

Now to the service and food. Our waitress took a long time to get there and they seemed confused on who was actually going to serve us.  We ordered three taco salads and some cheese enchiladas (Also, the customary chips with salsa and bean dip while you wait.)  

The chips were super oily and had that fried in left over oil taste.  The beans were standard and I was not a fan of the sweet salsa.  

We also had to send some of the dinning utensils  back as they had caked on food still from the precious use. (Almost left then, but the food was already ordered.)

The food arrived in short time which was a positive.  The taco shells to the salads seemed to be fried in the same (whatever) the chips were cooked in. Non of us were impressed with the salad which consisted of a little bit of meat, that was over seasoned, and a bunch of lettuce.  

All this occurred on a Sunday about 2 in the afternoon, and they were not busy at all.  I would hate to this place during a Friday night.

Whether it's the taco plate or the chicken enchiladas (go with the red chili sauce; the green couldn't be more mild), you'll be in good shape eating here.

That being said, the service was absolutely horrible.  It's a Sunday afternoon, and there are four parties outside and about four inside.  Two servers, one bartender, one busser.  Still took ten minutes after seating for the server to come to take a drink order.  We then ordered drinks and a side of a guacamole to have in advance, which came out right away... But no chips.  We ask the busser for chips and she says she'll be right back.  10 minutes go by.  Ask the other server: she says she has to get our server to help us out.  8 more minutes.  Finally one of us just go back to the server and ask for chips to eat the guacamole with.

Oh, our appetizers was plain nachos and it taste like pepperoni pizza rolls with guacamole and sour cream on top.  The pizza rolls itself taste better than their nachos. It seems like they fried their chips and then added cheese and baked it and then added the pico, guacamole, and sour cream.

We ordered a pitcher of Sangria for $26.  Way to high!  It was about 6:30 when we got there so we just missed happy hour but really for a local neighborhood bar I would probably be a frequent visitor if that happy hour was all day or even if there were more drink specials available.  Like John Cutter next door you can get a free drink by signing up by text.

For tapas we chose the calamari, ceviche, and the chicken skewers.  A complimentary bread basket with dipping sauce was also provided.  I have no complaints about the food and the tapas were fairly priced.  The restaurant was larger then it appeared outside but almost empty minus a couple other tables.

The Saffron chicken a disapointment. No flavor, no seasoning, no saffron. Looked like a turmeric puree on top of chicken.

It has so much potential but with the service and price it's just a disappointment.  Just about anything else could be better and it's too bad anything else isn't in this shopping center.

3970125,2014-06-16,4,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"I watched this place sit idle during the Great Recession and then was so pleased to see something going in there when the economy improved.  Toros Spanish Kitchen & Gaming is a good addition to the small shopping center.

We stopped last night and had dinner.  I had looked over the menu online but I wanted to look at theirs in house as there were other items than the tapas I'd seen online.  Our server brought iced tea.  We had to wait a bit to catch the server's eye to get some Sweet 'n Low but eventually we got it.

The complimentary toasted slices of bread were nice.  I used it more for a pusher than anything else.  

I ordered three items to start_an order of sautéed mushrooms in garlic and sherry wine, gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce (I thought I'd be able to sneak the shrimp past my wife), and last, an order of croquetas with ham, cream cheese, and béchamel.  

The winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp.  When my wife got to the one shrimp I hadn't been able to screen out with the spoon, that was all for her.  Score for me--I finished the dish.  The gnocchi were soft and the shrimp, although small, were good.  It was a nice combination.  Next, the garlic mushrooms were really good.  Sautéed nicely in garlic and sherry, the mushrooms were very good.  The disappointing dish for me was the croquetas.  They were very light and had hardly and body to them yet it was difficult to pick them up.  They broke in half.  There was not a béchamel sauce but a marinara like sauce.

We decided not to order more.  The three dishes were filling--well almost.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake.  It takes 15 minutes to make (the menu states this clearly so if you're in a hurry, order early).  The lava cake was rich chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A nice way to end a good dinner.

Service was spotty.  Our server seemed to be nowhere in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tables on each side of us seemed to be at those tables all the time and the place was not that crowded.  During dinner, the owner came around to ask how things were and the personal touch is always appreciated.  It's also very good business.  The spotty service kept me from giving Toros four stars.

I thought the pricing was very fair.  If you subtract the desert we had from the bill, the total would equal about what I paid for 1 person at another tapas place and I left hungry.  Two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feeling hunger.

We need to come back and try some of the other dishes.  I also need to come back with some friends and without my wife.  There are items I'd like to try from the menu that she won't eat!  Her loss.  Time for a UYE?",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,4,3,WQlxRit7wPqTmAeVV-eHmQ

-Smoke Free
-TV Screens (a lot of them and perfect for the game)
-Great Service
-Spacious Joint
-Inexpensive mini dishes (i.e. tapas)
-Happy Hour Specials (look for the red star on the menu)
-New Establishment
-Not too busy

Tapas (My Rankings):
-Oxtail:  My goodness, this is good..ness.  It's a bit rich, but nothing beat their fall off the bone oxtail.  Perfect with rice. 

-Asparagus:  Grilled to perfection. I think I can eat two orders on my own.  

-Bacon Wrapped Dates:  Pretty good.  Not sure what was better, the bacon or the dates.  Regardless, still tasty.  

-Meatballs:  Not the best that I've had, but a good addition if you're looking to add some meat to your diet.  My opinion, the sauce was a little runny. 

There's a lot more that I've tried and a lot more on their menu that I haven't tried.  For now, it's their oxtail and asparagus that keeps me wanting more. Thumbs up for price, value, and selection.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,3,4,nLrM5TNK8OkdcV190o6lLA

Wished I had gone on Monday because they have half-off tapas all day!  I will absolutely be back on a Monday for that- the tapas were all pretty good.  I was expecting the eggplant salad to be warm, but it was still OK.  The eggplant salad was a slice of grilled (cold) eggplant, topped with a plum tomato that seemed skinned and maybe marinated in vinegar, and some goat cheese crumbles.  Not bad but would be better if it was warm in my opinion.  The bacon-wrapped dates were excellent, and the artichoke hearts were exactly what I was expecting though I don't think I'd order the artichoke again.  The seafood and chicken paella is hard for me to compare because that was my first time having paella.  It all tastes the same in the paella to me so it's like whether you eat a piece of calamari or rice or sausage it all just tastes the same.  It was OK.  They definitely are not chintzy with the paella order- it is enough for 6- 8 people!  Ironically the free bread and some sort of spicy red-pepper aioli or whatever came with it was my favorite thing here!  I could not get enough of that damned free bread and aioli!

4484613,2017-05-29,2,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"We entered the patio just as the guitarist literally hit the last note of his final set.  We sat outside anyway, since it was warmer out than in.  

It was our first visit to Toros, and I was a little leery, knowing that it was the same ownership as John Cutter.  We had a Groupon for Toros, and recall having a miserable experience at Cutter's when we went with what I think was an entertainment.com certificate, when the waitress refused to accept it, stating trumped-up reasons - (used in its original, non-capitalized sense).

It was a whole different ballgame at Toros.  We were greeted warmly by our very good waiter, whose name wasn't given, though I did have a great opportunity to speak with him in Spanish.
The wines by the glass didn't appeal to me, so I ordered the house margarita.  I thought it was very reasonably priced, and then this very small drink appeared.  But it was perfect for me, since I have no capacity for booze and shouldn't be drinking anyway.  And I'm way too short to ever reach the top of the straw to guzzle the giant ones served at other places!

The complimentary chips were thicker than usual, but warm and mercifully unsalted.  The red sauce was thick and spicy, the green a tad milder, but both were very good. Herb ordered chicken fajitas (he needs to get them tatooed on his chest; it would save time, since he almost always has them).  It was a gigantic portion of tender chicken, with a side plate of green rice, pico de gallo, sour cream, and a generous scoop of guacamole.

I ordered the chicken in mole.  When it first hit the table I was dismayed to see two large breasts, each with a bone.  But then I realized that they were frenched, so the only bones were at the end of those thick, juicy hunks of hen.  The mole sauce was pretty tasty, but was the least spicy mole I've ever tasted.  It could actually be taken up a notch or two.  It was accompanied by refried beans, a large portion of rice that had some peas and diced carrots, and it was the first time I can ever remember having rice in a Mexican restaurant that wasn't mush and obviously straight from a steam table.  It also wasn't oversalted.  The garnishes were also unusual: a bit of salad, pickled carrot, onion and jalapeno slices, and wonder of all, roasted chayote.  That would have been fabulous all by itself, but someone in the kitchen forgot to peel it.

Those two big plates of food made for a great second meal for both of us, and even without the Groupon, it would have been a very reasonable check.  Given that we eat late and are always scrounging for places that are open when we're hungry, we're delighted to learn that the kitchen is open 24/7, though the patio closes at midnight.  It's relatively quiet outside, but the music from inside is loud, very loud and very eclectic, from heavy metal, to rap, to ...... Sinatra???  I guess it's the law in this town.  

We definitely look forward to going back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,4,4,FLPAhYv_1iyIb7y1Gepcqw

Everything that we ordered before the main course was bland;salad, ""saffron"" chicken, bacon wrapped dates, calamari. All had no taste. The chicken tasted like chicken soup base with boiled chicken. The worst offender was our main course, the seafood paella. 

For a $36 shared entree you would expect something tasty that you can't wait to go back again for, but it was awful. the paella was. It honestly tasted like rancid vegetable oil with boiled vegetables and mushy rice. I couldn't find any chorizo or chicken which would have added flavor. The seafood was there, but guess what? Totally lacking in any kind of seasoning. The clams were also full of sand and it was very unpleasant having spit out grains of and with each bite.

Tonight, I came in for dinner and drinks, and the service hit the tipping point. We got seated and there was only one other table with people at it, plus 3-4 people sitting at the bar. The server came over right away and took our drink order. A few minutes later, she brought us chips and salsa - great! 5 minutes later, we were still waiting for drinks. Another 5 minutes goes by, the server comes over and says she's asked the bartender (Dusty) to make our pitcher if marsh several times, but she's on her own timeline...ummm okay. 

I'm sitting at the table watching Dusty chat with people at the bar, dance around, etc. If it was super busy, I'd totally have understood...but she's literally just chatting with people. I see our server ask her for our drinks again...then the bartender leaves the bar to go play a game of Big Buck Hunter. 

At this point, I'm laughing hysterically - what is happening right now?! Is this real life? 

Finally, about 20-25 minutes after we sat down, our drinks come. We waited to order entrees, but if he hadn't, we surely would have had them before our drinks came. When drinks came, our server apologized again, but this was clearly not her fault. 

I want to love this place - I want to be here every weekend; all I'm asking is decent service.

Other than the bar, the rest of the seating was high 4 top tables with bar chairs. The overall feel was stripmall. There wasn't much in the way of Mexican décor. A few pieces here and there and a Dia de los Muertos couple prop at the ""hostess stand"". We sat quickly and our server was there before we could even get to page 2 of the menu. We opted for a couple margaritas while we decided on our food. The drinks were a bit sweet, but tasty. Right amount of salt and enough tequila to taste.
I went with the Chili Verde and the wife did the Chili Rellenos. I have had Chili Verde in quite a few places as it is one of my favorites. This one was a little weak in the meat department, but the tomatillo influence was definitely there. It comes with a cilantro pesto type rice and black beans. The crispy onions seemed a bit weird, but it's just a garnish. In the end, I mixed it all together in a bowl and added the salsa and beans from the chips on the table. Not too bad, but I was still seeking meat. Overall, it was good, just not fabulous. Pricing is on par was most other places, so no worries there.
According to my better half, the rellenos were good. They were filled well, cooked great and tasty. She and I had worked on the chips and salsa quite a bit, so she opted for eating one chili and taking the rest home. I know she enjoyed the second one that night (as I finished what I had brought home). Again, price was right on target as most other places.
Overall, Toros is a good place to come to. The food is tasty, the service quick and courteous and the drinks pretty good. Check for any coupons that may be out there.",QD3eqZPXh4Ft9rfdRjULFA,0,0,4,Nm-1rTKRKbQ_iBnLW-ub9w

5620538,2013-12-15,7,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"It's ""TAPAS,"" not ""TOPLESS.""

This restaurant located at the corner of W. Charleston and Desert Foothills opened on November 1st, brought to us by the same group who run John Cutter right next door.  
I enjoy tapas places because you get to sample lots of small plates, ordering more of those you like.  It's a mini-buffet that comes to your table.

Our group of four ordered:
-bacon wrapped dates:  unlike another tapas place in town, these are really dates wrapped in bacon.  The dates are not stuffed with anything except their own sweetness.  Solid.
-meatballs:  I needed a dish with more protein, so I ordered these.  Nothing spectacular.
-bread and butter:  carbs!  
-oxtail:  my favorite dish of the night, which I only had to share with one friend.  I could have had another order all to myself.  Fall-off-the-bone meat and a nice sauce to go with it.
-ahi:  I'm allergic to fish, so I only looked at this.  The friends liked it.
-garlic shrimp:  I had one.  Nothing special.
-asparagus:  this was another winner for me.  The grilled spears tasted great.
-croquetas:  deep-fried cream cheese, bechamel sauce, and ham (I think)--what's not to like?  I liked.
-manchego cheese:  served in three chunks with some toasted bread on the side.  I like this cheese, but wish it had been sliced for us, or at least give us a cheese slicer so we can do it ourselves.
-Serrano ham:  too salty, but that's just me.
-flan:  YUM!  The sauce has cinnamon in it.  My pal could have done without the cinnamon, but I loved it.

I also had a glass of the red sangria, which was not too strong, just the way I like it.
Our server, Omar, was very attentive the whole night and the food came out very quickly.
The bar in the middle of the room has video poker machines and there are several flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant, so this is a great place to come and watch sports in a non-smoking environment and with good food that isn't your typical bar fare.
Overall, a great time was had by all.  It's a welcome addition for the locals who live in the neighborhood and we'll definitely be back.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,15,7,4,RHC2hyRJXyU8WLAoOIy5Fw

5774653,2015-07-12,5,WlBvw6R1Qe2yIaZp-2ilZA,"Please save yourself time and money! This place is terrible. We wish we would have read the reviews before going!

At first walk up we thought the place was promising with some live music outside, walk in, and there's no host to greet us, we kinda stood around waiting until what I think was a server directed us. 

Our server seemed nice enough to start with and even took some time to try and fix the wobbly table. 

We were served the chips and salsas to start , they weren't all that bad, really the chips saved 

Our Server offered us the guac as a starter.....yea yuck, it tastes prepackaged and old. They try saving it by dousing it with a crap load of lemon but we're not fooled, this is not fresh!

We let the server know we wanted to send it back as it didn't taste fresh, if you've ever had an avocado or guac that is starting to brown and isn't fresh you know the EXACT flavor I'm referring to. Instead of apologizing and taking the dish away she proceeded to inform us that we were the first to ever complain about the guac.

At this point we are really concerned about the quality of the food but we're hopeful.
My husband had the tacos, I had the carne Asada cheese fries and my sister had the ceviche and 1 taco.

When the food came out we realized this was definitely not an authentic place and more so a tex-mex place -- really though that would be a compliment to what we were served.

Taco plate- tortillas were cold and stale. Meat was chewy, rice was not Mexican, it was green for god sake.

Carne Asada fries--- I could get better fries at a high school football game. These were loaded with what seemed like cheese whiz, old pico de gallo, sour cream and of course the gross guac the server offered to make sure wouldn't be on any of our dishes.

Ceviche - again NOT Mexican and NOT FRESH. It had this weird blackish grey color to it. And the flavor was lacking.

At this point the server should have came by to check on us and make sure the food came out as expected (without the guac as she herself had offered) but 20min later we still hadn't seen her. 

My husband had one taco, I had a small section of the fries and my sister had a few bites of the ceviche, we decided this just really wasn't something we could consume or pay for. Our server finally came to check on us we let her know we weren't happy with the food. Again she proceeded to inform us that their food has a lot of flavor and clearly we can't handle all the flavors. WHO TALKS TO CUSTOMERS THIS WAY? After a few more comments about how this is her favorite food and the chef is Mexican she offered to get the GM over. He took over 10min to come and speak with us, we let him know we weren't happy with the food. Apparently he doesn't even know what his own dishes look like or didn't take the time to find out what we had been served in those 10 min because he responded to my husband with ""well you don't like the food but you didn't even touch yours, but yea ok"" 

We let him know we had all actually tried our food, my husband had a taco as well as some meat from the other 2 tacos. It wasn't good. We offered to pay for the margarita and the taco but he refused and told us we could go. 

I don't know how long this place has been open, but with food that bad and the terrible service to go with it I don't know how this place expects to make it. I'd assume what's keeping them afloat is the bar.",yOoWadxWrA3wzIrq9VChew,8,2,1,keEhaq_MC1veh6Bse9id-g
