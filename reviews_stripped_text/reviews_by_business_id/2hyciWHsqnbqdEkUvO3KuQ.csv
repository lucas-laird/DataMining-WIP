179099,2017-11-23,2,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"A friend of mine were going to watch champions league soccer. When i stepped in, it had a great english atmosphere.  The female bartender was very nice and pleasant.

I was shocked at the lack of TVs and not having all TVs on a Champions league game , as i arrived at 11am , when games start at 1045. I was shocked that a so called english pub would not be prepared to have every TV not airing 

When i say this , i say the following 100% truthfully. I never in 5 years have had extreme gas and diarrea eating at any establishment, let alone my EDR at work. 

I ordered the burger and it took time to prepare as it took sone time for another patrons food. Hence im thinking this is the care cooks took in preparing food.

Within 15 minutes of finishing my meal i had to use the restroom and extreme runny diarrea . My friend even asked if i was ok.  I left and on the way home i had to pull over and again had extreme diarrea. As this lasted through the night.  UPDATE , my gas has subsided and it no longer causes me to run to bathroom 

Overall the experience sucked , except for the ambiance and waitress, who i might add did not thank for the tip. 

I would like a response from the general manager explaining why food was served that caused extreme diarrea and gas, as i never had this in 45 years let alone 5 years in vegas.",Va_HSFDO04zleU5vifQZnQ,0,0,2,jrXOpl5zPHnnX9S_iwNgPg

It's a interesting bar in an interesting location. The bar is like an island that is surrounded by a whole bunch of Asian food joints, i.e. the same plaza has a Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean food eateries. So it's kinda of odd to find a bar like this in this location. So be it! Good times to be had!  

Can't really say much about the food, since I didn't eat anything! So I'll have to see if they have decent bangers, chips, and mash on a later review.

303455,2012-10-17,3,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"After falling in love with the original Crown and Anchor I was excited to try the Little version.  I knew I was playing with fire since this location is on my way home from work and I could potentially wind up here more often than I would like.  But I guess luckily for me, the Little Anchor isn't as fun as its big brother.

It has a similar British/nautical theme as the original location, but it's not as dark and moody.  The bartenders are a little slower and the clientele a little clique-ier.  The bar was covered in food crumbs like it hadn't been cleaned in days.

We ordered onion rings and they were just awful.  I don't know how the breading managed to soak up 13 gallons of oil, but it did.  I took a bite and that was enough for me.

Basically, it's fine to stop at and grab a pint after work but I'd rather make the drive over to the original location if I want anything more than that.

1473807,2016-03-30,1,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"THIS BAR ILLEGALLY CHARGES EXTRA AMOUNTS ON YOUR RECEIPT. 

Total ACTUAL food and beverage charges on receipt (with tax) added up manually: $114.05
Total amount listed on bottom of bill: $124.05

A group of us went in on Saturday for trivia night. We had a voucher for $50 that we won a few weekends ago. They cannot split the voucher, so we were dividing the check out to apply the voucher ourselves. When doing this, we noticed the total on the bill was $10 higher than the total we got when manually adding up bill. When we brought it to our waitress' attention, she brought the receipt to the back. When she came back she let us know it was because of tax. We told her that didn't make sense because the restaurant tax was listed on the bill and liquor tax is included in the drink price... and it still wasn't adding up. She then called the bartender over (who claimed to be the manager). She sat down with an attitude from the beginning. First she said it was a true blue system and there was absolutely no way it was wrong. We asked her to add it up herself and see. She got the same total we did (not the total on the bill). Then, she tried to tell us it was the tax again. She got EXTREMELY rude when she figured out that she was wrong. THEN she told us we are getting $50 off because of a voucher we won (fair and square), and that we shouldn't even be worried about the $10. We told her we understood that, but the voucher is $50 voucher, not a $40 voucher, and their system cannot just add a random amounts to the total on the bill.  She yelled at us and told us we were no longer allowed to use vouchers at this restaurant (because that's obviously fair.....) In the end, our waitress (not the ""manager"" dealing with the situation) came back over and told us it was a glitch in their system (I thought it was a true blue system and couldn't be wrong?) and there was nothing they can do about it. This bar has been around for a few years and you still haven't noticed the system invisibly charges for Red Bull?? It was charging us for 2 red bulls but not listing them on the receipt. She illogically compared it to a mixer like Sprite... we told her Sprite is not listed because it is included with the price of the drink. If the mixer is not included in the drink price it has to be listed along with the amount. We felt so uncomfortable because of her terrible accusatory attitude from the get- go that we just paid the amount on the receipt and left. Had the ""manager"" sat down and said ""hey, that's really interesting...let me see why it's not adding up"" instead of blaming us and lying about it, everything would have went a little more smoothly. The owner (GM?) was also there that night and saw what was going on and avoided the whole situation as well. If you're going to try and charge people an invisible $10 on their bill, you should AT LEAST have good customer service. This bar is terrible.

The lamb itself wasnt very gamey tasting and had a present rosemary flavor to it. The slices themselves were fairly meaty with some fat for flavor. Gravy did an excellent job complementing the meat. Peas and carrots were your average canned sweet peas, the carrots were boiled down to the point where they were soft but mostly lost all their sweet carrotie goodness. The potato was interesting. Seemed they boiled it first then deep fried it to give it flavor and a crispy shell, potatoes are good... Yorkshore pudding wasnt exactly my favorite but who cares? We're here for lamb and we had some lamb.

Overall 10.95 is a bit pricey for the plate hence the three star instead of a four. If the slices were a bit thicker or maybe two more slices it would have been perfect and justifiable for the cost. In the end it was still a decent plate of lamb roast.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,3,fElWiPRKeV-DZLhSZ1ixxQ

2178497,2010-08-17,2,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"The Skinny: there's a reason why it's a pub - when you drink enough, the food has got to taste better (2), service - cute little Britney Spear-esque school girl outfits does not constitute good service unless - well, you're some place else (2), value - there's no value on bad food.

To sum up our experience: when we got into the car, the first thing my husband said was ""do you think I'll get sick from the chicken pot pie?""

We headed here looking for a slice of British fare, ordering fish and chips, chicken/leek pie, and a side salad.

To start, the chicken pot pie was absymal. Albeit the pastry was a nice flaky crust, the filling was sour and unpleasant. I have no idea why it was sour. Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.

The fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce. The chips were not crispy on the outside and were bleh.

The side salad was okay but the house vinegar/oil dressing had chunks of dried rosemary in it which made it unappetizing.

Finally, our waitress. We had to wave her several times to refill our drinks and she gave us the wrong check. I think she switched our check with the table next to us which is a bit mistake on her part (their check was 3x more than ours). I felt bad for her at the end of the day.

As someone who appreciates beer and British culture, I could see this place being fun to check out a football game or some great brews. As a person who is just coming for the food, I would suggest you spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,3,2,z0niEz2rmBY0h5y6BO52cw

The young Female Bartender is nice enough and the place seems semi clean.

I met some interesting people here and had some interesting conversations...it's a pretty laid back place.

I deducted 1 star because there was a malfunction with one of their video slot machines and they made me wait about an hour and a half to get my money about 120$ Dollars back. 

I waited and waited while they tried to verify that I had actually had put money in the machine, after they finally ""verified"" and gave me back my money.

I said, see ""I was telling the Truth"" I was told they believed me the whole time, yeah sure right lol...

However, did they offer me free drinks or food or even just a discount for my excessively long wait for them to straighten things out? 

Hell No, I paid full price for the meal and 4 Draft Beers.

Was hoping for a true pie like you'd get at a pub in London but their pie was a meat concoction in a baking dish with a crust baked on top. Crust was ok but the meat sauce was too tart for me and there was one tiny mushroom in the steak and ""mushroom"" pie.

3024276,2010-12-20,2,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"I love the original Crown & Anchor over by UNLV so I was pretty excited to see that there was a branch a little closer to home on the west-side of town.  I eagerly stumbled in on a cold, rainy night to imbibe in some traditional English brews, have some good pub food, watch some sports and try my hand at some video poker.  I should have stayed in the rain....

Service was fast and friendly but I was disappointed to learn that they only had an abridged menu for food.  My Smithwicks was a nice treat and made the shellacking I took on the video poker a little more palatable.   At least the beer would be free I reckoned, considering my 40 dollar donation I just gave to the machine.  I then decided on a bowl of clam chowder which was good in an unspectacular kind of way.  I watched some soccer they had on tv and then ordered a Harps as I needed something a little lighter.   So you're all thinking two stars....where's that coming from?  Well, let me tell you....I get my bill and both beers are on the tab.  For those of you that are not from Vegas, its a general rule of thumb that the bar takes care of at least one drink per 20 bucks played, more if there feeling generous.  I politely called this to my waitress attention and she said because I wasn't at the bar but at a side table with a machine, they charge.  I said that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard but not wanting to cause a scene, I gave her my money and promptly left.  

Considering there are hundreds of bars in town that wouldn't do a bush league thing like that, I have no need to ever go back there.  In fact, Im sure not even the main Crown & Anchor over on Trop would do that.  Im sure if I pressed the issue I could have had it resolved with a manager but the point is, I shouldn't have to do something like that.  Its akin to a restaurant charging for refills without saying they are and then you get the bill.  In today's society, complimentary soft drink  refills are standard so I shouldn't have to argue about that.  That's how I felt on this matter.  Im giving two stars because everything else was satisfactory and Im willing to give them a shot again down the road once my anger subsides...but if you must, do yourself a favor and head to the Tropicana location, you'll be a lot happier.",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,3,3,2,PmRX3s_L_7nIdQ0ayr9xwA

The first time I ever stopped in, I was supposed to be meeting up with my buddy Tien N. He totally stood me up, too....

LOL, actually, it was a miscommunication sort of thing, but I still tease him about standing me up that night. Anyway, as I sat there all glum and bummy (because none of my other friends wanted to hang out with me), I noticed something. There was a raffle going on. You could win hats, t-shirts, and what else?... BOOZE.

I had a ticket, but me being the unlucky person I am, I knew I wasn't going to win crap. This dude sat down next to me, and commented on me looking like a hipster, where I in turn, commented on him looking like some bum with a fake sports jersey on. Stunned by my snappy response, he apologized and offered up his name. Conversation died out, and soon he was munching on the food he had ordered.

The last raffle of the night, guess what? This dude wins!! He decided to take the bottle of Stoli. Then what does he do? Mutters, ""Merry Christmas..."", hands me the bottle, then promptly walks out. I was stunned. I guess he felt sorta bad..... By gads, it was a Christmas Miracle!!

Oh, and this older, semi-creepy gentleman was hitting on me, because I was there alone. Or maybe because it was simply because I had a vagina. Whatever the case, I explained to him about how I had been stood up, and he leans in and whispers ever so softly, ""That guy is a damn fool if he's gonna miss out on a girl like you."" Cue in Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away.""

Funny thing is, he was there the next time, when both Tien N. and Anthony M. were both there, and I pointed, then yelled, ""That's the dude that stood me up!!!"" Tien was just like, ""Huh?...."" Good times.

The ambiance is good, and everyone is pretty laid back. Accept for the crazy jukebox guy. That dude plays the worst music, but he's so happy about it, you can't help but feel good about what's assaulting your ears at that moment.

The food is actually really good! (Not the pea's lol but everything else!) They have the best kept secret happy hour angus beef bacon cheese burger with steak fries for $6 from 12a-8a as long as you order a drink. 

My only true tiff with this spot is that their liquor license does not allow them to serve liquor at their main bar, only wine and beers... They kindly added a mini side bar where you can sit with your cocktails so you can still drink liquor of but it's just kind of odd. 

One time I stepped on a cockroach in the bathroom but I have seen cockroaches in almost every restaurant in Chinatown so don't be so critical.",moPeVo2BVmpUC9HqTiR5_A,1,0,4,ZeDCaE8yhZY7uSk_vdz4dw

Cod was fresh and delicious.
However the service left a little to be desired, they only had one waitress. I know it's a small place but damn. It wouldn't have been that bad, but we had uninvited guests at our table who would not leave us alone (gnats) and we wanted our check ASAP. The table next to us were discussing dining and dashing, because they were going through the same thing.

Overall this place wasn't too bad.. If they get rid of the gnats and get some more servers I might just give them another shot.",WrRFGOhVCYJxCHyoTV38QA,0,0,3,QUXaP8dTft3Rc2Pivo72jQ

Apparently they have trivia there for bar patrons (and i'm told no one pulls fast ones googling the answers, they actually play the game) and while a friend and i were eating he was going through the questions just to keep us entertained. 

I'm not a huge beer drinker, so I usually stick to Boddingtons when I'm there, but the place looked to have a decent selection. I imagine less than the Trop location just based on the size of the place, but a nice selection none the less. 

Since i did go on a sunday night, I imagine it wouldn't have been packed. but it was perfect for what we were going for. which was a few beers and their chicken curry. The portion was pretty hefty and easily shared between two people. 

Since the other location is closer to my house i can see myself going to that one more often. but it was a super treat to get there last night. will probably be back just for Scooter.",Q8KF_RW1HaxMZsOLfJRmeg,1,0,5,ejglOUmAMTkbszCs9OMl6g
3993336,2010-08-15,2,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"I was very excited to try this pub with friends ever since they were voted best fish and chips way back when.

The server was quick to take my order.  I ordered an ice tea, onion rings appetizer, and the fish and chips of course.  The rings came out rather quickly and came with a side of ranch dressing.  Although they were lightly battered, they were literally dripping with oil, so much so there was a small pool of oil on the plate.  The fish and chips consisted of one medium sized piece of fish, thick cut fries, and a small bowl of peas.  The fish was above average, the breading was a touch on the heavy side.  The breading came off with a small amount of vinegar.  The tartar sauce was sweet, making it difficult to taste the relish or any other flavor.  The fries were nothing to write home about, looked overcooked and mushy and the peas were...peas.

The service was the worst part of dining here unfortunately.  Although our waitress was super cute (especially in her outfit) and nice, my ice tea took forever to be refilled and we usually had to request it.  When it came time to ask for the check, she gave us the check from the only other party in the pub.

I found out after walking inside that Little Crown & Anchor Pub offers the same all you can eat fish and chips for $13.95 on Mondays (5pm thru midnight) as its big brother does. Having never tried this AYCE special before, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity.

The first plate that they brought out was huge. I'm actually not sure that I would've been able to handle it fully had I been in optimal eating shape. There was a huge pile of chips, a perhaps-too-generous helping of peas, the battered fish (of course), a lemon slice, and a dipping portion of tartar sauce.

I think the crispy batter was the best part of the meal, but the fish itself was slightly dry and fairly bland. Everything was on the bland side really, and no combination of condiments (salt, pepper, malt vinegar, tartar, even ketchup) truly helped the situation. The chips strongly resembled Red Robin's boring steak fries. They'll be happy to bring only fish as a continuation of your AYCE experience, but I ended up with taste buds dulled both by repetition and by some sense of feeling full. And flavor aside, I doubt that the fish filets are premium cuts given their nonchalant attitude toward providing seconds and toward wasted food.

I wouldn't really bother returning to Little Crown & Anchor Pub just for the fish & chips. The service was friendly though, and the music was quite fun fun, both when it had pop and alt/indie rock hits and when they recalibrated the playlist for an older audience.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,8,3,BQvjZRmaPijZ7VKHaUcJZA

Then the visit before this we were told by our waitress after we sat down and ordered drinks that their grill was broken, which meant we couldn't have any grilled chicken or burgers etc... That left all of us trying to suck down some horrible roast beef deli meat + fried chips which was a waste of my taste buds. 

At this point I've come to the conclusion that C&A and myself aren't meant to be drinking buddies because every time I'm here there's always something that goes wrong with their equipment. 

Anywho, I would encourage any foodies out their to give C&A a go for exploration sake and see what you make out of it  but as for me I'm totally done ""exploring"" the end of my possibilities which came a little too soon... Oh well.

It didn't happen.  Instead, when we drove by Crown & Anchor, we decided we'd rather have bar food.  

After I ordered my usual glass of wine, I noticed the Magner's Cider on the menu, and thought ""Oh well, next time.""  

We had burgers and mine was superb - the meat was excellent, done just right, and the Stilton cheese was an unusual choice (I know, this is a British Pub, but you can't get it at MickeyD's, right?) that really made the burger taste special.  I was able to substitute a salad for the fries with no upcharge, and the salad was fresh romaine loaded with a ton of stuff.  My husband ordered the fish and chips - one piece of fish, but very big, and tons of fries, so I was glad I was able to get the salad, 'cause I helped him eat those very good steak fries.

The highlight was the regular Saturday night Trivia Quiz, but since we're not regulars we had no idea it was happening. It turned out to be serendipitous, since I love, love, love Trivia.  

I'd only been to one bar trivia thingy in Vegas before, at McMullan's, and that was so long and complex and ridiculously difficult that my friend and I gave up after 10 questions. This one was different, composed (I learned later) by the manager, Scooter - challenging, shorter (15 questions), and very enjoyable.  Our team consisted of hubby and me, and we named our team YELP.

That's not my thing, but I can appreciate that there is a place for them in a country that named our sport in which you throw a ball that can't touch the ground, football. There are free darts here as well, so that is pretty awesome. 

One quirk I gotta get out of the way before I sing any more praise. They have an absurdly antiquated liquor license in which you can only drink beer at the bar. If you want the hard stuff you gotta feel like an outcast at the tables. Ok, so in a small place like this, perhaps outcast is a bit of an exaggeration. And they do have machines at some tables so you could still get your gamble on if that's your thing. 

Now onto the positive stuff. The staff is always super friendly here. Bartenders always make me feel welcome, they are generous on comps, and the female bartenders are equipped with pretty awesome work attire. I'm pretty sure everyone loves school girl skirts, so that's a genius move on their part. They are genuine here too, we can BS about anything without the pretentious, keeping it proper type of conversation. I always appreciate genuine people. The food is also really good. I've had the burgers, which are not bad, but the chicken fingers are where they seem to shine. Nothing is outrageously priced, but including fries with their fingers would be a better choice in my book. The grilled chicken sandwich is pretty good too!

These are the kinds of places to support.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,0,1,4,h03AJpzdmsmDsKdkFgzQow

Since we were hungry, we started with the food order and a couple drafts.

Authentic English Fish & Chips ($10.95): One-Half Pound of Beer Battered Icelandic Cod, Fries & Peas. Huge chunk of juicy, flavorful cod! Very enjoyable...recommended!

Kart and Abdul tried the Sunday Dinner ($10.95): Roast Beef or Roast Lamb, Yorkshire Pudding, Roasted Potatoes, Vegetables & Gravy. Super filling portion size! 

Everything was good...I'd come back and sample more of the menu :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,1,3,_tfZ_m-jFtlza7ZbUg-fsg
5181845,2010-05-28,0,2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,"This is where I ended up on a girls' night out in celebration of my birthday. One of my friends, being a regular here, knew what was up. Good casual atmosphere with a jukebox and on Saturdays they have a trivia game in which the winner gets $50 off their tab. That's pretty good incentive to come in my mind, it's a fun group-oriented activity and of course free to play. It's not just some lame game they try to put on but everyone in the place, especially the regulars, gets really into it.

Being a pub I also expected there to possibly be more unwanted characters, as my friend the regular had said, but the crowd was good and we got to talking to some guys that had interesting things to say instead of stupid pick up lines and perverted jokes. We were there from about 11pm til 2 am just talking and joking around with them for most of that time. I had a great time but was definitely disappointed in the hefeweizen selection, they ONLY have Franziskaner, which is decent but at least offering 1 more type would actually be considered variety. Friendly service and a good crowd atmosphere will let me give this place more chances though, if only to hang out with a Stella and try out their food.",v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ,3,1,4,SGaisdy60ZzMrkna1WIVrw

I don't play video poker, and I am not generally here at any time that might be considered peak. I arrive on a Tuesday afternoon, a Monday evening or a summer Sunday when the place is pretty much empty. I am usually with a personal posse of people who want to do two simple things: drink a pint and play some darts. They have two boards and ample space for slinging. This is what we do, and I really have no complaints. I am sure we'll be back, and I am sure all we will ever do is drink and dart.

I ordered the sliced lamb roast and it was served with peas, carrots, Yorkshire pudding and roasted potatoes. The food was rustic and heavenly, it is just how I imagine my grandparents cooking to be...

The service was exceptional. Compared to the crown and anchor on trop, this place is the place to be. Real people who care about customer service run the show...the same can't be said about the other location.

I recommend an appetizer portion of the Yorkshire pudding, they do it better than anyone in town. To me, that deserves 5 stars.",_8nN8zPZ3X3Cg2dkGMsKKA,0,0,5,CRly-3byx3yeY7NF3EW_ZA

The waitress was not only adorable in her little kilt, she was also very sweet and patient. We ordered a sausage roll and some onion rings with drinks. The sausage roll took me right back to London with its flaky crust and mild sausage flavor. The onion rings were spectacular! We deduced that they must use the same crispy batter for their fish and chips.

She was very friendly, sweet, welcoming & helpful. Service like that is what really sets a place apart, along with the food of course! The food is always hot and fresh. I Love the environment, food & excellent service. I don't go there to drink, so the no liquor at the bar doesn't bother me. Plus, it's a small, cozy place, so who cares?

My boyfriend ordered the Shepard's pie. It wasn't anything special. I ordered the fish and chips. It was one big piece of fish 0.0 nice portion, but I didn't like that the crunch/fried part was just the outside layer. Nice batter though.

This is like an old school Irish Pub, with really cold glasses for beer, at least 15 choices of beer on draft, dart boards, fish 'n chips, soccer flags everywhere, oh and gambling they have gambling [free drinks! and they comp 'em if you play].

Also, the cast of characters sitting at their bar is pretty freaking amazing.  Great people watching here, eves dropping, and feeling better about your life.

They have a lot of TV's for such a small location. And really good music! And purse hooks... She shoots she SCORES!!!

Due to the confidentiality agreement I signed to obtain my job, I am prohibited from drinking alcohol, and gambling. So, I practically just sat there. But, I had a good time. 

Both Aaron and I come from families that immigrated to America over 100 years ago to work in the sugar canes of Hawaii. Aaron is 100% 3rd generation Japanese, and my Dad is 100% Japanese and my Mom is Korean, so we most definitely will stick out like a sore thumb at a British Pub. But, in the end we didn't. Everyone was really friendly. Whenever I have to sit at a bar, I am very used to some drunk idiot blaming me for ""Pear Harbor"" or some stupid sh!t like that. But, the people who come to drink here are all actually really friendly.

They got AYCE fish and chips on Mondays. This might keep bringing me back here.

I also thought it was cool how they had all those pictures of Ricky Hatton on the walls before he died against Manny Pacquaio. Seriously, what ever happened to that guy?",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,5,4,5,PE4C6TqHgTj_-QiWA1A9Fg
