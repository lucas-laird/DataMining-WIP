First of all, it's chipotle like set up where you could see what they are putting in with your own eye. This was a plus as I was able to trust that is going into my mouth.
I had sashimi bowl which had combination of 6 to 7 different kind of sashimi with rice and mixed green.  Food was awesome and loved the freshness of the ingredients.  it also came out with miso soup and sweet potato chips.  Miso soup was AMAZING!

I've never had a sushi burrito and have been seeing these places pop up everywhere. I wondered if it was made with a tortilla and maybe was a reason I hesitated trying them earlier. To my delight, it was rice with ingredients inside and then simply rolled with seaweed. I loved it. It's funny how they call it a burrito. In Japan, this is just called a futomaki roll with different ingredients inside and has been around forever. When it's introduced to America with ""burrito"" slapped to its name, people think it's new, and it becomes a new craze (like ramen, which has been around in Japan forever). Anyway, I really enjoyed my sushi burrito since I've always loved futomaki rolls. It was fresh, and I liked the ingredients. The only problem was that there weren't many choices for me since I don't eat raw fish, but I could go back and just eat the same thing. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. The cashier was patient when I asked her questions (for example, no tortillas, right?) about this new thing called the sushi burrito.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,1,1,5,8alg0uBe3319f26zG2NWRg

The bottom is split into half mixed greens salad and half rice. It was well seasoned and topped with a TON of Poke and seaweed salad. The flavor was very good and the fish tasted fresh with a nice texture.

They were also running an offer of a side of free sweet potato fries/miso soup depending on what you get. The soup was decent but I wasn't much for the fries. They also have mochi ice cream available!

2071896,2018-03-28,2,wZkjm9TGa7nXLYHxhIRO5w,"Tako cheese.. I can't believe no one has written a review about this deliciousness yet. It's a combination of crab mix, cheese, corn, octopus and scallops all baked with eel sauce and served hot. It's INSANELY good. It's very similar to dynamite if you've ever tried that at a sushi restaurant before. It's usually on the appetizer side. 

I ordered the tako cheese and a salmon bowl and it was around $15. I ordered for delivery because this place is in Chinatown and ain't nobody got time for that! The salmon bowl comes with: salmon, crab mix, spicy tuna, tamago (this is a Japanese egg type thing, really good!), onion, red pepper, sesame,soy sauce, furikake, sushi rice, mixed greens and seaweed paper. What I got was a bowl that had many of the above mentioned items, but no red pepper, and instead had pineapple. I love pineapple and I am glad that they included it, but other people may not be happy about the surprise additions/lack of items. Also, tamago, where have you been all my life? This stuff is good, although I do find it an odd ingredient for a poke bowl. They also had seaweed paper on the side in a bag. Again, weird ingredient for a poke bowl. 

For my sauces I chose spicy garlic ponzu, and hot yum and spicy yum, which is basically sweet and spicy mayo. I got them on the side so I could taste them and add to my bowl as needed. They charge $0.25 for extra sauce, but I am a sauce lover so I loved having this option. 

Some things to note. They may not offer BYO bowls? I ordered for delivery but I didnt see any byo option on the menu. I thought the price for the salmon bowl was great. It was like $10.50 for a huge bowl with 3 scoops of fish and a generous amount of toppings. The bowl was enough for 2 servings. With my meal I received a side of sweet potato chips for free. Those things are sooo good! They appear to be deep fried and then tossed in sugar. I added some salt to mine so I got the sweet/salty thing going on and it was so yum.

To me that's awesome customer service even though they messed up. Juno went above and beyond to correct the mistake and make his customer happy.

I haven't been able to go recently due to a change in diet but as soon as I'm done, I'll be back to eating here every week. 

The price is cheaper than other sushi burrito places and the more expensive options are worth it as they pack on so much more fish. My favorites are the unagi bowl, the sashimi bowl, and the beef bowl. They also include free miso soup and chips if you dine in. 

Don't forget to get their stamp card as their stamp card has 2 free entrees instead of just 1 that most places do.

3041377,2018-02-04,13,wZkjm9TGa7nXLYHxhIRO5w,"I decided to pop in on my lunch because this was the closest sushi burrito spot from my job. 
Boy, the parking situation was funky due to Garionban and 8oz Korean Steakhouse on the other side of the plaza. 

Now the interior looks very nice. There are tables with chairs but there are also seats that line the walls, decorated with pillows for maximum comfort. It was giving off more of a cafe vibe but nonetheless a creative touch.
I ordered the Blue Ocean which was an alright type of good. I was not digging the lettuce and the shrimp tempura too much. I had to pick them out :-(
My order also came with a side of chips, but I did not like them that much either. 

Service.. hmm was not that good. So when I entered, there were a couple of people seated and obviously waiting for their orders to be done. From my experience at other sushi burrito spots, you order, watch them make your burritos until it gets to the register and finally you pay. 
Here, you go straight to the register, order, pay and then wait until they make your order. 

With that being said, one of the employees told me to wait as he made the other orders. There were two people working, but they were talking and doing everything slowly. It took them 15 minutes before taking my order and it took them another 10 minutes to make my burrito. I'm sure they would have made my order quickly if I said I was in a rush, but... they were too busy in their conversation and I did not expect it to take them that long.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,25,22,3,y-SrJD_Hr2SIwACf6GXgwQ

5017831,2017-11-01,0,wZkjm9TGa7nXLYHxhIRO5w,"There are many good things about this place but I gave it 4 stars for a couple reasons.

Pros:
Good fish portion.  They weigh it out so its consistent every time.  I thought they were pretty generous with the amount of fresh fish

Friendly staff and clean restaurant.  The staff is really nice and the space is very clean and new.  Its a good environment

Flavors were pretty good.  I chose the salmon bowl (normal size) and thought all the ingredients went really well together.  It was toped with salon, seaweed salad, tamago, crab meat, spicy tuna, crunchy wontons and cucumbers.    I opted for salad instead of rice and they didn't have a problem with that.

All bowls and burritos comes with complimentary sweet potato chips and they give you a free soda with a yelp check in!

Cons:  
To be fair, the reason why I gave it 4 stars is just how the poke restaurant is structured.  I think I prefer a poke bar where you can add as many ingredients as you want.  This place the bowls are all structured with set ingredients.  Options are a little limited.  You also don't get too many options with sauces.  

Some of the fish pieces were a little chewy.  But overall it was delicious.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,1,1,4,y7ZUeIaE8R-FngyAAFF9vg

The fish looked pretty fresh and not that stingy with it. The only downfall is that we noticed that they didn't give us some of the toppings we requested on the check list.
