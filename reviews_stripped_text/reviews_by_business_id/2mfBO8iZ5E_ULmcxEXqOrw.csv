Their hostess mixed our reservation up, gave our table away, and the manager said WE caused the confusion, so had to wait 30 minutes. He later admitted their mistake and apologized.

Our table ordered the chef tasting menu...big mistake. Total time in restaurant was more than three hours for a table of 3! And we were only served 3 of 5 courses! At the end, the manager said he would buy us a drink for our troubles...unbelievable. Total cost was $300... Definitely not even close to worth it.

Ok, with that said, let's get to it...
I have dined here on 2 separate occasions in this past year and each time the food has been A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!

For the first occasion, there was a big group- approx. a party of 16- and we had a set menu. When you call to make a reservation, which is highly recommended, they will work with you on giving you a group rate- not including tip and cost of beverages, of course. We had a choice of either their salmon, chicken or fillet Mignon as an entree, with all the sides (MAC and CHEESE included...YUM-O!!)  plus dessert. We were seated right away and the waiters did not hesitate to bring our salads out to us immediately. The presentation and quality of the food was great and the service was friendly and fast. 
Since it is a fine-dinning establishment in Vegas, nonetheless, you have to expect to pay $16 for a specialty cocktail. However, since we were there to splurge, splurge we did and those cocktails were worth every penny! 

The second time around I was there, it was only the 2 of us. We did have a reservation but were not seated right away. When we got to our table, we received our waters and bread and the waiter didn't get back to us for about 10 min to take our order. No bueno, waiter!!  However, he did apologize and our food was out very shortly after that. Tuna tarter just became one of my favorite starters there and couldn't resist to order the MAC and CHEESE again.. it tasted just as good, if not better, than the first time I had it. 

I'm not a big fan of the location and not 100% satisfied with the service for a small party, but would definitely return and definitely order the MAC and CHEESE again! AHHHH!!! Love their MAC and CHEESE!!!!",7f_QaLGJc-6Nw3JW53F9tA,0,1,5,I9impfLKqkAoigP4OCKNcQ

You would have thought we were eating at McDonald's since we didn't see our server most of the night.  Being a local, there are much better fine dining restaurants to go to on the strip where you will get great service!!  

Here are just a few of my complaints:
1-Not seeing our server for over an hour and her telling us that the restaurant is understaffed and a table of 16 in her section caused her to be slammed is an UNACCEPTABLE excuse for poor service.
2-Placing your entree order and it taking over an hour to come out without a server or management coming over to let you know the hold up is not acceptable.
3-To me, fine dining means that my water glass never goes empty and I shouldn't have to flag down a server to tell you I need more water.",3majSbZdwHnkypQaHXvkug,3,0,1,34jVFxXhmar39hsi-WBCiw

1232447,2010-01-06,0,2mfBO8iZ5E_ULmcxEXqOrw,"I am giving Union a 5 plus stars!! This is a great restaurant! Be expected to pinch out a nice silver dollar or two, but you will get what you paid for. 

The Place: 
The decor of this place is surely high-end!! Dark rich woods with silver accents. The Nambe silverware is nice touch. The leather place mats brings the whole table together. Since it is from the Light Group, it does present itself with a very high-end lounge feel to it. They were not cheap in decorating this place. 

The Service: 
The service was unnatural at times. The hostess did try to have a conversation with us but it seemed more force. In fact, a lot of the personnel did too. I rather have them try to be ""great service"" then blow us off. We can spend our money elsewhere. In Vegas, there are far too many choices. We were catered by 5 people. 1 head server (who was excellent - he was from DC and appeared to have a lot of high-end serving experience), then another server and like three assistance. We never once needed to ask for anything. This is the type of service you expect from an average entree price of 50.00 

The Food and Drinks: 
We had a few martinis - 14.00. I had the Samba Smash - awesome, but the fresh fruit mud made it impossible to drink from a cocktail straw. We also had the ""Calm before the Storm"" it was awesome too. 
We shared the Hamachi Wontons ( Yellow Tail Crunch) - the serving was small, 5 little pieces deep fried with a pepper to top off. 
For the main dishes - The Jennifer had the Sea Bass which was soft flaky and cooked perfectly. I am on a Red Meat binge lately so I opted for the Organic Chicken. It was unique, not dry, with a unique hint of sea salt. 
We shared a side of Brussels Sprouts - generous portions. 
Dessert - we skipped dessert at the Union and headed over to Jean Phillipe. 

Drinks - 14.00 
Sides - 9.00 
Entrees - 40.00 - 50.00 avg (unless you want lobster) 
Dessert - 12.00 

Overall. I will go back for sure. From the previous review, they must have worked out a lot of the opening kinks because our food prep time and serving time was perfect. In fact, they even staged out silverware for us after each plating. 

Cons: Seriously - 5.00 for sauce for your 50.00 steak??? Really??

1313125,2011-03-13,0,2mfBO8iZ5E_ULmcxEXqOrw,"My boyfriend and I decided we would have ""fancy night"", so we came to Union for the chef's taster. All five courses were fantastic, though we easily picked favorites out of them all.

The first course was a beef flatbread, which was delicious, but the other option, the mini crab tacos, most definitely won our hearts immediately. The tacos were cute and probably the best tacos I've ever had. 

The next course was a soup and salad which were both good, but the tomato bisque was stunning. 

The steak and lobster were the best I've ever had by far.

The desserts were good, but just desserts. We had them package up each of our selections and saved them for another time and our other friends that were there with us, which was greatly appreciated.

I can't say who our actual server was, because a few people took care of us. They were all great, but Mike was one of the best servers I have ever had.

In short order- it was expensive, without reason. Whereas other restaurants charge a lot for a great product and such, this place charges a lot because this is Vegas. To top it off It doesn't serve any particular cuisine and it doesn't even have a dish it does well. It just serves food. In the land of concept restaurants it's hard to rap your head around this place. You could call this a steakhouse, but it doesn't do that well, it just charges a lot for steaks, the cheapest one was $45 for a 7oz Filet and  the most expensive was...$98 for a 40 oz Ribeye for 2 ppl   *Sidenote* They bring out this drink menu and all of the drinks are $20. ALL OF THEM. Just order a regular drink if you're not in the mood for those 'hand-crafted' cocktails. 

They lost a star, mostly b/c the entrees were marginal. Nothing screamed ""eat me"" and the server was nice as a peach, but a little dim. Anyway, for the price of 2 entrees we got 4 items- Teryaki wings, Kobe sliders w/ fries, wedge salad and hash browns. The wings were spicy, the sliders were juicy, the wedge was NOT a wedge and the hash browns were a flavorful, although a little burnt. I was hungry and between drinking and talking I filled up pretty fast. It's amazing how dinner doesn't have to be 3 courses nowadays. 

UNION won't be the first on my list of places to recommend only because it doesn't stand out in any category: price, food, location, service, ambiance..., but it was a great experience.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,0,0,4,0agKiBIKTnoMMcgkuLxUow

One thing I must say is from STACK to FIX to UNION, you would think LIGHT Group would figure out a way to design a restaurant that doesn't look like all the others.

The portions were incredibly small (i.e. we ordered the butternut squash tortellini - $24, it came out with 8 pieces of tortellini) and the service was terrible.  I thought it was ironic that our server greeted us with, ""Hi, my name is Mike? and I'll be taking care of you tonight"".  

Our food came out before our drinks did.  We saw him walk by our table numerous times, never stopping to ask how our food was or if we needed anything.  The bussers and food runners were the only people coming & going from our table and they were not very friendly, either.  We actually spent a good portion of our dinner discussing how bad the service really was, sadly.  It was almost laughable.  

The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the food wasn't completely awful.  I've been to many other fabulous restaurants in Vegas and there are many more I'd like to try.  I will not be going back to Union.",nNAinyxsb3wVIPiOCULWew,0,0,2,UoLjBKF-MjaeSNpTDDl0Zw

2242667,2010-05-04,1,2mfBO8iZ5E_ULmcxEXqOrw,"Long time Yelp faithful, but never been too tempted to write my own review until going to Union. We went with a group of 25 or so, thus we had to prepay for our dinner in advance.  Like a previous review mentioned, it was beyond clear that since the tip was already included and the meal paid for, our waiter and the staff there couldn't have cared less or been less attentive than they were.  It took 45 minutes and asking 5 times to get bread.  We literally asked our waiter 4 times for bread and he kept saying it was on it's way, before we finally asked the busboy who brought some out within 30 seconds. People who ordered non-alcoholic drinks just simply didn't get theirs served to them until asking 2 more times.... and when the sodas were halfway empty, they would come and replace them, not telling you they were charging you $4 a glass for diet coke.  We had also told them that we needed to be out of there to make a reservation within 2.5 hours, thinking that it was almost unnecessary to bring up, but once again Union failed, making us spend over 3 hours in the restaurant to serve 3 courses (desert came as we had had enough and were leaving).  The food itself was pretty tasty, but not nearly worth the price.  Ceaser Salad, Sea Bass, and Fillet were had around the table and most enjoyed.  I'm usually the type of eater who skips over the reviews that focus on service, but the experience at Union has me reconsiderring that stance.  To cap off the experience, one member of our group (who sent his steak back to be cooked longer as he had ordered) got food poisoning.  He spent about 8 hours throwing up from the meal, and it's safe to say his trip was completely ruined.  The management blamed the food poisoning elsewhere, but it was clearly not the case.

An expensive fine dining restaurant located right next to casino at Aria. with the noise and smoking of casino, it was not really worth the price we paid, with only one alcohol beverage. we asked a more private seat, the best they could do was to put us as far from the casino as possible, which was still not very far! there weren't so many tables in the entire restaurant, and it was pretty empty on a holiday weekend night. 

Our server was friendly but not very attentive, I am a little too used to the over the top service at fancy restaurants in LA, West Hollywood and OC, it was kinda of unpleasant for me to have just an average service there.

It has taken that distinction from Mesa Grill's Peach Margarita.  Lastly, the service was out of this world.

The space is beautiful, as you'd expect from a restaurant in the Light Group - a tasteful blend of chrome, leather, and wood. Even the Nambe flatware is striking. Just like at Fix, the restaurant opens to the casino, but you never feel like you're IN the casino. For a restaurant that seats (I'm guessing) 300 people, they had a ton of staff running around (we counted at least 30 people on the floor). 

The food alone would earn the restaurant 4.5 stars -- losing that half star for terrible value (about $10 for individual-sized sides, $5 for a drop of sauce!!!). The only thing on the table that we didn't like was the gratin potato side -- potatoes were undercooked, cheese on top was overcooked, and the dish was decadent to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. That said, the union salad was fresh and unique, the beef carpaccio was a savory treat, and steaks were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The bone-in rib-eye was one of the best steaks I've had and was enough to feed two (not-starving) people -- but at $58 it should. The surf and turf looked spectacular, and could feed 3 lighter eaters rather than the recommended two, but again, for $159, you SHOULD have a giant mass of food. 

Service in general was genuinely helpful and pleasant, but it was the pacing of the meal that was the problem. It took over 45 minutes from the time we ordered to receive our appetizers, and then another half hour from the time our salad plates were cleared to the time we received our entrees. At that point, not all entrees came out at the same time, not all our sides came out, and the runners had no clue where anything belonged. I don't care that we were a party of 9, for an upscale restaurant charging that kind of money, I expect service to be not so discombobulated, whether you've been open for 3 days or 3 years. 

So, would I come back? YES -- if you just work out the little service kinks, this will be a fine restaurant. I'm just going to wait a few months before I give Union another try.

annnd THEN there was the main course, which was like some sort of opulent medieval banquet, featuring a gigantic porterhouse steak and a huge, whole lobster (it stared at us throughout the meal) filled with buttery stuffing, accompanied by cups of rich sauces and two massive side dishes of smooth, creamy mashed potatoes and smoky macaroni and cheese. holy crap, that was a lot of food.

the little assorted desserts were very cute, but i only gave them each a courtesy nibble because i was far too full from all of the savory dishes to eat any more.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,1,1,4,o30XBzgKJKJTyFS4ci8uCw

UNION is spelled out in all caps - maybe it has a superiority complex, but maybe it should!  To tell the truth, not only does UNION score high marks on all areas, there are other specific reasons why you should eat here:

1) American food in a comfortable yet elegant setting.   
It was my girlfriend's birthday, and she just wanted to just dine at a café because she didn't want anything so fancy.  PLEASE, we're in Vegas!!  So I looked at the Aria hotel's restaurant list, skipped all the ""casual dining"" options, along with the ""specialty"" Asian, Italian, Steakhouse, and uppity American restaurants.  As I came across the description of UNION, I knew this was the perfect spot:  ""spirited, edgy, contemporary-American restaurant & lounge..."" Aww yeah!

2) Big A$$ Round Tables.
Our group consisted of seven people, so usually this means sitting at a rectangular table where you won't get to conversate with your peeps sitting at the end. Not so at UNION!  Because of the round table, sharing food was convenient, toasting our shot glasses was a cinch, and chatting with everyone was easy, fo-sheezy!

3) The Viva Elvis Menu.
Come here before 7pm and order from their $49 Viva Elvis menu...all the faves are on it, and you'll be stuffed, guaranteed!  You get a choice of appetizer, main course + side, and dessert.  The choices were so intriguing it took our group forever to figure out what we wanted!  I ordered the King Crab & Jalapeno taco for my app (the taro chip taco shell was major!), the Chilean Sea Bass (but I really ordered it for the risotto in lobster broth!), and the most rich, chocolatey cake I've ever had in my entire LIFE! And I was amazed at the 7 layers - I wish I was able to take that home & have it for breakfast the next day, I really needed a glass of milk with it!

Maybe it was a city wide experiment to see what would happen if the famed hospitality of Las Vegas ended.  We were forced to wait an hour, with a reservation.  Once a cocktail table actually opened we ordered a drink (which should have been comped but was not), which we had ample time to finish and still wait.  We were then all but kicked out of the cocktail table for not ordering another drink while we were still waiting for our table to open up.  I understand that things happen, you cannot gauge exactly when a table will empty out, but when you are expecting about 100 bucks out of every person you seat, at the very least grab them a well drink or a soda if you are forcing them to wait an hour, and bring a loaf of bread by.  We were there for a convention,  and had been on our feet for 12 hours that day.

That said, eating at Union is meant to be part of the Vegas lifestyle that they try to sell the 30 something baller who demands an up end café to serving simple food.  Its not for everyone.

Décor is contemporary.  The noise from the casino is loud and adds energy to the place but you will feel like you're on display if you take a table closest to the casino floor.

The food is simple and well prepared but the prices are out of line with the overall experience.  The crispy rock shrimp served with a creamy ponzu sauce and chili sauce is delicious.  Perfectly cooked morsels of sweet shrimp.  The Chilean sea bass is by far the best main.  Very succulent and moist served with a delicious rissoto.  A winner.

I have not tried any of the steaks that dominate the menu.  They are comparably priced to top tier Vegas steak houses.  I would rather save the cash and enjoy a steak elsewhere.

The food is great here but overpriced!

We were a party of ten and came here for an early dinner. We should have just ate in the bar area to receive happy hour prices but we wanted to sit together.  We ate here on a Monday and the menu for dinner was limited, it was basically the bar menu but with two entrees.

It was pretty annoying that it took them awhile to setup a table for us, even when the main dining area was completely empty. Slow motion galore! They really took their time serving us our food too.

What we ordered:
   Caesar Salad: It was okay. Nothing special

   Buffalo Drumettes: They were very tasty! The meat came right off of the bone.

   Golden Calamari: The calamari wasn't tough. It came with two dipping sauces, a sweet/spicy sauce as well as a spicy tomato sauce, both were great.

   Kobe Beef Burger: Big burger, very juicy. It came with skinny fries that were very good and not over fried.

   Chilean Sea Bass: The components it came with were creamy risotto and rock shrimp in a lobster broth. I enjoyed this dish because the sea bass was cooked perfectly.

   Tomahawk rib eye steak: On the menu it claims to be 20 oz. The bone weighed about 12 oz!  Although, the new york strip sized steak that it had attached to the bone was prepared well. 

   French Fries with a white cheese dipping sauce: The dipping sauce was very creamy, it was so yummy!

   Not sure what the exact name was but let's just call it ""Hot Stone Steak"": The dish came with 5 thinly sliced pieces of steak that were served with a huge hot stone. You use the hot stone to cook your super thin slices of steak on. Once the steak finished cooking, it shriveled up so much that they almost disappeared! The concept was cool but not worth the money!

Cocktails: $20 martinis!
   We did enjoy 2 of them: The berry one and the one that had two red peppers on the side of the glass making the martini look like it had devil horns!

Restrooms: Private restrooms inside of the restaurant. Separate men and women restrooms. The women's restroom was very clean, modern, and had four stalls.

Ambiance:  Very dark and lounge-y, however, it was open to the casino floor which made it VERY noisy.  I don't recommend the place for a romantic dinner as you can barely hear the person sitting across from you.  For the price point, I was expecting something more secluded and intimate.

Food:  The porterhouse for two was very large and tasty - great cuts of meat prepared delightfully.  I recommend the ultimate surf and turf, we wished we got this - it could have fed four people pretty well.  Calamari wasn't anything to write home about.  The tomato soup is expensive for $16 but I heard it was worth it.  Skip the mac and cheese - I've had better.

Overall: the tab was around $700 for 7 of us with drinks and one bottle of wine, half the table did not order apps and there were no desserts.

It's got great food and their menu is just good enough to justify the really long wait times between courses -- especially if you are the party ordering a table tasting.  It's also really expensive -- $85 per person per table balances out the gigantic 4+ person final course of excellently cooked Porterhouse (the best I've ever had in Vegas) and lobster (which was done great too).  

The Pros:  The food's delicious and the chefs obviously know what they're doing.  The tasting menu is amusing and tasty.   The style of the place is very nice, as is Aria in general.  People-watching is fun to do while you wait.

The Cons:   And you will wait.  The service is very slow, even balanced against any tasting menu's normal savor-speed. You'll be sitting there between the amuse-bouche and starter tapping your fingers on the table, wanting more! The music in the place is blaring loudly and it's just Top 40 tunes at 30 decibels more than it needs to be.  It makes talking normally impossible.   The place is deceptively expensive.

The food itself was alright, and somewhat reasonably priced ($10 for small plates and $25 for kobe burger sliders and beer). What brings Union down in my opinion is their terrible, condescending service. 

We walked by the restaurant and immediately noticed that no one was sitting in the dining room. I started to wonder whether Union was even open (we had checked out American Fish, which was our first choice earlier but it was closed). Luckily (or unluckily), it was open so we approached the podium. I motioned that we would need a table for 7, to which she asked, ""did we have reservations?"" ok... there is no one in your restaurant and you're asking if we have reservations? I said no. She then asks, are you a guest of the hotel? I then reply, no. She then asks ""may I ask where you are staying?"" Granted we were not dressed in suites and ties, but we weren't exactly in PJs. I told her we were staying at the Cosmopolitan (which we were - might have stayed at Aria if they didn't charge a heinous resort fee) and she finally said, wait here, while we get a table ready for you. Why does she need to know where we were staying? What if I said Motel 6 or Circus Circus? Would they turn us away? 

We then are finally seated in the dining room. It was my mistake, I didnt know that the happy hour was for the lounge only. Our waiter was very nice and moved us over to the lounge area (which was pretty much empty too). This is when we got our new waitress who was extremely rude and condescending.  She approached us (didnt even introduce herself) and asked ""what do you want to order."" She would check back occasionally asking ""do you want more food?"" When the check finally arrived... she said that a standard gratuity charge had been applied due to our large party. Later, when we reviewed the bill we realized they had ripped us off.. we only had a party of 7 and they put us down as a party of 8 so that we would get stuck with the standard 18% gratuity.

5509424,2011-12-31,0,2mfBO8iZ5E_ULmcxEXqOrw,"While on a trip to Vegas to experience some great food and good atmosphere, Union was a huge disappointment.

After trying a different (and amazingly wonderful) restaurant in Aria the night before, we opted to give Union a shot since they had a seemingly good prix fixe menu for $49. I ordered the Roasted Tomato Soup, the Organic Chicken and the 7 Layer Chocolate Cake for dessert; my partner opted for the King Crab and Jalapeno Taco, the Chilean Sea Bass and the Apple Pie for dessert. We also chose to add the wine pairing for $20 as well.

When you go to a show, you don't expect it to peak in the first act - and that's what happened at Union. The appetizers were by far the best aspect of the whole experience, but given that it was tomato soup and tacos, it's not hard to screw those things up. For the entree round, my chicken was a tad overcooked and borderline rubbery. The garlic spinach that came with it was great, as was the tablespoon of parsnip puree that accompanied it. The sea bass was equally rubbery and overcooked, and a delicious sounding risotto that came with the sea bass was slightly undercooked and on the starchy side. The desserts were just OK - nothing special. My cake was on the dry side, but the apple pie was not bad. 

I have to echo what others have said about the service. It's abysmal. The guy serving water was the hardest working person on the crew. After we ordered, we barely saw our waiter. It was a revolving door of people coming by (which is not unusual), but our waiter rarely checked on us. He dropped our wine off in the same manner as a delivery person dropping off a package. I was surprised that a wine pairing didn't come with dessert, especially after seeing other places in Aria (and other resorts) offering a pairing with each course. Had we known that, we probably would have ordered a bottle instead, but the waiter didn't take the time to explain that. We found out after our dessert was delivered.

While we were there, we noticed two groups get seated and subsequently leave without being served. There was plenty of staff, so I'm not sure what the problem was. They all seemed in a constant state of chaos. 

The atmosphere is not bad. If you want something quiet and peaceful, this is probably not the place, since it overlooks a big bank of slot machines that constantly sing. 

Overall, I would definitely not recommend this to anyone going to Vegas for a culinary treat. There are plenty of better options within Aria, and there are several other places nearby to get a much better steak (if that's what you're looking for).

Thank you Union for making our dinner party a success!",CtbZqNl6nN4xljfMFgXwDw,2,1,5,5eCoYgS72iTWbfvSG1Jz_g

Oooh, let's go to Aria!), Friday night found my friend and I bellied up to the bar in the lounge... and it was phenomenal. He had been here; I was the Union virgin.

Waiting for another girlfriend to join us, we started our evening with drinks and dinner and a chat. Not yet too busy, but buzzing well enough at both the bar and tables, we experienced immediate, attentive service without delay.

The decor was dark and intimate without being stifling or prohibitive to a casual evening. It got a bit loud at points, but it was the energy of the lounge crowd that created it and, because it was dynamic (read: it wasn't like the music was blasting too loud or anything), it seemed to fit the space.

The important stuff: drinks! Orin Swift's Prisoner by the glass made me a happy girl. Additionally, Sheena (bartender) made for me the only dirty martini I have had in Vegas that I didn't need to have them ""fix"" in some way. It was absolutely perfect the first time. The  lemon drop shots were great (and a great ice breaker for new friends!).

Food: I had the Caesar salad and a side of mushrooms (about $10-12 each, very generous portions). Flavorful, well executed, and beautiful. The mushrooms were deep and earthy with a great, fresh, bright bite from the wine and spices in which they were cooked. The romaine was crisp and the dressing was tangy and rich. My friend had the (large!) Kobe burger ($25ish), which he was kind enough to let me taste, and I found it to be fresh, juicy, and well seasoned.

The Union was great for meeting up with friends and making new ones at the bar (you never know who you will meet through a foursquare checkin!). We were there for over three hours and we were always served quickly and efficiently, always with a smile, and always with a fantastic attention to detail. Whether it was our drinks, food, conversation, or a question, everyone was helpful, on point, and made us feel like we were the most important people in the room.

The pricing, I found, was appropriate. Yes, it's a high-end resort property, that has something to do with it, but we also had great food, great drinks, and amazing service. I would (and will) do it all again in a heartbeat.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,0,0,5,o_FkNL09vjxvUX2JQWn9Kg

Comp'd us with shots.

We were told that we would be able to get into Haze for free once we paid for dinner (+$800)

Once the manager took us to the front of the line: ""Cover is $50"".  

Thanks Manager :(

My porterhouse steak ($61) was pretty good though....",Pj6EZiNxtAnuxy1yUrDxgA,1,1,1,bICH3oAAj9FayGm3EZnnKQ

There are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from. My bad experience here has guaranteed that I will not be spending my money here again. 

It's a beautiful restaurant with low lighting and lots of dark wood. It reflects the design in Aria, which I love a LOT! Very chic and minimalist but very stylish. 

The food here was excellent. Very good tasting food. However, it took forever to come out and our mushroom sides, which probably takes the least amount of time to cook, came at the very end after we were finished with everything else. Doesn't make sense to me.

Our waiter was nice but after he took our order, he seemed to have pulled a vanishing act. We didn't see him at all until we asked a busboy to find him for us. He was forgetful. I asked for straws 3x and he finally got me one. But I had asked for 4. He came back with 6 more. ???

What annoyed us even more was that we were trying to enjoy our meals and the busboys removed our plates and dishes without asking first! We weren't even done with our food! Geeez just because we wanted to take our time to eat, savor the food and just chill, doesn't mean we're done. We were conversing and eating at the same time. We don't want to stuff our faces right away like a bunch of pigs. Just because we put our forks down doesn't mean we're done eating. My friend had to stop the busboy from taking her plate by pushing his hand away.

So after they removed our dishes and utensils, another dish came out. They totally forgot to give us new utensils. How the hell were we supposed to eat our Bolognese with??? Our hands?! We had to hail someone down after waiting for a while just to ask for forks. Really? 

For a restaurant such as this, I really expected a lot more. The service wasn't even average. It just sucked. I give credit to where credit is due. This place doesn't make the cut for me. You're better off dining somewhere else. Try Julian Serrano or Beso. Much better.",2Gy7OX3zFVfNeeHLhmpzJw,8,4,2,CPkwlfAsAHjuH_Cfd9rsnA
