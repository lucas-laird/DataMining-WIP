The owner came over and said they had run out of (whatever it was?) and it would be ready shortly. I told him I had to leave. His response completely floored me he said "" would you act this way if you were at Chipotle"". I asked him what way? No response. Is this how you speak to customers? I left with my refund and went next door to Panera. On my way out he approached my car and said he apologized. I told him to keep his apology and what he said to me was absurd and rude.

Nevada Chicken Cafe has great service, excellent food, and fair pricing for a filling and somewhat healthy meal.  I eat there at least twice a week for either lunch or dinner. I've introduced a couple of friends to this restaurant as well, and they enjoy it as much as I do.

I have visited a handful of times now and each time has been excellent! Both the ribs and chicken are superb, and the side of bbq sauce they give you to dip or spoon on your meat is definitely one of the best bbq sauces I have ever tasted which makes it the perfect compliment. The other house made blueberry bbq sauce is also excellent. They offer numerous side orders and thus far the potato salad is my personal favorite. Baked beans were good, macaroni and cheese is ok. My daughter enjoyed the fresh fruit salad. Service has been friendly, and the quality of the food with the very short wait time is outstanding!

2188799,2018-01-19,1,UB-xdWV_RpIQ9VfVB3WUTA,"Must say, I was pleasantly surprised with the chicken here.  Got the 3 piece of mesquite and found it to be very flavorful.  Seasoning on the outside was extremely tasty.  Maybe not the juiciest chicken I've ever had but by no means dry.  

Found the regular prices to be a bit on the expensive side for what you get but that in no way effects my stars.  I had a coupon so it made the prices far more reasonable.  

Didn't try the sides so no idea of they are good or bad.  But the restaurant is bright, clean and overall nicely done up in my opinion.   The staff was friendly and everything was problem free.  

Would I eat here again???   If I had another coupon, definitely.   If not, highly unlikely.   But if money ain't a thang for you and you just want some very good chicken, you probably won't be disappointed.",lzgEUPNFGboDm1U7aO8gTQ,2,1,4,CUmgcZ7OsHmAvdloa1CGyQ

I changed my mind a few times but Eric rolled with it. I got the 1/2 chicken and brown rice. The meal comes with a dinner roll and bbq. The rice was good and the chicken was amazing and had the perfect amount of spices. I really liked how the manager was rolling up his sleeves and pitching in helping out his employees.

You can see them making all the food, which I always like. I got the 3 piece chicken with 2 sides, which were the flamed broiled chicken (YUUUUM!) and coleslaw - SO delicious. IMO, they make it like coleslaw should be made.  My husband ordered the 3 piece with the corn and mashed potatoes and gravy. He did say they needed to be a little hotter, but still liked them. The taste of the chicken alone without any sauce is beyond good. Good doesn't even cover it. And can I just say, THEY NEED TO  SELL THEIR ORIGINAL BBQ SAUCE!!!!!!! Holy moly is it incredible (hopefully the management/owner is reading this)! I could eat there several times a week. They're a little more pricey than El Pollo Loco, of course, but I'd go to Nevada Chicken Cafe over El Pollo ANY. DAY. On top of everything, the gentleman at the register was incredibly nice and PATIENT *****WORD ADVICE - if it's you're first time there, PLEASE take a menu at the beginning of the line, step aside and read it. Don't stand at the register asking what all the selections are. There's a lot. Decide what you want before ordering.

2993155,2017-11-11,0,UB-xdWV_RpIQ9VfVB3WUTA,"This is our 2nd time here after their grand opening. When we first came during grand opening, there was a guy with a suit and a lady on cashier in a non uniform so I'm guessing they're the owners. The lady was super friendly and when we mentioned the daily special on their website she gave us a discount to match the price with no hassle like it should be.

 I came back again today but I did not see the owners. I tried to use the daily special posted on their website and a really nice Latino girl on cashier asked the manager named Michael and the manager said they can't do it. Then we had to show the girl the daily special posted on their website and after she told him, the manager said to give us 10% discount which still ended up being $2 more than the daily special prices. Then the Latino girl actually asked to take my phone to the manager so she can show him the price and the manager said to give us 20% discount which still ended up being higher price than the daily special but we were tired of arguing so we settled for it. The Latino girl apologized and was still super friendly.  During this whole time the manager couldn't walk literally 10 feet to talk to us and we felt bad for the Latino girl who had to go back and forth 3 times and be the middleman. 

The food itself is really good and everyone except the manager was super nice and  friendly, but with the managers behaviour, I most likely won't go back. If they are not gonna honor the daily special prices posted on their website, they should have a notice posted somewhere because I'm not coming back here if I have to constantly argue with the manager because he doesn't know his own companies daily special promotion.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,2,0,3,xVimfAie-ha2iU1r7NpiKg

The cashier explained to me the meals and favorites which is always a plus and my food was out pretty fast. I ate in to get the full expierence. My coworkers kept telling me to go, but was hesitant until a co-worker said the macaroni and cheese is really good so i ordered wings and mac and cheese along with a fountain drink and roll which i could have chosen tortilla instead so i like that option. The wings were great. It wasn't that down home southern wing, but the flavor was there and the meat came off the bone so easy which for me is a plus. Great taste. Be sure to get extra napkins for the sauce from the wings which is not on the tables, but by the fountain drinks. The mac and cheese was ok. A more suburban taste than southern, but hey it complimented the meal a little. Now the other thing that drew me there was the fact that they offer a discount to the company i work for and that's what got me in. More businesses should take notes from this because it took 1 employee of 120 to say something and even while i was there i saw a coworker who went just because that employee was happy with the food and service. I would definitely go back. Without the discount it is a bit pricey, hence my 4 rating, but it makes up for it with the chicken. Will not order the mac and cheese again, but im open to try other stuff given what the cashier had told me. So I'll be back when the budget permits. Was a little confused with the music going and the t.v. on silent so i had to lip read while listening to the overhead music which wasn't bad.

This was my first time at any of the Nevada Chicken Cafe locations and so I was a little confused by the menu. The employees guided us through all of the combos and made us feel very welcomed. The whole restaurant smelled amazing, it really riled up our taste buds. 

We sat at a booth and the food came quickly and on real plates! We each got the chicken and ribs with sides. I got mac and cheese with a tortilla and my partner got roasted potatoes with a dinner roll. I'm always hesitant with mac and cheese from these casual quick serve type establishments because they aren't the quality I'm looking for. However, I was having a craving and took the risk. And boy, was I glad I did. Their mac and cheese was really tasty and flavorful. You can tell taste the cheese and it didn't look like it was sitting around for hours. The chicken and ribs were solid. I'm not a huge on ribs, but they were tender and full of meat.

All in all, would visit again for the bbq craving - it was a great first time experience.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,1,0,4,3q2EEWXj-vHTLrN1Cfpn9g

I tried the chicken salad wrap & the ribs with a side of Mac & cheese.  

Both of the dishes were good but I do think that it is a little overpriced.  The rotisserie chicken/sides/work station through the clear glass.

Service was pretty slow & some of the employees didn't look very welcoming but at least the inside of the store was clean!",eo775Ge7MXWqqHpOBDI5IQ,2,0,4,EuRMRtNPIteOKNzqrDX-kQ

4913523,2018-04-14,0,UB-xdWV_RpIQ9VfVB3WUTA,"Finally decided to try this place out.  So here goes nothing.

1. Ordered my 3 year old the kids 2 drumstick kids meal with mac n cheese. Meal also came with a roll and medium sized drink. I tried a bite of the mac n cheese. It was creamy and not too bad. Tasted like they may have added like a chicken seasoning to it or cooked it in chicken broth. Not sure but it was pretty good. My son seemed to enjoy the roll and chicken but didn't care for the mac n cheese. Just wish the kids meal came with a smaller cup for his beverage.

2. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich combo with sweet potatoes. The chicken sandwich was ok. I was hoping for pulled/shredded chicken but it came with the chicken cut into chunks. (Which I thought was kind of unusual...Meh) It didn't have much flavor and had more slaw then chicken so I was a little disappointed. I took some of the blueberry BBQ sauce home to try with it. Have to say that was pretty good. The sweet potatoes were bland and didn't have a brown sugar, cinnamon flavor as stated on the menu. I will stick to making my own sweet potatoes at home.

Will I come back. Maybe. Wouldn't be my top choice for BBQ. But I will give it another chance due to forgetting to check in before ordering so I can use the 25% coupon.",fEcLSgQkmFyy61xBYkvAhw,0,0,3,lLsXNqyUwrr2Lj4qUngOhQ

While waiting to order watched  cook bend over in front of the grill, blew his nose several times and picked up the tongs and flipped the chicken. Went over, told the owner what I saw, he stated, ""he would have him use different tongs"".  Um, what about he blew his nose where the food is being cooked, orders prepared and food is exposed.   I will be reporting right after this review to the health department.  He owns all of these cafes so I am certain conditions are similar. This is beyond gross!!!!


Part2: Great response from the owner, no accountability.  I have filed with Clark County Health Department sling with the video ( smarter than you think). In addition, my son is an inspector.  Thank you for your nice response!!!",SVJ71vqsbFAactSL7gwm8w,0,0,1,9ame2u1IQSF4YPfjnzsb1Q

I love ribs. I've met few ribs I didn't gobble up. And yes, I did devour these but they were far from my favorite. 

I found them to be a little salty and dry. They have a dry rub, which I like and come with a side of BBQ sauce. The dry rub would have been better with less salt. The BBQ sauce is also only okay. The ribs are soft, but definitely not fall off the bone tender.

The macaroni and cheese wasn't to my liking. It is creamy, just as advertised. But somehow it doesn't taste very cheesy. Mine was also very soupy and better eaten with a spoon than and fork.",zQk1bdjUXwktAyDUfrE0dA,0,0,3,KxHH3RHTHEy73RN8h4dvoA

5683003,2018-03-04,0,UB-xdWV_RpIQ9VfVB3WUTA,"The newest location for Nevada Chicken Cafe is located between the other two locations near the Tropicana and 215 beltway in a sprawling shopping center.  At first glance the kitchen is open and the restaurant is very spacious.  The smell of rotisserie chicken permeates the air upon entry and gets you hungry if you weren't already.  The menu is identical to the other locations and quality of food is consistent.  My go to is definitely the ribs and chicken combo along with a tortilla and one side dish.  The list of hot and cold side dishes is very diverse and I recommend changing them up every visit.  My favorite sides include the mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, broccoli pasta salad and sautéed veggies.  My only knock on this location was the service given during ordering and checkout, the cashier seemed to be annoyed when i couldn't hear him and seemed to have an attitude.  Overall a great location with great food!",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,0,4,vX3tUG5MIVmoFCYoOqVONA
5880606,2017-12-13,1,UB-xdWV_RpIQ9VfVB3WUTA,"Tried this place for the first time and I absolutely LOVE the food. I got the 6 bone ribs with 2 sides. The ribs were tender, and so welled seasoned, that I didn't even use any of the sauce (on the side) The potato salad is one of the best that I've ever had, it's fresh and homemade. I'd go back there just to get the potato salad. The baked beans were very tasty also. The meal was enough for two people. I also got the Pumpkin Cheesecake, and it was also delicious. I honestly like their food better than Famous Dave's. It's close to my house so I'll definitely be a frequent customer.

Went back there again today. Got the same exact combo as yesterday, and EVERYTHING was delicious just like yesterday",y6z0WQhFfFjm0KRCl2KAUw,2,0,5,wNKsGFFHVZldUtTaJii1-w

Apache, only sad I moved away!  Have eaten at the Ft. Apache location multiple times since they opened.  My son loves the food here just as much as I do!  Restaurant is super clean and bright wait isnt too long!   The food is always so fresh and delicious, the customer service has always been on point, and one night the manager even gave us a $20 gift card for just being there.  Please open one in Henderson!!  If not I will still come here when I drop my son off at aunties house!!  

Thanks!
