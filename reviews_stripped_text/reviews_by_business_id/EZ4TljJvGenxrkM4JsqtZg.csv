We were greeted friendly and sat immediately, which was good considering we came at 7pm on a Friday night. Place was pretty full which is always a good sign. They have a separate menu for Groupon. Choices on menu did not appear to be enough for two; however, I was proven wrong. The fried rice was brought out almost immediately and it is amaze balls. Deal came with two choices of nigiri and the yellowtail was delicious. We also ordered a California Roll as part of the deal and it tasted as you would expect. They allow a premium roll as well and we ordered the Rattlesnack. That thing was huge! We ordered a Japanese Lasagna on the side and they didn't fail there either. Overall, service was great and food was great as well. Only reason they got 4 stars was because we ordered soy paper and the sushi was brought out with seaweed anyways.",R_M6neQCKgP_IR3LWYPOSw,0,0,4,4vREJVludo3L7fo-1aSOSA

65652,2013-06-02,2,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"We just moved here.  so comes the challenge of finding great places to eat.  We were craving sushi so we went here due to reviews.   The restaurant was nice and clean.  We were seated immediately.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful. It took us a while to decide what we wanted to eat.  They handed us 3 menus!  The sushi selection is huge! I did love that everything was pictured so you could see what you were ordering.  The calamari tempura was delicious.  They also gave up some soup.  We aren't sure what kind it was, but it was pretty tasty, too.  We ordered combos B and D so we could sample several different flavors.  It had various sushi and nigiri sushi.  We were a bit disappointed.  The nigiri sushi didn't seem very fresh.  And the flavors were what you would expect from a buffet, not a sit down restaurant.  Overall, I think we will keep looking for a sushi place.

Just wanted to add on that the next day, my husband and I were both very sick.  Should have known better than to eat sushi that doesn't look fresh.  Ugh.",r79QdFrVcIwO4mxNNCjfEg,5,2,1,m4v2nRJCjLhPlfubmIq9zQ

I always ordered the spicy chicken/teri beef combo.  The spice may be too powerful for some so if you're not a big fan of spicy, make sure to steer clear.  The teri beef was a bit on the sweet side, but nothing that was terrible.  My wife usually ordered the shrimp udon bowl which was also pretty good.  My kids enjoyed the Hawaiian Sushi, which is basically your typical ahi sushi roll topped with spicy tuna.  It was their taste of home away from home.  I haven't been back since I moved back to Hawaii two years ago but a good friend of mine called me a few weeks ago asking about the ""sushi place on Craig"" that I always raved about.

I received real genuine service from this sweet young Asian girl. She was very attentive with my refills,  and took the time to help me decide on my selection of rolls, told her I was a big salmon fan. Oh boy!

He said that they are going to provide us with the out of the world feel with their taste. Now I was really crazy as I know my cousin he does not just say anything without reason.To start, the place was really crowed, but was superbly handled by the serving staff and everybody was looking quite relaxed and satisfied. The waiters and servers were quick and have good skills to manage.Going through the menu it was just full of variety of stuff but was beautifully presented and the prices were reasonable as well. Firstly, we decide to have some starter and ordered  Mussels and Miso soup! It was smoking... Good taste to start off with. We ordered for dinner and in no time it was there. My cousin and I were sitting at the Sushi bar and Wilson served us the dinner, with whom, we were quite impressed. Sushi rolls....... rocks! We got our money's worth. I had this rolls before as well but the ingredients put in this was just making your tongue know what the actual taste is. Adding up to the taste were the sauces provided with it. Nice work Wilson and the team. I am definitely going to recommend this 5 star place if you want to know what the taste is that too in reasonable rates.",jsgbKkNF5qaN4KjLLTmqeA,0,0,5,tYkjGQiaoqvhnVeE-D-5sw

Well, we hadn't been since then, kind of forgot about the place. Well, we got this flyer in the mail advertising ""2 for 1 tepanyak"". So my wife and I area like, yah, let's sit at the live cooking station and have a blast! Well, when I asked the server about the 2 for 1 she showed me the menu where basically what they have done is create a whole new ""2 for 1 menu"" but instead of like $20 per person for a dish, it's like $35 for 2 to eat, you see the BS here or is it just me? I am instantly turned off by bait and switch nonsense so I opted out of the table cooking. My wife had her heart set on it so she ordered for herself and I just ordered a couple of sushi rolls. The food was good and the chef was entertaining. The server (a lady) got the notion that I was turned off by the 2 for 1 baloney and she went sour on us at that point.

She's the main reason we keep coming back to this place. Melody always has an upbeat attitude and provides quick efficient service, she always makes sure our order is served correctly, and our cups are kept full. Thanks Melody! 

The negatives: the other waitresses seem to be a ""revolving door"" here and don't seem to provide the personable and memorable experience Melody does, however it's not the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. With the exception of the sushi chefs the kitchen staff seems to be a bit slow on getting the orders out. Lastly on more than one occasion I have seen the owner getting drunk here and while it's nice to see an owner present in his restaurant I find it very unprofessional to see an owner knocking back drinks in his restaurant when he should be managing his staff.

Tonight, I took a friend of mine there for dinner and as soon as we walked in, it was hot in there. I asked why it was so hot and the response I got was their A/C was out. OK, things happen, so we sit down and decide to ride it out. 
So we order and after about 40-45 mins, we still have no food and the waiter tells us there's only 1 guy making sushi! I look around and there's quite a few people waiting, including a female who had obviously called in her order for pick up and she waited around an hour to get her dinner. 
When our first item was brought to the table, it was the wrong thing! We ended up waiting another 20+ minutes, we finally started to get a roll here and there. At one point, the chef made something and the waitress was walking table to table, trying to figure out where it belonged. 
Bottom line, don't waste your time at this place! It's gone downhill, No A/C, shortage of staff, long waits, staff is confused and the sushi certainly isn't worth that kind of wait and frustration! I'm done with this place and wanted to warn you. Go elsewhere and you'll be happy you did!",axPmaH0Q2yb1Mi5TAt_VgA,1,1,1,5eEOWSUPsK9IQ1SPKIotlA

Friday night we thought we would give Sushi Ko another chance.  The place was pretty empty for a Friday night.  Tepanyaki tables only had one couple sitting there....looked so sad.  The food was pretty bland.  We ordered fried rice-bland, teriyaki beef-teriyaki was so sweet :( and a couple rolls-one 911 with the tempura on the outside...left your mouth waxy.

Let me start by saying that I am in the industry so I know how it can be. We were the only table in there besides one more family. My boyfriend and my three kids came in for hibachi but didn't know it wasn't available for lunch so we decided to dine in anyways. She was horrible from the second we sat down, she made us feel like we were an inconvenience for being there. I asked about a tuna roll and she ordered it for us, even though we didn't want it. I asked for soy sauce ramekins and she brought two over and was clearly irritated when I asked for three more. The list goes one with her irritation with serving us. Food was great like always. As I mentioned, I'm in the service industry so when I go out, I start with a 40% grat and work my way down if that's the case. Alexa received 0%. I tried to let a lot go but just couldn't. Last but not least we ordered dessert at the end and she was rudely talking to another table while attempting to write down our order, I asked her if she was ready to listen to our order and she was very rude.

1086447,2010-07-02,2,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"I have lived in Vegas since 91. To find decent service and quality in Vegas is near impossible.
I am the type of person that believes in doing my part, helping the economy recover by going to local establishments. I try to stay away from the franchises big properties.
I have a rotation of about 3-4 sushi places that I frequent with the goal of helping these establishments, building up a rapport as well as enjoying some good sushi.
I had been going to Sushi Ko for many years and probably have eaten there 20-25 times going back 2001. 
My most recent visit will be my last, which I am sad to report since finding decent sushi that includes friendly service is getting harder to find in Las Vegas.
I guess I do not understand the rules of eating at an establishment. If an establishment posted opened until 10:00 PM, does it not mean if you walk in at 9:45 that you should be able to receive service? Courteous service?   
When we walk in to the establishment at 9:45 we was unaware that it was SO LATE! 
 We were quickly informed by the host that it was soon to closing time and that we needed to order quickly. 
I assured the host that we knew what we wanted and we would order quickly.
During this time I was watching the Sushi Chef to gauge his demeanor. The last thing you wanted is a pissed off Sushi Chef, preparing your RAW fish. 
As soon as we started walking toward his serving area, I could read his body language. He was clearly upset that he was going to have to serve us. I was already deciding this was not going to go well.
He immediately raised a finger to us and stated, ""YOU ONLY GET ONE, YOU ONLY GET ONE TIME!""
I think what he was trying to tell us that, we could only order once, that we could not linger or spend any amount of time, order, eating or sitting. 
That was it, with the last amount of dignity I had left told the chef it was ok, we would leave and go somewhere else,  sorry to inconvenience you. Please forgive us. 
In Las Vegas there are a 100 establishments opening in Vegas every month. 100 more closing every month. I try to stay away from the Big Casino properties; they get enough traffic as it is. I try to help the little guy. On this occasion the little guy didn't need my business. So be it, I do not have to go to Sushi KO anymore, which is sad because they have a decent product that I had enjoyed in the past.

1126867,2016-05-13,5,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"We have been loyal and sometimes even fanatical customers of Sushi Ko since 2007.  I took my now fiancé here on our first date in 2013, and she and I started eating lunch here about twice a week.  Over the past couple months, we stopped eating out so much, including going to Sushi Ko.  But this weekend is the big day for moms, and my mom, who loves sushi, came to town to visit, so we took our parents to our favorite sushi restaurant!  I made reservations for seven and the six of us arrived, eyes big, stomachs empty, and ready to eat some of the best sushi on the West coast!  Instead, this night was an unbelievable trip down ""are you f'n kidding me"" lane and ended with us swearing off Sushi Ko, for life.

1.  I had made reservations for six and, they made us squeeze into an area set for five.  So asses to elbows, we proceeded to look over our menus.  Wait.  Where are the menus??

2.  Our waitress proceeded to yell at us OVER the grill for our orders.  And when that wasn't working, she leaned over the grill so far her apron was burning on the grill;

3.  No utensils, no napkins, no soy sauce, no wasabi, no dishes to mix and dip sushi;

4.  Waitstaff continually bumped into our chairs and banged into our arms trying to get between the back wall and those of us seated between the wall and grill;

5.  The hibachi chef clearly didn't understand that he needed to speak up and over the incredible noise of the exhaust fan at our grill;

And then, really downhill-

1.  Our steaks were cooked and served, at least what we thought were fresh, juicy, fantastically flavored steaks.  Nope.  Not sure what they were trying to pass off here, but tasted like what I would assume dog food would taste like;

2.  Chef missed one of us when dividing up the vegetables.  Instead he piled on the plate of an 8 year old girl with enough vegetables (and rice) to feed her for a week;

3.  Three of us could not eat the steak, and did not eat any of it past the initial bite;

4.  My fiancé spoke with the manager and explained the problem with the steak and that it was inedible and if we could only have the steaks taken off the bill. She pointed out that the shrimp was on the menu and we would be willing to pay that price, essentially paying for the food we ate;

5.  When the manager returned with the bill, without a word or even a breath of apology, she threw the bill on table and walked off.  She had removed one meal.  My fiancé went back to her, assuming there must be some misunderstanding, and was told, ""too bad, this is the way that it is.""

6.  I went to manager and very calmly and very nicely asked her to explain her position as we did not intend to pay for the food in the three meals that we did not eat,  COULD NOT eat- and what we were willing to pay for, like the shrimp, was more than fair.  She said, ""Either pay for the meal or I am calling the police.""  Pardon?   When and HOW did we jump from, ""hey we have a real concern about the quality of the food you are serving"" to ""I am calling the police."" ???

How did she get her job as manager?  How does she still have a job?  In what reality is someone this rude hired as the MANAGER of a restaurant?  Instead of working with us and listening to our legitimate concerns, she threatens to call the police???

7.   We agreed to pay for the meal and our parents had decided that if that was the case, they would take the food home and do SOMETHING with it.  However, shortly after paying, I learned our table had been cleared, and when I inquired about the food and why it was cleared, I was told by the manager to ""Go F*CK myself.""  I am sorry?  Say what?  Go F*CK myself??  Is she kidding me???

Again, how does someone this rude and possessing the IQ and mental ability of a sixth grader become manager of a restaurant?

This night will certainly rank as Most Unbelievable for quite some time.  Also, we will never eat at Sushi Ko again.

Oh, one more thing... my fiancé threw up just outside the door and my mom is sick- both of them ate the steak.",r7tH-57no1iLcHeO-AkFHA,5,2,1,XrMREmPreoZ4takX6lXl8w

Sushi ko has changed management a time or two which I've hoped would set the ship back on course but today is my last time seeing if it'll get better.

The employees are not personable anymore and untrained. I used to go several times a week and now I just sat for 30 minutes with no one even confirming my order was in or talking to me. The new chefs look very tired and have no character. They looked sad and didn't talk to me even once. It wasn't very busy and I notice the new manager is replying to other Yelpers with a lot of excuses - won't work here.

The food has gotten worse. This place has the worst cucumber salad I've ever seen. The portion sizes of my salmon salmon roll has noticeably decreased over time and the prices have increased.

Do you want more business? Bad yelp reviews and poor product / customer service isn't the way to do it.

The cherry on top is I had to kindly ask someone for a check to pay and when I left the people that ignored me followed me to the door panicking to ask if I had paid. Now I'm stealing? Miss, I've been to your establishment 50+ times this year and have seen you on most of them.

1525624,2016-11-06,1,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"Thus used to be a go to spot for my family to have sushi, however since the original owner sold the restaurant, it hasnt been the same quality. 

Food:
Green tea was served at a lukewarm temperature, and needed to be sent back to be remade.

The sushi roll i ordered was clearly made by an amateur. The roll was cut into uneven pieces, and sauce on the plate seemed to be drying out before it got to my table. 

I ordered the rock shrimp appetizer, and it unfortunately was underwhelming. All I could taste was the batter, which wasn't really impressive at all. Bland batter and low quality shrimp will never lead to a hot dish.

Service
My dad likes grilled yellowtail collar. I understand its usually limited and often runs out at multiple restaurants, however the server was unaware of the status of availability. 

The server was too soft spoken, so we could barely hear anything he was saying. When he brought over the food, he held the plates in a way so that his thumb was almost in the food (We are talking a couple of millimeters). Believe me, if his thumb was in my food, I would have sent it back and tell him to try again.

From observation, it looked like it was either the owner or manager sitting at the back of the sushi bar. All he was doing was going to the kitchen to get food out to his spot. There was no interaction between him and the guests. To me, that was one of the bigger fails of this establishment. I know that the prior owner would come around and greet all the guests in the restaurant. That is one of the things that used to keep us going back to this place. 

I dont plan on coming back. You have lost a repeat customer, which is how restaurants stay afloat. Great job.",I2KPKbNkuQFc91k-UHbN5w,3,0,1,9x7yELZTJQ6eGvtnyjD2TA

1543852,2015-09-20,1,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"We went here Friday night, first time back in years... total mistake. Waitress earned the single star, she was good. In fact, she was so enthusiastic about their food that she could probably talk a vegan into trying stuff. Word of warning, though, don't.

First, the interior. Dirty, dated, scuffed. Did I mention dirty?

Ordered a variety of foods:

Pink Taco - lettuce wrapped around fried fish with a flavorful, spicy sauce. Be careful, though, it's main purpose is to pull you into thinking you're going to have a great dinner.

Foie Gras - while wrapping sashimi around tiny dabs of foie gras might be innovative, each would have been better without the other. You get two very tiny pieces for $5.

Sonomono Salad - Hubby loved, but I would give it an ""okay"". Both of us agree, though, that it was the best part of the meal.

Short Ribs - Hubby ordered, then the waitress returned and let him know they were out of them. At 7pm on a Friday.

Chicken Wings - There's 5 in an order (despite what the waitress had said) and they were properly cooked. The Korean chili sauce was good but the after-taste wasn't.

Various nigiri - none of it was fresh. It was either not sushi-grade or badly cut, not sure which, but it is the only time I have spit sushi out of my mouth. We didn't get ill, but we did get repulsed.

Lemon Roll - was actually good, initially, but then I bit into something that crunched and there was nothing in the ingredients that would crunch. Didn't eat further and tried not to think too much about that crunch.

When we complained, our waitress disappeared for a while then returned with an offer of $20 off our next visit, which we laughingly refused. We asked to pay so we could leave, but she disappeared again. This time, she returned with a comped meal where we only paid for the parts we liked. She handled that part well, but it doesn't change the fact that the meal was disgusting and we will never return.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,12,1,1,CCh6ce4Gvk3h38GlRmpFiA

It used to be a go to dinner place for us at least once or twice a week, now, only if it's take out and even then I am not sure about it anymore.. They get two stars instead of one only because their food is always great, but hey, if you are looking for a playground where you can eat sushi, this is the place you want. Every time we went there, there were SOOOO many children with hungry and distracted parents, not paying attention to their kids disrespectful behavior to others, it's crazy. Kids screaming, crying, oh, and the clown making them squeaky balloons to play with does not help the situation at all. Not a good atmosphere for child-free adults. Also, the place doesn't really seem to appreciate return business. Our last straw there was when the waitress brought us two oyster shooters that we didn't order, which we informed her of, but she didn't really seem to know who they belonged to so we offered to keep them. When the bill came, she charged us for the shooters she brought that we didn't order. Before this happened, Sushi-ko wasn't only our go to sushi place, my boyfriend had several business dinners there with his partners worth a very significant amount, we don't anymore and will not until the servers are trained properly, know what their doing and until that clown is out of there.

Myself 2 others spit out bits of their food because they had things in them.. 
The traditional side condiments you get with your meal were never given/poured for us. So our meal was left bland with nothing to help curb the taste. 
My husbands shrimp still had the poop veins left in them and he was chewing on sand/grit.. 
I'm actually appalled, I have never been to such a bad hibachi grill. This place gives Japanese food a bad name. And we are a military family who has lived in Okinawa Japan..

The staff was really cool and willing to chat with us, they didn't rush us out or anything.  I want to give it more stars but the food wasn't unique.. it's not the most memorable food.  I usually go for sashimi and there was some listed but the menu focused more on rolls, tempura, and other things.  Overall it looks very well rounded but the couple things we ordered had very similar flavor profiles when their descriptions sounded very different.  One had siracha and was tempura fried and in ponzu while the other had siracha.  Also, anything listed as spicy is a lie.  I know most people would consider some things spicy that I might register as mild.. but anything listed as spicy here lacked heat.  It always feels like accidental false advertising whenever this happens.  Someone would have to be oversensitive and consider black pepper as super spicy to consider these items spicy.  Seriously, the people here are really cool, and if you're in the area looking for sushi in general this will do, the menu just doesn't stand out.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,1,1,3,Zt-zeXQ3yToAASOseQLPoQ

But, since we were already here, we decided to stay and so glad we did!  We stopped in six weeks prior and were happy with the service and food, so much so that I wanted to try it again before reviewing since there are conflicting ratings.  Well, I now feel ready to write a straight-up review based on tonight and last month's visit.

The servers, on both our visits, were attentive and prompt.  We over ate and overspent both times because they were on the ball and ready with the drinks, refills, and genuinely wanted to know if things were to our liking and if we wanted anything else. Of course we are easily swayed when our sushi, sashimi and grilled items are delicious! At last month's visit, we ordered a variety of sushi (ngiri, classic and creative rolls) and grilled items. The grilled calamari wasn't just a jumble of rings and tentacles--it was a nice presentation of the entire squid! We also recalled that the yakitori and pork belly sliders were tender and flavorful. Also at last month's visit, we were entertained by watching the teppanyaki chef, Don, conducting his fiery food techniques in such a fun way. Like dinner and a free show.

Tonight, hubby and I ordered enough to feed a small army. Starting with both salmon and maguro (tuna) sashimi, the no-rice rock-n-roll #3 with crab mix/shrimp tempura/wrapped in cucumber, green mussels, and rattlesnack (tortilla wrapped tuna with jalapeno and other spicy ingredients)--we proceeded to devour every morsel, washing it down with hot sake and chilled beer. Because the Scottish salmon was buttery good and the tuna so fresh, we placed another order. The second order was a work of art--I posted pictures because my description can't do it justice--it was a large shallow bowl filled with decorations, greenery and flowers worthy of the Bellagio Conservatory! I had to thank the cute sushi chef for his pretty art.  It was so gorgeous I didn't want to dig into it, but we couldn't resist. The tuna was again slices of deep red ocean goodness and the large pieces of Scottish salmon--oh my, we are now devotees of that buttery, delicious salmon. And since we didn't celebrate Fat Tuesday this week, we designated tonight as our Fat Friday, then ordered the Alaskan roll as our dessert.

More than two hours and over $100 later, we waddled out happy, even though we missed Happy Hour by a day. I'm glad to give 5 stars because both our recent visits were enjoyable, with prompt and courteous service, delicious sushi, fresh sashimi, and great grilled dishes.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,3,3,5,0Ln0RXvdVBvZs2tT7kBXUA

Specials board on the back wall alerted us to fresh sashimi options- selected a 9-piece sampler with two oysters, for $15. The mixed shrimp and veggie tempura platter was a large portion, served hot and fresh out of the fryer. Batter was thin, oil was fresh, veggies were crisp, more than fair for $9. But the rolls really surprised us: Firestarter and Little Tokyo were both large, fresh rolls, with tasty sauces. I'd come back for more of their specialty rolls.

I was genuinely surprised to have such a positive experience, given the mixed reviews and the discounts available.

It was still pink and raw and he hovered it over a little girls plate. I mean seriously?? Does he not know that the RAW chicken juices can fall into that little girls plate? This is UNACCEPTABLE. HE even jokingly hovered the RAW meat over a woman's plate. She was taken back by it too because of the juices that spilled on her plate. She looked across from me and shook her head. I did the same as well. If you want better Habachi Service DO NOT GO HERE, I'm still suffering from my food poisoning (cramps, fever, shakes, nausea, and lots of vomiting). I also read from a post on 02-15-2015 that a man ordered their mussels for appetizer before the Habachi Cross Contamination Grill show. He states ""there was something wrong"" with them. Read the owners response. Sushi Ko: for the lack of a better phrase: get your current HABACHI GRILL cook fired.",gwfXV_HPNbhBhTKK131xyg,3,2,1,Mqv4NV4OPXm7py987uuOvQ

Check Groupon for deals! 

I met some friends here for dinner one Thursday night. We had to make reservation as my friend had bought a Groupon to use for the teppanyaki dinner. Teppenyaki is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. Thanks Wikipedia. Basically, the chef cooks the meal in front of you on an open grill.

The Groupon deal (for 4) comes with soup, salad, fried rice, protein and veggies. You can choose between chicken, shrimp and steak, for proteins. I chose the steak and shrimp combo. It was also happy hour, which is daily from 5-7, so we chose a sushi roll to share for only $5. 

The miso soup came out first and it was fine. If you've had one miso soup, you've had them all. A house salad with ginger dressing came next. None of us really cared for the dressing that came on it. After this we waited a short while until the chef showed up. There seemed to be only one chef for the whole dining room, but maybe there are more when it is busier. The chef did a few tricks while he cooked our food. Nothing too over the top, but it was cool to watch. Our food was prepared quickly and we were eating in no time. Everything was hot and tasty. I will say I didnt particularly care for the sushi roll, that was the only disappointing thing for me. But other than that, I would for sure come back here again for teppanyaki.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,4,4,YpyjK1NnPIZLm3sGbsVKGA

We ordered take-away baby lobster roll and the spicy spider roll.
Both tasted ok, but nothing to write home about.  Here's my issues : 
The baby lobster roll is made with crayfish, not lobster.  I'm sorry, crayfish is NOT baby lobster.  It's a completely different shellfish with a very different flavor.  I was not impressed.  The spicy spider roll was in fact spicy, but it didn't have deep fried soft shell crab, it had imitation crab! If I'm going to be paying 30 dollars for two sushi rolls, I want them to be the real deal, not cheap and bad-tasting imitations.  There was one little deep fried crab claw sticking out to fool me into believing that there was real crab in the rest of the roll, but I pulled them apart and found no other crab.  What I did find, however, was raw chunks of carrot and yellow bell pepper, which was kind of unappetizing.  It really threw off the flavor of the sushi.  

The worst part was that we got take away because we left our new baby at home, and we sat there waiting for our food for an HOUR.  This was so disappointing.

Not gonna lie, I was slightly worried before walking in that I was going to spend an hour and half here to get seated, order, eat, and pay (happens A LOT at sushi joints); however, that was so not the case. *smiles big*  I was sat down at the sushi bar within 30 seconds of walking in and given a cucumber salad (FREE) and my beverage within 2 minutes of sitting down.  Then, I took a gander at the glorious menu! 

The menu had wonderful pictures to accommodate the majority of the rolls that were offered on the sushi list which made happier than a pig in...well you know :)  I found something that sounded and looked appeasing and put in the order.  Within about 6 minutes my delicious looking rolls sat before me in all their glory, needless to say I dived in an attacked them!

The rolls had some really strange flavors I could not identify, the spicy tuna roll and scallop roll tasted funky and bitter right off the bat, no one wanted to finish them.

A few of the other cut rolls we ordered were just put together poorly, and fell apart as soon as they were touched.  I needed a spoon to eat them.

I ordered chicken fried rice for $8.50 and I was fairly satisfied with the meal. It was a lot and I do believe it was worth the price paying for. 
At the end of the entire meal, we payed separately. It took longer than it should have to get our card / cash back. Overall the experience and service was alright. The price for my meal came out with $10.57 including gratuity.

I ate here on June 3rd. My BDay. My wife had to do things and couldnt attend. I liked it so much I decided to go on Groupon and rebuy the same deal. The man who took our reservation and sat us was great.  The ladies refilling drinks were awesome. Sushi before dinner was great. Then the chef comes
First thing out of his mouth ""why did you guys come here so late?"" We both thought it was a joke.... nope. ""Today is my brothers memorial and now I have to stay here for you two. I dont even really work here I just agreed to help them out. I shouldn't even have shown up."" My wife looked at me and said ""should we let him leave?"" We both thought how horrible his brother just died. Nope. His next comment was ""It will probably be over when I get there. We have a little party for him every year and now im stuck here with you guys""
Normally I'm not a passive person. However I havent had much experience telling someone to stop being rude when it involves a dead family member. So we just remained quiet. He turned what was on June 3rd a 15 min cooking show into a 3 to 5 min speed cooking session. My rice is almost raw. My veggies are hard in the center. The rest is decent but not a flavorful as they were cooked for 1 to 2 mins tops. 
Our reservation was at 9. We got there 20 till and had drinks and some sushi before. He began cooking at 9pm by 920 we were asking for boxes to get away from him. 
I told the main waiter I feel bad because if they are splitting tips I'm not giving them anything. That guy is a complete asshole and ruined our night. He said if I used cash he could make sure. So I did. I gave the staff $32 and we left. I did tell the waiter why. The people who were leaving that are before us were also talking to eachother about stuff he had said to them and how they couldnt believe it  
It sucks because I liked the place. However they messed up. I'm never eating there again. I eat at Kaizen 3 times a week minimum.  I thought I had found my new spot. Now I will never spend another dime there. More over I plan to let me friends who told me about the place on my BDay know as well. 
So there food is great. The hibachi chef who is skinny and sounds like some street thug sucks. If you decide to go there there is a younger bald kid. He was awesome on my  birthday. If you get the 30ish longer hairs skinny asain guy... you're screwed. I'd just leave. Seriously",-cnwGfP7X2QctCv2aJApuQ,1,0,1,-oLQwo4-aiZ9K_QpanP7jw

The shrimp tempura roll wasn't what I expected.  It had the sweet soy sauce on top of the roll and avocado and cucumber.  I'm used to yum yum (spicy mayo sauce) inside the roll instead of that soy sauce on top, so I wasn't happy with it at all.  Shrimp is sweet as it is, and that particular sauce was way too sweet for me.  Their tuna sushi is good, and their crab sushi was good, too.

I am picky when it comes to sushi, so I'll stay away from here if I am looking for just that.  They are good for teppan off the strip, for sure, so I'll keep this as my teppan stop near home instead of my sushi stop.  I know people will disagree because they are used to their personal types of rolls and sushi, but the way that they make theirs is not what I'm used to from home or eating in Japan.

We called when we were on our way because I just feel like it's easier for them if they have an idea who's coming in the door, plus I hate waiting for food Lol We were sat right away and service started within 10 minutes. 
The salad was perfect! Very fresh and the dressing was awesome, one of the best I've ever had. The miso was good too.  
I had the filet w a side of scallops, which I wasn't sure if 4oz of scallops would be enough but it was plenty. 
The chef had crazy knife juggling skills, very impressive. It was sort of memorizing watching him cook the rice. The timing of the food could have been a bit better, the rice came 5 min before vegetables, then scallops another 8 min, and finally my filet about 10 min after that. I like to eat it all together, and of course I expect some lag between, but it seemed more than I'm used to and was a lil frustrating at the time (you know, when I was hangry). But all said and done I was able to portion it out well and came home with a whole nother complete meal with equal amounts scallops and meat.
The meat was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The scallops were also cooked perfectly and were so delicious, way better than I expected even.
 
We originally went to another spot but left because of the wait, when we sat down at Sushi-Ko we said we'd try the other place next time; but after this meal I'm not sure I want to bother going anywhere else (although, I do wish they had more than just saki on their cocktail menu)",QKfZqCzMdAz9CTYrhC5DjQ,1,2,4,UCLkxzyylIyh6mf6_dxODw

When we arrived, there were one large group and a smaller group at the teppan grill. You would think that the service would be excellent considering the restaurant was not busy. The server (by the way is the manager, Michelle) was very condescending and lacked any customer service skills.
 
We asked for prices on a couple of items and were given the wrong prices - one being the cucumber salad.  Apparently, you don't get the complimentary cucumber salad unless you sit at the sushi bar even though we ordered sushi rolls for our table. The salad took longer than normal to arrive as they had to make 'fresh' salad because the current batch was no longer edible. I didn't need to know that.  Salad finally arrived but tasted like a cucumber as there was not time for vinegar, sugar and salt to soak in the flavor.

The chicken in the teriyaki bowl was raw. When we brought it to the manger's attention (again she was our slow server), she had to call the owner for direction as to how to handle the situation. The manger eventually came back to our table and said 'so what's up'?  Really?!  I had to explain again about the raw chicken. She offered us a half order of chicken to compensate for the raw chicken that was served to us. I don't think so! One raw chicken is enough. I asked if we could get a discount off the item and was denied a couple dollars back into my pocket.  Business must be slow, I wonder why?
Needless to say, I will NEVER eat there again and DO NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone! (I think that it's pretty bad when you pull up yelp and most of the negative reviews are about one woman in particular hmm...)",wwjX6foLN-ZZ20A7GwErgQ,0,0,1,kspzt8aMyXuYuXAeY2e86w

3255624,2008-08-23,2,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"I hope this review makes sense. Sushi-Ko was good by American standards. It is the best Japanese food we've come across in the states. But if the place was actually in Japan it would be the worst Japanese food we've tried. Does that make any sense at all? 
We moved to Vegas last year after nine incredible years in Japan. We've had a heck of a time finding good, authentic Japanese food. We really want some good yakisoba. I was sure this was going to be the place because, as I understand it, it is owned by a Japanese man. I was wrong--this was not the place for good yakisoba.
The yakisoba was not good. The noodles were wrong. The dish was FULL of vegetables. In Japan they use mostly noodes, then some meat and then a bit of veggies. This dish from Sushi-Ko was more veggies than anything else. And the flavor was not there at all. Street vendors in Japan sell better yakisoba. Sadly, this was actually the best attempt we've seen in the states.
We also orderd the beef dunburi. The beef was actually very good. The terkiyaki was just right and the meat was tender. However, it was served on FLUFFY rice!! I was very disappointed in the rice and it ruined the entire dish for me. For some reason Americans like fluffly rice. I don't get it and I don't get what fluffly rice was doing in a place that supposedly serves Japanese cuisine. 
The gyoza were good but not at all like what you'd get in Japan. Sushi-Ko's gyoza was made in a like a crispy fried shell. In Japan they are served in what is more like a noodle. Think of it kind of like a ravioli. It wasn't what we were used to. I prefer the noodle version but the gyoza was still good. 
I ordered the smoked salmon sushi and was very disappointed. It was not like any smoked salmon I ever got in Japan. Not even close. Plus, it had a funny chemical taste to it. It did not taste fresh at all.
The California rolls with  crab were actually very good and worth the extra money for the real crab rather than immitation. But finding good California rolls in the states is not an oddity. 
Overall I was very disappointd with the place. If you've never tried authentic Japanese food then this place will probably be a treat.  However, if you've been exisiting on authentic Japanese food for the past nine years then you'll notice that this place is like all the Chinese places in the states--totally Americanized.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,2,0,3,L0jmghSq2vPi5SMa3ChYsA

It was an early dinner cause several people have kids. We got there around 5 pm. Not many people were in the restaurant nor was there anyone at the teppanyaki tables. We sat and waited for the entire party to arrive. It took a really really long time to get drinks served...sign #1 we should have gotten out of there. Sign#2 the waitress could not get any drink order right. As new people would show up they also sat there forever waiting to get drinks. Finally as everyone arrived and everyone finally had drinks we ordered. Remember we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. 1st ones at the teppanyaki table with a group of about 8. BIG SIGN #3...The waitress fired up the tables to get them warm for our dinner. As soon as she did......OMG.....roaches started scrambling.  I guess the heat from the table woke them up.  We saw two running for cover and one ran directly across the cooking surface. We notified the waitress and she blew us off and said dont worry, we will just cook on the other one!  I was mortified. Meanwhile, another roach had made its way onto the table. We told the waitress again and she covered it up with a plate and cotinued to ask us what we wanted for dinner. They brought salads, and I was like...are you kidding.? We are leaving this place faster than you can say teppanyaki. The whole party of 8 left shortly there after and went to OhJah Sushi for a spectacular meal and service and no roaches!! Please use caution eating here. We notified the health dept as well.

3413743,2018-01-05,1,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"We used the Groupon for $40. If a bento box with three items is $19.50, I am not sure what the up charges were on the receipt. I hate to nickel and dime but it comes down to the fact that purchasing a Groupon allows people to try different restaurants and personally based on the first impression of a place decides whether the patron will go back. Nowhere on the menu does it state different prices based on the items you chose for the box. Super shady to charge extra for items that were not stated as extra in the menu and for this reason only I cannot patronize this place no matter how good the food or service was.

 For all the other Groupon's purchased, the prices have been clearly stated and you end up paying for drinks and a tip. Not the case here.

We reserved the habachi table for 13 people two days prior to the evening we were planning on going with no issues. We show up with half of our party, and not even ten minutes later do they sit another party at our table taking the seats we reserved. We attempted to talk to the waiter, but were advised they would be really quick so this wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later the rest of our party arrives with nowhere to sit. After some discussion we were moved to the other habachi table that had been closed for the evening. We were at the table five minutes when a ROACH skitters across the habachi table. When we let the waiter know he didn't seem too fazed. 
Since there were so many of us we stayed, against our best judgement. We weren't offered any sort of compensation for what we had gone through or witnessed. Not even an apology.

They have 2 teppanyaki tables that seat 8-10. 

We arrived super early for our reservation so there wasn't room for us at any tables. The hostess was extremely apologetic even though we were the ones 40 minutes early. She seated us at the sushi bar and we were immediately served drinks & salads while we waited. Throughout the night, the service was excellent. Wow what a show!

A few minutes later we sat at our table and started looking at the menus. Shortly after seven, four of the party of five showed up and got their menus. We got our soup and salad and it took an entire hour to start the actual meal. It seemed like we were waiting for the 5th person to show up even though they were well over an hour late. Then he started cooking the food and every single thing he cooked had at least an entire stick of butter on it. I have never experienced that much butter in food before.

Yes. Was the food good? Yes. Are the prices ok? Yes. But the way my friends have been talking about it to me, you'd think they just witnessed the arrival of the last Messiah.

We didn't make a reservation or anything, just walked in. From the looks of it, only the teppanyaki table really needs reservations, anyways. There were still two tables open and plenty of seats at the sushi bar on a Friday night. The server in the front was quick to say hi and told us we could sit down wherever we want to. We sat towards the corner so we could see the lively atmosphere and flames teppanyaki grill. There are a couple of TVs around the room, so people don't get bored. It's probably a good thing too, if sports are playing.

I'm not really a big fan of fresh fish, so I ordered the pork belly bowl for myself. That's one of the plus points about this place. It has plenty of options for people who don't like sushi. The food was pretty good. It came in a timely manner and looked appetizing. The pork belly tasted juicy and included rice, so that was good.

We purchased a groupon deal online before we checked out. The paying process was simple enough, and they do split checks, but then it gets complicated with the discount, so I recommend just paying it all on one bill and figuring it out after.

Lisa Lisa and the Hot and Sexy were gone in moments- fresh and tasty. The Popcorn Lobster was very rich and shared around the table.

Their sushi is decent I'm not much of a roll person but my favorite roll is at this location out of all the sushi places I've been. The Bonzai roll which is a salmon, crab meat, avocado, deep fried and and served with creamy tangy sauce. 

Teppan: This is the only sushi restaurant I've seen with Teppan which is a style of Japanese cooking where the chef cooks in front of you. Which is a pretty neat experience, most of the time these chefs are super social so they're not just chefs but also cooking entertainers.

Customer Service: The customer service here is pretty decent, expect one time I had a hard time flagging a girl down to refill my hot green tea and also had a hard time trying to get my check. 

Location: This place is right off the free way of 95 & Craig which makes it a prime location also its in a busy shopping center and on the far side of the shopping center so people passing by can see their sign on the side of their building.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,2,0,3,UE2gc7nuef6ML9T2U-EKOQ

4508073,2016-12-20,1,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"I'm only giving it 2 stars, because the girl who took care of us was nice and the food was good. My party of four came in at dinner time on a Monday night. The restaurant is small (maybe 9-10 tables, the sushi bar, and two huge hibachi tables). We had a Groupon and there seemed to be some debate amongst the two working the floor regarding what that entailed. From what I could gather, there was one server, one sushi chef, and one manager. The manager ended up serving us. 

We finally got the Groupon menu and placed our order: four orders of nigiri, a Lemon roll, a Japanese Lasagna, a Jessica roll, a soft shell crab hand roll, a Spider roll, and a Philadelphia roll. We were supposed to also get fried rice and oysters (the girl was going to give us the oysters since we waited so long) but we never got either during the meal. I think the other two in our party ended up taking the rice home. The food was good, not the best sushi I've ever had, but definitely not even remotely bad. The Lemon roll in particular was great. 

We also got some of the sake. We had the white peach and the cherry. They weren't very potent, but that was good because they were delicious and I would've gotten trashed if they were strong. 

Now, for the issues. They were ridiculously understaffed. I get it, honestly I do, but it was outrageous how two people and one chef had to take care of a full restaurant.  Another point to make is that we didn't even get the right nigiri; we ordered one unagi, but instead got double salmon. While I like salmon and had ordered one, my boyfriend was a little put out. At that point, however, we were to hungry to argue. The woman who took care of us was very sweet and that wonderful attitude never faltered, even though it was plain to see how much stress she was under. 

We were there, in total, almost three hours. That wasn't due to us. As soon as we got the menu, we ordered everything within minutes. It just took forever for everything to come out. Since we didn't get the rice while dining, we didn't really fill up. 

I'm not sure if we'll be coming back. My boyfriend and I live on the other side of town and it's not worth the drive. The other two in our party might, for take out at least. I wasn't kidding about how great that Lemon roll was. The food was spectacular, but management needs to schedule more people and/or hire more. If someone calls out, there needs to be more staff available to handle it.",zjswDQVJkO-NYS0O0GDHBg,4,0,2,Gvqyanxw-vjRRWOxg-og0Q

The Sushi chef, Michael I believe, was very polite. There was an obnoxious couple on the other side of the sushi counter, being loud, but Michael kept his composure. 

The sushi was fantastic. This was my first time to eat sushi up at the counter, and obviously my first experience with quality fish, because it had much better flavor, color and texture than I have ever seen before. The nigiri cuts were very generous, and the rolls were a good size as well. You definitely get what you pay for. Food service was very prompt, but the beverage service left a lot to be desired. I was never offered soy sauce, and there was not a single bottle on the counter. Thankfully, the sushi was so delicious I did not need the soy sauce. It also took a long time to get a drink, and I was never offered a refill until I was basically done, and then they brought me water instead of the soda I was drinking. I observed the couple across the counter get several refills before I was even offered one. The waitresses were hiding somewhere because one never even walked by for me to ask for a refill. 

I am hoping that the poor beverage service is because I went an hour and a half before closing, and they were obviously starting to clean up, and not the norm.

So we order the simple plain rolls from their menu. Still $5-$9 for some basic rolls. The actually good rolls are $10 and over. 

And honestly I have never in my life had worse sushi than this. Honest to god some pieces of rice were still hard and everything tasted very old and not so fresh. 

I ordered extra eel sauce or umagi sauce as some of you may call it and extra spicy mayo. Dudes fucking charge $1.50 for sauce! They wanted to charge me $6 for some fucking extra sauce! 

Which they didn't even fill me in that it was extra! I was furious at this point honestly because my check ended up being around $55 and I was so unhappy with the food quality and the sauce literally put me over the edge because 1. Most places don't even charge for extra spicy mayo or eel sauce. And 2. They didn't let me know it was extra.

You wash your hands and wave your hand by the sensor for paper towel, only to realize there isn't any, but how would you know until you squint your eyes cuz remember, the light is so bright in the room, and see that the dispenser is empty! I would have rated this place with more stars, but I believe that restrooms should be decent. Afterall, the employees are the ones handling your food so you tend to think about the sanitation. How do they dry their hands? On themselves?  Do they even wash their hands? Maybe it's just me.

4717417,2015-08-02,1,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"Unfortunately, this place needs to close for a while and get the kinks out before they restart and try running a restaurant. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. They tried to redeem themselves in the end, but it ruined a birthday dinner... I was still out of pocket $100... And most of my party stopped for fast food after because their food never came, they never had the opportunity to finish ordering... They were still hungry. The irony... We were basically the only people in the restaurant, and based the the good yelp ratings, I actually made a reservation for this place. 

Let's start at the beginning. I walk in... They ask how many... I say I have a reservation. They ask for how many... Not my name... So clearly a reservation wasn't necessary. The place looks nothing like the photos. I thought it was going to be a chic dining establishment nice enough for a bday party. Not.. Hole in the wall sushi joint with two teppanyaki table options. 

Next, we are seated. They take are drink orders. All is fine. They come back mere moments later for our food orders, part of our part had just sat down. My sis in law says she's not ready, so the waitress, with a huge attitude says, ""Well, we'll go to you last then."" That was the beginning of WWIII. It wasn't what she said, it was how she said it. As a waitress, you should always treat your customers with respect, but especially my sister in law, or the claws will come out. She does not get talked down to. I was ready to walk out, but they sent another waitress, the owner apologized, and everything seemed okay... 20 min... 40 min... 60 min... No sushi. A salad and edamame came out... No other food. We were one of three other people dining in the whole restaurant... What had happened? 

At 75 min, I said something... The owner/manager came back out to apologize. Assured us of a discount... Said certain rolls would be removed from our bill. Swore the food was coming... Said the snotty waitress got into a fight with his sushi chef before the fight with our table and things were not going well. I can appreciate that. You're having a rough night. But you see... Everyone around us was getting their food (yes, the three other tables).. And unfortunately... Your bad night has now made our celebration a bad dining experience. That's not cool. Figure out your situation behind he scenes. Don't let it rub off on the dining room. It's too bad because most of what ended up coming out finally was decent sushi. If ambience was nicer, the service better, I may come back if in the area. But no way... Not after that catastrophe of a meal. 

I do thank them for trying to make up for it in the end, but as I said... Damage was done. The waitress we ended up getting after our crazy one lost it and bailed, she was very kind and confused as to where her order had gone and where our food was. But, if it's not working like a team... It isn't working... And you're not giving me anything to come back to. Sorry. :(",dzGuZ0k2RoEEaaXbZNZviQ,3,1,1,PVv9eSRD3KdXTiT7Q49A3A

I was disappointed that the hibachi was about an hour wait, as they have two tables front and back (four total), but only one chef.  Due to this, we chose to do a table rather than wait.

I ate vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  It was pretty good, not bad tempura mix (I hate thin tempura) but the sauce didn't have as much taste as I like.  For dinner I got the binto box with chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu.  The teriyaki wasn't bad, the katsu wasn't horrible but not great.  It didn't have enough meat inside the breading, which is a pet peeve of mine.  The rice wasn't very fresh but was edible.   Service wasn't horrible but you had to ask for things instead of them offering.

The food wasn't horrible, my table mates seemed to like the sushi.  The issue was that several of us got horribly upset stomaches after this meal.  Since they all ate fish items and I didn't, it wasn't just one bad item.

4926001,2017-01-12,2,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"Living up in the Northwest I'm having a hard time finding good Sushi and I'm psyched that I tried Sushi-Ko!  My wife found a Groupon which was a decent deal so we decided to go.  The Groupon included a sushi meal for 2 ($35) which included 2 drinks, a specialty roll, 2 orders of nigiri sushi (4 pieces total), a classic roll, house fried rice, and lastly a banana harumaki.

To start the establishment was in a small strip mall visibility to the street.  The restaurant 1/3 hibachi, 1/3 sushi bar, and 1/3 dining.  The modest environment had huge painted canvases of hibachi and sushi chefs which I thought were fun.  Whoever picked the music playlist had it on some great 80's/90's pop.

The service was very memorable!  The staff had a lot of knowledge of their menu.  I'm normally reluctant to Groupon but the staff had the Groupon menus prepared and t was straight forward.  The waiter always had our waters full and they were always proactive.  I can't say the place felt on high end but the service was reflective of that.

Now on to the food.  The specialty roll we got was awesome!  Unfortunately, I don't remember what it was called so I can't elaborate on it much.  But, my favorite part was the Nigiri Tuna and Albacore.  The pieces were fat and fresh.  There's a reason they don't do All You Can Eat and it's because the fish was high quality!  I thought the fried rice would be a filler just to help them make up margins on their Groupon.  But it was so good!  There were pieces of chicken, steak, and shrimp mixed with egg and other fried rice ingredients.  Lastly, we ordered an additional Mayo Shrimp meal that was not on the Groupon manu.  I highly recommend it!  The desert was a deep fried banana with a lemon sorbet.  It was good but thought it would match much better with a vanilla ice cream.   

Over all, this place was solid!  I'll add it to my list of ""I'm starving but don't wanna cook"" favorite restaurants.  I have yet to try the hibachi but based on the taste of the fried rice I had I wouldn't flinch.  If you haven't tried Sushi Ko and live in the Northhwest it is an awesome spot that deserves loyal patrons!",CLBDMeEs5mONY5uXZ2QRNQ,3,2,4,OYQL9jcOuDwRT4YlLMeyRw

My friends ordered the crispy calamari and white tuna nigiri, while I got the unagi roll. I mainly got it because the combination of the eel and its sauce sounded interesting to me. I did not expect my mind to be blown. If you come here and just order one thing, order the unagi nigiri. It is SO good, I got a second order of it before the night was over.

Whoever makes the sushi really knows his stuff. I read that the sauces are done from scratch. If that is true, the sushi chef here is truly amazing. When I got my roll, the sauce tasted amazing, rich, and had just the right flavor. Forget soy sauce, these rolls are perfect the way they are served! (Nigiri is another story, haha)

Here basically the showmanship was lacking.   The chef was completely uninteractive and the fanciest thing I saw wad a grease fired on the table. And not even in an onion volcano.

As for the food... Mediocre at best! We ordered Jalapeño Yellowtail sashimi and it came in huge, thick pieces. Also ordered the Rock and Roll 1 wrapped in cucumber but it was so poorly executed the cucumber fell apart and everything came out of the roll. And that one tasted too fishy.

Also, I wanted to thank the staff as a whole. I ordered a yakisoba. I generally favor sweeter yakis, so this one was more acidic then I am used to. I don't know if that was intentional or not. I figured it was just the way they cooked it, and was fine to just eat the cost, and just order different next time. However, the staff comped me on it. Very unexpected, and welcome.

5445354,2018-04-24,0,EZ4TljJvGenxrkM4JsqtZg,"We have been searching for a good local Tappan Yaki place to enjoy and I saw Sushi Ko on Groupon and thought...what the heck...let's give it a try. We have been so disappointed by other places we have gone but for the special offer on Groupon I thought it was worth a shot. Thank god I did. We have finally found a local restaurant that we will support!! It was so good. They have a special Groupon menu so deciding what to have was extremely easy. I had the shrimp lovers with fried rice and my man had the NY steak and shrimp combo. 
It came with the traditional soup and salad. However...this soup was so tasty...unlike most places they had a lot of seaweed in it which adds so much flavor. We were lucky enough that the party that was supposed to sit with us decided to have sushi instead so they sat in the normal table side. So we got the show all to ourselves!! We felt so special. The staff was great. Very attentive and always made sure our glasses were full. We added a 3 skewer plate for an appetizer, shrimp, chicken and steak, and we also ordered the deep fried lobster skewers. Linnen was our Chef! He was amazing...you could tell he has been doing this for a VERY long time. Everything was cooked to perfection...but I have to say...my favorite part was the rice, he made it just a tad spicy and put another aioli sauce on it and it was so packed full of flavor that we didn't even use the sauces he gave to us. The shrimp was perfectly buttered and garlicy!!! We are so glad that we came and will definitely be back!!!

No, this is not your traditional Japanese place, and I'd like to think Ive had a lot of authentic Japanese cuisine.  But I would be stupid to compare Sushi-Ko to a ""traditional"" place.    (This is a response to the disgruntled reviewer below who was looking for yakisoba and gyoza... HELLO- did you try ANY of their fabulous rolls?? oops....sorry, I think I inadvertently called you stupid. ) 

Sushi Ko is great in that its food is completely NOT traditional.  Its edgy, new, and enlightens my tastebuds.   

A lot of similar nouveau places in California (Ive mentioned this in an another review) TRY to do this, but the execution is poor and sloppy -- as in they just slather rolls with mayo+sriracha and charge you 14 bucks.  This is NOT how Sushi Ko does it. Their sauces are unlike anything Ive tried and the combinations of flavors are delightful.

And the fish freshness on west coast standards was excellent. 

I know its a bit of a trudge from the strip, but if you are anywhere out there, go to Sushi Ko. Ask what kind of rolls they recommend.
