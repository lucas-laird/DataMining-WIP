439946,2017-11-15,0,dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ,"My friend and I went to dinner at Primrose before Cher's show at the Park Theater. My friend has a rule: Never go to a restaurant that hasn't been open long because they're still working out the kinks. That might have been the case this night. But the evening got off on the wrong foot right away when they tried to seat us right by the kitchen, with heavy traffic going past us constantly. (Someone please tell me why restaurants always do this to two women having dinner together. Please, because it's happened to me all my life. Hello, restaurant people, it's 2017! Women tip as much as or more than men do! We have big jobs, too! We're paying customers, too!) So we had to ask for a different table. The hostess suggested eating in the ""living room"" area, which seemed like a good idea because it was quiet and quite a lovely room, though it's mainly used as a lounge. But the hostess said we could have the dinner menu there, so we agreed. This is where we met the kinks. If you're going to serve dinner in that room, then be ready to prepare the table for dinner. We had to ask for *everything*---napkins, silverware, salt and pepper, sugar for my tea. Nothing was there for a dinner setup, of course, but no one brought it until we asked, and then they weren't very quick about it. Our reservation was two hours before show time so we wouldn't have to rush, but we spent so much time waiting for everything that we actually became concerned about getting to the theater in time.

I ordered the rotisserie chicken and my friend had ratatouille. We both give the food two stars out of five. The chicken was dry and burned in some spots (frankly, I've had much better rotisserie chicken from Sprouts). Framing the chicken were a big clump of burned, but still hard, cauliflower on one side and a big clump of burned, but still hard, broccoli on the other. The rest of the vegetables (potatoes, onions) were meh. My friend's ratatouille was well presented, but as she ate it, she said things like, ""This is really weird,"" and ""I've never had ratatouille like this before"" (and that wasn't a positive comment). She also asked for bread (sourdough), and three big, burned slices arrived with something on the white part that looked like burns, but apparently was olive oil poured on it. It looked very unappetizing. She had to ask for butter. All in all, a very disappointing meal. Couple that with service that screamed ""We don't care!"" at us all evening and I'm pretty sure neither one of us will be going back there. When I say that the attitude seemed like they don't care, it's because whenever we asked for something we shouldn't have had to ask for, the staff barely acknowledged us and went about their business, taking far more time than they should have to bring what should have been brought out right away after we were seated.

If you still think you'd like to try Primrose, wait a while until they get their act together. And ladies, if they try to seat you by the kitchen, ask them why they want to put you there. I wish I had.",2Y0zQA_86H0UtXK-oaWCdg,0,0,1,s2ZsZG7Rhim3E9tCuSPdUQ

I have a hard time understanding how you mess up a salad when you're located on the strip. It had very little seasoning and taste. Entre was decent and dessert was average. Service was sub par considering you'll drop $200 bucks at this restaurant easily for two people.

The wine list is so sparse  and so expensive we couldn't even choose a glass of wine to drink much less a bottle. Our waiter was so ready to please but the menu is so small. We chose a buttermilk Caesar salad.  It had absolutely no taste. Then we shared the salmon and puréed  potatoes. This was very good but $9.00 for a small bowl of puréed potatoes is ridiculous. We can say we loved the salmon.  But that is all we can say   Don't spend time nor money here when Vegas offers such fabulous cuisine,0O_llSqyEgL-jGZTpBDutg,0,0,1,FwtTZBaFa8N_ESvD-GwWJw

1495783,2018-05-23,0,dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ,"Each experience that I have had at Primrose has been fabulous. For the sake of this review - I will be referencing my most recent lunch break.

I had been planning to stop by Primrose for lunch with a friend for a while - due to surprise tasks at work, this kept getting pushed back. Long overdue from a break from the norm, we finally made it in to Primrose.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostesses with warm inviting smiles. It took us a minute to debate if we wanted to venture out on to the patio -  reminiscent of a scene from Alice In Wonderland, brought to life - but we ultimately decided it was too warm after we were informed of the temperature. 

*Pro tip: if you're dining at Primrose in the evening (ESPECIALLY while on a date) sit outside! The lighting is beautiful and romantic. Fellas, you're welcome!*

While we had hoped to dine in the cozy drawing room, there weren't servers assigned to that section at that time, so we settled for a seat in the main dining room. Primrose is the French Cafe you didn't know that you've been looking for in Las Vegas... it's the perfect backdrop for the foodie insta-photographer and the ultimate brunch spot for those seeking a brunch experience.

Service was fantastic! Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink orders - which seemed to appear in the blink of an eye. Our server, Jonathan, was like a magician! He was also super patient because he did not show any signs of annoyance while I took my time figuring out what it was I was going to order. This was not on purpose btw, I had totally neglected reviewing the menu for being a Chatty Cathy (._. )

Turkey Club it is! What a filling lunch. I decided to step off the path of clean eating and indulged in a side of French fries... I can't resist Primrose's French fries - I swear they put magical ingredients in the seasoning. The Turkey Club itself is like two layers tall - I had to remove the center piece of bread. Can't roam too far off the path ;) Bread was perfectly toasted,  bacon nicely crisp and turkey deli fresh! 

My lunch companion went with the Cobb salad which looked absolutely delicious. I think next time I'll give that a try! We skipped on desert because our dishes were quite filling but I'm sure I'll be making another stop at Primrose to satisfy my sweet tooth :)",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,1,1,5,t1M3D2mdErFzNpnMGm8EzQ

Words are just not enough to describe dining here. First, you are treated like you were personally invited from the moment you arrive. The decor is so outstanding it may distract your attention from your date/friends, momentarily! It makes you wish you could wait on your table for just a bit.
Once seated, you are promptly greeted, offered drinks and explained the menu then, (this I love) the server assures you there is no pressure to hurry and order. You can actually enjoy a drink and really think about the luscious choices. We were accommodated by the chef on all our request. The managers (Dana is one) personally comes to your table to see if your meal is perfect. Bottom line,

The new European garden theme resonates throughout the hotel from the green and white painted walls, boutique style rooms, and especially the Primrose restaurant located conveniently near the hotel reception. 

The Primrose is a beautiful space. The natural lighting and decor is reminiscent of a Parisian cafe and the garden seating outside adds to the overall effect. The details to this restaurant from the adorable print on their napkins to their vintage style cups are fun and whimsical. It was the perfect spot for us to have brunch after checking out before heading to the airport for our flight back home.

The food overall is not exceptional but of good quality. Ordered their three eggs plate from the breakfast menu-- it's what one would expect from ordering such item. Husband ordered an omelette which looked good as well. The fingerling potatoes that came with both of our meals were extraordinary!!! Seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.

Primrose is not somewhere that I would go out of my way for but nevertheless a nice addition to the Park MGM.

We happily accepted, and after weeks of not seeing each other due to my crazy travel schedule, we finally reunited in Las Vegas at the (soon to be) Park MGM. As soon as you walk into the lobby you see Primrose sitting pretty over to the left. I am a foodie and I love Las Vegas dining, so I immediately walked right in after dropping our bags in our room. There was a private event happening over on the left side of the restaurant so we were able to be sat right away on the right side of the restaurant. It is a fairly large restaurant that has indoor and outdoor seating, as well as bar - lounge seating and seating in the main restaurant. There is also a beautiful room when you walk in to the left that has games, and reminds you of Parisian dining. This restaurant is a French - American fusion cuisine. I would definitely call it fine dining. I was so excited to hear that they serve breakfast all day. Their breakfast menu extends until 10 AM, but they have about five items that they serve all day. I just wanted a regular egg breakfast and that is exactly what I got. My fiancé and I split a two egg breakfast and added a side of fruit and avocado. Our bill was only $20, and our service was fantastic. Sitting in that adorable room was so much fun. Please see photos. We enjoyed Primrose so much that we returned the next day for a late breakfast. I got the salmon on a baguette with avocado & creme franche spread and my fiancé got the grilled chicken Caesar salad. Portions are on the smaller side, but it was just enough for the both of us. I also got coffee and it was absolutely delicious. They bring the whole pot over to you. Gabriel and Mike were our servers.

Now to the food, although it is a bit pricey, that's what you'll get for dining anywhere on the Strip.  That being said, I do believe it was worth it due to the amazing flavors of everything that we had!  I got the tuna ciabatta and the lavender cocktail, both of which were fantastic!  The sandwich was the 3rd best fish sandwich I've ever had and the 2nd best tuna sandwich!  The cocktail was delightful and had a nice tang due to it having lemon sorbet in it!  My friends got the mozzarella croquette, the primrose cheeseburger, the croque madame, iced tea, and the mistral cocktail, all of which looked (from my point of view) and tasted (from their point of view) fantastic.  

Lunch was very relaxed here.  I don't know if that's because it was a Monday or if it's because this place isn't that well known but either way, it was very nice.

This restaurant exceeded my expectations on my most recent trip to Las Vegas, where all others failed or barely met expectations.

In Vegas I eat breakfast either very early or very late, and when I arrived for a late breakfast I was given the lunch menu. The lunch menu includes some breakfast items, but I wanted eggs Benedict, which I usually order from the Bellagio. The hostess asked the chef and said I could order eggs Benedict.

When the waiter asked if I wanted my eggs Benedict with ham or blue crab I couldn't decide, since I have had both at the Bellagio and liked them equally. So he suggested one of each - brilliant. So I had eggs Benedict - one with ham and the other with blue crab.

I enjoyed the seating where I could view the dining area and pool, the friendly and attentive waitstaff, the ambiance and decor, and the food that was plated for me to enjoy my breakfast.

The craziness of the more popular hotels was not present that morning also adding to a positive experience.

Dishes tried:
- Pancakes (amazing)
- Eggs Benedict (over seasoned)
- Assorted Baked goods 
- Avocado toast

The star at Primrose is the pancakes, hands down the most amazing pancakes I have ever had.  But I do struggle with whether its a pancake or a thin pound cake.  The pancakes are accompanied by a well balanced almond creme, butter, and syrup.  Moist, fluffy, and oh so delish.

On the downside the Eggs Benedict left a lot to be desired.  As an eggs benedict connoisseur I have had my share of really good ones and bad ones. Unfortunately I have to ding Primrose for their over seasoning of the eggs, potatoes, and zucchini.  The english muffin was soft and soggy, I prefer mines slightly toasted.  

The hollandaise sauce was good, but the saltiness of the ham combined with the over seasoning was a huge let down.

The avocado toast and assorted baked goodies were decent nothing to write home about.",OiOR2NtTkfe-SPxsxSa85g,0,0,2,BFDsGQj0uaTVEmrd6updLQ

The decor is a strangely mixed of French country and grandma's house. I think the tables and chairs could be updated or switched to maybe a more shabby chic style to go with the theme.

Once for lunch where I got butternut squash soup and their wild mushroom salad which was warm with lots of garlic and fresh Parmesan. Ran me around $30 with tip. Lunch service was as expected, slow at times but when they got to me the service was great and friendly. They even let me leave the Resturant without paying to run an emergency errand and when I came back 5-10 minutes later my food was still there and they asked me if everything is okay. That's not a normal experience as I would have imagined they would make me pay for the food prior to leaving. There was also lots of communication between hotel guest sitting at tables in the bar area. I got to meet some nice people. 
Because my lunch experience was enjoyable, I went back that evening for a later dinner after a 6 hour photo shoot and I was mentally exhausted and just needed food. At 10:30pm I got a Cesar salad, soup and Moscow mule. The salad was bitter, soup was good and the mule had way too much lime. The server has them remake my drink when she noticed I wasn't drinking it. The next drink was a little better but not by much. For a $20+ drink id expect it to be bigger and taste better. I walked out with soup, salad and drink with tip being $67.00. The only reason I went here is convince and it was bright and inviting. I am sure there are better places to eat with less of a price tag and a more expansive menu. But for the convince it did the job. It's Vegas prices will be outrageous and that's to be expected.

2861075,2017-10-23,1,dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ,"It's DATE NIGHT! And I have to say, my boyfriend did a wonderful job picking the restaurant.

The ambiance- Classy, cafe-like feel, with a touch of elegance is how I describe the place. Upon entering, you beautiful open window doors along the entire restaurant side which opens up the feel. Hostesses politely greet you right at the door asking if you are dining in/have a reservation and leas you through a beautifulllll bar to your right, a ""living room"" style side of the bar and into the dining room. (There is also a sweet ""living room"" to your left of the hostess stand in which I believe you can wait for a table or lounge)

The service-VERY GOOD. Ted was our waiter and he always had great recommendations, related with us as we said we are locals, and checked in with us regularly. Great service. 

The drinks- do it! Do the fancy cocktail! The taste and the price do go hand in hand! 
I had a Lavender Proseggo (? Can't remember the exact name) but it was beautifully mixed with a lavender syrup, Prosecco and lemon sorbet. It was concocted as beautiful as it was presented. 

The food-OMG SO AMAZING. We came here for dinner and their menu stated that they were still in the later construction phases and to ""pardon their exterior"" and menu. New menu? Hey, I'll help! 
         1. Garden fries (starter) -lightly tempura breaded fried dill beans and peppers with a dipping sauce similar to an aioli with a tangy twist. So good! Ted described it so well when asking for suggestions that we decided against our first choice to do this, and it did not disappoint.
        2. Olive oil POACHED Salmon. The salmon was buttery and poached to perfection with just the right amount of butter, lemon, oil & fat, and acidity from the lemon! The capers, small grapes, radishes(? Not sure), and cut potatoes added to the overall taste. Not overly seasoned, but rather, brought out the freshness and well poached salmon very well! 
        3. FILET MIGNON & FRITES. Guys. GUYS. We asked about this Dish and our waiter commented that the guy next to us said it was the best he has ever had. NO JOKE HE IS SO RIGHT.  I am so in awe. It melted like a savory piece of butter in the form of a filet, soft to the cut, well (not overly) seasoned with the perfect chew. Broccolini and fries as the side were delicious as well. It was perfection on a plate. GUYS, IT WASNT EVEN MY DISH and I'm saying this! I have the best boyfriend for sharing! it probably has taken the top filet mignon on my list. 

Overall, I had a great time! love the decor and set up (the dining rooms chairs and tables do look very similar to the cafes in Paris last time I visited in spring!), the service was wonderful(Thanks, Ted!), the drinks and food were amazing! (My only hope is that it is consistently this good, and not just good because it looked like there were important people dining there that night).

Give it a try! Id love to come back for brunch and see it in the daylight! But if not, I'm willing to Make it another dinner date night! And this time, IM GETTING THE FILET MIGNON!",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,3,3,5,z3d0tWNqajKXLYnv_wYCcg

Decor & ambience: 5 stars
Service: 4 stars

It is such a shame, such a waste of Primrose's beautiful decor and ambience, that its food sucked so badly.

The place looks absolutely beautiful: muted harmonious colors, old timey furniture and furnishings, bookcases scattered along the walls.  (The check was brought tucked inside a real, antique-y, book.)  The bathroom was modern and well lit and clean.  The service was attentive and prompt.

The scene killer was the food.  We shared the Buttermilk Caesar Salad, the Fried Chicken Provençal, and the Filet Mignon & Frites.  Only the salad was fairly good, the bib lettuce fresh and crunchy and sweet, the dressing laced with a decent amount of anchovies.  It is, though, a little over salted.

The fried chicken?  I have not eaten at KFC in 25+ years but I would bet one can get better fried chicken tenders there, for a lot less.  Primrose's fried chicken was super crunchy on the outside and that was its only good point.  The pieces are so overdone and so dense, they feel like chunks of ceramic, not protein.  The accompanying aioli was very unremarkable.  We only took a couple of bites each and left the rest, and then asked for it to be taken away.  (We were not charged for it.)

The filet mignon?  We asked for ours medium rare.  You can be the judge from my pic as to whether it's medium rare.  The rarest part was barely pink, and was well done and dry around the edges.  If that's medium rare, I'd hate to see their ""well done""!  Really, how does one screw up filet mignon?  The mushroom mix that came with the steak was mundane, despite supposedly made with bone marrow.  The accompanying fries were quite salty.  When we told the waiter of the saltiness, he offered to get us a new batch ""unspiced"".  Not paying close attention, we said yes.  He did very promptly bring a new batch or piping hot and crunchy fries, but not only it had no salt, it had no spices either!  We should have noticed that the offer was for ""unspiced"" fries, not just ""unsalted"" fries!

So, bottom line is, they need to really beef up their quality control in the kitchen.  If the kitchen can't get the salting of fries, or make a Caesar salad dressing that's not over salted, or cook a piece of steak to the requested doneness, then it's failing at some of the most basic culinary skills.",OEKo94b5Dofy2TssYyn4zw,2,0,1,9_WMpd5nVcQAhXNgMSX1nA

We were in Vegas, and everyone was celebrating the big win (because it seems like the whole Tucson traveled to see the Wildcats play), everything was Bat ""Poo""  crazy! We wanted someplace chill. Little did we know that Primrose would be our safe haven. 
Bry and I hunkered down on some high chairs at the bar side of Primrose. I had my celebratory cocktail, which indeed had bourbon. My taste buds had the pleasure of a Moulin Rouge. This fanciful drink had Bulliet Bourbon, Lillet Blanc and rouge, and classic angostura bitters. I really enjoyed it... So much that I had a few. 
We soon became hungry, so I ordered none other than filet mignon with fries. The filet was sprinkled with a heap of mushrooms and bone marrow duxelle. I ordered it medium rare on the rarer side, and it came out with such perfection. I was as happy as could be! Bry went full Disney on me, and he had the Ratatouille! I must admit even though it wasn't a meat centered dish, this classic French dish was savory and scrumptious. I did enjoy it a lot but that evening, the filet with fries trumped the Ratatouille, (I'm sorry to say)! 
Rory and the other bartender who served us that evening were on point with everything. Even though they were serving up drinks left and right, they carried on awesome conversation when needed and let us eat when we got our food.

Either he is the best actor ever or he really loves his job and is passionate about it.  He is on top of everything and knows food AND knows his wine.  I don't think I have ever had a better server.  I had to reach out to the manager and tell her how amazing the experience was and she literally sat down and listened to everything I had to say.  So incredibly personable and professional!!",GZA--wFPE6dT5oQUOjXebw,0,0,5,mPxFLO-vZtRx4qxo_Q9S-w

My dining partner's water glass came with a lovely lipstick stain.

I get that they weren't serving our table, but if they couldn't complete the simple request they could at least get our server??? 

The French toast was a large brick, it looked much better than it tasted. The crust was burnt and inedible and the interior dry except for the very middle. The omelette my partner ordered was alright, but nothing to write home about.

Regular drip coffee is a whopping $5, and definitely not worth it. I have no problem paying a premium for GOOD coffee, but this wasn't it.

The staff was sooo accommodating. I came with my friend who is doing a bikini body building competition, so her diet is super strict. The chef was able to make her steamed broccolini instead of grilled and rotisserie chicken with little oil. Very nice of them because I know some chefs will not change the menu for people unless it is for allergies. 

Downside is that the food took a while to get to us especially when we were in a rush to get out of there and get our night started.

Even the fries were really good. The turkey was fresh and the dijonaisse really added a good flavor. Everything is seasoned generously but I like seasoning but I can see how someone can think it's too much. 

The madame croque was out of this world. It's brioche bread with ham and gruyere cheese, a Parmesan crust on the brioche and an over easy egg on top. So simple but so good. It comes with a small side of brown mustard I believe and a couple mini pickles. I highly recommend this dish.

The decor may have been nice, but it was really too dark to see.  We asked for a booth and the waiter said none were available.  Three or four were clearly available.  It was so dark, I had a hard time knowing what to order because I couldn't read the menu.  I looked around and saw people at other tables using their cell phones in order to see the menu.  I didn't have mine with me.  When we were being seated, I noticed someone eating spaghetti, so I ordered that.  It was very undercooked.  They did not offer cheese to sprinkle on top and it came with no bread.  Another in our party ordered the Butternut soup, which she said was delicious, but also came without bread.  She asked for bread and some was brought out, but no butter.  She asked for butter and they brought some but it was so hard, it was impossible to spread on the bread.  One person ordered iced tea.  It came in a small glass, maybe 6 oz. and it was half ice.  No refill was offered and the charge for the tea was $7.
The waiter was not quite rude, but certainly not pleasant.
I absolutely do not recommend eating at the Primrose a Cafe.",t4KUIwq6roRr8pFwv8JAtA,1,0,1,OhT61VPDOr3i-krmk9t7hw
5023012,2018-02-25,2,dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ,"The wife and I decided to give Primrose a try for an early lunch on Thursday around 11AM.  Located just off the main lobby in the Monte Carlo, soon-to-be Park MGM, Primrose opened this past Fall as a part of the property's wholesale renovations, serving French-inspired cuisine.  After walking past plywood covering huge sections off of the casino floor, Primrose was an aesthetically pleasing oasis of order amongst the construction chaos.

For my meal, I ordered the Tuna Niçoise salad.  However, they were out of tuna, which also eliminated my second option, the Tuna Ciabatta sandwich.  I don't know if it was because of the renovations going on making customer traffic difficult to estimate or was throwing off food ordering and/or delivery schedules, but if a key ingredient in multiple menu items is unavailable before noon on a Thursday, it may have been indicative of other, systemic problems in the kitchen.  I finally settled on the Farro Bowl, a generous serving of farro topped with a vegetable jus, poached egg, basil pistou, baby zucchini, tomato confit, and fennel pollen.  Service, while friendly, was a bit off, too.  We ordered drinks.  I had a glass of water and the Dirty Bloody Mary made with Kalamata olive-infused Tito's vodka, the house Bloody Mary mix, with a nice dose of grated horseradish.  We got our water, but both of our cocktails were forgotten until we flagged down our server and asked about them.  Thankfully, my Bloody Mary was good and worth the wait.  My Farro Bowl was a good choice as it was appealing to both the eyes and the palate was made even better after I broke the yolk from the perfectly poached egg and mixed it in.

Primrose was far from perfect, but it showed promise.  The food and drink that made it to the table was very satisfying.  However, I think Primrose may grow into a much better dining experience and worth waiting until the renovations to the property are entirely complete.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,3,3,w7dJhtVTOKjMdlMgsjgFGw

So we decided to try the Primrose for breakfast. I have to say the service was excellent, but while not sure what to get we decided to share the Eggs Benedict & a cup of coffee.

In summary, both were just OK and super expensive.  For the meal it ran us $24.90 before tip.

Being a local and having to make more effort to come on the strip, the less schlepping the better, from garage all through the casino to get to the restaurant!

Then the service was great, prompt, friendly and professional. 

We had the sea bass entree which was delicious, broccolini side was nice, and the fire roasted eggplant and butternut squash dishes were both very tasty and amazingly soft and tender.

5304937,2018-06-04,4,dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ,"Back in February I stayed at the Monte Carlo (soon to the Park MGM upon the completion of the overhaul) and when looking at restaurants was surprised to see everything had changed from my previous stay with my wife a couple years back.  After looking through the menu this place looked appealing and I quickly made my way in to get a table.  When asked how many were in my party and said 1 they told me they could only seat my at the bar.  I am not a big drinker and sitting at the bar often makes me feel like a bit of an outcast but I took a seat at was promptly handed a menu.

I ordered an iced tea (see big drinker here) and after perusing the menu went with the spaghetti.  The spaghetti itself sounded delicious but carried a $17 price tag which I found a bit high.  I was surprised to see the food come out of the kitchen quite quickly and the plating looked fantastic but the flavor although good was overpowered by the basil on the plate and was far to herbvacious for my palate.  I was also surprised to see how small the portion size was for the price of the dish but I guess that's to be expected from a Vegas restaurant dubbing itself as a French style bistro.

I can say that the bartender Rory was quite good, friendly and stayed on top of my iced tea.  He greeted my nicely, asked how my day was going and promptly provided the check and took payment of my meal so I appreciate that.  I did feel a bit weird having to sit at the bar (something I felt numerous times in Las Vegas where you feel second class if not eating in a group as if your time and money means less to them than that of a large party) but he did his best to provide a pleasant overall visit.

I would eat here again and try something different but would definitely not have the spaghetti again due to the the strong herb flavor and the fact that after $17 I still left hungry due to the small portion size.

A nice, classy looking restaurant in a soon to be completely revamped hotel in the heart of the strip.  Overall a flawed but decent experience that could have been better and but was far from the worst place I visited on this trip.  I am curious to see how this place evolves and where its at the next time I am in town.",WecdW6ba1-V2MgR19Mo7cw,9,5,3,ePn7pgHbKkPLxhs5rnv0UQ

The dressing was a mouthwatering treat and the tuna was lightly seared to perfection. As great as the Nicoise salad was, the real winner was the Slow Roasted Salmon. I'm not sure how a salmon could be so beautiful, but Primrose has found a way. Brown butter, capers, lemon, potato purée, brioche. Mouthwatering.
