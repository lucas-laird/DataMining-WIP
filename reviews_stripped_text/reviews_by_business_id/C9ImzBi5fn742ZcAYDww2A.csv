2277,2014-07-07,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,One of my favorite breakfast spots the have pot of bread that you can get instead of toast get it ! So amazing it's like a cinnamon bun without the frosting soft melts in your mouth. My family enjoys the red velvet pancakes intense chocolate flavor almost don't even need syrup. The omelets are so fluffy and packed with flavor and the crispy hash browns will knock your socks off. I would recommend anyone to come here bring the family and a plus the service is wonderful Amanda I believe is her name pretty girl with green eyes very attentive our drinks where always full,8bFE3u1dMoYXkS7ORqlssw,0,0,5,KFWFY7nn9iFc2QYYFjFTsQ

92519,2015-01-24,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"I so want to love this place. The decor is whimsical and colorful, and the servers being in their pajamas is a fun touch, but after eating there twice, the food and the service just aren't worth the price. My first trip, about a month ago, I ordered the Ham-N-Eggs Benedict, and it was just OK. The entire dish was barely warm, the english muffin was barely toasted, the hash browns were really nothing special, and the overall dish was just mediocre. I took my friend there for her birthday today, and I was so disappointed in the food and the service that I probably won't be giving this place another chance. I figured that since they call themselves a ""steak and egg place,"" I should probably try their steak, so I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin Steak. The description on the menu on their website says it comes with ""dijon brown butter onions atop a swiss cheese open-faced omelet & hash brown potatoes"" for $13.50.  The waitress asked me how I wanted my steak cooked, and I ordered ""medium."" The dish had not one onion on it, so I politely asked the waitress if it came with brown butter onions, and she said no. I asked her to get the menu, we looked at it together, we could both see the word onions in the description, yet she pointed to the little yellow squiggle of sauce on the omelette and said, ""that is the dijon brown butter there on the omelette."" She then asked me if I wanted a side of onions, and I said no, and I reiterated that the description said it came with onions, yet she flat out ignored that fact. I felt like I was in Bizzaro land. I wasn't rude in any way, I just wanted what the menu described, and she acted like we were reading two different things. Seeing that I took my friend there for her birthday, I was trying to be very nice and low keyed and not draw attention, so I moved on. Next comes the bacon wrapped tenderloins. They were cooked ""well done"" and dry, even though I ordered them ""medium.""  The potatoes were the same as before, really nothing special. They're like thick flat potato shreds with not much tasty crust, so I consider them undercooked and just not my style. So I ate a couple of bites of everything, decided it needed help, so I put some ketchup on the potatoes, hot sauce on the omelette, and A1 on the steak, but nothing helped. It just was not a good breakfast, certainly not a $13.50 breakfast, so I stopped eating at about 1/3 of the way into it. Again, not wanting to draw attention, I figured perhaps the waitress might put two and two together, see that I didn't eat much of it, and ask for some feedback, or see if I wanted anything else, but no such luck. The best thing about this place is the decor and the hope of having a delicious breakfast, but alas, 'tis not enough for me to give them yet another chance.",fpyJxP9wMwlWq5POyc3vcQ,2,0,1,VQGOdTNjk7jIpavD9uPF9g

This year, I googled ""best breakfast in Las Vegas"" and discovered this gem which was only about two miles from my hotel (South Point Resort and Casino).  All the superlatives you've read in the other reviews are absolutely on the spot true.  The décor is cheerful, the service is absolutely wonderful, and the food is very, very good.  I agree with Google that this is one of the best breakfast (and lunch) places in Las Vegas.  Twice I had the rib eye steak and eggs plus the ""pot of bread"".  Once I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Both were great but I liked the rib eye even better.  I always order my steak medium rare and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was perfectly cooked to my liking.

As I walked in I immediately noticed the decor, which is very bright and colorful, with pretty patterned umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, which I found to be a nice atmosphere to start my day in.

The two women at the front counter greeted me warmly and sat me immediately, and told me my server would be Maria. 

Maria asked if I'd been there before, then explained the menu to me when I said I had not. I decided to go with a ham steak breakfast with a pot of French press and some OJ.

Maria brought me my cup of bread, which comes with the breakfast and is apparently a specialty of theirs. I was a bit skeptical as to whether it would be any good, but it was basically like an extremely fluffy cinnamon roll inside of a cup, with the sauce/icing on the side, and I enjoyed it a lot. 

When the ham steak came out I was also surprised, as I was expecting a normal sized, 6-8 inch around, half an inch thick steak. The steak they brought out was at least an inch thick, and probably a foot or so around, a good pound or more of meat. I wasn't sure if I'd even be able to finish it, but it was so juicy, tender, and smoky that I managed to eventually, although I sat there for a good hour or so. 

The eggs and hashbrowns were a bit above average, tasty with a kick of seasoning that isn't usually included, and added some extra interest to the dish. 

The French press is touted as Lavazza, which I've had before at other restaurants. Although as a coffee snob I'll say it isn't the best cup of coffee I've ever had, it is better than the coffee at 90% of other restaurants in Las Vegas, and having a good cup of French press to go with the steak made it much easier to digest. 

The OJ tasted fresh squeezed and had a slice of orange as a garnish, which I was happy about as concentrate at restaurants bothers me. 

The entire time I was there Maria was very attentive to me, always making sure my water was full, if I needed anything else, asking if I liked everything, and joking about being proud of me being able to finish the ham steak. 

As I left I asked for the manager, Gilberto, who I met just so I could tell him that Maria and the front and back end staff were all great. He was very polite to me, asked me what I had, introduced himself, and made me feel like a valued customer.

All in all this seems like it will be my new favorite local breakfast place, and I'm glad they opened up right across the street. The one qualm I have is they need beds in the back, because after you finish one of their steaks you really feel like rolling back into bed and not getting out till after 12 or 1.",OunZ_Zj8-tBMQfQgTRDDyg,0,0,5,IHaMVbut-5JXbTwSloZsQQ

The first is that they do not have pancakes as a side.  I could never eat just pancakes for breakfast. I normally like to get two pancakes to eat with my breakfast,  but that is not offered here. I did, however, find out from our server that you can substitute toast for a pancake. Note that this information is not on the menu. A compromise I suppose,  but I like my eggs runny, and everyone knows that requires toast. The only other option is to order 4 or 5 pancakes. 

But the biggest issue is that many employees touch the areas of dishes and silverware that you put in your mouth. For instance I've seen an employee prepare silverware settings by touching the knives on the blade part,  with bare hands. I've seen many,  many instances of a server ring up an order on the wall mounted IPad and then bring your drink to the table by holding the glass at the top where your lips go.  I have also seen servers grab toast out of the toaster and put it on the plate with bare hands. This is all done without hand washing. I would like the staff to be more aware of where their hands have been before they touch my silverware or glass and more aware of where to touch the dishes.",4JsZcnFjotN9M6UFWqZA3g,1,0,4,AXx9jskaNszWP4qj1-SA6w

The Chef at that place reminds me of the Soup Nazi guy on Seinfeld.  He began to argue out loud where customers could hear with the waitress about our order. She handled it very professionally and told him that she is not there to argue with him.  This does not serve the restaurant well and made us feel that the food he prepares is his way or tough shit.  Today, we went there to give them another chance.  We ordered a Cobb Salad.  The Salad came back with FRIED chicken strips on it and should have been grilled chicken strips.  We thought, here we go again.  The Cobb salad comes back and now there are diced pieces of chicken on it (not strips as before) and much less.  We questioned why the salad did not have hard boiled egg and blue chees crumbles on it as is stated in plain english on the menu that the restaurant hands out to customers to order from.  I showed it to the waitress and she said we were right. At that point, we had been there about 1/2 hour and decided we had to leave to get back to work on time.  The waitress then takes the salad back to the Chef and the Chef says IT IS A COBB SALAD.  I told the waitress that perhaps the Chef SHOULD READ THE MENU that customers order their food from before he prepares meals.  I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and hoped the next time we went there to eat they would get it right.  Well, no such luck, this place sucks due to the Chef's attitude.  I will never go there again because of it.  I recommend that if you go there, read the menu and see if they get your order right and that you receive what you paid for.  They can't seem to for us.  A complete waste of tiime which should otherwise be a nice and enjoyable experience.  Note to Management:  GET ANOTHER CHEF.  Your currfent chef is not doing you any favors. In Fact it is because of him, we will not recommend your restaurant to others.  We will not be back.",Rg-moIx6jMAJ2dG2p4ZzdA,0,0,1,rPHnB3UQv61Jlyat_Ttx6Q

Being close was the only Good thing about Rise & Shine, Valle Verde Location.  I realize flavor is a personal thing, so I shouldn't complain about how things tasted. I had ordered the Two Eggs, over medium, Hash browns, Sausage, and the 'Cup of Bread'. The two eggs were perfect. The Hash Browns were more than the normal hash browns. They had ""spruced"" them up with spices and the texture felt like they were ""Freeze Dried-'just add water' and heat"". There wasn't any ""skillet type""  items on the menu so I created my own. I also asked for a side of Gravy, noticing they had 'Biscuits & Gravy' was on the menu. The 'Banger"" sausage had a good flavor, but it is not a breakfast sausage, in my opinion. The Gravy was flavorless, except for the black pepper. The 'Cup of Bread"" was too doughy and the ""dipping sauce"" wasn't very tasty.  I usually eat less than half of my meal, taking leftovers home for a future meal or snack. So, I realize that the waitress may have thought I wasn't quite done, but it took her a very long time to see if I was done, and if there'd be anything else.  She  dropped off the bill and said ""I can take that up for you, but take your time"". Placing my credit card on the bill, I feel, indicates I'm ready to pay. I waited at least 15 more minutes, with different wait staff passing me by  numerous times. I was NEVER asked if I needed a ""BOX to GO"" and if there may be something I didn't like about the meal, due to the amount I hadn't finished. Like I said previously, taste is a personal thing,and I wasn't going to take this breakfast home for later. So, I just got up and went to the front reception desk, and paid my bill. One good thing I noticed was that the Wait Staff was dressed in Pajamas. I thought that was very clever.

The orange sucked because it was diluted with water to save money. It tasted just like water and the color was not even orange it looked yellow. From the moment I saw it when the server brought it to us I knew something was up. I wasn't the only person who notice that it was others too. Then what I ordered to eat was chilaquillas, I was expecting the traditional way but I was wrong, the server explained to me what it was and she explained what I thought it was going to be the traditional way.

I can't give it 5 stars because of the price.  A limited menu is okay for me.  It's impossible to make 200 things very well, so focusing on making 20-30 things increases the quality.

It's conducive to large groups as well as like myself a party of 1. They have bar seating if your a party of 1 or 2 and dont want wait for a both or table. The waitress staff works really hard and fast to make sure your experience is a good one. Ask to be seated in vanessa's area. She is, fun, attentive and empathetic to your dining experience.  She gives you options along with your order that might not be on the menu or something you just didnt think of.  I ordered the ultimate steak breakfast.  It came with an 8 oz. Steak, 2 or 3 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of bread. One of the bread options is called a pot of bread.  The title is deceiving because it comes in a little cup. But if you like a warm ooey gooey cinnamon roll, then you'll love this. I like to judge a breakfast establishment also by their hash browns.  this place to me has great fresh hash browns.  The steak was medium and was tasty. Not too much pink and still pleasantly juicy. You will not be disappointed.

We decided to try the Rise and Shine place that was near my friends house that lives in LV. Wait time was only 10 mins or less for us and our waitress was very helpful (which everyone seems like there). My girlfriend got the corned beef and hash (around $10), and she loved it because of its authenticity of real corned beef. I got the steak and eggs ($12) because I figured that is what they're known for. I got the medium rare steak and it was so juicy that I did not need steak sauce, only tobasco. Great portions for its price. Only downfall is that there are other steak and eggs spots in LV that are only $3.99.

The server brought it out any way and piled all the fixens on top in hopes I wouldn't notice. I sent it back and ordered the grilled chicken sand which instead. There was a salty sliver of chicken smothered in cheese and once again all the fixens were piled on top. The French fries weren't fries as we know them they were smothered in salt basil and lime. Yuck! It took over a half hour for my new meal to get to the table and it wasn't even busy! The owner had sat exactly two other tables since we had arrived. When the server came over to tell me my order was on it's way a half hour later I just asked for a box. She seemed shocked. I made them take my order off the total of the bill. The other people with me seemed to like their food but they all had breakfast items. All in all I will not suggest this place to anyone nor will I ever go back! Oh and I would have felt guilty feeding this to my dogs (as it would probably kill them being so salty) so I put it in the trash where belongs.

708648,2016-04-14,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"My wife and I are creatures of comfort.  Our breakfast options usually consist of either Egg Works, Babystacks, or burritos at Roberto's.  We were out and about last weekend and had a hankering for some waffles.  Straight-forward enough, but surprisingly hard to find.  This place pops up on Yelp so we give it a go.

Daaaang.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was on the ball, making sure our coffee was topped off and that we had anything we could possibly want.  The Lavazza coffee was ok, though not as mind-blowing as I would have thought from hearing people talk about it.  It's no Douwe Egberts, that's for sure.  My wife got the Nutella latte, which was ludicrously delicious.

The waffle and cinnamon french toast were fantastic.  Do not miss out on the pot of bread with a side of some outrageously addicting sugary dipping substance that should probably be outlawed.

I sure wish this place wasn't so far from where we are in Henderson.  It's a heck of a trek.  Also, be aware that this location does not feature all of the items pictured on the menu.  I would have loved to have tried the Oreo Butterscotch Pancakes, but that will require a trip to the other location.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,0,0,5,OfjHb_Qw_F4gdb5w8E0KHQ

We both ordered the steak & eggs, cooked medium... and both of ours came out looking burnt. And not surprisingly, both steaks were very well done. We're usually not ones to complain, but when our server came by to ask how the food was... well, we brought it up and she offered to have the kitchen cook up another steak. So okay, cool.  Sadly the next steak she brought out was even more well done than the original. How that was even possible, who knows. She offered another time to have another steak cooked up medium. 

How it was possible who knows, but each steak brought out was progressively cooked more and more well done.  There was absolutely no hint of pink in the middle or the sides or anywhere for that matter. The server was getting exasperated herself and kept apologizing profusely, and we didn't blame her at all. It wasn't her fault. But even after all that, the most they could do was take 15% off our bill.  That was a little disappointing. They failed to deliver an edible steak, and it felt like the fair thing would be to take one of the steak&egg orders off the bill. Especially when it was their kitchen staff's fault for messing up so badly, four different times. We didn't think it was a fair gesture, but we weren't going to make a big fuss over it. We're simply not ever going to return to this location.

We yelped breakfast places and saw that Rise and Shine had gotten some harsh reviews about service, but the bf had been there before and said he didn't remember poor service being an issue. 

We decided to chance it. When we arrived, the hostess (the girl with nose ring) didn't welcome or acknowledge us. We waited and she finally just asked ""how many?"" and then didn't say anything like 'alright just have a seat' or 'it'll be just a minute please' which was awkward. 

Great, I thought. My boyfriend even commented about how awkward it was.

But I have to say that was the last of the disappointment because we were seated in about 5 minutes and our server (girl with glasses) was amazing! 

She was upbeat and kind and always there to keep our waters and coffees full (they serve Illy coffee which is THE BEST). And she was very attentive without smothering us. 

I got the cinnamon toast crunch french toast. It was actually a little burned. But it was still yummy. I ordered it as a platter so it came with sausage and eggs. 

Boyfriend ordered corned beef hash and liked it. It came with a pot of bread which really is like a little roll. It's cute but my guy was like ""uhh do I just pull this out and eat it?"" It's nothing too special. It has a cinnamon swirl in the middle which he shared with this birthday girl ;) 

We saw the owner, who has been mentioned in previous reviews, running around the restaurant seemingly doing stuff, at least very active, wearing slacks and a dress shirt. 

In summary:
If the french toast wasn't a little burned it would've been AMAAAZING. Although it was still enjoyable. 

Maybe the owner should have a talk w the hostess about how she's the first impression anyone who comes in gets of the establishment. 

Order their coffee because Illy is the best!!

Overall, my boyfriend and I felt that it was evident that they read the yelp reviews and make adjustments accordingly. We thought this was great.",jxiWra-M9WnXf92xzWlfZw,0,0,4,dQLrLTI0lAo_FSSSZKUd_g

This place has an awesome menu - I had a hard time deciding, so I went for eggs eggs Benedict because it's my fave. Doug and the baby had pancakes and Doug had bacon on the side. He also ordered watermelon strawberry juice, which he didn't like. I took a sip and can see why - it's an all natural juice with no added sugar. Not really a kids beverage; I, on the other hand, loved it.

They brought out warm syrup!!! That wowed me. But the pancakes didn't need it. They were fluffy and light and had their own sweetness to them that made them delicious plain. The eggs Benedict had an unexpected but interesting balsamic reduction drizzled on top that made me an instant fan. I didn't get to try Doug's bacon because he devoured all 5 pieces before I got a chance but it looked great. Sightly thick and cooked perfectly.

The kitchen is open air , so with the radio blasting, cooks singing along to the music, and the constant shuffle of the plates and silverware it's a bit noisy.  Distracting from the nice quiet breakfast we were expecting.

 I ordered the Steak/Spinach Benedict and she ordered the Ham and egg Benedict  My plate has a good sized portion, but once I cut into the steak I find its mostly gristle and fat. The hash-browns were good.

There are important factors other than food that make a cafe a good one, in my opinion. 

We tried their Summerlin location but that one has even worse customer service. It must be a chain thing.

The food was very delicious and the portions were decent. The ribeye had a very delicious spice rub that made the steak hardly require any steak sauce and it was very tender., Our drinks were also filled very promptly without even asking.""A Pet Peeve of mine"" I'm only knocking a star because the ribeye steak was a little on the thin side and i asked for Medium and it came out Medium Well. Also i asked for Over Medium eggs and they came out Over Easy. But Overall the food was Fantastic and we left full. $34 not including tip.

The menu look fantastic and my wife ordered the croissant French toast with blue berries and I had the chicken fried steak. The French toast was nothing like advertised and actually should of been called bread pudding since the consistency was equivalent. The mound of fresh blueberries on top was a nice touch. The wife was not to thrilled about the dish probably because mentally she was prepared for something else, I thought it was just okay. My country fried steak was disappointing , extremely chewy with bits of tendons everywhere, the gravy was good and the hash browns was the best part of the dish.

Had a wonderful breakfast here the other day.

In addition to great food, what made it really fantastic was our server, Cary.

Cary made us feel like we were her special guests and certainly her favorite table. Every visit  - whether to take an order, serve a dish, or just to refill coffee, came with a friendly smile, a quick chat, and a laugh. The place was super busy on a Sunday morning, but we felt really taken care of.  We couldn't help but notice that she seemed to be treating her other tables equally well. 

My date is a bartender at a high-end restaurant in town, and his comment was ""She's a serious pro!"". 

This kind of service and attitude - and not just by Cary, but by everyone on the staff that we met - makes it worthy of a five-star review - makes it worth the slightly higher than average prices - and assures that we will be regulars here.

There is no lack of restaurants in the area, so we've been doing our best to try new places we've never been before. Sadly, we have tried a few breakfast spots and none have wowed us. Until now. We finally found a decent place with good food. Rise & Shine is a bit far away in Southern Highlands, but at least it's easy traveling time, not near the strip. It's in a outdoor mini mall area with an Ace Hardware store and a supermarket. We had to go to Ace early Sunday, and decided to try the place. It was decent size and cute decor, and the servers wear their pajamas, which took a second to register at first, but cute idea. Big menu, with lots to choose from. My husband had the daily special chicken fried steak and gravy, and loved it. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and was blown away at how good it was. Even better, in my opinion, than Roscoe's in California, but I'm sure some will disagree.

The chicken breast was flattened and fried, but the flavor was rich and deep, and the batter was so crispy and flavorful. I asked, and the server said it was just salt, pepper, and flour, but it must have been dipped in buttermilk, because it really was exceptional. The waffle was light and fluffy, and their logo was stamped in the middle. The piece of chicken was huge, which was good because I took half home and ate it for breakfast the next day.

They have something called a pot of bread, which is a hybrid of a cinnamon roll stuff in a cup. We didn't try it, but will next time.

We were there at 7 am when it opened, so the crowd wasn't big, but they obviously had regular customers with whom they were really friendly.  Only downfall is that it's a bit cher...Our two meals with coffee and a hot chocolate came to about $40.

This spot is tucked away in a residential neighborhood and if it wasn't for Yelp, I would have missed this breakfast gem.  By the looks of it, it's a locals favorite and a great family restaurant. 

While I waited 20 minutes I reviewed the menu via this wonderful app. The consistent review was the Chilaquiles (Chi-la-key-less) for those non latin tongues. Equally for those who know what traditional Chilaquiles should taste like, these are not it. Although don't discount this dish out. This version is more of a Tex-Mex spin but it's worthy of my taste buds.

Before I started the meal I ordered a good ol' cup of Joe served generously in a large mug fit for the most caffeine frenzied freak. Trust me avoid all offers of carb delights and only order the pot of bread.  This simple but yet inventive cinnamon roll served in a juxtaposed mug of coffee is a must have. Paired with a cup of coffee it reminds you why you woke up this morning... to enjoy life with a slice of sunshine.  Just with this simple start, this establishment lives up to its glorious name. 

Onto the main dish, spiced rubbed ribeye steak chilaquiles. I thought it was served with strips of steak. Oh no my friend, you get a grade cut of steak worthy of any red blooded carnivore. The Chilaquiles are more chips that true tortillas, again more of a Tex-Mex flair. They are layered with refried beans at the base, then layers of cheddar cheese, chips, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo and avocado. With a sprinkle of cotija cheese on it and you are in breakfast heaven. 

The steak was phenomenal and I would gladly have a steak here over Gordon Ramsey's ""Steak"" located in Paris Hotel.  The steak is a fraction of the cost but more importantly it's better tasting. Granted it's not American Kobe beef but it doesn't have to be. The rib eye was seasoned to perfection. 

This is not a light hearted breakfast and if you are like me, you won't have a need to have lunch.  The high ratings is not all hype and is definitely worth checking out. This joint has a cool and laid back atmosphere great for the family.

Then my sister orders salsa for her steak and eggs, and it's put on my plate of pancakes. Good combo. Also, my pancakes came with a special syrup, and it was delivered 10 minutes after my pancakes were. Oh, and that ""fresh"" butter my friend ordered? Came when she was halfway done with her meal. Okay so our server was very unfriendly and acting odd but once the bill came, she asked us how we were for the first time, asked if we were visiting, etc. I get it, you want a nice tip lol.

I thought she had a bit of an attitude when we order water for our beverages because she walked away without saying anything to us, like she was ignoring us & not acknowledging us. But no, that's just how she was. She dropped off my fiancées bagel, I said thank you and she ignored me. Same when she dropped our food off, the check- everything. She charged us an extra $1 on our check, which we usually wouldn't complain about but we didn't have a good experience with her. So we told the host who was ringing us up and I think the manager had her apologize but she only apologized for the extra dollar charged- not her shitty service. When we told the host how she treated us she gave us a friends and family discount- which we weren't looking for a discount but it was a nice gesture.

1330196,2014-04-14,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,Surprised the hubby to a Vegas trip for his birthday and of course he wanted to find a steak and egg spot. Naturally we would've gone somewhere on the strip but being the yelpers we are we found this spot and content with the results. I'm such a foodie but since I'm also trying to watch my portions I was hesitant on what I would order. I ended up ordering the steak omelette (egg whites only) which came with the sauce and hash browns. Went with the bread in pot as my side bread option which was PERFECT for me since I'm watching my food portions. I enjoyed every bite of the perfectly cooked steak and the omelette was fluffy. I will say that they put a little too much cheese in it but overall great flavor. I was full and didn't even touch the hash browns but my hubby said they were yummy. He ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin which he said was just perfect. This will be a must breakfast spot next time were in Vegas.,q2aTHxbqoPoIPo1hdWr2Hw,0,0,5,2OJexznkvgt_tGVtvpCheg

There is no denying that the food is great... but I am back to concerned about the service. My waitress who I have had several times was awesome. But the bar was empty,  several empty tables and I was told a 10 to 15 minute wait. It took the hostess a very long time to seat the empty tables and my wait was closer to 25 mins... bar was still empty when she took me there. I was served quickly. However the plate looked like a train wreck. No grapes as I have come to expect here, they obviously haven't scrubbed the grill between orders as there was much grainy char on the plate. The servers seem to use the bar area to drop stuff on (menus, unwanted table items etc) and the buckets that have silverware and napkins at the back of the bar had a layer of dust on the back edge. Seems like a loss of revenue to not have the bar full of payomg customers instead of empty and full of mislaid items. My suggestion... either a) assign a waitress to the bar that can handle it and a table or two or b) maybe get a bus boy or hostess who is maybe interested in becoming a server to take just the bar. You lost 4 tables of 2 to 3 people while I waited and probably more as I ate. Again food is really tasty but the inconsistencies will lose customers.

Also asked to cut burrito in half and they said they couldn't do it since it would fall apart. Not true, for what I had asked for I know for a fact  it would not! A $14.50 burrito, bacon, hash browns,eggs and cheese. Had maybe 2 small stripes of bacon, very very small amount of hash browns. Tasted more like an egg burrito.

Everyone from the manager to our waitress, April were unbelievably pleasant.

The menu though basic in it's appearance contains some very interesting items.  Some of which we were able to sample today and look forward to sampling some others in the future.

The meals consisted of a Steak Benedict served on your choice of a plain or everything bagel.  Another plate of goodness was the French Toast coated with Cinnamon Crunch.  It normally comes on a raisin bread but we opted for Crunch coated Texas Toast...Awesome!

My only negative remark was that the poached egg on the Benedict was was not runny.  I addressed this with both the Manager and the Waitress who apologized and offered to make it right.  I chose not to make a big deal out of it and continued eating.  The steak by the way was Awesome!

The food is bad. I ordered their ultimate steak and eggs. This place is named for their steak and eggs, so I was expecting to have a stellar breakfast before my drive back to LA. What I got were disgusting eggs, a very low quality cut of meat, and hash browns that looked and tasted like badly cooked shredded potatoes with a bunch of oil splattered on them.
I brought it to the attention of the waitress, who in turn brought it up to the manager. The manager spoke with me, insisting that they only buy the best type of meat. I knew better, as I've had steak and eggs in many different places throughout LA and SD. The only thing that tasted right was the toast, but it's pretty hard to screw that one up.

The positive aspects:

The customer service was on point. I was seated immediately, and the staff was very nice. And by nice, I mean they greeted me very warmly, and even expressed sympathy that I was not happy with the meal. I've seriously never been greeted this warmly by any restaurant staff member, so props to them.

As for our main meal, it definitely did not disappoint. I loved my omelette along with the strips of steaks on top; it was just a great combination overall! The only thing I would suggest is for them to go easy on the pepper.

I don't mind waiting but at least touch the table so it is not awkward when you finally do stroll up and act like we were just sat and hadn't been waiting for an extreme amount of time. 

Now for the food part....each time I have tried something different. This time the steak was over done and the bermais (sp) sauce was sour. The woman next to me ordered the same thing and got salsa with her steak omelet and I am not saying it is the waitresses fault but I would've enjoyed it with mine but its my fault for not paying attention. My husband's chicken fried steak was burnt. Everything else like i said previously was just mediocre. 

All in all good place. Just inconsistent.",9xbuVEeW5Dx2JDzqi6zKdw,0,0,3,u90WgcpMMNEglMRjD1YEGw

Steak and eggs seems to be their signature dish and it is excellent.  The steak is as well done as the eggs and the hash potatoes are like nothing else you have ever had.
Even their bread choices are a step above the average breakfast place.  You can get a special bread they make in house that is soft, gooey and filled with cinnamon goodness.

There is something about places that beg me to leave a good review on Yelp!. Bus boys wear t-shirts that say ""Help us...Yelp! us."" A sign hangs in the window advertising that people like them on Yelp!. Then,  at the end of your meal,  a 20 question survey is handed to you with another Help Us,  Yelp! us advertisement.  I don't need your constant reminders to leave a good review, just quality service and great food. Also,  if you want me to leave a review,  provide me with free wifi since your network shows up as the strongest of the many networks in the area (3 of which are free).

That said,  we received quality service and great food.  My fiancé and I shared their Country fried steak and eggs,  hashbrowns, biscuit,  and a side of corn beef hash. The steak was prepared in a great batter;  very crispy,  not hard,  thick,  but not overwhelming.  Gravy was served on the side and was very tasty.  Hash Browns are more like a mix between hash browns and home fries... home fried hash browns, maybe? The fluffy and crispy biscuit came out late,  but it was topped with sausage gravy at no charge... nice! Also,  the corned beef hash was a very good addition to this meal. We left very full and ready for a nap,  to bad we have a 4.5 hour drive ahead of us. 

The food was matched with great service from the time we signed in to paying the bill.  Good job,  now lose the Help Us, Yelp!

The restaurant was clean and playfully decorated. At first glance the menu is a little overwhelming but with excellent instruction from a pajama wearing waitress I was able to find what I wanted. This place has a little bit of everything including it's very own juice bar. 

The homemade corn beef hash was fresh and very tasty. It was served with cubed hash and three well prepared over easy eggs.

The pancakes were thick and huge.  I couldn't finish but about half of my plate.  They had a light dusting of powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top.  My husband happily ate the cream for me.  I realize it is a steak & egg place but their pancakes are just as good.

We proceeded to wait 45 minutes to an hour and nobody was ever seated in the barstools. There was an empty table for 15 minutes and we still had to wait to be seated (we needed up sitting there. Why we couldn't be seated earlier? I have no idea). All of the hostesses were rude and looked like they hated their job. The only saving grace was our extremely sweet waitress and the food, minus my husband's French fries which tasted very old.

I'm sitting here drafting this review as I watch my son finishing our breakfast. It makes me a bit sad that this place is so far from my home. I drove here from Henderson, its located on Southern Highlands Pkwy & Cactus. If it was close, I'd be the Duchess...fast! And weigh much more, probably...

I was a waitress back in the day at locally owned restaurants like Rise & Shine, and as I giggle watching these ladies serve food dressed in flannel pajamas, all I wondered was ""Why didn't I work at a place where pjs were the uniform?!?!"" How much more comfortable can you make it, right?! So you can imagine, it definitely has a warm feeling. The smell of French toast and coffee and cinnamon gets your nose up as you walk in the door. 

The menu - you can order your standards. Omelets, pancakes, bacon & eggs. Then you see Crunch Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and Spiced Rubbed Rib Eye Chilaquiles, Fried Chicken and Waffles, and homemade Corned Beef Hash. 

What else? Most egg plates come with your choice of toast, biscuit, or the ever popular pot of bread. Very adorable little round loaf of slightly cinnamon gooey deliciousness seem to be on many tables during my visits. 

The drinks - freshly squeezed orange juice is always a favorite of mine I share with my son. But I had to try their French press coffee after reading about it. A generous serving is brought to your table, accompanied by a sand hourglass, with three separate colored sands. You decide which sand to follow to determine how strong you want your coffee. Love it!! (see photo if you can't picture what I'm saying)

I haven't dined here for lunch, but I slightly glanced at it while drooling over the breakfast choices. If you're not in the mood for breakfast, like their current special, Baked Blueberry Pecan French Toast Casserole or my personal favorite, Make-Your-Own Yogurt Parfait, you can choose from burgers, salads, panini sandwiches, and daily specials like meatloaf, fish & chips, and chicken broccoli pot pie, served until they run out. They also offer a few kid's plates, however, if you have a toddler like me, the generous portions they serve is more than enough to share! Prices are decent, the service I've received have been warm, inviting, and prompt. 

I think if the next few visits are as awesome as my previous ones, they definitely warrant a 5-star review. For now, it is far to drive to, and I do wish they offered lighter healthier options, too. Do I end up ordering them? Not much. But I like having the choice when I'm feeling weight-conscious on those rare occasions.

Once there we were seated in the nearest booth to the door because I walk on a cane from a broken ankle I sustained in December, no fun!    but that was very nice of the waitress to do for me.

The restaurant was clean and surprisingly empty-very few people were there and i had heard to come early and be prepared to stand in line so that made me wonder....

I had to try an item off the menu from a section chosen by The Die.   ~The Classics done better~ was chosen for me and then my Ex Don got to choose an item for me to try from that section (want to go Dicing with us yet?    we need a 3rd  :D )    Chilaquiles was chosen for me (that may be the incorrect spelling though)   It was basically fried Tortilla chips covered with Refried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, avocado and topped with 2 eggs.   YUM!!    

I chose the section for my partner and I chose beverages and then I was to choose his item and chose a Mocha Iced Coffee.   He did not like it, he said it was watery and weak, I decided to order the Vanilla Mocha and had the same results and we love Iced coffee, Ihop seems to make the best from what we have had so far and this is the ONLY reason I have to give this place a 4 instead of a 5 star review.

The service was excellent and because I told the waitress that we were new, she brought me a Pot O Bread for Free, its a cinnamon roll in a cup served with a kind of sweet and not sweet dipping sauce-It was excellent.

My friends and I had arrived into Las Vegas, and I just just arrived from New York, while my friends were recovering from a long night, and we were clueless as to where to go for some good lunch/breakfast.  We yelped on our phones, and when we came across chicken and waffles, we thought well, could they possibly be better than Roscoes?  Well, let me tell you...

The Staff & Service

Impeccable, supremely dedicated to customers, and so friendly, I thought I was in another planet!  Seriously, everyone's smiling, and so welcoming.  Customer service is super important to me because I work in this field, and when I don't receive supreme customer service, I ain't happy!! We didn't know what to order, so we asked the nice waitress, and with her recommendations, my friends and I ordered our dishes.  She gave us enough time to order, and she was spot on with her recommendations.  To summarize this area, the word to be used is: perfect!

Rating:  5 out of 5

The Food

My friend and I ordered the original Chicken & Waffles.  Let me tell you...it's far better than Roscoe's.  The fried chicken wasn't dry--just perfect and crispy.  The waffle was delicious--no flaws for sure.  The portions were just about right--I was super hungry so I ate it all.

My other friend ordered the Rib-Eyed Chilaquiles.  The steak was juicy, and the chips that were layered beneath the steak was to die for. 

The ""pot of bread"" was a first for me.  It was delicious--not too sweet like cinnamon buns, but just perfect.   

Rating:  5 out of 5


Overall

I will most definitely be returning to this restaurant from now on, every time I visit Las Vegas.  This would be place for me to get a hearty breakfast without a doubt.

I've been wanting to try this place out for like six years and FINALLY just got to try it today. I wish I tried it sooner ! There was no wait when we came in this morning too.

They have an extensive menu and everything sounded so good for breakfast but I finally settled with their crunchy cinnamon french toast. They have the BEST french toast in town ! And I'm not just saying that because I came in starving lol. I really enjoyed their variation of french toast. It wasn't too sweet either. It's a must try. I also ordered my french toast w/ egg whites and turkey sausage and my friend shared some of his hash browns. Loved every single part of my meal. One of their other highlights is their pot of bread. Presentation is cute , it comes in a small mug. It's like a cinnamon roll and you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is). It's also served w/ butter on the side but it's that good on it's own so it doesn't need it. 

Love the theme they got going on too - they have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling and all the servers wore PJs. I would love to come back here again if it wasn't so far from my house. If they could open another location in Henderson that would be perfect :)",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,5,2,5,p_J-BS5fPfnzj1s1xZVamw

This is an above average breakfast spot. I highly recommend trying their fresh-squeezed OJ and an omelette or the banana pancakes (although the pancake batter is noticeably sweeter than other breakfast spots). 

My only complaint is the coffee! The regular coffee is weak, and the french press is barely drinkable. I always order OJ and then go to Starbucks after (located in the same plaza) for my coffee fix.

Your best breakfast options are not located in the heart of Las Vegas (the strip, spring valley, etc). Rise & Shine is located on the far Southside off the 15 freeway of Silverado Ranch Blvd.

At this joint, they offer some serious quality breakfast in exceptional presentation. I have already visited this place twice in less than a week. All for good reason.

On my first visit, I tried the Ultimate steak & eggs breakfast which consisted of a massive and juicy 8oz rib eye steak. Along with my meat was hash browns and 3 egg whites. It's about $14+ but you get what you pay for. This is one massive meal and a quality that you can't find at South Point or wherever the hell you go for your midnight steak & eggs.

On my second visit, I tried the Ham & Eggs Benedict on a English bagel. Though I'm not much of a Ham & Eggs Benedict type of person, it was tasty as well! Served with your standard hash browns.

Already came here twice and looking forward to a 3rd time to see how the corned beef hash is. Apparently, it's made fresh from scratch so can't wait to give that a try.

Service was great as well! Servers were all attentive and courteous. They even wear pajamas to resemble an early-day atmosphere.",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,1,0,5,8r8BikGr2RPTJmbAvL3DpQ

I received a personal message from the new general manager, Davilan, who was very apologetic for the shortcoming of the restaurant.  He has assured me that that level of service throughout our visit was not acceptable and not at the level expected of staff  and has been addressed accordingly.

My wife and I only expect to be treated as all the other guests, nothing more, nothing less.

We each ordered the short stack of pancakes platter with the choice of bacon, banger sausages (what we both got), or turkey kielbasa and two eggs. 

We decided to get a side of tomatoes to get some veggies, as well as a pot of bread to try. I also ordered a cup of coffee (they brew ILLY coffee - THE BEST!).

I had no idea what a pot of bread was, so this was the best way I could describe it: It's like a cinnamon bun, without being sweet, and served with preserves. I thought it was delicious and appreciated that it wasn't terribly sweet. Also, it comes in a little flower pot. SO adorable. 

Also, our waitress was kinda amazing. One of the nicest servers I'd ever seen in Vegas. She kinda reminded me of Shania Twain (random I know). She seriously kicked ass, and did a great job of taking care of us. 

Just a couple of minor things I would have Rise And Shine work on:
-My banger sausages (DELISH) were warm but not hot
-The prices here are a little more expensive 

A few things on my list to try next time:
-2 cup French Press Illy coffee
-Steak and Eggs -- this is their signature dish
-Hash Browns - seems like everyone had this and I had major food envy",Lo0GIJ5H9p3vwUTIcraNwA,0,2,4,-0p4Yey5Gf7C_t8Bsb8qeQ

2100791,2013-09-02,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas so far. I have been going here for over two years. Previously was close to my place (it's just off cactus and Decatur/southern highlands parkway) but now I happily drive there. 

The wait can be long sometimes and no reservations. So go early! It is a small place. But worth a wait (never too long anyways) if you are a late-comer. 

The menu is great. Lots of options but especially great because all the food is amazing! My personal favorite is the New York steak spinach and Benedict bagel. I opt for the everything bagel. The hollandaise sauce with the balsamic flavor on top of perfectly poached eggs and fresh spinach and a steak is nothing to complain about. Their hash browns are delicious too. Shaved yet thick... And have a buttery crispness to them. Love!

They also make these little cinnamon breads in clay pots ""pot o bread"" that is wonderful. Now... This used to be more wonderful when they made homemade jam with chunks of strawberries... But it's still delicious with butter or the packaged jam. OR I have been known to get a small side of the cheesecake icing or something they have so it is cinnamon bun like :) (recommended a while back by a waitress there)

The next best thing here is their coffee. IF you're a coffee fan they have an option of French press or regular brew. I always go for the regular brew which is ILLY coffee. This is one of my fave roasts :) so I usually take a cup to go since it's hard to find in the city. 

You can tell the staff enjoy working there. I always see the same servers. Great atmosphere and great food means happy customers and happy staff :)

The next best thing would be... That mostly anything that can be split in half you can order a half order. The price is somewhat changed (half or so) and is nice because the portions can be way too big! Or in case you're split between two dishes... It isn't written on the menu BUT they are so accommodating. You'll see!!

Try it! You won't be disappointed. And IF by chance you are --- let them know and in a jiffy they will correct it... That you'll forget anything wasn't perfect and still leave there smiling!! 

My only downside would be the price.  Somehow I would like to see somewhat smaller portions and a slightly lower price. That is what makes me not go there as often. I feel breakfast should be max 10 per person. Not 15... But that would be my only complaint..

YUM! Salivating writing this... Can't wait to go back!",U6Bi44pwgiIt-IEK2GhiGQ,0,1,5,nbhnpgQO2GOYNlc57qaoVw

This was my first time back here in years, and my rating sadly has tanked. 
Came in on a Monday morning and the place was pretty empty (to be expected for a weekday). 
We sat at the counter. 
I had some questions to make a veg or vegan breakfast, and the waitress was not helpful in the least. Okay, I get it, the name may say it all..but you can be helpful ...right??? Wrong. 
I asked about the breakfast potatoes being cooked in oil or butter and she said it was butter... imitation butter. Wow, a place that charges $10-$15 per plate and you're serving fake butter? Regardless I wanted my potatoes cooked in oil. It was a no go. So I ordered a juice... sucked it down...and will not return.",QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA,0,0,1,VCsGClp8FaNSISZ3p93pGw

Whimsical decor and fun waitstaff. We ordered the pot of bread as recommended and were not disappointed. Just the right serving size in its little teacup. 

Someone else suggested the corned beef hash and eggs. Not my go to breakfast but I haven't had it in a long time so I gave it a try. So so good.

2138624,2011-04-27,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"Being a huge fan of breakfast food, I wish that I could say I loved this place and that I'm excited to go back, especially since it's locally owned. But, unfortunately that isn't the case. 

he service was great. We were greeted right away and seated. Soon after someone took our drink orders [they serve illy coffee!]. Soon after, our waitress came up to see if we had any questions. 

I'm on a mission to find the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas, so it was an easy choice when I saw it on their menu. I'll admit, once the food came out and I saw my order, I wanted to drool a little bit. It was a nice big portion of the chicken, scrambled eggs, gravy, & hash browns. 

The eggs were cooked well enough, but lacked any taste whatsoever. A little salt would've gone a long way. The hash browns seemed a little undercooked. Potato was still kind of starchy, and they were missing that nice golden brown color on top. The gravy was actually quite good, and was probably the highlight of the dish. Moving on to the main item, the steak. I liked the fact that it was a thick steak with a thin batter on it. Unlike the eggs, it did not lack in flavor whatsoever. Unfortunately, the ONLY flavor it had was of black pepper. Apparently what they lacked in salt in the eggs, they made up for with an excessive amount of black pepper on the coating of the steak and on the steak. 

One of my fellow diners ordered the chicken & waffles. His chicken had the same exact problem as my steak. All we could taste was the black pepper. It's unfortunate really, because both the chicken and steak were tender and cooked well. 

The pot of bread that came with my order was sub-par. Like the eggs, it lacked taste. I don't usually like to but butter on my rolls, but this bread definitely needed it to get some flavor. 

So, all in all - great service but lacked a bit in the food department. The food was cooked well, but needed better execution in my opinion. Hopefully, I just went on an off day. Maybe next time, if I so happen to be on that side of town during breakfast hours I might give it another chance. But it's definitely not worth another 20 minute drive for the sole purpose of eating there.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,3,1,3,vafAnGTQcZl2_L9SnZRd6g

It's very obvious that the few orders of cup of bread we received were reheated in the microwave. They were super dry and after about a minute or two they were hard as rocks and completely inedible. Wouldn't be such a big deal but at $3 a pop I expect something edible. Very disappointing. Everything else was fine. It's just aggravating when restaurants make poor choices in hopes to save a few cents, cuz in the end they're losing a lot more by inspiring us to find a different breakfast spot.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,1,1,2,TNftUXmLblMh6DQZOPJcbA
2154926,2011-09-26,2,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"Some of our friends said this place was really good so we decided to give it a go; it also had good Yelp reviews and, being the Yelper I am, I try and put faith in my fellow Yelpians (is that what we're called?  I dunno).

Unfortunately, it was a little less than what I was hoping for.

We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was maybe half-full and it looked like most people were eating or had already finished, enjoying cups of coffee and talking amongst their parties.  We expected pretty quick, efficient service due to this, and did not receive it.  Everything was slow: ordering, getting things to our table, the check - it was really disappointing since it was obvious we missed the ""big rush.""

The hash browns were definitely nothing to write home about and tasted starchy - I tried some of my fiancé's.  And their coffee was like watery mud oil.  I ordered a signature dish because I really like to try those from places.  So, I got the blueberry and cream cheese stuffed french toast (I believe this was the name).  It came out and was HUGE!  They definitely don't skimp on portions, hence the extra star.  When I tried it, though, it was way too processed sugary.  I picked at the blueberries and the french toast for awhile but got full super fast and ended up sharing it with the rest of the table.  French toast doesn't really make good leftovers.  Pretty sure I should have gotten a heart attack from that, but the overall taste WAS decent.  Another downer was they didn't have low-fat cream cheese as an alternative, which is probably why I felt so full so fast as well.

Overall, definitely not impressed.  Perhaps everyone else just got lucky and had better food / service than I did.  Considering the above plus the prices, I'd rather just go to IHOP.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,3,1,2,V0yjGgl58mlnENln6MyVLA

I ordered the steak and eggs medium rare with the bread in a cup. The bread in a cup was the best part for me. It was sweet and the bread soft.  Unfortunately my steak left much to desire. The steak was well done instead of medium rare. I told the waitress and they fixed it immediately. The meal for me was nothing special. My friends on the other hand enjoyed their food very much. They ordered the chicken steak and Hash. I also ordered their Kale and apple drink it was really good! I just chopped it up that I picked the wrong thing on the menu. Also their cutlery and cups were dirty. The good out weighed the bad so I will probably try it again.,Ac2oeT_2_xFn117_UszdcQ,0,1,3,b0Oy9-ciuV1Gaf5EnBocMg

Both times the food has been good (the French press coffee is very nice), it's very cute inside and I love that the staff is wearing pajamas. It's the service that has been the disappointment. This last time we got in right after they opened and had zero wait getting seated. But then we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our food (a long time with a hungry 2 year old) our server didn't even make eye contact when she was talking or supposed to be listening, we had to consistently ask for refills, toast that was supposed to come with breakfast, creamer etc. and the bathroom was in a pretty dismal state.
Also no biggie but would be nice if they would add non fat milk to the menu. 

Lastly, we went on Mother's Day and they handed out roses to every mother but me! I didn't want to ask, ""hey, can I have a flower too??"" I had the damn baby and I want my rose! ;) I'm pretty sure our waitress just wasn't paying any attention but I felt like the black sheep, ha.

This place is right by my house in Vegas (Southern Highlands). The first time I tried them, I had to send my coffee back because it had LIPSTICK ON THE COFFEE CUP.

Decided to give them another chance since they are so close. The second time.......THE EXACT SAME THING. Coffee cup with dirty coffee ring on the inside, AGAIN!!!!? We IMMEDIATELY got up and walked out.

I would stay away from the poached eggs as they are normally undercooked as well. All in all if your meal is prepared right it is a great spot to grab a bite at. The manager doesn't share the wifi password which I find kind of odd, but to each their own.

On a recent visit with my Dad we ended up here back to back days during the trip and our only complaint was that the food was so scrumptious here that it pained us to leave the remains of the unconsumed on the plate. You certainly can share without embarrassment here as the portions (on most items) are enough to feed an army!

Before I get into the main attraction I do want to point out from top to bottom the staff here. Once again they are beyond inviting and the genuine care they portray to each table of patrons is a staple that they are well worth the 5 star rating from not just myself, but the other masses as well who choose to dine within those walls. I really feel so at home there and that is a special gift!

For day #1 I had my heart set on trying something different so I went for the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. Those are a MUST if you have a craving for a ""short"" stack, but there is nothing short about that stack by any means. I was served 4 huge battered circular halos and with literal chunks of chocolate chips how can you go wrong? They were quite fluffy overall and the after taste of chocolate in each bite partnered with the cream cheese syrup it comes partnered with left me feeling like I was sharing a sunrise with Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory!

For day #2 I scaled it back a bit and devoured the pot of bread and the three egg breakfast with bacon on the side. It was simplistic in nature with just eggs, hash browns, and bacon however even in a simple form the food is still on point. The bacon (being the high point) was crispy and had a slight smoky tint to it that elevated it to a whole other level. I actually had a full on body shake because it was so amazing!

With top notch consistent hospitality, this is by far my #1 breakfast destination when I am in the area and it's been fun to watch the growing cult following they are getting as time goes on. To keep it simple, people know what's up!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,0,5,0U_nNwP2jawSgRY4gAlhtA

Overall, we love this place. Saturdays and Sundays are usually their busiest time, and weekdays are a breeze to get in. We live down the street, and so we go here frequently. They recently opened another location in Summerlin, but we haven't been there yet. They used Summerlin as sort of a ""test"" for their new menu, tweaked it there, and then changed their menu at this location. We've had everything there...and I mean that. We used to go there basically every weekend. The french toast and pancakes are to die for, according to the kids. My new ""super bad"" food addiction is their fried chicken breast and waffle. They bring their syrup out in a warmed bottle and you can see the fresh cinnamon inside. Yum. The servers are very kind and they all dress in pajamas, which is a neat vibe. They also have hanging flower/umbrella decorations, and the walls have neat colors and decor. Their portions are huge, so that accounts for the average $15/per plate (that is an estimate on my part), and you have plenty for leftovers.

Granted this place is packed on the weekends and to keep pace with the knashing carnivors waiting anxiously to get in and get there feed on, the staff in nasty pajamas has to be on point with the kitchen.  This seems obvious right?  Well on Sunday there was a line out the door, normal, and the experience started like this:

The hostess, a girl I had not seen before and unfortunately did not get her name, asked us how many and told us that there would be a 15-20 min wait.  So I looked to the Bar which no one was at and asked if we could sit there.  First she eye rolled me and then said I don't know.  I asked if she could check and again the same exasperated eye roll that she might have fallen backwards from, ""Ill check,"" she said.  I waited 5 min while she talked to severs, played with her pen and gave the general I could give a rats hind end about you as a customer look and finally I asked if she even asked any one (of which she didn't because I was watching like a hawk with a caged animal in my stomache ready to leap from its depths and attack on site).  Also, I wasnt the only annoyed one as all the people were talking about how rude that hostess was.  She is definately not the face any owner would want at the FOH.  Lazy, non-caring, and rude.

While sitting waiting for Griselda the Mean to get back to me, I looked around and there were 6-8 four tops sitting with dirty dishes on them which would have acomodated most of the people outside waiting.  Those table stayed dirty for exactly 15 min before they started to be cleared.  This whole team led by there Manager Jessica, who didn't lift a finger to help any one and simply walked around with a face that could sink a1000 ships and then complained about the customers attitudes only a few feet from me.  Maybe its just me but the Manager should be the buisiest person in the restaurant, cleaning making sure that customers are taken care of, smiling, greeting, not hiding in corners and avoiding the crazy crowd that had acumulated outside the door.  Jessica only became interested in us when we asked for a comment card.  Then she couldn't stop walking behind me and my girlfriend looming over to get a peek at what was being written.  So unprofessional.  She was training...if you want to call it that, a server by the name of Cali for management, who was AWESOME.  She was sooooo weeded and still she took the time to come by and make sure that we were ok at least 3 times.  Great job on the floor Cali, hopefully you will be replacing Jessica so very soon!!

Food...well it was satisfactory this time.  My steak came out mooing at me, way rare (I ordered medium), and the hashbrowns were raw and I think if I equated it to a measuring cup I got a bout 1/3 of a cup of hashbrowns and the eggs over easy were dripping with oil, saturating everything on the plate.  The open air kitchen was getting slammed, plates were being thrown on the floor by the line cooks, (Seriously?) the cooks were openly swearing at the servers and calling them horrible names behind the line only 2 feet from me and I was able to hear everything.  Sloppy plating and the list goes on.  My girlfriend said here omlet was good but the pot of bread she ordered was raw about an inch down in the cup.

Sorry Rise and Shine, normally you all are so on point and friendly and look so comfy in your designer flannel pajamas.

the place was busy yet we were seated in served in less than an hour! well worth the short wait. the staff has optional uniforms pajamas or company gear. creating a fun ambient.",Qb1eir8Gr26N5QBjbm_gAw,0,0,4,tHcv8Yvv9RsDB_bFzN3MqA

Hoping a MANAGER OR OWNER MIGHT SEE IT!!! I'll just discuss today's debacle.  It started off great. No wait!! Even got a booth!! Waitress shows up... looking annoyed, disinterested in general. I felt like my entire visit went downhill from here.... 
I asked her for a large OJ... and I get a CARAFE.... is that large? Um. Ok. I asked for for a 1/2 order of French toast... which I got, yet... they were ""less fluffy"" and basically looked like I got the welfare white bread version instead of the Texas toast version. My 12 year old daughter asked for chocolate chip pancakes and eggs/bacon....this is where it gets ""interesting"". She's 12... not 15 or 20... ya think the waitress bothered to ask me 1 question? Or tell me sizes or maybe whether we want the adult or child or just completely ala carte? Nope not a word. (Let's ""pad the check""...huh). So when she brought out my 12 year olds breakfast... you might has well thought she's a LUMBERJACK!!! Because that's what the waitress ordered for her. 4 supercalifragilistic ginormous god damn pancakes. And a small side of some crappy tiny eggs and burnt bacon. I sat there dumbfounded. When she finally came back around, I had already finished my ""French toast"" and asked her what this was... POINTING to my daughters meal. I asked her why she didn't tell us it was for a lumberjack. Why didn't she steer us to something more HER SIZE?? Basically she was speechless... then with an attitude she said ""I can take off 2 pancakes""... but the look on her face was right out of the movie ""waiting""... (ummm... ya know...yikes... like I'll take the food back and spit on it.) So I declined. Of course my daughter didn't finish the Paul Bunyan meal. So we go to leave to pay the check. She rushes up to hand me the check and says nothing. The cashier asks me how everything was. I complained. Did anyone get a manager. Did the cashier apologize or offer any assistance. NO. NO. NO. NADA. NYET. NOTHING. It's not like I'm looking for a free meal. I paid the whole $35 god damn dollars for a senior size French toast, a lumberjack meal and 1 ""large"" OJ. $35 dollars. THIRTY-FIVE FRICKING DOLLARS FOR BREAKFAST. Way to pad the check. I am so aggravated at the bullshit. At the LACK of assistance and LACK of service, as well as the LACK of common decency. Yeah I said that. Because who in their right mind gives a child a big ass ala carte sized meal. That's completely ridiculous. And I even gave that jerk waitress a tip. I do plan on calling and ""trying"" to speak to a manager or owner. I just don't know if they will have the same attitude as their employees. Ugh.",_3je16-zyJjAGagEHav73g,0,0,1,QoU2md4-uyHaHu-P5B0NSw

We arrived just after 11 and had a 20 min wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather.  Our name was finally called and a 10-13 year old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants is a serious business and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But at R&S, this little one was very mature and informative.  Pleasant surprise.

The wait staff are garbed in PJ sets to match the name of the restaurant. Clever. But the food...not overly complicated and that's how I like my favorite meal of the day.

-Corned beef hash with eggs: yum! Not my typical choice but happy I did this time.
-Peanut Butter and Blueberry jam French toast: this was a buffer dish in case the hash didn't work out but then I just ended up way stuffed.
-Spiced Rib eye steak and eggs: this was the bf's meal. Served with the egg atop nachos instead of the meat was odd and looked very heavy to me. He said it wasn't bad. The streak was seasoned well as I had to try at least one piece.

Its a small place though so going at peak times you can wait. The servers all wear pajamas, upside down umbellas hang from the ceiling and its very quirky in decorations.  The service was good with her continually asking if we need anything and bringing drinks. only issue was he ordered a biscuit and got served sourdough toast. 
There aren't many healthy options on the menu so I got a cobb salad minus a few things. They were good about putting my bacon on the side for him.  It was very good with a nice balance of all the ingredients and not too heavy on the dressing.  It was huge though and I couldn't finish it all so we switched plates....lol.....he got the bacon wrapped steak and eggs and he enjoyed it, only thing left on his plate when he gave it to me were the hashbrowns.  The bread is simple bread as not a fan of the pot of bread as not enough cinnamon gooey-ness if I am going to splurge. 
The guy who you go to in order to pay wasn't sure what to make of our sense of humor but he was very polite and efficient.
Last time I was here I got the fruit which is nicely cut up and a nice size portion.  I would go back as convenient and good options for kids too.",-8syaSLDbMXW2F2FApVgig,1,0,3,MW57VWYjWQnuWHjaWYGlIA

Service was extremely friendly, without being overbearing, and there is no doubt that we will return to Rise & Shine!

I knew in advance that they didn't take reservations, so I warned everybody that we could have a possible wait, a 15 minute average on the weekend mornings, I was told. Everybody, whether via phone or in person, was delightful, and the service was just as good at our table. I don't recall our server's name, but she handled our table of 8, no problem.

I've tried a few things on the menu but today I'll focus my review on the Chicken & Waffles. The batter for the Chicken comes off as really spicy and peppery (if you don't like spice it will be too much for you) and it's paired with your usual waffle. The trick though is to smother it all with the maple sauce and voila! The sweet off sets the spicy perfectly for the right amount of salty, sweet with spice. 

The tables are placed really close together so if you're not into that kind of thing, this isn't the place for you. It can get really busy, especially on the weekends. The open layout leaves you to view the kitchen and the cooks like a diner so the atmosphere is really casual. 

Overall, if you're in the area I'd say definitely give this place a try. They're only open for breakfast and lunch though so if you're trying to go there in the late afternoon, I'd call first because they're probably closed.",ZMUrBWZBXW6kdVUjV9szTg,0,0,4,SUpu8EMam0WibArwq3_dag

Everyone knows you can get a hair anywhere but anyone who works in or owns a restaurant knows you can't charge for the plate that had the hair in it.

My favorite breakfast dishes of all time would have to be chicken n' waffles and corn beef n' hash with eggs. And by far the best place I've had them was at Bouchon inside the Venetian. I know I can't compare a local place like this to an upscale fancy casino spot. However, I've had those two dishes at other places that were by no means fancy and it was still delicious. So I know I'm not being picky. But I was truly disappointed with what I was served on my last visit. 

The corn beef n' hash I ordered was a total disappointment. First I ordered the eggs medium. When my food arrived, they weren't yolky at all. It was cooked completely through. The hash was complete mush and the corn beef was sparse. I hate wasting food, so I ate as much as I could, but I still left some on my plate. The cinnamon bread they serve in the pot was my fave. 

My bf ordered the chicken n' waffles. This was a lot better than my dish. The chicken was crisp and the waffle warm. The chicken was a bit on the dry side so I just smothered it with syrup even more. I love that the syrup is served warm with a cinnamon stick inside the bottle. 

My bf is a huge coffee drinker during breakfast. He will probably go through 3-5 cups. He said that the coffee tasted like the coffee you get at a hospital, so when he only had about 1.5 cups, I knew there was something off. 

3 stars for being seated quickly, our super friendly waitress Shannon and the cute decor. I was really excited to bring the bf to a new breakfast spot, but I'm sad to say that I will not be returning. I will miss the pot of bread though.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,1,1,3,Igxo_pG7lYFM1b7mDADLvw

My husband and kids ate there for my husbands birthday breakfast and the food was just awful .i got the eggs Benedict which used to be my favorite dish until this place singlehandedly ruined it , it was a tough English muffin and the hollandaise was super sour and had way too much lemon in it, not to mention the hash browns we're basically raw and had freezer burn taste to it , they tried to cover it up with an excessive amount of butter . My husband got the country fried steak which was just a piece of thin meat with breading and the breading was very chalky, to call it a country fried steak is giving it too much credit for whatever that mistake was . My kids however liked their food because they are 2 and 3 and giving sugar and pancakes to children is always a success . Long story short , you're over paying for shit food!

The only other closest breakfast place in the area is the griddle on Eastern and IHOP on LV blvd.  Which is crazy busy, because of the tourists.  My original review gave this place 3 stars because the service was very bad and I'm sure it was because they were new.  We have since eaten here 4 times and I have to say that each time has been better service.  The second time we went our waitress never came back to us.  We had another waitress tell us that she would be our new waitress.  I haven't seen that other waitress working there since.  I know I'm focusing on the service on this review, but let's face it.  It's just breakfast food!  I like it because it's close to our house.  
I have to say a little about the food.  I have ordered the ribeye, tenderloins with open face omlet, and the chiliques.  all of these dishes were great.  It's not steak house quality but it's also not steak house price.  My wife always orders the french toast.  She said the french toast is great because it is big texas toast and fluffy.  She makes it a platter with eggs and bacon.  One thing I enjoy about this place is I think they make their own jelly and maple syrup.  My wife also gets the freshly squeezed orange juice.  Overall this breakfast place is a must try!  be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend but at the end it's worth the wait!",3eUPfBdVr1BexmC0bGgCvQ,2,4,4,Qo9wpJc8tv3nh399ZbSWIg

If anyone can justify the long wait, I will change my rating, but I don't understand why it would take this long.

BUT, I love how the waitresses are all in their pjs, and there are spinning flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The food was good, I ordered the ""spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles"" which came with a ""pot of bread"" which is similar to a brioche with cinnamon lining the creases. Think cinnabon without being really sweet. The steak was flavorful and tender, eggs were well seasoned and cooked just the way I ordered (over-medium).

I also stole a few bites from my sister's orders - the ""baked blueberry croissant French toast"" was pretty good. It reminded me of bread pudding slathered with super sweet blueberry compote on top, and it comes with extra compote on the side in case it isn't sweet enough for you. My sister gave up after a few bites because of its sweetness and large, overwhelming size.

As for the ""two fisted crispy chicken bagel and egg sandwich"".. it was really large and bland. Needs more seasoning. It came with half a plate of fries which were really good though!",ZXuzNVdGTdSXjz8QjBS9Hg,0,0,4,OF9ZRlEgMTYV-JoCrRha5A

We did so she walked away and went chatting with another employee, I turned over and she was eating fries from a table nearby. What really blows my mind is that a couple walked 20 minutes before closing and she made it a point to mention to them twice that they were closing shortly and would have to order soon. Not only that but before that couple walked in she made a comment to the other female employee about the couple walking in. Needless to say they left without ordering. Again another couple walks in and she again makes a comment. They sit and she makes it a point to let them know they were closing soon. I asked for a tea refill as I was finishing my food and tells me that they are running out and will check what they have left. She then walks over with a full pitcher.

They have a good size menu, lots to choose from. Mostly breakfast fares but there are some sandwiches and entree salads as well. The first time I was there i had the corned beef and hash with eggs. It was homemade corned beef hash with big chunks of beef and potatoes. it was seasoned well and was agood portion of food. i also have tried their egg and ham hollandaise. hand-cut ham on top of english muffin and perfectly poached eggs on top. the hollandaise sauce was a little tangy for my taste but was still excellent. I tried my boyfriend's steak and eggs and the steak was really good. very tender and well seasoned.

their food is really great and they have a special menu coming soon for daily specials like homemade meatloaf and braised short ribs, etc.
overall a great cozy place to have breakfast with excellent service and good quality food.

3014465,2011-09-18,1,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"I want to emphasize something, dear eateries--cuteness doesn't make up for okay food.  I wanted to like this place a lot, not just for the cow and egg canvas on the wall or the spinning and standstill flower lights overhead.  I wanted to like this place for the simple fact that local eateries should be supported and loved dearly.  Although I love my local places, this one just fell a bit short on taste and overwhelmed me with portion size.  

When you walk in to this place, it's like walking in to a freaky garden turned upside down.  I almost felt like I walked in to the Bug's Life section of California Adventure with the oversizes flowers above my head.  It's cute, though, and has plenty of seating.  The servers are friendly, but they aren't as attentive as they should be.  Although checking on us regularly, when we did want to hail one down it took about three minutes.

My mother and I, after going through the sections of the menu--sandwiches, paninis, waffles, pancakes, specials, omelets, steak, etc.--We landed on two dishes that we felt were different-chilaquiles with salsa avocado and chicken with waffles.  We were excited and couldn't wait for the food to come over.  Thinking it was a regular portion size we even ordered a side of hash browns and bacon.  When the food arrived, however, it was unexpected.  The chilaquiles was actually nachos with eggs on top and half an avocado sliced on top.  IT wasn't that pleasant, although at first it seemed to taste okay.  The chips were soggy and were simply covered in salsa and cheese.  I couldn't see where the chilaquiles part came in at all, to be honest.  The after taste was strong.  The chicken was a breast beat out to what I believe was a chicken fried steak-like thing on top of waffles.  The problem with putting a UFO disc of boneless chicken breast on top of a soft waffle is the oil went in to the waffle a bit, but the heat between the two created condensation that made the waffle soggy.  The chicken was well seasoned, a bit too spicy for just fried chicken, but moist.  The portions, however, were enough to feed 6 people between the two dishes alone.  Still, it was okay.  I do have to emphasize that fried chicken and waffles should be the classic fried chicken pieces with a waffle, but that's just me.

The hash browns weren't pleasant at all to me.  We did order it to have a crispy outside, and I assumed it would be either home fries type of hasbrowns or the typical shredded potato one.  It was..well..like a baked potato was roughly scooped out then patted in to a pancake like hashbrown thing.  They didn't season it either.  I gave it to my husband in a take away box with the leftovers so as not to waste it.  The bacon was nice, though.

Overall, it was okay, and the restaurant is interesting, but I think that there are a few tweaks they need to make.  Then again, I'm one palette against a full restaurant, so maybe I need to try something different next time.

If you go here on the weekends, expect a longer wait time. We waited for a table for around 45 minutes even though we were advised that it will only be a 20-minute wait. When we were finally seated, we were attended to right away. I liked the motif of the interior especially the spinning umbrellas on the ceilings. Our food came out right away, which was great. I ordered the corned beef hash - a classic, how can you mess that up. The flavor is better than most breakfast places that I have tried but I do not like the texture. It was chopped ham with onions and mashed potatoes (supposedly hash brown). It was a little disappointing. Everything else that we ordered were meh. Nothing really stands out. The waffle was too doughy. The orange juice tasted like it was not freshly juiced and it was a little sweet like it was mixed with concentrate (this is just my guess). 

I would still recommend this place. I might come back and give it a second opinion, maybe try their steak and eggs or their pancakes. I think since Rise and Shine is really the ONLY breakfast place in the area (I mean you can get breakfast food at The Lodge except it's a bar), a lot of people would be willing to wait for a table here. I personally think it was not worth the wait. They need to open more breakfast places in this side of town.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,2,1,3,EmfFlrA1XCCcsslvmPJP4A

One little quirk that I found endearing was the fact that the servers here run around in their pajamas while taking your order and serving you. Nice little gesture to make you feel at ease and that you don't have to take things too seriously.

We arrived and were told that the omelets are great, the Pot'o'Bread is THE BEST, and that the steak n eggs are pretty bomb. 

Well, what was told is pretty much truth. I got a pretty hefty and filling omelet, the wife got the steak n eggs, and we all got Pots o Bread.

Now I have to say - the PoBs were a little underwhelming. Really cool concept, fun little quirk to have as a staple of your establishment... but too me, there wasn't enough cinnamon and there wasn't quite enough flavor. But still! The texture was great and it was really fun to enjoy.

The servings are all pretty big as both the lady and I had to take our food to go [and I'm a pretty hefty eater]. The steak that she got was more fatty than we'd prefer, but there was still a substantial enough amount of meat for us to enjoy.

The service here is great, everyone is friendly, and you feel very welcomed to enjoy a good time at Rise & Shine. Not bad, you guys, not bad at all.

The flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and tile framed windows made the setting more whimsical than industrial. The waitresses all had on pajama style uniforms which was a nice added touch. (Though I also have to mention the owner was working the cash register but didn't make much of an effort to make an impression with customers). 

The food was very good - we ordered the chiliquilas and steak along with the Belgium waffles. We also got the French press coffee which is served at the table with a timer for the perfect cup. 

So why only 3 stars?  This place was good but a little expensive and they charge extra for everything! In fact, a whole column of the menu has the run down on these charges... But these items arent really ""sides"" -- unless you usually eat avocado by itself?  Also, $4 for bacon?  I got my breakfast with steak for only $3 more than the chiliquilas by themselves so I'm not sure about the math on this one. Bottom line, this place is a little out of the way, nestled in a neighborhood strip mall, and could do better on the pricing for what it is...

I arrived around 11am and it was busy. I drove here from Lake Las Vegas so when I was told the pot of breads were all gone, I was definitely disappointed. 

I had some coffee to start which was actually a good cup of joe. My waitress was really busy and I was in a really patient mood so it was all good. She finally came to
take our order. I ordered the Ultimate Steak breakfast which consisted steak (obviously), 2 eggs, hash browns and my choice of bread (except the pot of bread).

I ordered my steak medium but it came more well then anything. We waited about 20 minutes or more for our food so I decided to keep it. First off, this rib-eye was super thin. I have never had a rib-eye steak that was so thin. 

I ordered my eggs over medium. The yolk portion was perfect but the eggs were a little too brown on the outside and they were more yolk than egg white. It was like two big eyeballs on my plate. Not sure what happened to the egg white portion. 

My hashbrowns were okay but like most everything else on the plate, it was cold.

First I have to say the restaurant itself is cute. I loved the umbrellas on the ceiling. Very unique and adorable. That's the only thing I could say I actually liked. 

The service was the worst I've ever had and I mean worst!!! As soon as we were greeted by the server (christine) we felt her negative vibe. You could tell she didn't want to be there. She even rolled her eyes and started looking around the restaurant while we were taking to her. I was really hoping my son wouldn't notice because he's super picky about customer service. As soon we'll she walked away he's like ""Did you see that""!!! Unfortunately I did. Not once did she not ask us on how our food was. When they (her and another server) dropped our food she didn't even ask if we needed anything else. My son waited 10 minutes after our food was served to get sour cream. He tried getting her attention....She looked right at him and walked away. Finally he just got up and went to go ask the cooks for the sour cream. 

The food was not worth the $44.00 we spent. I had the red velvet pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon. I specifically asked the server to make the bacon well done. Didn't happen. The pancakes were hard and crispy. Really pancakes crispy!? Ugh. My son had the steak omelette I think. He said it was ok but not worth the money.

Also, they removed my favorite lunch combo (soup and southwestern chicken salad) They no longer have the soup and salad combo and they no longer have the Onion Soup or the Southwestern Chicken salad. They also removed the delicious Pot of Bread from (at the very least) the Chicken and Waffle. 
You simply shouldn't remove items that accompanied entrees in the past. If you want to remove an entree fine but removing an accompanying item gives a bad experience.

Like almost everyone else, this place is really far from us in the NW but it was well worth the drive. It is kinda small and we went for brunch but I'm guessing during breakfast, you may have to wait a bit.

Of course I got the chicken and waffles...and it's one of the best versions I've had in Vegas! Even though I usually prefer bone-in breasts, they give you two huge boneless breasts that were excellent! The chicken itself is fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and super moist inside. Killer seasoning on the chicken too, it's not overly salty and even had a slight bit of spicy kick in it. The Belgian waffle was delicious, super moist, fluffy and they bring out a bunch of butter and warm syrup with the plate. My wife had the biscuits and gravy which she's normally really picky with but she loved it.

We really liked this place but I think there prices are too high. The chicken and waffles is $13 which is a huge plate but the biscuits and gravy was kinda small portion-wise and was $10. They also charge $2.50 for HALF an avocado which is ridiculous. The waitresses dressed in pajamas was a nice touch and ours was really nice.

This time around the corned beef was not as good as the first time: this time it seemed like more potato than meat which is disappointing.  So may not come back for corned beef next time.  My party seemed to enjoy their food the most part, the chicken fried steak my sister in law had was very fatty and far too breaded.  Service this time was pretty bad, never checked how our food was, never bothered to see if we needed more beverages till we had to ask.  I asked for more water and only half the table got water...  So service is really lacking.  We were also very bothered that not just w our table but the table next to us when we were still eating or had food on our plate.  It was a clear ploy to get us going since they are backed up on a wait, but never rush your guests... Bad form.  Sure other people are giving 5 stars but I'm wondering they are being objective.

I ordered the Ham N Eggs Benedict which was very appetizing to look at, who doesn't eat with their eyes first? The ham to English muffin ratio was perfect and the hollandaise sauce was smooth and rich. The hash browns were more on the crispy side,which I prefer. Overall it was a great tasting meal. I would definitely order it again. 

I recommend to definitely get the pot of bread, if your meal does not come with it. It's like a less sweeter version of a cinnamon bun in a cup. It was delicious. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. Honestly this bread along with another side choice, & a cup of coffee would be a perfect light breakfast.

On Monday before taking my mother-in-law to the airport, we stopped in at Rise & Shine and I couldn't resist the baked blueberry French toast casserole.   The hubs and his mom had what appeared to be the regular eggs and bacon breakfast with hash browns but the taters were so tasty and seasoned and the bacon so crisp and smoky!

The waitress was friendly, helpful, and had recommendations as we had never been there.  She was very nice throughout.  I had a GoGo drink that was fresh juice and id say about 8 oz for $5.  Way to small but delicious.   Then i ordered the corned beef hash with bacon.  It was nothing short of fantastic!  3 poached eggs that were cooked to perfection with this dish.  This came with 1 small biscuit.  It needed 2 at that size.  My friend ordered a steak breakfast burrito with the steak done medium.  The sauce (like an adobo) was aweful.   The meat was super well done.  And as a hole it was terrible.  (Hate to say that about any dish) but she had about 1/2 and was done.   1 coffee as well.

This is only my second chance to try this restaurant and will probably be the last. To start off my experience, my wife and I were asked to wait for a seat. Normally, this is no problem but I could see at least 4 tables that were clean and nobody sitting at them. Not a big deal as we were in no hurry. 
We were seated and taken care of right away. We ordered coffee and water and needed a couple of minutes do decide on our food. My wife ordered the French toast and I ordered biscuits and gravy. For the next twenty minutes we listened to the cook argue with the waitresses and watched customers walk out the front door. Almost 30 ,minutes went by and our food finally arrived. I got scrambled eggs instead of over easy and the waitress fixed it right away. My wife's meal was warm but certainly not hot.
As I dug into my biscuits and gravy, I was greeted by crunchy biscuits and a sad excuse for gravy. The biscuits tasted like the kind you would get in a tube of Pillsbury and I needed a knife to cut them. The gravy was clumpy and tasteless. I have been cooking gravy for many years and it looked like the flour, or mix, in this case was thrown in and not blended very well. This was, by far, the worst plate of biscuits and gravy I have every eaten. Biscuits and gravy is a relatively easy dish to do well and it says volumes when a breakfast restaurant cannot do it right.
I did let the girl at the register know how disappointed I was with my breakfast and she took it off my bill. That was very cool.
My first time to Rise and Shine was pretty good and the second was less than impressive. I was told that the reason the prices were a little high is because of the quality ingredients that were used. I would disagree. It seems like either corners are being cut or the cooks are not happy with their jobs. Either way, this will probably be my last adventure out of the way to come to Rise and Shine..",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,1,0,2,M1Qw4V71--2MJ7tx0YzZmQ

It is in the same shopping center as Off the Strip Just Real Food, which offers brunch but only on Sundays. It just opened yesterday and appears to already be a hit with the locals.

There is a wide selection of breakfast and lunch options but, as their name suggests, it is all about their steak and eggs. My husband ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak ($10.95), his usual order that is usually the determining factor in whether a breakfast joint is worth it. I ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles ($11.25).  Both dishes were huge and very filling. The chicken fried steak was good but, according to the husband, doesn't live up to his standards because the batter wasn't flavorful enough. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. The breast was moist and the batter was light and airy. The Belgian waffle was delicious as was the maple syrup.

The décor is nice with mosaic walls and flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The service was prompt and decent considering they just opened the day before. I give this place a 3  1/2 stars because it is definitely worth trying but I still prefer other breakfast/brunch places such as The Original Pancake House and The Egg & I.

The five dollar half waffle (not Belgian/huge/pick your adjective) was the biggest head scratcher.

I had the steak and eggs while my partner in crime had the chicken fried steak (she fancies Crack'n Barrell - but it is 2 hours away!)

The steak was ok - it was moist not dry. It was good with its side kick A1.

The chicken fried steak had a piece of hair or nylon in the breading which we made sure the waitress know, but we said its ok we just wanted to bring it to your attention. Five minutes later, the server brought her a new freshly cooked chicken fried steak as a courtesy @ no charge. Well... since she was halfway through her meal we decided to take it with us.

Like Marie T., this place USED to be my favorite breakfast place. It was also icing on the cake that it is walking distance from my abode. I keep giving them chances to change my mind, but I get disappointed every time.

My favorite thing to order is the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. Thankfully, its taste consistency has remained the same and is always ""good."" My second favorite would be the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle. I was never a fan of Chicken & Waffles until I ate it at this place. The New York Steak, Spinach, & Benedict-Bagel was the worst thing that I have ever ordered. The presentation was extremely lacking.. The words Hot Mess came to mind; which made my food unappetizing. 

The Pot of Bread for a side is one of the reasons why I keep wanting to come back, but for the last THREE times they have been unable to keep up with the demand and simply say ""they're out."" Instead, customers have to choose between getting toast or a biscuit. Ugh. If you're a server and you see that my hash browns are either burnt or undercooked then do not bring it out to me.

Charleston, Yes, I am that person who'll drive AAAAAAALL the way to Hendertucky for the best Snow Ice in town, and Yes, there are too many whiner vaginers who make a big deal because of the distance travelling farther than outside of their hood....two answers for you-1) Stay home, or
2) Make like Rhianna and SHUT UP AND DRIVE!!!!

Breakfast/Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and we're always looking for another spot to add into our breakfast/brunch rotation. I like the quirky atmosphere here. Everyone is so welcoming as you walk in, spinning umbrellas up on the ceiling, waitresses in pajamas like they just rolled out of bed ready to serve you. Puts a smile on your face..:) One weird thing was the ""Help us...Yelp us"" on the back of the busboys' shirts. Don't know if that's against Yelp policy, but its not like they need to do that....They have a great fan base, and great food!

Menu selections here are plentiful, and our waitress Riley was AWESOME SAUCE! She was very informative, personable, and offered up suggestions, popular items, and even her personal favorites. when we narrowed it down, we split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread(Took a page from Jamms?) as our bread choice, with some fresh squeezed OJ(they use Navel, not Valencia) Two HUGE chicken breasteses were fried to perfection-crisp, well seasoned exterior, and the inside stayed nice and juicy and went perfectly with the crisp, light waffle drizzled with the cinnamon infused syrup, which was unfortunately Log Cabin. The ribeye was a perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were not your typical out of the box type and you can tell it was made in house. Nice and crisp on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside. As popular as they are, the potted bread didn't arrive until after we were done with breakfast. No one's fault though, as Riley even offered another bread choice, we chose to wait. Its kinda like a little Cinnabon in a flower pot that comes with a cream cheese glaze on the side and was a great ending to our meal.

Definitely can't wait to come back to attack their Sweet Cream Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and other popular items.   ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,16,10,5,Cn-S4bzEjmnkUvp30vJeFQ

The waffles are gigatic. Not scary Man vs. Food gigantic but, definately better tasting than Hash House a Go Go, iHop, Denny's, even Egg and I. Their potatoes hash is really good. Not mushy and spiced just right.
The steak was made perfect. Moist but, over done like South Point's steak.

I found this place using my mobile search app, and I must say I am damn glad I did.  First of all, the atmosphere is darling- bright sunny yellow walls, cute parasol light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it just made you feel more cheerful walking through the door.   The servers were all on point, and maybe that is because they are extra comfy- all of the servers are working in their PJ's.  

Now for the important part- the food.    I ordered the chilaquiles and eggs. They didn't dissapoint.  Eggs cooked perfectly atop perfectly cooked tortilla chips softened in a tangy but not too spicy tomato sauce.   My Son put the hurt on a huge portion of chicken and waffles.  He was also impressed that they did little things like warming the syrup.   My daughter ordered a spinach/mushroom/swiss omelette.  She said it was delicious and not ""too"" cheesy.  My husband ordered the english banger sausage and eggs.  He said that the sausage was a bit too mild, and could have been a little more savory. 

If there was anything that I could say could improve is explaining to the customers the unique things that the restaurant offers-  The server asked us if we wanted toast, muffin or what sounded like ""powder bread"" .  None of us knew what the hell that was, so nobody ordered it.   It was only later that I noticed these cute little individual breads baked in tiny little terra cotta pots sitting in the pass.   I would have definitely ordered this just to give something new a try.  Something that could have been avoided with a little enunciation.",87LhHHXbQYWr5wlo5W7_QQ,3,3,4,DPQ-MZ-rdDmDVklsyZLlUw

Aside of those minor glitches everything was great, the chilaquiles were perfection from the beans, cheese, homemade tortilla chips and salsa.  My husband raved about the eggs benedict too.

We were a party of five and when we sat down, we asked for water and coffee. We waited for our beverages for more than fifteen minutes. While waiting, we start seeing other parties being seated. They were getting drinks... Where the hell was ours? We couldn't even find our server and we were getting agitated and hungry. 

Finally, our server comes out of the woodwork and gives us our beverages. We gave our order and that too, took forever and a day! They were out of peanut butter and blueberry French toast that we ordered, but didn't tell us until ten minutes later. While waiting, we watch getting more and more pissed with every person on the same row as us get their food while we did not - and we arrived before ALL of them! 

Our server was not attentive, never apologized, and we just felt like they could of cared less if we got up and left. After feeling like we've been there for thirty minutes, we finally get our food. I shared the corn beef hash with my sister. It was ok - I've had better corn beef hash elsewhere. The only reason I give this place two stars instead of one was their Belgian waffle.

To preface this review, the food was good. And you get a lot of it. Customer service was...meehhhhh.

THE REVIEW: I ordered the steak and eggs bagel. The steak was cooked great, the bacon was good, and the amount of food was insane. I ordered it with a side of fries. I was munching away, actually rather enjoying my bagel sandwich, when I was unpleasantly surprised by a sharp poke in my mouth. I had bitten into a toothpick that had been left in the steak. The toothpick had been used to hold the filet medallion inside the wrapped bacon. Now, I wasn't seriously injured, but it was an unpleasant sensation at the very least. I informed the waitress who apologized, and about 5 minutes later a man (whom I take it was a chef) came out and apologized. We get the bill of $34 for our breakfast, which surprised me. I have always been under the impression that when your food isn't cooked/presented appropriately (which I would consider foreign objects left in my food ""not cooked/presented appropriately""), that you never charge the customer for that item. I was definitely disappointed with this, but neglected to argue or contest this. To me it should have been up to the management to make that decision on their own, and it will most definitely influence my decision in the future as to whether or not to patronize this establishment again.

Would I come here again? Probably not.
Would I recommend this place to others? Possibly. Have not decided yet.",wt57fkTOcSCYNb2fNAOlyg,6,4,2,kQF4c-DVCviKfyUHUqyJgQ

3873197,2015-06-02,4,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"It had been over a year since our last foray to Southern Highlands to dine at Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issues that had kept us away for so long; the ineptitude of the hostess staff.  We added our name to the list when we arrived and were given a 30 minute wait time.  At the 45 minute mark, I asked about our table and was told that there were still 8 parties ahead of us and that they were seating the larger parties first.  uh, okay...  I asked if we could sit at the counter and was told that the counter was part of the wait list, but it was empty.  At the 1 hour mark, I inquired again and was told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  I asked again about the counter (now with one patron sitting there) and was told that it was closed today.  Weird  

Even though I was annoyed, I felt committed to stick it out after waiting so long.  We were finally seated after waiting an hour and 20 minutes, but only because two parties of 2 in front of us gave up and left.  Maybe they did not appreciate being told that larger parties were more important than they were. 

On to happier subjects:  The food!  

I ordered the Ultimate steak & egg breakfast: $12.95 for an 8oz Rib Eye, two eggs, and hash browns with the pot of bread.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, the eggs and hash browns standard, and the pot of bread (basically a cinnamon roll) was good. solid 4/5  

The BF had the Fried Chicken & Waffle: $11.95 for a boneless chicken breast coated in buttermilk and fried sitting on top of a Belgian waffle.   I didn't try this, but was told that it was just okay. 3/5  

I also used the Chamucos Jalapeno Hot Sauce on my eggs and saw that it was made in Henderson.  The waitress noticed that I was reading the bottle and advised that they had bottles for sale for $6, so I scooped one of those up for home use!

I can't really say for sure if we'll ever go back, but I hope they work out their front of house issues.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,8,6,3,BP_TmofgKm5zgUIK7CQhtA

The first one was 3 years ago or so and I recently came here because 2 of my friends raved about how good the chicken and waffles is. The first time I don't remember what I ordered but it was something from the steak and eggs side of the menu, wasn't really that good considering I can't remember what it was and it didn't bring me back. We had the pot of bread on both visits and yes it is good especially if you smother it with butter, but hey adding butter to anything makes it taste good. So the second visit my friend I shared the chicken and waffle. It was a huge piece of chicken breast on top of a waffle. The thing that stuck out to me was that the breading had a slight spice to it, very nice touch I must say.  I also like the fact they use a chicken breast which makes it easier to eat with a waffle and place both waffle and chicken on your fork. The is definitely a sharable portion as my friend and I were full afterwards.  It was pretty good, but nothing to make me drive all the way over here considering the location is all the way in Southern Highlands. One of my friend's who recommended it said it's better than Roscoe's chicken and waffles?! I've never had Roscoe's, but if Rise and Shine is a 3.5 in my book I can only wonder why people rave about Roscoe's?! If I wasn't too weight conscious I probably would of gotten a parfait as well.

To say that I'll never come back is an understatement. I want the 2.5 hours of my life back with it. We arrived at 950 and were given a 15 minutes wait time, we were sat at 1041. That's right,  almost 50 minutes later. The only reason we waited was because of the great reviews. I'm willing to give some time for something delicious without a problem. Again, it was a Sunday, so a wait is expected, but I counted 3 groups before us who I overheard complain of the wait. ..one waited close to an hour! If my meal had been mildly satisfying I wouldn't be giving 1 star.

By the time we were sat, we were crazy hungry. So, you would think that because we were starving ANYTHING would taste like heaven!  There were 5 of us, and 2 ordered two meal options to share, so we ordered 7 different things. I don't even remember how long the food took, but it definitely wasn't a reasonable amount. I'll start by saying 2 ordered ribeye option and we left half of it on our plate.  I've never had such disappointing ribeye in my life. And my father who never complains, commented on the quality. I don't remember what came on the side with it because everything on that plate was a total dissapointment. The burrito my boyfriend ordered was pretty to look at, but even with the handful of ingredients was nothing but a bland mess. We get a ""dessert"" pancake that we had one bite of and didn't take home, which we always do because I hate wasting food but there was no saving that thing to eat later. 

Considering you pay about $11-16 per dish, I would think you get something well worth your money. I'm thinking now, their hope is to starve people with the wait in hopes they're so hungry at the end they just inhale everything and say it tasted delicious. 

Either way, don't take my word, eat here then drive down a bit further and try something else. There's a plethora of restaurants within a couple miles, some good, this one terrible. Also, please stop with the pajama uniform. It's not cute. I couldn't tell which waitress was awake and which rolled right out of bed. Some of those pajamas looked pretty gross.

3943099,2018-04-27,1,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"WOW!  What an awesome breakfast/lunch/brunch place!  They're only open for these three meals and close pretty early in the day (I think they close at 3:00pm).

Inside this simple exterior tucked in a strip mall you'll find some excellent food.  The inside is similarly simple but with a warm, comfortable feel.  There is a small outside patio area with tables they will setup for you with an umbrella to shield you from the desert sun.  This is ideal if you want to dine with your four legged friend.

The servers wear pajamas!  It's true!  What a fun little touch.  They seemed very friendly as well, and drinks were kept topped up.

The food was awesome.  I recommend their ultimate steak and eggs featuring two or three eggs, hash browns, steak, and a bread choice.  I went for scrambled eggs.  These were just OK; the consistency was kind of... solid.  Sort of like when you scoop them out of a hot tray at a buffet.  The hash browns were very good.  Crispy, crunchy, and actually seasoned instead of just salty.  The steak... wow!  I did not expect it to be such good quality.  It was marbled but not overly fatty, and it was tender and tasty.  I ate the whole thing, and I'm not even a huge steak fan!  Do yourself a favor and try the pot of bread choice.  Think of a small cinnamon roll served in a teacup and you'll get the idea.  It's just enough for a bit of sweetness without eating a huge cinnamon roll.  Given the quality and quantity of food it's a bargain at $14.95 ($16.95 with three eggs).

I made it a point to plan the rest of my stay in Vegas around having breakfast at Rise & Shine. My wife and I found each experience to be more enjoyable than the last. 

The atmosphere is pleasant, the staff friendly and professional. You have the option of dining inside or outside. The place is patronized by many people, and you may very well have to wait to be seated, especially on the weekends. We were there when it seemed to be peak hour for business and we never waited more than 15 minutes.

The menu! It screams ""breakfast"", yet with many creative twist to otherwise conventional meals. Overall it's the perfect combination of quality and quantity. I had the Ultimate Steak Breakfast, oh so satisfying. A large ribeye steak, eggs, hash browns and choices of breads. All made to your liking of course. What really blew me away, was the Cinnamon Crunchy French Toast. My taste buds are still having a party (licking my lips).

I like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.

The main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.

My server, sorry I didn't note the name, was quite good.  The restaurant is not large and when I was leaving around 9:30, there was a wait for tables.

We got a junky table right next to the open door with frigid gusts coming through.  We asked to be moved and were reseated in a nice booth within 5 minutes. Crisis averted.

Good coffee.  We just got the plain ole, plain ole instead of the french press, and it was good.

I decided, since the name says ""a steak and egg place,"" I should probably order steak and eggs.  So, I ordered the ""ultimate,"" a ribeye (my fave cut), 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough. $12.95.  The steak was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned.   The hashbrowns were good.  A nice rustic style different from your average frozen shredded hashbrown.  Eggs were cooked perfect as well, just needed salt and pepper.  Easy to add. No complaints.

My gal pal ordered the steak and chilaquiles.  They were very tasty, and quite a portion! I cleverly coerced her into ordering the cinnamon bread so we could share.  It was good.  However; not sweet like I had anticipated.  

The restaurant is super cute.  Decor is charming.  Menu is cluttered and overwhelming.  The service was excellent.  Offered to refill our coffee 3-4 times, allowed us planty of time to chat.  Didn't rush us.

We had a lovely breakfast and I would go back anytime!  I would give it five stars if they had additional offerings such as lattes, cappucinos, bloody mary's and mimosas.  Necessary breakfast beverages in my book.

We had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately the menu serves up cheap ingredients to its patrons (for the exception of the Illy coffee) and the cooks fall short on preparing food properly.  

At a price point of $10-$15 for breakfast, they should know how to cook eggs properly.  Nothing irritates us more than when a cook makes two cheap/small eggs (over medium)  together on an extremely high heat using a bright yellow colored fat  (margarine?).  The plate was loaded with what appeared to be nasty refined margarine or oil.  I soaked up two napkins full of this nasty stuff.  We were delivered two rounds of this type of cooking and just gave up.  The hash browns that we ordered as golden (as opposed to raw in oil) were flash fried.  Disgusting and half hearted presentation.  Seriously, Robert Irvine would have hit the roof if he was ever served this food.  

We also ordered  pancakes that were loaded with artificial vanilla extract.  I've tasted better frozen pancakes than the chemical cakes cakes served at this restaurant.
Sorry but it's true. Very disappointing.

If money is no object and you don't care about what's in the food that you put into your body, this is your place.

It was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!!
Anyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!

The food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though...
I loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!!

The pot of bread had been sitting on the shelf for a while, and we watched the server take it from the shelf to the kitchen and microwave it. You know how bread gets chewy after the microwave; that's what it tasted like!   I would've rather had it at room temperature.  Very Disappointing.

Babies food was 1 pancake, 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $6.00. Not bad. That's about average. Again, the food is amazing. But the price is WAY to much for the little that you get. Will drive all the way to Jamm's for something almost as good and A LOT more food for a reasonable price (even with paying for gas we will be ahead of the game).",nMi6OA6_ZaEW855eobZ9Vw,0,0,2,1DxV_iYVoQJVM-YnAwmqXw

Really cute decor and wait staff in PJ's,, very charming.  We had an excellent waitress that took very good care of us, always very attentive.  I would say the table ordered just about every type of breakfast for the table.  From pancakes, omelets, oatmeal, bacon/eggs and potatoes.  Everything was delicious and filling.  My meal came with the pot of bread which I loved.  Half cinnamon roll and half dinner roll.  Yummy, although is wish it was bigger.

My only negative is that I was a little pricey.  This place is in a shopping plaza not anywhere near the strip (which was our intention).  I felt I was a bit expensive for what I perceived to be a local place to dine.  Since we did eat late for breakfast we were good until, dinner, no lunch required!  Very filling!

If you want to splurge order the fresh squeezed OJ.  Pricey at $3.25 a glass but tasted fresh and it was fabulous!",IKl4ULAu-75lCef5KUwntA,0,0,4,9vY9XVzm8nA2LXqk5oxY9g

We decided to split a Steak and Chorizo burrito and Corned Beef Hash. Our waitress was really nice, and brought waters to the table before we even placed our order. 

The burrito was huge and looked amazing. We cut into it and began eating. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium-rare. The more we ate though, we did not find any chorizo. There were eggs, but no chorizo. We figured that maybe we got the wrong order, but I didn't see any other steak breakfast burrito on the menu. So that was a bummer. it was still tasty, but not what we were looking forward to having. The Corned Beef Hash was good. It was seasoned differently than any other we have had up to this point, and because of this it kind of threw us off somehow. 

It was very loud in here for breakfast. The entrance is very awkward and cramped as well. Immediately inside the door there are benches on either side. There is nowhere to stand, only to sit. While paying, people are coming in and being led to their seats. I went to wait outside because I was constantly having to move out the way of incoming customers and the wait staff. Behind the register is the door that leads out to the patio. It is just a very small area, with a lot going on all at once.

We found this restaurant on Yelp, and with the near ease of our Navigation system, managed our way to the restaurant.  We were seated almost immediately, which was great since about 20 people showed up in the next 15 minutes or so.  After waiting far too long to be greeted at our table, I walked up and asked the hostess if there was someone assigned to our table.  She said yes, and that she would go find her.  She returned in just a couple of minutes to say that the server must be in the bathroom, and offered to get us started with coffee.  We told her that we were in a hurry to order because we were trying to get out of town and back home (who'da guessed we were in for a 6-1/2 hour traffic jam all the way back to San Diego) to our kids.  She suggested that she could take our breakfast order and get everything started until our server was able.  And she did.  Amber appeared on scene a few minutes later.  We knew it was our server, because the hostess was going over our order with her, and because we hadn't seen her before.  She was either sick or just unhappy to be there, and her demeanor when she did finally come to our table reflected that.  Her energy, or lack thereof, was the counter balance to all the other busy bees.  In fact, she even dropped one of the pots of bread on an adjacent table.  Our food was served by another server - who we are guessing was either the owner or manager.  She was extremely pleasant, and the food was delicious.  We asked Amber for our check - again, because we were trying to get out quickly - and it took her several minutes to drop it.  I was just about to go up to the hostess stand to request it when she dropped it on the table.  When she noticed I already had cash in my hand, Amber did offer to go to the register and cash it out for us.  We didn't take her up on it, but that was something.  I would have just liked to have seen some degree of service before we were on our way out the door.  This was our first trip to Las Vegas in more than 10 years, so it's unlikely that we will be going back soon.  But if we were in town again, I would absolutely return for breakfast.

The hash was crispy and the portions are huge.  They also serve French pressed coffee, but I brought my own Starbucks.  I think next time, I'll try their French press coffee.  They also have a thing called bread in a pot as a substitute for toast.  It's literally some bread in a flower pot.  It's combo of various breads/rolls.  I opted for the plain biscuit which was very good, but small in comparison to what you get in a bread pot.  I didn't finish my meal, so the biscuit was just fine.  The only complaint I could have is the sunny up eggs had a bit too much raw whites, but that's okay. It's just more gravy for the hash browns when mixed with the yolk.  I would rank this CFS right up there with Maple Tree.",NI2glfU_qscu4YcxtI8F9Q,2,2,5,268sIOwoOaZPtI3CsSuJgw

Service was exceptional from the hostess to our server - no complaints here! 

Why 3 stars? 

Corn beef hash was a very small serving size and I've had better. The breakfast burrito was huge but tasted okay. One thing to note is that the retried beans were EXTRA salty. Maybe it was just a bad batch but it was horribly salty and the part of it that touched the burrito made my burrito super salty. I'm usually a fan of breakfast burritos so I was disappointed here. 

We got banana pancakes as well - this was delicious! The pancakes were the highlight of the meal, but otherwise the food was okay. 

Prices were a little on the high side in my opinion, especially for mediocre food (with the exception of banana pancakes).

I ordered a special egg white omelet with specific ingredients. I came about 35 minutes after I ordered the food. I was fine to eat the food... But they had thrown it away and offered to just make a new one no charge. I was very appreciative..(I just always have a fear of cooks doing something to the food in orders like these.) but I accepted and it was quite delicious. Maybe a little runny. But sizzling hot and I guess as good and as exciting as an egg white omelet can get.... 

One thing I'd like to note... I know it's 'their thing' to run around in their PJs. All the servers etc... But when I come in there sometimes it looks really messy. I see people in their PJs. 3 tables that still haven't been bussed and crumbs everywhere. Just something they might want to take note to. Also, the cooks and servers are always shouting to one another from across the room... Because the cooks station is open to the restaurant. (You'd understand this layout I'm mentioning if you've actually eaten here).  

BUT.... It you are in the area, they have consistently good breakfast food and always seem to be pretty busy. All servers I've ever had have been nice... Some of the hostesses make me nervous...

The decor is incredibly imaginative. The ceiling fans all have umbrella-like covers that are large flower prints - dahlias, chrysanthemums, others. The wall colors are vibrant. Located in a strip mall, the restaurant is modest size. It's also quite popular, so don't be surprised to wait for a table.

However long your wait, it's worth it. The food is sublime. Rise and Shine bills itself as a steak-and-eggs place, so I ordered steak and eggs. My half pound ribeye was perfectly done and just great flavor. I asked Lisa the secret. She said the steaks are seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and coffee grounds. She said the delicious hash browns had the same seasonings except substitute shallots for coffee grounds. 

Your order comes with a choice of breads: get the ""pot of bread,"" as unique an offering as there is. It's a cinnamon roll baked in a coffee cup. Tip the cup and out comes the roll; apply butter and enjoy!

Chicken and waffles is also on the menu; the waffle is light and terrific with the cinnamon-infused syrup. The chicken breast is pounded thin, breaded and flash fried to a crispy delight, moist and tender and not greasy at all. 

How about the coffee: choose from an Italian blend, or French press. The French press comes with a three-tube hourglass that allows you to gauge the strength of your coffee. 

An important part of the dining experience is your server. He or she can make or break your meal. The servers here are clad in pajamas which are colorful and clearly comfortable. Lisa was an integral part of our experience. She engaged with us, laughed, joked, teased and was teased in return. She took excellent care of us.

4414617,2012-10-04,4,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"Sometimes after a weekend in Vegas, you just want to get out ASAP especially if you have a long drive home. We all have our exodus go to spots. Many of us want to cure our hang-overs so we head to Chinatown for Pho. Some want to get that steak and eggs for under $10 at smaller hotels. Few of us want to load up at a buffet before having to sit in that strenuous car ride and hoping that we can make it home before we have to drop the kiddies off at the pool. On the most previous occasion out to Sin City, I suggested something a little different to the crew. Let's check out this place called Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place which is kind of south of the strip and sort of in the path back to LA. It seemed like the majority of the people who dined here were regulars and/or locals. 

This little restaurant is open daily from 7am-3pm only. They serve breakfast items the entire time during their hours of operation and lunch menu kicks in at 11:30am. We arrived right before noon on Sunday. For our party of seven, it took nearly 20 minutes for them to get us a table. The place isn't really big to begin with. I would say that 4-5 people max per table is ideal. There is a dining counter and you can also eat outside if the weather permits. Take notice of the waitresses' uniform; they're catchy because they are wearing pajamas. An awesome concept and it looks very comfortable. The bus boys have black tee shirts on that say something along the lines of help them by visiting Yelp.

We all ended up ordering hefty breakfast dishes on this morning because we were all mc-fatties ready to go to town. I went with the Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast - cinnamon crunch coasted, served with a warm glass bottle of maple syrup ($8.95). I made it a platter by adding two eggs and a turkey kielbasa (bacon or sausage is also avail) for an extra $3.50. It was a big meal indeed. The French toast was soft but not mushy and full of flavors from the cinnamon and tang of the raisins. The big turkey kielbasa was a nice compliment with the eggs. Surely French toast by itself isn't sufficient. I was definitely a happy camper.

A couple of my friends got the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast & Waffle ($11.95) which was a hit on the table. A thick piece of battered chicken breast sitting on top a fluffy waffle. Juicy white meat and far from dry. It's nothing like Roscoe's Carol C. Special but it should deserve recognition of its own. Before you start bashing me by saying, ""I've had better fried chicken Smitcha!"" All I'm saying is that it's pretty good and never did I claim it was the best I've had. 

Another friend ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak but from what I heard, he wasn't too impressed and felt like he should've went with the fried chicken and waffles.

Service was on point and like an oldskool coffee shop, I took my tab and paid at the register. I regret not trying pot of bread that everyone seems to be rave about on Yelp. Bring your appetite to this place because after this meal, I was seriously full until later that night. Plus, there are many options to choose from their menu. I will say that it was a great meal but it also made me feel like I was good on a typical American breakfast for some time. Once in a while a 1500+ calorie, single serving meal is okay but just not too often or else Dr. Chen will start chewing me out about my weight and high blood pressure.",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,6,2,4,Ng5sdwH2F1Lf99jZlAoT6A

I order fries because there's this other brunch place my boyfriend and I like to go to and their fries are so amazing that whenever I visit I always eat there.

Unfortunately due to the 24 hour buffet pass I was only looking for a salad or something green. I'll have to try the red velvet realness on my next visit. I ended up getting a most delicious grilled chicken cobb salad. It was HUGE! It was one of the best cobb salads I've ever had it comes with ranch dressing and I did SOS sauce on side. Usually cobb salad comes with blue cheese which I thought was good until I had R&S grilled chicken cobb. My friend devoured the chicken wrap. He said it was very similar to McDonald's chicken wrap, which is discontinued, but better. Wish I had taken photos but we were all super hungry and had to eat and go quick. 

Rise & Shine is a local breakfast joint where waiters and waitresses get on with their day in PAJAMAS! Wild. It's very family friendly, reasonably priced, and best of all the menu has a little something for everyone. There's a large variety of breakfast items as well as ""afternoon items"" which we had at 11:30am so I guess it's just what they call that section but doesn't mean you have to wait until noon. The interior is big and cool with a fun surprise on the ceiling. Everyone here has a great attitude, very friendly and attentive even when they're busy. You can call ahead of time and check out the wait time, it'll most likely be 5-10 minutes.

They were way to salty for me, but my husband liked his chicken fried steak, and eggs benedict the last couple of times we've went.

Their fresh orange juice is definitely recommended, and their ""dinnamon"" rolls (a mix of cinnamon roll and dinner roll) were amazing.

4579748,2015-01-05,1,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"The hubby and I had a great breakfast here but I would have to agree with Michael U., a most conscientious and loquacious Yelper, that this is probably not the best breakfast in Las Vegas. Still, it's good food and very reasonably priced. And I do think it is cute that the waitresses are all in PJs... it goes with the whimsical décor.

Hubby is a huge steak and egg fan. That is his go-to breakfast order. So, it was fun for him to have some different options. He settled on the spice rubbed rib eye and he said the steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The chilaquiles were not that great, but I do give them props for making their own (some places just use store bought tortilla chips and enchilada sauce, bleh). Since we had about a 30 min wait for a table I had plenty of time to look at the menu and spent most of it deliberating between ordering French Toast or eggs. I am not a huge fan of eggs but we were about to get on the road back to Phoenix and I knew I needed some protein or else I would get hungry on the drive. Fortunately our waitress pointed out that if I ordered the French Toast I could add 2 eggs and a meat (sausage, bacon, or my choice turkey kielbasa) for only $3.50. So, that is what I did. It proved to be too much food for me but all of it was yummy so I didn't mind.

They were very short staffed that day but the service was still friendly and efficient. I would say the food was probably only 3 and a half stars but the cool atmosphere and staff rounded it up.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,1,1,4,wTjL47Kg68xF31dK9K03vQ

The food was flavorful, well-made, and the pot of bread will literally melt in your mouth. We ordered:

Rib Eye Steak and Chilaquiles: I have never had chilaquiles before and I seriously feel like i have been deprived my entire life. My steak was cooked perfectly the way I liked and the tortilla chips that were bathing in refried beans, scallions, and cotija cheese were the perfect accompaniment. 

Chicken and Waffles: savory & sweet at its finest! The chicken was not dry at all, it was not overly battered and the waffles had a slight crunch on the outside but soooo soft and perfect on the inside. The maple syrup that they served with them was warm and had sticks of cinnamon in them! YUM. 

Silver Dollar Pancakes with Strawberries: Our little guy devoured these. He especially loved the sprinkling of powdered sugar over top! I had a bite, and I must say, they are some of the best pancakes I have had. Perfectly light with a little bit of crispness around the edges. 

Our food was absolutely perfect and if they only served these three things, we would STILL come back on a regular basis. Although the food was delicious, our absolute favorite part of this place was our server, RYLEY!!! She has such an amazingly genuine and kind energy about her. She complimented us on our parenting and how well behaved our four year old was. (she is a nanny herself, so knows a thing or two about kiddos) In a world where there is so much negative criticism, she is such a breath of fresh air! Our food came out in a timely manner and i LOVED that she brought out our little guy's food first, which in the parenting world is a God-send. Even our little guy liked her. He drew her little hearts on the comment card that we turned in! We left there feeling so lighthearted and truly lucky to have been helped by such an awesome person.

We have come here twice before but the service and food has always been mediocre. Its been about 8 months since our last visit so we decided to give it a go because of location convenience Came in this morning, ordered a kids breakfast and two adult breakfasts. My side dish of eggs and bacon, they eggs were WAY smaller than the kids eggs. Found that odd. They also forgot to put the cheese on them. Mentioned it to our server and she offered to have it fixed and I declined since we were on a time schedule because my husband was having breakfast with us on his work lunch break. I go to pick up a piece of my bacon and there is hair on it.... I also noticed the cook having a long beard and instead of them making him shave it due to health violations and cleanliness and professionalism, they made him wear a net over it ..... really?

Our waitress was very apologetic. They removed the $4.50 side plate. Hair in someone's food is disgusting and should absolutely never ever happen. The fact that the manager sent her back with a $5 coupon and our discount check, and he didn't even have not only the balls or the respect to come over and apologize to us shows their lack of care and customer service. But really, what would he say? There's no excuse for hair in someone's food because the bottom line is that is a result of the not so cleanliness of their kitchen. And as a server myself it's just unacceptable the lack of customer service as well. 1 stars for our server being sweet and professional, I feel bad that her manager had no balls and made her continuously apologize to us. We gave our coupon to the table over. I will also be notifying the health district . As well as never returning

4641391,2011-07-11,2,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"I LOVE breakfast! And Rise & Shine far exceeded my expectations that fellow yelpers have laid out for me. Thank you once again Yelp for showing me a true gem in this hot, chain ridden unforgiving desert. Now on to the details...

At first glance Rise & Shine looks to be a very small nook of a restaurant at the corner of a nice new strip mall in Southern Highlands. And that's pretty much what it is. But don't let looks deceive you! This small nook has so much to offer. 

We were greeted by a tall gentleman in a blue striped shirt who sat us promptly at a booth facing the open kitchen. It almost seemed as if he was welcoming us into his home, so I assumed it was his establishment in some form or another. 

Our server followed to take our drink order, and say hi to the little mama, and we decided on the French Press Illy coffee (do not pass this up!) and some waters. She returned very quickly with our own personal French press, two mugs, a sand timer with three strengths, and some real cream (hallelujah). She explained the timer, took our order of Steak Chilaquiles, a Spinach Swiss Avocado Omelet, and two pots of bread, and whisked away in her cute paisley pjs. 

The coffee was divine after letting steep until just after the yellow timer ran out, then pressing with much anticipation... fresh, aromatic, strong!, and ours to pour as we wished. 

The pots of bread came out first as little mama was hungy, and was getting antsy, and the three of us shared in a blissful pulling and devouring of the light fluffy just barely there cinnamon bread with fresh jam and real butter. I could have eaten five of those pots by myself!

Then came our meals. I wish I could have taken pictures, but they lasted a whole millisecond after our server set them down before we dove in like hungry hyenas. The smell of fresh ingredients was overwhelming, and we were all foaming at the mouth!

Hubby's Steak Chilaquiles were unreal. Fresh tortilla chips smothered in refried beans and a slightly spicy sauce, with cheddar and cotija cheeses, then topped with two over medium eggs and avocado, and a whole dinner sized rib eye steak that was PERFECTLY seasoned, with a side of salsa and sour cream. Heaven! 

My omelet, while simple and unassuming, was perfection. Not too overly huge as some omelets in this town can be, not too overloaded with cheese, or grease from cheap cheese (uck!), but beautifully fluffy and balanced, topped with creamy green avocado. Fabulous! The potatoes were fantastic, and again perfectly seasoned, and didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce (as I usually drench restaurant taters in). 

Each plate was accompanied by a fresh fruit stack of strawberries pineapple and oranges, which little mama enjoyed so much, the tall man in the blue striped shirt came by and offered her more of, which she gleefully took and crammed more in her sweet face. 

All in all, this place was so pleasing, it is now our favorite breakfast joint in town hands down. We will be returning (more than likely next weekend!), often! Hurray YELP!",hZR7YvZK5KiJnF2b2YsrHQ,1,2,5,LUQODAaBA6wpS650LJPF4Q

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - I went with the smoke salmon and eggs Benedict. I'm always a huge fan of eggs Benedict but I wasn't a fan of this dish. The spinach didn't come cooked and that was a bit odd because everything else was hot. My friend ordered the ham and egg Benedict, and he said that his was delicious. He ate everything and the hash brown. He also ordered a side of sausage but was not a fan of that at all.

COT DAMN! I finally found  a breakfast spot here in LV that's worth  reviewing.  Coming from NYC breakfast is important.  This place is as good as it gets.  The hostess is super nice and cool.  The waitress is super nice and very attentive.  I ordered the XTRA protein breakfast.  The  cook kills it! Everything about this place is good.  I checked out the restroom and it's clean and  it has a slimming mirror.  Pajamas! They wear pajamas! How chill is that? 

I recommend to visit this place whether you are a local, a tourist, or just hangry like I was.  I saw check out the website before you come  so you can  set your target on your food and order ASAP!  And lastly, there is a big cock by the door and I'm not talking a rude  guy either.  It's so cool!

Food is BOMB
Restrooms are CLEAN

4677087,2015-06-04,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"First of all, I think it's important to say I have been a customer here since the restaurant opened. I am glad it is in our neighborhood, and I think it has the potential to be a cornerstone business in our area of Southern Highlands. I typically order breakfast to go for my family...the same things each time, as we aren't to adventurous in the morning. I really enjoy the selection, location, customer service, and portion sizes, but I have had problems with the consistency in the preparation of dishes from day one.

Some times, our meals are spot on, and other times they are a complete miss. It is a mystery ever time I open the containers as to what we will get. Don't get me wrong...if I order biscuits and gravy, that's what will be in the box. I just don't know if I will have three-day-old microwaved biscuits or fresh. Also, tossing 4 slices of banger sausage into gravy does not a sausage gravy make. Southerners beware, this is pretty far from authentic. Chicken fried steak is pretty awesome every time. Good crunch and spice...huge portion!

I will continue to eat here, because let's be honest...my hangover is not going to feed itself.",h1VQHY2R29ezRd2pn-Z5kQ,0,0,4,pCnd81r_f-2r5FxdA2sTiA

Only complaint is that the steak was overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. The rarest part of the steak looked medium well. Although it was over cooked. It was a pretty tender piece of steak. But if the steak is the main part of the meal, the cooks need to be more attentive to that. Selling point is the steak. Not the hash browns, biscuits, eggs, etc.... service wasn't too bad either.

Parking: lots
Dinning area: inside-large, ok clean, they wipe each utensil after it's washed and dried, they clean all condiment at the end of day, a little loud, lots of talking, if you are trying do romantic, maybe sit outside (but can be windy at times). Cute flower umbrellas hanging from ceiling (some are twirling)

She came back with our drinks and then took our order. They were out of the pot of bread which was really dissapointing as that was one of the reasons why I wanted to go back there, my husband ordered the spiced rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles and I had the ham and eggs benedict. His order was ok, the steak was great however my eggs benedict was utterly dissapointing! One egg was poached perfectly and the other was basically a fried hard boiled egg! I have NEVER seen that before. The waitress was nice enough to take it back and bring me a brand new dish. By then it was a little too late. It wasn't just our table that had issues but other tables as well. We even witnessed one of the hostesses ask another customer who had been waiting for a table for 45 minutes if they would like to continue waiting or if they would like to leave. Why would a hostess even ask that? If they were still waiting wouldn't that mean they want to stay?

Decor is weird.  

Sunflower umbrellas hang upside down, mosaic tiles of birds and stuff, generic diner style upholstered booths.  Waitresses in pajamas.  Weird, weird, weird but there's a line out the door at 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday, so I'm in.  

We put our name on the list and proceed to wait.  

There's chaos everywhere.  

A waitress shouts, ""Son of a bitch"" from the beverage station, and then looks up, realizing everyone is staring at her, and then it's back to business as usual.  One patron complains to the girl at the register and there seems to be a lot of high tension.  

We opt for two seats at the counter and I can't help but think of Anthony Bourdain and Kitchen Confidential as I watch these swarthy, kitchen pirates, working as fast as they can with large, sizzling grills full of pancakes, a mountain of hash browns, seared steaks and a deep fryer.  The smells are intoxicating.  

We start with ""Pot of Bread.""  This is a soft, warm, cinnamon roll baked in a demitasse cup.  Delicious!

On to the main event...it took 40 minutes to get our food and we drooled anxiously as we watched every plate come up.  I had the biscuits and gravy.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and served over an obscene pile of some of the best, chopped, hash browns I've ever eaten.  Gravy was salty and chunky and homemade.  Biscuits were soft and dense, just perfect.  

Husband had the basic bacon and eggs and the generous portion of bacon was so fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked.  

Then came the pancakes. Oh my goodnight nurse, this was pancake heaven!  

We were just talking about some disappointing pancakes we ate at the Aria cafe the morning before.  I mean, they were fine. They were warm and sweet and sort of fluffy.  But what was missing was that extra depth of flavor and a crisp exterior.  

These pancakes at Rise and Shine are almost like a donut, with a thin, crisp crunch on a perfectly golden cake.  The flavor has texture and depth from buttermilk and the syrup has a cinnamon stick in it, which just adds another nice layer of taste.  We could not get through half of our entrees but we for sure took it all home in boxes to enjoy the next day.

I am thankful the busser grabbed our orange juices, but it was disheartening to see so many walk by and see us still sitting without drinks without checking up on us. I eventually grabbed the busser and asked for drinks. I know we can get tunnel vision in this industry, especially toward the end of the day, but servers are what make or break repeat customers.

The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and eggs and that steak was magical. So tender and juicy. I haven't had a good steak like that in a while. I also ordered the caramel iced coffee, that was amazing as well.

4958075,2013-12-22,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"We arrived at Rise and Shine around 10:00 on Sunday morning.  It was already full.  I'm glad we arrived when we did, because within 5 minutes (no exaggeration) there was a 25-30 minute wait.  And, people stayed.  So, given that the regulars were willing to wait a half hour, I figured we were going to enjoy a solid breakfast.

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  I chose the pot of bread, which was brought out early as an appetizer of sorts.  It was warm, and the butter served alongside was room temperature, so spreading was easy.  l liked the cinnamon flavor in the bread, but I think I would have preferred some toast or a biscuit with my meal rather than this bread prior.  The steak itself is a good size, and thick for a chicken fried steak.  This was an issue, as some of the areas were not as tender as I prefer.  I think the meat needed more tenderizing prior to preparation.  Also, it did not appear to be seasoned.  If the meat had seasoning prior to breading, even just some salt and pepper, it would really elevate this dish.  That being said, it was very good, particularly with the tasty sausage gravy.  

The accompanying scrambled eggs were very fluffy.  They were fluffy to the point that they stand out among just about every other place I've ordered eggs in this town.  You get a substantial order of potatoes, which were above average.  I ordered them well done, and was glad I did.  My wife's order had barely any color on them, and I prefer them crunchy.

Servers wear pajamas and were very friendly, which was great.  My tea glass got close to empty once, but she was right there with a refill.  Excellent service overall.  Will we return?

The Husband celebrated his birthday last weekend and they brought out a chocolatey fudgey pancake topped with whipped cream and sprinkles and of course, a candle.  The Little Gal ended up eating just about the whole thing, which we were super pleased about.  And the Little Guy proclaimed we should celebrate all birthdays here! (This was actually the third time we've eaten here, but the second time we celebrated a birthday.)

On my last two visits, I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash & Eggs.  It comes with three eggs your way and a pot of bread, toast or biscuit.  Their corned beef hash has quite a bit of potato in it, and it's pretty yummy.  I'm glad I ordered it again and ate it all up. I chose the pot of bread this time and it reminded me of a cinnamon roll with the frosting dip on the side.

The Husband ordered the Lox & Cream Cheese Omelette.  He was a bit surprised to see the lox just sitting on the top of the omelette when he expected it to be folded in somehow.  He liked the dijon-cream cheese that was on there and needed to request more though.

Service was good the last two times we went, especially when we had Christine.  I just remember her being an awesome waitress who was super attentive, personable and energetic.  She was also quite efficient too!   

I will admit that our very first visit was years and years ago.  I don't remember how the service was then, but did remember (I started a review a long time ago.) what we ate then. We ordered the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel, Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles, and Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak. The eggs were more medium when we ordered them over easy.  The steak wasn't very flavorful despite it being spice rubbed.  I realized I was looking for some kind of sauce to dip the steak in.  The chicken fried steak was also huge.  The pot of bread was good then, but a bit under baked since it was still doughy.

Our last two visits this year was a better experience than our very first time.  It wasn't necessarily bad then, it was just okay.  They are obviously doing well since it's busy and they have a second location.  There's usually a wait on the weekends, but we arrive later than most so it's not too long.  The decor is adorable inside.

First of all I want to thank, April, our waitress. She was great! Also, I wanted to thank Yelp for helping me find this place. It is a hidden Gem outside the Vegas Strip. This place IS the BEST breakfast place in Vegas. 

Customer Service: 5 stars - everyone is super friendly with big smiles. The manager does come around and sees how everyone is doing.

Atmosphere/decor: cute and very clean. Also in the back of everyone's T-shirts except the waitresses, its say, ""help us by Yelping us"" or something like that. I thought that was really cute and they found out I was a Yelp Elite. LOL

Food: 1000 STARS!! 

I really love this place. We called ahead to see if they take reservations but they don't. But I understood when I got there. Luckily when we went on Sunday morning, it wasn't packed and we got seated right away. The prices is decent for what you get. It was $50 for a group of 4. If you went to IHOP you would have paid MORE and got crappy food. I saw some reviews saying how it is a bit expensive, when you think about it, Denny's and IHOP is about the same if not more. For steak at those places it would be MINIMUM $20 per place. Here - LESS then $15! that is a STEAL! 

Okay, since I got all that out of my way, here is what we ordered:

The Pot of Bread was AMAZING! MUST ORDER!! Honestly, it was the best bread I ever had. It came out piping hot and just perfect. It wasn't too sweet but wasn't plain. The bread was very fresh and soft. 
The chicken and Waffles was very yummy! The portion was REALLY big and enough to share. I was very impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and was perfectly crispy. It had a small kick of spice in it and it was perfect. The Waffles was nice and fluffy. I am not a Waffle fan but I LOVED IT! honestly fell in love with this place. 
-The ULTIMATE Steak and Egg Breakfast: the steak came out perfectly well seasoned and very tender. I loved it. It was just delicious. The Hash browns potatoes that came with it was a bit soggy. We thought it would come out more crispy then soft.
-New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel - I didn't order it but I had a piece. It was delicious also! The Spinach went really well with the steak. 

Thank you Rise and Shine for the great experience. I will be back every time I go to Vegas. I just wished you opened up another one over here in Southern California. That would be a GREAT investment.",WC2vra21_G9eORjwFq41pQ,6,3,5,rFK2yXQaq-poEOYj0Mz_dA

Our server told us to take all the time we need and we never once felt like we were keeping anyone from going home.  Our experience was super relaxed.  The management was incredibly accommodating and pleasant.

The food we delicious and very much to our liking.

We sat near where they toasted the bread. Here's my complaint... some of the girls that handled the toast did not use gloves, tongs or even paper while handling the bread. This visit I watched all the waitresses and waiter make their toast, there was 3 girls in particular that used their bare hands the entire time and served the bread straight to their tables that way.... uh... GROSS! But kudos to the ones that did use the tongs and didn't use their bare hands. I have been in the food industry for a while and cross contamination this is a big no no for me. 

Here's my experience on the 2nd visit. Thank God It wasn't busy, we were seated right away. Our server was ON POINT this visit. Very friendly and thorough with our order, used tongs with our toast (5 stars for him!) and he checked on us every now and then if we needed anything without being annoying. Lol Before he served us our plates, he had gloves on putting all the finishing touches to our plate. He made this visit worth coming back. Thank you Gilbert for the excellent service!!! Hopefully we can ask for him all the time. 

I love how the staff is dressed in their pajamas. It really does fit the name for Rise and Shine. Love the flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling too! In my opinion, the price is a lil high for the food BUT.... you are paying for the experience and someone is cooking you a great meal. 5 stars to the Chefs for making me the steak, avocado and mushroom/spinach omelette. My food was cooked to perfection. The food actually tasted better since they weren't crazy busy. I don't even eat hash browns but man.... it was seasoned well and had the crisp to it, I ate it and that's rare! On yelp, I kept seeing everyone post the Cup of Bread and of course.... it was delicious! I think everyone should order that when they come to visit this place.

5042140,2013-08-26,0,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"This weekend was crazy!  Last night was a night full of libations and great friends.  This morning I woke up on my best friend's couch with an appetite.  I was told a little gem was right around the corner and that I really needed to try it out.  Why not?  It's time to grub!

The strip mall in Southern Highlands is such a wonderful mall with a lot of different businesses.  Restaurants, hair salons, gyms, you name it.  Very delightful.  Rise & Shine was located in the southwest corner of the strip mall next to Tropical Smoothie Café.  When we got out of the car, we saw a few families waiting outside, so I knew it was going to be good.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.  When you walk into this place, you are instantly taken to a whimsical story book.  The exposed air ducts are distracted by hanging umbrellas shaped and pictured like spring flowers.  The subtle orange and lime green walls are decorated with huge cow pictures.  The floor to almost ceiling windows are bordered by decorated clay mosaic-type arrangement.  This place is cute!  Our server's name was Lisa.  From the moment she greeted us, she was nothing but amazing!  Such an inviting personality and she really took the time to make sure our experience was top notch.  I LOVED HER!!

For starters, I got the fresh squeezed orange juice for $3.25 and the cup of coffee for $2.85.  Coffee was standard, however the OJ was out of this world!  Fresh squeezed is the only way to go!  You could tell it was authentic.  Not only was there pulp, there were also seeds in my drink!  LOVED IT!  For my meal, it was such a hard decision, but I decided with the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel for $13.50.  NY steak done the way you like it, over butter toasted bagel, topped with two eggs any-style, fresh spinach between the steak and bagel, hollandaise all over the place and hash brown potatoes.  OH-EM-GEE!!  I got the steak medium rare (the ONLY way to get it) and the eggs poached (duh, it's a Benedict!).  The steak was cooked perfectly with nice char marks.  The bagel served multiple purposes.  Not only did it create the Benedict, it soaked up any juices from the steak and hollandaise.  The spinach offered a light, crisp texture to the dish.  The hash browns were cut in big strips and cooked amazingly.  Browned with a crunch, but not dark enough to be considered burnt.  You break the yolk from the egg and mix it with the hollandaise sauce and it completely ties the dish together.  Hollandaise is not too lemony and not to runny.  On the top, they drizzle a little balsamic glaze which offered a slightly sweet and tangy element.  This dish was AH-MAZE-ING and I will highly recommend it to anyone!  

You guys, this place was out of this world!  So worth the wait, so worth the future drives (I live close to Boulder City).  I kept telling my best friends that this place was the perfect end to an epic weekend.  I truly believe it and think you need to stop reading this already and get your butt to Rise & Shine!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,2,1,5,NDk6f24yD5kjwRubCz8mvw

The place is absolutely cute with their huge flowers spinning from the ceiling and the servers in their pajamas.  This is one of my favorite spots to do breakfast on the weekends.   Everyone I bring here raves about the place too. 
 
The food is really good.  Some of the notable things I've had here include:
 
- Chicken Fried Steak (Thick and delicious gravy.  Steak might be a little too thickly battered.  Feel a little guilty eating it =)  Tasty hash browns on the side)

- Two Egg Breakfast (Think grand slam, but much tastier!  Not crazy about the kielbasa, so I'll stick with the sausage or bacon next time)

- Corned Beef Hash (Not like the smushy corned beef - its ""real""!)

- Southwest Turkey Panini (Panini's here seem like a good option for lunch!)

- And always get their cute little pot of bread! (A light and fluffy Cinnamon roll - Yum!)
 
Like everyone else says, the service here is good.  Always kind with a smile.  I wouldn't say the food is OMG, but its solid.  Prices might be a tiny bit on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it for the lovely experience",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,9,8,4,k1hhI9EQt34hlqvbufGhJA
5056686,2011-01-22,1,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"This is THE BEST kept secret in Las Vegas. Almost debated on reviewing, so I could be selfish and KEEP it a secret, but it was so good, I have to give the owners props. 

Here are all the reasons this place deserves MORE than 5 stars.

- Came at 10am on a Saturday and everyone was friendly. We actually had no wait, but I think that was more luck :) But it's still a positive in my book.
- Bread in a Pot. Delicious cinnamon swirled bread that was soft and buttery. Almost like a croissant... warm and came with whipped butter and strawberry jam. TO DIE FOR!!!
- My Man got the filet wrapped in bacon with eggs - cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, and you could tell it wasn't just cooked properly but that this place orders high quality ingredients.
- I got the chicken fried steak and eggs, and WHOA, the outside was cooked so crispy, and flavorful. Had a little spice kick to it which made it even better. Eggs cooked perfectly. 
- The side of potatoes were seasoned like an expect would. Not too salty, full of flavor. I don't like ketchup, and at other places I always end up with bland hash browns that need flavor and ketchup is the obvious choice but these tasted excellent plain. TWO thumbs up!!
- They serve illy coffee, and it is so good. Much better than typical diner coffee. It was refilled without me asking - another thumbs up!
- The server was friendly and cheery but not TOO cheery if you know what I mean 
- 3/4 through our meal, the owner stopped by. I think this is what tipped the review. He was friendly, and I LOOOOOOVE when someone in charge stops by your table. They should come by when things are good and bad, and not just when there is a customer complaint. He truly wanted to see how everything was, and it was very personable. Obviously we raved about the place to him, and I can't say enough what a great first impression it gave us.
- My man is an executive chef, and even he said this is the best place we have EVER had breakfast (totally exceeds Hash House, Egg & I, Cracked Egg, or ANY OTHER PLACE)

I quickly yelp'd around the nearest breakfast places and found these guys. The pot of bread seemed like a unique idea and the photos looked great! 

Arrived at around 830am. Quaint little place in a shopping plaza. Loved how the servers wear Jammies (must be the best work uniform ever).

Decor: simple. I honestly do not remember anything that stuck out besides the turning floral umbrellas on the ceiling and the ""cow and egg"" advertisement on the wall. 

Orange juice: to my surprise, freshly squeezed.

Dads steak and eggs: steak was very tender and eggs cooked to a perfectly requested sunny side up. 

The hash: very unique. They look like flat pasta noodles cut in smaller segments. It tasted very fresh with a perfect crunch. 

My chicken fried steak: my steak was also very flavorful and tender. It was paired with a delicious gravy. I am not a big chicken fried steak fan but damn, this was good. 

Husband's chicken and waffle: the portion size was good. Nicely breaded chicken breast with a waffle. Chicken was tender and juicy despite being fried. 

Their pot of bread became 'tea cup bread' when we visited. It did not look too appealing since the shape was funky and some overfilled the cup. However, they were nice and warm out of the oven and very, very delicious. Dad and I are not fans of sweet bread but this was perfectly flavored with cinnamon and a bit of sweetness. Butter and tea cup bread for the win!

Pricing: a bit higher than your normal breakfast restaurant but hey, you're paying for fresh food. Totally worth it!

I am very glad our hotel decided to cancel their breakfast buffet because we got to experience something new and not your usual Vegas meal :)

I would definitely recommend and return at my next trip!!",EtaJMHr1Df_8B9ODxhqhvQ,3,0,5,4w2BIqKE6Pd-Esivv7Ga_g

It would be so nice to walk to weekend brunch but can't say I'll do that because this place isn't that good. I'd rather drive somewhere with better prices and better food. The chilaqules were the best thing that we had. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was horrible. Cold, dry, thin and stale texture. The chicken was good but not great. I didn't like their maple syrup, it had cinnamon in it and with chicken? Yuck. I ended up pulling it off and eating it alone. I asked for blue cheese dressing so I could salvage my meal and dip the chicken in it and all they had was cheap bottles ranch style dressing. The service was the worst part of the whole experience.

As of late, the quality of food isn't the same.  I've always replaced hashbrowns with fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and bananas), and the serving has always been generous.  The past 2 times they've put the fruit in the smallest dish, almost like a dish that you usually get syrup in.  It's been about 1/4 of what I used to get.  Then today, first thing this morning, they ran out of bananas.  
I don't believe their eggs are organic anymore, they're just different!  I don't mind spending the extra money for quality, but it's just not quality.  Also, they recently changed the coffee, and my husband doesn't care for it at all.

5156355,2011-08-25,2,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"I have some odd, unexplained affinity for brunch. Something about eating eggs yet not having to wake so early for them gets me excited. As much as I love brunch, my brother outshines me in this respect tenfold. Every time I leave the house for it or come home from it, he seems to always criticize my choice in restaurant - usually exclaiming ""What about Rise & Shine? They're so much better"". Well David S., I finally tried them, and jesus! Why didn't I listen to you before?

A coworker and I decided to catch up over some brunch (she, too, shares my love for breakfast foods at normal people hours). After wavering in between this place and another establishment, we finally just took my brother's advice. The service was a bit slow at first, but was amazing once it picked up. Our waitress, Nicole (I believe that's her name) was so sweet and very attentive. Usually, I always gulp four glasses of water prior to the start of any meal. She was on top of her game - making conversation and filling our waters promptly.

To the food, we had both ordered the Baked Blueberry Croissant French Toast. When it came out, I think we were both about to die. This dish is not for the faint of heart or those struck with blueberry indifference. Literally, the dish was unrecognizable underneath the mound of blueberries. What croissant are you talking about? If that wasn't enough, there's a ramekin of the same blueberry sauce on the side! Jesus. One bite in, and I was in love. The blueberry sauce, candied walnuts, and croissant were euphoric. Not overtly sweet, just tart enough, with the perfect crunch and nuttiness of the walnuts. The portion is perfect for the price. I ended up taking half of it home in order to both save my waistline and taunt my brother by affecting his.

We had meandered a bit afterwards, inflicted with the pains of a food coma. Multiple people, other than our waitress, had stopped by for lively banter and to check up on the meal. Management was positively delightful - so genuinely sweet without any schmooze. 

Weeks later, I still feel somewhat guilty. Indulgence at its best is definitely what you'll find here. Unfortunately for me, the only occasion I can bring myself to come back here for will be my birthday - my waistline will thank me.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,2,3,5,8CF-eqAGE83QZ17Pb_6kWA

It's amazing this place runs like it does considering its owner was a big strip vp of f and b with Caesars corp. There is zero leadership in this place. Absent owner. 

Arrive. Dirty tables everywhere; but have to wait 15 minutes for a table. It's Sunday folks staff accordingly. Finally seated. Menus are laminated; all of the laminated corners are peeling back and dirty. 

Server shows up after we sit for 10 minutes and says sorry I will be back. 5 minutes later takes a drink order. Cloudy old iced tea. Gross. No sweet and low on table. Had to ask for it. 

We order our food. Takes 15 minutes. We watch as dirty tables around us sit dirty for up to 20 minutes as they have a wait list. What a shame. 

Ordered chicken sandwiches. Comes out with what looks like a 3-4oz half chicken breast on a big bun. Hardly sized properly to fill the bun. Plate smoking hot with the lettuce and tomato sitting directly on the hot plate. Now cooked and wilted. Comes with nothing? No mayo? Nothing?? Fries cold and a very small portion. Embarrassing. Asked for mayo to put on the sandwich. Also ordered a French onion soup. Came out with our sandwiches rather than before. Soup had so much thyme in it......tasted like a beef broth thyme soup. Gross. Went to get ketchup from the condiment caddy and it was empty. 

This place is dirty. Lacks the basics. Server was scatter-brained. No management presence. Bussers moving at a snails pace. Cooks eating behind the line. We rode our bikes to lunch. When leaving we saw two servers out back smoking. One was our server. Now I know why she was not around and why we waited so long. Wonder if she washed her hands. 

I guess three times is a charm. We want this place to be great because it's so close. Not again. Shame on you owner; you know better.",325vaaxZ6ZxUIlPGQHLSeQ,0,0,1,IdiY4nBsJ3TVp97NXpq_yg

This was my first time eating here, although I had popped in once about 5 years ago and had a bite of a friend's steak:  it was delicious.

They were busy, but not packed, and we were seated right away.
Our server was very sweet, and very patient, as it took us a while to decide on what we wanted to try.  

I had the New York Steak, Spinach, and Benedict Bagel which came with potted bread, and my fella had the Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles, also with potted bread. We both had a tea and a coffee as well. 

So. 
Potted bread.  This was like a sweet, warm cinnamon bun in a little mug served with butter.  You really don't *need* the butter, its that good on its own, but the butter was tasty too.  I'd go back and order just this...a few of them.  They were awesome. 

When our breakfasts arrived, I was thrilled with mine.  It looked amazing, and tasted even better!  The steak was cooked to perfection: mid-rare, and seasoned beautifully.  The poached eggs had a lovely runny yolk, and the hollandaise was not too rich.  The spinach gave it a nice touch, and while I didn't really eat all of the bagel, it was delicious, and perfect for sopping up the yolk and juices from the steak. 

My fella's Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles LOOKED amazing.  I, unfortunately, was unable to try any, due to an avocado allergy.  We had asked for them to make it without avocado, but it came out with it on top.  My fella doesn't like avocado, but isn't allergic, so he just scraped it off, and our server apologized about it.  I was bummed that I didn't get to try it, but maybe next time. He really enjoyed it a lot, and the steak was great.  (that was on the side, no avocado!)

Really, the only reasons for the missing star is the avocado, and the fact that for a plain cup of coffee, and a plain bag of Earl Grey tea, it is $2.85 a piece.  That's a little steep for just brewed coffee and a tea bag, if you ask me, especially when we were never offered refills.  Honestly though, its not a huge deal, or a deal breaker, because the food was so delicious, and there was SO much of it!  

I have every intention to come back to Rise and Shine for breakfast again.  They have a good sized menu that I look forward to testing out!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,3,4,Od4cG9btyGEJmiMkNjwnBQ

The decor is absolutely adorable - hanging flowers are all over the place and the wait staff wears really cute pajamas - love it! 

The food we tried was all very good. My husband had the blueberry french toast strudel . It was like a slice of a delicious casserole. If you're in the mood  for sweet but not disgustingly so, I recommend this! We also tried the chicken and waffles which was good, especially if you haven't had Roscoe's. It was much, much better than the one at HHAGG, and at this point the best I've had in Vegas. It was a big chicken breast instead of fried chicken which did make it much easier to eat. The waffle was pretty boring, but well executed. The chicken was a touch spicy, and the whole thing was served with cinnamon syrup. I would get it again, but I can't say it's crave-worthy. 

Biggest bummer about this place was service was a disaster. Drinks were late and forgotten, the pot of bread supposed to be served prior to the meal was brought after, etc, etc. They all seemed very rushed and stressed out. Given how brand new this place is, they get a pass, but I would hope the service improves in the future!

Even the hash browns which I'm really not normally a fan of....was so delicious that I almost finish the whole thing!  I have a rule of generally not visiting the same place twice in a trip I would stop here again and have order the same exact items again and stuff my face! love this place but it gets busy.,UR0BtHwg_OFLw3Ll9c8RWA,0,0,5,j-cu1Lezvow6X4PEX6SLdQ

I was excited to try this place because my boyfriend has been raving about the red velvet pancakes ever since he came here with a group of friends a while back. We finally made it to Vegas together and made this one of our foodie destination. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs which were very salty. I got the biscuits and gravy which were good but not the best I've ever had. We also got a stack of the red velvet pancakes. Now those were great especially with the cream cheese icing. The service however was very subpar. We only got our drinks refilled one time as we were leaving and our plates had already been cleared away.

Illy Coffee with refills

Always on the lookout for a great local breakfast spot and already in Henderson for business reasons I decided to make my way over to ""Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place"" largely based on the fact that anyone willing to go out on a limb and sport the website www.bestbreakfastvegas.com clearly warrants judgment; my verdict suggesting blatant false advertising.  Featuring a kitschy design with floral umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and servers in their pajamas plus a menu of breakfast and lunch classics ranging from classic egg dishes to more novel options such as red velvet pancakes service was spot on despite the early morning rush and with my order placed within moments of seating coffee and water remained filled to the brim at all times.  With good service and fun décor it was my hope that the food at Rise & Shine would indeed shine but perhaps because I didn't order ""Steak & Eggs"" the selections I tasted were average at best, the sort of place where big portions trump high quality ingredients - the chicken crispy but largely flavorless over a hotel lobby quality waffle and the pot of bread tasting mostly like yeast, something that Log Cabin 'syrup' and butter did not remedy.  Better in quality but still marred by low quality ingredients the French Toast would fare the best of the morning's options but given the location and the cost I can name no less than a dozen restaurants more deserving of the 'best breakfast vegas' title.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,0,2,B9d2QIBTbgINJi6GLceVKA

Their chicken and waffles is nowhere near Roscoe's quality, but it's a close second. Definitely the best in Vegas. Can't complain about the portion size either. The pot of bread is definitely not what I expected. I thought it'd just be a roll type of bread but I was wrong. To my surprise, it was more like a Cinnabon! And it looks small but it's still pretty filling. 

The servers and hostesses were extremely friendly as well. Our server was sweet and gladly answered any questions I had about the menu. Not to mention, they're all dressed in pajamas which makes the place even better lol.

The reason why I have this place 4 out of 5 starts is because of the steak and eggs I ordered, which were also talked highly about on Yelp reviews. Personally I didn't see what the big deal was. I've had better tasting steak and eggs at Southpoint during their late night specials. The size of the steak was decent but the flavor was eh.

Looked at the menu and with so many steak&eggs options,didn't really knew what to go for. Luis(our server) was knowledgeable and recommend us the Ryb eye . Also explained what cup-a-bread was and at first i said meh..maybe not. But he was so excited about it that i went for it. Great choice ! (They warm it up too)

We went on a Friday late morning had no wait at all.  But it was pretty full at that hour so I would imagine weekends would have a wait.  There was very little space to sit and wait inside, so I'm glad we didn't get stuck waiting out in the heat :)

First of all, you HAVE to get the pot of bread as your accompanying starch.  Holy crap, it is freaking awesome!  It's a biscuit and a cinnamon roll smashed together and then baked in a coffee cup.  Slather it with some butter and you're in heaven.

I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was a gamble since I'm from Texas and have a pretty high bar.  It was SO good!  Really tender with a delicious coating!  Only complaint is that the coating didn't adhere very well to the steak but that's really just a quibble :)  It came with eggs and cream pepper gravy, yum yum!  I also got one of their smoothies which took forever to come out, but it was really delicious.

My husband order the rib eye chilaquiles and it was just as good as some of the ones we've gotten in Mexico.  We were super impressed!

The decor was a bit hokey but cute.  They have flower umbrellas inverted and hanging from the ceiling.  It helped transform the location from a strip mall to something more inviting.  

Finally, the service was super attentive and prompt.

The food here is pretty pricey. The least expensive thing you'll find is the burger that is about $8 or $9. The rest, is $10 and up.

I think I speak for Bun and I, the hash browns were amazing. Thinly sliced potatoes with just the right amount of taste to it. The pot of bread, nomz, cinnamon bread rolled up into a cup -- it's popular and around 1pm, they were also gone!

However, the food, it was meh. And combined paying about $30 for just a brunch, we'll be back but not too frequently. My chicken fried steak, I've had better and would say Egg Works makes it more nomz.

I admire when people refuse to allow themselves to become complacent with a good menu. Besides the gentleman that greeted and seated us, the rest of the staff were also pleasant. 

Today was my birthday and it was a fitting place to celebrate. Although most of the festivities will be tomorrow, this relaxing brunch made my day. When I think of festive eats, I go all out. I had ordered the chicken and waffle. When I first cut into the waffle, I was a bit disappointed. It lacked the crunch that I normally love, but after thinking it over, I can understand why they lean towards this style. The chicken is moist, crispy and seasoned to perfection. Having a more cake like waffle gives contrast in texture and soaks up the maple syrup better. You will be dousing your dish in this warm condiment. It is outstanding. The maple syrup alone deserves five stars. The steak and eggs are also delectable. The 8oz cut is marbled well with just enough fat to keep the meat moist and tender. The eggs have a clean flavor that does not need any salt. The potatoes were soft like mashed potatoes on the inside, but had a crunchy outer layer that was nice. Nothing on this plate needed ketchup or steak sauce. We ordered the pot of bread with this meal and it was gone just as soon as it hit the table. The jam was filled with huge chunks of strawberries, but was quite sweet.

Rise and Shine would be perfect if only it offered some lighter fares. On special occasions, like today, I am willing to go crazy on my caloric intake.

The food was actually very good except the tiny missteps of eggs and mocha and that didn't really have anything to do with taste in the long run.",Tq_ofamB56cLtUsVLbx1Cw,0,0,5,clLAny25DGWl5QFYkvpFHQ

The service is always good. The fact that everyone is wearing pajamas gives the place a nice feel. A man who I believe is the owner interacts with customers on a regular basis in a very friendly way.

Now, the food. Admittedly, I haven't had a huge sampling of the menu. The reason for this is that once I tried the fried chicken and waffles, there was really no reason to do much in the way of exploring. The chicken is pounded before it's fried so it fits perfectly on top of the waffle. It also has a nice peppery thing going on. Not only is it delicious but it's more ""convenient"" to eat than chicken and waffles where the chicken still has the bone in it.

Also, they have some kind of English sausages there. Those things are also awesome.",6jQo4-rmGAl1wUoRdCgl0A,0,0,5,NI_CIozpMWBQqKFGxgvFrA

5500353,2015-09-12,1,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"I love this place! My boyfriend isn't as big of a breakfast food fan as I am, but when I told him this place is known for their steak and eggs, we knew we had to come.

There was a wait when we came on a Sunday morning. They said it would take approximately 45-50 minutes. It was 100+ degrees that day, so we killed some time at the smoothie shop next door.

When we sat down, I realized that the servers were all wearing pajamas. I love that concept!

In terms of the food we went crazy tried:
1. Crispy fried chicken breast and waffle
Dark meat is generally better than white meat. However, this fried chicken breast was the best I have ever tried. The breast is absolutely moist, and the outside is super crispy. The waffle was amazing, too. It's perfectly crispy on the outside, and it's the perfect medium between sweet and savory. I love the cinnamon maple syrup, which also comes with the pot of bread, and is served heated.
2. Bacon wrapped tender steak
My boyfriend got this with hash browns. It was good, but not the best. The bacon was overwhelmed the steak. I think next time he'll probably just order the ultimate steak and egg breakfast or the chicken fried NY steak.
3. Pot of bread
For both of our entrees we ordered the pot of bread. It came with jam, butter, and a warm cinnamon maple syrup. It was basically a cinnamon roll, but I loved how they came freshly baked.
4. Side of corned beef hash
The hash browns, while good, are 100 times better with the corned beef hash, which is one of the best corned beef hash breakfasts I have tried. It's salty, but not too much. 
5. Side of country sausage gravy
I typically order gravy with my chicken and waffles, so I had to try their country sausage gravy. It's good, but not necessary because the chicken and waffles is so amazing themselves.

It's my favorite breakfast place in Vegas, and probably better than most of the places I go to in the South Bay.",qJgae_Bqpwx1qm8-bXA_cA,1,1,5,En2IvEERckGoGjVUW2gbqA

Light and super savory. It was like eating cake. Cake that had an awesome cream cheese syrup! 

Krys also mentioned that the Country Fried Steak was life changing, she was right! The Country Fried Steak is the best I've ever had hands down! I'm a big fan of Cracker Barrel and Rise and Shine just blew it out of the water! The steak was so tender with a light coat of breading that has a hint of spice.

The best part is, I don't have to wait forever to get a table like those dumb suckers that wait for an hour at Babycakes for crappy food.  Every time I have been there, on a weekend, I have always gotten a table very quickly.

The reason why I love this spot is that they have totally focused only on breakfast, and with a carefully crafted menu, in executing it flawlessly.  You can tell with every dish, that much thought went into how to prepare it.  And the waitresses in pajamas, how awesome is that?     I really appreciate the love that went into this place, so much that I want to give the owner a hug.

The first time we went, my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  While this is not kobe beef steak, it is cooked extraordinarily well, especially for a breakfast joint.  The steak is juicy and flavorful and contrasts perfectly with the eggs.  He has also ordered the chicken fried steak and while that was extremely heavy, he loved it and said it was the best he's had since he was a kid in Montana, where apparently that type of dish is extremely common.

I have tried the chicken and waffles and a veggie omelet.  The chicken, just like the steak, was cooked perfectly.  And even more impressive than the steak, they managed to keep the chicken completely juicy, warm, and flavorful.  But the waffles were even better.  They were completely soft and almost pancake-like, and extremely fluffy.  I normally don't like waffles because they tend to be so heavy, but they managed to capture the flavor of waffles in a way that did not make me want to sleep for the next 10 days.  They also were topped with a cinnamon maple syrup which was totally memorable.

So if you are looking for the best breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further than Rise & Shine.  They may not be open the entire day, and their menu may be limited in scope, but what they do they do extremely well, and every time I go I am even more impressed with their consistent quality of food and service.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,5,5,5,73__AiIfXfXtAP7GmvmJmg

Anyhow, I got a kids meal steak and eggs while my patnah got the chicken fried steak.  I wasn't starvin' Marvin, but needed to get something in my stomach, pronto.  It was 10ish, so decided to keep it small.  Its still a nice portion if you ask me.

The steak was done as requested, medium rare, with fresh made hash browns served on a hot skillet.  I threw in a cup of French onion soup for good measure.  The steak was not overly seasoned which I prefer to get that true steak flavor.  The soup was piping hot and came in a stoneware cup.  Its hard to find good FOS, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Not the best I ever had like Drake kinda good, but not bad at all.

Most of the other dishes are pretty generous, unfortunately, the prices aren't.  I would suggest sharing if you are not a breakfast gorger like most of us.  The prep and way the food is served is legit though.  I like how the menu is simply one page, but it can get difficult to find certain dishes.  

The ambiance is nice and quiet and spacious as well.

We live in the neighborhood and have been frequenting this place for over a year now. First and foremost, I dare you to try and get an order of eggs over medium! It can't happen. Either the staff doesn't listen or the cooks just can't cook. On our last two and final visits, the steak on both occasions was cross contaminated with some sort of fish product, perhaps salmon or lox I don't know,  and tasted like a salt lick and if you're not familiar with that it's for farm animals. 

On our very last visit I order the loco moco special. The hamburger patty was so undercooked it was completely raw and I don't know that i will ever be able to eat hamburger again. The eggs were so undercooked they were runny after being asked for over medium, which has happened time after time. Eating here has turned into a bad experience. Not to mention our breakfast was over $44 for two people; steak and eggs and loco moco. It's absurd. We don't intend to ever go back.

The girls at the front were lovely as well. Unfortunately, that is where it all the positive points end for me. I was given a napkin with a fork and knife rolled inside, which is standard for most breakfast spots. When I picked the bundle up to unroll it I SEE AN OBVIOUS SMEAR OF BLOOD ACROSS THE NAPKIN!!! I quietly alert our waitress and she says ""OHH!! OPPS!! WOW!! Let me take that."" She brought me a new set and nothing else was said or mentioned again. No manager, shift supervisor, janitor - ZERO. Blood on a napkin served to a patron is pretty serious if I remember correctly, like a health code violation serious. I try to move on with my meal, I personally only ordered a yogurt parfait. When it arrives I notice it was made upside-down. Yes, that sounds silly and petty but when you have a slender glass making it upside-down gives you about 1 or 2 strawberries max and 3 thin slices of a banana. Then the entire thing was soaked in honey (my fault, I should have asked for that on the side.). We also ordered an egg white omelette. They didn't make it with egg whites. The pancakes were overly sweet, like they added something to the batter. BUT... The juices and little cinnamon rolls were delicious.

The yelp reviews all mention the pot of bread and honesty it was the most underwhelming thing we were served. 

The biscuits and gravy were easily the most delicious we have ever eaten! Try them. 

I have a mild allergy to eggs so breakfast places are always a hard place for me to try but when I saw the chicken & waffles on the menu I knew that I could check rise & shine out!  They were absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy and everything you'd want in a piece of fried chicken. The waffle with the infused cinnamon syrup was out of this world yummy. 

My husband loved his pancakes. I did take a bite and they were nice and fluffy and the cinnamon syrup just adds an extra layer of flavor to make them that much more delicious.

* This is my first time at Rise & Shine, so I've only tried the Steak and eggs. Although, for the only thing I've tried, it's given me a great first impression. I accidentally said the wrong cooking temperature for the steak, so that's my fault. But the flavor was still great and savory. The hash browns were probably my favorite. It had so much flavor and little crunchy bits that I love so much. 

* The price, I believe, was around $15. A little high on the price, but for steak, I guess it's acceptable.

TL; DR version: Delicious food, quick but spotty service.  

Long version: 
Went on Sunday 12-27-15 around 10am.  
$37.44 got us a chicken & waffle breakfast, an ultimate steak & eggs breakfast, a side of fruit for the boy, an apple juice, a coffee, and an orange juice.  I love the spinning floral umbrellas on the ceiling but they are all dusty.  It looks like they would take them down and clean them! It's quite distracting....but I liked all the servers wearing pajamas...I thought that was really cute.  

THE ULTIMATE Steak & Egg breakfast comes with a ribeye steak, two eggs however you want them, hashbrowns, and your choice of bread.  My husband ate this and complained that none of it was seasoned properly, although the bites I had were delicious and my boy enjoyed the eggs a lot.  He ordered pot o' bread as his bread choice and it didn't show up until we reminded our server.  We were done eating but it was fine because it was kind of like a dessert LOL   

Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle was really good.  I never thought I'd say this about chicken but the chicken was....fluffy....it was crispy and light and airy and wonderful although it was terribly bland.  The waffle was crispy and delicious and I loved that their syrup is served warm.  I ate every single bite of this breakfast but did not leave feeling like I hate myself, which is always a good sign that the portions are properly sized.  Pro tip....pour a little cholula on your plate and dip the chicken in it!  Give that chicken some flavor! 

I asked for a side of fruit for my boy ($1.95) and the waitress asked if I wanted the honeydew/canteloupe/pineapple mix or the blueberry/banana/strawberry mix and we picked the latter.  What was delivered was just bananas and strawberries so either they ran out or forgot the blueberries. 

Solid breakfast place!  It is 30 minutes from my house and not worth the trip back but I thoroughly enjoyed this breakfast.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,17,16,3,4TvPOylZ-OVnxHNuQzCqqg

The first thing I noticed as the decor which was bright and fun with these cute umbrella flower rotating art hanging from the ceiling. It did make me feel a bit happy to be there. The next thing i noticed is the wait staff were in PJs. All and all the environment was welcoming and a cute experience.

Next the menu was full of options and i was told by my champions that all the food was good. I stepped out on a limb and ordered some breakfast items. I had a waffle, bacon, hash browns, and the potted bread. It was a lot of food but boy was it tasty. I couldn't finish it all but i enjoyed trying. The syrup is real maple syrup that is brought to the table hot with cinnamon sticks in side. The next good thing is i  tasted some of my friends corn beef hash, regular pancakes, and red velvet pancakes.  (another reason why i probably couldn't finish my food.)  Boy everything was a delight. Party for the taste buds.

Now i live in the area and highly recommend the place. If you really like breakfast foods you may fall in love with the place.

There are upside down umbrellas and flowers hanging from the ceiling and the waitresses are dressed in pajamas. The entrance is a bit awkward, as you are greeted there and it is also where you pay so it can get a bit congested. We were greeted and seated within a few minutes. 

We quickly decided on food and it was out within no time. My husband indulged in the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly and looked really good. I settled on the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. I was envisioning sliced steak on top of my Chiaquiles, as that would be the easiest way to incorporate steak into the dish. Imagine my surprise when I was served an entire steak on the side. However, the steak was a bit fatty and I didn't taste much spice or seasoning. The Chilaquiles were actually pretty good, but there was nothing special or exciting about the flavors. I thought it was a little weird that they served the salsa and sour cream in tiny dishes on the side. I would have liked those to be more incorporated in the dish. But, it was a large portion and I took half of it home. I also chose the Pot of Bread as my side and it was delightful. I loved the look of it when it came to the table. It is a little Terra Cotta pot with a nice fluffy piece of bread rising from it. This was probably the highlight of the meal. The bread had a nice streak of cinnamon flowing through it and was served warm with butter.

Then the food. I got my usual, chicken and waffle. But got disappointed on how small it was. I would've understand if their price went up. But when the food price went up, I'd expect that it'll still be as big (the quality is still good) the chicken was just half what it used to be. So that was disappointing. I was looking forward to leftovers, but no leftovers since it was small.

I don't think we'll be back for a while.",kNCKozR1iBruWYhpZdc2JQ,0,0,3,vJCjPdQigY6J65e3Tkea2A

Came here last week for breakfast the morning it poured/flooded.
One of my coworkers love coming here so a group of us made our way through the rain and flooded streets to rise and shine.
I was excited to try their pot of bread from reading all of the reviews. I don't live close to R&S so I really hoped for a good experience.
It was mid morning and they already ran out of pot of bread! really?! :(
I had the corn beef hash with biscuit which was really tasty. My coworker comes here for the steak and eggs.
If you're in the area and looking for breakfast stop by here! I wouldn't drive out of the way for R&S.

We arrived at about 1 pm on sunday the wait was about twenty minutes. We were greeted by the hostess right away and she was pleasant. She put our names on the list. Now i want to address something some other yelpers here have mentioned and have been upset about, yes there were empty tables when we were wait listed but being in this business i know there is a reason for this and to those who dont know i shall explain. You see it is better to have customers waiting to be seated then waiting at a table for their order to be taken and waiting a long time for food because the kitchen is behind, so the hostess here doesnt over seat the room rapidly so that the servers and kitchen can stay on track. So next time you see this now you know why and can be more forgiving.
Next, we were seated and greeted right away by Cali, she was so friendly, she made great eye contact and had a great smile. We ordered the french press coffee and apple juices. The coffee was AWESOME! so smooth and not bitter so worth the money. Even though it says you get two cups we got about 3 and 1/2. 
Now the food.
My husband ordered the steak and egg breakfast, and i got the ny steak and egg benny on a bagel. Both steaks were cooked to perfection at mid rare. Only thing is my husband did send his eggs back because he likes scrambled well well done, but the cooks were awesome and got his eggs just right.
We also got a yogurt parfait to share and it was soo good! The portions here are big so we got boxes to take home our delicious left overs.
Over all i loved this place from service to food everything was spot on. i definitely recommend this place and we will be back!",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,0,0,5,35xqwATDoB0ZMCYRQgko9A

Hoped there was wifi but there wasn't, but it didn't kill me. Anyways, ordered a cup of coffee, normally I love coffee in the morning but this cup was kind of old, the coffee tasted like it was sitting for awhile but I downed it anyway due to there only being one server. It wasn't too busy, but it was enough to keep one person running around. I ordered the country fried steak and it was good definitely had a zip to it, the eggs weren't over easy but fried...the hashbrowns weren't bad, and of course I'm digging the pot of bread! I hate complaining because I've worked in the food and beverage industry for a long time, so I eat what I eat unless it was raw or cold then I wouldn't. But this was mediocre. It definitely has changed since the first time I was here, so it's kind of disappointing.  They should have put at least one more person on the floor so that someone can always make sure that coffee cups were filled and water cups were filled. 

4 stars were given because besides the food and the service its a beautiful restaurant and it has potential and I hope it's worked on and not forgotten when the new restaurant is built.",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,2,1,4,Kxm6ucA4uOQ4XLDm3L7vTA

5843262,2013-12-15,15,C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,"Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive. 

Here's the rundown:
French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee. 

Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats. 

Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious. 

Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER. 

Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)

Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm. 

If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it. 

I'm rating this a 5 star plus
I'll definitely be back.",R_xjmz2nZgyOkqFKPmkjnA,19,16,5,lJSLsW4FNNMC-Nuv0aOcTA

We ordered up a two egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes ($9) and the corned beef hash and eggs ($10.50) PLUS a short stack of pancakes with warm cinnamon maple syrup. I know it sounds beyond basic, but this is the ultimate American breakfast at its best!  The corned beef was hearty, more on the beef side than the potato and the pancakes were light and fluffy. The bacon was just right, a crunch with a chewy middle.

After learning what the ""pot of bread"" was, we ordered one of those as well. We also had the French press coffee. Love, love that they use Illy coffee. So good.

I admit to having been nervous about the eggs Benedict, because they use ham instead of Canadian bacon, and the menu also noted it had balsamic vinegar on it. Don't get me wrong, love balsamic, just never had it on eggs Benedict.

Food arrives. Yum!!  Best eggs Benedict I think I've ever eaten. The ham was very flavorful and tender, and the balsamic drizzle added just a little touch of flavor. 

My hubby's steak tasted great and his eggs were cooked perfectly. 

Hash browns were also very good. Nice potato flavor and not overly crispy. 

The pot of bread was marvelous. It's described as a cross between a cinnamon roll and dinner roll. To the previous reviewer who complained that it tasted ""yeasty""....um homemade bread is supposed to have a yeasty flavor. 

Decor was nice and loved the servers wearing jammies.  They were all friendly and seemed happy to be there. Only complaint was it felt awfully warm in there, but maybe that was from all the yummy food being prepared.

Came here on Easter Sunday so it was packed af, but the service was still attentive and friendly. As for the food, after trying it on that fateful Easter Sunday, we promptly returned the following week. I cannot praise their signature Cup-O-Bread, Chilaquiles, and orange juice enough.

The Cup-O-Bread is a warm, gooey, sweet cinnamon roll. It's perfection served up in a cute lil' cup.

The Chilaquiles is basically a plate of hearty breakfast nachos and a great vegetarian option. The serving size is so huge, it makes me cry that I can never finish it in one go since I know they won't warm up well. It feels criminal to let something so good go to waste.

The food is standard breakfast food but it's really good here. I loved the Chicken & Waffle! The chicken was moist and tender and had a really nice crispy texture on the outside. Too bad this was my sister and her husband's dish or else I'd eat the whole thing! The steak & eggs dish was good and came with toast and hash browns. I shared this dish and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The steak had a nice char but wasn't as juicy as I'd hope. I loved the side of bacon we had. Can't go wrong with bacon!

Finally a breakfast spot for Southern highlanders.  I'm tired of having to drive miles just for a decent breakfast.

I can't say that I am blown away by the decor or the service.  Heck, there was even a 30 minute wait to get in.  If I were rating on that alone I'd give out an average score of three stars.  The saving grace of this place live behind the counter.  Those cooks are doing a great job and I hope they get paid well.

My girlfriends french toast was the best she's had in Vegas so far.  It didn't even need any syrup on it.  It was just delicious.  

My steak looked like your average steak, but let me tell you, it is hard to find a place that can cook a steak just right.  Normally, you go into a busy restaurant and the steak comes out either over cooked or damn near raw; however, this place was jam packed with people and my steak came out cooked just how I ordered it.  It was even seasoned well.  No A1 required.  I haven't had a steak this good at a restaurant in years!

Well, you learn WAY MORE when things DON'T go perfectly: This Sunday, my wife and I were seated at ""that"" table. Y'know, the mystical spot where ONE waiter thinks it's the other waiter's, and the other one thinks it's the OTHER waiter's. Consequently, we waited 10 minutes with no greeting at all, and watched later arrivals on both sides get attention while we were ignored. Right around the time we were thinking ""Let's get outta here"", the hostess (Shannon) came over, and with true concern told us that she had noticed we had been waiting, and wanted to help. She took our order herself, gave us a 2-for-1 coupon, and brought us our food herself... then she checked back TWICE during our meal to make sure everything was OK, checked us out promptly while mentioning that she recognized my wife and I as ""regulars"", and was extremely pleasant and made friendly conversation, introduced herself and asked our names, and again took great care to apologize for the delay. All I was thinking was ""WOW"". Look, I GOTTA testify, their food is good enough to treat people like dirt and still succeed - the fact that they care so much makes it a NO-BRAINER. I've  trained Customer Service for a living for over 26 years, I know what I'm looking at -  Thank you, Shannon, thank you, Rise And Shine!",crL0l0Jq2s9E3AudnsUzvw,1,0,5,uIHPusP1Jv24RvXe1RimbQ

All puns aside, I do really want to like this place. Service is spot on and incredibly friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired for me I'm afraid. I found the fried chicken flavorless and dry, the waffle was a soggy mess and the chilaquiles were as well. The only thing from my meal that I halfway enjoyed were the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. They were good when paired with the flavorless and over-battered chicken to help make it more palatable. 

Aside from the pancakes, the service was the only other saving grace about this place. I don't see myself making any extra effort to come back when there are much breakfast spots near me that have cheaper prices and better food.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,18,11,2,gCybtbRhsxwVz_PGmOTQvw

Usually, I detour when it points me longer than a mile or so, but learning from last time I'm glad we stayed and headed for this place. Had I not I would have ended up at a run down shack in Barstow. 

The place looked lively as we came in. After all how many places do you know where you can come to work in your pj's. We all loved this! Made us get even more into the Christmas spirit. We were seated promptly. Not that I'm a coffee connoisseur or anything, but they serve Lavazza! Smooth good ol Italian coffee. Last place I had Lavazza was in San Francisco. 

Getting into the menu they had a good variety. I had the steak omelette, and the rest had the chicken and waffles and 3 egg omelette. Overall our breakfast arrived timely, was cooked to order, and I can say their hash browns are outstanding. Only complaint was the chicken had a little too much pepper which ended up brushing off on the waffle. Other than that everything else was good. 

In the end it was a great breakfast spot on our way back to CA. I would highly recommend.",OneCWV0KQmhr0-VTh1p5fQ,1,0,4,U1mJOl_AXmzQAQQ9WjxCvg

It is located quite a distance from the Strip, but it is so worth the drive!!  The staff is wonderful, efficient, helpful, and friendly with everyone dressed in their pajamas.  The interior looks lovely, and what really stands out is all the colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling.

The food that I have tried here has been absolutely positively delicious!!  By no means, am I an expert on all their many menu options here.  There are only two meals that I have ever tried here, and I cannot get myself to try some other items.

Crispy Fried Chicken Breast Atop a Waffle is amazing!  The Belgian waffle with the warm cinnamon maple syrup is really good.  The chicken breast that sits on top of that waffle is even better cause it is so tender, moist, and full of flavor!!  Wow!!

Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes are the BOMB!!!  If you are a sweet tooth like myself, then order this decadent treat!!  It will be like a party in your mouth!!  The combination of the white and milk chocolate chips with the warm cream cheese syrup on top of those fluffy Red Velvet pancakes is like a very very sweet taste of heaven!!!  I can never finish this meal in one sitting because it is so overwhelmingly rich and SWEET!!  Fortunately, the leftovers are almost as good the next day!!  Seriously, get ready for an awesome sugar overload!!

Maybe one day, I will venture to try something else on their menu.  I hear their Steak & eggs are pretty darn incredible as well.  For now, I look forward to my next trip to Sin City so I can get my fill of Rise & Shine's yummy goodness!!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,13,9,5,03OxjyuLf45sA_sD4BObJA
