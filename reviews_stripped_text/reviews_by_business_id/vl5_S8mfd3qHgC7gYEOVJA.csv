The menu clearly says that all sandwiches are served with fries, but the cook thought differently. He actually came out from the kitchen, raised his voice, and asked us directly if we ""requested"" fries. It was very rude and abrasive. I will not be back.",1Cpz3plei4X4BoQFfpdI2A,2,0,1,sYIfve8tFJjwGTct4ZW7yQ

Located right on the Strip across from Monte Carlo, it has the most friendly and attentive staff I've ever come across in a restaurant.  They were very concerned that the food was to my satisfaction, which it was, and the free refills of fountain drinks really hit the spot, since it was broiling outside.  Large portion sizes too.  Highly recommend.",dN4Rg614vGG3rAUfcxX3aQ,1,0,5,zw-SrVvpcOXNAlP2gwaKDQ
4588529,2013-08-04,1,vl5_S8mfd3qHgC7gYEOVJA,"Open only two weeks, Kosher Gourmet offers Kosher Mediterranean cuisine. Traditional appetizers, sandwiches, and dishes such as falafel, shawarma, kabobs,  as well as some Kosher dishes such as Matzo ball soup and Schnitzel. Pitas are baked fresh. They make an awesome falafel sandwich. Prices are very good. Service is interesting, with a lot of shouting between the Israeli  owners, making for an authentic middle eastern experience. A great find in Las Vegas!'  Shalom!",ONqYv2Re2sLPdspqjsHfsg,2,0,4,5P0mC8qWmfhNkJai9HBDbA
