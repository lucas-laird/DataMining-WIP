Unfortunately, I wish we would have stuck to Secret Pizza.  Yes, we only had to wait 15 mins for our whole pizza order but our Manhattan Loaded pizza was..eh.  The pizza was saturated in fat and soaked thru our paper plates and the dough in the middle of the pizza didn't seem cooked enough because it stuck to the pizza box and our slices collapsed whenever we grabbed one to eat.  In addition, one whole pizza at Secret was cheaper than a whole large pizza at Joe's.  Overall, I don't think I will be coming back.",ly2PHxuhklRek7hL9MJrTg,0,0,2,tv9m0Db3zq2HigJajQifYg

My granddaughter suffers from PTSD and severe depression.  Upon entering this establishment, the manager came out from behind the counter and told us we couldn't bring the dog into his establishment.  At that point, he began to raise his voice while telling us to leave.  I attempted to tell him it was a service dog to help her, but he drowned me out while yelling over me.

We left the establishment without further discussion, and my granddaughter was forced to take her meds to calm herself down.  Three hours later she was still visably upset and crying over the incident.

Stopped in this place after driving by on the way home from the office.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the VERY well decorated space.  Pictures and other various things surround you and make you feel as if though you are in NYC.  The second thing you notice is how MASSIVE the slices are!  They're HUGE!  My gf and I ordered a large (8 slices) pizza with two toppings on each half, came out to be $20 and change.

I was skeptical at first paying that much for a pizza, but we were both VERY pleased.  The pizza was ready in about 10 minutes and it was very well cooked and presented. Another thing with NY style pizza is that some other ones in the area tend to be greasy where as this one was not at all.

I apologize for not having a photo to share as we were both so hungry that as soon we got home we cracked open the box and ate the whole thing :)

We ordered today for a delivery to the Thomas & Mack Center, told the girl on the phone ""Thomas & Mack Center"", we get a call an hour later because the driver is on the other side of campus. Ok........

I ordered a pesto panini for $9.45. NO WAY a sandwich this small should cost this much and not be inside a casino. I asked if the sandwich at least came with fries, and I was told no. So, I decided to order fries as well. When we finally got our delivery, The delivery driver informed me that my panini came with potato chips, but since I didn't say which ones I wanted he just brought a random bag. What??? If the girl taking our order on the phone had told me that, I would have held off on ordering a $4.00 order of oil-soaked, unsalted, soggy fries that I didn't end up eating in the first place. Not cool man.

My co-worker ordered mild chicken tenders and fries, she said her chicken was good, but the mild sauce was super bland. She didn't end up using too much of it. Her fries also were the same oil-soaked, unsalted soggy ones that I ordered. She also threw most of them away. We were pretty disappointed this time considering the pizza(chicken pesto) we ordered last time was REALLY good.

Bottom line, their pizza is really good and worth the price. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch and the chicken pesto pizzas. Stay away from everything else.",K0ilMgm_KwwqPApK1_11vA,0,0,2,Ud2mqVNWhWP_BfGG6DHisw

I was kind of suspicious that they didnt mention what the price was going to be, but I figured that a two topping veggie pizza couldnt be that expensive.

The delivery boy showed up to my hotel room pretty promptly, but the bill was for over $25! I couldn't believe it, thats more than twice what I regularly pay back home (in Los Angeles mind you, where nothing is cheap!), so I was very disappointed there.

I returned later and the female ""Manager"" told me Pete wasn't there and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone.

How do you NOT crown Joe's top pizza in LV? Have you seen the SUPER MEATY? It's freakin' 2 layers of delicious mouth watering meat and cheese for $25! They delivered to my hotel, which was awesome! My gf and I only ate 3 slices of the super meaty and we tapped out. It was so good I literally wrapped it in plastic and drove 4 hours back home to Los Angeles to share it with my friends (well, after the weekend was over). 

If you put 4 or 5 stars for a commercial pizza like the Pizzeria @ the Cosmopolitan then you don't know what pizza really is.

My Experience: All PIzzas 

- cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and a mix of each mentioned.

Their prices are quite expensive and pizza Greasy as mentioned. On a positive note,  they do bundle up the toppings and I believe they use ""Grande"" (high quality) mozarella cheese.

My friend purchased a Groupon deal ($15 for $30 worth of food) for this place while we stayed at Paris. However, they cannot deliver to certain hotels (in order for hotels to promote their temporary residents to eat at their central eateries-- Paris was one of them), so we had to be creative and have Joe's NY Pizza deliver to Planet Hollywood, which was right next door.

Mary (I believe that was her name) was way helpful with our ordering and suggesting foods for us to order so that we can make the most of our deal.

Promise a specific time and I'll think you're late for every minute you don't meet it. The fries were obviously old and had been reheated in a microwave and extra salt added on top of the original salt to hide the flavor. The calzone was fine and came with more marinara than any place I've had. Tuna sandwich came with a bonus salad I wasn't expecting. The sandwich was fairly small though for the price though.

I would never have thought about it again but my mom saw a delivery car recently and suggested it when we were craving pizza. 

We ordered a 20"" pizza (""humongous"", and it is). Half white spinach and half Grandee Pepperoni with garlic knots for good measure. Three of us finished about half of it. The slices could easily be cut again in half but I guess that's New York pizza! It was greasy as expected but my goodness was it good. The white spinach was for me, and I really enjoyed the earthiness of the spinach. The crust was perfect: thin and floppy at the bottom, blistered and crispy at the crust. There was plenty of ricotta to make every bite flavorful as well. 

I had a few bites of the Grandee Pepperoni, apparently an award winner from 2015. It has deep fried pepperoni bites on it which gives it a nice crunch in the middle of all that greasy, saucy pepperoni. Loved the red peppers as well: they're thinly sliced rings which are hot and juicy. The garlic knots were fine, not my favorite and a little too burnt/hard for me. It didn't really matter though because I am so happy to add a third pizzeria option in the area (Naked City, Metro). Speaking of those other two, the prices here are comparable to them so i don't mind paying more for good quality.

I expected something amazingly delicious for the exorbitant price tag but when my pizza arrived (awesome delivery by the way), I was quite confounded. My pizza was basically a slightly oversized Domino's pizza. ""New York Pizza""??? I thought to myself. Shocked? Slightly. Surprised? Certainly! Once again I was reminded of the pizza conundrum: people do NOT know what New York pizza is. Not to sound elitist but I am actually from New York so I feel allowed to put my two cents in here. Joe's New York Pizza, I suggest a job-related trip! New York pizza has dense, chewy, but THIN crust. The sauce is rich and tomatoey. Cheese abundant but not excessive. Toppings ON TOP of cheese, not under a dairy fire blanket of mozzarella that chokes out the deliciousness beneath. Overall I appreciate the attempt but this is not New York Pizza. Crust is fat, floppy, and airy, and as for the flavor, sauce is reminiscent of Ragu, a sin that has sent many an Italian grandmother to a premature grave. Good luck Vegas on finding some real NY pizza at a good price. Took the gamble at Joe's New York Pizza and lost more than just $42.00.",D1y2Z0nYjFZQjfGqiHooAQ,1,1,3,ivg3pVad6qzdgflKQubhTg

I ordered a lasagna and pepperoni sausage, while my friends ordered Hawaiian (yuck imo) and a few other kinds. I also got a side of ranch which costs 50 cents. I do not understand why some places charge for ranch, I mean their pizza is already so expensive that you think they could afford to give away a tiny container of ranch for 50 cents. Maybe its because everybody asks for it and it gets expensive but really? I am already spending 10bucks, why not throw in a ranch? /endrant

The very first time I ordered they said my card wouldn't go through , I called my bank and they said my card was fine. Called Joes back and they said it's declined. So at that point I was tired and left it alone. Next day I wake up to see a charge on my account from joes pizza! Apparently my card did go through and I never got my pizza! I called my bank got it cleared. I figured it was s mistake. 

Last night I decided to try them out once again. Not only did the pizza make my family and I very nauseous but I woke up to have two charges from them!!! I called them and spoke to JULIE the manager. She explained to me that this has happened to a few clients and doesn't know why and she would have the owner call me. The OWNER  called 20 minutes later making excuses as to why this would happen. He continued to say all of this was impossible to happen because it didn't show on his end and said he needed the ""truth"". I explained that I already disputed the charges with my bank and maybe that's why it wasn't showing up . He asked to see my bank statements!!! Because I wasn't telling him the truth. He also said ANY ORDER YOU PLACE WITH A CREDIT CARD WILL BE PRE AUTHORIZED for the same amount in his restaurant. 

In the end my bank resolved the issues of course but I  only called them to let them know there's an issue in their system they need to resolve and I got a rude call from the owner calling me a liar!

There is one Yelper, who admits she is not a fan of pizza, but says she liked the flavor. This actually makes sense, someone who doesn't like pizza might actually like one that has no flavor what-so-ever.

This is probably the blandest pizza dough I have ever tasted. Just plain blah.

I could not taste the sauce at all, though it was not due to the bland crust or overwhelmed by the toppings, it was just poor sauce and very little of it.

I won't say it was bad pizza, just slightly below average (somewhere below papa johns pizza and somewhere above my Norwegian grandmother's pizza). 

The reason the place can't even make 2 stars is due to 2 parts - 1 - the very poor attitude of the woman who served me at the counter and; 2 - the OUTRAGEOUS price for 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink ($14 - AYFKM?), puts this place just below crap in my book. 

This place is probably kept open by an endless flux of intoxicated Hard Rockers thinking this place must be good because the sign on the door says so. Of course, they don't stick around Vegas long enough to regret their decision as I did.

Perhaps there was a time when this place served good New York pizza, but it certainly doesn't anymore. The poor quality of the food and the poor service suggest the place is barely staying open. 

I wish there was a sign that we could place on the doors of establishments that said: ""We're Cutting Quality to Maximize Profits! GFY if you don't like it."" - it would certainly be more useful.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,8,5,1,WfaN1aiANMP7_I9CJkcycQ

Time: 7:41 pm

Small strip mall pizza joint that bills itself as New York pizza and has won the Best of Las Vegas 2013, 2014, and 2015 in the category of ""Best Traditional & Non Traditional Pizza."" But don't be fooled by the awards... 

I'm giving it 3 stars vs 5 stars because it's not horrible and most people would like it. Although, I debated giving it 2 stars....

This pizza wasn't to my taste. I prefer a spicier sauce vs a sweet sauce and a crispy crust or at least one that's cooked... 

I love New York pizza. Give me a good hard crust, the harder the better and I'm a happy woman. 

But Joe's couldn't deliver. Instead I got a crust that was limp and flaccid. 

Apparently you have to ask for well done or your pizza is barely cooked. Have eaten lots of New York pizza but not once have I had to ask them to cook it.

Ordering is assembly style where one person takes the order and another rings it up. 

The menu is extensive but there are no prices for slices. And that's where you get burned when you order 2 or more slices. 

A slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni cost $8.70 with tax. No drink, just 2 slices of pie. Say what?  For a few bucks more you can buy a 12"" cheese pizza.

There's a self serve all-you-can-drink fancy soda machine.

Communal seating with a single table for two by the door, table for four, two bar height tables for six and a long wraparound booth with three tables.

Would I go back? No. It wasn't the worst pizza, but I like a sauce with bite and crisp crust. I'd rather eat something I enjoy than eating just to eat. If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a sandwich from CVS.",Bv3Zt8seTtqks7PoriKvSw,6,5,3,7RM7DzwSc__sHJtE0S7lLw
3830833,2011-02-19,5,Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA,"Another stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.

OK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:

Pepperoni & Jalapeno
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw
Meat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng
Super Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g

The total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.

It was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be ""well done"", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.

Once I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!

The first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw
I liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.

Next up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg
The Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be ""well done"".

Last but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious.

Delivery: Only takes 20-40 min.  Drivers are clean, pleasant and seem to actually care about what they do.  Give them a great TIP if you use delivery.  

Restaurant is small, simple and clean.  Quick service from people who give a %$# about the food they serve.

Not far from Strip, across street from Hard Rock.  

Definitely worth the trip or delivery.",t0AWZbvewKX1djPIdSpqOQ,0,0,5,7uFHhugVswOURtUSD-UUpg

My second and last positive moment was how clean their restroom and dining area was being kept up, very nice. Sadly I paid $12 for two slices of pepperoni pizza and a small drink. The pizza was greasy, burnt and almost inedible. If I wasn't already in a hurry i would have asked for my money back. I will never be returning to an establishment where one I paid for the cost of almost an entire pie and two where the pizza was burnt.

I will say I had 4 people ask if I had been helped which was awesome customer service! I walked in and ordered two slices of cheese right away. 

While I was waiting for them to put my pizza in the oven, I paid for my order with a credit card while reading the sign saying we card everyone if you are paying with card. The girl did not ask for my ID and there was no one behind me. So she wasn't rushed just didn't feel like doing her job well. I got two cheese slices and a soda. She gave me the combo price. Put the receipt and pen on the counter and walked away didn't even hand me my drink cup or say thank you. It's ok I can do it myself. I only worked in the hospitality industry for 10 years. You had one job, seriously a 10 year old could do it. 

I encounter 5 people the first four excellent customer service the last one rude and ungrateful for my business. I live near by and I think my money might be appreciated else where. 

Now to the pizza. They say it authentic Italian New York pizza. I'm a believer in a pizza is truly good if you don't have to add toppings. Meaning the crust is good, the sauce is flavorful and the cheese is good real cheese. If it's good just plain adding toppings just adds not masks the flavors. The crust was good the sauce lacked that classic Italian flavor and basically it just tasted like old pizza put in the oven. Which exactly is what it is. 

So basically if NY pizza tastes like it came from the mall's food court then I'm not a fan.  Definitely not the best pizza in town. Probably just a tourist trap to get everyone from Hard Rock Hotel.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,4,2,2,T7pOIgWR8HUjyUpwej1MNA

We go to the original location on Paradise and frequently visit the Las Vegas Boulevard location. However, I enjoy the Paradise location's cooking better sometimes. Not sure what they do, but the staff is always on point with what they make and it never takes as long to get your food either. 

FOOD 

Delicious food! My go to items are the Grandee Pizza (award-winning pizza), Garlic Knots, Chicken Wings (Voted Best in Las Vegas) with the Mango Habanero sauce and the Italian Panini. Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also throw in a dessert item. For parties, I cater from Joe's NY Pizza and I always get the biggest pizza size which each slice is bigger than the size of your head! Always get rave reviews on the food when I get catering through Joe's. 

SERVICE 

Excellent! I can barely think of a time when they didn't treat us well. However, we are locals that frequent the place. But, I think when you're loyal to a place they should treat you well! 

PRICE 
I think the place is fairly priced for what you get. The portions are generous, the food quality is high, service and location is awesome and you get a pizza stamp card so after X-amount of pizza orders you get a FREE one. You can also sign up for their VIP email list and get a coupon for free chicken wings. They always have great deals so just ask them when you go there. They'll always be ready to help you!

And 2) it's consistent. I really really dislike when I find a place I like and I go back and it's bad. I hate hit or miss places and Joe's is just not one of those.

We asked if they could deliver to the hotel, but they said we'd have to meet them at the entrance and not at our room. That sucked so we opted out of delivery and just went for pick up. Might as well. 

10-15 minutes go by and we make our way towards the vicinity. When we entered and asked for our order, the woman in the front said it'd be about 5 more minutes. Poops.

So he put me on hold and another guy came on the phone and started reading the notes but read it to me very slow as if I was slow and didn't understand...it was offensive and this situation could of been handled very differently because I will never order from you guys ever again,3g9343uZj43MB5fzUEUaTQ,0,0,1,B280YYZdWAStP-4_OGE2Qg

We were in the mood for pizza and buffalo wings, Simple enough. My husband and I  ordered a small pepperoni pizza and order of 10 mild buffalo wings, which totaled to 24.95, ordered to go. When we got to our room we opened the pizza box (to the naked eye it looked like a regular pepperoni pizza) When I picked up the first slice the toppings slid right off. I put the toppings back on and took a bite and.... the pizza was doughy, uncooked and just bleh! So I moved on to the Buffalo wings. I ordered mild because most of the time when I order hot, the sauce is just fire hot! Well apparently mild means no sauce,  and when I took a bite of the chicken it tasted like previously frozen/old chicken, not good AT ALL!

The office manager either didn't count too well or figured that all of us looked skinny and needed to add a few pounds. Because she ordered an entire large pizza for every 1.5 people. 

I ate along with about a dozen others, and we finished off maybe 3 pizzas total. And a lot of these guys were on the larger side, too!

They even have a slice special like they used to. At least you felt your getting something.

First of all I can tell you how much it cost for a slice of pizza because there were no prices listed. What I can say is that two slices of pizza with a bunch of toppings came out to around $14.99 with two drinks. So by doing the math is not bad however it's not a New York price for New York slice of pizza. I found the sauce to be kind of bland and much to be desired. I was expecting some oregano sometime or something Italian. I didn't find it here.

The good thing about this place is that it stays open till 5 a.m.. So if you left the club and you want something to eat that's quick this is definitely the spot for you.

Joe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers. 

Their lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1/2 off during lunch. 

We walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either. 
BUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had. 

The space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:

1. Walk in and head to the front counter. 

2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.

3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.  

4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch! 

5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter. 

6. Enjoy! 

We absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have.

The white truffle was a little disappointing, as there was so much bacon.. it overpowered any taste of white truffle or mushrooms.  The frat boy tasted great!!  The only thing, the type of ingredients on it sweat when heated, so the crust gets a little soggy... it's not like that's anything they could fix though.. that's just expected with this kind of pizza.  It will be great as leftover pizza heated in the oven though!  I ordered the chicken alfredo again, as I was sooo impressed with it last time.. kinda wanted to see if that was a fluke, but nope, it was sooo good again!!  I add mushrooms to it also.. and heated up as leftovers.. omg, I'm in heaven!!

The chicken on the buffalo chicken was dry since it was sitting all day...  the tomato basil tasted much better.  The plus is that the slices were a good size.",54ANhcwkZm0zK-bEuEfnpw,0,0,4,SzAGJGA-tdUkPeBQSg60lg

To be honest there are probably other places you can  go in las Vegas for good new York style pizza but this is one of. The best I've had. 

However the area the location is in isn't so great (on paradise close to the strip) so be prepared for crack heads and tourists alike. Also be prepared for a wait since this place usually has a small wait at the least to order plus for your food to get to you.

The pizza itself is really good, puffy crusts and large slices.  They have a good variety of different slices of pizza from vegetarian to meat lovers to plain cheese.

Alright let's talk my type of pizza: crust needs to be perfect, not too doughy and not too dried out and crunchy. The ratio of cheese to tomato sauce to crust also needs to be considered. It can't be watery, too cheesy, or too dry. I'm sure a 3way ANOVA can show some significance...(lol). The dough must have a neutral yet pleasant taste. I think it depends on the water. The tomato sauce should be savory, not sweet with too much sugar.
This place meets my standards for my type of pizza. 
Other than the delicious food, the service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is hilarious! There are pictures of funny 1950's billboards and posters with clever puns and cute pin up girls with funny sayings. Plus the tables are wiped down and the floor is free of grease tracks and spilled pepper flakes.

Came here after a whole day at REHAB on a Sunday and after walking around like seemed like forever inside the hard rock hotel- finally found a guy to locate us in the direction of food, specifically pizza, which I was craving. (All of hard rocks food closed at around 6 & what was open seemed to cost am arm and a leg for something half that price back home!)

Boy was I glad we left the hotel, and although quite drunk, we managed to hop tipsily on over to this little strip mall next to a sports bar and a sushi place and boy was I surprised!! Best pizza ever!! DELICIOUS!

I walked right in- spent about $5 for a slice of pizza that would put costcos to shame and my taste buds were doing a dance of glory! The tomato basil was to die for!- thin crust, freshly tasting basil with yummy marinara and the perfect blend combined. 

It was SO good we told out friends who we came back with like an hour later and every single person who walked in seemed to either be a local and know the spot or were told the same thing by someone else and were thoroughly impressed. I even had their fettuccini Alfredo the second time and it was almost better than Olive Garden!!

It smelled a bit off and was so dry and crunchy like it had been under a heating lamp for a while. I also ordered a buffalo chicken sub with chicken tenders for my boyfriend. That had to be the most upsetting of the order. The lettuce (salad, lets be honest) was brown and even looked burnt in some areas. It was soggy and very unsavory looking. At least the chips were good right? I had to take out and toss all the peppers, tomatoes, the entire sub, the side chicken and the zippoles were so weak and there's no way there was cinnamon on it.
