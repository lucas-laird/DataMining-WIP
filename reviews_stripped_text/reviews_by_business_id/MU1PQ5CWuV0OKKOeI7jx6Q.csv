When running a business like this you need to have a friendly staff that can take orders right and not be rude to your customers. I always went thru drive thru and the supervisor that works drive thru is rude, non friendly, bad vibe. I love Popeyes but would rather give business to Pollo Loco or Church Chicken for better customer service. WIll never come back again, I had asked the supervisor for the person in charge of her and she was misguiding me and I told her I will find out and put in a complaint to the owner of the company.

This place shares a store front with a Chevron gas station.  I went up to the counter and placed my order.  The girl took my order without a problem and I went to find a seat.  There are about 7 tables.  I looked at two of them and they were dirty.  The third table I found appeared clean so I claimed it. My order was ready quickly and the chicken was fresh and hot.  The biscuit was flat and dry.  

The Popeye's restaurant shares a drink fountain with the convenience store.  The area where you stand to get your soda was filthy.  The floor needed to be mopped.   The floor in the resturant area was also dirty with wet spots of soda spilled on the floor and a trail or something that I am guessing came from dragging a trash bag across the floor.

When I was done eating I took my tray to the front to dump the trash into the trashcan but I could barely open the door to the trashcan.  It was stuffed full even though there were only three trays sitting on top of the tashcan.  I needed to use the bathroom but I figured it would be in the same state or worse than what I had seen so I decided to wait. 

There are other Popeye's in town that I think you could get better service from and have a cleaner dining experience.  Overall I would try and avoid this place if possible and find somewhere else to eat.",fVK62lNSxqP6QtZPm6SreA,1,0,2,yqPdMjIV7H-k2tLeUZDvag

Then, I called the Customer Service number and was told that someone would call me back - that was over 2 months ago.  I even filled out the survey on their website which asks if you want to be contacted and I gave all my contact information.  NO-ONE from Popeyes has ever bothered to contact me!!!

When I took it back and showed the manager my receipt and exactly what I received he couldn't even tell me what the problem was; he had to ask the young dude working the window what the problem was. The manager then approved the young dude to ""get him what he didn't get yet"".  When the young man came over with the remaining pieces of chicken I was shorted I told him I didn't expect to have to eat cold chicken, the manager overheard me, came over to me, grabbed the bag from my hand, and slam dunk it in the trash can. Normal protocol would be to let the customer decide if he/she wanted to keep the wrong order and then get the order remade, hot and fresh.  Not at this Popeyes. Never an apology.  Never an offer for a Coke while I waited.  Never even looked me in the eye. This place is the WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, And I travel extensively and eat fast food as often as anybody. STAY AWAY FROM HERE.

I mean you work here because you should be able to perform to the standard required like completing an order. Another thing is the guys in front(within the hour of 5pm today) ""taking care"" of the people walking in for orders were entirely, as a crew, inefficient. Tylor/Taylor talked too much in front of customers. He even asked a customer to write down what she wanted because he could understand the acronym his job uses. I mean seriously? You work here right? Milo seemed lost and was very quiet. Even when calling orders I could barely hear him, and I was literally the first person on the other counter. On top of that he got my order wrong. Missing 2 pieces of chicken from my order and a whole box of 12 biscuits which I paid for. It's honestly not the food but the incompetence of doing uiur job. Any job, no matter what you do, should be taking seriously. I can't even go on any more about how bad it was.

There has not been a single time, and I'm not exaggerating at all, that we have visited this drive through and had our order correct. When we started coming here a few years back we would simply drive all the way home before opening the sack to major disappointment. We would call and sometimes go back, sometimes be told we could come back the next day. We didn't go that often, too much of a hassle, but the kids can easily be fed chicken legs without complaints and in terms of distance KFC is just as far. When you don't have the energy to cook I prefer the mashed potatoes at Popeyes or else it would never even come up. After a number of visits and complaints you expect a change to be made, perhaps training, and so personally I still didn't check the order before leaving if I was driving. I expect it to be correct! My wife began checking before leaving the parking lot but I'm usually driving. There were even times I would opt to eat in simply to save myself the frustration of dealing with it at all. Here's the thing: you check your order but you don't do it at the window because you try to be polite and get out of the way of those behind you. No matter what the order is incorrect and you HAVE TO PARK AND GO INSIDE! It makes me angry so I have said that we should just go inside anyway to save time since we'll be in there regardless. Sometimes you aren't dressed for that though and so lately we make s habit of just checking, no matter what, before leaving the parking lot. I almost lost it today! Once again there was missing food from my order. Mind you at this point I have s helmet on my head because I'm missing part of my skull which gets uncomfortably hot and I wasn't really dressed to walk inside but at least I had shoes on which my wife did not. So I got to go inside and retrieve the missing chicken. Every time! It's not as though you can even have s pleasant experience while ordering because something is wrong wth the intercom system and you find yourself repeating your order multiple times, with no visual confirmation. Sigh. Like I said, if my children, and really it is just the six year old at this point the older one is easier, weren't so damn picky we'd have more options. The worst part about today? IT WAS THE MANAGER WHO SAW ME COME INSIDE FOR MY MISSING PIECES! When I mentioned to her the frequency of the problem she simply said ""Oh yeah"" AS IF IT WERE NORMAL TO GIVE PEOPLE WRONG ORDERS! I never check my bag at chick fil a, thankfully that's open close enough that I never have to visit this Popeyes any longer. Today just happened to be Sunday, only reason I went.

Ordered from the drive thru and it took forever. The food was wrong (spicy chicken tenders instead of mild) and didn't know it until we got home. Brought the spicy tenders back to get mild, they tried to replace again with spicy. After another wait, was given mild but told it would be another 40 minute wait if we wanted the fries. Absolutely unacceptable.

I don't expect much when I go to a place like this, but I do expect consistency and decent service time. Tonight, we had neither. The store was clearly not prepared to handle their business today.",XKeuPLLtzQN_avH-Tp9CzA,5,2,1,p0KL0nmSrCjT50qIWOx3qA

It's legitimately spicy even for a capsaicin burnout like me - but not excessively so. It's a nice warmth. Dip them in Mardi Gras mustard, redolent of horseradish and whole mustard seeds, and you're set.

The red beans and rice are the only side you need to ever bother with here. Not that the other sides are bad. They're just unnecessary.

When I'm feeling guilt and shame the grilled naked chicken wraps are so tasty that I don't even miss the batter and oil of the traditional strips.

Yes, it's a chain fast food restaurant.

Yes, it's attached to a gas station.

No, you shouldn't care.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,1,5,6Stw4Oa8ZOr3Nf0bknfIWw

I'm always too lazy to go inside to order... I like Popeye's better than KFC... It's much more crispier and tastier in my opinion...Chicken is affordable on Tuesday's and I really like the sides here like the dirty rice, red beans and rice, Cajun fries...",b2T3yx_n_axnRD160xUjjA,1,1,3,Q6lFUu07uD7JaWlfVMXOug

She argued with me about what I ordered when I know I was correct and even the corporate office agreed with me. She then continued to argue with me about it at the window and then she shoved the food in my car very rudely and told me to go. And guess what....after arguing with me about what I ordered she still managed to give me the wrong order lol how does that happen? She threatened to call the cops because I wouldn't leave due to her not giving me the order I asked for on top of not even giving me the order she told me I asked for lol. Her coworkers were in the back laughing like children I would not trust to eat at this location at all as the food is very underwhelming , the co-workers are like children and shouldn't be trusted with food and the location is managed by a narcissist manager/cashier ! If you come across the manager/cashier ""ALMA"" who on the receipt goes by the name ""Order Taker"" then please give her a smile as she obviously needs more love in her life and less hate and rudeness!",x3sNtNX88XtBaWWomUlMPA,1,0,1,0XyP1SvszQcLcw-PaBEfRA

The only thing that makes this one a little weird is that it is connected to a Gas Station. This seems to be the norm for Nevada, but it is something I just can't get use to. But, while I have a problem with that little piece, I still got a 5 piece with fries. 

I realluy do hate that I like popeys so much. Damn you delicious chicken house!!!!!!!",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,4,2,4,kw51NYtVhWY5_FgdWYLaYw
