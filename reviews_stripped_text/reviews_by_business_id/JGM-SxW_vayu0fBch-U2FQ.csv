I had no problem with that since I was still in the casino gambling and could wait. Placed my order and the amount was $48.58 for a Large pepperoni, soda, and half bucket of wings. I thought that was pretty expensive but it was cheaper than the hotel food so it was whatever. 2 hours passed, no food... no call.... nobody picking up their phone. After about 10 tries, they finally picked up and said they ran out of food. I could not believe how ridiculous the  service was and how careless these people are. I strongly suggest do not even give these guys the oppurtunity to rip you off and piss you off on your vacation.",goLovRj5llulbe14yoLtpQ,13,1,1,moWkBIyGWcvyMARoK-5blQ
1306147,2014-10-20,1,JGM-SxW_vayu0fBch-U2FQ,This place has the worst quality pizza you can find in vegas. I've tried a lot of pizza places but this place is just horrible. If I could I would give this place no stars. If your hotel is nearby please do not order from here. There's a pizza place much better and it's called Joe's NY pizza located on Harmon and paradise next to the cvs. Trust my words I work at one of the hotels around there and there is many complains about PIZZA BELLA!

I called the number on the flyer, since it said they were open till midnight. The time was about 1120pm. No one answered and I even tried calling from another number. I was very disappointed to not get an answer. I will talk to the hotel staff in the morning. Hopefully they can advise them to not state false info to the hotel guests who are hungry and tired.",TiQVk1Inw9CWuzuLaDQX7Q,9,0,1,m1sDajcwxh808v7qq-67sA

Ok so here's my beef with all these little pizza places and this one falls into the same category: pizza joint with Italian names or wording and no one in there is Italian!!!! 

As an Italian it offends me! And don't even say it's Spanish because you aren't calling yourself the taco bella! Use another name! Because this isn't beautiful pizza!

We ordered a plain cheese pie. There was sooooo much grease on top that it dropped off the pizza, real mozzarella doesn't do that! 
The sauce tastes like tomatoes out of a can and oregano dumped in it. 

This was a Sunday and the place across the street was closed :( 

Not going back.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,3,0,1,PSFpwxWwCHoKP7xQC6XvHQ
3224151,2015-08-01,0,JGM-SxW_vayu0fBch-U2FQ,The only good thing about this place was the nice delivery guy. The pizza tasted like something you would find at your local CiCi's pizza. The spaghetti sauce was very acidic and flavorless. The chicken burrito was dry and the Caesar salad came hot and with a spring mix lettuce instead of the classic romaine that one would expect. Save your money and order Napolis pizza instead...,qLkmnF3Z9Lkl4qHSkt2_zg,1,0,1,JzO1pjNEXlrlNekuMQL8vA

We were tired so we got their flyer under our hotel door decided to order their pizza, chicken and lasagna. The pizza was nasty crust was hard and chewy; very little pepperoni and the mushroom was not fresh they used canned oyster mushroom NEVER had pizza that tast like this before. Going on to the chicken it was hard and crispy it's like they fried it and poured BBQ sauce on top and the lasagna nothing to rave about the frozen Stouffers lasagna is much tastier than this one. I would never ordered any foods out this establishment again. I spent $50 on worthless foods that we ended up not finishing anything and throwing it out after a few bites. The food, quality and taste is not worth it all thought it was pricy!!!! UGH GROSS and pissed that I spent that much on worthless foods.",BxJIjg_7Dl51OJICsVj4zg,13,1,1,eLbqOkxlqiGskIJTfx2J0A

5441738,2013-07-04,0,JGM-SxW_vayu0fBch-U2FQ,"In Vegas for a few days and needed food delivered to the hotel.  The hotel provided Pizza Bella's menu in the room's booklet so figured why not. 

The pizza is OVERPRICED and tasted and looked like cardboard. TERRIBLE. Paid $3 for toppings and got maybe two pineapples and three tomato chunks on each slice. 


Salad was basically a bunch of lettuce with goat cheese. 

Paid $24 because they also included a $3 delivery charge plus a $2 debit card fee which they don't tell you on the phone.  They also don't give you the fees on the menu, just say delivery charge may apply and surcharge for credit cards. 

On top of that they don't allow you specify how much you want to submit for a tip if you use debit card. Cheapest amount you can leave is fifteen percent so pretty much paid $30 for cardboard, lettuce and goat cheese.

5763856,2013-12-22,1,JGM-SxW_vayu0fBch-U2FQ,"There is nothing bella about this place. I am local and i give places a chance, but this kinda sucked. I came in to order , and it said on the window 7.99 for a LARGE cheese pizza carry out. So I ordered that and 10 BBQ wings for 7.99 as well. Went down the street and came back to pick up my food. The box was seriously the size of a SMALL. MAYBE MEDIUM pizza. Large my asshole, this was DEF NOT a large pizza. At the local pizza place i usually go to you can get an x-large just cheese for 8.99 and you get an x-LARGE pizza. So i know what the difference is... When i asked ""is this really a large?"" The dude laughed and it seemed he mocked me by saying - "" Extra large!"" I was like - yeah ok. 
The wings sucked, I have had beef jerkey that was better. They were NOT BBQ flavored, they just had a brown sauce on them,... If i had to guess, I'd say they forgot what flavor I ordered and just gave me mild whatever. Duno how they forgot my wing flavor, I was the only customer there. Oh yeah no ranch or blue cheese either, was not surprised. This place is for drunk people who stumble over from the Double Down, this is not a sit down, or purchase a WHOLE pizza type place. Its a by the slice type of joint.

Prob wont go back. Going to look for a new after work pizza place.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,11,1,2,nMaWLp2OzpPYBHSIE7y2WQ
