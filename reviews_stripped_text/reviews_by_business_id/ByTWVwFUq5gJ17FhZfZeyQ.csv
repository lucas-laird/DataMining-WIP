Staff was friendly fast and just attentive enough, and the place was packed last night for the Las Vegas premiere of the desert racing movie ""Dezert People 13"".",UXzPI7yBSUILqvJDkhHE1w,1,1,5,WujpKwv70o_gVPqp9fQkyg

The bartender (Trevor) barely says two words to people, and only acknowledges them by what they drink.  I went here with two friends who come here all the time, and we are in the ""industry"". The only time the bartender offers me anything (after looking up from his crossword or whatever), is when I ask.  He only knows my name because my friends told him, never asks how peoples days are, an frankly is one of the worst bartenders I have ever been around.  Around the corner, there are three bars with friendly bartenders who talk to you and understand what their job is.

Oh, and one more thing.  In five times of being here, and spending about 10 hours here, I've yet to see the guy pick up a towel and wipe ANYTHING down.  As we in the business know...If you don't see cleanliness in the FOH, you know the BOH is even worse.

And again, it's not like the guy doesn't know that I live around the corner, my roommate and his gf come here all the damned time.  IMO, it's just the worst laziness I have ever seen in a bartender.

EDIT: After writing this, I read the reviews...Wow why would ANYONE come to this POS.  EVERYONE has noted how bad the ""service"" is.  I guess they just don't give a shit.",fqjuy7iAJSn5hcvl_8mOQg,7,1,1,eRvzh3I18ECU5yeBt6I0dw

Seriously, come here and try the wings...so awesome",zJ4ch-_I3cbakJlTHOur2Q,3,0,5,TiQoR2PrAWo_8egyM_U63w

So I call last night to ask if I can order pizza and they said the kitchen closes at 9 pm every day.. What the heck. 
So 1 star for false advertisement ):",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,8,1,1,8TteSBNyFAbtF3h54Ck-Tg

2222114,2015-07-31,2,ByTWVwFUq5gJ17FhZfZeyQ,"We'll start with 4 stars for now. The bartender was exceptionally friendly, and poured a good drink. The place has 2 soft tip dart boards, and 2 pool tables. Lots of TVs and plenty of space at the bar. Poker machines have 10 cent poker and keno too!

It feels a little Divey, but I think the new ownership is going to spruce it up. Looking forward to having some food available at this neighborhood bar!",KQ_XMjIB5mQS4NRhT5cesQ,6,1,4,cQl5guKKceIfamUypqzh8g

If you are looking for a good place to unwind after work and have a tasty hamburger, this is the place.",0MSoukoOFg660h_fjI6f8Q,0,0,5,CmNQ9tHdkFDZRplRGHCgyA

So Viola's has been advertising a beer/pizza special and i get e-mail notifications about that special very often. During Golden Knight hockey games customers are encouraged to buy 2 pitchers of beer and a pizza for $24.00.  But when i went into Viola's to take advantage of this special i was informed that the kitchen was out of pizza dough. I then asked the bartender if he was willing to substitute another food item in place of the pizza. I specifically asked to substitute the $12.00 pizza for a $8.00 order of chicken fries. The bartender wouldn't do it!",uHVoWzSg4d9-Hk3VGFQJpg,0,0,1,gkapMTwD-q8pJi28j_d75Q

It is a very spacious bar area. The actual bar is huge and curves around with many gaming table tops. In the bar area there are several seating areas, a big juke box & great lighting. 

We ordered 2 bloody mary's - Surprise! And 2 appetizers. The bloody marys were good, just the right amount of spice. No special vodkas or garnishes. Tasty. We got the pot stickers - Delicious! And the pretzel bites with some kind of cheese whiz. Meh. Next time & there will be! 

Upon entering, they have a nice area - see pics - with couches, chairs & tables. Perfect for a small party / girls night out / gaming aka RPG. 

Staff was attentive & gracious. It was quite crowded at 3pm on a Monday. Ok it is a Hollyday. 

Great fat girl seating!",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,1,0,4,WBPUyCHHOtkhGpN-TcgmUw

I will definitely be coming back for more.",QguZ25o46c_fXRh19F2ThQ,1,0,5,uIEAVrotw1Worh049T-Qwg
