37933,2011-02-05,0,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"January 31 2011. Dinner.

We had the Sizzling Rice Seafood Soup first.  The Flavor of the broth and fish was wonderful, however the calamari pieces were as chewy as slices of rubber tire, completely inedible. But alas, don't fret...

The Crispy Fried Chilean Sea Bass with S&P was completely without fault. Absolutely full of flavor, very fresh tasting (and i'm extremely conscience of fish freshness). A large center slice of Seabass. Just lovely.

We also had the Sauteed Prawns in Spicy Sweet and Sour Sauce which was very good.  in addition to the incredible menu choices, they have several live seafood tanks with a variety of seafood; prawns, geoduck, shellfish, other live fish.  

Atmosphere was marred by this random table in the middle of the walkway heading to our booth - this oddly placed table was covered in clean restaurant dishes, glasses, napkins, and brickabrack of things that are usually hidden at the back or behind a divider, not sitting in the middle of the restaurant.  At first glance, I thought they weren't ready for business yet, but there were patrons inside and that table never disappeared. O, well.  The food was reasonably priced and delicious. Definitely recommend.

Lobster and Dungeness crab was 3-4 times more expensive than a normal chinese restaurant - $65 per pound for lobster, I might as well eat at an actual 5 star restaurants in a 5 star casino.  Don't come here unless you want to waste your money.  If you're going to spend this much money, I recommend Blosom restaurant located inside the Aria Casino and Resort.

I had a fried flounder with sweet and sour sauce (the special of the day $22) and honey walnut shrimp.  The honey walnut shrimp was good but lacking for the price.  The flounder was a mess.  It came soaked in cheap, and unpleasant sauce that came straight from a bottle.  I wasn't even surprised when the check came and I was charged $8 more for my $22 flounder because they had used an entire bottle of sweet and sour sauce.  Needless to say I was not happy with being charged $30 dollars for an item I ordered under the clear impression it was $22.  Overall my check came to $56 including a $4 sprite.  If the floors were made of marble and the ambience was that of a 5 star restaurant I could see getting away with this but this is china town off the strip folks!  There are hundreds of amazing ridiculously reasonable Chinese, Thai, and Japanese restaurants in close proximity.  This restaurant is a tourist trap.

167577,2016-01-01,1,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"Just what you would expect from one of the top 50 Chinese Restaurants.

THE FOOD:

Authentic Chinese food and, while not as good as Hong Kong, it is easy to see why CNN rated JH in the USA top 50. It also earned Best Chinese Restaurant by the Las Vegas Review Journal in 2014. Live seafood in the tanks look healthy and vibrant. The wine list is extensive from house wine to Château Lafite.  

Sea Food Wor Won Ton Soup (***  ) 

It is really hard for A Chinese Restaurant to mess this dish up and JH was no exception. While it was above average, it was not exceptional, There was Broccoli in this dish that was cooked just right.   

Imperial Peking Duck (*****)

While the duck was prepared to perfection, this dish got five stars because of what they do with the carcass afterwards: the meat is stripped from the bones and minced then fried in a wok where it takes on a smoky savory flavor, the minced meat looked like it had some scallions in it and was served on lettuce leaves.

Braised Tofu with Salted Fish & Minced Chicken (*****)

Simple yet flavorful soft chunks of tofu with chicken and salted fish. The salted fish is slightly fermented lending an interesting flavor: the flavor was well balanced tho and the fish did not overwhelm the dish as it sometimes can.

Live King Crab (*****)

We had an 8 pound crab (don't know if it was the Alaskan or Australian but it was $69/lb) served two ways: the body (base of the legs) were served with Ginger Scallions and the Carapace and legs were sauteed with butter and garlic. The Ginger Scallions were cooked to perfection and well balanced. The garlic legs had fresh finely diced garlic piled on expertly halved leg sections: I found that the garlic was pretty strong for my taste but simply removing the garlic with a flick of my chopsticks solved that. The presentation was amazing but the portions were cut in such a way that the meat was easy to separate from the shell: well done! 

Live Main Lobster (*****)

Ginger Scallions topped off this monster 7lb lobster and it was cooked to perfection (not over cooked and tender) and well balanced. The presentation was not as good as the crab but this is splitting hairs: so I still gave it 5 stars.

Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce (***  ) 

Like the Wor Won Ton Soup, this dish is hard to do badly. Some places might over cook it but not here; it still maintained some crunch while being tender. Perfect!

Manila Clams - Ginger & Scallions (**** )

Fresh (maybe live it was so delicate) clams cooked just right. Not a stand out for me, but then again, I don't normally eat clams: the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the freshness of the clams was exceptional and delicate. 

Taro Tapioca Soup (*****)

This hidden gem is not on the menu but served as a complimentary desert. small squares of White Taro rest on the bottom while Tapioca floats playfully on top of this milky warm desert soup. would have given it a six if I could!

THE SERVICE:

The Staff (****)

Well groomed and friendly; we were greeted and sat immediately. Not your usual Chinese Food wait staff: well spoken and attentive; beverage refills came quickly with out asking. Dishes were cleared and replaced with clean ones the moment they became cluttered with shells. Soup and wine were expertly served.

The Layout (**** )

The exterior was acceptable but not spotless (hey: this is Chinatown right!?), Live seafood tanks were clean and the animals were healthy and not showing any signs of stress. Tables were well set with clean table cloths and no grime/oil/leftovers on the settings. I knocked off a star for the restrooms (I know that it is bad luck to have a spotless restroom: but I hope a Chinese restaurant will break that tradition one day). Parking was scarce even tho the restaurant was half full (we parked in back).",sev8XAmqrsQeCVZUMk693w,3,1,5,5XwoCE5lOIriKKZDciZOXA

Such was the case in finding Joyful House. We arrived around 5:30 or so and were seated immediately.  Our server came over within 2-3 minutes to ask what we would like to drink and if we wanted water. The drinks and water were returned almost immediately as well as a hot pot of delicious tea. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing our dishes. However, the portions are way too large to be shared by just two people and should be considered food for four, especially is you plan on trying several dishes. We started with pot stickers and they were simply outstanding. We did not realize the dinner was served with a large bowl of steamed rice and ordered combination fried rice, which was excellent, but not necessary. Based on another review we tried the Walnut Prawns which were simply outstanding. We also had Sweet and Sour Pork as out second dish. Way too much food for two people so guess what we are having for lunch today. Next time we will wither go with four people or order a little less food. Initially, prices seemed high, but when we saw the amount of food it was well worth the price. We have started a folder of restaurants we have enjoyed and keep a copy of the menu in there for future reference. Needless to say Joyful House menu has been added.

They do have a fairly extensive menu and the quality of the food is slightly above average (minus the grease).  However, this has got to be one of the more expensive Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.

Pros:  good sea bass but how could anyone mess that up?, beef was really tender, waiter was friendly
Cons: we ordered snow pea leaves and they brought out snow peas, they took it back and brought us the correct dish but ended up charging us for both dishes and we didn't even get to eat the first one they took back, charging 16.95 for a small amount of snow peas is unacceptable, we didn't want to spend time arguing with them so we paid and left but felt it was unethical practice, we will never return! The wonton soup is the worst we ever had also.

I'm originally from LA and we have a lot of amazing ramen places, but this beats them all. Seriously. Shinsengumi? Foo Foo Tei? Not as good as Joyful.

After some gambling and a bit of drinking, the wife and I were craving some off the strip, more afordable Chinese food (yes I lost some dough at the tables that night).
We enter here at about 12:30 am and obviously it is totally empty besides 1 other client. We are seated and start looking through the menu. 

The restaurant itself is pretty big. It has a lively atmosphere with 1 flatscreen TV. They have a decent selection of beer which was cool. We end up ordering the basics wich were Honey Walnut Prawns, Pan Fried Noodles with beef, and fried rice. Huge portions which was prefect since I was starving.

Eveything tasted great. No complaints from us whatsoever. No we were not drunk, so our taste buds were definitely not decieving us. The walnut prawns were addicting, and had to have a fork fight with the wife to grab the last one. She won.

Our waiter was great the entire time. Wich of course he should, being as it was empty.

I had the Half Shell Steamed Oysters with Black Bean sauce, which were absolutely fantastic and fresh. The delivery person arrived there after we had been told they were out of oysters, so these were very very fresh. 

I also had the Crispy Fried Tofu stuffed w/ Shrimp Paste. It came with slices of eggplant as well - and the whole thing was delicious. 

To top it all off, we added some chicken fried rice. My expectations with fried rice are pretty basic, and this easily met those. Fried rice is basically fried rice....it's fairly easy for a good Chinese restaurant to not screw this up.

I was pleasantly surprised by their extensive wine menu. I didn't happen to order a $1,500+ bottle of Petrus nor Lafite, but it was nice to see that was an option. ;)  For those of us who aren't on CEO incomes, they had plenty to choose from, and I opted for a $9/glass Merlot.

Total cost for two people - those three dishes and a glass of wine - was about $40. Bottom line: incredible food, friendly service, and a definite place for repeat visits.",ej3YbX9A-v6THCml1kwp9w,0,0,5,bLtWAYWGmW4vApDfWI7WhQ

For starters I had the Rosy Duck. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the skin was delightfully crisp. The plum sauce was pretty bad...another reviewer described it as ""industrial cleaner""...which I'm sympathetic to. I'd definitely order this again...but will steer clear of the plum sauce. 

For mains, I had the ""Salt and Pepper Pork Chops"" which many reviewers raved about. The batter and spicing/seasoning of the pork was very well done. Quite crisp and a good balance of salt/heat/batter/fat. The pork itself was quite disappointing though...very stringy, low-quality cut of pork. I would have MUCH rather had 1/2 or even 1/4 of the quantity for a better quality of pork.

For dessert I had the chocolate Mochi Ice Cream. It was served far too cold. The ice cream was actually chewy....more than a little. If served a bit warmer, it would have been good i think...the chocolate flavor was decent, the pastry wrapper was nicely done...just the temp.

I think maybe I didn't order the dishes these guys do best...next time I'm going to have to try the fresh seafood. Also, the prices were quite reasonable. Appetizer, entree, dessert, and hot tea for $26 in Vegas..that's a pretty good deal.",X0zK9XkbB5RKHKEu9xWU-g,0,1,3,_D-T1hzQbSQ2sDh8Ew3nRA

- Pork belly with preserved vegetables was terrible, I am not sure how they could even bring themselves to call it that, all the ingredients were there, but it is like they didn't even try to make it properly. It was dry and probably been precooked in the kitchen for a while, have had canned versions that were immensely better than this.
- The salt and pepper pork chop was even worse, the meat itself was flavorless and they didn't even bother to properly spread the seasoning, ending up with a couple pieces over seasoned  and the rest tasteless.
- The eggplant and tofu dish was the only good dish. I am a sucker for crispy outside and silky smooth inside tofu. Eggplant was fried very well, reminds me of what you would get in a fresh dim sum restaurant.

Only SMALL issue I had, was I wished there was more egg, other than that it was absolutely delicious. I ordered sweet and sour pork and my husband ordered sautéed chicken with Portobello mushrooms in a black pepper sauce. The sweet and sour pork was fairly generic, but it was awesome. The pork was still crunchy even with the sauce on top, the onions and bell peppers were sautéed to perfection. An absolute great dish. My husbands chicken dish was off the chain, the mushrooms were in big chunks so you REALLY got a good taste of them, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the pepper sauce was perfect. I expected the pepper sauce to be too spicy (I don't handle spice very well) but it was great! It had a good pepper flavor, but it wasn't over powering or too spicy. A freaking epic dish.

I have to admit we went there twice just to confirm our initial opinion.  Food is not fresh, they lie when they say the fish dish is 50% off. Really??!! $19 for a fried fish.  Do you mean to tell me that the fish was originally $38.  No respectable chinese person would ever pay $38 for a fried fish, even 19 bucks for this low grade, rotten tasting fish. Yuck!  It tasted like it had been sitting in sewer water.  

I also had chow fun, garlic spinach, minced pork with salty fish, roast duck and won ton soup.  The only good dish was the won ton soup. How pathetic!  I could tell the food is not fresh.

We came here because of Yelp reviews and photos other diners took. A caveat, we knew from previous reviews that this would be more ""Americanized"" Chinese than Yunnan Garden, where we ate an awesome meal last night.  But because we were bringing two non-Chinese friends with us, this was more in line with what they considered ""adventurous"" dining.  Our suspicions were confirmed when no chopsticks were present on the table or being used at any of the adjacent tables.   

We ordered the salt and pepper scallops, steamed flounder, Mongolian beef, green beans with minced pork, and snow pea leaf with garlic.  The salt and pepper scallops were pretty good, with a reasonably crisply breading and very hot jalapenos topping them.  One of the two specials was the steamed flounder, and it was very well presented.  However, the fish was unevenly cooked with the lowest half inch of the fish under cooked to the point of still being somewhat gelatinous.  The Mongolian beef was salty and drowning in a gravy-like dark sauce.  The green beans were crisp with a decent amount of minced pork and snow pea leaf with garlic was cooked just right.  The veggies were definitely the best of the bunch. 

Our first waiter was initially very helpful and filled our drink and food orders accurately.  After that, he checked on us twice to refill beers and sodas, and that was it.  The staff was mostly absent for the second half of our meal.   We had to try several times before finally flagging another waiter to get takeout containers and the check.

One of Funniest things I ever heard in my life the owner or maybe not was talking to a couple next to our table saying I require my staff to speak English. Really?  I asked for a jack and coke what came to the table was regular coke. I asked the server what's up? He said we don't have that. I said take the coke away he gave to the couple sitting next to us.  Joyful house! Our shrimp in lobster sauce came out with canned mushrooms strange.  My wife Asian was laughing. She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken. I asked if they had shrimp of pork dumpling he said you can go up the street if you want that. OMG! I said we will try the dumplings how many do you get ?  He said 5 - I said r u sure the menu says 6. He said 5 only. Ok served 6.  Keep in mind we went in early before 5pm to check this place out. I was here 12 yrs ago and it was pretty good.

So I decide to search the Yelp and find Joyful House Chinese restaurant. Am I lucky? The food and service are excellent and no doubt to recommend this place.

My friends and I ordered a steam red big eye fish. The fish is made just right. If you know how to make a traditional Chinese steam fish, you know it is important to have good quality of fish, have to be fresh, and also the timing to steam the fish has to be just right, not too long or too short. We also have the coral shrimp, those shrimps are fresh and  tastes sweet. We also tried the lobster as well - I mean those over 4 lbs lobster. The lobster meat is fresh and tastes very good, can't get it from somewhere else. 

Another dish that we ordered is black bean sauce clams, it is amazingly good. They are juicy, tender and ""big"" as a clam. I never taste such a clam before. As Chinese, we got to order a dish of vegetable - garlic baby bean sprout (the leafy ones.)

As far as the space, as other described, they are spacious and sit comfortably for a big group. Very clean place. Decoration is ok.

The service is excellent. The waiter and waitress all are friendly and answer all our questions. The food is served promptly. They even serve complimentary dessert as well.

Chicken chow fun with gravy, massive plate
Noodles had good chewy, soft texture, sign of freshness.

Chicken moo shoo, pre rolled. Nice!!! Shredded chicken, crunchy cabbage and mushrooms. A tad on the salty side but very tasty

1/2 crispy fried chicken. Well marinated. Not at all gressy. Skin thin and crunchy. Very nicely done.

Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. 

The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet.

1) It's open REALLY late. That's why I went there.

2) They serve sweet Americanized Chinese, sort of a blend of Mandarin and Cantonese styles. The Kung Pao Chicken is a complete joke if you've ever had the real thing, closer to the typical sweet-and-not-very-sour dishes you can find at every bad Mandarin joint in America.

3) They serve the dark, soy-colored fried rice that has generally fallen out of popularity in recent times.

4) The ingredients are fresh; Beef with Broccoli was acceptable. It may be possible to assemble a 3-4 star meal if you can stay away from dishes with sweet glazes.

5) It's a clean, modern place with table cloths and decent furniture. You don't feel threatened by disease when there.

Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put ""choke"" and ""chicken"" in the same sentence).

The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!

Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you ""regular""... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm.

The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was ""decent"".

Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy, not succulent and like they were freezer burned, plus they barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp and gives a ton more walnuts. Or you can go to China Tango Bistro in Summerlin and get a delicious, generous version for only $12! They rip you off here.

Their rice was super hard and dry - I have no clue how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? 

Also, I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic saté chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and sour, not spicy at all. Very disappointing. 

Our 1 dish, rice and a soda was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.

The walnut shrimp that everyone here on yelp raves about was not bad.  Nothing that stood out about it, tasted great, but not to die for.  Also at $16 it's a bit overpriced in my opinion.  It did come with a side of white rice.

However, the fried rice and beef chow fun were great values!  Both came out, and my wife and I realized we would have tons of left overs for the next day or two.  The beef chow fun was super yum.  Fried rice was fried rice, not bad.

Lobster!  Duh.  So there was a small possibility that I might have had a shellfish allergy, but after my 6lb plate of deep fried lobster perfection, I think I can rest easy now.

Man, I had forgotten how great this place is for seafood.  Despite being ""only kinda hungry"" my group of four proceeded to order a 6lb deep fried lobster, XO beans, ong choy, soup, and steamed fish.  

This is one of the best lobsters I've ever had.  Lightly dusted in cornstarch, salt, pepper, and crack(?), then quickly fried to perfection keeping the meat moist and succulent.  The pictures speak for themselves.  Plus they were having a 50% off special on lobster, so our titanic crustacean only cost us $100. 

The only disappointment was the fish, not because it wasn't good, but because we had no idea it cost $59/lb!  That 1.5lb cost us as much as the lobster and wasn't worth it.  Next time we'll be sure to ask how much the fish costs before we order.

2759565,2013-07-22,4,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"Got to try this place finally for the first time. Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.

I gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. 

The Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca. 

Both the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in. 

Service was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.

The main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99. 

All in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out. All I know is be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are paying for a party of 4 or more.

P.S. They don't give out fortune cookies when you get your check and its a 20 dollar minimum to use debit/credit.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,7,5,3,DysAn5rBEmKMj8I331mL-w

It's a very nice restaurant in chinatown complete with live fish, prawns, lobster, and crabs.  We went for takeout so we couldn't really judge the service but the guy that seats you was really nice and helpful.

My coworker recommended the salt and pepper pork chops.  Since I had always been told by my ever-so-seasoned fellow yelper/coworker reggie to always order salt and pepper anything whenever I can, I agreed to try said pork chops.  After about a 15 minute wait, the waiter brought out our food.  It smelled great and I couldn't wait to get home to try it.  I opened up the to-go box and there were small breaded pork chops (some with bone, some without) that had bits of garlic and jalepeno all throughout the dish.  It came with rice as well.  When I dug in I couldn't believe how tender they were.  These pork chops just melted away in my mouth.  The contrast of the jalepeno against the pork was incredible with just the right amount of heat and saltiness.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely go back.  They had a lobster sale while we were there...19.95/lb down from 29.95/lb and these things were monsters!

Joyful House the best we have found yet.  It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive.

Appetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good.  The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful.

Main dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell.  Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef.  The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork.  The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast.

The prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas.

Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).

We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.

I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health.

3014470,2010-02-18,0,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"If ever there was a place away from the strip that offered great Chinese food, this is it. I love eating Chinese food, and the one thing that I use to gauge their greatness is honey walnut shrimp, or walnut prawns. This place has the best honey walnut shrimp in Vegas so far, and I base this on the food from home.

Watch how far you drive down Spring Mountain--this place is right off Decatur and Spring Mountain in a little strip. Although the building is a bright color, at night it is still easy to miss. Parking is a bit tight, but it is worth it!

When you walk in, the Buddha statue is at the entrance with piles of coins from customers on his belly. I always rub his belly when I walk in. The servers are very attentive--and all male--and there is no wait for a table. The menus are easy to read with the set dinners on the very first page, but if you feel adventurous, I would suggest the more foreign dishes to eat. They are truly authentic, serving black fungus and jellyfish, shark fin soup, among other things. Most Americans would never order these dishes, but trust me--you have to try it.

We ate the honey walnut shrimp (obviously), black fungus and season vegetables, braised tofu, wonton noodle soup, and jelly fish. It was all oustanding, all in their right sauces and the vegetables with that nice slight char from the breath of the dragon. The tofu was perfect, and the black fungus was cooked just right. I love cold jellyfish, and this was one of the best that I've had in Vegas.

Overall, the meal was outstanding and reminded me of the Joyful restaurant back home on Guam. We waited four minutes for our food, and everything was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully, and tasted spectacular.

Who says that you have to eat on the strip? Save some money and go to the side streets. You never know what gems you may find.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,3,4,BZHrvB2CIdmiyUAF1a_ATA

I also ordered clams with vermicelli in special sauce as well as walnut pr0nz. The pr0nz were the most expensive, which was $14 bucks.

The clams and vermicelli was way too salty, and there were hardly any vermicelli noodles in it. I appreciate there being a good amount of clams, but unfortunately the sauce was more like a soup.

Wonton Soup (Cantonese style).. kind of blah and bland. I'd opt for the hot and sour instead which was exactly as its named. Perfect. 

Rosy Duck, crisp, duck fatty.. Came with plum sauce which tasted like industrial cleaner.

Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, bone-in thin pork chops deep friend and covered with fried garlic and chilies. This was a hit!

Boiled Chicken with Chives, pretty bland and the garlic ginger sauce was too oily masking most of the flavor.

Combination Pan Fried Noodles, generously covered with shrimp, beef and chicken the dish over all was super goopey and not very appetizing. Opt for Lo Mein next time.

Beef Chow Fun with black bean sauce was good. The beef was silky and tender while the noodles chewy and oily. This was another hit!

My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.

I was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lol

Wonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.

Honey Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batter

Crispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF item

Yang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for that

They give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay! Hits the midnight munchies in Vegas and the food tasted pretty authentic :)",u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ,8,7,4,YBJDjJTc4_rINiSZdtjIPw

(when I made reservations, guy said it might take a minute or two to get seated if others were still at table). The menu was great. They offer 3 options for family style dining, starting at $17.95 per person.  We ordered ""C"" and it was $19.95 PP, and the Kung pao scallops.

With white linens and waiters dressed in suits, it's got an upscale vibe. But, most of the customers seemed to be dressed as casually as me. 

Their menu is massive. It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.

Kung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.

Perfect for large parties, it's also great for families. Kids will love the aquariums full of crabs, lobsters and other future meals.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,3,4,WA2-4MYnW8ojQjJ8JTBm1Q

Yummy noodles, although they were a tiny bit too greasy, and finally a place that serves Sesame Chicken! That was certainly delicious. The server was friendly, though his English was somewhat limited. They also brought a pot of tea to the table, I guess it was complementary because they didn't charge for it, and the table settings already had tea cups at them.

I'm sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story""...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.

Once we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.

So the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn't look like a high over-head ""Asian Fusion"" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it's simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny's.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)

Oh My God...    Come HUNGRY

Out comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.   

Next egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm

Ok now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there's more

Two more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.    

Listen if you're looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.   

I've read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....

Have you ever wanted a 10 course Asian banquet for a wedding for 125 guests?  You have 2 options: 1) Choose to have the wedding at an Asian restaurant, where you are limited with the restaurant capacity and limited floor space for dancing or 2) Find a restaurant to cater the Asian food in the venue of your choice.  

I selected option 2.  I went to several Asian restaurants to see if they had the capacity to perform the duties.  Most of the Asian restaurants in Las Vegas were very poor on communication and none of them would return my phone calls even after constant reminders of having their restaurant provide me a quote list of the dinner items and an agenda on how they will be able to perform the function.  All of them failed miserably on the capacity test except for Joyful House.  Joyful House was the ONLY restaurant that had the means to cater in the food.   


They have 2 very helpful managers willing to provide constant communication to make sure your Asian catering and wedding event is a success.  High 5's to both Dell and Stanley.  They are truly amazing and made my wedding planning so easy.  

Here is why:

1) They are extremely good at constant communication.  I am ABC, so they speak good English.
2) Planning - I would give them a 100 out of 10 in terms of their planning skills.  Chef Yau, Dell and Stanley went to Havana Room at the Tropicana Hotel and met with the Director of Catering.  They laid out the entire inventory items of plates, forks, dinner platters, etc.  They make things look so smooth, yet there were so many complexities in performing the catering job.  Joyful House brought in all the raw materials, tea cups, tea pots, soy sauce, etc. and cooked everything fresh in Tropicana's kitchen.  
3)Food Quality - I would give them a 100 out of 10.  We had a lot of Asian food connoisseur's in our guest list and I got nothing but raving reviews.  There is a reason why CNN ranked Joyful House as Top 50!  Their specialty is Honey Walnut Shrimp.  My guests were extremely happy about all of the food quality.  Joyful House delivered above and beyond on their quality of food.  The food was so darn good that my guests kept asking for more food than what I originally ordered.

3875619,2011-05-06,0,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"What a nice way to end a busy day of running errands in the Vegas heat. My best friend, her family and I came here around 10:30pm. It had been ages since my last visit (I think I was 10 years old or so) ,so I couldn't exactly remember what the food tasted like, but at the moment I was up for anything in the Chinatown area. 

We ordered: 

Cream of Chicken and Corn Soup- pretty standard soup. It reminded me of egg flower soup with cream of corn. I don't know if I'd order this again because it wasn't anything special. I think I'd prefer won ton soup over this. 


Beef & Broccoli- I was a little skeptical about ordering this dish because I always try to order things that you can't get at other places. This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants. Beef was chewy and tender, while the stems of the broccoli was soft. The sauce was typical and there was a perfect amount to moisten the dish up and I'm tough critic when it comes to dryness. I couldn't believe at how much the dish amazed me as if it was my first time trying it. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp- one of my all time favorites at any Chinese restaurants. Joyful House will not disappoint because theirs definitely meets the standards. The batter of the shrimp was the perfect thickness, good ratio of shrimp to walnut and the mayonnaise glazed the entire dish perfectly. Loved this! 

Steamed Flounder- just as good as it is anywhere else. My dad also cooks this at home and now I honestly don't find this dish as amusing as I did before. But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae. On another note, the fish came with all the bones intact and the server meticulously de boned the entire fish at the table. I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story). My best friend and I both chatted about how it was our first time experiencing such an art. Apparently all Chinese restaurants are suppose to do this. 

Thank you Joyful House! I was so caught up with the hype of other Asian cuisines from sushi to banh mis that I had forgotten the Chinese were the first to make a good impression on Americans. No wonder, your food is absolutely delicious and will always be considered the Asian classic.

Sizzling beef tenderloin mignon with satay sauce.  Did not taste like mignon beef.  I had to cut the pieces of beef into smaller pieces to make it less chewy.  The satay sauce was not spicy and very salty.

Mapo tofu tasted too sour.  It had way too much pickled peppers and not enough spice.  The consistency was also thick and almost slime-like.

Crispy pan fried noodle with beef was ok.  The beef texture was almost the same as the mignon beef, but just a little thinner.  It also tasted like they cooked it in a pan that they had just cooked something with seafood in it and did not wash the pan.

4044800,2013-04-08,1,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"Yum! I'm not a huge lover of true Asian food - for example, my favorite Chinese food is served at Panda Express. Despite my best intentions, I typically balk at the stuff people actually eat in places like Vietnam and Taiwan. You can understand why I was a little leery of venturing to a Chinese place on Spring Mountain for dinner with my coworkers the other night, especially when it was recommended by the Taiwanese guy! I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out. 

The restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.

Speaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:

Garlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend.
Mandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave.
Sizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu).
Clay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good.
Seafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave.
Clay pot eggplant - good not great.
Pork fried rice - standard.
String beans with pork - good not great.
Appetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that.
Tapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it.
Lemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.
 
Prices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.
 
Any time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.

It ranges from roasted duck, fried shrimp, pork, and veggies that you can pick from. It comes with an egg roll and another fried app, looking like a samosa. It also comes with a free drink all for $10!

That being said I probably won't be returning for 2 reasons. 1) food 2) service

The food I ordered was the salt n pepper fried shrimp lunch special and a salt n pepper fried pork a la carte. The shrimp was good 4/5 nothing spectacular but could order again. The fried pork was terrible. The flavor was there, however 3/4 of the pieces was just fried fat. Barley any meat in any of the pieces 1/5. The egg roll wasn't great 1/5. Samosa was pretty good 4/5. There was also a corn soup and I was super hyped! I love Asian corn soup, unfortunately it was luke warm and too gooey I believe there was too much corn starch added in it.

Service. I sat down and the waiter was friendly (probably the only good part of service). I had to ask for the lunch special menu, maybe because I came late they didn't have it on the table. Then I went to order and looked around the room my waiter was busy and there was a waitress available. We made eye contact then went on her phone... I also had to ask from some condiments, like vinegar. It goes great with fried foods!  My waiter pretty much never checked on me until I asked. I had to ask him to come over 4 times. 1 for lunch special 2 to order 3 to get vinegar 4 for the check.

Perhaps I had an attitude too.  We called to inquire whether it was a BYOB.  Sure....if you pay $32 PER BOTTLE.  Their only wine offering  was ""Red House wine"" or ""white house wine"" for $8.95 per glass.  ""I'll have water and tea""..

The shrimp wonton soup has great hong kong style flavor, the noodles are al dente, and the wontons are shrimpy and delicious. The server comes to the table to serve and portion the noodles and wonton for each person on the table (they keep it fair whenever possible). 

On another occasion, I came in with my mom and she noted how good and flavorful the white rice was. I don't really eat white rice much, but apparently it's a big deal to traditional Chinese folk. I think they think if the restaurant can't get the rice right, then what does that say about the rest of their food. 

Since moving out here, I miss my mom's soups/elixers and to get a taste of home, I like to order their house soup. This is on the menu but it's usually some traditional soup that Chinese families cook at home. Nothing like Egg drop, Westlake or Hot and Sour soup. It's usually a combination of chicken and pork broth based with herbs and vegetables. Generally it's good for your body or health, but it depends on which soup.

As soon as we walked in we were seated very quickly with menus and hot tea. At the start of the menu there is 3 dinner servings with a easy simple courses if you don't want to think to hard or simply are not sure what you want.

I selected the number 1 serving. With soup, massive plate fried rice and another plate with noodles. I can't 100% tell you what was in all the dishes but I can tell you they were pretty good with a decent serving.

Joyful house has a great seafood selection with a lot of  live crabs and lobsters swimming in the tanks on the rear wall. Although a speciality I didn't get to try any. But with other yelpers reviews it shows that it maybe something worth coming back to.

The Peking duck was a bit disappointing as the skin was not as flavorful and crispy and the man who filleted the skin did not do a very good job.

4447929,2017-03-16,8,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"I was restaurant hopping with a friend a few months back and we came by Joyful House to share a few appetizers. He was familiar with this restaurant and as I've never been - insisted this be one of our stops. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious and clean! We were seated right after walking in and served tea and waters. We wanted light seafood and went with the following: 

- Salt and Pepper Shrimp
Whole shrimp with the head and shell still on. Simple in flavor but very tasty! My friend would just pop the whole shrimp in his mouth but I prefer to peel and de-head mine. I was convinced to try one whole after staring at its eyes for a good while. I came to the conclusion that I would still prefer peeling mine 

- Steamed Oysters in Black Bean Sauce
Oh. My. Goodness. No words for how bomb these oysters were. We got 4 total and they were doused in a black bean sauce, topped with scallions, a ton of minced garlic (I love garlic), and cilantro. The oysters were so full of flavor and incredibly enjoyable. I've never tasted oysters prepared like this before (I usually order oysters raw) and could easily devour a half dozen of these!

- Spicy Manila Clams 
We had a sizzling hot pot come out with clams and veggies in a flavorful sauce/broth. It was a little spicy but the heat wasn't overpowering. I personally love clams so I easily helped devour our hot pot 

I thought the seafood dishes here were great. I love Sichuan Chinese food but I also enjoy and appreciate Cantonese style Chinese food. Tasty Chinese cuisine and no complaints about the service. If you decide to check out Joyful House I highly recommend the steamed oysters in black bean sauce!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,12,10,4,XAt9lO65ow3S461u3Q2pBw
4448149,2017-08-29,3,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"After a long day of driving from Albuquerque and hitting stops all over Arizona, we finally make it to Vegas. At 23:00, not a lot of places off the strip were open, but fortunately Joyful House was there to help appease our hunger.

We were loopy, tired, and exhausted. So we quickly got to ordering here at this fairly large Cantonese seafood restaurant in Chinatown.

My friend and I decided to split three different dishes, all of which were about $12 for the plate for family style:

1. Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken - often served at Chinese banquets, this dish was pretty good with its thinly fried skin and white meat chicken. I thought it could've used a bit more flavor but it wasn't bad.

2. Crispy Salt Pepper Pork Chops - these are some of my favorite to order at Chinese restaurants and these were simply okay here at Joyful. Lacked a bit of punch.

3. Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce - great veggie selection with drizzled hoisin right on top. You really can't go wrong with this option.

At $12 a plate, it is a bit pricy compared to most other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The only exception would be the chicken, but given that it was only a decent meal, I probably wouldn't necessarily come back unless they really amped up the flavor in their food.

After the initial kinks were knocked out, the food won out, as did some hands-on attention by Gary, the manager/(owner?).  I can understand why the guy sitting next to me on the plane last week heartily recommended Joyful House.

We started with Hot and Sour soup, at first dismayed by the price, but after hubby had four bowls (to my 2 1/2), the quantity and quality made up for it:  it's gotta be the best Hot and Sour in the Valley!

We shared a Chicken & Portobello Mushroom, also delicious, and also a String Bean with Minced Pork that would have been fabulous if I had only remembered to ask for ""no extra salt.""  Gary offered to remake the dish, but we kept it, since it was really good despite my anti-salt crusade.

We came here for lunch. They have a wide variety of items on the menu to choose from but it was just only the 3 of us, so we limited ourselves to choosing 5 items. 

We ordered chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, steamed vegetables, and hot and sour soup. 

I love that you can customize your order to your taste. We told the waitress if the chef can add more garlic and chili paste to our order and it was honored without hesitation. It is probably the best Chinese food I've had in Nevada. 

Prices are affordable. It's definitely very inexpensive for what you would pay at a fancy Chinese restaurant on the strip. And the food is customizable to your taste. 

The staff was very polite and courteous. The reason for my 1 star deduction: The service was a little slow. It definitely took longer for someone to notice us when we needed assistance at our table.

My family and I used to dine here frequently in 2013, however, visits were tainted by inconsistent food quality. Eventually, and admittedly influenced by terrible SNHD ratings, I stopped coming here altogether.

Fast forward to December 2016. Prompted by my parents' yearning to dine here, I decided to give Joyful House another chance, hoping that the time gave them the opportunity to improve. This initial return visit was promising! We ordered all our usual favorites, Kung Pao Shrimp, Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Calamari, Mapo Tofu, Black Bean Chinese Broccoli with Chicken, and a new dish, Combination Hong Kong-Style Crispy Noodles. Everything was great! The food was as I remembered and it was a fine experience.

About a month later, my family wanted to eat Chinese food, so we figured we'd go back to JH based on our recent experience. This time, there were six of us, so on top of everything we ordered last time, we also got an additional dish (I honestly can't remember because it was so unmemorable!). First, the food didn't taste the same; it was distinctively worse! Second, the portions were really awkward. The tofu in the Mapo Tofu only covered half of the plate (Note: The same plate was used for this dish during every one of my visits) and there was substantially less shrimp in the Kung Pao Shrimp (again, it didn't even cover the normal plate!). I'm not a stranger to restaurants trying to discreetly cut portions, but this seemed suspicious. So, I decided to inquire...

Me: It seems to be less food... there's nothing here... *pointing to the empty sections of the dishes*
Server: It's the same.
Me: But, it's not. We were just here last month. We ordered the same food and there was a lot more of it.
Server: You must have ordered two of it.
Me: Uhh, no we ordered just one like always.

The man denied the portions being smaller and insisted that our previous dish had more food because we ORDERED TWO. Umm, WTF? Nevermind the overall ridiculous nature of this comment, why would you put two servings of a dish on a plate that is meant for one serving of that same dish??

Needless to say, I AM NEVER GOING BACK. It's obvious people don't think before they speak as conversations like this accomplish nothing. But regardless, the gamble on their food quality is just not worth the trouble.

4877636,2014-02-21,0,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,"Well, first off, we found that Chinatown in Las Vegas is nothing like Chinatown in San Francisco. It is a bunch of shops and mini-malls spread out along about a two-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road, west of the I-15.

Joyful House has been listed as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but in my opinion it's not THE best. 

My wife and I and two high-school girls from Shanghai tried it out the other afternoon for an early dinner, and they, at least, seemed to think the food was somewhat authentic. We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.

They ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good. 

Serving sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.

We could have ordered a bit less and still fed one homeless person, but we got out the door for $95 (including tip) and thought it was quite a bit better than the typical Chinese place.",2BCuFxAkQD9PFobJOKhcLQ,0,0,4,3wqksxWo5tYlU-ie_dljjw

They have a large selection of live seafood to choose from, all coming from the tanks they have in the middle of the restaurant.  A sign acts as the menu with the prices for the fresh fish and seafood of the day.  They have different sized lobsters, crab, snapper, sea bass, and many others.  Seafood is not all they do well, though.  

The Mongolian Beef is very good, as well as the Pork Chops with Salt & Pepper.  I also really like their Roasted Duck, which is a huge portion that serves a lot of people.  I usually try to come to Joyful House with a lot of people because their portions are large, making it a very affordable feast for lots of hungry people.  

The prices are a about a dollar more per item than most Chinese restaurants in the area, but it's worth it with the quality of food you get from Joyful House.  The price might also be attributed to the nicer ambiance you get here.  The waiters are professionally dressed, and the decor is fancier than most places.  The tables are well set, and the plates and silverware are even of good quality.

Still, our dishes were good. We had:

Salt and pepper calamari -- your standard Chinese restaurant fare, good with tons of garlic

Fried veggie rolls -- I would've preferred these rolled in beancurd sheets, but what the hell

Shrimp with broccoli was nice, shrimp were plump, large and snappy.

Peking duck -- this was sad as there was a measly piece of duck in a huge bao 

Black pepper steak with portabello mushrooms -- strange combination but what the hell, it was good

Steamed flounder -- okay I mean I order this dish often and it rarely runs more than $10-$12 a pop so don't sell it as something expensive PLEASE!

Stir fried green beans -- this was done really well with bits of preserved turnip greens in it. LOVED it.

Braised duck E-fu noodles -- okay, epic fail because these were not E-fu noodles. They looked and tasted more like regular egg noodles. I was so damn disappointed because I love E-fu noodles and these were not it.

At the end of the day, this meal did not constitute $50/head even with a few bottles of wine and beer thrown in. PUH-LEEZ! Only about 30% of the people had drinks. I think I was more upset that it was $50/head.

Last Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.

We were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.

As they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.

Everything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back: 

* octopus balls
* beef balls
* pork balls
* wontons
* dumplings
* chicken
* beef
* pork
* squid
* mussels
* shrimp
* napa cabbage
* spinach
* bok choy
* tofu
* tofu sheets
* flat rice noodles
* vermicelli noodles

I'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.

For dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.

Service was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.

BBQ Combination Platter 1/2 size: This was my favorite along with the duck, I probably would have just gone with the full order and just taken off something else we ordered, the dish comes with fried chicken, jelly fish, pork loaf slices, meat loaf slices, and cha shu pork. 
Honey Walnut Shrimp: Disappointing portion size, there was literally like 7 pieces of shrimp on there.....for $16 bux? Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish.
Clams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants.
Steamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce.

Beef Chow Fun in Soy Sauce for $9.95.  Really flavorful, love the chow fun noodles, super soft with green onions.

Crispy Salt and Pepper Pork Chops for $10.95.  They said it was hot but it's not as hot as I thought.  There were jalapenos and red peppers.  This was AH-MAZE-ING.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, batter was crispy and nice marbelized ratio.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT DISH.  

General Chow Chicken for $10.95.  Lots of flavor, great batter, included carrots and peas.  The sauce was a little too salty for me but if you like oyster, soy and other sauces combined, get this dish.

Crispy Fried Lemon Chicken for $10.95.  People, I have FINALLY found the perfect lemon chicken dish in Vegas.  The chicken was crispy, the lemon sauce was perfectly made and this dish made my meal!  

Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper for MKT PRICE.  PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONFIRM THEIR PRICE.  We kept asking the server the price and it sounds like she was saying $6.95 and we kept asking her, however it turned out to be $16.95 and threw us for a loop when the check came.

My mom loves this place. For this latest visit, it was a family affair. I don't know how weird this sounds. For I, upon walking into Joyful House, the ambiance feels like how I'm used to a chinese restaurant feeling like. I will admit the food is slightly pricier here. To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which not every place would have. Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea. Even though most chinese restaurants serve these 2 items complimentary, it is worth mentioning since I am aware some places charge for them.

Chicken Chop Suey was average. Not bad, but nothing special.

The Honey Roasted Walnut Shrimp never goes wrong. Ever.

I normally really like the Beef Chow Fun here, but I remember it was pretty salty this past time. They could work better on controlling their salt actually on other dishes as well.

""That was really good.  What was it?"" asks my Midwest white friend

""Spicy jellyfish with bean curd"" is my straight face response.

""Huh?  So what is this?"" he stupidly continues.

""Um, sea cucumber with abalone""; again straight faced.

""What?!?"" With great exasperation in his voice.

""And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin"".

""I think I'm going to be sick"" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the ""Best of Vegas"" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, ""Peeking duck"", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Hands down the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. 

Sweet & Sour Shrimp: spot on, shrimp was cooked perfectly.
Fried Whole Fish: It's like a deep fried fish chip. Delicious.
Honey Walnut Shrimp: Light on the mayo, perfectly cooked.
Fried Crispy Tofu w/ Shrimp Paste: Probably my favorite dish, the dipping sauce is to die for.

Anyways, those are the dishes I've tried and all have been great.
My only qualm with this place is the prices are just a tad bit more than what I'm used to in California, but hey it's worth it!",nwnF2xOWZbdp_8Z3TT29Yw,5,1,5,_zLnRQPFmJ6vnT_ED9XnLw

I think the average entree was about $10-11, with large sharing portions.  Everything was cooked well and it's one of the better Chinese restaurants in town IMO.  Here is a pic of everything we ordered :

We tried their salt and pepper shrimp (shells), which were cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  One of the better ways I've had it.

Tried the salt and pepper pork since everyone was saying great things about it....it was also very good!  Nice crispy pieces of pork with a light breading around it.  It had lots of flavor and a little spice to back it up.

The half duck was good and flavorful.  I haven't had duck for a little while, so it really hit the spot.

We tried the garlic eggplant, which was good, but a little mushy for me.  The flavor was there, just not my favorite way to eat eggplant.

They are open very late, 3am every night, so this will really hit the spot for late night cravings!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,2,2,4,khKNa-6yMMbK0fXvn7hFlQ

Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.

We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.

Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. 

The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.

The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.

The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.

The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.

Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.

This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.

1. Salt & pepper calamari: 5/10- small portion and barely seasoned with salt and Pepper.
2. Bokchoy & mushroom: 7/10- huge portion and great entree as a side dish.
3. Whole duck: 10/10- very huge portion for about $24, can feed up to five people and we'll crisp with juicy flavors, definetly worth it.
4. Fish maw soup: 8/10- serving for 3 people. Must add some soy sauce for more flavors. Really liked it. 

Not much to complain about this place it's just a little disappointing with their prices but the whole duck made up for my visit here. Had some leftovers for me to to take home and enjoy for dinner.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,1,1,4,lIghN0FATnixq3_ssnXw1g
5625162,2018-05-23,0,jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg,Definitely don't order the General chicken. It's very heavily breaded and they used peas instead of broccoli. Asked for hot spicey and they only put 1 chili pepper by itself. Wonton soup was good but on the bland side. The wontons in the soup were excellent however large bowl so you need to share. They can't accommodate different soups in small bowls like we asked for.  Overall disappointed as they have a sign best of Vegas 2014. Maybe they got a new chef.,8ckcmcpqeSGeahw5v_jq3w,0,0,2,FFt3guIyb7vyjgybTRfmhA

It was about 9:30 when we strolled in - understandably, the place was deserted.  They tried to seat us directly in front of the entrance but were quite accommodating when we asked for a table more out of the way.  

Prices are higher here, compared to your typical Chinese/HK style seafood restaurant.  Portions are skimpy...but the food sure tasted delicious!  

We ordered 6 dishes plus a 1.5 order of the fish maw and crab meat soup which worked out perfectly for all of us.  
Scallop w/ Snow Pea - taste was good but the scallops were scarce
Salt/Pepper Pork Chops - good tasty, not-as-greasy version
Salt/Pepper Flounder Filets - great batter, very light and airy...a big hit with our table
Clay Pot shrimp pasted-stuffed tofu with eggplant - again, it worked out to 6 pieces of tofu and 5 pieces of eggplant.  but I could eat the sauce for days.
Chinese broccoli sauteed in garlic - some of you know that Chinese broccoli can be old and tough.  But this dish used greens which turned out to be very tender and perfectly seasoned
Clams in black bean sauce - probably the least remarkable of the dishes.  A number of the clams were cracked (did they drop them from high above into the wok???) and the sauce could have used a few more black beans.

Service was attentive, possibly because there were only 2-3 tables occupied by the time things got rolling for us.  The bus boy was on top of the tea and rice and our dishes came out long before our stomachs started roiling from hunger.

This was a great meal and helped to drive away the sting of losing at roulette...as well as the cold weather outside.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,5,2,4,yQf-HUySvi4-enWuAkpZmg

Salt and Pepper Pork Chops - SO delicious! Small pieces of pork that are breaded and fried. They are served with some salt and peppers for just the nicest hint of spice. Seriously you must try these!

Beef Chow Fun w/ Soy Sauce - Nice thick noodles in a savory brown sauce. The most perfect Chinese noodle dish.

We also enjoy the sesame chicken (although not the best I have had), Mongolian beef, and the sauteed sliced chicken with cashew nuts. Definitely some great food, although they have shark fin soup on the menu which really irks me, tisk tisk Joyful House. Such a deplorable practice (stepping off soap box).

I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.

First of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  

I was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.

Our meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.  Maybe.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,1,4,Y0JTa4_mfWOxN_eMgemdmA

There was a special on flounder so we decided to try it steamed with soya sauce and Chinese wine and ginger, garlic and green onion for $19.95.  Such delicate taste.  

The other dish to die for is the Rosy Duck - 1/2 order - skin so crispy and the meat so tender.  

We also ordered the braised tofu and black mushrooms with choy sum.   Good dish.

Also, Chinese brocolli or kai lan with garlic - very green and fresh with loads of garlic!
