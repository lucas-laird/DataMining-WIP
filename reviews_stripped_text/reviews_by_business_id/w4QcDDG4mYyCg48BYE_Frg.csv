If you're like me and you're new to eating raw or if raw food isn't exactly your scene, there's plenty for you to enjoy without having to try anything new. Their extensive list of 28 smoothies doesn't disappoint. These hearty meals in a cup can be a great breakfast on-the-go!! At Go Raw, they don't filler your drinks with ice and syrup, it's all 100% pure organic ingredients....and it's good too!! Don't be scared, you don't have to be a hippie or adopt an Eastern philosophy to find something here you like. In short, give it a try!!",uVayJd_bVWq3AAwvUE7Qmg,1,1,5,sCACDGHiRQjx57EowyTOkg

I had the "" cheeseburger "" and ""fries"" (which are coated avocado slices) and enjoyed them both. What's more both my husband and I had a very filling meal, weren't hungry later and had plenty of energy. The next morning I didn't seem to have the crankiness I often wake up with. This was also the first raw food that didn't sink to the bottom of my stomach and lie there. There is no atmosphere at this place and the service is minimal. There will also be no hot food. And the food will be nothing like what you might expect, but it is quite tasty, very satisfying and, for one who tries to eat very little wheat flour, it's fun to just be able to order anything I want.",O5bw4dp0EjXM2dJNtNcSsQ,1,1,4,7yeJ8dtxecdwk3CyLLcKAg
79990,2007-02-01,1,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Amazing raw vegan restaurant and juice bar.  They have raw versions of dishes like cheeseburgers, meatloaf, fries, lasagna, etc... all made with raw fruits, veggies, nuts and grains.  They don't exactly taste like the originals, but you won't care when you taste them!  It is all so delicious and you can just feel all the good enzymes flowing through your body after you've eaten.  Beautiful presentation- each dish looks like a colorful art work.  I would reccommend just about anything on the menu but lately I love the veggie wrap.  If you're not so adventurous, just try their house salad- it's the bomb.  

One thing is the staff always seem hesitant to bring water if you ask for it!  On multiple occasions they just haven't brought the water I ordered.  Maybe it's because drinking with a meal is supposed to be bad for digestion and they don't want to encourage it?  But, if you order one of their fresh juices, of course they'll bring that.  There always seem to be different people working there everytime I come in, too, not many familiar faces.  But the food is always excellent.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get; expect to spend 7 to 15 bucks.

They also have a little store area where you can buy books about healthy eating, vitamins and herbs, raw and vegan snacks and more.  And, while you eat, you can gaze out at the beautiful ""lake""... make sure to check out the lego house right across!

Such a treat to have a place like this in Vegas, especially after living in Berkeley and getting used to having tons of healthy vegan places to eat.",2WniIUDY7MqU1rNL1nwolQ,6,3,5,yJtRvO2fDyXf_M5fFb2qgg

I'm back, and it's just as awesome as I remembered.  Although I'm on yet _another_ cleanse, I broke down and had a lot of food as mentioned above and below.  I sampled the pizza thing - the crust was a flat bread made with almonds and seeds, finally a bread without buckwheat!  I also had their desserts, WOW.  The dark chocolate heart with almonds and currants, to die for and I don't like chocolate and I'm allergic...eek.  I also had the fudge which is really nuts and seeds in a bar, sweet and lovely.  Filling, and still eating some now.  Fabulous.

A double bonus is that they soak all their nuts and seeds for easier digestibility and absorption and less fattening! =)  Yes, ladies we can enjoy a little and not feel too guilty.

Everything is fresh and made on the spot.  The staff are so friendly, just love them.  It's not your upscale place like NYC's Pure Food and Wine, but the food and people are great.

I love their variety of juices and smoothies, and the ones I've tried have all been quite good. Yes it is on the pricier side but they also offer half orders on a handful of their dishes (still a lot of food) and, I mean, what do you expect?

496176,2011-01-15,0,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"The first thing I will say about this place is that you have to be open-minded when you go into it!  I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I came here and I'd never had raw vegan food, so it sounded as boring to me as it probably does to you right now as you look up whether or not it's worth going out of your way for.  In addition, it's in the very back corner of a small strip mall by a ""lake"" in northwest Las Vegas.  However, as soon as I saw the ""People Love Us on Yelp!"" sticker on the front door, I knew it would be better than my expectations (which, to be quite honest, I didn't have many upon my arrival).

It was completely empty inside except for a couple of staff members, and it was a nice, cozy atmosphere with some beautiful art on the walls, a small little raw food snack store of sorts (more like a little closet than anything) and a little room of food-based books, natural oils, etc.  It was fun to look at all of these items as I waited for my food.

As far as the food itself, I was very impressed by the Vegi-cotti.  It was full of flavor and tasted better than any manicotti I've had in a long time.  The Vegi-cotti was served with a side of ""pasta primavera"" which was also amazingly flavorful, fresh, and the texture was excellent.  The price was also quite reasonable considering the amount and quality of the food (it's about what you'd pay at any other restaurant in the Las Vegas area for a meal - about ~$10/plate). The only thing I wasn't really expecting was just how dense the food ended up feeling.  I ate the entire plate (I got the half order) and that may not have been the best decision - but it was delicious and I couldn't help myself!

They also have a ""raw makery"" where they make their own raw ""baked"" goods of sorts.  These are kind of pricey, but also very tasty.  I got the ""yam yum"" cookie ($2.88), and was not disappointed.  It tasted kind of like a spicey pumpkin pie in a chewy cookie form.

I was really excited to find this little place as options for vegan dining are rather slim in Vegas. 

Food was okay... Had the lasagna and it was an interesting blend of flavors that became somewhat overpowering towards the end. 

Portion sizes were WAY too small and the price was WAY TOO MUCH. 

The biggest disappointment was the service. Upon walking in I found the employees sitting together at a table in the back and had to ask if it was ""seat yourself"". After a few minutes I was asked if I was ready to order... Wasn't asked if I wanted anything to drink... Just asked if I was ready to order. 

Once I got my food it was as if I was forgotten as I never was approached by any of the 3 employees working for nearly 20 minutes. 

I finally had to get up and ask for a refill on my tiny 8 oz glass of water. 

When it came time to pay the server literally stood next to my table until I filled out my debit cars slip and signed it and then she immediately took it off the table and disappeared never to be seen again.

I knew I was going to be in Vegas for several weeks and Go Raw was on my radar even before I arrived.  I have to say, I was disappointed on so many levels.  When we arrived for lunch at the cafe no one greeted us although we saw 2 employees when we walked in.  We kinda just stood there and lingered not really knowing what to do.  So I asked the guy if we should have a seat and he said yes.  So we went and sat down.  And waited and waited and waited and waited.  Finally, we got back up and when back to the counter we started at and asked if we could go ahead and order.  Seriously.  How awkward.  At this point my husband said he had already seen/experienced enough and decided not to order anything (turns out, smart move). I, of course, held out hopes that things would improve and ordered the beet burger.  Not good.  Why in the world they would place soft ingredients (the beet burger was soft and mushy) inside a hard shell (flax seed bread)?  With each bite all the ingredients would squirt out the other side and I spent the entire meal with food squeezing out between my fingers and all over the place.  In addition, before even taking my first bite I had to pick out all the spoiled lettuce.  And when I say spoiled I mean brown and mushy.  GROSS.  GROSS.  GROSS.  The flavor of the burger wasn't good.  Too many odd flavors mushed together.  And I'm pretty sure the tomato ketchup was spoiled because it talked back to me all day and night and even started coming up (sorry) when I went to bed.

The menu at Go Raw resembles most american restaurants.  They have sandwiches, salads, smoothies, ""burgers,"" etc.  The ingredients, however, are a bit different.  For example, the ""living bread"" used for the burgers and pizzas is not really bread, and it's alive (but dehydrated -- it's not crawling around your plate).  Go Raw also does not use animal products whatsoever, so, their ""sour dream"" ain't your grandma's sour cream (meaning no cows involved).

My go-to favorites are the Purple Burrito, purple cabbage wrapped around veggies, guacamole and and salsa. Soo tasty and healthy.  I also love the Mexicali Sampler which allows you to taste several entrees such as the Enchiladas, Mexi Toast, Flax Crax, and Mexi Wrap.   If you're looking for safe bets, try the pizzas, sandwiches, or ""burgers.""  

I may sound like a total wacko, but, whenever I eat at Go Raw, I feel totally energized for the rest of my day.  I love bloody, bloody meat but I get why the raw foodists swear by this stuff.

My only criticisms are that the food is crazy salty and the food takes forreeevvverr to get.  I realize the saltiness is probably to make up for the fact that nothing is cooked, but, damn, I drink a lot of water after eating here.  Regardless, Go Raw is great for someone looking for healthy food that is actually delicious as well.

The interior is small and divided into three parts: the dining area, the kitchen and the gift shop.  We figured out that we were to grab a menu and seat ourselves, so we sat by the window (through the blinds you have a view of the lake) and took our time looking over all of our options.  We both ordered smoothies (strawberry/banana/dates and coconut/banana/dates with something else that I can't remember) which were great.  

For our meals, my husband ordered the Mediterranean wrap: all sorts of tasty things wrapped up in collard greens.  I ordered the purple burrito - it is not what I was expecting, but I ate all of it: half a purple cabbage filled with hummus and other things.  All raw.  All good, but maybe it was too dense for one dish as I had a hard time digesting that meal.  I think that specific combination of dense raw foods combined with fruit was wrong for me personally.  The way we combine certain raw foods is something I never thought about before, and I didn't realize there were so many food theories regarding this topic.  All very interesting.  I will be more mindful of this in the future.

The gift shop offered a selection of books, vegan health bars and other vegan products.  Since the food does take time to prepare, it was nice to be able to get up and browse for awhile.

However, the fact that a co-worker and I who had essentially the same meal both got sick in the same way tells me there's a serious problem here - even if it only happened once and we were the only people to ever get ill.

On August 5, I went here with three other co-workers.  It was not my idea, but I encouraged us all to go because I'm into juicing and otherwise trying to be healthy.  I had the mexi-wrap, with others having the portobello wrap, the faux tuna sushi, and the neatloaf.  The food itself was okay, but I can't give an honest assessment of it because it's now mentally associated with how sick it made me.

The co-workers who had the neatloaf and sushi were fine.  Later in the day, the co-worker who had the portobello wrap developed a bad headache, and I believe some stomach pain as well, and left work earlier than normal.  He later told me that he ended up having terrible light sensitivity and vomiting.

Later that night, I was the sickest I had been since the middle of college (for reference, I'm an '07 grad).  I'll spare the details, but it was terrible, and kept me up much of the night.  Worse, I was almost totally incapacitated the next day.  I barely had the energy to get around my apartment, let alone get to the office.  I did about a combined hour of work that day at home.

In fairness, I didn't get a medical examination to conclude that it was the food at Go Raw that made me sick.  But, it is an incredible coincidence that both my co-worker and I, who had meals there that had common ingredients (including the collard greens the wraps are made with), got sick at almost the same time in nearly the exact same way.  Based on my conversation with him, Go Raw was the only out-of-the-ordinary thing he ate that day. I know it was the same for me.  I'm not a food scientist, but when two people have nearly identical symptoms right after doing the same out-of-the-ordinary activity, I think the evidence points to that meal making them sick.  While food sickness can happen anywhere and to anyone, the circumstances of me and my co-worker both getting so sick, so acutely, and in such a brutal way, leads me to believe that this is more than my stomach simply not agreeing with something.

It is worth noting that my other co-workers who went did not get sick.  Based on these Yelp reviews, apparently a lot of people enjoy and have had good experiences at Go Raw.  I hoped to be one of them, but I am not.",VYS2Cn4BhdiOOYuVvmPWIg,4,4,1,l6yQ_n7g_WEit7lDbZCUcQ

1162067,2010-12-03,0,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Let me start by saying I that I sometimes choose to eat a vegetarian diet.  I sometimes consume meat, but try to keep it to a minimum, strictly because it's a healthier way to live -- not from any moral considerations.  When I do eat meat I try to avoid, if possible, meat that has been tainted with nitrates, antibiotics, and hormones.  I wish there were more restaurants in Las Vegas that catered specifically to vegans and vegetarians.  Many restaurants offer vegan and vegetarian options, but my Internet search turned up only one restaurant in town that does not serve meat at all -- the Go Raw Cafe.

After greatly enjoying a vegetarian Thanksgiving with Tofurkey bought from Whole Foods, I wanted to continue my meatless streak at the Go Raw Cafe.

The first thing I noticed was a flyer that had been placed on every table advertising pressure acupuncture.  There was also a bulletin board and counter near the entrance covered with business cards and other flyers.  I wasn't wearing my glasses, but squinting I could make out that one of the flyers was promoting the healing power of crystals.  There was also a book nook that I browsed briefly while waiting for my order to arrive.  One book was all about The Lemonade Diet.  You get the gist.  Why is it that so many natural/health food restaurants and markets are in bed with pseudo-science, Eastern culture, and New Age mysticism? 

Perhaps it's the health food crowd's general mistrust of mainstream culture that results in a gratuitous openness to anything that seems to be a counter-culture alternative to the mainstream.  The irony is that whether the pedlar is selling cheese burgers, snake oil, or scientifically-unsound books touting fad diets, the profit-motive remains the same.  It is the stealthy hand of corporate culture that tries to tempt the health food crowd with non-mainstream offerings.  I think there must be marketing research which suggests that health food advocates are susceptible to buying anything that appears to be outside of mainstream culture, as long as it makes attractive claims to improve our physical and spiritual health.  It's pretty insulting, if you ask me.

But none of that is a critique of the Go Raw Cafe.  Just an observation.  On to the dining experience.

Our waiter started by asking my dining partner and me if we had been there before.  When learning that we had not, he provided us with some luke-warm recommendations of a couple of things that he liked all right, and warned us about some other things that he didn't care for, but which some people apparently do like.  It almost seemed as if he were apologizing in advance for the menu.  Seeing as the Smoothies and Veggie Juices were in the range of $6 to $9 each, we just ordered a couple of waters with lemon to start with.  The tepid waiter brought our waters in small plastic glasses without ice.  My dining partner's lemon wedge was all skin and no pulp. 

We decided to split the International Sampler and a half-order of the vegi-cotti.  I was looking forward to the hummus and garlic bread sticks that were part of the International Sampler.  But when our food arrived, I couldn't see or taste any hummus anywhere.  Maybe it was inside of the Mexi Wrap, or mixed in with the Pasta?  As for the garlic bread sticks, there were four of them, stuck upright into the pasta.  They were about the length of a finger with only half the girth.  They were crisp, barely flavored, and gone in six bites.

The pasta primavera that came with the vegi-cotti looked almost identical to the pasta that came with the International Sampler, but there was a very subtle difference in taste.  The taste of the food was unusual, but not unpleasant.  It was interesting, but not exciting.  

I never had any hesitation or reluctance about eating the food because I knew it was healthy and wholesome.  But I eat healthy, wholesome meals all the time without having to sacrifice good taste and delicious flavors. One can eat healthy and also enjoy it. This food was merely edible.  It didn't taste like shit.  It wasn't repulsive.  But this is not high praise. 

The menu was also overpriced given the moderate serving portions.  You don't get a lot of food for the price you pay.  Our meal came to $26, and we had no leftovers. 

The best I can say about the Go Raw Cafe is that it serves healthy, edible food.  But it is under-seasoned and overpriced, and I have no desire to go back there.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,2,1,2,8_NghfuCXdsxd5SRp7wkCQ

Two were not my preference. But I tried and ate them ok and would try something else next time. I see some complaints about some of the more extreme meals on this site.

After standing at the register for several minutes to place an order while the waitress stood around talking to the only other person in the cafe, we finally got some service. My boyfriend and I brushed off the first incident and continued looking around at their selection of books and such. We then sat down and FINALLY received our meals after about 35 minutes (again, we were the only customers in the place). The food was pretty good, but what really set me off was the drink. All we wanted were two cups of water. Instead, what did we receive? Two Dixie cups, standing about three inches tall, of room temperature tap water. Seriously? If you're promoting this raw, Earth-friendly lifestyle, why wouldn't you provide reusable cups. Hmm, a glass perhaps?

1483078,2010-11-02,9,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"I literally cried leaving this place. I just can't even.....

Matt decided to come here for his birthday lunch for some-odd reason. After perusing the menu I decided on the neat loaf and ""fries"" [a lot of things on the menu are in quotes. You will see them used in this review as well.] and Matt got the purple burrito, and we both got two small Fiji waters. The total was over $31! I thought of the CenturyLink internet bill that was around the same price and bit down and paid. I hoped that the food we would get would be delicious and amazing for that price. 

Now, before I go into the ""food"" (see what I did there?) section of my review, let me talk about the actual property. It sits right next to The Lakes and is gorgeous. Tons of ducks were gathered outside. When you go in there isn't too much room to move about, and when you get to order you don't quite know where to go. After our orders were taken I guess the guy assumed we had been there before because we got no direction. Finally we saw someone else pay so before our food came out I paid and the woman behind the register was confused since apparently people come up and pay after their meal. Finding the register in the first place was difficult, the place has a very strange layout. 

Anyhow, after 15 minutes or so we got our ""food."" The entire plate looked unappetizing. The neat loaf was just a rectangular-shaped lump of brown stuff, the fries were... well, nothing like fries whatsoever, and two small triangles of the hardest bread ever that should truly come with a warning since I swore I almost chipped a tooth on them. I received some random mixed veggie salad on the side and two pieces of fruit, as well as some orange paste for the ""fries."" Being completely honest, I couldn't even identify what was on my plate with the exception of the two pieces of fruit. I really tried to be open-minded and started to eat what was on my plate but everything tasted ""off."" Not a thing on my plate was edible. The flavors that were there were so strange, peculiar, and really hard to describe. I just know that they were terrible. I couldn't eat more than 4 bites before I had had enough. And trust me - this morning I was STARVING and I would much rather prefer to starve than eat here again.

Maybe I'm the crazy one, but I don't think that an oven is necessarily a bad thing. Maybe Matt and I both ordered the wrong thing or should have ordered a (ridiculously priced) smoothie, but I can't believe that anyone in their right mind thinks that what was on my plate was flavorful and tasty. I can't believe I spent $13.88 on a plate of vegetable mush. As a vegan I'm used to eating new things that might not work in theory but this just did not work at all, and at least those questionable items were still edible and identifiable. I was so angry that I just cried instead upon leaving Go Raw and I know for a fact I will never be back.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,12,5,1,dxZdTphg-MAShriEO8mOYg

1608924,2014-04-04,5,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"We visited this place on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. Firstly, we couldnt find the place, as there is no banner that says Go-Raw. They have large signs that say VEGAN! Now, I figured out that there is no way there would be 2 vegan cafes in a strip mall - so we went in, turns out it was the place. It is certainly surprising 
that there is one such place in Vegas - which is the town of buffets, steak, sinful food and wastage. 

Ambiance: it was somewhat boring. Looked more like a homeopathic clinic or bookstore than a lunch place. The lighting was un-flattering, furniture was boring, decor was average. 
Food - Certainly a lot of variety - but perhaps that is the problem here. They had american, Mexican, Italian  and Mediterranean dishes and it is really difficult to come up with so many good combinations, especially if you are planning to Go RAW!  I am comparing with other organic, vegan and raw places, so I am setting my expectations right. I tried the lasagna, and it was horrible. They told me the pasta was made out of Zucchini, I thought it would be something cool and unique - to my disappointment, zucchini was the pasta. The sauce was average and so was the salad. We also tried their beet burger, but the bread (which must have been made out of almond meal or something) was really dry and chewy. The Mediterranean platter has some kind of wraps made of collard greens (sucked), hummus and a cold salad. The hummus tasted, but again - I've had better. 

The portions are really huge and so are the prices. When you are eating raw food, the truth is that you wont eat a whole lot - the food energizes you quickly and is leafy and cold so you just dont over-eat. It is a good thing, but its also not food that you want to take away and eat later when it is colder and stale. This place needs to really reduce the amount of dishes on the menu, focus on few good salads and sandwiches and make them really well and tasty. 
Service - The waitress didn't seem to care that much, kinda typical vegas attitude. The owner came down to explain the menu options, but no one really came back to check in on us to see if we liked the food, especially considering we were first time customers. There were 1-2 other people in the restaurant but seemed to be there for medicines or books and ate something while they were there.",jCEPqPBIWLCW0c9jVGbAPg,6,4,3,6vns3I-arhppHL9xcSYW_w

I feel sort of claustrophobic and uncomfortable that I could never even imagine dining there. In fact, it's one of the most uninviting places I have ever been in.  I think the dark and poor layout contributes to a bad flow to the place. 

People walk in and don't know what to do or where to pay without guidance from the employees.  I think the employees figure if you were able to find the place then you have been there before.  If you are new to Go Raw Cafe--just head to the cramped area in the back near the bathroom to place your order.

I always wonder if they are still gonna be in business when I drive up.  After looking around my last visit I asked myself why not just get a juice at Whole Foods 5 minutes away??  I made up my mind and I am officially all done with Go Raw Cafe.  

They recently put a rack of vitamins in front of the stainless steel bar area which seems so large and out of place.  They also moved the cash register around the corner which is awkward.  It's beginning to feel really cluttered even though there is plenty of space to work with.  They have it laid out horribly.  I used to enjoy my juice outside by the lake but the chairs are always missing and the outdoor trash can is usually over flowing.

I usually get the spicy veggie cocktail, whatever my boyfriend wants, and 2 coconut waters or to-go. The girls have no personality and border on rude...definitely not friendly not matter what day of the week or what worker you get...it's actually kind of strange?  I guess if I was crammed into the back of that cafe to work all day I would be unhappy too.

GO RAW is hidden...with gem potential if they would just hire someone to redesign the layout.  The bar stools at the stainless counter were the only place I ever saw people sitting and that option is gone now.   You can't get a good vantage point on the menu from the small area that is left to place your order from.  If it's busy you can't watch them make your juice because you are in the way....unless you want to peek through the shelves of vitamins.  

This place is a wreck and I have seen better use of space in a food truck.  (The photo shows the menu from where you order and the rack I am speaking of is off to the left.)

Dear Owner: Improvements to the inside are beyond needed...at the very least, move that rack.

I liked my green juice and Bob loved his multi-juice concoction of carrot, tomato, green, etc. We both ordered lasagna, bec I ordered it first and Bob copied me, and then I refused to change my order to something else. Big mistake.

The lasagne looked good, and parts of it were good. But there was some kind of sauce in it that tasted strangely bitter and sour that was a total turn off. I picked it apart and ate the greens and squash and avoided the yucky sauce. The little salad mix and toast squares were tasty. The food was really filling as others have mentioned so small portions are just what you need.

During the meal, Bob mentioned that he felt like his sinuses were stopping up and we chalked it up to hayfever. We bought a few packaged things from the store to go. On the way back to the hotel, Bob macked on some cinnamon & raisin ""tortillas"" that smelled great but tasted like sand.  The really bad news is that Bob rediscovered a flaxseed allergy that he had only experienced once 10 years ago and had forgotten about,  that within 30 minutes had closed up his throat and made his neck swell up like he was storing nuts for the winter. A trip to the ER and 5.5 hours later, Bob was on the mend from various injections and IV drips (food allergies are nothing to f with as you may know) and we spent another hour finding a CVS pharm that was open and getting prescriptions filled. So much for a fun night out in Vegas.

None of that was the fault of the restaurant but it did put a damper on the experience, not to mention that Bob's newfound sense of adventure to try vegan/raw foods with me has been set back about a decade.",h8ywl1kiKRvcEzemFOugAA,0,0,3,5pdIHuEg_7bFvrKHBkTxTQ

I had a half order of the enchilada and a reg #5 juice (can't recall the name, but I asked for the greenest one).  On the one hand I wasn't crazy about my enchilada.  It was alright, but it's what you would expect going to a Raw Vegan Cafe.  Very earthy and healthy.  Things I love, but a stereotypical experience none the less.  Also, bear in mind I compare this enchilada with the ones from Gracias Madre and Cafe Gratitude in San Fran... and those really are amazing.  So I didn't hate it, but i certainly will be ordering something else next time.  

As for my juice, I really liked it.  Very cucumber-y (which kind of made it taste (i assume) and smell like Nair).  Once my taste buds adjusted to the cuc, i enjoyed it thoroughly.

I will certainly be back.  I left feeling satisfied and full of energy, and that's what food is all about right!  There were tons of entre options that seemed delicious, I had trouble deciding.

The food is fresh and good.  It has that wonderful clean smell of a vegan restaurant that serves green juices.

The atmosphere was very laid back, relaxed and casual.  It's a small, casual place with a homey feel.  The waitress had a calm, gentle demeanor.  She was very helpful without being intrusive.  She didn't breathe down our necks, or interrupt our meal.  The food was served promptly.  

I had the vegi coti and the #2 juice, and took the gimme the beat burger home to my husband.    My friend had a salad and a smoothie.  We finished with delectable carob pie.  I thought it would be good but it was much better than I expected.

The food was not  salty, over processed, frozen and heated, or greasy.  The flavor came from authentic fresh ingredients.  It's my new favorite place to eat out.

One tip I can offer to first time diners if you aren't accustomed to raw vegan food - don't compare it to what your normally eat.  Don't expect the pizza to tasted like a typical pizza.  They don't use the same ingredients or prepare things in the same way.  Vegan restaurants go by a different set of standards and should be judged by those standards.

Update:  Loved it so much I went back yesterday, this time with my family.  My husband ordered the purple burrito, my son ordered the American pizza and I ordered the beet burger.  We each ordered a different delicious smoothie with our meals.  I told my son in advance - ""Don't expect it to taste like what you are used to.""  We all tasted from each others plates.  We all loved all three plates, although my son didn't like the crust of the pizza.  It's raw vegan flatbread, and even though my husband and I loved it because it has a wonderful nutty flavor that compliments  the fresh toppings, my son prefers a  traditional pizza crust..  Unless you already appreciate raw vegan food, you might  want to order items that don't have a crust.

Before we left we picked up a cookbook so that we can attempt some raw vegan meals at home.  We can't wait to return to Go Raw Cafe!",-PfcLYFMW9ZXc1DEWSqw-g,3,1,5,MM4jgmkr-ihk8hY9k-s8nA

I'm not a raw foodist nor do I plan to be; I just love to eat healthy as much as possible.   I've been coming here for more than 5 years now.  I have a stamp card for smoothies.  If you're used to jamba juice or any other popular smoothie places then you'll be pleasantly surprised by the freshness and thickness of their smoothie.  It's not as big but you get more bang for the buck because they use fresh fruits, berries and nuts.  No ice or watered down fruit juice as filler here.  My favorite is the Pina Cool-ada.  HEAVEN!  

Now for their food.  For starter the house salad is the best salad i've ever had anywhere bar none!  The ginger infused nama shoyu dressing is amazing!  I've tried to replicate this at home many times but couldn't come close.  Whenever i finish all the salad, i would lick the plate (if no one is looking).  It's that good!  The lime-cilantro dressing is also good.  

The Mediterranean wrap is delish.  The full wrap is very filling.  You could order a half wrap and a smoothie.  

The ""burger"" is full of flavor.  It probably has around 50 ingredients.  To make this yourself at home would cost quite a bit.  This is not something I would attempt.  I have tried to copy the smoothie and salad and that's it.  

If you're not sure what to order, just get the different sampler plate.  It has small portions of some of the popular items like pasta, mexi wrap, enchiladas, lasagna and zucchini pasta.

2405221,2012-02-23,5,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Okay. Today is the day... I am submitting my very first 1 star Yelp review. Please forgive me.

So, I must first state that I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I am an open minded person ESPECIALLY when it comes to food. I frequently visit vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurants--My favorite being VeggieGrill in LA. Today, my vegetarian friend and I decide to make a trip to Go Raw Cafe because 1. My friend is a vegetarian and we typically cater to his preference when dining and 2. It is Ash Wednesday when Catholics observe by not consuming meat. 

We arrive at Go Raw Cafe pretty excited being that it was our first time. We even mention this to the woman behind the counter who didn't receive our enthusiasm as we thought. She simply tells us to take a seat at the tables and she'd be there shortly. To her, ""shortly""  meant ten minutes.

We politely asked the waitress what she would recommend. We went with a few of her recommendations and ordered the Mexicali Pizza, the Neat Loaf and ""Fries,"" and a Tropical Smoothie. We were also served two glasses of water with about one ice cube in each glass. We asked for more ice which never came. 

So... our food arrived. As soon as it was placed in front of us, we were somewhat satisfied. Presentation was pretty decent. The Mexicali Pizza looked very well put together, the Neat Loaf and ""Fries"" looked ""interesting"" and the smoothie was well, not worth the couple cents shy of $7.00. It was about the size of a small in most places. 

Onto the taste. The Mexicali Pizza tasted how it looked--decent. The buckwheat crust was just not what I imagined it to be. It was about the consistency of what you would imagine biting into a dog biscuit would be like. The toppings tasted very similar to a 7 layer dip which wasn't bad. The Neat Loaf was in my opinion, disgusting. We knew the second we took our fork to it, it wasn't going to be a great experience. The consistency was like that of poop. Kind of looked like it too to be honest. The ""fries"" were what I believe to be breaded avocados. I have never wanted to endulge in the greasy goodness of REAL fries ever in my life until after biting into those things.  

I honestly try to make the best of every moment, and my friend and I were willing to order something else off the menu. When they waitress came, my friend had told her the Neat Loaf was not what it imagined it to be and asked about another item on the menu. I'm sure she took this as an insult, and she disregarded his question about the other item and asked ""do you want to box it up?"" My friend replied, ""Um, no, I don't think we're going to eat it later."" She then says, ""then give it to your parents."" Puzzled, he says, ""Um. No."" Turned off and no longer interested in ordering something else, my friend reminds her of the ice she never brought us and she comes back with it ten minutes later. 

After all that, I asked for the check, paid the $40.00 tab (in which I did leave a tip that my friend said I shouldn't have based on our poor service), and we left in search of something to eat. We wished we had just gone to Yardhouse for their Gardein items.  

I do not plan to return to Go Raw Cafe... Or maybe I shall call it ""NO Raw Cafe.""

Note: It is obvious that Go Raw Cafe caters mainly to their ""regulars."" Sitting there for the time that we did, it was clear that we were not treated like their ""regular"" patrons were and not only felt ignored, but felt unwelcomed.

2414621,2012-03-08,2,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"I was visiting from California and decided to try this restaurant along with my sister and parents.  The place has a nice vibe, is clean and cheerfully decorated.  I perused their selection of supplements and also the raw foods available for purchase to take home while waiting for our order to come up.  (They also have a fairly large selection of books but I did not have a chance to look at those.)

The food was pretty good and it did come out quickly but the service left a lot to be desired.  There was neither silverware nor napkins at any of the tables--not a big deal but our server did not bring any out for us even once we were seated although she did bring us glasses of water with lemon slices.  

We decided to order the flax crackers with guacamole and salsa and share it as an appetizer.  The food arrived pretty soon after with some brightly colored melamine plates but--still no napkins or silverware, which was a bummer since of course chips 'n' salsa can be a bit messy.  The chips were crispy and had a good flavor and the salsa and guac were obviously fresh and brightly colored.  The guac had a good consistency with little bits of veggies in it and the salsa was chunky.  (We could have used a few more chips though.)

My father ordered a small salad and the cooked item of the day--a curried soup.  Mom ordered a portabello wrap, sis had the purple burrito with mex pate and I decided to try the mock salmon cakes.  Everything looked great and was beautifully presented on colorful dishes.  Our waitress did eventually bring us napkins and silver but she just plopped down four settings at the side of the table rather than handing them to us.  She never did take away our menus after we'd ordered so I finally moved them to an adjacent table.  I don't think she ever checked back with us to make sure our food was OK but she did eventually come back to refill our water glasses.  (The place was not busy, either--I think there was just one other customer there at the same time that we were.) 

I have to say I was disappointed with the ""salmon""--perhaps I should have gone with my other choice which was the ""neat loaf.""  The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food well enough though. 

We had a somewhat tight schedule so I'd inquired early on if their desserts could be ordered ""to go.""  Our waitress said that they could; she said she would find out what the day's selections were and let us know what they had.  She said she thought they had ""pies"" but she never did get back to us on that.  At the end of our meal I got up myself , went to the kitchen and inquired about desserts which, as it turned out, did NOT include any pies.  They had several flavors of individually packaged cheesecakes, some commercial chocolate bars, and something billed as ""fudge"" that looked mostly like chunks of chocolate-tinged granola.

We decided to take three cheesecakes and some ""fudge"" to go.  As soon as we'd gotten up from the table our waitress came out to clear the table and as we were on our way out the door she thanked us for coming.  The cheesecakes were quite tasty.  The ""fudge"" was not bad but I really think it should be called something else--it really is nothing like fudge.  It has nuts, seeds, honey, and some cocoa in it but not particularly fudgey.

Overall I would probably go there again to try some of the other items on the menu but I am interested in raw foods to begin with.  I don't know if my family liked the place well enough to want to go back.  The Go Raw Cafe gets points from me for the wide variety of menu selections, pleasing food presentation, and the speed in which we were served.  Subtract points for our waitress not doing basic things such as bringing us silver right away, not taking up our menus, and not checking back with us once we were eating.",Od8RkBrIZqB3srxWUPHhfg,1,1,3,HHeT9tCZ4NeLl6Sr7a-9Zg

I found the ""full"" portion of enchiladas and pasta to be pretty big - I was able to finish the enchiladas (stuffing myself) but I probably could have only eaten half the pasta dish. But I don't usually eat huge meals, so if you are used to eating big meals, you may want to spend a little more on appetizers and stuff. I'm too lazy to prepare raw foods like this at home, so I never expect it to be cheap in a restaurant.

They use a lot of banana, but you wouldn't know it. I always ask for half the amount when I order the superfood. It's delicious. The cookies and cream is great too! They have fresh juices that are wonderful and great little desserts. They are the ""Raw Makery"" and you can find their pre packed power house lunches in whole foods in the fridge by the salads. They have a small little section where they sell their snacks. They sell books and do raw cooking classes one Sunday a month, (I believe). They sell different vitamins and supplements and their employees are all pretty knowledgable on the subject of raw veganism. The ambience is very comfortable.

If you plan on visiting, order by phone and pick-up for an outdoor picnic, there's seating outside. Bring some breadcrumbs or seeds for geese and ducks by the water so they can get a treat too.

The place is pricy, but the food is healthy, tasty and nicely prepared. I got mock salmon sushi and portobello mushroom wrap and I enjoyed both but got hungry soon after (I'll blame the workout I had earlier) Next time, I want to explore their little shop a bit more and get the hazelnut mousse. It's a nice little restaurant and gathering spot for vegan and health conscious people.

I bought the Groupon for Go Raw literally 6 months ago and decided to finally go there today. My groupon expires tomorrow. I was dreading this visit primarily because I'm not at all a fan of raw vegetables for the most part. 

I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I entered the small cosy restaurant right next to the lake (sounds quaint and nice but the lake is actually pretty smelly) and we were surprised to see 4 tables (out of a total of about 7) with people. On a Tueday night. Vegas. Raw food place. Yes..I was intrigued. As we were having dinner, a few more tables got filled.

There was one waitress for the entire place. A very sweet young lady who was knowledgeable about the food and had some very good suggestions. 

Our order:

1. We ordered the only cooked item in the store : their hot soup ($5.80 for a bowl). This was a simple blend of multiple vegetables in a thick stock with spices. We literally licked our bowls clean

2. Cheeseburger with ""fries"" (about $10.50) - the burger patty is made out of beets, various vegetables and grains and was presented in between 2 pieces of sprouted bread, tomatoes, onions, homemade ketchup/mustard and of course a generous helping of fresh avocado and almond ""cheese"". I was floored at how flavorful the burger was. It was one of the top 5 veggie burgers I've had in my life. When the ingredients are presented to you on a Yelp review, they do not look appetizing. In fact, the burger itself looked pretty bad. But the food is mighty mighty tasty. The burger came with their raw fries. I'm not sure what they were made of (I think avocado and some breading) but these were pretty bad. I'd skip this next time

3. The ""Manicotti.:"" I got the half order that was $8.88. If I were Chinese, this would be my lucky meal! I have to rave about the side ""pasta salad."" This was made with slivered zuchinni/squash and various different veggetables and had such robust flavors of spices and garlic and marinara all over it. I didn't even miss not having spaghetti. This was just the best alternative to pasta I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The Manicotti itself was also pretty good. 

Our meal came up to just under 30 dollars.

I regret being so close-minded to not try this gem in Las Vegas nestled away in the Lakes area. To have the opportunity to eat clean, absolutely unprocessed food is hard to come by anywhere and although I don't believe I could follow this lifestyle (as unintrusive to nature as it may be) on a full-time basis, I think it does wonders to partake in a meal like this ever so often. I'm looking forward to my next meal here. I've already set a date on my 2011 calendar for this.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,10,6,4,2gJoovaQIWf29bWQLxpqVA

It was my first experience with raw cuisine and it was good!

I felt a little awkward walking in since my husband was wearing a hoodie from the (amazing) Chicago drive-in Superdawg and I was wearing a wool coat and leather boots but hey, no one threw paint on us so everything was good. The seating procedure was a little confusing but you are supposed to seat yourself and wait for someone to show up. Ok. Service was mildly apathetic but competent.

The food, meanwhile, was delicious! I loved the carrot avocado soup and my Love juice- apple, beet and ginger, a sweet and refreshing deep pink treat. We ordered half sizes of the vegi-cotti and enchiladas. The enchilada came with yummy guacamole, fake ""refried beans"" and yam rice. It was tasty and topped with a pretty realistic sour ""cream"" and red sauce. My vegi-cotti was a huuuuuuge portion with a really flavorful, fresh sauce- a soft tortilla filled with almond cheese and veggies with a side of zucchini pasta. I could not finish my plate and left satisfied.

The prices are a bit steep but everything is pretty much prepared-to-order and the ingredients scream FRESH. I will definitely go back as we continue to explore vegan cuisine in Vegas. I want to try the burger and avocado fries next time!",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,7,3,4,o7ZMYKeQE9gqB1Hh8CkkXg

Perhaps I will get an entree one day and update my review then. I have just moved out to Vegas from California and finally reunited myself with this wonderful place. (Hooray!)

I got their Body Cleanser juice (beets, apples, and a couple other things)  the first time I returned. I was nervous about the flavor because I have never had anything like it, but it was absolute love at first sip. I don't know what the heck I was tasting, but it was goooood. Also, beets tend to dye things so beware of your clothing, enjoy your red ""kool-aid"" tongue, and have fun when you go to the bathroom. Heh. Also bought a raw apple cookie, and that wasn't bad. Raw cookies are VERY different from baked cookies, that's all I can say. Not bad, but will not get it again.

The second time, I returned to try the Kookies n Kream smoothie and a raw chocolate cheesecake. The way they make smoothies just blows my mind. I witnessed the juice chef chop open a fresh young coconut for the juice in my smoothie, and collect a bunch of other fresh ingredients that he skillfully threw together into the blender to make my delicious bev. All good stuff, no nonsense fillers such as sugary juices and ice. Because there was no ice or anything like that, my smoothie came out a bit warmer than I expected a smoothie to be. It was very thick though, and it filled me up surprisingly fast. But then again, I was also chowing down my cute little plastic bowl of raw chocolate cheesecake. That was very tasty as well, and it was even a bit sweet to me! Both items I tried were very good this time, and it left me full in a good way...if I were to eat a plate of nachos and a slice of cheesecake from Cheesecake factory, I would be full too...but it would be a ""stuck"" kind of full. Like my digestive system would be clogged up with a bunch of junk. After I finished up my meal here, I was stuffed, but I felt wide awake and walking didn't feel like a chore at all! :) This is healthy, guilt-free stuff people. And for that, I would gladly pay what they ask for.  

Service is good, nothing over the top and impressive, but I am pretty easy-going about service. As long as they are not bitchy or slow, they're good in my book...and the staff is far from bitchy and slow.

Just to let everyone know It takes a lot to get a bad review from me. I usually give places the benefit of the doubt. And I was SO hoping this place would be amazing. 

But it sucked! 
First off it is located in a beautiful location right on the lake. But as we were walking up we couldn't sit outside because there was garbage everywhere! And I mean everywhere the ground in front of the door, all over the 2 tables. Not a big deal because we could just sit inside but when we got in it was confusing. Is it a self serve cafe or restaurant? the decor is funky there are a few tables strewed around and to the side there is a mini store (just shelves). 

I finally had to ask if we should seat ourselves to which our rude ""waitress"" if you call her that.. told us to pick a seat. After 15-20 min she came up and asked us what we would like to drink. By then we already knew what we wanted and started to order. She looked at us very strangely and walked away. I was under the impression thats how we ordered considering she ordered our drinks...

I ordered the Beet Burger..and my boyfriend ordered the loaf i think.. 
The food was eh'. Considering the price I expected a little more but it was fine. After we had finished..30 minutes later she finally came back and gave us our check. This was also confusing because there was a bar to order things and a mini cash register on the side. We were not sure if we were to pay there or to her. So i just assumed we pay up front. We waited for 15 minutes while the woman talked to another woman about some products. 

This place has so much potential. Especially because there are not many raw/vegan restaurants here in Vegas.

I asked them if they could please add more almond milk and they responded by saying ""all our smoothies are thick"" 
- they then proceeded to add regular water, not almond milk like I asked.  Didn't fix the problem.  Think EGGNOG with a cup of flower or corn starch mixed in.  
Then they served me my ""large"" $10 smoothie, which in any other place would be considered a medium size... And it was still so thick, so chunky, it was like oatmeal.   it wasn't a drink, it was a puréed banana in a cup...  Not exactly refreshing  or even drinkable in 110degree weather, post work-out.  Almost got a brain aneurism trying to suck it through a straw.  ""Thanks for the spoon but it still tastes like crap!""  

Also got a lemon grass shot at $3/oz. 
when I was done at this horrendous establishment that was also: dark, crowded and poorly spaced/displayed - I went immediately to the Smoothie King down the street so I could finally find something to quench my thirst.  And while I don't like chains.... I just needed something to drink, that was palatable... and quickly....
Wheatgrass was $3 for 2oz. Half the price!  Maybe Go Raw has some ""special"" type of holistic, organic, special, wheatgrass that has been carried into Vegas by a yogi, healer that protected said wheatgrass from the droves of vultures trying to horde it's green nutrients..  Or, maybe they were just charging twice the price for the same thing I could get down the street.

Did I mention how rude and Un-accommodating the staff was at Go Douche cafe?  Also, SLOW....  Not like ""we are busy, slow"" more like, ""we just don't care, slow.""  

So, if you want bad food at extremely high prices and served with poor attitude in an aesthetically unappealing place... This is your spot.

The place is a bit hard to find in the dark, no lighted signs and it's a little hard to tell if it's open. However, as soon as we walked in, I said, ""man, it smells good in here"" and my wife said, ""It smells so fresh"", which is a perfect description. 

A waitress greeted us quickly and was very friendly and called us ""you guys"" several times in rapid succession, which is a little pet peeve of mine, but I must get used to it since it has become the norm. ""You guys take a menu, pick a table, and make your self at home"". We did.

Our very friendly and upbeat waitress offered us a suggestion to have the ""Cheese Burger and Fries"". That was a great suggestion. If you are a hardcore meat eater, it probably won't make you happy. The thing I love about raw vegan food, as I recently have discovered, is the way I feel after the meal...light and energetic. 

Thumbs up, and if we are in Vegas again, we will definitely head out to Go Raw Café'!

We found the excellent Go Raw Cafe with the help of Google and our rental car's navigation system (the aid of both was necessary).

The food was fantastic and unique - the place is a real gem.  It was late in the day and we were the only patrons, but we kept the staff busy by ordering a few items from the menu, savoring them, then ordering a few more, then more, then more....  All of the tastes were so clean, nuanced, and tantalizing that the meal became an 'experience' rather than just a means of sustenance.  

The mock items don't taste much like their namesakes - which I consider to be a good thing (too frequently the effort of making faithful meat-taste-copies out of meatless items results in a dull, plastic-food taste).  At Go Raw Cafe the namesakes instead seem to function as gentle inspirations suggesting creative new ways to combine flavors.

We racked up a decent bill, deepened the exhaustion of the staff (they confided that many of the items on the menu require a lot of preparation work - which we guessed, because it sometimes took a while for what we ordered to arrive), and looked forward to our next visit.",dbfdGn7AeKmP24Wv8jD0PA,5,5,5,9FOTUN3Z_aPlVkC3Q3ChXw

I ordered the chips/salsa/guacamole to start and that was my favorite item tied with an iced mocha with brazil nut milk and agave.  I also had the ""hamburger"" which was really like a veggie sandwich which was OK but maybe not an item I would get again.  I ate half of it and decided to leave the half because I started doubting I would eat that other half later.  The ""fries"" it came with were avocado slices rolled in some nuts or spices.  My girlfriend tried one and we both were like, ""ok that's interesting.""  I think it had curry or cumin in it so it was not a hit with me.  I also had a pre-packaged chocolate chip cheesecake which was surprisingly good.  I ordered so many different things because I had never had raw food except maybe once or twice from Whole Foods pre-packaged meals before and I wanted to try it all!  I also had the Kookies and Kream smoothie.  It was too banana-tasting for me but still good.  I wanted chunks of raw coconut in there so maybe they will accommodate me on that request next time.  I can't imagine the staff there saying ""no"" they were so freaking nice.  The shopping center this place is in is adorable too.  It reminds me of the shopping centers in Laguna Beach.  The café has beautiful views of the lake and it feels like you are floating in the lake in a way because of the way the property sits under the ground a bit.  This is a very casual place.  I will like it when I want to wear no makeup, feel like caca and need to put good things in my body.  I definitely feel full as f-ck right now but kinda feel good about it.

The food quality was ok, but I'd say it was far too overpriced for what it is.  I got a smoothie (super yummy), coconut water, and Mediterranean wraps (so so). My dad got granola and a coffee.  The total came out to just under $40. Kind of steep in my opinion. 
There were two women working. They were very friendly, but not super attentive. They brought my smoothie first, then my dads food, then his coffee, then my water. It was very much in pieces, and we were finished with each individual item by the time the next came.  The last thing that came, the wraps, came almost 40 minutes after the first smoothie.
I had to go up and ask for the check after we'd been left alone for half an hour passed finishing the food.  The woman were kind, they just weren't super ontop of waitressing portion of the job.

I understand this isn't a huge business like Whole Foods but prices are high to compensate for a disliked item being replaced.  To have a policy that if you were warned the taste is strong, you cant change your order but if you weren't warned you can is just bizarre.

This place is hidden away in a strip mall that is really not on any major road. It is nestled right off the ""lake"" and you can admire many a large house from the seats inside. We arrived at about 11am, and the place was pretty quiet. We were greeted right away by a very helpful and friendly young woman. She was really excited that it was our first time, and she offered us many suggestions. She also went over some of the differences in how raw food is made. The wife and I chuckled a bit as we don't look like your typical ""health food"" eaters, but on the inside we are both hippies, so we knew what to expect. 

We went with the International Sampler and the Veggie Sushi plus the chocolate cheesecake for dessert. My first reaction to the sampler was how big it was. It is pricey for sure, but the I really expected the portions to be smaller after reading other Yelper reviews. Everything on the sampler was delicious. The hummus is the best I've ever had. I don't like runny hummus, and this is not. It has little chunks of chickpeas, has a nice strong garlic taste and the raw tahini flavor is nutty but not overpowering. I could have eaten a pound of the stuff. The Mexi-cali wraps were very flavorful and fresh. The guacamole was incredible. However, my favorite was the pasta. I don't like zucchini, but the pasta was so delicious. The sauce was beyond words. I wish I had bottles of the stuff. It was like a marinara salsa but was so full of flavor. 

The veggie sushi was also delicious. It was jam packed with fresh veggies and some sort of flavorful paste. The seaweed was a bit chewy, but other than that it was very good. The ginger sauce was also very strong, but not overpowering. 

The chocolate cheesecake was not made in house, but was good. It was a bit grainy, but tasted like cheese cake. It was very small, but was nice to split after having filled ourselves full at lunch.

This won't be a normal stop for us as its a bit out of the way and a bit pricey, but it was a very good filling healthy meal. 

As other reviewers mentioned, they do have assorted food, supplements and books for purchase. Nothing seemed to out of the ordinary. There was also a lot of art on the walls.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,7,4,4,ihJ7kTFfkPm5GfpsTfmyTw

I've been here several times and can't believe I have never written a review on this place. It's tucked away in a corner of a strip mall, very odd location and kinda hard to get to, but once you find this gem, oooooo boy! I've been to their east location and I like the west one much better. 

Great fresh everything. Definitely splurge and get a juice and an appetizer if you can. I want to try everything on this menu someday. In previous visits, I've had the Gimme the Beet Cheese Burger and it was great. The ""fries"" are literally wedges of avocado and the ketchup that is served with it is not so great. I have also tried the purple burrito and the lasagna, both good but not my favs. I've never tried their ""sushi"" but I will be back.

For this visit, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch. We've totally forgotten about this place and I am really glad we came in. We started with the Yummus Hummus - Hummus, sliced tomato, & hemp seeds, absolutely DELICIOUS!! So flavorful, great texture, can't really describe it. Just TRY IT!!! Not your average hummus, but better. Served with living bread (sort of a flax seed cracker) which I adore, and fresh slices of carrots and cucumbers. Mmmmm. 

Next we got our juices, my boyfriend ordered a super juice ""Liver Mover"" (hahaha what a great name) Beet, Carrot, Cucumber, Coconut Water & Flesh. I tried it and it's very tasty, slight sweetness but not too much, probably sweet from the beet.

I ordered the #12 Body Cleanser - Carrot, Cucumber, Beet, Apple - mmm mmm mmm! Very refreshing and perfectly fresh. We were also served some water with lemon. 

The boyfriend ordered a half order of the kale salad and it is enormous! So fresh. Organic kale tossed with red bell peppers, onions, cucumbers, & avocado. Served with buckwheat bread. You could smell how fresh it was when the waitress put it on the table. I got to try a bit and it was yummy.

I ordered a half Veggie Wrap - Pesto, ""almond cheese"", tomato, avocado, sprouts, onions, cucumbers, & carrots wrapped in collard greens. It was served with house slaw which was a very tasty chopped beet salad. AHHH-MAZING. I would hate to see what a full order was, I had plenty of food and it was oh so good. It is definitely the ""almond cheese"" that makes this so good. I love that stuff, it sort of reminds me of a chunky white cheese spread. I have ordered it on the side with flax crackers in the past and took it home to devour. It's really a good snack...trust me. 

I don't know what the negative reviews were all about, I can't find a thing wrong with our experience today. The waitress was also super friendly. This is the first time I have had a waitress take my order at the table - I usually just order at the counter. 

If you like interesting and healthy, clean food, definitely check this place out with an open mind. I really felt ... GOOD...after eating this food. Sure, the food is pricey, but where else are you going to get this quality and taste anywhere else in the Valley? 

This place also sells raw and vegan books, and some interesting holistic things like himalayan salt lamps and crystals. It's a very casual, quiet place, with very neat paintings on the walls which are all painted by a local artist and are for sale.

After I specifically pointed out my interest in the ""Kookies & Kreme"" smoothie because of the coconut and cacao nibs, the waitress agreed that those ingredients were delicious together & made no mention that the smoothie also included banana & several other ingredients. The menu says #20 smoothie with coconut & cacao nibs. So rather than writing out all the ingredients in that particular smoothie, if you don't notice that it says it is a ""#20"" WITH the coconut and cacao, you'll get a totally different smoothie.

The smoothie tasted like BANANA. You don't taste ANY ""cookies & creme"" flavor. AT ALL. It just tastes like a banana smoothie. Neither of us could taste anything but banana. When I said something, the waitress pointed out that it DID say the smoothie had banana in it. I was super bummed because I didn't want banana. The waitress seemed to take it really personally, even though we were very nice to her despite the confusion. Like it seemed she was really angry at us for the miscommunication. We weren't angry with her at all, so it was awkward how she seemed offended. She didn't charge us for the smoothie, which was nice of her. 

We ate the enchiladas, which weren't BAD but weren't GREAT either. There was some dry stuff inside...it seemed like a recipe gone wrong. Enchiladas should have lots of yummy stuff inside, but instead it was just a thin layer of this dry nutty stuff. The sauce and toppings should have been on the inside. It wasn't as good as it could be.

I ended up ordering a coconut-durian smoothie (since I didn't want to the banana 'cookies and creme' smoothie), which I've ordered before and knew I would enjoy. It tastes mostly like durian, but durian is overpowering. I like it.

It is awkward when you walk in, because no one greets you. You have to walk up to where they make the food and let them know you need help.

I prefer this location to Go Raw's other location - it's by a man-made lake with a nice view of beautiful homes and has outdoor seating. There's a huge selection of raw vegan goodies.

Stupid, please, hire an interior decorator or something to help you rearrange your store/cafe. The fact that customers don't even know where to go to order their food or even find the cash register shows that the layout is flawed.

Also, don't have a ""bar section"" complete with stools and whatnot if you're just going to use the counter to dry off appliances. Gross.

The service:
Lacking. The lady was nice enough, but she gave us no greeting when we came in, gave us no instruction on of we order/sit first or how to pay.

The food:
The only decent thing about this place. I got the italian sampler. Lots of tomato, maybe too much, but the pasta was delicious as was the toast and lasagna. 
The only thing I'd have to say about the lasagna is to lay off whatever herb they put on the tomatoes for that particular dish. It's too overpowering and really ruins the taste of the lasagna itself. Had to scrape it off to enjoy it. 

Also bought some fudge, which was delicious and I really want to know how they make it.
Didn't get to try any smoothies, but will probably back to give it a test.

Alittle pricey, which was to be expected, as all vegan/organic food is usually on the high dollar side.

I got a ""large"" juice and the enchiladas. When the juice came out in what appeared to be a 16 oz plastic cup, not even filled to the top, I figured I'd been given the small by mistake. No big deal.

I'd give the texture-less, bland enchiladas 1/10, the accompanying sides 8/10, and the juice a 3/10. Beet/apple/ginger, it was mostly apple juice.

There was a funky odor when I went in, I figured it was just something in the dehydrator. After I placed my odor, I realized it was the smell of urine coming from the homeless woman in the other corner. It got to the point where I was gagging on my food. I asked for a box and the check.

When I got the check and saw that I was charged for a ""large"" juice, I asked the server how many ounces in a small. She told me the small is 14 oz, and the large is 18 oz. I am certain I was given less than a pint of juice.

5204586,2008-10-04,1,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"I am torn between a four and a five star review. I have eaten at Go Raw Cafe a couple of times. The first time with my folks, which kind of soured the experience for me since they were continually criticizing of everything (which they do in general regarding my being vegan). The food I had the first time I went was pretty good, though I got one of the veggie juice drinks and I just could not stomach it. As surprising as it is, my mom the ultra nag ended up drinking it!

Fast forward over a year. I just got back from Go Raw Cafe and I had the ""Cheese burger"". The burger was HUGE. It came on a well decorated plate with the burger on one ""bun"" and the toppings on the other. I started to eat the two separately but one of the ladies at the restaurant urged me to put the burger together, mash it all down, and go ahead and make a mess. Well, I did and I have to say the burger was amazing and very filling.

I will definitely be going back to sample more of their dishes. Who knows maybe I'll end up changing the review to five stars!",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,4,2,4,X3ciXy8KyQMs-hbzDi5Pkw

5255858,2010-08-23,1,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"YUMMY! When I think of Vegas ""raw"" and ""vegan"" do not generally come to mind but now I think whenever Sin City is mentioned in my presence I will begin to salivate thinking of how sinfully delicious the macaroon I had here was; hopefully this reaction doesn't confuse anyone in the wrong way... I'll just direct them to my Yelp page if so! 

I am currently on a cross-country road trip to New England.  Las Vegas was our first stop out of California and after spending just one night there I was in dire need of some sustenance and nutrition! Thanks to Yelp I found just what I was looking for in the form of this location of Go Raw Cafe. My friend ordered the Traditional Pizza and after much going back and forth I settled on having the Vegi-cotti, and then devoured it.  In retrospect I wish one of us ordered something different because the ingredients of each seemed pretty identical.  I didn't try hers because mine was huge! The zucchini pasta side was simply amazing and I am now a firm believer in raw  ""pasta"" although I was previously a skeptic.  Maybe it was the intense garlic flavor of the sauce that sold me but regardless it was delicious and I am definitely going to try to recreate my own once I get to my own kitchen and acquire the right utensils. :) 

I was stuffed from my meal but we heard some other diners, and the owner herself, raving about a dessert.  It turned out that the owner had made up a coconut macaroon the day before and decided to sell/serve them.  For about a buck a pop and as small as a quarter I figured it couldn't do too much damage.  WOAH! There was so much flavor packed into that little morsel of delight!  I used to love the Girl Scout cookies previously known as Samoas (excuse my non-PC terminology; I don't know the new name and haven't had them in years!) and although the taste of this macaroon brought them back to mind they were 100 times better and I am sure at least 10 times healthier for you, somehow!  This place gets all of my stars and then some.  I may just be convinced to brave taking my liver back to Vegas if it means I can try out some more menu items!",IVNSQ_9l5DmT1Ak80yPVjg,3,2,5,X1hjZt__AficlUjpCD6kjw

Three people shared and it was plenty. The chips are so good, they make them and also sell them at Whole Foods. I  got the Veggie Wrap, with avocado, onions, almond cheese, sprouts, cucumbers and carrots wrap in collard greens. The side was a beet slaw, also amazing!  My sister got the Beet Burger, which was to die for. My husband got the Mediterranean Wrap, I didn't try it but he loved it!
They have juices, desserts and more. All raw all vegan!  They have a little shop inside, they sell books, nut butters, bars, sauces and so much more. What a gem this place is, you must try it!

I wasn't certain what to order so I selected the pizza and she had the veggie pasta.  I'm glad we only ordered 1/2 sizes as the portions are generous.  Initially I was a little sad everything is cold, I know it is a raw spot but the weather is chilly and I wanted to warm up a bit.  I didn't mind the temp of the food at all once I had a warm cup of chamomile tea.  The pizza was seasoned perfectly and the crust was yummy and crunchy.  The veggies were very fresh.  I would order the pizza again. . . in fact I may return tomorrow!  I also shared my friend's veggie pasta, it was fantastic!  Who knew raw food could be so amazing?!  Well. . . now I know, and I will be back to try some more treats.  The very best part of the meal was how I felt after, I felt contently full with out that weighed down feeling.

5355358,2012-05-14,1,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Ok, I'm not a vegan. In fact, when my hubby picked me up for lunch and surprised me by taking me to this little hidden restaurant, I was a wee bit nervous about finding something on the menu I would like. Instead, I just returned to my office, handed my co-worker the menu, insisted she go eat there for lunch, and sat down to write this review. Yup, it was THAT good. 

When we walked in, we were greeted by Areeya who informed us that the salads and pizzas (on gluten free crust) were something that were favorited by most since we were new to the place. So, that's exactly what we got, a half House Salad with the House dressing and a full Traditional Pizza. We got our salad first and it was a smorgasbord of fresh veggies (avocado, bell pepper, cucumber, mixed greens, sprouts) and nuts mixed with the house dressing which tasted fresh and garlicy. Then came the pizza, which the menu claims is 'unlike any you've ever had'... and this is why that statement is true: The gluten free crust isn't a thin piece tasteless cardboard like one would expect, it is a thick, delicious, buckwheat crust that was the perfect consistency for piling on the delicious pesto marinara, basil, cauliflower, almonds, & walnuts. The flavors were extraordinary! 

I'm not a total health nut and I'm definitely not a vegan but this place serves up DELICIOUS healthy food and I cannot wait to return to try more items from the menu.

TIP: If you're ordering for lunch, call ahead and place your order - It did take a little while to get the food.",5Bf2aAJdmZxmkZPDxEDCMw,4,4,5,QIA0quaklJkIQi3pQErJpA

5471027,2013-04-30,9,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Gah this place makes you feel so healthy, like you could run eight miles carrying a baby elephant. It is confusing for new people, you have to order in the far back of the store, and pay back there as well. The part of the store where you have tables to eat isn't manned a lot, so in theory people could eat and run without paying :(.
This is a RAW food cafe, meaning that the food you get is NOT cooked. That's what raw means...so you've been informed. 
My friend took us here to try it out, she got the Italian Sampler and I chose the 'Cheese' Burger. Everything is made with organic veggies and vegan almond cheese, along with live bread (which is NOT cooked, dur). The cheese was a little dry for my tastebuds, it kind of overpowered the flavor of the bean sprouts and excellent house made catsup and mustard. The bread was really tasty, and the fries are slices of avocado rolled in what looks like crumbs served with the catsup (SO GOOOOD!) Every plate comes with a garnish of bean sprouts and a slice of apple and orange to cleanse your palate. 
My friend really liked the pasta she had, which was really zucchini, and the lasanga, but the toast with the tomato and cheese was overpowered by the cheese as well, but still very tasty.
We got boxes of fudge to go, which is nuts, oats, honey and carob chocolate squares, not at all dry but very moist and sweet.

5500585,2011-06-17,3,w4QcDDG4mYyCg48BYE_Frg,"Alright well I will attempt to make this review as Raw as possible, My boss is on this Go Raw kick and decided that we were having Go Raw Cafe for lunch. The menu was put on my desk and I took a close look and needless to say I picked the closest to normal thing I could find on the menu which to me happened to be the house salad. He mentioned they make the salads gigantic so just order a half. 

When I arrived at the Cafe I walked in and I must admit it smelled a little odd. I put that off that I am used to walking into places that cook the food you are eating and that have a smell of some sort of meat or fryer. Unfortunately I cannot pin point what the smell was. I then ordered the salads, which yes, they were huge. The lady that was working on our salads guaranteed me that I would love it and I would be back. Now, Let me take just a moment and acknowledge that she was very enthusiastic and upbeat when it came to pitching the company, but I wonder if I ordered it to eat in instead of to go, would the pitch had been the same.

Let me just break it down why I am only giving 2 stars. 

1. Yes the salad was huge, but sometimes quantity over quality is not a good thing

2. The overwhelming smell was a huge set back for me

3. The salad was overly plain, nothing spectacular

This place is just not for me and it is one of those places that I think you need to be fully into the Vegan lifestyle to truly appreciate a place like this.

Sure, the lake view side is beautiful, but I'm a little puzzled at how this place gets business if their location is nearly secretive from everything else on the west side of Vegas? Well, the location sort of does make it seem like a cafe sort of atmosphere you would find in California, but I really did wish the location would be more out in the open in the area!

Compared to the one on the east side, the area is very cramped & small (once again it has the California cafe-esque type atmosphere). Their food is just as delicious as the one on Windmill, & they have quite an extensive selection of books at this location (even a more privatized area to browse, unlike the Windmill cafe). The staff here seemed to have really good relations with the locals who come here, since the day I went there seemed to be a revolving door of people that knew each other & were at the most happy (which made me felt a little more homey at this location).
