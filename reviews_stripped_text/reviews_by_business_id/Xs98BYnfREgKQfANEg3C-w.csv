1019919,2018-03-27,0,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,"I've seen this truck parked on campus at UNLV and finally decided to give it a shot. When I got there they barely had a couple people in line and food still took 12-15 mins. For us student that have to change from class to class in a timely manner it's too much time to wait for food. I Ordered the pesto panini and added avocado, when I received the order i took it to my next class and realized it was missing the avocado, I just didn't have time to come back to let them know about it. Throughout the whole time I was waiting for my food you can see the cashier just sitting outside on her phone while only one more girl is cooking the orders inside.  No wonder why they take so long to make the food. The quality of the food was very poorly executed. It was definitely not worth the wait.",60aRbAqrTAEMnThlC3y4WQ,0,0,1,m-T5L3Q-FuAaBALlv_Jlow
1545709,2015-05-07,0,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,Enjoyed the Vegan Power at Foodie Fest for the 1st time and everyone needs to try this food truck. It's a healthier alternative and one of the only trucks in LV that sells REAL FOOD. Unlike the other food trucks who serve highly processed foods. Take a chance and try them. They're friendly too :),mKu3-7NiyNNzgcPrcQ7YYA,0,0,5,XXWxcHzSVIBDGdW32-t2_g
1685870,2017-03-28,0,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,"Just got done eating a grilled cheese sandwich, Hawaiian Maui onion chips and a handsens root beer from these guys. Total was $9 even.

I am a student at UNLV and I frequently get bored with the options in the student union so I decided to try out the food trucks. SO glad I did. 

The grilled cheese is made with 3 delicious cheeses and is VERY cheesy. (Nothing worse than a low cheese grilled cheese) for $3 more you can make it a meal with chips and a drink so I did that. 

The Hansens soda is what I like to call the guilt free soda because there is no artificial colors or flavors, no sodium, and no caffeine. 

The young blonde girl who took my order was very sweet and patient with me ummmmmming my way through the menu and asking her for recommendations. 10/10 would recommend, after reading these reviews I think I'll try the pesto next time!",XgdsYNJj9Jpta2H5jv_pRg,1,0,5,5IsogJpka555RuD8vrdx4Q
1720433,2014-07-27,0,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,This is a calorie friendly food truck. I had an amazing turkey pesto panini for lunch. It was so filling and satisfying. Everyone raved about the mini keylime pies. That will be my next mission of sabotage.  Give it a try if they arrive at your next event!,ocqqvO_ZlKy6rdxB09P3aw,0,0,5,uu4W8r1RWJoEvpn3eXaEyw

2885454,2014-08-03,2,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,"I had the great fortune to experience this great Food Truck last Friday morning at the Downtown 3rd Farmers' Market.  This truck definitely is a work of passion by his husband & wife team, Rose.Rabbit.Lie. general manager Julio and MGM Grand cocktail server Kelly.  
Nice ingredients and very reasonably priced. I had the Turkey Panini with the avocado and I was full and well nourished.
It was a great way to have a good lunch, and to support a new food truck with a healthy attitude as well as support the Downtown 3rd Farmers' Market. 
I just wish that many others would have been there to take advantage of this roving restaurant and the wonderful farmers market, too.",oQ7irCudwDr73-938pXQIg,2,2,5,8Th11jauO8CAvLI_D6LN0w

I had the grilled cheese and my husband had the turkey pesto and added avocado. My sandwich was good, and my husband pretty much inhaled his so it must have been good. The customer service was great, and honestly I wish we had tried a few more things. I like that the bread had some texture to it so that my sandwich wasn't a big soft mess.

I had the Turkey Pesto Panini and was very satisfied. A nice portion of turkey and cheese with the pesto flavor. The bread seemed to be a multigrain but not %100  sure. I wanted to ask more about the truck but they were pretty busy and I didn't want to hold up the line. I will definitely try more selections from the menu.",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,1,1,4,AigAUgYgYQduM4XqPvuXPg

4175450,2014-09-18,0,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,On Sunday I got to try this food truck at San Gennaro festival.  My boyfriend and I shared a panko-fried goat cheese salad as well as a Panini.  The salad had raspberries and a light dressing over romaine lettuce.  The lettuce was perfect and crispy- not a single wilted leaf.  The panko-fried goat cheese was amazing!  How had I never had that before???  The Panini was served a moment after the salad and was perfectly crispy and melty.  The Panini was not oily as most Panini's I've had in the past were.  I walked around San Gennaro afterwards to try other things and then was sorry I wasted my time and $10 on an Italian Sausage that had a hair in it!!!  Gross!  I wished I had just spent all my money and appetite at the 50 Shades Food truck!  On a side note excellent service from the food truck.  The sweetest people were at this truck!,vepRbwKOq3KuN7VSB3PEcA,0,0,5,khhBrpLV1PkFLuZOtuHx8g

Instead, I got a huge portion of cut corn with all the fixings. I definitely had to share my corn with other people because it was just so much corn.

It has a nice, smoky flavor and when combined with the cotija cheese, it's amazing. No complaints from me! I'm excited to try the other menu items since the corn was so mind blowing.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,2,1,5,p27g01F8-wRCpibe5LQUQg
4499426,2016-05-18,1,Xs98BYnfREgKQfANEg3C-w,"The name is really catchy and is def a draw in. I've only tried them on campus (UNLV - food truck) and it's one of my favorite food trucks!

The food is summed up by the following words: 
-Tasty
-Delicious
-Healthy
-Full of Flavor 
-Pow
-Yummy

I've only had the BLT sandwich and have not tried anything else because it's sooooo good! THICK applewood smoked bacon (yum), garlic mayo and whole grain organic bread. I added avocado to my BLT and did not regret it. Every single bite tastes like your mom made it especially for you! 

The prices are pretty reasonable as long as you don't do add-ons. (avocado, drinks, chips etc.) 

Definitely worth trying at least once and if you're fine with the price you will keep coming back!

I'm looking forward to eventually checking their brick and mortar location",0SMtO3NR5F9B0fYThXF0gA,1,1,4,H_It5lIy414fg2Z0FWQhMw

It's remarkable to finally find a healthy food truck, and these guys don't disappoint. 
I found them at Top Shelf Wine & Spirits parking lot among other food trucks.

Strawberry Fields
The combo of tart strawberries, crunchy walnuts, and salty cheese should is enough make anyone stomach growl. This salad is even more delicious when tossed with apple vinaigrette.

i got a chance to meet Kelly (owner), she's a really nice person and informative. 
I also follow them on Instagram, the food posts look awesome.

I'll definitely search for this food truck again!",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,3,2,5,v9Wsqa8M5hduu6OM0lxYaA

It's great to see a truck that does a little bit of everything. They have everything from burgers to vegetarian options.
Many food trucks seem to zero in on un-healthy comfort foods (which I love) but these guys have a healthy balance. 
Yes, you can have a cheeseburger, or Carne Asada fries, but you can also have a vegetarian salad, or something in between, like a spinach salad with fried goat cheese!
They were on-time and professional, and their staff are really great too.

There were several other food trucks to choose from and several of them I've tried before. I saw the 50 Shades of Green truck and decided to try something different. I'm really glad I did! 
My friend ordered the Strawberry Fields salad that she let me taste. It had fresh mixed greens, strawberries, feta crumbles, pecans & an apple cider vinegar dressing. The salad was delicious! I could've easily eaten her salad but I thought that wouldn't have been very nice! 
I ordered the Turkey Pesto Panini and added avocado. The sandwich was toasted to on this most awesome bread. I could eat a whole loaf of that bread. The turkey pesto sandwich was awesome! All the ingredients were fresh & balanced to perfection. 
The prices for both the salad & sandwich was good too!  I can't wait to eat here again!  
One suggestion would be an option to have a sandwich with a salad combo. :)",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,5,6,5,oZavFpfIqZ-o0PzRykgQXQ
