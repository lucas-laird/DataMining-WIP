However, it was so hot outside we gave up trying to find the other place and ate here since we saw a lot of local people ordering and eating around the truck. What a happy accident! The food was so good, it's probably one of the best food trucks I've been to! Highly recommended if you can track them down... they said they move around several times a day, so may be hard to find, but well worth it if you can!",KepfAkQbsShiP1-W8LlvcQ,0,0,5,p-mmRDcY5gaw8-0xrYamfQ
1550628,2013-02-08,0,5QsW4RdCrDhVuDHnlgnCuA,"I've learned there are several food trucks under this name, but I have only been to the one outside the RJC on 3rd Street.  I had a 5-Speed breakfast burrito this morning that was AMAZING.  I don't think I'll eat breakfast anywhere else before work. It had eggs, hash browns, bacon, ham, sausage...delicious!  The girl in the truck is very nice too, and they take phone orders in case you don't want to wait outside in the cold for your food.  I love this place!",VUatcI8qj9bsH_0nKHemvA,0,0,5,_4hPk6WgvTfsa6SCbrIcsw

2232684,2011-07-25,3,5QsW4RdCrDhVuDHnlgnCuA,"Let me start by saying that Carefree Catering has 11 trucks around the valley so your experience may differ.  I believe these are the trucks that typically service the construction sites but have branched out because of the recent food truck craze. Also, when there were two Carefree Catering trucks parked within a block of each other outside my work (the courthouse), I noticed that the menu items and prices were different for each truck.  The trucks that come by my work are all white and don't have any distinguishing characteristics.  I know there is one that is painted but I've never eaten from it.  I have no idea how to distinguish the plain white ones.  

I ordered a California burrito for $5.50 at one truck.  Maybe California burritos have been bastardized outside of San Diego, but, in San Diego (the home of the California burrito) a California burrito is carne asada, French fries, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.  This was ground beef, French fries, and a little bit of sour cream.  The ground beef did not taste good so I stopped eating it and I ended up getting sick later in the evening.  

Later, I did notice that another Carefree Catering truck was selling California burritos for $5.  No idea if they differed in any respect from the other truck.  I wasn't willing to risk it again.

Basically, this truck chain is a crap shoot.  I have encountered some people who enjoy the food from their neighborhood Carefree Catering truck.  If you have a favorite Carefree Catering truck, stick with it.  But don't expect consistency between the trucks.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,4,2,2,T7jIyZ-V9xZofqLMBMF-zg

3454415,2012-07-17,2,5QsW4RdCrDhVuDHnlgnCuA,"Occasionally, I walk down to this truck -- RJC (Regional Justice Center) location --  with co-workers so they could pick up their food, which they always seem to enjoy. Unfortunately, I don't enjoy the food from this truck as much as they do.

I ordered the Taco Salad which contains pico de gallo, rice, beans, and lettuce. Could've sworn what I ordered was a SALAD, but my taco bowl was filled with rice and beans and hardly any lettuce. It's also *supposed* to come with avocado and sour cream, which I didn't receive. In addition, you have the option of adding meat to your salad, so I chose chicken. Well, I'm certain I chose chicken, even the post-it note on my saran wrapped salad had ""chicken"" written on it, but I wasn't expecting fatty pieces of pork -- the thought of this makes me want to throw up right now. On top of my experience, my stomach became upset afterwards. 

If you work in Downtown, there are several other food trucks located in the area, and there's sometimes one other parked right in front of Carefree. But after my experience, I'm hesitant to even want to try another food truck.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,0,1,StsQOOtiTrYULmexUlzb9A

The tacos we're so delicious! Totally not what I expected from a taco food truck
    
I will definitely be buying my lunch from here.",pgtrubez-8KrWlKXACKUpw,1,0,5,kVohbsLLi1vnHhYuJU9hCQ
4315947,2015-10-24,0,5QsW4RdCrDhVuDHnlgnCuA,"pretty good deal.  if you see these trucks - stop in.  
I order the tomato cooked in with rice and carne asada and jalapenos on the grill - no problem.  
I also order the pastrami (cooked crispy) in a burrito with rice + cilantro + sour cream - I think it's better that way.   I would only order it with fries inside if I could afford eating that many calories!  

you can also order ahead, if you get that truck's driver #.  or call the main number to find out where they are.   I would definitely book these ladies for an event.",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,1,0,4,4O07BLdJK5O_fsF9ZVDOeA

This was one of my favorites so far!  They had a large selection to choose from and the prices were reasonable too. Quick service as well!

I ordered the three beef taco plate.  It came with three snack or street tacos, beans, rice and chips.  The tacos were filled with beef, topped with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese.  They were delicious!  The meat was well seasoned and was grilled to perfection!

The second time I had a beef burrito.  Perfect size for lunch!  

These guys were quick and were brought back several times to our location, which says a lot!!",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,5,6,4,3V78mVNVAZFsyLZEvT9gpg
