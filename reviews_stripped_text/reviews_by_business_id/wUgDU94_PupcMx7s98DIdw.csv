The door facing Las Vegas blvd was locked so I walked along the side and the employee was hanging out with someone.  I knew they were supposed to be 24 hours but I ask anyway. Are you open? The response I got was ""no I'm on break"" not give me a minute or oh I'm sorry I'm on break can you come back in a couple minutes? He was very rude and then went back to his conversation and I walked home. I will not be returning here.",_ZNKSv90MmdXar-0OzN1Vg,0,0,1,Un2kWHcdyYnydsyFlQ3-gA

1632200,2016-05-27,0,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,The food is fine just like any other Subway. But like every Subway it seems like they teach the staff to over charge or not offer the deals until you already pay full price. Its almost like a scam they started over charging more for less product. It is a corporate wide thing. Its so close to house is the reason i go but after having some kind of problem with the deals that they offer every time i'm going to just try something else.,mfVpQYxtYiRcnLoa3M7X5Q,0,0,2,phKeN9JH7zxN3DTYWoqazg

Staff appropriately so customers don't have to wait +20 minutes in line. No surprise this store has horrible ratings. How are they maintaining cleanliness standards with one person working by himself?

I went in last night right after I had taken a pain killer for my headache and I guess it was too much for me and I passed out while ordering. Like literally passed out in the middle of subway.

2743921,2018-06-23,0,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,I come here often on weekends when I get off work round 3:30 Am. Currently 9 people in line and only ONE EMPLOYEE!!!! Absolutely ridiculous that customers have to wait 20/30 mins to order fast food sandwiches! This will be posted on the B.B.B. I'm sorry but no one should have to wait this omg and the poor employee is trying the best he can to hurry. I have a video and enough proof to show that this Subway is busy and not enough customer services.,Nr5-7Dr9PkOQd_yPEkq6WQ,1,0,1,7pKCmVe_xSimU7Y3tylSNw
3155573,2015-09-29,0,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,"Well this subway has gotten some pretty atrocious reviews. I have always had good experiences at this subway. My boyfriend lives right across the street at the apartment complex so getting some late night ""healthy food"" is sometimes a little bit tricky being that were in the south part of Las Vegas. Luckily this subway is open 24 hours a day so late night food is a perfect sometimes. I've noticed that a lot of people aren't very kind to the subway sandwich artists. I've actually noticed that many people aren't very nice to people who serve them. I always try to do a good job at saying hello and asking the person who is serving me how their day is going and if they've been busy or not. Because of this I feel like I get better service and have better experiences because I'm kind to people.

I give it a solid 4 stars because sometimes the bread isn't as fresh as it could be but it's a really decent subway shop and the sandwich artists there are good folks. If you stop and ask them how their days are going then you'll probably be getting a pretty awesome sandwich with some pretty awesome service.",PoMSgPEu9vqR2Dx4WpbXrg,2,1,4,4uCmobKQyUVs3ziLKwqz9Q

You should not be putting a 19 y/o ALONE on the 11p-6am shift with homeless and meth heads roaming through. We completed our purchase and found out she was alone to defend herself should there be a **it show and seemed pretty tired from working another job. As an open carry state, it disgusts me that you would even consider scheduling a person who is tiny to defend themselves! The meth head in there tonight talking to himself and picking the scabs off his face may not seem like a threat to you owners, but how do you know when his high may turn lethal?? 

Do you make so much money from 11-6am that you can not consider being closed during these dangerous hours?? Perhaps you don't give af about your staff? Either way, my money will not sponsor the danger you put your staff through, especially a young woman who consistently works this asinine shift. Reconsider your hours.",p9V1lqCHXWbwUM0xsHliBw,1,0,1,iT9C_BlybT55DJfYKxKquw

As far as service goes most of the employees here are in decent spirits and helpful however the other day I went into this location with a coupon that randomly showed up in the mail and had a simple question about it. When I asked about the details of this coupon the girl immediately snapped back at me with, ""the coupon says what it says!"". I personally am in the service industry as well and there was no need for the rude snappy behavior of this girl. I'll gladly drive a mile down the road and go to a different Subway and take my 4-5 meals business a week to a different location.",tl-1Dcoz6-qMqdX8B8m7HA,1,0,2,z8R7SnJUFHa_52yChoq4bw

4035483,2018-06-08,8,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,"Decided to indulge in my late night calling for an amazing sub. I am so glad that I have one this close to my house and that is open 24/7. This subway is tucked away in a parking lot that is very dark and gloomy at night due to the emptiness of the massive shopping complex it is located in, but is close enough to the road to be seen. One has to love Vegas for it is a 24 hour town and this is one of the few restaurants left that abides by the Vegas rules of all night rules.

This store is very well lit and safe for customers to answer their late night cravings. With a very clean store and wonderful sandwich artists it's a win win. I was greeted as I walked through the door and was in luck since I was the only customer at the time in the store. The sandwich artist went through the regular bread choices and we did our little toppings dance. Then off to the register with a swipe of the card the sandwiches traded hands and was mine to indulge in.

The subs were all amazing and hit the spot. I ordered a turkey and Swiss for me and the twins had roast beef subs. The turkey was just what I needed to recover after the loss of our fabulous Knights game to the Capitals. The sub artist was able to share in our defeat but his recommendation of the turkey sub tasted oh so great and fresh made me sleep very soundly.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,22,24,4,Ig-Lv_4wQVVcXpBKIOm-WA

4353599,2016-04-23,0,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,Just to slow...getting a sub here is like pulling teeth sometimes. Under staffed is the main problem. If more then 1 person comes in at a time your looking at a good 15 -20 min wait. Way to long to wait just for a sandwich.,cOsrJBNjyEiOecMS0imutQ,0,0,2,99-Ae0IFGSLlegPArpFMog
4671120,2014-10-05,2,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,"The food tastes good as Subway always does. However the service here leaves much to be desired and I'm sorely disappointed. I frequent Subways often as its one of my favorite foods. This is my first time at this location and I've never experienced such poor customer service at any other location. The girl serving my family and I is not wearing a name badge so I don't know her name. However she is young and possibly of latino decent. She's tall and has long dark curly hair pulled uo in the front with a barret on top and the rest pulled back into a point tail. She has a deep raspy voice. Hope that helps in identifying her. We are here now and it is 4:30pm on Sunday.

Anyway, when we first arrived we had to wait to place our order while she was talking and laughing with the customer before us. He was already done checking out and just standing there joking around with her. She didn't even acknowledge that we were standing there (four of us). She eventually sauntered over and as she asked us for our orders she never made eye contact and had an attitude of annoyance. My whole family noticed it and we were all really bothered by her acting like we were putting her out. She never once smiled or made us feel welcome. 

We are eating in so we've witnessed her being a lot more friendly with the young guys coming in. And now we are leaving in which she isn't acknowledging or saying thank you or good bye, nothing.

Over all an uncomfortable and annoying experience. I doubt I'll go into that location again even though I'll be in that area often now. It's unfortunate for me as a consumer and for you as a business. 

By the way, this is the first bad review I've ever written as I don't believe in writing bad ones unless absolutely necessary. My hopes are that the management does something about this so future patrons don't experience the same thing.",anoGCwvA_S6vg6V02o5fHQ,0,0,1,emz_6BUGNjYr_V0XhibTzQ

Wait time would be around 10-15 minutes in their lobby and we'd just leave. Music is on and so are the lights so we didn't understand why a 24/7 subway wouldn't be open?

5323219,2015-09-18,1,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,"Review is for the Asian employee, with the lip ring and blond streak in his hair. He works graves.

Okay, so my boyfriend + I live across the street.... we normally go linedancing on Thursday nights right there in the same complex. I was hungry one night {last week} and my boyfriend suggested 'Subway'. Last week we had ordered the ""Flatizza"".... one was only cheese, the other pepperoni. He wasn't thrilled when we ordered that last week, we inquired about the difference between the personal pizza and the flatizza. Seemed like he didn't want to make either, he was bothered that we would order such a thing.... but I'm sorry, when you're vegetarian your options are limited and a pizza sounded great! Anyway, it was good and I was excited to have the flatizza at Subway again!

So again this week, after linedancing we wanted to have flatizzas again. Once we arrived, we definitely weren't greeted, he just put his gloves on and looked at us making hand gestures like ""what do you want?"". I ordered a flatizza, he groaned under his breath and then, dare I ask him if they have peppers.... he gave me attitude and was like ""peppers? What kind of peppers?"" And I felt bad for even asking that so I just said ""it's okay, just cheese please"".... he proceeded, with attitude, ""all that we have is right there"" pointing at their line of ingredients. My boyfriend + I heard a sigh of ""GOD"" under his breath after that as well.... that is when my boyfriend just grabbed me and we left because he was just not nice, easily angered, and rude to his customers. I don't go to Subway for top notch service, I understand where I'm at.... I just wanted some fooooooddd, I was looking forward to that pizza!!! 

It's too bad this particular employee is such a grouch and always seems to be in a crabby mood. It really shows and makes it awfully uncomfortable for the customer. We won't be back, it was just too convenient being right by our house and our Thursday night cardio spot =[",I6TRzTZs0azxssDpobWT4Q,2,0,2,NjlwNkwtGMisgVIPK9FbUQ
5635997,2016-10-19,0,wUgDU94_PupcMx7s98DIdw,Came here Monday around 7pm and asked for soup and was told it's the morning shifts job to make it and they didn't so there wasn't any. Came back Thursday at 11am and asked for soup and was told it'd take about 15mins to make. Keep in mind I was the only customer and the manager was too busy making her own sandwich. Staff always looks like they hate their job and sometimes there's no one around. There's another subway down the st. I'll be going to now on.
