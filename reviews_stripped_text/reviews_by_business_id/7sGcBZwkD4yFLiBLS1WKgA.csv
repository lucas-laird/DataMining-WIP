We had the Bbq pide and the veggie sandwich.  Plenty of food. And delicious.The pide crust is phenomenal if you like fresh bread or hot fresh pretzles youll be hooked. there is a  small veggie salad that comes on the side with the sandwich (cauliflower and other assorted veggies with a hint of I think rice wine vinager and curry flavor. )
Only advice I have to give is if your in a rush dont bother or.  Call in your order.  Good food takes time.

I had the turkey sandwich which was delcious, with the seasonal seared tuna on mixed geens with a ginger seasame dressing and edamame. The sandwich was done panini style and was an addicting blend of textures and flavors all completely in sync. The salad had such a delcious dressing with just a hint of pepper heat to balance out the sweet. My hubby had the Pide (greek style flat bread?) BBQ chicken flavor and it was very good too, he ended up dipping the crust into the dressing remains of my salad. 

Only reason not five stars was we were served on paper plates and a plastic trays while other customers were served on actual plates with real silverware.

1057532,2012-12-19,2,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"What a delicious surprise!

I went into Presto Caf√© based solely on the recommendations of other Yelpers. And I am so glad I did. With Presto Caf√© I was moved by three specific things: SERVICE, FOOD, and the COZY FACTOR.

SERVICE: I had no expectation of service in a sandwich shop.  You can imagine how impressed I was by the warm greeting, patient explanation of the menu, and mid-meal check in.  The gentleman behind the counter was genuine and helpful. Before eating the food, I was already getting good vibes about the place.

FOOD: The food was yummy. Surprisingly so. I'd read the good reviews abut the Reuben, but apparently I'd only been SKIMMING because I was shocked at how light and flavorful the sandwich was. Updating a classic? Check. Maintaining the integrity of the sandwich? Check. Keeping it delicious? CHECK.
My hubby ordered and devoured the ""Ham and Cheese Please."" It was kind of a star to us. Don't let he blueberries and Funyuns keep you away.  Overall the food was really tasty--not earth shattering, but thoughtful and flavorful. It wasn't the most healthy (see note about Funyuns above), but it was a delicious lighter fast food option. 

COZY FACTOR: I am a sucker for a seating area and a strategically placed bulletin board. Whether it's genuine or not, I appreciate the gesture. The owners seem to want this to be a place where people can come and relax. And talk. And maybe learn about what is going on in their city. That stuff (or at least the appearance of that stuff) is important to me.

SUMMARY: When I ordered the ""fresh squeezed OJ"", I watched the chef walk to the counter, retrieve the free standing commercial juice press, and start cutting oranges. He had me at juice press. Those are the things that matter to me: a healthy take on food, fresh ingredients treated well, and a welcoming environment. Presto Cafe seems to care about them as well.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,6,5,5,yvoVqDPBTK2UqlJ9rik1uw

The menu was a bit confusing, as I had no idea what some of the categories even were.  Luckily the cahier could tell I was a bit lost and started giving me information and also suggested things that were the most popular items.  

I ended up ordering a Green Goodness juice and a Greek Pide.  Together they came out to be about $15 which was more than I intended to spend, but it ended up being well worth it!  The juice was fantastic and as I waited I watched them make each one ordered and they were jam packed with amazing fresh ingredients!  The Pide I ordered simply because I was curious and it was one of the tastiest things I have had in quite some time, in fact as I am writing this review I am getting quite hungry for one right now :D.

This is our new spot! 
AMAZING!

They use local products when they can and they serve Handsome Coffee! (out of LA http://www.handsomecoffee.com/)

We went at 9 am for breakfast. We both got black coffee with free refills. 

Hubby had a breakfast sandwich with egg whites (subbed just a regular egg) heirloom tomatoes, avocado, greens, and I think a light cheese.

I had the vegetarian sandwich with roasted eggplant with roasted red peppers, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, red onion, black olive tapenade on a seedy whole grain thin bread that had sunflower and sesame seeds on it! 

Both had a apple, mint, arugula, strawberry, with sherry (?) or balsamic (?) green mix on the side.

1352494,2014-01-29,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"Decided to drop in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Wanted to try a new place nearby. Small little place on the SE corner of Tropicana and Rainbow. 

A few tables, and a small couch seating area. ""Open"" kitchen area where they display the day's fresh made salads (lots of variety, about 7-10). 

Yelp says free wi-fi but it's password protected. May need to ask for password? Ambient music a little louder than normal, maybe require you to talk louder to one another. 

Prior to arriving, i was on yelp and checking out what people had suggested, and the first thing that caught my eye was the Ruben. Being a lover of corned beef or pastrami sandwiches, that was what i was going to order. After arriving, i saw the wide variety of salads they had, and one had caught my eye ! Pricing for the salad was by scoop. Something around $2.50 per scoop (pretty decent amount because i only got 1 scoop and there seemed to be more than 1 scoop) 

Seasonal Special (as of january 28, 2014) ($2.50/scoop) - Seared Ahi tuna, watermelon radish, edamame, quinoa, and sesame ginger dressing. OOOH this is probably one of my FAVORITE salads so far, EVER. The seared ahi tuna was nice and fresh. Edamame gave it a nice crunchy texture while the sesame ginger dressing gave a nice flavor that blended everything in. (being one that doesnt really like ginger, i didnt really taste the ginger which was great and didnt know there was ginger until i took a picture of the tag prior to leaving). There was also a lot of these white little things that i didnt know what they were but they were delicious. Asked what it was and they said it was quinoa O.o surprising. That a soft texture while holding its shape. Similar to rice but apparently really healthy for you. Something along the lines of a flat couscous? Hope i can eat this a few more times before it changes, since its a seasonal special 

B.Ruben ($8.99) - Corned Beef, red cabbage slaw, gruyere cheese, Russian Dressing on a Rustic Raisin Rye bread. Decent sized sandwich with a ratio of maybe 1:1 between the corned beef and red cabbage slaw. They use a pretty thin sauce for the slaw, which caused a lot of dripping while eating the sandwich. And it was quite sweet. It covered a lot of the corned beef flavor, as well as the russian dressing. The rustic raisin rye bread was not soggy (surprisingly) even by the end of the sandwich, nicely toasted and was not too hard. Overall, it tasted pretty nice but its not one of my favorite ruben's i've eaten. 

Overall, surprisingly, i enjoyed the salad more than the sandwich, that i originally went there for. I'd go back to try other salads and the various ""pides"" that people have been raving about.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,R-RIOyd3FdGCfol_zYmtNg

I would say for Vegas this place is very reasonably priced considering the price of everything on and near the strip and casinos... If the food is worth the price I do not mind paying a little extra for fresher local ingredients... No farms, no food, it's simple... 

 I ordered the Ruben on focaccia. The corn beef was delicious thinly sliced and just the right amount on the sandwich. They use red cabbage, Russian dressing and Gruyere cheese. It also came with a small sample of strawberry apple salad which was delicious as well.. I really enjoyed the sandwich it was fresh and filled me up without making me feel heavy. My other got a blanco pide which is a much heavier dish because of all the cheese but he said the ingredients were fresh and the flavor combinations were really good. The pides are large and he could not finish it and brought it to the hotel and finished it later. We also ordered a morning wake up smoothie and it Was truly amazing!!! The drinks are a little pricey but all and all I feel for Vegas the food was fairly priced... $4.50 for coconut water? Holy moly! 

The service was great fast and prompt. For a cafe the man running the register (maybe owner) checks on you through your meal to make sure all the food is good.",ncFicpjcE2_GZj1FkGBQvg,0,0,4,x46w2G0IIdSrPANjFB1ccA

This time a tiny little ""sandwich shop"" with a menu that blows away many a big restaurant.  Everything looks and sounds great and we can't wait to go back and try more of the items.

It is not a ""health food"" place, but a ""healthy food"" place.  It has a menu that is made up of all fresh and healthy ""comfort foods"". They have ""free range"" meat selections and delicious artisan style breads.  The salads are exotic and unique in comparison to most places. Didn't get a chance to try the deserts but I bet they are good too.

We shared the Tandoori Chicken Salad, the Rueben Sandwich and the Greek Pide, and they were all delicious.  They don't serve alcohol but we snuck red wine in our juice bottles and it made for a really wonderful late lunch.

If they ever decide to franchise I would mortgage the house (if it ever gets its value back) to get in on one of these.

The young staff that works here doesnt seem to care much about being friendly and giving the same customer service the did when the owner was on site. We have been eating here since they opened and would do really large orders for our entire staff. Now everyone in our office stays away because of how many mistakes they always make and the timing it takes to get the food. We understand that all restaurants have a lunch rush, but sometimes its 30 minutes or more for a simple sandwich.

I'm also doing this review on their Turkey Sandwhich. it was a delight! And to my understanding, Presto Cafe's motto is ""healthy comfort food"" and I couldn't agree more! It truly is healthy and it's just better than comfort food. 

The turkey sandwhich had the sweet and savory taste so it was unique but also became the best turkey sandwhich I've ever had in my life. i was actually full from a half of the sandwhich and took the other half home. I needed it as comfort food from eating the first half lol. 

I dined in and it was served on a dish, well prepared and just so yummy looking! It also came with a mini salad on the side of the sandwich with greens, and green apple and strawberry slices!

I like how nice the cook and cashier were and I think they were the only workers there at the time which was okay because it wasn't that busy and they also cleaned up after us as well! The wait time was quick and the quality of food was awesome! I'm glad I tried this place out because I never knew healthy food could ever taste so great!

Not too many reviews mention it, but this place has a stellar selection of salads, all on display at the counter for you to select as sides. They're nearly $3/scoop, but they're big scoops and the ingredients are quality- bf and I sampled the beet salad (with citrus, pickled onion, and hazelnuts), the tandoori chicken salad (with mango, papaya, coconut, cucumber, red onion, and cilantro), and the curry cauliflower salad (with kale, golden raisins, almonds, and pickled onion). Each was bursting with flavor, and getting a couple sides could easily be a light meal.

For our entrees, we opted for the hangar steak chimmichurri on a bed of truffled Israeli couscous wild mushrooms risotto style and the free range marguerite chicken with quinoa, asparagus and roasted cherry tomatoes. I initially felt the $14/plate was a little steep considering average pricing for their salads, sandwiches, and other dishes- but as soon as our plates came out, it was clear that the price was worth it. The ingredients, again, were high quality, and even the plating was beautiful and made the food look good- everything looked exactly as in the photos on the menu. The taste was off the charts! The meats were clearly cooked fresh and in good portions, the sauces for each dish were complex and delicious, and the sides/vegetables complemented the protein perfectly. 

The guys in the kitchen clearly know what they're doing, and it shows in the care and quality that come out on each plate. I'm happy to have another healthy dining option in the area- next time, I plan to try the ahi tuna sliders or the pan-seared salmon!

Side note: Take out menu states that they have happy hour 3pm-5pm daily on selected menu items. We were there at 5pm but no specials were mentioned to us, nor did we notice any on the posted dine-in menu.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,4,tqqXGyCmS_ZelGuaR9izKw

They have water available for self refill, that's  mixed with mint, cucumber and I believe watermelon! I thought that was a pretty cool free drinking option instead of just plain water.  My sister and I ordered the turkey sandwich and our gf ordered hanger steak on top on couscous. 

The turkey sandwich was on cranberry raisin panini bread, perfectly grilled with American cheese, avocado, and spring mix greens. The turkey was perfect, not dry at all and the sandwich was not wet or dripping in sauce or cheese it was just perfect. And it came accompanied with a small side salad with strawberries and apple slices. 

The hanger steak on the couscous with pesto sauce was fabulous and looked just like the picture presented on the menu!!! The steak tender and juicy and marinated just perfect and the couscous with pesto cooked just right!! Mixed in with mushrooms!!

The place is pretty small, but I have never had trouble with seating and it is kept clean! The staff is always friendly and super welcoming whenever I come in. I usually come here for breakfast or brunch. My go tos are usually the breakfast burrito, steak and eggs, and the pides. The pide is similar to pizza... best way for me to describe it. Give it a try! They also make smoothies and juices as well! Portions are very good and they price very fairly. You can pay anywhere between $6-$15. They also accept phone orders!

Seriously, I feel like if you blink you just might miss their location. As soon as you walk in you're greeted and the cashier was great on telling us all about their menu. It was a bit busy when we arrived so a big plus to her for being able to attend us and still bring out the orders. The first thing I noticed was their amazing display of delicious looking salads. They look freshly made and each one has their own individual description. The second thing I noticed was the huge menu. It's a little overwhelming but they do have a variety of different plates . I ended up ordering their turkey sandwich and the green goodness smoothie. The total was $16 which seemed a little pricey for a typical lunch but after the first bite it was well worth it! The food is freshly made as soon as your order it so do pack some patience with you because it does take a bit to make your order and if you're planning to eat their, good luck not hitting your neighbors chair because the seating a somewhat crowded there. All in all this place was amazing! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the excessive wait time since they never called out our orders and/or mentioned that they would be bring us our food when they had someone available.  Also the seating kinda was an annoyance, I felt bad having to get out of my seat since I had to keep making the guy behind me get out of his so I could have enough room to squeeze by (mind you I'm a small girl) All in all though I loved their food and service, super friendly and delicious food!",EwHy8Xd4-yvlmxEYYNni6Q,0,0,4,J8-kb-2M9QpiUc3lwyKT-g

2220836,2012-11-30,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I always wanted too try this place since close too my house. I heard only great reviews about it plus my roommate gone and rave about the B Reuben. My first impression was this place is really cool. I LOVE the earth tone colors on the walls and funny pics of smiling vegetable on the menu board. The tables each one has flowers on them so not just plain table and chairs! Well light brings out all the positive and relaxing vibe of the restaurant. I went into the same location before when it was called Harold Kitchen. It SO much more upgrade in decor and hopefully Presto Cafe will stick around. 

I decided too have the B Reuben and try on of there salads. It basically a la carte. The salads or basically sides look really good, fresh, and they let you try any or all of them if want.. I enjoy the way all the sides are presented right in front of you. Nice clean, easy too read description card in front of each one, and not just salad have desserts all lined up presented in the same fashion. I went with the israel couscous, wild mushrooms, parm, truffle vinaigrette as my side salad. 

The B Reuben is by FAR just topped my old best Reuben at Steiners hand down. It looks delicious, fresh, and you just want too manga. The Raisin Rye Bread is so good! It got perfect grill mark from panini press style, toasted perfection nice crispy, and get that toasted crust first thing bite into then rest is unreal. The red cabbage (most places it typical sauerkraut) slaw so much flavor, gruyere cheese, julienne carrots, and russian dressing brings everything full circle. The corned beef nice hot, moist, and could tear up corned beer by itself!!!! I so agree with Misti its Reuben ecstasy next thing know done and not that big of sandwich but good thing got salad. The salad was just as amazing as the sandwich. The israel cous cous is cooked perfectly. The wild mushroom, fresh parm, and all tossed in black truffle vinaigrette. Black truffle oil and mushroom is like peas in pod. They just go hand in hand. It perfect side dish and between both perfect lunch not too heavy but just right! 

The service was top notch from first step in the place was greeted with warm welcome. She explained too me the whole menu, whether it was my first time visit,  and went over the salads. If wanted too try anyone of the salads. She brought out my lunch. She checked up on me during my lunch. You even get dollar off your bill check in on Yelp. Dam it! Between Buldogi and Presto Cafe nice know that restaurant and cares about us Yelpers!

I'm a big fan of turkey, bacon, and avocados, so naturally, my eyes automatically wandered to the Turkey Sandwich! It was just your regular turkey sandwich meant (and imo, needed a bit more avocado), but the thing that jumped out at me was the BREAD. Infused within the two slices were walnuts and dried CRANBERRIES! There wasn't an overload of cranberries, so every time you bit into one, it was like an unexpected burst of yummy-ness! That alone made my trip worthwhile. =]  I also ordered a custard bun, but since we were there so late in the night, it was a bit hard for my liking.

My friend ordered a Greek Pide. I had a piece of it and didn't really like it. But hey, I'm not a big fan of Greek food, nor feta cheese. The taste of the pide did scream ""GREEK"" to me though, so if you are into Greek food, give it a try! I'm sure it's really good =]

Since they opened recently, the cashier/workers were not too familiar with everything nor how the system worked. I had to repeat my order twice before they got it entered into the system (maybe I have an asian accent an I'm hard to understand? I don't know). However, I did appreciate the cook/owner (not exactly sure what his position was) coming out and asking us for suggestions/feedback. It's always a plus to have someone ask how everything was =]

I love this place... It's right in between work and the gym for me, so it's so convenient!!  
When I'm craving for something healthy, they have so many things to choose from: salads, sandwiches, entrees, pides, juices, and even breakfast dishes.  They have plenty of vegetarian main dishes to choose from for days that I don't want to eat meat: the vegetarian sandwich (the goat cheese makes it super tasty), gluten friendly lasagna (interestingly delicious), and Greek pide (my all time favorite).

Another thing that love is their salad bar that's right in your face while you're ordering your food!  You can't help but to add a side of one to your dish! Haha Their seasonal tuna salad is the most popular... They usually run out by dinner, but they'll make you some for you at your request :P

We had a smorgasbord of a little of everything that this place has to offer and OMG what an experience.
 
I love how everything is fresh and beautifully prepared.  I felt like my taste buds went on a well fed tour around the world. Lots of freshly prepared salads both savory and sweet, wonderful smoothies with real fruit ( not the pre-packed processed stuff with ice and sugar) 

The pida's were divine too ! We got to try a little of each flavor and I think I am in love with all of them ! 

We also tried a few of the sandwiches, I brought home a ham one with a nice surprise of Funyuns in it.  We also tried the Ruben that is made with a raisin rye that was right on with the right amount of tang to the coleslaw !

To finish the night we were treated to a nice coconut pastry and a wonderful nut/raisin tart that really completed the meal !!

Needless to say this place was worthy of a review, the owners were great, explaining their love of food  in their life and travels and wanting to bring a new fresh concept to the Spanish Trails neighborhood and they certainly brought that to the plate here.

2798879,2012-10-30,2,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"If you're looking for a good, quick meal Presto Cafe is a solid option. It definitely isn't fast-food in terms of that level of quality (or lack thereof) and the prices reflect that. Don't come here expecting a dollar menu and the typical crap that would be available on one. While not perfect, the food is a tasty step up from many other cafes and fast-casual spots.

They've got a variety of salads, pre-made and laid out on their counter. They're available by the scoop: 1 scoop for $4.25, 2 for $8.25, or 3 for $11.50. The tandoori chicken salad was good, but lacked the bold, spiciness that I expected. 

Their ham and cheese sandwich ($8.99), on the other hand, is packed with flavor and varying textures with its smoked ham, gruyere cheese, blueberries, Funions, and chili mayo on bacon cheese bread. It might seem like an odd combination, but it all worked in a bizarre yet delicious way.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,l2-wK8TRws4xz1BMvTg-oA

This one got a 5 star because although the salad I bought was the Ahi tuna one. the prices were cheaper in store than what the actually online menu stated. The salad was a little wilty but had such amazing flavor that being wilty was not a bad thing and could be easily overlooked. Great place!

2953844,2015-06-15,2,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"Not a fan. Just had lunch at this west side location and I was surprised at the lack of customer service. Judging by the rating and amt of reviews on here (legit or not...I don't know), I was hoping/expecting a pleasant experience. Instead I was not greeted by a single person and my order taken at the counter by a young girl who didn't smile or look up from her register or seem to care about anything at all. Since it was my first time I did have some questions which consisted if ""what's a Pida"" ""how large"" etc. she pointed up at the board and replied... ""Big"". So I ordered a Green Salad and Aush Soup. At the last min I added on a side scoop of couscous and was given a few weird looks by the register girl and a guy I can only assume was the manager/owner? Oh well. Food came out pretty quickly and I was def surprised by the portion size. Both Salas and Soup were LARGE! The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was piled high on a plate with each salad ingredient separated and spilled off the plate each time I tried to mix/eat. For the remainder of my lunch break I observed this establishment. The feeling in there was pretty cold shoulder. 

Now, I will say that while the service from the two most front of house people was terrible and the prices were a bit steeper than I thought...I will give props to the super nice guy who brought out my soup and cleaned my table. I did see him get attitude back from the (possible) manager however he was the only person who was friendly and seemed to genuinely care. He was WONDERFUL!  (GIVE THAT GUY A RAISE). All in All if you don't mind terrible service and the busser/server guy is working the food isn't bad. Just don't expect much. (I will try out Henderson's location to compare)

Presto Cafe is a great choice for any meal, even breakfast! 

The bf and I split the green eggs and ham flatbread for breakfast and it was pretty filling! From the picture you can tell it's as large as the serving tray (the size of two plates). Rest assured that the green part of our dish was actually pesto (pesto makes everything taste better!).

The service was ok, just one person who manned the register and prepared the food when were there in the morning.

Sure, you can get a ham and guyere anywhere, but they sprinkle some dried sweet blueberries and funions to make it even better.  

I truly suggest their meatball sliders, as they are soft, savory, and just the right amount of food.  They provided us complimentary apple and strawberry salad, which was delish and a great contrast to the meaty sliders.  Their reuben is filling and their cole slaw is vinegar based, making for a crunchy, tangy, meaty meal.

It's pretty small in size, and the interior is painted a bright lime green with fake potted flowers as table decoration. When you think about it, everything inside is fitting with the cafe's mission. It's a neighborhood cafe -- they use fresh ingredients from local vendors to make the delicious meals here. It's really refreshing to see places that support healthy and fit lifestyles.

They say that their food is ""healthy comfort food,"" which might seem like an oxymoron when you hear it at first, but it makes me feel a little less guilty for indulging in their fare.

I ordered the Hanger Steak Chimichurri because it sounded amazing. I didn't really wait that long for the food to come out because it surprisingly wasn't that busy when we visited. Anyway, the hanger steak did not disappoint at all! The presentation alone was enticing enough for me to dig in full force. The hanger steak was cooked medium-rare on top of couscous and mushrooms with little dollops of pesto sauce on the sides.

The meat was perfect. It was succulent and it melted in your mouth. The couscous was cooked risotto-style with the mushrooms mixed in there. The pesto sauce brought everything together with its strong pesto taste. For what it's worth, it was pretty filling (well, to me anyway)!

It's a small cafe, but the food they have here really packs a punch! Also, with it being healthier than the other dine-in options around you shouldn't be afraid to go all out. Definitely coming back to try out other menu items.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,9,5,79OF8K1JRgTYKUjkRzhO-w

I knew for sure that I wanted the Blanco Pride and my boyfriend took a few minutes deciding. He ended up get the Ham and Cheese Please. It had funyuns on it!! Amazing!!

I ordered a side of the risotto since everyone was raving about it. I realized that I shouldn't have just a little too late. I'm burnt out on truffles and it has truffle oil all up in it. Truffles are just a little much for me but the risotto was definitely good otherwise.

My pride was amazing. Oh lord. I haven't had something so good in years. I was in love. Drooling and stuffing my face at the same time. I died a little. It was nice and flaky around the edges and had SO MUCH CHEESE. I was in heaven by the end of it and I did eat it all. Well... My boyfriend had a few bites.

This dish totally hits the spot with everything from flavor to texture if you're looking for a satisfying Greek taste. I want to point out the crust because it was flaky and light and did not overpower the flavor of the toppings which is how it should be. It was also super filling and a great portion - I had a little left over because I wasn't that hungry going in. Another thing I look for is how I feel after a meal. Some places ""look"" healthy but you leave feeling gross after eating - not the case with Presto. I left feeling great and satisfied, like what I ate was a clean choice.

On my first visit I had the turkey sandwich ($9) and a brain power smoothie. Turkey sandwiches can be boring, but not here.... The cranberry walnut bread they use is AMAZING, the applewood bacon really complimented the turkey and cheese, and the veggies were very fresh. The smoothie was delicious... But $6 for a 20 oz smoothie is pretty steep. 

On my second visit I decided to go with one of the 8 salads Presto offers up daily. Salads are sold by the scoop, I decided to get two scoops of the strawberry arugula salad and added some grilled chicken for some protein. The salad had everything I wanted, in addition to the arugula and berries it also had sliced green apples and crumbled blue cheese. So delicious.  

Presto's employees are awesome, they give recommendations and carried on conversations without being annoying or pushy. You can tell they are passionate about their work. The next time you are craving a sandwich, skip the chains and support a local eatery. It will cost you a little more but both your body AND your community will be better off if you do so.

They have an interesting breakfast menu they serve all day--the green eggs and ham flat bread caught my attention.

I was hoping for lots of salad options but that's not really their thing.   They have about 5 ""salads"" to pick from - but they're not traditional American, lettuce-based salads.  They're things like couscous, feta, quinoa, corn, spinach w/strawberries and apples, etc. kind of salads.  Not my style but I'm sure they're delicious!  Otherwise they have pretty standard sandwich options, cold cut based.  Since I'm pregnant right now and not supposed to eat cold cuts, I was basically left with the Meatball Sliders.  They were good!  But they came with a green sauce on them (probably a pesto?) that I had to scrape off, not my thing.  They were good size, totally filling for lunch, and they were tasty.  I'd get them again - and just ask to hold the green stuff :)   It came with a small salad on the side, I think it was spinach or arugula (can you tell I'm not a veggie-person??) with strawberries, apple pieces, and some sweet dressing.  Again, totally not my thing and I had to leave it - but I'm guessing lots of people would love it.  It was all very fresh, very ripe and clean and well presented!

The service was friendly and they offer to let you taste just about anything, which I appreciated.  But like I said, it's tiny - there's only about 5 tables to sit at.

Interior: pretty simple lay out.  They have an ad board for events and such in the area. They have a few newspaper articles showcasing their business. Pretty bright and they do have complimentary lemon water towards the front of the restaurant.

Service:  The front of staff which was the juice girl and the manager weren't really spectacular in terms of service.  The manager simply took my order and just started making the food.  No explanation on any of the dishes or the smoothie that I got.  The workers in the back making the food were more friendly.  

Smoothie. I got the morning fix which was a chocolate but mostly nutty smoothie that I can say is far from refreshing. It's more of the post-workout protein drink rather than being the first thing you take in the morning.  The drink was good to me because i love nuts..... (no homo) and i love chocolate.  Fairly priced for a smoothie $5.99 for a 16 oz.

Food: So coming here I had to get the pide and I chose to get the greek style pide.  It was nicely presented and fresh out of the oven.  The pide was a bit too greasy which contradicts the restaurant's aim to be healthy comfort food.  The olives were a bit too pungent for me and next time i would opt to have them removed.

4597899,2014-06-12,1,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I came here with a few of my friends after having read through all these great Yelp reviews. Let me give you a rundown of what I got to try:

1. Greek Pide - I loved it! This ""pide"" is pretty much a pizza with tapenade, feta, and cherry tomatoes--all that good stuff! It's cheesy! I like that. This is a must-try.

2. BBQ Chicken Pide - If I liked BBQ, I would definitely love this; I just had it just to try it. Lol! But it earns extra points because the chicken wasn't bland or dry. It was moist and full of BBQ goodness! Mmmm...

3. Kale salad - This, for me, was THE winner. I love the combination of kale, quinoa, cranberries and feta, but the addition of cashews were what balanced out the dish perfectly! If I had to choose one dish to come back for, it would be this salad.

4. Corn salad - Nothing too special. Still good though!

5. Tropical Wake Up Smoothie - I read the ingredients (pineapple, mango, banana, ginger, coconut water) and thought it'd be a punch of bold, tropical flavors. I was wrong. I downed it, but couldn't help but to think it was underwhelming. I think I just made the wrong choice. I'm sure the other smoothies are delicious! Next time, I will definitely try the Green Goodness Smoothie.

Overall, I think the food here is very well worth the price. You don't come across many places that offer food like this (mostly) under $10. The atmosphere is alright--it's clean and there are plenty of tables. Can't wait to come back and try their sandwiches and breakfast items! :-)",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,3,2,4,XWykm7Xz_yV7Gg4m19Qy8g

4744313,2013-01-25,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"If you are in the southwest area of town, and you have a sandwich craving, look no further than Presto Cafe.  For all the Subways, Port of Subs, Firehouse Subs, and Capriotti's throughout the valley, I haven't really had a chance to enjoy a local sandwich spot until now.  If supporting the local economy isn't enough of a reason to shop locally, Presto Cafe's sandwiches should do the trick.

So far I've had the pleasure of trying:

Israeli couscous salad (wild mushrooms, Parmesan, lemon truffle: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presto-cafe-las-vegas?select=Bkxds9f5hBK3_JoZIbas4g#Bkxds9f5hBK3_JoZIbas4g): I enjoy this salad a lot with the lemon truffle flavoring, but it could use less parmesan and more mushrooms.  Expect cheese in every bite; otherwise it's a great salad.

Strawberry and arugula salad (with blue cheese and sherry): A simpler salad.  I'm a fan of strawberries and arugula on their own, but I can't say I'm a fan of them together.

B. Ruben Sandwich (corned beef, cabbage, gruyere cheese, Russian dressing: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presto-cafe-las-vegas?select=ltbV10WKOaqkKK1A5HGeEg#ltbV10WKOaqkKK1A5HGeEg): Ohhh that dressing.  And that bread.  And that corned beef.  I could go on.  And that cheese.  And I'm done.  On paper it seems like a decent corned beef sandwich.  In your mouth it's an avalanche of juicy ingredients.  Eat this sandwich alone; time spent talking to a dining partner is better spent eating this sandwich.

Ham & Cheese Please sandwich (local smoked ham, gruyere cheese, blueberries, Funions, chili mayo). It's an odd mix of ingredients with the blueberries, but it turns out well.  It's a really good ham sandwich, and the blueberries aren't over powering.

Expect to pay a bit more for a meal here than other places; a sandwich and one scoop of salad will run you about $10 or so.  It is quality food though, so don't let that deter you.  I've only come by during dinner time, and I've been the only customer, yet I noticed that it's taken a while to get my food.  I get that it's made to order, but it took a good 10-15 minutes for my order each time; hopefully it's not a typical thing, since that time could add up if there are multiple customers there.

Presto Cafe has a lot going for it.  I want to try more of their salads, and eventually one of their pides.  They also have a smoothie menu that I haven't had a chance to try.  It'll be hard not to go back and just get the ruben or ham & cheese sandwich again, but that's not really a bad problem to have.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,5,3,4,vFiJIgTKt9uo7AntFC26jQ

4788606,2014-04-17,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"A healthy, fresh, and delicious spot that looks pretty unassuming. A wide variety of healthy Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and American foods...from Greek to Turkish to Indian to Italian to Persian to Israeli to the West Coast and the boroughs of NY. Wide variety of dishes that cater to any meal of the day. The food is all fresh to order and the staff is super friendly. Two downsides are the price (they're not cheap, but do offer bang for your buck) and the overall presentation of the caf√© (the place looks a bit outdated, but I try not to judge a book by it's cover). Personally, I say go with a group and order a bunch of dishes to share. Some recommendations to try? The fresh seasonal salads were unreal. Israeli couscous with truffle oil?! Pickled beet salad! Tandori/Curry chicken (with mango, papaya, and coconut!)...amazing. Had the Pide and was pleasantly surprised. Went for the Greek (olive tapenade, roasted red peppers, pesto) and wanted more! Looking forward to trying the BBQ Chicken next. Had some sandwiches too (Ruben and turkey, both pressed in between some amazing rustic bread). Just Peachy and Green Goodness smoothies were pretty good too, super clean and appetizing. Overall, a great place to grab a healthy bite.

This place is only 4 miles off the strip and pride themselves on providing a healthy, organic, and locally sourced eating experience. 

We came here for breakfast and I can say that it was one of the more memorable breakfasts I've had in Vegas. We ordered 2 smoothies: Veggie Delight and Peach. The Peach smoothie was light and sweet. The Veggie Delight was a hit of unexpected freshness. I had expected it to taste grassy but it's so refreshing with a note of sweetness from the banana. Watch out Whole Foods because this smoothie will give you a run for your money. Their Green Eggs and Ham pide was delicious. I loved the fact that I could get a little bit of the egg yolk on every bite.

I think the magic is in the Raisin Rye bread, which sounds like it shouldn't work, but it definitely does. The ingredients combined for a moment of sandwich magic, and then, ""Poof!"" it was in my belly, and I was thinking I could eat another.

Presto serves ""gourmet"" sandwiches, so don't expect foot long subs for $5. The B.Ruben was $8.99, and it doesn't come with a side, but because they are new, they offered a sample of one of their 8 or so fresh salads, which include a lentil, a southwestern with black bean, a tropical chicken, an arugula and strawberries, a cauliflower...to name a few. The salads are kept on ice behind a display, and by the end of the day, they lacked a bit of the fresh from the fridge luster. But, that is a minor thing. We chose the strawberry and arugula which also included apples, and it was simple and surely healthy.

They also have fresh squeezed juices/smoothies. Again, we chose a recommended option: the Tropical Wake Up with Pineapple, Mango, Banana and Ginger, and it managed to be delicious and healthy tasting. There was no overwhelming added sweetness, just pure fruit goodness. I sucked down every last drop until my cheeks hurt.

The menu includes breakfast too.

5390399,2014-04-29,7,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I'm enthusiastically bumping Presto up to the Holy land of 5 star reviews.  I've done a lot of experimenting of the menu over the last several months and have been nothing but impressed with said experimentation.   Let me cover each item:

1)  Greek Pide:   This was extremely delicious, but it is gigantic.   Sure I should have realized this from looking at pics, but it was so big that I was downright embarrassed to have it sitting in front of me during lunch while customers seemingly on their way in from a yoga workout walked past.  It's also extremely cheesy.   I won't be ordering it again because I'd like to live past the age of 34, but as I said, it's very tasty.   If you have a family of 8 and you're all hungry, I'd highly recommend it.   A bargain at $7.99.

2) Salad with Salmon:   So you can order sides of the salad and then add protein to it.   I thought this sounded like a wondrous idea since I'm kind of obsessed with the kale salad they've been featuring for a while and salmon is always solid.   Well almost always.   I was a little disappointed in the cook of the salmon when I ordered this combo.   It seemed overcooked and not very well seasoned.  

this is where they really start earning the 5 stars

3)  Chicken Marguerite entree with charred cherry tomatoes and asparagus.   This was wonderful.   The chicken was moist and flavorful, the veggies were perfectly cooked, and the sauce tied the whole thing together like the Dude's rug.   at $13 without a drink it was a little more than I usually like to spend on a lunch, but I can say it was worth every penny.   It was the best thing on the menu until

4) Seared Wild Ahi Tuna Sliders.   GET THESE.   I know they're $14 and you've got bills due and child support to pay and you owe the government taxes and you've been laid off and you can get 3 tacos for 25 cents at taco bell.   I dont care.  GET THESE.    The tuna was perfectly seared and seasoned.   The cabbage slaw added great crunchy texture to every bite.   My only complaint is I think it should come with a free scoop of salad as they tend to give a free scoop for the other sandwiches, and these are sandwich-ish.   My logic is sound right?   GET THESE

5)  Pan Seared Salmon with a Chia Citrus Seed Reduction and veggies.   Another delicious dish.   The gentleman who took my order said it was his favorite item on the menu.   I'll be honest I was hesitant with how I felt my salmon was cooked with the side salad, but this was a completely different experience.   The salmon for this dish was perfectly cooked and moist, and the reduction was unique and flavorful.

One last note which helps my 5 star bump is the music here is so in tune to my taste.   If you like ""indie"" rock/pop you'll feel like Presto jacked into your favorite Spotify playlists as you walk through the door.   I constantly am hearing Lorde, Chvrches, Cut Copy, Haim, etc..    It's a never ending game of ""Name that Tune"" with my coworker.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,6,7,5,iqDAD2AWuy3tji2T9DgyRQ

5529232,2012-10-22,6,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I just HAD to come here because the photos of the pides looked so damn good!  

We would normally go to Elements since it's in the same plaza but my wife and I just wanted something quick and relatively inexpensive.  Not sure how many reviews as of now are legit but again...look at those pides!

Staff was really welcoming and friendly right off the bat.  We went with the Italian pide which tasted as good as it looked.  Lots of sauce, meat and flavor.  I'll try the Greek one next time.  

The sandwiches were pretty interesting and not run of the mill.  We tried the ""Ham & Cheese Please"" which included local smoked ham, gruyere cheese, blueberries, Funions, chili mayo on panini grilled country bread.  More sandwiches should have Funions in them!  Who knew?  Yum yum.  

They had 6 or 7 salads to choose from and we went with the tandoori chicken, mango, coconut which was OK.  I thought the chicken could've been more tandoori-y if that makes any sense.  The Israeli couscous, wild mushrooms, parmesan and lemon truffle was decent but that was more of the wife's choice since I'm not into the whole liquid chemical truffle thing.  
 
The quality of the smoothie itself was great.  Definitely on par with Whole Foods or Greens and Proteins.

Overall a solid place though.  A great place for lunch or a quick dinner.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,20,7,4,yntbiCYWdRCRfss2va7lJg

5599518,2013-05-13,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"This is a refreshing spot for the health nuts out there.  I found the store in an article in Blvds LV magazine along with several other veganish places.  Those that know me know that I am down to check out the new joints each time I get, so here we go. 

Funny thing is that I had already had an early lunch, but when you can't eat meat, it becomes difficult to decipher the differences between hunger and cravings.  I figured that healthy gluttony is an oxymoron, thus, cancels each other out, right??

So I got the veggie goodness smoothie and vegetarian sandwich since it was Friday during lent.  They were both delicious and fresh made to order right in front of you.  The menu item names are intriguing and I was easily enticed to plan my next visit to sample the other items.  

Pretty sure this may have been Harold's Fish and Chips...but can't be sure.  If so, I was planning to set a lunch date here one day, sadly, don't think Harold stuck around.  The staff was informative and friendly and the decor was contemporary.  Nothing special to add about either other than the place appeared to be very well kept and managed.  

If you are not in the mood for eats, you can always get yourself a smoothie.  I can also see this place being a good pit stop during a nice jog or following a good work out at the gym.  It almost seems as though this could be one of those places you find in all the fancy shmancy gyms sprouting up all over the valley.  

Other than that, I suggest y'all give this place a try.  Not everything is vegan or vegetarian and believe that there are some meat offerings as well.  

For now, I will have to give this place a solid 3.4, hence, the 3 -star rating based on this experience alone.  Nothing completely blew me away, but ready to update my review rating once I try more of the items...but for now I have delayed this review long enough.

I wish the best of luck to these guys and hope they don't follow Harold...",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,3,01aV4mSD-I5hSb0HIR0BwQ

5653927,2015-02-16,0,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,Presto cafe is a hidden gem. The restaurant is not super huge but it was totally empty when we went in on a Tuesday night around 6. A bunch of people came in to pick up take out orders and that was the only traffic we saw while we were there. My husband got a pide with pork and it was so yummy. He was craving a pizza and the pide hit the spot for it. I got a chicken Greek salad. The portion was perfect. A good sized chicken breast and some beautifully cut up veggies and an amazing assorted chipped olive side with feta. The dressing was the best Greek dressing I've ever tried. We will absolutely be back to try the Greek pide!,WnheFaHC4RyDNTf6scisyg,2,0,5,plmsfLwoi-chUlwG3SRcDw
5734919,2012-10-08,2,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"Found this place cause of Yelp's frontpage mentioning new businesses. They opened two days ago and the inside is very nicely done and super clean. The bathroom even smells nice :D. Take a look at their clock! Pretty nifty. I want one, haha.

I came with a friend - he got the turkey sandwich while I tried the Greek Pide. I only tried it cause of a yelp review but feta cheese is just not my thing. It ruined the whole thing for me but I DID enjoy the bread :). I think I'll try their Ruben (corned beef) sandwich next time. The turkey sandwich was good, though.

I didn't try any drinks, though. They have different stuff for breakfast and for lunch so hopefully I'll get a chance to drop by another day... I came around 7:30pm and most of their stuff were already put away. Come in the day for everything :)! Croissants, salads, and their desserts. Try them all! :0D

They are super nice and they are absolutely open to any suggestions! Feel free to tell them. They want to stay open, after all.

5802178,2014-05-17,1,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I like this place because it strives to be on the healthy side and ""utilizes local resources"" according to their website. Not sure what that means exactly since South Nevada isn't exactly an agricultural hot spot.

Anyhow, the 'pide's' are their thing. Not sure if they invented this quasi-pizza technique or what but I'd never heard of it. We tried the Greek which is the most popular - this was good but it had too much cheese. It's very much like a pizza/calzone kind of thing.

I also got the Steak Chimichurri - it is pan-seared hanger steak with dallops of chimichurri sauce on top of a truffled Israeli cous-cous. The cous-cous isn't too exciting after a while.

I ordered my fella and mom the turkey sandwich with avocado, bacon and cheese on cranberry bread. they are served panini style which was nice touch. Everything was delicious. 

They have lots of salad, breakfast, juice and smoothie options, all made fresh. They also had flat breads that are calling my name for next time.

5983652,2014-02-03,1,7sGcBZwkD4yFLiBLS1WKgA,"I heart Presto Cafe.  The menu is wonderful and the sides are super delicious as well. 

My favorite is the turkey sandwich, it's so addicting. Three words: cranberry walnut bread. Sooo good. This sandwich has a perfect blend of savory, sweet, salty, crunchy, and fatty. It's seriously so good. I like pairing this with a side, usually the strawberry, arugula, apple, blue cheese, with sherry vinaigrette cause I love me some bleu cheese. I also like the ham and cheese please because c'mon, who doesn't want funyuns in their sandwich?

I've had the juices before. They're good, but nothing exciting. 

I've been here many a times and will keep going back. The lack of a 5th star is due to the pricing. I feel like for a sandwich and 1 scoop, it's pretty pricey. They should have like, a 1/2 sandwich (cause a whole sandwich is pretty filling) and 1 scoop combo for ~$8. The bf and I have eaten here before and have spent well over $30 for just lunch alone. Also, the last two times I was here the music was out of control loud. C'mon guys, this isn't Club Presto. But I'm definitely a fan.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,5,1,4,aGBtR0_S-ewaw8iR4I8Dfw
