All we wanted was something simple before our flight and we were glad we have Port of Subs a shot. The workers were very laid back and we got our food in a decent amount of time. The food wasn't anything crazy but it filled us up and tasted pretty good. Just wish there were more items to add into your sandwich, but this ain't subway",_D1IJIac_NqbJJwXiCzz-g,1,0,4,NhP6EvmHyyqOHFuwMFHXIg

IMHO, this is 'as good as it gets' in terms of a sandwich that you can get in an airport. Its way better than the classic junk wrapped in the plastic containers that you usually have to suffer thru.   This is an above average sub - priced extremely well for Vegas airport.  If you need a meal for the plane - this is it.",zBbVrn50u01FBQb2b9aTxA,1,0,5,SutMLls97aLeDNFcIdFghQ

After being robbed of my money from another Restaurant these amazing people accommodated my husband whom hadn't eaten in a day and a half. Very long story. Port of Subs #39 you rock. Thank you so very much. My husband said the Sub was perfect. I would recommend anyone that is close to this Port of Subs #39 at the Airport to eat there. Even if you have to go out of your way a little. If you have a long flight look for this amazing Port of Subs. Warm friendly and excellent customer service.
Sincerely

3511435,2017-11-08,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,Accidentally wrote my review for a Port of Subs at the wrong terminal at McCarran - the one at the D gates is grossly over priced.  Will chose differently the next time I'm passing through Vegas.,-GncuwCES1tfaH_S0gGnmA,0,0,2,AjqnBsYPauc71FpFZ9jsWA
3973865,2018-04-12,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"Read the other reviews for Port of Subs and I think context is important here. We're not just talking about a sub joint, because you can definitely find better ones anywhere. This particular Port of Subs is in an airport, and when it comes to airport food, you know it's going to be over priced, and under edible. 

So with that in mind, I'd say this place hits the spot. I didn't have to take out a loan to buy a sub. And I swear the meat was real meat. That's at least 2 thumbs up there. 

The only issue I had was that when they ask what condiments and toppings you want, you are scratching your head at what's available because it's all placed behind a shield that doesn't let you see any of it. So I simply said I want it all, hoping that they don't sprinkle on top something crazy like Skittles.",ZPqdyTZQtgYgovgnIdBd3w,0,1,3,EzgIi0YnsVNW9l45Y-dgjw
4230430,2017-11-10,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"Just your run of the mill, overpriced, below average airport food. 

Got a bland turkey sub for like $10, and an egg and cheese for $6 which wasn't bad. 

Just average food. 

The staff was all over the place and very unorganized. The cashier stopped taking our order halfway through, walked away and filled up a soda for the previous person in line. Very random and scattered.",oIIno_ryDmjZN8zJe1p93A,0,0,2,LJ1Mxa0W3aKn9UWz1F5fUg

4610683,2017-10-08,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,Located near Gate D 03 the sub I ordered was very overpriced. It cost $18 for a tuna sub with a drink and chips.  The tuna tasted as if it was still frozen including the pickle.  Yuck yuck yuck.  Should've went to the bagel place just past Cinabon if walking towards gate 36.,e4BeVgIkOe771Jl86nR1UA,1,0,1,mxCpS5MscS8WNJ55wkffqg
4951908,2018-03-19,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"MAN I JUST DON'T GET IT. Does America really need another forgettable sub sandwich chain? 

No matter how you slice it (no pun intended) it's just meat on bread with some add-ons. Overpriced. Totally forgettable. I won't be back. 

There's a Quizno's around the corner if you want slightly better forgettable subs. Otherwise eat before you get to the airport.",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,0,0,2,48XOZHCtlDY1dwfYJ6Pf6w
5191775,2017-08-19,0,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"This place is located within the B section of the airport, next to Great Steak. I wanted a sub sandwich for the plane ride because I knew it would hold up pretty good and I was right. I went with the Turkey, Ham and Cheddar with easy mayo lettuce tomato and pickles. My first bite I noticed how fresh the bread was, soft inside with a slight crisp outside. All the ingredients were fresh and tasted really good. Reminded me of Jersey Mikes if you like them. I won't comment on the price because...well...it's in the airport.",o15SFerEo23dMSiY_P2xEw,0,1,4,OLps1kUFuXqWFQ4ZqpyHmA
5226208,2018-06-23,53,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"I'm eating a turkey sandwich as I type this. 

Is it really 4-star quality? Probably not, but I have had a total of eight hours of sleep and three meals in four days (no exaggeration) while researching every poker room in Vegas (almost) for a book. So, it tastes pretty damn good to me. Plus, the service was very friendly, so that's a star boost. 

If I had to describe this sandwich in one word, it would be ""simple."" I have been going to Vegas the past three summers for poker, and I always get this sandwich on the way home. It always tastes ""simple."" 

This is good because it's really challenging to find a good sandwich in an airport, kind of like trying to find Waldo while wearing a blindfold. 

Now let's talk about Mrs. Fields. When I first met her, I was in love with her, but we went our separate ways for a while due to a geographical location change on my end. When we got together again years later, I thought it would be amazing, but something was off. I ghosted her for years after that, but now she has found me again at Port of Subs at the Las Vegas airport. I know what you're thinking, but I had to give her another try because of the way she was looking at me on the other side of the glass. If I had to describe her in one word, it would be ""scrumptious.""",3gRfkaVcEWri-Ju7OQX7uQ,94,81,4,LxthjjQs48nijQGfhD8a0w
5876205,2018-03-28,8,TSNvD7vyrknurZ8H05iyVQ,"When you have a 10pm flight that has been delayed several hours you need food. Port of Subs was the only thing open so I committed.

Service isn't over the top. It's an airport so I don't expect much. I was coldly greeted but my order was taken, I was offered a drink, asked if I wanted double meat double cheese, and I paid. It was seamless.

The meat is sliced to order which was nice and you're asked if you want all the fixings. You're sandwich gets loaded so I was glad I kept my sandwich as is and didn't opt for the the meat/cheese upgrade. The mayo was way too heavy handed for my taste so next time I find myself in this terminal I'm going no mayo/mustard and just oil and vinegar. It tastes better anyway.

Thanks Port of Subs. You helped me survive my hanger and flight delay.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,17,3,FKYblV2VPMuNA9Es3KRxMw
