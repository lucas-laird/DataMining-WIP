650156,2016-06-23,2,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"Best employees at a fast food place hands down, but why In-N-Out has such a following is a mystery. The thing about the burgers is that the meat is great and the buns are nicely toasted, but then things take a turn for the worse.  Upon the nicely toasted bun they spread some sort of mayonnaise based goo they refer to as ""spread"".  Unless you stop them, they will pile up onions that reek to high heaven on top of the great meat.  Your car will smell like In-N-Out for a week if you get take-out.  After such a promising start, the end product is hardly recognizable as a traditional hamburger.

Then there are the fries.  Once again, and this is very encouraging, they start with fresh cut potatoes.  Unfortunately, the put these poor potatoes through some sort of top secret process that turns them into cardboard within 15 minutes after they go into your take-out bag.

Here's an In-N-Out dining tip.  Mercifully, In-N-Out will let you have your burger your way.  Go through the take-out, and just get a hamburger, or even a double hamburger, and the bun. Do not allow them to put anything on the burger.  The bun and the meat are the best parts of the In-N-Out burger.  Take it home and add the things you like.  If you like a good burger, you'll be very pleased.

As for the fries, here's a money saving tip.  Ask them if you can have the little cardboard tray they put the fries in.  Then when you get home, just eat the little tray.  You'll hardly notice the difference.",pI1mlfKEb8dbhuOuEKj4fA,0,0,3,ZxZUiZGhVVsc4uZc_L5DsQ

Also, make sure you ask them to try your card at the window, it will work 10 times out of 10.

The prices are fair. The menu is boring. The service, even when no one is in the line with you, takes forever. My group went there twice. 

The burger was decent. It was not great. It tasted just like a Wendy's burger, just slightly more fresh.

The fries, both times I got them, were bland. Basically tasteless, except for the taste of oil . I would never order those fries again. They are boring. The rest of the people with me got my fries after about the third one I tried. Maybe I should have had a few drinks at the hotel before I tried them, but sober, they are just horrible. 

It gets more than one star because you can customize and they actually listen. The sauce is pretty tasty. Other than that, I didn't see anything remarkable about it. I just like a place that actually listens to your order.


It's fast food. It tastes like fast food. When it comes to fast food, it has some of the worst fries I have ever had. The bun is standard. The meat is standard. The sauce and vegetables being fresh and tasty was what makes it just slightly better.

Guys...it's In-N-Out. When can you ever go wrong with In-N-Out? If you're an East Coaster like me, you know that In-N-Out is the holy grail of West Coast dining and thus you must make a pilgrimage to the nearest In-N-Out location whenever you find yourself within close proximity.

This most recent trip to In-N-Out was a more special occasion because my friend who was traveling with me had never been before. It was exciting to me a part of her first experience and, of course, she loved it. Especially the Animal Style fries.

I'm here to tell you that it's that good. And then some. 

I'll spare you the rundown on what INO is all about - the ""AxB"", the ""secret menu"", fries cooked to order, Animal Style -  you can use the Googles for that. I'm just going to tell you that a Double Double Animal Style is perhaps the most delicious burger in America, and the Animal Style Fries are gratuitous, glutenous goodness. 

One thing to note is that while INO seems like ""fast food"", it is anything but. Food is cooked to order, and combine that with it's popularity and frequent long lines means a wait for your burgers. But that wait is SO worth it. In-N-Out was a must stop for me every time I went to California for my last job, but it had been about 5 years since I had an INO experience.

This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).

I had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places. The fries were really good too. This was confirmed by my vegetarian that accompanied us. He also had the naked burger which is just like a grilled cheese with all the toppings on it. He said that was alright, but really enjoyed the fries. Nice and crispy, and hot too.

2737669,2013-01-15,8,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"Everyone that knows me, knows I LOVE IN-N-OUT!  Yes there is none in Hawaii but if we had one, they would know my name as I would be going there often.  I travel to California and Las Vegas every year for the past 14 years and for the past 10 years I have been eating here at least once every single time.  Yes I truly love this burger, the place (nice and bright and clean), the people (they are always smiling and up-beat and is willing to please), and there is always one some where that I can pull up to and get my fix on.

With all that said, I will get into the nitty gritty about this place as most people know that they have a great burger, shake, and fries.  What I am about to write is what I know and have ordered at one time or another just to see which way I like best ( so far I liked them all ).  Yes, what I'm talking about is their secret menu.  Secret menu?  Yes, they have a menu off the menu you see.  It's so that the normal person won't hold up that already long line trying to figure out what you want.  Kind of like Starbucks and all the different ways to order your drinks.  Wait, you didn't know about that too?  Oh boy, that's for another review.  LOL

Ok the buns here come toasted and burgers are done medium-well.  But you can request that your bun come either no toast or extra toasted.  Make everyone that didn't know you could do it this way and say the two magic words... Medium rare and whoop there it is, a nice pink center that most don't see as they didn't know you could get it this way.

Besides the single and double, you can ask for a THREE BY THREE or FOUR BY FOUR.  Yup you guessed it.... You will get a triple or quadruple cheeseburger.  Before, one could order up to a 100 by 100.  Unfortunately, that is a thing of the past. 

What, you like extra condiments on your burger... No problem as you can get extra for any burger (example for extra mustard) by asking mustard grilled. What the cook will do is put extra mustard on the top of the patty before flipping it so that the flavor soaks into the meat.  Oh yeah!  I'm sure some of you cooks out there is going to try this at home.  

I'm sure here and there you will hear someone ask for ANIMAL STYLE (you can get this with almost any burger).  Animal Style is grilled onions cooked in the delicious meat juices which is combined with extra Thousand Island sauce, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. (btw this is my favorite at the moment but I also add raw onion, yes you can have both)  What, you're feeling that you want that delicious grilled onions and Thousand Island Sauce on your fries.  YES PLEASE, you can do it by ordering Animal Style fries.  YUMMY!

So, you are on a no carb diet!  No problem, you can ask for PROTEIN STYLE.  That's right no buns but you get your burger wrapped in lettuce.  

Some Monkish people prefer to keep their rabbit food and carnivore-ish food separate.  If this is you, you can do this by ordering a SALAD ON THE SIDE.  If the employee is a newbie and doesnt know how to do this, then you can ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and if you want onions on the side.  To be really sneaky and get the most out of it, you can also ask for an extra packet of spread and BOOM you got yourself your own side salad at no extra cost.

Now we come to the FLYING DUTCHMAN. This is for all those who are looking for something Mr. Atkins would come out of his grave and give his stamp of approval.  Two slices of melted cheese between two burger patties.  No bunny food, no carb loading buns, just pure protein.  You could do animal style with this as well but they will but they will put the onions with the cheese but the Thousand Island Sauce and pickles on the side as it would be too messy and get all over you unless that's your thing.  Hey some of you are strange individuals.   

You have a friend, (we all have that one friend who is vegan or vegetarian. Yes there is a difference) no problem.  Just ask for the GRILLED CHEESE.  You will get a toasted bun with two slices of American cheese melted perfectly between the two buns.  If you want you can even ask to get the standard lettuce, tomato, and raw onions inside.

I like In-N-Out fries but I LOVE McDonald's fries better.  If you are like me, you can order your fries differently as well.  If you want them extra crispy, just say, WELL DONE.  The fries will come out more dry and crunchy. If you like opposite 180 then ask for LIGHT and you will get that limp and oily and just add salt and there you go.  Some like the TWO MINUTE fries which is still crunchy and a little raw in the middle.

Last but not least is the shake and floats.  You have the standard choice of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.  What you want all three?  You got it!  Ask for the NEAPOLITAN.  So you want to wolf down a nice cold one without struggling to suck out the goodness?!?!?!  Then try ask for the ROOT BEER FLOAT.  You will get a half cup of root beer topped with a swirl of vanilla soft-serve",ETt5294q4Xm1ZB8EX28Ejw,14,10,5,uWpxe9vCKMPbzud8QlMlyQ

Their well known French Fries are so fresh that you can see them making it from scratch of cutting the potatoes into slices and frying them. In-N-Out also have the ""Secret Menu"" where you can order tons of stuff. You can find the ""Secret Menu"" in their website. The ""Animal Style Fries"" from the secret menu is the one I usually order and trust me, IT'S THE BEST! It has fried onion and their ""spread"" sauce. If you want to be fit, they have the ""Protein Style"" burger where instead of buns, they replace it with lettuce.

If you want more spice in your burger, they offer the ""Yellow Chili Pepper"" as one of the condiments. The chili taste very good with the burger and would probably make you sweat a little. Add the ""spread"" sauce to your burger and experience the taste of it. It may taste something that is very familiar.

If you want some dessert, you should try their shakes! Their shakes are very delicious and will make your stomach satisfied and happy.

Their fast food restaurants are always busy in the drive thru and inside. The facility inside In-N-Out is alright. They always have someone to clean up the restroom and the dining room.

Leaving the ghostbar one night, the luminous In-and-Out sign called out our names so we grabbed a taxi. When we arrived, ravenous from the images of double-doubles dancing in our heads, we started to pay the driver. He said ""no, no. I'll wait for you"".

3172796,2018-01-04,0,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"I honestly don't get what the fuss is over this place. If you mention In N Out to a casual, you get the same reaction as a middle aged housewife listening to Dave Matthews Band - endless fawning and drooling. The service is decent, but the order takers have no clue as to what's going on. The problem itself lies to the use of a ""secret menu."" I don't refer to the tiny menu the restaurant has, but rather a set of secret code words to order your food to make it sound like you're ""cool"" and ""one of them."" And they can't even get THAT right, as my ""mustard fried"" burger came out tasting the same like one of their normal burgers!

Let's talk about the burger itself. They are two ounce patties, and although the menu tops out at double-double, you can have four of these patties on your sandwich. But no bacon. Almost every other fast food restaurant allows bacon for an extra charge. But not at In N Out. They're special.

The standard burger (Yes, I'm calling it a burger here, deal with it fanboys) comes pre-dressed with lettuce, tomato, onion and this crap called ""Spread."" Spread? What the #$!%@ is spread? Well it's a combination of ketchup, mayo and relish. I like these, but how hard is it to just mix it separately? Why make matters more complicated? You can customize your burger, but why not just do what Five Guys does? That being order the burger and then they ask what you want, and not assuming a set selection of toppings. Simplify.

The fries suck. Not sorry. They are cheap, but what you pay for is what you get. You get this tiny school lunch size carton with the tiniest, driest fries this side of McDonalds. They're not fries. They're fry-ettes. You can supposedly put this ""animal style"" sauce on the fries for no extra charge, but why should I have to guzzie up my food with something that looks like emesis?

They also serve Coca-Cola products, but they can't even get THAT right! Do you want Sprite? Tough break, you get 7-Up, instead. These people had 7-Up in their lineup for years and don't feel the need to switch, I guess.

Don't let the huge line fool you, folks. In N Out is overrated, overhyped and simply not worth it for the miniscule, medicore meal you get.

Oh, you're looking for a compliment? It's inexpensive. There.

As for me, if I get dragged into one of these places, I'll go IN... N I'll head right back OUT to a better place. Like Five Guys.",rurUuAf8E_lNfHRV030zCw,0,0,1,BdNANdyyEzG-ZuwTRdQmGA

But souvenir shopping accomplished, I realized I was not in the mood to stay in Sin City as a solo, squandering my earnings and tarnishing my spirit in a land of debauchery.  Sin is more fun with company.

Instead I headed towards Death Valley, a better match for my mood.

And there, on the outskirts of town, where the concrerte meets desert, it was.  In-N-Out.  And I was hungry.

I had heard the legends.  Tales of mysterious lingo and off-menu items known only to the initated, the In-N-Out Illuminati.

what i ate:
- protein style cheeseburger, animal style: after eating plenty of snacks in the VIP lounge at my hotel, i wasn't that hungry. my friend suggested i get it protein style. ""it's just a snack without the buns!"" well said, friend, well said; just reinforcing the reason why we are friends. it was my first time having it protein style and i do like it. it's much more refreshing, but i would miss the buns if i was hungry. 
- fries well done: love getting my fries well done, more oil, but better texture

pros:
- cheap! so afforadable
- delicious!
- this location was way less busy than the one further south on the 15. although my friends and i did go at 2 in the afternoon or so

cons:
- a ten min drive from the strip. oh the horror

That shouldn't be a problem since I eat at In-N-Out at least once a week.  My favorite is their Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast.  It really doesn't get any better than this and it's less than $4.00.  I'll make it a 3x3 if I'm a little hungry.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  Recently, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (2 patties & 2 slices of cheese only) to keep the starches low.  In my opinion, In-N-Out is one of the most consistent fast food joints out there. All that being said, I don't avoid too many In-N-Outs, but I do avoid this one.  The lines inside isn't too long, but it seems to take them a little longer to cook just two patties and cheese.  The drive thru lines always seem to be long and snakes through the parking lot.  Most locations will have a staff member taking your order before you get to the window to speed up the process when it gets busy.  This location doesn't do that, at least they didn't the last 3 times I've been here.  Then there's the cleanliness of the restaurant. I'm spoiled that I live very close to the cleanest and least busy In-N-Out in Las Vegas.  My In-N-Out is always spotless.  This location was a little behind on cleaning up a few tables the last 2 times I've been here.  Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. Regardless, I'm sure that I will be back to this location at some point. I just never know when I will have those In-N-Out cravings.

Not sure if it tastes so much better because we don't have one in Hawaii but the burgers are very delicious. Usually get animal style everything although you should eat the fries quickly or it will get soggy if you do t eat them fast enough. For the amount of burgers people order they are pretty fast.

I was too lazy/disorganized to study up on the secret menu, and not overly hungry, so I ended up with a chocolate milkshake and a regular cheeseburger sans onions and tomato.

The chocolate milkshake was nothing impressive, and I'd skip that next time.  The burger was surprisingly good for a fast food joint - much better than McDonalds and even preferable to my usual choice of Wendy's (not that I eat fast food burgers that often).  Service was efficient, if uninspired, plus there was the minor snafu mentioned above but that's pretty tame by fast food joint standards.  Plenty of available parking.

In-N-Out was a perfect stop...I wish they would build one on the Strip.

It was fun to go with Kevin because he is a local California guy but he is the first California person to actually teach me something knew about  In-N-Out.  I have known about the secret menu for years but Kevin introduced me to the In-N-Out Hot Peppers...I had no idea we could get these for our burger and they were spicy hot.

I also think I might have taught Kevin something too...but he would not admit it.  He got his fries animal style and I got my fries well done.  We decided that it would have been amazing if we got them well done and animal style for the same order...I can not wait to try that.

The burgers were amazing but that is always a given...they work magic with there food.  Kevin also talked me into getting shakes too...so we had a feast...we also wore our In-N-Out paper hats and emailed photos to all of our friends/co-workers who were stuck in those boring expensive dinner meetings on the strip.

Ah, heck with it, 5 star it is.  My only complaint about In-N-Out is the fries.  I don't know why I don't like them, I think that they're too fresh, as they taste too much like a raw potato to me.  Freeze them first or something!

In-N-Out is one of the few things I really miss about Vegas.  Too bad they're not a franchise, I'd love for one to open up in the Dallas area.",Y1g96rqX62YsVxV2xztEjg,0,0,5,7YUCHB7FdY-sHW6AOG1kpg

4459224,2016-06-10,7,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"Adapted from an earlier review of this place:

I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.

I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  

You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  You also can tell that they use fresh produce.  It was cool watching the guy peel potatoes for their fries.

I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well. 

Finally got around to trying the lemonade, and nothing special about it.

Two things make this a 4 star experience for me.  This first thing is them starting, to my knowledge, the secret menu!  I like ordering things animal style and doing the different variations that comes about from the secret menu.  The second thing is there is not an In-N-Out Burger franchise anywhere in Louisiana nor Houston.  Rarity gets them that extra star over a normal fast food chain.",5O0ejMUB7XHzyTf1rLu2zQ,10,8,4,gjDMp7mcZ_mvHuPFLGZEWg

4511680,2012-12-28,4,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"For those few people not familiar with In-N-Out Burger, it is a chain that has a very small list of menu items.  They make hamburgers, cheeseburgers, double doubles (hamburgers with twice the meat) that all come with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a secret sauce.  They also have french fries, sodas, and milkshakes.  That's pretty much everything listed on the menu.  

However, those in the know can personalize their burgers in a surprising variety of ways.  My favorite option is protein style where the bun is replaced with a large pieces of crisp lettuce large enough to hold it all together.  Others will order theirs animal style with grilled onions, though I find this messy if you don't have a bun to absorb the extra liquid.  You can also skip the patty altogether and order a grilled cheese sandwich if that is more your thing.

I took a trip through the drive through at this location on my way out of Las Vegas.  I ordered my usual favorite - a cheeseburger, protein style, with ketchup instead of the sauce, with onions.  They made it perfectly.  The lettuce, onion, and tomato were crisp, and there was just the right amount of ketchup so that the burger was not dry nor was it soggy.  The fries were crisp, golden, and steaming hot.  I don't know what it is about the fries at In-N-Out, maybe the oil they're fried in, that makes them so tasty.",WqrwIIhDfNpf_B-K9jx4KA,5,5,4,Y2_rrIr2DqzveoLOqlkLHA

Everyone talks favorably about the food and every time I drive by, they are busy...someone please explain!

Maybe I'm just having bad luck. The first time I went, the fries were overcooked, and the burger was just ok. So, I thought I'd give them a second try. I mean, there has to be a reason so many love it. 

So I went again a year later, and this time, the fries were not as overcooked, but still were just not that good. It's hard to explain, but they have a strange aftertaste or texture I can't place. I still ate them, but with catsup (which I NEVER use normally). 
But the big disappointment was the burger this time. It was so dried out. I was wishing there was more of their sauce on it to make up for the meat, but it was just not there. Sigh.

There is almost a cult like following of fans for this place, and I'm sure I will be hated by many for my review.

I enjoyed my inaugural In'N'Out experience.  The double double with fries was excellent.  For me, what sets In'N'Out apart is the freshness of the accoutrements - the lettuce and tomato were crisp and delicious.  The beef and cheese were tasty as well, but as a Chicagoan, I've had the same flavors at Billy Goat and Wolfy's.  They, like In'N'Out, have excellent, fresh ground beef.

The fries at In'N'Out are superior in that they are thin and crispy - thin yellow fries a la McDonald's, but fresher, and (sadly) much shorter.  What is up with half inch fries?  But that is a minor quibble to their usability.  They were quite tasty.  

What I loved most was the chocolate milk shake -- loaded with chocolate and very creamy.  A five dollar shake at half the price, and it did not even need the bourbon.

4856726,2011-10-27,0,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"The menu at In-N-Out Burger is as simple as it gets: you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger or a double-double (double meat and cheese), which are served with or without fresh or grilled onions. Fries and soft drinks are also available, as are three varieties of shakes, but that's about it.

So what makes a visit to In-N-Out something many visitors to Vegas have to do? Aside from the fact they use natural, fresh ingredients, keep their restaurants very clean, and treat their employees very well, they've also created a mystique about themselves by limiting their stores to California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and developing a cult-like following of carnivores in the process. While their burgers are superior to what you might find at the fast food outlets run by a shifty clown or creepy king, some describe their burgers and shakes as fast food bliss, and it's not uncommon for some guests to make it their first stop in Vegas from the airport while en route to their hotel.

Price is also a factor, as you can easily feed two for under $15, and for as little as $10 if you don't want to gorge yourself.

And then there's the whole ""secret menu"" thing. Walk up to the counter and ask for your burger ""animal style"" and receive extra pickles, extra spread (their secret sauce), grilled onions and mustard fried onto the patty. Or ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, or a protein-style burger (served without the bun), or opt for their 3x3s or 4x4s (three burgers and three slices of cheese, or four burgers and four slices of cheese). While a 44 is the maximum, some stores will allow their zealots to go a little crazy with orders for a 2020, and an infamous 100100 was once ordered right at thilocation here in Vegas.

Unfortunately, there's no In-N-Out Burger located strip side, so you will need a car to get to one. If you've rented a car, your best best is taking a quick, two-minute drive behind New York-New York on South Dean Martin Drive just off West Tropicana Avenue (route 593). Walking there is not advised. Don't do it.

If you don't have a car, taking a cab is always an option, but I would recommend heading to the location at 2900 West Sahara Avenue to avoid traffic and for getting the most bang for your buck. It's a $15 cab ride (each way) from the middle of the strip, but you can make the most of your trip by stopping into Palace Station, which is just down the street. 

You can also save the cab fare and get to this In-N-Out location using public transportation. Just hop on the Strip and Downtown Express Bus heading north from one of its many strip-side stops, and transfer onto the 204 at Sahara and Santa Paula heading west. This trip will cost $5 (which will let you use the city's buses for two hours), or spring for the 24-hour pass that is a bargain at $7 and will give you enough time to explore downtown Vegas and the Fremont Street Experience, the World Market Center, and the Las Vegas Premium Outlets the next day, and meet a bunch of interesting characters on your travels.

I messed up and said I was eating in my car (as opposed to taking it home to eat) because I've never been asked that question in a drive thru before. The guy was so understanding as he was handing me a placemat and he ran to tell them to pack it up for take home and all with that friendly 'I'm here to serve you' demeanor. THANK YOU!

4975492,2016-11-28,0,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"This is a review for the In-N-Out Burger on W. Sahara Ave (just down the street of Palace Station). For those staying downtown this is the closest location (from Main Street head towards Las Vegas Blvd South and make a right on Sahara Ave).  This location may out of the way of the Las Vegas Strip, however, it is also not as crowded and frequented by visitors as much as the one off Tropicana Ave. One reason being this location does not have the souvenir shop. But if you're going just to satisfy your craving, be sure to check this location out the next time your in Vegas! Don't get me wrong, this location can still fill up too, however, the locations closest to the Las Vegas strip are frequented by a lot of tourists from all over too. :)  Being from Hawaii, I always look forward to In-N-Out Burger! Still crossing my fingers for a location to open up in Honolulu, Hawaii.

People who have never been here always tell me, ""small menu?"". Yeah, small menu, but big on taste! If you're doing it right, you don't need a big menu! The burgers are always juicy and mouthwatering!  The French fries are always  crisp and fried to perfection! I have since learned there are items you can order that ARE NOT on the menu board! Whaaaat? You gotta find out or ask someone who knows! Yummy!!! As always, I always order the Double-Double Meal A, with a side order Double-Double whenever I am here! (Haha). The milkshake is also to die for! 

There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but you gotta try it to believe it! Juicy, delicious and mouthwatering!

Most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, however, they can fill up pretty quickly especially during lunch and dinner/late night hours. The line inside to order may appear long as you walk in but I've noticed they tend to move fairly quickly.

The next time you are in Las Vegas, make a stop at In-N-Out for the experience! :p",ACevyfccyNxXntWld8hvmg,0,2,5,GcECg3S-9yRghDbOJ_zofA

I'm pretty sure Abraham is the guy who took my order, and he was a Five! So happy to be there, offered me a water cup when I said no soda, just emanating joy. The burger though, it was sad, I asked it if it had had a death in the family, it didn't even crack a smile. 
 Maybe because I always get the Double, but this poor thing could have been vegetarian! Paper thin meat, I always get extra onions, and even that wasn't a lot! It was just sad. The fries weren't hot! i have NEVER bumped into that before at an In-n-Out, however I didn't ask them to fix it, and I know they would have. They happiness of the server made up for the sadness of the burger.
 It was clean, and twice someone came out to clean again, even though they were slammed!
 Always try to go when it isn't Lunch or Dinner rush! They run out of tables very quickly. Not a rush time and it's golden.
 I asked the family next to me and they said the shakes are really good, I have never tried one, but will next time.
 Parking, again, not during a rush is plenty, during those times though it can be awful.

I wasn't hungry so it's my fault for ordering what I ordered: The hamburger combo: burger, fries & drink for around $5.60. Cheap eats. Maybe that's part of the appeal.

I made a rookie mistake. Since I have never been to an In-Out before here is my advice for future newbies like me: Get the Double, Double. You might as well get it animal style too (grilled onions, spread & mustard seared into your patty.) 

While I appreciated the abundance of veggies in my burger it completely lacked any flavor. My fries was also cold by the time I received my order. Like it was sitting out two minutes too long on the counter. I know because I was watching the prep action. It seems each worker is assigned to a station responsible for only one or two things. It appears whomever was responsible for getting the finished product out to the customer was sleeping on the job. SO my cold fries was not good which only made for a more disappointing experience.

Don't know if I would go back since there are other burger joints I would like to check out next time. Shake Shack & Five Guys is going on my to-do list.

Not, ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW..."" to which I always respond, ""You know, I was thinking about it, but since you asked, no. I will never try your new....""

So, anyway, first of all, they are so friendly. They always anticipate my needs. For example, I was asked if I wanted onion on the double-double I just ordered, and I said I was unsure because it was for a friend. He replied, ""That's okay, I'll just put it on the side for you.""

So, friendliness ... oh, and they have never, EVER messed up my order. I always order my burgers with ketchup, mustard, pickles, and grilled onions, and that is always how I receive them. Oh, and we haven't even talked about the fries yet. In n Out fries are the bizzomb.

When I'm sick, I crave shakes. Again from their not-so-secret menu I get the Neapolitan shake. The shakes are so thick that you can really taste all three flavors individually. I love it when it goes from vanilla, to strawberry, to chocolatey. It's more bang for your buck!

Wait, that is exactly what most California transplants do. I have to say I just don't get it. We happened to be doing In-N-out burger for lunch at work today and I was going to pass and just grab something from the bakery next door but I decided to see just how unlike in n out I could make the burger and well.... It worked. They made my burger exactly how I asked for it, a double double, mustard grilled, with chopped hot peppers.. Yes I said chopped hot peppers and animal style. 

Now that you have swallowed that In-N-Out put hot peppers on my burger I will just put it out there. In-n-Out is Ov-er-rated. The burgers are not anything that stands out as being all to spectacular and the fries even when you request well done fries so they come out crispy instead of mushy they are still lack luster. My recommendation would be to take out a personal loan from your bank and hit up the nearest fat burger.  

Basically it is safe to say that if you have never been to an in-n-out you may want to try it to build your own opinion but it is nothing that really makes me say wow.

The food is extremely fresh and cooked to order. The secret menu is absolutely delicious (my favorite is the animal style fries-- it's a meal on its own) and for people on diets, INO offers protein style burgers that replaces the bun with lettuce. Do a quick Google search for ""In-N-Out secret menu"" and you'll get the full rundown. 

Drive-through is normally faster than getting it in the store but if you want to preserve the taste you should definitely eat it immediately after purchase. It's still amazing slightly cold, but there is a big difference when you eat it fresh off the burner. 

Although the location may have something to do with it (university campus), lines are almost always present at any INO in the Vegas area. Despite that, it's plenty worth the wait.

We grabbed their fries, a few double-doubles, and a couple of shakes (chocolate and vanilla). We could only slightly tell the difference between the chocolate and vanilla. Not sure if that's a bad thing, but if I have a craving for a chocolate shake, I'll likely go elsewhere.

The DD was great! Juicy without being over-greasy. Just enough for lunch without feeling guilty. They know what they're doing. The bun was soft but had a slight crisp that worked very well with the lettuce and tomatoes. We option for onion which I normally love but I'm not sure it added anything.

They use 100% pure beef burgers, hand-leafed (as opposed to shredded) lettuce, and sponge dough for the buns. You can taste the quality. 

I like their lettuce wrapped burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). They call it  ""protein style.""

Their french fries are actual slices of potatoes. I personally prefer the processed style fries at other restaurants (they mash the potatoes, reform them into sticks, bread them, and fry them). However, there is something homey and oddly nostalgic about natural fries cut from actual potato slices.

But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go.

As we walked into In-N-Out  I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little
surprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries. 

My sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-) 

Honestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back..

I think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries..

I also have never seen such hard workers at a fast food joint, which definitely earns a star in my book!

They are so good and so worth trying out if you have never been here! (If your saying what about the south end of the strip there is another down your way off Tropicana, it is always packed! This one is not far from Palace Station)
There is also a secret menu (Animal Style) it is not on the board make sure to ask for this you can have on your burger and fries! 
We have been to this location many times and have always had good food. The drive through is pretty fast, everything is always so fresh tasting. You can see through the window they are cutting fresh fries they are not frozen!

5830146,2017-11-08,183,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,"Auf unserer Rundreise haben wir häufig die Restaurantkette In-n-Out Burger besucht, die mit dem Versprechen ""Quality You Can Taste"" wirbt. In Las Vegas , an der Sahara Avenue, sind wir eingekehrt, da die Filiale am Strip total überlaufen ist. Im Internet konnte ich nachlesen, dass es das Unternehmen bereits seit 1948 gibt und es mittlerweile ca. 300 Restaurants im Westen der USA und Texas gibt.

Am späten Abend war hier der Andrang nur mittelmäßig. Die Auswahl war einfach, da es nur drei verschiedene Burger und Pommes zur Auswahl gibt. Wenn man es dann zur Bestellung geschafft hat, bekommt man eine Nummer, die dann aufgerufen wird sobald die Bestellung fertig ist.

Auf die Burger kommt nur gekühltes und kein gefrorenes Frischfleisch, das von der eigenen Fleischfabrik innerhalb von 24 Stunden geliefert wird. Die Kartoffeln für die Pommes werden im Restaurant aus frischen Kartoffeln hergestellt. Ich konnte es selber in der offenen Küche sehen, wie ein Mitarbeiter die Kartoffeln geschält und gewürfelt hat.

Preislich bewegt man sich trotzdem weit unten, da man auf eine umfangreiche Auswahl verzichtet. Wenn man mit mehreren Leuten hier einkehrt, sollten die anderen ein Plätzchen im Restaurant sichern, da diese zu den Stoßzeiten ebenfalls rar sind.

Vor den meisten Läden findet man zwei gepflanzte Palmen, die gekreuzt wachsen und eine Anspielung auf den Lieblingsfilm des Inhabers ""Eine total, total verrückte Welt"" sein sollen. Eine weitere Marotte sind angedruckte Bibelstellen auf den Unterseiten der Getränkebecher.

Von der Qualität des Essens und dem Preis- Leistungsverhältnis waren wir wirklich begeistert. Unser Lieblingsrestaurant während unserer Rundreise.",--2vR0DIsmQ6WfcSzKWigw,207,200,5,K8LGQQyUEPYjYuh6Hp81yw

The Amazing and always Super happy staff is ALWAYS a nice encounter. The food speaks for itself, fresh burgers with ultra fresh toppings with a unique bun and sauce.

They have a nice selection of drinks as well, I really like their pink lemonade and iced tea. They also make great handmade milkshakes as well which are a nice treat with a burger and fries.

I love their special sauce, I always ask for extra packets of it to dip my fries in if I don't order them animal style. I am not that crazy about the fries, sometimes they are so thin they are just too dry. If they would change their fry style I think that would be one of my dreams come true!

Ok that's pretty simple right. She got it wrong 3 times she gave me a animal style burger with a reg fry and a drink ???? How do you get that out of what I just said?????? Must have been daydreaming or had a blonde moment but usually In N out is on point 100% of the time. I waited about 20 minutes for my food and the place was practically dead. Cali In N Outs get the job done but Vegas man they need to regroup and weed out the slackers and hire people that are worth 11 an hour.

You know you'll get through a drive-thru lane that's wrapped around a building when they have a team of folks taking your order outside. This is a usual sighting at most In-N-Outs. Robots I tell you. ROBOTS! 

Decided to drive through and we were in an out (pun intended) in less than five minutes. We had about ten cars ahead of us so I found this incredibly impressive. My classic order is the double-double, animal style. Those grilled onions are money. I'm not a fan of their fries but this visit I snuck a few from my buddy and they kinda hit the spot!

At a moments glance you have this 1950's ice cream soda pop shop vibe, which adds to the experience of the In-N-Out Burger. Yes, it is true this is the spot for cheap eats, but expect to wait your turn because there will be a line depending what time you go. We went around 5PM or so and it was busy.

I do like the fact you can observe your food being prepared and that they use real ice cream for the milk shakes. What's even better is the off the menu items and ordering terminology this place has. If you don't know what I'm talking about...you better ask somebody or keep reading the previous reviews.

I thought by going to this location on Sahara, I wouldn't have to deal with the crowds. The parking lot was packed and we actually had to wait for someone to leave so that we could park.  It was crowded inside but the line moved fairly quick. Customer service was great, like it is at all of the other In-N-Outs I've been to. 

What I love about In-N-Out is the simplicity of everything. They have such an easy and simple menu but it works perfectly. I got my usual Double-Double with fries and it didn't let me down. I finally tried their chocolate milkshake which was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.

What an unpleasant experience at this location.  As busy as this place is you'd think that the manager would have qualified/competent cashiers manning the front instead they had one girl (unfortunately we got her) that must have been very new and wasn't aware of how to key in items and one who just walked away from her register for a good ten minutes allowing the lines to wrap around the restaurant.

Number 2 (cheeseburger) mustard fried with onions add chopped chilies AND ketchup in the burger along with their fabulous spread with an Arnold Palmer. Lady taking my order repeated my order and didn't mention ketchup. So I asked ""Did you get the ketchup on the burger too?"" She said (with extreme confidence) ""Yes!"" I pull up to the window to pay. The lady there (not sure if she was the same one taking the order thru the speaker) repeats my order back to me. Once again no mention of ketchup. I ask if they got the ketchup on the burger. She says no but she'll get it added on. I get my receipt at 4:40 and then wait for the 2 cars in front to go and it's not a long wait before they pull off. I pull up to the window and wait longer than the last two cars. I get my food at 4:52. Guess what? You got it! NO KETCHUP IN MY BURGER and the fries are overdone. So In-N-Out is known for their burgers, fries, and shakes. They got 2 out of 3 wrong. And that's just because I didn't get a shake so you can't screw that up I suppose. If you're gonna only have 3 things on your menu perhaps those three things should come out right. My Arnold Palmer however was made correctly hence the one star. Lady at the food window did also apologize for the wait so that was nice. I'm not in a rush so I don't have a problem waiting, but if I wait and they still get it wrong, that kinda sucks.

The claim is the burgers are never frozen, the fries are hand cut every day , the lettuce is washed fresh every day and the buns couldn't be fresher.  I believe all of this is true.  I will add that the buns are toasted perfectly.  There is a special sauce on the burger that gives it a nice tangy flavor.  The fries also have a perfect crunch and great flavor.
