They have a menu and a pot station.  The menu has most Sichuan dishes that you can ask for and of them that I have had, they are all good.  ChongQing Chicken- spicy, loads of pepper, perfectly fried.

The main reason you come here is the pot though.  It's a per-weight, serve yourself into a bowl and they cook it for you in a spicy (or not) soup, bring it out to you once it is done.  Veggies are one price, meats are another price. 

It's the real deal.  Supremely flavorful, spicy, and fresh.  Wow tasty.

Why not 5 stars then?

Watch the scale.  Now watch the check.  Now watch them not always match up. Did you order rice?  Double check, it might be on the check....  It's been a few times, and the difference isn't huge, but it's there.",hBLPLzTW6j7zHDd0Rk1xww,2,0,4,cLT5da6nqM5RygvSI_RTvg

They weighed with the bowl and didn't subtract the weight of the bowl. So 6 slices of meat (sushi Dhabi style) charged 4.57 . A simple thing of subtracting the bowl price made a huge difference.

When I first entered, I was seated immediately. The girl asked me if I was ready to order (in Chinese), and I wasn't sure of what she said. When I called her over later on, she said I asked you if you were ready to order and you didn't say anything. Uh... ok... Anyways, their menu doesn't seem to have many options just a lot of noodles and broth dishes. It could also be that I wasn't looking very closely.  I don't like peanuts so the dan dan mian wasn't a good option for me. I fell back to one of my favorites- beef noodle stew. The bowl is pretty big. It came with maybe 6 or 7 small pieces of beef. I'm used to huge chunks of beef, so it wasn't what I was expecting. There were many a few tiny pieces of vegetables. Maybe they just do things differently here. Since it wasn't what I was used to, I didn't really like it. The noodles were also different. They were white rice noodles (I believe), and they tasted overcooked. The broth was a bit watery. It did have the spicy flavor that I was used to, but it didn't taste that awesome to me. 

They were pretty fast with serving my food as in I ordered, and they brought it out in less than 5 minutes. So the soup is probably pre-made, and perhaps the noodles were also pre-cooked and they heated them again? That could be why the noodles tasted overcooked. Other than taking my order and bringing my food out, the servers ignored me. Another gentleman gave me my bill and took payment. He must have noticed me getting antsy. I was going to go up to the counter and pay there, but he brought it to me. 

The menu doesn't seem to have a lot of variety or food that I like. I don't know if I would go there again.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,1,3,Aub2Uaeiueas86fKSU5KlQ

Loaded up the two bowls with various meat and vegetable items for the hot pot.  Went to get everything weighed and the spice negotiation process began.  I asked for a 3/5.  Upon seeing my pasty white complexion, they countered with a 1/5.  We settled on a 2/5.  Although a 2/5 was fairly spicy, I should've held my ground...oh well.

Thank God I'd read other reviews here so I knew not to eat the peppers!  :)

The food was great and something I can't get back at home.

My advise: don't over estimate your pallets for spice, it is hot!

The other weird thing was that no one in the restaurant was speaking over a whisper level. It was like a creepy library or one of those silent ramen joints in Japan.

Yunan Garden is a much better choice from what I can see plus they don't overdo the oil thing on all the food.

Here's my breakdown....

TIP:  The hot pots are build-your-own.  You go up to the front, fill up one bowl with your veggies and such, then fill up a different bowl with meats.  They weigh them  (sold by weight) ask you for spice level, then cook it for you and serve.

GOOD 1:  They have awesome Hot Pots.  Read my TIP for how that works.  It'll save you a lot of time as there almost nothing in English in this place and the conversations skills of the staff are fairly limited.

GOOD 2:  The prices are very reasonable.  We had a couple of hot pots and a beef & mushroom dish we shared between 3 people with soft drinks for around $50.  We could have saved money and did without the beef dish as the Hot Pots were plenty of food.

GOOD 3:  The staff is very friendly.  While it may be a little difficult communicating if you only speak English, they do a good job and servicing your needs.

GOOD 4:  We asked for some transportation to get back to our hotel and they hooked us up with the Chinese Express.  Literally a guy (like a family friend) in a newer mini-van scooped us up and gave us a lift to our hotel for $10.  

BAD 1:  The only thing that I could possibly see needing improvement is some English translations for many of their menu items.  The menu has some pictures but is almost all in Chinese.   

Overall....

We all really enjoyed this place and it's the newest addition to my ""short list"" of off-strip places to eat when I'm in Vegas.  The food was super tasty and filling.  I really like the ""weigh & pay"" style of building your Hot Pot.

I was a little hesitant at first, have had Yunnan food before and most of them were all too spicy to where I couldn't taste anything but the chili oil. This broth was actually very good, you can definitely taste the chili and tongue got a little numb, but you can still taste the broth which was delicious. You can add noodles from the bar, or ask for rice and its awesome. I can just eat the food on its own and drink the broth...like soup. 

Will definitely come back for more!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,3,4,75secDcvV2r8RLiCV7riSw

What I like here is that they have a self serve hot pot! $4.99 for veggies and $9.99 for the meats which I think is very reasonable. They ask for your spice level 1-5 and it's pretty spicy too! 

I ordered: 

Yunnan traditional noodle: it was okay. But honestly I think Yunnan gardens a lot better and less oily. But the portion was good sized and the noodles were cooked al dente. It needed more pickled cabbage in there and be a lot more spicy! 

Hotpot: We put a little of everything in there. It was very oily though but tasty. I didn't like there was so many while black peppers everywhere so it got in the way of eating.

I was craving for some comfort food after a couple days of eating burgers and sandwiches. Found this on Yelp and after reading the reviews and looking through the pictures, my mouth started watering. 

You can't order through UberEats, but Postmates is available with 10% service fee + delivery fee. There was no menu on Postmates for this place, however, the worker was super nice and sent me the menu pictures (12 of them!) through IM and had me order on the phone. The MaoCai was difficult to order on the phone, but we somehow managed to order. The whole process didn't take more than half an hour, and the food was boiling hot when they arrived.

The Maocai we ordered was non spicy, but still, it was great other than that the beef was a bit too tough and dry. 

The fish soup was perfectly flavored with spiciness and ZiChuan pepper corns. The fish fillet is tender and seasoned well.

The Wonton was fresh tasting and comfy. The soup was a bit too salty for me, but that's okay.

The shredded potato was average. I have had better ones, however this is not bad at all.

All in all, I was very impressed with the service and I really appreciate whoever took our order and her patience. The food was not superb, however, it deserves a five star for being in Vegas.

So we did the make your own hot pot. We got their noodle, veggies, beef, fish balls and more stuff. They have a great variety so i think people will like it here. 
The spice level on there grows pretty quick, so you if you get a 3, be prepared. I was going to get a 4 but lowered it for my friend but turns out 3 was just right. And Id say i eat really  spicy in Asian terms lol 
The pot itself is really big so be prepared to ear it with a lot of people. Although my friend and I were able to finish one pot but that's because we eat a lot lol 
I thought it was a bit pricey though because our bill came out to $50 for just the pot itself. The meat so like fish, beef lamb, meat balls weight a lot because it was frozen I would say. They had ice on them.

My Chinese friends took me here and I didn't even look at the menu. Everything they ordered was ah-mazing. Seriously, we killed everything on the table.

I love PEA SHOOTS and they have that here. It's just stir-fried with garlic and soy sauce. One of my all time favorite dishes. 

I love DAN DAN Noodles and I think this is hands-down, the best place in Las Vegas that serves Dan Dan Noodles. I've tried this dish in New York and this is waaaay better! I don't each much carbs but F it, I can't resist this dish!

We also ordered a sour and spicy WHITE FISH SOUP that hit the spot. 

MAPO TOFU also on point! OMG, there was also this PORK DISH that I dream about. It was thinly sliced pork belly drenched in a salty sweet spicey sauce over lightly blanched bean sprouts. It's that sauce. I seriously saved it and have some in my fridge right now. 

Be prepared for SPICEY food! So good I had to come back after a week. 

We didn't try the HOT POT and just ordered from the menu so not sure about that experience.

The plain noodle was surprisingly good especially you wanted something simple after several days of heavy buffets.

I also wish there could be more options to choose from.

Two complains:
1. The restroom was very very dark!
2. The malatang was $10 minimum, and I got less than $10 but they should have reminded me or asked me whether I would like to choose more food to make it over $10.",00LBYmpWnIz3s3-lQeEXmg,0,1,4,UbYUwcD-gQ3H2TSknDmtKQ

There are lots to choose from. For a less adventurous eater, they have spinach, lettuce, mushroom, fish ball, shrimp, lamb, beef, squid etc. A bit more exotic, they have tripe, lotus roots, bean curd sheets, pig's blood, pig's intestines, taro etc.

You go to the hotpot bar up front and grab the larger bowl on the right for all your veggies (~$7/lb if I remember correctly) like Napa cabbage, spinach, various mushrooms, tomatoes, Noodles, and my favorite bean curd sheets. Meats go in the smaller bowl (11.99/lb) and include options such as fish balls, fish filets, lamb or beef briskets, shrimp, and sausages.
Put the bowls on the scale and choose a spice level of 1-5. They will bring your selected food back cooked in a flavorful, gingery and garlicky broth with a TON of chili oil. I mean a LOT of oil. I've read that the oil helps to keep the broth hot, but have also heard that they add oil just for the spice. I have tried ordering a spice level 1 so that it's not super spicy, and it always ends up very oil filled. Still delicious.

Facility: located in the middle of the strip mall, it's a pretty small place. There were only tables and chairs, and they sit you pretty close to your neighbors, so don't be shy. No special decor...just a kinda divey diner feel. 

Service: This is the only reason I'm rating this less than a 5 stars. They were super nice when you first walk in, but they have not discovered the art of checking back on you.  We had to wave them down several times. 

Food: The food was great!!!
We got the appetizer of Spicy Oil Wontons 5/5. They were very good, and the spice level was great. I asked what level they consider the spicy on the wontons, and they said a 3 outta 5.
This is what I used to base my level of spiciness for the hot pot soup. We ordered it at a 4, since the wontons were supposedly a 3. This worked out well, as I think the 5 might have been too much. Even the staff tried to talk us out of a 4, but I'm glad I didn't listen, because it was perfect. 
We ordered the ""make your own hot pot soup bar"" 5/5. I loved this!!!!  It's so fun that you pick the exact veggies and meat to put in your bowl. We just shared an order and there was enough soup for 4 people!! 

Overall:  Really enjoyed this place. The service is struggling a tad, but if you want good, spicy, authentic, fun food this is your spot. I'll be back!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,3,4,OTPQztbrGe3X1rVgsGqcKA

At lunch time we were presented with a paper menu consisting of 21 options.  I selected the #1 Yunnan house special casserole rice noodle $9.99 since many of the items were marked with red spicy peppers indicating the heat level of the dish.

Turns out the four-some beside me had ordered off menu, which resulted in their being presented with this rather large basin filled with a hodgepodge of meats and veggies bathing in a spicy red broth.  Another neighboring table had their own similarly sized dish minus the red tinging of their broth.

I looked longingly in that direction, but when my casserole finally arrived, it made for a little show of its own, as each ingredient arrived separately plated on a tray, but were then quickly (too quickly for me to take a photo - sad face) dumped into the ceramic eared dish, resulting in all the good stuff hiding beneath the noodles.  Not the most pretty or flavorful of dishes, but more than enough for my appetite, and served quite hot.

I haven't tried too many of their dishes. But the self-serve hot pot by the pound is so worth it. You only pick what you want to eat and they charge you by the pounds. The meat is $9.99/pound and the non-meat is $4.99/pound. After I put so many things I like in my two bowls, it came to less than $15 for both meat and vegetable. And I love the fact that they don't count the bowl to the weight, which means you pay exactly what you get. 

The first time I went there I picked the medium spicy broth, and it was perfect for me. I eat spicy for life, so for those that don't eat spicy food regularly, you might need to choose the lesser spicy option. The flavor of the broth reminds me to the spicy broth at Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot. 

The second time I went, I chose the same medium spicy. But it came out a little too spicy for me. So I ordered another set of vegetables with no spicy broth to mixed them with the spicy one to balanced the spicy level. I thought the non-spicy one was going to be plain and no flavor. To my surprise, the non-spicy broth was actually pretty tasty. I didn't even need to mix it together. I kind of like having both options.

My advise to you all first-timers. Get one bowl of the meat with the spicy broth and get another bowl with non-spicy broth for the vegetables. Those two with a bowl of rice will be enough to feed 2-4 people. 

You will notice that the broth is very oily and has a lot of herbs that might not be pleasant when you accidentally eat it. But that's normal. That's just how the traditional food is made. The oil is important to keep the broth hot without stove. The legend says that long time ago, there was a lady from Yunnan that had to bring food to her husband that worked far away from home. But every time she arrived to her husband work place, the food has became cold due to the cold weather in Yunnan. That's how she figured a way to keep the broth hot without reheating it which is by adding a lot of oil to the broth. 

So if you don't like something too oily and spicy. Then this place might not be the right place for you. Which is okay, that means more room for me to sit. :)

I have a feeling I am going to go this place every week. Especially during winter time.

Food - 5/5
Price - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Cleanliness - 5/5

One of the few ""Yun nan"" noodle places in town. Not to be confused with Yun Nan Garden behind Chinatown. The ""Mi Xian"" noodles is traditional and delicious similar to those of Yunnan Garden over behind Chinatown.  I been to this restaurant roughly 7-8 since it has open with multiple groups of friends. It's a great location for lunch or dinner because of quick service and affordable price food. 

-------------------------------------------Food - 5/5---------------------------------------------------
Yun Nan style food, so manly spicy noodles or spicy ""hot pot"" bowls. I highly recommend you selecting 0 spice level if you do not like spicy food since level 1 spice level has a minor kick to it. 

Dan Dan Mien
Have order this item 3 out of the 10 visits. The noodles are served without soup with peanuts, minced meat and a peanut butter / soy like sauce. It is not like the tradition Sichuan Dan Dan Mien which is served in chili oil but it is similar to the Taiwanese / American style of  Ma jiang mien, which is less soupy than the Sichuan counter part.

Spicy chicken Mi Xian 
Have order this item 2 out of the 10 visits. This is the traditional style Yunnan Mi Xian (noodles) served with spicy chicken and soup. The soup base uses a lot of chili oil so if you do not like spicy food, I suggest you asking for a lower spice level.

Beef Noodle Soup
Order this 1 out of the 10 times. Not to be confused with the Taiwanese style beef noodle soup that people are more familiar with, this is Yunnan style using more of a chili oil beef noodle soup base, rather than the Taiwanese style which the consistency of the soup is thicker. This is more oily and spicier.

Mince Meat Mi Xian
Forgot the exact name of this on the menu but order it 1 out of the 10 times. This is similar to the ""Chuan Rou Mi Xian"" where it is clear soup with minced meat / pickle radish served in soup with mi xian noodles. This one is no spicy level so great for those that don't want something very spicy but still traditional and yummy.

Self Serve Hot Pot
Had this 4 out of 10 times at various spice levels. This charges by the pound, $4.99 for non meat related items (veggies, tofu, seaweed, ""telephones"", udon etc) and $9.99 for meat related products (Beef, lamb, fish, tripe etc...)  This is self pick, so you can pick the items you want in a buffet style, bring it to them for weighing and they will cook it for you in a bowl of spicy to non spicy soup. The weight of the bowls you place them in are already subtracted off of the scale so you are being charged only for the food that you placed in the bowl.  The spicy level ranges from 0-5, 5 being extremely spicy and 0 being no spice. A few of my friends that eat very spicy say that level 5 is very enjoyable but you can see them sweating the whole time eating it. If you are looking to challenge yourself, try out level 5 spice but otherwise I would recommend a level 2 spice because it still has a kick. 

----------------------------------------------Prices - 5/5--------------------------------------------------
$4.99 / pound  - non meat products for self serve hot pot
$9.99 / pound - meat products for self serve hot point

Majority of the time, I end up spending roughly $6-$8 on the Hotpot items and it is quite filling. I normally just add $1 of rice and it is more than enough food. 

The other noodles range around $6.99-$8.99 which is quite affordable for lunch / dinner and the portions are big and filling.  

----------------------------------------------Service 4/5-------------------------------------------------
The service was expected from a traditional Chinese place. The servers are quite nice but there have been visits where the servers were not paying attention to the customers. From the recent visit 2/27/2015, the training of the staff have improved and they are being being more attentive to the customers. 

--------------------------------------------Cleanliness - 5/5---------------------------------------------
The restaurant has been open for about a month now and it is still clean. Many issues with Chinatown restaurants is the poor training and ""dirty dining"" violations that we hear so much about. This restaurant maintains a clean atmosphere front of house. They might have issues with the food storage of the buffet, but I'm never there long enough to see how long they keep food out or the frequency of changing the product. 

Overall
Good food, good price, fast and decent service. Very good location for lunch or dinner and very good for groups of all sizes.",sCb9265DeUJLDIcvs03Owg,7,1,5,ZpVvHYUq53wKfMQHJVExLw

This has become my new favorite Asian place. I only order the ""pick your own"" hot pot thing they have. Pretty much, you have a self-serve bar of hot pot fixens. $4.99 and $9.99 for vegetables and meets. There are tons to choose from. For a less adventurous eater, we have lettuce, mushroom, fish, shrimp, lamb, fish balls, beef, etc. A bit more Asian, we have tripe, spam, bamboo shoots, etc. And for my wife, they have pig's blood, intestines, and all those authentic goodies.

When everything is selected, you give them the bowls to weigh and pick a spice level (1 to 5). 1, though it is the lowest, is almost too spicy for me so beware if it's your first time. After about 5 minutes or so, they bring you our your creating in a giant bowl. The broth is a bit oily, I admit, but it's packed with flavor. Perhaps it's something in the way they prepare it, but there are much more spices which adds to much more flavor than you'd get from a ""cook it yourself"" hot pot place.

I always go here whenever I'm craving something spicy. As soon as I enter, I'm always seated immediately and hot tea is brought out. If you want water, you'll have to ask and they'll bring you a little pitcher from the fridge. 

I usually go for the hot pot bar area (at the back) where you choose what you want and they cook it in a spicy soup for you, which ranges from 1-5. I can't handle spice that well so I get a 1 and that shit still makes my nosy runny (so ask for extra napkins). 
You pick out what you want in the large silver bowls (meat goes into a seperate smaller bowl) and give it to the servers where they weigh it for you and they'll take it back in the kitchen. The food comes out pretty quickly. 
They charge by weight, so the meat and vegetables are charged at different prices. 

I've only ordered a few items from their actual menu and they were all a bit salty - so I would be aware of that. 

The decor in there is very simple with the typical Asian stuff, Buddha statues, money trees, and bamboos. The servers there all wear the ""Crab Childe"" shirt with black pants and whatever shoes they want. 

The service is pretty good, nothing to complain about. If you want to take your food home, the servers even pack it up for you so you don't have to. 

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys spicy food, especially hot pot - even though it's 100+ degrees outside.",IPGCGImT5tsLWWpLbvmLZQ,2,1,5,ClL5LqbkyY0RSEfM2C4uMw

This time, we felt much better than the first time is not about their foods.. Don't thing it wrong. Their foods are great. It is about the SERVICE. The first time was Halloween night, there were two girls as the cashier who supposed make people feeling welcome and happy, but with their Black Face ( Chinese way called those Bitches Face), my husband and I was feeling that we might owe that two girls some money or we are not welcome to eat in their restaurant..... I mean, if you knew how to said ""six"", can you learn how to say PLEASE too? Also, if you feel tired at work because of the holiday, let your boss know you need to rest a little bit but don't let your customers see or feel it, please! This time we came in around 4pm, luckily that two black faces girls are not at work yet. A tall boy served us with at least a little bit of smile on his face. We payed 25% tips to him. Not a lot but hopefully he gets all. I wanna say one more thing. You might see they weight your food with the bowl but the scales already took out the weight of the bowl. The bills for two times were almost the same for $25 for both of us. It is cheap already. Thank you for the spicy foods. We both loves it.",Ig0eagA0Fsf0pg6t9nkXcw,0,0,5,kAoScy0vEXdUC8YpuHXUQg

I don't know if I'll ever get sick of this place. I always overorder because I always take my leftovers home to have for my next meal :0D.

There's stuff like tofu, taro, bean curd, tripe, intestine looking shiz (haha), veggies, and lots of other stuff that I really don't even know the names for :b. Most of the stuff I've grown up eating so it's been awhile since I had them after relocating to Vegas.

Always down for this place :D. And yes, they speak Chinese.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,3,5,SAk_L7rgZIbpjEsumE7GhQ

5809414,2016-05-16,1,3pGA9YGsDLRQ7HJLw5cwcQ,"I would give this place a one star, but I didn't die from the food or get food poisoning. I would not go back to this restaurant. The food is a one, and the service is a two. I am very familiar with authentic Yunnan cuisine, and I can tell you I was certainly not impressed. The food was super salty and lacking flavoring from spices and chili. Something I love about Yunnan food is the spices, the chili, and the peppercorns. We ordered the spicy wontons, twice cooked pork, and the mapo tofu. Everything was unimpressive and not very memorable. I would say ever other Yunnan restaurant I've been to is better than this place, and I've tried them all! The spicy wontons had almost no meat. I was looking for it. I didn't find it. It was like wonton skins in chili oil. The twice cooked pork tasted like bacon! It was extremely salty and the cuts of meat were extremely thin. The mapo tofu...probably the worst mapo tofu I've had in my life. I had 2 bites, and didn't want to eat anymore. Ughhh...so disappointing. To my surprise, the chef is actually Chinese. I thought they had some random person who knows nothing of Yunnan cuisine cooking in the back. By far my least favorite restaurant on Spring Mountain.",ScwVhHmUFLZwVW9E5fvKjw,1,0,2,L_bzTKw1ePiwMRK5-CWQYw

The spicy wontons - 2 stars. The skin was overcooked and soggy, and barely held the inside meat in place. 

Spicy boiled beef - 3 stars. Great flavor. 
Fish soup- 3 stars.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,3,etEDdHve_oAxhVB29weZCQ
