The ""dinner"" was terrible steam-table Chinese crap, really nothing good.  The drinks averaged about $10-12 each and they won't give you ice water to go with them, you have to pay for tiny bottles of water.  We were told that we couldn't get food until we ordered drinks, and they were not kidding. I think they want you to be drunk so you don't notice how bad the food it. We were at the early show and had just been in the sun so we were not feeling like drinking much, but we did order.  When the waitress realized we were not big drinkers, she became a royal bitch.  The ""hostess"" of the show was like a vulgar truck-driver dressed up in drag for Halloween.  I am not at all a prude, but some of the things s/he said and did were more disgusting than funny. A couple of the performers were good, one who did a fab Cher and Dancing Desiree was the best! They are the reason for the one star.
We got our tickets on Goldstar and paid $25 each with fees. The tickets at the door were $75, but you would have to be pretty stupid to pay that. They really push you to tip all the performers, most who come out twice, plus they force drinks at you and then write on your bill what your tip should be, which is terribly condescending.  I have been a waitress and know for a fact that if you offer good service and make sure people know what the original price was, that they can do math and will tip well.  Even with the discount tickets, only one alcoholic drink each and eating almost nothing, we still ended up spending close to $60 each to waste 2+ hours of our vacation.  The next night we had a great dinner on the patio of the French restaurant in Paris, across from the Bellagio fountain show. We spend less and had a much better time! I really thought Vegas would do this better. This show is just a drag, and not in the way it was intended.",GLoh819g05UtmjxT3IIMcQ,0,0,1,0PzZ9yKhbU48vFojZLNqDg

Don't expect great food at all, but the entire atmosphere is fun and lively. I made reservations on Open Table for 6:30 pm because they were offering 1000 bonus points for early dining. 

The 3 course prix fixe meal is $40 not including tax and gratuity. Bonus: buy a gift certificate on Restaurant.com worth $25 and you pay only $10 for it.",3xhIAIzNPhFAp24U3oCB1Q,3,2,3,q9vUr89v34keeFBAerMZSA
839107,2006-07-06,1,bYw7mT1e3frkxG0nd2_mjg,"Wow. This is the most amazing bar/restaurant/drag queen joint I have ever seen in my life.

Girly weekend in Vegas, and my pal and I decided to ramble over and have a chinese dinner served up by large men with intense makeup. Made reservations for 9.30, called ahead for directions, and showed up on time. When we arrived, the place was empty but for one lone Irish drag queen crooning on the kareoke and a lonely family unhappily finishing their meal. Sigh. We stayed and ended up, the three of us, (liz, candice, and drag queen fantastic) singing our hearts out for an hour or so to the smooth hits of Bono and Steve Perry...I didn't stop believing all night. Got a lot of facts on post op transsexual life, and even saw some boobs! (and they weren't my own mind you) SO worth the stop if you are in vegas.",1iB92-jDIpgQH1H66OVE_A,0,1,5,dRlq4ye9E0xypsOCV3R6GQ

To mtop it off the drinks were over priced and the performance was crappy.  All they did was sing two words on stage and then walk around the audience looking for hand-outs.  I would never do it again, the drag shows in Chicago are way way better!!! This place lacked style!!!",uNXWzez7yRyrw3ie4cuB3g,2,1,1,9wdN7mJFmYeDNFNWJ2-u0g
2054458,2007-07-08,0,bYw7mT1e3frkxG0nd2_mjg,"My girlfriends know that for my birthday I always want to do something different than dinner and a nightclub like a lot of my other friends dinners. So, this year we rounded up like fifteen of us and headed down to the northern most end of the strip, and had the middle table of a drag show with dinner. 
We had so much fun. I'm not much for campy, but this was great. Was the food good here, no not really, but we had fantastic waitresses that were fab and entertaining and my boyfriend even did things that to this day he knows I have severe blackmail pictures from . 
it was a really great alternative to the same old thing we always do. The prix fix menu was simple, and maybe not the best, but I recommend for a good time",ko06Ptkr1YtZWR6FIDqubA,1,0,4,KF43El0LKCWBXR6ZLpnRGQ
2383396,2008-12-21,1,bYw7mT1e3frkxG0nd2_mjg,"Dude. I've been to Lucky Cheng's in NYC several times, so when my friend decided that she wanted to see her first ever drag show (and we were in Vegas), I thought it was a great idea to bring her here!

There was a 2-fer special, which we paid for in advance on their website (this is important information for later in the story). So, my friend and I as a last huzzah got all dressed up and arrived. And we wondered if we were in the right place.

Granted it was a Wednesday night, but this is Vegas right? Party all the time? I guess not because there was barely anyone here. It was me and my friend, a scared looking couple, and a rowdy bunch of accountants. That's it. 

We came in and got some drinks (not cheap people) and waited for our meal. And waited. And waited. After literally 1 1/2 hours, we got our food. I am not sure what they were doing because it wasn't a packed house. Maybe they were making everything from scratch? Not so much because the food wasn't memorable.

The show was rowdier than in NYC, and the ""ladies"" were very nice, but the service was haphazard at best. 

The kicker of the night, was when we were leaving. All of a sudden we hear a squeaky voice yelling ""Excuse me! Excuse me!"" and a teetering queen chasing us down the parking lot. Here we thought we forgot something, instead she's like ""I think you made a mistake with the check - there's only $12 here."" We were like, no we prepaid - that's your tip. And come to think of it, it was a generous one at that. 

So my experience at Lucky Cheng's Las Vegas was sub-par at best. I don't recommend this place - if you're looking for a show, there are better on the strip.",Vkk8YfesfF2aAehFb5SlSA,8,2,1,u7XIcdLcWLTniCWlHv3RMA

She just had a boob job and was very interested in us ""testing them out""! LOL Everyone was super fun and the food was good too! I was MORE than entertained! I went to NYC and found a Lucky Cheng's there...I was hoping for the same awesomeness from Vegas - I didn't get it. Sorry NYC, you were lame compared to Vegas.",l-_UJNp1m5ht93rOy7aYlw,0,0,5,mCQ60AHX6vYOJRc95911Zg
5290019,2007-02-02,2,bYw7mT1e3frkxG0nd2_mjg,"I wanted to be all about this place, but, it fell a bit short for me.  I've been to the Lucky Cheng's in New York, and I've been to Lips in NYC also. (Lips is the same theme Drag Waiters.)  The drag dining event can be really charming and fun.  But there's a huge difference between drag in NY and drag in LV.  It seems that here in Vegas it's not so much drag as it is transvestism and pre-ops with boobs.  I guess real boobs on a ""drag queen"" is a little too real for me.  God I sound like a wuss, but it really seemed more like a bordello than a fun jaunty trip to a drag show.

The show was fun.  I don't remember her name, but this awesome queen with a huge Afro danced her way into my heart.  She looked like she jumped right out of an R. Crumb comic......bodacious to say the least.  She was dragtastic.

As for the food.  It was okay.  Nothing to run back for, but prepared well.  So, yeah, a bit underwhelmed by the whole experience.  Now, word on the street is that Lucky Cheng's is moving to the Krave Lounge, which might give it a whole new feel.  When it moves, I'll go again and see if my mind is shifted a little, but until then, i kinda  feel like drag is dead.",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,1,1,4,hAT-7wFcwloTrQm2m04ujg
5838459,2008-04-30,0,bYw7mT1e3frkxG0nd2_mjg,"my gf wanted to go for part of her bachelorette weekend festivities.  i said 'sure! beats going to a male strip club'

we got discounted tix off goldstar ($20 + $5 service charge each) for the chinese buffet and show.  any drinks (a 4 oz bottle of water for $4.75!! - just order alcohol and suck the ice cubes) were additional.

show was entertaining (drag show at angle's in okc and  asia sf in sf are free less whatever cover they charge)  they encourage audience participation and like to rib the audience consisting mainly of bachelorette parties (what is is it with bachelorettes and drag queens?)

food was serve-yourself-buffet-style a la panda express

gets 4 stars bcs we got discounted show tix.  would've been 3 if not bcs of price and the fact the cocktail waitress wanted to get tipped based on the price of the show tix including drinks.  i'm all about tipping your servers but 20% on drinks + 10% tip on buffet price is pretty generous for getting your dishes bussed plus we tipped all the performers that came to our table!

Saw the prettiest go go gals. 
Both bartenders and customers are nice.
Sad to say gals are much nicer than the ones in LA LA land. =| 
Had a few nice conversation with the gals. Too bad none were from LA. 
Drinks are strong and slightly cheaper than WEHO.

Too bad they charge cover. 

Parking-- self parking is so damn far away and the valet is almost always full. 
But a ""Jackson"" would always get you a spot on the strip.",8OdNA17IEmZca7sNvyh0Gw,2,0,4,GpjA89kadA0XfKz2o1y20Q
