CONS- 
I went for a cowboy game and told the waitress (who was very drunk) that my wife is pregnant and I don't drink so we just wanted a menu and a few soft drinks.  The waitress brought our drinks but not a menu.  After i went and asked the bartender for a menu, I came back to my seat and the waitress told me that i had to order from the cowboy game menu (perhaps the bartender should have known to give me the right menu)  The waitress brought the right menu but then disappeared and I had to go hunt her down after the first quarter of the game had already passed.  She told me she was going to  come back to my table so that she would be able to get the order right and bring it to the right table.  She still managed to get the order wrong by not bringing my wife's french fries.  We told her about it and she said she had forgotten to put it in but based on our bill, i'm almost positive that she charged us for the fries.  On top of that, she charged us separately for each soda, one of which, I didn't even ask for.  The place is a bar/grill that serves food but allows people to smoke despite state law prohibiting that.  In all, we were largely ignored, the service we got was very poor, and we will not return.",lgHvtvggg0qnEngb_iEvuA,0,0,2,rJyUEs9yjFZytlEhONDosQ

2353808,2011-11-20,1,WzkbnhI-fxdH_tMzT3evtA,"Stumbled on Mr. Ds 'Sports bar' on a trip to Vegas over Labor Day weekend 2011. My original destination (Vamp'd) was closed and this was just down the road - and open - for a road weary traveler just off the plane from Philly. Upon entrance, three things hit me in the face - DDs (ha), smoke and darkness. I was suddenly back in 1995 at the corner tavern in NJ. Anyway, it was somehow refreshing (except the smoke) cause it was such an old school place with gaming machines, throw back furniture, etc. Yes, the waitresses are trashy chicks with pornstar boobs. It didn't bother me. Imagine that. Anything goes in this sorta place. They have a biker event (fortunately not that day) and I can imagine if the walls could talk they wouldn't shut up. Next to the big screen was a pool table occupied by middle aged guys drinking pitchers of beer and swearing up a storm. This was like 3pm in the afternoon. 

The menu read - Mr. D's famous for classic clubs. I love clubs and was so hungry I wanted something as soon as possible. The club was outstanding, piled high on a big platter. The service was a little slow but that was because the main bar area is reserved for gaming/drinking, you cannot occupy a seat without playing a machine. Since they want you sitting there forever, the service is going to be better in the main bar. All in all, I left full and satisfied. I actually ran into two ladies from NJ who had just sit down as I was leaving, both had relocated for sunny weather and happier times. Prices were a bit higher than I expected but justified with the amount of food I was given. Not sure I'd want to hang out to watch NFL football at Mr. D's, not much of a 'sports bar' IMO.",2lqkA5fK2STpx_kKAapMQw,0,1,4,5XOSDtKa0ru8E98Vpf2Tgg

When the waitress came back we asked if we could return them and exchange them for some beers instead.

She walked away and came back and said we could not return the Bloody Mary's and had to pay for them. Even after she took a sip out of it!! Wow! On top of that we were forced to buy an additional item because there is a $10 minimum for credit card purchases! Insane! We paid and walked out.  Never again. I guess they do just cater to a certain kind of clientele and it seems that's all they want. Looking back we would have just walked out but she had my buddy's card so it felt like we were forced to pay. What place makes you pay for something you don't like? Especially since we both only took a small sip and the waitress took a sip out if my drink to taste it!!! Wow! This place is really a dump.

My wife and I have been to Mr D's many times for Hot Rod night on Tuesdays and to listen to great bands on live nights. We love the 1.00 tacos and great deals on beers on classic car Tuesday. The chicken wings and burgers are always top notch.
The place is usually very busy with a mix of people that reminds me of the bar scene in Star wars! You will see every type of person you can imagine here. The age mix is from 21 to 80 probably most in their late 30s to late 50s. I have never see a place with such a mix of people always talking and getting along very well. The bartenders are top notch and I have seen them handle tons of credit cards without any confusion at all.
Bike night is Wed and Car night is Tues; Thru is Steak night. Always very crowded.
The owner Dennis is the Hardest working owner of any bar in the country as far as I am concerned. Dennis always has time for a chat with repeat customers. He really cares about his product and you can tell by the spotless restrooms and very clean bar. You will be able to identify Dennis he is the guy busting his ass either out front guiding classis cars into parking spots on Classic Car night or  helping behind the bar when the place is busy. Best Bar in Las Vegas about 4 miles from the Strip.
Try is sometime.

But seriously, always a good time here. Could be called dive-y, it's dark wood walls and older decor remind me of decades gone by, but it's got some class. 

Expect a wide variety of people here, plenty of bikers, business men, young, old, etc. I've seen Elvis, DeNiro and Willy Nelson impersonators here, it's attracts them all. 
There's car night on Tues, bike night on Wed with your requisite wet t-shirt contest @ 10 pm (I did say dive-y) karaoke Thurs & Sun and live music - mostly classic rock, southern rock - on Friday night and this place pretty much covers it all - and sometimes uncovers it all, depending on the crowd.

Beer buckets $12, drink and food specials going all the time, mostly up until 9, although they've been known to put up free hot dogs and burgers for the post midnight crowd. There's a small pool table, and I do mean small, tucked into the corner. The kind where you have to warn the people sitting nearby to watch your cue stick as you try to bank one off the side or risk losing an eye.

They seem to change their karaoke dj's out often but they're always pretty good. Waitresses are all cool, even when the place is busy, you don't have to wait long for your refill.

As far as the cleanliness, this place is immaculate. Tables and chairs and floors are always spotless. And I've never seen cleaner bathrooms in a ""dive"" bar before. It really puts all other bathrooms to shame. Can't speak for the men's room though. 

Bartenders are quick, attentive, and not bad to look at! Plenty of seating in the bar and outside. You'll never be left look for a place to set your drink down. Always lots of events going on here: car shows, bike nights, live music, football, and last night the whole bar even watched Sons of Anarchy together. 

I adore this bar. It attracts people of all kinds and ages and everyone always has a really good time. Great place to go on any night of the week.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,6,1,5,dKJpqvCh3pKkzB5JpXNACQ

This has become my go-to spot for Karaoke on Thursday nights! They have excellent drink prices, and service is always fast and friendly. The only small complaint that I have is that the bartenders do not let you review your tab prior to paying out. On one occasion, thankfully I was paying attention because there were a few extra drinks on my tab, and I only noticed because I knew what the prices of their drinks were. It would be a benefit for the customer to be able to review their bill prior to the card being charged. The bartender had no problem fixing the mistake and made it right, but this would avoid issues in the future.",2h-oRg-T0dkRuPWd15EXXA,0,0,5,_xdMeON3B14x0Vyj0ahwrw

4943940,2012-12-14,1,WzkbnhI-fxdH_tMzT3evtA,"I came here with a MEET-UP GROUP for the steak night on Thursdays. I am a picky steak guy. I wet-age my own steak and know good steak. I can tell the difference between select, choice and prime steaks and I know how to cook steaks. ANYWAYS.... the steak I ordered, medium rare was AWESOME!!!!!!! I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE QUALITY AND FLAVOR AND TENDERNESS FOR THE PRICE!!!!! The quality was something out of a steak house on the STRIP . I am not joking....... it blew me away. The steak was huge...... maybe 14 oz. plus. even the gristle on the meat tasted good! It took about 30 minutes to get it but was worth the wait. I put a little salt and pepper on the steak.... that was it. I believe the meat was Select that had been  wet-aged by a meat supplier here in town and then well marinated at Mr. D's.;  it was FULL OF FLAVOR and fairly tender and cut well. I had a nice tall 20oz? Sam Adams  draft beer with my steak and the baked potatoe was great:. nice and cooked perfect and just the right size... it came with margarine and sour cream. The meal included sweet kernel corn that was good. They charged me $1 more for useing my American Express card. Including a $2 tip, my meal and big , nice big draft beer was $20.00. I noticed a lot of people eating the steak........I don't blame them....... I'll be back! I question why I would want to go to my favorite butcher, pay $14.40 for one steak and then have to cook it myself, when this place exists.
      02/07/2013........ Once again a great steak dinner: steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare. I think next time I'll order it ""medium"". ADVICE: try the steak for flavor before you instinctively add salt and pepper to it. They season it perfectly out back on the grill with Montreal Steak seasoning. The baked potatoe was a nice size and the sweet-kernel corn was tasty. Add a 20oz. Sam Adams to the steak and i was a very happy person............

They have a big attractive sign out front so it seemed pretty popular. We were surprised that the place was kinda dead given the fact that one of the biggest NFL games of the year was on TV. So we had a seat at the bar and had a couple beers. The bartender was really nice and quick to take our order. The beer was nice and cold and they have several TVs showing the game so there's no visibility problems. It's really smoky inside the bar but that's typical of bars in Vegas. We saw some food coming out of the kitchen that looked good but we weren't hungry. Overall a decent experience.,XQOWYd0VM9gDEepzzcRNEg,0,0,3,vyDJzhTwJRMMDn96NYoM0g

The bar is a dive, but its great!  (I love dive bars. I really do!)

They have decent prices on drinks (a bucket of domestics for something like $12.50), and the place is pretty big.

The bartenders were super friendly, and very quick, even with a packed bar.

Their chicken fingers are tasty too!

Karaoke was fun, but as seems to be the trend with bars lately, this is yet ANOTHER bar that doesn't want the volume too loud.    

Karaoke is available here Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  If the owner/manager will let up on the volume regulations, I'll come back...but like I mentioned in another karaoke post...if I wanted to sing to quiet music, I'll sing in my car.

When it is cold out the owner has heaters on patio and a fire place outside, when its warm he has swamp coolers on the patio and misters.
