I went with 2 friends-- all interested in finding a good steak that Vegas supposedly has in abundance down the strip.

We went to Paris, seeking a classy and aesthetically pleasing casino & resort. Paris did not disappoint, it was tackily beautiful.

I'll cut to the chase-- The steaks were way too overcooked: steak at a fine dining establishment should never-ever be gray. The waiter's rationale for the gray and leathery appearance of the steak was that I was cutting into the edge of the steak and I needed to judge the quality by cutting into the center. Let me get this straight.. I ordered a 22 oz ribeye to eat 6 oz in the middle?? rrrrrrr.

The wine was good and the scene was peaceful, but I was more disappointed than I've been in a while when dining out.",uLwqimbwHfyzCFqJfGtImA,1,1,1,ZGMkRQ9gm1OUUbbBSHKapg

Then I noticed some customers were ""dressed up,"" while some others were in jeans.

Les Artistes has soft lighting and an artsy ambience, with a series of Impressionist paintings hanging throughout the restaurant.  The service was exceptional, our waiter was friendly and attentive, and was helpful with the wine recommendations.  We had the Filet Mignon and Kobe ""Wagyu"" Steak Frites, along with salads.  The salad was good (and a decent size portion). However, my filet was overcooked, I asked for medium and it tasted almost well done. The Kobe Steak Frites looked really good and it's something I'd order next time.

I'm beginning to believe that the buffets have better steak than the glam steakhouses on the Strip.

Food:
Wine:  We asked for a '04 Chateauneuf Du Pape, and the waiter brought an '06.  When I informed the waiter that it's an '06, he tried to convince me that an '06 is just as good as the '04.  Uhm, nooooo buddy.

Fresh Oysters:  *sigh*  They only had one kind...and not Kumamoto.  As I slurped up my couple of oysters, I was yearning for Sea Salt, for Hog Island, for Inverness.

Foie Gras, served on top of fuji apples and toast:  The foie gras was simply ""foie gras"", of the fatty and juicy variety, which is just fine by me.

8 oz Tenderloin, Oscar Style:  Granted, I've never had my steak Oscar style (a lump of crab and asparagus on top).  I requested to have my steak cooked according to the chef's recommendation, and it was perfectly medium rare.  I probably won't order a steak Oscar style again, but that doesn't mean that the chef's execution was poor.  Quite the contrary.

Service:
We started on a bad foot with the wine episode (see above).  After that, he did his best to make amends.

Overall:
Les Artistes probably wouldn't be my first choice restaurant.  The food is decent, but incredibly overpriced - but then again, it's Vegas.",0f8T72An8ItaYLV7RLVP5A,1,1,2,oh4LyZyREHj14OsmaWNPBA

There were three of us that had dinner there around 7pm and it was not too busy. At first I did not expect it to be so classy but once inside, it was a wonderful, colorful atmosphere. I did not hear the casino machines and it was was a welcome reprieve. 

With the coupon we were not able to have any crustaceans, but we ate steak and let me tell you... the porterhouse steak was like butter.  I got the small cut but even that was too big to eat it all.  In a city where everywhere you go there is steak on sale for $5.99, this steak was well beyond the flavor meter.  It was cooked to perfection and the side dishes were fantastic.  I had the sauteed spinach with garlic - HELLO garlic!!!  Great taste and they had an excellent wine selection to choose from.  

I will be back to this restaurant when I go back to Vegas.  This is an absolute must.

Our waiter came by 2x, once to take the order, and at the end to drop off the bill (a true Shemp).

My wife and I frequently dine at upscale steak houses, and were staying in Paris, so we thought why not try the steak house in the hotel. We saw many of the reviews on Yelp, most of which were favorable.  But having just experienced it, I must say I wouldn't go back even if the meal was free.

The room itself is very attractive..... nice and artsy, not like many of the traditional, classic rooms.  But it was very pleasant.  We had a relatively early reservation....7:30, and walked into a mostly empty restaurant.  So where do they seat us?  Right next to bussing station.   Not a great start, but we didn't say anything.  The server was good as were the first items we tried.  The bread basket, escargots and Caesar salad were all good.   But the steak is another story.  My wife ordered the angus NY Steak and I ordered the bone-in NY.  Hers was slightly overcooked and just terrible.  It wasn't just that it had no flavor; it actually tasted bad.  My bone-in NY that was ordered medium rare, arrived somewhere between medium and medium-well.  Jon, our server agreed wholeheartedly and about 10 minutes later returned with another.  This time it was close to raw......far from rare, which I would have accepted and eaten.  So, back to the kitchen for a little more cooking.  The steak finally came out at the correct temperature the third time, but by this time I had no appetitite and all the sides that had been on our table for close to half an hour, were cold and unappetizing.  I did try the steak, and while it was cooked properly, it had hardly any flavor.  I cut a few pieces right off of the bone, where there should have been more flavor, but it just wasn't there.  
During the meal, the manager came by three different times, with apologies and a free creme brulee, and they didn't charge for my wife's steak, but even with good service, the disappointment with the steaks was far too big of a letdown to ever consider returning or endorsing this place.

We had a vegetarian with us so I asked whether if he would be taken care of - the hostess assured us that he would.  But comes ordering, the waiter had no idea (even though the hostess said she checked) and told him he can order any of the side dishes (no pasta, no mixed veggie plate, just the side dishes).  Ok, I know we are in a Steakhouse, but we asked before seating!

The foie gras I ordered as an appetizer was much more veiny than I would have liked... I've definitely had much better.  The steak was great, but not as good as the less expensive one I later tasted at Bouchon.  And like the norms at most Steakhouses, we had to order all the sides (steak came with nothing except a few things of veggie).

The other problem was that we first ordered a petit sirah and then a zin ~ the zin was way too sweet as a second wine and the petit sirah was way too dry as the first... And the sommelier said nothing against our ordering (in fact suggested the second wine as a good second wine).

I expected so much more out of that halibut even though it was light and tender.  She enjoyed the steak as much as I did even though my cousin didn't like his steak.  My brother enjoyed his filet mignon.

I really liked my mac 'n' cheese (baked with bits of steak and topped with breadcrumbs).

I kinda liked my sauteed wild mushrooms.

I kinda liked my sauteed spinach (salty).

Sides were scarce and the spinach and mushrooms were served on small silver spoons with servings the size of a deck of cards.  Next time, we'll order sides for ourselves instead of sharing.  Then again 22 ounces of beef is very filling.  

We had a bottle of Flora Springs 2006 Merlot.  It had a bold, explosive punch at first sip and fruity flavors enveloped my tastebuds, but it had a dry mouthfeel.

Service was very inviting, comfortable, casual and fitted with a smile.  She always checked on us.  I can't say enough good things about our server.  For this alone (along with my steak and mac 'n' cheese) I'd come back in a heartbeat.  I wish I remembered her name.  She had dark hair in a ponytail and was full-bodied like our wine and just as receptive to our wonderful, fun-filled conversations.

We were walking around and come upon this place, peeked in and it looked all fancy. Thought we had to dress up to dine here. Nope, we went in got a table.  Very fancy inside, white table cloth, peaceful environment. 

She ordered some dozen oysters and a filet mignon. I ordered the main tail lobsters (2) and some beer, and got a veggie appetizer.

The appetizer was amazingly good. Her filet mignon was delicious. The waiter came out with my lobsters and gave me 4 tails instead of 2 indicating because the tails were too small, they gave me 4! I was eating it and the lobster was VERY VERY hard and tasted like rubber. I just ate most of it as i thought this was how it was suppose to taste. It's $79 lobster so it can't be cooked wrong right? Wrong.. My gf asked when the lobster tasted like rubber and the waiter said it wasn't suppose to taste like that. Overcooked. he yelled at the chef and only refunded us $21.

They should of refunded us the whole $79 for crappy overcooked lobster where I can get the same crappy lobster at Red Lobster for under $23 !

Don't ever eat lobster at a steak house in las vegas, my own fault. haha",Qr9M6aEHjp6cRPzhbJZ3ig,0,0,2,mMdQvwWGrNeqPs3xARHezQ

However, for our first night in Vegas, we decided to try out Les Artistes. The decor was beautiful. I found myself staring at the decor instead of paying attention to what people were saying.

We had a 6pm reservation and arrived a few minutes early. We were seated promptly and greeted by the server assistant. She got us water and our server came over. I selected a bottle of wine (admittedly more for the price than the wine itself) and he had it to our table very quickly.

We decided on the special for an entree, which was a filet mignon Oscar style with a lobster tail on the side. The menu clearly warned us that medium well and above would take 40 minutes or more to cook. I went out on a limb and ordered medium so we wouldn't have to wait as long. I was very happy with the results. Everything was cooked to perfection. Ironically, my wine choice ended up pairing quite well with our meal.

Our server was wonderful. He was joking around with us and always very quick to get us what we needed. I was very pleased with the level of service and quality of the food. Again, I'm no expert but I'd say that Les Artistes is one of the better steakhouses I've been to.",St-BJl91Y8k1MUborKBRhA,0,0,3,WMjns0bWRNJrOp_4w7kUkQ

It feels very closed off and claustrophobic, this is situated inside of the Paris, so there are no windows or any good people watching. Not to say the place wasn't decorated nicely. 

My food on the other had was excellent. I have been here twice and both times have ordered the same and shared with my friend, my appetizer was the ""garbage salad"" and it was excellent. Moved onto the bacon wrapped scallops and the tiger shrimp, when I say the shrimp were as big as the palm of my hand, I'm not joking. The scallops were perfect, none of that sandy gritty stuff you get sometimes. I never made it to dessert, dang it. Oh and I believe they sell half bottles of wine which Is clever. 

Last tip, if you go to one of the ""tickets for tonight"" booths around town, for $3 a person they will give you a voucher for here & you get 50% off your bill.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,0,0,4,Bz1JFYXcvvBglrY21qo-pQ

I ordered a duck entree and the filet mignon dinner :) And a few cosmo's later i was happy

Sitting mere feet away was Jay Leno (who was nice enough to say hello to us as we walked in) so we knew we were at a pretty nice establishment.

I ordered the Surf & Turf.  It was unbelievable.  Very good quality and plenty to share!  The wine sommelier was friendly and informative which helped greatly in pairing the perfect wine with my entree.

So, having an Aunt who is 7 stars at Harrahs group, the birthday brother in law chose Les Artistes.  I was hesitant because of some reviews and I think that there are so many steakhouses in Vegas that I thought there would be a better pick.  7 stars does have it's privileges.  The decor is kind of a second thought, some famous works of art (hence name) slapped on the walls, a glass mosaic ceiling and loft.. Odd space.
There is no international famous chef names on the door, no michelins, no Beards, but there pretty well should of been.  Oysters Rockerfeller were good (not awesome), shrimp cocktail were nice and huge not overcooked.  French onion soup was just okay, not enough onions, not enough cheese and not baked enough........

My (allegedly) prime piece of beef was tough and sinewy.  It was cooked to my request of medium, but the ribeye was not enjoyable.  It really lacked flavor.

The side of fries I ordered were very heavy with grease.  I mentioned this to a manager who visited our table.  All I got was a ""sorry you didn't enjoy them.""

The good news is that it's Vegas and there are a million other places to go instead of coming back here.  As a matter of fact, when I think back to how EMPTY this place was, it seems as thought others have already figured that out.",dc_1rBcKAjub2Nsh2HBvhA,4,1,2,wRr0W4ZiUnUAtayle1pGVw

We both ordered the special, which was an 8oz filet mignon topped with crab meat, asparagus, and bearnaise sauce. I'm sure some steak purists out there are cringing, but I'll eat a brick if it's got a good bearnaise on it. We also enjoyed a very nice and relatively inexpensive wine. I had no complaints about the food, but as I said, I'm not exactly a steak expert.

I had won some money earlier in the day so we were looking at all the menu's to decide if we wanted to eat in the hotel or go somewhere else.  I had preferred Mon Ami Gabi, but as we passed by here they were giving away coupons for 20% off for Les Artistes, so we decided to come here instead.

They had a seared scallop and fillet special, so I went with that, and my husband had the bone in NY strip.  Mine was more of a wet aged fillet and it had a sauce I wasn't happy with.  But I wolfed down the scallops, they were delicious.  My husband's NY strip was dry aged and much more flavorful.  I got a side of asparagus which was really incredible.  Normally vegetables are not the highlight of a meal, but these were.  Cooked very delicately, and the sauce that came with it was memorable.

This probably isn't a place you want to go to compared to other steak houses on the strip.  However if you can snag the 20% summer special coupon they have been giving out (it says on it you have to stay there and show your key to get the discount, but you don't, they will honor it anyhow), this is worth a try.

Next time I go, I will stick with the more high end steak (dry aged, prime) or just stick with seafood, which they do very well.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,1,4,aoJErIShJ_YLfN9YuUqBFg

First off, the atmosphere is very quiet and calming compared to the chaos of the casino outside.  My friends had to catch a Cirque show and the wait staff was great in getting our order and food out quickly.  I ordered a pear endive salad w/ candied walnuts and lobster bisque soup, and my friends ordered the tenderloin steak and scallops.  I have to say the food was quite delicious, particularly the steak and bisque (which had big chunks of lobster in it).  The steak was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly.  I was surprised w/ the variety of cuts they had as well.  

All in all, w/ the discount pricing was decent.  I probably won't be going back anytime soon simply because there are a million other restaurants I want to try in Vegas.
