Some of the games are just plain rip-offs as well, such as their virtual bowling simulator which has messed up sensors (throw the ball down the center and it detects it as a gutter??) or their $1.50/play Operation game which ended after 15 seconds with no warning.

With all that said, there are a couple of redeeming things about the place. Some of the arcade games are fun, and you'll have a lot to try if you like racing games. They also have pool tables, though again, many of them were out of order. Look in the free local discount books for some GameWorks coupons.",SFE4O0l39QsSc7UtpY9ePA,0,0,2,vU9bHxzOhP9OMxDausU8zQ

I'm a heavy DDR/ITG Junkie and the Supernova there is in great condition. Because of the heavy flow of people going in and out, there's always somebody watching you play and complimenting (or criticizing :P).

533832,2006-04-16,0,Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA,"This was my second trip to Gameworks and, although I still had a great time, the hubris of 2 hours of all-you-can-play video games seems to have worn off a bit and I experienced a few more hiccups this time around.  

First, I have always done the ""Play 2 hours for $25"" deal, which doesn't include some of the ""attractions"" like the rock climbing wall.  For 2 hours I think that I get $25 worth of fun.  If you're really wanting to blow a day here, they have all day passes for $35. 

The game selection is good, for the most part.  They have an alley of classic retro games along with the normal slew of shooters (House of the Dead series seems to be big since they have HotD 2-4) and racing games.  You can also play air hockey and mini-basketball.  The problem I found is that, especially during peak times, all the players migrate to the newest, coolest games so you might be stuck playing Deer Hunter the entire night.  Still, there is a good selection so I'm sure that you can find something you like while you wait it out to play the latest and greatest.  Definitely survey the scene before you commit your dough.

There were a couple problems I encountered which diminished my experience.  First, there were a decent number of out-of-order games, one that even went on the fritz while I was playing it so I had to stop.  That's annoying, especially if it's one of the more popular games.  Second, the swipe cards that they give you to use for your unlimited play seem to be reaaaaaaally picky.  Have you ever had a friend who is 5' 5"" and swears that he'll never date anyone shorter than him who likes cats and won't wear blue and isn't a brunette and won't go with him to strip shows and smokes and hasn't voted in the last 4 gubernatorial elections and is between the ages of 22-25?  That's what these cards are like.  There is nothing more annoying than being ""on the clock"" trying to eff up Darth Vader's poo and have your card suddenly not be readable by the video game.  If it doesn't work within 10 seconds you have to start from the beginning, which drives me nuts.  When we asked one of the employees about it he was really nice and coached us on how to use them but we still experienced quite a few problems.  I'm one of those guys who likes to finish video games so this was a huge deal for me.  UGH.  The third problem is that I got a blister from playing House of the Dead 4.  That was not Gameworks fault  though; maybe I just have tender hands?  In any case, cool game.  Zombies, meet the wrath of my UZI!  

I would recommend checking this place out if you are into video games.  Do the math and figure out whether an unlimited play or debit card is right for you.  Without the pressure of ""the clock"" and getting your money's worth, some of the problems I mentioned might be avoided.  Also, try out the climbing wall, it's pretty fun (I climbed to the top).  

If nothing else, think of it this way:  at least those are 2 hours that you spent not playing the dollar slots so you actually made money!",FeWKX0KT1xvOHc77XqDTNg,2,0,3,PLNyyCPwyXREjVSeUV2FKw

694107,2011-03-30,1,Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA,"I've been here about 20 times :)  A tip for locals, the best place to park is MGM self parking off of Tropicana, and just make your way through MGM past the lions and out onto the strip.  Gameworks is just past all the people in costumes and M&M world.  There's a sign for Glacier Bar, that bar is attached to the inside of Gameworks.

I'll start with the bad :

- Some of the games break, it's to be expected with all the kids running through there.

- Over-priced weak alcohol.

- Pay per hour system, just don't do it.  Go for the points!

Now the good stuff:

- A rarity in America, customers always come first here!  If you have ANY problems with ANY games the staff will comp you those points and more, and are very friendly about it.  The only time they weren't friendly I talked to the manager and that kid got fired on the spot.

- Same goes for the weak drinks, tell the barkeep about it and it's fixed no problems!

- The food is surprisingly cheap and awesome, I would say on par with Red Robin.  Much much more than you'd expect for an arcade.

- Loads and loads of games for everybody, more than you'll be able to play in one visit for sure.

- Points system!  I load up a card for $54 (sounds expensive right!) and it comes with 400 points.  $22=120p / $27=190p / $37=260p / $54=400.  The average game costs 2-4 points, the highest is 8.  I'll use the same card for multiple visits.  If you have multiple people load up one card and pass it around.

- It's probably the ONLY place on the strip where you can stay entertained the whole day for well under $100.",CWy-7P4_L2LeO41qO9DMbg,1,2,4,TxqsI8UX9fpWEMC5E9OjuQ

My 5 and 8 yr old boys had a blast, played for three hours non-stop and wanted more. They could've stayed in there all week. I'm not much of an arcade fan, but I can see the place's appeal- it had a bunch of motion games, like the ones where you move like you're actually in the cockpit of a plane, or inside a racecar. The timeplay cards made it convenient for me, since I didn't have to keep giving them quarters every 15 minutes, like at Circus Circus. It is kind of pricey, but when you consider the quality of the games, I guess they can justify the premium.

I purchased my ""All Day Pass"" from the Tix2Nite booth in downtown for $17.50 plus a $4 service fee. I didn't mind this, as I was planning togo in and out during the day and to play a lot of the new games that where there since the last I was there. When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was how many games were taken out since the last time I was there. They ripped out a whole block of games, and installed some sort of crappy ""virtual bowling"". They also took out some other ones to but a buffet area for special events. No problem I thought, and proceeded to exchange my voucher.

After exchanging my ticket, the first arcade I wanted to play was the House of the Dead 4. After waiting a while, I asked the cashier where the operator was. She told me that he was on break, and to check back in a half hour. When I came back it was the same BS story. This was true for all the operator assisted games. Even the regular games had problems with them, as 17 were broken at the time. When I asked the manager what was going on, he told me that Gameworks had to cut hours. I felt ripped off !!! Do yourself a favor and stay far and away from this poorly run arcade. 

On the plus side, I found a kick ass pinball museum in Las Vegas. There must of been over 100 games that went from the 1930's on up. The owner is very nice, and he is also the one the service's the machine too. Their site is (http://www.pinballmuseum.org)",jHairzC8v1liBgApezy6Iw,0,0,2,UcQL5zd25_QJVkjW6Vccww

The worst part was the fact that a lot of the games were broken down and the staff of three people could not be bothered with fixing them. 

Oh well, what else would you do with a little kid in Vegas? There's a few fun games here and there....like a two person racing game where you alternate control of the wheel and an air hockey game where each person gets 2 hitting things and there's 3 pucks in plane. There's a few nice flight simulator games....definitely better than just sitting in the hotel room if you are under 21.

After checking into our hotel and eating some tasty, tasty oysters at Harrah's, we were looking for something to occupy ourselves until dinner. I played some slots and video poker, but the machines were not being kind to me. What to do now? ""How about an arcade?"" my boyfriend said. I remembered this Gameworks. 

We walked over and bought ourselves a $20 card. We thought that might occupy us for a little while, and then we'd figure out something else to do. As we walked off the escalator into the cavernous game-filled area, some random guy approached us. He and his kids were leaving, and he had two unlimited gaming cards that weren't set to expire for another few hours. Did we want them? But of course. 

So we spent a couple of hours down in that gaming area, using those unlimited cards to play many different shooting, fighting, and racing games. Then, when we finally got bored of that, we used the card we bought for all the ticket-giving games. It was glorious. Games, games, everywhere! We even ended up with enough tickets for a souvenir shot glass. It was awesome.

I love this place. The usual party crew hit this place up courtesy of a 50% groupon we received few months back, 

Originally we wanted to hit up Rambo, but, one of the controllers were broke, but hold on....We had to roll to the bar and grab a beer..Blue moon of course :). Ok, back to Rambo...Well, we didn't get a chance to play, so we did the next best thing, House of the Dead baby! 

It was a competition between My wife and myself one team, and the other team Brian B and Rob P. We both had the trick of swiping to get additional credit, but they did it more than us, because in the end....What happened is we reached the second to the last villain, and we ran out! Which meant, we have to take some petron shots from the bar, yes, that was the bet. Of course, fellow yelpers Rob P and Brian B took care of business and finished the game with one credit left! Damn them lol.

From that point the wife and I hit up the hummer race game, and after that grabed some grub and more beer.

After a great meal and some games (Sliders and beer), we hit up Pac Man! Now this was nice, Four controllers, four yelpers, we competed baby! Best out of five, and loser takes shots...Of course, we lost track and all of us took shots.

Awesome time yelp peeps!

Oh ya...On the way there, before we hit up gameworks, we saw Elvis leaving the building and game him a ride to his car!

Most of the arcades I see are filled with redemption games, skeeball, and a couple of beat up Cruisn' cabinets.  So I was really excited to find Gameworks.  This arcade is HUGE, and has an awesome selection of games.

One of the things I liked was the layout.  The games were grouped by type: shooters, fighters, racers, simulators, and pinball.  Highlights include:

- separate room with every House of the Dead game, complete with blood-splattered walls and zombies  
- brand new Pump It Up NX machine
- section of old school cabinets (Moon Patrol, baby!)
- Mario Kart Arcade
- Air Trix (I miss this game)
- MvC2
- Tekken 5 (with card dispenser, if you dig that sort of thing)
- Star Wars arcade game
- House of the Dead 4 Special (a sight to behold)

3299828,2012-01-03,0,Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA,"I was thinking this place would be better than circus circus. It was but the problem is the particular game I like to play was intial D and Maximum Tuning. Both of these games are outdated in gameworks, there are newer versions of the the games like the initial D AA and Maximum Tuning 4 A+ or w/e it was I cannot remember. While I was playing the Maximum Tuning 3 in gameworks the four arcade systems were not linked up together even though it would be enjoyable to race against my cousin and other people. The card reader of the games does not work and they, gameworks, does not fill them with cards so kids or anyone could save their progress in the game.

The only good thing was the initial D 4. Everything about the game worked for example playing against other people, cards, and machines mechanics.

Other games- These games are working but may have some problems. Throughout the place I say about 80% of the games are working.

Bad games-  These games are either off or broken. They have a couple of these machines located in the fighting games area.

I came back to see if anything change, there were just a little changes.
The midnight maximum tuning 3 did finally work of reading cards, vs, and ghost battle if you have a card already. The only thing about it is the machines still do not carry the cards to save data on it and play it later, because I luckily had a card that was that version and I began to play the game but sadly I ran out of certain number of plays a card can handle. I needed the machine to at least have 1 brand new card so I can update the card and play where I left off.

------ Little info. on what I mean about the cards.
The cards are considered memory cards for the game. Each card has a sixty game life, meaning if you lose a race, win a race, time race, ghost battle, and etc. it counts down until zero, when it reaches zero the player puts the card back in and the machine will offer to get a new card. If the machine had these special cards I would of got a new card and played longer, but I left disappointed and found something better to do.

Service: The employees are really nice and try to make conversation with you. They make sure you understand how time cards work and their restrictions and everything.

Decoration: This place is located in the basement level in-between the Coca Cola factory and M&M World. The area is dimly lit! It is pretty big and the place is jam-packed with lots of arcade style games (mainly consisting of racing or shooting games). They also have old-school games like Gauntlet, Pac-Man, and Centipede. I love playing the DDR game there! Some of the machines change once in a while (i.e. they recently took out the air hockey tables and put in a Rambo shooting game).

This is a great place to go to if you want to kill some time or if you are underaged and cannot gamble. They offer time options (1, 2, 3, and all-day). I always get the all-day pass for $35 because you can leave and come back if you get tired of playing games all day. The 3 hour option is already $30 so might as well fork over $5 more. Also, if you do not have a card, you will be charged a $2 fee so remember to always bring it with you to save money!.

Many of the games were down but they didn't seem to be in a hurry to fix any of them. We ended up going a few times during the week and saw no progress towards fixing said machines. The arcade was also a bit too dark and very dingy for my liking. The guys I went with had a good time, but they're pretty easy to please and spent the majority of the time playing the 4 man Pac Man machine - which apart from DDR was just about the only working thing I was interested in.

My friends got the all day pass because we ended up getting a few $10 off coupons which made it worth it. The all day timed cards can't be used with ticket or prize bearing machines, which eliminated a whole section of the arcade right off the bat. It's not a huge place, either. The prizes you could win with tickets were great anyways, but as I said there wasn't much variety to start with and the pool just kept getting smaller. There is a restaurant there which served questionable looking food, and they had nothing like popcorn to munch on quickly. They only allowed drinks on the arcade floor anyways.

Pass on eating here, big mehs.  There's a few pool tables on the upper level, if you need some non-digital gaming.

So for $20 an hour you can share around a pass to bew bew with your friends some aliens, or play Tekken, or whatever you feel like.  It's a bit high priced, but at least most of the games seemed to work.  Giant Protip:  Don't get into the motion simulator when you're drunk.   Don't end up being... that guy, proving drinking and digitally driving should be illegal.",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,0,0,3,OW4vNOoWA3IOmIOgVkGO6g
5290733,2011-03-21,5,Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Gameworks will always have a special place in my heart since I grew up near one (Puente Hills) which my mom unceremoniously dumped me at every Saturday until I was 14. Sadly (or perhaps thankfully since my mother has then decide to parent me), my childhood Gameworks closed BUT, fear not, Vegas Gameworks makes up for it and more.

First of all, I don't like gambling. Actually I don't really dislike it, I just don't care for it. So I don't gamble and I spend most my time at Vegas eating buffets and poking around the hotel room as my companion hits the tables. But one thing the boy and I can agree with are.... CRANE ARCADE GAMES. You know, those things that grab prizes for a buck. Amazing.

The last time boyfriend and I were at Vegas, we came here three times and spent upwards to $160, mostly on crane games. They have an amazing Hello Kitty one and a grand assortment of Japanese style prizes that do not suck. Full-sized Mickey dolls, Pokemon, Care Bears, the works. The people who work here are soo nice, I cannot stress that enough. Jennifer and Jeremy really went out of their ways to help us with whatever we needed and were amazingly personable and gracious. I wished all stores has customer service like that. 

We left with a sack full of prizes and (cheesily enough) really great memories of just pounding against a glass partition, yelling DROPPPPPP THE PRIZE. I know it's just an arcade, but amongst the stresses of daily life, it's nice to escape to an arcade and relive some of that childhood glee. You can't buy that kind of innocence and joy.

This place is kind of empty, which I don't know if it's because of the Vegas economy or just the declining nature of arcades. But you know what, leave the Blackjack tables and drop a couple coins into a machine here. It's definitely more satisfying than two Jacks.

5373427,2012-01-17,1,Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA,"Once upon a time, this was the place to go for a few drinks and enjoy some video games with your friends. Now there is a swanky club with personal gaming and this place is more of a distant memory. Yes, the days of marketing Vegas as a family friendly destination are long gone, but Gameworks is still around.

The selection is becoming more of a history museum of classic arcade games with a few modern additions. A few of my friends and I got a couple of two hour play cards and went around to a majority of the machines. The only ones off limit were the prize and ticket games. We played a few shooters, fighting, and racing games from when we were in high school for pure nostalgic enjoyment. Then there are the DDR and Pump dance games. I am not a fan of dancing games, but once I saw the new Pump game had K-Pop, took off with the swipe card. There are old classic songs from Sechkies and DJ Doc mixed in with Big Bang, 4minute, Orange Caramel, Beast, and SHINee. To most, this means nothing, but I did not care if I looked like an idiot. This was entertaining enough to distract me for 20 minutes. 

As an adult, two hours here is a stretch. Even with my enthralled love of K-Pop, it barely covered the time. It was nice to just act like a kid again, but a full day pass would be too much.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,1,3,AH-hFHoYOYGSEpOOOuP9eg

When I returned a few years later the machine was no longer there which made me sad since you can't really find it anywhere else anymore.

Even so I had a good time here. I had no issues with broken machines and after burner climax was a dream to play (Actually beat that game here FINALLY)

I was surprised to see a lot of UFO Catcher (claw) machines - I almost felt like I was in a Japanese arcade.  They also had DDR Extreme, DDR Supernova, and Pump It Up machines in good working order.  We didn't spend too much time here, just long enough to play a few rounds of DDR and scope out the place.

We didn't expect to see such a well-rounded arcade in Vegas.  I can't vouch for the food, but it's worth a stop if you're looking for some video game entertainment, or a break from the casinos.",f6gLCW3xasyascQLoy5vdQ,0,0,4,gFhtvksafFr_FXK6tYGTnw

Since moving to vegas about 2 weeks ago, i've tried to do anything and everything possible that doesnt involve going to bars/clubs. I had always passed by this place but never went inside until this past saturday. I didnt eat the food, and the outdoor bar was closed, but i assume it would be open during warmer weather. 

Gameworks is pretty decent sized. My gf had a yardstick alcohol drink bought from fat tuesdays at planet hollywood (hurricane 51 with 2 viles of tequilas) and we thought it was against the rules to bring it in... however the security guard told us ""well, its a kids place, so we kinda frown upon that.... but i dont care. go ahead"". Well alright then! There were a few games I had never seen before: One was an air hockey game that played with 3 discs and two hitters (one in each hand). game up to 15. the other game was virtual bowling. real lane real ball but no pins. you bowl it right under a screen and it virtually shows you how many/what pins you knocked down. although not 100% on the money, it was close enough. Spent $20 for the night and left with a smile on my face. And I didnt have to take a taxi back to my apartment. Viva Las Vegas",JlkHKBnHKdK8Tpls0AF5Aw,8,8,3,CU49F_vYm_Jbb_M3C_45og

We RV camp and ride ATV's in the nearby desert sand dunes. When the weather turns sour we put the quads away and head for Gameworks, Blue Man group,, and the wildest buffet we could find.

My kids say Game Works has lost touch with what kids want.
They are in competition with Playstation and X Box and really need some original thought with inspiration to make a comeback.

The upstairs bar is fun but a bit pricey, so check for drink specials, they can be a great bargain.
The food is above average.

Used to be clean and very well run,, now just a tourist trap with no soul nor imagination,, no sense of fun nor humor, and it's falling into dis-repair.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,0,0,2,PyxDuLVNwRiQiYQyV2pZdQ

I wish I had checked the game floor before we purchased the cards because I was pretty disappointed.  Many, many machines were listed as out of service and some of the games that were on didn't function properly.  There wasn't a very good selection of games in my opinion.    Our second card after an hour started to read as ""insufficient funds"".  At this point we were really overheated from the heat inside the building and kind of pissed off so we just left and decided not to come back again.
