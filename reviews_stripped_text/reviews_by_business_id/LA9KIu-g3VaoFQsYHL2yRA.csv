but her daughter was very friendly.",s4Q-x70Q9IcnLREPZE5OVQ,0,0,3,dyEeOO1DmbT2TtMtPDpHGg

We usually get the teriyaki chicken noodle bowl and we loved it.. We ordered and got our food, we took it home and opened the box and saw that the chicken had changed.. It used to be strips but this time it was shredded and it tasted like the rotisserie chicken you get from Wal-Mart.. And also the noodles were flat instead of round.. It was terrible.. My husband and I will most likely not return.. 
It's very unfortunate that they changed their recipes because they really had a good thing going.. If you've been going to this restaurant for years but haven't been back recently BE WARNED it's changed for the worst..",et3Qshfa29ZEvPrtB1h8jQ,1,0,1,uI8Dra9AkX4PpUI00CJRrQ

Tonight we ordered food got the standard ready in 20 minutes and so we headed over. Food was not cooked and it took about 30 additional minutes to get order completed. 
My husband brought it home and no one could eat it. The food was disgusting!
Shrimp in lobster sauce is a soup yet it came in a flat box, not sure what it was but it certainly was not what we usually get with this order.
Noodles were way over cooked, sticky, bland and  not of the quality or flavor we have come to expect in our years of ordering here.
No paper wrap chicken, no BBQ anything!
Rice was flavorless and boring.
The lemon chicken was way over flavored and was nauseating to smell. 
I paid almost 60.00 to feed my family and friends and will never waste my money again.
I would return the food but we didn't get it home till 9:30 and if I take it back in the morning I know they will not refund our money. 
Lesson learned, seems they changed chefs or owners and now the food is horrible. Bring back the feisty old lady at least then the food was edible!
I see this place closing in the very near future.",qPW--WHKIZeofXU2Xukhag,0,0,1,KPbQw4SOcspxYyoHp87y2w
1552555,2012-12-28,0,LA9KIu-g3VaoFQsYHL2yRA,Absolutely Love this place. No where else in vegas can you get so much food for such a inexpensive price and be this delicious. I come here ATLEAST twice a month. The General Tsao Chicken is amazing and the Thai Tea with boba is to die for. MUST TRY if you're in vegas!,T3ddhYeXpDGPUjhjbOikTQ,2,0,5,8STPB3XOdUnwl0hoWv5YdA
1662863,2014-04-01,0,LA9KIu-g3VaoFQsYHL2yRA,My mom lives down the street so she comes here all the time. We have been coming here for years and have never had a problem. My favorites are the chicken fried rice and mango boba. This restaurant also sells little asian trinkets for pretty cheap. I like this place a lot. Give it a try.,l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,1,2,5,3WBfFiAyPUo3e2wGUrWpEg

My normal order is 2 orders of enrolls and wanton soup. Hubby' s is teriyaki chicken.  I  really want to try the yakisoba, but the eggrolls suck me in every time.",A56LwaBHeC61nwZQEP6dnA,0,0,4,Tk3K7HN9HkZyvhPPnUyg3A
2778865,2013-03-30,4,LA9KIu-g3VaoFQsYHL2yRA,"Im always down to try new places I havnt been to especially when its teriyaki!

Here I ordered the chicken/beef combo. Comes with vegetables and a drink for around 6 bucks and change. The chicken was a bit dry and the beef was tender. The teriyaki sauce they drizzle on the food was ok. I thought it lacked a little bit of that sweet taste that compliments the saltiness of the soy sauce. The veggies were a bit soggy like it was overcooked a bit. 

Service wise the Chinese lady that took my order was ok. Even though she spoke english, she still had a strong accent. Kind of reminds me of some of my aunts when they talk to me (im Filipino by the way). It almost sounds like she is mad when she talks but I know she isnt because that is what im used to. Anyways, after I ordered, a white dude came in and started asking questions about the menu since it was his first time. For the next 5 minutes, I dont know if they were arguing or fighting because since the Chinese lady talks like she is mad, the white dude kind of raised his voice to match the tone of the Chinese lady. In the end, the white dude just turned around and left with a disgusted look on his face. I was kind of shaking my head because I wasnt sure exactly what went down. Because of that, I didnt seem to enjoy my food as much as I wanted on top of it not tasting as good as I wanted it to be.

While I was there, there were a group of girls that ordered smoothies with boba. I asked them if it was any good. They said they come here all the time to have their boba fix. So I thought I would give it a try since they recommeded it. I orderd avocado since that was my favorite. Once I took a sip I was really disappointed. The boba was good but the drink was way too sweet! 

As for the overall observance of the place, well they have different posters on their walls that are for sale if you wanted it. A couple examples are Jet Li and Bruce Lee. They also had a separate glass counter that had all sorts of trinkets in it that was for sale also. The size of the place was pretty decent with about 6 medium sized tables and enough chairs.

Overall, I wasnt too impressed. The next time im in the area I might give these guys another try. Maybe the ambiance and food will be better.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,5,5,2,_GBycEC5XdqXbOn_gaVutg
3193384,2014-01-16,0,LA9KIu-g3VaoFQsYHL2yRA,"Been here many times when I didn't know a better Teriyaki place that shall go unnamed. 
Great prices, big selection, bad service.

I was a customer until I got turned off my the main old lady in charge. I asked for a simple replacement of chicken that had TOO much sauce and she didn't want to do it. Eventually she did but gave a really bad attitude; this is after coming many times. 

The Teriyaki was OK. chicken was undercooked as I noted a few times. The main reason why I came here so much because it was cheap, close to my house, and only teriyaki place I knew.

I found a few other places so this will no longer be my destination to satisfy my teriyaki cravings.",OHMMuvvrDf62ZomsTRvvig,0,0,2,ODXfRCihJjG31CX6AjEiFg
4131915,2015-01-06,1,LA9KIu-g3VaoFQsYHL2yRA,I have not been back since their recipes changed. But before then we would always get their chicken chow mein. It was the best chow mein I have ever had! I would drive across town for this. I'm sure all their other menu items were just as delicious! Won't be retuning just because I haven't heard good things about the new menu. My sister recently went and said they totally changed everything.,geXGwOaHx9WVsgk4bRE8-g,0,0,5,t4d03GtDmxBvlQHe5epqjg

But let's get serious here, The Teriyaki Company is pretty awesome.  $3.99 for the teriyaki bowl, and I hear they have a second-to-none awesome deal on lunch.  Teriyaki chicken lunch plate with egg rolls for $4.99. 

Speaking of egg rolls, they are absolutely LEGIT.  Being from Hong Kong myself, I know a legit egg roll when I see it.  It is twice as long as the ones you usually see at similar teriyaki chicken places, and the timing of the frying is superb.  The egg rolls don't have none of those crazy cabbage fillers, but instead, they are pure chicken and, wait for it...., chopped up chestnuts!  Yep!  The chestnuts act as a filler, but they also create that extra crunch, not that it need it... But chestnuts in egg rolls is what you will find in Asia, or at least in well-to-do restaurants in Hong Kong.  Still not convinced?  I usually don't even eat the egg rolls that come with my meals, but I would go back to TTC just for the egg rolls.

Now that since I am here at the TTC again for the egg rolls, might as well get the better-than-your-standard chicken teriyaki plate!  Now, mind you, this is still a chicken teriyaki bowl after all, so don't expect a life-changing experience because this is not the restaurant for it.  However, if you are interested in fresh chicken and just the right amount of teriyaki sauce with slightly-moister-than-usual rice, then TTC has it all!

I also tried the yakisoba, and THAT was also awesome.  I don't know how yakisoba can be awesome, but it was!  

Listen, I feel a bit shameful to be giving TTC a 4 star just because it is located in a somewhat gross side of town and that it is basically a mock of Asian food, but I will feel wrong to not yelp about TTC because they actually do know what they are doing there, for what it's worth!  So, go try it!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,3,3,4,WlkClBaOkiCxELFlgWN-Tg
