The only down side was a select few waiters/ waitresses did not have the time of day for us after our orders were taken.. Plus its awkward when another waiter has to check up on your table.. If your not at the Bar or Hibachi I would go somewhere. Great Food Overall.,ur-c8lxxpLvcnJNE22xjkw,0,0,4,NdndVX7W8Su8xayf80UMcA

If you happen into the bar when, look for a guy named Dante, and ask him to make you a drink - you won't be disappointed. He has made me dozens of unique creations, every one absolutely delicious and just the right booze-to-other ratio. That alone has been worth the 4 stars, without question.",WTuLuxMEeArXsVj3HYq01Q,2,0,4,jms08O4clVlvvXbebBcZbw

Plus, one time I did find a bug in the sauce that they served.  It was alive and I understand that could just be a fluke.  Anytime you have a Geisha experience is it all based on how good of a chef you have.  If they are in to the experience and want to make it fun or if you are the 10th table of the day on their fifth work day.  It is affordable and always a nice place but not a home run!",FbtABefFuBEBQlFfp9KZbQ,0,0,4,OCHqFk5E8L1FytOcUPo21g

I had veggie tempura, eggrolls and chicken teriyaki. The service itself was excellent and very attentive on a slow Sunday night. The veggie tempura came out with shrimp in it though... I guess there was some kind of mix up. I didn't bother making a fuss of it since the veggie pieces were good. The dipping sauce was too salty though, and I ended up using their soy sauce which was somehow less salty! The eggrolls were more like chicken pepper taquitos. Very peppery and very crunchy, not delicate at all. The chicken teriyaki was fine. It was cooked okay, but bland. Despite the friendly staff, the food definitely needs improvement.",1RKzBkVUPwMCLhzgZR1lYQ,3,1,2,112IR6jpLOPH-k49txpqZQ

539512,2014-10-02,0,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"I really like this place. I've been here twice. The first time I went was in February 2014 for my birthday. We had hibachi and our cook was very nice and funny. Everyone we encountered was pleasant.

Last night I went for the sake tasting. Albeit unorganized, I really enjoyed the event. One of my favorite sakes was the Tyku coconut.

The pourers we encountered at the first part of the event were all very friendly. After that the crowd really thinned out and we were wondering where everyone went when we saw some people walking into a room. We asked some people and they confirmed that it was the VIP area. When we went in we saw that there was already a round of food that we missed. Over the course of the event I only got a few small food items. I don't think they accounted for how many people would sign up for VIP.

Also, (and this wasn't a big deal as I had had a substantial amount of sake before this point) they ran out of sake at approximately 915pm (45 minutes before the event was supposed to end. The food stopped coming out at approximately 9pm (an hour before the event was supposed to end).

Overall, we definitely got our money's worth, but I wish there had been more food. The two people that were pouring in the VIP event were also very friendly. The male person (I'm not sure what his name was, but he seemed like the manager) was also very knowledgable about sake.",6VhDHuE8RsB0iBG_zSKy1Q,0,0,5,EQL6h3p1Q_stfWWxXC7v9g

We had my 2 YO daughter with us, and I was shocked she was as patient as she was. In their defense, it was a Friday night & we didn't have a reservation. 

I highly recommend someone in each party ordering the Geisha Special, especially if your party would like an appetizer & is open to drinking sake. My husband ordered it with the egg roll as his appetizer. The egg roll was a large enough appetizer for 3 people! It also came with a small hot sake.

So there has been a strong rumor spread by the venue that they had this amazing special till a certain date. It was unlimited. Then it was limited to a few. NOW, it is limited to one.
So, I called the wrong geisha house first and asked about the details on the specials before inviting people. They did not want to help me because this geisha house is a different owner. Makes sense I guess. 
So, I finally got the right number and called this one. Yes the special is now limited to one and it was mentioned by the person who answered the phone. ""It was unlimited and they just changed it."" 
Spreading the word about an unlimited special till the first week of August then changing it randomly. GREAT MARKETING? Hahaha. 
The first of many single stars to come perhaps. 
Time to pull together the mental notes about the food and get a second very detailed review up. 
Regardless of the specials, we still ate with an open mind.

Customer Service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

Reservations were made for 6:30 with the Teppanyaki Grill for my boyfriend's stepsister's birthday. 6 of the 8 people had arrived before the reservation, and my boyfriend and I were a few minutes late because we got off on the wrong exit. We got a text saying that they're all waiting because they could not be seated unless the entire party was there. I'm under the impression that a reservation means that an entire table is is RESERVED ahead of time, for a specific party, and will be prepped for the the party prior to arriving. Therefore, people can be seated at a table that is RESERVED though some may arrive a few minutes late, much like how if a friend is late for dinner, you are seated anyways and can wait for them. After arriving, we were not seated until 7 pm for our ""reservation"".

After being seated at the grill, 15 minutes went by where not a single server asked us if we wanted any drinks. The table next to us (only a few feet away) had a large party, and received attention from over 3 servers. While servers are walking back and forth around our table, we were glanced at, and others tried their hardest to avoid eye contact. After being purposely neglected, I walked up to the drink station used by the staff and asked two servers if I could place an order for drinks because we still haven't been helped yet. They asked where I was seated, and I pointed at the largest table closest to them that is in plain view their POV. The two servers ran off to find someone else, though they were in charge of bringing drinks to customers. 

Another member of our party went to go find the manager because at this point, everything is becoming ridiculous. It is now nearly an hour past our reservation, and we still haven't received any drinks, nonetheless food. Though it was a Saturday night, the restaurant was empty, and there were plenty of staff that could accommodate us. Finally, a server from the next table came to us to ask what was wrong. We said we were actively being ignored because the table next to us was receiving plenty of attention whereas ours was not. She apologized and asked what we wanted for our drinks, but the birthday girl decided that she wanted to go to the Teppanyaki grill down the street instead because if we had to wait over what is now 20 minutes for drinks, the food is going to take much longer. We all left, and found the birthday girl's father still talking to the manager. The manager barely even apologized, and seriously seemed like he didn't understand what the problem was. 

We went down the street and spent money at Sushi Tower instead. They were amazing.",8rhV5BuWzGv1sJ3H4vueew,6,3,1,i7uINj35qCuhQqHV97vOFg

Decided on the sake sangria and it is AWESOME. Very ginger-y. I would definitely order it again. We'll come back for the happy hour sushi, too. The bar/outdoor patio is lovely, and perfect for when the sun goes down.

They were out of cold sake, and then a server shark offered our group of girls sake bombs (acting like they would be comped) but then charged us on our bill.  The most annoying part was that out party had already ordered hot sake and beer for our table?

The sweet honey and the ice cream that seeps throught the crispy bread makes it so much better. 

I always leave a space in my stomache for this dessert, after eating the pork gyoza and the lamb lollipops. 

I also enjoy the hibachi very much, since I'm not able to find a hibachi restaurant in my local neighborhoods.

 I ask for light soy sauce and oil, since I don't like it too salty or greasy, which creates the best hibachi food. I'm all around satisfied with this restaurant.

Apache, which, by the way, is no longer ""Geisha House"". We didn't find out the error until it was time to pay. We'd told the host upon arriving that we had a Groupon so either this location was running it's on Groupon deal or the host didn't understand what I was saying. Anyway...). The teppanyaki tables were taken so we  were seated in the dining area. 

The decor is stunning. Elegant yet hip. Comparable to any Strip restaurant. Dark and intimate, even though it's a large place. Our waitress was super nice and made some great recommendations.

I started with a lychee martini. It was a little on the sweet side but good. I think it could have used a fresh lychee or two.

We ordered the Japanese Hot Rocks for an appetizer. This is a cook-it-yourself dish and was quite tasty. The strip loin medallions are very thinly sliced. You dip them in the accompanying sesame sauce then throw them on the hot rocks and let them cook for a few seconds on each side. Nice, light start to a meal. 

We shared (as recommended by our waitress) the Geisha Special. The special came with soup and salad. The salad was fine, the soup was flavorful and good. We went with the egg rolls to start and they were delicious. Crunchy exterior wrapped around yummy goodness. The steak was perfectly cooked and the rice was colorful, sweet and savory. A ton of food but very good.

For dessert, we ordered the green tea creme brulee with red bean ice cream. The custard was FANTASTIC! Its base was perfectly silky and generously infused with green tea. It wasn't too sweet so it balanced well with the crispy sugary top. The red bean ice cream was very creamy but I thought it was bland. I'm not familiar with red bean ice cream so I don't have much to compare it to. I know Japanese desserts tend not to be as sweet as their American counterparts so maybe this is what it's supposed to taste like. Either way, I thought the ice cream was bland. 

The dishes, from start to finish, were beautifully executed and presented. I've tried several teppanyaki places in Summerlin (Hoikaddo, Ohjah, the place that used to be Geisha House on Ft Apache and is now something else) and this is my favorite.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,0,1,4,QFSx4crlKfQ_ylqSaXtb8w

Food was ok but the SERVICE was AWFUL and I work in the service industry, as a server! I have been there a couple times before and it just kepts getting worse. On previous visits me and my fiancé have always felt rushed so this time I asked the server before we ordered if he could make sure to space out the meal so we didn't get the everything at once. We both ordered the geisha special which comes with soup, salad, an shrimp appetizer and then we ordered drinks and extra appetizers on top of that. The soup, salad, and shrimp appetizer came out at once and we still had not gotten the drinks we ordered. Finally the drink came and before I could even pour my beer the additional appetizers we ordered came, along with the meal!I understand wanting to turn a table but this was ridiculous especially after we had asked for it to be spaced out. The server who had disappeared finally came over and I explained that we had just gotten our soup salad and all appetizers and had asked for the main meal to come later. He took the meals away. With a new baby going out to dinner is are only time to talk so we don't like to just scarf down are food. My fiancé let the server know if they wanted to start the meals that would be fine since we were almost done with the appetizers. 30 seconds later he came out of the back with food. Umm that was a little to quick. The plates were hot but the food was cold, it was the exact same food. Are dinner, which was not cheap by any means, had just been taken to the back and put under a heat lamp! I ask to speak to a manager. The ""manager"" that came over looked like he was 19 and obviously no restaurant experience. He stated "" I have to go talk to my server I'll get back to you"". Seriously!? We were in shock with the cold meal still sitting on the table. He came back later and said he guessed they would go ahead and remake it.The server was rude and only came back to the table to drop the bill off. The meal took almost an hour to remake. By this time I was over it and didn't even want the food anymore as we needed to leave. The remade food came out still. Nor the server or the manager ever apologized for anything and nothing was taken off the bill! I get better service at applebees's when I pay $20.

1406631,2014-07-14,3,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"On June 29th, I saw a ""deal"" on Living Social for this restaurant located at 9719 W. Flamingo Road. I read the details to my husband and we decided to buy it. I called yesterday (July 13) around 12 pm to place my reservation for last night. The restaurant was not open yet, but I left a voice mail and my call & they returned around 4 pm. I told the person making the reservation about my Living Social deal and she set up a reservation for us for 7 pm. She asked for my name and phone number at that time.
 We live near the M Resort, so my husband and I left our home around 6:35 to get to the restaurant on time. We were actually quite excited for the ""experience"" we thought we were going to have. We planned on trying a couple of sushi rolls in addition to details listed within the Living Social deal. 
 When we arrived, I told the hostess my name and she proceeded to tell me that the manager wasn't going to accept my Living Social deal, saying that it had already expired. I pulled up the voucher on my phone and showed her that the expiration date was September 10, 2014. She seated us (although I asked to sit at a table for 2 versus a booth for 6, but was instead seated at a half booth/half chair table) and I thought that the Living Social ordeal was solved, but the server came to the table and said the same thing. I accessed the voucher again in my phone and she only said that the manager was not going to honor the deal I purchased just 2 weeks prior. I asked to speak with the manager and we waited for a few minutes. The restaurant was not busy and I felt that we waited long enough for attention from the manager, so we left. When leaving, at the hostess station, I again made sure that the hostess verified the expiration date of our voucher and took a business card, on which I asked her to write her name on it. In all of that time, I was never approached by the manager.
 I worked in restaurants for several years in my late teens and twenties. My husband and I eat out at least twice a month. When we find a place we like, we always return. Our bills at restaurants are always $100 (or more) for the two of us as we always order drinks and often appetizers or desserts. We did not need a free meal (which isn't totally true because I did pay just under $50 for the deal). Besides, as I already mentioned, we would've spent another $50 at least on drinks and sushi. I have called Living Social and have received a refund. WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION. Although the hostess and waitress are mildly at fault (They had my phone number for a LONG time, they should have called me BEFORE we drove 25 minutes if there was a problem). This was the most extremely poor management example I have ever witnessed, and that needs to be addressed.

They have some nice specialty cocktails -- My preference was the Lychee Martini. Very cool and refreshing. The sushi was good, as were the stuffed mushrooms. Their garden patio area is a great place to sit back and relax, while the high top bar tables were better for moving around and socializing. The fact that the bar area opens to the garden patio gives it a nice open feel, even when crowded. One of the best parts was no over-loud music, so we could actually hear each other.

Swanky interior, friendly service, and a diverse menu: hibachi and sushi items available, in addition to tapas. This place almost has too much going on. Even the layout has patio, bar and lounge seating, plus gigantic booths, hibachi grill table seating, the sushi bar, and a pit of ""regular"" tables too.

Ordered exclusively from the HH menu: spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were surprisingly large, yellowtail carpaccio was a small portion of thin-cut fish with nearly no flavor whatsoever- overpriced even with the discount, baked mussels were tasty, but the wagyu sliders and stuffed mushrooms were the stars. Considering their marketing, I'm not sure it's surprising that their most Americanized options were the ones that actually seemed to have more effort put into them but YMMV.

Did not have the lackluster service others have mentioned- our server was polite and despite having the entire bar area to herself, she was mostly attentive.

I don't want to know of any problems when I've decided to come to your restaurant as a paying customer. Run a tight ship!  I don't want to hear it!)

6.  Want a free dessert offered by same incompetent manager, as a courtesy for taking sooooo long. This AFTER she was told TWICE we can't do dessert, because the kids have to go to bed. 
7.  Love having a wait staff that doesn't understand the importance of getting kids in and out.

The positive: I love the way this place is set up. The decor is awesome and the sushi is quite unique (and in a good way). My favorite has to be the banana roll. The fish is placed upon fried banana slices. At first I was a little skeptical, but after taking the first bite I was hooked. Christine always orders the Mandingo. Without getting too graphic the roll is shaped like a certain body part of a man, complete with boys lol. Ain't gonna lie, it's an awesome roll, but fellas make sure you have a girl order for you. Unfortunately that's about as much as I can say about the positive aspect.
The negative: at times they have events there and when they do they blast music like it's a damn club. It's really hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you're in the middle of XS. On top of it, this place has had 4-5 different ""grand opening."" How many grand openings can one place have? The service is hit or miss at times, and I have had items never arrive to my table but they sure as heck showed up on my bill. 
Overall there are better places for sushi, but I probably be back again because they do offer naked sushi and that is something I would like to experience.",ro8lGoWMsa49B3tWLaWwSA,3,0,3,iSQn3iITXxMjL2dhycGEow

I said it was fine, and asked if we could be seated.  She then said we might have to be seated separately, and I was under the impression that a reservation of 25 was made so there should be a reserved table for 25 guests.

Only disappointing fact was we had made reservations for the teppan table and after waiting for 20 minutes (in the lobby) we were told it would be another 30 minutes because they were behind and one cook had called in. We asked realistically how long would it really be and after the hostess told us there were still 3 tables the cook needed to attend to before he would get to the table we would be at, we decided to just sit at the regular dining table.

-Double D. Inside: Shrimp Tempura, Crab, Cucumber. Outside: Spicy Salmon, Avocado, Screaming Orgasm Sauce. (Very very delicious and flavorful.)

It's great they had a Groupon deal. Otherwise, I would've never known about this place. Also...be sure to check-in to this place with your Yelp App because you get a free order of mochi ice cream.

My Family usually celebrates someone's birthday here. So much so, it's been somewhat of a tradition every year. Mine seems to be every two years. This year we came here for my Mother's 21 birthday bash celebration. I adore the kimonos that the hostess wore. It's elegant, yet sexy. Nice touch to bring back the  traditional Japanese dress. 

We were greeted by a smiling, friendly hostess that took us to our teppan table as soon as we walked in. Our server Lu? came by and took our drink orders. We all opt for their Geisha Special. My brother and I substituted the chicken with scallops. My uncle substituted the chicken with salmon. Both for an additional charge, which wasn't that much at all.

All Dinners Include: Soup, Salad, Hibachi Shrimp, Mushroom, Onions, Zucchini, Bean Sprouts and Fried Rice. And with the GEISHA SPECIAL, it Include: Choice of Appetizer (Shrimp Tempura, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura or Egg Roll) Choice of Drinks (Small Sake, House Wine or Soft Drink) Entrees : FILET MIGNON, CHICKEN AND LOBSTER. You just can't beat this combination deal. 

All the tables that occupied the teppan grill were celebrating a birthday. I can see why though. The Teppan Chefs here have a witty personality, love making food jokes plus tricks, even turning it up with a blue flashing light to make some boombox beats with their spatulas. Whaaat?! We were fortunate to have Chef Don as our Teppan Chef for this evening. He had this chill locomotion energy about himself that we enjoyed interacting with. He made jokes and tricks with our meals.. don't want to spoil the fun for anyone, but I thought the smiling face to cute dog was adorable. The best part of this experience was when he turned the blue flashing light on. He looked at my Mom and told her.. Come on stand up.. stand up.. stand up! My Mom looked stunned. Then he proceeded with come on.. stand up.. you gotta dance!!! You're the Birthday Girl!!! And next thing I knew, my Mom actually got up and started shakin her salt shaker! Chef Don started making some boombox beats with his spatulas and we were all having a blast. Tears of laughter was all around our table. The most memorable, yet fun time we ever had dining here. I even got that on video ;) 

The highlights I enjoyed here were the Tempura Shrimp and Vegetable combo, Fried Rice, huge juicy Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Lobster. Love their dipping sauces! Just remember the creamy orange sherbet color is for the meat, the middle is for the seafood, and the dark brown transparent color is for your veggies. The middle sauce has some wasabi or horseradish in it.. you'll taste that kick, so be ready for it! That creamy sauce for the meat is delicious. It enhances the flavor and takes it to another level. I wish I can duplicate this sauce for all my meat indulgence! 

The service was great in refills of drinks ( I drank 3 ginger ales!!! Could have been 5, but refused to have more! ), needing anything else, to taking away any finished plates. Quite observant throughout our whole dining experience. This place seems to attract Families, Friends get together, and Group outings.

2999484,2014-05-16,2,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"Quick Look: Average Sushi and Sub-Par Service. 

In Depth Review: Made the 20+ minute drive from the other side of the valley to try a ""new"" place on Thursday, May 15th.  We arrived at 7:30pm and were greeted by a lovely Geisha and seated at a nice table on the patio. Was surprised how empty the massive space was. The busiest part was the bar and patio area. It was a younger looking, ""happy hour"" type crowd. 

After being seated by a nice little waterfall feature we were handed multiple different sized menus w/o and explanation as to what they were all about. Was a bit confusing. We sat at that table for a few minutes w/o being greeted or being offered water or having our drink order taken. A male waiter shows up and asks if our waitress has stopped by the table yet, we say ""no"" and he say's he will take our drink order. After he departs with the order a female waitress shows up and asks if she can now take our drink order. Huh? We got a signature Ginger Mojito and a Sake Sangria (made with cucumbers). Drinks were delicious although my hand was sticky from the spillage on the outside of my glass. 

Asked the female waitress what ""specials"" they had that day and she could not answer me. Had to leave to check on the specials and come back and tell me. This is a big restaurant so it's not like this just took a minute, a few minutes would pass so she could walk all the way to the kitchen. 

So we place our order - (salmon sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, Japanese lasagna roll, spicy tuna roll and the special that included steak, scallops and tuna over a bed of lettuce in an ""orgasm"" sauce). I had initially attempted to order a few fish items listed on the menu and was told they were not available (example: amber-jack). Asked for at least three different items and was shot down. That's confusing, remove them if not available & place the specials somewhere the customer can see them. 

Food starts to arrive all at once, bad timing. I like my sushi restaurants to time the plates so that they are not all sitting in front of me. Tuna sashimi was ""fishy"" and my wife refused to eat it after the first bite. All the sashimi pieces lacked that fresh fish ""snap"" I find at the better sushi restaurants in the city. On a positive note they do give generous pieces of fish at a good price. 

The sushi rolls certainly looked nice when they arrived. The rice was hard and not the soft, sticky rice you will find at a fancy sushi house (Yellowtail, Nobu). The hard rice caused my nice looking sushi rolls to fall apart when I tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. Rice tasted like the low budget stuff you buy in bulk at a warehouse like Sam's Club. The special that day was steak, scallops and tuna over lettuce in an orgasm sauce. Was presented well, a huge portion but was given a plate full of the hard heel pieces of the lettuce that nobody eats & the steak was overcooked and tough like leather. The Japanese Lasagna roll was the tastiest item we had, certainly recommend that item. 

As we finished the items and pushed our dirty plates to the other side of the table, nobody came to remove the dirty plates. They just sat there, obviously empty, as multiple employees (and managers) walked by the table and never removed them. The removal of the dirty plates seemed to be an issue as our waitress went to get the check, took our credit card and cashed us out all while the dirty plates still sat on the table in front of us. I finally asked a busboy to remove them and let him know they had been sitting there 20+ minutes. He was going to walk by the table w/o removing them when I stopped him. He apologized & blamed the dish removal on the bar staff. 

Had other service related issues while we were dining, like: a runner showing up and dropping off a plate meant for our neighbors at another table, waitress forgetting to come and take our drink order when she said she would: ""be right back,"" waiter grabbing drink order and forgetting to put the drink order in, two drinks showing up when it should have been just one - etc. Just seemed like they had a lot of service related issues. Got a very amateur vibe & the two of us were spun with all the errors & lack of service over site. Think some additional training is necessary and that goes for whomever is leading this confused group. 

Summary: was not worth the long drive and too be honest, we were a bit disappointed. The mediocre plates may have been over looked if the service was top-notch? Too much confusion going on here. Beautiful restaurant and space. Hopefully management & the owners take notice and bring this place up to par with the fine sushi establishments in the city. You have great potential w/ that location!",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,5,2,2,9ML1rTSuHW5hYzOZRAvxKA

The hibachi chef was seriously amazing and really went out of his way to make sure I had everything I could need and want. My boyfriend and I split the meal and they do charge an additional 11.95  for the extra soup and salad. There wasn't a very large wine list by the glass, however what I did try, was very good and fairly priced. The cocktail menu was interesting. We ordered the coconut goblet as well. Not very good or strong, for the price. We put an extra shot in it and that helped. They did free birthday ice cream for my cousin which was awesome and they also allow each person to check In for the mochi on yelp... So heads up! The only down fall was happy hour was only at the bar and patio, and even though we were doing hibachi, there was a few rolls and appetizers we would of liked to try. My cousin was under 21 and wasn't allowed in the bar area even before our reservation. Maybe a little more accommodation for that woulda earned them five stars. Either way, I'll definitely be back.

We got the ""I Don't Want It"" and I think the spider rolls. 
Well I really liked the interior and so I assumed the service would be excellent. It was okay. There was one man who helped us the whole time but after a little while, it was like he forgot about us so we had to wait a bit for the check. Anyways, my first experience was like around 4 stars because the honey toast was amazingggg
Recently when I came, it was for dinner before prom. This was a couple weeks ago on a Saturday, an hour after they had opened. There was only the four of us and we all don't demand much at restaurants anyways so it shouldn't have been weird as it was that day. 
To begin with, my friend and her date ordered something from the main menu but three times ordering, the waitress tells them that whatever they ordered no longer existed on the menu. 
Really? Three different menu items? Out? 
Well my friend's date got kind of frustrated so he ordered the pork tonkatsu but they were out of that so he went with the chicken tonkatsu. 
For my date and I, we ordered the P.I.M.P, the Hulk, the Spider rolls, the Harujuku girls, and the Creamy Horse. But then I forgot that I ordered the creamy horse and told them I didn't order it and at the same time, they accidentally made a second plate of the Harujuku girls rolls which made me more confused. 
I thought it was someone else's order but there was one family and they were at the hibachi. Anyways, the waitress was irritated with us at this point and so we just took the rolls and just ate what we could. 
Then another man came to constantly check up on us afterwards and I liked him way more. The waitress just kind of seemed like she wanted to avoid our table so once again, took a little while to get the check. 
I mean the food is very good but service is inconsistent and some of employees just don't seem to have the patience.

My girlfriends wanted to do a cute little happy hour date and we wanted to pick a spot that we all have never been before. This place was suggested.. Upon arrival we waited in the front for about 8 minutes to not be acknowledged. That was the first strike. I had to walk to the back where the bar area is located to ask for some service. Anyways we were told we can be seated wherever we wanted because the happy hour is in the bar area. The ambiance of the place is great I will give them that much. Nice big red couches and some high table tops. No complaints there. Once we found a nice spot we were ready to order! I took a peek at the menu prior to arriving so I had a good idea of what I already wanted. The first round of drinks were great, however the fact that it took approximately 15 minutes for a drink to arrive is unacceptable in my eyes. They weren't busy at ALL so I couldn't understand why 1 drink was taking as long as it was. I asked our server what the problem was and he had no answer other than it's being made? Oh yeah? hmm okay well.. I have never been to a place where the FOOD comes before the drinks? Super annoying! I could see the table out on the patio must've had an issue last night as well because of the commotion that was going on when the manager approached them. All in all I may or may not return.. Food was great but the service was terrible. Having knowledgeable staff is crucial in the restaurant business. I asked about the coconut shrimp on the happy hour menu and questioned how many they came with. The server said oh it comes with 4 and then they came out with 3 and his explanation was ""oh because they are big so they only gave you 3"" well I sent them back because that's ridiculous. The free mochi desert that comes with the check in was okay. There were 3 of us and two of us got the mochi cut into 4 pieces with toothpicks and one of us it was cut in half with no toothpick so I guess they assumed my friend was suppose to use her hands?

Our first impression upon entering the restaurant was that it was really clean, and super modern looking. I kinda got the feeling of entering a nightclub/lounge but when we walked by the lounge area, the grills could all be seen along the one end of the restaurant. 

The grills themselves had a pretty cool view of the restaurant and the bar, kinda overlooking it. Also, there was a huuuuuge projection of the dodgers game being played.

The food was great... We both got their geisha house special which included shrimp, lobster, chicken, and filet mignon steak. It also included soup, salad, fried rice, and a free drink or sake. The fried rice tasted a bit bland to me, but overall I was satisfied with everything.

We came here with two other couples for my husband's birthday on a Saturday evening, 5 o'clock. There wasn't a wait for a table, but we spent 25 minutes in between ordering and when the chef came to our table. 

I'm pretty sure the chef we had was newer to the game, he dropped untensils on the floor, threw an oil-covered egg at our pregnant friend and threw rice all over the place while cooking. My scallops were crazy over-cooked and rubbery, to the point where I didn't eat them, and the rice was meh. 

The strangest thing is that he put this 'special sauce' on everything. The 'special sauce' was in a bowl, it was a fuchsia pasty substance that looked like bubble-gum flavored butter. It smelled of garlic, but he wouldn't tell us what was in it. This stuff went on E V E R Y T H I N G. It turned the fried rice pink, as well as my scallops, the shrimp, lobster, filet Mignon, strip steak and chicken. He even doused the tofu with it. 

I'm not a fan of fuchsia-colored, overcooked scallops.

The sushi was phenomenal. I got the dragon roll which was a California roll topped with eel and avocado and dressed with eel sauce. Holy yum. I didn't want to stop eating it. So fresh, absolutely delicious.

I'm extremely picky with Japanese cuisine partially because I am Japanese and grew up in Japan. I do not like fusion Japanese food and still trying to figure out why it even exist. What makes Japanese food so good is its simplicity, so why add unnecessary touches? 

Service was alright. We've had multiple servers serving us. Our main server was out of place in my opinion. Dim lighting with hip ratchet playlist added to a night club vibe yet somewhat intimate. This lady kept walking back and forth like she was on crack and talked to us with so much excitement. I don't mind seeing a server like that at Pancake House or Egg works, but definitely not a dine-in restaurant with intimate vibe. No thanks. 

After perusing through the menu, we went with 12pc sashimi set as well as fat boy. Got a kiwi martini (?) on the side to start off and that was refreshing and good. 

Despite the fact that we were the only one there, food took a good 20-25mins to arrive. 12pc sashimi was the first to arrive to the table. All sashimi had a thick and generous cut and tasted fresh. Of course while we are enjoying the sashimi, lady on crack walks back and forth to tell us ""Hi, so your fat boy is coming soon. Like 5 mins."" Then comes back few minutes later, ""It will take like 3 mins."" ...leave us alone holy cow.

Finally, fat boy comes to the table. 8 tiny pieces of greasy mess. Initially I wanted to try more fusion roll but looking at the menu, all rolls comes with either cream cheese (which I don't like in sushi) or spicy sauce (I can't handle spice). Fat boy was the only acceptable choice for me even though it had cream cheese in it. My reaction was just ""meh"".....I was once again reminded on why I don't like fusion rolls. 

Considering they are a steakhouse, I should have tried their teppanyaki instead of sushi to fully enjoy what they had to offer. However, they are also called the sushi bar and they are less than mediocre in that department.

I really loved Sapporos and was afraid to even go here for fear that it would start the grieving process all over, but Geisha House was good enough to make me forget about Sapporo.  Although this place still looks a lot like Sapporos, there are 12 teppanyaki tables, 2 of which are in VIP and 2 of which are outside.  

There were 5 of us and everyone really enjoyed their food.  I split the Sealover Special - scallops, lobster and shrimp complete with salad, soup, entrée and a free drink - wine, soft drink or sake.  For $39.95, it's a steal of a deal.  I also had the 90% sushi roll and was very impressed.  Service was a little iffy, but the chef and a helpful server (Harrison, I think) tried to smooth out the rough patches.  The chef was probably one of the more entertaining chefs I've ever had.

The visuals were amazing, and the taste was even better. There was so much food that neither of us were even able to finish either entrees. I'd deem the price worthy of the portion and the taste really worth the money. Overall our experience was great; food, interior/atmosphere. I'll post pictures of the entrees along with the review so that you can see what I'm talking about.",8ZSUUAH4Hb2JKaw0yqNSPQ,2,0,5,92IGjEbN82gw9BDGVZhFwA

1st experience was opening night which is excusable although it took the server 30 mins to even ask if we wanted something to drink. 

So hey we thought we would give it another shot almost a year later. Nothing has changed. 

our server abandoned us mid way through our meal near the bar (seated on the patio) without any warning. He went back behind the bar and proceeded to help the customers while leaving us . 

We had to constantly flag down other staff and eventually had to walk up to the bar multiple times to get the attention of other staff. 

They brought us another tables food then proceeded to take 25 mins per check back on the table. We were there nearly 2 hours and finally frustrated left still  hungry. 

Bottom line : terrible service which is inexcusable in las vegas

When I paid for my meal I went up to the bar to get my check because I waited 25 mins for a check the original server actually came up to me and asked if I needed help. I responded that we could have used your help earlier since you were our original server. He didnt respond but (probably caught off guard) instead turned his back on me and walked away, I found this extremely rude.",eymOC7kyAmCWSciXWRncfw,3,0,1,zBuUnfJOEZkpExHIxKlGiQ

For appetizers, I had the Blue Fin Tuna, which was fantastic and wifey had the veggie tempura, very well done and crispy. Our friend decided she wanted a martini for an appetizer, she said it was spot on. For mains, I had their 12 piece sushi dinner, everything was fresh, well made and delicious. Wifey stuck with the tempura, the Pork Belly skewers and crispy Won Ton  appetizers. Our friend had the Lamb Lollipops, these were great as well.

On both counts we ordered the Geisha combination. Both had polite chefs, the first one more chattery than the last. The volcano tower fire rising from the onions trick gets me every time and would always amuse my family as well. 

We ordered an array of sashimi and sushi rolls, mostly on the spicy side since my dad likes spicy rolls even when my mom would interject a few times that she can't handle it. I wish they had more choices for nigiri like salmon belly or cajun albacore or yuzu-infused scallop.

In the end, my brother was satisfied with most if the teppanyaki meats served to him as well as the fried rice. My mother was overjoyed with the flavorful desserts and being entertained by the chefs.

The hostess greeted us and we explained that we had never been there before. She said ""It's like Benihana"". (I wanted to laugh but refrained.) We said that we would give the Hibachi a try. She explained that it would be 15-20 minutes because there were only 2 chefs working and they both had just started their tables. She said that the bar was having a Happy Hour and they had sushi specials so we decided to give it a try. 

The atmosphere in the bar was cozy, airy and elegant. We opted for a couch and were promptly greeted with a stack of menus. We started with the Pork Gyoza ($5) which were delicious and paired beautifully with our drinks - Saki Ginger Mojito and Japanese Mule. The only negative for me was the sauce...it was a little too heavy and sweet for me. I would have preferred a light Ponzu. 

We then ordered 2 different Specialty Sushi Rolls (30% off during Happy Hour) with Spicy Shrimp, Scallops and Soft Shelled Crab - both delicious!  My only complaint is that we asked for brown rice and were told, ""I think we ran out last night and I don't know if they made any more today"". 

Our server (Crystal) and the bartender were nice and attentive. We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in special - Free Mochi Dessert. We opted for Strawberry (they also had Mango and Green Tea) and loved it!

We told the server we just wanted a bottle of sake , and instead of helping us she then walked away. Then a different server came over, got us our sake and we asked him the market price of the sweet shrimp and tuna belly , which he basically looked at us like we had two heads and we had to show him where these things were on the menu, then he left and came back with the prices . We proceed to order , which included a miso soup, which never came. And when we told our server at the end of the meal we never received our soup he then brought us 2 , which tasted like water , when we told our server the soup was off , he then informed us that the miso soup comes from a machine so he will make sure to take a look at it .

First impressions show a well decorated swanky restaurant. The menu is small, although catered to hibachi, and the sushi menu leaves much to be desired. 

We had a party of nine sitting at the hibachi table, and while the chef was awesome and his personality made the experience a ton of fun, our actual server didn't even deserve her title. 90% of the time there were at least six empty drinks on the table. In a empty restaurant with MAYBE four other tables and plenty of servers, she had nothing but time on her hands to fill up our glasses. She didn't even have to actually bring out our food so what else would she possibly be occupied with that she neglected to give us proper service?
I finally talked to a manager and asked for him to fill our glasses, and told him the problems we were having. Unbeknownst to me, our lovely waitress had dropped our check off kindly letting us know the gratuity was already included. Mind you, we were in no rush, and hadn't even been asked if we would like dessert (which we all did). Again I talked to the manager, with him apologizing the whole time. Our waitress brought out dessert menus with an attitude, again neglecting to fill up our empty glasses. 
Long story short, after three hours of dinner, my water and tea were left empty for most of the night even after asking multiple times. The manager was no help, and obviously didn't really care about the service his resultant was giving. I have never been more disappointed and will NEVER go back again.

I have had other experiences at other locations when we had smaller parties and they would not let us sit until our entire party was there!

Another time I made a reservation and when I got there they did not have a reservation for me and they told us we could wait an hour to seat 8 people because they couldn't seat us all even though the place was practically empty!
Another time they told us they couldn't seat us at a tappan table because some of us wanted to order sushi and we are only allowed to sit there if we order tappan. Learn how to run a resteraunt people!!",AA7fnB-_1Giob2skg5wu6Q,0,0,1,sagBO4LX5vdwDtIOVNbRgA

We had our son with us and he was getting fussy and all the wait staff kept looking at us like can you leave already.. then they brought us our food and we asked for To-go boxes because our son was getting ready to scream and they acted upset that we wanted to leave after waiting 30 minutes to even get our food. Our waitress only came to our table once and we had to ask the bus boy to get her for our bill..finally after we got home and opened our food my food was undercooked and the waitress didn't correctly describe the vegetables that came with it..  needless to say we won't be going back..,Z0M_eHn-7vvFH9GeHFiP9w,1,0,2,o26fI87CO8PBptSBAttS3Q

Right now they don't have a solid sushi happy hour menu. I guess they are revamping their Happy Hour...sooooo everything inside the sushi menu is 30% off!!!! Agggghhhhhhh! My eyes lit up like a kid in the candy store!!! I got a chance to taste just about every roll on that menu and they're all great! We've yet to try out Teppanyaki here.

4920494,2013-10-23,2,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"I decided to treat Soralala to dinner for her birthday but when we got to Geisha House around 10:30 we found out the dining room had just closed.. aww no probs because their bar/lounge/patio area is pretty nice.. actually their whole restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing! We chose to sit in a cute little love seat and were greeted by the pretty bartender, Marissa.. We were then told that after 10:30 only the Happy Hour menu is available.. another bummer but not a big deal because their HH has a handful of light bites and yummy dranks which is what we were looking to do anyways.
The general manager, Christian, then came over to us and checked our IDs and realized it was Sora's birthday and convinced us to move to the bar and enjoy a round of shots on him ;]]] 

We tried a lot of yummy items:
- Pork belly skewers: Sora really liked these! They come with 3-4 little pieces of pork belly accompanied by a couple pearl onions. They did not quite melt in your mouth but they packed good flavor.
- Mixed tempura: Came with like 3 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of veggies. Was not oily and stayed crunchy.
-Lamb Lollipops: Came with 2 pieces. I enjoyed these.. they were not overly gamey at all. However, Sora thought they were a bit over-cooked. 
-Something's Wrong Roll: I would have liked this one better if it was not deep-fried.
- Salmon Carpaccio: SO SO SO SO GOOD! The salmon was so buttery and fresh. Plus it comes with pretty edible flowers that have a citrus taste to them. Best part is that dish is only $5 on their HH.

-Lychee Martini: Marissa made this one so DELISH. Not overly sweet and the pretty edible flower finishes it off so well! 
-Ginger Sake Mojito: Excellent twist on the mojito! Lots of fresh mint leaves!
-Geisha Blessing: beautiful green colored rum cocktail topped with thick whipped cream... meant to drink without a straw so that the flavors compliment each other.. sure to give you a cute creamstache lol
-Cucumber cocktail: OMG to die. so refreshing!!! Definitely our fav of the night!
-Bubble-wrap cocktail: Featured on the Las Vegas Weekly and Seven Magazine. Very creative cocktail.. Something in the ingredients causes the cocktail to start to bubble and resemble bubble-wrap. Fun drink, comes in a huge glass.. Tastes like creamy coconut milk~ 
-Shots: They have a full bar so we also had some Vegas Bomb Shots and Sora requested a special shot and they had no problem following her directions and whipping it out for us. 

This location just opened so it was pretty empty when we got there.. But Marissa and Christian were very friendly and kept us company. As you can see, by the time we left we were quite happy and satisfied. I can't wait to go back for another Happy Hour session and also to check out their main dining room! 

HOT TIP: Ask for the GM, Christian, to show you his flair bartending tricks... he's amazing! Also, they host many special themed events in their lounge where they have a DJ and hookah.. such as Latin nights and Naked Sushi... They even do comped bottles for groups of ladies ;]]]",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,4,3,5,gAWeaSPSZuMxV4jkEIx-Kw

My friend and I came in at 6 pm on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress offered us their special roll of the night. The way she described it made it sound awesome so we went with it. We also ordered the lamb lollipops, edamame, shrimp tempura crunch roll, and the crab stuffed mushrooms. 

The special roll wasn't that special to us, it was more like a dud. It didn't have a lot of flavor and the sauce that accompanied it did not help. The fish used for it wasn't that great either. The lamb lollipops seemed a bit too fatty. Every bite was extremely chewy and consisted of fat so it wasn't that appealing while eating it. The bed of stringed carrots underneath the lamb lollipops did not taste so good either. Our favorites were the shrimp tempura crunch roll and the stuffed mushrooms. Both excellent in flavor and texture! It was also kind of strange that our sushi dishes did not come with any ginger and wasabi. When I requested for it the waitress just brought me back a bowl of pickled wasabi. Something I'm not so familiar with. I tried it and wasn't too fond of it. 

The staff was great overall. Our busser was most attentive, always coming by asking if we wanted our glasses refilled and if plates needed to be taken away. We were also given free mochi for checking in on yelp which is pretty sweet. My friend and I were considering going to the happy hour since they appear to have awesome deals, but this location is quite a drive from us since we live all the way in boulder city.

It is our first try since moving to vegas. The biggest issue I had was they did not introduce enough favors to the rice, not sure exactly what it was missing but it just wasn't as good as I remember elsewhere. I was also not thrilled with the vegetable selection, my favorite is the zucchini and I got hardly any on my plate. The price is quite steep, but that is commonplace at establishments like this.

5070892,2015-01-19,0,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"If someone from your restaurant actually reads these reviews, well you better sit down....

We live just down the street and the 3 or 4 of us in my family comes here every couple of weeks, and you have gotten worse each and every time!

Salad - So let's see, your salad is small, wilted and the tomatoes were actually frozen on 2 of our salads.  It appears the salads are prepped and frozen WITH the dressing already on it.  

Combination Tempura - Your combination tempura used to have nice good size pieces of shrimp (usually 2 or 3 pieces), now they are small, you used to have broccoli, or sweet potato or even carrot, not you're using string beans and bok choy and 3 out of the 4 of us couldn't even eat the boy choy it was so stringy like celery.  REALLY???? You're that damm cheap???

Hibachi - Talk about a small piece of chicken.  I think that chicken breast was 2 MAYBE 3 ounces.  I get bigger and more chicken at kfc for their $5 buck lunch! No I'm not over reacting either.

Vegetable, I remember going to hibachi restaurants for years that half your plate was full of nice big pieces of sliced vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, onions etc) including bean sprouts. Now it's about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of vegetables per person. Um hey guys, vegetables are cheap and they're good for you. You don't have to be stingy!!

Rice - FINALLY something GREAT.  The rice here is wonderful, no doubt about it.  But wait.. $35+ for the geisha special and the only great thing is RICE??? Definitely something wrong with this..

Hibachi Show - The show is VERY hit and miss each visit and we saw every chef   do different things, some didn't even do anything except cook, nothin special or anything.  

Inappropriate - During your fire show, most of the chefs use a little squeeze water boy that pees out the fire with water.  As an adult, it's cute, funny. I love it.  Most times there are families and kids at the table and YES this is inappropriate, especially if you're a family restaurant.

Total bill $178 for 4 people (we all had the sea special) 

2 days later, I came back in for Happy Hour with a Groupon.  I've never had your sushi before or Happy Hour and that's why I bought the groupon. The value was for $30.  I sat down at the bar by myself showed the bartender/server my groupon and made sure everything was going to be ok. She said I have to have 2 people. I asked why?? It doesn't change anything, the groupon has a set value for $30. What does it matter who's mouth the food goes into? It doesn't change the value!!!  She told me again that's just the way it is. I told her she needs to get a manager then because that makes no sense and I was just in here 2 days ago and spent $178 ...
She said the manager will allow it this time.. (I looked around and the place MAYBE had 15-20 people in there.  Glad to see the manager made a good decision and allowed it and didn't lose my business that evening.  

I ordered a variety of rolls. They were fine, nothin great by any means and definitely NOT ever worth the price they are asking for their sushi either!!!  $7 for a shrimp tempura roll, $15+ for specialty rolls. Um there are a TON of really great all you can eat sushi bars all over the city, Your sushi menu/prices are not at all worth it. 

So... I heard that Kanji just down the street took over the old Geisha location on ft apache between russell and sunset and they are getting great reviews on their hibachi oh AND they have All you can eat sushi AND they are getting great reviews.

My next visit will be to Kanji to try them out.  If their fried rice is good too (which people seem to be enjoying over there) I will no longer go back to Geisha (not even for a to go order of yummy fried rice).  Sorry Geisha you are going down hill and are getting cheap, stingy and over priced for the quality/amount of food and lack of service.

5266980,2013-07-29,1,coBLz73uWQp1gbMQGkvM3g,"Yahoo!!!! Finally a Japanese restaurant that is not located on the strip and made for locals! I went to the opening of Geisha Steakhouse with my friends to see what this place is all about and we were so impressed! I will get the point on this review on why this place deserved the 5 star!

1. The decor of Geisha reminds me of a high end strip restaurant... the exotic decorations... contemporary and chic.... huge LED/LCD screens... excellent music.... okay i know i can go on but you get the point. Perfect place for a night out with the girls or on a date!!!!

2. The food and cocktails are so amazing!!! We started off by ordering the Geisha Bliss and Kiwi-licious. The Geisha Bliss is a must have because it has this coconut foam on top that blends so well with the rest of the cocktail. The Kiwi-licious is just like how it sounds... real kiwi and so ono-delicious :) 
 
For food we ordered the salmon and hamachi sushi. You can see in the pic i posted how fresh the fish tasted. We also ordered the shishito peppers, egg rolls, and beef carpaccio. 

For entrees we all tried to order different dishes so we can try a bit of everything, we ordered the scallops, braised pork belly, fresh halibut, and braised short rib. While everything was spectacular, the best dish was the braised short rib... .it tasted just like the dish from SHIBUYA @ MGM.... OMG it was so good!!!! the sauce accompanied with the puree of potatoes was fabulous! 

For dessert, we ordered the peach cobbler/pie. It was a layer of fanned out fresh peaches stacked with i think filo dough and topped with whipped cream and fresh berries (you can see in the pic). Everything was so so so good. 

3. Service was fantastic, everyone was very knowledgeable on the best dishes and cocktails. 

I live on the other side of town in Henderson, but if i could i would go there after work for a cocktail and tapas. They are running awesome specials for the locals on their tapas so if its your first time you can try a bit of everything :) For my fellow Yelpers, like their facebook page and you can see their updates on specials!!!

Good job Geisha, I'll be back!!!!",dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,10,1,5,-aVuz78cCfV52iMnMSooRg

As for the teppanyaki, I thought it was a rather average experience. Essentially you're paying $20 for a plate of mediocre vegetable fry rice that some chef made in front of you. And what's up with the pink paste that they used to fry the rice with? It made everything pink and unpleasant looking. You're better off spending the money on something else here.

If I ever come back here, it would be for the drinks and sushi only.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,5,4,3,Pu2XWZrghMyMVXlJSFDZ0Q

I was thinking,"" Well, it must be good then if it's this much.""  We gave it about 20 minutes and left to be on our way to pick it up, which then made it about 30 minutes from the time I placed the order. When I got there, the hostess said she accidentally forgot the put the order in and it was going to be about another 20 minutes or so unless she asked the cooks to please rush it. It didn't look slammed in the restaurant either, being early on a Tuesday night.  Despite my better judgement, I paid the ticket, added a more than 10% tip because I felt bad if I didn't leave anything, and went out to to tell my husband. I called back and spoke to someone else and asked if he could please pass on to tell the hostess to call my number when the food was ready. We drove around with our 2 year old for 20 minutes and finally went back inside. She went back to get the food, brought it out like nothing had happened. I asked if the food had been sitting long (since I didn't get a phone call saying it was ready when she knew we would be driving around), and she said, ""Nope it wasn't waiting long, it's still hot."" Well how long had it been ready for? The food is good, but I think it was WAY overpriced to pay $100 for that. We should have cancelled the order and went somewhere else. If the order would have been forgotten when dining in, we would have had some sort of apology from the manager or something comped as kind gesture for their Fk-up. Apparently when it happens when you place an order to-go, it doesn't apply. I don't think we will come here again, which is a shame.

Atmosphere:  I was greeted by friendly hostesses that were dressed in authentic geisha kimonos. Cool, trendy, sleek decor with great music. I came here with my boyfriend and dined inside the restaurant, but they have a beautiful patio setting that I will definetly take advantage of the next time I visit. This is the perfect place to bring a date to, or even for a classy dinner for the family. 

Food: The sushi was immaculate. The fish was extremely fresh and vibrant. Their ponzu sauce is delicious! It's been a long time since I've had the privilege to taste this quality of sushi. With the entire town flooded with ayce sushi restaurants, it's been nearly impossible for me to find a sushi restaurant that prefers quality over quantity. My boyfriend tried the braised short ribs which he described as melt in your mouth delicious. The Serrano hamachi dish was very inventive. This is usually one of my favorite dishes, but I've never seen it made with yuzu foam which made it outshine all the other places I've tried it at. We also had the lamb pops for an appetizer, and we had to order an extra order because my boyfriend loved it so much. All the dishes were tantalizing to the taste buds.

Service: Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient with our questions, and trust me we had a lot of them to answer. I don't know much about sake, but I wanted to try something new. The server gave me a quick 101 on the different sakes available which made it much easier for me to decide from. The managers came by and checked on us to make sure we had a good experience, which was really nice to see that everyone was eager to serve us well. Most of the things we ordered were recommendations from the server, and I'm glad she was so informative about the dishes. She also served us ginger coffee chocolates at the end of our meal that was complimentary. A perfect ending to a perfect meal.

Price: With the decor and presentation of the food, I would imagine the dishes would be quite pricey. However, that was not the case at all. Extremely affordable prices that I would actually pay double for, but I was glad to be able to enjoy everything for such a great price. 

Great job GEISHA HOUSE! I will be a returning customer for sure!",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,5,1,5,y-yzhv1itTmtJRWMTWowBQ

We arrived around 6:15 with enough time to order a couple drinks and order a couple different items from the happy hour menu before it ended at 6:30. As soon as we sat down, I asked the bartender if we needed to put in our order right away since happy hour was ending in 15 min. He made a sarcastic joke about ""gotta put it in now!"" and then walked away to get our drinks. The bartender brought our glasses of wine rather quickly but never took our food order! By the time he lapped around the empty bar, we tried to order and he informed us it was now after 6:30 and we would not get the happy hour prices because the chefs watch the time and they won't honor it. This immediately put me in a sour mood because we had been waiting to place our order for 10 min! Since we now had to pay full price for our food, we asked the nice hostess to seat us at a table. The atmosphere is really nice! Our table was nice and spacious for a 4 top and it was neat watching the hibachi tables. However, our server was TERRIBLE! He walked by multiple time and took forever to greet us. When he finally did greet us, we asked multiple times for an extra paper order sheet to place additional orders, (which we never got), he spoke so low we couldn't understand him, and seemed very unsure about how to take an order. We ordered a variety of food: gyoza (good but I've had better at other sushi joints), the Hawaiian roll, Love roll, and Secret from my Husband. The sushi was nothing to write home about so we decided to try something completely different. We ordered the jalapeno cracker, and it was not good! Tasted like a grilled tuna fish sandwich with jalapenos! Our server never asked if we wanted another glass of wine, while our glasses sat empty, but was quick to fill our waters and clear our plates. He never offered dessert, which we would have ordered because we were still hungry, and took another 20 minutes to finally bring the check. Thank god we had a groupon because I would have been really upset to have paid full price. Having worked in the service industry for over 15 years, I understand the hardships of opening a new restaurant. However, making sure your staff is fully prepared is key.

I thought the portions were simply way too much for one person to finish. I could barely finish half of the rice, and I had a ton of leftover seafood and meat as well. Perhaps it might be a good idea for them to lower the price a little and adjust the portions to something more realistic. 
Since the portions are huge, the price isn't that friendly either. Don't get me wrong though, for how much they give you the price is good. However, it isn't that easy to order only 1 portion for 2 people for tepanyaki. 
The server was nice but a little awkward I felt like. For instance, we had beer and cocktail from the bar and we had to switched tables since we were getting tepanyaki. The server came to us to direct us to our tables. I thought she would either help us bring the drinks, or let us know that she will bring it for us later. Instead, we had to awkwardly carry the drinks ourselves (and we had 2 for each person) carefully across the restaurant. Only when we got to the new table did she recognize how carefully we were carrying the cups and asked us if we needed help.

ATMOSPHERE: We came in right when dinner service was about to start, so the place was basically empty.  The decor was really nice and the bar had a HUGE tv set up behind which was cool.  I'll probably have to check this place out once it's later at night to see it's full potential.  It's cool because there are teppanyaki grills, a nice bar, high tables and regular booths so there are options for big or small groups. 

FOOD: The food itself had it's highs and lows.  My family and I went with the teppanyaki grill and we ordered from that menu.  I myself ordered New York Strip steak with the rest of the other food.  The steak itself was good, cooked to medium, the vegetables cooked on the grill were good.  The ONLY thing I question is the use of the ""pink sauce.""  Our chef Kevin even said it's something that not all people enjoy and I wasn't one of them.  It's some sort of seasoning combination that really didn't add much to the food.  He put it on everything basically but I'm sure that he has to as part of the job.  Would much rather prefer actual spices on the food.

SERVICE: Service was decent at best, but our chef Kevin was the one that stood out.  He was really cool, personable and joking with us while he was cooking.  Pretty young start-up in the teppanyaki game, but I hope he does well and makes his way up to the higher standards of teppanyaki restaurants like those on the Strip.
