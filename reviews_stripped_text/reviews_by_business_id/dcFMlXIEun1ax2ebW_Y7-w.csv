Go to the very end of the strip and visit the Mc Donald's dollar menu.  This place isnt too cheap but everything is amazing and very well worth it. Service is good, food court is always clean.

While food in Vegas is generally not that cheap, for a place in a food court, you would come to expect a certain level of quality and price associated with fast food. This establishment fell far below even our lowest standards and we actually wish we went to the next door McDonalds instead. 

In terms of what was actually wrong with the Pizza, the crust and main body was overcooked, tough, and drier than Vegas soil. The toppings were sparse to begin with and were also overcooked. This really gross slice of pizza cost $6.95 but really should have been on the dollar section of a run down pizza joint.

I had gotten a mushroom slice and some kinda vegetarian slice with tomato, broccoli, and spinach on it. Both slices were semi old, the vegetarian slice being the oldest. Both should've been heated more, heat seems to be inconsistent in the oven. The mushroom was okay with the mushrooms being a little chewy due to the age. The vegetables on the vegetarian slice were atrocious; the broccoli and the spinach were dry and brittle. The crust on the vegetarian being the oldest was incredibly chewy especially not being cooked enough. 

Just get the meat ones since those pizzas get shuffled through much more quickly. The sausage looked quite good when I was looking. Those are probably better if you're going to eat here. It wasn't inedible, but that shouldn't be a consolation.",SJlUFga6_kA6WqOmTpCEsA,0,0,2,6rd5LBElh-ZMQZ4YJhOmHA
