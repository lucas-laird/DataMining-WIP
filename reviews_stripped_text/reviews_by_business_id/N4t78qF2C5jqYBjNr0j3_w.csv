Well.. Technically, GrubHub was supposed to deliver but due to MY mistake I ordered it for Pick-Up. 
Pho T ended up delivering to me . I haven't dine in the restaurant yet but this is already a Great Example of Great Guest Service . 

I was super surprise when I saw my food . 
I ordered spring rolls and seafood pho . 
Breaded Amt.Crab?! Breaded cod?! Genius ! 
Pho T just stepped up the game & challenged the Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas .
The broth was so good I didn't have to add a single seasoning/sauce (beside oil pepper Yum!) 

This is now my new go to place . I am looking forward to dining in soon .",KO1RNwtq1LZ_6AzYvjtQmA,0,2,5,P5OAcdsI4sRURU-PA51dbA

So it comes out and theres ox tail in the pho , i thought whoa that's coo but as i dug deeper with my spoon because i had to wait for chopsticks that the black server forgot to give me . I counted 4 beef flanks, 1 tripe , 1 tendon and 2 ox tail bones and thought wow how cheap is that bowl of pho, they must be Chinese ...The broth tasted like water and sugar and noodles were so bland and not even cooked ....so as I'm struggling to eat this unknown bowl of pho, I'm about 2 minutes into it. The black server drops the check in front of me . Didn't even ask if I was happy with the food or not. I see the bill is freaking 13 dollars for one bowl of pho. I totally flip like wtf it's not worth no fukin 13 dollars for this crap. I go to complain like no its not 13 it's 8.50.. The server shows me on the menu another house special pho that says with oxtail . Wow now I totally feel gouged by him, I told him to get the owners or mangers  and they all hid from me ..I also told the server to send back that bowl of pho and get me the pho I ordered ... He looked at me and told me I had to pay for that bowl of pho first. Never in my life has a place ever made me pay for Un satisfaction in which I didn't even eat the pho . As I'm writing this review I'm thinking I should have just walked out  but I did pay for the pho fukin 13 dollars for that crap and they knew I didn't even eat it. They let me walk out pissed and angry and hungary shows who these people really are.  There not here to give good quality food but here to take your money. Please do not go here, I will be calling the health department on them every month because I'm out to put these people under. Really people , pho T do yourself a favor and close your doors now you'll save more money that way u fukin amateurs. All over one bowl of pho wtf..

The vegetables and all the food is always fresh and the service is exceptional.  The restaurant is always clean.  This is a plus due to the location.  

The only downside is Vegas' Boulder Hwy transient population frequently move through the parking lot, but I have never had a problem inside the restaurant. The owners do a great job keeping them out and their customers comfortable.  This obviously does not detour me from eating here.

For starters, you walk into this restaurant and everything seems to look okay, but then you sit down and there's overwhelming smell coming from the table, my guess is this place cleans their tables with dirty rags. The waiter then comes over with the menu and asks if we would like anything to drink, they don't have that many options for drinks......we then look at the menu and omg half if it is crossed out with a sharpie. This brand new restaurant already doesn't serve half the stuff on their menu. We decided to order egg rolls, pho, and a rice dish. We sat there as our food comes out and they never brought us serving plates, napkins, utensils or anything, how do they expect us to eat? The eggs rolls were confusing huge when they came out and on the first bite, it was like chinese style, with lots of veggies and no meat. When I go to a vietnamese restaurant, I would at least like to eat vietnamese egg rolls. Then the pho comes out (they charged $3 for 2 tiny pieces of ox tail) and visually, I thought the food was getting better, but then we had our first taste and the booth was awful, it tasted like water.....after drowning my bowl in hoisin sauce, it still had no taste. My rice dish with pork chops and egg custard didn't look too bad, but the most important part of a rice dish is the rice and it was the worst rice I have ever tasted. The pork chop were not too bad, but how am I supposed to enjoy it when the rice tasted awful. Now the egg custard, was not even made the right way. The top is supposed to have an orange color to it, and it was colorless here. Egg custard is supposed to have wonderful flavors to it, but here, it was completely bland. The workers also made the experience worst. They didn't seem to meet customers' needs. There was also one specific worker sitting at the able next to us coughing vigorously while we were eating and it sure made me lose my appetite. This place was just awful, and the only excuse they have right now, is that they are new. They have some serious changes that need to be made if they want to be successful. Workers need to put customers first and know what their needs are, the food variety needs to stop getting smaller because crossing out items does not help their business, the food quality and taste most definitely needs to improve and I'd start by learning how authentic vietnamese food should be prepared, and overall, this place needs to be improved. You guys are a new business and this is your perfect chance to improve it while it's still new. I'll be back in a few months and I hope I'll have better things to say.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,2,2,1,ydcbRLUz8pHInZCieTkHLw

Small little place in a strip mall, plenty of parking. No nonsense decor and seating. We came in when it was over 100 outside and they did not have any air conditioning going. Not sure if it is broken or if they are just trying to save money.

We ordered one chicken pho with extra noodles and one rare beef. My husband also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. The coffee came out and it was almost black it was so strong. He loved it. Our noodle bowls came out quite a bit later. Huge portions, but then they did seem quite expensive. Nice sized servings of bean sprouts, thai basil, limes and jalapenos.  Very good broth.

First of all, we waited 15 minutes just to order and when going up to the front to tell them were ready, the first thing the girl said was ""Yeah, I know you guys have been waiting"". 

The girl around her 20's and the middle aged women she was working with had no sense of customer service whatsoever. You could totally tell the girl her in 20's was hungover too lol- Horrible work ethic; eating while on the job, on her phone and waiting to see if her coworkers would help a table first before doing it herself. 

We spilt a little Milk tea and the middle aged woman took 10 minutes just to give us napkins. She only gave 3 spoons when we had 6 bowls of pho.

We found this place close to my friend's vacation condo after finding the other pho restaurant  by her place closed for remodeling. That's fine because this place had what we wanted and needed. Hot soup on a scorching hot day, just you know... To cool ourselves off ;). 

We were greeted and seated right away by friendly staff. The restaurant was clean and comfortable, awesome!  We ordered fresh spring rolls and bowls of hot Pho! Both items were great, I could also be saying this because we were running on coffee and protein bars- super famished! 

The broth was good not too salty, so you can add whatever you like to make it personal. I like it hot... Spicy hot! I know... Insane is my game. I put in all the sliced jalapeños and some red chili oil, plus a heap of bean sprouts and tons of Thai basil. Yup that's my jam!  Awesome! It was exactly what we wanted. What I didn't want was the feeling after eating filling soup while wearing denim shorts. I need to think ahead or bring gym shorts in my purse at all times. :)

The service was great, friendly, and quick. One of us ordered the acclaimed oxtail pho, the other ordered thin sliced beef pho. Both were amazing. The oxtail pho was as advertised; full of meat that fell off the bone and an amazing broth that complimented it perfectly. This was so worthy of the few extra bucks. WOW! The thin sliced beef pho was also yummy. The meat was flavorful and the perfect portion to the noodles. We loved the fact that the side dish of fresh limes, basil, etc. were REALLY fresh. Many pho places give you a plate of sad looking add-ins, but not Pho T. All fresh and really delish!  For $2 we added a plate of steamed veggies: carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. This was the perfect way to add some veggies to our soups. We loved that they offered this side!  

Last night we popped in for dinner and landed right at the dinner rush, lots of tables filled and carry-out orders being placed. Gotta say that the service was slow, but heck we were in no rush and the waiter was doing his best and apologized for the wait time. On this go round we had the fresh spring rolls which were done perfectly and served with an amazing house peanut sauce. We also ordered the House Special Fried Egg Noodles (soft) with Beef, Chicken, and Shrimp, and the Bun Vermicelli with Lemongrass and Chili Beef (mild spicy).  Both of these dishes had ingredients that were fresh, flavorful, and not tough (beef in both dishes was done to perfection). The Bun included an amazing addition of fresh pickled veggies, along with the standard ingredients and this added an additional WOW factor!

Spring rolls- 2 small rolls for $5, not worth it.

Buddy got the house pho and just by looking at it I knew it wasn't good. The beef should be raw and dunked in the broth to cook to your liking. It was fully cooked and the rest of the ingredients looked terrible. I tried the broth anyhow, it was super sweet. Not pho broth at all. On top of that it wasn't really hot either. Why do these idiots serve warm soup?

I had the pork chop rice dish. They didn't give me a pork chop but rather the small pork cuts for other dishes. I requested pork chops and sent it back. they just removed the pork meat and put the pork chop over my egg to warm it up a little. No side soup or meatloaf with the pork chops and they charge 11 bucks for it? Wtf, the portions were small also. I was still hungry after eating half the spring rolls and egg rolls.

I walked in, not busy, but clean and very prompt service. They don't have the sandwiches on the menu which makes me sad, because those are my favorite. Maybe I should have asked. But I'm in a hurry and I need soup damn it! The lady at the front is very nice and friendly. She was so surprised I tipped her 6 bucks. I guess people are stingy on this side of town. Smh.

Anyway, on to the food. The spring rolls are super good and fresh. The pork inside is really thick and the flavor really comes through. Not packed as tightly as others, but really. Who cares. They're great. 

Next, the fried tofu. Extremely hot. Perfectly fried. The taste by themselves is actually delicous. The sauce that comes with it, the first thing you smell is lemongrass(?) and pepper. It's tangy but not too much so, and savory and delicious. It comes with a TON of peices of tofu. 20 peices to be exact. It doesn't look like it comes with enough sauce but it was just right for me. You may want to ask for a lil extra if you're a sauce or dip fiend. But it is very potent.

Next. The pho. I got the brisket. The broth was decent. Lacking something, however. Plenty of brisket that melted in your mouth, it had an amazing flavor. Lots of green onions and cilantro just the way I like it. The pho itself, to me, was a solid 3.5...it almost wasn't salty enough? I'll be back again to try the seafood pho. My one true love.

All in all, this place is great and I'll definitely be back seeing as its very convenient to my work and where I hangout. (And no, I'm not a boulder Highway hooker. Rude.)",_xuWz_ABhVJ4DtJYzC6ayw,0,0,3,hU7NZVnUylASzdnjbvRsYQ

Service: The staff greeted me quickly and were very attentive overall. A family came in five minutes after me, ordered after me and received both their spring rolls and entrees before mine. They appeared to know the staff, but still seemed off especially because I was dining by myself. 

Atmosphere: very clean, open and inviting. Choice of seats at a bar, tables or booths. I was a little hesitant about the food because the menu was kind of a mess. A lot of items were crossed off in black marker which seemed odd since it just opened and the pictures in the menu did not look appealing at all, especially the picture of the spring rolls. I was also disappointed that all of the pho options were beef only. No chicken, seafood or meatless options to be seen. There was a large range of noodle options though which was nice. Also surprised that they did not serve boba (crossed off) and Thai tea was nowhere on the menu.

Food: I ordered the spring rolls and flank and brisket pho. The spring rolls were really good, very fresh! I wish they were served with mint leaves but as they were they were still quite good.

The amount of time for the food to come out was not acceptable and there was only 2 of us. Her food came out and a little bit later mine came out. Had to ask for utensils and water. The waiters hands were all over out dishes. NOT GOOD! All in all we have gone there 4 or 5 times. Same thing every time, but we decided to give them a chance because we like their food and also believe in the small family business thing. Well, I went back there this weekend and it was a totally different place. We were greeted quickly, sat down, were given newly revised menus, had utensils and drinks, ordered and within an acceptable amount of time we both had our food in front of us. While I was there I had a conversation with the owner and we discussed all of the issues that she has had and she told us that most have been corrected. We were observing the whole time that we were there and I have to agree with her that changes have been made. In the past, we watched people get pissed off because of the lack of service and organization. I did not see a single person complain this time. (and there were lots of people there) I am convinced that this is  a good place and hope that anyone that has had bad experiences will go back and give them another chance.

We were the only two patrons until a man with a backpack showed up and insisted that he get a table by the door. The waitstaff wouldn't let him sit where he wanted and actually seated him at the table closest to the kitchen.  Our fellow diner sat for a minute and then left. I can understand the concern of the staff because there is quite a bit of activity in the parking lot but not so much in the businesses in the complex.
The service was pleasant, but I think because of the area, a little too attentive. 
The soup was hot, clear and tasty. It served its purpose, but I have had better.

I didn't read the description for the spring rolls and never had them so I was unaware that they contained shrimp, something I don't like. When they arrived I saw they were pretty large shrimp too! I decide to give them a try and... they were good. Didn't really taste any shrimpiness, the ingredients all combined to make a very flavorful spring roll. I'd definitely order them again, shrimp and all. 

The matcha smoothie with boba was just that, but with a hint of sweetness not found in the last matcha smoothie with boba I ordered at a different place. 

The pho was very good, though the broth seemed a bit cloudy and had a few oil spots. Whether the cloudy broth effects taste I don't know. I had Japanese Ramen at a place near the strip that I loved but I think this bowl of pho surpassed that ramen in how much I enjoyed it. I definitely will come back, even if it's just in passing to grab a smoothie with boba to cool off in the summer heat.",mUmrSJrP50Tb8EME6OYPcQ,0,0,5,wWYoAQ1XFZ_ZSH3opNuDUg

This little hole in the wall pho place was A okay. It's a Vietnamese restaurant so they have other dishes besides pho. They didn't have any sandwiches though which kind of sucked.

So to the pho. I got their pho dac biet with oxtail. This was $5 more than the regular pho dac biet $8.95 and came out to $13.95. It came with a good amount of noodles and meat, but I was disappointed in the oxtail. It wasn't cooked properly. the meat was not tender and it only came with 1 piece of oxtail. $5 more? Thumbs down in my book. I would have stuck to the regular pho dac biet and saved $5. I wound up taking the oxtail home and throwing it in to the pot of pho that was being made at home.

The broth was very good though. That's the main reason I'm giving them a high rating. It's the perfect balance of beefiness, saltiness, spices, and a hint of sweetness. 

We also got their egg rolls and spring rolls which were $5 each. These were okay-unremarkable. Nothing special.

The place is definitely a family owned hole in the wall. I didn't like the seats, but the workers were really welcoming and sweet. The booths were pretty small and uncomfortable though. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a quick bowl of pho outside of china town. Their broth was enjoyable and so was the staff. I can only suggest the pho though as everything else we tried was okay.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,1,3,B8w_dt4Yrpt41o0ZBI2eTA

Pho T is located at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway and Flamingo, and it's one of the closest Vietnamese restaurants to where I live in Henderson. I knew that sooner or later I'd have to give them a try, but maybe I should have waited even longer.

I ordered the #4 House Special Pho ($8.99), which comes with rare steak, brisket, beef meatball, and tendon. Broth seemed nice at first but it lacked depth and complexity. Noodles were fine. Meat was actually pretty good, although it would've been nice if they'd actually served the steak while it was still rare.

I did have issues though. A small one is that the Thai basil served on the side was not as fresh as it should be. Some of the leaves were on the slightly darkened or limp side. Flavor was fine, but you should have vibrantly green leaves. Larger problems are that they don't have a viable large size, with a $5.49 cost to upgrade to XL, and the default bowl size is small for the price. It's as expensive as large bowls elsewhere in Las Vegas and huge bowls at places in California.

I might consider going to Pho T again, but only if I get a specific craving or want to try out their rice and noodle dishes. I'd like to see an establishment run by a Vietnamese family succeed, but they have to be a little better to convince me not to make the trek to Spring Mountain or even to wait until my regular trips back to California.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,4,3,2n96-NR4NkYxTA-IYM4dSQ

I know there are many places in the valley to get my Vietnamese fix but none that are close to where I work or where I live.  But I found Pho T to be about half way between work and home and decided to give it a try.

I was impressed with how clean this restaurant is.  I noticed right away that it is a smaller but very nice restaurant that was nearly spotless.  I came in around 4:00 in the afternoon and it wasn't very busy so perhaps they had time to clean.  Given that it was not busy, I was greeted almost immediately by a very friendly hostess.  She took my order and told me it would be about 5 mintues.  Wow, that is fast service.  Works for me.  I was headed home and just wanted to get there with my meal.  The sooner the better.

I ordered Bun With BBQ Pork and Egg Rolls.  It is basically what I get at another Vietnamese place I've been to a few times.  There is something about the cold rice vermicelli noodles I need to have.  The salad underneath, the egg rolls and pork are just bonuses.  Though I have to say the pork was really good.  Smaller pieces than what I am used to in similar dished but very tender and a little sweet. With the house made fish sauce for dipping (also doubled as a salad dressing), the pork picked up a whole new set of flavors.  Maybe a big of anise which is not always a good thing for me as I am allergic.  This was just a light flavor and did not give me any side effects.  I am thankful for that.  Over all, I was impressed and satisfied. 

There are a couple of things I was not entirely happy with.  I found one piece of pork that was mostly just fatty gristle.  One piece of the bunch was not too disappointing.  Also, the egg rolls were pre cut when placed in the box. I would have preferred them left intact.  They cooled off too much by the time I got home and got a little chewy.  The taste was on point so I am sure had I eated them fresh they would have been awesome.

I might be back to Pho T to answer that craving again in the future.  Perhaps I'll even get adventurous and try something else.  I may even dine in so I can experience all the food more fresh than I can taking it home.  For now, I am set on my Vietnamese for a while.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,4,aHSd2Rh3Ai-NN7OM9Aiz_Q

I order the House Special Pho with Oxtails for  $12.99 and a Thai Tea with boba. 
When I walked in I was greeted by a very friendly lady who had my take out order all ready to go and the total was $18 and change. 
When I got home I was very pleased with the amount of meat and size of the Oxtails. I read reviews from this place that people were not happy with the Oxtails but there is no complaint from me. Mine were a good size very meaty and melt in your mouth tender and I was given 2. The broth was excellent and I enjoyed it very much. I was given a good amount of bean sprouts, cilantro, limes, basil, and onions to put on the soup in my togo box which made me happy.

Cons:
- Strong smell of trash in restaurant, almost unbearable
- Our server brought our waters with his hands on top of the glasses. My husband and I are both servers. BIG NO NO. just gross. Also, when we asked for soup spoons, his hands were all over that and placed it on our plates of veggies with his hands touching my ready to eat food. Ugh!
- 5 minutes after ordering, was told that they were out of the oxtail pho so I just ordered the pho tai.  Pretty bumming since I was really excited about the oxtail, one of my favorites but never had it in pho. Oh well.
- Drinks went empty quick. Didn't get refills until we asked when our check was brought over. 
- We were charged for the oxtail pho. It was fixed but the checks are just handwritten so it just has the total. No tax detail or anything.
- Staff was loud and unprofessional. One of them had their friend or boyfriend coming in and out. They were all just hanging out and chit chatting...you got time to lean, then you got time to clean! They also started talking about patrons as they left. I wonder what they're saying about us.

Pros:
- Pho was really good. Could have used more onions and meat, but still good, finished the whole thing:)

There is a lot of cons but they just opened, I'm sure, or atleast I hope, they are still getting it together. We will be going back since it saves us a drive and we just love pho.",W1jjRdbUg8zIcUI95jTUgQ,5,1,3,Lq7RdFqdgBnxGS-Nd2O0jQ

We got the green tea matcha, it was filled with ice. Literally, my boyfriend finished it in 5 gulps. We complained to the lady, and she told us no free refills. 

That's super petty to rip customers off like that, instead of just giving good service. I get it if there's ice in it, but it literally was packed to the rim on purpose. 

I kinda wish I got a picture of it before it was taken away. 

For the price I was paying for noodles, it was bland and you could literally have a way better meal for that price. The soup literally looked like water. 

I'm not the one to usually complain, I just really hate it when companies rip you off on purpose, and when you catch it they just turn around and do nothing.

During finishing our payment, there was a lady who walked in to order a bowl of Pho but maybe she didn't know exactly what will be in the bowl, when they brought it out, she saw one of the meat that looked like fatball so she wanted them to make another one for her. Instead of saying sorry or saying that they will fix it, their attitude toward the lady was so rude. The waitress (maybe also be the owner) showed that she didn't want to make another one for her customer, and she came to the back to talk to the guy who prep food, and I heard he said in Vietnamese to her which means ""next time when you see her face, don't let her go inside or force her to go away, what a bitch""

Service? Was awesome. Sat down at the bar while I waited for my food and the lady pretty much just talked to me like she knew me. Was very comfortable environment, very friendly. 

Also, got a free water. Don't know if that was the perks of sitting at the bar or just a nice thing for them to offer while I waited but it seemed like a bit of both if I'm being honest.

It is a small establishment sitting across from Sam's town, easily overlooked.

I was promptly greeted upon entering and sat right down.

Ordered spring rolls and a house special pho.

Finally a spring roll as I would expect a spring roll to be, fresh and you could taste the herbs.
Tried the sauce, it was a little thick for me, but it had that thai peanutty flair.

The pho came out quickly, only had half a spring roll eaten by this point, and it was nice and hot and came with all the expected accessories.
I put some sauce on my plate, never in the bowl and after putting in the sprouts and basil and mixing gave it a try.
The broth was flavorful, not the greatest pho but not chicken stock either.

I used the sauce on the tendon since I didn't really care for the texture, never had that before, but everything else already tasted great and was eaten straight.

If the broth tastes weak, it's because it does not have MSG. Just add some salt,  people. Rooster sauce it up. It's actually quite yummy.

It was a hard choice between this place and In N Out but we ultimately decided on Pho since were trying to go to places we haven't tried before. We came and there were about 4 tables occupied. A week after opening their doors , nice to see them picking up business. We were greeted and seated immediately and recieved our menus upon sitting. Our waitress Jan looked very young but was very professional and super friendly and got out drinks super quick. We already knew we were trying pho so our choices were easy. 

Upon going over our menu we noticed some items scratched out in sharpie. If I was the owner I would have the menus redone and those items taken off. Looks a bit tacky but this place is still working out the menu and probably going through trial and error so no biggy. I was surprised that tendon was not on the menu. I am a simple girl and always go for rare steak. Sometimes I switch it up and get brisket and rare steak , but the boyfriend likes pho with all the meats including tendon so that's why I asked. She informed me they're still working up there menu.  All pho is one size. So no worrying about small or large. If you're extra hungry maybe just order extra noodoo. Get it. Noodoo. Lol ! 

Spring rolls came out first and quick too ...

Spring rolls - Charsui & Shrimp with noodles lettuce and basil wrapped in rice paper. Really fresh and shrimp wasn't too shrimpy. Other places where I felt like the shrimp had a shrimpier ( yes I made that word up )  not fresh flavor to it. Everything wasn't tightly packed like they had been premade and sitting in a fridge for a while. Peanut sauce was yummy too ! 4/5 stars 

Every place is different with their broth. Overall the broth had a good flavor and was piping hot and comforting. It had a slightly sweet flavor I noticed. Not to sweet though. 

P6 - Pho with beef balls and brisket and flank - generous portion of meat and noodles. 

P2 - Pho with rare steak. Call me plain jane but I enjoy a simple bowl of pho with rare steak with extra cilantro and green onion. They definitely put enough meat. Other places I have finished the meat and left with only noodles and broth. I finished my noodles first which means they probably could have added more but I stil had plenty of beef left. I asked for extra cilantro and green onion because there just wasn't enough for my liking. 

We also ordered egg rolls but after our soup came which we should have ordered first. The egg rolls came with 6. Piping hot and crispy. Could have came with more lettuce and daikon but it's ok. Also the lettuce pieces should be a tad but bigger because some pieces did not fit around the egg roll and was hard to eat. The boyfriend eats them without the lettuce so I had enough. 

If you live on this side or in the Henderson area give this place a try. Fixed my pho craving and I left happy. They still are working the kinks out but I gotta give them credit. Get pho'd up !",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,9,7,3,OSpYD9HGQ2SLxvs2zCs3pg

Located in the Walmart shopping area on Boulder Hwy near the intersection of Nellis. Its in the northern part of the shopping area. I mention this only because the sign made me try the southern area first. 

The restaurant is very nice and clean. Seating for maybe 40. They had a young man out front taking orders. I went with an almond milk tea and bowl of Pho with rare beef and brisket. $8.50. No small or large bowl choice. 

The pho came out fast, the almond milk tea I had to request again because it was missed on the original order. The broth was fairly weak, maybe because they just opened and it hadn't had a chance to gain full flavor. By the end of the bowl the flavor improved. Good amount of noodles and meat.

Guess I gotta keep trekking across town to find the perfect pho.",qNf9mbGECHVN15ecyNLokA,1,0,2,su-SKORM5-HFXvYWqePXgg

As I mentioned before, the pho was not that bad but it comes down to the customer service. It's obviously a family owned business and with that being said they think they can get away with racist remarks and being unprofessional to their customers. 

I called an order in for pick up and upon arriving to the desk the cashier who made it clear she was the owner's daughter was having an unprofessional conversation with a customer. She looked to me and said ""Um, can I help you?"" I told her I was picking up and she replies ""Picking up what?"" After I told her she asked me if I spoke with her or her mother on the phone which I replied that I wasn't sure and she made a joke about Asian accents while the other customer and I just stood there. She said she can get away with it because she's Asian and white people like us can't because it's considered racist. 

It's so stupid to have to even explain how unprofessional and dumb you look representing your family's business. The girl just seemed like she had a lot of pent up aggression. Last time I come here. It's just too mind numbing to deal with.",CRF5c-Vo90Ulzd2vJhuprQ,1,0,1,gztjqxj9jGyVau6cVW_-Aw
