Once she took our bill she returned with it and proceeded to tell us what you needed to tip her and that we should tip her more.

The service was not good at all. Our waitress kept stopping at the bar and socializing while at the same time forgetting about us. When I would ask her things she would just smurk at me and I didn't know what the heck that meant... But lo and behold when it was the end of our meal and time to pay our waitress turned into ""SUPER WAITRESS"" and began working hard for that tip...Sorry Hun, you have to be SUPER WAITRESS throughout our whole freakin meal to earn a good tip and afterall it is your job. I don't care to ever return....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,3,0,2,aWDJXjWNJCuYQBuom1VBZg

We both had burgers and they were excellent. So we the drinks!

The menus has good variety for a bar.  Waitstaff very pleasant.  Uniforms clean and attractive.  Much better than casual dress.  The only down side was not adequate air filtering for non-smokers itwas a big neg for me.  I moved twice due to inconsiderate smokers.  It really suppressed the good vibe of the establishment.

We sat at the bar and waited over 10 min to get service, and then got told if you are not gambling we have to leave the bar. Food was ok, overall performance was poor and they need a work over and maybe a customer service class.  Sorry, hopes this bar would be better, but it is worse then the typical on the corner bar.",bq7GDxV30DiybWgedxQ-uQ,1,0,2,rDJBVKylUdvOo1IEH_uO0A
