I ordered guacamole here and I swear to god, it came out in a paste. A $4.00 paste, what a ripoff. It looked like they had mixed together sour cream and some green food coloring. I don't know what that was, but it was not guacamole.

The food is good, greasy, standard fare. The chips were good, but again, drenched in grease. If you're into that, okay. Nothing was remotely spicy and all the sauces felt like they were missing something, and again, greasy as hell. You're going to pay for going to this place in a gastrointestinal sense. What goes in must come out, one way or another...

I'm not really sure what the hubbub is about this place. Seems pretty standard and mediocre to me. I might try another location just to see if it's moderately better there, because this location is seriously gross - general gas station ambience, unclean tables, a grotty trash can right next to the cash register.

You can either buy a big drink at a low cost from the Freddy's soda machine, or you can get an equally inexpensive soda extravagance including coconut creamer and lime from Splash.

One thing I don't like about this location is that, unlike most Roberto's stores, it doesn't have a salsa bar. I like to pick up cucumbers, radishes, and carrots from the bar to enjoy with my meal.

On a previous occasion, I sent BW inside to purchase the meal, while I waited outside.  Now that BW was out and about, I had to park in a very busy parking lot and step inside to place an order around the witching hour that is the dinner rush.  The service was friendly enough, better than most Robertos I have visited.  I placed an order that I have eaten since my teens dining on Robertos in Cali.  It consists of a carne asada burrito with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream.  In addition, on most occasions, I also include a quesadilla because I love them.  After purchase, I stood around and observed the others standing around waiting for their orders.  I had seen while waiting in line, some rather intricate orders being placed while others were right off the menu.  An mix mash of the human circus.  I waited. I waited some more.  There was no sauce bar...you know, the kind with sauces, radishes, onions, and that spicy carrot & onion bar to keep you company while you wait.  Eventually, my order came up.  I bolted home to consume my meal.  Given the close proximity to the house, the meal traveled well. I found the quality to be that I have come to expect from Robert's.

3923481,2014-11-19,6,gCFf_GFUjgCSVcUe9yrphA,"Summary: A roller coaster ride of review updates for this Robertos Taco location. 

I am not sure why it has to be this way, but it is (this way). This place is as consistent as I am religious in keeping to ""clean"" language in reviews (which is to say not at fucking all). 

You get a public service discount one day, you don't the next. 
You get a drink with your combo (they are listed as coming with one, and certainly implied in the term), and you don't. 

I'm wondering if they are as A or B with their hand-washing back there. (Every one working with food should be A-type personalities when it comes to sanitation.)

One year they are two stars; incrementally they make a fan out of a skeptic; then, they manage to fuck it all up again. 

The breakfast burritos are the shittiest I have purchased at any other location on planet Earth. Pro Tip: Don't buy them. Just get a lunch/dinner burrito really fucking early. Your stomach will suffer one way or another at 4 a.m..

4014324,2015-10-28,1,gCFf_GFUjgCSVcUe9yrphA,"Desperate.  Hungry.  Impatient.  I want it now!

That's what happened when we were right in the middle ground of two different Roberto's Taco Shops in our area.  We ended up going to the one slightly closer to us for an afternoon snack.  The Roberto's that is located literally in a hole-in-the-wall...in Fabulous Freddy's Car Wash.

Not really used to this, being our first time here we made our way in.  Everything about this Roberto's is like the others around town, menus all look the same, kitchen all smells the same.  Thankfully!  We had a need...the need for....carne asada!  Sorry all you Top Gun lovers out there.  Ended up ordering one of my usual suspects from Roberto's, the Carne Asada Burrito ($5.65).  This bad boy has no frills - just meat, guac, and salsa.  On a fresh tortilla.  No cheese.  No sour cream.  But damn is it tasty!  Still one of the better burritos I've had!  

Service was fast, order was even faster since we were like the only ones there that day.

A couple of things knocked this Roberto's down a star.  Ambiance.  So strange, who likes eating Mexican in the middle of a non-Mexican car wash station?  I literally sat on a tiny table next to the snack racks on one side, and the beer coolers on the other.  Need a Twinkie?  I could have reached out and grabbed one as dessert.  Other gripe is that this Roberto's has NO condiment/salsa bar like all the other ones do.  I like buffet options dammit!  I like making my own little plates of cucumbers, radishes, pickled carrots & jalapenos.  Plus I like copious amounts of red & green salsa for my meal.  None of this available at the Roberto's in the car wash station.  But they do have all of these items for you, just ask the cashier behind the Roberto's counter and they will give you little baggies & containers of veggies and salsa.  

Roberto's luckily your Carne Asada Burrito is just as good as the ones I've had before in other locations.  Meaty, fatty, rich, carb & calorie loaded, with a touch of fresh.  Just the way it should be!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,1,3,MTCGZJxU1gvQU1kdFo4o4g
4120168,2016-03-01,0,gCFf_GFUjgCSVcUe9yrphA,"There are two reasons I decided to give a one star review. The first is more of an annoyance. The second is the reason I will NEVER return...

Today I got some carne asada nachos. I've gotten these from plenty of robertos locations in the past, it's one of my favorite things on the menu. 

The first reasoning I gave a low review for this location is that they don't have the ""bar"" where you get carrots, salsa, cucumbers and more. Instead you must ask for them from behind the counter and they'll give you a small bag. We ordered multiple meals for multiple people, asking for carrots and salsa and they give one bag. Even though we asked for a particular number. They're very stingy when it comes to giving salsa, carrots and everything else. I would understand only giving one of each if I got one small meal, but when I buy a lot of food, I don't understand why I'm still only allowed to get one bag of carrots. The more items I buy should allow me a bigger helping of these things. Example: I should get a minimum 1 bag for each meal I pay for. Honestly I could see past this, it's really not a great reason to give a one star review for but it is one thing that annoys me and others about this location.

And now time for the biggest reason I gave them one star. 

The reason I'm giving only one star is because what I found IN my food. I found a BUNCH of chopped up rubber bands. (The ones that usually hold bunches of cilantro together) at first I just thought some parts of the meat were chewy, until I looked harder at my food and I'm glad I noticed, the rubber bands are green so they blend in pretty well. My stomach is starting to majorly ache, I really hope I don't get sick from this. I understand mistakes happen but this sounds more like someone was just being lazy! I will not be returning to this location. Truth be told, I might not eat Robertos at any location again. Thankfully I found a better tasting taco shop, way cleaner and great pricing. And their food is even better at curing hang overs. LOL.  Sorry Robertos, we had a good run. Goodbye!",Gtz6abx4gLeaFds4l_1ggg,0,0,1,MGnYrzGr7_gbAJmQaUUjZw

I mostly order the same things when I go here. I get the California burrito (carne asada, pico, cheese, potatoes), carnitas burrito, super nachos, breakfast burrito, chicken taquitos or chorizo plate. I have delved off before, but I feel these are the better things to order so I stick with it.  The only thing I avoid though is shredded chicken here - I'm not a fan of it shredded and then sitting in a sort've sauce. I prefer grilled and diced style chicken at other places. 

I always have found it amusing that somehow this is the unofficial hangout for teens who just got their cars. I guess there's not much up here they're allowed late-ish.

No, it's not like my favorite hole in the walls where they don't speak English, but don't turn your nose at this chain.

 It's decent late night food and is part of our rotation when we don't want to cook. I come at a certain time at night every night and usually on days we work.

3 rolled tacos chicken with guacamole and sour cream
Carne asada burrito

The only down side of the location is, with all the business coming in for gas, car washes and regular convenient store transactions, it is hard to find parking. So be prepared to wait during the mid day, for a spot.

 I have to take it easy. Let me cut to the chase this place is the opposite of healthy. If your a healthy eater with a balanced gut... man this place will destroy you lol. I asked the cashier Juan what he recommends he was not much help after  telling him it's my first time here. I ended up getting the carne asada fries, Shredded chicken chimichanga, & two bean & cheese burritos. WHAT! I was hungry, jk it was for my lady and I to split. The flavor was good it left a greasy lard taste in my mouth and left me quite gassy. 

If your used to heavily fried Mexican Foods & your tummy can handle this is a good spot for you my friend.

My wife sometimes gets the California Burrito, which is also very good!

The only down fall is if u order more than 2 breakfast burritos at a time because they always jack them up. 
Late night run is on point.

Roberto's tacos has 99cent  chicken tacos on wednesday!  Talk about cheap eats!  Everyday I struggle with the ""where to eat a cheap lunch --- other than subway""  ... dilema.

So these crunchy and tasty little tacos do the trick!  The taco is premade, but they fry it up and stuff it with cheese and lettuce.  Its that simple and it is that good.  I ate 5 tacos for lunch and went back for dinner and ate 4 more!!!!!

BTW - this particualr Robertos is in the nicest gas station I have ever been in!  Do not be afraid of a taco shop in a gas station.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,0,0,4,Ko1kQnVU-1OsyGYEYIkiNQ

The chicken was plentiful, shredded and tasty.  Enough beans, and fresh veggies to make it a mound of the most delicious dinner that was enough for 2 feedings.  Daughter had her fav: chicken quesadilla.  It was over-stuffed with cheese.  She was pretty happy.  Service through the window great and fast and very affordable!!

5774830,2014-12-16,0,gCFf_GFUjgCSVcUe9yrphA,"Cleanliness: 3 Stars
The front of the restaurant looks like the rest of it, everything was completely cluttered. For the volume this place and being a chain resturant the amount of people this place sees on any given morning I am disappointed by the food storage and prep areas..

Hospitality: 4 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Aside from being a snippy and trying to continently ask if ""That's It"" after each item my experience wasn't bad.

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great for a ""quick"" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,1,0,4,wZyMvA1zxppCI35piEQUog

The location at Durango and elkorn was not so bueno.. no salsa bar, it's in a gas station. You can ask for red salsa, green salsa, pickled carrots but no green onions or horseradish. Whyyy? To top it off every table was filthy, no one was cleaning and the lady at the register definitely did not want to be there.

I always get chicken tacos. Although I don't consider them authentic, I prefer them over many Mexican restaurants in this area. The staff at this Roberto's are very nice.

On our way home from church I called my order in, so we could just quickly grab and go since my husband had to leave for work. The order was simple, a CA burrito w/gauc, a carnita burrito, and a side of rice. I got home to find the burritos were half the size they usually were, the tortillas were dry, and the gauc I was charged for wasn't on the burrito. If my husband didn't need to leave to go to work I would have driven back over there, but there was no time. At least the rice was good! I guess I will be making the drive out to Aliante from now on.",zRcgTyJBqFNeGYH2TSzSIw,1,1,2,Weazck6sETqj3ln6s-3PHQ
