We ordered the wedge salad and were informed that the produce in it was harvested only hours prior from a hydroponic greenhouse in Las Vegas. It was the crispiest iceberg lettuce I've ever had. My husband asked if they had ranch dressing and our server informed him that they do not, however, they could whip it up homemade on the spot!

1941798,2018-06-11,1,TXV5mRFOGjwY7igrPjkKVA,"Scotch 80 Prime Steakhouse is named after a local Las Vegas residential community that has long been known for celebrity residents. 
This restaurant in the newly renovated Palms casino truly is a destination. Here you may sample from the single largest (consumable) scotch collection in the world and a scotch sommelier will help you do it. 

With your scotch you can enjoy the fine art. The walls are adorned with over $100M worth of pop and contemporary art. Artists include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Damien Hirst.  Apparently, you can buy them if you have a cool $10M+ to drop at dinner;). 
Not only is the scotch and art collection alluring but the food is really good as well. 

At your request a vegan menu is available and from what I can tell was given the same TLC as the main menu.  The Chilled White Asparagus Gazpacho with
grapes and toasted almonds was creamy and silky smooth and the baby vegetables on the Cauliflower Steak were so ""buttery"" .

The Cauliflower Steak itself also had a really good char on it and the roasted shallots and olive tapenade that they served it with gave it great flavor.  Both vegan dishes were surprisingly very good.  

On the main menu, for vegetarians there was a Burrata salad with heirloom tomatoes and crispy basil.  There were also 7-8 vegetarian friendly sides on the main menu.  With the bread service (all made in house) believe it or not, a vegetarian could really fill up here. 

My husband ordered ""Chef Berry's"" Rib Cap, which at 12 ounces really was a large portion for $52. He said it was good and seasoned really well. 

Because we were so full, we ordered the cheesecake which was beautiful and delicious. When we go back we'll be sure to save room for the Table-side Banana Split ($36).  They make ice cream from scratch in a kitchen aide on a rolling cart table side and you're given an option of about 9 toppings, arranged on a painter's pallet for your choosing.",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,7,6,5,lJs6IfQtX4Wgd16H3-mspA

I highly recommend the short rib ravioli atop the bone marrow (you MUST put the marrow with each bit to get the full flavor affect). Each course was timed perfectly so that I never felt rushed, too full or hungry. My steak was cooked slightly over what I had ordered, which seemed to be a common theme at my table- but delicious either way! Favorite side dish was most definitely the Mac n cheese... nothing complicated here, but such rich and melty cheese that made the dish comforting and nostalgic. 

The signature cocktails I was able to try were all amazing. They also have a cart they push around to tables to create custom drinks! 

Our server was hilarious and so attentive. I know this steak house has a bright future ahead and I will absolutely return to enjoy more of their offerings in the very near future!",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,6,5,5,0IK4AkQqo2ZJyP7gJlqTJQ

I had the Salud cocktail...oh yes.
We had the rock shrimp in siracha glaze and avocado aioli dipping sauce...i imagine this is what crack is like!

I had a Scotch 80 (cocktail) as well, silky smooth, so delicious.
I have no photos, sorry, did not feel right pulling out the camera.  The clencher again was the service, i cannot brag enough 
The chef came out to say hello, the manager stopped to check on us, the vibe is great.

The ambience is amazing and everyone was so polite, helpful, and not to mention beautiful. I don't think I've been to a restaurant where everyone was so gorgeous. Presentation was top notch! The only downfall we had was not knowing who our actual waiter was. One gentleman was amazing the other not to so. He took down my steak order wrong which was a big disappointment then when we asked him to take a picture of us he cut half of me out of the picture twice. When the main course was delivered we came to the realization he got my steak order wrong but accurate for another person in our party. He suggested either accept the current order, he could put in the correct order which would take 15 minutes, or me and the other person in our party split the correct steak order. Not waiting to wait an additional 15 minutes I just accepted the current order. I'm friends with a manager there and my friends are friends with a server so they comped dessert and two rounds of shots which was very generous!

The food is where I feel my three star rating is coming from. The onion soup was great, and my husband said his steak was good but nothing special. My chicken Caesar salad was lacking a bit along with the mashed potatoes. I can't justify paying such a price for ""okay"" food. 

I will say the service is awesome! I loved everyone we spoke with and we could tell they were really trying to be on top of everything.

4057896,2018-07-01,1,TXV5mRFOGjwY7igrPjkKVA,"This place blew me away!  Let's mention the elephant in the room.  This place is expensive, even by Las Vegas standards, but even considering the prices, this was amazing.  From start to finish, it was an incredible meal and we made sure to have the full experience.

We started with fresh, kumamoto oysters, steak tartare and ribeye ravioli.  I do not like pasta, so imagine my surprise when that ribeye ravioli rocked my world.  The ravioli was the perfect texture, the ribeye filling was flavorful and tender, and there was a dusting of salt.  Perfection!  Four ravioli come in order so keep that in mind if you are ordering for a group.  As for the steak tartare, highly recommended.  It had a bit of a spicy kick, fresh arugula to pile on top of a pretzel crostini.  That pretzel was crispy and the perfect vehicle to shovel that dish into my mouth.  Really great steak tartare.

For entrees, my husband and i shared lobster tail and bone-in New York.  Both were perfectly cooked, flavor explosions.  If you made me choose, go for the steak.  Our friends ordered bone-in, dry-aged filets and said they were fantastic.  We split several sides -- yukon gold potatoes gratine, creamed corn, heart-stopping potatoes, asparagus tips, and gnocchi.  I don't like gnocchi, but they ate it up.  Hands-down, my favorite dish was the potatoes gratine.  Cheesy with pickled jalapenos to give it some heat.  

For dessert, we split toffee cake and the banana split.  I am a sucker for a gimmick and that banana split presentation was everything.  If you make my dessert in front of me, use a blow torch, and liquid nitrogen, I'm sold.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the incredible service we got from Andre and the gorgeous white and gold decor, topped off by those 3-D prints leading into the dining room.  Andre took great care of us and was able to keep up with our friend's witty banter.

The tower was great however I was left questioning if it was any better than other establishments I had been to and I would have to say no. If you want to separate yourself I would suggest Dungeness Crab rather than Alaskan King. The octopus was perfect as well as the large prawns. The scallops were superb. Now here is where it gets dicey for me, my steak. It was in a word, fine. That is not what I'm looking for however. I have prepared and cooked steaks on my own BBQ that far surpassed what I was served. It wasn't bad. Don't get me wrong. I will not remember it. The sides were nothing special so I won't address them. In short, I most likely will not return and would not recommend to friends simply because the price does not equal the food.

We started with onion soup for and lobster bisque for me. Mine was delicious! Hers I thought was a bit salty and lite on the onion.
For dinner she had the bone in filet oscar, and I the kaygu sirloin. Sides were peas with mushrooms and scalloped potatoes. Steak: mine was outstanding, ( a $75 steak should be) but to not pick, the coating at times overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. The wife enjoyed hers although I didn't care for the flavor the ""oscar"" gave the meat. Both steaks were huge and we did have enough left for breakfast next day. The peas needed another 10 minutes to cook, I like alldente, but not raw. And potatoes also needed to be done further.

5306573,2018-06-23,0,TXV5mRFOGjwY7igrPjkKVA,"This is a cool spot found inside the Palms casino just off the Vegas strip.  Scotch 80 Prime walks the fine like between new modern and old Vegas.. and they do it very well.  The restaurant is dark as is to be expected with any self-respecting steak house in Las Vegas.  Throughout the lounge, bar, and dining area you will find various types of modern art that give Scotch 80 a new ages feel.  The service we received from start to finish is that which you come to expect at a fine dining establishment in Las  Vegas.

We started our meal with a few cocktails, the house bread basket, and appetizers, most notably the ribeye ravioli and spazz salad.  Both are large portions and are big enough to split, but weather or not you're willing to after the first bite is an entirely different question.  The ribeye ravioli is served on a marrow bone atop a bed of spinach steamed with garlic.  The richness of the marrow is not lost on the pasta and the whole dish plays very well together.  This was my favorite thing of the night.  The spazz salad was very good as well.  It comes with large chunks of shrimp in it, and isn't over dressed with their house vinegrett.  Would I order the salad again?  Yes.  Is it a staple when I go back?  No.

I ordered the 22oz bone in New York, and was happy with the meat overall.  The flavor was all that you'd expect from dry aged beef.  The only complaint I have here is that my meat was slightly over cooked.  When I say slightly, I really mean slightly.  It wasn't anything even worth bringing up to the staff, but at $65.00 for the steak, it's worth pointing that out.  I'd order this steak again without hesitation.

For our sides we ordered the green asparagus, mac n cheese, and potatoes al gratin.  My rankings would be: 

1) Potatoes
2) Mac n cheese
3) Asparagus

The potatoes were by far the best combining that funkyness from the cheese with the bright pop of the fresh herbs, and the spice from the jalepeno.  I'm not big on mac n cheese, but my wife wanted it, I'd call it average.  The asparagus was the worst thing of the night.  The flavor was there, but it was over cooked and mushy.  I'd favor spinach over the asparagus for a green vegetable in a heartbeat.

For desert I got the lemonz.  I'm not big into sweet myself, so I elected to go with something a bit more on the fruity side, and boy was that the right choice.  I'd bathe in that lemon marscapone if it was socially acceptable.

Throughout the night the service was prompt, and pleasurable with a perfect balance of conversation and isolation.  This is a very big asset for this restaurant.  Robert who took care of us all night made great wine suggestions and answered all of our questions.  The chef care into the dining room and visited our table to make sure everything was well prepared and tasting as it should.

We'll definitely be back here, and I'd say it's worth a try for locals and tourists alike.",cB5M0WvNLk3bJi2IMsPH9w,1,0,4,LtzVI1nFSryhkckkNZsAHQ
5384367,2018-05-26,1,TXV5mRFOGjwY7igrPjkKVA,"I ate here 3 times on my most recent Vegas trip. Once by myself for dinner, once at the Bar and once with family who just happened to be in Vegas at the same time as me. All three experiences were fantastic and definitely worthy of a 5 star rating!

As I walked into Scotch 80 Prime for my first meal, I was impressed by the art collection they have assembled for the restaurant. The Dining Room itself is elegant and relaxed. Service from start to finish was fantastic. Now onto the Food (and Drink) details.

I started the evening with a Smoked Old Fashioned Cocktail made Tableside with Bulliet Rye, Demerara Sugar Syrup, Bitters and Apple Wood Smoke. The Tableside option is more expensive, but you are getting an excellent drink and a show! 

My first course was the Hamachi. Beautiful, Pristine slices of the delicate fish were served with a scattering of Sliced Strawberries, Fresh Mint, Fresno Chilis and a unique non-alcoholic Spirit distilled from Peas called Seedlip 108. The perfect combination of Sweetness, Heat and Floral notes made this the best Crudo dish I've ever had.

My Entree was the Colorado Lamb Chops. Perfectly Grilled with Mesquite and simply seasoned with Salt and Pepper, these were amazingly tender and tasty. Even though Scotch 80 Prime is an elegant restaurant, I couldn't resist slicing the double cut Chops into meat lollipops and eating them with my hands! They were so good, I almost forgot about the excellent Saffron scented, Baby Dutch Potatoes with Sweet Onions that were served under the Chops.

I finished my night with a beautiful Dessert called Lemonz. Lemon Mascarpone inside a White Chocolate Shell with Blueberry Ice Cream, Crumbled Shortbread and a Sugar Hoop. A great light way to end a wonderful meal.

The next night I came in after a long day of Poker and sat at the Bar for a couple Drinks and Appetizers. I started with The Hamachi and it was just as good as the night before. I moved on to the Ribeye Ravioli with Bone Marrow. The Ravioli was so good it could easily be served in the best Italian Restaurant. Swiss Chard and delicately pickled Mushrooms cut the richness of the Pasta. I also had two great cocktails with my food. A barrel aged Negroni and a Champagne based cocktail called a Noroc, with Melon, Mango and Imperial Brut.

My last night in Vegas I came back with family and our experience was even better. We started with the Gnocchi in Truffle Cream, Heirloom Tomatoes with Burrata Cheese and Bacon's Best. The Italian in our group called the Gnocchi and Burrata the best she ever had. I loved the Bacon. Braised Pork Belly served with a Savory Chocolate Sauce was so tender, we could pull it apart and it melted in your mouth.

I then had the Bison Filet. Perfectly pink, tender, rich and slightly gamey, it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had. The others in our group shared the same thought about their Steaks. As we finished our night sharing the Lemonz dessert and a selection of  Ice Cream and Sorbet, one person in our group said it was the best Restaurant meal he'd ever had.

Service was impeccable from beginning to end on all three visits and they are easily wheelchair accessible, including a lower section at the bar. Overall, Scotch 80 Prime matches or surpasses its predecessor on every level.  I can't wait to come back!",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,9,7,5,vbY_sDiEhvrIDnSIc33pBQ

The food- my husband and I both got the bacon to start, Filet Mignon, baked potato, lobster, and Mac and cheese. The bacon was tender, and the chocolate works perfect with the meat. 
The Filet was Not like N9ne (so so sad) But it is not the worse steak I've ever had. The steak is cooked on an open flame and then put under a high heat broiler to sear in a crust which if left on for too long, can make the meat tough which is what happened. 
Mac and cheese was great but salty. Lobster was delicious and very fresh. Baked potato is not worth getting. 
A few Tweaks would make this place a 5/5. Hope to be back!",wZzFxuhEUv5cyd_iE23I8A,2,1,4,51ky0MiOWacLB61nmgqIrA

They explained that they had just opened last month and have been much busier than they expected.  Came to try the Kobe beef since this restaurant is one of the few in the US that are actually certified to sell true Japanese Kobe.  The Kobe steak was excellent!  We also tried the Filet, the aged bone in NY, and the aged bone in rib eye.  All steaks were very flavorful, with the Filet being our favorite of the cuts.  Unfortunately our ribeye was way over-cooked and they were quick to take it back and bring us a new one.  The one thing about the steaks is we felt they were a little over-charred, but others may like it that way.  The sides and drinks were all good. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly.  Give them a couple more months to work out the kinks and I am sure it will be an excellent steakhouse!",X5vcpltk5zJ8WBiZMfEliQ,0,0,5,nUKRrDXzzcX-3fX0Y0junA
