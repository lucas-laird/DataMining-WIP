1195223,2017-08-14,2,Nr5TGaBoGraxbZBCzKyvuA,"Another place I would give the finger over a single star rating. It honestly sucks to give them one star based on the way they handled a simple situation and made it an lame experience. First of all the tacos had very little meat. I order two tacos de tripas and you could count the pieces of tripas in the tacos. At $2.50 each you had better do better than that! Now here is where I had a problem. My son does not eat spicy food. I made it a point to tell the woman taking orders that I need a bean and cheese burrito with no salsa, just plain beans and cheese. You would think this idiot would tell me that their refried beans are prepared with chile in them! Well, she didn't. My son took a bite and then tells me ""Mom, the beans have chile."" I took a spoonful of beans and sure enough they have Chile in them. I walked up to her and handed her the burrito letting her know that my son could not eat it because the beans have chile and I would like to have the burrito replaced with a quesadilla, Just the cheese and the tortilla. She takes my burrito and then hands me the quesadilla when it's ready. Here i thought it would be like other small businesses that gladly replace something when the customer is not Happy with what they received.  She then tells me it's $3.50 for the quesadilla. I told her that we will not be paying for the quesadilla since she failed to tell me that the beans had chile and my son doesn't eat chile. She then says ""what fault is it of ours that your sons doesn't eat chile?"" Oh bih, no. Not only did she show how stupid she was by making such a comment regarding a six year old child but she also managed to add to the fire burning within by telling me she threw away the burrito when I gave it to her so that we couldn't take it home with us. The meats were blah, the service was pure shite. Take your money elsewhere where you get a good amount of meat and better customer service. Oh wait, one more thing. Their Jamaica and horchata are kept in funky jars in their fridge and they dilute it with water and then serve it to you 15 minutes after you order it.",nCMzNz3HW6nD_ccOawYisA,0,0,1,rj737siVOwfMssq4j05wFg

I love their tacos de tripa and I would suggest getting these extra crispy.   The only odd thing is I have seen them come straight out of a frozen bag into the fryer.  The taste is still great, just odd to me as I have never seen it done this way.  This may however be a good thing as they can tend to be a little on the gamey side if not cleaned thoroughly, so coming from a pre-package source may ensure quality.   

Their burritos are also tasty and will cost you $5.50 or an extra $2.00 if choosing lengua or tripa and best of all their tortillas are freshly made.

WHO: STREET VENDORS ALL AROUND LAS VEGAS(Brick and Mortars like Los Tacos and El Gordo DO NOT COUNT!)

Nice staff and pretty good tacos in Chinatown next to Tofu Hut....Open for just about 2 weeks, Tacos La Carreta is in a great location and is one of the newer street vendors popping up on the streets.

They have a very extensive menu of items, and one item that caught my eye was their Taco de Papa(Potato) at $.75/each, they're not bad...Think Jack-In-The Box style taco crossed with the flavor of a potato pierogie...reminds me of my mother-in-laws Tacos de Papa. I also tried a Taco de Tripa(Beef Intestine) It was kinda small and still pretty good. Right now, the best Tripa IMO is at Tacos Cancun.

Definitely room for improvement and with time, they'll get better....ALOHA!!!!

The tacos were not tiny and were filled nicely.  I added some condiments on them from the condiment bar.  $1.50 a piece.  They ran out of nopales at the condiment bar, but I'm willing to overlook that as I was not anticipating them to begin with even though they would have been a nice touch.

There are chairs set up outside of the truck for you to eat on.  There are also a few stools on the truck, but those were occupied.

This place is just like any amazing taco truck. The truck is run by a small family that spends so many hours on this place. They open at 6pm, and is worth every bite. 

I usually get carne asada and al pastor tacos, marinated pork with pineapple for the non natives, and their salsa, which I stock up on since it's so delicious. 

I've come here half a dozen times since moving here. And they save me from crappy food each time. Yesterday, this is where I came after finding hair in my food at a restaurant across the way. 

It was the first time I had their fried potato taco, which was a slice of home for me (I grew up in Los Angeles if you don't know LA, El Monte if you do). 

Their asada is so tender and flavorful. They cook it to perfection and it is never dry. The al pastor is the same way, the pineapple is subtle but I don't get chunks of it, and the caramelized onions just bring everything together.",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,1,0,4,Rdv2VgyMF3_6xONS6UvXOg

I'm a die hard when it comes to trying all different entrees, but do have my favorites.
Tacos La Carreta has by far the most delicious lengua (tongue) tacos EVER.
If you've never had the opportunity to partake, it is a must.
Perhaps the idea of tongue takes you somewhere unable to explore the possibility is food righteousness in your mouth. Don't kid yourself.
The lengua is seasoned to perfection and so tender.. served with the traditional cilantro and onions, few wedges of lime.. you need no more. 
I order three:w/grilled chili's or onions on the side, use the green sauce from the salsa stand then sit in heaven for 10 minutes as I devour my food.
It's walking distance from my house, so once the blistering sun fades in the evening, I take a stroll to their truck.
I'm never disappointed and I always leave smiling. If you love the taco truck revolution you MUST TRY

We almost got lost at first since it's close to an intersection. We didn't have a hard time with parking though since we went there late in the evening. They have some chairs set up for those who wanted to eat there but we opted for take out. 

Don't be fooled by the exterior because they have really good food. We tried all their tacos and my favorite was the tripe. The quesadillas was also good for the serving and price. The Carne Asada fries had a nice blend of marinated meat, sauce, caramelized onions, and avocados. They went all out on that one. The sizes of their burritos can be shared among 2 people especially the addition of rice can really make it filling. Overall a great experience. Will definitely try it again next time.

I don't regret coming here. It was a good spot to kill the craving of tacos after a fun night.

I ordered the crane Assad quesadilla. It was really good taste wise but the meat had a bit too much fat for me. Maybe it was my natch. My brother had tacos and
he didn't experience that. 

The employees are nice. We went inside the a building they have next to truck and they turned on heating lamps because he saw me shivering. That's was a nice gesture. 

I'd definitely return to try the tacos.

It can be easy to miss but just keep your eyes peeled for a blinking cone...or just look for a big white truck! Parking is fairly easy as the place never gets crowded. The place is pretty chill lots of people finishing up their night from clubbing or bar hopping trying to sober up. 

I usually just get one of each of their tacos and carne asada fries to share with my friends. If I were to narrow it to the best flavors though it'd be the tongue and marinated pork :) . As for the carne asada fries they're pretty much average but its a good filler food. 

Other from that it's pretty much self serving, they have the drinks on the side. DON'T FORGET THE SAUCES, it's usually covered but feel free to open up that metal cart. They usually are pretty stocked with everything and if not you can ask them directly for any sauce you want. Prices are $1.50 a taco which isn't too bad. If anything I'm always too smashed too care.

But if you noticed the brightly lite interior of a white trailer with a few bar chairs setup right at the counter, then you have spotted Tacos ""La Carreta"".  The visual reminded me of the food stalls in night markets in Asia, but this is way cleaner.

Their menu is pretty simple, tacos, burritos, quesadilla, tortas, paras and even hot dogs.  The portion is smaller but so is the price tag.  I feel that it is portioned just right for you to sample more of their menu.

The Lengua Taco is my favorite of all the items I ordered.  The owner, Juan Carlos, also made me a potato taco that I have never tried before.  My mouth enjoyed the new experience.

The owner and the cashier lady are super nice, and the entire taco truck is kept super clean. Way cleaner than some kitchens I have seen around the Las Vegas valley that conspicuously display their ""A"" rating from the local health inspection.  The food is pretty good, but could benefit from further refinement.  But that is just my opinion, and I am not at all an expert in Mexican food.  

Service is fast and friendly. And after awhile waiting for a friend to arrive, a steady flow of Spanish speaking patrons started arriving.  So that is a good sign I think.

Come check them and support a local new business.

They are currently open only on Friday-Sunday from about 6 to 10pm.
