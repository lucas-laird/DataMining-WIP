I went to Starbucks, a must! Then grabbed a breakfast sandwich real quick at Farmers Boys.
I deposited a check at Bank of America, in literally two minutes. Headed over to Walmart and grabbed a few items I needed. I went to AT&T to try and fix an issue with my business phone lines.. No luck. Good thing there is a Verizon here, I'll be heading there soon. 
Right next to AT&T is a Sally's... I've never been there, but I run in to see if they have a curling/flat iron I've been looking for, and they do! 
Right on the back side of Sally's is Optic Gallery, I head over there and pick up my contacts. Next to that is Line Cleaners, so I drop of my 2 outfits I've had in the trunk for a week waiting to get dry cleaned. 
I have about 20 minutes, so I head across the parking lot to Payless Shoe Source, because I see the big Buy One Get One 50% off sign and I just can't help it! 2 pairs of shoes later, I head next door to Dollar Tree to grab some pencils for my son.
I did this all in about an hour! I could have done more. I could have gone to PetsMart and Lowes, trust me! There are things I need from there, always!  But, I had to go. Another time. 
The parking lot and areas are always clean. There is security and the carts are picked up often. 
I could not think of a thing to gripe about, when it comes to a Marketplace.",gCiyPyXnwTNpmee9krJfxQ,3,2,5,wEgp4IjVrcFeCfrHjP7l6Q

Lots of parking is available, though entry and exits are kinda on the weird side. There are mainly four sections. There is still some commercial space for lease.

Over the weekends, we like to plan out our shopping trips/errands, so we check out a few places here when we need to go to one store, and sometimes we get a bite to eat, too. As you can see (scroll below), there are a ton of places to eat. 

Here are some of the stores: Wal-Mart- this one has an excellent crafts section and this store is better than the other ones we go to (Decatur/Charleston or Tropicana/Pecos- smaller store, smaller selection); used to be empty, but I think that the secret's out 'cause there are plenty of shoppers here. PetsMart- been here many times for dog supplies and turtle supplies (and grooming department, a ways back). Lowe's- been here a few times. Office Depot. Ross- been here many times, alright store. Payless Shoe Source. Sally's Beauty Supply. 

Services include: Bank Of America, FedEx Office- been here a few times to make a drop-off, Jewelry, Cigars, H & R Block, Dental, Nails, Cleaners, Psychic Eye.

Restaurants include: Chipotle- been here many times. Jamba Juice- been here many times. Gyro Time- have not been to this one, yet- Starbucks- Port of Subs- Carl Jr's- Del Taco- Farmer Brothers Burgers- I wanna check this place out.

Worth checking out several places since it's all in one shopping center.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,6,1,5,aNdhYmWRM0eHOSIYZDNFPA

They were warm and friendly and beyond helpful where as most Sally's the staff ignores you or had an attitude. Thank you for being awesome and brightening my shopping experience! See you next time!!",ZcF-2jI0D6VbBLBu2TQueQ,2,1,5,RfulC8-F45Yys1SJJxGQ5w
