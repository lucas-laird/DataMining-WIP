It's open 7 am - 10 pm, seven days a week, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Valet parking available.  Same great food as the former location on Charleston!",0T5U8bFGUyeaNgHq5yo0Gw,0,0,5,nVwS4lt0lMKMfPihkvv_Pg

The food is good, the price point reasonable and it's located in the arts district...which you've been saying you should be frequenting more often anyhow!",qHW9KOby5HzBuOC5Y7uzlw,1,0,4,QYfd-y6wBJxrNLqa8O0Jig
351566,2008-09-13,0,aveqqTTutqV5tOl3_SeI8A,"Enrico Tinoco is a Mexican who has left enchilladas and nachos behind him. Leaving Mexico when he was 15, he headed for California where he trained as a chef under Italian and French maestros. Once he'd got some savings, he upped for Las Vegas to realise his dream of opening his own restaurant.
 The address, Suite 107 Charleston Boulevard, sounds classy, but is far from that. Tinoco's is little more than a shed at the end of a group of ex-industrial units in the Downtown area of Las Vegas. The area is slowly being converted to a retail district, and Tinoco's is next door to an arts complex where budding painters and sculptors have a small commune of galleries.


 Do not be deterred by the appearance or location. Inside, you will find a comfortable, friendly, 2-roomed bistro, bustling with life and filled with the aromas of good cooking. The walls are crammed with prints, paintings and mixed-media artworks provided by the neighbouring artists, all with price tags on them. Enrico gets a commission if one is sold. Seating is a mixture of banquettes and comfortable chairs. The floor is overlaid with wooden tiles of random size, made from old brandy casks bought by Enrico in California; he made the tiles himself, and says that when they were new the rooms were imbued with a lovely scent of brandy-aged oak. Now they have an aging patina and provide a feature which is quite unique.


 And so to the food. American favourites such as chowder, salads, pastas, chops and lobster have been given the Mediterranean treatment by Enrico. His light touch and deft seasoning transform staple dishes into culinary delights. There is a strong Italian influence and the pasta is superb, with innovative dishes such as Penne with Smoked Salmon, Asparagas and Pink Vodka.


 I had Crab-stuffed Shrimp over risotto with grilled vegetables in a lemon butter sauce. I almost wept with joy. A word about these Shrimps: for what we call shrimps (which could in no way ever be stuffed because they are so small), the Americans provide Jumbo Scampi, whopping 5-inchers straight out of the Pacific.


 The wine list contains well-priced wines from California, Europe and South America, from $15-$50. Expect to pay $6-$10 for your appetizers, $12-25 for your mains.


 Nearly all Enrico's staff are ex-pat Mexicans, several of whom have been with him since he started. We were fortunate to be served by Janet and Veronica, two of the best waitresses I have encountered. Everyone was so friendly. Enrico himself came out of the kitchen after we'd finished, and spent 5 minutes talking food,answering our questions, and giving a potted history of his career.


 We were the last to leave, that lunchtime. We asked for a cab to be called; Enrico said we have a special cab here. Next thing, he pulled up outside in his car and drove us back to The Strip, chatting animatedly all the way about cooking. He wouldn't dream of accepting a few dollars for the service.

They give you a wonderful roll with it, and it is such a yummy lunch. The atmosphere is so nice, with local art work hanging on their walls and cozy booths to share a long lunch. 
Get the Niscoise salad, the steak sammie, or any of their yummy pastas, they are amazing!! Don't forget to stroll around the arts factory after!",ko06Ptkr1YtZWR6FIDqubA,0,0,4,0TkP9Ct6kTgnFiK3fhVkaw
2533883,2007-03-29,1,aveqqTTutqV5tOl3_SeI8A,"One time my friends and I decided to splurge a little on First Friday and made reservations at Tinoco's Bistro.  Although it's dinner menu was a little out of my price range, I enjoyed the meal immensely and didn't feel badly at all for doing it.

The atmosphere was wonderful - a darker, warm, intimate environment with original works of art decorating the walls.  You definitely know you're in the Arts Factory.

We got the dungeness crab cakes ($11) for an appetizer and they were delicious.  They were crispy and creamy and the crab was fresh, the bell pepper sauce accompanying it gave it a delightful bit of spice.    I had the lobster ravioli ($18) for my entree and it was scrumptious.  It comes with a shrimp, garlic, and wine sauce and I embarrassingly devoured it.  They were offering a lobster bisque that day and I sampled it from one of my fellow diners and he would only let me have one bite although I wanted more, it was so good.

A vegetarian friend of mine asked if a pasta dish that was traditionally served with chicken could be prepared without.  When his meal arrived, it had chicken in it, but they quickly made him a completely new dish.  That was the only snag in the meal.

Recommended, especially for a top off to First Friday.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,1,4,fOtmlhDpRX4F0haDkXaiRQ
4180500,2007-08-12,1,aveqqTTutqV5tOl3_SeI8A,"I went to this place tonight after having read a review about it in City Life (one of Las Vegas' local newsletters) and was surprised to find that I had driven past the restaurant at least a dozen times but never noticed it till now.  If you see the exterior, you can probably understand why.  The building the restaurant is housed in looks more like a warehouse or factory than a fine dining place.  When we were about to walk in, my girlfriend asked me if we were gonna get mugged once we opened the door, but surely enough, a wonderful ambiance greeted us.  

Both the exterior and interior walls are made of red bricks.  The tables are definitely artsy, they are shaped like little water color easels, with the easel holes holding the salt and pepper! There are art works by local artists on the alls, in fact, we sat next to a wonderful portrait painting of Oscar Goodman (the city mayor).  

Once we got seated, we took a look at the menu which had so many delicious items that it was hard to know which one to pick exactly.  I ended up picking the Seafood Trio, which had halibut, scallops, and shrimp on top of risotto.  The dish was excellent and was plated beautifully.  In addition, the free bread was tasty (not sure what kind of herbs they had in it but it sure was good) and the lentil soup that I had was a perfect appetizer. 

I'm definitely glad we found this place, Las Vegas is hardly known for its fine eating outside of the Strip and definitely is not known for any non-chain restaurants.  Tinoco's Bistro is a breath of fresh air in the city; it's also right in the arts district in Las Vegas so be sure to take some time to walk around and visit some of the art galleries and such.",jpFSVpCaegVGEYlB9sOMNQ,3,1,5,NBhl7eNtziC5xpJbHVtaqA
4286942,2008-07-16,2,aveqqTTutqV5tOl3_SeI8A,"This was only the second time I've been here. Both times were during the lunch hour. 

Tinoco's is a tiny little restaurant. I love the intimacy of it. The piping and ventilation that jut out of the walls give it character, as my friend would say. That and the tables shaped like giant paint palettes and the menus with the paint brush and clear acrylic medium varnish all go with the whole shabby chic art thing they got going on. But I don't really like the cramped quarters. 

Tinoco's in one of those places where I can ponder over the menu for a long time and not know what to get because it all looks good. 

Our waiter was really helpful. At first when we asked him what items he liked best, he said, ""Its all good."" Not helping. But then he started listing off all of the items he liked. Which was like, half the menu. He also told us the specials. Convinced me to get the special of the day: orange roughy and halibut in a lobster sauce over spinach and mashed potatoes ($21). Mm mm. So good, make me wanna slap yo' mama. 

Some of the other things he recommended were the Lobster Ravioli ($14), Nicoise salad, Capelinni Checca ($10), and the Cilantro Jalapeno shrimp ($14). They all sounded good. And I totally could've justified ordering more than one entree. They serve a lot of fish dishes. Salmon, orange roughy, mahi mahi, and more salmon. All of their pastas look really good. I almost got the Al Vodka ($14) because al vodka is always good. 

My friend got the ""Lighty Cajun"" Salmon salmon salad ($13; sic on the quotes, I'm not a grammartard) which she really liked. 

We both loved the bread, too. Sometimes the bread can be the deal breaker. In this case, the bread was a great way to kick off the meal and leave our mouths watering for more. It wasn't hard bread. My friend even asked for extra bread to take home after the meal. The waiter gave her SIX hunks of delicious bread. 

I totally could've taken leftovers home, but I horked it all down.

I know two people had rated it about 1 star and had horrible experience but we decided to go and try it out. I am glad we did, it was one of THE best places we had in Las Vegas!!! We are from Houston, TX and there are tons of food and great places there (from high end to low end) so it was hard to find something unusual and different and something that was ""different"". The food (dinner) and service we received was awesome. The flourless-chocolate-cake melted in your mouth and was by far one of the best deserts we had there. We will be definitely be going back when we return to LVN.",cSRWEjCu95PaiZQMhufXHA,0,0,5,bct2wEq7yf-I6wbRAx8JAQ

My wife and I split the crab and corn chowder that everyone raves about on Yelp and it was very good.  I am not so into the cream based soups but I enjoyed it.  My wife loved it.  We went with the lobster ravioli and Orange Roughy in lobster curry sauce.  Both entrees were excellent.  I even enjoyed the bread which I think was a pesto/cilantro baked bread.  

Anyways..cool atmosphere, great menu, friendly staff blah blah blah JUST GO.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,3,2,5,22d5URErcwtFXxdbq7BpeQ
