Picked this place from the reviews here on Yelp. I am not sure if my wife and I caught them on a bad day, but the food is NOT worth the price. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and my wife ordered Mushroom Ravioli. My meal, while appetizing, was  not worth the $28 they were charging. As for my wife's meal, I do not know how she was able to eat what she did. I tasted a sample of her meal and found the mushrooms were slimy in texture and simply gross tasting. She left half of her $21 dinner on the plate. The only positive thing to comment on would be the service. The staff was very attentive and polite. Unfortunately, good service will NOT bring us back to Sergio's. Good luck to those who try Sergio's. I hope your experience was better than ours.",mv1D2EFo7vHA2sbBo1neRg,0,0,1,gkZ4dgXrpkePVDUzJeqLBg

We found this location through Yelp and the reviews did not lie. We were so happy to take a trip off of the strip for what we were provided. It's a beautiful restaurant with lovely people working.

The only reason I did not give it a five is because I had the feeling that we were keeping them from closing. We arrived at about 8:45pm and while the food did not take an overly long time to be prepared, we didn't finish until around 10. We also had to wait for a cab back to the strip. They seemed like they were in a hurry and cleared our table the moment we finished with our glass, plate, fork, etc. While I appreciate their attention, it was just a little too much for me.

But once again, it was a great find off of the strip and the people working there were very helpful and friendly, especially Herb. He was our waiter and made sure we were taken care of.",i4P5n_c58VwuGE_iD17y7w,0,0,4,gKH9xtix8FSYbF1FMLfDRw
60250,2016-08-04,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"My wife an I went here a couple of weeks ago. The Italian place we were going wasn't open so this was a last minute change. This is really a review of the staff more than the food, to be honest I cant recall the quality of the meal, probably due to the awful experience. There were only 2 other groups in the restaurant. Our waiter was completely clueless when it came to the wine. We ordered a Zinfandel and a Shiraz, I think there was only one of each on the wine list. Our waiter arrived at our table with two glasses of white wine. When we pointed out no one has ordered white he proceeded to try to convince us that one of was a white Zinfandel... no such thing on the wine list and White Zin is rose colored anyway.

On a  second attempt the waiter came back with 2 glasses of red, chilled and sweet. I think it was port and both glasses were the same thing. Again nothing like Shiraz or Zin. By now our meals had been served and we had given up on wine. In the end we did get what I think was the correct wine towards the end of the meal after we asked the waiter bring the bottles.

I have no problem with the waiter not knowing his wines, as long as he admits it, but being treated like a complete idiots was incredibly offensive. We will never be back.",m3y21k_t3_bhexwjkRlDFQ,0,0,1,z8LDPhEv2XYp2kgypgz4cg

216611,2013-12-10,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"After several days of business meetings in Vegas, my boss selected Sergio's as the venue for our team celebration dinner last Friday night. Our group included a total of 10 people, and although we did not make a reservation until Friday afternoon, Sergio's was very accomodating. They quickly and kindly responded to my email inquiry, confirming our reservation. Their website mentions that they provide complimentary transportation to and from the strip, so I called to make an arrangement with the driver. The gentleman who answered the call said that they typcially require 24-hours' notice for shuttle pickups, but that he would do his best to have one of the servers help us, which he did. I got a phone call about 15 minutes before our reservation from Herb, our server, saying that he would be waiting for us at our hotel valet stop. When we met him there, he was all politeness and good humor, joking with us as he helped us into the van that the restaurant uses as a shuttle. A short drive away from the strip (I think it was between 5 and 10 minutes), we arrived at Sergio's and Herb welcomed us warmly to the lovely dining room. Another gentleman (also very welcoming) ushered us to our seats at a long table that they had set perfectly and placed near the piano, at which a pianist sat and played beautifully throughout the evening. Although the place was not very crowded, it still felt cozy and intimate. It was absolutely spotless in terms of cleanliness; the decor and ambience were truly charming, with real candles lit on every table in use. The menus provided an abundance of delicious options for our meal, but Herb himself recommended a Seafood Pasta dish and the Oso Buco (which apparently they make in house over a course of 5 hours). My boss (a very well-traveled man, who has a refined palate and deep appreciation for high-quality food) ordered the Seafood Pasta and told me afterwards that it was not only the highlight among all his meals that week in Vegas, but also one of the best dishes he had ever enjoyed in his life. That compliment meant a great deal coming from him, especially after a week full of outstanding meals, in addition to bread, appetizers, and salad immediately preceeding our entrees at Sergio's. The bread disappeared very quickly, and the appetizers themselves could have been our dinner. We ordered the fried calamari (which Herb quite rightly called the best in town), the sauteed calamari (another recommendation from Herb), and the grilled vegetables platter that came with prosciutto and tomato with mozzarella. Everything was positively mouth-watering. My personal favorite was the sauteed calamari with its phenomenal sauce that was savory without being overly salty. The grilled vegetables were also perfectly done, such that the smoke and heat served to enhance all of the inherent flavors rather than overwhelm them. Everyone enjoyed each dish immensely and already began to wonder whether we would be able to finish our meals. When the house salads that came with every entree arrived, they were the ideal light and crisp interlude between the appetizers and main dishes. I would usually skip the house salad, which tends to be boring and flavorless at many restaurants, but this one was actually good enough to stand alone. I would recommend it as an entree for someone looking for a small portion / low-calorie option with plenty of taste to it. When the table was once again clear (which the servers did a fantastic job of throughout the evening - and our water glasses were never empty), Herb and several other servers brought out our entrees all at once (so we did not have to sit waiting for anyone while the dishes that came out first got cold). We were all thrilled with our choices. My dish, Pollo alla Marchigiana, was absolutely excellent. The chicken and eggplant were tender and juicy, and the sauce was so addictive that I ended up dipping the carrots and broccoli that came as a side on the plate into every last drop of it. The plate also came with a small piece of polenta, which I had never tried before, but was good (if not quite as amazing as the rest of the meal). Some green beans and a peeled, boiled potato remained uneaten on my plate, as I was simply too full to finish everything. After the table was clear once more (albeit littered with several to-go boxes), Herb cheerfully asked if we had saved room for dessert and showed us a tray of their dessert choices. We all deeply regretted that we had not saved room, because they all looked sinfully good. My colleagues who had ordered Herb's specialty, a Pomegranate Martini, also thought those were fantastic. While Herb drove us back to our hotel, he continued to joke with us and gave us some knowledgeable recommendations about shows to see and nightclubs to visit. The next time we make a trip to Vegas, you can be sure that we will revisit Sergio's with pleasure and ask for Herb in particular.",AyiU_jhvSYm0asLsb52rRQ,0,0,5,wekGAi_BQ4_KHPsQxjWE5Q

Much different ambiance than the pasta shop bur there was a nice waiter who looked like a cross between John waters and Johnny Depp. They had several specials as well as an extensive menus and the waiter said they could make things like fettucine Alfredo. My husband opted for that and I had lobster ravioli. The meals came with salad or soup although you had to pay extra to upgrade to Caesar salad. The salads were great and quite big. The meals were also delicious although the salad plus the entree was too much food. Our total bill was $60 which seemed like a fair price.

Likes: 
- the bread was awesome and the butter was of the chain.  I think it has some basil in it.  It was simple italian with nothing extravagant.
- The waiter was very tentative and filled my boyfriend's glass of water probably 10 times.  He drinks a lot of water.
- the Lasagna was cheesy and meaty just how I like it.  It was well balanced and well-seasoned

Dislikes: 
-  Looking at the website turned it off for me.  They need to take it down a notch as it wasn't the most impeccable italian food I've ever eaten.

That being said, I would go back for lunch but don't think I'd be willing to pay the dinner prices for what I ate....",YUNzd4DX-KpCRWyLQ0WmtQ,1,0,3,BVqvUQ0-7b_7_lzxKEdQ8A

Bartender had issues making standard drinks so i suggest keeping it simple. The pesto butter and bread was the highlight of the meal!! I could sit there and eat that all day, but everything after that was just ok. My wife's veal was chewy and they were reluctant to take it back since she didn't like it. I asked if my dish came with pasta which they said it did, but then it came without. After being there for so long I didn't feel like waiting for it. Meatball appetizer was good, but should have had more meatballs for the price. Overall the experience was weird which I have a hard time putting into words.

It was later than I usually eat dinner, but not that late.  It was also Wednesday night, not exactly the busiest of nights in the restaurant business, so the place was nearly deserted.  Service was good and attentive--anything less would have been very noticeable.

The bread was good, chewy, almost-sourdough served with pesto butter, light on the pesto.  Nice enough.  The salads were iceberg salads with some tomato and carrot and onion on them and what I think may have been a honey dijon dressing.  Since I don't like salads with lots of ""stuff"" in them, I was perfectly happy with mine.  I didn't taste my companion's entree--he had the bracciole (sp?) and enjoyed it. 

But it's my tortellini entree--just cheese tortellini in a cream sauce with pancetta, that is why I rate this place a four.  Let me tell you--it's a cardiologist's nightmare.  I could almost feel my arteries hardening with the first bite.  The cream sauce was rich, thick, and absolutely to die for.  The pancetta made it salty, so for a salt-lover like me (and fortunately I have doctor's orders to eat more salt--honest!), it was perfection.  The only negative thing I have to say about the tortellini in cream sauce is that it's so rich and satisfying that I didn't want dessert afterwards.",V33eN85b4PvAsPIQRaaecg,1,0,4,MNA5jLlWDK0jB1UZhH-LbA

My husband and I stopped here as an alternative to another spot that wasn't yet open. We first checked Yelp before going in, since the ""shopping strip"" vibe had us scared. The recent Yelp reviews all said the food was good, so we trusted in Yelp's reviewers and gave it a try. When we entered the restaurant, there wasn't anyone else there, but since they just opened, we figured that's why we were the only ones there. 

We were greeted by Francesco who was our server. He was very friendly and made us feel welcome. He described the specials of the day, which were the osso bucco and the seafood chepine. Both were outstanding. The osso bucco was out of this world  (and huge!) with a delicious ragu sauce, and al dente linguine. The seafood chepine was all seafood; there was no pasta, just loads of clams, muscles, shrimp, scallops, calamari and fish. Both dishes could have fed two poeple! The only downside was that the osso bucco was  $52 and the seafood chepine was $50. We didn't expect the specials to cost so much. I guess we should have asked about the cost prior to placing our order! The specials came with your choice of a (large) side salad or a soup. We opted for the house salad which came with a lovely ginger dressing. We also ordered the beef carppacio as an appetizer (good!). Despite the need to take home half of each of our meals, Francesco offered the desert tray (which looked amazing!!) but I had no room left for desert. Francesco also provided after-dinner aperitifs which was such a nice gesture! 

We were probably there for about an hour and 20 minutes, and we were taken care of so nicely. The food was amazing! I just recommend verifying the price before ordering.

I had the lasagna and the pasta was perfect; I couldn't stop from eating the whole thing and had no room for dessert.

Our waiter, John, was super nice, helpful with choices and paid just the right amount of attention. Even though the runners made a slight gaff (brought our entrées before our salads) it's not going to stop me from giving them five stars.

We got out for $50 each sans tip; you can easily go much higher if you order a couple bottles of wine and some of the pricier meat dishes, which approach the $30 range. Pasta dishes are under $20, appetizers around $15.",Yqj3V5EoZfMlKHQIOgCHyw,3,1,5,v2qs7hTBmE5tq0tuJE8kxA

Bread was served, I did not try it, but nary a crumb remained.  

Service was quite attentive, water glasses were refilled, plates cleared and the offer of more wine was made to those imbibing the house Pinot Grigio. They let us sit and chat over coffee and did not rush us out the door.

First I want to say we were a party of 7 and there was a 2 top that was there and a 8 top that already had their food. 

Food: Last time I checked there weren't potatoes in Minestrone soup. However my vegetable soup (Minestrone) had decent flavor, not very many vegetables. My husband had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari)... he ate it all no complaint. My cousin had some Angel Hair Pasta dish, one bite pushed it aside and wouldn't take another bite. What kind of waiter doesn't inquire what is the matter? (she was worried about sending food back) My friend said the meatballs had good flavor. Another said the Veal Parmesan was really salty. 
Service: There was a guy, I think he was the Busser, he had a pony-tail. He was very helpful and ran his tail off. We waited a really long time for our food. It did warn us on our menu that the food takes awhile  because it's made to order... I get that, but it was longer than I have EVER waited. Our Waiter was not very helpful and only saw him 2 times... he took our order and brought our check. (I will get to that later)

Beverages: House Cabernet at 9.00 a glass... I probably could have bout the case at Costco for that price.  Not the most generous pour, then again why would I want more of it. My husband and another gentleman had 6 beers (total)  54.00 before tax and tip. There are no prices on their beer selection. 

Now this is where the real issue comes in... 

They do not have a computer, so the writing on the check is really messy. If we didn't try to separate our check ourselves we wouldn't have noticed that they charged us for 8 meals instead of 7. He took the check and counted the meals on the check and then pointed his finger as if a teacher in pre-school counting the 7 of us. I think I can count, he served us, he should know how many of us there was. I am hoping it was an accident. My issue is that he only brought out 7 plates... he didn't even bring us 8. So I am questioning his honesty. Then he deducted the 24.00 for the mistake from the total. I had to ask him to deduct the tip and tax for the meal also. 

Bottom line, if one of the guys that he gave the check to just slapped down his credit card without looking the waiter could have pocketed another 26.50, besides that 51.00 he got for the tip that was added in. 

Service was terrible,  Most of the food not worth they money. Atmosphere was super quite and dreary. I found this place on Yelp, I am very disappointed fellow Yelpers!!!!",_PAHAWo7DfqLuiziXVvteA,8,1,1,ikg2fO1AFzSgrO9cydpWOg

FOOD:  I had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari) in a special sauce over linguini.  This is probably the best pasta dish I've had in a long time.  It was not only incredibly flavorful but the seafood was fresh, just enough sauce and a very large portion.  Pricey at $38 but well worth the price.  The others in my group had Eggplant with Chicken, Veal Picatta, and a beef dish but can't remember what it was.  Everyone was especially pleased.  
The salad came with what the owner/waiter described as one of the best creamy Italian dressings in town.  He was absolutely right.  Don't miss the fresh, and perfectly dressed salad with a dressing to die for!!

SERVICE:  Okay here's where it goes downhill.  We like having a leisurely drink before ordering but we had to wait, not only to order when we were ready, but for our dinners to be served because there was a party of 15 in the back room that obviously got top priority.  Not a big deal for us but we did wait a very long time.  

AMBIENCE:  Not  a particularly warm and cozy place but nicely decorated . Our party had to put their jackets back on because it really was cool in there and the waiter said the a/c was not on.  However the temp aside it is not what you'd call an intimate atmosphere.  
The food more than makes up for it so put on a sweater, save the romance for later and get yourself to Sergio's for an excellent dining experience.

I was the only local in the bunch with the rest from Dallas.  Sergio's sent a van to pick everyone up at the hotel which was great to say the least!  Dinner was absolutely superb, with appetizers, entrees, dessert, wine, drinks, coffee, being nothing but the freshest and  finest!  The food was so fresh and light in taste, not heavy like most Italian.  Absolutely delicious!  AND, the service.  What can I say about the service?  Outstanding!  We were so well taken care of, even when more and more wine was poured and things got a little louder.  We were celebrating about 5 birthdays!  Needless to say, Sergio's ranks right up there with the finest restaurants in Vegas and I hope everyone gives them a try.

3238361,2015-03-05,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"Saturday night spur of the moment. heard some decent reviews on this restaurant. We had stopped at casa di amore which is down the street but that's another story in itself. As we arrived there was waiting staff smoking a cigarette outside. As we walked in there was a piano player playing live music. The décor is pretty tacky with the blue sky and clouds trying to make it feel like your in venice. We weren't greeted by a hostess and really weren't greeted at all. The waiter simply grabbed two menus and waived us over. We sat down, we could hear a loud party in the back. It took about 8 mins until our waiter showed up. When he did; he did not go over the specials all he said was are you ready and looked at us. So we ordered chicken marsala and cheese raviolis. Tryna play it safe as the service has been horrible up to this point. You get offered a soup and salad. Bread was served, the pesto butter was very nice along with the hot bread. Nothing really bad to say about the food. Ive had a lot better and worse. The veggies along with the marsala were soaked in butter. Other than that marsala was spot on. As we finished up another waiter asked if we were done because we had been sitting there for so long. He brought 2 boxes over to put our food in and looked at us with his hand out as we boxed our own food. Now if we could only get that check. That literally took about 25 minutes as we sat there; now keep in mind I can see our waiter at the front talking to another waiter. Oh wait, cherry on top, as my lady had to get up and ask for the check; it ended up being hand written. Good thing I pay cash cause I could immediately get up and leave. As for the couple across from me they were very patient waiting up to 35 minutes with credit card in hand. Not sure how they ring up a credit card when they have no hostess no register no pos system. Maybe they take their phones from their pocket and swipe it. Nonetheless Ill never go back here and it had nothing to do with the food. The service was absolutely horrid. They should be ashamed to open up. If there were no stars that's what id rate them. The food is about 2.5 stars. Id rather go to olive garden at least they will greet me right.",6WpmSCTUGV6W7v01TWp9Sw,0,0,1,r6CzGZN4AaGaDdFenu3uCg

From the outside, Sergio's looks like it would be an extremely casual neighborhood Italian joint. The kind of place with painted white drywall with huge posters of pizzas on the wall, maybe a TV in the corner playing whatever sports game is on. However, when you go enter the restaurant, it looks SUPER nice inside. Very deceiving.

After Mom and I walked in, we were seated by our waitor Francisco. He took our drink order, and brought out a delicious basket of bread with garlic butter and parmesan cheese. The bread tasted so good, we chowed down on two baskets of it.

He took our order not too long after. I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese, and Mom ordered the Chicken Parmesan. The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the sly way Francisco asked if we wanted soup or salad with our meal. He made it sound free, though it was actually $2.99 to add it with an entree. I declined, but Mom ordered the salad...which she said was actually pretty good.

The food came, and the Rigatoni Bolognese was AMAZING. The veal could really be tasted in the sauce, which was plentiful on the plate, but not so overwhelming that the pasta dissapeared.

The Chicken Parmesan was wonderful at well. The meat was tender and cut easily, and the ample helping of spaghetti that came with it didn't hurt either.

Just from these two dishes alone, we were completely stuffed. The cannolis sounded appetizing...but I just couldn't imagine eating anything more that day.

Everyone needs to get over the strip mall thing, it is normal out here! Décor was so-so, painted ceiling and fake flowers are not my thing. The piano player started at 7:00 and he was pretty good!

The staff was pleasant, the bar had no bar tender on a Monday (wait staff were playing bartender and watching the soccer game). We seemed to have a switch in waiters at some point but were not notified - yet the original waiter did come back with the check.

We eat early. We ordered the steamed clams as an appetizer. They were fabulous! Both has the house salads with the house Italian dressing. Also good!

My husband order the Veal Marcela, it smelled fabulous the veggies (carrots, green beans and potatoes looked great. The carrots were good, green beans were a bit chewy, potatoes were OK. He is not a polenta fan so he did not try that. The veal had great flavor, for him it was a bit chewy.

I ordered a linguini pasta with calamari, shrimp, scallops, squid and clams. This was great, the scallops especially were something I wanted more of.

The Chianti we ordered was very good and the Tiramisu was fabulous (it was enough to feed three!).

For the price of the meal ($165.00 including the tip), if locals are not interested in going to the strip, it is good.

3448651,2017-01-30,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"My wife and I went there Saturday night January 28 and could not believe the situation.
We had people waiting to be seated in front of us for lord knows how long. almost every table was occupied. They also had large parties in their back rooms. The three tables not occupied the people had left, but there was no one to bus the tables. There were only two waiters attending to all these people in the whole restaurant. No one to bartend or seat people as they arrived. Only the two waiters doing it all. It was the most insane situation I have ever encountered in a restaurant. All the diners were pissed off. As we watched. The people at the large table to our left had to keep getting up and going to the bar to get the waiter. The people in front of us finally got seated and waited so long without even a menu. They finally got up and left. Then a party of four finally had dinners arrive at their table and it was the wrong dinners. They all got up and left. The poor waiters kept running around apologizing to everyone. After a half hour of this and still standing there, we left. Every table looked absolutely livid.
I have been to Sergio's many time prior to this. These waiters are very nice people, good service and the food is always excellent. 
Whoever dropped the ball on staffing Saturday should be fired and if its the owner trying to save on payroll by understaffing, he is very foolish. We watched $500 worth of business walk out the door in a half hours time.
   I am praying this was a fluke and not the new norm. When we usually go, there are maybe 3-5 tables dining. So they just could not handle the business. The cook must have been overwhelmed. People kept complaining about the food not getting out. 
The restaurant like I said is always excellent, so we will give them another chance, but a few more incidents like this and they will force us to look for an alternative",5jnRp88e8fpM2c73tkMe2A,0,0,1,J9WyHovbFeFHRtRfQ_JFyA

The food was GREAT!   I make Oso Buco at home and have never had it better so I don't order it in restaurants but my dining partner did and raved.  My veal was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  No flaws from this foodie.

I was really really surprised giving the ""unassuming"" exterior to have such a good meal... but honestly, the waiter was so good with his timing, humor and just general fun that's what made the meal.   He brought us some sort of dessert wine I can't remember.  Sounded italian anyway!  It was good but very different flavor than I've had before and photobombed me with a glass in hand as he was tasting it with us.

But when the bill came, *Que Nightmare on Elm Street Music* everything changed. First of all, we were informed by the manager John, that we were going to have to wait until the entire restaurant cleared out before we could get a ride back to the Strip. If that was actually printed on their website/pamphlet I could maybe understand. 

To make matters worse, when we attempted to use a Groupon to pay for a portion of the meal, DENIED.  Our gracious host John thought we were yanking his chain since we didn't have a printed copy. Forget that we showed him on the phone that this wasn't necessary, forget that the printed copy he had said the same thing. 

I realize that my review should be based on the quality of food and value as well but service is huge and when you don't treat your customers right the other two get thrown out the window.

We came in for lunch and right away were greeted by Francisco. He told us he had worked there since the restaurant opened in 1993. We confided that we had  last been there in 1997 and had had a wonderful meal. Francisco made sure that same experience was duplicated. He recommended the Caesars salad which we found to be delicious, fresh snapping romaine, shaved parmesan, and the dressing was delicious.
I ordered the Pollo alla Parmigiana. This was a chichen breast sautted in a Pinot Grigio wine sauce with mushrooms, caper and lemon. The sauce was outstanding. It was simply delicious.
My wife ordered the Linguine with clams and clam sauce. We have found it very difficult to find a restaurant who prepares this dish well. Aside from Carmine's in Pasadena.  I have to say that Sergio's rendition was even better than Carmine's. Here again, the sauce was flavorful and delicious.

The decor is very ""fancy"" so I was put off a bit at first, wearing a T-Shirt and Jeans to a place with antique furniture and fancy water glasses. I was put at ease when I saw another couple sit nearby wearing casual clothing.

I opened the menu, dreading the high prices that normally accompany fancy water glasses, only to find very reasonable prices! I selected the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli and a Caesar Salad. Both were delightful and the waiter was very attentive and friendly. He may have been faking the Italian accent, but it was a pretty good one, so I won't fault him for it.

I suspect this may be a bigger hit for a romantic dinner with your loved one. I just wanted some quick quality pasta for lunch and the Ravioli was definitely better than I expected. The pasta itself was tender and perfectly cooked. The mushrooms were fresh and pungent. The cheese accented them wonderfully. The cream sauce --that I suspect had a marsala base-- linked it all together like a ribbon on a present.

I left full, happy, and a little surprised. Despite the upscale decor and excellent service, this place has very good food for a good price!",SDyz2f2Su7-wx0wxjkIb5g,0,0,4,YLvhJhcIJXLCY-9qfAyQhw

The inside of the restaurant is a beautiful, old world design, complete with pillars; it made me feel as if we were in Italy.  I was sorry to see that it was nearly empty at prime dinner hour, but then saw it quickly populated by two different Japanese tour groups; the first headed to a back room and the second group sat in the main dining room.  (Aside:  They were NOT given menus, which is why I never travel on tours!).

Our waiter, Wes, was excellent.  Oh, he was a bit too pushy on the upsell, but then again, our friends were served the lower-priced chardonnay when they ordered without realizing there were two differently-priced ones to choose from.  Wes obviously has been at the restaurant for quite a while; his presentation of the specials was polished, and his service was wonderful without being intrusive.

All four of us ordered chicken dishes, all different.  I had the Marchegiana, which had roasted red peppers and mozzarella in a light orange-colored wine sauce.  My husband had Marsala, and it was covered with an abundance of dark, earthy mushrooms.  The other hubby, Mr. Unadventurous, stuck with his usual Chicken Parmegiana.  He has special blinders that let him see only that dish on the menu, and this time he had no complaints.  His wife ordered a lemon chicken dish; she liked it, but pronounced it a little too lemony.  Um, maybe that's why they call it Lemon Chicken?

A good, crusty bread, made in-house, was served with a delicious pesto butter.  I would have preferred it in the usual baguette style, instead of the thin loaf-like slices, but it tasted great anyway.

The grand piano was put to good use by a player who's been around since before the Mob.  Happily, it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation, so it definitely enhanced the experience.

My major complaint is that, like so many other restaurants, the prices on their website are not updated, so it was an unwelcome surprise to see them all $3-4 higher than posted online, though still moderate by Vegas standards.  But with the discount, it was still reasonable for a wonderful meal with great service in a classy setting.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,3,5,zm5gaVmWFUisfpwVAyOGRQ

Anyway, we recently moved to this side of town so we are determined to find all the little hidden gems in our new neighborhood. Sergio's is one of these gems!!

We went on a Sunday night. We were seated right away. The service was a bit old Vegas, but very prompt. Everything is cooked to order, so it is a bit slower than a lot of places. 

They have a piano player!! He was really great and he plays a lot of contemporary songs...so we had fun naming that tune. One of the best parts of our visit!!

They have a decent sized wine list. I had a glass of Malbec. You can choose soup or salad with your meal. The warm bread and pesto butter were fantastic.

We both ordered 2 pretty basic pasta dishes - a Rigatoni with a meat sauce and a Penne with tomatoes, garlic, basil, & mozzarella. Both came out piping hot and delicious. Honestly, I was surprised at how fresh everything tasted.

For dessert we shared a flan. Normally, this is a favorite of mine, but the sauce was more orange liqueur than caramel which I didn't know ahead of time so I didn't love it the way I normally do.

The bill was $61 plus tip for 2 people.

4543077,2015-12-28,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"My name is Ro, and I am writing this review on my husband's account because he has a Yelp account and we went to Sergios together last night. 

I have been a customer of Sergios for almost nine years. In that time I have always received excellent service and excellent quality in the food. Last night, however, things were very different. Yesterday was my step daughter's 15th birthday. My husband, his ex-wife and myself always take her out to eat a special dinner on her birthday. This year she wanted to try something different and go to Sergios. We had a reservation for 5pm and when we were seated, the staff started to struggle almost immediately. We were greeted by Francisco who took our drink orders and read us the specials. As soon as Francisco left, another staff member came to ask us for our drinks, we told him we had already been asked for our beverage orders by someone else. That staff member left, and a third staff member, Herb came and asked for our drink orders again. Then we tried to browse the menu. Our two teenage daughters have never been to an Italian place that had so many non-English words on the menu before, so I was taking my time explaining everything they were asking about. The staff seemed to dislike this, as Herb, Francisco and the third staff member all came by multiple times to inform us over and over again of the specials and to try and up-sell our choices. When we did eventually order, A woman arrived with a small child who immediately began to throw a tantrum. The child was screaming and running around the dining room, at one time even climbing in and under the curtains on the window, while the mother did nothing but play on her phone and the staff did nothing about this. The child continued to run and scream for the duration of our meal while the staff continued to pretend it wasn't happening. 

At one point, my husband's ex-wife asked if she could have a straw for her water, Herb jokingly reach into our daughters Shirley Temple, removed her straw and offered it to her mother ""Here's a straw you can have right here"". This was both rude and unsanitary. 

It took a very long time for our food to come out and when it did, it did not come out all together. The waiter, Herb, came out from the kitchen and asked us our orders all over again, and then said it would be a few more minutes. Shortly thereafter, he brought out three of our meals and said the rest would be out momentarily. We did the polite thing which is to not eat and to wait until everyone at the table has been served. It was over 20 minutes before the other two people at our table were served. In that time the food on the table had gotten cold. Ordinarily, this is the precise moment when I would ask to speak to a manager, but these were special circumstances. Our daughter was having her birthday dinner and we didn't want any confrontation to become a permanent memory on her special day. So we continued with our meal. When it came time to get the check, we were brought a check for just under $100. My husband's ex-wife had a discount coupon that was good for $15 off of our meal. We gave Herb the coupon and $100 bill to cover the check. Herb takes our check and the money and disappears, reappearing moments later with a new check for over $140 dollars, saying to my husband ""I bet you didn't even notice that wasn't the right check before, this is the right check and I will take the discount off of this"". We were outraged by this, of course, but again, it was our daughter's birthday and she was more important than our desire to make a scene. It seems wrong to me, to give us one check, and then when we present a coupon, bring us another check for almost 50% more than the first check, Even if it was a genuine mistake on their part, it could have been communicated without condescending to my husband in front of his daughter on her birthday.

I am very disappointed in the service we received. Half way through our time there it really felt like the staff just sort of gave up. I literally live right across the street from the restaurant, I can see their sign from my balcony, and yet I just cannot see us ever going back there after what happened last night.",Qhs5nJ5efW3HpXTGFahXlA,5,0,1,gKAqOIJPCHYAYKfygrjihg

It is quite close to the Strip especially if you are staying at Luxor or Mandalay Bay.  

Because it was a Saturday night around 7:30pm I was worried that with it's solid Yelp four star rating it would be too busy.    When I walked in I was shocked to see the restaurant only 20% full with perhaps a dozen or so diners.    I was a little worried that maybe it wouldn't be what I hoped.  

I was seated and asked a couple that was leaving what they would recommend, they said the Cioppino which is off of the menu.   They also said it doesn't matter what you order because it is all amazing.      Being that I wasn't in a Cioppino mood I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with a Meatball appetizer.  To accompany the meal I had a glass of Chianti.    

All of the food was delicious as promised, honestly some of the best Italian food I have ever tasted.     

My only hesitation is that the service was super slow.   It took 15 minutes to get the wine list that I asked for.   It was another 20 minutes until they took my order and at least 45 more for the food to arrive.   Even when I asked for the check I waited for 10 minutes to receive it.

About 2 bites away from finishing our appetizer, 15 minutes after I ordered it, my wine showed up. Next were 2 caesar salads which we each took a few bites of and were done with. The dressing was bland and the salad was overall very weak. Also, when our waiter offered us pepper on our salad, he again went to my fiance first. Our meals came out. I got the Veal Piccatta, which was actually very good. My fiance got the chicken parmigiana and a side of pasta, of which both were swimming in sauce. Now, on their menu, it says all fresh ingredients, but it is very obvious the chicken was previously frozen. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate my meal a 7 and he rated his a 3. I finished the meal with the Spumoni Gelato. Of course, not true Gelato, but it was seriously delicious. After our meal we were waiting for quite a while, while our server and the piano player chatted.

We have been here quite often, as we feel that this is some of the best Italian food in Vegas. She ordered the chicken franchisee, her favorite. I had the linguine in white wine sauce, with fried calamari as an appetizer. Her meal and the appetizer were good, but my clams were gritty. 

The downfall was the service. Absolutely horrible. 

First, the waiter took my wife's drink order. She only wanted water to start, a bottle of pana for the table. The waiter rolled his eyes, asked if we wanted an adult beverage (my wife said no, just water to start) and walked away. Never even as much as looked at me. 

Next, we ordered. My wife requested no polenta, which is only a garnish. The waiter rolled his eyes at that, asking if we knew what it was. Of course we do. She simply doesn't like it. 

My wife ordered a side of angel hair pasta. We never received it - and couldn't get it in a timely fashion. Why? Because our waiter apparently went home for the night after taking our order. Never told us. Just left. And no one else came to check on us or even bus our table. We had to call another waiter over who reluctantly grabbed her side  dish, after she was finished with her main course for quite some time. 

We requested to speak with the manager at the end. ""Sorry about that. Can I send you home with a tiramisu to make up for it?"" Was all he said. And it felt as if we were annoying him by complaining. 

Mind you, we are not demanding customers. My wife is in the service industry, and we do our best to be polite and tip well. However, neither of us have had a worse experience in recent memory. We won't be back here any time soon.",e4kdt960uouRocyhtlo6-g,14,2,1,6XGKD0mZ_tpbB_25Azr-cQ

 The crusty bread was fresh and warm, the butter chilled. The soup was good. The coffee very good. I ordered the veal parmesan which was amazing. I don't know what it is with Vegas and Italian restaurants but they always seem to skimp on the pasta? There was plenty to eat, but usually old school Italian places give enough to feed an army and you just take the rest home. But in this case it's because the veal is huge, two large pieces with fresh cheese. No cheap imitation patties in grease here, this is the good stuff. You won't go home hungry and will probably have leftovers.
The Tiramisu was over the top amazing. My aunt is gonna love it.
 I think I will have to starve for about 3 days now... it was just really that good.
 The prices are not low, but I went on a Saturday night and you do get what you pay for which is all you can ask really. So this isn't a rip off tourist place like a lot in this city are.  I assume they have lunch specials which I'll take family to when I get the chance.

We drove two miles to FERRARO'S, where they put on a demonstration of HOW YOU RUN A RESTAURANT. We had a fabulous meal while three people paid incredible attention to us. 
This place has bad management, there is no other way to put it. Somebody is NOT doing their job.
We will NOT be back, I do not support semi-pro crap like this. What a complete waste of time. The good news is that we found Ferraro's, and we will be back there!! As I said they put on a completely pro demonstration of HOW you treat customers.
Again my apologies to the chef. The food is probably ok at Sergio's. The service is AWFUL!!!!!",J66JNdu2_OR2LAHCyGULcQ,1,0,1,8gwoHe--_P1i--DY5YnqZg

One of the worst experiences and the reason my significant other hates Italian food.  The sauce was bland, pasta overcooked and the service was poor.  The cheese seemed not to be real, the only thing worth while was the bread and olive oil.  I will say the bruchetta was good, but the antipasti left something to be desired",6A5eEb9GvJyCjlPSsTQcHQ,2,1,2,aeYasVDTy5C98kECZTi6WQ

The food was excellent and the service was out of this world. They have a piano player on the weekends and he was great.  If you haven't made it here put it on your list to try and return again and again.  I will be back! .,Y0S58bu122PYUsmmI8hAdQ,0,0,5,4uCrHck2XJHa5cLoCJDKGw

When we arrived, we were the only ones there.  I don't know about you, but I hate eating at places where there is nobody there (except for the staff).  Just kind of creeps me out.
But we were greeted and seated by a nice gentleman who wished us happy anniversary and got our drinks started.  Soon the thought of eating alone quickly vanished as we were brought our drinks and delicious bread and butter.  Our waiter made a few suggestions and we started off with the beef carpacio.  This was very good, as I am a huge fan of this dish at other restaurants.
My husband ordered the fettucini alfredo and I had some sort of seafood pasta (Can't remember the exact name).  It was all delicious.  Flavors were very good and it tasted like authentic Italian food (yes I have been to Italy twice).  

When we were presented with the bill an 18% gratuity was added.  I'm not sure if I read this in the fine print of the restaurant.com certificate.  I was more than willing of course to give 20% gratuity, but I absolutely hate it when a restaurant feels the need to impose a mandatory gratuity.  This is my only gripe honestly.  The restaurant itself was very nice, dated, but nice.  It is a very intimate and inviting atmosphere and I recommend anyone on a first date, second date or 100th date to come and check this place out.",npsERTMbyKLotgpbf2Z6WQ,2,0,4,05qmlmJt8W8wHuExJSxrGw

The thing that intrigued me was it was Italian, nice atmosphere and had a classical pianist!!! The pianist makes this place unique and worth going!!!

I finally got to go this Labor Day weekend 9/4/16 and it was phenomenal!!!!

This is truly a hidden gem and I can't believe no one knows about it. Get off the strip to eat people. The food around the strip is better than what's on the strip!!!

The waiters are all super friendly, attentive, talkative, etc!!!! Some are flamboyant, so if you have a problem with that, this may not be the place for you. 

The food was amazing and they give huge portions!!!

Calamari fritti - the batter itself has great flavor!!! Doesn't really need lemon, but I love lemon anyways! Comes with a lot of sauce so you don't need to ask for extra! Super easy to eat and not chewy or fishy. Def one of the best calamari I've had.

Pollo alla marchigiana - chicken was a little chewy but the sauce was fantastic, and the veggies were a perfect addition.

Linguine seafood - not sure what it's called. It's a hidden menu item but it has clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp in a tomatoe sauce/broth with noodles... It was delicious and orgasmic!

Minestrone - was ok. Nothing special

Pasta e fagioli - was delicious and one of a kind.

Free bread - was delicious!! Especially that pesto butter they have! Yum

Spamonie - was decent. Not the best ice cream I've had. Tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer a while but it was ok.

You get a free shot of liquor after dinner too. 

The price range is 20$+ don't expect to get a meal for cheap here. But remember that the food is worth it. The quality is phenomenal and the service too.

Plus u get serenaded by a live pianist!!! Which was why we came and the highlight of the night.

5837975,2014-06-27,2,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"It was Valentine's Day, so a special menu was served.  And, it featured some fine choices.

As reported by others, the Calamari Fritti was first rate--light, neither rubbery nor tough, and served with great Pesto Butter.  Spicy Bruschetta with diced tomatoes was also excellent, followed by a very good Minestrone Soup with fresh slices of potato and grated Parmesan Cheese obtained on request.  Along with good complimentary crusty bread, these starters were followed by a topnotch Buffalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad, which was the best I have ever experienced to date, featuring ceramy Mozzarella and tomatoes on a bed of fresh organic field greens.  

As my main, an excellent 4-sheet-high and cheesy Lasagna with mild-tasting Meat Sauce sufficed nicely.  What impressed me the most was spot on seasoning applied in the kitchen to all dishes ordered.

Live piano music added to the garden-like, all table (no booths) setting.  But there was one discordant note.  Diane's Veal Alfredo had to be returned to put cheese on top, and the Alfredo Sauce melted and became deconstructed in the process.  She was given extra sauce, but it took awhile.  Service tended to be slow after initial orders were taken.

Everything considered, my meal was quite enjoyable end to end.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,3,4,pHRtEtboJvA2ESkRNB08Tw
5918800,2012-01-06,1,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"Wrapped up another class for work at MGM Grand at noon, I called Sergio's Italian Gardens to see if they will honor their dinner Groupon if I order off of their dinner menu, otherwise I would just make a dinner reservation.  I was told they would accept that and to just stop by since they are not busy right now.

10 minutes later, with the aid of the GPS, I successfully navigated my way to the restaurant, which appears to be in front of a apartment complex. Talk about mixed use-zoning being implemented a few decades ahead of its time!

Anyway, the restaurant was fairly deserted when I arrived for lunch. There were a table of 3 ladies out during lunch break to celebrate a birthday. And before I was done with my lunch, an elderly couple came in.  So if you would like to enjoy a good quiet meal during lunch, Sergio's Italian Gardens is highly recommended.

They have the best fried calamari I have had in Las Vegas. The cooks that prepared it obviously have mastered it. I would come back here for that alone!

The seafood pasta entree that I ordered off of the dinner menu was superb.  The pasta was cooked just right, garnished with generous amounts of seafood (shrimps, scallops, mussel, clams) all cooked to perfection.  Totally worth every penny.

Service was friendly, attentive and not overbearing.  My waiter was obviously an old pro, and it was a pleasure to dine here. The experience was absolutely fantastic from the moment I made the call to the moment I left.  It is an older restaurant in not the best part of Las Vegas, but it is highly recommended for locals and tourists looking for good Italian food.  It is not far from the Strip, and really close if you are staying at MGM Grand, City Center, The Cosmopolitan and Planet Hollywood.

Ambiance:  4/5 Not as great during lunch, but will likely be much better during dinner.

Decor:  4/5  Feels a bit dated, but you can't eat the mural on the wall.

Food:  5/5  Simply delicious!

Price:  4/5  Fairly priced for the quality food you are served.

Service:  5/5  With a little imagination you almost can feel you are having a fabulous Italian meal served to you at a coastal villa in southern Italy by an attentive butler.

Parking:  5/5  Plentiful during lunch, probably not an issue during dinner.

5929148,2011-07-20,0,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,"Great place for a date night or small group. Its very quiet and the few times I was there, kinda empty. But don't let that fool you. The host was very friendly and knowledgeable and the waiter was authentic Italian and made you feel like you were really in Italy. Everyone was extremely professional and friendly, and to add to that, the food is amazing.

Beef carpaccio was excellent, as well as the fresh mozzarella on the caprese! 

I came this last time with a large group (8 people) for a birthday party (which is not recommended, by me anyway) so I got to try a lot of dishes....

Capelli d'Angelo in Salsa Cruda - Very bright, fresh and light compared to some of the heavier pastas. Delicious!

Penne alla Vodka - Classic, but done right. Very flavorful.

Gnocchi alla Toscana - Oh yes!! Smooth, flavor, flavor, flavor, delicious!

Tortellini with prosciutto, mushroom & shallots - Probably my favorite!! 


Anyways, this place is pretty expensive which sucks because the decor, location, and atmosphere doesn't say ""expensive"". Get a certificate from Restaurant.com to relieve some wallet stress.",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,1,0,4,HYDmhAR3z7BXkZCOE8Gnwg
