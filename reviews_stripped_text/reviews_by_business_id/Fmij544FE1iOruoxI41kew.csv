1. Got a 1/2 lb. burger and added avocado, cheese, and sautéed mushrooms. Holy mother of God people. It was the best burger I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. The burger was fresh the ingredients were fresh and the fries was seasoned perfectly. 

2. The owner was amazing. He came out and talked to us and gave us, what he calls, ""American Churros"" on the house. These American Churros are delicious deep fried Oreos with just enough cinnamon on top for you to say, ""Damn, these are seriously American Churros. So fitting!"" 

3. The owner made the effort to bring us our food and treat us with care. He engaged with us and we had a lovely conversation. You can really tell he loves what he does with every bite. 

This place is a little shack under a billboard, it doesn't look like much at all but you will be slapped in the face with surprise once you eat here.

It's made with pork and hamburger meat, so I think that's why it wasn't so juicy. Also, it was just stiff, which was strange, but I think it was the addition of the pork that made it like that..

The open-faced sandwiches are my pick, with mesquite-grilled meats and fresh buns from Bon Bakery- the chicken so far is a favorite, adding mushrooms and cheese. Manager insisted that adding an egg was a great way to up the wow factor, and I totally agree. Avocado and jalapeno are other add-ons to consider but keep in mind that this dish is a monster of a mess and a huge portion.

The hot dogs are a lesser draw for me, but also good- props for offering pork and beef options, served dressed with coleslaw, onions, tomatoes potato strings, and sauce. It's good but not my preferred dish here- looking forward to more sandwiches though, particularly the fish version!

Service was quick and friendly. It can be a bit difficult to hear staff inside the booth, but the increased bar-style seating makes up for that- belly up and get your grub on!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,20,4,C8FWBLfOx3EddwjMqlQ15g

Okay, so onto the main course. The pepito was good. Worth the late afternoon trip. Around 3pm, There was no line, plenty of parking, and the weather was mild. I say all this to say, you shouldn't necessarily brave the heat or endure a long line for this sandwich. It was good, worth the money, worth trying but not mind-blowing. My biggest gripe was not enough spice. I added jalapeños to it, but next time, I'll probably ask for dbl. The bacon jam was a nice surprise and it brings me to the beef dog. 

If you like bacon on your dog, don't convince yourself you don't need it when you hear it comes with bacon jam. It's a nice addition but it's no substitute for full slices on your dog.

I came here last week and enjoyed a delicious ""Hawaiian"" style burger only to find out they closed the doors a day later? Nope, this place just has funky hours and sometimes the chef is out running errands. So take it easy Yelpers, only report a place as closed if you see a, ""Closed For Business"" sign. That being said... When I walked up to the shack no one was there, I waited for a bit and turned to leave just as the chef came running up, close call Pepito! 

Taking over the former Goodwich food shack, Pepito offers more of a blue collar, culture rich menu with solid flavor profiles, but with less food finesse. That being said, my burger was juicy, spicy and deliciously messy. An inch thick patty, piled high with onion rings, grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, I added fresh sautéed jalapeños and avocado. By the way, no cheese on this bad boy and I'm still in love, the layered flavors were highlighted with each bite and kept me eating with no breathing breaks, who needs oxygen! 

Carl's Jr. and most boutique burger joints in Vegas have nothing on this burger. Pepito!, fix your hours, stay consistent and you're sure to have a line around the corner.

We had one person come out (oh I forgot to mention this is a little shack with outside seating around the edge of the trailer) and ask us how everything was and if we wanted to try anymore sauces with our fries? Well of course we had to because he advised us they were all homemade sauces:) I chose the ranch and it was very good and I even threw some on the sandwich! Then we had someone else come out and offer us some deep fried Oreos to try. I am not a fan of Oreos (I know I hear it all the time that I'm not normal) but these were covered in some cinnamon coating that really made them irresistible!

Came across this place on yelp so my buddy and I decided to check it out.

It's a stand located near the Stratosphere with bar style seating on two sides of the shack. I'm assuming most people take carry out or just eat in their cars. I can't imagine people eating outside especially during the scorching summers. 

They serve hot dogs, burgers, and pepitos (which are Mexican/Venezuelan sandwiches). We got a pepito with pork, one hot dog with beef, an order of bacon fries, and fried oreos. I'm usually not a huge fan of sandwiches, but I really enjoyed the pepito. The bread was toasted nicely, soft but with a slight crunch, and the pork was juicy. The crispy onions added more texture to the sandwich overall, but next time, I think I'll add some jalapeno peppers to give it that extra kick. I haven't had a hot dog in awhile so that was refreshing, and the fries with bacon bits were pretty good. The only complaint I would have is that the fries weren't hot when I received them. 

Oh and the fried oreos were really tasty. The batter was coated with cinnamon so it tasted like a churro with an oreo inside of it. Best to eat it when its hot!

Will definitely be back if I'm in the area! Looking forward to trying their burger!",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,7,5,5,DpPuilWNCf8_03gQOjnCAg

Stopped here for a couple of hot dogs with everything on them and they sure are not your typical hot dog.  Served on a beautiful toasted bun with cabbage, potato strings, mustard, and sauce.  The hot dog itself was def gourmet style and full of seasoning.  I wish I would've been hungrier because I really wanted to try more!  There are some little seats around the building, but we ate in the car as it was super windy outside. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to stop by when I'm super hungry.  I really want to try the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado, and maybe an egg on it...and a deep fried OREO!  Best wishes to this place!",xyRVGkStRzT2qSe4vFk8Dw,0,0,5,Ay6qRgKxBtCnsFw8QZBZKw

I had a 1/2 burger with tomato lettuce, mushrooms, jalapeños, cheese and some house made garlic sauce. It was honestly a really tasteful burger. The owner really cares for his costumers and showed us great costumer service. I recommend this place to everyone that visits Vegas. It's right at the end of the strip by stratosphere. Check it out!!

I tried the pork Pepito while my boyfriend got the wood-fired smoked chicken, included toppings plus avocado. The portion was a really good size. There are also the traditional green hot sauce that Viva Las Arepas offers, and they also brought out a cheese sauce and some sort of creamy bacon sauce to add onto the sauciness that was already on the sandwich. It was so bomb. The service was so awesome also. Both the chef and the manager were super friendly and kept checking on us as we sat on the bar seating to make sure we were completely satisfied. They have a few seats (about 10 at the bar) which is cool, bc the previous occupants had to remove the outdoor seating area due to city codes or something like that making it hard to eat there. We'll absolutely be back to try some of the other menu items like some fries or the hot dogs too.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,1,5,PXbhzYNTPPOzkd5wvHkgyA

As always I took to my yelp reviews not being from this side of town and wanted something all the locals liked.

Then I found Pepitos. I read the reviews and decided this was hot spot destination for lunch. 

Richard, I beleive is the owner was very friendly and gave me several options as to what to order. After talking to him and reading other reviews I opted for the beef pepito, no extras but did ask for the garlic sauce. The sauce gave the sandwich that infamous taste that upon first bite your eyes roll back in heaven.
I enjoyed my 15 minutes out on a beautiful sunny March afternoon with good eats and company from Richard ( the chef) himself. Awesome food and even more awesome company. Thank you Richard",BQykQnjNlh0Cl-pUk54KAg,0,0,5,oUEfk-1L6euTJ6r2nQoxfw

The pepito was so fresh and delicious that we are coming back for lunch before we leave Las Vegas. It was the perfect combination of flavor and texture. The French Fries have a lot of flavor and are a great side addition! GET THE FRIED OREOS!!! They are like crunchy, smooth, cinnamon bits of delicious that melt in your mouth (and I don't even like Oreos). On top of it, the owner, Richard, genuinely cares about his business and customer satisfaction. GO HERE! You won't regret it.",8FpwIu0t7NbKWcFaXtyMmw,0,0,5,u5M9fxN6uwCEftul3519iQ

The sandwiches (pepitos) come with a lot of ingredients already but you can't live without adding more.
