The food was dry and overcooked the first time. We gave it a second shot, knowing that not every day can be a perfect day for them--it wasn't any better.

The wait staff left a lot to be desired too. We felt snubbed, and I'm not sure why the wait staff acted the way the did, but there was no excuse for it.  We made that clear when we left our tip and I even left them a note.  

Here's the deal:  I'm FROM the South. I've lived in Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. I know good BBQ when I taste it and this place was a not a place I want to remember.

320103,2007-08-31,0,AIMffDJ5PtTU9BrEDce0ZQ,"I went here last night to celebrate with some friends.  We were a group of 4 and we were seated right away at a large round table (for 6).  The waiter took our drink orders, and I was not very excited by their drink menu. The waiter came back with our drinks and bread.  The bread was okay, but in my opinion...just bread. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with no slaw and mac and cheese as my side.  Our food seemed to show up seconds later.  Seriously, it came out QUICK.  The pulled pork sandwich was HUGE, it was on basically an entire loaf of bread (the same bread served at the table).  I removed the top of my sandwich because it was just too much bread (and for a carb addict like myself to say that is saying A LOT). It was okay,  but there were a lot of  really fatty looking chunks that just didn't seem appetizing.  The macaroni and cheese was pretty yummy though, but not very creamy.  Others in my group had BBQ chicken, brisket, and ribs.  It seemed to be the consensus that everything was just  ""okay.""  I had to ask for more water at one point during the meal, and later my water was empty again (no refill). For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake, and once again...it was ""okay.""

The all-you-can-eat BBQ is definitely a deal for $17.99 a person compared to buffet brunches at most other casinos.

This is my 4th visit to salt lick - but it's been about 8 months since my last visit - tremendous improvement !  All the meats were very smoky - the brisket had a nice pink smoke ring, firm, not too much fat - maybe, just maybe slight dryness for some.  The sausage - nice taste, texture.  the riblets - a mixed bag - some with too much fat, others, perfect.  

The sides are kinda average - but ok .  the slaw - fresh, no frills.  the potato salad actually looks like mac n cheese - ok, again, no frills.  the beans are very dull.

My friend & I both ordered the all-you-can-eat bbq meal. The sausage reminded me of a simple rope kielbasa which you can find at any supermarket so I wasn't impressed there. The rib & brisket was much better however the bbq sauces was pretty weak. Both the regular and ""spicy"" sauces were lack luster. The sides were also blah: slaw was crunchy but needed either more sweeter or dressing, the beans didn't shine at all and the potato salad had just bbq sauce tossed on it.

Overall, the Salt Lick has decent ribs & brisket but the rest of the food could use some modifications.

Sure, we were happy that they had Shiner Bock on tap.  But, wait... ""what?!  No brisket baked potato?  And you want what ....an extra $2 for a large baked potato?""

Anyhow, on following trips, they've gotten chinsey with bbq sauce, cheese, chives, and sour cream... even the massive baked potato has gotten smaller (but, at least, it's a FREE side now.  I don't know if that makes up for it).  And, worst of all, one of my favorite side dish at the Red Rock Salt Lick, the mac and cheese isn't as good as it use to be.

3211529,2008-07-21,8,AIMffDJ5PtTU9BrEDce0ZQ,"Ways that the Salt Lick in Vegas (Red Rock) IS like the Salt Lick in Driftwood:

* It's delicious
* It's messy
* You eat on wooden tables
* The desserts are good
* The sides are good
* The sausage is wonderful
* The people cutting the meat have big huge knives
* It's best with a big group of people
* You have to drive a long way to get there, as it's pretty much out in the middle of nowhere. 
* Big fat slices of white bread
* You eat so much you could just die!

Ways that the Salt Lick in Vegas IS NOT like the Salt Lick in Driftwood:
* It's inside a building with A/C and everything!
* You have to pass by slot machines to go to the bathroom
* They serve alcohol!! (including Tito's and Shiner--hello!)
* It 's easy to get drunk since you didn't have to bring your own drinks!
* You can take said beer out of the restaurant and then go play Black Jack.
* The stoves are inside
* It's not Texas.  

Friend had a pre-wedding welcome dinner here for almost 60 people. Service was great and we had our own private dining area. Salt Lick was smart and gave each server only one or two tables to worry about.

3293714,2010-04-29,0,AIMffDJ5PtTU9BrEDce0ZQ,"This is supposed to be quality southern barbecue food, but it sure doesn't taste like it.  Of all of the restaurants in the Red Rock, I think I loathe this one the most due to the pricey, lackluster food.  Our service was no better than the food, as the waitresses were slow to take our order and were barely attentive during the night.

Prices here were high, but that is expected with most casino establishments that aren't buffets or cafe diners.  For nearly $16, a combination of ribs + any meat can be had (I chose the sausage).  The problem is, it lacks flavor and is completely bland.  This goes the same for the other items we ordered, like the turkey fingers, and the Shrimp Diablo, a fancy appetizer with a lackluster kick.  Hey, at least the cornbread is free.

Looks are so deceiving.  This place is spacious and rather well decorated, the drinks are strong, and the food actually looked relatively decent.  I was fooled into thinking the Red Rock had struck a slight gold mine by offering a BBQ joint that many other competing casinos failed to have.  From the moment I noticed how empty was to the first bite of my sausage / chicken combo, I knew this place was a disaster.  Gordon Ramsey ought to come here and inspire the chefs to make this place a dynamite joint.

But as always, it's too late.  Salt Lick BBQ is closed.  Whew.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,1,0,2,xVeIzXp5ne5d8MgtloR4og

The meat was moist but a tad bland. Of course the BBQ sauce was the ultimate let down. I really like a tangy BBQ tasty. Hickory or something. Their BBQ was VERY mild. More like a flavored ketchup. 

The serving size was decent though.

The service was a bit slow and it's safe to say we felt slightly neglected.

I thought that this was going to be amazing barbeque (I'm from Texas and have eaten at the original Salt Lick) but this was so bad.  I hate to say bad things about this place since the staff is so so so nice, but everything I ate seemed undercooked.  
My serving of chicken was bleeding when I sliced it.  I asked the waitress if I could have another (cooked) piece and she said okay, but explained that it's supposed to be that way when it's smoked.  She brought another piece out and it was bloody inside as well.  I tried to take a bite to be a good sport, but I just couldn't eat that larval chicken.  I ended up getting an upset stomach for the next two days, but that might've just been a coincidence.
I took a bite of my friend's ribs, and those seemed undercooked as well--or maybe my appetite was just ruined by then.  
The Red Rock casino is really lovely though.  I'll definitely go back to wander around the uniquely unoffensive casino soon.  The canopy beds around the pool are interesting!",xc4rdsrGoS-Yk3TXLefmtg,2,0,2,CVxMaukUGKXeSA8bZU0VqA

Finding Salt Lick was fun and not very difficult, a breezy walk through the casino gave us a menu of potential eateries as well as a view of the slot machines offered at Red Rock.

The bread was the highlight of the meal.  It was moist (and dare I say, gooey?) and paired with Promise ""butter.""  Boost your heart health before you smother it in fat and BBQ sauce, of which they have two, a red and an orange variety.

I had the baby back rib and chicken combo, with my two sides being potato wedges and corn on the cob.  I tried to veer on the healthier side and stayed away from the mac 'n cheese, but looking back on this I wish I had ordered that.  My ribs were not tender, did not fall off the bone, but did taste very good.

4974734,2007-08-03,0,AIMffDJ5PtTU9BrEDce0ZQ,"Grabbing a quick lunch at The Salt Lick, the BF remembers this joint from his days back in Texas and he was craving barbecue.  

We were seated immediately on a weekday, as it wasn't too busy at the Red Rock.  After getting our beverages, bread and butter were soon to arrive.  It's a soft bread with a sesame crust that leaves a slight bitter taste in your mouth after each bite.  

I didn't want to load up too heavy before the movie, so I chose the Brisket Stuffed Mushrooms ($8.99).  The Salt Lick describes them as  ""Portabellini mushrooms stuffed with our house smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and peppers.  Baked and basted with our world famous Bar-B-Que sauce.""  They came with four generous mushrooms that can be easily shared with another.  Watch out for the jalapeno pepper that comes along with it, it's a creeper!  Pretty tasty stuff!

The BF initially wanted the All You Can Eat ($17.99), which includes ""Heaping helpings of slow-smoked brisket of beef, link sausage and pork ribs, served with potato salad, coleslaw, Mama Robert's beans, bread and butter.""  With less than an hour before our show, he went for the Combination Bar-B-Que Meats ($15.99), ""Slow-smoked brisket, smoked link sausage, and tender, juicy slow-cooked ribs"" instead.  The sausage was damn good, and that's what I call a link!  It came with two ribs which didn't seem to have a whole lot of meet on it.  The BF said it was pretty dry for his tastes.  And the brisket was just okay.  It came with about three slices or so.  The coleslaw was lack luster, and the potato salad was a bit interesting.  It doesn't look like your typical potato salad, you'd expect a savory finish from the looks of it.  And the beans were alright too.

(You can see the pics of our eating in the business profile!)

The BF expected pickles and onions right off the bat with his order and was disappointed when he had to make a special request for it.  (Definitely ask for it!  It's pickled onions with some tasty pickles, so don't miss out on it!)

Service was okay.  After our lunch was delivered, a minute or so went by and the waitress asked, ""You all set?""  And we said we were and I got the feeling that she wasn't coming around again.  We did have to ask for refills on the BF's soda when she came around with wet napkins.  She did ask if we made room for dessert, which was sad to say no to.  (They had peach or berry cobbler!)

Overall, my lunch was good...not particularly fabulous or anything.  The only sauces available on my table was Heinz ketchup and a Texas hot sauce, so not sure what other sauces I was missing out on.

They have a few big screen TVs showing the game on, and they automatically add 20% gratuity for parties of 8 or more.

We  visited on a Friday, around 2 pm.

There were only a few other diners when we visited.  The waitress was fine.  My entree, the ""combination barb-b-que meats"" for $15.99, was uninteresting, to say the least.  The macaroni and cheese I chose as a side was not good at all- kinda dry and not very tasty.  Salt didn't help.  The baked potato in its little foil jacket was all right- not much you can do to ruin one of those. The meat was boring; not particularly tasty or memorable.  Long, thin slices with barbecue sauce poured over them.  Not my kind of barbecue!  I like eating the meat off the bone, and I like the meat to have been cooked with the sauce on it.  I wouldn't bother coming back here, and if anyone had a taste for barbecue, this is not the place I'd send them to.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,0,0,2,5-bYDEgLl2Im3XeLmLv06g

I went with friends while checking out the Red Rock Casino in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and truly found a gem!  We were lucky enough to come during the Monday Night Football special from 7-9pm which featured ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ for only $20!

You should've seen the look on our faces when we walked to the buffett table and found stacks of ribs, bbq chicken, beef brisket, sausages, chicken tenders, onion rings, potato salad, and fruit!!! I asked the waiter if I was in heaven, and he told me I was!  Wowzers, my stomach and taste buds orgasmed as I imagined all the possibilities of eating all that food! 

Amazingly, the food turned out tasting better than it looked!  The ribs and chicken were my favorite, and the meat would just drip off the bones! The warm moist juciy bbq goodness topped with the tangy house bbq sauce and drizzled with spicy pepper sauce was to die for.  DROOL... I am getting hungry just thinking about it!!!  

I seriously almost lost it while I was eating and much of my meal ended up on my face but I didn't care!  

The wait staff was totally awesome too!  Funny thing happened when my Invisalign trays were accidentally thrown away because I keep them in a napkin when I eat!  You should've seen the look on my bbq covered face when I realized it was gone!  My friends couldn't contain themselves when they saw my face and busted up laughing, while I ran to the waitress and asked her to dig into the trash for my aligners...and she went and found them!  and she was nice about it too!    So i had to slip her a little sumthin-sumthin for her trouble.  $5!!! 

All in all, please go eat here if you want to experience a gastrorgasm.  And don't forget to use the hot pepper sauce.  MMMMMMM^100000",wpTZdFaOITAco8evnTtBUA,0,1,5,1Ul5gWEmWN33do5saqP33A

 I bet you can guess I always order the AYCE BBQ. $17.99 which is a great deal for wood smoke BBQ. It comes with pork ribs, brisket, and link sausage. Even though this is what I always order I have tried almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all.  

This go around there was no wait and we were seated right away. Our server got us our drinks and took our order and a few minutes later our BBQ was on the table. 

To me and the GF this place has the best brisket in town. Great smoke flavor and a smoke ring you can see in the meat. I personally love BBQ that you can taste the smoke in. The ribs are always very ""fall off the bone"" tender. I like the link sausage... not a huge sausage fan but it is very good. The sauces are good but not the best.....kinda sweet. The sides that come with the AYCE are just ok except for the beans... for some reason I really like them... nothing special just hit the spot for me. The sesame crusted bread is always sooo soft and good. 

All you can eat for $17.99..... that's an insane deal.....mmmmm....give it a try if you enjoy a nice smoked meat instead of a mediocre meat slathered in ""great"" sauce.",cmR12osCE30jlFCVUHJQEg,4,5,4,IEyNAA-XRwIa_JlynFozQQ

I actually was on a date there and the fact that the food was uneatable and that we got a guilt-trip from the staff because we came in near the end of closing did not help my cause. Just don't go here. I'm not a big fan of the other restaurants at the Red Rock, but avoid this one at all costs.",vqNqAUEy-oEOEI6EE1FfUw,0,0,1,7PjNKwq2zf5s-g0JFBRjFg
