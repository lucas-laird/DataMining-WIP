I like Jimmy Buffett. I've been a Parrothead for years. I've traveled all over the states to catch his show. I love the Margaritaville products. Or I used to. 

The last time H was in Vegas he dropped by Margaritaville to pick me up a present. He chose the insulated tumbler & the salesperson told him that it was ""guaranteed"" for life. It worked great for a couple months then started to leak. I finally got tired of looking like I drooled all over myself so I went online to find how to return/replace the product. I will tell you this: it is VERY hard finding the information regarding returns on the website. I finally located an address & mailed the tumbler asking for a replacement. 3 months have now passed and I have yet to hear from Margaritaville. No. Effin. Word. Nada. Nothing. Crickets. Needless to say I am very disappointed & disgusted w/the brand. 

When Jimmy Buffett opened Margaritaville & started coming out with merchandise I was soooooo excited. Now this ""dream"" of his has turned into a money-making machine that could care less about the quality of product they spew out. And they could care less about what the customers think. What a shame.",6FasnS3e53f3fW_zwVv-sw,4,2,1,WawWu3wF_i7Vsrt0WlDgHA

Not only were the nachos killer, atmosphere great, our server Ryan went above and beyond to make sure our experience here was great along with suggestions to where to visit while in Vegas since it was me and my friends first time visiting. Thanks Ryan!",UwsFv1nwtiJoeOMU2uTmQA,0,0,5,Im81O5ep0-eFuJ3tzmX2Lg
1980986,2018-01-04,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,Fast and easy location to get to since I was staying at The Linq. Food was ok but my drink was really good. I forget which margarita I had but the guy sure made it strong which was ok with me.,MFUIlAnYFY6RI3pTrnXQ-g,0,0,4,Htn-MLyB4ecWcuttFEgXMA

Adam at the bar makes great, strong drinks! No complaints at all. Definitely recommend.",Abvivg7Ojd7yRyqz2KqSWQ,0,0,5,uPfTZiny7SYfjZ0MzfHy8w
3080646,2018-05-24,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"If I could give it negative stars I would.  I dat at the bar and got zero service even though it was a slow night.  Ask for a Bud Light on tap and was told it was out.  I thought, wellchange it.  Decided on a Miller Lite as a substitute.  I wanted another and after spending 10 minutes trying to get a bartenders attention.  They were all congregated at the far end of the bar.  I ordered another Miller Lite and was told it was out, well change it out.  Upon requesting to check out I was told it was cash only because their credit card m machine was down.

When I came in tonight I was wondering why they we so empty.  Now I know, they've gone totally downhill.  I can't believe they will remain open unless management changes and the staff retrained.",jcj7n6JzOZ08f3ZinIFFEQ,0,0,1,2o4JHFnZwqWCUPu4v-_pIw

3632200,2017-10-08,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"My 10yr old daughter loved the men on stilts who gave her a balloon hat and the acrobat who slid into a giant beaker full of water. Nice waiters too.  She liked the pasta with red sauce. Volcano Nachos was mostly chips and a very small amount of toppings... I saw another picture from another review with tons of toppings, I think we got Juked. Overall I think the focus is 50/50 food / atmosphere. Kind of a repeat.",vVkT25eBjh-93j7w08OWUQ,0,0,3,8qO4bw9WP1M_NUY8XT_jdQ
3893683,2018-03-04,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"Had a great time here for our last night in Vegas. The bartenders were nice and really attentive. We listened to a DJ who played all the jams and the set would change between him and a live band, which was also really fun to listen to and dance. If you're looking for a chill time and not something crazy hectic then this is the spot to be at.",-tuDegfmAaOv5DKtzcmGlw,0,0,5,2sQXCRV8miBlK56Gc4sSmg
4058629,2017-06-05,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"The service, drinks and food that I have had here tonight have been exceptional.  The waitress wished me a happy birthday, recommended a few items from the menu and was very attentive to the us as she walked throughout the restaurant.  We ordered volcano nachos as an appetizer and the infamous margarita tower for $70.  The nachos they brought to us were loaded so we got pretty full while enjoying the margaritas.  The general atmosphere of the place was welcoming and the self seating was a plus.  This would definitely be a place that I visit on my return trip to Las Vegas.  They also have really unique booths inside the restaurant that are designed to look like boats.  If you go for food, you should either have a big appetite or just go for either an entree or appetizer as the servings are well over normal portions you would expect to see at most places.  Keep up the great work, you've got an out of state regular now.",Eac6dFWPvHOUyD6MxZdp2w,0,0,5,PhbLrOJrg7IBHm-w5x7RcA
4422758,2018-04-16,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"Every time I come to Vegas, I suggest coming to this location and they have not disappointed me yet! Each time I go I try something different, and who ever I am with I try their food too. The customer service is always outstanding, food is always flavorful and their drinks are tasty! I've had their pasta, fried fish tacos, jambalaya, Asiago crab & crab artichoke dip and more. EVERY single last one of the dishes were amazing. Even the location is great and they have a bar that allows you to people watch and feel a breeze as half of it is almost outside, while the other is inside. Only thing I would change is adding more stalls to the bathroom (because 4 stalls is NOT enough).

Oh and be prepared to wait for food! If you can just sit at the bar do so, the bartenders are pretty fun too.",_6BuACaybsYYrpLxQ7CoVQ,0,0,5,bngSLzzLuLFslgqK8r3Vtg
5307686,2017-04-20,0,fk9-GzfKDCESiP9Zp8XfzA,"Food is ok but very expensive. I guess everything is expensive in Las Vegas nowadays! There were three of us that went for lunch. Our tab ended up being 102 plus tax! That was just for lunch. It was pretty empty too for being such a big place. And the waiter kept on apologizing saying he can get in trouble for various reasons, it was weird. He was a great waiter but made it sound like they are pretty strict with them!",qnGTWwTFRJwOLunXpVjjfA,0,0,3,KQKNv7cv_WteZ-eidpjCJQ

The blended mango margarita was great, a little on the sweet side, yet exactly what you would expect. And tequila shots are only $11. This is definitely a bar I would revisit.",x3okn1LPqvQjOWJVViYP8Q,0,0,5,q5WuKpXjhFb-ZdPglRKdSw
