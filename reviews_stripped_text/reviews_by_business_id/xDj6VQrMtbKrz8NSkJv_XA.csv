We fell in love with Liege Waffles in Europe (which are different than a Belgium Waffle for breakfast) so we always searching out the real thing wherever we go.  I have had them that were great since returning from Europe and I was excited to try this place.  I was shocked to find that the base waffle with just powdered sugar cost me $9.72!  There were half that in Europe (and that's with the currency conversion). Oh well, I bought one anyways because we were on vacation.  Once I paid, I saw the cook, unwrap a precooked waffle and put it in a toaster.  Are you kidding?  $9 for a reheated waffle!  Oh well, open mind right.  Then we tasted it.  It was dry and lacked the dense chew of a real Liege Waffle.  It also lacked the caramelized bits of pearl sugar that form on the outside ridges.  We literally threw the waffle away.  Not that it was so disgusting to finish; it just wasn't good, so why waste calories.  
Sam's Club sells Liege -ish waffles prepackaged for a fraction of the cost and they are way better (although nothing like the real thing).
I would recommend avoiding this place.  It wont be around long anyways.

I had The Nute Waffle while hubby had the Egg & Bacon. The Belgian Liege waffles were flavorful and crunchy but whoa! the thick spread of Nutella and added whipped cream made it sooo sweet that I couldn't... I just couldn't finish it. If I was borderline diabetic... I would've hopped over and became diabetic already. People who know me know that I love my sweets but this was over the top sweet... I should've ordered something else. Their Savory waffles included breakfast and waffle sandwiches and also pizza waffles. The sweet waffles are ones with fruits-- bananas, berries and strawberry. The waffles were quite expensive, my Nutella Waffle was $8.99 and the Egg & Bacon was $9.99. If you could get a Groupon deal then that's great... I wouldn't pay full price.  There's plenty of seating around the area to wait or have your waffles. If you have a late night craving they're open till midnight.

4382614,2016-02-28,3,xDj6VQrMtbKrz8NSkJv_XA,"Ever since my first liege waffle in Canada I've had a serious liege obsession. Why does anyone even make the waffles from batter when liege exists?

This location is a stand located in the Bazaar Shops area near Bally's. After ordering at the window you can take it to go or there are seats in the center area to rest while enjoying your waffle.

The waffles run just under $10 per waffle. I have mixed feelings about this because it's one waffle and really isn't worth $10. On the other hand I get that this shopping center probably has high rent for tenants which is going to automatically increase the price of anything in the plaza. It took a minute or two to even be greeted even though we were the only people at the register. It also took awhile for our waffle to come up which the man apologized for, but they only offer waffles so I'm not sure what the wait was about. It did seem like they could benefit from the assembly line idea. Since there were two people working I would suggest one person handle the register and calling out orders while the other person handles food preparation. 

The most important part if the actual waffle. It was tasty and thick like a liege waffle should be. The whipped cream was delicious and the strawberries on top were fresh. The waffle was not as sweet as other liege waffles I've had and was not the best liege waffle ever. The liege waffle is hard to find so this is definitely still a good option for the area, but not the best there is in general.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,2,3,_dO9JMage96pa1G_Mn_fZA

The lines are long at the breakfast spots early on the convention opening morning at the Venetian. So I wandered to the food court looking for something a little less crowded and a little more imaginative.  FOUND IT

I tried the breakfast waffle. The waffles are cooked to order (8 minutes). 2 fried eggs, also cooked to order, 4 strips of crisp bacon and 2 slices of cheddar top the waffle.

These are liege waffles, known for including belgian pearl sugar in the batter. When cooked the sugar caramelizes to yield a sweet, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside perfect waffle.

It's not cheap ($9.99), but this is as good of a waffle I've ever had. Can't wait til later when I'll come back for another one for dessert.",Yy5uYBI7PH5fVtfQjYI76Q,0,0,5,DNwQWjKpCn-k2DFKowvocQ

I am not much of a waffle guy but I can't complain.  This particular branch/franchise is located inside the Venetian in a small area where the food court starts and I believe extends to shopping stores.  

I had the scramble eggs and bacon with maple syrup.  It was pretty tasty but simply done.  I believe my wife had chocolate with icing over her waffles (I could be wrong).  Don't know if she really enjoyed hers because I recall that hers was a little too sweet.  The only thing is that they didn't have any water when I asked for a cup on the side , I have to purchase for 2.50$.

After walking through Ballys we finally got to the waffle bar only to be told that they were out of waffle mix and we would need to come back later! So let me get this straight... a waffle bar out of waffles on a Sunday morning?! 

Although I was super annoyed and hungry, I nicely asked the lady if we could use the groupon for something else, I noticed doughnuts, juices...etc and she said No, there was nothing she could do. 

I was so baffled by this I walked in a circle for a minute trying to comprehend what was happening but needless to say, this place won't last long if they keep this up.

The cab was dirty with hair everywhere. I was grossed out and could not wait to get out cab. We arrived safely. Walked into the Venetian up the escalator to the 2nd floor to the food court. There was many food establishments to choose from. There was a line at the Waffle Bar. We were acknowledged and ask to wait a few for our order to be taken. 

There were 2 ladies behind the counter taking orders and making orders. They changed their gloves with every order. They were a bit unorganized. I ordered the berry waffle which was a waffle with strawberry and whipped cream. My friend ordered the breakfast waffle with turkey, 2 fried eggs, and cheese. 

When the order was ready it sat on the counter inter my friend asked if it was our order. The problem came when I noticed my waffle had bananas. I advised that I didn't order that particular waffle since I'm allergic to bananas. I was told that I did order that particular waffle which makes no since. She was combative and finally made a new waffle with no bananas. Surprisingly she was not the one who took the order. 

Once I received our correct order we sat down in the community seating area. It was clean. The berry waffle had fresh cut strawberries and it was a bit sweet without the syrup that was provided. My friend said the waffle breakfast sandwich tasted different and he was still hungry after finishing the sandwich. My berry waffle had a little darkness on the bottom, maybe from a spray on the griddle. 

The waffles range from $8.99 to $13.

Anyway, I've never had a Liege waffle before. I had no idea what to expect. I ordered the chicken and waffle. My first impression was the waffle was very dense and caky. It had a caramelized outer shell that was slightly sweet. The inside seemed slightly under cooked. Overall, the flavor of the waffle was good, however, the chicken did not taste fresh. It had burnt tips and edges as if it were made in a toaster oven. The batter was very hard. I think if the chicken was freshly deep fried it would have been much better. 

My wife had a breakfast sandwich. Eggs were cooked fresh in a pan, which was a huge plus. So glad it was not in a microwave. 

Based on my experience, I would love to try a desert waffle from this place. I think these waffles would go well with some ice cream or some sweet toppings and a coffee. Not a fan of the savory versions and would not order them again. 

They make everything to order. Our waffles came out about 13 minutes from the time we ordered to the time they handed over the waffles. Not sure what they would do if it were a little busier. We were the only order so the turn around time seemed long.

I did notice that the person prepping the order constantly changed her glove as she handled different ingredients. Huge plus for being sanitary and avoiding cross contamination.
