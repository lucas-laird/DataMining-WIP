UPDATE: 
Returned for evening dinner, had Shahi Paneer with Chapati, Rice & Raita. Everything was so delicious and the homemade taste. I also had Gulab Jamun, super delicious, soft warm, just as you would make it at home.

998747,2018-03-01,0,2B4bC4w4PDC8Pj53SfTG2g,"I was looking for a place for a quick dinner and found this on Yelp. I was skeptical about the quality when I stepped in, but I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The gentleman who runs the restaurant greeted me with a warm hello and pointed me to the daily specials. The jackfruit curry caught my eye and I decided to try it. I ordered a nice hot chai to go with it. The gentleman told me to finish eating first and that I could pay later. It's almost as if he knew I couldn't stop ordering more items!

The jackfruit was spectacular! I am from South India but I have never had anything like it. The spices had the punch but were not overbearing. He told me later that he's from Fiji and so is the dish. The tea was very good too, just the right amount of sweetness.

The gentleman came and sat with me at the table (there was no one else at the place, so kinda worked out) and talked about Fiji and the influences of tamil nadu and kerala styles on his Fiji cooking thanks to his parents.

He also offered me a sample of a spinach, eggplant, tomato curry which was also fantastic. The biggest surprise was the murukku! They were so crisp on that outside and soft on the inside and not soaking in oil like in some other places.

He grinds the masalas himself every couple of days and the freshness shines through. He makes the sweets and snacks himself too (that's his ancestral trade apparently). So I HAD to try the gulab jamoon. The only thing limiting my description of its richness is my vocabulary.

This was a totally unexpected and refreshing experience. The food and the pleasant conversation did truly make it feel like I was having dinner at a friend's place. I have never posted a Yelp review before this, but the sincerity this gentleman has in serving good food to his customers and make them leave the place happy, touched me. There needs to be more such people and places in this world.",swt7T6Z7Ple_nm5chMhPNQ,0,0,5,e3jb4nTGvUYcl9SJAPVvqg

1368028,2018-02-01,0,2B4bC4w4PDC8Pj53SfTG2g,"The location of this restaurant may be a hole in the wall, but the food is freshly made and it's served hot. Look for a big sign that says Campus Village and it's hidden in that building downstairs. The restaurant has a lot of open space and there are plenty of seating as well as a comfort lounge. You place your order at the counter. They have a simple menu on the wall where you can choose appetizers like samosa and pakora, sides such as roti and dhal, curry plates, combo plates where you have a choice to make it vegetarian or non-vegetarian, hot dishes like masala dosa, and a couple of beverage and desserts. After you place your order, they bring the meal to your table. And the service is fast.

I chose the Non-Vegetarian Thali ($9.99) with Chicken and it comes with Rice, Dhal, and Cucumber Salad. The chicken is so tender and flavorful, I love the mild sauce that they cook it with, and it's very savory. The Dhal taste similar to a hearty yet delicious split pea lentil stew, and it taste very good with rice. The Cucumber Salad has diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and it's like a light salad with a fresh cucumber crunch.

In addition, I ordered a Mango Lassi ($3.99) which is a mango puree mixed with yogurt and milk, and there's no added sugar. They make Mango Lassi fresh daily. I love how this drink is so creamy and it has the perfect amount of sweetness.  Also I tried the Gulab Jamun (3 for $1.99) which is an Indian version of a donut immersed in syrup. The donut taste soft and it has an earthy spice mixture of cardamom and ginger, and when you eat it with honey it gives the donut a nice sweet punch. Now the person who attended to my order is very polite and attentive, and I notice the owner is always friendly and greets every person with a smile. I was given a punch card and there is a clause that you must spend at least $10 for your meal to count as 1 punch. So after the 5th punch, I will get a Free Mango Lassi which I am looking forward to because the drink taste so good and it's refreshing!",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,0,0,5,w4VphJ0a-jkA6toTZKtUfA

We had not had Indian food in a while so we checked out Yelp and to our surprise we found this great little place across the street from us. We were hesitant at first but it was well worth our time and money.

There is no AC so it is a bit warm but not uncomfortable. The menu is small but there is something for everyone. The service was prompt and friendly and the food was served hot.

My wife had the chicken curry and rice, I had the cauliflower and potato with roti. Both dishes were worth the short weight. It was the best Indian vegetarian dish I have had in years.

The chicken and the veg samosas were yummy too.

It is a good thing they are a bit of a drive from us or we would be spending more money on food than we would need to.

This is not fancy food, but delicious, honest, homestyle cooking. The owner and his wife are not fans of the buffet concept because of the difficulty in trying to keep food hot and fresh. In an interesting twist, instead of a buffet, on Saturday evenings, they do an all-you-can-eat dinner in which practically everything on the menu is available (with the exception of a few items, such as lamb and shrimp, which are very expensive). You just tell him what you want, and he brings it out to you, hot and fresh out of the kitchen. This is perfect for somebody like me! I have often wished I could go to a restaurant and have a small sample of everything on the menu.

The owner is extremely friendly and personable, and took the time to chat with us about Indian food and whatever else we wanted to talk about.

Sometimes when you go to an Indian restaurant with no available buffet, you pay a pretty high price for items from the menu. Not here! These prices are completely reasonable -- one would even say inexpensive. I highly recommend a visit!",LidIh9ozRzDxzWK4nXAQjQ,0,0,5,1dKw2Pay9BSFmsxXbJNAcw

As someone whose taste buds are not particularly well-versed in Indian food, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Fiji ""island-style"" chicken curry, as well as the tasty mango lassi to anyone.",aJI-dyzQ0ENoUscu43XhzQ,3,1,5,Q6icpzC-Ts7W8ht_9iUXrg

I ordered butter chicken and it said it came with raitha and cucumber salad as sides, it did not mention rice included, so I ordered a side of rice. The dish came without the two listed sides, and only rice, plus my side of rice.",WwM2cVfWugMxP54cTgIcbg,0,0,1,lqIOJEqK9_eIAi420VnV9g

We could not find many Indian restaurants that serves dosa. The food was so homely that we ended up coming here for every meal during our stay at Vegas. The owner is a very friendly person, and we enjoyed chit chatting with him.

The place is a little difficult to find, and is located at the basement of a little run down strip mall.",TptmvFOBakLwh3MoLsqrNg,0,0,5,2KrxN2jZWvWJ4Kwyn6u7nQ

Very nice owner but they definitely could use some help with additional kitchen staff and out on the floor with the customers.  There is potential for a great business but they have a long way to go.  The food is definitely 5 stars",maw5HlBuOoIEaQtF56BB5g,2,0,3,QVPGcPpGV20h1eA706_fDA

They were very accepting and supportive of my vegan lifestyle and gave me so many great options to try.

5666411,2018-03-18,0,2B4bC4w4PDC8Pj53SfTG2g,"I love Indian food and I'm certainly no stranger to it. That being said, I'm going to address this experience in multiple facets. 

Location - A little hard to find, it's in the lower level (semi underground) of a rundown strip mall. It doesn't seem clean but that may be mostly due to the location and lighting. 

Service - The owner (I presume) waited on us at the front counter. He was very helpful and wanted to explain all the items to us (although we didn't need descriptions). When I went to fill my cup at the soda fountain it didn't work, the owner came over and turned it on, the soda sprayed everywhere and all over my pants and shoes. A nearby customer tried to warn me (too late), as it had happened to him earlier. The owner then complains that it's his sons fault, apologizing profusely, and comes over to reach into a pitcher (of water I think) with bare hands, and pulls out the nozzles and attaches them to the soda machine. My best guess is they turn off the machine to prevent customers from getting refills, just a guess since it had just happened to someone else. 

Food - I ordered a thali plate with shrimp curry. The owner described 5/6 big shrimp, I got 3. The curry was fine. I don't remember what went with it but I remember not finishing anything else. Mildly disappointing overall. Not terrible, just not good.",qcUBjtHHikNXcnZ4BoNTYg,0,1,3,Sviy0PJUmlvf1p1Oj3goKA

Go early or they run out of most of the food...The owner is super friendly and accommodating... happily changing the spiciness of the aloo dish I ordered and even gave a free 2nd dosa because the first one didn't turn up well due to wok not hit enough.
