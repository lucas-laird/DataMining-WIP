9741,2015-03-22,1,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,When we pulled up to this place for our 5 pm reservation I thought maybe it went out of business. There were a group of  5 guys smoking in front of a door that perhaps at one time was an entrance.Then there was another door where dresses and clothing was being  taken out of the building by the droves. I walked in through that door  and waited to be seated in side the resturant   The TV was blareing and after waiting 5 minnutes we finnaly were seated in an empty resturant with the exception of a large group of men sitting in a corner table staring at us.. There were dirty tables that had not be bussed and when the waiter came over with water to pour inside a dirty glass I stoped him and said..Thanks but No Thanks we are leaving..He asked if the prices are too high I replied I didnt even bother to look at the menu sorry and got up and left.y,Q8uTqwmv2XA2ojDyE9uNXw,0,2,1,z3xph58ok_Ox67jnxNHsOg

To be honest I didn't know what to expect about this place, but I just have to say that I had such a wonderful experience. 

- Great environment  (cool music) 
- Great food; very colorful and so delicious! 
- Great service from the staff 

* If you are willing to try something out of your ""comfortable"" zone and you like to experiment with diverse dishes from around the world this is a great place to start! 
* For those who expect a ""luxurious"" place to eat this place might not be what you are looking for, but this restaurant is so welcoming and very peaceful.

Apparently they were featured on a show called ""dirty dining"" as well.  Well, their proximity to my hotel and the lack of good Indian food where I live allowed me to make a very trepidatious visit.  Sadly, not worth it.  The food was very much on the bland side, service was amateur, and when I presented them the Yelp 10% discount, they requested that I give them a positive review.  Well, here's your review guys. 

Other things of note, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night at 7pm, and the restrooms could have been cleaner.

Fortunately, I saw no evidence of roaches in my palak paneer, but I certainly paused to wonder if they might have inadvertently been serving a few cockroach curries that evening.  The food did not sit well in my stomach.",4CsDkZvYCf6Qu0DR658yIQ,2,0,2,w94ol2mMH_1FhHzLkoMZZQ

I've never tried the buffet, and have been wanting to... but maybe I won't now after what you guys said about it.  I'm also vegetarian, so if their meat is horrible, I have no idea about that.  

I have had the Narvatan Korma twice (excellent) and the Aloo Palak (yum!  You can tell it's full of butter...but who cares it's so good).  The first 2 times I was there they brought pappadoms as an appetizer; I was a little disappointed when they didn't on my last visit.  Not usually crowded unless you're there at peak dinner time on weekends.  The room is kind of cavernous, I wouldn't want to sit right in the middle surrounded by tables of people.  Try to get one of the super comfy booths around the outside.

165834,2011-12-05,1,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,"Despite being located in a seedy strip mall, a friend and I had previously tried this place for dinner, and it was decent, 3-star territory. However a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story. The first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates, disposable plastic eating utensils, and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces. I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.

When the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it. There are just too many better places in town, i.e. Taj Palace or Mt Everest., to waste your appetite on this one.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,1,1,1,RHF2kcrJt5OUuqHBBCq1Dg

219825,2017-08-04,2,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,"TL;DR: adequate food best served at a rarely-used regional airport.

We've been looking forward to going to this restaurant for a long time, so we had high expectations for the dinner.  How to quantify he disappointment? Well, imagine being told that you were going to meet a great Indian leader named Gandhi, only to find that it was Sonia, Indira's son's wife, not the Mahatma. Sure, it would be neat to meet the president of the Congress Party, but, still.

We chose two dishes: chicken korma and lamb biryani.  The korma was passable in a pinch, but the biryani was a disaster.  Biryani is supposed to have delectable pieces of meat, slowly cooked to a tender, savory consistency. The lamb in this dish tasted and felt as though it was re-used from a prior day (or recycled from the lunch buffet); tough, slightly dry, and almost flavorless.

Regarding the korma, in our experience korma has a very rich and savory taste, almost buttery, that fills the mouth. This dish was ok, but had a slightly greasy aftertaste. The gravy (if that's the right term) was thin and only vaguely flavorful.

Also, and this may be a small issue, but why separate charges for the oily jasmine rice?

Ambiance: we were assaulted by what I can only term ""Indian Booty Music"" when we entered the establishment. We're familiar with Bollywood-style music and music videos; what was playing, however, was some mixture of Beyoncé's Lemonade and Brittany Spear's snake dance and Indian music.  It was loud and obnoxious, but it was turned down quite a bit after we entered.

The decorating was done as an homage to the second Matrix movie.

We were the first guests of the evening, and only two couples arrived while we were there.  Perhaps it's the location (next to a series disgusting small shops), but the entire joint has a slightly seedy vibe, and maybe that's what's causing the problems the owners clearly are having with this place.",wM826KHTxfMC4paZ13rwxg,1,0,2,yN7Gmhf7aKENl_J94Myacw

Decor: rich dark colors, very spacious rooms.
Food: EXCELLENT!
Papadom (compliments of the chef). Light crispy, not overly spicy.
For starters we ordered Paneer Pakora. Very good seasoned excellent appetizer.
Mulligantawny soup. Be prepared to unusual preparation, not what  you would expect, but very good.

Entries:
Chicken Tikka Masala OMG!! Best Tikka Masala I ever had
Fish Korma. This dish is not on a menu, but I asked if it would be possible to prepare it for us.
That's another big STAR to Gandhi restaurant. Every our request was  accommodated. They try to make your dinner a real ""experience"". Which gives a great feeling of being taken care of.
  
Back to entries Eggplant Bharta. We asked to make it mild. Well.. you can not really make this dish mild it is meant to be spicy..But hey managed. Funny.. mild on a beginning it gives you a ""kick""  a couple of sends later. We actually asked to make another one like it, so we can take it home!
Naan. Excellent. Another item we ordered more for take out, we enjoyed later.

Prices:
Surprisingly inexpensive. The portions are quite big. We ordered Mango Lassie, which was twice the size of any lassie we had before, price however was $3.50? 
I almost was ready to say to our waiter that this is to cheap, and they should raise the price (but, of course I  did not say anything)

Not the best buffet in Vegas and not the cheapest (running about $12.95), but you can expect some good spice from the buffet options.

What sets Gandhi India Cuisine's buffet aside from other Indian buffets in Vegas is the surprising spice.  The general tendency in an Indian buffet is to keep it bland.  The buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy.  But cheers to Gandhi for not skimping on the spice.  

They usually have several vegetarian options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes.  There's some real hit and miss going on with the dishes.  I loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken tikka masala.  And thumbs up for the naan and the okra dish.  

That said, many of the dishes simply fall flat.  Problem is, at $12.95, this is one of the more expensive non-strip buffets and it is simply just not spectactular.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,0,3,F9chTYOu3dj7UN3WBiq45g

Went last week to the lunch buffet, as soon as we sat down they asked what type of naan we wanted and had it to us almost before we finished getting our first plate from the buffet line.

Went again today and I don't know what it was but maybe the boss wasn't around.  After sitting down with our first plate and finishing about half of it we finally had to ask if we were getting any naan and to do that we had to interrupt the waiters cell conversation.  When the naan came five minutes later it was somewhat burnt which I don't really care about but the person I was with didn't really care for.   We arrive well before the end of the lunch buffet but shortly after we sat down they started prepping the other tables for dinner, kind of made it feel like there was a rush for us to finish.  Again we had to get our own water refills.

If you happen to eat at this dump that's decorated to be some type of indian EDM dance club, you will probably end up like Ghandi and want to fast for the next several days. The one and only waiter was so big and tough looking and acting that it seemed like he should have been a Sultan's bodyguard instead of in the customer service business. What I want to say is that this guy is the world's worst waiter but is so intimidating that I wouldn't dare complain about it (to his face). Their prices are too high for low quality food.

2386306,2011-04-08,3,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,"wow. such an upgrade since i used to spend countless lunch buffets with coworkers, back in the day when i used to work in the howard hughs pkway offices... i took my wife there for lunch just last week.

the GRUB:
- chutneys and sauces galore
- plenty of your veggie favorites: stewed chick peas, saag paneer (spinach with cheese), curry potatoes and peas, fried onion dumplings, and other dishes - all delicious
- meat too - tandori grilled chicken, chicken tikka, butter chicken, etc.
- got bread and carbs? basatmi rice, naan, rice cakes, spicy noodle dish, samosas... all good.
- dessert: mango custard with fruit, fried brown sugar pastries in a sugary syrup sauce, and fresh fruit - yummy.
- hot tea, coffee, mango lassi, sodas and juices available.

the JOINT:
- such a turn around from when i used to frequent years back... the white table clothes have been replaced by all wood tables covered by fancy black linens... the open balcony now houses private dining areas perfect for parties that want an intimate booth... even the buffet section is granite counter tops with built in buffets - fancy. much fancier than the old tables with the buffet heat trays...
- indian decor - many intricate paintings and woodwork abound, including a huge wooden hand carved goddess at the entry... floor to ceiling curtains and fabrics of india surround you. very nice.
- plenty of seating
- clean and upscale (especially for a buffet)

the SQUEEZE:
- friendly and attentive service as always.
- about $25 per person for lunch - a little pricey.
- cash and card accepted

the FINAL SAY:
my wife and i enjoyed our lunch buffet, and it kept us full for most of the day... and for me, it was such a pleasant surprise to see that the owner has done so much to upgrade on such a great indain buffet restaurant.",25NDlYy0wzjq7mh3IiCp0Q,4,4,4,cDLc9OR0sY04RwBJborW2g

What caught my attention were the people.  Dozens of Indian people headed into the restaurant.  Hmm.  ""Best of Las Vegas"" proclaimed the banner.  In this place?  What the heck, my last Vegas review was Fatburger, let's diversify a bit.

The restaurant itself is well appointed, clean, comfy.  Check.
Lots of people on the buffet line.  Is there a buffet tonight?  No, they said, that's just for the private party.  Which turned out to be a BUSLOAD of Indian people.  

No matter.  I looked at the menu, and ordered one of their combo dishes, along with a large Flying Horse.

Within minutes, complimentary papadum arrived, along with a tamarind sauce and a cilantro sauce.  To my surprise, the papadum were awesome.  Hot, crisp, tasty.  The sauces were excellent as well.

The combo arrived and the food continued to impress.  I haven't had Indian food this tasty and authentic since I was back in NY.  One thing I disliked was the dish - a metal plate with compartments which reminded me of a TV dinner.  I would have preferred to see several small plates, but I guess that would be more work.

The combo included a choice of dessert, and I passed up my usual kheer in favor of a pistachio kulfi ice cream recommended by my server.  It was AMAZING, except for the spoon (see below).

Reading the other reviews, either they have improved dramatically, or perhaps I was the beneficiary of stumbling on this place on a night where they knew they had to have their A game on (or risk upsetting said busload of people).

I would award 4 stars, except that my napkin was slightly dirty, and the spoon accompanying my dessert was clearly dirty as well (as in the dishwasher didn't do a good job).

When it comes to food, it is average not so good. That day their staff was in hurry to kick us out without letting us to finish our food. Never be treated like that. We decided not to come to this place ever. 

But because of our friend's food desperation and also went through with two other indian resturants(seeing long waiting lines), we have ended up here again during xmas2017 visit. Our bigest mistake was we did not ask the buffet price, thinking it will be normal charges ranging min $12 to max. $15.  Food was very good on that day specially bhindi masala/okra curry was tested freshly made eventhough we arrived at 1:00pm. May be they were out of other curry and replaced with this. Anyway most of buffet dishes veg. and non veg. were very tasty except naan as usual buffet naan never taste good in most of places but that was ok for us. Incident happen when my husband was eating his samosa with green chutney and he found green wire in green chutney(one we use to close plastic bags in store), we informed to waiter and he said ok ok i will let kitchen staff know, nothing else. Thinking that how horribly they manage and care in the kitchen. Although overall food was great, so we neglected that incident, and also their service. but when they charged us $20 per person for our buffet plus added gratuity where service was zero, we were stunned (unethical business behavior).

Request to owner

* Please keep eyes on your staff how they treat your customers, our both experience were horrible.
* Courteous behavior in food industry is very much needed. 
* Make place little bit spacious so other people's chair don't stuck on the way when we go to serve ourselves from buffet
* In second trip, buffet was ridiculously overpriced, please don't change the price in order to take advantage of holiday season. Its not ethical.

My wife normally loves the tandori chicken but today it was EXTREMELY dry and unedible. We told our waiter about it and he takes the piece of dry chicken from our table and takes it to the back kitchen and seemed to tell the cook that the chicken was bad. Well, no follow up, no apology and he seemed to laugh it off with the female waitress that seemed to be flipping the dry pieces, just picking at them. I've kind of noticed the food was getting lower in quality lately, but didn't say much since it was my wife's favorite Indian lunch buffet. Even the solidly prepared mango lassi was full of ice pieces, didn't taste good and didn't arrive to the table until my plate was nearly finished. I didn't even go for seconds, since there really wasn't anything worth going back for. We have other choices for Indian food and next time it won't be here.

I don't know, man..... I just don't really know what else to say. This place was just average I guess. I was there for the lunch buffet and to repeat Misti Y., it did seem like for what they offered combined with freshness level, it was a tad pricey. I did think the food tasted really good, and I liked the vegetarian dishes and both dessert options. They had a carrot/raisin pudding and a sweet rice noodle/coconut pudding. Mixed together, it was so friggin' GOOD! 

Now here's the major bummer. One of my favorite things is Indian ""Nan"" bread. I was NOT feein' this place's nan (at least, not on the buffet). It's supposed to be somewhat fluffy and soft. This place's nan seemed like it had sat out too long or something, because it was flat and pretty hard in places. It was disappointing, because it is meant to be ripped up and used to scoop up the yummy rice and curry mix with your hands. I couldn't even rip off a piece anywhere without getting a hard, unbend-able hunk of bread.

I was recommended to try the Kingfisher beer, which apparently is a popular beer consumed in India. It's a light beer, but has a bitter, hoppy kick to it.. Unfortunately, I had to flag down a waiter just to order it. 
They sat us down, and just left. My mom wanted to go up and get a plate immediately, but I told her to wait a few minutes because at a buffet, they are supposed to come over and ask what you want to drink. No one ever came. We just sat there staring at each other for five minutes while waiting for someone to stop by the table, to no avail. Kinda odd.

Maybe I will come back for dinner, but I feel like I could find an Indian restaurant just as good (if not better) for less money. For two lunch buffets and a beer, the bill was like $34! Holy S*IT!

I would definitely go here if I had more friends who like Indian food or ate out as much as I used to. This place is a lot older. But I live right up the street from this place and if I got tired of frequenting Mint Indian Bistro on Flamingo, I would go here to get a change of setting. I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans. My friend likes this place more than Mint, so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians...

Again, because it sits in a terrible neighborhood, the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes. I don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but I hear they are pretty good.

The decor has antique wood and has a fine dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water glass. But, this seems to be  a common theme for all of the Indian Restaurants, they are very properly set.

The Indian food buffet is a good deal, but if I had patience I would order off the menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful.",Y8akYgxl9PkE5LsZxwqRfg,0,0,3,pKA47kH_qWsuXKa21fTFpg

When I was here for dinner a little over a year ago, the buffet (the matter paneer in particular) was fan-flippin-tastic.  Service was great, the food was amazing, and I swore an oath to myself that I would somehow come back here.

I was in Vegas with my fiancé this past weekend and, even though he's not big on Indian food, I talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was.

Womp Womp.

Did they change ownership??  There's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore.  ""Well, I can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet, but at least I can order the matter paneer off the menu,"" I thought.  There was one nice host/busser, one food runner, and one disinterested waiter, which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked up.  The naan was sub-par; more burnt air bubbles than anything.  My beloved matter paneer was totally different.  It wasn't bad.  Actually, it was pretty decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We sat at the table, done eating, plates cleared, for a loooong time before I was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check.

Jeff and I were driving towards the hotel, when I spotted Gandhi out of the corner of my eye.  Knowing that he likes India, having lived there for over a year, I thought he might like to try.  I am always willing to try a new Indian place.  

I got a combination plate that had chicken tikka, some marinated chicken, kafta chopped up and a grilled shrimp.  The plate also came with some lentils, rice, raita, lettuce,paneer in a curry sauce and a curry with shrimp in it.  

Jeff got a vegetarian plate that had the same rice, raita and lentils, but he also got a cauliflower dish (I don't remember the name) and some other curried vegetable.  He ate it all, so I know he liked it, but I don't think he loved it.  

I loved pretty much everything I got, except the lentils. They needed something.  Salt?  The paneer was delicious.  It reminded me of the fresh cheese my grandmother used to make.  The shrimp curry was delicious, just the right amount of heat to it.  The raita was tasty.  The rice was nothing special.

I liked the naan.  I ate several pieces and I don't normally do that.  

Jeff ordered a mango lassi.  He asked that they make it special with no milk, just yogurt.  They did that and he loved it.  He might have ordered another, if he weren't so full.  

The service started off really well, but then it went downhill from there.  We got the food and then we never saw the waiters again. They were busy serving others.  So, we waited forever for the bill and a box to take home the leftovers.  

The decor was kinda nice, kinda funky, kinda dark and kinda fashionable.  I liked certain parts of the restaurant, like the giant wooden Ganesh near the entrance.  The red on the walls was nice.  The paintings weren't anything special.  They turned up the lights for us, so we could read the menu. There were some special rooms that could be shut off with curtains.  I liked that touch.

First, they raise their prices when they feel it's appropriate - Christmas week. Yes, the week, not the day. How do you justify with no additional menu items? Next, Naan is part of the buffet and good but dry - most buffets serve fresh naan at the table. There was no patek paneer - I know, amazing huh?

The service is alright.  I usually go thirsty for water.  Remember, your lassi is not included in the buffet price.  They do have large bus tours of people who come here en masse, so rub your rabbit's foot to make sure you don't show up at the same time.

4974710,2006-11-28,1,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,"Desperate for some Indian food, we were referred to Gandhi's India's Cuisine.  We arrived at 3:30 pm, only to discover they don't open for dinner on a Saturday until 5 pm.  As we debated whether it was worth waiting for, a couple of guys pulled up next to us and RAVED about place...saying ""It's REALLY good...It's HELLA good...""  So, hearing this, we had to come back at 5 pm and so we did...what a mistake!

As we piled in at 5:30 pm, we looked around at the customers already seated. Lots of Indians were already dining and we took this as a good sign...and then we saw the buffet table set up.  Hmmm...we were hoping for an a la carte menu.  Unfortunately, they only had the buffet option available and so we were stuck with that.  

We ordered Mango Lassi to drink and that was a highlight.  Then we all loaded up for the buffet line.  Gandhi's offers a mix of North and South Indian cuisines and I was disappointed with pretty much everything available.  I usually want Indian food when I desire lots of rich spices and tastes going on, and all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors.  There was no spice, no heat, nothing that stood out! Blah!  

They offered mint-cilantro sauce, but no pappadoms!  Argh.  I love pappadoms and they didn't have any!  I was already disappointed!  I love naan bread in general, but usually try the garlic or onion kinds, or whatever else is offered.  Not at this place, they just had plain naan bread that lacked any real flavor.  Everything had potatoes in it, too much potatoes if any.

One of my dining companions felt that she didn't eat her money's worth and went back for dessert - the mango/condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail.  We all agreed that was the only thing worth eating there.  How sad is that?!

Sure...I ate...I was hungry.  It wasn't particularly good Indian food.  It was just that...food, and nothing else.

This restaurant was noted as award winning and ""Best Ethnic Restaurant in Las Vegas"" at one point.  I would assume they were a pretty decent Indian restaurant some time ago, but no longer.  I guess it's a sign when an Indian restaurant starts out with an a la carte menu, then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing, it means hard times.  They are strapped and desperate for business.  Too bad I won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless I'm dragged.  Yeah, for the price of less than $17/pp, you get more bang for your buck this way, but that's not why I came to Gandhi's to eat.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,2,3,2,w17oDruIn4XCrNe49Y7yxg

Seriously, outside of downtown, they're everywhere, and wedged in between all the nail salons and paycheck-advance stores, you can find some pretty good restaurants, if you don't mind the less-than-breathtaking surroundings.

Gandhi is a solid, reliable Indian restaurant that we've been going to for years.  The building is mysteriously huge, with super-high ceilings and a dining area that goes on for miles, but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends.  The decor is nothing fancy - bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures - but you're not there for the ambience, you're there for tons of spicy food.

When you sit down, they'll plop some pappadom down in front of you (those crunchy cracker-like flatbreads), plus a mint-cilantro sauce and a sweet-and-sour sauce.  I love this stuff, but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce, because water service can be a bit slow here.

Everything here is good, especially the garlic naan.  The tandoori chicken is yummy, as is the rogan josh, palak paneer, and tikka masala.  Entrees range from $10--12, although they also have special tasting menus (including salad, rice, and dessert) that range from $15--22.  They have a lunch buffet on weekdays that's also an excellent value.  And there's a pretty good selection of beer and wine, including a few Indian beers, to go with your meal.

Nothing fancy decor- or ambience-wise, Gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably priced Indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting.  If Vegas isn't already hot enough for you, spice it up with a trip to Gandhi.  And get the garlic naan!",Ffa1cXIvFAy8H1sorICaiQ,1,2,4,VcWw5AJnFHw7WCqBLEdfjA

The buffet was large with plenty of vegetarian selections, and the food was good. I thought the flavors were tempting; they led me back for a second plate, but the vegetables were a tad overcooked, and hence, some things did not appear to be the freshest. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but when I find myself thinking about the interior and cost, I know that the food was not mind-blowingly delicious. At $12 the price is not the best value for Indian buffet, which is always a consideration for me. (The star rating is largely a reflection of the price.) Plus, since visiting Gandhi, I have revisited my go-to Indian buffet to confirm my taste buds preference.

The interior is quite impressive, a remodel since the days of the overhead carpet, and a stark contrast to the exterior surroundings. There are private rooms in the back, and I could see hosting a small private dinner here, as the restaurant feels spacious and nice.

I am pure non vegetarian & my wife is vegetarian. And we visit Vegas several times every year since last 17 years. I have dined at many desi restaurants here. This is my second review of Gandhi. Last time I gave a 3 star not because their food was not good but because of other reasons. but now they deserve better rating. The lamb curry is fantastic (my all time favorite) & so was the chicken tikka masala.  My wife loves the malai kofta & so did I. We love their rice & dal fry too. And no, they don't use plastic ware or paper cups for buffet anymore. I have dined in many Indian restaurants all throughout the US & I think Gandhi is one of my favorite North Indian restaurant. Their Indian buffet definitely ranks in top 3 in the US. Good job team!!",z_JkIG8B3FzeFXyGJ6NM9w,0,0,5,L1MxzE1JRIyLxwQc4HSxqA
5650841,2017-10-13,0,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,"Truly disappointing lunch buffet. I've been to Gandhi a few times and its been pretty good. This is the first time I tried the lunch buffet and, the fact that I felt compelled to leave a review, should be an indicator of how I felt my meal went. First of all, no one at the front when I came in, i came in and looked at the buffet line and then waited for roughly 2-3 minutes to even see an employee, they finally sat me and I got my first round of food. The tandoori chicken was nearly cold and hard as a rock, the side that was on the chafing dish was charred to a crisp (not always a bad thing). I informed the young waiter that the tandoori chicken was cold, he went and took the temperature of the chicken, said something to his, what looked to be his boss, then closed the lid. Clearly it was under temperature and he tried to reheat it in this way... huge health hazard that could get them closed in of itself. No biryani, only 3 meat dishes and all were chicken, no naan or rice on the buffet line so it had to be brought out which seemed to be difficult to even find someone to help. My drink remained empty for the majority of my meal even though a waiter kept walking by. I finally asked for a refill and it took him about 8 minutes to bring me my refill. Sweet rice for dessert? what the hell is that? Literally their basmati rice that they serve to everyone, mixed with milk and sugar. It was disgusting and the rice was under cooked. I'm Indian... I have never heard of this recipe before.... for 11.95... its a rip off. Enjoy GOOD indian food and drive a block up to Delhi Indian Cuisine.",_5WiyZPNhe-VuqdoJDqX5g,0,0,1,04fakGOohgv-2Wd7wrCh9A

When we walked in, we were told they dont serve ala carte items and only buffet option. But what they didnt tell us was, they wont refill the buffet items. Whatever items we asked, they said its over and not be refilled. The tandoori chicken was too unflavourful and tasted. None of the Paneer dishes had paneer. Idli was too hard and made days ago. They just heated the frozen idlis and served them. The only thing they refilled was plain rice and Naan. Desserts were also bad.

The service is ok but not great. But definitely not worth the price you pay for the buffet.",B3_r_SIOgsyZHA6mioAexA,4,1,1,i-WRL1kINKq_Qeg-Q5w84g
5734673,2010-10-01,1,S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA,Solid value in the all you can eat lunch buffet. Carb overload usually sets in 30 minutes later but worth it. The service is okay the decor works. They could turn down the music a little. It felt a little cluby during the day. They have a chutney with olives that I put on most everything. It's spicy and bitter at the same time but I like it.

The restaurant itself is squeezed behind an Albertsons (next to a wig shop) but don't let that deter you!  Inside is very nice, and open.  Everything I had on the buffet was delicious (and I tried a little bit of almost everything!) and the servers kept our water glasses full and our table clear of abandoned plates.

I would definitely recommend this to others, and I will return (if only for the tikka masala...omg so delicious).  My friend told me that regionally, this restaurant favored the northern styles of cooking and most of the others nearby are more southern in orientation.  So keep that in mind if this is not entirely what you expected.  I found everything to be delicious.
