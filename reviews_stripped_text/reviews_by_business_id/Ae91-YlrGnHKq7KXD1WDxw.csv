111222,2012-04-21,0,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"I am in love with this place.  I randomly stopped in here and had a vegetarian burger with everything known to man smothering out what was suppose to be semi-healthy!  Let me say, WOW! I chowed down.  I was not at all upset by the heavy handed helping of fries that I ordered with my burger.  The choice selection of sauces doesn't hurt either.

I cant speak for the hamburgers, but the vegetarian burger was a hit for me.  I even got to see exactly what went in it.",qQiHdR_B9YxaIOcqJ876wA,0,0,5,gUGDZYavEmMONA1MAj0XMw
124265,2012-06-14,0,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"I tend to kill the surprise and hesitate to write any sort of lengthy review when I eat a burger that sucks, and this is probably going to be no exception. Finding myself on the south end of the strip with an hour to kill in between meetings the other day, I went to my phone to check for anything nearby that might be new and different. Sadly the only thing close by was American Burger Works at the lovely Excalibur, as I had been to pretty much everything else directly around me. No cliffhanger here, but read on if you want to know why it sucked so badly.

The restaurant is pretty utilitarian and simple from the garage doors at the entry, to the minimal amount of treatment to their open ceiling, to the simple furniture. The menu is equally as simple: make your own burger from a small list of meat, bun and topping choices and 15 different sauces. Hasn't the whole 'design your own burger' thing been played out? Regardless of the restaurant, if they offer a burger I can probably order it however I want so this isn't really so unique of a concept is it? The fact that their website mentions they bring ""a new twist to the classic burger and fries combo"" is laughable.

Going with the theme, I decided to keep my burger nice and simple so that I could taste a basic sample of what they offer. My burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, Jack Daniel's ketchup and Swiss cheese came out looking as boring as I had imagined. The bun was dry and difficult to eat. The meat was also very dry; the whole assembly was a vacuum of moisture in my mouth. How's that for a nice mental picture? The meat didn't really have great flavor so that didn't help much either. Between the meat and measly melted cheese something was very salty at random points throughout as well. The tomatoes were unnoticeable, the lettuce was ok, and the pickles were decent. Notice I didn't mention anything about my fancy ketchup; more on that in a minute.

The thick cut Belgium French fries were flavorless and almost hollow inside as they can sometimes be when overcooked. If these were cooked right they might have been ok, but I can't promise much. And now a note about their special sauces and horrible service. As I mentioned they have 15 sauces to choose from, I chose the Jack Daniel's ketchup for something a bit neutral as to not take over my burger. When I ordered I was informed it would be on the side which was fine, but when I got my burger there was no sauce on the side, so I went back to counter to ask for it. The man behind the counter pointed to the condiment ketchup in the corner next to the soda machine. I told him if that's my one free sauce then I would like a different sauce and was told I'd have to pay extra for a second variety. Either this guy that spoke no English didn't understand me at all or this place is a total rip off with their sauces. At $15.12 for a burger, fries and drink on the strip isn't the end of the world, but for the quality and service it's about $15.12 too much. All I can say is, this place is horrible.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,0,1,9BSEmhHSN4LueimNDjTOHg
281294,2012-07-20,0,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"I was really hoping for this one. While in Las Vegas last week, I really wanted a good burger after experiencing a lot of crappy Vegas food. Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. Not only was the burger flavorless and expensive, you are only allowed to have 2 of the 15 sauces they offer. When I was surprised to hear that a customer is only given 2 tiny servings of the sauces, the server just replied, ""I only wear the shirt"". Nice. My son and I had shakes (which were $5 each) and they were just ok. When we walked in, I had noticed that there were other customers already present with shakes and their shakes had whipped cream. Our shakes did not get any whipped cream. After my experience with the employee about the sauces, I did not bother to comment about the whipped cream. Not that I need the extra calories, but come on, it would have been nice to be given an option. The entire time I ate my burger, I just kept thinking how Five Guys and In-N-Out were SO much better. I walked away from that place extremely disappointed and wanting a better meal. That's too bad.",nvlSeUcYEMWsjMGo1KRmmA,0,0,2,2h9joy5GlIoiq3mZfTbCOA

742985,2012-05-09,0,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"I really enjoyed their burgers and fries. The bun on the burger was not too hard or soft and didn't have sesame seeds, which annoy the hell out of me. They didn't put too much cheese, and you get to pick all your toppings when you order, with things like bacon and avocado costing extra. There are three different patty options--beef, turkey, and veggie--and you can get any of them doubled for an extra charge, and they cook each patty to perfection. They make the best fries I've tasted while in Nevada, hands down. I only tried the honey mustard and ranch sauces while I was there, but sometime I will go back and try the rest.

For being sure to tell you they make breakfast, they have a fairly limited menu for that, but I can understand as it's meant more as a fast food style burger place, just a notch above McD's, BK and the like. However, I think they could improve their hash browns, since when I go to a place like this I don't expect them to re-heat one of those pre-made frozen hash brown patties made by Ore-Ida. If they can make up fresh pancakes AND fries, hash browns shouldn't be a problem either.

Spent $17 for a burger and fries, which in Vegas isn't totally out of line but certainly on the high side for a venue like Excalibur.  With 2 customers in the place (including me), it took over thirty minutes to get my food, while I watched one of the workers that was supposed to be getting my food take a break to eat.  Apparently he was hungry, and the two paying customers weren't as hungry as he was.  When he was done, he came back to ask me what I had ordered.  

After the grueling wait, I discovered that the food itself was good enough.  Unfortunately, within minutes of finishing it, I had to spend the next 3 hours going back and forth to the bathroom.

1688118,2012-08-10,0,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"I went to American  Burger Works after seeing their ad for Belgian fries with 20 difference dipping sauces.  Well, the Belgian fries are nothing more than thick-cut fries.  Apparently, they've changed their policy a bit since previous reviewers were there because you now get 2 sauces with your burger .   I had no idea I didn't get to try a little of this and a little of that...and the guy behind the counter was really snippy with me that I can only try two.  (he didn't tell me there was the option of buying more than two.)  Oh...and although they advertize that they have 20 sauces, they actually only had 14.
The burger for $8 was fine...nothing special.  The fries for $3, also nothing special.  It was all tasty...but nothing above average.  The sauces I tried were an ancho chili sauce and an olive sauce - both were good.  I'd eat here again but I wasn't impressed with the sauce dude.  I realize that in Vegas, they don't have to worry about repeat business and therefore, they can be as snippy as they want.

2359000,2012-04-05,14,Ae91-YlrGnHKq7KXD1WDxw,"Excalibur is so dated. Walking around the hotel and casino takes me back to 1997, when all I had in life was a PlayStation, AOL email account, and acne.

Clearly, the ladies were not knocking on my door. So I drowned my sorrows out in wrinkly tissues, crumpled Playboys, and of course, fatty food.

American Burger Works takes me back to that time when I would binge eat to make myself feel better. In January, my awful place of employment punished me by sending me on 11 day trip to Las Vegas, a fabricated city full of depression in the middle of desert. Naturally, I grew even more depressed. So I spent 4 of my nights eating dinner here. Yes, I would consume 3,500 calories in one sitting. Sober.

The staff here is friendly and accommodating. The menu is straightforward and simple. No matter what you choose, it's going to be a big burger made to your specifications. The bun will be crispy, the meat will be juicy, and you will be happy.

The Belgium style fries are optional, but might as well be mandatory. They are so unbelievably delicious. And the milk shakes, with chocolate candy add ins, are a really sweet way to finish your massive meal off. Burp. Fart. Food coma.

The gift and the curse of this place has to be the Belgium fries and the variety of dipping sauces. They have over a dozen different flavors like chili-cilantro sour cream, Sriracha ketchup, and bacon mustard. They are awesome and make the fries that much better.

The first dipping sauce is free, but all additional sauces are $1. Look, I have a $500 iPad and a $300 iPhone, but I won't even spend 99 cents on an app. So maybe I am bit cheap. But when it comes to food, I don't mind splurging. Sadly, the $1 gives you a tiny thimble of dipping sauce. Personally, I want a bit more for my buck.

In the end, I am still huge fan of this place. But I can no longer fit in my 33x32 slim fit jeans. Burp. Fart. Ugh.",0kSXMbNFo7mdwTPj4iQv9A,9,8,4,KEdvz1OTM2KwxRYCOyzstQ

Let's start with the service. They forgot several items that we ordered after coming up to get our food. No apologies, just lack of attention to detail. The sauces in a Yogurtland taster cup were $1 each! That's kind of a slap in the face when you can barely dip a fry in it.

As for the food, I hate when the bun overpowers the meat. If I want deep dish bread I'll go to Chicago. The meat was overcooked and the only thing that was consistent was the toppings. 

I went back and forth whether I should give this place 2.5 stars, but figured, the burger is better than a fast food one. The belgian fries were not as advertised either. I've had much better ones before and I wish they'd step it up in all areas. 

Once again, a good fit w/ Excalibur. Underwhelming.",Rjd9Td7yYOqu0A1e2KDAyA,1,1,3,sFaB4KXbtlEMUh51vJoR3w

The fries are tasty too. I thought the price was fair, and just about matches any other burger & fry combo price you'll get around here but with better quality. 

Since I come to Vegas often and I usually have great luck gambling at Excalibur (even though I don't stay there), I plan to make it a point to get my burgers from here. 

What a great food find in the sea of mediocre semi-fast food joints on the South end of the strip.",bl_ShhYxra-J1q_Bds3i2A,0,1,4,fs2J1rzGBw93dRcVZuI1kQ

There's nothing like a burger to help cure a hangover and a cheeseburger from ABX was the perfect fit. Huge, greasy, loaded with fresh toppings - burgers are one of my favorites and even I couldn't finish this monster.

If I ever hit up the Excalibur again, I will be sure to make a pit stop at ABX.",c7_xsZYNs-_G6IceEW2WoA,1,1,4,irLdJHY6dd4MHiZRRajy0Q

It had the potential to be the hidden gem inside the aging Excalibur, because for me, the first time I tried their fries I was taken aback at the way they had a similar crisp and flavor to the Pommes Frites I've enjoyed in Germany. That changed though on my subsequent visits. Lightning didn't strike twice, and I figured it was a one time thing. Turns out their run ended, and though I was hoping to see if they could replicate the fry experience, at least there are plenty of other decent burger places around Vegas.",t9MtHB_hwKfwkW0Ie1yEoQ,0,0,3,DUmMbHoob0arugCgMTksKQ

Had a cheeseburger twice, their fries are soooooo yummy! And had a breakfast burrito. Only thing that sucks and why I dropped a star is because they only let you have one sauce and they have a good variety to choose from but only one sauce??

AMAZING FOOD! Everyone we went with thought they were spectacular! Even our vegetarian friend loved the burgers and having that option along with Turkey burgers is a really good way to bring in customers. 

I tried Turkey, Beef and a breakfast burger and they were all great. The fries were the best fries I have ever had, plus the choice of 10+ sauces gave you a lot of options. TRY THE RANCH!!

There is not many places in the area for a decent quick bite thats not on the scavenger levels of McDonalds but also not up to the royal and wallet abusing feeling one can get at one of Las Vegas best steakhouse.  Instead its a burger joint.  Slightly overpriced but very versatile in its selections.

ABX offer burgers and fries with a variety of sauces to choose from.  I've been here twice.  Once I had a turkey burger, and on a different occassion I had the regular burger.  Both were good, neither was great.  The fries were just ok as well.

Tried the BBQ burger and was pleasantly surprised.Came back and tried a standard burger a day later and liked it too. Look, I'm not a huge fan of Excalibur, but if you're stuck there on a business trip like I was, you have to make the best of it. Solid burgers in what would otherwise be considered a black hole of fast food. 

The thick cut fries are pretty good, too.",6iA76ElEaEcyl0v2epbUPw,1,0,4,nY_r3X5e7FZXHTXeNw-ppw
