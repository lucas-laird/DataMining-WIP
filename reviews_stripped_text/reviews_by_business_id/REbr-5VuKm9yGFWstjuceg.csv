It's simple a sandwich, chips, and drink... sounds like perfection to me... there for sure better then subway I'll be honest!",0OnJVN7vsR6oNXQ4WtUpKQ,0,0,5,dLpMAd6jbxSdSB81MZoUPg

I am pleased to witness continued hand washing, the application of gloves, and attention to overalls cleanliness.

Particular for me, they do not play loud rock music!  The environment is very relaxed and comfortable.",o8Xvw9W5OqzirWIdk3d6JQ,0,0,5,RfBiCmbqoyxN6f8GNo-92g

Then a few employees walked away, and started laughing about it. I wish I'd have just gotten a refund for my whole order and left. Won't come here again.",LMUQmtEzIhlpx0voGgEQ9A,0,0,1,J5L1aZHjZaZtkKNZ3U5ddQ
2026413,2018-04-23,0,REbr-5VuKm9yGFWstjuceg,"I ordered the Italian sandwich, it was mediocre but was not bad. Reason I only leave one star is because some guy that is apparently a regular there walked up to me when I was in line and asked me if I'm done ordering yet... Not sure who in their right mind would approach someone they don't know in line ordering food and ask him if they're done ordering yet. The cashier at the moment didn't ask the gentleman to wait his turn, so I had to take matters into my own hands and make sure the  fellow had his attitude adjusted correctly and not to make rude and disrespectful comments to people he doesn't know. Additionally, the girl that handed me my sandwich was not very friendly at all. I would most likely not return to this location, at least not by choice.",GTCKY8Vaos3Bz8SoXyC0qQ,0,0,1,0JOsM2P5yHz34RwkYnGSgw
2195607,2018-03-01,0,REbr-5VuKm9yGFWstjuceg,NOT HAPPY!!  They charge .50 for wheat when other Jimmy John;'s don't and they added ham to a #15 which I did not want and charged me $1.75 for same.  Very unresponsive to my displeasure.,1Urll8Z37Y5fxVTyn-pkJQ,0,0,1,5D8VlTmlDf5b1vFrsMrWvA

I still feel like my sub could use way more substance since I do not get any meat!!!

*The one on Charleston was always great so maybe I'll check them out. Not as close to my house but if food is better always worth driving.",IefVUTqnZEmMjqW5LCkUPg,0,0,3,TF44cwfMoOLetjRDkjM25A

Hardly got my meal paid for and before I can walk away from the register, it's ready! Just as they claim, ""Subs so fast you'll freak!""",92JI8iSkYuIABHvW_1Mm-A,0,0,4,O-ODYxzEtZ8Kgpp7k7Gsgg

But it's close and convenient when I'm too tired to cook. Plus the veggies, meat and bread are always fresh. I won't be ordering from this location again as it has become a total waste of money.",4VwisZLO-LxfBEScMuwcPg,1,0,2,pgyc5M4F8kH2Rizb24IA4A

4966457,2017-05-23,0,REbr-5VuKm9yGFWstjuceg,"I have always had a good experience at Jimmy Johns.  This was the first time at this location.  We were greeted when we walked in which was nice.  After our sandwiches were prepared I asked for napkins and was told they are at the end of the counter.  I looked at the end of the counter and realized they were on the inside counter. I had to reach over the counter to get napkins.  She was so busy doing nothing that she couldn't hand me napkins.  My fiancee and I sat down and noticed a guy walking in who was about ready to start his shift giving the middle finger on both hands to the employees inside.  Also, the employees were so loud we couldn't hear our conversation. They were also swearing in their conversations.  I will never visit this location again.  No proffessionalism. I strongly suggest if you have kids, go to another location.",ttpyXy8x7NAtPSF2YI7zYA,0,0,1,2TZUfSqq5Vcy7downW7wUA

They are very clean, nice size and great service.  My wife and I both got the un-which.  It's a sandwhich wrapped in lettuce for those laying off bread.  It was very tasty and we will be back for more.",keBv05MsMFBd0Hu98vXThQ,0,1,5,CtY3PxMj3Wqyq_as1YiTRQ
