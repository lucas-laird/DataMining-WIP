I don't think I ever remember have bad or mediocre service here, and the food always comes out just in time. I'm giving it 4 stars because the food to price ratio doesn't match to me. I always end up either ordering more or stopping by somewhere later because I'm still hungry. I think they should either lower the price or add more food.

---Took at least 1/2 hour for our order to be ready when we were told that this would be only 15 mins. max.  We did not order a lot, nor anything extravagant.
---The entree they were correcting (which they said was the reason why it took so long) was the wrong entree.  Couldn't take it back as it was a ""to-go"" order, so by the time we got the whole order home, it's a done deal.
---The noodles on the pad thai tasted old.
---They forgot the ice coffee I ordered, which was only included after I reminded them.

Reasons for the 2 stars:
--Staff was friendly.
--Pineapple fried rice was good and tasty.

I was barely finishing my main dish when the front desk lady just left the receipt on my table. No words, no smiles... This is a pet peeve of mine. I find it rude that people handed receipts when they haven't even enjoyed their food. 


When I looked at the receipt my mango sticky rice wasn't there. My dessert loving self stopped one of the servers and requested for it the second time. Again, sticky rice was good. But my receipt got handed back to me first even before the food came out.

The beef and basil is one of my favorite Thai dishes. Archis makes their beef a little bit different than I'm used to, however it ended up being better. Instead of throwing in chunks of meat, they instead pounded it so that it almost had a ground beef (but not) look to it. The texture was very soft and the taste was on point. I like things pretty spicy, an 8 here isn't too spicy, next time I'll do 10

My friend is a very picky eater, so picky last time we had Thai, he got chow mein. I had him get the pad Thai this time and he loved it so much he had it both days in a row.

My second trip I got the kung pow chicken/shrimp combination. Again, it was on point.

I have to admit I let the one, although pretty bad, experience keep me from dining at Archi's for quite some time.  I returned only because my girlfriends wanted to meet for Thai and I wanted to enjoy their company.  I'm glad I went!

The place was packed around 1pm (assuming most diners were from the office spaces surrounding ).  It had a great energy and service ran smoothly considering the rush.  The lunch specials they had to chose from all looked amazing and was a pretty good deal.  

I decided on the chicken red curry lunch special and a thai iced tea.  The special came with a soup and egg roll.  I found the portion just right for $8.  The red curry had just the right amount of spice but the flavor was out of this world!  The ingredients were fresh and chicken broke apart easily (not chewy!) I love Thai iced tea but thought it was a little too much on the sweet side.

The sauce was packaged in a soup container, exactly as it should be. The noodles were jammed into a small foil container...there were hardly any noodles and they were all gummed together. This is the reason for only 3 stars. A Thai restaurant should know the best way to package their food for takeout, and the rice noodles were not packed well.

When you step inside, it looks like a modern bistro with a Southeastern touch that lets you know that you are in a Thai restaurant. Inside the restaurant you can smell the fresh herbs that are used in the dishes such as the mint leaf, basil, lemon leaf, ginger, lemon basil and of course the chilli. The dominant aroma were definitely more citrusy. However, the aroma was not overwhelming. The place is well ventilated, clean, and the layout of the tables were carefully thought out. It is a good size bistro, not many people during the hours that I went but it was quiet yet very welcoming. 
The dish that I ordered was the Pad Kee Mao. The Pad Kee Mao is a pan noodle that is stir fried with an assortment of herbs and chillies. It is salty yet there was a perfect harmony that was created with the balance of salt, sugar and spice. You will also get a hint of the citrus from the basil and lime juice which is refreshing, and it contours well with the spice from the chilli. The texture of the noodles were soft, smooshy and not overly cooked to where it taste hard and charred; there is a smooth texture to it and sometimes may feel slimy but that is just from the flavorful sauce it creates when stir frying pan noodles. Pad Kee Mao can be cooked with your choice of chicken, beef or pork. I had the chicken because I did not want to feel the the stringiness of the chicken with the smooth texture of the pan noodles. That is just my preference but it is only a matter of your taste.",_WMpERD7MER7s16rSNwTvw,0,0,5,wAfix8pvhb-Px5oLCr0bxA

They basically have a majority of my favorites on the lunch special menu, and it includes soup, salad, a fried wonton and a egg roll- and on top of that, it is not even expensive! Plus, another favorite thing about this place is their Thai tea. They serve their Thai tea in a big ass cup with small crushed ice! I love that because you are getting more liquid rather than ice. Plus, there's really no need for a refill with a huge serving of Thai tea like that! I love it! Lol

The decorations of the place and it's atmosphere is clean and elegant. I would to go here on a date with my honey if we were craving Thai food.

The food is excellent.  I recommend the Spicy Basil, the curries, and the Beef Salad.  My wife heartily recommends the Pad Thai.  The dishes are all very flavorful and the portions are generous.  My Spicy Basil provided two meals, while my wife's towering plate of Pad Thai had enough leftovers for two additional meals.  Prices are comparable to other places and reasonable, in my opinion.  We've always gone at lunch time on weekends so we've never had to contend with the crowds that other reviewers mention.

I only have two dings against Archi's.  The first is that their spicy scale (1 - 10) can be inconsistent depending on who's cooking.  I've gotten a 2 before (I'm a white boy with white boy taste buds, come on) and it absolutely lit me up.  And then I've gotten a 1 to be very cautious and it was not even remotely spicy.

The second ding is one of the more common complaints: the staff is not personable or congenial.  At all.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a hostess who looked so absolutely disgusted with existence that you would think that she was just told that Santa isn't real.  No smile, no greeting, just a begrudging walk to our table.  She ended up being our server too.  Mercifully, the rest of the staff picked up the slack and were able to fill most of the voids that she left in the service.

Don't let the occasional grumpiness deter you from this place.  The food is more than worth a few frowns.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,0,0,4,5h6tcbkfTR0fYVPF_zD2PA

I tried this place out recently when I had a really intense craving for Pad Thai at work. I did take-out since I was on my lunch break and waited about 10 minutes for my food, not bad.

It was pretty packed when I went and most of the customers there were people who worked in the business complexes behind or near the restaurant. 

I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special that comes with an egg roll and wonton. The egg roll was bland and forgettable, and the wonton was basically a deep fried piece of wrapper with a pea-sized piece of meat in it.

To find something like this in Las Vegas was a treat. So how excited was I to hear that they opened up another location closer to home?? The answer: VERY excited. The other location was nice, but this one is all new and seats many more people.

This is probably my favorite restaurant to hit up when I have a craving for Thai. My go-to dish: Pad See Ew with beef. Do yourself a favor and add to it some vinegar spiked with green chili peppers.

Other Archi's menu favs: thai iced coffee, thai iced tea, Tom Yum Shrimp soup, Panang curry, and Pineapple fried rice.

Their lunch specials have great variety (served with soup and egg roll). And you can now order online!",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,0,0,4,83a7MREJpmjE9i2u2QJ8mw

On our last visit, my favorite person and I ordered chicken pad see ew and a minced chicken chili basil dish. The dishes were cooked to perfection with the right amount of spiciness (and we like our food pretty damn spicy).

I start this review by stating I will never, ever come back to the Bistro - Kitchen all the way! 

My husband & I got here at noon on the nose today and though it was pretty packed, we got seated quickly towards the back. A few minutes later a screaming baby came in - that should have been our sign to haul ass out of there but we were starved. 

Both of us ordered the same dish, the red curry with tofu, just at different spice levels - mine a 2, his an 8 (I don't even know how he does that, but I digress!) and very clearly, as the lunch specials have starters with meat typically, tell the waitress that if any starters have meat in them, please don't bring them. She repeats, ""No meat!"" and goes off to the kitchen. 

Ordering is almost 10 minutes into our sitting in the restaurant. During this time, a party of 7 come in (the ones with the kid screaming like a banshee notating our exact location in hell), and the couple next to us have left and have been replaced by another two guys. 

Still waiting. 

The guys next to us get served. And leave. And still no food and hardly any sign of our waitress. Around the 12:40 mark she comes out and says it'll be just another minute and half apologizes while trying to scurry away from our table. 

12:43, our meal finally hits the table. Guess what folks? Both are red curries - with chicken. HOW DID SHE NOT NOTICE THIS?! It took a single glance to realize it was chicken - their tofu is very distinct and looks nothing like chicken. After a minute of disbelief, I have to flag down the waitress who assures me she said tofu - oh really?? Well it does not matter what you said but that's not what came out and you should have you know, looked at the dish you were about to serve. She apologized, ran back and served our spring rolls that came with the lunch while we waited. After 10 minutes she also offered some Thai tea but we were both not in the mood - I just wanted to eat and unfortunately this gesture did not make up for the fact that our food was late and she couldn't even glance down at the food she was serving. 

We finally get our correct dishes at 1 PM. The curry is decent as usual, but we were so ridiculously disappointed by this point and the busy restaurant we came into was completely cleared out. Yes, the party of 7 had left before we got our second dish. 

This kind of issue is completely inexcusable and I am sincerely amazed that they even bothered to give us a check after waiting so long AND screwing up BOTH orders. I really love their curries and their willingness to cater to vegans, but if this were my first time here I might have actually tried to eat the curry and I can guarantee I would have had a fit of epic proportions. 

The only good thing to come out of this is I'm going to learn to make Thai food at home. Goodbye Thai Bistro, you will never see my face again.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,2,1,1,xSuceznVh7nZwEP8XQW8RQ

I was pondering ordering an 8 or 9 spiciness the next time I came here according to my last review. I have long since discovered that if you convince them you really want it spicy, you just order a number higher than 10. Turns out they have a secret spiciness scale that goes up to 30.

Be warned! The Archi's in Summerlin will give me a 30-spicy dish that is edible and delicious. This Archi's I can not eat past a 20. A 25 was ridiculous. I dare not venture to 30.

 I ordered the country curry because based off the menu it seemed to have come with a lot of vegetables. When the food came out they forgot the brown rice I ordered and there was no eggplant or zucchini in the curry as listed on the description. After I told the server they brought back steamed eggplant but it was about 6 very tiny pieces.

The Massaman curry was very very good as was everything else. They asked us to give each dish a spicy rating 1-10, but I don't think their chefs have that fine control. Everything had a fair amount of heat, but some were spicier than others. We got 7 on the eggplant dish and it didn't seem any hotter than the others. Of course we had to get dessert, so we shared a sticky rice with mango and ice cream. The ice cream was a bit much, but oh so tasty.

I was not impressed with their lunch special selection. The price of $7.95 was decent for the amount of food you get, but they charge extra $1 for brown rice substitution. Really? Around thirty percent of the lunch menu was chinese food, and I don't come to a Thai restaurant to eat the goopy concoction that is sweet and sour chicken. They did not have Pad Kea Mow (drunken noodles) as part of their lunch menu. Bummer. 

I opted to skip the lunch menu and order my drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95) anyway. The portion was large and the taste and quality of ingredients used were superior to many other Thai restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not dry -- a feat only few have been able to accomplish.

The service was a bare minimum. There was no personal interaction; it was drop off your food/drink and quickly run off. I get it, it's busy... but you're doing well so stop being stingy and hire more wait staff. They never brought out Jessie B.'s hot tea, but it was on the final check. She did take it off, but that is carelessness and lack of service at its best.

I've actually been a fan of Archi's from the early 2000's when they only had their original location Archi's Thai Kitchen off of Torrey Pines and Flamingo.. moved away from Vegas for college and came back to find they have 3 total locations, Archi's Thai Kitchen in Spring Valley, Archi Thai Cafe in Summerlin and this location is Southwest Archi's Thai Bistro. I've been to all 3 locations and I have to say that Archi's is definitely one of my most favorite local Thai restaurants. I do know that the owners are from Vegas so I'm all for supporting local business!!

I'm a huge fan of lots of the dishes here because they stick to traditional dishes, simple yet traditional plating, and true Thai spice level options (1-10). I love love love Thai sticky rice, especially to go with the Thai beef jerky!! Thai noodles are probably on the top of my list of favorite types of noodles! Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my top favs and you can never go wrong when having these two dishes!! Papaya salad is always picked when I dine with my family as our salad option, and Panang Curry is the favorite choice of curry! 

Archi's also has great lunch special!! Their plum sweet and sour sauce I find savory and unique but not too far off the traditional path. I'm all for fusion style food places, but I guess I'm more of a tradition gal when it comes to certain styles of Asian food because of my upbringing.. and Thai food is definitely traditional preference for me! 

Food here is leveled on spices just right.. 10 level being Thai spicy. I'm in the 4-6 range, I like the kick in my mouth and a little bit of sweat on my brow.. but I like to still enjoy the food and not have my mouth on fire. I've never experienced terrible service, food comes always rather quickly, and never had a salty plate. Each Thai dish always is solid with the rich Thai spices and full flavor without it being salty. They also offer spice trays upon request to spice up your life or your mouth even more if they didn't add enough. 

Thai food can be a bit on the oily side, but it's never swimming in oil. This location especially is very elegant in their furniture and atmosphere. Their lunch is always busy and packed and always professional individuals in suites always dining here during their lunch times so be prepared to wait during lunch or call in your food early.

Highly recommend this Thai spot and support your local business owners and drop on in here for some authentic Thai cuisine!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,33,34,5,MymPXDPLoeEF9x8KeLqxtw

So when I found out that this location was opening.... I was ecstatic!! :) :) :) of course this was years ago!! Lol and I have faithfully been going to this location since it is just down the street to me. 

I'll start of with the bad and end with the good. And trust me it's not even that bad. Parking can be a hassle at times when it's busy. But it's not under their control.... I'm just mentioning it so that ppl are aware. 

Service here is a hit or miss! Sometimes they are all over it and sometimes they are not present at all and I have to flag someone down just to get my water refilled. :( so service for me is not great. Service (2/5)

Atmosphere is nice. Much nicer then the original on Flamingo. Lol but it is getting a little run down...(4/5)

Finally now for the finale.... The food!!! :)
If u get a chance come for their lunch specials. It's a great deal. I've gotten the pad Thai lunch special and with the salad... Egg roll... Soup.... I always have leftovers.
I've had their papaya salad.... Which is delicious! The papaya is always fresh and crunchy and it is seasoned perfectly. I ask for a 10 and in all the times I've gotten this dish, probably like 30...40 times over the past few years... It's been a 10 once. Which is disappointing but they normally give it to me at like 7 which is still decent. (4.5/5)
Their Thai spring roll is good. If u like Chinese sausage this is delish!! It tastes really fresh with the bean sprouts and cucumbers in it.(4/5)
Chicken fried rice is your normal fried rice. It's good but nothing really stands out from it. (4/5)
Pad Thai... Is always good. The noodles have the perfect texture and the flavor is always balanced. (4.5/5)
Pad Kee Mow... Is da bomb!!! I love love this dish. The first time I had it... I thought that it was delicious and I've never looked back.

The orders:

Pad SeeEw (pork): Best Pad SeeEw i've had (better than Lotus). Simply Perfect..

Pad Thai (beef): Dinner portion came with a serving that could be split with another person. A little sweet but the medley of flavors all together were just right. Another hit! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, not much punch)

Stuffed Chicken: An appetizer sized dish. Came with 2 pieces of chicken drum sticks stuffed with goodness!.. Goes great with the sweet dipping sauce! The slight crunchiness of the skin just incorporates a very nice texture.

Spicy Basil (chicken): The herbs, the spices, the tender bits of chicken.. Wow, this place just doesn't have any flaws!! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, But this time it felt like 3 times Hotter!)

* I asked the waiter ""Why was the Spicy Basil MUCH Hotter than the Pad Thai when I ordered both with 3 out of 10 heat?"" She replied ""because some dishes are spiced/heated with powder chili like the Pad Thai and the Spicy Basil we use the actual Thai chili's so it will be hotter..""

2223019,2011-06-30,2,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"""Archi's"" is a name that always comes up when people talk about Thai in this town. It wasn't until recently, though, that we realized we had one right down the street from us.

The variety on the menu had me sold the first time I pulled up their website. (You can also submit an online order for pickup, and the interface allows for customization.) For the first time, I wondered if I might deviate from my usual ""pad thai with tofu."" The Pineapple Fried Rice, ""stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder,"" had me tempted.

In the end I stuck to my usual, though, beginning with deep-fried tofu to share and chicken satay for Mike. The tofu was unremarkable. Not very crispy, and the sauce was ordinary. Mike liked the satay. Not the very best in the city, but good.

Our opinions bounced upward with the arrival of my pad thai and Mike's ""Ginger Ginger Ginger."" He's still talking about it. I found the pad thai such a treat that I'll probably finally get something different next time, just to see what else the chef can do. The pad thai tasted very similar to that at Panna Thai and Pin Kaow II - not too oily, medium-sized tofu, nuts on the side - but neither of those establishments have a menu that seems as well-suited to a curious vegetarian as Archi's. 

Other Yelpers had warned readers about the heat, but we didn't heed them. Oops. We always order around a ""7.""

I usually go too regular Archi still stand by as best place comes too Thai food in Vegas. Archi Thai Bistro pretty good comes up short too Archi. I had Thai BBQ chicken lunch special. I love the crispy skin on the chicken with the marinade could eat chicken skin by itself. You get leg, thigh, wing, and part of the breast. Side of the BBQ sauce that really really good! I could see that same sauce on any protein being delicious. The fried rice was da bomb! Fried rice must admit that stands out LOUD. Most of the time order friend rice never any good but this one was perfect. I wish you get more with lunch special but it is lunch special all good cheap good food. 

The service was great nice warm welcome walked in and fairly empty sit wherever I liked.

I could go on and on about Thai food and the other restaurants that we love, but then we wouldn't have anything for our future posts, so I'll keep it short; in terms of geographic convenience, Archi's Thai Bistro is a really great place to feed your Thai addiction!

We have a real bad addiction to Pad See Ew; the Soy coated flat noodles, which has a chewy, satisfying texture along with the crunch of Chinese Broccoli stems and my favorite protein-Pork and Egg it's unbelievably tasty!!

So I love all the Apps here, but it's impossible to order all of them in one sitting, so, we'll add updates to this post when we've come back and ordered more.  This time, we ordered the stuffed wings; boneless Chicken wings that have been stuffed with minced pork, clear noodles and vegetables that are then deep fried!  It's a miniature, pre-TurDuckEn type of App that, with the Plum Sauce, is a great starter. Protein component, check! Fried component, check!

Other great Apps-Chicken or Pork Satay, with the Peanut Sauces, it's pretty addictive.  As well, the Pla Muk Tod (fishcake) is awesome to tempt your palate before the main event!  The Soups are good too, I just can't have too much cuz I sweat way to much on my head eating hot stuff-but Tom Kha Gai is my favorite

There's just nothing like Thai Curry; I'm partial to Massamum or Penang Curry (I find that the sweeter
curries create a balance with the heat) but I won't turn away a Red, Yellow or Green one from the table!  This time we ordered the Country Curry- a homemade Red Curry with a lot of vegetables in a lighter soup.  It's delectable!

YUMMM!

The curry was lacking in coconut milk, and the chicken was overcooked. On the bright side, we got a lot of rice with our order, and there was an abundant amount of chicken and veggies inside the curry. Couldn't exactly finish everything.

We went right before the lunch rush, so we got our table and order in pretty quick right before the place got packed.

To start my wife ordered Thai iced tea (good if you like tea). I ordered Thai iced coffee which was kinda strong and bitter.

For our entrees we had panang shrimp and pad kapow with chicken. The panang was okay but paled in comparison to LOS's panang sauce (though imho, LOS's panang is probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, so that might not be a fair comparison).

2451012,2013-09-21,0,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"I have been hearing people wax poetic about Archi's for a number of years, but had yet to get around to trying their fare.  It is always hard for a place to live up to its reputation when the expectations are so high, but even taking that into account, while the experience and service was acceptable, the food was a huge let down.

My co-worker and I went to the Rainbow location for lunch, and were greeted at the door by a short line of people and a 10-15 minute wait, which I took as a good sign.  Busy restaurants are usually really good restaurants so I never mind a short wait.  We were seated in a corner by the kitchen.  The overall service was perfectly acceptable for the lunch rush, with prompt drink service and consistent refills.  The server took our orders, and another employee came out to verify my co-worker's order just to make sure that it was correct.  I immediately mocked my co-worker for being complicated.  The wait for our lunch was a little long, but again that does not factor in to my rating as it was during the lunch rush.  Upon my order arriving, that's when the experience went downhill.

I ordered their ""Signature Dish"", the Pad Thai with Chicken, with a requested heat level of '10'.  The dish was served with a pinch of salad\greens, and a spring roll.  It was also, unfortunately, served with a healthy heaping of raw sprouts.  Had they been cooked, no problem, but when they're raw, they're often nothing more than a snow white vehicle for e-coli.  I ate around them.  The spring roll was ""OK"" and the sauce was slightly sweet and just a touch spicy.  Then I dug into the heaping mound of noodles.

The best I can say is that they were warm.  

Barely.

With random pockets of ""kinda hot"" and a chewy, overcooked texture.  The chicken seems to have been an endangered species for the dearth of pieces that found their way to my plate, and the overall flavor was just bland.  If the spiciness index of this plate was a '10' a '5' would probably put my taste buds into an irreversible coma and a '1' would perform a lobotomy through the roof of my mouth.  TL\DR, it wasn't spicy at all.  

I really wanted to like Archi's, but if this is their ""Signature Dish"" I really don't know that I have much interest in trying any of their other dishes.  The service was acceptable, the staff was very friendly, the portions were large, and the price was OK for lunch, but the best description I can give to the food is ""Mediocre Freezer Meal"".  I've had vastly superior offerings at Pin Kaow.  Heck, even Mr. Chop Chop on the east side serves palatable, hot Thai food with a side show as their socially awkward offspring try to act as servers.

Now, I came here with a group of 10 on a weekday afternoon for a quick business lunch. I understand that a busy and popular restaurant such as this will have time delays when bussing a table for a group as large as we were. However, I don't appreciate being lied to about the time frame--be honest and up front from the beginning or accommodate us accordingly. 

Please keep in mind: we called 10 minutes ahead. 

When the host straight up tells you, ""Well, those people are eating longer than I thought they would. And when that table gets up you can go there,"" there's a big, fat, ugly red-flag and sirens blaring for the service department. 

If you can take one thing from this review, it's this: call ahead, or be prepared to fight for your table. 

Anyways: on to the food. 

They have a really massive menu with different dish options for every palate. They also have some great lunch options for the diner on a budget (always got to love that). It was tasty, but I've had better. Nothing that keeps me dreaming, but something that definitely keeps me full and satisfied in the moment.

The person from archies refused to speak to me any further when i said I was going to dispute it with my bank. Needless to say I paid for items I did not receive. The Thai tea I did order was also a joke. They sent it in a soup bowl made with only the strong tea and nothing else.

Love how tasty everything is here and the LARGE Portion sizes. Only bad thing here is that Spice level is very inconsistent. 
The spice level goes from 1-10. And sometimes you can order a 1 and it can be spicy as hell, or you can order a 5 and it can be as spicy as your one or you can actually get something as spicy as an 8. When we order take out, I always taste the food in the car before I leave the parking lot and when we eat in the restaurant, I have had to send things back multiple times for changes in spice level. 
We usually order a combination of things but the things listed below are our favorite (see pics):

Tom Ka with Shrimp- 11.99$
Red curry Range from 9.99-12/13.99 (shrimp/beef option): zuchinni, bamboo shoots, red/green bell pepper, and I always get fried tofu (you can get non fried tofu) 
Yellow curry- see pics 
Penang curry- see pics- a little spicier than the red curry
Pad Thai- VERY large order can be shared with 2-3 people
Papaya salad- Bland and sour, not tasty. 
Mango sticky rice-sweet and sticky, Kinda more on the sweet side

We ordered three dishes: Shrimp basil, chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew.

Boyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp and mixed veggies in a basil garlic sauce. Spiciness=6/10. It comes with a bowl of rice. He also ordered chicken pad thai. Spiciness 6/10. He said it tasted better than Pin Kaow. I beg to differ. Archi's pad thai was just too.....sweet and tangy for me. If that makes any sense. I couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't too fond of it until I read a previous review and that Yelper described it perfectly: sweet and tangy.

I ordered my usual go-to Thai dish....beef pad see ew. Spiciness=7/10. I usually order an 8 but since this is a restaurant I haven't been to, don't wanna get too carried away. It was delicious. Good portions of beef, perfect amount of spice, and noodles came out pippin' hot. Now, I'm a pretty small eater. 98% of the time I always have leftovers...no matter what cuisine/restaurant I go to. I don't know why but my pad see ew came in small oval plate while my boyfriend's pad thai came on a big round plate. If I wanted to, I could have killed the pad see ew all in one sitting. I kid you not. I wasn't even hangry that night. Wasn't too pleased that the portions seemed inconsistent.

Walking in the door, the boasting continues with a table, dedicated and decorated for their many Zagat and other food awards. What do you not find? Good service. 

They certainly missed the mark from the moment I stepped in the door. The host attempted to seat me with another party, sighed with extreme displeasure that I wasn't with the initial group. (I'm sorry; did you just do that in front of your shrine of awards and pictures of the business?) After he came back to me, I was seated with no greeting, no notice of specials for the day, and no smile. :(

I ordered the papaya salad to start off with and the red curry lunch special. Sadly, my lunch special came out and was finished by the time my papaya salad came out and I ended up getting the papaya salad to go. 

As for the food, I'm not sure if this same Archie's Bistro was the same Archie's Bistro that received the numerous awards for their food, but their food was really just average. The red curry sauce was a little too runny and didn't have as much flavor as what I've had at other places. The papaya salad was average. 

Overall, I'm left somewhat satisfied but still puzzled at how they could have gotten so many awards when my entire experience was lacking from the less than average service and about average food.

Sometimes Archies wife is in the kitchen , we call her ""mama"". When mama's in the kitchen , you can tell, it's spicier!!! All the food is cooked with love , and the staff have been there cor years , they truly are a family restaurant. I've watched them grow over the years  to 3 awesome locations! Anytime someone is looking for something new and fresh to go eat, my husband and I always recommend  ARCHIES!!!!!!!!!",PVHc-eZiWPxTwN3NK9GiFQ,0,0,5,t2NeWxuxOQ7Tf7A_QAmYoA

Damn, why did I wait so long?!

This place was fantastic! We arrived at 2:45pm today, which is just in the nick of time to take advantage of the Lunch Special Menu(11am-3pm)! We both decided to keep it simple today and each ordered the chicken fried rice plate ($7.95 each). We also opted to grab an appetizer of chicken satays (also $7.95).

The service was just about flawless today! First we were served a cup of egg drop soup, which was pretty tasty! Next out was the chicken satays! Very thick and juicy, they were outstanding! We probably wouldn't have ordered the satays if we'd known the fried rice was going to be the heaping portion it was! I don't care much for vegetable egg rolls, but thats just so much personal taste.

Our drinks never even got close to the halfway mark before they were refilled! The waitress was really on top of it!

The servings are quite large as well. You may also customize your dish spice level (1-10), which is always nice rather than leaving a surprise on your tastebuds.

As for the dishes themselves, the papaya salad was crunchy and well balanced between sweet, sour and salty. The beef in the beef salad was tender and wonderfully seasoned. The tom yum soup had a nice deep seafood flavor.

We were in the area and didn't feel like driving all the way to our favorite Thai places so we tried this place out. We came a lil late, around 8:45 pm ish. Only a few people working as servers. So the service wasn't exceptional but it was good. Friendly. But really on the slow side to be honest. After we got boxes for our food it took a bit over 10 minutes for them to bring the check. Which is long for a table that has asked for boxes already. Stating they're done and ready to go. 

I don't like how they have soda in a can and not in a soft drink machine. So every time you get a refill, they charge you for another can / soda. So there's no refills on any drinks basically besides water. Which is kinda stupid honestly, like a full service restaurant doesn't have refills for soft drinks ??!

We tried the chicken Tom Yum, chicken pad Thai and Mongolian beef. All pretty good but It wasn't like super amazing. It was yummy. Once you've had amazing Thai food before you automatically compare it to every other Thai restaurant you go to. And if it doesn't meet those expectations it's kinda a buzz kill. But the foods still good. It's funny though how almost every Thai restaurant I go to, the pad Thai is different lol

Because the commercial success of Archi's business model, it will soon propel them out of Vegas, and onto the rest of the world, or so I hope.

I adore Archi's because it is a very reliable establishment to be the first ethnic restaurant to take my non-Asian friends.  My fiance loves the place, and for good reason.  They do not have a wide selection of Thai dishes, they have the standard fare of what non-Thais usually eat: curry, basil stir-fries, pad-thai, etc...  But of those standard fare, Archi's serves up good quality ingredients in a pretty presentation in a pleasant atmosphere.  Nothing is too risky, nothing can possibly offend, and thus nothing too hot, too spicy, or too incomprehensibly authentic (just don't order level 10).

Even though the lunch hour is usually crowded, it's my favorite time to come to Archi's.  They have an inexpensive and delicious lunch specials menu.  For $6.95, I can always count on a yummy basil chicken, with a warm bowl of soup and brown rice (a modern American healthy addition to offer to the business lunch crowd).

Archi's has three locations across the Vegas valley now, undoubtedly they're still expanding.  Delicious, clean, and safe are characteristics that make them the perfect franchise.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,2,2,4,twTApPREx9XgUtyx8X9sMQ

I got the yellow curry with shrimp and it was really good. The consistency was just right. And I like how the vegetables, potatoes and onions were nice and big whole pieces not finely diced. It had more of a bite and soaks up the yellow curry sauce better.  This might actually be the best yellow curry I've had, dare I say.

I like to consider myself a curry connoisseur because it's basically the only food I can everyday without getting tired of it. This curry was so good, probably the best I've had in Vegas.

Not necessarily the best service though and that's the part that means so much to me.

I work in an industry where customer service is everything and where we do all we can to rectify situations when they're our fault and I feel nothing was done, just a ""sorry.. we'll make another"" and I was on a time crunch to get to a meeting, the reason why I called so far in advance.

Archi's is a very relaxed, non-threatening sort of environment. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the service is friendly. The first thing that struck me was that the menu was rather extensive compared to most of the Thai places you find outside of Chinatown. Eventually I decided to go for my (compulsory) Satay Chicken Sticks starter, followed by chicken ""Ginger Ginger Ginger"" which sounded right up my alley. Green onions, peppers, baby corn, lots of ginger... mmmm... They had no problems at all making mine without mushrooms which come as a standard. I was excited.

When the food arrived I discovered that Archi's heat scale for their food doesn't obey the same laws as most other places around town. My 7/10 would have been at least a 13/10 at most other places I have eaten and I had to drink after every other bite, but my ginger dish was absolutely delicious. The satay sticks were slightly different than what I usually look for (I usually like the thin strips of chicken and these were more chunky) but still very tasty. My wife was less enthusiastic about her vegetarian fare of fried tofu starter followed by Tofu Pad Thai, preferring Panna Thai's version, but still declaring Archi's to be tasty.

Overall Archi's is a quality Thai option that I hope to revisit soon, possibly dialing the heat down a little from my previous order. Conveniently located not far from the Rainbow flyover of 215, I can see this place being a great Thai takeout option for any who live in, or commute through, the area.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,0,0,4,6R_RRAOlNK0TYLBomrevAA

I live for good thai food and this place has injected new meaning into my life. Ok so maybe that's an exaggeration, but seriously they're good. This was easily the best lunch special I have ever eaten in a Thai restaurant outside of Thailand, and it was reasonably priced too. After eating so many mediocre thai lunch specials during work, I have finally found one that is worthy of the drive.

The interior is clean and well kept. The staff consists of trendy young Thai immigrants who offer excellent service. I decided to try the pepper steak lunch special. The soup came first. It was Tom Khar Kai ( chicken in coconut milk) and it was pretty damn good. Not the best I have ever had but the flavoring was solid and clearly made with an authentic recipe. The salad was pretty much your standard thai salad with the sweet dressing. The eggroll was pretty impressive--MUCH better than the standard greasy hunk of dough you get at your average Chinese restaurant. The beef was excellent-- tenderly prepared and sufficiently seasoned, accompanied by an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of green and red bell peppers and sauteed onions. I devoured my plate and sent my compliments to the chef, who by the way, brought me the meal herself. That's another great thing about this place-- you can see them do much of the preparing in their open kitchen which holds them to a higher standard of food preparation. I tipped generously and bookmarked this place. I will have to come back here with my girlfriend and see if the dinner entrees are all that they are cracked up to be, but if the lunch special was any indication, I'm sure I'll be more than satisfied.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,5,prkgMzxNdVl_393z_BsQFw

Positive reviews and opinions from regulars have all told me that Archi's cooks up some of the best Thai food in town, so how could I not except anything less than the best?

SERVICE
Upon entering, both my friend and I became confused over the seating process. Normally at most restaurants, there's a sign up front indicating whether you should seat yourself or wait for a host to seat you; we didn't see any of that. We waited in the tiny entryway for five minutes. The host up front never approached us like we thought he would. It wasn't until my friend observed a customer walk in and ask the host to take down her name to be seated, that we followed her example. 

RESTAURANT
It's clean and bright. Even though this is a popular lunchtime spot, it wasn't noisy when we visited, and there sure weren't any banging of pots and pans and clangs from dishware being cleaned up. 

FOOD
Originally, I wanted to order the Panang, but there wasn't a lunch special for it. Instead, I ordered the lunch special Red Curry with tofu, and my friend ordered the lunch special Pad Thai. Lunch specials come with a bowl of sour soup, side salad, fried wonton, and an egg roll, all of which are served on one humongous plate along with your entree. Oh, and there's also the option of subbing the white rice for brown, but that'll cost extra. 

+Soup and egg roll: I liked the sourness of the soup, but the egg roll was just a generic restaurant egg roll that had rice noodles inside. 

+Red Curry with Tofu: I went for a spicy level 9 on this one. The beads of sweat that I had to lightly pat off my forehead indicated that I was satisfied with its spiciness. On the other hand, there's nothing special about the curry's flavor. All I can say is that it was missing *something* and that it wasn't rich enough. 

+Pad Thai: My friend said her Pad Thai was ""OK"" and could've been better if it weren't for the ""clumpy"", dry noodles.

OVERALL
I'd like to give Archi's a second chance and try their Panang the next time around, but for now it looks like I'll have to stick with my go-to Thai joints that have never let me down.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,4,1,3,17e_aizggWuzMz3VP3keoA

3459538,2010-09-10,2,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"So I came here today for lunch with a friend at her suggestion and since it's really close to my office and this friend is pregnant, I had no arguments. In fact, I was curious to try Archi's. There are several Archi's around town and I've heard that they have pretty good food. 

Walk in...and this place is packed! I'm talking about a wait during lunch to get a table. Wow! I've never seen this during a weekday lunch at any establishment around where my office is. Must be good....then I look around and see that no one dining in the restaurant was Asian. Warning signals are ringing....but I keep an open mind. 

Their lunch specials did not seem appetizing (there were about 8 specials) and so we ordered off the regular menu. 

Our order (shared):

Papaya Salad - They were kind enough to omit the shrimp and fish sauce. We asked for medium but this thing was SPICY...I was sweating and sniffling the whole time. I wouldn't say it tasted bad but I couldn't really taste much of since my taste-buds were paralyzed for the most part

Pad Kee Mao with Tofu - Ok....this dish had about a gazillion baby corn slices, bamboo shoots and canned mushrooms. Really? Those are the 3 things I hate the most and the dish was about 60% that! Again, we ordered medium but I couldn't eat it as it was way too spicy. I have never seen Pad Kee Mao prepared this way and thankfully I haven't, because I absolutely disliked it

Panang with Tofu - The only passable dish of the lunch. The gravy was passable. There was a very distinct taste of the ""Thai Kitchen"" red curry paste you find at the grocery stores in the Panang. Also, there was very little gravy which made it sort of hard to eat with the rice. 

Our waitress was very friendly, accommodating and didn't mess up our order at all so I really liked that. The restaurant had cute hardwood/laminate flooring and a very ""Asian-style"" atmosphere which made lunch a fun experience. 

The food here was a joke and it's really not catered to anyone who's enjoyed eating good Thai Food. They aren't really cheap either (the bill for all 3 dishes was $29 not including tip).

3611680,2015-05-17,0,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"Well, even though there are a few hundred reviews of Archi's Thai Bistro, I figured that I should add my two cents in as its one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town and is literally walking distance from my workplace.

THE DECOR (4 out of 5)
When you walk in, there is a extremely small waiting area right next to the cashier. This is fine if there isn't a wait, but if you go there for lunch during the week and you don't get there early, you will have to wait. Besides that the decor of the place is simple and nice, and the restaurant has plenty of seating available.

THE SERVICE (3 out of 5)
Most of the time, the service here is pretty good. But when it gets busy, it might take a little longer to get a refill on your drink or as what happened one time (no, not at band camp), I think that they kind of forgot about or order because several other tables who had ordered after us got their food first. Hey, it happens especially if it's really busy....luckily that only happened once to me out of all the times that I've been there.

THE FOOD (4.5 out of 5)
Now we get to the best part, the food. I've order either the Pad Thai lunch special with chicken, the Panang curry, Pad Woon Sen or the Pad See Ew (I've ordered this the most). All have been very good eats! The only drawback to their food is that the Thai spiciness level (you know, from 1 to 10), isn't necessarily accurate.....well, if you like spicy foods that is. Most of the time I'll order it as a 10, but often it seems like a 3 or a 6 instead.

OVERALL (4 out of 5)
If you on the lookout for some really good Thai food, then check out Archi's Thai Bistro. It's definitely on my top three list of Thai restaurants in town (the other two are Lotus of Siam and Le Thai).",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,0,0,4,Dj4fX3VN50FaCBnEiEJ1ew

I was way wrong, arriving almost at 1 I still had a wait and almost an hour later as I left there was still a wait. After the food and the service I understand why. And my wait was only about 10 minutes, parties of more than 4 took longer but they are pretty good at turning tables. The only pause was after I ordered and finished my soup until my entree arrived which was still prompt considering how many customers they had. I had my go to, red curry with chicken, and I liked their take on it. On top of that I liked that the meal came with salad and a bowl of soup. And it was reasonably priced.

* One of my favorite places to get Panang

Ordered the sweet and sour tofu and he got the tofu pad Thai lunch special, along with his Thai beef salad. 

Our lunch soup of cucumber chicken soup came out and I was kinda weirded out at cucumber soup but, after tasting it --- I was like ""this tastes like chicken tinola"" WOW! After that, I was looking for it on the menu thinking I could just eat that and rice. It was perfect for the cold winter weather!  

After eating my soup, I ate his while he worked on his Thai beef salad. Again with this salad, I never got what his big deal was with it so, I tried it again and I guess I liked it.

I order my usual chicken pad Thai with extra chicken (+ $2 tip) takeout order from Archi's almost every/every other Sunday since moving to Vegas. 

Today I called for my usual order to pickup, except it seemed a little off. This time the phone rang 5 times before it was even answered, and I noticed the location wasn't disclosed through the greeting, which I was normally used to hearing. I thought that was a bit weird because normally the location is told to me when I call. But I figured I've been to Archi's numerous times and trusted in their service. I was told my order would be ready for pick up in 15-20 mins.

I leave my apartment shortly after hanging up and arrive at this location within 5 mins to pick up my order. As I await my order, Palm comes to see me and tells me that my order isn't showing up on their computer screen. 

I had made the error of ordering my usual takeout order at the Flamingo location instead. I apologized on behalf of my mistake and tell Palm I would cancel the order at their other location and I'll order my takeout here instead. All the while I keep calling the flamingo location to cancel that order, but kept receiving the busy signal. 

I called the flamingo location 5 times and none of my calls were ever answered. (I have a screenshot of my call log to prove this statement) 

Palm then proceeds to tell me that I'm NOT ALLOWED to order my food at this location because of my mistake and have to drive to the other location instead. I couldn't believe my ears! I told him that I was a frequent paying customer at this restaurant, and was even trying to contact the flamingo location to cancel my order but kept receiving the busy tone. Once again he tells me it's too late, and I cant order here. Frustrated, I immediately ask to speak to the manager.

Lo and behold, the manager ""isn't in"" on Sundays. Instead I speak to Stan. I tell him I'm a frequent customer at this location who made the mistake of ordering at the wrong location. He tells me he can't make an exception and informs me that once again, ""I'm not allowed to order my food there, and I have to drive to the flamingo location to pick up my food."" Meanwhile, he's telling me this while giggling and smiling. Completely unprofessional and rude to do while speaking to an upset customer. He proceeds to tell me (with a smile on his face of course), ""it's our policy."" 

This Archi's ""policy"" is NO WHERE stated on your website, yelp account, or restaurant. I've read through the entire Archi's website, and I haven't found anything even remotely similar to this statement.

Since moving here in February we have been to Lotus of Siam probably a dozen times and it has never even approached disappointment. I live much closer to Archi's Bistro and got the thai bug we decided to check it out. I browsed the menu online and it looked pretty good and quite reasonable. Curries and entrees were advertised as being in the $8-11 range, but when we sat down and saw the menu they had pasted higher prices over the old ones so it was actually $10-15. We ordered a Tom Yum Koon(soup), Panang Curry, Basil Chicken, and a flat noodle and veggie dish I can't remember the name of. The soup was okay, but the broth was watery and the shrimp were overcooked and a bit rubbery. The thai basil had ground chicken which is very strange ingredient choice for a $15 entree, and was also quite a small portion. The panang was okay but waaay to greasy and oily the sauce was broken and kind of cold. The flat noodle was kind of like a chow fun with basil and green bell peppers, this was the best dish we had even though I said no meat and they gave us chicken for an extra $2. The staff was pretty much all high school kids from what I could tell, polite but hardly professional for what they are charging for run of the mill thai food.

There are about 8 choices for lunch specials.  They are served with soup of the day, mini slad, egg roll, wonton crisp and rice.  My faves include the spicy basil beef and the pad thai.  Today the soup was a vinegary chicken broth with a few fleckles of chicken, tomato, and mushroom.  

Other winning dishes include the spicy eggplant, papaya salad, and of course mango with sticky rice when they have it.  

Their pad thai is buttery and flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness.

My first visit to Archi's was with the lovely Jaime W. for lunch. Every other time, I have gotten my meal to go. This place gets jam-packed at noon, if you are planning on having lunch here it would be a smart move to show up closer to 11.  Sometimes the wait just to pick up to go food is 5-10 minutes, with the wait to get a table just as long if not longer.

The lunch specials are $7.95 (unless you want shrimp) and you get the entree, a generous portion of steamed rice, a fried wonton and an eggroll (if you eat in I believe you also get soup). I have had better eggrolls and I throw away the wonton. The delicious ginger beef dish keeps me coming back week after week... It has baby corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and a ton of delicious ginger.

Every other dish at Archi's may suck, and I may never know... but based on how busy they are day after day, I doubt it. If you like Thai, you should give Archi's Bistro a try.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,11,13,4,pO0DrM708RY2CBfcm7p8oA

Lunch specials are all $7.95 ($8.95 with shrimp, +$1 for brown rice). They have ten selections: pad thai, sweet and sour (a stir fry), fried rice, red curry, spicy basil (with ground meat), broccoli ____, pepper steak, pad pak, kung pao, and ginger ginger ginger. Yeah, that's the same word three times. Unfortunately, they didn't have pad see ew, which I kinda wanted to try, so I picked something else.

First item brought out was the soup of the day. Apparently, today's soup is something of a hybrid between chicken noodle soup (without the noodles) and egg drop soup. I enjoyed it a lot and quickly, and then there was about a ten minute wait for the rest of the items as the kitchen worked to get my food together.

My entree of choice today was the red curry, 2 of 10 on the spice level. I'm pretty sure a 3 would've tasted much the same, which is disappointing because I was trying to keep it even milder than I remember having my pad thai last time. I thought the red curry portion was reasonable, and the addition of zucchini to the standard bamboo shoots and bell peppers made it interesting, but it just wasn't as tasty as other places that I've tried. The lunch special also included a salad with some kind of sweet dressing, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. Good, not great or anything.

Water was still refilled early and often and the dining room was still aesthetically pleasing. However, the failure of the red curry to meet my standards means that I'm taking Archi's down from 5 to 4. Heck, it wasn't even that red.

I've been to Pinkow (which is very close) many times and was always very satisfied with everything. However, many people people told me to ""try Archi's, try Archi's"" so I did since it was close to where we worked. It gets insanely busy at lunchtime, so I'd go at around 11:30am for lunch or an off time for dinner. When I walked into Archi's it was a little too nice and lacked the great questionable dump factor that I really enjoy of the great Thai places I've been to in Las Vegas (Pinkow now being an exception with it's newer locations). As always, I searched the menu for ""Spicy Mint Chicken"", but only found ""Spicy Basil Chicken"". This raised an eyebrow for me since every Thai restaurant I've ever been to has had the mint version of this dish. Anyway, I ordered it. They probably could have made the mint version, but I wanted to see their take on it.

I got the lunch special which comes with soup, a wonton and an egg roll. I have to say they really do give you a lot of food for the price. I always ask for a ""10"" in spiciness and they did a pretty good job of obliging. It's never really a 10 though. 

Overall, the food was pretty good, but they put big chunks of cucumber in the chicken which I've never seen before and that was kind of a turn off. I had to segregate the cucumber from the chicken like a little kid since there was a strangely abundant amount of it. 

My co-worker, who doesn't really vary from Americana, got the sweet and sour chicken. It looked and, by his report, tasted like dog food. I guess that what you get when order Chinese food from a Thai place. All in all, Archi's is good. It's just not my preference. It just could have been a little dirtier.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,1,1,3,_7zE2Snq3tFKK_IJjHlaaQ

Apparently you have to do it online which is perfectly fine with me, but what about those who do not have internet? I ordered online and I got a call probably about 5 minutes later. They wanted to tell me that the prices online were incorrect and that it would be an extra 4 bucks total. I said it was fine because I was totally craving Thai. I was a bit peeved though since they had this whole order thing online that their prices were not correct. They should have offered me the price that was shown online regardless. However, I'm sure they have fixed this problem by now...I assume as this was about a month ago. 

We decided to come here for dinner on Saturday after the mall. We ordered the Beef Pineapple Fried Rice and the Chicken Pad Thai. The fried rice was delicious but too spicy for me.

This is Archi's is the second newest (or second oldest, however you want to look at it) location and the one I most frequent due to convenience. You can find this right off of 215/Rainbow. Archi's is great because it is consistently good.

I have never had to make a reservation, but this location can get pretty busy during peak lunch or dinner time. I have had to wait before so perhaps reservations, especially on weekends, is  recommended. 

Food - 4.5/5
Love the Thai tea here. 

Has a lot of authentic Thai selections. If you don't like spicy, you can order a 0 or a 1. I like doing 2 because I can't really take spicy foods but still like that ""bam"" the spicy flavor can offer. 

Tom yum soup can be ordered with less spicy level.. It's naturally a little tangy so I found 3 extremely too spicy (and my mom, who normally orders a 5-6 found it perfect). 

Papaya salad is great for starters. Would recommend adding a little spice to this because this isn't the sweet fruity papaya, its made using shredded green papaya so it doesn't really have a flavor. Tastes very ""green"" (like vegetables, health, etc.)

Eggplant and chicken dish was pretty good. LOVE the way the eggplants taste here. Complements plain white rice extremely well when mixed together. 

Pad thai is always a safe choice (especially for new Thai food eaters). There are peanuts here though so BE AWARE if you have allergies. You can get it with your choice of meat so that's personal preference, but it tastes universally good! And the pad thai made here is delish! This tastes good to me as a 1 :)

Pad see ew is another safe choice for Thai beginners. Can be on a little salty side sometimes but this is one of my favorite dishes as well. 

*****LIFE PRO TIP: Order the mango sticky rice for dessert if you're in mango season. You will thank me. Unfortunately they only make this when mangoes are in season, but that's how you KNOW they are fresh! 

Price - 5/5
I prefer to eat family style here just so we can get a little bit of everything. However, portion sizes are big enough to where you can order one dish entirely for yourself. 

The pad thai, pad see ew, and tom yum soup have been a single dish for me and sometimes I will have some left over. The papaya salad is great for sharing but I suspect not enough for one dish. 

Great portions for the price. Family style can consist of 2-3 dishes (4 if we want to bring some home for tomorrow's lunch...) for the 3 or 4 of us. This includes white rice. The price comes out relatively cheap per person this way, about $7-10 

Service - 4.5/5
Nothing ever spectacular but nothing bad either. Consistently good service and helpful employees. 

All in all, a staple Thai place in Las Vegas. So happy the owner has grown to be able to open up 3 locations across the valley... Well-deserved success!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,4,4,5,AWJ8Aylw_3FPYgsAMJ3LnA

I was surprised with their beer menu, which had some very interesting imported stuff on it. Not your typical Thai restaurant offerings. 

We ordered the fried tofu appetizer - I've had better. The fried part barely made a thin shell. The tofu was very very soft on the inside - not other thai fried tofu I've had which was are cooked more thoroughly. 

I ordered the Thai Green Salad - nice combination of shrimp, chicken, and fried tofu, but the sad romaine lettuce left something to be desired. My partner ordered a curry, which was outstanding. Will opt for something a little more filling next time.

I've had Thai food delivered to my house, which... is kind of the most awesome Thai food of all, right? Well anyway, Archi's lands in the middle for me. I declare it to be good, okay, not amazing. 

My friend and I went during a very busy lunch hour today. When we arrived the doorway was packed and as we walked in we walked into... well, people. I felt a little awkward and I wasn't sure if these people were in line or what. After about a good minute of standing there a girl slid by my friend and I and gave her name to the man at the counter to the right who didn't acknowledge anyone coming into the place. Hrmm. I headed over and gave him my name. He wrote it down. That was it. No salutations. No telling me how long the wait would be. Oooo-kay. Moving on...

We were sat in about 10 minutes (would have been nice to have known the wait time...). Our waitress arrived quickly and we were already ready to order because we were ordering off of the lunch special menu. I ordered the pad thai with chicken at a spiciness level of 7 and I ordered a Thai iced tea. My friend ordered the red curry with tofu at a spiciness level of 9 and we waited.

The restaurant is small and somewhat loud, but not so loud you can't hold a conversation. The tables were clean and the place looks new and polished. 

As for the food. My friend and I both declared it to be pretty good, but nothing amazing. My pad thai was okay - but the noodles were a bit dry and clumped together. The side of soup was actually quite good and had an interesting flavor, coupled with the mushrooms, which I found to be a great addition. The egg roll fell flat with me, it was basically an egg roll - nothing more. My friend had just about the same reaction with her red curry. It was all right. 

We ordered two very basic Thai dishes. These are base lines for what the rest of the menu will be like. Hmmm. I can't say Archi's is good enough for me to return to - especially during the busy lunch hour. The strange way the host was handling people as they came in the door was a BIG turn off for me as well.

Facility:  I was truly surprised by the inside of this restaurant. It had a hotel casual dinning room feel. I'm so used to the typical small Mom and Pop diner feel in most Thai places around town. It was very clean, with comfortable booths and tables. 

Service:  there was nothing too impressive nor was there anything disappointing about the service. It was just good service. 

Food:  this is now officially my second fav Thai place. I enjoyed everything I had. We ordered from the lunch menu, which came with a soup started. It was like an egg drop soup meets chicken soup. It was decent, but after tasting one bite, I didn't want to waste my stomach space on it, so I gave it to a friend. 
Spicy Basil Pork dish - (5/5) It was so good. It had a nice spice at level 4 outta 5 and a good mix of slight tart and basil. 
Pad See Ew (not on lunch menu) - (4.5/5) very good!  Had a good flavor with big chunks of pork, noodles cooked perfect, and slightly bitter greens to balance the dish. 
Pad Thai - I tasted this on someone else's plate and it was good, but too sweet for me. 

Overall:  I enjoyed my food so much, that I would definitely come back. Folks at my table said there are other locations, but the food is the best at this one. I believe them.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,6,6,4,qRGqoQxOFY5KnEj3qI95iw

Well I finally decided to head to Archi's for lunch today. The fact that their Panang was able to live up to my meteoric expectations is enough reason for me to give them a five.

When I questioned it, his response was that they don't do substitutions and he should have clarified over the phone when I placed my order. Her offered to remake the entree without the extra egg.

Silver Noodle Salad - clear noodles with ground chicken, shrimp, mushrooms, red onion, chili, green onion, cilantro, served on a bed of romaine lettuce and topped with peanuts. What makes the dish so tasty is the spicy lime dressing. Their heat levels are from 1-10 and since we absolutely love spicy food, we decided with level 8. The spice level was perfectly balanced and I might just go even spicier!

Pad Prik King - one of my favorite Thai dishes, consisted of stir fried beef (you have a meat option) green beans, bell peppers, red curry paste and kaffir lime leaves.

4686960,2016-03-10,2,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"Finally. I made it to one of the top Thai places in Vegas. It's only taken me 5 years to do it. After reading the reviews of Jaime W. and Jessie B., two people who I totally trust to not steer me wrong I bookmarked Archi's and due to unusual circumstances I found myself craving Thai food and Archi's was close by. So off I went. Would it live up to the hype? I have to say yes....to a degree. 

A tall glass of Thai iced tea started me off but the Chicken Panang Curry was my go to choice for my first visit. I've been a lot of places where the curry was barely palatable, you end up hurrying through it so you can get on to better things. Not this time. This curry had flavor, it actually made me slow down a bit and enjoy it vs. just slamming through it. It wasn't too thick, and it didn't look like something you buy in a box at Smith's in the Organic section. This was just right.

I was also impressed with the service. You can tell you're closer to Summerlin as this is not a hole in the wall place. It's definitely one of the nicer Thai places I've been in with service that was prompt and attentive to my needs without overdoing it. I was impressed with the portion sizes as well, I certainly did not leave hungry. 

Misses: Spices. I was asked how hot I wanted it and I asked for medium heat. While the dish had spices in it, it didn't bring the kick that I was hoping for. Price was another slight miss. Granted it's a bit more upscale than some places and I don't mind paying a bit extra for that. If you're wanting to slam through some cheap hot and spicy Thai food look elsewhere, but if you want to sit back and enjoy a good Thai experience...you can't go wrong here. 

I have to be honest, as much as I liked Archi's, I still think that Komol is superior to them. Granted Komol is not as upscale, their location needs a facelift, but when it comes to their food they are second to none. And in my book they still top Archi's. But not by much. And Archi's on one visit alone blows the overhyped, overrated, it really ain't all that Lotus of Siam out of the water. (I absolutely HATE Lotus and won't apologize for saying so). 

Overall if I'm on the SW side of Vegas and start craving Thai food, Archi's is on my short list of places I'll gladly go back to again and take others with me. But if you're willing to criss-cross the city for your Thai experience, Komol is slightly better. The key word I want to emphasize is slightly. And as I try more of their offerings that slight edge may go away. It's really that close of a comparison. 

4 Stars. I save 5 stars for places that are truly exceptional, or that have seen me walk in their door over 650 times and counting like Komol has. In time...if what I experienced today is any indication I see a star bump in the future.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,1,2,4,d8EX65SZLSit5c-eThCkyw

I always order between the same three dishes for myself and Ruben: Red Curry, Pad Thai, and Fried Rice. Their red curry is just fabulous. I order it with level 5 (out of 10) spiciness and with its fresh vegetables, bamboo shoots, and choice of meat (or more vegetables), it's just so, so good (don't forget the always delicious Jasmine rice)! The Pad Thai (also level 5) is tasty and satisfying. I love the crushed peanuts and fresh bean sprouts. It's really wondeful with chicken. As for the fried rice, we order it with level 6. Of ALL the Asian restaurants I've had fried rice, Archi's is one of the BEST executions. The flavors are amazing and when I ate meat, I used to order their ""combination"" and the meats weren't micro pieces that were over-cooked, but rather plump and fresh, cooked perfectly. Even the vegetarian option was delicious! Plus, you seriously can't beat the prices!

Edit: I can't eat spicy food as much as I used to, so now I order level 2 for a little kick, but nothing insane. My new favorite dishes are the Curry Fried Rice, Basil Fried Rice, Pad Kea Mow, Spicy Eggplant, and Spicy Basil. Everything is really great though! I've also enjoyed the Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Pad See Ew, and Panang. Try something new when you go!!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,2,4,U-0s6o69rB5bb4CzYPB6CQ

They have a spice scale for each dish, so when you order they ask how spicy, and you're meant to respond with a number between 1 and 10. I ordered a 6, and it was perfect - I would not have wanted it any hotter. I tasted my friends' dishes as well - cashew chicken and pad see ew. YUM. Ordered an appetizer of 4 egg rolls, which were tasty, no doubt, but the star of the dish was the side of plum sauce. I could have drank a glass of that tangy sauce.

* Red Curry Dish with Tofu Lunch Special "" Fresh red curry paste in coconut milk with bamboo shoot, zucchini and basil leaves."" ($6.95) - Rich in color and taste, I ate it all up and it was good.  Yum.

* Spicy Basil Dish with Ground Beef Lunch Special "" Sauteed with house special sauce, bell pepper, onion, zucchini and chili sauce."" ($6.95) - The Husband said he forgot they were going to use ground meat, so he wished he got it with ground pork instead.  Nonetheless, he ate it all up, so I don't think there were any problems there.

In terms of lunch deals, they really make it all inclusive with the little extras they throw in.  However, portion size varies as our size of Pad Thai was only okay compared to another Thai place I went to recently that gave a huge lunch portion.  However, you can't beat the nicer ambiance at this branch.  Service was fine, maybe a bit too quick on clearing our unfinished soup bowls and things like that.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,5,4,Y1mqOOMTWm5Vj1bRgvG79g

They give you an option to select your spice preference from 1-10, I love spicy food and I would normally pick an 8 or a 9 but the other 2 that were with me cannot handle too much spice so we settled for a 4 which still surprisingly gave a little kick..

The pad thai and pad see ew was good, not too sweet- some places make it too sweet but it was delicious.. pad see ew is normally my favorite of out of these 2, I enjoyed the pad thai better...

Stuffed Chicken Wing: 5/5- cooked perfect, needs more vegetables to meat ratio. But still AMAZING!

Chicken Satay: 3/5- so the peanut sauce is super oily. Cucumber salad was great. Chicken, was raw 2/4 sticks. Picture shows. It's like they forgot to flip them. 

Pineapple Fried Rice Spice 10+: beef :0/5 It tasted like fish. Straight up fish. Not shrimp. Like bad fish. Touched it twice. The second without meat just to makes sure. I have had the fried rice with soy, and oyster, NEVER FISH SAUCE. It was awful. 

Chicken Pad Thai: 1/10- I couldn't event get through one bite. The sauce was way off, and bitter. The bean sprouts, are awful. Just don't. The one was it didn't taste like fish.

My daughter ordered the chicken noodle soup and she liked it, but my son tasted it and thought it was somewhat bland, but he's older and his taste buds are more developed. It had plenty of noodles and chicken. My son and I shared the chicken and tofu pad thai which was amazing, again, a very large dish. Spice level was supposed to be a 9/10 and the waiter said that pad thai typically doesn't get too spicy, but we figured at a 9, it should. It felt more like a 3-4/10 spice which was disappointing.

The pad thai is pretty solid - they make it pretty perfect in my opinion (well, most of the time - it was a little off a couple times during the lunch special).  If you want noodles and not pad thai, try the pad see ewe, they make it good too!  

One of our fav dishes is the pad ka pow chicken (basil ground chicken).  We also sometimes get the yellow or red chicken curry.  The sauce is not as thick as I'd like it to be, but  it's still super flavorful.  I wish they would give a tad more rice, but the portions are still a great size.

It's not easily seen from the road. My sister is the one who pointed this place out to me. It looks like just a casual dining spot from the outside. There was quite a few awards posted up on the restaurant frontage and just inside. For some reason it felt more upscale & classy. I don't know if it's the nice shutters or the shiny wooden tables. Mind you, not upscale like a fine dining restaurant on the strip. But like it would be a nice place for a date night or a business lunch. I got a very nice and relaxed feel from the general decor.
Prices were fairly reasonable. I did notice they have lunch specials for $7.95($1 brown rice sub). I will have to try lunch another time. We shared chicken Pad Kea Mow, shrimp red curry fried rice, pork spicy basil & won ton wrapped deep fried shrimp. Spiciness for each dish can be customized from 1-10. I went along with whatever my sister suggested, which was a 3. All the dishes tasted good. The spicy basil had good flavor, but not spicy at all. The pad & fried rice also were both good, but there was a nice kick of heat.

That time I ordered BOTH the larb and the wonton soup (don't worry I shared!) and my friend ordered some sort of beef salad, which was good as well- it's just that once I find the one entree that I love, its hard to change my mind LOL

Anyways, the only reason I didn't give it the 5 stars was due to the food's spice level being inconsistent (I ordered a 4 both times but got the second one a lot spicier).

As for the food- delicious! The pad thai was plentiful with a good amount of shrimp and it wasn't greasy like it can be at other Thai joints. The chicken satay was very tender, flavorful and came with a coconut milk-peanut sauce and the requisite pickled cucumber and onions which were good too. Spicy eggplant was tasty and it wasn't overcooked. Even the servings of sticky rice were good and it wasn't overcooked. All in all, it was good food prepared well and quickly. 

Only gripe was that the serving of chicken satay was a tad smaller than  other restaurants and they only gave one box of plain rice to accompany the meal- most places issue one box per dish even if you do order sticky rice (we had 2-3 dishes, technically).

As many recommended, I just ordered their shrimp pad thai to use as a benchmark, eager to compare to many fancy thai places in NYC. And my, the portion was large, noodles were so chewy, and shrimp was juicy. I washed it down with thai iced coffee which was delicious in the warm May weather. 

Another time I went I had the Spicy Eggplant with beef at ""10"" spice level for dinner and oh boy, it was so good! Chicken satay appetizer hit the spot was well.

I think I have visited every location around town, and for the most part, the experiences have been consistent: clean, attractive restaurant, solid service, tasty food. It is the perfect place for a tad adventurous business lunch. I visited the bistro for just that, and I went with the red curry lunch special. I am not sure it is a screaming deal at around $7 (plus some if you want brown rice), but it definitely isn't expensive. 

I slurped up the starting soup, so it was a winner. The curry flavor is not my favorite in town, but I cleaned my plate with little effort. The other extras that come with the lunch special aren't notable. If you really want curry, it is probably worth it to get a bigger portion and pay a tad extra. Plus, they only offer the red curry as a lunch special. Bummer. One other little thing, I didn't ask if soft tofu, i.e. unfried, was an option, but the default is a fried tofu. I prefer soft tofu, and that may be doable if you request it. As for spice, the level here errs on the mild side. I requested a 4 and didn't experience any hot flashes.  

Yes, like I said, Archi's gets the job done. It's a Thai restaurant you can bring home to meet Mom and Dad... and a personal injury attorney that isn't sketchy... and... enough with the metaphors. Go eat some curry!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,15,11,4,6EBWr-JKsmMZL1sr3XmJIg

I really enjoy their inexpensive lunch menu, though everything else is great too. Each day of the week the lunch specials have their own designated soup, I prefer to go on Fridays when it comes with the chicken tom kha soup (chicken, coconut milk, lemongrass, cabbage, & mushroom). I like that I can choose my food's spice level from 1-10. Remember to save room for the coconut ice cream with warm, sweet sticky rice. My only criticism is that there are 3 locations and they are not equal. The Flamingo location is very small and feels run down. The Sahara location is closed on Tuesdays, has EXTREMELY slow service, and serves sodas in cans with a glass of ice so they can charge you for each one. Not cool, the other locations offer free refills. My advice is to go to the Rainbow location. Another helpful tip, if you're going for lunch, either go at 11am when they open or wait until after 1pm. If you go between 11:30-12:30 the line is almost always out the door with at least a 30 minute wait.",xYHa40uGDRd1l0FR9QexyA,0,0,5,tIeZBFkXS98xcUMZgX8Lqw

The restaurant has a front area for sitting and a back area that kind of hidden. When we went during lunch time I saw that the front room was semi-filled. Our hostess was directed by another man working there to seat us and she took us to the back room. There were only Asians in the cramped backroom and we were the only brown people in the restaurant. Didn't think anything of it at the time, but it seems weird bc we had no children. It wasn't until later when I went to the front counter to pay that I saw that everyone in the front of the restaurant was white and there was a combination of groups with and without children. No Asian person in the front and absolutely no brown person either. Weird. 

The lady that took our order was nice but may have been over worked. She didn't come back after giving us our food and we were confused if we would have to go to the front and pay bc she kept checking up on the tables around up and gave them their checks. I would have liked the same courtesy. 

I really enjoyed the food though.  We ordered our dishes extra spicy and they really did deliver. Idk if it's 'authentic' thai, but after trying many thai restaurants I can say that this is one of the best in terms of quality of food.",7jYhW40_OTeWidnBQUhILg,1,0,3,LaL_XqtrdVwnUYL_qI1C9Q

The nice lady on the phone told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes, although she did ask me twice to make sure I was aware I was calling the Rainbow Blvd location. I arrive about 12 minutes later and I see the waiter bringing my order to the counter. Perfect timing. Paid the bill and was on my way. Note: I was there on a Sunday around 12:15pm and only about 2-3 tables were being used. Kinda empty for prime time lunch.

After going to Archi's, I ran another errand and then finally headed home. When I opened the boxes, the yummy goodies were staring at me wondering what took so long. I ordered:

1. Pad See Ew - Stir fried wide rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and Thai soy sauce. Choice of meat included chicken, pork, or beef.

WOW. This dish was really tasteful. The noodles were perfect. Soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness. I chose the pork and it was sliced and tender. I got it with a 5 on the spicy scale and it had a nice kick without being overbearing. I would definitely order this again. For sure.

2. Fried Rice - Stir fried rice with tomatoes, onion, green onion, and egg. Comes with a choice of meats (chicken, pork, or beef)

This dish was also good. I wouldn't say its the best dish ever, but I would probably order this again after trying a few other dishes. The rice had good texture and it wasn't dry or oily. Good portions of meat as well.

I definitely preferred the Pad See Ew over the Fried Rice, but I'm not against ordering the Fried Rice again. I recommend trying this place. Maybe next time I will dine in and check out the atmosphere.

In fact, I probably go to Archi's 2-3 times more often than Lotus of Siam. After all, Archi's Thai Bistro is located in a nicer building in a better part of town and you can usually walk in and get a table right away at dinner time (lunch time on weekdays can get really busy, though). 

Archi's food is also some of the best Thai cuisine you'll ever taste combined with exceptional service and very reasonable prices. My personal favorites are the Thai Beef Salad, Pad Thai, Num Tok and Pad Prik Pow. Some of the menu items can be pretty spicy, but like most Thai restaurants, you can customize the spice level on a scale of 1 to 10. The servers are also extremely quick to refill your drink, usually doing so when your glass becomes half-empty.

I always visit the location on Rainbow and the 215, but Archi's also has a couple other locations (one on Flamingo between Jones and Torrey Pines and the other on Sahara between Grand Canyon and Fort Apache).

When we walked in, we were hit by a wall of freezing cold air.  This place was absolutely bone chilling on a cold October night!  Nonetheless, we decided we still wanted to give Archi's a try, so the host seated us. 

The servers didn't seem to establish who our designated server was, so two of them came to ask for our drink order within seconds of one another. We weren't ready to order our meals so both servers came by twice to ask if we were ready, and when we asked for a few more minutes, they both came back literally a minute later. I can appreciate the attentiveness, but to be approached four times for our order in less than three minutes was pretty excessive and annoying.

When our waitress delivered our drinks, my Thai tea came with the straw wrapper submerged in the drink. Gross!  We ordered the Panang Curry and the Country Curry.  When the food came out, we saw that they mixed up our orders. We asked for steam tofu in the Panang Curry and fried tofu in the Country Curry, but they did the opposite.  Not such a huge deal though.  We didn't like the Country Curry at all, so we didn't finish it.  The Panang Curry, however, was quite delicious.

Unfortunately, we won't be visiting Archi's again.  There are other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that serve the same, if not better, dishes for a lower price.  We weren't fans of the ambiance or the uncomfortably cold temperature inside.  Next!",hBRBoalwEnKB30Frky4xXg,2,1,2,_caXzVXIcmYzWLfF2P3okg

From my most recent visit there, I got the chicken pad Thai, beef pad see ew, and the basil beef (don't worry it wasn't all for me, I shared). What I loved most was the fact that the noodles for the pad Thai and pad see ew weren't dry and it was not too greasy unlike some other places I have tried. Their basil beef is also soooo good. They use ground beef and basil leaves and you can actually taste the basil. This time that I went, the chicken was a tad dry in the pad Thai so that's probably the only con I can think of.

First expressions were amazing. I stepped into the restaurant and the aroma was so delicious. My mouth was watering looking at the dishes from the packed lunch crowd. I ordered the beef pad Thai and the beef red curry to go.

The first thing I tried was the Pad Thai. It was very flavorful and fresh. I loved the flavor. It had a lot of heat for being ""mild"". I would have loved more egg and a slice of citrus. We would definitely order it again.

I ordered the red curry as ""medium"", and that was probably a bit much for me. That said I ate it. The flavor was again really nice. It has a lot of bamboo, maybe too much bamboo to meat and everything else.

The egg roll was only okay, it's not something I would order by itself. The wonton was just a fried wonton. Nothing special.

We wanted 2 glasses of water (one with no ice) and she brought just one glass of water with ice.  That took my rating down a star.   

We split a papaya salad at level 7 out of 10 spice.  It was refreshing and spicy as heck for me.  My wife ordered the green curry with tofu.  She always, always gets green curry.  The tofu was deep fried which complemented the curry very well and frying it makes sense so the tofu stays together in the hot broth.    

I got the country curry with shrimp only because it had the most ingredients listed on the menu.

In retrospect, I've been to a lot of different Thai restaurants throughout my yelp career and this was one of my favorites. According to their accolades displayed on the window outside, it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks they serve amazing food.

We had a very large party for my sister's birthday and ordered family style for the entire party. The food came out very quickly and the portions were perfect. If you're not sure what to order, here are my favorites that are easy to like. My favorite noodle dish is called pad kee mao (spelled differently at some places) and it's a stir fry noodle dish that's really flavorful. The other is a ground meat and basil dish that goes best with rice! If you like things on the saltier side, try a couple dashes of fish sauce.

I was impressed by the papaya salad because I would normally never think of eating papaya, but some places don't make it well and it tastes like what fresh cut grass smells like. Ew. Instead it was spicy and the sauce got rid of the papaya taste. The other dish I normally don't order but liked was their beef panang.

Despite our large group, the service was very quick and attentive. I don't think my water ever went below half and I always had a glass of wine lined up after pounding the previous one. Yes, I know you're not supposed to pound wine. And no, I don't have a drinking problem.

5804566,2010-12-22,0,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"This was to be my first review on Yelp.

To get an idea of my ratings, I will rarely, if ever, give out a 5 star rating, so you can consider a 4 pretty damn good.

I have dined at Archi's a few different times (all for dinner) and finally had a chance to try them out during lunch. This place, despite the Americanized namesake, is one of the best Thai places in Vegas. I would avoid their beef dishes as they tend to overcook the beef. Their papaya salad is light, fresh and tasty. Also, this location is a good 1 or 1.5 star better than their location on Tropicana.",1AHoOE3_GNFkhw5k4gmV7A,1,1,4,vsVtFGIOlsX8U3DNAfthDA

5822689,2014-05-31,0,ixAh9crILnJ9tM8LhWFhkw,"We wanted Thai and this place is by our house. We usually go to Pin Kaow but we wanted to try something new. 

We arrived Archi's almost 9 pm (kitchen closes at 9:30) and right when you open the door you're greeted by their awards-- that definitely set the expectation high! 

Very clean place, it didn't smell funky (thank God), it was dim intimate lighting (good for dates), and it wasn't too loud so you can have a convo. while you eat. 

I read their service is bad but they were welcoming towards us and the rest of the guest who arrived pretty late. They checked up on us if everything was alright and refilled our drinks without asking-- definite plus!

Ordered Thai tea, came in a pretty huge glass. NICE they're not stingy! Unlike Thai places in LA: where it comes in a skinny glass with more ice than Thai tea! And speaking of not being stingy-- rice was free!

We ordered: beef pan ang, spicy pork basil, and chicken pad Thai. Everything was a thumbs up except.... The beef pan ang, that was mehhhh.. The beef was over cooked and tough. I like tender beef, flavorful and easy to chew on. Cooks may have cut corners and used already cooked beef...I'll have to try this place again but around 7pm, maybe the beef will be cooked better. 

Also there was a party of 3 that came in right at 9:30 pm (kitchen is closed). They still welcomed them, so I don't know where the bad service is coming from. 

Overall I recommend this place. Good service, good food, and theyre not stingy (4 boxes of leftovers). Definitely cheaper than Pin Kaow by like 2 bucks.",IaOyMay2X9VmPyEnIBFb2A,0,0,4,WyLoYYfeLz7Fn8h3Dqj1aQ

The Ambiance was great, it was clean and inviting (liked the window shatters).

The  Service was good and timely. We were seated and served right a way'

The pineapple curry with chicken is by far my favorite. They do the spice on a scale of 1-10 and a five can sometimes be hard to handle but it just depends on who is the chef that day. 

The Pad Thai, Thai fried rice, Tom Yum and Pananng Curry are amazing as well. I have never had a bad meal here.
