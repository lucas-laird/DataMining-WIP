The space is tucked into an end spot in a plaza on Polaris, but inside the decor is calming and the service is super sweet.

I came in when they first opened and got a brisket bahni mi that really didn't do anything for me- the portion was right for the price but the brisket itself was gristly and greasy. Veggies were fresh and spreads were flavorful but not enough to save the sando.

Returned recently to find they've made some changes in their exterior, menu, and hours. Opted for the OMG (turkey, bacon, avo spread, spinach, deli mustard, cheese), customized on Dutch crunch with arugula sprouts, and a green Thai tea from their Yelp check-in offer. Such a tasty lunch, with plenty left over for later! Their DC bread is sweet and crunchy without ripping up the roof of my mouth, and it's gigantic (see photos).  There's a lot going on with the ingredients but they harmonize well, and the tea wasn't too sweet.

We're a pretty diverse company and with that, comes a diverse food preference. Some people love Asian food, some people don't eat it. This place is the perfect compromise and everyone was able to find something they wanted - chicken club panini, veggie panini, Vietnamese bologna banh mi, brisket banh mi, tater tots, etc. Even the vegetarian was satisfied.

Let's start with the food. Everything here was freshly made and delicious. Everyone was happy with their paninis and banh mis. The banh mi's pickled daikon, flavorful meats, and fresh baguettes are on point. They're also pretty huge. 

The garlic parm tots are AMAZING. I got take out and the whole car smelled of garlic parm. I don't usually recommend getting fried food to go because they always steam in the packaging and become soggy, but they cleverly cut out the corners of the takeout boxes to let the steam out. The food will get cold faster, but it won't be mushy and gross. 

Drinks - We got the Thai ice tea, hot Hokkaido milk tea, mangonada and viet coffee. Everyone really enjoyed their drinks! My Hokkaido milk tea was very rich and creamy, but it was a little sweet. It got a little cloying at the end. 

The mangonada is a MUST order. I don't like sweets and was worried this would be too sweet, but it's not. It tastes like an icy mango lassi with the savory chili bits. There's even real chunks of fruit! 

I called this order in and picked it up. The woman at the cashier was really friendly and got everyone's order right. The place is a little hard to find. It's in a vacant looking lot and it has all the blinds in front drawn with Bosa Boba signs covering all the windows and doors. I saw the signs, but was a little confused on where the door was.

Looking thru more pictures, I saw sandwiches and thought.. that's weird.. a Vietnamese place that serves American styled sandwiches (although they have banh mi too).

The Pastrami Panini is my favorite hands down! Brisket Banh Mi is really good. Philly Cheesesteak Grilled Cheese is really good too but the bread wasn't the best. We've tried other sandwiches too and they were all delicious! $7-9 for a sandwich sounds a bit expensive but I've always had to save half for next meal so it's worth it! 

The drinks.. we are addicted to the Vietnamese coffee! We've tried the fruity and milk teas, not bad overall. The price is a little high though I'd admit.

3813547,2017-08-17,11,qw9SyduMZ53KB6GlBQqvZQ,"Looks can be decieving, because I wouldn't expect a café like this could create a niche on a Spring Mtn. Rd because of the odd location. So to my surprise, my sister Marlene and I had a pleasant experience. I came across a few posts here and initially I didn't want to check it out. However, my sister (fellow Yelper too) convince me to try it out.  

Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and felt welcome, because the cashier/host ask if it was our first time. She went over the Menu with us and explained the various option and popular items that she recommended to us. We end up ordering a Chicken Pesto Panini, Smoked Brisket Banh Mi, Parmesan Garlic Fries to share. For drinks, we got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee and Mangonada.

The presentation is simple but straightforward, However, everything was really good! Especially the bread, crispy and soft in texture. Paired well with the Chicken Pesto and Smoked Brisket. The special sauce in both sandwiches was flavorful with a balanced amount of spices. It was a Garlic-like taste but it didn't overpower the other ingredients in each sandwiches. The Parmesan Garlic Fries were amazing! Especially when paired with the Garlic dipping sauce that was suggested to  us. Drinks were delicious; the Vietnamese Iced Coffee was just right and the Mangonada had a delicious taste because it had a component of Passion Fruit, which gave it an Asian twist.

Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend it to others. It was like having Vietnamese inspired food with modern infusion mixed with SoCal culture in a comforting way type of experience! 

FYI: The cashier/host that assisted us, is the owner. Her name is Nancy and is originally from Orange County. We had a great conversation with her and learned about her inspiration to open her own restaraunt. Nancy is related to Vanessa, her Sister who is the owner of Pho Bosa.

The Vietnamese ham sandwich was loaded and I mean stuffed.  The bread was plentiful with a light crunch with every bite. The pickled daikon and carrots were delish.  The gio lua, cucumbers, and jalapenos were sliced thicker then other places and the cilantro was very fresh.  

The smoked brisket flavor was on point and my kids really enjoyed it.

The pastrami sandwich was loaded and came with a soft creamy garlic spread that packs a punch and if your counting calories...don't.

Parmesan tots was yummy

BBC fries was filling and paired nicely with the sandwiches.",u2jYb3GGDT2LuQt08xA6TQ,1,1,4,Sf70DCc6GXFnwLN9_V8jrg

The outside is not very inviting, but that completely changes once you enter. My boyfriend and I were greeted by a friendly cashier.

Enjoyed the music videos while waiting for our food. My veggie panini was delicious and was concentrated with flavor. Yum! The OMG sandwich was huge, but my boyfriend thought it wasn't much more than just a large sandwich, and wished he had gotten it in panini form. I'm still drooling over the tots and the special garlic sauce. 
Prices are very fair for the portions. Looking forward to coming back for more paninis, tots, & drinks. Cool place to have a meal/snack and chill with friends.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,2,3,4,RT0MuATakW1gdVwZCkCtwg

4699523,2017-11-12,7,qw9SyduMZ53KB6GlBQqvZQ,"Wow! Wow! Wow! What an unexpected lunch find on a lovely Sunday afternoon! I was initially roaming around Spring Mountain looking for some Vietnamese food when I spotted the green window screen wrap of this store. Located on the first floor in a fairly non descript plaza next to a bar on Spring Mountain and Polaris, you will find the pictures of sandwiches and boba drinks on the window. There is plenty of parking available too. 

When I walked in. I was immediately greeted by a smiling lady who offered me a menu right away. The menu is straightforward, but offers a a little something for everyone. The choices includes classic Vietnamese sandwiches (bahn mi), American comfort grilled cheese sandwiches on Texas toast ( God bless America! ), and paninis. There is also Special-Teas, boba drinks, snow-which is like a slushie, and Vietnamese ice coffee. I ordered the Pork Bologna bahn mi, Smoked Brisket bahn mi, Philly Cheese sandwich, and a Lavender Milk Tea (which for a dollar more you can get the tea in a male or female shaped resealable plastic bottle). I thought the plastic bottles were different than the lightbulb bottles I've seen before in tea shops and it's Vegas appropriate. Plus, I can save my drink in transport too. I explained to the friendly lady that I was worried the Lavender tea would taste like potpourri, but she assured me hers was delicate and was one of her favorites. She even gave me a stamp card and a to go menu for the future.

I sat in the little waiting area where I placed my order, but I noticed there was a seating area off to the side if you wanted to dine in. I walked over to check it out and the place is really chic, well decorated, and very clean. I went back to the take out waiting area where a large family came in and she also greeted them right away and took their order! She was finishing my order and starting on the large family's one. Talk about efficient with customer service skills! My order was ready before I knew it. As I was leaving with the bag of goodies, which smelled hot and amazing, she said goodbye with a smile. 

The Smoked Brisket was flavorful and had a good complex flavor of sweet and smokey. The pickled carrots and daikon added a bright vinegar note too. Be careful if you don't like spicy though because the bahn mi traditionally has jalapeno slices which I forgot were in there. It added heat, but I will ask for no jalapenos next time. The Pork Bologna was just as delicious, but not as rich as the brisket. Good if you want a lighter bahn mi for lunch, but both was filled to the brim with meat and veggies. The Philly Cheese sandwich was on sliced marble rye, which I didn't expect, but was tasty too. Meat was tender and well seasoned. Not salty and there was a good amount of cheesy goodness to round out all the meat. Then the Lavender milk tea...so good! The floral note was subtle and the sweetness level was just enough to enhance the tea itself. Definitely one of my new favorite milk tea now.

So what did I learn today? Don't be judgy of a place on the outside, give new places a try, and keep an open appetite. This place was a delicious food find and the service from the only person working there (from what I can tell) is a prime example that you can have amazing food and service at the same time. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food I've tried says that she takes pride in her work. Will be coming back for sure and highly recommend.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,17,18,5,hhuAlwr-H3zsRs5A2uPi0A

It was a little hidden of of polaris. The outside doesn't seem revealing so if you don't know about it, you may not find it. 

I ordered the smoked brisket sandwich and a lavender boba milk tea. I think the smoked brisket was ok. They put way too much mayo in the sandwich. I got kinda bored eating the sandwich half way in because the bread got soggy and too much mayo that I couldn't really taste the meat. They do give alot of meat in the sandwich but it because not as flavorful as i thought.

Let me start off by saying how great the service was. The cashier was very receptive to us and helped to recommend the best seller foods and milk teas/boba. She was great and made our experience here wonderful. The service and time it took to get our drinks and food were fast. We barely waited any time at all for our drinks and food. 

For the price you are paying and the portion you are getting, you should definitely be paying more! The banh mis are HUGE. You could eat half and save the other half for later (which is what I did, heh). I got the chicken banh mi and my boyfriend the kogi beef (?). We also got the Thai tea with boba and taro tea w boba. I'm usually sensitive to sweet drinks, but our drinks were just right and drool-worthy. 

Finding this place can be confusing bc it looks like there's just a random green wall/window underneath a building. However, that is it! Open the door and there it is. We almost thought this place was closed, and we're glad it wasn't.

I would say the contents of the bahn mi doubled any other place I've been to in town and the price is very reasonable.  The milk tea was just the right amount of sweetness and the Boba was cooked softer than most places I've been so expect soft and chewy.
