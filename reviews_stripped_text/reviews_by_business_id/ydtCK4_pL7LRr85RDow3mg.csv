The garlic shrimp was awesome, I was not, however, impressed by any of the other dishes. We had the pork roast andbit was dry. Okay flavor, but the sauce/gravy was greasy, lumpy and cold. Overall, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. It was a lot of cash that mostly was thrown away because my family didn't like any of it.",WubpjuDIAkwuDvN08SvMdw,1,1,3,qbCZ4GVQYi40HOTWnDgtQA

On my first visit it was completely empty. Be prepared it's a dive, but dives are the best. It's run by the owners who definitely work hard. Their food is fresh and made with love. So far I've tried their Hawaiian bbq chicken which came with lots of rice and lots of chicken to my surprise Also, a combo plate of the chicken and beef. Both very full of flavor and not dry at all. Loco Moco is well priced for the abundance of food you receive. The taste is excellent as far as the main entree is concerned. The Mac salad not my favorite. Other then that I love that they have a protein driven menu with tasty sauces. My kind of place!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,1,4,5GQAK9E83ciixtEx_Gqpbw
