When I called an hour passed my supposed delivery time to see what's going on, I was casually told ""oh yeah, I guess the driver dropped your pizza or something, I gave you $5 off"" BUT YOU COULDNT BE BOTHERED TO FUCKING CALL ME?! I wish I could give zero stars. Do not waste your time with this joke of a restaurant, they give zero shits about their customers.",YxkHHgNetA8RYKzqt9CO9Q,0,1,1,EfVPYGek8xH4UcXqRhE8TQ

I ordered the blackened chicken caesar ($8.99) and tiramisu ($4.99).
The salad was drowned in parmesan cheese and although I had ordered dressing on the side, I revived no dressing. The chicken was super salty (I couldn't finish it), and the overall portion was meh for $9. The tiramisu was straight up completely frozen. Probably a good spot if you're drunk or high and have the late night munchies.",c7tFD9Nzl9_co0bOm3prHg,0,0,2,PNuar10WuuCXFNvmVJnvVg

Both came with fries that were fresh and pretty good. First time eating here and definitely will be back,Mjr1MbDqNPNafh8g-s7WSg,0,0,4,I1O-pAywKUjDfA886PKXrg

The cook that they had working here before is no longer here and you can tell cause the food taste horrible there is no flavor and it's just disgusting!!!  I'm sad I like this place but now that the one guy is not working there whoever they have working in his place needs some lessons, this is the second time I've visited and noticed the cook wasn't there but they need to get him back if they want people to keep dining here!!! Will probably not be back!!!  Just when I found my go to spot 




Stumbled upon this Jewel of a place today, as I was looking for a place to grab some lunch.  I seen a 
sign outside of Molly's Tavern and decided to come in and check it out.  I'm so happy that I did because the place is nice and clean and the staff there is friendly BUT THE FOOD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF!!  I ordered an Opened face burger and all the flavors that were put into the burger were amazing.  I can't wait to come back and bring my co-workers and friends here for lunch as I'm sure they will not be disappointed. The Chef surely does take pride in his work.  I even asked for the Chef to come out front so I could thank him for taking pride in my meal you can tell that he loves what he does!!  Ask for Chef K when you go and you'll see what Goodness im taking about!!!",Sby6oNlLRIDDT0_CByjV9w,0,0,1,f5NllZyqFUyD34RHGqEM9A

3392007,2018-03-06,3,k0ZUrpL789RZb1QuaE8_Uw,"I was cozy in my bed but craving pizza. It was super windy and cold outside so I opted for delivery from this place because they had a reasonable delivery fee. This allows me to still leave a good tip but not break the bank. I ordered veggie pizza and it was ok. Good ratio of toppings vs cheese. Nothing slid off as I tried to eat each slice. I think there could have been more flavor, but in my opinion it's pretty hard to screw up pizza.. I don't think it's possible to have bad pizza... I would probably order again for delivery... Although I think there are better options out there. 
I also ordered a plate of the manicotti. The portions were huge, but again just ok. Sauce lacked flavor as well. It's hard to explain but the food just tastes average. It looks great but when you take a bite I was a bit underwhelmed. The portion sizes are very good. They can definitely fill you up.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,4,6,3,-6ZnqY6TU_Yg9Ui4vYA8Mw

I honestly don't know what I ate. I ate a few bites from each pasta then had to stop. Now majority of the pasta will be dumped in the trash can. Would not recommend. On the bright side, the garlic bread was great.",VroNH_eCdN3yL1XsNdJ4bA,0,0,1,Yq7QSrJrzNlb0lQGM7DN5Q

Worst chicken piccata I've had IN MY LIFE! Was basically inedible it was so bad. Was disappointed in the salad as well...just lettuce, tomatoes, and green peppers.

I ordered the chicken and waffles, the chicken was good but sadly the waffles were not, it looked like they opened a box of frozen eggo waffles from the grocery store, where other places make theirs from scratch. 

My father ordered a breakfast sandwich which he liked and calamari which he rates a 6 out of 10, I'll take his word since I don't like calamari, but they were nice big rings. 

Our server was Brittany and she was great and very helpful.",q_MC5Mzvyf96Ut3f6-1ABA,0,0,3,iFVzZ2HBMNW5RtGzyF0rjQ
