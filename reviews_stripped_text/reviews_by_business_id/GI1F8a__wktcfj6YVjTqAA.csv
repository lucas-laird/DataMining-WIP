The accompanying ginger-scallion dipping sauce and rice put it over the top. It was a cold Saturday in Vegas and this place hit the spot especially with the chicken noodle soup.

Be warned if you plan to bring your young ones as they serve pretty much chicken and chicken.  Not much choices or a vegetarian dish.  This place also closes early so be sure to call if you are thinking of a late night snack.

Overall, we would return and partly due to its location.",HE1C_JR8rF8Oht4W0mGgmw,1,0,4,L1fabd_F7yfRgE31SwrMLg

1380637,2018-03-16,1,GI1F8a__wktcfj6YVjTqAA,"Came here to pick up some lunch after an appointment. Heard about this place soon after opening either by friends/eater/yelp/etc and was interested because it was a restaurant that specialized in Hainan Chicken Rice. 

Up until now, I have tried various places around town such as Big Wong with their highly popular hainan chicken rice for the cheap. Also from Flock n Fowl, who is another specialized Hainan Chicken Rice restaurant, open only during lunch hours, and use american free range chicken. Before Nuro opened, Flock n Fowl was by far ""the best in Las Vegas"", but that may not be saying much since its Vegas.. Lol Both serving Sinaporean/Malaysian styles. One other mentionable is not in LV but in LA named Savoy, which serves a Thai style Hainan Chicken rice. That was the best in that style, not avail in LV.

Like Flock n Fowl, Nuro has weird hours as well, open only from 11am - 6pm, closed Tuesdays. 

Their menu is fairly simple.

Hainan Chicken Rice $9.75 - Poached fresh free-range richen served with stock flavored rice and a side of house soy sauce, ginger scallion sauce, and spice Nuro sauce.

Extra add-on's for RICE include Flavoured Rice +$2.50, Ginger Scallion Sauce +$0.75, House Soy Sauce +$0.50

Both options are served with skin. Noodles w/o bones. Rice w/ bones. +$1 for dark meat option. 

Side Orders - 
""Sliced Bean Curd in Spicy Sauce"" $4.50

------------

I had ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice w/ dark meat option. One of the waiters had let me try their daily fresh brewed HK style iced tea. Since it was just a sample, there was no lemon but he had described it as something i've drank since I was a kid. Cup of tea with a few slices of lemon on the bottom that u poke/crush with a spoon and drink all together. Unfortunately, their tea is already sweetened. It reminded me of Raising Cane's sweet tea, if thats any basis on how sweet it was. 

After returning home, I had ate this almost immediately. I only live about 5 minutes or less away so it was a short period of time. The order is served in a plastic bento style box. You get a decent amount of the flavored rice seasoned with chicken stock and ginger, pickled cucumber, carrots, and radish, and of course the chicken. It being a free-range chicken, and as one who buys it fairly frequently from a local chicken shop, I had known that typically free-range chickens are smaller w/ less meat, but with that trade, you get a much more ""chewy"" and flavorful chicken. 

The chicken itself seemed quite similar to how my family or chinese restaurants do it. ??? (Empress Chicken) or ??? (White Cut Chicken - is there another name for this?) I am used to eating chicken on the bone so this didn't bother me. Wished for more meat but i went into order dark meat knowing I probably wouldn't be getting much compared to the white/breast meat option. One complaint though is their knife does not do well in cutting the bones. I struggled with picking out shards more than eating the chicken. Not good for the in-experienced. For free-range chicken, the meat could be a bit more chewy. It was a bit too soft. Almost thought it was more like frozen chicken vs free range. 

The sauces that came with the chicken was good. The ginger scallion sauce was a bit plain. Lacking some salt. Otherwise good. Their Spicy Nuro sauce was delicious with its chopped garlic and chili w/ a vinegar base. Adds a nice kick to it all. Their house soy sauce was the one i touched once and never went to again. Lol 

The rice was nice and flavorful but wished it was cooked less. It was a bit mushy and breaking apart. Any more liquid and it would have turned into a thick porridge. Ha ! I like my rice to be mildly firm with a mild chew and individually grained. 

Overall, okay place. Lots more to work on. Hope they improve over time. Maybe have a boneless option for the not so experienced American-born xD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,3,I4Dmn4csSvDU53uow40OJA

1539798,2018-02-27,0,GI1F8a__wktcfj6YVjTqAA,"W-O-W! Nuro bistro exceeded my expectations! Being from the SGV area, many people rave about Savoy for their Hainan chicken rice dish, but they have NOTHING on Nuro! 

APPETIZERS
Pig ear: yummy! A light flavor,  not too heavy. Nothing much to say except that I highly recommend it if you're okay with pig ear!

Cloud ear mushroom: FINALLY A CLOUD MUSHROOM  THAT IS BITE-SIZED. Very refreshing dish and cut small enough where it doesn't get all over my face. 

Fried Chicken wings: If not the first two,  GET THIS. The batter was different from other wings that I've had before and it was good!! The lemon/lime sauce that it comes with is really good too

The rice: a huge part that makes or breaks the Hainan chicken dish is the rice. It was so good that I ordered seconds...and really wanted to order thirds if my tummy wasn't about to burst. I still regret not ordering a third to go. 

The noodles: I can't complain.  The broth was near perfect! Not too salty, but not too flavorless. My mom did say she wished it was a tad more salty, but you're just going to have to try!

The chicken: TEN.DER. I opted to pay +$1 for dark meat for both the rice and noodle dishes and it was SO worth it. The flavor complemented the rice perfectly without having either one overpower the flavor of the other

The sauces: YES!!!!!!!! They give 3 sauces with the rice dish: ginger-scallion(?), garlic-something, and a light soy sauce that tastes really similar to the dim sum cheung fun [rolled noodle] sauce. They're all pretty different, but they work well together and separately.

Service itself gets five stars. Very friendly, very accommodating. No complaints!!

TL;DR 
I salivated writing this review and now I'm sitting here 4 hours away from the restaurant wishing they could have opened in LA instead. I'm coming here every time I visit LV and so should you!",lKbujnnvTV3HvLRsBIv4nQ,5,1,5,zlsHRNl6zeYx_H_p6BAD-A

Both were delicious, I was especially impressed with the mushroom salad! I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but the texture and sauce used with the cloud ear mushrooms was perfect. I also had the free range Hainan chicken with dark meat (I recommend ordering it without bones- you can also order breast meat) it came with the most delicious side of rice that had been cooked with chicken broth. I've had Hainan chicken before that depended on the sauces for flavor- this chicken on its own was great and the 3 different sauce options that came with, really complemented and elevated its flavor.

We ordered two dark meat chicken plates and the cloud ear mushroom. Service was very very fast. I love cloud ear mushroom because of the crunchy bite; their spin on this dish was very refreshing. In terms of the chicken plate, we were pleasantly surprised. Each plate comes with three sauces, and my favorite was definitely the sweet/sour sauce. The rice also had a slight hint of chicken stock. My biggest gripe would be that the chicken still had bones in them; having to pick out the bones mid-chew was kind of annoying. The chicken was a bit boring by itself (but that's what the sauces are for). 

All in all, I would come back when I have a hankering for a chicken plate. Often, I've found that Hainan chicken restaurants tend to neglect the sauces/rice, so I'm glad that they're pretty spot on at Nuro!",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,4,3,4,JXa4qAz50RIdk0011BckvA

1881685,2018-03-21,1,GI1F8a__wktcfj6YVjTqAA,"Our new favorite chicken rice spot! 

We order the poached chicken boneless and ask for a side of the bone broth. The organic chicken is so tender you can cut it with a spoon, and just bursting with good ol' chicken flavor. It's hard to find good organic, antibiotic-free chicken in this city and I come here just cause of that. The accompanying rice, also packed with flavor, makes for a very satisfying meal and stands out. They certainly did it right!

Broth is just so clean, not oily at all but full of chicken flavor. Devoid of any ginger flavor which some may like. Wish they add it as an option for a side cause I have to have it on the side, always. The pickled veggies on the side are addicting as well and again, I wish I could order and pay for more as a side lol not too sweet, not too tart.

LOVE the Hong Kong lemon iced tea and they're generous with the refills. 

Have yet to try the wings and other side dishes since just the entree we order gets filling enough.

Service here is great; we always see John who gives outstanding service and it's a pleasure to chat with him.

- 2 plates of the Hainanese chicken rice: by far my favorite dish. My mom makes a pretty bomb Hainan chicken rice dish so I was surprised with how happy my taste buds were when I ate this. You get 3 sauces to dip your chicken in (house soy sauce, ginger scallion, and spicy Nuro). My favorite were the ginger scallion and spicy Nuro sauce. 

- chicken noodle soup: this was eh. The broth was too bland for me. I would skip this next time. 

- Nuro chicken wings: This was okay. There was another review that mentioned it wasn't crispy and I have to agree. I mean...they're fried chicken wings, you would think they would be crispy? It was more on the soggy side. The flavor itself was great but maybe it needed to be fried a little bit longer? 

I also got to try the Hong Kong style lemon iced tea (free thanks to Yelp check-in!) and I enjoyed it. It was refreshing and wasn't overly sweet in my opinion. It also had a nice tang to it from the lemons. 

Shout out to John and Kyle. Both provided great service. John was our main server and he was excellent. He made sure our drinks were never emptied and did a great job of explaining the menu.

So would I be back? Yes! The Hainan chicken rice dish is the main reason why I'll be back. Also because I gotta support my fellow pug lovers.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,1,2,4,9lpW8suV8XqtsnjSDyjMBA

Yes, the size of the chicken is smaller, but it's easy to notice the quality of the tender and flavorful meat (no MSG!) once you bite into it. I was feeling a little under the weather and was thinking about making some chicken rice soup, except I had no chicken. I wanted healthy, pre-cooked chicken, so that I could cook a quick, nourishing meal for myself. I remembered that Nuro Bistro specialized in Hainan chicken, and I decided to order just the whole chicken to go. When I got home, I ate a few pieces and was immediately surprised by the non-oily deliciousness of the skin and meat! No extra seasoning needed! I basically dumped the cut-up chicken into my home-made, soupy porridge, heated them together, and in about 15 minutes, I had the best, wholesome and hearty lunch that also helped me feel much better later in the day! 

I hope Nuro Bistro can stay in business because its location (across the street from the Mint Indian place) in a small, somewhat empty shopping plaza next to a tailor shop doesn't seem to attract a lot of people traffic. The cost of Nuro's chicken is a bit expensive, but not unreasonable for the higher quality of the product. I'm usually a fried chicken eater, but the steamed chicken here is so good that I could easily switch to the lighter, better-for-my-heart-and- arteries side! :D",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,1,0,5,3fcToCj2UzQ4jzeAQNWDqA

Vegas is lucky to now have a pair of stellar Hainan Chicken purist options along with Flock & Fowl.   I'd go to F&F weekly if I could -  if I had to rate it I would rank Nuro slightly behind.   But that's not a bad thing.   This is like a 9.2 Vs. a 9.8-9.9.   Venus to Serena.

In true Asian form, there is a $1 upcharge for dark meat which has less meat.   We got both but it would be nice to be able to get a combo of white and dark.    The trio of sauces consisted of a sweet dark soy, your traditional ginger scallion, and a SPicy Nuro which was more vinegar base.

Service was great, food was probably 15% cheaper than F&F.   I will be a Nuru regular since it's much closer to where I live.   Next time will order the Chicken Soup and wings but based on how the Hainan Chicken is I wouldn't expect anything less than pure delish.

Came in here the other day with my GF's dad to try the place out and ordered the Pig Ears, Hainan Chicken, Chicken Noodle Soup, and the Chicken Waaaaaaangs. 

Chicken wings were lightly battered and served with a light sweet/sour sauce. It had nice flavor and crispy exterior and juicy interior . 

Pig ears were surprisingly delicious. I ordered them just cause, and wasn't expecting much. But ihm yea, I was pleasantly surprise at the flavor of dish. These looked like they were hand cut and were sliced a bit thicker than what I am used too.
However, the thickness they cut it too gave it a nice chew that complimented the marinade that was used.

The Hainan chicken came with 3 sauces and bowl of rice. The chicken was tender, like really tender. When I got it I thought it was odd that the skin on the chicken was a lot more yellow than chickens I normally eat. I come to find out that they use all-natural chickys that they pick up daily. I thought that was a big plus. The Hainan rice was solid and executed perfectly . And you know in Hainan Chicken, it's all about that rice  .

The chicken noodle soup/pho was.... deliciously delightful. Seriously. The broth was light, yet flavorful. The noodles were cooked perfectly. And the chicken was tender. I picked up the bowl and drank that bish with my GF's dad there... and this is the first time me and him hung out with just the two of us. Honestly.. this may be the best chicken noodle soup I have tried. Just my personal opinion..

I definitely recommend giving this place a try. I think it's a good joint for a nice little lunch/ early dinner. The entrees are filling but not heavy. There are a few items I would like to try next time I go. I really want to try the different drinks they have like the soy milk and the lemon tea. I was on a calorie restriction the time I went, so I didn't get to try them.

Mmm.. what else... mmm .. the decor was nice. The restaurant looks brand new. The artwork was dope too. I was told the owner painted it?? I need to talk to them and commission them to do one for me too . The restrooms were good too. It was hella clean and smelled nice . 

Service was cool, they were really nice and would check up on us every so often. The place is fairly new, so I just think everyone is just getting the hang of things.

I love my Hainan chicken, and I was so happy when I discovered this place through yelp. 

Gonna get right to it. Got the Hainan chicken with dark meat, and it was excellent, very juicy and tender. I got it with the bone (I feel like it retains more flavor than the boneless). It comes with three sauces (ginger scallion, house soy, and spicy Nuro), and the ginger scallion was definitely my favorite one. They pick up their chicken daily and only use free-range chicken so their chicken is super fresh and of high quality! In addition, they don't use MSG here. 

Also tried a few of their appetizers including the cucumbers, spicy bean curd, and the chicken wings. The cucumbers were really refreshing and is a perfect appetizer for the summer. The spicy bean curd had a nice kick to it, and the wings weren't as crispy as I would have liked but were still tasty. The fish sauce that came with the wings complemented them very well.

Their chicken is obtained fresh daily and is free rang and they also not cook with MSG.

We had the Hainan chicken rice with dark meat $11.75. The chicken is flavorful poached in simmering stock, then seasoned with spices, ginger and garlic, and used to cook the rice, giving it a rich, flavorful and chicken-imbued taste.

Nuro bistro is the third Hainan chicken restaurant I've tried in the area. Flock & Fowl remains my gold standard, while Big Wong's is my go-to hole-in-the-wall for cheap eats. We visited Nuro this past weekend, which had only been open for about two weeks. I like the simplicity of their menu, offering a chicken-based theme around the traditional chicken and rice as well as chicken noodle soup. 

We started our meal with the Nuro chicken wings, which looked very crispy. However, we were all quite disappointed after taking bites into the chicken wings only to discover that they weren't crispy at all. I liked the spicy lime sauce on the side, but chicken wings are meant to be crispy and these were very under-fried. 

Moving on to our entrees, I was quite impressed by the clean presentation of the chicken and rice, reminiscent of the plating from Flock & Fowl. We tried the breast meat, served with skin and bones for $9.75. It was served with three sauce options of soy, spicy chili, and a ginger scallion sauce. While the poached chicken was good, it was no where as tender as Flock & Fowl's and closer to that of Big Wong's (with a higher price point). The stock seasoned rice was average. As for the chicken noodle soup, I could appreciate the rice noodles and the broth, which was quite flavorful. But again, I found my poached chicken to be a little on the rubbery side. On top of that, the portion was small for $8.95 - I would've had much larger options had I gone to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered ph gà. 

I did find the service to be excellent as we were frequently checked on; however, my last gripe was the Yelp check-in offer. My girlfriend and I got the lemon iced sweet tea and Vietnamese drip coffee respectively with the check-in (supposedly for free, but later mistakingly charged). I didn't realize until after I left and paid the bill that we were charged for those drinks, which I guess was also my fault for not looking at it more closely at the time of payment.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,11,7,3,UiIUZX4sSwZSiB4qclOwXQ

Ice tea was good but next time I want to come try their soy milk as well because I love me some soy milk. I got the normal chicken with rice. It came with 3 different sauces and I really liked the yellow orange sauce with red peppers in it. I put some of that sauce on the rice and used that as my main dipping sauce. The rice was flavored good and the chicken was so tender and melts in your mouth. I loved it and it's still good when you microwave leftovers. I really like the pickled vegetables they give you but it was only a little amount. I wish there was more. The inside of the restaurant was clean and cozy. Seem like a good spot to eat at. I definitely will come back here and I love their chicken and rice. This place is way better than flock and fowl in my opinion.,lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,2,1,5,PI5cDiS6842gsKcz0G_nlg

Got to check out this spot today and geez - have I been missing out? Like I've heard big hype on their pho ga and chicken wings and this girl was not disappointed. 

First of all - the clean, contemporary atmosphere was amazing! And I actually loved the simplicity of the menu. It meets the atmosphere and concept of simplify that I took from my visit here today. 

Ok so the chicken wings remind me of what my Dad used to make me as a kid. Lighter, crispy, less battered. And the sauce for the chicken was soooo good. We also got a pho ga which is AMAZING. Like I think it could cure sickness with its deliciousness AND ITS MADE FRESH EVERY DAY (rare thing to happen in LV)! We also had their spicy bean curd - holy moly, it is a great mix and an extremely nice dish to start with. And my boyfriend loved their homemade soy milk!! I love the portion size and I think this is a great stop for lunch or a dinner! And I noticed they've extended their hours to 8pm, which is awesome!

The food was so good we had to bring my parents back some pho, hainam chicken, and some wings! They absolutely love it. Especially since I swear, that soup could cure sicknesses. But also, did I mention that their chicken is obtained fresh DAILY, FREE RANGE, and they do not cook with MSG!! I'm a huge fan of that detail alone!! 

I will definitely be back here and am so glad to find a place close to my home like this. Our bill was extremely reasonably priced (especially for the amount of fresh and high quality produce and products that they use)! 

Definitely think this place is a must try for everyone, especially if you love chicken! Also, super cute bentos for take out if you need meals for the week ;)! 

Last thing to point out is the service there is great. The owners came and talked to us, and it was so sweet to have them come check on us often to see what we thought of their food! Thank you so much for the great hospitality! Well be back soon!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,5,5,5,CBI1E42IeaWuy8Lete_o6w

They only have one entrance, which can be confusing if you park in the back but just walk around the building.

Let me start by saying that all of the employees were SO friendly! From our waiter to the chef himself, everyone went out of their way to make sure that our questions were answered, our food was to our liking, and our leftovers boxed up when we were ready to leave.

But most importantly, THE FOOD is AMAZING. I've been looking for authentic Hainan chicken (or as we called it in Thailand, khao mun gai) in Las Vegas forever, and this places nails it. From their perfectly oiled rice, to the fresh chicken, all the way to their perfect sweet/spicy Nuro sauce, my dish was perfect from the first to the last bite. My husband got the chicken noodle soup which got a thumbs up from both of us as well.

I preferred the flavored rice over the noodle soup as the flavor of the soup is light and delicate.  The soup is the same base used to flavor the rice too.

The meal portion is on the smaller side and it's the main reason for one less star as all four in our party were hungry in 2 hours.  I think next time we would order 3 meals plus a whole chicken so there is enough to be filled.

I have never had such flavorful ""white"" rice, because it isn't just a scoop of plain steamed rice... this rice has such depth with flavors of chicken, ginger, and garlic actually cooked into it! If you eat just a spoonful of rice by itself, you'll know exactly the savoryness I speak of! The chicken is just as delicious and beyond tender. My one and only qualm with this meal is that the skin is a bit off putting since it isn't crispy. I personally just take it off as it's more soggy and rubbery than I would like. Now, there's 3 dipping sauces that come with the meal as well as a little pickled accoutrement. I have no idea what the three dipping sauces are called, but one is like a sweet soy, another sort of a spicy, tangy vinegar, and the last is the BEST savory, lemongrass, ginger, scalliony oil. I LOVE the last one, but the other two get some dipping action as well! Seriously though, the chicken dunked in the ginger scallion oil with a forkful of rice is therapeutic. The first time I went here I also ordered the iced coffee and cucumber appetizer. Both were yummy, but I have come back every time for the chicken plate. It is such a tasty, unforgettable, and comforting meal. Seriously, I took my coworkers here the same week I tried it solo because I was yearning to have that chicken and rice and dip again!!",l5RDapWZnZAhztJdFU9WIQ,0,0,5,h8z2oDXBW1qlVGz26hQdVg

Omg there's another chicken rice place in town! And in the west side! Yay! I seriously hope chicken becomes like poke, with stores everywhere.  They do a pretty good job with the flavored rice.  We ordered a whole chicken to share and the portion size was very generous. Price is also very fair.

The Bad
The chicken could be more tender.  The ""whole chicken"" order only comes with one type of sauce.  However, when you order the chicken and rice combo, that comes with all three sauces.  They allowed us to get all 3 sauces for a nominal fee, but that just felt kind of petty.  Parking was also awkward.  I guess we parked at the back of the store and had to walk through a very graffitied alleyway.  Staff was fairly inattentive and also delivered wrong food to our table. 

The Ugly
They didn't shave the chickens! Our chicken skin was covered with long long 1.5 inches+ chunks of hair. Eww.  I mean that is some serious faux pas in the Chinese food world.  It's fairly disgusting and I really hope they fix it ASAP.  This is like the one thing that I would have a hard time overlooking.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,3,1,3,xwl6d9IPwF6i17ylXqvX5Q

Sad to say I was not impressed. As soon as walked in, I was never greeted by the hostess standing next to the door behind the register just staring at me. The waiter serving other and walking around just casually walked passed me without a word. After a awkward 2 mins I just asked if I can sit anywhere. Mind you, it was not crowded and kinda slow 

Order the hainan chicken with some pig ears. Good flavor on the chicken, not enough meat. I felt like I was just trying to bite through the bone and get to the little meat they had on it. 

Pig ear was solid tho. For the price of $5-6ish I guess it's decent. Haninan (chicken and rice) was about $9 plus $1 for dark meat option. Comes with 3 different dipping sauce. 

They have other option on the menu but sad to say I probably won't be coming back..

The location is easily accessible and thanks to their large white sign on an orange building you can see it from a distance. The front doors are lovely. The menu is very simple. There are about 6 appetisers and 2 entrees to choose from. I had the Hainan Chicken Rice with dark meat. The chicken comes poached(which the menu says) with stock cooked white rice(WHICH IS SO FREAKING DELICIOUS I COULD HAVE HAD ONLY RICE AND BEEN SO THRILLED) as well as 3 sauces. My favourite sauce was the scallion and garlic, which I mixed in with my rice. There is a disclaimer about the chicken as it's bone in and then cut. Now, I understand why they do it bone in, but you do have to work for it a little to ensure you don't swallow any bones. I peeled my chicken off the bone and tossed it into my rice to have a nice little bowl for lunch. Their soy sauce is on the sweeter side which I enjoyed very much. 
I also had the fresh cucumber app. It was tossed in a garlic ginger dressing which was very good. 

I did see a review where someone had uncut chicken, perhaps they do this on request for those snobbies who wouldn't want to pick at bones.",uN8xmJ9EdeFpfZUACC1V_A,1,0,5,BKWFfMgKq6b0qJMuTTWsuQ
5349127,2018-02-20,2,GI1F8a__wktcfj6YVjTqAA,"Came here one day for lunch with my husband and friend. When I saw this new restaurant, I had to try it because it specialized in Hainan chicken. We all love the dish and sometimes, I would even make it at home. We typically usually go to Flock n Fowl for Hainan chicken but they're a little far sometimes. The hours for Nuro are a little weird though because of their hours. They close pretty early so it's hard to come here during the weekdays when I have work. 

They have HONG KONG STYLED LEMON ICED TEA!! Vegas lacks Hong Kong styled cafes and it's really nice to know that Nuro incorporates a little of it in their menu. Also, if you check in on yelp, they have an offer for a free drink! 

We all got an order of their Hainan chicken because that's their specialty. I wanted to try their chicken wings too but we can't eat that much food. And their chicken noodle soup looked really good as well cause it was a little chilly that day. In fact, their establishment was a little chilly as well. I had to keep my coat on while my friend had to grab his coat from his car. 

They have white meat and for a dollar more, you can order the dish with just dark meat. I'm not quite sure how that works because when we got our dish, it looked like a combination versus JUST white meat. Maybe their dark meat option just gave you legs and thighs? Haha. 

Their chicken is not de-boned, unlike many other Hainan chicken restaurants that I have tried. Granted, all the other Hainan chicken places were either Thai style or Singaporean styled. Nuro's chicken actually reminded me a lot of a Cantonese styled chicken ??? ""Empress chicken."" So I just assumed they were Canton styled and judging from the owner's comments, I was right. 

Each Hainan chicken dish came with three sauces: the traditional ginger and scallion sauce, a soy based sauce, and a vinaigrette? I only used the ginger and scallion sauce as that is my favorite sauce to eat chicken with. Nuro's version of the sauce is delicious -- it has just enough salt in the sauce. Their chicken, however, could be considered on the dry side. A lot of other Hainan places that I have had, the chicken was always juicy and tender but Nuro's was not. It's not necessarily bad as my family is from Hong Kong so their style is very comforting. Their chicken rice is pretty good as well -- although I just wish the rice wasn't as mushy. I prefer rice that's more towards the firmer side. 

Their HK styled lemon ice tea was a little on the disappointing side. HK styled lemon ice tea needs to be SWEET. Nuro's version, however, lacked the sweetness to their tea. If they could just make it sweeter and had more lemon slices, it'll be perfect. 

Overall, Nuro is good. People won't be used to it though. My husband did not appreciate the bones in his chicken. I enjoyed my meal but would have preferred the chicken to be more tender.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,1,3,t6NRFNLZSBtDShFiAAV9SQ

Another plus is that their hong kong style iced itea comes with free refills!!",4mTTkGpsg5OmqWjuKQ1OpA,0,0,5,16OMcvXMfwAP2jM8j6AF0A

Now, the chicken.  After you had the chicken, you'll know how chicken should taste.  I am so sick of frozen ckicken and chicken that taste like card board in US.  
They have a lot of cute designs of cups for tea.  I had their favourite Pug cup and it is so cute I want to buy it from them.
Service is great and friendly .
I love the decor in store.  Nuro will be my place for Hainan chicken in Vegas from now on.  Thank you chef!",b1qKCVkKman3AD1IVm2wfA,1,0,5,QV90D70EftiBGgYRbnje6w

Tung ky (chinese bbq) a small cash only place, flock and fowl, and here.  This was my first time trying Nuro and it has became my favorite spot for hainan chicken.  

Rice: the rice was on point,  Nuro's wasnt as greasy, it was lighter, and it comes with more than other places. It was so good next time i'm getting an extra bowl. 

Chicken: the chicken was perfect.  I got the white meat but it wasnt dry, it was soft and flavorful, and the temperature was just right. 

Sauces:  I like the ginger sauce the best, followed by the tangy sauce not sure what it was, and the say sauce the least. This is all just my preference tho. None of the sauces were bad at all.

This has nothing to do with the food but getting served in a metal tray was probably for convenience to easily carry the sauces, the rice, and the chicken in one tray but being that it was metal was a little out of place as the environment is a nice cozy comforting and newer decor and clean environment.  Then here comes a metal prison tray lol. Its all good though, im there for the flavor of the food.

Cant wait to go back to try the soup!",aBKfBuDXSMAUdQWFfEgn7g,1,0,5,hC_taMSvSkKBcmLoIvy_tg
