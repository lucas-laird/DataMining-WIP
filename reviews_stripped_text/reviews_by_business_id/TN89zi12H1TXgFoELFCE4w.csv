146702,2016-01-07,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,Hands down one of my favorite places in Vegas. Marvin is one of the best bartenders; I travel to vegas with different people every time and he never fails when it comes to hosting me and my friends and tending to our ever need weather it's a friend who doesn't know what she wants to drink or a nice bottle of champagne and cigar. The place has lost it burlesque show but the drinks are on point and the atmosphere of this venue are on par to none.  Drink pricing I believe is more then far considering these are specialty cocktails that have above average liqour outta the bottle and not out of a gun.  Vegas! I vacation there expecting to spend money.. 5 stars for a place that I always visit everytime im in Vegas,yqw4LiMLFN39PrglPbuFUA,0,0,5,KfQ2n5uVlxEP6JecW90fKQ

However, the house music was terrible! This time it was date night with friends and after a $90 round of drinks at the foot of the stage, we watched one show, (really enjoyed it ) and the house music came on. My wife asked if the crap was some remix from the 90s? It wasn't even current music. The ladies wanted to her good music so we left.

Couldn't even have a discussion, and certainly wasn't what I expected. So, if you like that, you'll like 1923.

528544,2014-06-19,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"Every bus, taxi and large vehicle you pass in Vegas advertises a show and the caption always reads ""Voted #1 show"" - well - to experience a ton of notches up from any of the usual acrobatic, circusy, musicals, stripteasy kinda shows - please go see Holly Maddison's Burlesque show at the 1923 Bourbon and Burlesque!!

What a sexy, sultry but classy show - and all set in a unique 1920's speakeasy style 2014 club atmosphere.  Booked a couple of weeks ahead with Avi the manager himself - who was so personable and approachable considering he runs this very exclusive style club at the Mandalay Bay, he had remembered us by name and given us the best seats in the house - right on the bar where the girls come out and simply knock you out with their acts

The evening starts after 10.30pm and progresses in few sets - even if Holly Maddison herself doesn't make an appearance - the whole show is produced by her and is amazing! 

You arrive at a very deceptive looking tiny bar set up with a car parked and barricaded outside - wondering if you're in the right place - give your names at the door and are escorted through this hidden door (got goosebumps) to a dimly lit speakeasy style club - great mix of people there to enjoy a great show and have a good time

The show itself includes an amazing set up with a revolving stage featuring a piano, HOT cast that gets larger in numbers as the night progresses and the routines leave you spellbound!!  Nothing sleazy - just very very chic and high class.  During set breaks you experience amazing music and patrons can't help but get up and dance - making it into a nightclub scene almost but without the head pounding and crowd crunching feel - TOTALLY loved it! Just the right mix of audience participation and sexiness - this show is on its way up and rightly so!

The drinks selection is amazing, the cigars you can smoke outside great and the staff is unbelievably friendly - Avi himself mingles and circulates during breaks making sure everyone is having a good time - which believe you me they are!

A must do whilst in Vegas!",qfFPjzFwkKQLLlml0US-6g,0,1,5,R6FLwVeub5yaqpBzZlVrQQ

After coming by earlier in the day to talk to the door guy, we were told that the show starts at 9:30. So we came back at 9 and paid almost $60 for three of the worst mixed drinks I have had in Vegas. We found a table up front,  but it rocked so bad a drink fell over on the table. Staff didn't care. I sat with a wet table cloth in a ball on the table. It sucked!  In the first hour and a half the waitress came by once. I had to go to the bar and order most of my drinks. We were told that the dancing started at 9:30, but the first dancer came out after 10 for a 1 minute show. Then, after waiting another hour (1 more damn hour!) The same dancer came out for a 2 minute show. The two girls I came with to the club were loosing interest. They were bored, and I was getting ripped off. We gave it another 30 minutes, but no more dancers came out. We left feeling tired, sober, ripped off, lied to, cold (because the ac is on freezer setting), and generally felt like this place was a scam. Honestly, this place ruined our night.

We left and hot our tab, the drinks were vegas strip priced. 15-19 each. But your also receiving free entertainment. I really don't understand how people complained about the prices... It's typical. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I didn't like the fact that they add gratuity.

750357,2016-07-03,1,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"My party and I all had negative views with 1923 Bourbon Bar. It was disappointing to say the least. What was in our minds a speakeasy which promotes bourbon, burlesque, and cigars turned out to be an unfortunate array of 90s rap, and a selection of spirits that any other decent bar could outclass. All of the factors which lead us to checking 1923 out were there: the secluded entrance, the car out in front, and some of the decor alluding to jazz music and old-time gangsters of the era. However, the perfect metaphor for this place would be the broken and splintered stand-up bass that was used as a decoration in a corner on the inside near the exit. 

Understanding that the burlesque shows were to start around 10, we arrived just a bit early to ensure a spot. Ultimately it made no difference for heeding to punctuality because the place was dead, as approximately 8-10 other people in total were there at any point during our time there. Also, fun fact: there were no shows or even any mention of there ever having shows, and this was on a Saturday night. The only entertainment there was the movie ""Casino"" playing silently on a projector screen on closed captions. Or maybe they did have the sound to the movie, I just couldn't hear it over the cool jazz tunes from such artists like Ja Rule, Biggie, and DMX. 

People came in to check it out as we did, and left almost as promptly. We stayed for one drink a piece, priced at $14 for a single pour of bourbon, which isn't a crazy price for a pour of a decent spirit on the Vegas Strip. The selection however I felt was lacking for a place which promotes said bourbon. Pappy is on the menu? Cool, but it's out of stock. That's fine, and no fault there as the hype around any of the Pappy bottles ensures that the demand is always at a high. What you will end up with is a list of spirits that are good, but nearly all from major distilleries like Makers, Woodford Reserve, Bulleit, and the like. The service was prompt and courteous, so that's really the only star you see from the rating. Although if you think about it, in an empty bar you should be served quickly. 

Cigar selection has about 10 different choices with options ranging from an AF Hemingway Short Story for $16 to an Opus X running you about $70. However, at that point we were turned off on the surroundings and didn't feel like wasting any more time having a cigar there. 

This place could be so much more if they stuck with their concept and fully ran with it. However it's a thinly veiled derivative bar that spins 90s rap at a volume which speaking to someone even an empty place proved difficult. Oh and it has a picture of Al Capone on the wall.",Uy3ferAq3DOgz-DpHeddmw,5,2,1,iW13ujEg7MRHJr_FnG2X7Q

The bartender asked my sister and I our plans for the night and we told him after dinner we were going to the Michael Jackson One show at Mandalay Bay and then we wanted to go somewhere with a more laid back feel, not so much a club since we did that the pervious nights. He told us to go to this feel good,unique ""lounge"" that had recently opened and it was somewhere actual locals frequented. He described the atmosphere to us and we were immediately intrigued. Once arriving there was a small bar out front with an old timey car but no official door to get in, we were confused at first until the doorman asked how we found it and pushed aside a bookcase to a secret door into the club. We told him the bartender at Whiskey Down told us about it and we got in for free, which was a plus. The inside was exactly how you would imagine in the era of The roaring 20s with the dark lounge, saxophones, piano and stage. Very Great Gatsby like. One of the performers came on about 10 minutes after we arrived and even though there is nudity it was very classily done.

799172,2014-08-09,1,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"There's something you should keep in mind about this rating. My wife and I aren't really clubbers. We don't ""get"" the club scene. But our expectations fell short in a few ways. 

Her Old Fashioned and my Manhattan weren't anywhere near as good as those from Burger Bar, 100 yards away.
There was nothing ""underground house"" about the music. It was a typical classic rock/pop/hiphop mashup set, and nowhere near the mindblowing stuff from Lisa Mamalias at Cosmo's STK the other night. Speaking of STK, the ladies behind the bar there were much more engaged (and engaging) than our all-business and inattentive bartender--this was disappointing given the $50-per-head minimum in our front section. 

Real-time update: I'm adding a star for the way one of the performers flirted with my wife, and for the overall talent of the lovely women who put themselves on the line for this Vegas crowd. I think the difference between two stars and three is that I can say we had a nice time despite the shortcomings.

876709,2014-05-04,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"Discreet, Intimate, and Las Vegas
Is this a lounge, nightclub, or the refractory period after a successful night in Las Vegas?

Speakeasy - It is not as easy as it sounds.  If you are unfamiliar with the prohibition era you need to know Las Vegas embodies speakeasies and Holly Madison has brought it back with a modern twist.  Like all speakeasies discretion is key.  Inconspicuously tucked in the corner the typical tourist may literally walk past this place because it is seemingly a small bar yet it is camouflaging the experiences within.  This was a soft opening.  With next to no advertisement the onus is on you.  My wife knew where to go.  

You'll see a car, but not the usual car surrounded by slot machines begging to be won. Next to it a well dressed, well groomed man to screen wanderers for the 21+ limit.  I casually struck up conversation and inserted the name of the bar like a secret pass-phrase.  The bouncer knew what I meant and told us the unique password that would grant my spouse and I access.  Tonight was ""Cold War"".  The secrecy and use of codes words threw me back in time to the age of illegal pleasures (and alcohol was illegal).  I moved toward the bar and then used this pass-phrase in a sentence.  ""I'm glad the cold war is over,"" and, reminiscent of a spy film, the secondary bouncer agreed in kind, allowing access to the bar.

When we finished our beverage we progressed to a wonderfully hidden passageway to enter 1923: Bourbon & Burlesque.  Tonight was the second night of operation, the ""soft opening.""  Everything was clean and crisp, and begged to be toured.  There is the cigar room with paintings on the wall demanding the masculine man to breathe in its offerings.  We found our seats on the ground level in front of the main ""stage.""  The bar may be appear small, but I prefer to say intimate.  You can mix and mingle with like minded persons, but I relaxed with my wife.

The bar is fairly priced for the strip.  

Now, to get to my review:  
Many of the men, from the bouncer outside to the band members inside wore the typical fedora or Newboy hat.  There were other hats of that era why not try them out?  See Cloche hat for women, or the Bowler, Homburg and Straw Boater for men. And the Cocktail servers looked like they came off their shift from dancing on the card tables.  Change their attire please.  You can still be sexy.  Speaking of, the cocktail waitresses were no where near the version of 1920s beauty.  See Christina Hendricks in Mad Men.  

I was not a fan of the DJ playing bass bumping music.  Was I in a speakeasy or an attempt at being another club?  Refer to The Great Gatsby and encourage use of the dance floor.  However, as the night progressed things changed from a club to speakeasy with a live band playing off to the side.  The band played mixed songs, more instrumentals of modern music which was perfect for me.  The volume was a bit too loud for my taste, it seemed I was yelling at my wife sitting right next to me.  Allow patrons to have an even conversation about their Vegas conquest without feeling like shouting.  

The Bar and service.  Service was great or perhaps they were overstaffed?  Cause of the soft open.  The first bar you see is the mixology bar, where they can work their magic conjuring any drink you desire.  I went to the secondary bar.  I was able to strike a conversation with the bartender, as though we already knew each other.  We shared a laugh and I enjoyed whiskey.  Oh, no ice please, I prefer whiskey stones.

Then there is the performances.  This makes everything worth it.  Remember how I said this was intimate? Well, if you don't have a good seat, then good luck. The layout is too flat, practically one leveled.  But we were lucky. 
The burlesque performances are supported by Holly Madison aka ""The Girl Next Door"" and she did not fail to put on a show.  Being so close quartered, performers secretly go on stage and the only queue is the change in music, which calmly pulls your attention to the show.  I don't think you'll find a more sultry respectable performance like this anywhere on the strip (and industrial is NOT the strip).  
The piano-singer interaction made me feel I was the only one tucked away in the forbidden speakeasy being serenaded.  One of the singers, even came down to the crowd to entertain us with her vocals.  SKYE .. With an ""E"" for EVERYTHING.  This was not all at once but spread throughout the night; however, I would prefer that someone sing between shows to add to the background band.

My wife and I went on the second night of their soft opening, so things may have changed.  So, why 5 stars?  Even though I have a few critiques I see all its potential.  Our hands on experience and the atmosphere made this local couple look forward to coming back.  Besides, you may run into a celebrity or two.",EmeSXFWHiCd0JCZMeiedBw,1,1,5,RWEVTIp79lXMy_XBJRin3w

1672064,2014-05-07,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"Celebrated a friend's bachelor party over this past weekend and heard about 1923 through Holly Madison's twitter feed.  Even though we had a full itinerary laid out for my friend's bachelor party weekend, I knew I had to incorporate a visit to Holly's 1923 speakeasy.

So glad I did! There's a large 1923 sign next to the elevators leading to The Shoppes with a vintage Model T parked out front. When we arrived, the place was closed for a private event, but after speaking to the doorman dressed in 20's gear, we learned they'd open up the lounge in about ten minutes since the private party was ending.  

When we returned we walked up to the small bourbon bar area outside and gave the hostess a password that was given to us by the doorman. The hostess granted us access to the lounge by pulling open a secret door on the brick wall that looked like a wood shelving unit with liquor bottles.  She guided us through a small dimly lit hallway which after a small turn opened up into a lounge area with a bar in the center.  There was a jazz band playing to the far right and the stage area was all along the wall behind another bar.  We chose a seat in the lounge area and ordered drinks off the cocktail menu.  The one I selected was called the Holy Grail which was amazing.

As far as the cabaret show, that did not disappoint.  The stage numbers occurred throughout the evening, with little breaks in between to set up for the following numbers.  Music from the DJ would play when the stage was bare.
The dancers and routines were incredibly sexy and the band and jazz vocalists sounded great. 

Holly looked stunning and glamorous in her 20's style costumes while dancing onstage with her equally sexy dancers.  Also amazing, was feature dancer Meeka who did an incredibly seductive striptease number.  And singer/hostess Skye Dee Miles did an excellent job working the room, first singing on stage and later coming out to sing and mingle with the patrons. Such an amazing group of performers and I was glad I was able to meet and mingle with some of the talent including Holly who couldn't have been more sweet.

After the last act, we went outside to the bourbon bar, ordering drinks and talking to the bartender and the outside hostess; couldn't have been a friendlier staff.
We had such a great time that we returned the next night to enjoy it all over again, tasting new drinks from the menu and again enjoying a great burlesque/cabaret.  

Overall, the 1920's style speakeasy theme creates a unique experience and environment that guests will enjoy whether you're a bachelor/bachelorette party group or a couple looking to hang out.  

Definitely a fun time for anyone looking for a cool chill atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back when I visit Vegas again later on this summer.",nMcXuYNwqh5RmQVAvzu8wQ,10,4,5,1pIPBgvZRxcHTrkcNnoQ5g

When you order something on the rocks they pour you extra ounces of alcohol. So the $3 is actually getting you almost a double pour. Not your typical 1.5 ounce pour on ice without a mixer.

2074013,2014-07-21,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"This review solely goes for AFTER nightclub as I've only gone to this establishment during after hours.  

Aesthetically pleasing which somewhat reminds me of an upgraded Artisan especially the cigar room.  The venue itself, however, is quite small with a dance floor that can only hold up to15-20 people at a time.  Nonetheless, I can see why this joint gets the BEST AUTHENTIC HOUSE PARTY of 2014 since their residents spin great underground house that'll keep you bumping till 8 a.m.!!  My European friends even prefer what's being played at this place than the likes of Drai's After Hours/Artisan.

There are two bars inside the lounge but only the middle one was open for the night.  Despite of having a single serving station, getting booze didn't take long especially with a huge crowd trying to get liquored up.  Only complaint was the sketchy price increase of drinks as the night went on; I even recall paying $13 for Vodka Red Bull although they were initially only $11!!

Overall, AFTER is one of the few places in Las Vegas playing impressive underground house music, yet I'm not too sure if 1923 Bourbon & Burlesque is the spot for such  party.  If you've been to their former location, you'd agree they should have just kept it there as the old venue provides more room for dancing.  Locals also have to pay $10 with valid Nevada I.D. while out-of-towners are $20 per head.  Nevertheless, if this is the only way to have AFTER in this valley then I guess it's a small price we have to pay.  Will be back to check out the bar during regular hours for their specialty cocktails and speakeasy-esque vibe.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,2,1,3,qvXNB8ZUWYNR6WDa4T2Fnw

We were given the rundown on the $50 / person seats and took two near the dj booth. The drink menus on the tables make no mention of bourbons. I ended up with a mojito, without fresh mint. Turns out you have to ask for the bourbon menu separately. They had a couple dozen listed. Most were the mass produced big name brands, none worthy of the money they were charging.They had one bourbon cocktail listed. Later I asked the waitress for an ashtray, which she brought over. I started to enjoy my cigar when the manager said you can only smoke cigars in the separate back room. And it just kept going.down hill from there. We got back to our table, and one of the beers we left there was gone. 

Before the show starts one of the performers was standing next to me and actually flicked her ashes on my arm!!! Now the show starts, and if you are not at one of the front tables your view is blocked by everyone that moves up from the bar area. $50 for obstructed view!! We had to sit up on the railing to get glimpses of the stage.

There was no live band the night we went, and from what we could tell Holly came out for one song. We were expecting a 1920's experience. What we got was blaring 80's music.

The show was good, from what we could see of it. The dj doubled as the lighting guy and had to adjust the spotlight sitting on the dj booth to light up the performers.

They only had two waitresses on, and they ran their butts off. 

This place doesn't know what it wants to be. If bourbon is in the name, have signature bourbon drinks. If it's supposed to be a 1920's speakeasy have a1920's atmosphere.",Q4QZ-5crrtPT1QZePGZI9g,6,1,2,XgrffdyTrKiNrHJVTQcaoQ

A few things though- they played modern club music inside. I really wish they had played upbeat jazz, like 1920s new orleans jazz or something. It also was really loud music- whereas speakeasy especially were generally quiet and refined. The decor also stated something like ' prohibition is over', but prohibition has just taken effect in 1923.

I had been hearing about this place for weeks, and being a speakeasy themed lounge lover, knew that I had to pay this place a visit. I raced over to the Mandalay via the walkways from the Luxor and walked about halfway thru the casino before I found a security guard who had heard of the place and turned me in the right direction. Turns out I had passed it, it's so discreet outside, nestled underneath the escalators connecting the two hotels, across from Criss Angel's magic shop.

The outside, as I mentioned, is pretty discreet, showing only a desk tucked in a corner in front of a gorgeous gilded mirror with a couple of bookcases and various other decor surrounding it and that famous white 20's car off to the side. I found a guy just outside and asked if it was still open. He said they were coming to a close but there were still some partiers inside, opened up a bookcase to reveal a door and a dimly lit hallway, and I was in.

Everything about the inside politely taps you on the shoulder, telling you you've been transported to a 20's era speakeasy and you don't want to go back. One walkway around the bar has a few black and whites taken during the time period while another surprises you with a small stage in the wall for a band, instruments set up with musicians or not. At the center lies the main stage, more long than wide, with what appeared to be a smaller bar down alongside it, slightly below stage level so as not to interfere with the acts, comfy chairs and tables lining the area. An upright piano sits discreetly off to the side of the stage, not too far from the DJ's booth, also nicely blending in with the decor. In the midst of all that raised in the center of the lounge is the main bar, a nice square fully stocked with the makings of their specialty cocktails and any other drink concoction you desire. 

Employees are  dressed as newsboys or corseted gals as they cheerfully and quickly take your drink orders. As they were winding down I was unsure if I'd be able to sample a cocktail, but as I hoovered on the bar, a friendly blonde brought me a menu and happily made me a drink, making suggestions when I asked. I ordered That Strange Rush, a delicious blueberry liquor mixture, that had me wishing I had arrived earlier for more. The bar area has many more tables and chairs, all elegant and comfy.

I roamed the place beverage in hand to check out the landscape and stumbled upon the cigar room, decorated with nice white couches and portraits, keeping with the 20s theme.

Everyone was very friendly and inviting, I never felt like I was intruding as I worried I might, coming in so late. The other party's seemed to be enjoying themselves as well, joint with the bartenders as if they were old friends while sipping their drinks.

I finished my drink and regretfully left, walking down an adjacent dimly lit hallway near the entrance and discovering I had walked thru a brick wall by the car.

I definitely want to come back again, this time for the shows!",mpknILR3EaBrMC54VHzJwg,4,2,5,UqxxvAE0APYJkyg-4m5xiA

ATMOSPHERE:

This was for the Prohibition Revolt Event...

 Entering through the secret door, dark, dimly lit, and a little swanky, it started of with a great time seeing peeps dressed up Gatsby style and the Shaun De Graff Band  playing songs from the 80's, 90's, and today with a 20's twist. As the night progressed, it got worse when hoards of people looking like they came off a party bus came through the door wearing beaded necklaces with ""Hello My Name Is"" tags!?!? Looked like a Meet Up group times 10, not even dressed for the occasion, staff was overwhelmed,  and it felt like a sardine can....it's sadly all about the money.


BURLESQUE/BEVERAGES: 

Burlesque is done tastefully and sensually....Striptease is raunchy and sleazy...the dancer that we saw was definitely striptease without taking it all off, tearing of clothing and hanging off the ceiling rod? Definitely not Burlesque...

Seeing pictures of the drink menu, they were priced in the $12-$14 range...The cocktail menu we looked at that night didn't have prices at all!?!?! Two Moscow Mules later? $40!?!? More expensive than the drinks at Rose.Rabbit.Lie!!! Hard lesson learned...:\ 


CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Opened just this past May, Holly Madison parted ways with the company  in December, and is now alleging that her and other dancers were secretly videotaped by management of 1923 Bourbon & Burlesque without permission in the dressing room area...we shall see what becomes of this serious allegation...

All in all, major disappointment...softcore striptease instead of tasteful, sensual burlesque, (we left the madness after the first dancer) outrageous drink prices. Avoid at all costs...ALOHA!!

Shaka Meter: ZERO! Not even a pinky! Maybe more like the middle finger!

I wasn't sure of the stats on the place, so I had called Mandalay Bay box office and the woman had no info to give me, I wasn't sure if we needed tickets prior, or if we purchase there, I then searched the actual 1923 website and didn't get any info there as well. I ended up speaking with concierge and she was the most helpful, this is the info I can pass along to others:

*No cover charge for locals
*$20 cover for non-locals 
*If you're interested in getting a table, you can email info@1923lv.com and they should get back to you within 24 hours.

If you show up around 10p and get yourself a seat at the bar, you'll have a perfect view for the stage, the entire place only holds 150 people, and the place got packed really quick, there were no seats or anywhere to stand by 11. Holly Madison performs 3 times nightly, and the shows run from 11p-2a. 

Jazz band plays intermittently throughout the night as well as a house DJ. They have a small specialty cocktail menu, Pisco Sour included. Our bartender, Marvin, was able to create a cocktail off menu by us telling him what our likes are. 

They have a cigar room in the back and they also sell them at the bar. They do allow smoking in the lounge, and it did get pretty smokey between the cigarettes and cigars, so be warned.

4072677,2014-09-03,2,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"Oh you have so much potential... if your listening take some advice from the negative reviews and try to work on a few things as i would love to have this place to take out of town guests but as it sits id be embarrassed to do it again. The door man was pleasant, nice guy who takes care of his locals (and military!) and we will in turn take care of him...good man (thank you sincerely). 
Walking in the layout wasn't great but not totally terrible, as the stage yes is a bit hard to see at times but so understandable and easily remedied if you get off your butt and find a spot with a better view temp when the dancers do come on. First note of advice, get a few of the smaller ottoman chairs and scatter a few in the back seating area. The snake run of seating is all side by side seating, and in a LOUD music filled bar its tough to yell to people in your group if only the person right next to you can hear. The ottomans will allow people to sit in eyes view of their company and interaction will be better, allow them to converse more, hang out longer, and buy more drinks. This is one of the reasons i wanted to leave, cause i was standing in front of my guests to converse while they sat (very awkward).
One a weekend you may want to employ more than 1 waitress on the floor, especially a 3 day weekend. And one that is somewhat efficient, as she was only able to take one groups order before making her way back to the bar instead of taking several orders and then returning (so slow). This resulted in walking in and this is no exaggeration a 40 minute wait just to see the waitress. I was able to run back to valet for my car, another two people to the bathroom and still return before any of us saw a waitress. Big negative there, especially when drinks are $14+.
Now the reason we left...its simple. I read speakeasy, so i think Laundry Room and with maybe a little class. The decor is there, the layout is fine and the dancers are believe it or not GREAT. But the DJ does not play the room one bit. This is not iCandy so we do not need you to spin the lately top 40 dance music, and to make it worse at a ridiculous level that people cannot hear each other interact. The place was filled with a more mature crowd, mostly couples but you had a few groups like my own around looking to just chill with a vibe and this was NOT it. Even when the girls got up to dance, the DJ had the music blaring at a retarded level and there was nothing sensual about that. Play the vibe of the location and create a vibe or atmosphere... if you take ANY advice let this be it as i would have stayed if just THIS was remedied. 
B&B could have flavor, and could be a nice spot but there is much improvement to be had. Ill say the girls were a real delight as they were actually beautiful and had a few skills here and there. You get a few good routines down with some softer played music to the mood and vibe and you could have a real winner on your hands. I truly believe i could do better than the DJ with my iPod for the dancers and  my Pandora account for the background music when the dancers are not performing.

4419201,2014-05-27,0,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"There are some really really great things about this bar.  And there are some things that definitely need tweaking (and I hope the owner or manager reads).

Great?  The costumes, the theme, the live music, the way you enter the bar, the decor and atmosphere, the actual drinks (mixed perfectly).  The performers are really cute/sexy (just depending on the number) and the solo acts are awesome.  The solo singer (""Skye""--the ""E"" stands for ""extra everything"") is fantastic, definitely one of our favorite things about the show.  Doorman and waitress were very friendly.

Not so great?  Only about half of the seats/tables in the joint have a view of the stage and most of the tables were reserved when we walked in.  We soon learned it was a $100 minimum to have one of those tables.  Now ordinarily, that's not a problem, except that for two people (which is all these tables can manage), that's about six drinks total.  They're strong--1920's strong--so we weren't doing that.  I strongly recommend they have food as a way to offset some of the 'required' prices for good tables.  

Also, we sat there for about 20 mins before anyone came over to take our drink order.  After that though, our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  

The show starts around 11 p.m. and lasts for..?  I'm not sure, we left around 12:00 midnight and another act was starting.  The actual acts are spaced apart by several minutes, and in-between really disjointed music plays (70's disco, MJ, Justin Timberlake).  Um hello?  You are doing a 20's show, so how about keeping the theme the same,  if only for the duration of the show?  THAT would be cool!   Also, how about have the live band plays music from the 20's from 10 p.m. until the start of the show?  I didn't come to a 20's bar to hear modern-day music!

The girls come out of a brightly lit doorway with a black curtain that's a bit distracting, so I would strongly recommend the management consider a double--hung curtain, so they come out from the doorway and stand in front of a black curtain BEFORE the audience can see them.  The drinks are pricey, $15 for mixed drinks, but maybe that's the Strip prices?

Overally, this is a really great idea, we loved the staffs' costumes, the vintage car outside, the drinks, the decor, and the show.  Just a few tweaks of operations would elevate them from good to excellent.  I hope they do it!",EC5nxNCWCmjHg1F14WrlxQ,7,1,3,Xuf4akHvChVbsU34S15JJA

Daughter has been on a Moscow Mule kick and I'm been in the mood for a Sazerac. I must say, this was far better than the other bars we had been too so far! There weren't too many customers yet so we were able to talk up Nick. He even gave us a sample of a bourbon he was infusing with aromatics!

This place has a great concept, prohibition era speak easy with a decent whiskey list and decent cigar menu.  Thats all well and good and the whiskey prices aren't bad considering its vegas and all.  The problem comes when you order your drink on the rocks.  Well thats $3 extra... $3 for ice... now this is not proper whiskey ice cubes you would find at say 7 grand in LA or the Whiskey library in Portland.  No this is the same ice you'd fill your room ice bucket with from the ice machine on your floor.  That part is why the review is low.

The decor was a little confusing. I liked the walls and where the band would set up, but I didn't like the alligator accents or the feu velvet couches.  Looked tacky.  With all of that, the biggest disappointment was the pre made Old Fashioned, poured out of a barrel.  I had a better experience at RX Boiler Room.

A speak easy from the 1920's, and while sure, Vegas Strip'esque (you walk up to a seemingly innocent bar only to be escorted into a fantasy world of beautiful women), it serves up the best bourbons the States has to offer.

Angel's Envy, Elijah Craig 21, E.H. Taylor Small Batch, Pappy's 23yr old Grand Reserve (which they are currently out of).  It's all there for the taking if you're willing to pay.  And pay your will.  Very high  Vegas markups.

Minimum charge for a seat or table ($50 if you want to stand), but well, well, well worth it for the burlesque show.  Not too racy, very suggestive.  Good audience mix from guys to gals all having a good time.

A true hidden gem of a night spot and one deserving of a try for any bourbon enthusiast.

So why four stars?  It turns out that, due to a change in management policy as of a little over a month ago, there is no more burlesque, except for private events.  Not sure why my hotel concierge (or that of Mandalay's) didn't know that.  One bartender I spoke with said they may bring the show back at some point, but not for the foreseeable future.

I was later told that the change had something to do with drunk frat-bros harassing the burlesque dancers while being loud, drunk, and boisterous (in other words, bros), so I think it's a totally sensible change.

5278247,2015-02-11,3,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,"I came to 1923 Bourbon and Burlesque with a friend for the Prohibition Revolt party. Entry was free with an RSVP and 1920's attire was encouraged. Sold! I'm there! I was amped to finally get a chance to visit 1923 and was expecting great things. Sadly, my notions of a great night at 1923 were quickly quashed. 

ATMOSPHERE: Most attendees were dressed in 1920s attire, so that was a plus. Walking in through the ""secret entrance"" was a cool feature, but the novelty quickly wore off once I settled inside. There wasn't anywhere to sit. Oh wait, there was plenty of seating but it was all ""Reserved"". I hate that! Especially if it's a speakeasy type place, shouldn't it be more lounge friendly? The only place to sit is in the red  cigar room, which is surprisingly empty of patrons. The music playing was NOT the business. The ""Jazz"" band promoted for this event was not playing jazz. They were playing Top 40 tunes. Huh?

VALUE: Cocktail drinks were $19 and the menus were ominously lacking pricing information. I'd expect that kind of pricing at a high end club, not a speakeasy.

BURLESQUE: Ha! I'm glad I didn't stay to watch this act because according to Nelson Q., it was a sad sight to bear witness to. The band announced the act would come on at 10PM. I waited until 10:20. Nothing. Without anywhere to sit, and without a drink in hand because I refuse to pay $19 for a cocktail, I said buh-bye. 

As I was leaving, a horde of people lined up to get into 1923 who were part of some party tour. Of course they weren't dressed in theme and were acting like hooligans. My exit was perfectly timed, I guess!

2 stars because the bartenders were quick to ask if I needed help and were nice. 

Worth a Return Visit? 
No way, Jose!

 NOTE:  If you sit up front there is a $50 per person minimum!  (friendly bartender was kind enough to warn us). Hey, we are bored out-of-towners looking for a true Vegas experience...we're all in!  

So after about three hours, we had experienced the talent of  three different gals (two performed twice each) and one once.  They came out maybe every twenty minutes.

Also if you sit up front, be prepared to pick up your drink when the gal comes out, as she might dance on the bar in front of you.  The gals were fantastic!  Very gymnastic!  And very classy. Loved watching Husband's reaction!   Sad that the piano that was on the stage was never used for playing.  Would have loved to have had some live music...more show-like!  (gals sure utilized the curtains and poles however).As for show, the bartenders alone were an incredible show...they sure hustle!
