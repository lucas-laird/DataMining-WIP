    I have to say though this is your average run of the mill sub shop, nothing that will stand out and say man I love this place! But having said that, the dozens of times I've been here I've never had a negative experience unless you count them mixing onions in their lettuce who knows how many time lol but that's no biggie. 
    3 of 5 cause that's George W Bush... you know average... okay he had C average but you know dang well he bought that.  That's beyond the point though lol",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,0,0,3,zXFb665hJx9tkOAYxNH-Zw
1700677,2015-04-03,0,AztVIokc5VtP4m8r6kSnWw,If there was a way i could put zero stars i would. I had the WORST experience at this subway. We had a group of about 5 people we were on our way to an event. When we first walked in a lady walked out and said she was going on break and that a lady would be right out to serve us. We stood and waited about 2-3 mins till i had to say hello. This employee named Terry walked out and in the beginning was very rude. You can tell she did not want to make our sandwhiches. This Terry lady was rude about changing meats in the sandwhiches when i been to subway plenty of subways and others did it. She also messed up one of our sandwhiches. We requested ranch on it and she squirted it down with mayo. We told her it was mayo and she ignored us. We had to tell her about 3-4 times till she finally looked up and reliezed. I will never step foot into this subway ever again and if you do dont let Terry serve you!!!! Totally killed my subway vibe,-y-CfRzjKmCRx-Ov-v4PHQ,0,0,1,-nm0jNw-glWr6qMZBZFxGg

Half of them look like they just got done smoking a joint or taking a nap.. Careless to make a decent sandwich which, is every time I come in. So I have to say, today was my last visit. My sandwich was a joke and falling apart. I'd rather take the 10 min drive to port of subs",HIbrGcTWXuxMLcqDQHIvPg,0,0,2,lH8lKgv_b-QB962ylyISlw

Due to the line, I used the restroom before ordering. Restrooms had the keys dangling out of the locks (like at a gas station where you have to get a key) so I'm not sure why they even bother with having a key. Came out of the restroom with zero people in line, and waited about 5 minutes to even be acknowledged and no one around. When he actually surfaced, this kid acted like he was on something. I had a coupon for .50 cents off a 6 inch. I always get veggie with extra cheese, so for a 6 inch with extra cheese (that they most certainly charge for the extra cheese) should be 4 slices. He put 3, whatever. Seeing as how my ENTIRE SANDWICH is veggies, when I started telling him the veggies I want, he barely put any. I had to keep asking for more, but when I said I wanted onions, he literally took a large handful and slapped it on there. The bread was stale and gross. I know he didn't apply the coupon I had, and refused to give me a receipt. Seriously?? Literally the only reason I still deal with Subway is that it's close to my house.. from now on I won't be so lazy, and will actually make the trip elsewhere.",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,0,0,1,sqlbyqlzav_B3_nqgSaBdA
4054757,2011-07-12,0,AztVIokc5VtP4m8r6kSnWw,"After running some errands in the area, I had 10 minutes to grab lunch and get back to work. This Subway was convenient for me to swing into so I stopped for a sandwich to go. 

There was one customer ahead of me that was getting a toasted sandwich. I did not want my sandwich toasted, and rather then making me wait for the first customers order to be complete, as some places will sometimes do, they finished my sandwich first which I appreciated. 

Overall, nothing special about this place but nothing bad either. Just your standard Subway sandwich buying experience. I would probably stop back by if I was in the area and wanted a sandwich for lunch.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,0,0,3,mRr-OqQAKK1Mpe64RbOORw
4595257,2010-06-16,3,AztVIokc5VtP4m8r6kSnWw,"It was great when I first walked in, there was no line and there were 2 people helping me. It was perfect! Because I had ordered 2 foot longs, they were quick and fast.  Another customer came in behind me and they seemed to go even faster I was impressed.
I was very nice and sweet to them but for some reason the lady who took care of me at the end of my order had this nasty attitude. 
I asked if she can cut the subs in four and I didn't hear her reply to confirm nor did I see that she cut the subs because she was quick, I asked again if she can cut them in four and she totally snapped and said ""I DID"" as if I was an annoying customer. I was in AWE. 
First of all there was no line. 
Second there was only 1 customer besides myself.
Third, I was nothing but nice to them AND having an awesome day UNTIL she snapped.
I will no longer bring my business to this subway due to this particular expirence as it was my First and now my Last.",Q3eM3xS_tWr56GrRDJO8Ag,4,0,1,3ByTpcl-Hd6AuaWrq19s1w

5736283,2017-02-17,0,AztVIokc5VtP4m8r6kSnWw,"Slowest and worst Subway experience ever. The workers weren't even trying to hustle (even when the line was 10+ people long at one point), and they just kept moving as slow as snails. They were so rude and kept acting like we were annoying them when we asked for a little more lettuce. While we were standing in line, one of the girls rudely said, ""You have to call ahead if you want more than 5 sandwiches"". We were all paying separately and weren't together? The girls' names were Dianne and Shayanne (sp?). Absolutely ridiculous. Never coming back.",nE9jUc1e_toWqnpkB9Jg3g,0,0,1,ZQAE6ExNN6xUnausv4qfuw
