That for me was the proof that these guys are real!

I had been personally referred to them by past clients and I felt comfortable with them once I met with them.  They were extremely professional and communicated with me the whole time they had the truck.  They sent me progress pictures and delivered the vehicle back when they had told me it would be completed.  The truck looks amazing!  So many people have inspected their work and told me it is the best wrap they have seen on a Raptor.  There are no seams anywhere.  They did inside the door frames, inside the tailgate, everywhere!  I can not speak highly enough about this company and their work!  If you have even thought about getting your car wrapped then Incognito is the place to go.

Even though I went without an appointment, Chris took some time to take pictures of my car, hear my price range and my desire to ""make it prettier"".  In two days he had a proposed design for me, which I LOVED, with body accents and some shading for the wheels.  The soonest appointment was two weeks out but they only had my car for a day and the car wrap has held up beautifully.  I'm stoked because this is something I can have changed out easily every few months or a year as the mood strikes me.  I'm always a little edgy taking my car to a new place but all the guys at the shop treated her as carefully as I do so I felt safe leaving her out of my sight for the day.",_llMR1EbtkiokbX-HOSk9Q,0,0,5,cMaA2sfwwFFAJJpXqULejg

The design and areas for the work I thought were very intricate. I was amazed at the craftsmanship and quality of the finished product.

I then happened to look at their website and did a search for Tesla.  Amazing.  I never realized what you could do with wraps.  Joe, the owner, was not pushy and showed me the various things that could be done including the chrome delete.  The chrome delete looked amazing.  Joe made sure I liked the colors going over them in both the sun and shade.  Because of my busy schedule, he went out of his way to pick and drop of the car.  The chrome delete looked incredible!!  The carbon fire wrap looks authentic.  There was complete attention to detail.  It was worth it.  Hats off to Joe and his team.",ByU8dVNEv6Z-1lsmAkXOOQ,1,0,5,IfbE3Kuym4lbhYtLUToKgw

They performed a chrome delete on my car as well as an insane caliper and rim wrap. They completed the work in the time promised and stand by their work. I had a little issue with one of the small parts of the wrap and they were able to rewrap it the next day. Truly a good business with even better people working there.

Incognito Wraps was the fastest, most professional, and most polite in their communications.  They offered the best price, too, by far.  Today they wrapped the last car and I went to the shop by myself.  It was such a beautiful, hassle-free experience, that I am in awe.  The car looks beautiful.  And it was super fast.  They told me an hour, but were done in 30 minutes. Just as I was getting comfortable on their couch in the waiting area...

Things were great until we returned to my car, 2013 Lincoln MKZ 3.7 with the panoramic roof, and realized that someone either pulled into or out of the parking space next to me and damaged the rear quarter panel of my LINCOLN. YES I WAS PISSED. My son said dad don't worry I know were you can get that fix so don't be pissed.....it's a WRAP!  What???  It's not a WRAP, now I have to get my ride painted and my insurance may be effected plus my car will be in the shop for probably 2 to 3 weeks.... I'm going to find out how this happen!  My son said don't worry pops it's a WRAP....INCOGNITO WRAPS will hook you up.....NO PROBLEM.

Las Vegas let me tell you something, my Lincoln has a unique white pearl paint job and I found out it was very expensive to get the damage repaired plus the paint may not match.  So I took my son's advice and went to INCOGNITO WRAPS.   DAMMMMM was I surprised......Joe, his wife, and his staff was AWESOME!   Joe look over the damage of my Lincoln and said pick a color and I will have your car completely restored in a few days.  Joe had so many colors I thought I was inside a rainbow, it was AMAZING!  Finally I found my color ""Milky Way"" and change the entire look of my ride.   When I saw my car I couldn't believe my eyes my Lincoln was BLING-BLING!......of the chain!!!!!
