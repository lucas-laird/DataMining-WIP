Menu includes breakfast and lunch specials (soups, salads, sandwiches), and coffees- the coffee is what brought me in this way, but the machine was broke and they were oddly out of soup at 11AM. Ordered a pastrami sandwich (fresh but plain) with fries for my guy and a seafood Louis salad for myself- both were made fresh, nicely presented, and well-priced. The salad was overflowing with shrimp for under $10.

 I had to call to get directions because this spot was so hard to find. 
Note that this spot is only open weekdays for lunch hours.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,9,3,AWfJSQb9Hlv_XXkECphDNA

I met Sam when I first started in 2003 and I've never met a friendlier guy who appears to love what he does.  And what still amazes me to this day is that Sam has the superhuman ability to remember each of his customers by name.

The food is great!  I've had just about everything on the menu but my favorites are his homestyle daily lunch specials.  I haven't worked anywhere near this location in 4 years and I had been dying to get back for lunch one day.  I was finally in the neighborhood (truthfully I drove up from E Sahara ... it's that good) and dropped in for the pot roast lunch special with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  It was as great as I remembered!

If you're in the neighborhood looking for a great place for lunch, go find Courtyard Deli.  I dare you to find something you don't like on that menu ... which I'm pretty sure is the same handwritten whiteboard menu unchanged since I first saw it all those years ago.",H-Pzp3IK_mfhQaIh9IKHvg,1,0,5,e0BEIlyPRfOj9leq4IQzQg

My personal favorites are Pot Roast (served every other Wednesday) with mashed potatoes, pot roast gravy, and green beans. The 3 bean soup. Portions are HUGE (literally 2 meals in one - great for sharing or enjoying later) and all for the cost a Big Mac Meal at McD's.
