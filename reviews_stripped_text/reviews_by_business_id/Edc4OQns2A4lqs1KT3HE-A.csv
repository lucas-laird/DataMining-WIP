I have never experienced such horrible customer service from a business in my life. My issue was small, I placed an online order and used a free pizza coupon for one of my pizzas but there was a glitch or something on the website and when I went to pick up my two pizzas, the free one was never made. The issue could have been solved then and there by an apology and maybe an offer to make the pizza? (I probably would have said no if they offered but offering would have been good customer service). Instead, I was told by the employee ""that's not my problem"" and ""I guess I can give you the number to our IT department or something"". I left feeling like I was at fault...not a feeling that any business should make a customer feel. I went to the website and wrote a complaint...no response. Wrote another complaint...no response. Wrote a third complaint and am supposed to hear from someone soon but I doubt that will happen. If you want to be treated poorly by the employees then I guess this is the place to go....",3dGfjhu3ira0OaYRnwHEaA,0,0,1,4vyyRD5zLuyeSGe8FqzbaA
379399,2015-06-11,0,Edc4OQns2A4lqs1KT3HE-A,I would give u a 0 if I could.  They made a mistake on my order last night.  Instead of getting my usual pizza they gave me a plain cheese pizza.  I called them back last night and the guy said that they were closed but call back tomorrow and they will fix it.  When I got off work I called back and wow.  The lady put me on hold for 5 mins without even saying hi.  When she answered I told her what happened and she said oh ok please hold.  By this point it was 15 mins later and she answered welcome to papa johns pizza how can I help u.  And I said I've been on hold for 15 mins.  She said oh so sorry we r busy and I explained to her again.  She said ok one moment and she left without putting me on hold.  I listened to the girls talking and laughing for 10 mins in the background.  Then the phone rang and I was automatically on hold again!!!  When she came back she said welcome to papa johns how can I help u and I was like are u for real right now????  Around 28 mins into the call I got on the phone with the manager and I told him everything and that the guy said to just call back and it would be good.  He's like there is no note and no credits given.  I couldn't believe him at all.  And then I told him so r u telling me u r not going to fix the mistake u made?  And he started giving me attitude.  Wow this was the worst experience I have EVER had in my life and I took a screen shot of the 32 minute phone call.  Corporate will definitely be hearing about this.

The pizzas had small slices and the size of medium ones. When I spoke to the owner about this he said we never ordered any pizza from there, gave him my husbands name, whom the pizza was ordered under and still said he had no order under that name. Then He asked for the # and gave him my husbands # and still said no order was placed there, when we just spent $40 and walked out with 2 pathetic size pizzas. I told him we just came in and picked them up and he miraculously remembered the. I asked how many pieces were on the medium he said 8 then when I explained we ordered large pizzas he said the large has 8 pieces also.

He was rude upon immediately answering the phone. I placed my order, and then politely asked if the 25% coupon was applied to both pizzas I'd ordered. He responded in such a condescending way that he absolutely was NOT applying 25% to both pizzas but only to the whole order. I said, oh ok, that's sort of the same thing isn't it? Nope. He gets even more rude as he explains that 25% off each pizza would actually be 50% off the entire order.  I'm not sure where he learned that way of doing math, but it's so wrong it's comical. If this is what you'd like to deal with when placing orders, by all means. Luckily, the delivery drivers are always pleasant.",LRiZjYPmFD6GtaG6t6rnNw,0,0,2,q0NWY0mqUIeotGKvFtSoqQ

For starters the order was off. No biggy, this old soldier knows how to adapt and overcome, especially when it comes to pizza warfare behind enemy lines. But it just didn't taste great. It didn't taste bad per se, it just sort of didn't taste. The wings were good, but then how hard is it nuke frozen wings and slather them in sauce... they were fine. But the pizza just lacked in every sense of the word, or word of the sense (of taste) for that matter. It just served to fill my gut and add another couple of pounds to my voluptuous figure. I accept that price, but the food has to taste good, and this didn't. 

Look, I don't need to be off-the-chart inspired by pizza, but it needs to taste good. This time it was just kind of blah and pointless. It didn't ""suck."" But it was heading in that general direction.

It gives me no pleasure but I'm afraid I'm forced to place PaPa John's in the ""Suspended and under future review"" file. It wasn't a crime against the sanctity of the holy pizza realm.... but it wasn't good pizza. There's just too many good pizza joints out there to waste my waist and cash on this place. Sorry PaPa's, you're not fired yet, but certainly on probation with me. I'll give you another shot in the future, maybe, but for now it's bah-by.",5JY40klkhTY1tapwAL394Q,0,0,2,lRd0TyXmm82hmicIWjbYTg

I've ordered from this particular PJ's three times and each time there's been something bad. First time they forgot to make one of the three pizzas we ordered. Second time was a delivery that was supposed to be delivered within 30 minutes but arrived an hour later. Third time they were extremely rude when we went to pick up the order. They assumed I was someone else when I had walked in the door and barked ""5 minutes"" at me. 5 minutes what? The F you talking about? He thought I was someone who had called in earlier... what a douche.

With 20 minutes to close, we called to order, and the dude clearly did not want to make any more pizza. He asked if we wanted pick up or delivery, then, when we said pick up, he revealed that they were only doing delivery at that hour. Okay, so why ask? Just fishing for excuses to refuse our order?

So we opted for delivery, but he refused to deliver to a business address because they said it's a ""safety issue."" Okay, so it's somehow safer to deliver to a private residence, completely away from the public, than to a public business?

Also refused do deliver to the parking lot in front of their own building. We offered to still pay tip and delivery fee, but no, he said. It was a ""safety issue."" Apparently it is too dangerous for the driver to step outside the building, where his car is parked, even though he does that for literally every order he has to deliver.",7xmJsnK1fZwCADT0BNCcvQ,1,0,1,5zGCJZgt_LdzzshA0HcijA

To be honest, I think the driver was sent when I called. The pizza and sticks were not even warm. No apology, no offer to fix anything.

Come to find out the pizza in the box is NOT an Extra Large, but the Large size (16""). Having been previously employed by Papa John's I can tell the difference in sizes and what happened. Either they ran out of the Extra Large dough and didn't feel like calling about it, or they didn't want to have to pull the dough for the 18"" since those are not prepared ahead of time.

Placing an order online is the easiest method with little chances of mess up. Papa John's has a deal right now for one large specialty or up to seven topping pizza for $11.

With a delivery fee, taxes, and tip, it came out to $30. 

They quoted a 40-50 minute delivery time and came a little early. The pizza was hot, crispy, and the taste was alright. The sauce is on the runny side, but the toppings were good quality.
