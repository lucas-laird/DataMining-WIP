There was both indoor & outdoor seating that was perfect for hanging out with friends or even for parties! However, the coffee was decent & was overpriced. I thought this was an average cup o joe that definitely wasn't worth the price. The customer service wasn't the best either, we got most of our drinks right away but, we ended waited 15-20 mins for a smoothie that they forgot to make. They didn't offer compensation over the wait! Wish I would have had a better experience!!",uYeOYLJxmyzgOV7HlXMelA,1,1,3,t1uwDeiPLbqiP9--ZGPswg

The pink old fashion phone and white girls bicycle with the flower basket was my favorite decor in here, reminded me of old pictures of my mom in The Hamptons in the 60's. Lol we couldn't resist had to take fun photos it's such a cute setup.

My friend and I started off with the Cupcake Latte Iced I had mine with Almond Milk and it was sooooo delish! The mini cupcake on top was so moist and had so much flavor. We both really enjoyed this! 

We decided to get a few items and share that way we could experience more. The Let's Avocuddle was AMAZING so much flavor in the perfectly ripe avocado, it was lightly seasoned and that just gave it the right amount of zest. Savored every single bite of this toast.

Next we had the Granny's Sammy and also added avocado to the breakfast sandwich it also was so savory only thing we wish we would have added the bacon to give it a lol crunch and some saltiness to it. 

Lastly got the meat & cheese plate as well it was the perfect portion size and was beautifully displayed on s gorgeous platter. Had very good selection of cheeses each very different but all complimenting what else was on the plate. Yummy those almonds were tasty and I loved the fruit preserve on the toast too!

Oh yes we were so full and completely satisfied BUT we couldn't leave without getting any dessert!! That's my favorite meal of the day lol and their selection looked really good!

We chose to get 1 each of the macaroons, vanilla, pistachio, passion fruit, raspberry (I forgot the other one) 
Ahhhhhhh macaroons if made right are 1 of the best sweet indulges you can have and let me tell you these melted in your mouth were so light and airy but had the perfect slight crunch when you bit into them but were so moist inside. I would go back just for these absolutely a favorite here! 
The blueberry loaf was good too had just the right amount of blueberries in it was very moist as well and that touch of lemon made it have the perfect zest. Thankfully it was not a huge piece and we shared it and could barely fit in the last bite.

The prices are good I feel you pay a lil more at a cafe' like this but you get much better ingredients and quality of food & drinks are higher then an average cafe'.

Next visit definitely getting the Frose' this is a highlight of theirs and I've heard great reviews from others it's a must try! Plus I need more reasons to come back :))",XuoeEuN_QMJoMDKFB_Ws1w,0,0,5,_sdibilP1OIvK8rpN6WaWw

 My girlfriend and I ordered the Matcha frappe and the iced Emerald latte.  The Matcha frappe literally tasted as if I was drinking water with a hint of matcha.  We complained and they offered to swap drinks.  We then got the iced Emerald Latte which was also immensely watered down. We didn't even bother to make swap it out again.

 We then got the toast with berries.  It was good, but definitely not worth $10.  The toast consisted of berries, cream cheese, and honey.  Nothing spectacular.

But they also have vegan options, and comfortable seating, and friendly service, and an evening menu with charcuterie, and did someone say frose?! There are certain dining destinations that are termed ""an instagrammer's dream,"" and this place is definitely that. 

You'll probably spend a pretty penny here on your food and beverage, but  I want to stop shy of calling it overpriced- you don't have to spend $12 on a specialty tea latte with rose petals but you can. The salmon on their Barney toast was generously portioned for the price, and the Cupcake Latte includes a bite-size treat. Their croissants are the size of my face and they have salads and sandwiches for those looking for a more filling lunch in the area.

There's only a couple of things this spot needs: a few outdoor tables (seems to be shaded so that's a plus), more clarity on alternative milk fees (coconut milk is $2?), and more excuses for me to be on this side of town!

My friends got the cupcake latte. Yum! It is topped with whipped cream and pink sprinkles. It also comes with a mini cupcake (in our case since cupcakes were sold out, it came with a macaron). I ordered the very berry truffle latte. There wasn't as much of a coffee brew taste compared to the cupcake latte, but is had ""hello beautiful"" printed on top! Cute right?!

And the drinks were pretty good. My friend and I both got iced tea drinks. She got like a hibiscus flavored tea and I got a coconut crème white tea. Delicious and very refreshing especially in the hot summer afternoon!!
I would love to come back here again so I can try their coffee and food items.

Only one side of the wall is decorated with flowers and greenery while the other side is pretty plain. Wish they decorated the other wall as well so everyone isn't fighting for tables by the flower wall. Café Lola opened about a month ago so hopefully they're still adding some finishing touches to this place.

Also, I wanted to try the Lola's Signature Vanilla Rose Latte but that thing cost $12.18!!!!!!!! For a latte!?!?! It's oolong rose tea, organic rose water, milk, vanilla, crushed rose petals served with a rose macaron. Why the heck is this so expensive!?! Is it because there's ""organic"" rose water!?! -__- oh geez. I swear, the minute the word ""organic"" in something...the price shoots straight up! For that kind of price, I better lose 15 pounds IMMEDIATELY after drinking this!

The place was PACKED when I went there, with limited seating and a small building in general, it almost made me want to leave, but as I've been dying to try this place out I stayed. The customer service was honestly not good and the pricing for their menu items are a little pricey for just a coffee and the food items. I know the workers were over whelmed as the place was packed, so I'm sure the customer service would have been better with a less stressed atmosphere! 

I got the berry toast, which was absolutely amazing! Very sweet and very yummy. I also got the lavender latte, and it was good but not the best lavender latte I have had. I would go here again, but I would go later in the day to avoid the crowd (I went around 1pm on a Sunday) and I would go for their fancy cocktail drinks to try and avoid the morning/brunch coffee time. 

Overall I think this a very good/cute place to go too! defiantly a cute spot to meet for a girls days. But a little overrated and not worth the hype.",5qBTq4XLs-3ch4AxRXXNmg,2,1,4,T9lyLIpMHCwJ1-hRkX1q9A

The cupcake drink tasted pretty good (with an added cupcake bite). The only downside would be that it is a bit pricey. However, what do you expect for a super hip coffee shop in Summerlin? 

I'm also not into taking selfies and whatnot but the customers that come here definitely are. The majority of the customers that I saw were mostly busy trying to get the perfect picture/filter before they even touched their food. It was almost funny to watch because so many people were obsessing over it! So for those of you Instagram lovers - this is your spot

2984938,2018-06-07,0,4fGGeKlUY3SwqLW4SH_QnQ,"This place is more about being Instagram-worthy and less about actual quality. 

I really wanted to like this place. Don't get me wrong, it's an adorable set-up with super cute decor, but if I end up spending $63 on what's essentially toast and bougie tea, I expect more from the supplier. I have no problem dropping cash on something that I deem is worth the price tag, but there is no way I could justify paying as much as I did for the product that was turned out to me at Cafe Lola. 

My friend and I each ordered the Vanilla Rose Latte, which is supposedly a signature drink of theirs. It tasted like water with a very faint essence of rose. Definitely not worth the equivalent of the $12.96 we paid for each drink. I also ordered the Butter Me Up toast, which is basically a single piece of toast with almond butter and some fruit on top. If I'm spending $10.18 on a piece of TOAST, I expect more from what was served to me - maybe thick, artisanal bread that was baked that morning with some kind of garnish on the side. Not something I could've made at home for half the price. 

My friend got the Let's Avocuddle toast, which looked a little more hearty, but still didn't warrant paying $10.56. She also got a salad - that was probably the only thing ordered that we felt the price matched the product. 

For 5 items, the total was $63, and I felt like I flushed my money down the toilet when I paid for it. So absolutely not worth it at all. Again, I have no problem paying that amount if the product that was turned out matched in quality, and this was far from it. Basically, if all you care about is Insta-worthy food and drinks, this is your place. I'd personally suggest saving your money for a place that turns out a more quality product for your dollar.",5QPmrdWD3AFpubIq1sgTlQ,5,1,1,hd7TAFh9mBkFKGcTDMbRVg

When I entered, the place was packed but luckily a group just left so there was an empty table. 
Although there is a wall menu, the employee gave me a paper menu. She was pretty nice by the way.
They offer coffee, tea, wine, champagne, baked goods, and food. 
I ended up ordering the 20 oz Matcha frappé (over $7 with tax) and the 5 macarons in a box ($14).
The drink actually tasted like a blended, unsweetened soy milk. I did the like the whip cream on top though. The macarons were soft and delicious. My favorite would probably be the raspberry flavored.

We shared a few things to see what all we may like we started with the Beauty and the Beet salad and the Berry Delicious toast, my best friend had the lemon tart and my two year old had a vegan sprinkled donut. She had a matcha and I had a peach tea, everything we ate was perfect. I'm not even sure if the in house made gelato is on the menu yet, but it was SO good and refreshing. It also shows the business even though in its infancy is working hard to continue to evolve and serve its customers. It was a beautiful quiet morning and it was pretty busy on a week day. The owners were there, interacting with customers like family. You can tell they work hard and love what they do. I did see a tip that this is not a good place for kids, let me note... we were responsible enough to call ahead and bring our own personal booster seat ( there isn't a changing table in the bathroom) but maybe soon they'll have booster seats, I don't see high chairs in their future but that could come too perhaps. 

I'm going to say as a mom of a very well behaved & potty trained two year old if you don't have a child who would sit quietly or use soft voices  during a 1-2 hour movie in a theater or you wouldn't take them to the smith center for a show... probably save this special cafe for adult outings BUT there were a couple of other moms who walked in with their daughters (under 5) and they all behaved and it was sweet to see how something so beautiful like this restaurant brought so many people out to enjoy their cafe, predominantly women and couples. Even some ordered at the counter and left (because you can always enjoy the great food & drinks at home with kids of all ages among the chaos right?) haha 


If you came here for a work meeting it's quiet, if you came here on a Date it's chic, if you came here for lunch it's delicious and you'll be glad you stopped by... but I was blown away by their hospitality and will be back.

The service here is impeccable and the staff offers suggestions at every turn. They treat the customers with prestigious and are so polite. I decided to have the tea latte. Wow this was amazing and made my taste buds flip around on my tongue.

This cafe offers vegan menu and even donuts that are vegan too. I had one of the rainbow sprinkles donuts and it pairs nice with the tea latte too. The donut is too pretty to even eat I feel, but I managed to consume it. The donuts was magical.

4352259,2018-05-31,1,4fGGeKlUY3SwqLW4SH_QnQ,"We went to Cafe Lola since I've followed them for so long on Instagram waiting for them open. It's a cute cafe decked out in millennial pink, and honestly, I'm a sucker for anything that is themed well. The owners were there helping run food orders and generally checking up on people. 


We went on a weekend before a large rush, and grabbed a few drinks and food. For the price, it's kind of expensive for what you get. I got the vanilla rose latte with macadamia milk and a croissant. My bill was closer to $18-20. My friends got a toast and charcuterie plate, and it was pretty pricey.

The vanilla rose latte comes with a macaron which isn't too bad of a deal, but it's definitely not worth $12. They do put rose petals on the top of the foam which is a nice touch. The latte itself was kind of watery, but I think that might have to do with the macadamia milk. Since it's not real milk, it doesn't get the nice, fluffy foam you usually get with whole milk. The latte still didn't have a ton of flavor. It's okay, but it's not great.

The toast and charcuterie plate were really good, but definitely not worth the price. I might get the toast again if I'm feeling zesty, but as for the charcuterie plate, I can probably get it somewhere else for a better deal.

Overall, Cafe Lola is a nice, cute cafe to hang out with your friends and chit chat. The staff are friendly, and the owners were there to help out with orders. It made for a good experience overall. I wouldn't say this place is the best in terms of value and flavor for your food, but at the same time, it's a great place to enjoy the company of your friends and family.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,8,6,4,XU4PsWqHdQGVerVet7ZUlw
4458856,2018-06-10,0,4fGGeKlUY3SwqLW4SH_QnQ,"This place gives off the ultimate ""fancy brunch"" vibes. A cute modern little cafe that serves more than traditional coffee. For starters, they're doing great! Especially with their advertising; however there are some kinks that still need to be worked on. 

Although their products are picture perfect. The tastes aren't quite there yet. I ordered a lavender latte where I could taste a bit of lavender here and there, but ultimately... it just tasted watery. Similar with the iced vanilla latte we ordered. 

Also, the staff and menu don't advertise the great machine that creates the adorable designs on the lattes. I think maybe giving the customers an option that could improve the place up a bit. 

The menu is however on the pricer side. Like don't get me wrong good quality products don't come cheap. But I don't think that the signature featured drink should be a vanilla latte with rose petals that's $12. I mean if it had some alcohol in it then maybe it'd attract the audience even more... And after my 2 watery drinks i'm a bit relieved that I didn't try out the signature latte. 

It also gets fairly busy here, and there are rarely any spots. I suggest coming in the morning on a weekday to beat the rush, and since many are normally at work. There's not much seating and it is fairly warm inside. 

The staff is great, they're all friendly and dressed in theme attire. It's like walking into a little france cafe. They are all extremely attentive towards detail. TRUST ME. We went when there was a special event, so they reserved the entire wall with the signature cafe lola neon sign. 

The staff literally were shuffling back and forth during our entire visit just to move tables by a centimeter. Kinda sucked since they ended up in the background of ALL of our photos :/// And since the tables were reserved we weren't able to take any other great pictures with the cafe lola sign and the floral walls.",9teqovwDI0r7m1M-f5eq5w,0,0,4,2qjgwu8AgyZWf_X6sVHnyA

We started our experience there today by being scolded that my friend had her small service animal with her, and then proceeded to get glared at by the owner sitting at a table on her laptop.

The cafe is so cute inside, kind of poorly laid out though, there's nowhere to really line up and order without encroaching on someone else's personal space. 

For my meal I ordered the Secret Garden toast, the passionfruit jasmine black tea, and a vegan donut to-go. It came out to almost $20! $4 for a ""tall"" sized cup of tea and $10 for ONE piece of toast. Completely flavorless toast at that. I would understand these prices if I was somewhere on the strip, but this place is on a random street corner in Summerlin. The prices are absolutely ABSURD. My meal probably cost them $2 to make.

The shop is adorable! Like seriously so cute and comfortable.  I worry that it didn't seem laptop friendly though.  I was thinking maybe the BGHS kids would meet up after school and do homework while sipping on a latte and munching on some avo toast or a macron. 

But let's get to the coffee/espresso drinks.  The hubs and I both had iced lattes that were really good.  Only complaint I have is that they need to have a simple syrup available to customers to sweeten their own drink.  All amazing coffee spots have a sugar/milk ""bar"" with a liquid sugar (easier to stir) and milk choices.  They do offer milk alternatives but no oat milk just yet. I did mention it to our barista and she looked at me like I was a bit cray cray.  Seriously oat milk is HUGE on the east coast and it's slowly popping up around Vegas.  

Anyway, drinks and snacks we had were great.  I did feel our 2 lattes were rather expensive coming in at over $12 for both.

We had come around 3:00 and the place wasn't too busy which was great. We tried ordering two different drinks but apparently they were out? I have never been to a cafe before that runs out of ingredients 3 hours before they close. Instead, we had ordered the hazelnut latte, a blueberry muffin, and a summer peach iced tea. The hazelnut latte had no flavor and it was a little ridiculous for it to be classified as a ""specialty latte."" I was also shocked that all their coffee was served in togo cups. Most people enjoy drinking their coffee from actual coffee cups especially when dining at a upscale cafe. I personally think that their pastries could really use some work. They were quite bland and they easily fell apart.

The owners/managers were all on their computers at different tables and barely looked up.  The barista/cashier did greet us, but we just felt that it would be a nice touch for the owners to show a little welcome as they just opened.  The coffee was just ok, and for almost $3 for a cup it seemed a little pricey.  Also, the coffee was not strong enough.  The blueberry muffin, although good, was too pricey... almost $5.
