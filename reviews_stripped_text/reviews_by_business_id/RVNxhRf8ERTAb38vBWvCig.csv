I got a Ruby Cheeseburger with cheddar cheese, fries, and a small drink. It came out to $15 which is ridiculous even for an airport.

The burger itself was average tasting as were the fries. It was extremely greasy, however, to the point where I took my first bite and a gallon of grease hit my shorts (which are now ruined).  Everyone who didn't order the burger (which were two people) had to wait 15 minutes for their order. It was a chicken sandwich and a turkey sandwich so can't see why this would take that much longer.

Also, soda refills were $0.79. If you require people to get their own soda from the soda fountain you should make the refills free.

It's a solid three stars. I almost gave it an email xtra star just for the kool sign they have with a plane and the propeller that spins. Kool sigh and actually one of the reasons we picked the place. 

This restaurant really borders on four stars but I could quite get there. This place has a whole list of just ""ok's"" which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The restaurant served its purpose. Have us an ok meal, with ok service, an ok price, ok surroundings. It was just ok. More of a good ok instead of a bad ok. There just wasn't anything to rise it above three stars. (the sign is super kool though.)

The place was pretty crowded, and was not dirty but not real clean either it was ok clean. I didn't see anyone cleaning. But I have to admit it was crowded enough keeping it properly would be a challenge for sure.

I paid, squeezed through the crowd at the self serve drink fountain, sat and almost immediately had the food brought over to the table... almost before I had time to put the service number in the holder.

The egg was real, plenty of American cheese, and fairly crisp bacon.  I got tired of the stale roll halfway through the sandwich, and used the bottom of the other half as a plate to eat the egg, cheese, and bacon off of.

We sat down to have a drink or two before our flight and even ordered some food from the restaurant. I myself personally asked for a water. Stephen poured a foamed over beer for my friend that leaked all over the bar. I grabbed some extra napkins and cleaned it up myself. He then makes a drink for my other friend which he immediately after fills a glass of water for me and we get an order of Ruby Rings. He puts the ring order in and turns around and looks back to me. Stephen asks if I want anything besides a water. I said not right now. He then quickly replies, ""You can't sit at the bar if you don't order something."" (Mind you... it's a completely empty bar) My friend replies, ""He ordered the rings"" to be followed by a quick rebuttal from Stephen as he turns back to the computer and says ""So that's how you're going to play it"". We asked him to cancel the rings and close us out. None of this makes sense to a couple of guys being in the hospitality industry, one of us being a successful restaurant owner for over 10 years and in the hospitality industry for much longer than that, and myself being a bartender/manager. Stephen clearly doesn't belong in this industry and is a very poor reflection on Ruby's Diner.

I travel to Las Vegas a lot for work and was tired of trying the same thing. One of the good things about this place is that it has a big menu on the outside that you can look at before you even enter. They have a good selection of food to choose from. I saw that they had a burger that could be substituted with a veggie pattie so I ordered it. The cashier seemed to be new and had to ask for help a couple times with customers that were ahead of me. She also had trouble communicating with the customers. It seemed as if English was her second language and that no doubt contributed to the issue. That gave me time to think of the best way to say my order so that she understood. As I waited I looked around the diner. It was clean and provides a great place to sit and eat your meal away from the crowd of people passing by outside. It was relaxing and you could forget that you were even in an airport.

I have eaten at many Ruby's diners before and rather than choke down a pretzel dog or parhaps some other fast food we decided to sit and have a burger.  

This location has a ""dine in"" area where you are waited on and then a counter area where you order, find a seat and then they bring the food out to you.  We chose the dine in area except nobody was st the getting desk.  After about 6 minutes and watching several others get frustrated and just go grab a table, we did the same.  They should have someone up there or a sign, even just a post it note that says ""please seat yourself"" but no such luck. 

The food.  The burgers and onion rings are typically always decent here and this visit was no different.  These are not gourmet burgers but are a definite step above most all ""fast food drive through"" burgers.  I would give the food 3.5 to 4 stars for a burger joint. 

The service was ok but the guy would waited on us was just a little.....hmmm...different.  So, between that and the lack of someone up at the entrance I would go with 2.5 to 3 stars.  

The ambiance is that of an airport diner.  No need to elaborate on that.

The only thing is that the fries weren't seasoned at all and left more to be desired :/ They take military discounts and thats always a great thing in my book!  I'm not sure what their ruby sauce is but spoiler alert its a white creamy sauce that reminds me of a less tart mayonnaise  perhaps a tastier version of miracle whip,crOnL6IXzIRxzOO5j8kRSQ,2,1,4,ymBk59n6BVbaiZyRWS7SfQ

Now a veggie patty doesn't have to cook as long a beef patty so I couldn't understand why it took 25 minutes for my food or how how at least 5 different groups of people who ordered after me received there food almost 5 minutes after sitting at a table. I'm not over exaggerating but when you are waiting for your food for awhile, you start to notice your environment more; whose leaving, whose coming, who came and left while I was still sitting. Hmmm, so the moment I go to check on my food is the same moment when it finally gets brought to the table.

Ruby's diner at the McCaren airport is none of these.  The eggs came from a box and were cold on our sandwiches, the home fries frozen, the rolls were flavorless and seemed a little stale, and the coffee weak and tasteless.  The menu was very limited to begin with and the only things available to order at the time we were there was one of four choices.  The best part of the stop was the super friendly cashier that took our order.  In fact all the service was excellent.  

I understand that this is airport food, but when paying 33 dollars for two breakfast sandwiches and coffee, I would expect a little better food.",QK2-gfL7ap72EzKEWt5q9g,0,0,3,ECkMkEq2hRH4x_b-LyjoWw

Bad- where do I start. The person dropping off the food was rude, brash and should maybe learn some customer service skills. She's basically dropping food off at tables, acting like she's serving an extended prison sentence. Good example when dropping off our food, I asked if we could have something for the onion rings, she glared at me with (wtf) you want stare lol, ok never mind  I'll eat plain onion rings. For the burger I ordered, was tasteless ( I remember all the food being good last time don't know what happened),

They forgot the tomato :( The bread was cold and soggy and didn't seem very grilled. I also ordered fried zucchini which were good but DAMN... cool those things off before you serve them.

Waitress finally agreed to check my order... After another few minutes, came back and asked for my receipt because the kitchen doesn't believe that they missed an order!  What the?!  So I've been sitting here for 20 minutes with a fake number trying to get a free meal??  I'm at the airport, I clearly can afford the plane ride, but hey maybe I wanted to trick Ruby's into giving me a free egg sandwich... I guess you never know!! What a way to treat your customers!!Luckily I had to expense my meal and kept my receipt. After providing proof I had paid I was finally brought my sandwich, no apologies, just a sob story of how she had to fight with that kitchen staff. Food was mediocre at best, I guess I should just be thankful I got it?

I wouldn't order again but I will return to the diner next month and try something else.

Ill say that maybe i've had alot of good burgers in the mean time I guess but i wasn't all that impressed with the burger. Maybe its because they have to crank out a ton at the airport so they skimp on quality, but I remember them being much better. 

I will say that the onion rings were gigantic and will most likely kill you, but they looked delicious.

Granted there is only one drawback to this little dinette.... the price. But then again.... ladies and gentleman of the traveling public, it's an airport, your a captured audience, so prepared to spend a little more then you should for that meal, it's just the way it's got to be.

For starters, we ordered drinks. The waitress never brought our drinks to us.  We had to ask the bartender for them, which they weren't even made yet.  We didn't even get any water brought over to us. We had to ask for them too.  My wife ordered the pomegranate mojito which looked okay. I tried to order the American Mule, but they said they didn't have any ginger beer and haven't had any since she's been there.  The waitress questioned why it was still on the menu. I then ordered the Southbound flight drink.  They didn't have cilantro for the drink, so they improvised.  It was nasty and had sent it back.  I then just settled for a vodka/ cranberry.
Next was the food. She ordered the BLTA (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado) sandwich.  It was okay. I ordered the clam chowder with onion rings.  The waitress gave me the option to have in a bread bowl or regular bowl. I said bread bowl, but they didn't have it. And she didn't tell me until she delivered my food.  My clam chowder tasted like it came out of a can.  It was bland, and not worth $9 for the bowl.  
It also seemed like the waitress knew that we weren't happy with our order.  She would look at our direction and even walk past us and not ask whether we were enjoying our meal or not. They weren't busy and there were many empty tables, so I know it wasn't that.
