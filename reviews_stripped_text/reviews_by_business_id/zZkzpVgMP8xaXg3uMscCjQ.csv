Imagine making major vacay plans to go to Las Vegas. And include in your vacay planning to go to some of the major, upscale restaurants on the strip, including top named chef restaurant. Imagine securing reservations and how much you were going to enjoy rubbing elbows with the best and exciting your tastebuds with something new.

Now....

On the first day in Vegas, we dropped into a pizza place and picked up something to tide us over. I'd never heard of this place, and I was excited to be able to make my own pizza.

Long story short, we ate here as many times as we could. And even cancelled our last night reservations to make our own pizza.  We walked the strip exciting our tastebuds with our own creations.",eWsV7VL_W04mzavmQCHpRQ,0,0,5,yGM3TDxpjrw55k793BZ1EA

The customer service is excellent....consistently excellent....staff is so polite they stand out among other Las Vegas businesses.  

Then there's the choices....thin crust or regular....the offering of a thin crust means I can visit here more often than once a century....it's just enough crust to hold together all the goodness on top; then you choose the sauce, 4 options including a flavorful organic tomato option; then the cheese options including feta; then the veggies including fresh herbs, sun dried tomatoes, and pineapple; then the meats, including chicken and bacon bits...3 minutes to cook and fresh, crispy, yumminess awaits.  

There is of course the wide selection of beers by the electronic beer tap system which is pretty cool...u r bound to find a nice complement to your pizza and/or salad....I forgot to mention the salads available made of the same fresh quality, ingredients.  One thing I would like to see is a wider selection of wines...there is only 1 white & 1 red....both r fine but my wine lovers get jealous of all the beer options.   

All in all well done Pizza Rev and welcome to the neighborhood!",NgNkF0JE2bgF5QpF5xum-A,0,0,5,2pRTX2cH9afjxb9ulmH1IA

The staff at this particular location was amazingly friendly and attentive. I had only ordered a pizza to go and when I declined a drink they offered me a water cup while I was waiting. It was a nice touch for a place that I consider fast food. My only real complaint with the pizza was that I ordered it with extra basil and it seemed to not have that distinct basil flavor.

1241380,2017-12-04,1,zZkzpVgMP8xaXg3uMscCjQ,"This is your classic build-your-own pizza place, but PizzaRev has perfected this craft. They are always rolling out dough and have them ready to go, so the wait time from making to getting your prepped pizza is only 10-15 minutes. They have a plethora of toppings among the sauces, cheeses, veggies, and meats. My go-to is regular dough, original tomato sauce, mozzarella, roasted garlic, onions, basil, fresh tomatoes, fennel sausage, and Italian sausage (and extra of it). The pizza crust is thin and crispy, the cheese is gooey, and both sausages were flavorful. The fennel sausage is my particular favorite, where the fennel is very apparent and is not used sparingly in the sausage bits. The veggies are fresh and adds extra flavor to the pizza, with the onion giving an extra crunch to the entire pizza. The roasted garlic adds a slight sweet and nuttiness to the pizza. 

Another plus about PizzaRev is their beer tap. It's like an adult slushie machine, where you are free to get whatever beer you want at whatever time you choose (as long as you have the bracelet stating you are of age to drink and can pay for what you get). 

In addition, PizzaRev also is able to do fundraisers for any event and have a quick turn around in helping you set this up. They only need about a week or two to set this up. I personally had a fundraiser done by them, and within 9 days, everything was set up for it.

Overall my experiences with PizzaRev has always been good. It's a great place to get a fresh, cheap pizza the way I want and they are always welcoming to all their guests.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,2,5,uDWuAXnU7bDcBegK2wHRGg

They have so many options for the crust but I always stick to the thin crust. It's so good and no extra charge. I love their choices of toppings. The artichoke hearts are so good and I have to get the ricotta cheese. Sometimes I go unhealthy and get the Alfredo sauce. I love it.
On Tuesdays it's only $6 for a pizza! And the pizza is a pretty big size. I can barely eat a whole one, it's really filling. It's a great deal and even on other days prices are good.

He has a great spirit and you can tell he loves what he does. He is very personable and does great. Every time I come in there his energy gives me life. Now today! I appreciate Eric, Justin and I think her name was Cherise for keeping their composure as they dealt with a difficult nurse that works in the same complex. She was very unprofessional and kept putting her hands through her hair and then draping her hands over the food. I had to speak up on their behalf because that is nasty. I commended them on handling the nurse, the other customers, and us with care and I appreciate that they did not break. I would have gone off on her continuing to put her hands in her hair and then drop them over the protective glass and possibly have her hair in peoples food.  That was unacceptable for a nurse and hope she reads this post because she knows better. Thank you Pizza Rev, for keeping the professionalism and allowing us to take care of it. I know she heard me say that this glass was to protect the food and she even made an attempt to give you compliments after I said something commending you all on your composure. That let me know she was being a complete asshole just because she could. Thomas you are great and you have great co workers as well... I know when people are taking advantage, and I dislike people that think they can use people however they want. It won't be when I'm around.

Pizza Rev is perfect when you're dining solo but craving pizza and have no self-control or when your dining companion has incompatible pizza preferences. The size is just a bit more than a single meal and they have all sorts of customization options. I tend to stick to spicy sauce and spicy pepperoni, mix mozz and feta, then shake up the veggies and drizzle on some pesto every now and then. 

This particular location stands out in two additional ways: their taproom area (self-serve beers and wines) and their staff (extraordinarily friendly).

Dining room is laid out a little diffrent then the rainbow location. Maybe a lil smaller. They have a self seve beer wall. I enjoyed that and found it to be unique and fun. I had a Thi pizza the special posted. It tasted as good as it looked. I added garlic. My friend made his own pizza also came out really good. All the staff seemed to still be grasping what was going on. Its grand opening. I understand. Everyone was super friendly and nice made sure we got what we wanted on our pizza. It was a little choatic. We decided to try the beer wall. Great selection of beers!! We really enjoyed able baker saiason. The local selection was awesome and had a lot of beers we just wanted to try. Instead if drinking a whole beer. My only complaint about the beer wall is its not dialed in. It is new. While I was there though one customer vocalized exactly what I was thinking to the manger. I had two beers probably also a half beer in samples.  The beer is under a lot of pressure or my beers had not been poured in a minute. I work behind a bar I pour beer for a living fyi. My beer tab came to $19. That was a lil less then satisfactory. Like the gentleman before vocalized. Makes me feel like you pay for a good bit of the foam that comes out first. There should be an attendant or a delay. Its should also be noted that you are really only allowed two beers. So if you pour half a beer of foam sampling beers take that into consideration  you will have to walk up to the counter and talk to staff ( who I assume make sure your not drunk) to get another beer. Food was great , staff and manger was friendly and trying their hardest. Hope the beer process gets streamlined. Lil annoying to get a wrist band,  and have to re charge it / talk to staff. There also was no line for this procedure so your kinda intrupting check out and payment for guest who have no beer. 

Friendly suggestion place a busser and the beer wall and reccomend they assume the sale of pouring. When no one is around they can clean. It would be nice if we could acess the cold glasses as customers without bothering staff.  Tables absolutely need numbers for orders and little sign that says still eating  or badges example sweet tomatoes. We had our table taken twice. Not a big deal you guys where slammed.

Once you're done, you go up to the register and pay for what you drank (they charge by the ounce).  My only complaint about this is, they really didn't have much more than a large selection of hoppy beers, and I'm not a big fan of the pungent ones. 

If you want a sub par pizza (my opinion) by all means, go check this place out. But if you're a pizza lover like us, and don't think that Domino's is the best pizza around, your only saving grace is the self serve taps I'm afraid. We won't be going back unfortunately.",1oV4mY3GnNOZmGq8IYYL1w,0,0,3,g_3NOgacRO4brmu6rPybsA

4107039,2017-11-15,2,zZkzpVgMP8xaXg3uMscCjQ,"$6 Rev Tuesdays, yo.

PizzaRev isn't the best customizable pizza chain, but it's the cheapest on one particular day of the week. I'm always willing to wait around for Tuesday, and until now, it's always been a quick drive to one near my home. On this Tuesday, however, I was on the Strip with a friend, and he reacted eagerly when I brought up the idea, so we dropped in for a late dinner.

I was surprised that there were barely any other customers inside, and that's in absolute terms, not just relative to the massive, open-plenum dining room and reasonable, fenced-in outdoor patio. I know it's a weekday, the weather is finally cooling, and the location is not really on the Strip, but I figured that it's central enough that it would be more well-trafficked than it was.

End result: it ended up being one of the fastest pizza line experiences in recent memory because we (1) barely had anybody in line ahead of us and (2) the employees were fast and not perpetually hesitant like most of the Henderson PizzaRev folks seem to be.

Unless you're boring and willing to settle for their preset topping combos, you're gonna want to go wild to get the most out of your money. Start with the signature thin crust ($7.99 normally, and goes down to $6.00 on Tuesdays) unless you want to pay a $1.30 premium for double dough or gluten-free. Afterward, slowly walk down the line as they ask for your desired ingredients in this order: sauce (they'll mix sauces if desired, but I'm usually fine with just one), cheese, veggies, and meats (an odd switcheroo from the meats-then-veggies order of Henderson and of other chains). Then pay and either wait for a to-go order or find yourself a seat.

I experienced some mixed surprises at this point. The pleasant surprise was that an employee actually brought the post-oven pizzas over to our table, rather than calling us to the counter to pick up the dine-in orders as I've seen in other similar stores. The unfortunate surprise was that they were entirely out of their PizzaRev-branded sauces save for Jalapeño. Where are the Mango Bonney or Chipotle sauces that would've elevated my bites? What about something like Peach Vidalia or Datil Pepper or even the dreaded Ghost Pepper? No? Well, I wasn't feeling the urge to toss on some Cholula or Sriracha, so I ultimately passed.

Fortunately, they did have the pesto drizzle which I've found to be a near-staple (you may wanna ask before the end of the line about this, due to their unusual level of service), as well as some dried oregano and plenty of chili pepper flakes. These played well enough with my sufficiently crispy cracker-esque crust, (mildly) spicy red sauce, array of cheeses (mozzarella, bleu, and ricotta for me), and copious amounts of veggies and meats to make the pizza a satisfying meal.

I should add a couple more notes on their downsides, lest the insufficient sauce supply wasn't enough to justify the downgrade. Most importantly to newbies, they had zero labels for anything beyond the sauce. It was an issue for my friend, but fortunately, I'm so experienced that I don't just recognize toppings on sight, but also (probably) can recite my typical order by memory. The other concern, a nitpick at best, is that they might be just a tad less generous on toppings than at least the Henderson location; maybe they're used to people like me? I'll have to pay more attention if I can so that I can ask for a 1.5x or double helping of one or two things.

PizzaRev is an awesome chain on Tuesdays, and they're not too shabby on other days of the week. I've got work tomorrow, so I'll have to come back to this unique location when I have a better opportunity to try the self-serve taproom (pricing determined with the aid of RFID or NFC or whatever fancy tech they have in those wristbands). I probably will continue to breeze past the Craft Your Own salads, but maybe you won't?",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,6,4,j63LnhvJF-CUUBKnMXrPwg
4147035,2017-07-20,0,zZkzpVgMP8xaXg3uMscCjQ,"This is only the second PizzaRev location I have tried and it stands out compared to the other. It is larger and more open to start with. It also is a taproom. That means rather than just a few select bottles beers behind the counter, you can pour your own beer from a bevvy of taps on the wall in the 21 and older section. Sadly I was not able to experience that on my visit today. I came in on my lunch break from a job that frowns upon drinking while on the job. But that doesn't mean I didn't take notice. And you best believe I will come back some time I am not on the clock to take full advantage of what this PizzaRev Taproom has to offer.

I stuck with just a pizza today. A standard thin crust with standard tomato sauce and standard cheese. I dressed it up with spicy pepperoni, bacon, olives, MUSHROOMS, basil and roasted garlic. This is close a normal order for me. I know what I like and this embodies that.

I did not dine in today. I took my pizza to go and drove back to my office a few mile away. The pizza was good but would have been better had I eated it hot out of the oven. My biggest complaint was that my pie was left in just a minute too long. I saw the oveb attendant checking it but he took it out to late. The crust was more charred and more crisp than I prefer. That is not to say I didn't enjoy every bite. It was delicious. Just not perfect.

This PizzaRev is across the parking lot from Chick-Fil-A so the lot is packed amd difficult to navigate. But if you make it through that, park and go on in. You can get a good pizza and potentially good beer. Aint nothing wrong with that.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,3,4,dt0GieGa0bVHmWlzF6V9vg

We just left, and the Sunday night staff was just so extremely happy, it blew our minds. They're so genuine, helpful, and customer oriented it was awesome! 

Ordering here is simple, there's a few different dough choices; we opted for the double dough (9.29$) otherwise they have the thin crust (5.99$) I'm not a fan of red sauce, so I did the olive oil, my boyfriend did the organic spicy tomato which was AMAZING!!! When we go back, that's my next choice. Loaded mine with buffalo milk mozzarella, chicken, shrooms, bacon, jalapenos, and spinach. Took a few minutes to cook, and BAM eating time. My nd basically got a meat lovers with cilantro. 

My pizza was phenomenal! Cooked perfect, with crispy crust and so gooey with all that cheese! My bf ate his entire pizza while I was on my 2nd slice, THAT GOOD. 

I love the hot sauce choices here, their cayenne hot sauce has a kick to it, the mango garlic was ok, and the Booney mango was good. 

Their soda machine is pretty amazing and all high-tech!

The food was delicious, but the real reason to go here is the customer service from the crew! They were just so happy! I love them, they're seriously amazing!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,24,18,5,qHLZjc8LLQylSKV53hLhNA

I was prompted to go because our volunteer clinic had a fundraiser here. They give 20% back to your organization, so it's great if you're looking to do some fundraising!

I got the double crust margherita pizza with sausage on top. They said the double crust is supposed to rise a little more and have more bite to it. It is an extra charge, so be aware of that if you want the double crust.

When I got my pizza, it was still really thin. I couldn't see a big difference between the regular crest and double crust. I feel like I paid an extra dollar or two for about 0.5mm extra crust which isn't all that great. The size of it is okay. A little small in my opinion because since it's thin crust, you can end up eating about 1.5 pizzas before being full. I didn't leave full. I had to supplement my pizza with some Chik-fil-A across the way.

The flavor of it is pretty good. They hand rip the basil so when you smell your pie, you just get this huge waft of warm, fragrant basil and man, I think I fell in love a little bit there. The cheese was just right. Not too much, but not too stingy with the cheese.

Overall, PizzaRev is a good place for lunch with a few friends, but I didn't leave full. If you're coming with about 3-4 people, you're probably best getting the $40 deal that comes with drinks, pizzas, and a dessert pizza. It'll probably be enough to get you nice and satiated.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,2,1,4,U79rhWQ0y4i16Y9zh8Q2qQ

They have a line of different meats, toppings, & sauces if you decide to build your own.  After you have your pizza set they throw it in a open fired oven to cook.

They also have salads if you decide you want to go the healthier route.  I've tried the chicken Cesar salad which is really good mainly because the chicken isn't just cubed defrosted chicken, it's actual chicken that's been chopped up!",eo775Ge7MXWqqHpOBDI5IQ,2,1,5,uXsGndm_ZpHxgqT6u3Oi2Q

We were informed that the coupon was not valid on Tuesdays because they offer $2 off on Tuesdays.... I pointed out that this qualifier was not printed on the coupon and received a shrug. We felt scammed by the bait & switch tactic and ate elsewhere. They must not need the $$$ of the neighborhood.",l_evb28R9tee2slynDY2nQ,2,0,1,eKf32K7ixq_E4OYz6W_KTw

There is a beer area that I haven't tried but have heard it is pretty good. Seeing it in action looked like a fun experience too. My only complaint is the ranch taste less like ranch and more like a caesars dressing. 
Overall a fun and tasty pizza joint bound to please pizza lovers.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,0,0,4,7erqL3mP8HI2ZVlriC8frA

There also happens to be a wall of 'pour your own' draft beer. Unique concept!!!!  Coming back.",YuWUrq-TA-QW_EC30FFaKg,3,1,5,uWRIs-379T2Z68EYnp9w4Q

Was not trained properly then we call the manager to see what happened because they trying to charge us and then he was very very not professional he

The food here I awesome, the workers and super friendly and offer help and explain how everything works. They also have beer and wine on tab. I loved the sauce on my pizza, it's very rich with flavor. The only downside to this place is they only had one white wine on tab, and if your drinking from the beer or wine tab, you can only pay with card. I only had cash, and we had $100 bill which they didn't have change for. Understandable about not having change. Those are the reasons for my four star. Other than that, it was great.",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,1,1,4,_4F2QyNkQl7sYtskNlsbXw

It starts baking while you pay. If they're not too busy, will bring the pizza to you. As the place gets busier, they'll call out your name for you to pick up. Love the crust, so light and crispy. Toppings were fresh. Self-serve beer taps are handy, once you figure out that you have to hold your wristband up against the receiver to be able to pour. Friendly staff and a very clean establishment. We'll be back!",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,0,0,4,1mCE4CTuYKhhVMP_CgvtFg
