60366,2012-09-11,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"Let me start off by saying this review is for people who don't particularly like Asian cuisine, but are forced to come here due to some type of obligation. 

The place is decked out in bright red Asian decor, with a lit up waterfall flowing in the background.

I came here with a group celebrating an important occasion, and the guest of honor chose this place. I was a little skeptical after hearing the name, but there was plenty here for those who don't enjoy this type of food. Even though we were seated for teppanyaki style dining, I ordered the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki with fried rice. The black truffle and teriyaki sauce added a very good flavor to what was a pretty ordinary piece of meat. Also, I didn't think rice could be this good: adding eggs and seasoning to it, really made this side a nice surprise.   

While I was a little shocked at first about the prices, the decor and the chef's performance at the table helped to ease my pain....The delicious food helped too.",kt2XfOVLakufrMxXqzGyjw,0,0,4,Llg-Y0iCw59vG9WlMqvC1g

168390,2015-07-13,4,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"Dear Steve Wynn - 
If I could say piss off to your face, I would.  We dined at SW steak on Thursday night, we were appropriately attired in the request "" no shorts policy"" - we were shocked as we walked in as there were quite a few shorts and strollers.  But we had a fantastic dinner at SW steak.  BUT AS WE WERE SEATED AT SW STEAK - they seated a whole table of professional basketball players in shorts and bubble jackets a table away from us.  THUS when we had our reservations at Mizumi we thought business shorts and polo shirt would be acceptable. HELL NO!  They refused to seat, accept at the bar (even though they had a stroller behind the bar) and a guy walking around in ripped jeans and a shirt that qualified him as homeless.  They sat at us the bar and then charged us for rolls we didn't eat and then we called for the managers and pointed out the stroller behind the bar and the homeless looking guy and the in discrepancies of the resort dress code and policy - he said he would have to look into it. We paid $150 in rolls we didn't eat at the bar.  Worst birthday weekend of my life.  Never going back to Wynn no matter how that manager handled it.  He could have quietly seated us -especially considering we spent over $700 at SW steak two tonight's before hand.  But this guy basically said Sorry..
 We finished at delmonicos - who had no problem with my boyfriends dress.  Needless to say never,ever, ever go back to Mizumi. 

Unless you are a professional sports player or celebrity - don't bother - they treat you like garbage!

Not going to say they are racist - but going to highly imply it!

BTW - Steve Wynn - you owe me $10.19 in an uncashed voucher that I refuse to redeem as I refuse to enter your horrid resort after my experience at Mizumi.  That is on top of the sushi rolls that I never ate but paid $140 for!!!!

Piss off Mizumi!  Hopefully you get better management!",VY8fUQEUoYvxQ2fHsuDOLg,2,2,1,CCjVPy0Me0CyCIOEyMdo2Q
176333,2014-02-17,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,I have eaten at many fine Japanese restaurants all over the United States.  Without question this is the most overpriced worst of all time.  We are at the hibachi portion of the restaurant.  The shrimp appetizer were the baby shrimp you find in a salad.  The cheapest of the cheap.  They mix them with greens.  After they're cooked they are so small you need a magnifying glass to find them. It was so unappetizing.  They then cooked the main course and because vegans were at the table they served them before cooking our steak.  They offer two steaks sirloin and tenderloin.  The waitress warned me the sirloin was tough to chew.  I ordered it medium rare.  It was impossible to chew as I had to spit it out. It was $70 for the poorest quality of meat ever.  My companion ordered steak and sea bass for $95.  The sea bass was not but rather some cheap fishy tasting clone.  The quality of this food rivaled Golden Coral.  The price at this sorry excuse for a restaurant is triple the highest price Japanese restaurant.   The waiter was not friendly and does not put on a show like other Japanese restaurants.  Even the salad was bad and without ginger dressing.  In all honesty McDonalds would have been a step above.   Avoid at all costs.  Just a tourist ripoff,JCbPBhub1GPiY8Ba--x6vg,0,0,1,tP99UpzdLeBa311E7B68UA

We had nice drinks at the bar. But 15 minutes after our reservation I had to prod the hostess to seat us. Only then did we get seated, and I saw other groups come in and get seated right away. My reason for knocking off a star.  

The food was delicious. We sat in the main dining room and ate off the menu. The sushi rolls were fresh and flavorful. The Udon soup was very good and the Black Cod was the best I have ever had (sorry Zuma - you've been beat). The service was excellent. Kudos to our waiter. And the sommelier helped us choose an excellent bottle of Sake.

I think this restaurant serves the best Japanese food
in this country so far.

We ordered nigiri, rolls, robata yaki and so on.
Everything was great. Their chawanmushi was okay, but 
I would give them a credit for just having this not-so-major-dish 
on their menu.

They have their own tea collection which is $30 per pot. 
Since I grew up with the real Japanese tea in Japan,
I did not find their tea so special to be $30 but this is the only
thing I can think of as something negative.
Otherwise the food, service, view, and the decoration of the 
restaurant was all phenomenal.",jrtm6gbELRV6L8bF2qf9YQ,1,0,5,JkSxaS0EGDbYYH0gPSogdg

We had the edamame, then the plate of all raw fishes (about 6 types) and one Philadelphia roll. We each had a cocktail and for desert we shared the spiced pear thing. I thought the fish was fresh and not ""fishy"" and I found the rice on the roll to be much better than most rice I've ever tasted. The desert was a little bland in my opinion, although it was pretty interesting and looked cool on the plate. You aren't going to get full in a place like this, but if you're wearing a tight dress and don't want to stuff yourself and want a romantic place to have dinner, this place is perfect.

First of all , i am fine with someone refusing service as long as they do it in a polite manner. However, she did the complete opposite , she insulted us and she bullied my 15 year old sister calling her ugly and thats not even half of it. She refused service because my 5 year old brother was not wearing ""pants"" even though he was wearing pants!! This lady is racist and rude. 

After she basically kicked us out i went to the hotel manager to complain i told them this is not 5 star quality service , i would not accept this neither would anyone else , the manager was not there, however , the front desk manager was and other staff members who were shocked of her behavior and saw my little brother and called her and I quote "" ridiculous and crazy"" .

348759,2012-12-27,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"We picked this restaurant for our ""fancy night out"" in Vegas and were not dissapointed.

We ordered the vegetable tempura to start and although the service was SLOW (30 minutes for an app!) they comped the food for us, so that was an added bonus!

One of the reasons we picked the restaurant is because it has an entire vegan menu, that is really hard to find on the strip!

I got the vegan chick'n roll and fall seasonal roll- both amazing and probably some of the best high-end vegan food I have had.

My boyfriend got the Mizumi roll which was A LOT of lobster! Even though the rolls are around $15-$20 each, you get 8 big pieces with each.

We also got a comped dessert of mochi ice cream which was really, really good too!

We ordered a few skewers from their BBQ style food and while they were great, they are much smaller than you will expect.  I hear skewer, and I think summer Kabob.  This is like a long toothpick with a few bites on it.  The prices are very reasonable, so it's worth it as the meat is awesome, but just be prepared, haha.  

As for sushi, we had their $45 surf and turf roll.  Honestly, the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life.  If it wasn't $45, I would have probably ordered 2 more instead of anything else.  Well worth giving it a try if you like Waygu and Lobster.  

Overall - I will definitely be back, even if its just to share a roll and have a drink.  Cool place, excellent food.",hn_Tlzhqm2z-OBgEsJ-rew,0,0,5,hs73d993hBTfYWkoDQ9QeQ
404311,2013-06-21,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"My wife and I recently dined at Mizumi, while on a short stay at the Wynn, and I'd like to share the experience. The ambiance, while understandably over the top (this is Las Vegas after all), was duly charming, with a large waterfall serving as an impressive backdrop to the dining experience. 

We started with an expensive Toro tartar, topped with a very small amount of osetra caviar and edible gold leaf (pretty!) which was well presented, and generally enjoyable, although at $45 I would not order it again. We then ordered an assortment of sushi, including yellowfin tuna, mackerel, albacore and so on, and that's where things went wrong. At best, the fish, while reasonably well cut, was a touch ""dry"" and certainly less than impressive.The flavors were somewhat subdued, and the preparation below what should be a relatively high standard, given the prices. In some cases, the use of Wasabi seemed excessive, hindering rather than enhancing. The rice itself was adequate, but nothing more. 

The service, in all fairness, was courteous and professional. We were seated promptly and treated well throughout. Had the sushi risen above mere mediocrity, my review would have been far more positive, but it did not. Please note that it is only the sushi that shaped my opinion.

I'm not versed in the world of high end cow, but appearantly it was only released to limited restaurants.  We lucked out.   It was served thinly sliced,  almost sushi like.

I come to Vegas a few times a year and have eaten at many of the higher end restaurants with this being a place I wish never to return to.  I figured it would be a safe bet since we were attending Le Reve after dinner.  My sister and I sat on the Teppan side and I have had better and less expensive meals at smaller chains and even Benihana.  The view of the waterfalls were pretty, especially at night.  The service was ok, our server was friendly..  but the meal...  Ugh!  My sister chose the tofu and gardein meal while I chose the chicken.  The meal was so incredibly salty, it was almost inedible.  I think we each drank 3 glasses of water and didn't even finish or get close to finishing our meal.  The chicken was so overlooked, it was almost dry and difficult to eat unless you dipped in a sauce or drank a gulp of water after. I heard the tofu and gardein were cooked well, but again VERY salty.  I have had a variety of good and bad meals at Teppan restaurants and for $65, I expect that you are not going to mess up a chicken breast.  I can do that at home for about $7.  The vegetables were cooked well, but again, a bit on the salty side.  The only bright side to this meal was the dessert.  The little gelato with crumble was delicious.  The little lemon cheesecake was ok..  Nothing special. It took forever for someone to clear our plate and I am assuming this was because our plates were nearly full.  I remember the chef's name but I am not going to be mean and call him out because he was a nice guy who was a bit on the entertaining side.  I really wish I had decided to go to Carnevino instead...

However, be advised: If you don't like sushi, there's not a lot for you here!! 

A specialty cocktail called the Blue Mizumi was really great. 

Also: the music really doesn't fit the atmosphere at all. They need to be playing something sophisticated, to fit the high price tag and the elegant restaurant. The rock and roll really did detract from our meal, and it brought the experience down a full star.

I'm not sure what to say about this place other than...WOW...

For starters the atmosphere at the Wynn is already ripe with two things:  Money...and money lol.  It has a certain level of sophistication and class that you'd expect from the resort named after the man himself.

Anyway, on to the restaurant.  Had a 7:00pm reso but due to my own timing issues I couldn't get there until 7:15.  Called ahead and no problem, no issues when my friend and I checked in.  Now here is where it could have gone south if they were the type of restaurant that gets annoyed and huffy because I've seen it happen.  You show up late, get a worse table than they would have given you had you been on time etc. etc.  But not here.  We were seated literally one row back from the floor to ceiling window and it was amazing.  The waterfall was the perfect backdrop to the amazing meal and was a big topic of conversation throughout the dinner.

Our server, unfortunately I don't recall his name, was on point.  He wasn't hovering, but didn't annoy us.  He offered information when asked, but wasn't pushy.  He was right there when we needed him and left us alone when we looked like we were chatting.  At almost 2 hours for dinner he didn't seem to mind one bit and was cheerful and friendly throughout the entire meal.

The food.  OMG the food.  Here's a run down of what we had:

Sushi:
Chu Toro
Yellowtail
Eel

Robatayaki:
Jidori chicken
Beef tenderloin

Meal:
Miso Butterfish
Hamachi Kama

I could write pages and pages about how great this is but I'll simplify it and say this:  I'm comparing this Japanese seafood meal I had to that of Alan Wongs, Sam Choi's, Roy's and the like.  Yes, I'm from Hawaii and have had the best of the best here when it comes to seafood and trust me, Mizumi fits right into that list. 

All in all this dinner far exceeded any expectations I had and believe me, my expectations were definitely up there.  Great job Mizumi.  I'll be back again.",LD63ZTE4ARkNV3w-2UkGrg,0,0,5,g2o-v_iTnz6H6uVvHALUxA

It is pricey but the price is so worth it (what do you expect you're at the Wynn so you expect pricey but the best quality!!) Everything we ordered was 5 stars, not one dish was a disappointment.  We started off with the beef tataki and shiromi usuzukuri.  I loved that each piece had their fresh ingredients on each piece of meat and white fish. With my chopsticks I could easily pick up the beef, yama wasabi, frisee and garlic chips dipped in the ponzu, place in my mouth and loved how it just melted in my mouth.  The next course was the mushroom fava bean salad.  This salad turned my husband to a salad lover.  He said if all salads tasted this good he would eat it more often.  All he had to say was , ""wow"".  He would normally let me have the salad, but this case no! I was upset that I had to share this salad. The next course we enjoyed the king salmon sushi and pork belly. Both were small portions ( thank goodness) because we still more food coming.  Both were amazing! The belly melted in your mouth and the king crab makes a sushi roll tastes so much better! I can never go back to eating a California roll with imitation crab! The next dish we tried we were so surprised we liked.  Its called Mentaiko Spaghetti with a poached jidori egg. The sound of the dish didn't sound appetizing but we were told some come to this restaurant specifically for this dish and one person eats two of these in between courses- now I know why! All I know is after my first bite I said this is just amazing! I wanted to keep eating this dish and ask for more! Our entree dishes we ended with the miso black cod and catch of the day! I was so full but the food continued to be amazing!

From our view of the waterfall, great service, a meet and greet with the chef, made it a perfect anniversary! If you are looking for great culinary experience, let Chef Devin cook for you! You won't be disappointed!",A0-og2FYVt8yRdGIh4DS8g,1,1,5,XkohHifJd6XD3qANUjK43w

We went ahead and ordered food and said we were not sure on what we wanted to drink. An hour after that still no sushi or a waiter so we asked the manager for help. He said he would check on it yet we watched him and he never did. About 20 min after that we got our sushi, it was not impressive. We had to ask for our check...

Even plated the same, w/ the empty lobster shell which all adds to the Mizumi experience.  I love when you order a Lobster sushi Roll that you taste lobster!  I highly recommend this and the Beef Tartare.  

Only a part of the menu has changed thankfully!!  I would've been very disappointed if they took away any part of the Okada's picturesque appearance also.  I've been back many times since Okada became Mizumi, but not as a regular like before.  Mainly because my fav sake 'Princess' is no longer on the menu!  It paired so well w/ the fresh fish, which made Okada so unique, their sake list!  Also I like the Uni at a couple of other places better, such as Nobu. 

The breathtaking waterfall, calm and serene indoor-outdoor feel, since the wall-window is completely pushed aside.  Japanese masks right behind the friendly bartenders as you walk in and the sushi bar, teppanyaki area all to the left.  Even the bathroom on the left is nice.  The puffy lights add to the airy Japanese decor.  Love it!!

The Teppanyaki area is absolutely on point and you can order from the regular menu if you are craving something special.

Yuko was my server, prompt, knowledgeable and offered items that made sense when I asked for something lite.  The Robatayaki section offers smaller bites, perfect for that last bite of something like a grilled butternut squash or meat skewers.  

Excellent fresh yellowtail jalapeño and a sommelier for both sake and wine pairings.  The chef's take pride in their work as you can see when your order comes out and by my pix.  Hands down still one of my fav Wynn restaurants.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,9,5,5,gfoCnA5RHouJJAcpT4G-vQ

We came here for a few drinks and a light dish. They had a special mule they were serving which is what I ordered. For a Saturday night, it wasn't that busy at all. Pretty strange considering there was a giant line of people out front waiting to get into the club. I also had the black pepper trustled edema. They brought this out quick and in turn I devoured it quickly. Very good. Buddy had some sushi which I don't eat.

When I arrived I was sat at a table across from the window seats, after I asked to be moved next to the table, they quickly accommodated me.. The service was great, the sommelier was also informative of correcting my mistake ordering a half bottle of wine instead of a full.  I was also able to order a moderately priced ($200-vegas moderate lol) bottle of red wine and enjoyed it.  Moving onto the food. I started with yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno jelly.. This was the best version I have had of this ""common"" sashimi dish. There was so much more to it than other places, especially Nobu. I say this place should make everyone eat this first! Next I ha to enjoy the king crab from the robanyataki. This was a very light, tasty, dish, definitely not filling but extremely satisfying dish. The sommelier had recommend this dish earlier, so we knew it was going to be divine! We also paired the robanyataki mushrooms  during this course as well.  The next course I chose the hot pot soup with a white fish, scallop, prawn and crab. It was very light, not much flavor from other sources besides the seafood and lightly salted. Again, it was small and pricey, but well worth it! Lastly, I had the 1.5lb king crab with ponzu butter sauce.  Out of this world!  The robanyataki infused charcoal flavor paired with the citrus butter was to die for.  It Created such a new and interesting flavor profile I can't even describe it in words, just something I can highly recommend.  Overall, this was a thrilling experience in a Japanese restaurant. I had a much better experience here than over at Nobu in Caesers Palace, and also paid the same amount $400 plus tip for two.

Sure enough in under 5 minutes they had our table ready. It was an unobstructed view abutting the floor to ceiling glass window. Within 1 to 2 minutes of being seated, the waiter came by for our drink order. We each had a cocktail. We started with the meal with an arare roll. Each piece of this cut roll was melt in your mouth delicious. Undoubtedly the best cut roll I have ever had. Next we had the SA plate. This consisted of about 10 pieces of very fresh raw fish, mostly tuna and salmon. Again very fresh and succulent. We finished by getting another cut roll,  the tataki roll. This was very different than anything I have had before. But in a very good way. We were far too full to even look at the dessert menu.

Also, we were in a hurry as we had overslept and we were in and out in less than an hour without even having to rush...super efficient.

Service was on par, very formal, generous qty of staff - we must've had 7-8 unique faces serving our small table throughout the night.  

Writing this on an iPhone so I'll keep it in outline format. 

Atmosphere - top notch, sat with the waterfall view.  Decor is mostly reds and golds with splashes of art in various colors.  

Food - omakase had a wide variety of selections.  I would say it was more of a tasting menu than an omakase.  Nothing blew my mind in terms of freshness or complexity of flavors through simplicity as one would expect from a high end japanese restaurant.  Was good food for sure, but I expected more.  

Service - front end greeting staff were Asians, not sure if this was for appearances of an Asian restaurant or if it was coincidence.  Waiter and sommelier were white.  Very pleasant people but didn't understand Japanese food fundamentally, only what they've been told to say.  Nevertheless, pleasant staff.  

After odor - restaurant was well ventilated, and we left smelling the same way we arrived despite our neighbors' small little meat grill.  

Conclusion - can't exactly recommend this establishment for its food given the missing value, however nice place if you want superior atmosphere and service with a ""themed"" meal of Japanese cuisine.",5nnWMRt2YOPwJdhmpo91Vg,0,0,4,D2ZIOenvMtJRIwC0stPe9g

That's exactly what we did after our delicious Teppanyaki meal here at Mizumi!

Our chef was pretty chill and I'm so glad he didn't toss food into our mouth from the grill like we're some kind of culinary seal waiting for our meal! He prepared our food in an entertaining, yet dignified manner and man, was it FANTASTIC!!
He started us with the noodles, which in hindsight, I wish had been the last item to eat, as it was one of our faves! We also had grilled veggies, shrimp, scallops and fried rice. 
If you go, skip the fried rice and double up on those noodles! You will be like ""ya know, that chick TC on Yelp was right, this is fucking amazing!!"" and I'll be nodding my head in agreement all slowly and smiling like..'right? I told you!!'

Somehow we saved room for dessert.. they hooked us up with some mochi since it was our honeymoon celebration! Then we ordered the green tea macaroon and a chocolate ice cream dessert that had a chocolate painted face on it! So beautiful and SO danged delicious!

2031811,2013-11-05,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with all the reviews on here. Upon walking in the restaurant my first observation was their decor. It was corny and stereotypical. It was like they were trying to make every square inch of the place as Asian & Japanese as possible... just in case you forgot you were at a place called MIZUMI.

We were a large group of 11 people and ordered almost every sushi and roll dish on the menu, including the mizumi special roll. 
Nothing was memorable.. Just mediocre.  I've eaten at nobu and morimoto which were exceptionally better. Even the dessert chocolate cake was dry and unappetizing.

The service was another disappointment. I normally don't like to comment on service for restaurants because I've always held food taste to be of highest importance. But, when the poor service means I don't get my food, we got problems. Getting a waiter to help was worse than hailing a NYC taxi cab on a rainy Friday night.  We were looking around for a server and they deliberately avoided eye contact and ran the other direction. It happened multiple times. 

When we didn't receive our sake order 30 minutes in to our dinner we asked to speak to the manager. The woman was completely indifferent about our comments of the lack of service. We left with a $1600 bill and completely unsatisfied.

Beautiful views/ scenery of the 
private gardens, koi pond and waterfall located inside of Mizumi. We had a beautiful view of the waterfall. 

Total excluding tax & tip came out to roughly $321 for 2 adults. I've mentioned this before, call us crazy but when in Vegas we always have a ""Second Dinner"" so we skipped drinks etc. for this meal so we can have it at the next restaurant. 

Ordered a sashimi platter for our appetizer $55...it was simple & delicious. 

We had the Chef's Omakase (like a prix fixe menu/ chef's choice) Which was $125 per person.

First Course
Ama Ebi, Caviar, & Garlic Crisp Chip

Second course
Seared Scallop w. Yuzu topped with thin slices of nori,
Duck Confit Taco, & Takoyaki filled with Lobster

Third Course
Mentaiko pasta topped with a perfectly poached egg & nori strips (Absolutely divine!)

Fourth Course 
Braised Short Ribs, seasonal vegetables, & fresh Wasabi mousse 

Fifth Course
Chefs selection of Nigiri (Consisted of: Fatty Toro, Uni, Giant Clam, etc.) 

Sixth Course 
Dessert - A coconut mousse with mango/passion fruit sorbet.
Mochi Ice Cream tasted extremely fresh. The mochi wrapped around the ice cream was just perfect. 

We had to squeeze in an order of Ama Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) nigiri for the both of us $16 -- mmm you can never go wrong!

The food here at Mizumi is good, not necessarily ""great"" when looking at it per portions, taste, uniqueness and ultimately price.  Las Vegas is known for having some high end, fancy Asian restaurants be it Chinese or Japanese including Nobu, Tao, Red 8, Wazuzu, and Mizumi, where it can cost roughly on avg $100 per person and you're not even filled (not even that lame stereotyped myth of ""30 minutes later you're hungry again"" for Chinese food).  You'll be satisfied, but not stuffed and maybe craving a bit more.  That may be good or bad, in that the girls usually want to eat less, more healthy and stay thin.  The guys sometimes want to get their feed bag on and money's worth, but in truth some may need to watch their weight and reduce their Buddha belly's anyway.

You can't go too wrong with most dishes. Here's some of what we had:

Robata Platter @ $28 with sea bass, organic Jidori Chicken, beef, shishito peppers, and shiitake mushrooms.

Seared Albacore Sashimi @ $22 with crispy onions and ponzu sauce

Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod @ $38 with cherry blossom pickled baby vegetables, and Okinawan sweet potato chip

Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll @ $30 with seared Hokkaido scallops, crunchy shrimp, avocado, onion sprouts, jalapeño, yuzu tobiko, citrus aïoli, and eel sauce.

None were awe inspiring, but also they weren't bad either, I've had the same dishes done better elsewhere (as well as worst elsewhere), so it's just average to me, not bad, and it's good, but not anything that stands out or is unique.

I'd say this 'tho as my RECOMMENDATION...

Crispy Brussels Sprouts or Broccoli @ $12 with toasted almonds, green onion, balsamic soy reduction.  This is a fantastic * * * * * (five stars!) dish, we had the Brussel Sprouts and the portions were a good size to share and the flavor was amazing (and I generally don't like brussel sprouts), so I'd probably try both the Brussell Sprouts AND the Broccoli if/when I come back here as part of the staple items to order with a group.

If you crave Japanese food and are in Las Vegas and don't want to leave the Encore / Wynn or area with Palazzo / Venetian, this does the job for convenience and proximity, 'tho price of course is no bargain since this is high end cuisine.  If you're wanting ""the best"" and was in Las Vegas for one night and one night only, then I'd read all of the reviews, research the peer restaurants and make an educated decision based on the evidence you read for what you like and are looking for. 

If you're looking for a ""bang for your buck"" and to get filled 'cuz you're starving, then you can still eat here, but may need to eat something a bit before or follow up with snacks after to keep your costs down... but if money is no object, if you order it and are willing to pay for it... bon appetite!  You'll find a limitless menu of sushi delights to order from.  If this were an AYCE buffet, it would be awesome... but that's just unreasonable wishful thinking :) for such a place like this that caters to the lifestyle of the rich and famous types... 

The view here is nice, you get an aesthetic waterfall, and they have open air seating as well as indoor seating. 

The service here is good, and friendly.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,2,1,3,HwDk-iTQOsaoVEFVK_kFMQ

The sushi rolls were not flavorful. 
Ordered the Mizumi Roll for $40. Portion was the size of an average roll. It had maine lobster, avocado, tamago, soy paper, wasabi tobiko, and yuzu mustard aïoli. It was a very lightly sauced roll and I appreciated the generous amount of lobster. I guess that's where the $40 came in.

The Dragon Roll was alright, tasted like a roll from a typical sushi joint, if not worse. Not recommended. 

The Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeño Gelée with jalapeño gelée, soy salt, ginger, negi, cilantro oil, crispy onion, ponzu sauce was flavorful. The quality of the yellowtail was enjoyable as well. Great combination of ingredients and flavors. 

Black truffle teriyaki chicken was decent. Not much truffle flavor, but that stuff is precious. 

Sashimi was fresh, tuna was scrumptious. Generous slices. 

Even for an expensive night out, I would opt for another restaurant.",W-La-8pnqIYBk2eyfoA4Gw,2,1,3,_pQ_lfxI8w4ApQixFnDl9w
2358072,2016-08-23,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"Delicious Sushi/Japanese/Teppanyaki restaurant located in the Wynn. Easy access to the restaurant by the valet parking in front of the hotel. Right outside of the nightclub. There are several options for seating - the separate Teppanyaki room, the main dining room, outside by the small pond, a small sushi bar. 

As with everything at the Wynn this restaurant is well-appointed. I was worried before coming here that it might be too fancy for my kids, especially after reading reviews of people who could not wear shorts in the restaurant. It's fine dining and I would just wear pants/jeans/dresses, etc. to be safe and no shorts or casual wear. There is no formally stated dress code.

We sat in the teppanyaki room because with kids that's just so entertaining :). The nice thing is if everyone in your party doesn't want teppanyaki they can order off the normal menu. Also, if you want a certain sushi that isn't on the menu ask because they likely can make it. We didn't see salmon rolls or nigi toro rolls and we were able to order both...and they were delish!

For teppanyaki we tried shrimp, sirloin steak, and sea bass. All was wonderful. The fried rice is da bomb. The soup and salad are fresh and filling. The veggies are cooked and season to perfection.

For dessert, it's included in the price of teppanyaki. We each had a sorbet and we were also served the special chocolate mousse with a Geisha face. So good! So filling.

I would love to eat her every time I come back to Vegas. It's definitely at the top of my list of dining spots. And you can definitely take your kids here. There's just no kids menu so be prepared to pay for that :).",703E1kuAN7we3Eubx7BUEw,1,0,5,W8x5BANyQeocDkDlvhCIIw

Started with asking our server about the omakase - which I love doing at new restaurants, especially ones with great repurations.  I'm allergic to most types of gluten, but soy sauce and some other things found in Asian foods don't bother me.  Server mumbled something, of which I thought he said ""Not a problem, we've had two people request it earlier today..."" When I said, ""Great, I'll take it"" he copped a wee bit of an attitude and said ""No, I said that the chef won't do it."" I then told him that we needed some more time with the menu - and he just walked away.  He came back and as I was asking him questions, still the same attitude, almost annoyed that I had a gluten allergy.  Then he got argumentative with me when I tried to explain that I could eat this certain dish because I wasn't allergic to the gluten product he was describing.  I thought much of this was in my head until, as he walked away, my husband looked at me and said ""I'm over that guy.  I don't know what his problem is.""  I'm usually low maintenance about my gluten allergy - but I wish that a restaurant at that ""level"" would have been more accommodating and helpful.

The cocktail I had (a pear one) was pretty amazing - the service outside of our main server - was great.  We ended up getting some of the grilled food, some sashimi, sushi, etc.  Not really the most inventive food.  The sashimi I had was cut pretty thick as well (in a bad way).

My friend and I were there this past Sunday.  We arrived without a reservation, but were able to order from the full menu at the bar.  We ordered the tasting menu.  We explained to the bartender that my friend did not eat beef, but the bartender assured us there would be so much food, that we wouldn't even notice.  To that point, I'm not sure what she considered ""so much food,"" but it was 6 tastings total, inclusive of dessert.  Plus, we had eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robochon a few evenings before, so we were recently familiarized with what several tastings looks like, and that it shouldn't be a problem to make some adjustments to the menu due to a diner's dietary restrictions.

The food . . . the first tasting -- which I thought was an amuse bouche thrown in to greet us -- was one chilled oyster with a yuzu and champagne vinaigrette.  I thought it was tasty, but we had better oysters at L'Atelier.  The second tasting was various concoctions on top of 3 bruschetta-like bread slices, one concoction was beef tartare.  I enjoyed all of these, but my friend couldn't eat the beef one.  The third tasting was dry salmon on soba noodles.  I have never disrespected salmon in that way, so I wouldn't expect to pay for such.  The noodles had a good flavor, however.  The fourth tasting was an inedible, bloody kobe beef dish on top of a root vegetable puree (maybe turnip or parsnip) that was overly sweet.  Apart from the fact that my friend couldn't eat this dish, I found it inedible for being poorly prepared.  Part of the problem is that they forgot they had already served us the salmon and brought out more salmon.  Then they took it back to prepare the beef dish, which was obviously rushed and barely cooked.  Apart from that, the flavor was not good.  The last of the savory dishes was sushi, and I could buy better quality at Kroger.  It was sweaty fish on top of rice. The dessert was a sorbet of some sort.  It was okay, but the entire meal was an overall disappointment.

The drinks here are good, however.  And despite the bartender being off-base about the courses being sufficient (or about them being good), she was nice and personable.

I've tried quite a bit of the sushi, sashimi, and special rolls at Mizumi and while they are good, you can certainly do better at other establishments on the strip, and even more so off strip, particularly for the price.  I miss the tasting menus that Okada offered which were actually decent value.

Lucky me I got in early and was seated next to the water. The glass wall was up because its december, but the view into their waterfall was amazing. 
Right away when I looked at the menu I knew what to get... the Chef's Omakase menu. 6 courses featuring Mizumi's specialties. I supplemented for the Kobe beef and was not disappointed. I also decided on the Bamboo snow sake. A very good and not too sweet unflitered sake. 
Course 1 - scallops 
Course 2 - trio plate. Oyster/beef tataki/frog legs
Course 3 - mini seafood hot pot
Course 4 - kobe beef hot plate
Course 5 - sushi/sashimi
Course 6 - sorbet and cake
Evrything was excellent and cooked perfectly, especially the kobe beef. Since i cooked it myself on a hot stone.
Scallops had a perfect sear on the outside and a delicate smooth finish.
The oysters with win sauce... just amazing. The beef was tender and offset with crispy onions makes my mouth water when I think about it. And the frog legs... Oh my. The most delicate and delicious frog I've ever had. Lightly battered and fried.
The mini seafood hot pot with sea bass, king crab, sea scallop, shrimp and onions with noodles. Balanced with a ponzu dipping sauce. Honestly it didnt need a dipping sauce. Its light and refreshing seafood in a mild broth was enough on its own.
Now... The Kobe beef, with all the marbling you would expect. Lightly sear on a stone and dip into 3 of the sauces if desired. Such a succulent piece of beef that over cooking should be a crime.
The sushi was very fresh. I don't think the wasabi was ground fresh, but I dont use much anyway. Uni. I dont know how many times i have gotten bad uni. This was not one of those times. 
To finish, some sorbet and the fluffiest cake ever with little crumbles of goodness in the bottom.

The girlfriend and I had several dishes which were all delicious...
Yellow tail sashimi 
Scallop tataki and crispy shrimp roll***
Robata platter
Crispy Brussels sprouts
Wagyu short ribs***
Mask dessert

All the dishes that we had, exceeded our expectations. Japanese flavors with a some French fusion. We likes the fact that every dish was represented and explained what was on the plates.

The shrimp and vegetable tempura were lightly battered and cooked to a crispy perfection.  The assortment of the vegetables was nicely varied.  It was the first time I had a beet in the tempura ensemble.  

The sushi was absolutely fresh and well presented.  The traditional nigiri pieces (tuna, salmon, tomago, hamachi, etc) were all perfect but the one that stood out was the toro.  I have never had such nice pieces of toro before at any sushi place.  

The jidori organic chicken, grilled on a skewer under the robatyaki section, was nicely cooked, tender, and well seasoned.

My man and I opted for date night at Mizumi -- Chef Devon (his hugs rock!) customized one of the best meals I've had in Vegas for us many moons ago and we were ready for another night of wow.  And, anyway, who doesn't want to chow down while staring at the famous Wynn waterfall?!! 

We were in the mood for cold omakase when Richard shared with us a new program at Mizumi that started just 2 weeks ago: 7 or 10 course cold omakase at Chef Kitt's sushi bar only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  Um.... YUP! What followed was heaven.  A totally different take on yellowtail jalapeno (complete with crunchy potato slivers) - check. Toro with minced daikon topped with a quail egg.  Check.  Japanese triggerfish plated so beautifully you (sort of) felt bad for that poor fishy while you relished its tastiness in your mouth.  Check.  

If you've ever had the experience where you were so full but couldn't wait to see what else was coming and can't wait for that to happen again, then wait no more! Chef Kitt and his first officer, Chef Andrew, are on it and it won't be long before it's impossible to grab a seat and watch these masters in action. Remember to ask to sit at their sushi area (there are two separate sushi counters at Mizumi), and get ready to eat! 

So, RUN (do not walk) to Mizumi, and watch these guys drop it like it's hot... er cold.",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,2,3,5,U0pZG4I-_3FQDjvF40R88Q
2896979,2016-04-17,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"We're big fans of high end Japanese restaurants. We lived in Tokyo for many years and have a weak spot for creative sushi rolls and modern takes on Japanese classics. The LV strip has a few high end places to choose from. We've tried most of them and I think Muzumi is the best. It is better than Nobu and Kumi. Kumi was a previous favorite but lost the magic last year. So this trip we chose Mizumi and were satisfied from tongue to belly to wallet. 

Great rolls, they don't try too hard or overdo it in wild or heavy sauces. We had three rolls in our 3 person group and loved each. There's a pleasant taste of classic Japanese sushi rolls in Mizumi's selection. 

Sides and entrees were delightful. Loved the perfectly cooked miso cod which melts in your mouth with just the right level of miso sweetness. The robata platter was just awesome. Again a reminder of Tokyo flavors but with some added high-end delight. The nigiri standard sushi fish quality was some of the best we've ever had in the US or Japan.

Some excellent sake and beer selections. Some hard to find. Delish! 

You don't visit this kind of place for value but we left with a bill slightly less than what we paid for similar but inferior meals at Nobu and most recently Kumi. Mizumi is the best of its kind that we have found on maybe eight or nine trips to vegas over the past five years.",dO1_nd951vY99sNUIG89hQ,0,0,5,XUmwy9L5nYpcNgmcsqsNNg

It consists of 6 courses.

3. Kami Nabe Hot Pot - the soup was very tasty

Pros:
- Loved their seared foie gras. It was very well cooked and it isn't too often nowadays to find seared foie gras due to the ethical issues going on.
- They have a man made waterfall with a pond right outside of the restaurant that you can view through floor-ceiling windows. Pretty cool and makes you feel very isolated from Vegas. There is seating on the deck next to the waterfall but you probably have to make a special request for that.
- Excellent salmon sashimi. The fish was very very fresh. It was not chewy when you bite into it and the salmon just tore apart easily while retaining its shape. My girlfriend and I always get salmon sashimi whenever its offered at restaurants and this is one of the best places we've had in a while.
- Miso cod was great as usual. Sweet and perfectly flakely.
- I really enjoyed their cherry shaved ice dessert. A great light dessert with a great balance of sweet with the condensed milk and acidity with the cherry.

ATMOSPHERE: Mizumi was renovated in the past couple of years and the interior is now a lush red and gold - unless I'm losing my mind, I recall there being a large, gold fish near the sushi bar. But what really sets this place apart is the wall-size window on the waterfall outside. It's incredible. Be sure to try and sit near the window. There is even a private table outside (F&B minimum) right by the waterfall that I've been dying to have a reason to book. Someday. Kind of awkward, though, when you leave Mizumi and you have to walk by the loooooong line of guys and gals waiting to get into Tryst nightclub downstairs. Oh, well.

FOOD: If you like sushi/nigiri, you have come to the right place. Robatayaki is good, but small portion-wise. Sharing is good. Try new things.

DRINKS: Similar drink menu to other properties in the Wynn, but good. Nothing to blow your mind, though. Go with wine.

SERVICE: Our service has varied, but the people have always been nice. Nothing to really set this place apart, but 

TIPS: Be sure to request a table near the waterfall window when you make your reservation. The birthday dessert (last time we were there) is a free series of mochi flavors - cute.",lCCE9bD5Z833Wm0q-TEMHw,2,0,4,QsPoUW1l9Zf_Oe-oK70W4g

The General Manager reached out to me and took the time to speak with me via email and phone about my visit. Due to her extremely professional and attentive care, I took the time to go back to Las Vegas and pay another visit to the restaurant. Asking me to give Mizumi a second chance is no small request due to the high number of excellent restaurants in the city. The fact that I decided to trust her and make another visit speaks volumes for the level of her attention to my concerns. 

This visit was immensely better than my previous. All service issues were addressed. The food and service was excellent and I had the pleasure of dealing with one of the more enjoyable sommelier I have ever had at a service.

While the food was decadent, the service was amazing (props to Stacey for being my silver lining -- but more on that later), what absolutely topped my experience was learning that restaurants (in Vegas no less) have dress codes which necessitate the staff to keep loaner pants on hand. Arriving in bright white shorts, I learned just how myopic my view of the world was. I was greeted with two options -- go back to the hotel and change or wear loaner pants. Needless to say, I chose the latter. Can I just say that I rocked those loaner pants! Never mind the fact that they a) didn't zip up, b) didn't button and c) made me glad I was wearing a long blue polo. I think in hindsight is was actually recognition by the staff, based on my body dimensions, on just how much I was about to consume. Our waitress (with 11 years of experience at the restaurant, mind you) said I was merely her second example of someone wearing loaner pants. I took this to mean I was only the second person naive enough to think that dress codes didn't exist at a hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. Will I be back? Heck ya.

My issues arouse from the food itself. My friend and I decided to go big and get the Omakase for $125 per person at 5-6 courses. The food was just ""meh."" The Uni Risotto was strangely bland and the weird; breaded Wagyu beef dish was just...well, weird. I took a couple bites and couldn't eat anymore. Made me sad that the meat was prepared in this way. 

The sushi was pretty good, but not exceptional. And when I went back to my room at my hotel later that night, I became quite ill. Being that I only shared 1 carafe of sake with my friend and had nothing else to eat since breakfast- I feel positive my upset stomach was due to the meal I ate at Mizumi. 

Pretty much the last thing anyone needs is to become ill while on a trip, and being that the food was average and overpriced- and most likely the culprit of my agony at 2 in the morning- I would suggest steering clear.",34qgcM7HOzrLM4rdzAWStw,2,0,2,n6MNTf5mKZKmMtBMwMR_ow

We were seated promptly and greeted by our server's helper. When our server came over, she was very pushy about us placing our order. We told her to give a few more minutes but she kept coming over and it was very irritating. The place is huge, like most Vegas restaurants, but only about 1/3 full. I don't know why she was rushing us to order, it wasn't like they needed the table. We ordered a bottle of wine from one of the most expensive wine lists I've ever experienced. We ordered one sushi roll at $30 each. Yes, that's right $30! It was good, but not $30 good. For that price it should have been the best I ever had. We also had 6 oysters on the half shell ($26) which were the smallest oysters I've ever seen. I don't know how good these oysters really were because they were drenched with vinegar. You don't drench quality oysters in sauces or vinegar if you want to really appreciate them. My wife ordered the ocean trout, which as far as I could tell by the texture, color and taste, this was identical to Scottish salmon. My wife thought she got the wrong order, and when we questioned our server she wasn't positive either, and went to ask the cook. She came back and told us that this was the correct order. We eat salmon all the time, and I'm sure anyone tasting this who is familiar with salmon, would identify it as salmon too. our server came back a second time to tell us that it is in the salmon family. So much for that, but the fish was overcooked and dry. I had the Robatta platter and the beef and chicken were overcooked and dry. The shiitake mushrooms were rubbery and had no flavor.

The place is decked out in a bright red color with a modern theme, and overlooks two waterfalls, one of which is the one that can be seen at the nightclub Tryst, directly underneath this place. 

The Teppanyaki room is seated every 30 minutes so be on time, otherwise you'll have to wait until the next seating. Because of this, though, I had some sushi at the sushi bar which was excellent. The avocado was perfectly ripe, the rice well prepared, and ingredients were high quality. 

Everything on the Teppanyaki menu is set- it comes with a salad, soup, and mochi dessert in addition to whatever you'd like to order as your main protein. The show was good but he didn't do as many tricks as I'd hoped, and I was told by my friend it just depends on the chef you have that night.

The main dish I had ordered was the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki. Again, the beef was cooked to my expectations of medium rare, and the Teriyaki sauce poured on top on my meat was a perfect combination. I believe it's one of the best Teriyaki sauce I've tasted in my life. 

I was lucky enough to make reservations a week before I arrived in Vegas, which allowed me to sit right in front of the Wynn waterfall. It definitely added to my experience, getting to dine in front of such a beautiful view.

The service was great, as were the drinks.  The food definitely did not meet my expectations.  Perhaps the fish in Houston is fresher, but the food at Mizumi just didn't do it for me.  

They asked if we had any food allergies, and I told them I was allergic to peanuts.  Since I couldn't have the dessert that was part of the tasting menu, they brought out sorbet for me (and charged me for it!!).",oRR7wi4C1pUAOK3HjKcLMQ,6,1,2,hnsOoc5O8EAFUEarmmWoGg

4108542,2016-06-17,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"I just came back from my last visit in '15.  Great atmosphere, our server Anthony was very knowledgeable about the restaurant.  We got a table which incorporates an amazing view of the lake indoors (right behind the glass screen).  There is outdoor seating right next to the waterfall but it's easy to forget you're in Las Vegas due to the atmosphere (which is certainly a compliment).  I'm sure there's a perfect season to go out and (there's heaters if you're going in the Winter) but I didn't see any fans out for the Summer.   Music choice was a bit interesting since it was Pop music from what I remember.  Not sure what I expected for the atmosphere the restaurant gives off. Mizumi - or the Japanese spelling Misumi - means beautiful women in Japanese which is why Steve Wynn named it Mizumi. 

The fish was fresh, and the sashimi list provides information about where various fishes come from.  I found it interesting when I asked our server if the eggs in the sweet egg omelette actually came from Las Vegas & he said they did.  

The kitchen doesn't have a preset way the items are brought out (example: Bringing out heavier hot dishes first and presenting lighter dishes at the end of the meal).  The food comes out when it's ready.  If that's your preference like mine then it's probably something to be brought up.

Our plates came out in this exact order:
Toro Tataki(ala carte from sushi platter) came out with the Foie Gras (hot plates).  The toro tataki was great quality and a pricier dish but you definitely get a hefty amount for what you pay for.  It's paired with taro chips (yes toro with taro chips lol).  It was more of curiosity when ordering the Foie Gras.  Chef David Hashimoto worked under Alex (French) restaurant before so he incorporated his french cullinary background in this dish.  It's definitely not Japanese (lol) so if you're a foie gras lover like I am then I would recommend this dish. The Foie Gras ended being a mix of sweet, salty, and tart flavors.

Next came out couple orders of nigiri(light) which came out fresh next to the Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll (rich).  The fish was great quality and I would recommend the roll for individuals who steer away from raw fish.  

 
We were lastly presented with the pork belly from the robatayaki menu.  It was delicious, extremely rich, and I would recommend it.  

Didn't save room for dessert sadly.  I recommend window seating if available.",tpq10k8caBbqMbqNwpaE7Q,2,2,5,evN6v76LaBl0w3151-lMSQ

Simply awesome dinner from start to finish. Had the omakase menu (chef's line up) and every single dish was great. My wife supplemented the pork for kobe beef (extra charge $) which just melted in your mouth and was well worth the experience. Service was exceptional from the hostess to the waiter and servers/runners. Highly recommend this place to everyone who is visiting or lives in Las Vegas.

4142054,2013-12-29,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"First off the ambiance and service are 5 stars without a doubt. As far as the Food, I have to say by far the WORST and MOST OVERPRICED SUSHI EVER.  We walked in and were told the restaurant was booked for the evening so we had to eat at the Bar.  They did thought about 30 minutes into our visit find us a seat, that was greatly appreciated.  

I am a True Sushi Lover and always like trying new places, we ordered the Edamame with Truffle Oil, which was $10, also a Rainbow Roll for $28.00 thought it would be the best roll I had ever had, disappointingly the fish was so cut so thinly I thought it was worth about $8.99 and they didn't ever put masago on it, we also ordered a Chef recommended Scallop Roll for $30.00 we had to send that bad it was so bad.  We had a Philadelphia Roll for $12.00 that was the nights winner!  We also ordered the Miso Cod, for I believe $30.00, it was bland,  I have had better in places that only charged $9.00 and Lamb for $40.00 that didn't even have decent sauce, I have had better for $12.00.  Overall the food quality was OK but nothing to write home about.

The restaurant has a huge glass wall that overlooks a massive waterfall outside, the only highlight of our night, we took some wonderful pictures.  I would highly recommend having a couple $15.00 beers and taking some great pictures on the terrace in front of the waterfall but do not waste your time eating this overpriced crap.

My wife and I typically drop about $100.00 to $150 on sushi a few times a month and eat and drink at least double what we had here, and most importantly we enjoy the quality and presentation else ware.  If you are looking for Quality Sushi visit the MOzen Bistro at the Mandarin Oriental.  If you are looking for good pictures grab a couple drinks here and save your money for something better.

if you are a Seafood Lover I would Highly Recommend AquaKnox in The Venetian Hotel.",zGZq_-PxxMPjTBwW2V-uTw,4,1,1,HNiRGGIe8AHA0Q9Y9eKY4A

Our waiter J Israel provided the worst service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. He literally did not come to the table once during our meal. We had to call him anytime we wanted anything. 

He was arrogant and rude and ruined our experience. Management made no concessions when we complained. The food is reasonable but for the price you would expect better service from a Wynn establishment.  This waiter literally was the worst I have ever seen in Vegas. I hope he has other career plans because if this his life's goal... he is already failing.

4175341,2014-09-18,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"I ate here last night with a girlfriend.  We almost were going to eat at another sushi place on property but that atmosphere seemed very crowded and not as pretty, so the hostess called Mizumi for us to see if we would be able to eat there instead.  They asked the hostess if we were dressed appropriately, and the hostess stepped out from behind her box to see what bottoms and shoes we were wearing!  That was mortifying because we are both pretty girls, skinny, and were dressed in skirts and crop tops.  Then the hostess had to see if we were staying on property.  Why does that matter??  I live here so why would I be sleeping there?  I felt kind of insulted at all the questions before they would grace me with letting me eat at Mizumi so that is why I gave them three stars.  Once they gave my girlfriend and I the go-ahead to go downstairs to Mizumi everyone inside was super friendly and greeted us.  Literally every person we walked by wished us to have a good time.  Our server was friendly and informative enough, though I did think he should have come by our table more to check on us or see if we needed anything.  I had a Lycheetini made with vodka instead of gin which was excellent and my friend had chardonnay.  We started with some brussel sprouts that were really just the leaves rather then the heads fried in an oil and served with sliced nuts I think.  It was excellent.  We ordered some sushi as well as eggplant robata and Chilean sea bass robata.  I did not like the Chilean sea bass as much as I normally do for some reason.  I think it was cut so small that it lost some of the oily and juicey texture it is revered for to be honest.  We ended the dinner with a chocolate mask which was literally a white kabuki mask decorated to perfection with red lips and black hair served with a scoop of ice cream and some rice-crispy-type-crunchies.  The mask was filled with a mousse.  I'd have given the dinner four stars but my experience getting a reservation there was embarrassing that I brought it down to three stars.  I'm not so full of myself that I am going to be like ""I'm a hot girl so seat me"" but I am a local, I do have money to spend, I am an excellent tipper, so don't give me a hard time getting a reservation.

Sushi rice is supposed to be in room temperature but its a bit cold. Flavor of rice could use a ITSY bit more of vinegar.

Mizumi is a modern Japanese restaurant located right by the lake at the Wynn.  The setting is beautiful - just be sure to sit facing the lake and waterfall to enjoy the best view.

The restaurant has a wide range of Japanese options ranging from sushi and sushimi, to Robatayaki and Teppanyaki.  I focused on sushi and Robatayaki.

I started things off with Robatayaki Jidori chicken, sea bass, and beef tenderloin.  All of the proteins were delicious!  The coals used for cooking lend a unique flavor to the food and each was cooked perfectly.  

I then ordered one of their signature rolls based upon my server's recommendation.  The Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll is seared Hokkaido scallops, crunchy shrimp, avocado, onion sprouts, jalapeño, yuzu tobiko, citrus aïoli, and eel sauce.  The texture and flavor were amazing!

Overall, the food was delicious and well prepared.  The setting was excellent and the service was good.  I will definitely be back!

If you like oysters, this is the place to order them.  The Chilled Shigoku Oysters appetizer is so good - I don't know that I can even describe how good it truly was.  I think we could have eaten six orders of them.

The Ceviche Roll also really stood out as both unique and delicious - the creamy, cool avocado and the spicy, fresh salsa complimented the fish so well in a way that was totally unexpected - this was definitely my new favorite sushi bar item on the menu.

4395492,2016-05-21,7,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"Don't go chasing waterfalls.  

I came to Mizumi with the expectation of having a nice dinner with an amazing view.  I didn't make reservations because we saw there was a lot of open seating, but it took 10 minutes to seat us.  We were seated next to the waterfall, which was of course, gorgeous.  

Service is what you would expect at the Wynn.  Everyone is very attentive and courteous.  They help you into your seat, set your napkin for you, and treat you like a princess.  If only the food was as good as the service.

The menu is limited.  They offer omakase for $125+, robatayaki, sushi, entrees, and hot plates.  Nothing stood out as ""must try"" items.  So we opted for items from the grill, a sushi roll, and the mizumi mask dessert.  

Grill items: Enoki and bacon, tenderloin, and pork belly.  Of the three, the pork belly was the most flavorful, very tender, and filling.  The enoki and bacon and tenderloin skewer were both okay.  

Kimchee cucumber sushi roll: It was beautifully presented, the cilantro sauce was delicious!  But the sushi roll itself was a bit lacking.  

Mizumi mask dessert: Possibly the redeeming factor of the meal.  The mask is also beautiful, and when you crack it open, a delicious, light mousse lies beneath.  It also comes with vanilla ice cream.  The flavors of chocolate, vanilla, and hazelnut pair nicely with one another and it was probably the best thing we had that night.

4402123,2017-05-04,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"As long as you're not coming to Mizumi expecting to have something you've never had before, you'll be treated to a wonderful experience, and hopefully you'll appreciate the restaurant's effusive service, opulent décor, dark beauty, and solid riffs on modern classic dishes that other restaurants have made famous.

Put another way, if your idea of Japanese culinary creativity is maki rolls stuffed with cream cheese, you'll think Mizumi is either on the bleeding-edge or heretical. If you've dined at Nobu or Zuma before, this is old hat.

On my experience at Mizumi, I started with sushi, specifically the Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeño Gelée. Very thinly-sliced yellowtail were dressed with crispy onion, negi, cilantro oil, and ponzu sauce, resulting in intense onion-y, spicy, and sweet flavors, while the oil created a tongue-feel of a lightly-seared piece of bacon, and the onions provided a much-appreciated crunch. Upon tasting this $29 appetizer (which the menu estimates to be 90 calories), I realized that I've had this same exact dish before at Nobu. Mizumi should pay royalties to Chef Matsuhisa for much of their menu.

I then moved on to nigiri: 2 pieces of the Sweet Shrimp nigiri (i.e., spot prawns) from the cold waters of Alaska. The prawns featured a delicate, sweet flavor that almost managed to justify the $16 price tag. I do wish they'd serve them with the deep-fried head as some of Mizumi's uhh... competitors do. My other quibble is with the ultra-stickiness of the sushi rice at Mizumi resulted in grains of rice stubbornly clinging to my fingers as I ate the nigiri. I suspect Mizumi may add starch to their sushi rice in an attempt to make their nigiri chopsticks-friendly to Americans rather than educating the masses that nigiri should never be eaten with chopsticks.

Next up were 2 pieces of the Ch?toro nigiri, weighing in at a ""this better be worth it, or Jay K's gonna shred you on Yelp"" price of $24. As you probably know, Ch?toro is a mixture of akami (meaty tuna) and otoro (fatty tuna belly), making for a well-marbled tasty, sweet, and tender cut of tuna fish. Mizumi's ch?toro is flown in from Spain and has the ""melty"" mouthfeel of a premium piece of otoro, but with more of an actual tuna flavor.

Served with my sushi was a $14 Lobster Miso Soup which contained chunks of lobster, tofu, nameko mushrooms, seaweed, green onions, and mitsuba. I was pleasantly surprised by the considerable amount of lobster in the soup. Lobster and butter will always be everyone's favorite classic pairing, but the complementary nature of miso and lobster should not be underestimated -- I'd choose Mizumi's lobster miso soup over most lobster bisques I've had.

The Whole-Grilled Bone Marrow ($20) may have been the highlight of my dinner at Mizumi. Glazed with a sweet yakitori sauce, I expected the bone marrow to have a smokiness one would associate with yakitori, but it did not, and that was alright. It was sweet, rich, sticky, and satisfying, pairing well with the brioche croutons. It was sweet enough that it could be eaten for dessert.

After I slurped down my bone marrow, my entrée arrived, the Baked Sweet Miso Marinated Black Cod ($38), listed on the menu as containing only 430 calories. This is the dish that made Nobu famous. Mizumi's preparation is a little bit cleaner in that it is not served with the reduced miso sauce marinade that Nobu's black cod is glazed with. Instead, a variety of different sweet pickles are served aside the fish. This allows the eater to exert more control over how sweet each bite is. I would rate the Mizumi rendition of miso-marinated black cod to be about on par with Nobu's and Zuma's version.

All said, Mizumi delivered a fine meal from a high-end restaurant located in one of Las Vegas's premier casino resort hotels, pretty much on par with what I expected. Although my meal rarely thrilled, at no point did it disappoint.

4459000,2017-12-24,1,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"We decided for a light dinner after having a big lunch earlier. Our server was Anthony, who is a veteran at this restaurant. In fact, we remembered that he had served us about six years ago when the restaurant was under a different name. 

The service...Anthony is warm, friendly, attentive, offers great recommendations on dishes. He was super attentive through our meal. I am not exaggerating, he stopped at our table at least ten times. Thank you Anthony! 

We started with the yellowtail sashimi. It was such a balanced, fresh, crisp and well flavored dish. It was our favorite of the night despite having several other impeccable dishes. 

We then had the sea bass and shishito pepper skewers. Both were good, but they weren't the best I have had. 

We then had the bone marrow. I typically get bone marrow at steak houses as an add-on to steaks, or to burgers, or as a dish at American or Italian restaurants. To get it at a Japanese restaurant was unique in and of itself because the flavors were different than what I'm accustomed to having. There was a very delicious sauce across the top of the marrow, and it was served with crostinis. 

Next, we had the 72 hour wagyu with gnocchi and a parsnip purée. Again, the flavors were impeccable, the meat was melt in your mouth good!! 

We were on the fence about dessert and asked if there was something we just had to try. So we were told to try to Mizumi mask. I posted a picture of it, so please check it out! It was truly a work of art! The top was a mask made of chocolate that was hand painted individually. You crack it open with your spoon to find chocolate mouse sitting on a texturally crunchy bite. It was arguably the best dessert we have had (when factoring presentation along with taste and creativity). 

All in all, we will definitely be back. I wish we hadn't had as big of a lunch so we could have had an appetite for more dishes. We may be back again on our trip...!",rvXXTD-_rbLu5mLDTTQcRQ,1,1,5,BV8s3S-hkUsOriq6nvNFgQ

4490442,2014-12-20,2,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"During my birthday vacation in Vegas, I was in search of a good restaurant with vegan options for my birthday dinner.  One of my vegan friends told me that Mizumi at Wynn was incredible so I went with her suggestion and I'm so happy I did.  It was definitely a night to remember! 

As I walked into the restaurant, I was amazed at the beautiful decor.  We were seated at a table with a view of the breathtaking outdoor lit up waterfall.  It was such a gorgeous setting for dinner.  

As far as the vegan options, the back page of the menu listed the items that we could choose from.  The only minor issue we had was that we tried to order vegetable tempura and asked if it had egg and the server explained that it can't be made vegan.  I was a bit surprised that they could not make vegetable tempura with no egg as I've had it before at other vegan Japanese places.  But oh well, everything else we ordered made up for the minor issue.  My BF and I decided to share everything and we ordered vegetarian miso soup, organic tofu and shinseki pear salad, vegetable roll, ishiyaki bi bim bop, organic agedashi tofu, farmer's vegetables, and organic eryngii mushrooms.  Everything was excellent and I could really taste the quality in the food.  The rice in the vegetable sushi roll was perfectly prepared and none like I've had in any sushi place,  My BF and I could not stop saying ""mmm, mmm, wow.""  We were both in heaven as we tried every dish.  My favorite dish was the organic tofu and shiseki pear salad which had romaine lettuce, shiso, carrots, seaweed, kukui nuts and yuzu-ginger vinaigrette - very fresh tasting and I loved the flavors.  For dessert, we had the vegan organic shiseki pear tart and the lychee sorbet - both also delicious.  They even brought out a candle and Happy Birthday written on a piece of dark chocolate on the sorbet just for me.  

As far as the service, it was top notch!  All the food was brought out in perfect order - miso soup and sushi first, then salad, then bigger plates.  We never had to wait long for our food.  The servers were very attentive and they even refolded your napkin when you got up to use the restroom.  

Beautiful ambiance, incredible food and superb service.  Definitely a memorable birthday dinner! I would love to come back next time I'm in Vegas!",Th_ce__iXCGm5a1g9TzwDQ,3,2,5,168nZmYjL68V19wa9XilcQ

The desserts topped a fantastic meal off - the chocolate candy bar confection and mango sorbet

The service was outstanding and contributed to a memorable evening.

5077217,2015-05-19,2,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"It's too bad that their full menu doesn't seem to be on their website, because I'll have to try and remember everything that our party ordered this past weekend.  Everything was so delicious, and probably twice as delicious sitting in such a beautiful restaurant.  It's too bad that we came on a cold evening, because I think they usually open up the glass doors to the waterfall.  Next time we come, and there will definitely be a next time, I'm aiming for one of their patio tables right next to the waterfall!

Let's see if I can recall everything that was served.  One of our friends pretty much ordered everything for our group...

Abalone Sashimi: This was the one item that was a must-have for me.  I've never tried raw abalone, and I was stoked that they carried it.  The texture was so new to me -- it was crunchy!  Small portion but worth the new experience.

Yellowtail Sashimi w/ jalapeño gelée, crispy onion, micro cilantro, ponzu, nori cracker:  This dish was divine; we had to order two.  The yellowtail was SO fresh and each component of the dish was a burst of flavor that complimented the protein well.

Fried Shrimp w/ brussel sprouts: Tasty dish, though not my top choice as I'm not a the biggest fan of fried seafood.  At least it wasn't a heavy batter.

Mizumi Roll & Scallop Tataki Rolls: I usually don't order rolls at high-end Japanese restaurant, though these were tasty and decadent, and great to share in a larger group.

Trio of Tartare: This was a special menu item, consisting of tuna, salmon, and kanpachi.  Each tartare was incredibly flavorful and fresh.

Squid Ink Risotto: I've had squid ink sushi before, but it wasn't this fresh.  Great choice, especially if you're feeling adventurous.

Other items we ordered (that I can remember) were seabass skewers and a miso-glazed seabass.  The seabass skewers were like butter.  Unfortunately, I was too full to try to miso-glazed seabass.  Desserts were presented beautifully, but again, I had no room that those, either.

This is such a fun place to dine in Vegas.  They have a room in the back for Robatayaki, as well as a sushi bar, but I definitely have my eye on the patio for our next visit!",32Y8ZSJ11chiJJuraiVB_Q,6,6,5,_kzvqSef0HxqZKBvzQRF7A

Had pre-show drinks at Parasol Down, which was an awesome experience as always, and then went to Mizumi for an after-show snack of sorts. We always wanted to try Mizumi, but was leery because I've been disappointed by so many high-end restaurants in LA where you pay for the view/ambience/reputation but not so much for the food. I'm looking at you, Scarpetta. 

On to the food... we ordered the robata platter, the Alaskan king crab, pork belly, chicken wings and one other thing which escapes me at the moment. Also ordered a drink... something Ninja. The drink was good, but not a good accompaniment for the meal.

The robata platter...Holy moly. I don't normally care for sea bass nor beef tenderloin, but both were amazing! And the rest of the robata platter was excellent. The husband, who never eats shishito peppers and doesn't really care for mushrooms not only ate them both, he raved about them. And the king crab.. how wrong can you go with king crab cooked in a butter sauce? Although I do have to say that for $35, I'm not sure if I'll order it again, as it wasn't even a full leg. It was a piece about....4-5 inches long. Yes, the crab and the mushrooms that accompanied it were very yummy, but not $35 worth of yummy.

The pork belly... oh, the pork belly. It was more Chinese-style than I expected, as I tasted star anise, which I do not like at all. But it didn't stop me from eating it, much to the husband's chagrin. Definitely ordering at least 2 orders of this the next time. Oh, a woman seated at the next next table ordered the udon and she seemed to really enjoy it so that is on our list as well.

We had great seats, and our waiter was great. Wish we could remember his name, but he was funny, knowledgeable and very efficient. Service all around was worthy of a fine dining establishment. Will definitely be eating here again on our next visit.

The final bill, including a ~20% tip, came to $150. Yes, pricy for an evening snack of sorts, but worth every penny. I won't dock a star because of the price, because apart from the king crab leg, every bite was oh-so-worth the price.

Long residing on a fine dining 'to-do' list that never seems to shorten in a city where change is far more common than a truly classic space it was finally on Friday evening that myself and two friends sat down to dinner at Devin Hashimoto's Mizumi within the Wynn, the former chef at Michelin 2* Alex serving up modern Japanese cuisine as exquisite in execution as it is high in price.

No doubt one of the best rooms in Las Vegas, a waterfall view in the main room sure to wow both tourists and locals alike, it was just after the restaurant's 5:30 opening that all were seated in plush chairs gathered around a spacious marble four-top, the menu presented and perused as forgivingly light EDM pulsed overhead.

Greeted by the Chef who graciously agreed to cook for the table it was with hot green tea charged at $15 with unlimited refills that the evening commenced, one member of the table instead opting for a modestly priced sake that reportedly proved to be a bargain given the quality as a lightly battered scallop crowned in briny caviar spoke to high quality sourcing and plating intended to impress.

Served in five courses in a time-span just over two hours and a half, the first round saw the kitchen focus on raw presentations including a half-dozen oysters enlivened by fresh wasabi alongside strips of paper-thin beef as well as an ambitious tofu salad, each bite of the later showing a complex interplay of textures as well as flavors while melt-in-your-mouth Angus found balance in ponzu and cabbage aged to ferment.

Requesting the kitchen 'go easy' on sushi, but clearly ignoring such constraints when allowed to offer at their whim, course two saw Devin send out a large sampling of items flown in daily, the tender toro taken from just below the collar perhaps the best piece of tuna to ever grace my palate while the clam and its warmed extras were nearly as thrilling and tender, the snappy pink snapper another memorable bite.

Onward to warm items, all three menu mainstays with slight variance in the accoutrements depending on what is most fresh, suffice it to say that $40 for a small pot of egg custard seems expensive no matter how exotic the ingredients while both the unctuous duck liver and lightly grilled octopus competed to steal the spotlight from one another, the autumnal notes of the former no less lovely despite the warm weather while the bitter grapefruit gracing the latter dazzled in juxtaposition to fennel and garlic fried crisp.

Light on the stomach, as Japanese cuisine often seems to trend, a hot-pot was presented as the night's final savory, the admixture of seabass and shellfish all cooked to a semi-firm texture above still-burning flames as the mushrooms, vegetables, and springy noodles all lent textural variance to a broth that was crystal clear but umami rich.

Truly a restaurant worthy its accolades, though the pre-tip bill trumped $350 even with few items offered as gifts, it was with Devin standing tableside discussing Las Vegas dining in general that the meal would end, a trio of molecular-influenced 'sundaes' each memorable in their own way while an additional request for cubed honey-toast riffing on a parfait or bread pudding was absolutely outstanding beneath fresh peach jam and brown butter ice cream, the ""Mizumi Chocolate Mask"" a destination sort of signature as beautiful as it was enjoyable to eat.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,11,5,DhNxny4uLg8WMiEY-1d-EQ

A table was reserved and off to dinner with the family we went. Tables for two had the best view of the waterfall but we were right behind them so we still had an unobstructed view. Perfect for date night.

My favorite things include: truffles, pork belly, duck, Nutella, sushi, lobster, steak, bacon and mushrooms. Pretty much everything on their menu had my favorite things which made deciding difficult but yet enjoyable for me. My sister got the Ishiyaki Duck Confit Bibimbap - great crisp duck pieces with egg, veggies and the usual Bibimbap toppings. Great dish with a bit of a kick. My bro-in-law got the Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod - came with lotus chips. It was alright. 

I got:
The Dream - champagne, elderflower liqueur with preserved hibiscus. A sweet fruity drink.

Lobster Beignets - small soft fried doughnuts filled with lobster. Reminds me of takoyaki and I love takoyaki. 5/5

Mizumi Roll - lobster, tamago, avocado, yuzu mustard aioli, soy paper topped with wasabi tobiko. Very beautifully plated with the lobster head and Yamamomo peach. A good roll. 4/5

Pork Belly - grilled perfectly. Comes with spicy pickled veggies. It has a Korean taste. 5/5

Bacon-Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms - two of my favorite things combined! Enough said! 5/5

Wagyu Short Rib - skewered with potatoes and topped with wasabi horseradish cream. Great flavor. 5/5

Yellow Corn with Black Truffle Butter - 2 pcs grilled corn on the cob with a generous dollop of black truffle butter. Watch the butter melt...oh my! 5/5

Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - vegetable (tightly wrapped with bacon) makes me think I'm eating ""healthier"". 5/5

Our server, Bojana did a fantastic job. She called me by first name, was very sweet and attentive.  I got a complimentary birthday mochi in green tea, mango, vanilla and red bean.  But I can't leave here without trying their other desserts.

Coconut-Mango - coconut mousse, angel food cake and mango passion fruit sorbet. I'm a fan of mango but not coconut so rating this dessert would be unfair.

Mizumi Chocolate Mask -  White chocolate mask, HAZELNUT dacquiose,  CHOCOLATE mousse, praline puffed rice and vanilla ice cream on the side. OMG! One of the best desserts I've ever had.  Definitely the highlight of my evening. Break the creepy-looking white chocolate mask shell with a knife to reveal the chocolatey hazelnutty goodness of this dessert. So creamy but not overwhelmingly rich. The puffed rice adds texture.  I cleaned my plate and the only thing  didn't eat was the white chocolate base that was holding the mask - only because I'm not a fan of white chocolate.

If you come into this spot thinking you'll order your typical katsu or hamachi sushi than you have come to the wrong place. This is a place of french and japanese fusion with some classic Japanese dishes as well. Me and my party had practically everything you could order on this menu. This I am not lying about especially in my pictures. The food was meticulously hand crafted with a taste on point. The duck is to die for perfectly cooked slightly rare with nice flavors exploding in your mouth.

There was plenty of dishes that had interesting flavors blended with french flavors such as foie grau braised and seared in sake as well as short ribs and steak tar tar.

The service was excellent with great attention to what was being served to the table. Every item with complete description as well as how to approach the dish and eat it properly to get the most out of each dish. 

Me being from Hawaii appreciated the very fresh poke with nori underneath. Nice touch as well as this gigantic lobster roll with a mix of teri and cream sauce. Very interesting rich buttery flavor as you ate the lobster with it.

If you go to this spot the omakase is definately a great option but if just ordering for yourself def get the duck. I'd have to compare the duck served here to the duck served at bouchon. 

Last but not least the dessert with the signature chocolate mask was extremly fun to eat and interesting as a piece of art. It was a chocolate dessert with this japanese mask that was edible. Really cool! Really tasty... haha

Alright tired of typing. This is really a great spot try to grab that table by the waterfall with the $2000 min hahaha It's really beautiful.",UIdROvjyMfhoKhJ-Giuxpw,2,0,5,lDpn5YZ0hXVzv5WKa97jzQ

        Mizumi took over the OKADA spot, above Tryst Nightclub, a beautiful place, the entire restaurant offers stunning views of Mizumi's private gardens, koi pond, and waterfall. You can enjoy the delicious aromatic coming from that Mizumi's teppan room. 

        During CES 2014, I couldn't get the table with the view because it was a last minute and we did like 2, 3 dinners per night with all our clients and vendors. I ended up at the bar instead.

        Mizumi was named ""Best Chef on The Strip"" by Vegas Seven, Chef Devin Hashimoto uses his fresh approach to Japanese robatayaki, teppanyaki and sushi at Mizumi. 

      Love the sake menu Daiginjo Junmai was delicious and well-priced selection. 

- Otoro $30 

- Uni $18

- Abalone $20

- Kanpachi 

- Sake with green salsa sauce 

- Maguro with 24K gold flake

- Hamachi Jalapeño Gelée 

- Hamachi kama - this was odd, that it wasn't in the fish head itself, but the meat has been removed to serve. I'd be perfect if  the meat was still intact in the yellow-tail head. 

-Octopus carpaccio - this was so tender, tangy and quite nice. 

- The pork belly - was just perfectly cooked, crispy skin just how we liked it. 

- Marbled American Wagyu shortrib $65, kabocha puree, confit matsutake mushrooms, chestnuts, red wine miso sauce, cooked sous vide for 72 hours, is melting in your mouth goodness. 

      Service at the bar was off. Can't just blame it on CES 2014, we had to waive down our bartender a few times to get water refill, and ordered more sake. Price point was reasonable to the quality that they serve here. It's good, but I still prefer Blue Ribbon at Cosmopolitan as my number one sushi place in Las Vegas, to follow by Yellowtail at the Bellagio. 

      However, if you can score the table with the view here, it's quite romantic and such a great date spot!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,11,8,4,etMC9vUGaW46EDkWTW6liA

5697766,2014-11-05,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"One of my favorite restaurants at the Wynn! I used to be a frequent visitor of this restaurant when it was Okada and just came here for the first time after the restaurant became Mizumi. I realized that a lot of customers now enjoy their traditional Japanese food, but I am such a big fan of teppanyaki, I couldn't help but sit at the teppanyaki tables!

Between a party of two, we shared:

Oysters: Half a dozen of really sweet and fresh oysters! 

Oh Toro, Chu Toro, Giant Clam, and Sweet Shrimp sushi - everything was amazingly fresh. I personally though the Oh Toro was too fatty for my taste. I will be sticking with Chu Toro and normal Tuna from now on. The sweet shrimp sushi was amazing. They usually have live amaebi as well, where they fry the heads, but they ran out that night. =( 

One of my favorite sashimi is lobster sashimi! We got a whole lobster of sashimi and it was seriously too much food for two people! It came out in a wonderful presentation and it costed $98 for 1.5 oz! 

For teppanyaki, I don't think much has changed from Okada.  A lot of the chefs have worked there for close to 10 years. I have tried the Kobe beef before, but this time, I just got the Surf and Turf. I believe it was $145 per person. It came with a lot of steak and lobster. There were two options for beef: either sirloin or tenderloin. I personally liked the sirloin better. The beef was really tender. There was SO much food. We basically took an entire order of the Surf and Turf to go. MY FAVORITE PART WAS THE FRIED RICE. SOO GOOD!!

if you come here know that it is in the wynn hotel and you should expect to pay more than your average spot. compare the price to other restaurants in the wynn or just what you pay for sushi in a hotel period and i think this place gives you so much more of an experience and is very much worth the price.

We were seated at a great booth with probably the best view of the waterfall you could possibly have.  Our server was ok.  She seemed a little frazzled but attentive enough (although a good server should not show stress at this level of dining).

We ordered a bottle of champagne for the table and when it came, it was warm.  If you're going to spend a good amount of change on a bottle of champagne it better come to you palatable.  We informed them of the issue and the sommelier gave us excuse after excuse.  I understand that you don't want to have to comp this but it's not like we were doing anything shady.  The champagne was warm.  

A second sommelier came by with the second bottle that they had chilled on ice first (which they made sure to tell us multiple times) and it was better.  Although, I do think that they made a bit of a show out of it because the dude FILLED the bucket to the very very brim full of ice.  Now you're taking it a bit too far.  One thing that bugged me was that our champagne glasses were empty, the server did a quick drive by but never refilled them or even came back on her own.  Apparently it was time to ignore our table.

We ordered our appetizers first before the entrees and I'm sure glad we did because after we ate them and finished our champagne we left.  The food was so underwhelming.  The yellowtail with jalapeno gelee was not flavorful.  The lobster miso left a strange taste in my friends mouth and a few hours later she felt her stomach hurting.  The sushi was HORRID!  No distinguishable flavors (we couldn't even tell which was which) and the rice was overcooked, soggy, and flavorless.  We also didn't even receive some of the items we ordered, like the bone marrow.

5825486,2018-03-23,0,EZQESVzkOPs7LwCHVC3Szg,"I have loved Wynn for over ten years since we first visited. 
But they renovated and got rid of many good restaurants (such as Boterro and Society Cafe). Their Japanese restaurant was also one of the restaurants they got rid of.

Their former Japanese restaurant OKADA was much much better in decor and also menu.

Mizumi (if this is still regarded as Japanese restaurant) Decor became so cheesy and loud that is lack of elegance. 
now it looks like one of a Chinese restaurants.

No elegance in decor but just ""red"" everywhere. 
Sushi chefs wear red caps (that warned me something wrong here). 

Don't take me wrong. I love red, especially red decor of Ancore lobby floor BEFORE they renovated!
It is a mystery why they got rid of the gorgeous red (chandeliers and many of exquisite decor) that made Ancore so special. Somehow they painted everywhere in white that made them look cheap now....

Anyway, their Sushi-raw fish display didn't look impressive judging from selections and how fresh it looks. I looked around and checked Sushi plates on the tables, too and decided to pass raw fish this time.
 
We were assigned best view sheet in front of the waterfall and that was maybe the price we had to pay.

The food was nothing ""wow"", creative or exquisite.

Kobe beef 2oz (yes, 2oz not 20oz) for $110 was especially disappointing despite of our high expectation because of the price (wouldn't you expect something totally amazing for that price for that portion?).

I had many Kobe beef before but this was the most ordinary taste (didn't even taste like the best) and the most expensive one.

We also ordered beef tartar and fillet (US beef) that was good but nothing like ""wow you can't get this anywhere else!"".
Honestly Kobe beef we got didn't taste any better than these US beef (though there was more fat).

They took so long to serve everything even though it was half empty at 5:30 on weekday.
They also didn't care about what to serve at what timing. We ordered one roll and bowl of rice that came in between meat dishes so we sat there eating only rice for half an hour.

We could have ordered more but became full as we waited so long between each dish. We left full but weren't ""satisfied"". 

Also, Asian Sake pourer with suit on (sommelier?) didn't show courtesy at all and made us feel uncomfortable (is that because we didn't order most expensive Sake bottle I wonder?)

Go somewhere else if you want to celebrate special occasion and spend this much money ($300 for two without tip).
Just not worth the money.

Generally, Wynn/Ancore after renovation is disappointing. Many of nice things are gone and so is the knockout gorgeous atmosphere.

It's somehow downgraded now (compared to amazing ""before"") and it's such a shame. 

They should have kept their great restaurants and decor rather than spending money to make it ""less"".

So sad as I have truly loved Wynn/Ancore for

We were seated at a table with a beautiful view of the waterfall area and our server was incredible. She was attentive and sweet and definitely made our anniversary dinner special. 

I had researched the menu in advance and also read through all the Yelp reviews for suggestions on what to order. We decided on a few different items, both from the sushi and robatayaki menus. 

We started with the Mizumi roll and I was a little disappointed. All the ingredients sounded great together but the taste didn't live up to the expectation. It just didn't taste as fresh and flavorful as I had hoped. The lobster was a little chewy, but the rest of the ingredients seemed on point. My fella had raved about this roll, having been the Mizumi before, so even he was let down by it on this occasion. The brussel sprouts were good, albeit a little overdressed in balsamic vinegar. I still loved them. The highlights from what we ordered were probably the rice balls, pork belly, bacon wrapped enoki and another roll (I can't remember the name for the life of me) that I enjoyed a lot more than the Mizumi roll. I've had better versions elsewhere, but these were very tasty. My least favorite items were the sweet potatoes, shishito peppers and eggplant. I rarely meet a shishito pepper or eggplant dish that I don't enjoy, so these were particularly disappointing to me. 

We ended our meal with the Mizumi mask dessert. I had low expectations for this, since I mostly ordered it expecting it to be a good photo op over actually enjoying the dessert. It was tasty, but definitely nothing amazing. It did have a wow factor as far as presentation goes, though. 

Our anniversary was great, mostly due to the fantastic company and excellent service, but the food was just ok on this visit. I am interested in trying more of their menu options another time, but I'd likely skip most of what I ordered during this dinner. I have no idea if we just arrived on an off night, but I'd likely give them another whirl in the future.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,9,3,RuIwHjZwthZ8MC0QrYW3-A

Got seated in front of beautiful man made waterfall it was very serine.

Their sushi and sashimi menu from the best of around the world I knew I had to try them.  They didn't disappoint me at all.

Some of the exceptions were: sweet shrimp from Alaska were plump firm and sweet as can be; my favorite mirugai as good as if I had it from Tsukiji market and I've had many from there. I usually don't care for salmon but they were exceptional ""Organic Wild from Scotland""! You must try some.  Finally their Albacore and Sea Urchin from the best of Santa Barbara's coast as usual best as can be!!

My wife not the raw sashimi person had yaki-nigiri and robatta yaki set they were all very tasty and grill with flavor and the aroma were priceless.
With out going around the world our local boy from Hawaii Head Chef Davin Hashimoto as I can see doing very well, although he was off with his kid this night, my compliments to the chef.

If it wasn't for my nephew Ryan mentioned his classmate as chef here, he had dinners with his classmates the previous night, we would've missed this place.

It made our stay here at Wynn complete
Would definitely come back again and again!",YXGttwvd4mNIfYBO2cHc0Q,1,1,5,EyntVf1MfeaecK-UPN0DhQ
