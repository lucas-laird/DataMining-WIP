1151563,2017-11-30,0,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,First time eating at Farmer Boys and I would say it was okay. I ordered the Patty Melt with a side of chili. The Party Melt wasn't bad. It was cheesy and nicely done. The fries were not bad either. The problem was the chili. It was cold and tasteless. No spice at all. My friend had the pastrami sandwich was also pretty good. Service was friendly and manager walked the restaurant to ask about the food. I still prefer Wendy's but I will give FB another try again.,vLAYtY8GWMBkDLrLW7wu7Q,0,0,3,3Cplc1UVM1XV1VrZTqR0sA
1264251,2014-12-21,0,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,"I went here for a quick meal with a co-worker. She swears by the breakfast at this place, but we were there for lunch. And I was not disappointed.

There is a fairly limited menu, but you can add and subtract ingredients, so there are lots of choices. I had the Natural burger, which was touted as being ""vegetarian-fed steer beef, hormone-free and antibiotic-free."" It was a little pricier than my friend's cheeseburger, but to quote Sam Jackson from ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""this is a tasty burger."" I added bacon and cheese, and ditched the 1,000 Island. Nice combo. And I loved the soft potato roll that it came on. So far, so good.

We didn't order sides because the burgers were filling enough. And I am not a fan of Pepsi products, so I tossed my Diet Pepsi and got an iced tea instead. But from what I had, this place is going to be on my short list for burgers. And from what my friend told me, it might be on my short list for breakfast as well.

And thank you, Farmer Boys, for listing the calorie counts on your menu board. Even though we all know a burger isn't the healthiest choice in the world, at least we can make a decision as to how much meaty goodness we want to ingest!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,n0NBkg5Zo7Q5wjuuA6_1gA

I actually drove back to the restaurant with my half eaten cold burger and asked for a refund. I was starving and hadn't eaten anything all day. One would think this would make the burger exceptional. It only made me want to kill someone for the waste of my time.

I was with a co-worker who ordered a hamburger to go and I ordered a salad to go.  His hamburger took 17 minutes before we received it. I question the time taken for the hamburger.  I was told he ordered after me, but that wasn't reflected on our receipts.  My cobb salad was missing my eggs and was half a salad.  I order these salads all the time.  I know what they are suppose to look like.  The waitress apologized and said they had new employee.  She said she noticed the salad looked different, not very much lettuce.  I replied to her, why did you serve it to me then?  She should have  sent it back to have it redone.  She asked me if I wanted to send it back.   It had already been almost 20 minutes I wasn't about to send it back now.  I was very disappointed and they have probably lost me as a customer at this location.  Their manager was helping the cook and saw me talking to the waitress for a long time and never bothered to approach me to see what was wrong.  I called another location and asked for the district manager number and attempted to call her but the number was incorrect.

There was no line at the time so I walked right up and ordered. The cashier was very friendly and patient as I stared at the menu without an inkling of what I was going to order. Finally I settled on the all natural cheeseburger with guacamole as bacon. I made it a combo and to complete my fat kid desire, I upgraded my fries to chili cheese fries (no judging it was cheat day and cold outside!) before I knew it my food came. Hot, fresh and tasty! It was like eating a home cooked meal. I will definitely be going back and I'll do my best at trying something new but that burger is going to be hard to beat for quite some time.",1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,0,1,4,PQnyJ__vdYCt5sa98MS13w

 Sandwiches are a great option if your not wanting a hot plate. I haven't been disappointed yet!",CmaFYyhgk8DJBxHFND0jGw,0,0,5,QiRC8lRLajJ7ukCa-efwjg

Burger was okay, but the onion rings were horrible. Had like a sandpaper batter with a huge slice of onion. Would not come again!!!",Rpd-KbHU5PAbdWmdIM94Gw,0,0,2,MENABOjUFeu-PM7wW7IJKw
5339551,2014-01-19,0,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,Farmer Boys serves up some good tasting burgers and fries at this Las Vegas location. The food was freshly prepared and the restaurant itself was clean and well-maintained inside. Service was friendly and efficient. It's nice to see a chain restaurant that actually cares about their customers.,uZLORfX8rLDLrfOXN4vvFQ,0,0,4,k-wW92j47-U2moKviRDPNA

5556773,2017-11-16,2,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,"You know the Cheers theme song where ""everyone knows your name?"" A server named Roxie definitely knew always knew my name and my order.  I thought maybe because I come here a little too often on my lunch break from work, but you can tell she knows a lot of her customers names and order.  

Overall customer service here has improved greatly and everyone is friendly and attentive as soon as you walk through the door.   
 
If I'm craving breakfast food, I order their skillets and if I want typical lunch food, I normally order the BBQ ranch chicken salad.  Be aware, the salad bowls are huge and enough for 2 to share. Their ranch is made daily and addicting ! 

As for the food, lots and lots of breakfast and lunch option.   Be sure to check out their daily specials. I would also recommend downloading their app so you can get rewards and points for dining here",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,1,2,4,jc9nrGkcN7hwpjOsjws58w
5663569,2017-11-01,1,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,"While I have always liked farmer boys, I have noticed recently that many of the items they advertise do not look like the item you actually receive. It is time for consumers to stand up to restaurants and demand that the item ordered looks like the item they receive. Case in point is the recently advertised double chili cheeseburger.  The Add Looks Great Lots Of Chili On The Top And Bottom Of The Sandwich With Some Pickle And DICED onion. The First Time I Ordered This You Could Barely Find The Chili And A Cook Who Was Seated IN The dining Room Said Yes It Only Has 1 Ounce Of Chili On it.  I took a pic of both the ad and the burger and sent an email to corporate.
They answered they will advise the store.
I ordered this burger again Sunday and received the same sad looking chili burger, when the server brought it I said where is the chili?? She did not know what to say, I said please take it back to the kitchen and bring me a burger that looks like the picture.  She returned with a nice chili burger. I have decided to start telling the waitress at any restaurant I go to, to prepare my food as pictured.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,2,2pMvs9R673DdF01resK6-g

The first thing they told me sounded perfect so that's what I got. My wife saw something and the lady described it making it sound so good and my wife decided to get that. 

Such a great first experience, awesome customer service and the food is so good! 

We will be coming back for sure!",N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA,1,0,5,hjiIxj81htNeUfAuqCM1Iw

Did not know what to order.
The food was pretty good.
Hamburgers were big and looked nice when it came out.
We had the fries covered with the chili.
Over all it was not too bad. We would probably go back sometime, For being a fast food place is was not bad.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,2,2,4,xl9Xh2q52JGCjmLst_8cNg
5877025,2012-09-18,0,5l-yKN13VwfPwuSiBIqdJQ,"I was Halloween shopping across the street and my GF suggested we give this place a try as ""I love them their food is so much better than a fastfood chain restaurant"" As she works for a Burger Restaurant  I was skeptical but agreed thinking I would tell on her the next time I see her boss.  Your secret is safe though I agree 100%. 

The food was top notch; the service was great and she was correct it mixes in the best of a fast-food chain and a mom & pop sit down restaurant.  The menu is a bit much for them to specialize in anything but specific but my burger was done correctly and the onion rings were top notch. 
It was hot so I decided to grab a Strawberry frosty/shake and it was delicious and had plenty of fruit chunks mixed throughout the cup;  (just wish they didn't get stuck in the straw)

All in all the price was a little high but for the quality of the service and the food I won't complain about it and say you get what you pay for and if you are comfortable with another chains discount/$1 menu by all means go for it but please give these guys a try; you may just start skipping those other chains and saving up to eat here.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,0,4,asYiwRSG18hgBONfn1LnrQ
