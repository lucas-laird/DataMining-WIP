I got a large chicken and corn soup since I wasn't feeling well and it was $5.95 for a giant portion that will be great for leftovers. 

I also got the orange chicken which came with rice, a couple pieces of broccoli, and two crab rangoons. The amount of food is enough for two meals for me and with the soup it could turn into three! It was about $13.00 when tax was all said and done.

The food was ready quickly as I ordered it through the yelp app. It was very hot and fresh. My only complaint is my orange chicken wasn't spicy even though I ordered it that way. I had sriracha at home so it wasn't a big deal, but some more spice would be awesome.

The fried rice was good, not great but I liked it. The chicken corn soup was more like eggdrop soup with a few pieces of corn. The spring roll was eh at best along with the grab Rangoon.

The restaurant was clean and our server was nice, but it was, overall, not a place I'd return. I think the lower stars are just about right.

Upon entry, we saw a sign listing the ""Daily Specials."" It was adorned with a Christmas theme... it's almost April.

The food was okay. We had the Tom Kah soup. It tasted good, but seemed to lack the coconut cream common in other renditions we'd tried. The main problem, though, was that the ladle that came with soup barely fit into the serving bowl. The bowl was pretty with its lit fire, but just not very user-friendly.

I ordered the Pad Thai. Their entries are huge and are good for 2-3 meals, but the dish lacked flavor. I couldn't taste peanuts or cilantro. Peanuts were served on the side in a densely-packed (hard to sprinkle) take-home container.

1935627,2018-06-10,0,ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w,"One of the better ones in North Las Vegas. But that doesn't say much for the restaurant though. 

My wife and I came for dinner and had:

Hot and Sour Soup - a run of the mill pre-cooked soup. Not enough ingredients in the soup. Taste is somewhat bland. 

Shrimp Lo Mein -  shrimps were large and the dish was well cooked. As usual, in many Chinese restaurants, shrimps have a bit of ""kerosene"" taste, which in itself is not terribly unusual as frozen shrimps have that taste often and the kitchen staff has to process it careful to rid of this taste.

Mu Shu Pork - excellent taste but the ingredients need to be adjusted. In general, mushroom should not be used as the dish will become watery. An egg should be stir fried into the dish to absorb some of the moisture. 4 large flour pancakes, probably flour tortillas,  accompanied this dish. These are quite large and thick - probably the pancakes are procured. It is not quite fitting to use tortillas for this dish.

All in all, it is a passable meal. Pricing is good. But then in this Valley, this is already one of the better ones.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,3,dMOERMtqRnem5vBuwOJi8w

I'm sure we're not alone in usually choosing the restaurant in closest proximity to home. For us that means ordering from China One, probably the most prolific chain in the region, but rather pedestrian in the food quality (worthy of no more than 3-stars). The next closest to home is Grand China. We went there twice (the 1st and Last time -- no likey!!)

Chinese food can vary significantly from one restaurant to the next. Not only are there regional differences between Szechuan, Cantonese and Mandarin recipes, but in ""Americanizing"" the dishes, the styles differ from east coast to Midwest to west coast. Our preconceived tastes are Midwest centric, and that's hard to find in Vegas. Most restaurants here are either more authentic Chinese (in Chinatown) or west coast Americanized (the rest of the city/region)

Today, we ventured a few more miles out of the way to try Asian Wok. Whenever we try a new place we order big....testing the dishes we tend to like best in order to evaluate the quality. From appetizers to each entre', all were far better at Asian Wok compared to every other joint we've tried since moving here in 2012. 

Our order included Crab Rangoon, Potstickers, Happy Family, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork in Garlic Sauce, Chicken Egg Foo Young and Chicken w/ String Bean. My only complaint was that I felt the string beans were a bit over cooked. 

All in all,  we both decided this would be our restaurant of choice from here on in. By far, it's some of the best Chinese we've had here. We can't wait to try more items as we plan to explore more dishes in the future.",dcxKd_c_K5oRNZoOIstLIA,0,0,5,NK3A9KD4xCR-eIF8I5OjOw

First off, the order took 1 hr and 20 mins to get here. Then as we are opening our bag like a kid on Christmas with glee in our eyes and hunger in our bellies, having forgotten completely about how long it took to get here....I notice the greasy bags I keep pulling out one after another. Then, we realize we are missing our White rice but the grand finale of our unveiling was the BAG filled with SOUP that included the containers floating in it. Upon further review, I notice that one soup had melted through the container lid of the other and planted itself inside of it. 

Now... the food. It was cold, the rice was greasy (not even sure how you can pull that one off), the chicken in our Sesame and Generals was dried out so bad the dog rejected his favorite time of the night... table scraps. As a few other reviews stated, the Egg Roll tasted weird, like some alien meat stuffed into a paper towel then rolled up.  As for the soup... No idea, no one in the family was willing to stick a straw in the bag to try it.

Go with the basics. Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pad Thai. Those are ok. 

I have tried the following and don't recommend them. 

Tom Yum soup. Shrimp was way over cooked and also I know what shrimp should smell like and the soup smelled a little too fishy which means they weren't so fresh. It's a very basic soup not enough mushrooms, or other ingredients. They were very scarce. And super spicy doesn't mean flavorful! Just like putting in a ton of salt doesn't make it taste better. 

General tsaos chicken... Made me sick 



I hate that this place is the okayest in the area. We need better options.

Delivery time was good. I was confused because I ordered online through beyondmenu.com and it looked like they charged me (I could see the charge in my online banking), but they ran my card when they arrived. I was worried about being charged twice and the manager was very nice about explaining what they were doing and told me to ask for him if for some reason I was charged twice. He assured me that I wasn't and as of now, I haven't been.

I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein dinner combo and an order of boneless ribs (about $20 due to delivery fee and taxes). The combo came with a crab Rangoon and a spring roll, choice of steamed or fried rice (I chose fried), and a choice of hot and sour soup or chicken and corn soup (I chose chicken). 

Crazy fast delivery. Then again they're only 5 minutes down the street. It took 30 minutes to arrive from the time I placed my order online. 

The noodles were very good, spring roll was delicious, and crab Rangoon gets a thumbs up. Boneless ribs were OK, I would maybe get them again.

What brought my rating down was the fried rice. It was so terribly bland! Some added soy sauce did the trick to make it edible but I was extremely disappointed. I would not expect such a staple of Chinese takeout to be cooked so poorly. I would trade the speedy delivery for more care on the rice in a heartbeat.

TLDR; Overall I may order from here again if I'm craving Chinese takeout, but I'll skip the rice and trade the ribs for some pot stickers or shrimp. If they up their rice game this would easily earn 5 stars.",4ET-N8pZ6rwBTOMe_74q1Q,1,0,3,ffFCadA4EEHfhLppPAllPQ

The wonton soup came in 2 little containers and the wontons reminded me of the kind that would come in my soup back in NY.

I also got 2 fried shrimp, 2 crab rangoons and 2 ""egg"" (really spring) rolls. The appetizers were what I expected. The soup had really good flavor.

Then I had combo fried rice which had really good flavor. The shrimp chow mein was alright. Not all that amazing and the Chicken and Broccoli was really good!

My only negatives were the chow mein and the fact that my order was lacking the noodles that you usually get with every order. They also make their own spicy mustard homemade and it was really good too!

I ordered ONLINE (which is awesome) and I drove over there. The place is really cute and clean inside. They had some tables and booths set up and some people were eating there.
