When you walk in, the pizza on display (the one they put in the oven for you) looks like it's been sitting there for 3 days. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! I got 2 slices of pizza and a drink and it came out to $18 and some change. I forced my self to finish the first slice which was burnt and had a funky taste but as for the second slice I tried to force it down but made it only half way ... I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",Iw67dyoT9nNU35zFkwwMeg,0,0,1,b3hhdHczxCzHNzYEWaIBwA

A lady by the name of Valerie helped me who was very knowledgeable of each pizza and helped me decide on a slice that would best fill my appetite. Her service was also very quick even was engaging in questions on how my day was going and if I had gone Black Friday shopping made me feel welcomed....If you're looking for a great dessert I highly recommend the Nutella soft serve came in a waffle cone with coffee cotton candy around it!

1314674,2016-12-10,0,eFsfPHkGGycHXCTyV8uFcg,"We were passing by and decided to check the place out. It did not disappoint.  Not only the pizzas are very good but the staff is very friendly. We met Joe the chef there and he told us all about the place, even offered us some samples of the beer and their delicious Wicked soft serve. It's something that combines taste with art. I w cream is served on a cone topped with a plate that holds an espresso infused cotton candy. Sounds crazy right? Well, you'll have to see it to get it. I forgot my phone that day but I'm sure you will find it posted. Look it up! Now back to the pizzas: you won't find the traditional topping; God knows everyone has those. This place offers pizza toppings that seem to come from actual dishes, whether the roasted garlic, chick peas or cauliflower. You feel like you are eating straight from a pasta dish and somehow it still seem to compliment a slice of pizza without seeming to be too much. The crust is very good and the sizes are larger than your average size. The decor is beautiful; most of it imported straight from Italy like the counter marble tops while still having a sort of an industrial look. Very nice especially for a tiny place on the strip. Check it out and make sure you ask for Joe; he would be happy to tell you all about it...",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,2,2,4,yg6r_qOetD6Fy_hbEayuKQ

1744107,2016-11-19,0,eFsfPHkGGycHXCTyV8uFcg,"I can honestly say that Wicked Slice is one of the BEST pizza places on the Las Vegas Strip. They have monstrous servings and they are very affordable! 

Wicked Slice is located at the Fashion Show Mall, right across the street from the Wynn hotel. Great note for all Fashion Show employees: 10% DISCOUNT! They have an awesome user friendly app too, so you can order and pay ahead of time if you're short on time. 

Their dough is hands down what makes their pizza so great. It's chewy and crusted with a generous amount of cheese. It's New York style pizza (the best kind) so it gets pretty messy. Their pizza menu has a great veggie pizza that has roasted cauliflower and mushrooms--A MUST TRY. They also have a pizza called Jurassic Meats, which is essentially a meat lovers dream! Wicked Slice also offers wings, sub sandwiches and salads. 

If you're ever shopping at Fashion Show and need a break, take your stop at Wicked Slice, YOU WONT REGRET IT.",Fpfw1dtekpW1beAH8T1cwQ,2,2,5,uLn--YPZlffigoQunLH0UA

2227532,2016-12-16,0,eFsfPHkGGycHXCTyV8uFcg,I knew when I bit into my slide that this was no ordinary pizza joint. I was transported back to NYC where the slices are gratuitously huge and flop over with the weight of hot cheesy saucy goodness due to the super thin crust. The ratio to sauce and cheese was perfect too. We got the pepperoni pizza because you can never go wrong with pepperoni let alone 3 types of pepperoni. They even sprinkle the crust with freshly grated Parmesan. The owner was super personable and offered us their ice cream which was a reason to come to this place on its own. Great location!

The toppings sound interesting, but the execution is poor. I got the Roma White or something like that and the chicken cutlet on it tastes like it had been deep fried 2-3x, so that there was no chicken left on the inside, just an overly greasy shell of bread crumbs. Very strange. 

The garlic on the pizza was good though.... and the employees are nice. That's about it. So yeah, convenient and pricing per slice is decent if you happen to be walking by, but definitely not somewhere I would go out of my way for.",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,1,1,3,06q4RW9lrK4rzff7pmMtAA
