Service was very slow. It's pretty bad when you have to wait 10 to 12 minuets to get a draft beer when your table is right next to the bar! It took over a half hour to get our food and the place was not even crowded! Not coming here anymore!!",d57AQS_l1uvpHSViGXFAiQ,0,0,2,-fhTkkDQIJbKAad0a09aJQ

But tonight was the night that made me wanna write a review! To go to a business and hear employees complaining that you're there is almost enough to deserve one star! We ordered some Stella on draft.. We watched the bar and waited for them to start on our drink.. Then they took a pre poured glass of Stella out of the fridge and served it to us! Omg how long has it been in a glass, in the cooler?!?! Then someone else ordered beer, and we saw two glasses 50% foam/head, 50% beer! They sat for a while.. Then an employee poured two half glasses of foam and walked off.. He came back and combined the two and served them!!!!! Nuff said!",PUN9c8tpXasYShdo_o5pOQ,0,0,1,T9gdAoMebDetFegj1NCgZw
223124,2017-03-19,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"So I don't really know where to begin but I have been coming to this restaurant for a few years now since it's so close to home, generally I get good service. Never had a problem with the food or drinks... maybe a waiter/waitress or 2 will be not so customer service oriented but all in all decent service.  Well this last time proved me wrong.  Went to have dinner with my daughter in law and I am a Stripes member with TGIF so I let the waitress know I wanted to use some of my stripes to cover one of the meals ( nice perk) so at the end of it all I got the bill and noticed I was charged for both meals but at this point our waitress was no where to be found so instead of going round and round I decided to just pay for the bill and call it a night.  Well the next day I noticed that she did deduct my points for the meal BUT I was still charged for it. A little upset so I call the restaurant to speak to a manager and of course 2 days in a row and on all shifts the manager is conveniently ""unavailable"".  So I email corporate.   A week or so later I get a reply from corporate apologizing for the inconvenience and letting me know that a manager would be contacting me with 24-48 hours.  So it's been more than a week and STILL no call from the manager.  So I email corporate YET again and of course no response.  May not be a big deal to most people but how any of their customers have they done this to and will continue to do this to if no one complains or brings it to their attention.",rjQMO2qUa7ljpkDo-Wnovw,0,0,1,kZClk5n_er_Qi7QtEPO03g

It was not busy maybe 5 or 6 tables of people and I saw people just leave their table and the restaurant due to lack of service. Our server was good but the food was terrible and definitely not worth the price. My husband became violently ill shortly after we left and I assume it was the lobster as that was the only thing he ate that I didn't.,vXA7gwweJOdvH30lan57Zw,1,1,1,kp8cLEw1zMC3l_io9gmw9g

He will ruin your night even after you have paid/tipped and have left the establishment well over an hour. After a long dinner...only because food/wine took so long to deliver to table for a 4 top. I ordered for 3 more friends and 4 bottles of wine.... security was called on my brother and myself. For ""stealing an empty bottle of wine and a empty wine glass that was meant for a commemoration for the group experience. Usually I buy a bottle of wine and two glasses were given to me when doing so. I assured my brother taking the empty glass/bottle wouldn't be a big deal. About an hour later we were passing by the TGI's entrance on our way out of the casino and m brother waves and says ""by, and thank you for the good food"" when Joey starts behind him and says"" Hey! is that our glass? We can't give those away! Security!"" So while already on the way out....he calls security to escort us out....which none ever came. He just followed us all the way out of the casino accusing us of stealing a wine glass...how embarrassing...considering I felt so warm to my first visit to TGI's by being offered a wine glass for my first purchase of wine ever in my life. I will never return to the Sam's Town Casino TGI's or probably any other again ever. I'm a general manager who takes much pride in my job to establish a great relationship with each and everyone of my regular and new customers, so that if I ever left them feeling un-welcomed like I feel now, I would completely understand if they never returned again. I urge upper management to check tapes and see what kind of General Management you hire and train. Thank you and goodbye TGI's, consider me one less problem, and thief you will never have again Joey and TGI Fridays.",2-vN-geqm66n_AqHi8u1cw,0,0,1,GDRQXEv7ktXla2nzibzOwg

I had the spinach flatbread.  It was very tasty and actually made a nice meal.  I might add a smalls side salad if I did it again.

I was very impressed with the way everyone else's meal looked.... well, maybe not the burger so much...  it seems kind of small and the serving of fries was very tiny.  It's potatoes people!  Load em up!  Not expensive for the restaurant and makes the customer feel like they're getting lots for their money.  I love value!

Back to being impressed...  Even the kiddie meals looked good.  They had lots of options, mix & match sides.  One kiddie got grilled cheese & orange slices, which looked very yummy & she dug it!  The other got chicken fingers & fries, which looked like quite a bit of food.  He even shared a finger.

A couple people had steak & lobster, which looked surprisingly good for a chain.  Good looking sides on the dinner entrees all around...  sweet potato fries, tomato/mozzarella salad & tortellini.

The first round of drinks took too long, and simple water was forgotten and when asked about the water again, the server asked if we still wanted it. They were out of one item, which was understandable. The next time we were asked about drinks was when our food was almost finished.

Entree was the pecan-crusted chicken salad. We liked the mixed field greens, pecans and cranberries and the vinegarette dressing was perfect.

Most of our group had the endless apps , a go to choice by many. I had the steak and lobster with two sides... Their food was prompt and accurate; however, my order took 41 minutes. Not only was everyone else on their 4th appetizer by the time I received my food, it was not cooked as ordered. My fries were soggy with blood,  and the lobster tail was grilled from the outer layer and raw underneath. After bringing it up to the waiter's attention he just said he would take it back without any acknowledgment to the mistake or wait time.  Decided to bring it up the manager,PAUL,for constructive criticism and before I finished explaining everything he interrupted with ""the appetizers take a while"" . .. I don't know where he usually dines at or how long he's been in customer service but that's unacceptable. There is no way you can tell me that you'll serve the whole table until they can't eat anymore before putting in my order. I'm a paying customer, I shouldn't have to wait for the fourth round of endless apps to get my order. Another tip, before you give a customer a ridiculous excuse.... it wouldn't kill you to address the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Just $25 down the drain, if you're considering TGIF just make sure you're not hungry if you're ordering anything that doesn't fall under endless apps.",eNiGzIG27r9e6x_6eAwe4A,1,0,1,GFE1eUnl365LOgbH6I-mJA

Everyone was great! Jessie, Auntie Liz, Liz II and last but not least...Joe! 
We had Delicious Chocolate Martinis and took advantage of the endless appetizers... YUMMMM !!! 
We had pan-seared pork potstickers, sriracha boneless wings, Memphis barbecue boneless wings and barbecued chicken flatbreads. Very filling. Every item was delicious. 
We had a drink called ""Dark Sin"" made with Rumchata(which we had never tried). It was just what the doctor ordered! I recommend it highly!
We were surprised when they came out and sang the Birthday Song to Sherrie and gave her an ice cream sundae!
""Service with a smile"" should to be their motto! Everyone was smiling and very cordial.

Was not busy for a Friday yet the waitress seemed to always come up short. We had to ask for refills. Ordered the rib eye medium rare and it came to the table dry and over cooked. Upon the arrival of the food I could tell my steak was over cooked so I immediately cut into it to show the waitress. She then took it back and disappeared.  My boyfriend had to make eye contact with her in order for her to come to our table. She was talking with another waitress or hostess.  15 mins  past and  y boyfriend was done with his food so I said if my steak is not ready cancel the
Order.  She quickly returned with a steal -completely RAW! She asked to take it back AGAIN, to which I responded no thank you.  To take a steak back more than once says a lot!  The manager on duty (I hope he was a supervisor) then came and asked if I wanted him to take it back and 'fire it up' to which I said no. I told him I dislike having to send food back especially since it was the 2nd time. I honestly doubt that if I sent it back it would have helped, it only would have pissed off the chef.

1609426,2016-01-30,4,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch because we are staying at the KOA next door that's adjacent to the casino. We really wanted to get away from the smoky smell in the casino and we were lucky enough to get a booth far away from the entrance. Greeted by a friendly hostess and seated in a booth in the bar. 

Our server was prompt to come take our drink order and to my delight this part of the whole Sam's Town had Coke. Hubby ordered lemonade. The menu at TGI Fridays is pretty big so it took some looking to figure out what us hungry hippos were up for. Everything sounded amazing. 

I was disappointed the half sandwich build your combos were only available Mon-Fri, naturally. So I had to settle on an appetizer for my small appetite, or small stomach. Husband ordered the salmon Cobb salad and I had the spinach flatbread appetizer. 

Our server was very nice, he told my husband that the salad was his favorite although I wonder if they all say that, but he seemed sincere. Then my husband wanted to wash his hands before eating after being in the casino and he said there wasn't one in the restaurant he'd have to go back out into the casino. Odd not to have a restroom in a restaurant. But he brought us hand towelettes although my husband still hoofed it to the restroom. 

Then onto the food. Husband said his salad was amazing, salmon was perfectly cooked, not dried out, moist drizzled with balsamic vinegar, an abundance of greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, hard boiled egg, bacon, blue cheese and other veggies. Looked amazing and he cleaned his bowl which was a great portion. My flat bread was covered in cheese, spinach and diced tomatoes with just enough crispness to the crust to make it so it wasn't soggy as some flat breads are. Very flavorful and yummy.

The best part, Chad checked in when i started, middle of meal and end; inquired if i wanted dessert or anything like coffee etc... I declined..and he didnt just hand me a check like 98% of servers, he returned with the check later..50%+ tip for Chad... hope you read this because you were fanatstic as a server...",ytrwYqpYTQUiaIbIkntepA,1,0,5,_sS3r9WyqkZemxfmn3a0Ug

3000219,2018-04-02,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"Let me start out by saying that I LOVE TGI Fridays, and I'm sad that I have to even leave this review. 

I come to this location often because it's less than 4 miles from my house. The last three times I've been here have been awful.

The waiters are usually ok, nice the first time they come to your table. 

Then they never really check on you again.

Two visits ago, we asked for a menu for the ""endless apps"" which was $10 at the time. Someone I was with had just been there about a week prior and knew they had the menu. The waitress said something like ""I don't we have a menu for that, I guess I can check though."" and came back about 20 minutes later with the menu.

All the waiters know how slow the kitchen is, when we ordered endless apps the waitress literally told us she would put in 2 appetizers at a time for each of us so we didn't have to wait so long, which we still did.

Getting a drink refill is like pulling teeth, which is annoying considering how much drinks cost.

The prices recently went up for practically everything on the menu, and considering that this location can't even guarantee you fast service or warm food, I'm not sure it's worth it anymore.

Other things to note:
-The layout is awful. Just terrible. Some of the tables are at a weird angle where you feel like you should just stand up the whole time so you're less uncomfortable.
-They have ""free wifi"" which has literally not worked in 3 years. I get that you don't need to be on your phone during dinner, but there's no cell service since this area of Sam's is basically cement. I like showing my parents things from Instagram or Twitter sometimes when we're talking, and the wifi never works.
-The nearest bathroom requires you to walk outside the restaurant and into the casino. Not a deal breaker, but pretty annoying.
-It is so loud!!!! You can't hear ANYTHING someone with you is saying, even from right across the table.",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,0,0,1,BbhwLkWbnXoQEIIsD80Suw
3074268,2013-07-02,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"We always stay at Sam's Town when we visit Vegas, and so we usually start out our day by eating at TGI Friday's.  We have been going to the hotel for years, and remember when the space used to be the Harvest House, which was an old school coffee shop kind of 24 hour restaurant.  

So, we like to have breakfast but they don't have a lot of omelette selections, not very creative that is.  They have a special priced lunch menu, so one day this last trip I tried the special $5.99 cobb salad.  First of all, we waited over 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it, and when my salad came, it was a very small piece of chicken, a half of a hard boiled egg, and like a cherry tomato sliced in half.  My husband had ordered breakfast.  How long does it take to make breakfast?  

I said something to the hostess and she offered to give us a dessert for free, but all of their desserts look big and my husband is a diabetic and I'm on a diet (did you see the salad??) so I said ""No thanks.""  

We've been there other times when you basically have to get up and walk over to get your bill, get your bill paid, or get a drink refill.  The service is slow, but it never seems overly crowded in there.  Now on two occasions this trip, there was a large party in the other room...and everyone was working on them.  

Also, I guess is the case with the chain's restaurants, the booths and the seats are not super comfy.  The turkey burger on the special lunch is pretty good, and it comes with homemade potato chips, which are good, if not fattening.  Most of the tables don't feel too crammed up against other tables and the restaurant opens up into the casino, which is fun if you are there to gamble.

Let's start off with the dirty table, the menus were sticky and the table hadn't been wiped down before we were seated. 
This place was empty, how was there 0 time to clean? 
Next, my beer glass was DIRTY, and it tasted flat. I paid $6 for it and didn't even drink it. 
The only thing that was good was the queso dip, should have just ordered that and left. 
I know TGI Fridays isn't a high class joint but I expect it to at least be clean!

And the fries, as far as the appearance of fries goes, looked pretty good too. An even cook with liberal seasoning. But upon first bite of each, I questioned whether or not this food was fresh. The fries were barely warm and the burger only slightly warmer. The gooey cheese I was looking for hardly gooed at all. The Jack Daniels sauce to drench the burger in had good flavor but seemed thinned by a liquid other than its name sake. Most dripped right off the burger by the time I finished it.

They have steak and lobster for $14 every day between 4 and 6 and $4 20-ounce drafts during the happy hour. Who Ops 2 with very slightly overcooked the stick was spot-on they have a tomato and mozzarella salad that I like the rest just pretty standard fare. But it is it good place to eat on a budget if you're in the casino I would not make the trip but if would not make the trip would not make the trip if I wasn't already in the area.,IoYDE-q9bSsVFcUtQOz7hA,0,0,3,17bYWFGazFPQ0zD8xKV9VQ

4903185,2014-09-28,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"Went here for dinner. I order the steak and lobster. My steak was supposed to be cooked medium and it came out medium-rare. My husband ordered the ribeye and lobster with bread sticks. His came out medium-well and no bread sticks.  We had other food but that was great! These were the problems. 

The waitress (which was awesome) didn't bring out the steaks. The person that did, didn't wait to see if our steaks were to our liking and both of them were wrong. My husband also asked if the bread sticks were coming out and the guy said he would check. Never saw him again. We had our 2 month old with us (first outing with baby) so we didn't want to send the steaks back and wait for fear baby would wake at some point and disrupt the restaurant. So, I ate the part of my steak I could and my husband who is definitely a red meat eater suffered through his over cooked meal. The waitress came back around and asked if all was good and my husband explained the situation.  She said she would get right on the bread sticks. At this point we were almost finished and didn't need the bread. 

She came back to the table said she checked what she put in the computer to make sure she hadn't made a mistake and the bread would be right out. My husband told her we didn't need it now. She said she would take it off the bill and we could take it home and she would send the manager to the table. 

This is why this gets 4 stars. Kim (I hope that was her name), the manager, is amazing. Although, she was really busy doing other things she really took her time with us. Not only did she LISTEN to us about our meal issues, she took the the time to have a CHAT about other things, like the baby. This might have been a way for us to not leave angry but it sure felt genuine. In the end our bill was greatly reduced.",rRuFzqkOHv3daWl_Fh126A,2,1,4,IJTpTkytRCQ4x1LOk3fNlw

The whole experience was just negative.  Our waitress didn't know what the vegetable or soup of the day was, our order was wrong, AND the other table's order was wrong too.  On the upside, we made some new friends with the other diners.  On the downside, the topic of conversation was the crapiocity of our dinner.

5321982,2014-03-05,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"Had dinner at the Sam's Town location on Tuesday night with my wife and daughter.  Wasn't sure what I was hungry for, but my daughter ordered herself a wedge salad with a side of sweet potato fries.  My wife and I wanted to split an order of the fried green beans.

My wife decided she wanted the ribeye steak with shrimp because the picture looked good, and I agree, in the menu the picture looks very good.  I was going to go with the burger and bottomless fries for $10, but decided that the steak looked so good that I'd have what she's having.  

My daughter got her salad and fries very quickly.  The salad looked okay, since it was 90% plain iceberg lettuce it's hard to mess that up.  She also liked her fries and said they were good.

Our green bean fries arrived next, and I was so disappointed.  I remember getting these before for around $6 and you good a fairly decent amount of beans.  This time they were about $8.50 and there was a modest amount of green beans.  I was frankly shocked at how few beans there were.  I will say though, they were hot, crisp, and delicious.

Our steaks came next.  The best thing I can say about them is that they were cooked properly, mine medium and my wife's medium well.  We got the shrimp scampi, which for some reason came on a barbeque stick and looked grilled...hmmm, I thought scampi was baked in garlic butter sauce.  Also, while I know I'm not high-class, I hate having to peel my shrimp to eat them.  I find it unappetizing and then you're left with the matter of where to put used shrimp shells - not fun.  The Parmesan cheese fries were tasty, but there were only about a half dozen of them.  The vegetables were terrible, I thought they had been soaked in vinegar - awful!  The problem with that is that the vinegar soaked into everything on the plate affecting the taste of everything negatively.  I thought it was just me, until my wife spoke up about how strong the vinegar flavor was.  I felt relieved that it wasn't just my tastebuds acting up!

The namesake steak was flavorful, but quite gristly and fatty, although I know and expect some of that from a ribeye, I guess at $24 bucks each I expect better - hell I could have gotten Fillet Mignon for $20 at Billy Bob's in the same casino.  

When asked how we like our dinners we commented that the vinegar taste was displeasing and inquired what part of the meal included vinegar, or if it was a mistake.  The waitress said she would go into the kitchen and inquire.  She returned a few minutes later with the bill.  Never said one word about the vinegar taste, I looked at my wife, and we agreed we weren't going to get any answers from this server.  

Very disappointed in this dining experience, and it especially burns as the bill came to $85 including tip.  I struggle to think how this restaurant can survive when you can get a much better meal, and service, from at least 3 other restaurants in the same damn casino!",fsLjz-J6Wqim0AR-hKFX4w,1,0,1,scxRpx2q8N3_QnvbpScaTQ
5390400,2012-07-23,3,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"Yeah, 4 stars.  I don't quite understand how this is possible myself.   I almost stopped myself from doing this review considering the ridicule and shame this could potentially bring to my Yelp name.  Ultimately the truth has to be told, and if I'm the one who has to say I had a 4 star experience at the TGI Fridays in Sam's Town, then so be it.

So it was Sunday, and I sat in a booth at the bar waiting for my friends to arrive.   First thing I noticed was that Happy Hour prices are in effect ALL DAY on Sunday in the bar and dining area (TGIS).   Good start to the visit, but I figured maybe their happy hour was limited to bottles of miller lite and some sugar loaded kool-aid tasting drinks.  To my pleasant surprise they had 20 oz glasses of Guinness for $4.  Hmmmm, this is turning promising.  All appetizers except the platters?  $6.  I started questioning why I'd never been to a TGI Friday's for happy hour at this point.  Friends finally arrived as I was finishing my first Guinness (3 more would follow), and we ordered the following appetizers throughout our visit:   Pretzel sticks with cheese and bacon sauce, Spinach dip, Hummus plate, Cheeseburger sliders, Some chicken bites thing, and potstickers.  I've seen several reviews mentioning poor service but our experience was anything but poor.  Adrian kept the drinks flowing and the food came out at reasonable times throughout the entire night.  As for the food, it was all good for what it is.   I don't expect the Hummus to rival that of a great mediterranean and it certainly didn't, and the sliders didn't make me forget about Bachi Burger, but if you're fine with sodium and calorie laded comfort food that tasted better with each frosty beverage, you might enjoy yourself as much as I did.  

Splitting the bill amongst our entire party I think we ended up spending about $25 a piece which I thought was an incredible value (though I'm sure my doctor would disagree).",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,fr2EbOLLXFZvI5w9SrrS-g
5513399,2013-02-03,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"I have been here a few times now, and this review is just for the bar.  It is a nice little bar  in Sam's Town.  It's crowd... well if you want to call it a crowd... seems to be 30's and above.  I guess that is what you get when you are in a casino really made for the locals.  So, I have no complaints as my friends and I are in its wheel house.  So here were my observations.

 - We walk in and were given a friendly greeting as we sat at the bar.  The bartender put down drink napkins and took our order.  I stuck with club soda while everyone else in our group planned on pounding beers that night.  So, the bartender said that it was great that I was the designated driver and comped my drinks. The drinks were a little pricier than they were at the casino bars in Sam's Town but that was expected.

- They have a pretty nice set up.  Plenty of seating and a pool table that didn't get used by us that night.  As a matter of fact, I didn't see anyone using the table.  

- We got there early so I don't know if things picked up after we left.  But, while we were there we were taken care of very well.  It was nice to just catch up with and watch my friends get their buzz going.

So, after a few drinks we left to walk around the casino.  One of my friends loves the show in the Atrium.  Personally, I think it's not that great but to each their own.  Maybe it's better if you are buzzy.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,0,0,5,skQ2T0YJETy66unqdQlPwA

Let me just say the tacos were fantastic. And not just for TGIF's, but in general. Great flavor and had a slight kick to them which I loved. The rice on the other hand, which looked good, was bland beyond reason. It looked like there was cilantro on top and peppers mixed in the rice but there was absolutely NO FLAVOR.

5837373,2011-07-05,0,GUaPe4gw5KhihfPPqhtSIA,"Upon viewing the new menu, I was happy to see that pan-seared Pot Stickers have returned as an appetizer at the TGI Friday's at Sam's Town. My wife and I received a good greeting upon our arrival, and all restaurant employees we encountered were very friendly. I showed my Stripes card and was told that all Stripes members can have free tortilla chips and salsa if they wish, as an appetizer. So, we made such a request, and this complimentary dish was quickly produced. Unfortunately though, the red and tan tortilla chips were lukewarm and served with unmemorable, very mild tomato salsa. But they were free (although mistakenly charged on our initial bill until that was corrected), so I have no cause to complain! 

I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade after our server recommended this beverage to us. After a wait of about 15 minutes, and far after my companion's Sprite had already been placed on the table, I had to ask again for this to be produced. Then the server RAN to the bar before taking our food orders, and returned quickly with the drink. Although the lemonade contains no alcohol, we were told that it is prepared by a bartender, which caused the delay. Refills are provided--but at 50 cents a pop. The beverage itself projected a rich strawberry flavor, but not to the degree of the Strawberry Lemonade served at Red Robin or southern California's Tony's Spunky Steer restaurants that includes several large fresh half-strawberries in the beverage. A requested refill was accommodated fast. 

Our leather booth was comfortable to sit in but the wood grain on the edges of the table top was worn thin by continual customer use. The restaurant, situated on the casino floor, has a very dark woodsy appearance, with a Las Vegas theme incorporated in the wall hangings. 

Pot Stickers were very good but not quite hot enough for all 6 pork-filled dumplings to retain the heat in time for dipping in the Szechwan-flavored sauce. The same lack of robust heat was true of the French Onion Soup, the broth of which was not as flavorful as I recall enjoying previously at many other TGIFridays locations. The Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta I ordered was suitably hot and rendered very spicy by a generous application by the chef of Cajun Butter sauce. For the most part this entree tasted very good, with tender cooked shrimp and supple hunks of white chicken. But one piece of gristle and a small bit of shell struck discordant notes in my mouth. The portion was huge, and almost half of the dish was taken home for a hearty lunch the next day. Meanwhile, my spouse enjoyed Friday's Shrimp that was lightly battered and cooked just right except for one spicy-tasting shrimp that likely got too close to someone else's order of Firecracker Shrimp. Announced in the menu as a dozen shrimp, she actually counted 13 plump shrimp on her plate. This was another generous serving; 4 shrimp were packaged for home. 

Although there were a few miscues, overall this was a good dining experience, and we plan to come back again.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,2,2,3,H7uYEXB8mCeGA4WPBzuVGQ

The restaurant was slow and quite which is nice for a morning in Vegas. Coffee was served in big coup cups with soup spoons.
The breakfast special for $3.99 included two eggs, 2 strips of bacon, hash browns and toast. I liked everything but the shredded hash browns had a little 'off' flavor. I couldn't put my finger on it but i didn't care for them. They just seemed to greasy and crusty. The eggs, bacon and toast were typical. The price on the menu was $5.99 but if you ask for the special, you can get the $3.99 price. We'd eat here again.",ik8jj86Tipn5HMA24YKHgw,0,0,3,JDDbMcug5Fi9sM1P1ySzQQ
