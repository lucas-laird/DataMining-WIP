We ordered a combo that included a little of everything and added an order of prime Kalbi. Plenty of delicious food for 3 adults with moderate appetites. The portions aren't huge because of the amazing quality of meat they serve so if you have a lumber jack appetite, plan on spending a little more. Used a Groupon for the whole meal that would have cost around $50-$60 (not including drinks)
5 Stars for food
4 Stars for price (without the help of a Groupon of course)
And FYI to wheelchair-bound patrons, the seating is all booths. Unless you can transfer to the booth, don't plan on getting under the table. The design of the table doesnt allow a chair to pull in at the end. Plan on bringing a laptray to eat off of. A little inconvenient but so worth it.",LVjbgxwYGAeCXlaUY6Myew,0,0,4,2iuNGigwC2EMU0Cka-pXKg

We ordered the dinner ""B"" I think it was around 39.00 and there was chicken, shrimp, different beef cuts, sushi, salads, soup, dumpling's food just kept coming! I am glad I didn't get more of the Wagyu. My crazy daughter didn't like it and was cooking it to death (I traded her the flank). My total bill didn't even total 50.00. I love grilling my own food to my doneness and the sauces were great. I took home a lot of leftovers and even had pineapple sorbetto for dessert, Very delicious. For the quantity and quality of food this place is really awesome. It was a little quiet when we went, but we were there right when they opened on a Thursday evening. Personally, I like that. I also like that they didn't hover over us, just unobtrusively removed empty plates and filled our glasses as need be. Wonderful experience.",GZI0VPDn2FXvq-SQJckrTg,1,0,5,8CS_xiPVeJ3EDmLhi9X8Dw

Flavor was awesome.  The yakiniku sauce was great.  I kinda wish they had brought out a container of it or something though, as the little dipper was a bit lacking.  I had the Kalbi and Pork Belly.  Both were very nice cuts, that cooked up well, and paired great with the sauce.
Girlfriend ordered mixed mushroom platter.  She didn't like the big ones (Eringi) but I enjoyed them, and the others I tried.  She had the tofu salad as well, and said it was good.  Not amazing, but good.
Not much else to say as I was going kind of cheap, but the booths were nice and comfy, and the barbecue pit was nice since it was cold out.

nothing matters when the food is amazing. the food is cheap in my eyes, the prime strip, prime kalbi are both wonderful. best prime tongue i have ever had. the fun part about the experience in this restaurant is that you cook your own food. they have the grill in the middle of the table, you cook your own food, they give lots of sauces, its an amazing experience.

First impression of this place, pretty cheesy menus because first of all they are hand written. Second they hand you about 5 different menus. You also have hand written specials with drawings on pieces of paper everywhere on the walls of the restaurant even the bathroom. After looking through all of their menus we had a few questions about items we weren't sure about so we asked the server.  The server had no idea what they were either and had to go back to the kitchen to ask them.

Even though the server didn't quite know the menu she was very nice and sweet. Food was pretty good nothing horrible but nothing spectacular either. The frozen beer was nice even though they ran out of kirin. Overall I probably will try other places first before going back to this place.",i6w0VfTvvvbPk6Rj2gsBdw,0,0,3,SQZNsHzWFf-VEMonMPNJ5w

I didn't come out smelling all smoky like the Korean BBQs so that's a plus.  But all I asked for was a few more lettuce leaves (they give you 3), seeing as I ordered 3 orders of meat.  1 lettuce leaf per order of meat???  The waitress brings me a plate with about 6 lettuce leaves and some carrot and cucumber.  Wow!  How nice.  Then the bill comes.  What is this Sanchu?  Turns out it's the lettuce, carrots, and cucumber.  Now I'm not asking for anything for free but $3.95 for 6 lettuce leaves 2 carrot sticks, and 2 cucumber sticks???  WTF!  The cost on that is like what--50 cents?  Or less???  So the waitress failed to mention this when I asked for ""a few more lettuce leaves.""  And when I ask her about it on the bill, she says everything is a la carte ""sorry for the confusion"" but I guess I'm still expected to pay for it because I ate it.   If everything is a la carte then why the 3 lettuce leaves with my orders of meat.  Anyway, enough bitching.

I'm not sure how this place is surviving, nor has such a high rate... I mean it was dead when i went there around 8pm.

Meat quality is embarrassing  to me especially people talk about  how Japanese food is good quality with simplicity, it puts that to a shame. 

Ton-toro ( pork belly fat) was just rough piece of fat, nothing like toro. 
Cow tongue was rough jerky meat, and everything else just falls into same category. 

Kimuchi and egg soup were both just flavor-less, even little different from real korean kimuchi, it should still have lil deeper flavor. 

Service= nothing to write about.

We also ordered the kimchi fried rice, which was very large. We did not finish it with two people. We left perfectly satisfied and not feeling disgustingly full.

We order their combo deal which had a bunch of different cuts of meat, including Beef Tongue, Prime Kalbi, some chicken Karaage, some sushi, some rice, some soup.......yah, a lot.  Great deal with some good quality meat.  We also ordered shrimp.....it was ok, stone pot bi bim bap....good but not great, and the pork toro......nothing special.  The Beef tongue was a little chewier than I'd like,but the prime Kalbi stole the show.  It totally melts in your mouth.  It was so good we had to order another order of it right after.

So glad that I was wrong. The quality of meat at Yagyu just surpasses every other restaurant we have been too. This is now our FAVORITE place to get Korean style BBQ. We have probably been to Yagyu more than 15 times =]

Menu & Pricing: 
They don't offer an All-You-Can-Eat option like they do at almost every Korean BBQ restaurant. But since my boyfriend and I can get away with only ordering 3 a-la-carte meat items and be completely satisfied, this is a much better deal for us. We always order 3 a-la-carte meat items & 2 bowls of rice.. which usually comes out to under $30 after taxes.

Our Favorites & Recommendations:
Kalbi
Pork Belly
Beef Tongue

Service:
Yagyu never seems to be super busy.. so we always get seated right away. And the service has always been good every time we have gone. So no complaints in the service department.

Wrap-Up:
Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. Definitely recommend fellow Yelpers to give Yagyu a try.",qjrcCHNOhdz26BXhFB1NiQ,3,2,5,mj1uis4XID5JqK-sGb9VQw

767137,2012-12-21,1,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"At last we decided to take a chance at trying this Japanese-esque yakinuku joint that we've eyed for some time and lo and behold we were not disappointed. Having rested up abit after check in, we headed over for a late dinner for two under extremely frigid temps near freezing...very un-Vegas like! Arrived around 10:30pm to a near empty interior however hidden away was the atypical urusai salarymen nomikai group hidden away in the back corner of the joint undoubtedly with intent. From start to finish we were serenaded by inebriated karaoke slash X Factor wannabes, was about to tell them that they missed that shop by 5 feet as literally there is a karaoke bar down the strip mall.

Anyhoooo, back to food. We ordered the yukke to start and hubby was fairly impressed by the freshness and color of the uncooked tartar, a rich pink-redness that did exemplify a higher quality level than what we preconceived. And from fellow Yelpsters as well as table peeking we stayed with the prime karubi cut, prime tongue as well as the inaptly named ""kobe"" plate as so agreed upon by Y-friend Godzilla X. Come on people get over this fixation on Kobe there is an abundance of duly deemed superior grade prefectural wagyu breeders, ignorance of such denies those cows their justice in the wagyu hierarchy. I myself prefer Miyazaki-gyu and Saga-gyu.

However we devoured both choices and then attempted to challenge our immune systems and stomachs with their horumon and mino selections or ""offal"" offerings. Also must say worth the sweat and anxiety! In fact the outstanding miso provided gave us flashbacks to some of the best horumon yaki places in Japan namely those gems hidden away in Atsugi where travellers drive long and far purposefully to partake in the B-gourmet shops that only serve miso laced entrails, oh why did the place not have lettuce to dip such a shame.

All in all it's far fetch to say Yagyu is the best in the west and as I've been blessed to have frequently the best in Tokyo, its no Kinryuzan, Kirakutei,  Yoroniku, nor even close in comparison to my BFF's yakiniku-ya Ryukaen (which is still the best kept 5 star secret in Tokes), but if the universe only included NV & AZ we will be back!",uny77jqxY9JDmZcK8bnISw,2,3,4,rIQtyxCyR5mDSGuh-Hlqyg

Miso Ramen - Ok, I heard that this was the best miso ramen in vegas so I checked it out. It was a flavorful broth, the noodles were cooked right, and there was ground pork, roasted pork, an egg, and veggies. But I do not agree that this was the best miso ramen in vegas. I've had all three of monta's ramen; tonkotsu, shoyu, and miso, and I have yet to find a ramen in this town that could be better than of Monta's three, even though Monta is a little stingy on the portions, IMO.

Gyoza - The free checkin special that came with the ramen. The outside was cooked well, and the filling was tasty, only it was a little bland, However, the sauce that came with the gyoza was salty so if you keep dipping your gyoza into the sauce, it balances itself out pretty well",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,2,0,4,hPqeMvI_D5KBjSNjuJaWRw

Although refreshing,  it is a modest product (5.0% ABV) that I drink only in a Japanese restaurant. But when it is served at 28 degrees, it is an interesting beer. Yagyu Yakiniku in Vegas has this elaborate, instrumented refrigeration system that ensures that the beer is at least 29 degrees. The overall experience of this nearly frozen beer was intriguing. It went well with their house made Kim Chi, ramen and Yakiniku dishes we had. Ice firmed all over the exterior of the glass, and there were glacial flows forming and shifting inside the glass. Interesting experience in that I would have thought hat he beer would yield almost no flavor, but grass and grain could be detected. A normally pedestrian beer made into an experience by how it was served. The food is very good. Both the Miso and he Shoyu ramen is outstanding.

If you rate less than 4 to this place, chances are you just don't like Yakiniku or don't know what it should be like. It is not only lucky for Vegas to have a Yakiniku restaurant, but Yagyu is also very good on its own scale!

Yagyu in LV is Juban in SF or Manpuku in LA, that is, where Japanese clientele gather when they crave Yakiniku. It's that simple.

And not only that.

They have tremendous menu items to choose from. Lunch at Yagyu is one of our favorite - If you haven't tried their Gyu-don (beef bowl) you should - THAT ALONE WARRANTS RETURNING VISIT.

Ichiza in the same building is good, but I would dare to say Yagyu is better.

Food: The food was in the decent to slightly above decent range.  I found the platters to be a great value and would like to venture beyond that.  The platters are a nice mix of proteins and japanese/korean appetizers. The Kim Chee veggies were nice, the Cali Roll/Miso a bit bland.  I would like to go a little further off menu sometime soon though. The meat was normal value, you can certainly get more at other places, higher quality at other places, but this did the job.

Fun Factor: There's a lot to enjoy here.  First of all the 29* Beer.  There's a digital thermometer that always reads the temperature. I'm not sure why, but I was endlessly entertained by the changing temp gauge.  Secondly, they give you very well laid out platters

Convenience: It's a big place so you can usually get in pretty quickly. Additionally, since you generally cook most of your own food the food does get there pretty quickly, which is nice esp compared to some of the other places in the center.

Ambiance: Definitely nice and clean.  When I was there, no music on and not terribly crowded so it seemed a bit sterile, but to be fair it was a fairly early Wednesday night.

Serivce: Service was best described as laid back. They were nice, but not terribly attentive after our original order.  Additionally, I was a bit perturbed because after the meal, I wanted to have a nice cold beer and hang and digest; and they pretty much immediately brought the check. 

Consequently, I enjoyed the place.  Nothing spectacular, but a fun idea and a great change of pace.  I'd certainly go again.  Cheers!",jcThqp8nGqJNsyxUcl4_kg,1,2,3,eeLnd7At6ucUcs8NNqesNQ

I've had two different waitresses over the course of my four visits and they were both very sweet and very nice Japanese girls who entertained my mediocre attempts at speaking and ordering in Japanese.  

The tables have the grill built into the surface top.  90% of their menu is prime cuts of meat that they serve that you cook yourself and then season and enjoy.  Where's the fun in that you say?  It's the fun of the anticipation of seeing it cook to perfection and having no down time for it to be prepped and brought out to you as the moment it's done cooking that meat is soft and sizzling and ready to eat!  Nom!

Don't expect enormous portions as the meat they give you are pretty high quality and cut pretty thick.  About ten cuts per meat.

They also had some Korean sides and features, such as bibimbap and kimchi (which was kinda mild for kimchi).

I would not, however, recommend the kitchen food.  My chicken curry dish was very much ""pour add water, and cook"" and was a big disappointment.  Stick with everything you can cook on the table as they do that well!

It's a mom & pop version of franchise Gyu-kaku. It's a mix between Japanese and Korean barbeque. We got a combo and a pork katsu with curry and it was extremely filling. Oh and we got a 4 Sapporos on draft. After taxes and tip, it came out to $30 per person. 

The quality of the meat was not the finest but it was good and reasonable for the price. The downside of the combo is that it does not come with any side dishes and those items need to be ordered separately (it's very un-Korean, most Korean restaurants give sides for free). The pork katsu was standard and it was just good as well. The best part of our meal was the 27.7 degree Sapporos. Super chilled with a film of ice on the top. It was so refreshing in the hot summer Las Vegas night.

I definitely recommend this place if you want a low-key Japanese/Korean food. The items will not disappoint and will fill you up. The minus 0.5 stars is for the side dishes that need to be purchased.",ZlgmfdzsNpa8zD6NmSrcVA,2,1,3,zWLPSWz9Zc3Ba57QE_Ip0g
2206238,2010-08-18,0,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"This review pertains to the lunch menu only.

The Skinny: a watery katsu-don and katsu curry makes a lunch a no-go (2.5) service: friendly, efficient (3), value: the cost of a katsu-don combination and katsu curry was around $16 not including tax and tip.

Let me start off by saying that this place really is a Yakiniku place so that's why I must clarify that I didn't try any of their Yakiniku offerings - just their lunch specials.

My hubby and I tried their katsu-don combination (which comes with soup, salad, and pickles; $7.50) and their katsu curry (which comes with soup; $8) 

I really enjoyed their miso soup and salad. The salad dressing had some lovely overtones of yuzu with wonderful fresh ingredients. The miso soup was flavourful, well seasoned, and had a good amount of soft tofu.

Unfortunately the entrees did not receive the same sort of loving. My katsu-don suffered from poor textures (ie, lack of crispiness of the katsu when combined with the egg) . Albeit the quality of the pork chop was very good, it was hard to overlook the pool of au jus that the rice was swimming in. Honestly, I would not order this again.

The katsu curry plate suffered from the watery consistency of the curry. The flavours of the curry decidedly one note, overpoweringly edged towards too much ginger. The tonkatsu was good but not the best we've ever had.

Overall, I would likely not return for lunch however I would consider returning for the yakiniku that they are known for.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,2,ihld1nNBx81YjvQ-Mt6AhA

Starters:  miso soup, house salad, California roll, assorted kimchi, seaweed salad, edamame

Meats:  kalbi, rib eye, beef tongue, harami and chicken (shrimp and sausage too)

Additional items: gyoza, chicken katsu and karaage

2260671,2011-02-02,0,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"The meat here is of a nice quality but the portions are a bit smaller than at your average korean barbeque.

The bibimbap was a big enough portion to fill out where the meats left off, but we still got an additional order of the rib eye; 5 slices for  $12. 

Tasty meats but with our ""meal for two"", bibimbap and beers we paid $107 plus tip. A similar meal with left overs was closer to $60 at DJK, so this is a less budget friendly late night grilling option.

Starving, my husband and I decided to try the 29ºF beer place downstairs.  No idea what they serve but whatever.  Soooo hungry.  

We noticed the signs all over the door saying something to the effect of, ""We are open, the door is just really heavy.""  My husband seemed to open the door with ease.  Although the place looked crowded, we got seated right away.

We immediately ordered two 29ºF Sapporos.  They turned out to be beer slushies.  I don't really enjoy beer slushies but my husband does, so it was all good.  Then I noticed a grill in the middle - Japanese BBQ.  Nice!  Did I mention we were just going into this place blind?

There's a big digital sign that shows the current beer temperature. My husband amused himself and tried to amuse me by giving me a play-by-play of the changing beer temperature.  ""Now it's 27.9º!  Now it's 27.8º!""

I focused on figuring out the name of the place from the menu so I could check in on Yelp. I discovered many other Yelpers had reviewed this place and gave it decent reviews.  Comforting.  

We went for option B of the Japanese BBQ, which includes a variety of meats and sauces, 8 pieces of sushi, miso soup, rice, and various sides.  When it came out, we realized it had both Japanese and Korean components.  For example, it comes with kimchi.  The BBQ is gas but they threw some charcoal in it, which I believe is traditional for Japanese BBQ.

And when we got our meat it was like moving up from the kids' table!  After living her for six years, I have yet to find a Korean or Japanese BBQ place that will let me cook my own meat.  But here it was all up to us, or to my husband I should say because he's the cook.  All the meats were really good and tasted fresh.  Most of the BBQ options come with beef tongue.  Don't be afraid.  It's really good, especially with the lemon juice and sesame oil.  Personally, I'll eat anything so I don't care.

The grill is curved which made cooking some of the food, especially the round pork sausages, a little interesting.  They kept rolling off!  

After we finished, they immediately brought the check.  I guess they don't serve dessert.  So we headed off to Tea Station for that.  Or tried.  I couldn't open the door to leave.  I pushed my hardest but it just wouldn't budge. My husband had to do.  I guess the door really is heavy!

All in all, I would have preferred baby octopus and honey toast at Ichiza since that it what I was craving, but this was a nice second option and I'm glad we tried it.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,1,4,IsdkVSI6qvuLjMuaztUnUg
2318040,2010-07-15,4,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"This place is open late, and the quality of the a la carte Korean BBQ meats are top tier. The grills in the center of the tables are a charcoal and gas combo. The charcoal makes the grilling a little more challenging than say, the non-stick gas 'domes' at The Honey Pig, but the flavor from good ol' coal is hard to beat.

We've eaten at Yagyu 7 or 8 times this past year and on a few occasions it seems as though our Kalbi order came out to our table as Prime Kalbi at no extra charge - the meat was intensely marbled. Maybe the restaurant ordered too much Prime Kalbi that week? Their regular Kalbi is gristle-free: consistently the leanest Kalbi I've experienced. At Yagyu, one order of Kalbi ($7) is 11-12 boneless pieces. Boneless Kalbi is unusual and I like it. (It is always awkward when we order Kalbi somewhere else and the server puts the Kalbi bones on the grill last, as if gristle, cartilage and marrow are some kind of bonus course. I always feel less 'Asian' when I realize I don't enjoy gnawing on short rib bones. In those situations I usually end up spitting out the undigestible wad of short rib cartilage after I chew on it for a minute. This will never happen at Yagyu.)

At Yagyu we recently discovered the harami (outside skirt) which tastes as good if not better than the Kalbi. 

The Dinner for Two ($26) is HUGE!! It comes with a staggering amount of food, including soup, salad, an assortment of fresh sushi, a generous assortment of katsu dishes, a bunch of banchan sides, several different meats to grill plus vegetables and I think I'm forgetting like 2 or 3 other items that come with it. Usually we don't order the 'Dinner for ___' at Asian restaurants, but this one is not to be overlooked!

I really, really like the Wakame (3.95) seaweed soup. It is served in a big bowl - could almost be a meal in itself.

In addition to food, Yagyu serves 29-degree draft beer. This beer is so cold that a thin sheet of slush floats suspended in the frosty beer glass. 29 degrees would make even a Schlitz (not available) taste great and transformed the Sapporo (available) that I ordered into the coolest Sapporo experience one could have. We have done a lot of winter touring during which we've practiced sticking longneck beers in snowbanks next to hot tubs, creating a 'snow bar' of cold beer. Amazingly, Yagyu's is even colder. Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.

Yagyu is never super busy when we go. Ichiza (upstairs) is always slammed! I hope Yagyu stays open long enough for people to realize what a good value it is - this place should be a lot busier than it is...

Then we got 6 loose menus, all HAND WRITTEN in sharpie with no descriptions. Bad indicator number two. The prices were high so my mother brother and I decided on the Las Vegas combo but before ordering doubled checked that the convo was meant for a family and not individual, the waitress said yes, but when our food arrived it was the size for one in a bento tray.

Drink = love the 28 degrees beer. 
Service = pretty laid back. 2 stars.

(I like Korean BBQ, which is a bit sweeter side) However, I am a huge fan of Japanese style yakiniku (BBQ) because I often visit Japan - that's what my clients overthere always eat, too.

Well, I don't give a shit about the nationality. Who cares. All I care is the TASTE. So, this is what I think about this restaurant.

Kimuchi - very rough, tasteless. Not that spicy, which is ok with me. One of the worst kimuches I've ever eaten.

Bibimbap - flavorless. I have eaten bibimbap both at Japanese and Korean restaurants many times. So far, this is the worst.

Meat - VERY flavorless. Everything is extremely watery and loose. I think they use cheap meat that is frozen and thawed repeatedly. Terrible. You feel like you are eating non-flavor gummy with yakiniku sauce. It doesn't matter if they are thick or thin - just don't taste right!

Rice and miso soup - not to mention.

California roll - it's NOT my choice. I've never seen yakiniku place serving sushi. My buddy ordered it (he's a typical guy who thinks Japan = sushi). I tried it - zero star. 

Desert - nothing special.

You get what you pay for - I believe in this, however, here this doesn't work.. I really wanna support small business, but sorry, this place simply sucks. You should go to all u-can-eat Korean BBQ instead. You get more fore cheaper. I paid over $80 for two of us. Not worth it at all. Even if its 30 bucks, I wouldn't go back - this is nothing like Japanese yakiniku. 

The owner should get better meats and better servers. Better paying more to eat better stuff. 

If you think this place deserves 5 stars,,,, you should get a ticket to NYC or even LA to go eat yakiniku there.... Or even Japan,,,, the heaven of high quality food....

Time to eat.  I loved the meat, its a meat deal!   The sides are nice, but the main attraction is the meat.  Did I say the meat is good!  Try a large platter, you will eat it all.  Its cheap too for that much quality meat.

The softside of this restaurant is that it is filled with locals from China town, you will likely be the only white person there, during the week.   Thats a part I love to, its quaint, quiet and fun!

The pork katsu was really juicy and all the meats were delish.  My recommendation is to cook each meat separately to really enjoy.  Like others here have stated, this is not Korean AYCE.   The concept is similar but this is definitely a different sport.  It's more about the quality and savoring everything.  Of course, more is better.

This is probably the closest you can get to Gyu-Kaku (Honolulu, HI).  If anyone has had the AYCE there, talk about premium qualities and combining the AYCE concept.

Stopped by earlier this night and ordered the 'Las Vegas Lovers' combo $29.95 and a side of salmon $9.95. The meal came with 2 spring rolls, egg drop soup, and edamame.  The spring rolls tasted bland as well as the edamame. The soup was very good. The meats included chicken, steak, and sausage. The quality of the meat was good. My main complaint was the portion size for the meats. The platter was supposed to be enough for 2 people. What arrived on the plate would maybe feed one of us. Everything was tiny. 3 mini sausages, 4 small slices of steak (the slices were half the normal size), and 4 tiny bits of chicken (about the size you would find in a mcnugget).  It would have cost very little for the restaurant to add a good portion of chicken to make this a genuine 2 person meal. After the combo and the side we were still hungry but unwilling to give Yagyu anymore money.

The service was also subpar and a pitcher of beer will set you back 22 bucks. 

Not to come off 100% biased let me mention some things that were positive about the place. The look of the place is adorable. The egg soup was maybe the best I have ever had. The meat came out thawed, unlike most Asian BBQ places. We were provided two sets of tongs, a bonus if you have concerns about cross contamination.

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was how nice the place looked. It's set up so that each table has their own barbecue grill built into the table, and the whole room was actually done up pretty well. 

We had plenty of time to notice our surroundings because there seemed to be only one waitress in the whole place. There were two other tables seated, and though she glanced at us twice while she was serving the other tables, she never even attempted to tell us that it would be a moment or anything. 

After 5 or 10 minutes, she seated us, and we sunk into the comfy booths. We perused the menu, and ultimately decided on the Yagyu Combination A (26.95) and the Yagyu Special (19.95).

It was another wait again, and before long we were brought our food. The Combination A came with Harami, Kalbi, Chicken, and Shrimp. In addition, it also came with four varieties of Sushi rolls (California, Spicy Tuna, Salmon Avacado & Spicy Shrimp), an appetizer plate (Chicken Karage, Ton Katsu, and Pork Gyoza), a salad, a miso soup, a bowl of rice, and four sides (Edamame, Kim Chi, Seasoned Radish, and some random thing I couldn't identify).

The meat was pretty good, but there just wasn't enough of it. They were good cuts, and actually cooked pretty quick. The chicken was definently my favorite, as it had a nice flavor to it.

The sushi was TERRIBLE. It smelled like it was rotten, and tasted similar to dirt. I couldn't even tell if there were actually four different kinds of sushi because they all looked and tasted the same.

The appetizer plate was actually really enjoyable. The chicken Karage was the best part of the meal, and the ton Katsu was actually pretty good as well. The gyoza were over-cooked and entirely too crispy though.

The salad and miso soup were absolutely disgusting, as were the four sides. The edamame were extremely stiff, and I'm admittedly not a huge kim-chi fan.

The Yagyu Special was much better, because it was solely a large helping of Harami, Kalbi, and Rosu meat. None of the meat was seasoned, so it was slightly bland since the only available sauces were Teriyaki, Soy, and Syriacha, but it wasn't too bad.

Overall, this place is ENTIRELY too expensive for just mediocre food. I honestly would have rather gone to a steakhouse and spent $20 on a solid cut of meat rather than an assortment of small shreds. Not to mention that the service is just TERRIBLE. For Korean BBQ, or anything at all really, this is not the place to go.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,1,0,2,BirzN3V3GMxbba1JLe0kMg

Service was very slow, less than cordial, and did not merit a decent tip. 

We actually walked away hungry, and my wife felt bad for suggesting it.

If you want Japanese, go upstairs to Ichiza. If you want to eat a lot, and not break the bank, go upstairs to Korean Garden Barbecue.

If you want an intimate atmosphere, and want to ask a girl to attend your prom; borrow Dad's credit card, and take her here.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,0,0,1,RaMX6ag3T-lNqEe1yrN3Vw

It left me scratching my head whether I should eat here or not.  I didn't really want to wait for a table upstairs at Ichiza, so hunger took over my conscience and made me sit in Yagyu.

What caught my eye on the menu were the three types of combinations for 2. Prices ranged from $27 to $60. We decided to go with the cheapest combo, since even that seemed more than enough to fill us up. Kimchi came out, along with miso soup, seaweed salad, and edamame. Shortly after, a basic salad came out with a very light and satisfying dressing. Next, came a full plate of some fried items (pork cutlets, chicken pieces, gyoza) and about 8 pieces of sushi. We ordered two sides of Portuguese sausage as well, at $2.50 a pop. It was pretty tasty. Lastly, the meats came out while we were modestly gorging at all the dishes presented to us.  The meat showed some quality, which also proved itself in taste.

Everything came out promptly. Food was pretty good too. Nothing really blew my mind; but then again, there was nothing to complain about. Prices seemed very reasonable too, considering all the food we got. Almost $16 a person for this wide array of food + dessert.

The only complaint I have about this place is that the menu is too large. It was sort of overwhelming looking at it and trying to decide what to get. They should focus on the fact that you have a grill in the middle of your table to cook your food, so stick to that. 

A person at our table got chicken curry and it looked like it was some friend meat with rice and gravy. Very unappetizing. I ordered the bimbibop because I was kind of unsure of what to get and it was tasty enough. Other people ordered the meats to be grilled and it was fun to watch them cook and put their meals together and they seemed to enjoy it. 

The waitresses were very sweet and helpful. It is also hard to find parking in this lot, so many people may want to park in the chinatown lot next door and walk over.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,0,0,4,OQQrZNN_O_uu96lzT092Ig

After eating here a second time, I feel like the place deserved its justice.  I do now have a better understanding of what to order, and how to order it.  

I never understood why the prices were so high, untili the waitress came out and explained it to us.  The reason why it's $8.95 or higher a plate for a couple slices of meat, is because they're giving you high quality meat.  They can't do an all you can eat option, because it would cause them to go broke.  With those pieces of meat I can't complain, they were so tender and amazingly satisfying.  Don't be confused in mixing this with korean bbq, in fact there is nothing korean about it, except for the fact that they give kimchi and pickled cucumbers as sides.  

My friends and I ordered 2 of the family specials at $39.95 a plate.  It came with 3 types of meat (we ordered prime), beef tongue, and chicken.  OMG, the kalbi is sooooo melt in your mouth delicious.  Try not to cook it all the way, and have the meat be a little pink.  Trust me, the juices will intensify your tongue with a booming blast of flavors! We then ordered another round of kalbi and some other type of meat.  I think this has been one of the best quality meats I've had at a Yakiniku restaurant, for a reasonable price.  

The atmosphere of this place is good, the waiters/waitresses weren't rude and they sit you down immediately after walking in.  The food preparation is fast, and they're not bad with splitting the checks.  It was a good encounter in chinatown, where I'm always faced with bad service. All in all, I would return again. Maybe with a group, because all together the bill came out to $120.  But with the groupon, we ended up saving $100.00.  Thank you groupon!",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,11,9,4,bN1AV_Hd58H5mraSAEWNRQ

 I think every meal I saw had Beef Tongue in it. I was more than prepared just to set it aside and not eat it. I'm always pestering  my husband to try something new so he turned the tables on me about trying the tongue.  I had to bite my tongue and literally eat one. He kept cooking it for me and I was getting nauseous. The tongue didn't taste bad it tasted like beef but I couldn't help but picture a big tongue with taste buds. My mom would always take me to the market with her and I would see this huge tongue in the meat case. It would gross me out and scare me! That was why I couldn't fully enjoy this experience. 

Even though I did dwell on eating a beef tongue for the first time there were other items that came with our meal which was delicious! It came with Kalbi (my favorite), Kobe beef, Chicken ( I let my husband eat all of that), Shrimp.

I came as part of the UYE hosted by Jen S. and dined with Steve W., Anthony M., Misti Y., Bobby Y. and my other half Eric R.  We shared two yagyu specials for the table (skirt steak, ribeye, and short rib) plus an order of tongue.  Eric R. also got shrimp and a salmon avocado roll, Steve got kimchi, and we all split a wakame soup from the suggestions of Misti and Bobby.

The soup was pretty amazing, so I would go back for that in a minute!  The broth was flavorful, and it had long strands of egg (my kind of egg drop yo!), wakame and green onions.  They gave us 5 small bowls and we were all able to share it (and one order is only $4.50).  

Surprisingly, the ribeye was least fatty of the meats but my favorite nonetheless.  The only dipping sauce I really liked of the 4 was the sesame oil that was seasoned with some salt.  Eric R. and I also got our own bowls of rice which was a great addition to our meal.  The meats overall tasted great, and I especially liked the marbled tongue.  It was a real treat that I am glad we tried!

Jen S. and I also grilled up the kabocha garnishes from the meat plate and that was actually a really great idea!  I did not get a chance to try the kimchi but Steve and Anthony seemed to like it.  I had one shrimp (hard to mess that up!) and one taste of Eric's sushi - this isn't the place for sushi but it was perfectly fine.

When I return, it is wakame soup, tongue and ribeye for me plus the ice cold beer.

It's what I would call Korean barbecue meets the finer end of Japanese quality meat.  Yakiniku means ""grilling meat"" and it's hard to separate the two from just regular good ole fashion Korean BBQ.

I was pretty excited when I walked in the restaurant - clean lines, large tables with exhaust chimneys for grilling, and a thermometer announcing the beer was 29 degrees.

However, when I saw the menu, I was disappointed.  It was very simple and basic.  I was a bit turned off.  But since we were there already, I just had to try it.  The waitresses also gave us two dipping sauces - a Japanese soy sauce with mirin and another one I can't remember.

* Pork Toro ($6.75) - Twelve pieces of fatty pork sprinkled with salt and pepper.  We threw them on the grill and yes, they were amazingly delicious and fatty.

* Prime Beef Tongue ($9.25) - Seven pieces of fresh beef tongue and went quite nicely with the lemon juice and sesame oil/salt concoction.

* Ribeye ($7.75) - Six or seven pieces of beef, along with three pieces of veggies.  Also, very tasty and fresh.

Initially, the prices don't seem too bad.  But I knew we were hungry and if were going to stick around, the bill would have been costly.  I thought we would be able to enjoy a nice meaty dinner, but seeing the direction of the costs, it looked like it would be a pricey meat dinner.  I don't really like how everything is a la carte - kimchee, garlic, lettuce, rice, etc.  With all the Korean restaurants in town, you get used to getting all that other stuff included.

And like john h.'s friend, our friend thought some of the waitresses were cute, but that's his fever.

Service was good, a bit over efficient this first week of business.  We had at least three different girls ask if we were ready to order, and we were not.  I think they are just trying to be out there, but it can get suffocating.

The exhaust doesn't work that great because tears were welling up from all the smoke coming from our grill.

Andy, our resident McFatFat, had a groupon that he kindly offered up to the group for our ""snack"". 

The draw for Andy and Lily is the super cold Sapporos. It gets icicles in your mug so if you're into that, you might want to check it out.

There's combo dinners (meant for two people) and a la carte items but the menu is pretty stripped down to mostly items for the grill, sides and a few out of the kitchen dishes like bibimbap or soup. It seems combos are the way to go since grabbing la carte stacks up fast. 

We just grabbed up Combo A ($26.95) which comes with chicken, shrimp, harami steak, and another kind of steak (4-5 pieces of each) . Sushi rolls (8 pc various kinds), two miso soups, two bowls of rice, one bowl of salad (more than enough to share), fried items: pork katsu, 3pc chicken karage, 3pc fried potstickers, and small banchan: diced radish, cabbage kimchee, seaweed, edamame. For two people this would definitely be a lot of food. More than enough to be stuffed, easy to split with three people to a contented full.

McFatFat wanted to grab their Kobe style beef ($19.95). It's still not bad of a price for great marbled pieces (8 slices) though it was almost as much as a full meal combo. It was very good- tender, flavorful even without any sauce. 

The lady made kinda a face when we said that was all we needed which for reals wasn't necessary to do to someone.

Yagyu is a true JAPANESE style yakiniku restaurant. Umm except that they serve some kimchi.  No lettuce cups though.  Just meat and simple dipping sauces.

The quality of the beef (especially the boneless short rib - kalbi) is excellent.  Definitely prime.  Upgrading to any kobe style cut is worth the added expense.  Incredible fat content that makes the thinly sliced beef cook in literally seconds for melt in the mouth tenderness.  Because of the fat what looks like a little food can quickly fill you up.  Don't over order and have the staff quietly snicker at you.

The beer really is super cold and makes for refreshing, palate cleansing goodness.

Yakiniku is supposed to be engaging and fun but if cooking your own food and getting saturated with a heady, smoky, beefy aroma is not your thing (I wonder if the ladies like this scent on a guy?) I would recommend you try another of Vegas' great dining adventures.

Be sure to check their face book page for groupon offers.  The food can get justifiably pricey so savings help.

As I think back to that moment in time, I remember thinking it was expensive and that I would rather go to a real, deal Korean BBQ place so that I could stuff my face with yummy banchan instead of having to pay for kimchi a la carte. Booooo! Give me bottomless, free banchan you broom-riders!

I have always resisted my hubbie's pulls to take me back there, but last night I ran out of excuses. After being disappointed by the restricted pool access at XS, we were hungry. We went to Red 8 and waited 10-minutes for someone to say ""Ni hao,"" before we said ""Zài Jiàn!"" We were with Mamie P and her old man, who likes beer, so the selling point was 27.7-degree beer at Yagyu! 

This is a brilliant, beautiful thing they have there: beer so cold that little beersicles form on the top of your glass. They have a couple of Japanese brews and Sin City Light. We tried out the Sin City Light, and it wasn't bad. Then again, mud beer served that cold would probably taste just fine too.

As a crew, we ordered 3 rounds of kalbi, 1 beef tongue, a cucumber kimchi, a seaweed soup and a yukke jan soup. To me, the standouts are the soups. Even when I thought I didn't like the place, I thought the soups were delicious with a real comfort food feeling, and they are reasonably priced. The seaweed soup is like four bucks, and it is not a teeny bowl. It has a really great sesame flavor. 

I only ate two little slices of kalbi, but they were tender and flavorful. The delivery is much neater than Korean BBQ, and the serving sizes are smaller but cheaper. You receive about 10 slices on a small white platter for around eight bucks. 

The kimchi was a bit disappointing. The flavor was okay, sadly more sweet than spicy, but they bring it out sliced like big half pickles. You have to figure out how to navigate a gigantic pickle with chopsticks! I did not enjoy this.

Even so, I think I have come around on Yagyu. It is a cute spot. The servers are friendly, and being open until 2am it serves a wonderful post game purpose: to slam down one or three last cold ones and get your late night protein snack on. Or, you can always go there for some soup.

We started out by ordering two Sapporo's. The beer was on point and as advertised ""freezing""...it was wonderfully slushy! One of the high points of dinner. 

We then ordered our main course, and decided on the family set which came with cuts of chicken, ribeye, outside flank, beef tongue, and assorted kimchi. We also added two bowls of miso soup and all you can eat rice. Everything came in a timely manner and we cooked our meats at the table yakiniku style. I believe there is nothing tastier then grilling fresh meat, and this was no exception. Everything was tasty! At first we didn't think the amount of meat that was given would be enough for the both of us...but we were both satisfied after the meal without feeling overly full. We ended the meal with a frozen pineapple sorbet and a melon float respectively. Overall,the meal was tasty and enjoyable if not a bit overpriced for what we got totaling out and just over $110.00.

5361322,2011-10-25,0,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"**Summary**
       - Japanese BBQ - They bring you bite-sized raw meats and you cook them at your table.
       - Quality - The quality of the meats is amazing. When they bring you the meats you can see how marbled and fresh they are.
       - Korean BBQ - Here is the main difference between Korean and Japanese BBQ: Japanese BBQ is primarily unmarinated meats (can be salt/peppered however) that you dip into various sauces. Korean BBQ mostly has marinated meats.
**Ordered**
       - $19.95 Yagyu Special - Came with the following:
              - Harami (Premium Outside Skirt) - My favorite meat. It was the most flavorful and softest of all the meats.
              - Rosu (Marbled Rib-eye) - Nicely marbled, but it just lacked flavor.
              - Kalbi (Short Ribs) - Tasty like all kalbi. Very delicious. No bones though. Just thick pieces of marinated goodness.
       - $9.25 Prime Beef Tongue - Wasn't seasoned as much as we liked when it came. But after we added a bit of salt/pepper, it was just right. It's very tender.
       - $6.75 Pork Toro - Like Pork Belly but more meat and less fat. It was a tad chewy after we cooked it, but it was tasty.
       - $7.25 Beef Bowl - It came with a salad and miso soup. A pretty good beef bowl and a mighty fine deal.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for Japanese BBQ. The meats are of the utmost quality and the prices aren't too bad.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,2,5,eUJd8tKZ9XuxbHoENp_46w
5373731,2011-06-11,0,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"Come in for the ice cold beer! Everyone makes note of the beer that comes out with a nice slush on top and rightfully so. It is the whole draw of this place. 

This was one of the first places that Katrina M. took me to when I first came back from living abroad. The nice thing is that their serving size is not dictated by the AYCE and over indulgent trend of Vegas. I am a fan of getting my moneys worth and I would say that you do get that at Yagyu. The serving size meant for two is the perfect if not a little big. You would not think so because the meat is not stacked high, but with all the sides you will fill up quickly. 

Between the two of us we split the Combination A. The marbling in the meat made it very tender without being too fatty. The fried items were the last things to be touched. There was nothing too special about their tonkatsu, chicken karage, or gyoza. The side dishes were not bad, I tend to devour kimchi like no other. Give me a bowl of rice and kimchi and I can call it a meal. I was coming off the nothing beats the stuff I got in Korea feeling which is why we didn't ask for refills. We paid forty for the combo meal, two beers, with tip. It is not bad for a quality meal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,4,iW2b4pc-RlDoWQlcBsr6jg

The main thing was the cold beer, it was suppose to be the coldest in Las Vegas, and that's the only way to enjoy beer is really really cold, so we stopped in.  For this time of night, it was busy, a few big tables, still around, but we were shown a table and served menus quickly. 

I let my husband choose the combo for two and the food was brought out quickly, we got for $26.95, chicken, shrimp, harami steak, and another kind of steak (4-5 pieces of each) . Sushi rolls (8 pc various kinds), two miso soups, two bowls of rice, one bowl of salad (more than enough to share), fried items: pork katsu, 3pc chicken karage, 3pc fried potstickers, and small banchan: diced radish, cabbage kimchee, seaweed, edamame. 

The food was fresh and satisfying for me, my husband is a big eater and he was still hungry at the end of the meal, but with the two cold beers I had with my meal, I was happy.

5471041,2013-03-19,2,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"We came here before seeing Muse on ST P's day since we couldn't find the place my boyfriend wanted. I'd been to a BBQ fire pit restaurant in Japan and had been wanting to try one here ever since. They don't have open flames, but a grill you place your food on, and huge seating areas.
Everything in is Japanese and English, and most things are pictured for those who aren't sure what is what. Since we were in a hurry I ordered only one plate of squid, and he got a beef bowl with Miso soup.
For about seven bucks the squid size was pretty good, and they give you yummy sauces to dip them in. The grill gets pretty hot so the food cooks fast and thorough.
My boyfriend seemed to like his beef bowl, which had chunks of seasoned beef on top of veggies and rice. He lamented that they did not have tempura bananas, like pretty much all sushi places have- but this is  authentic Japanese cuisine, so they won't have that stuff. 
They do, however, have real Black Sesame Mochi ice cream (it does not say on the menu, but they do have it) for 3$ for 2 pieces. Way better than sushi house prices, plus it is SO good! I've been waiting to find Black Sesame ice cream since being in Japan, and finally found it here, whoot!
The bill came out to 22$ before tips, which is a very good price for two people and great food. They serve everything super fast, which is a plus.
I'd love to come back and try a whole dinner special with veggies and what not.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,4,3,4,RuReg44OvFvYQj-ak6wFwQ

Mediocre food at it's best.... we spent 8 years living in Japan, while the servers and chef definitely appear to be Japanese we felt the food was lacking.   We asked how the curry plate compared to coco ichibanya and she told us it was much better at Yagyu, after the Mr ordered it and pretty well knows it's strait up S&B outta the box he was content with the meal but knows it could have been better.  I had the tonkatsu plate and the sauce was the same that you can buy at any Asian market, the cutlets from both of our meals was way thicker than we are accustomed to but were good.  The 'dressing' on the cabbage salad was SPOT on and really made me smile.  We will be back to try the yakiniku here as the reviews on it are good.
We fully realize our expectations are higher than they should be maybe, we just miss the original taste you can't find from one restaurant to the other in Japan.",H5Asta4LpiKmRhSjWaogIg,0,0,3,WzPFJQab9WqiH3NjIvFliQ
5627099,2014-10-03,0,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"This place never let me down.  The meat is so good that you don't want to swallow it.  The beer is so cold that you wish you can never get drunk.   

     A perfect balance of rice, meat, kimchi and beer.  The marinade does not over power the chicken and beef tongue.  They use the red meat of the chicken, although it may take a little longer to cook, but when its ready, its so tender on the inside and the little bit burnt on the out side is where the flavor is.  The tongue is crunchy if you cook it just right.  The meat is full of beef flavor, the marble on every slice and the fat that was intentionally left on the meat are so appetizing.  I would ask the waitress for the beer right when I am read to sear my first piece of meat.  The beer comes in a frosty mug.  And the beer was advertised at 29 degree.  I was like the guy in the commercial with a ""Ah........!"" as I put down the mug.  

     You can ask the server for a piece of fat as shown on my picture.  I would put the fat in the center of the grill and put 2 slices of meat on each side to catch the melted fat as it flavors the meat.  When the meat is cooked to your liking, there are two sauces available for you to dip.  One is sweet soy, and one is miso flavored.  Both are very light in flavor but they magically enhanced the over all flavor.  When you are ordering this combo, it comes with kimchi or salad.  Please order the kimchi.  Because its freshly homemade and very crunchy, not too spicy, not too sour, a perfect balance between your meat, rice, and beer.  The whole combination is just such a joy!  

     If it's your first time, I would start it out with Family's combo for $50.  The beer is $4.95(worth every penny). The rice is $2.50. The size is perfect for 2 ppl.

The wagyu set was as advertised; quality cuts. 
Still hungry, we ordered another set of regular cuts. Minus the kalbi they were tough and tasteless. 

The prepared food that came with our meat set was rather uninspiring and bland. The California rolls rice was hard and had almost no guts to it. 
The salad was ice cold (almost frozen) and the Goma dressing was watered down to the point of no taste.

5918763,2011-07-13,2,D1BrHyiZON7u_ef-qt4_Uw,"Yakiniku is Japanese for grilled meat, and is very popular in Japan, Taiwan and N.America.  in Taiwan, where I grew up we simply refer to it as Japanese BBQ.  Although food historians debates if Yakiniku has its origin in Korean cuisine and not Japan, but regardless of its origin, it is still a yummy barbecue treat in my culinary notebook.

It is highly recommended if you enjoy grilling your own bite-sized pieces of beef, pork, chicken, seafood and other cuts of meat that are considered more for connoisseurs (e.g., beef tongue ""Tan"").  And if you are into drinking ice cold beer served in frosty mugs, it is a no brainer.

The beef served here are good cuts and sliced thin (~1/4 inch thick), so after a short time on the grill will taste tender and delicious. Aside from the regular beef, the restaurant also have Kobe beef as an upgrade.  Upgrading to Kobe beef, just means you get beef that have more intramuscular marbling, which means even more tender meat from a former pampered cow that drank beer, gets regular massages, and generally lived a very good life.  

Since it is a DIY barbecue at your table, do expect to leave the restaurant with the pleasant barbecue smell after the meal.  I know they have pretty good ventilation system, so it is not too bad.  Just something to remember, especially if you have a business meeting to attend after your meal.

Price-wise, it is definitely more expensive compared to some other Asian barbecue restaurants in town. But enjoying yakiniku is generally a pricier treat for your mouth and tummy, and you do generally have better quality and cuts of meat.  But they do offer various combinations, which can feed 2-3 people of normal appetite, or one Tony T (yeah, that's me!).  Selecting the combo is also a good way to try out all the different cuts of meat, until you know which cuts you prefer and can order it a la carte.

The waitresses here are very friendly and attentive.  I have never had a bad experience dining here, whether in a large party or solo.  The restaurant is usually not super busy when I go, but calling ahead for reservation is still recommended.

If you see Groupon or LivingSocial promotions for Yagyu Yakiniku, do take advantage of it.  Which helps make a meal here more wallet-friendly.  With or without these promotions, a meal at Yagyu Yakiniku is still a fantastic experience.

That boxer's name is Toshiaki Nishioka. He is the long reigning Super Bantamweight Champion of the world. No boxer from America, Latin America, or Europe has ever come close to beating him. Did you know that he frequently eats at YAGYU YAKINKU?

A friend of mine who is Zainachi Korean recently came to town. So where else would I take them? Of course we went straight for YAGYU YAKINKU! 

Modern Yakinku is the cuisine of the Zainachi Koreans. Many extremely nationalistic Japanese people will deny that Yakinku is the Japanese version of Korean BBQ, but a lot of Japanese-Americans(especially the ones from Hawaii) tend to accept the facts and acknowledge Yakinku as cuisine of the Koreans in Japan. I've known some really die hard conservative Japanese nationals who refuse to acknowledge world history, and even scientific facts. Some of these guys are very stubborn and will deny Yakinku's Korean roots till the day they die. Many people in Japan treat Zainachi Koreans like how some White people treat the Black people here in America. They blame them for all the crime(because 18 of the Major Yakuza bosses in Japan are actually Korean), and most the socioeconomic problems. Conservative Japanese people will practically tell you some kind of bizarre story about how Yakinku originated when a meteor carrying an alien named Jenova crash landed on an Island in the pacific, and the ""god chosen"" residents of this Island(Japan), used their Laser Eyes and Rocket Punch attacks to defeat the aliens. At the end, God was so honored that he came down from the floating continent of Arcadia and presented the Japanese with Yakiniku..Yes, apparently that's how it happened. 

Personally, I always liked Yakinku way better than Korean BBQ. They use higher quality cuts of meat, which have that beautiful marbling effect. Yakinku is practically presented as a seasoned steak, while Bulgogi tends to be a thin slice of flimsy beef. 

The kimchi here is actually something called KIM-UCHI. It's a Japanese variation of Kimchi. Kim-uchi was so popular in Japan in the late 1990s that Korean kimchi companies filed a lawsuit against Japanese Kim-uchi companies for stealing their recipes.

The thing I always liked the most about Yagyu is their Miso Ramen. I personally believe that Yagyu has the best Miso Ramen in not just LV, but the whole world! I love Sapporo style Miso Ramen, and Yagyu does it better than anyone. Yagyu's Miso Ramen has a very thick, creamy broth which is swimming with natural oils from boiling the pork bones for over a day. The spices are perfect, not too spicy, and not too mild.  They use an extremely lean and high quality cut of Pork Tenderloin for their charsiu. No other place in LV does that. Even the bamboo shoots are made in-house and are seasoned perfectly. The taste practically explodes in your mouth the moment it touches your tongue. It's the finest bowl of Miso Ramen, period. The only thing that would make it perfect is if they put in at least 1 slice of Naruto. 

In terms of Miso Ramen, Monta cannot compare. Monta is obviously more of a Tokyo style Ramen house even though they claim they are Kyushu(Kurume). Tokyo Ramen houses specifically specialize in Shoyu ramens. They are practically clueless when it comes to perfecting a bowl of Miso Ramen. Miso Ramen was invented in the city of Sapporo, therefore it's an absolute must to order Miso Ramen from a Sapporo style Ramen house.  So next time you go to a Sapporo style Ramen house like Ramen Sora, it would be a travesty to order the Shoyu. YAGYU YAKINKU's taste is very similar to a Sapporo style ramen, but the ingredients are so much higher quality. Remember that YAGYU is a very upscale restaurant that only serves the highest quality cuts of meat. For example, Monta uses a low quality belly portion of pork for charsiu and precooks it days in advance. They keep it refrigerated, and don't even warm it up when they put it in your Ramen. That's why at Monta, the charsiu splits and falls apart so easily.  At YAGYU, the charsiu is a thick lean cut of high quality tenderloin that is seasoned perfectly, then braised. They cut it fresh before they add it to your soup and that's why all the natural juices burst out when you bite in. I am willing to wager that even the pork bones that they use to boil the broth are from a Organic, Vegetable Feed, Anti-Biotic free, Pasture Raised Pig. 

 The service here has never been less than perfect. Remember that it is still a Japanese restaurant, so you won't get bad service like you sometimes get at Chinese, Filipino, or Korean restaurants. The only 2 times I ever got bad service at a Japanese restaurant was that insane old man at Ichiza, and the degenerate 3rd generation Japanese kids at Santouka in SD.
