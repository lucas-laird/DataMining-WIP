My husband and I ordered the boneless wings and I never thought I would say this, but I would rather go to BWW. The boneless wings at Chicken Bonz where too large (more of a strip than wing), the chicken was chewy and the breading/batter didn't stay on the wing.

How can you go wrong with all you can eat chicken wings and frys. They typically keep them coming fast unless its a busy night. They seem to always be understaffed but never lack on the quality of there food and service with a smile. I have had the opportunity to have a different server every time I have gone and each one of them have been helpful, thoughtful, fast, and caring with a smile on there face ready to bring us more and more. 

They have a good variety of wings to choose from. So far I think the best is there Sweet Chilli and oriental, Those are my top 2 and you can never go wrong with the spicy BBQ and yes every time I go there my last basket is the Damn Mistake. No joke that's what the flavor is called and yes every time its a damn mistake that I order them because they can really kick your ..... anyway,

I went for the 10 wing deal, got home ate about

I don't like,  considering the price I paid; this was one of those times.

- wings are jumbo size and not cooked thoroughly

- the sauce taste like shit

Clean inside and looked new despite being around for a few years. Staff was friendly and helpful. I got a the 6 wing combo. They had no issues with getting multiple sauces which is a rarity in this day and age. My wife ordered the 2 wing with salad combo. They have a salad bar which we thought to be an original concept for a joint like this. 

The food is good. I got the Garlic Parmesan wings which is a sort of dry rub. Usually not a huge fan of the dry wings but there were definitely a cut above the rest and I would gladly order again. Ordered Hot wings also which were typical. Wing sizes are large in comparison to a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd say prices are competitive with other wings joints if not better given the size of the bird. Fries are of the shoestring variety and were excellent. Fountain drinks were easily accessible to patrons and the much-coveted Mr. Pibb was available. Punch cards are given which ensures future visits for this duo.

They have a salad bar that it seemed like a lot of the other customers were enjoying.

Upon our orders arrival I was impressed by the overall size of the tenders.  They were  cooked with just the right amount of crunch and the chicken was moist and tasty.

My recommendations are if coming for lunch come early.  My other one is avoid the ranch dressing.  It is was to loose to cling to wings or tenders.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,3,0,4,RxRyohoahin20NipRqqsSQ

I ordered the AYCE, while the wife ordered a combo plate. According to the menu, kids can eat free for each combo plate that is ordered by an adult (BOGO): should've paid more attention to the receipt since we were charged for the kid's meals. 

They have draft beer for $1 plus .08 tax. 

The chicken wings with bones are huge. I can normally polish off an 18 piece wing order from KFC. This ACYE meal gives you 12 wings that are really big and meaty. when you start digging down the basket, the wings to get a bit smaller and some are the size of the KFC ones, but when you can keep ordering them, who cares. I ordered the med. hot sauce for the wings to see how they rate their hotness....it wasn't really that hot, but then again I like hot and spicy food. 

The other rule about the ACYE wings is you are not allowed to share them with your table mates. 

Overall, we enjoyed the wings. They were juicy, and just a bit salty. Not sure if that is because they are brining their wings or its in their batter. 

There's a salad bar with some type of signage that indicated no salad refills: we watched someone refill her serving container 4 times and nothing was said by staff. 

We will come here again, but make sure you bring a good appetite, since I could not eat anymore and the price for a dozen wings is a dollar or two cheaper that the ACYE.",mvCj6kjmLJSsgvqpD36sIQ,0,0,3,9kdzCmZw9bTj1YjRsMUt1Q

First off the wait in the line must have been 20 minutes just to get our order in. I felt worst for others who came in later when the line was even longer and had to wait about 35 minutes before they put in their order and sat down. Secondly, the AC was broken and the room was sweltering like a sauna. Next, there were only two workers in the whole place to serve about 30 customers...one waitress/cashier and one cook. There was confusion and the service was extremely slow.

How the all you can eat works is you order a first batch of 10 wings for ~$13, then after that you can order 5 wings at a time for refills. This would be decent if the wait wasn't so long between each order and receiving them. In terms of the food, the wings are about average. None of the flavors blew me away and each seemed to have some flaw. For example, the lemon pepper was way too salty.

At that time, I had to leave and did not try the wings because I could not stand the rancid aroma of the sewer! 

Today, I gave them a chance and figured that it would be okay since it has been weeks from my last attempt. All you can eat wings is about $13 and they serve you 10 wings first and you can order more at 5 at a time. 

One thing I hate about chicken wings if it's breaded and it sure was. It was greasy and I still ate it. I asked for my next 5 wings to be plain with no breading, had several hairs on the wings and it tasted unlikely. The hot sauce was watery and not like any others.

Pretty legit place for fingers and fries. There used to be a Chicken Bonz over on Sunset in Green Valley, but it has since become Chicken Shack, and Chicken Bonz was reborn right of the 215 on Decatur.

This place serves up reallllllly bomb chicken fingers, with a bunch of sauces that will satisfy even the pickiest of chicken connoisseurs. They also have regular bone in wings, and burgers (I don't know why I guess some people don't want chicken?).

Its a pretty interesting place, there are a couple of arcade machines set-up which definitely earns the place points because it takes a while to get the food sometimes. It seems to be a mom n pop kind of place so they do go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.

The fingers battered kind of like ""raising canes,"" but they offer hot sauces and ranch, and canes does not. I have been here 3 or 4 times, and the service was always great and fast. I would give this place 5 stars, but the ranch dressing is a little on the watery side, but still very good.",LnmfaiV930Rk_ZAQ0CUdJg,0,0,4,MLAZ97ef2dhjVfU5LRAFIg

There was only 1 person taking orders and serving the food to the customers eating there.  Wasn't impressed at all.

Yesterday, a co-worker wanted to try the place, and I had a coupon to use, so I decided to go again, warning my friend that it may take a while to get our grub.

I am glad I went back!  

This time the place was full of customers, everyone was smiling and the vibe felt way better.  The cute little girl taking orders was friendly and helpful with our order, there were two gentlemen helping throughout the main restaurant area that were friendly and talkative and helpful as we waited for our order.

Seems like the fixed the earlier issues and are now on the right pace.  Well Done!!  I now look forward to going back.",VmElOWbxMkw2BIRjIW0omA,1,0,4,-KR0iBWzP7lOKeoLOAbWiQ

Anyway, the place itself was cool. Clean and I really liked the decorations. Lots of cool stuff to look at.  Its also pretty roomy with plenty of places to sit.

We got the chicken wings with bone and chicken fingers combo meals.  The wings were big! I got the garlic parmesan wings (thinking it would be like wing stops).  It was actually just plain wings with parmesan cheese on top of it.  It wasn't anything special I'd say.  My boyfriend got the chicken fingers with bbq sauce.  I think that the fingers are comparable to cane's.  The bbq sauce was kinda weak in my opinion... very watery.  Other than that, the fingers were moist and cooked well.  I really liked the fries that came with the meal - but thats because I really like shoe string fries.

Overall, I think this place is medium - neither great or bad.  I would probably come back if I wanted wings real quick.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,3,1,3,Kerwlbiit1oAz8_Gv7WvHg
5203548,2010-08-09,1,Sfc8Haz2Yri8Mo1L0E0TsA,"I tried 3 different things on the menu to try their range.
First, the chili cheese fries were awesome.  They are the only thing that might redeem this place.
I tried their cheeseburger.  Eh, it's okay.  About as good as you can expect for a place that specializes in chicken.

Last, I tried their boneless chicken.  Chicken fingers that are overcooked, dry, and have thick breading that is tasteless.
I tried 3 sauces: sweet chili, ranch, and bleu cheese.  Seriously, the bleu cheese tastes like mayo (and nothing like bleu cheese), the ranch tastes like cole slaw (and nothing like ranch), and I couldn't stomach the sweet chili after smelling the rancid sauce.

I think I'll go back to get some chili cheese fries on my way to Farmer Bros or KFC.",XWjDmrvVPdnytrQxUh7ibQ,2,0,2,-l8ndca96EjEeMbmfdbKkg

5314434,2012-06-21,1,Sfc8Haz2Yri8Mo1L0E0TsA,"I had the AYCE on a tuesday night with a bud light lime for ~15.

- Service was hardworking. It seemed like they had one cashier that was taking and waiting on orders and one cook. Service was very slow. I would wait 15min just to get in my refill order. At times, orders would get mixed up. Easy solution would be to hire another waiter. 
- Too hot. Not the chicken, it's pretty tolerable. The restaurant has one huge fan. A group of customers had to complain just to have them turn on the AC. 
- Chicken wings were pretty delicious. My favorite is lemon pepper and garlic parmesan. Although, that is always my favorite, regardless where I go. Lemon pepper is a bit too salty. Damn hot is a bit deceiving initially. It takes a few or so chickens to make it a mistake. haha. I didn't try damn mistake. 
- Boneless chicken is dry. Don't waste stomach space for it. Buffalo sauce is a dip. how lame. 
- Sweet tea is too sweet. Sweeter than Mcdonalds. It takes A LOT of ice to make it cold also. 
- I'd come back, but probably to their other location.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,4,1,3,-gtxH_R5v38tYm3siq-CnA
5376253,2011-02-12,0,Sfc8Haz2Yri8Mo1L0E0TsA,"I've had better wings but this place gets some props for the wings being cooked perfectly and not greasy.  I usually just make my own wings at home in the deep fryer but I've been wanting to try Chicken Bonz since they opened here in Vegas ( I am so over Buffalo Wild Wings and have been for a while) (Wing Stop is okay for a quick craving fix).
The service was excellent, helped us through the menu since it was our first time, and made sure we were doing alright while we were there.

We got a large fry which was bigger than the 2 of us needed, loved them, thin and crispy, good taste, not greasy. We got 25 wings to split which they allowed us to get with 4 different sauces (BBW eat your heart out). Parmesan garlic were okay a little dry and not alot of taste, hot was okay with good heat and okay taste, spicy bbq were pretty good, and the sweet chili garlic were both of our favorite...would definitely get those again. Prices are alright, the 1$ Bud draft is a kick ass deal.
We would go back again, especially to try out some more flavors.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,2,1,3,F0Qz1xmY2-5wMfQAq5KKjg
5498969,2012-05-24,1,Sfc8Haz2Yri8Mo1L0E0TsA,"I've been on the fence for a while about this place but m going to give it a mild endorsement.

The ""bonzless"" tenders are cooked to a perfect texture and coated in a crisp batter that stands up equally well on its own and with sauce.

As is my tendency, I go for the spiciest sauce - the Damn Mistake, which packs a real sting to the face. It's not vision quest hallucination sweaty spicy like Thai peppers but this is among the spiciest non-novelty wing sauce I've tasted. As noted elsewhere, the sauce is served in the side.

Their fries are surprisingly good - very thin, crisp shoestrings that retain a nice snap even once they're cool. They're salty and seasoned flavorfully.

$1 gets you your choice of a draft Bud or an orange creamsicle to put out the fire.

They do AYCE wings for $12.95 daiy, AYCE bonzless Tuesdays. I guess AYCE fries are a buck.

The salad bar is pretty sad looking. But let's get real. You're at a wing joint, the only veggies you have any business eating are dunked in blue cheese or ranch.

Much better than Raising Cane's, incidentally, if a little pricier.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,1,4,jt3yd5ujwjTaO7NB5wKsuw
5500560,2012-02-07,1,Sfc8Haz2Yri8Mo1L0E0TsA,"I love some good chicken wings and they have not lost the chicken wing fight in my opinion this review update is definitely more about the Manager or Owner that was at this location the other night. We go to this location quite a bit and always order the all you can eat wings and add a single basket of all your can eat fries for the table and have never had an issue. This time while eating the Mangager/Owner walked by while we were eating and just stared at our table like we ha killed someone or something which I found odd until the awesome waitress came over and said hey sorry guys but he  saw that you all are sharing the basket of fries so he is not going to refill them for you if you want a refill. Here is what struck me wrong. 

1. If you are the owner or manager or just the big cheese on duty at the time... YOU HANDLE IT. don't send the poor waitress to tell YOUR customers that you have some crappy rule that nobody knows about and basically tell them that you are taking the extra money they paid for AYCE fries and keeping it because you want to be a D#$k

2. Post a sign that says you can not share the fries. 
I'm pretty sure we had been told by a different waitress that we could order one basket and share them amongst the table. But maybe that is why she doesn't work there anymore, the fry Nazi must of gotten ahold of her. 

3. Don't stand at the kitchen entrance when we are leaving with that dumb smirk on your face and say, "" Have a great night"" I am not a person that angers easily but I have to say that last shot while we are on the way out is ridiculous. 

This has been our go to chicken wing joint and this whole incident really bothered me. It is not because we wanted more fries it was just the principle of the thing.  He could have walked over and said hey guys I'm sorry but we don't allow sharing of the AYCE fries so if you want to kick in the other $2 I can continue to refill it for you. but that is obviously not how it went down.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,4,0,3,vvIhF6dh714zBTu8n-qyMg

I am on board with everyone else's opinion.  It's a 3 star place!  No more, no less.  $14 or whatever it is for all you can eat wings is reasonable.  $1 drafts are nice as well. 

It's great they don't charge a ridiculous price for celery like Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters who charge somewhere around $3 for ranch and celery.  81 cents here.
