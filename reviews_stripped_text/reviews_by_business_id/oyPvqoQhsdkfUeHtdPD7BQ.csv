When I first entered the cafe, I got warm greeting by the owner of the cafe, and she has the best smile in the world that makes you feel you are home again. The owner of the cage named Jane, we have talked a while, and I learned that the reason why this restaurant called J-work is because all of her family members have J as the leads of the names. The restaurant is not too big, more like cozy. But I think the design of this restaurant is ideal for the small cafe like this. They would notice me stopping eating, then come to me ask if I was doing ok. The food was exact what I ordered from the menu. I do not know if I should mention this, but some of the items are off the menu, so you can only order them when the restaurant is not busy. And that is the reason why I always go there after lunch time. The employees there are super friendly, always smiling at you, and they would always make sure that you are doing fine, if not, they would politely ask if there was anything that is not great or makes the customers unhappy. For the food part, I usually order Egg Foo Yung and Garlic Chicken. The Egg Foo Young is my favorite dish. It is made of egg, flour, vegetables and one choice of meat.  Jason (chef) made it like a cake, top of the Egg Foo Yung is brown, the middle and the bottom of it are golden brown, I think that is the egg wrapped with vegetables and meat. Smell fresh, with the sauce, it tasted sweet then a little bit salty. Semi-soft, like the fried tofu. It is off the menu now, because they only have time to make it when the restaurant is not busy but you always can ask Jason if he is available to make it for you. Overall, the food of the cafe is nice with reasonable price; employees are heart-warming. I would recommend people to go there and try it out!",_ejd-qHu2wCU2WfDy5UHWA,3,4,5,qjc9TkjBY2svvTPJYrt2wQ

I have eat here two times. The first time I ordered wonton soup fried rice and orange chicken. The wontons taste like super market wonton and even worse. I can barely taste the meat in orange chicken, all I can taste is the breaking outside. The fried rice was good nothing to complain.
The second time I ordered garlic chicken. The restaurant become some sort of a fast food place and everything was in a Togo container. The garlic chicken taste REALLY BAD. The chicken meat taste like it was out of date and has a weird smell. The sauce they use just make the whole thing even worse. It's the worst chicken dish I have ever tasted before.

1671954,2015-07-08,3,oyPvqoQhsdkfUeHtdPD7BQ,"This review was for my 1st visit on Thursday, July 2nd

Thanks to other reviews, this place was on my short list to try.  My colleagues and I stopped in for lunch, and the first thing we noticed was the cool ""celebrity-like"" backdrop on the far wall.  Cheesy but fun - a little tongue-in-cheek so to speak.  The 2nd thing to really pay attention to, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the Specials board.  HH prices from 11 - 3 pm.  Yes!

I ordered the Thai-ritto and the deviled eggs, and my colleagues ordered the beef & broccoli, orange chicken, and pot stickers.  We each tried each others dishes and all were excellent with generous portions!

Thai-ritto consists of pad thai with a lime sauce wrapped in a tomato flour tortilla.  So fresh, and served cool.  Perfect on a hot Vegas summer day!  The beef & broccoli was tender and the sauce was well balanced, not too spicy, salty or overbearing.  The orange chicken was well flavored as well, with crunchy pieces of chicken (nothing soggy about this dish) and lots of beautiful colors of various vegetables.  The pot stickers were cooked beautifully with a delicate soy-vinegar sauce that was also well balanced, not too salty or vinegary.

Staff is very friendly, and chef popped out to check on us.  My colleagues received a work-related discount that I did not (not the restaurant's fault), and chef generously offered a dessert on the house.  Wow!  Pretty amazing customer service!  We all shared a slice of the key lime pie, which we initially said we were too full and would just try a bite, but of course we ate it all.

Be patient for your food - it's cooked to order.  This is NOT Panda Express where the food is pre-cooked and sitting in a warming dish.  It is WELL worth the short wait!  Thank you, J-Wok Cafe, for a wonderful lunch!  We'll be back...",KdQq5g7AjZyCrB2gzwHsmQ,4,7,5,kgddlivhCRojLfpmpCg9lg

J-Wok is the only fast food Asian restaurant that's remained consistent in my book. They have amazing happy hour and lunch special deals, but even on regular hours, prices are still so reasonable especially with their serving sizes!!! On top of that, each time I've come in I've received such genuine hospitality. The owners are so kind and really care about their customers' satisfaction and even ask for feedback. I'm surprised not many people know about J-Wok, but I'm sure over time this place will be so poppin!! Also, they are about to launch new green teas.

You can get any number of Thai/Chinese dishes here, and they're fairly solid- the pan fried potstickers (great dipping sauce!) and crab Rangoon (really light on the cream cheese) are made fresh daily, but my usual picks are the egg foo yung or the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. My guy often opts for the orange chicken, chow mein, or the wor won ton soup (giant portion).  If you're feeling more adventurous, they offer some fusion specials. I've enjoyed the Thai-rrito, the Thai deviled eggs, and the Mongolian beef hash and eggs. Snag the garlic cheese fries during HH. 

BEVERAGES: Thai tea, thai coffee, Torani fruit smoothies, blended frappes, milk tea, flavored teas, and great honey boba. Try the Turbo Frappe for an unbeatable caffeine rush.

Family owned and operated with attentive and friendly service. Everything is made to order, so call ahead or using Eat24.  Small stage area in the back for performances and special events.

As soon as I walked in, I felt welcome. It's a tiny place, so don't expect anything spectacular and huge. But I must say, service here would probably be the one thing that would keep me coming back for more.

The lady in the register's name is Julie. She was very nice and super helpful. I came at about 7 pm at night and no one was inside. Their food menu is pretty diverse! They had Thai food, as well as Chinese. They even had lumpia and adobo on their menu! Pretty neat! I'm excited because they're so close to me.

Anyways...let's move on to the food. Honestly, I've had better. BUT, it wasn't not good, it was okay. I ordered the Mongolian beef for my boyfriend and I had the orange chicken. The Mongolian beef tasted a bit different from most Chinese places, but it wasn't bad. The orange chicken was tasty, it just wasn't as crunchy, like how orange chicken usually is. I also didn't know that the order came with rice. So I ordered an extra friend rice dish. I'm glad I did because the fried rice was good!!

At the end of my order, Julie gave me a stamp card (I LOVE STAMP CARDS!!!) for every entree you get, you get stamped, and after a certain amount of stamps..you get a free entree!!!

Kind of iffy about going, but we saw the free Thai Coffee with check-in and thought, well, might as well give it a shot. It's definitely a small ""hole in the wall"" type of place with random decor and a large tv on without sound. You order at the counter and the girl up front was polite. 

They had a larger drink menu than I expected which consisted of a few frappes, smoothies, teas, and coffee. They also had a small list of basic add-ins. I ordered a jasmine milk tea with boba. It was the same size as the coffee I posted and cost $3.59. I have to say it was pretty decent and satisfied my craving. I suppose I was pleasantly surprised since my expectations were low. My husband's coffee was ok as well, they use that Asian coffee that sort of has a toasted rice flavor. It did take them a while to make the drinks. I noticed a lot of going back and forth seeming to look for ingredients? It made me think that they don't really make drinks on a regular basis. 

I also ordered Lumpia (Filipino egg rolls) as sort of an afterthought, the gal had to check if they had some and I was disappointed to spy that they were of the frozen, bagged variety.

PRO: Service 5/5
* Owners are super sweet & helpful
* Menu has a nice variety of original Thai dishes & also a dash of Chinese fusion 
* Prices are fair 
* Portion size is slightly above average on (some) dishes
* Thai ice tea is tasty

CON: Food 2/5
* Pad Thai - Although a great heaping portion, the egg /fettuccine noodles substituted instead of authentic rice noodles, left the dish extremely dense and dry. The noodles sat in our bellies like a rock and was difficult to digest. The blandness of this dish left a lot to be desired. 2/5
* Mongolian beef hash - The overall dish had a prominent sour, possibly lime flavor which caught me off guard and the portion size was questionable. The ""hash"" portion was a tease - the ""1"" hash brown that you can find at Costco'a freezer aisle (I love Costco) but still, it wasn't not large enough to satisfy the amount of beef cubes and the large chunks of bell pepper and onions underneath. After 3 balanced bites with hash, I was left picking at the rest of my saucy beef and veggies wishing there was some sort of carb, or rice to soak up all the moisture to eat it with. 2/5

No alcohol here, but you CAN get a thai iced tea or milk tea for only $1.95 and a variety of entrees for only $4.95 -- the most happy you can get without getting sloshed with libations or taking your clothes off. 

The bf and I stopped in for their lunch special. I got the garlic chicken and he got the teriyaki chicken. Both came with 2 small scoops of rice and a spring roll. Regardless of in-house dining or to-go, they use styrofoam containers. Honestly, my garlic chicken seemed overwhelmingly doused in garlic. But, with the wide variety of menu items they offer, I would not hesitate to give other entrees a chance. Especially at such a cheap price and a very friendly store owner. 

Tip: Check in for a free thai iced coffee! I asked if I could get the thai iced tea instead and he honored my request. I've actually tried both, and the thai iced tea is definitely better!",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,6,6,4,QIuSIu2gfIFr_PLNqJn2ZA

We were thinking of a noodle dish and an item off the fusion menu. As much as we were eyeing the Pad see ew and the Drunken Noodles, the owners strongly recommended the Chow Mein and Mongolian Beef Hash off the fusion side.

Tastewise, the hash was a disappointment using the same type of hash browns found at Mickey D's and the flavors just didn't mesh well together...no....just no...the Chow Mein was good, similar to what you can get at China One, but the excess oil left on the plate was unnecessary.

Overall, a weak A-Ok for me, and another place I probably won't be returning to when you got tastier oodles of noodle options in Chinatown, and be careful... The po-po may get you here for J-Wokking ...;) ALOHA! ! !

Their happy hour early! Like 1-3pm.  So we missed it by 3 hours.  :( Honestly we ordered a lot of food and it still only came out to $41. Good prices on good food. 

Our server was a tall young man with glasses and while you have the option to order at the counter or be served.  We chose served.  I only saw two people working a young woman and him seemed both did the cooking and serving. Very nice polite people. We ordered lumpia, wontons, garlic chicken with friend rice, and drunken noodles.  All very good except I would use the lumpia sauce also with the wontons. The wonton sauce tasted a bit too rich for these simple little things.

4108286,2015-07-18,4,oyPvqoQhsdkfUeHtdPD7BQ,"[10/11/15: Just learned that happy hour is now 3-5pm daily, with entrees for $4.95. The former ""happy hour"" is still 11-3 daily, but it's now the ""lunch special"" menu and has more options.]

Considering that their music playlist consists solely of songs from the King of Pop, J-Wok's name doesn't reference the right genre. But at least their food popped in my mouth.

J-Wok Cafe is a standalone restaurant located near Sam's Club in one of those sprawling Tropicana Avenue plazas. The entrance (and therefore the best parking) is on the side facing Reno (not Tropicana).  The menu is mainly composed of standard entrees, appetizers, and soups associated with Thai and Chinese cuisine. They also have a fusion menu, which I may explore at another time, as well as smoothies, frappes, and milk tea. With boba available for $0.75 extra, I wondered if it could be a decent substitute for dedicated tea shops. However, I decided not to overload on sugar today.

So-called ""happy hour"" specials are available daily from 11 to 3, and I chose the Pad Thai ($6 special) with chicken (tofu also a standard option, and other meats cost extra). It was presented in a plastic to-go bowl container. It was as good as any other standard restaurant Pad Thai: moist noodles, an overall sweetness that you can offset with a small lime wedge, a reasonable amount of chicken (some even with a bit of a char), bean sprouts, and greens. I barely remembered that I ordered it as a ""3"" (out of a spicy scale of 10) because the heat dissipated quickly. Other places are more aggressive with their capsaicin, and my sensitive palate was thankful that they went light instead. Portion-wise, it's average for a lunch special, not small as I'd originally thought.

I also picked up a $2 Thai tea. I think the large size is also the one offered on the happy hour menu, but I know with certainty that it was advertised at that price and size on their blackboard today. It's a fairly generous portion served in a plastic cup that's strongly reminiscent of a whipped cream venti frappuccino, and it's sweet but not cloyingly so. I could see myself ordering it again as a happy hour or blackboard special.

I'm not sure if this issue will persist for the rest of the Vegas summer, but it was noticeably warm when I first stepped in. They have two vertical A/C units that didn't seem to be very powerful, but it did get cooler as the meal proceeded, especially when I moved to a table directly facing one of the fans.

While J-Wok is not a complete replacement for more traditional Thai or Chinese restaurants, it definitely hit the right notes for me. It's a good neighborhood restaurant that I could see myself revisiting, although not for a very quick lunch because they took a little longer than I'd expected to cook the food (which is a good sign otherwise). Check it out if you happen to be in the area.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,4,n7ia1wmKIrRi7brXVvYcuQ

The food is horrible! The steamed rice is...crunchy?? It was as if it's uncooked and we ate it straight from the bag. The fried rice had no flavor other than tasting smoky. Did they just add soy sauce and flavored smoke? 

If you like McDonald's chicken McNuggets with sweet and sour sauce, then you'll love their General's Chicken. That's what it tasted like! Yuck. 

Others in my lunch group of 7 ordered other items, and not one person seemed to be happy with their food.

So I called & the guy who answers was nice I ordered chicken pad NO PEANUTS  and steam veggies and egg rolls. He tells me it's 17 whatever dollars that is not enough there is a $25 minimum. Ok...I explain to him that just yesterday one of his competitors just screwed me because they forgot the sauces & the vegetables were soggy etc. So I was looking for a new place who wants my business. He's says exactly this ""I really don't know what to do there is a $ 25 minimum isn't there something else you want?"" I laughed and went along with it.  (They should of waived a few buck minimum to gain a new customer ) so I ordered ragoons. Which were very tasty. 
I again said NO PEANUTS EXTRA SPICY 10 HOT MUSTARD AND SOY SAUCE etc. Gave the address blah blah blah. .. before I hung up I said for the 3rd time remember the hot mustard. 
Guess what 40 minutes later the driver walks in and I said I sure hope you didn't forget the hot mustard he had a dumbfounded look on his face we opened the bag there's no hot mustard no soy sauce no chopsticks. Yes a fork and things labeled nicely. But REALLY? why in hell is this so difficult? To me it's a no brainer ESPECIALLY 
when I begged and pleaded reminded loudly. 
The driver says oh?.I asked if he is going to bring me some back he said yes I suggested he could just walk across the street to the other restaurant and get the sauces  from them and bring it back to save him a trip, but he said no he would come back.. he never came back.

I started with the garlic fries, the I had to order the broccoli/pork so good. Also took advantage of the happy hour special and got the orange chicken. The wor wonton soup also on the happy hour menu. 

Now for the most hyped item on the signature speciality menu. Thai devil' eggs, I will try to explain this experience the hard boiled eggs is deep fried to give it a unique texture. Then a perfect sauce is added, topped off with some great green garnishes on top.

Last but not least and probably my fav is the Mongolian hash & eggs see my pictures.  It's definitely filling but has an incredible mixture of flavors.  Mongolian beef, eggs and has a dash of a green sauce that almost gives it a gyro flavor!
 
The boba Thai milk tea is definitely worth the wait!  I've never had boba that tastes so fresh but with the added flavor of honey.  The best boba tea I've ever had.",jJDEwznWHQIaT4Z0lIFl5A,9,7,5,C9tKC2RXGjgTNIIUOqUMPQ
