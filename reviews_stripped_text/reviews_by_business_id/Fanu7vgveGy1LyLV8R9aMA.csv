It's made of a whole fish and five kinds of vegetables boiled in spicy sauce, if you like spicy sauce and fish, this is a place to enjoy. They also have non spicy dishes and skewers. I am a spicy food lover so love pretty much everything here. The skewers taste fresh and yummy. AND this is a place that has karaoke rooms, so it's perfect for group hangouts. It was my second time here already, will come back again.",zI7qr0otPGHpGkOESICJXA,0,0,5,g8WdWNBGyQ2qzMUUY1TeYg

Service was okay, and food portions were fair. The food was tasty but not mindblowing. I think this is a place to come to get food to supplement a karaoke outing, but necessarily worth a dedicated trip for their food alone.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,GdJeZEdUwa9YmQDVE4xJrw

Even with beer, it is difficult to digest such heavy dishes.",zDFAqfmwSrj1d0WxEFj3gA,0,0,2,bSBejzLPKxNzzUp0rYXgjQ
4350643,2017-04-24,0,Fanu7vgveGy1LyLV8R9aMA,This place has a great deal for the karaoke rooms! It's free as long as you and your party spend $100! My party of 6 spent 5 hours singing our hearts away! The server was very attentive and appeared in no time at a click of the service button. The food was enjoyable as well! The only downside for English song singers is that they don't have the greatest selection. Like how can they not have Britney Spear's classics?,mpJUXMwtAbAYxbC2zJ2eGQ,0,0,4,wfHepodtPoKbtklzkJmhhQ
