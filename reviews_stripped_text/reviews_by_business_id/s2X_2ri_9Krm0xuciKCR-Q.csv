We expected another outstanding meal but were disappointed this time. The caesar salad had sardines not anchovies, ouch! There were also no croutons; just some crushed bread crumbs. The dressing was not a made fresh. My wife ordered the meatballs apetizer; they were very hard and not apetizing. I had the penne al forno, the baked pasta dish. This dish was dry and the ricotta in this dish was grainy and un-appetizing. I know it is difficult to find an Italian chef in Las Vegas.

We are diamond members of Hilton, so we are use to a certain kind of standard when we travel.  We had visited several other restaurants during our stay in Vegas, but the night before our departure we wanted to stay in the hotel & decided to eat dinner at   Bacio.  Service was slow, our server was distracted with another customer, not sure if they were courting or not.  Ordered Chicken Parmesan, which was grossly overcooked & dry.

Upon arriving, I was a little surprised that the restaurant is located in upstairs hallway of the casino. It's not too noisy, but you can still hear the background noise of the downstairs casino from the patio where we were seated. We were told that it would be a 15 minute wait and waited about 10 minutes for one of the 5 or 6 empty tables located in the hallway that had been empty from the time we arrived. 
I was a little disappointed with the ambiance, because when I think of a nice Italian restaurant in Vegas, I think romantic, darker lighting and a little bit of privacy to your table, but that's just my opinion. 
Our server did a very good job. He was very quick to fill our water glasses and serve the calamari appetizer that we decided on. Calamari came with fried zucchini and fried fish as well which was delicious. I ordered the Gnocchi which was very good and the girlfriend ordered the Rigatoni which had spicy sausage and bell peppers. Very spicy, almost too spicy to really enjoy. We enjoyed our food, but if seated inside the restaurant, its possible that I would've added another star to my review for ambiance.",6kOwG7YZZtGUsI2Dchtixg,0,0,3,vOOO3mEtvUScFhiuP85Irg

874016,2014-03-08,0,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps ""offset"" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.  I know not to expect too much from places that are meant to squeeze tourists, but there are many, many better places to go on the Vegas strip that give you much more value when they charge these high prices.",ql1NteaTlfAJrUh_Eyzazw,1,0,2,I4tX6AvYki5qECrhYRJKJA

SO glad we did, and our experience was well worth the price. The service was fantastic, all parties were very attentive. The bread before hand was good, it came with vinegar and oil for dipping. After much deliberation, as everything looked great, I decided to try the Tagliolini and all I have to say is FANTASTIC! The sauce was stellar, the muscles and calamari were cooked perfectly and the scallops were so tender that I could cut through them like butter with the side of my fork. Perfection. Josh, my fiance, ordered the special, we both forget the name, but it was kind of like a pasta bake. It had spiral noodles, scallops, mozzarella melted over the top with a white cream sauce. It was amazing and the flavors blended together very well. For our drinks, I had the Bellini, which was very nice and summery, the flavor was good. Josh had a Sauvignon Blanc, which he said paired very well with his dinner. After dinner we had the Profiterole, which is pate choux (a puff pastry) filled with vanilla gelato and a warm chocolate sauce drizzled over the top. Josh wasn't overly impressed with the dessert, but I thought it was delicious.

We were admittedly somewhat skeptical, given the location (inside the Tropicana, which appears to be frozen in time somewhere around 1967), but the food, service and value were all top notch.  We had a reservation and were seated within a few minutes of our arrival, and were then greeted by a friendly waiter who was able to assist us with a tasty wine selection (Layer Cake - delicious) and tide us over with warm bread.  We were seated on the ""patio"" (I guess?) area, which is set up to look like a sidewalk bistro.  This made for great people watching over the course of our dinner.  

Two of us had the Orecchiette Pugliese, which was very tasty.  Mine was a little greasy/buttery at the bottom, but it was such a flavorful dish I couldn't stop myself from eating all of it.  With an entree each, and two bottles of wine plus tax and tip, the four of us paid only $50 each for dinner, which we thought was very reasonable for an Italian restaurant in Vegas.  I should also add that our waiter could give classes on exactly the right level of attentiveness.  During the hour and a half or so we spent there, he checked in on us to refill drinks, etc. often enough to keep us happy, but without being obtrusive.  He was friendly without being overly demonstrative.  We also loved the photos on the walls... All Italian photos of people kissing.  Very fun.",52revjTLn0HhwdcdIEOlbw,0,0,5,xg02HYHg0Dc2I2dWVHk2ag

Bacio is an Italian restaurant located in the Tropicana, between the casino and the Club Tower/Convention area.  Its located right on an interior walkway, so you have the option to sit ""outside"" and get some stellar people watching in, or you can sit inside the cozy little restaurant and have a more quiet, intimate meal.  We opted for the latter.  Before you come to Bacio, make sure you sign up for the Trop Rewards card... you get a lower price on everything on the menu (only a dollar, but still), and a free glass of wine with the purchase of an entrée.  I had the house Chardonnay and it was surprisingly good!

Our waitress was a very attentive server but not intrusive.  I wish I could remember her name, she was super nice. The complimentary bread arrived with oil and balsamic vinegar, but I did not partake as my husband deemed it ""average"" and I'm not one to fill up on average bread! We started with the calamari appetizer, which came with marinara and aioli dipping sauces.  The breading was light and bound well to the calamari, but it could have used a little seasoning.  Next came a Caesar salad, which they were kind enough to split into 2 plates for us.

For our entrees, we were both in the mood for seafood.  I ordered the Capesante, pan seared scallops served over risotto with asparagus and crispy prosciutto, and my husband had the Capellini, which was shrimp over angel hair pasta with a garlic butter sauce.  The Capellini was a little bland, could have used a little more garlic or maybe some crushed red pepper, but the shrimp were large and cooked very well.  My risotto was creamy and delicious, the scallops were HUGE and cooked perfectly, and crispy prosciutto is never a bad addition to a dish.  I would have a hard time going back to Bacio and not ordering the Capesante! 

There are so many great places to eat in Las Vegas, but if you are staying at or near the Tropicana and looking for a good Italian meal, I would definitely recommend Bacio.",qk4wCmW33NL7YfiRIaa4WQ,2,0,4,vlk-IV9ciP4cc5BGRf34lw

Their menu has a category called ""Something Different,"" which included a variety of creative-sounding dishes, so I decided to order the smoked salmon profiterole. However, the dish turned out to be far less interesting than the description made it sound--it was a round omelet with smoked salmon, pieces of asparagus, and caramelized onion, all topped with avocado and capers, sandwiched in between two halves of a rather tasteless profiterole. The omelet itself was rather greasy and completely bland in flavor. The roasted fingerling potatoes on the side were tender and nicely seasoned, but for $19, this dish was way below expectations. Hotel breakfasts have a knack for being boring/overpriced, and unfortunately, Bacio is no exception.

the Riesling that the waiter recommended to us was awesome! 

the veal parmigiana was amazing. a giant veal chop on the bone pounded thin, all breaded and fried and then topped with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese, all broiled until the cheese was bubbly and served on a bed of angel hair pasta garnished with micro basil. it was seriously one of the best things I ate on our vegas trip.

We had a reservation and were seated immediately. While we were reviewing the menu, the hostess came up to our table and asked my husband to remove his ballcap. No problem at all - we were in full Aerosmith attire so I'm sure they thought we probably were riff raff. 

I ordered the chicken parmigiana which was really good - the two sides that came with it were inedible. Luckily, it was a good sized portion of chicken parm and it filled me up. I think there was broccoli on my plate but I really couldn't recognize it so I left it. Mr. B had the steak ravioli - he enjoyed every bit of it. The wine list is very limited - only one Pinot Noir to choose from.

As we were leaving, there was another guy with his ballcap on and they didn't make him remove his hat (he had his on backwards - maybe that's more acceptable). Considering there are people on the other side of the railing of this restaurant wearing coverups over their bathing suits and walking to the pool, it seems ridiculous that there's any kind of 'dress code' - and that they enforce it haphazardly.

I was excited to try Bacio mainly because I LOVE watching Top Chef and Carla Pellegrino was/is the chef at Bacio (I was secretly hoping to meet her, but sadly I was too chicken to ask).

I'm always a sucker for Italian and pasta. I've tried multiple menu items but by far my favorites are the Bacio Salad and the apple dessert. The Bacio salad is perfectly refreshing and tasty with many veggies that you don't see on many salads. The dressing is what makes this salad my favorite, the tangy citrus flavor is delicious. I've tried both apple desserts at Bacio and Biscayne (the restaurant across the way), but Bacio's is better. Bacio's apple dessert has a crispy, flakey pastry with caramel ice cream (gelato?). This caramel ice cream is soooo good. It's very different from the usual vanilla ice cream you usually get with apple desserts.

The pasta dishes aren't anything super special, once I got the capellini and the pasta was ""mush-y"" because it was most likely overcooked. I have yet to try their gnocchi which I've wanted to try for like ever, but hopefully I'll be back soon to try it.",CZK0546ReLX0dhA-Aw6cdA,0,0,4,nHQGldfeYSexyi7Um74PIQ

You get the same type of stuff at an Olive Garden and for much much less in my opinion. The menu is basic and has nothing fancy about it. My entrée that I ordered stated it had Prosciutto in it and clearly what I got was Bacon. Yes I am aware they are close in relationship to each other, but I consider myself somewhat of a foodie and know the difference between the two and what I got was definitely Bacon.

As for service it was pretty poor. The staff was friendly, but the service was incredibly slow.  The place is small so it is not that busy and they seem to have an adequate number of people on the wait staff to accommodate everyone. I'd guess each server had roughly a 3 table section which as a former server myself is not hard to manage at all. We had to wait a good 10 minutes just to put a drink order in and then it was another 10 minutes until our bottle of wine was brought to us. The table next to us which was being ran by a different server must have asked for a basket of bread a half a dozen times and at the time we paid our check and left, they still hadn't received it.

All in all I was pretty disappointed. I am a hardcore pasta fan and was looking forward to eating there after we passed by it on our way to our room and all I can say is I was let down.",RjRdMCxoZYM3zlJZWx0HjQ,1,0,2,SfHmTvh3Vv-jRy7d0V0gDA
2668913,2012-01-30,0,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"Took a date here on my mission to try any and all legitimate Italian restaurants in town as new ones pop up. I was slacking on trying Bacio so I finally wanted to check it off my list. Get there for my reservation and Nicole the hostess was friendly and walked us to our 2 top  next to the window over looking the pool. The restaurant looks very Miami with white everywhere. It looks very nice though. 

They bring bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the table in what I would describe as a small gravy float. The taste was very good but then  problem is what with the gravy float type container the olive oil and balsamic was in it is impossible to get the correct oil to vinegar ratio because the balsamic sinks to the bottom and the dish is too deep to get the vinegar without the oil washing most of it away. The quality was great but a shallow saucer with the same mixture would be much better. 

The serve comes to get our appetizer and drink orders. My date orders a glass of wine (very nice wines on the list) and I order an Aperal Spritz. The server comes back after about a minute and says they are out of the Aperal wine, I pointed out it was a liquor not a wine. He comes back shortly with both drinks. The spritz was made perfectly. The waiter was either new to Bacio or just didnt know his menu very well as there are only like 6 cocktails to choose from.

For appetizers She orders the Cesar and I order the Caprese. She enjoyed the ceasar and the caprese was  good as well. Great quality tomatoes and olive oil with Bufalo mozarella. I wish there was larger pieces of basil though and they were micro slices instead. Different but it didn't really take away from the great quality I just would have loved it more if they had larger pieces of basil. 

We order out entrees and she orders the Tagliolini Neri ai Frutti di Mare as she was in the moos for seafood and I order the Salsa Rustica with Spaghetti with Buffalo Mozzarella. We get the dishes after a perfect wait. The portions were fairly generous for the quality of the ingredients. She really liked her Frutti di mare and I was pretty impressed with my pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was nice. The pasta was much better, twice as big and better flavor that that of Scarpetta at the Cosmo for a few dollars less.

Side Note:
While we were eating Carla was dining at a table right behind us with a guy in a suit. She is an attractive women and the pictures are accurate as to how she looks, not some stock photo from 1982 as many chefs and celebrities use. On several times during our meal she was talking and venting about her divorce of Frank Jr. from RAO's. Getting emotional as I can only imagine it had to be. I am always one to mind my own business unless someone makes it my business. I just feel it's inappropriate and unprofessional for a chef and owner to vent anything out where the public can hear or see her getting emotional about issues that the diners should have no business hearing. take it in the kitchen or stay home if you can't keep it together. It's easy to get caught up in emotion but as a professional there is a time and a place and your business isn't it. 

Now on for Dessert. We decide to share the the Tiramisu. I am a Tiramisu connoisseur. It is my favorite dessert of all time. Cannoli as well but Tiramisu is top of the pile. It is a dessert that had pretty specific ingredients yet every restaurant seems to have such drastically different consistency, flavor and presentation. That is also part of the intrigue of the dessert to me.  The portion size is fairly large and very nice presentation. It had 2 small cookies on the plate with the Tiramisu. The favor of the Tiramisu was different. Not in a bad way but not in the way that I prefer either. It was creamy but the coco and espresso favors didn't balance out right with the other flavors. It was not bad, it just wasn't as impressive as the rest of the dinner was.  The 2 cookies the size of a half dollar were the best part of the Tiramisu. So the star was not something you would really find traditionally. 

To me the appetizers and meals were a solid 4 stars. Very good food. The server was decent, even though the server didn't seems to know his menu all that well. I had to ask the server for dessert instead of him suggesting it and trying to up sell. He was a nice and friendly guy, he could just use some more experience at Bacio. I would say he was about 40 so it wasn't for lack of experience in general, just at Bacio. The unprofessional behavior of Carla was a bit of a disappointment even though it didn't take away from the dinner.  For this reason I am giving it an over all of 3 stars because of the small downers even though it is easily a solid 4 star restaurant.maybe just an off night my date and I went. I love the name Bacio for the place too.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,0,0,3,sSDI5B65H6DPmi0EAqEPwg

We had reservations and were seated inside at a small table at the window with wall right behind our chairs, After a minute we realized this was not going to work, as we both felt pinned in. The hostess was very accommodating in letting us move to a table for 4. 

We both ordered a glass of red from the limited wine menu. Bread with oil and balsamic arrived and it was nice, but found the bowls you had to pour from awkward. 

We ordered the heirloom tomatoes salad with buffalo mozzarella and 1 leaf of Basil. It was very tasty however the chef really should do a view of the dishes before leaving the kitchen as one of the salads had the most wilted and brown leaf of basil on the plate and considering you only get 1 leaf it's disappointing.  Basil Is not that expensive, here's an idea......possibly add more to go with the salad, and of course, some quality control would certainly be appreciated. 

Ordered the Veal Marsala with the side of fresh spinach, as most entrees (other than pasta are a la carte). Both were outstanding, and the Chicken Piccata was moist and delicious.  

It is great looking menu and hard to choose what to order, the pasta looked good, so the nightly special of ossa buco sounded wonderful...... the atmosphere is a little ""stuffy"", it looks like a fun place, I want it to be a fun place, but just needs some FUN......a little to quite for my liking.

We had the calamari tempura as an appetizer. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. If you love tempura you make like this. I enjoyed a key lime martini and my boyfriend liked the pomegranate lemonade. for my main course I really liked the seafood mix on the black squid ink pasta linguine and his salmon was good.

The pasta - this is an Italian restaurant - was fantastic.  I had the cappellini with prawns.  The cappellini was perfectly cooked, the prawns too (and they were huge) and the sauce was amazing.  Very delicious.  My buddy really liked his meal as well.

We started with two appetizers: a white bean Escarole soup and a Caesar salad. I cook a lot at home and know what it takes to get food to taste this good. The bean-and-escarole soup had a deep white bean flavor with strong notes from the pancetta and escarole. The Caesar salad was a revelation. Instead of three big whole Romaine lettuce leaves, the lettuce had been finely chopped which made the salad much easier to eat and absorbed the dressing better. One of the surprises was finding this ultra-fresh sardine underneath.

The main courses were a grouper baked over a ragout of kale, eggplant, and lemon. My partner pronounced it ""delicious"". I had a pasta were chicken and artichoke hearts in a cream sauce. It arrived very hot and the flavors didn't coalesce until it had cooled down. The pasta was ultra fresh with a slightly chewy quality that was deeply satisfying to eat.

3617470,2015-07-01,1,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"I went in for some dinner after a grueling day of 116 temperature. I was exhausted and wanted to eat something AMAZING and have a nice glass of wine. I must confess.... Italian is one of my least favorite cuisines because it's never done to my liking.... Ever! No, I've never been to Italy..... But I know what I like... Ya know. Anyway, I remember Michelle from Biscayne, directly across the walk way,  telling me about a ""beef ravioli"" that I just had to try... From there...So I figured.... Well heck! It's on my way to my room, I exhausted .... Let's do it. 

I'll tell you what! The hostess got me a table in a flash! I was sitting alone so she took the second setting away without me even knowing, had bread, EVOO, balsamic and water on the table before I could even blink! My server  Came over to my table within a reasonable time and apologized for having to wait and thanked me for my patience.. So nice of him... Not necessary but super nice anyway. The place was packed!! It was 8:30 at night on a Tuesday. There are not that many seats inside, lol... But boy was it packed!! Ha ha.

This is the kind of place that changes the white table cloth every table turn. I have a thing about tables... So I can't tell you how much I love that!  

The noise level was perfect... You could hear a murmur.... But no conversations specifically. A bit dark, but it was perfect for me because of my exhausting day. Anyway... I decided to order the recommended plate from Michelle, but couldn't find the ""ravioli"" on the menu. So I asked the server what that may be. He said it was the ""Tortellachi di carne"". The description looked amazing - Short Rib Tortellachi, 16 hour braised beef belly, fresh spinach in a veal glaze! RIIIIGHT, who wouldn't get that! It was PERFECT. The huge hand made, hand rolled tortellini type thing was done perfect, not mushy, not al dente... Just perfect! Everything was piping hot.... And I swear they put the fresh spinach and garlic on it was the sever was taking out of the window!! Lol. Seriously... Awesome!!! The layers and layers of flavor you get with this dish ... Unbelievable! 
The hand made, hand rolled pasta, then the beef then the spinach then the garlic!! Then Comes the veal, fresh big slices of parmesan and the finish of the creamy bits and pieces of the belly!! Awesome!!! The only criticism I have for this plate is .... A bit too much salt. BUT!! When you add in the bread and the wine.... It balances everything out alright.  I would get that again and again! 

The server checked on me several times, almost being protective because I was by myself. I thought that was very thoughtful! He was not intrusive or annoying. Never tried to start a long conversation and knew I was wanting to get to my room!! He checked in with me to be sure I didn't want desert or an espresso.... As a courtesy... AWESOME JOB! 

If you valet park,- FREE, you can easily get to this place within 1-2 min walk thru the casino. 

The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because of the salt and the light level. The dish was over salted, but delicious regardless.  If yelp had a 4 and 3/4 star... I would give them that! Honestly.... Everything else was spot on!!  I'll be going back for sure!!

We started off with a flatbread, which wasn't so much a flatbread as it was a thick-crust pizza without sauce. Flavors were good, temperature was not so good. It was meatball-tastic. I dipped it in balsamic because I'm cool like that and like to give my mouth the inability to taste things. Vinegar is a girl's best friend, what can I say? 

We both had a pasta with alfredo sauce, thick noodles, proscuitto, chicken, and artichokes--Papardelle. The noodles were definitely the winner here--it was fresh pasta and so tasty delicious, I was sad when it was over. However, the meats in the dish were not my fave. They weren't flavored well and way too overcooked. I picked across them for the artichokes and devoured happily.

For dessert we had profiterole and tiramisu. The tiramisu was a real winner--nothing standout other than the fact that it was delicious. The profiteroles weren't as outstanding, but I really never met a dessert I didn't like so I still ate it.

Definitely request to be inside. We sat on the ""patio"" area with full view of the casino area and the ""I-forgot-my-poncho-and-my-fake-Gucci-sunglasses"" kiosk. The inside was reserved for the executives to hobnob their way through a bottle of wine. CEO, Schm-EO. The kitchen-y old Americana-Italia feel inside was more what we were going for.

The meatball soup was tasty enough, but you could see the oil floating on top. The chopped salad came out brown with way too much balsamic. We split it between 3 of us and left over half.

We decided to support Three Square Food Bank by dining at Bacio during restaurant with the fixed price of $30.  What was great about this set menu was the amount of choices we had.

We both had the calamari appetizer which was surprisingly filling.  The calamari tasted good, the one piece of Tilapia & one large shrimp was overcooked and tough.  The deep fried zucchini shreds were delicious along with the accompanying sauces.

My dining companion ordered the pork chop and she loved it.  There was plenty left over for a doggy bag.

I had the Veal Scallopini Marsala and the veal was undercooked, the sauce was fairly tasteless, the mashed potatoes was more like runny puree with large chunks of crystalized salt on top of the potato which was unpleasant to taste.

The side dish of spinach was overly salty and undercooked for both of us.

The tirimisu was okay but definitely didn't taste like traditional tirimisu and I wouldn't order it again.  My friend enjoyed her cannoli.

Our Waiter, Todd did a poor job taking care of us and served dinner when we hadn't finished our appetizers.  It looked like my meal had been sitting under a warmer because the sauce had 'set'.

Service - also, excellent. Very attentive, friendly, and not overbearing at all. 

Atmosphere - here is where I have issues. Tropicana recently underwent a MASSIVE remodel - soup to nuts. And they really couldn't have picked a more inappropriate area for this restaurant. It's a floor above, and a 150 yard walk from the casino, in an area that feels very much like a mall food court. The space itself is small. Very low ceilings, and feels more like an Italian cafe.

I was surprised by how small the restaurant was inside.  There's more seating in the hallway that leads to the rear tower of the Tropicana Hotel.  I decided to eat inside because there had been a whole lot of people rolling suitcases down that hall and I wanted a little more quiet. The restaurant inside is almost all white.

The bread basket was brought quickly.  A couple of things here.  The bread was very dry, stale even, and the mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is just the wrong shape for this dipping sauce.  There's way too much olive oil and the balsamic just sits at the bottom.  The basket had a piece of lavash, some focaccia, a roll, and a slated bread stick.  The star of that basket was the salted bread stick.

For a main course, I got the linguini with Manilla clams in a white wine sauce.  There were 10 clams arranged around the pasta.  This was excellent.  I wanted to drink the sauce left, but I used some of the bread to soak up the white wine sauce and I finished it that way.  For those who don't like salty foods, I could taste a fair amount of salt in the sauce.  I love salt so this was a good thing.  Others need to be warned about that.

For dessert, I got the tiramisu.  This was a very large piece of tiramisu different from what I've generally had, but it was very tasty.  On top was a lot of cocoa powder which set off the sweetness beneath.

The prix fixe menu gives you coffee or tea and a glass of house wine.  I got iced tea and instead of wine, I had a cup of coffee with dessert.  At most places, that would cause fits and an extra charge.  Here it was just fine!

I was going to give Bacio 3.5 stars, but shortly after I was seated, Chef Pellegrino had a meltdown with one of her staff--enough so that most people in the restaurant looked where she was and watched and listened.  She was giving grief to one of her bus people for wasting bread.  The meltdown ended with her saying, ""That costs money.""  She walked out of the restaurant for a few moments and then came back.  The show was worth an extra 1/2 star.  Brava!  The service by all the staff was superb!

I do have one complaint.  The French term for your kind of menu, Chef Pellegrino, is Prix fixe as you well know.  Please don't be lazy and spell it prefix like many people do who have no clue as to the origin of the term.  I know it sounds like prefix but don't succumb to dumbing down your own menu because people don't know.

Chef Pellegrino is very talented.  She was working in the kitchen all the time I was there.  Obviously she cares.  I am sure I'll make a return visit!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,1,4,1YUNporuv3roarlATYtruw

It was solidly OK. I felt like having some kinda baked cheesy comfort-foody goodness, but shockingly there is nothing like that on the menu. Not even lasagna! So I settled for the shrimp risotto, which was pretty good. We shared fried risotto balls for an appetizer, and they were pretty good too. The bread basket was uninspired -- just regular lightly toasted sourdough slices with oil & vinegar. My friend had the pounded veal cutlets, which he found a tad dry, but they brought him some marinara on the side and then he liked it ok. 

The custom cocktail list is fun, and the drinks are really good. I had the ginger mojito, which was fanTAStic -- served with a sugarcane garnish -- and my friend had some fruity vodka thing. Both our drinks were chock-a-block with fruity minty greeny goodness -- they do not skimp on garnishes here!

For dessert, we shared the profiteroles, which were also good. 

The main problem as far as I can see is the atmosphere. It's BORING. The place is located on a walkway in the back of the casino, very claustrophobic and dim, with not much of a view -- just hotel patrons walking back to their rooms. Although I did see a bride, in full wedding attire, carrying a bag of Hooters-to-Go...so I guess the people-watching is OK.

Bacio does a good job in living up to what is printed in their online menu, something that many Las Vegas restaurants have trouble maintaining. Service was good, although a little slow at times. It was a nice timing of courses and no rush to leave, even after they closed.

4351300,2018-03-30,3,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"Lame. That would be my summary of Bacio. In fairness, I am writing this only about their breakfast service. I have not eaten here for any other meal. 

Located in the arcade of the Tropicana Doubletree shops and restaurants, this is one of the on site breakfast venues for hotel guests. It is the only one that has sit down table service as the other one is the buffet. 

My assessment is really based on the fact that the prices to eat breakfast here are a complete rip off. I'm a Diamond Honors member (Hilton branded loyalty program) and would normally receive some type of breakfast freebie at their Doubletree properties and this one really falls short. First they did not offer this to me at check in. I had to ask and then they told me that what I would receive was $13 per day to apply towards daily food and beverage so I could use it for breakfast. I thought that would be great until coming to Bacio and seeing that every breakfast entree is $16-18. Want a stack of pancakes? $16. Bacon and eggs? $16. Add coffee or juice and pretty much your breakfast tab is 
north of $20 per person. The other breakfast option is the buffet that starts at $22. So my loyalty benefit won't cover my charge anywhere unless I order toast and water. I personally find that completely insulting. I'm their highest level loyal customer (I sleep more than 45 nights per year in their properties) and they can't even buy me breakfast. Give me a break. That really is not consistent with every other Hilton portfolio property so they are doing something wrong here. It makes me rethink my choice for lodging for sure. 

The 2nd star earned is really because the one bright spot here were the staff. We were seated and served promptly and politely and it is not the staff's fault that they work for a place flawed by corporate greed. They did a nice job by me and deserve to be recognized for that. 

I can recommend this place for a nice order of toast and a bottomless glass of water. For an affordable breakfast though I would look elsewhere.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,10,5,2,6lB6mNFzUDPdoAVz5kMDKQ
4382786,2015-06-28,3,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"I recently discovered a hidden gem in The Tropicana with Biscayne. So, when I saw a Groupon for Bacio I thought maybe it would a hidden gem too. Definitely not the case.

I had a reservation and we were promptly seated upon arrival. The bread basket came out and that was unremarkable. Our waiter stopped by and I let him know that we had a Groupon. I think this was the end of his interest in our table. I had the lobster ravioli and my husband had the veal parmesan. Both dishes were okay, but not great. As we were finishing our meal the waiter left our check without asking if we even wanted dessert. 

My main problem with this restaurant was the service. I didn't understand the servers anger over the Groupon. I always order dessert, but after his rudeness I wasn't going to hunt him down to get dessert. He should take a lesson from Ken at Biscayne who was awesome even after finding out we had a Groupon. Ken is the reason that we'll go to Biscayne again and pay full price. We also tipped more than the required amount for Ken's outstanding service.

Lastly, while the food was okay, it wasn't great. I would liken it to a chain Italian restaurant. On the strip you have to be careful when choosing restaurants because some are absolutely worth the cost while others are essentially chain restaurants at strip pricing. Bacio is basically a chain at strip pricing. There are much better Italian places in town like Ferraro's (near Hard Rock) or Nove (Palms). Heck, skip the Italian and go across the hall to Biscayne, ask for Ken.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,0,2,JT47zsoBuBaiHWDgHijLFg

Clark K. had some sort of large-ish dish piled with an assortment of fried seafood, which looked good. The pastas were good but nothing special (I had the penne alla vodka), but definitely no complaints. Wine was average, tirimisu amazing. Pacing of the meal was right on target.

In all, it was a truly lovely, enjoyable experience and a good value. The restaurant is very new, open, white, and crisp.

Got off to a horrible start when I pulled into the Tropicana and tried to valet park my car.  There were 3 cars in front of me and 3 cars in back of me and 1 valet guy running around trying to park all the cars.  Literally stood at the valet for 15 minutes just to give the valet guy my car key.  Even funnier was there were like 5 door men standing around watching all the cars congregate.  So, 1 valet guy but 5 door men..... excellent use of resources Tropicana.  Carla, if you read this, you seriously need to move to a different place.  Tropicana is about 30 years behind the times.  I honestly would not return to this restaurant just based on the terrible valet parking alone.

Once I got to the restaurant we had a quick wait and then were seated.  The decor looks like a homely kitchen kinda thing but the prices were high end restaurant.  Not a good combination.  Got a pretty nice bread plate with some olive oil to start.  For appetizers we got the mussels in white wine broth.  Very well done and my favorite dish here.  The wife got the tagliolini with squid ink, tomato sauce, and various seafood.  Dish was okay but I don't think the squid ink added anything to the dish except for color.  I got the oriechette with mild sausage and brocoli rabe.  The mild sausage was too mild as I thought there was almost no taste to the sausage.  The green sauce and the dish itself was kinda bland.  We also got a side dish of peas and proscuitto.  While the taste was okay, the peas were a dull green color and wrinkled which leads me to believe they were frozen peas and not fresh.  Just more disappointment for me.  Lastly, we had to sit for almost 1 hour before we received our pasta dishes.

As for our meals, we were all very divided. I ordered some sort veal dish, which I really enjoyed BUT I have had better veal on numerous occasions. It was a forgettable albeit filling meal. My father-in-law had veal prepared in a different fashion that was too salty for his taste. My husband had a surf and turf combo on special and it was decidedly the best meal on our table. The other two members of our party had a salad and lobster ravioli, which were ""fine"" and ""good"" but again, they've had better.

4692489,2012-08-31,0,s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,"Day one of my restaurant week experience was by far the best italian dinner I have had in a long time. Carla Pellegrino's cooking is like eating a hot dinner right out of grandmas kitchen in Sicily.
The pre-set menu for restaurant week was 30.12 and the portion sizes were great for a limited menu. 
There was 3 of us 2 adulst and my 4yrold and the staff was attentive and friendly even to my daughter who likes to order for herself.
The restaurant is cozy and romantic..,maybe sits 100 to 150 tops. Part of the restaurant is on a terrace setting into the casino. So if seated out there you do see people walking by and it can be noisy but nothing like eating at the Hard Rock Hotel. The ambiance would be great for special occasions or a romantic date. The wine list was not overwhelming in quantity or price but it was not short in quality either.

We ordered 3 restaurant week dinners so it started with 2 orders of frutti di misto..which was calamari rings and legs, green beans, white fish and 2 jumbo shrimp all fried in the light saltt calamari batter..it was soo filling and delicious
we also had the baked clams..which came with 7 mini clams baked with an italian bread crumb top,.squeeze a little lemon on top and its perfection.

2nd courses we had the linguine al vongole..best i have had..not too buttery or oily..which some cheaper venues make that mistake..clams where fresh and light and even tho this dish is known for its garlic taste it was not overwhelming or stagnant...it was awesome-i have included pictures so check out the portion sizes

we also had the chicken parm which was the biggest chicken breast i have ever seen..it came out on a large plate and that breast took up the whole thing..it was served solo

we also ordered the salmon and spinach dish..salmon was cooked perfect, flaky lightly seasoned and the spinach sauteed to perfection..not overly wilted over salted.

3rd course was dessert we had all three they offered
tiramasu-soft light rummy and yummy
sorbets-perfect for a light dessert or to cleanse the palette or for my lil one
Ricotta cheesecake..fluffy not too sweet but just enough creamy goodness to have you begging for more.

we ate family style so we could enjoy all the tastes..my daughter was brought a notepad and pen when she asked for paper to drawer..the service was impeccable..they cleared plates and cleaned the table like they were ninjas..then all off a sudden food was dropped
Roland was our server,,and although other patrons started to complain about ticket times once the restaurant was busier about 8pm..roland handles everything professional and with ease..even if i had to wait 20-30 minutes for my entrees it is well worth it..this is a little known place..but my new favorite restaurant for a night out..its located in tropicana which after the total remodel is suprisingly very miami chic..it no longer has that old person smoky smell like the casinos downtown do..so i would like to dine her again and again even at regular price..

Las Vegas

Nevada has a lot of places to eat, however if you are tired of the buffets and same old themed fare, try Bacio Pasta & Vino. You will find Old World Italian Cuisine and charm located inside the Tropicana.

At first glance it looks like a casual dining spot. It even has plate, napkin, and silverware settings stenciled on the tables. But, from the moment you step through the door you know you are experiencing a new culinary experience. Mia (the manager) said they like to make their patrons believe the Bacio Pasta & Vino is a casual bistro. They don't want anyone to feel out of place by being underdressed.

In reality this is a 5 star intimate Italian café, and you are immediately being catered to by several of their staff. The Executive Chef, George Bargisen, is charged with making sure every sauce is hand-made each day as well as some of their specialty pastas. You may find it hard to choose from the full service menu. There are choices from pizza and calzones to soups and salads, slow cooked beef Rigatoni or other traditional pastas, and seafood. And, just to set your mind at ease; the cost of a meal for two is exactly the same as you would find at the buffet located on the same floor.
 
No Italian meal would be complete without a little wine to go with it. So, Bacio Pasta & Vino offers more than 30 varieties; many of which can be served by the glass. Soda and tea are also offered if that is more to your liking.
 
The Executive Chef, George Bargisen, has more than 20 years' experience working at resorts. He also holds a Guinness World Record for creating the longest buffet line in March 2006.

The restaurant is located at the second floor bridge that connects the Tropicana towers. The Tropicana is at the south end of the strip (across from the Luxor.) This hotel is one of the few original casinos on the Las Vegas strip and is currently undergoing renovations. One thing that won't be changing though is the Bacio Pasta & Vino.",gp8qJGlsMh9SnQGIe-ZcyA,3,0,5,t1SMIqhTxNCedpC02LWGaw

Howevwe we enjoy fine dinning and an experience in-line with the price point.
 
As for Bacio, here is my story sad but true:

the meatballs were dead on arrival, they were dried out and appeared to have been made a number of days ago! i advised my waiter who was kind enough to buy me a beer in exchange for my dried-out balls, a fair, but  equitable trade, however, i would have preferred a good meatball.
 
my wife ordered a chicken parmigan,   which like the heretofore mentioned meatballs was dry,  with almost zero tomato sauce and appeared as thought it had been cooked days in advance, not an good thing considering this is supposed to be a highfalutin establishment, not!  as a matter of fact it was dryer than the driest turkey reheated from thanksgiving day! as a result of ingesting this meal my wife was sick all evening, and into the early morning, a scenario you should not get for ""waking up or eating in vegas"".
 
its funny but my wife had lunch at buca di beppo earlier in the week and their chicken parmigan was of a higher caliber and made fresh on the spot (for an quarter of the price) and she didn't have to get sick :). maybe bacio charges extra for that privilege. 
 
i ordered their veal chop with hot cherry peppers which was served in a bowl, (strange) with zero sides! the dish which takes twenty minutes to make was fresh and quite good. i guess its best when eating here to make sure to order those menu items which have to be made on the spot.
 
also, i must say the decor and atmosphere here was ....sterile to say the least and to say the most was quite boring. we asked for a quite spot and were place at a small table next to a dozen business men in like tee shirts who were drinking up a storm. as there were no other patrons inside we asked to be moved to the outside eating area. 
 
why is it i ask that vegas restaurants think its exciting  for their guests to watch the hotel patrons go to and fro while they are eating their meal? i was actually afraid that one of the passerby's would take one of my meatballs which in hindsight might have been a good thing.

lastly, is there a Manager in the house! There appeared to be nobody in charge, we couldn't find a manager, not good.

Something strange must have been going on in the kitchen that night, as the manager and the waiters were  all lined up most of the time looking into the kitchen through the pass- through. Was there a hidden kitchen disaster, or was it the dark- haired, very expensively dressed diner in the starched white shirt, whom the waiters appeared very nervous around? Was he an owner?  He received very prompt service! 
The food : salads and bread were quite excellent had the one with dried steak: delicious! this was followed by the squid ink pasta with mixed seafood, and the scallops could have been fresher, they tasted somewhat of ammonia.  The capellini with shrimp lacked any lemon cream sauce, as described on the menu, and the shrimp was overcooked and rather tough. The rigatoni with  tomato sauce was nothing special. The pasta with salmon cream sauce was pronounced delicious by my sister. They ran out of the olive appetizers at 6 pm, which we thought rather strange. After an hour of waiting for our main courses, one of our party had reached the limit of her patience, then demanded to see the manager. Our food came out very shortly after that. No manager was then needed, but none came over to make sure things were OK, either, he was still glued to the kitchen window. . Our waiter was pleasant but I think we only saw him three times in an hour and a half: when ordering, when he told me how much I seemed to enjoy the food ( well, I was hungry and my mother taught me to eat what was in front of me), and when he gave us the bill.  The busboy was very attentive, though, we had much water refilling . We declined dessert, but they never offered us coffee after dinner, which one of our party thought was unusual.  As others have noted, the olive oil and balsamic vinegar was served in a high- walled container that did not lend it self to mixing of the two when bread - dipping. 
We sat next to a wall opening in the restaurant, so I had one type of music from the restaurant  in my right ear, and music from the hallway in my left ear, which was very distracting, until I was able to tune out the hall music.  Very small wine pours, too, although the wine menu was excellent.  
We had a half- price entree deal through half price tickets, I think the Price- fix dinner was a better deal. I don't think I would go back, as there are many other dining options in Vegas.

I don't have to eat around the other menus to figure that Bacio's prix fixed menu is the best value dinner of the whole shabang. Not only are there a myriad of excellent options to customize your three-course meal, the selection of dishes available to you is outstanding. At $30.12, Chef Carla's menu measures about $20 less than the average LVRW dinner. And she offers more than just a salmon and a steak. 

I kicked off my meal with the Fritto Misto di Mare ($14.50). Atop a bed of zucchini, majority of the bowl of deep fried sea life was calamari joined by a couple healthy chunks of tilapia and a single shrimp. Although outnumbered, this prawn was meaty, sweet and easily the stand-out piece in this starter. Between the rémoulade and the tomato sauce, the latter seemed to better compliment the taste and texture of the dish. The balance of flavors was a little off in the rémoulade. Either my palate was falling flat this evening or the herb and caper flavors were overpowered by the mayo-base. This isn't a dish to take your time with; the fried zucchini wilts quickly.

Anyone whose met me knows I'm one of those ""banana-asians."" You know. Yellow on the outside, white on the inside? I may not act F.O.B. but I certainly eat like one. On a rare occasion, I'll crave Italian. And on an even more rare occasion, I'll actually enjoy it. Linguini alle Vongole Veraci ($21.00), or linguini with clams in a white wine sauce, is one of those simple dishes that quite often comes out wrong. There aren't many ingredients, so it's all about finding just the right measurement of each item to really make it sing. The al dente linguini was heavy on the garlic with the olive oil, wine, and brine all in perfect harmony. It all came together with just a touch of cracked pepper and a light sprinkle of parmesan. 

There's a dessert option for every palate. But I couldn't leave The Trop without a bite of Chef Carla's famous Tiramisu ($8.50). At this point, the first two courses had filled most of my stomach so I could really only manage a bite before packing the equally massive dessert course to-go. The creamy, sweet sabayon was the perfect finish to such a rich and excellent meal.

While we were a bit disappointed to learn that neither chef is still on staff, that is the ONLY disappointment we had!  Bacio was just great.

First, the atmosphere:  Bacio is actually rather small, with a minimalist feel, done in all whites and with perfect lighting.  Amidst the garish décor of Vegas, it's an oasis of soothing calm and serenity. There is an ""indoor"" space, for intimate dining, and an ""outside"" space, if you'd like to watch the passing parade of people on the mezzanine.  (We were there for the Sin City Shootout, with 5,000 athletes in the hotel, so who WOULDN'T want to watch the passing parade??!).

Next, the service:  Absolutely spot on.  Everyone was friendly and attentive. Service was perfectly paced.

Finally, the food was excellent!  We absolutely loved the hearty Ditalini Pasta Bean Soup and, in fact, are busy trying to recreate it at home.  The pasta dishes were incredibly tasty too - fresh, light and cooked perfectly a dente.  Presentation was simple and elegant and, it is worth mentioning, the price point was very attractive after having been gouged at several of the better known rooms in Vegas.

The Pappardelle Alfredo, by the way, was a standout.  We totally appreciated chef's easy willingness to modify the dish by omitting the artichoke.  

We left Bacio feeling happy and content, without that stuffed feeling you often get at Italian restaurants.  For elegant Italian fare, we can't think of a better place in Las Vegas.",6fYj6gfRwIjbbgdq1wbxNg,1,0,5,pPAArM_V0X9JVojY7S6uRg

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made ""restaurant week"" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The ""Risotto Capesante"" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The ""White Peach"" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole ""serving food in a timely manner"" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,58,36,1,sw3Y3irUi-KkY9gvNCg7XQ

Anthony was my waiter today and he was very nice. He was very accommodating to my entire dining experience. I even asked him to recommend a few dishes since it was difficult for me to decide. I was disappointed though that they did not have the Scaloppini al Marsala as the shipment of veal did not arrive. I really was fixated for this Scaloppini. I guess better luck next time is the mantra for Vegas, right?

The only real negative thing about the whole entire dining experience was the bread that they gave you. It was rather stale and cold. Even Macaroni Grill gives better bread than this place. 

Other than that, everything else was spot on. I ordered the Insalata di Arugula & Rosso Bruno as the Antipasti. It was pretty good, although the portion was very large for an Antipasti. I still managed to eat the whole thing. Next, I ordered the Linguini alla Vongole Veraci as my Piatto Principale. It was very delicious with the wine sauce. However, as a criticism, some of the clams I received were still populated with sand. I was disappointed in this as I heard a few disturbing crunch noises when I bit down. If I overlook this, the dish was still delicious. It is also complimented with a Contorni. I ordered some spinach as the contorni. The spinach was a little salty so I had to refrain from eating too much of this.

Finally, the dessert I ordered was the gelati. You can order up to three flavors so I chose vanilla, banana, and pistachio. When the dessert came out, I was surprised by the size of the dish. It was very tiny! The ice cream was great but I wish there was more of it.  

Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely love to come back here again. Hopefully this time around, they will have the Scaloppini and perhaps improve their bread.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,1,1,4,FjasFGPbJdXoSIM9ndFx6A

Located on the mezzanine of the recently renovated Tropicana Las Vegas, and overlooking the swimming pool, the restaurant conveys a friendly and open ambiance. Service was very good except for a major server error in bringing me the wrong pasta dish, which I unfortunately did not catch until the bill came. I knew that I did not like the dish, and did not completely finish it, because it tasted fishy. It was supposed to be Penne alla Vodka, tomato based with Italian cooked ham and a touch of cream sauce tossed in penne. I thought initially that it might have been some unusual type of ham with which I was not familiar. But when I received the bill I saw that I was being charged for a different but similar dish that instead featured salmon and penne: Garganelli al Salmone. When I pointed this out to our server, she immediately took that charge off the bill, which I thought was a nice but not required gesture since I had consumed most of the dish. 

First the hits! Complimentary Italian olives and assorted bread products and butter were a nice beginning to our meal. The tiny bread-sticks at the bottom of the basket were addicting. Mozzarella in Carozza--billed as a Deep Fried Mozzarella Sandwich accompanied by a sweet Marinara Sauce--was very, very good. And, Branzino con Vegetali, pan-seared sea bass fillets gently placed over grilled fennel, eggplant, and zucchini, was superb--even more memorable than what I ate at Bartolotta di Mare at Wynn Las Vegas a couple of years ago! I also sampled a large piece of cheesy Pollo alla Parmeggiana, which provided a delicious couple of bites. Those were the hits! 

Misses included Pasta & Fagioli Soup. I liked the broth but not the short noodles or the Borlotti Beans, with which the soup was heavily laden. Salads are high priced even for dinner salad size, at $9.50 and up; and, unfortunately for me, no Caesar Salad is available. Neither is Alfredo Sauce, but my wife was successful in getting a slightly different Cream Base Sauce to substitute for Marinara Sauce on her chicken parm. Gelato was just okay, with the Chocolate Gelato tasting like bitter dark chocolate. The best tasting flavor was Banana Gelato. And, the Torta di Mele, warm Italian Fresh Apple Pie, served with Caramel Gelato, was burnt on the bottom. 

Nothing accompanies entrees--not even a green vegetable or roasted potatoes--which seems inappropriate for main dishes priced from $22 to $44. Worse yet, roasted potatoes are not even available to order ala carte. Carla Pellegrino was visible in the kitchen and occasionally on the restaurant floor, but overall quality control was very uneven on the night I dined at Bacio. If I am in the mood for pan-seared sea bass, I will probably revisit this dining establishment, and just avoid ordering the misses I experienced on my first venture here.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,1,0,3,P7w7xeCPredcB9AUCmTx7w

I was amazed at the newly renovated Tropicana hotel and I'm glad to have tried out one of their new dining options. 

Bacio is all about Italian cuisine and they offer pasta dishes to meat entrees to pizza. The pasta dishes run for roughly $20 and the main dish entrees are slightly more expensive at $25. For those looking for a budget meal, you can opt for the pizza.

We actually had to ask our server to bring bread for the table. As Nicole L. described, the bread comes with a big bowl of tomato margarita sauce for dipping. I liked how the bread was nice and crispy and went well with the dipping sauce.

For my main dish I tried the Veal Marsala that consisted of flour dusted veal scallopini, fresh mushroom marsala sauce, brocollini, and linguini. There were two flat pieces of veal and they were really tender. The veal complemented the sweet marsala sauce and the mushrooms burst with good flavor. I wish there was a little more brocollini and linguini though. Overall, I felt it was a solid dish, but I wish there was slightly more pasta.

I didn't have much expectations going into this restaurant at the Tropicana, but I'm glad I did. The prices were quite decent compared to other venues in Las Vegas. Now I'd be interested in checking out the other dining options here at the Tropicana.",6Ct6xwJt7AJD9amnMkNckA,1,1,3,8CpB5iepNdlR8LiczL0n2g
