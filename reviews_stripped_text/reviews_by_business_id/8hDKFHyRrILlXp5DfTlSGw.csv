642005,2011-02-09,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,This place use to be good.  I had a chicken philly and they used cubed pieces chicken instead of the thinly cut meat that they use to use.  This thing was horrible.  They certainly cant call it a philly anymore.   Yukkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,lPtlHMCmzRlvBnPi7mEszw,1,0,1,dD79ukd6wW8v-kPPzq3Uow
1121229,2013-08-18,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"It's amazing how a tiny place in a mall could have good food. I am hooked on their steak quesadillas. I've always loved quesadillas and this one has the right amount of cheese, veggies and meat. The meat is also flavored well. They put salsa and sour cream on the side. Yes, it's fattening, as well as greasy, but I don't eat there very often because I'm rarely in the area. I haven't tried anything else there but the foods that they cook on the grill look good. I've been coming here for a couple of years and the same cook is there and he knows me by now (though not my name) even though I probably go there a very few times a year. He is very kind and accommodating. He makes you feel very welcome there.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,2,0,5,gwA3vt-CpNMNb1l9bVHxbg
1500392,2011-10-07,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"My four-star review is relative to the other food establishments in the Boulevard Mall. I had never been to this mall before this day. The mall looks a little beat up and I bet it was once one of the better shopping centers in this area. Now it is not too busy, but overall seems nice, clean, well-lit and spacious.

The Steak & Spud offers wraps and gyros, sandwiches, and burgers. Egg cheeseburger. Gyro cheeseburger. Nah.. I went with wrap combo No. 2. The man at the counter was nice. He scooped out some sundried tomatoes and fresh spinach and heated that on his grill, then mixed in some feta and savory dressing. This went into the panini press. 

I got some french fries instead of the potato chips. These were good. Real potatoes. 

My meal cost $7.50.

Hey, seriously. This food tasted fresh, delicious, and healthy. I saw him cook it. He washed his hands. It was a good portion. Totally awesome. 

 Especially compared to Sbarro, Panda, Bourbon Grille, and Hibachi San.",obMgObC0jkcpUhVBk8y2HA,8,2,4,mUE470sBE67jfPlqEeVpoA
1575611,2014-09-04,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"Had the pastrami chili fries,  the fries tasted like they were old and very hard,  not fresh at all, the pastrami and pickles were good but they totally skimp on those ingredients and the price was way too high for what you get 10$ for the fries and the coke, the guy behind the counter was nice,  15 minutes later instant diarrhea.

1586289,2014-07-20,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"I go to the Boulevard Mall just so I could eat at this place. The food is awesome and the service is just as equally great. I don't know why people say yuck because of the sour cream or because of how the food is prepped. Restaurants are all different in how they serve their food. We all have different tastes and I think it's unfair for others to rate this place 1 or 2 stars because they think that sour cream or chicken is disgusting.  If you don't like certain items, you can tell them not to add it. They will cook your food the way you like it. These guys are clean, their food is outstanding, and very very friendly. Their Gyro's and their triple cheeseburger for me is the very best in town. Try it!!!",k1PorCDlRKSTZo0MT2CqbQ,1,1,5,hXF-ho6fTa9v08bPmG2tOw

4065954,2018-03-30,17,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"I've eaten at this spot a few times and have always been satisfied with my food. Located in the Boulevard Mall food court, this eating spot is pretty much the only spot I eat at if I eat in the food court. 

The employees here are really friendly and efficient. They are willing to make your food the way you want it, add or take away something if you don't like it (example, I always ask for no mustard on any of my food), they make conversation with their customers and they get your food out quickly. 

Even though I'd consider this place ""fast food"", the items I've had have been really good. I usually get the Spicy Chicken burger with fries. Even though the chicken isn't spicy to me, it is still pretty tasty. The fries are always cooked well with just the right amount of salt. Another good item on the menu is the Pastrami chili cheese fries. If you like chili cheese fries, then you'll love these. They drench the fries in liquid cheese sauce, chili and Pastrami and top it off with some pickles. Definitely different then I'm used to, but still good. 

Overall a good option if you're at this mall and want something to eat.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,27,32,4,09ap7bMX044VDenh9rP9FA
4145075,2018-01-04,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"This place is one of only two places I will eat at when I'm in the area of boulevard mall getting my tires rotated at sears or just slumming  it ! This place is a hidden gem , the food is hot , prepared to order and quite tasty ! On my last visit I ordered the patty melt , which is about 1/2 pound patty of ground beef , saut√©ed diced onions , Swiss cheese and thousand 1000 island dressing served on your choice of bread ( no rye ) grilled to perfection ! Served with  fresh cut French French fries and a beverage for 11$ , you will leave stuffed ! Other times I have ordered the monte cristo which is pretty darn good as well ,if this place was on the strip they could easily charge about 20$ for the same meal , it is in the food court of a dying mall , but hopefully the improvements at this mall will keep them in business , they also do delivery via grub hub according to their signage so maybe save yourself a trip and do delivery ? Either way enjoy !",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,1,0,4,fDlKEXjBtIgHv1Io50KN2A

They have a mix of bar food items and mexican. I tried the Taco Salad and What a MISTAKE. with La Salsa next door I should have known better.

It was Cheesesteak meat used and the thing was COVERED in sour cream. YUCK!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,2,1,2,_xDrXzhsjBCYBWc4omyerg
4451945,2011-06-19,0,8hDKFHyRrILlXp5DfTlSGw,"I can't believe I am actually reviewing this place, but I was hungry, with my mother, and we were killing time while my glasses were being done at Lenscrafters.

Does anyone remember how Boulevard Mall used to be THE premiere mall in Las Vegas? It's amazing how quickly things get run-down and thrown to the way-side in this town. Also, the food court here used to be decent as well. This particular place has gone through so many names and changes I don't bother keeping up.

Basically this is why I go to this place - they have Philly Cheesesteaks. Unfortunately, they aren't terribly good. But they will do in a pinch when you have absolutely nothing else to eat. 

Don't expect any awesome food from this place. Just take a look around you if you just so happen to be in this particular mall, in this food court. Meh.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,0,2,s1q9NC6lZ6_iXPXqgHZ-fg

Who would of known that this small location inside the almost empty Boulevard Mall has one of thee best burgers in town.  I've had almost the whole menu by now and I love it all.  I do noticed that the name of this location would make u think its a philly steak fries location but nope it's burgers and sandwiches.  
Not only is the food amazing but the cooks and owner are absolutely amazing. They are always nice and are always willing to help. If you ever walk up and don't know what u want someone back there will tell u what to get and trust me you'll love it.
One of the best yet hidden gems in town!!! I love the pineapple bacon burger.",ZRNTQOhe25Fha9Bkgb_hcA,3,3,5,iUkaFVIXnjGygvQWRjQ-AQ

It was sloppy and bland, and the fries were soggy. They looked like they never changed the oil in the fryer.2 of the guys half took my order and left out the drink I ordered and had the nerve to get an attitude! The food looks nothing like what they had in the picture on the menu. I only ate because I was starving. I will never eat here again. The customer service was horrendous.

We decided on the Steak and Spud Factory through a trackable delivery service. We waited, and waited, and waited...and waited...the app kept saying the Steak and Spud Factory was preparing it...

Finally it was on its way...
When it arrived we were so excited. The containers were sweating so bad it leaked All over me. We opened the containers, I got the egg burger and steak fries and he got just a regular cheese burger and fries. The egg burger was extremely thin and flat and looked like it was just slopped together, my fries were soggy and so were my coworkers. 

Probably won't be ordering from these guys again. I did give two stars though, because the canned sodas we ordered were icy cold...that was kind of a giveaway that our food hadn't been sitting it was just poorly cooked and slopped together.",Cob8TALgy-LRBZAoprqaew,0,0,2,-XbbKhSVc-p2FCDW2unHaw
