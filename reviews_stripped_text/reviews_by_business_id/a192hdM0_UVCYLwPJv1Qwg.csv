I tried to get the attention of anyone working there. That took about 5 minutes.
When I asked for dressing the waiter looked and acted confused. The choices were ranch, italian or honey mustard. Hummm what would go well with a hawaiian salad that has pineapple and guacamole..... Really none of the mentioned. I ordered ranch. 
The waiter brought it to the table with a clunk. You would think with such a beautiful salad there would be a specialized dressing say with pineapple?
The ranch did not work. The salsa did not work (no flavor or heat) I am from southern California and have made / eaten lots.
Needless to say I will not be going back.",vFi89PgxaZHH6RVmzq5Ecw,2,0,1,uN64UQG0H2gGD0-L6mDnpw

After a dissatisfied service a few months ago we gave it a break and then tried again today. And again disappointing. Service was definitely lacking. Waiter didn't fully know the lunch specials, before they had a paper that came with the menus showing lunch specials but not any more. Food was satisfactory at best and from what I was told of my group. As for mine, I decided to step away from my regular enchiladas and try the shrimp burrito that was I believe $14. That definitely was nothing special especially in presentation. A burrito on a plain plate, no sour cream, no lettuce.
Roberto's and Fausto's in the area have a shrimp burrito for half the price that kills this.

It can be difficult to find parking during peak lunch times.  My friends love this spot and if you are in the downtown area, I don't think you can go wrong here.

The food here is above average, meaning it's not the best I've had in Las Vegas, but definitely not the worst.  The prices here are on the more expensive side, but it won't completely break the bank.  It can get busy during the lunch hour for all the professionals working downtown. 

The service here is excellent and that's really their strength.  They will make your guacamole to order, the chips and salsa are really good.  The tortillas are made at the restaurant.

The machaca con huevos (eggs) are legit and authentic.  I've had burritos here, enchiladas, chorizo with eggs and they are spot on.  All in all, it's a solid 4 stars.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,2,0,4,_mqqnc0bErgARwi8l4P4gw

We arrived early and walked around waiting for my mom and sister to arrive. As we walked back to the restaurant, my sisters car was being towed away. We tried to talk to the man towing it and my sister went in to the restaurant to explain the situation. When she spoke to the manager, the manager was rude. She rolled her eyes and said that it's not her problem. When my mom and sister came we paid the fine and still tried to come in to eat. When we arrived she was talking about the situation in front of me and my family, unaware that we spoke Spanish. Everyone seemed uncomfortable with us, especially when my sister walked in. My sister with the car that was being towed was hesitant to come in, but decide to try to enjoy lunch there despite the rude manger. We had a couple of drinks and chips with dip, but feeling so uncomfortable, we decided to leave.

228746,2014-08-25,0,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"We originally came in to this restaurant on a groupon.  We enjoyed their margaritas, as well as the queso dip that comes with the chips, something that many other Mexican restaurants don't offer.

Went in there tonight.  Started out with the chips, and right away we were informed that they did not have the queso dip, and it would take too long for us to get some.  Strange that they would be out of queso dip at 530 PM, but OK, they brought us the chips with their (as other reviews have stated) lard-based bean dip and a watery, uninteresting salsa.  My wife asked for a spicier salsa, and they brought out a coffee-cup sized serving of some reddish-orange fluid, which to her had at least a little more taste.

The meal was certainly passable....I enjoyed my carne asada enchiladas, and the carnitas de puerco con guacamole was OK as well.  When the bill came, the total was $63 for three people, including soft drinks and upcharges for guacamole (I get it) and spicy salsa (really!).  I guess if I had read Sella G's unsatisfactory review of this restaurant from August 6, I might have known.....but since I had been here a few times, and usually order queso dip, I had no idea that they were charging for salsa (that you have to ask for after first receiving bland, watery stuff at no additional charge).

You know when something annoys you, but you might not make a big deal about it?  That's kind of how I felt when I went to pay (at Casa Don Juan, the waitstaff does not take your money, but you are expected to go line up at the cash register to pay).  I handed the lady behind the counter a $100 bill and my ticket, which she took.  Then, without looking up, she says 'And how was everything?'

If you  are going to ask that question, then I figure you want to know that I am leaving the restaurant annoyed, so I mention the thing about the salsa.   She says 'hold on, let me get the manager'.  She doesn't see the manager, and says (in a worried tone) 'wait, don't leave'.  Well of course I'm not going to leave....she has my $100 bill in her hand, and I haven't got change....and whether or not they adjust the bill, I will still need change.  

So the manager gets there.  I tell her about the salsa, and told her that I did not know there was a charge'.  Her response was that she saw my wife ask for it, and yes, there is a charge.  She has the power, and she is ""right""....and the restaurant will be charging me for the salsa.

In that moment, I let her know that I would never return, and would be posting my experience on social media.  She didn't even look at me, and told the lady at the cash register to charge me the full bill.  I didn't expect that tonight was my last visit ever to Casa Don Juan, but it seems to have worked out that way.  I guess the by-product of this is that it got me to sign up for Yelp!, which I had never done before, and write my first review.  And while I have introduced this restaurant to others that I know, it will be an interesting exercise for me to see how many people I can convince to avoid this restaurant.

As for paying for the salsa, I only 'sort of' apologize to the wait staff that it was deducted from what I would consider a normal tip, but they participated in this by either inadvertently not telling us there was an upcharge when we asked for spicier salsa or by knowingly not telling us of this upcharge and hoping that we wouldn't notice or care when the bill came.  Either way, I'm not too worked up that they were tipped a little less, and I am comfortable that I didn't end up bearing any of the cost that was intended to accompany the combined lack of communication and snitty attitude.  

Memo to the management  it's worse to ask someone if they're satisfied if you aren't going to care.  Good luck collecting $3 annoyance charges to people who don't know they are incurring them.  You took a little money that would have been given to your wait staff, and you now have not only a former customer, but someone who will actively encourage others to avoid your restaurant.",ApkBmaIuJkVmXmWpcAkQSg,1,0,1,UqTQpPpVDE1-Ov-0fsde2g

Our waiter Jesus was also friendly and checked on us often! He made our food recommendations and we couldn't be happier!

We then proceeded to call this resistant to order food off of the current menu the partnered bar provided us. The lovely hostess Denise answered with an incredibly rude tone. She actually hung up on us a number of times on us stating she had no idea where hops was?? I provided the location I was calling from she continued to play dumb and act like we had no idea where this place was... It was next door... Literally right next door?? After realizing they might have someone new who had to clearly not know what neighboring business partners they had I offered to walk by. As I entered the building and let Denise she was nothing but rude and impolite. Far from anything a paid hostess would be. Hopefully management soon recognizes her poor performance and hires a better face for their business.,k-_aq7I7_L-GNd1irbxLIA,0,0,1,ibjoL_9y5talE8TVAwiznA

347504,2013-07-31,1,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"Went in for lunch today. I had waited a while (years) to try this place because there are a handful of awesome Mexican restaurants in Vegas that I frequent regularly. After a numbers of years of thinking about trying this place, I wish I was still just thinking about it. There are much better Mexican eateries in Vegas!!  

My experience today included a super long wait from the time I was seated until the waiter (really sweaty guy) took my order. We're talking 20 solid minutes before I ordered. One redeeming thing at this point, the chips and salsa - the salsa flavor was good and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.

Ok, food comes. Very greasy beef taco, very, very greasy. That's just gross. Pork tamale - not bad but could have used more meat in the middle. Cheese enchilada was okay. There was something, like a noodle, in my beans. I noticed it about half way through. I don't know about you, but it's hard to keep eating after you find something weird in your food. Rice was just average. Sweaty waiter pretty much ignored me until the very end of my meal. I asked for a refresh on my completely empty water glass - it took a while but another man did eventully bring me a fresh water. Then the bill comes and I'm now in a rush to return to work, so I didn't look at the itemized check. I think I was over charged by at least a buck or two. Being in a rush I just blew it off. First and last time I go here. Period!

Conclusion, go to a better Mex spot! There are excellent places around town. Sadly, this is not one of them.",UXeFjDCuX_ZUvxb3qC-lOw,0,0,2,liBW_SqTdbmZ5NltIsSfLQ

Food was good, but not great. 
Service was pretty bad.

I ordered 2cheese enchiladas with an order of beans and rice. $12.99. I did enjoy everything, the sides of rice and beans were kinda small. 
Zordon got the wet super burrito with green sauce. Rice, beans.  $13.99. The burrito was smaller than most and wasn't very good.
My littles got the flautas combo.  $13.99.. because they didn't have a children's menu.

Service: they all looked sad. Like they didn't want to me there. We had to ask them for water several times. They weren't very attentive. Then they sat a family of about 15 right next to us. Really?? They have enough room to leave some space for us. Anyway. Then as we leave the hostesses weren't any better. 

Decor was actually very cute. A little bit weird though, the obsession with Frida. Still, done well.

All in all if yelp allowed half stars i would rank this 3 1/2, however based on the service I will say 4. However,  decent Mexican food, authentic or gringo, is hard for me to find in Las Vegas. I like that this place gives bean dip with their chips and their entrees (ranging typically from $12-16) are pretty good with decent portion size. They have a touristy decor. Also, they generally offer 3 lunch specials around $9. They draw a big downtown lunch crowd but service is quick at lunch. Parking can be hard, they have a lot out back but it is sometimes full then I am left to find parking down the street and hike in.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,4,-A4aN_8A-OJv1TKyyr4VzA

I live less than 2 miles from this place and the hospitality was less than gracious after paying them.  

I asked either my food be replaced and delivered after having to drive there myself or my money be refunded.  The joke was on me.  The management was the epitome of backing up an employee who got stuff wrong.  Unfortunately, the conversation was left that I was incorrect.  

I typically abuse YELP for recommendations, and, I know it's bad to rely on others.  However; after this experience, I'm all in on reviews.

* Right down the block from the Velveteen Rabbit, one of our favorite little spots for a drink.

Will not be back. Things said during our dinner: Too dry, flavorless, gross, something seems wrong.

To be fair, I've actually *heard* from someone that this place is decent, and they were shocked at my feedback. I hope I'm wrong, but our experience was atrocious.

That is a blinking sign that it is a conveyor belt restaurant.  No accommodation for quality, just slap the pre-cooked ingredients together and get the food out so the customer can scarf it down so we can clear the table and seat it again.  Don't worry about offering a nice atmosphere or enjoyable meal.  We asked the waitress for some salsa or red sauce to put on top of our burritos and she replied by glaring at us and saying what do you want - the salsa or red sauce.  For some reason it took way longer to get the red sauce then the actual entrees but when it did arrive it was accompanied by the bill.  Again, scarf the food, clear the table.

I had to request a refill on my water, sorry for putting her out with that request.  The bill reflected a $4 charge for the red sauce, nice!

They advertise this deal which supposedly comes with 2 Margaritas worth $10 each. Therefore, it seems that you are ahead $21 or saving 46% when you buy this Groupon. But at the end they will charge you for the 2 Margaritas $20 - so that wipes out your savings. If you don't drink then you're S.O.L. Overall, the Groupon should simply just say 2 free Margaritas. Because the rest of the food, you'll be paying FULL PRICE. Don't buy this Groupon - it's a Rip Off and  not worth it!

We've only seen our waiter once when he took our order. The rest of the time, the bus boys in blue shirts will serve you. Once in a while you will see the waiters in black counting their tips by the cashier. Their prices are inflated and the Fajitas are bland and are below standard for the price. They don't include sour cream when they serve the Fajitas and will charge you extra if you ask for it.

An in house lady will ask to take your picture for ""FREE"", but will come back to sell you a bigger version for $15 (similar to what they have at an amusement park) I guess it for ""Memories at Casa Don Juan. Really?

Unfortunately, my family's experience at Casa Don Juan was not the greatest.  While the free chips, salsa and bean dip were great (it's kind hard to screw that up), the food we paid for was not very good.

I ordered an a la carte Al Pastor Taco and the Pork and Red Sauce Tamale.  The taco was, truly, the worst taco I've ever had. EVER.  My mother, who also ordered the same taco, spat it out and pushed the plate away.  The flavor and texture of the meat was all off.  Rubbery would be a good adjective -- Tacos El Gordo, this is not.  

My tamale was dry, dry, dry and the advertised ""red sauce"" was barely noticeable.  There was really no flavor to the pork and, overall, was a really bland dish.  Definitely would not order this again. 

I'm probably going to give the Casa a second chance.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the service was friendly. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,5,3,2,Kw4o2EYquXUeNVB2Ar4aNg

I just did not like the rice and refried beans. They seem generic to me. When I say that, I mean they taste like out of the can and not fresh. I am really harsh on refried beans because they taste the same everywhere. The tamales were ok. 

The problem with Mexican food, in my opinion, is that it's so difficult to determine what is good, bad or mediocre.

This was my first time here and it was a very good experience. The place is nice and comforting, paintings on the wall, colorful flags across the ceiling, and very clean. When we were walking to our table I noticed that they make their own tortillas in front of you, or at least in sight from where we were sitting. 

It was difficult deciding what to order, the food looked and smelt great. So we all order a drink gives and took a little more time to order. I have to point out that their bean dip is delicious! I like to feel out and try different items at a new place I haven't been before, so I went with a combination plate, which included 1 Chili Relleno, 2 Enchiladas, with rice and beans. I also added an El Pastor taco on the side. 

Once the food came out, everything looked very nice. I liked everything I had ordered, but the El Pastor taco was very memorable. The meat was very tender and juicy, fresh toppings, and nice in size.

We all ordered combo plates. BF got 2 enchiladas with green sauce, they brought him red sauce. It was corrected quickly. Mom got the taco place and I had the flautas. Nothing stood out. 
I think the prices are too high for the quality and quantity you are given. 
The one thing that irked me was that they charged me $3 for a little cup of chili sauce, and I mean little. I asked them if they had spicy salsa cuz the stuff they served with the chips had no kick. So the waiter brought me a little cup of chili sauce. This isn't something I would be charged for in Los Angeles so it didn't even cross my mind to ask.

We went with a groupon of course, so we also had two house margaritas. I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good.

Beans were flat and mushy, rice cold and stuck together. I mean, seriously? Complete half-ass food. How do you mess something like this up?

When I moved here from Texas 16 years ago, I wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant. But everything was on the California-Mexican side of things (lots of cilantro, mango, and crap like that). And then I found Casa Don Juan. I'm not saying this place is true Tex-Mex, but it sure is good. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, and that's saying something.

From the homey bean dip they give you with your chips to the homemade tortillas, this place is legit. And they sure love them some Frida Kahlo. (Look around; you'll see what I mean.) But on to the food...

As I said, I've been here a lot and usually get the traditional fare (tacos, burritos, chile rellenos). Tonight the spouse and I decided to try something different: he got the tongue, and I got the chicken mole. I'm not a big fan of organ meat, but I liked the tomatilla sauce on my husband's tongue (THAT sounds wrong!), and the important thing is that he loved it. My mole was delicious; one of the best sauces I've had.

Our waiter was great, and it was nice that we could use a Groupon for most of the meal. Even without a coupon, I would (and will) come back to Casa Don Juan.

The spot I picked did not have any signs, but I didn't think much of it because we were planning on eating there. I was gone for no more than 15 mins waiting for my family to arrive and as I walked back I saw that my car was being towed. I walked up the man with my younger sister. We tried to figure out what was happening, he said to release it, it would cost me over $200. I was really upset but I wanted to go inside the restaurant and talk to somebody to clear things up. I walked up to the hostess and I told her how my car was being towed and she quickly and kindly said she would get a manager right away. The manger who was talking on the phone to who I assume was a customer, hangs up and the hostess tried to tell her the situation in Spanish. The manager just shrugged her shoulder at her. I'm pretty sure they didn't know that I spoke Spanish, I tried to explain the situation and she was just being so rude. I asked to go talk to the man and would not hear me out. I even tried to tell her the spot did not have any signs and how I felt that it was unfair. She started yelling and asked me to leave, which I did. When my other sister and mom arrived, we paid the towing fine and they went inside to eat. I was still very upset about the managers respond, but still came in later. One of my sisters told me how they were talking about me in Spanish and pointing fingers as I was walking in. We ordered drinks from Angelica R., who was really friendly, and an appetizer but felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave. As we walked out I asked for the managers name and she mumbled it and said something under her breath. I asked her if she said something and quickly and rudely responded. She told me in front of my sisters and mother and other customers, ""You come in and only have water. Ok, bye! Bye! Bye!"" It was humiliating, disrespectful and  completely uncalled for.

Came here with a large party and they could only split the bill in thirds, which would have been fine, had they kept it clean. Instead drinks from one table got put on another table's bill and it was a bit of a mess. Fortunately everything worked out easily. With a cranky office crew, that could have been a mess.

The rice and beans were okay and ended up just eating that of my plate.

Saw the groupon so figured at the price it was worth a date night try again. Service was great & Food was the same (see below) But they DID NOT HONOR THE GROUPON- all they did was take the price of the groupon OFF OF THE BILL!!!  (they took what we spent for the groupon & not the meals that it was supposed to cover. No discount given at all! ) We bought what we were supposed to, even double checked with the server...then bait and switch at bill time.  No savings here!

I wouldn't say amazing & I wouldn't say great. More like just good. Just good food. Staff was very friendly though. SAFE flavors for just about everyones taste buds. Tastes like it's all from a can or bag...infact, I found a 4 inch piece of plastic wrap in my cheese enchalada!!!!!

Not the best Mexican food in Vegas, but it's not the worst.  When you go into a Mexican resturant and full and it's all middle aged white people - that should tell you what you need to know;

Theres not much seasonings or variety in flavors, just staple 'expected' dishes that should be on a Mexican Resturants Menu.  Traditional combination plates (taco, burrito, enchalada, etc)  with a lot of cheese, not so much interest and tons of sauce to smother it. 

The ""jumbo"" margarita isn't.  Resturant is nice, clean and well decorated (except our table rocked a good 2 inches) and the staff was all very friendly.  Some confusion with the waiter though, I kept asking for two combination 31's. and he kept wanting to give me one combination 32....LOL.

There's so much better Mexican food in Vegas but I can see how this would be popular with the lunch work crowd. Those wanting the ""Denny's"" of Mexican food will love it. Those wanting something homemade and authentic will be disapointed. Even Robertos is better in flavor.",KE429z8SymByrMVk9_OK0Q,0,0,2,0cKQT-xm3ZVBgeUAYvkMKA

Location - not the best part of town. Parking is the worst especially during busy hours.

Restaurant - came here on a Saturday night and maybe something was wrong with the A/C that night but it was sooo hot! Add to that a crowded room and you've got yourself an oven! 

Service - fast and attentive enough considering how busy they were that night.

Food - we ordered the steak fajitas, wet burrito, and mango margaritas. Chips and salsa and bean dip are served before the main meals. Overall food was good! Definitely what you would expect from a Mexican place - greasy and unhealthy but very satisfying. I could've easily shared my fajitas, but since we had a Groupon, we went ahead and redeemed what it was good for. Margaritas were a bit strong. We didn't finish them.

The parking is also a little tricky.   The restaurant itself doesn't have much customer parking in the back.  The adjacent buildings have more spaces available for patrons.  

We were able to get a booth right away.  Soon after complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip are brought to the table.  The bean dip was very bland as though they opened a can of refried beans without mixing any cheese or spices to make it a 'dip'.  

For my entree I chose the #23 Carne Asada Plate.  This comes with the Meat, Small cheese enchilada and rice & beans.  I wasn't wowed by any means.  It was all just average for me.

The waiter couldn't seem to understand my confusion when he explained that Casa Don Juan charges the full price for non-alcoholic drinks. How 'bout offering up that little nugget of info to a customer upon ordering, huh?!?

My husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat at the bar while we played keno & blackjack, after finishing our meal we continued to gamble. 
In the middle of a hand my machine completely blacked out, the bartender was able to cash out my money & I moved over to sit on my husbands lap and play his machine with him.

We are not only sitting at the bar area but I am wearing sweat pants & an old t-shirt! Simply enjoying my husbands company while spending money I do not need to spend at this establishment, they neither comp drinks nor discount them for gambling.
I am so insulted being chastised as if I am exhibiting obnoxious behavior. Shame on this business. 
I informed the server that was sent over to tell us that I would never return to this establishment ever ever again, 5 minutes later a busser is sent over to inform us that the owner is ""truly"" sorry

About 2 years ago some change happened with the cooks or food they order, I don't know but it clearly was NOT as good as it was befor. Well one day I walk in there with my wife for a quick lunch on a Sunday and ordered a large  Menudo and i orderd enchiladas for my wife. We didn't finish all of the food because it wasn't that good. ( it just tastes like stereotypical fast Mexican food now)  When the waiter came and picked up the plates we did not complain but he asked us whether we liked the food or not because most of it was still on the plate. I told him I didn't like it and I have been eating there for years and to me it just wasn't as good as it used to be. I guess he goes and tells the owner's daughter who was the supervisor for the shift at that moment,  but she comes over tells us she is the owners daughter ..... she is the rudest person I have ever encountered. She told me I was wrong because EVERYBODY else was eating their food and nobody was complaining. I told her I wasn't trying to complain,  the waiter asked me why I didn't finish the food and I was honest I had been going there for four or five years at that point and do not plan on returning. The owners daughter is ghetto and come off as a spoiled brat. I did not need to know your DADDY owns the restaurant. But very well, I will never spend another dollar in that restaurant and will tell everyone I know not to eat the. That girl was so unbelievably rude. When I go and eat out at a restaurant if I don't like something I never complain.

Living in Tucson, AZ for the last 15ish years, I am VERY hard to satisfy when it comes to Mexican food. I love Casa Don Juan. The vibe, food, drinks and staff all make this place worth the trek downtown, for sure. 

As this place can be a bit busy, we usually grab a margarita at the bar while we wait for a table. Their margarita are great. They don't over-do it on the sweet. They are limey, strong and delish. I usually order the skinny, just because it is even less sweet than the House or Cadillac Margaritas. They also offer a variety of flavors, if that's your style.

The menu here is CRAZY huge, so I would be surprise if you couldn't find something here you loved. As is standard each type of food is split into sections, which eases the search for what you like. 

Everything I have tried here hasn't disappointed. The Chile Relleno, Shrimp tostadas, Veggie Fajitas, all so yummy. And, most importantly, their salsa, guac and beans do not PLAY. So yummy and spicy.

But the service is sub-par (super friendly, but SLOW), and it's a bit more pricey than it's worth (their prices have gone up in the last year). I will not be going back after tonight. My chimichanga was supposed to come with sour cream -- there was less than a tablespoon's worth on the plate, whereas there was probably 3-4 times as much guacamole on the plate. I'd expect a relatively equal amount of sour cream. I pointed this out to both the server and the server assistant and asked for a little bit more (and it took far too long to actually get more sour cream).

I got charged for the sour cream ($1.50), so I asked for it to be removed when I went to pay at the counter. The manager asked ""what was wrong with the sour cream"" and I repeated my complaint and said that I didn't ask for nor need the 1/2 cup of sour cream that they brought me. I just wanted what ought to have come with my dinner.

The manager ended up taking off 1/2 of the cost. So I still paid .75 cents. Now, I know it's that much money, and that wasn't the point of asking for it to be taken off. It's the principle of the thing. I paid $15.99 for a chimichanga that was supposed to come with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream. I don't think it's too much to ask to get more than a micro-dollop of sour cream. Had my meal not come with sour cream, I would have ordered it and happily paid the $1.50.

I was not expecting an attitude from the manager over $1.50, especially when I had a $95 bill. (If I was going to complain and lie about something, I would have complained about something worth more money.) What's more, when a server came up to the counter (not my server), she asked him in Spanish if he'd ""served that girl sour cream."" Like I was lying or something? (And like this white girl can't possibly understand Spanish.) I rarely ask for a bill adjustment, having been a server for so many years, but I've never gotten a rude pushback like this before over a measly buck fifty.

I really enjoy the Puerco En Chili Verde, the Super Burrito, Chicken Enchiladas, and Bistec Ranchero.  But have tried most of the menu and everything has been great. 

The price point is great too. For the amount of food it's hard to beat. The Puerco en Chili Verde is $12.99 and comes with a solid portion of pork onions and tomatoes in a spicy chili verde sauce, tortillas, a heaping side of rice and beans.

While we were in Vegas this past weekend, we all wanted Mexican food and were going to go to Carlos and Charlie's at the Flamingo but thought it probably wouldn't be the best place for authentic Mexican. We were just about to pull out of valet parking at the Flamingo when one of the valet girls offered to give us a few suggestions for alternative Mexican places. She suggested Casa Don Juan or Ciscos (Sisqos? sp?). We went with CDJ.
My cheese enchilada had zero flavor, and the rice was basically the same. The enchiladas were ridiculously spicy, but spicy doesn't matter if there is no flavor behind it. My grandma got the chili relleno (which she gets at all Mex restos) and she didn't like the looks of it. It was soaked in grease and so much cheese you couldn't see if there was even a chili in there. She took one bite, waited a few minutes, and then felt sick. Not good. My grandpa got the bacon wrapped shrimp  and said it was alright but had no flavor, either. 
Chips and salsa were not memorable at all.
Staff was friendly, but that didn't make up for the bland/overly greasy food.

We were enjoying the atmosphere, service and the company of friends & family. The problem occurred when the bill came and there was a random charge of $3.50 for tortillas. Hmmm. Where did that come from? I inquired? Apparently, after a rude explanation from an unfriendly woman employee, we were advised that it was because we ordered extras tortillas to go with our food. So, let's recount...I ordered fajitas. I have been ordering and eating fajitas for a long time. I always make 4. The other order of fajitas needed 4, and the one who ordered Mole ever even got hers. We explained this, but to no avail. Their ratio is that you get 2 flour tortillas or 3 corn tortillas with each order. Really? Really?

THE GUACAMOLE DIP THEY GIVE U WITH UR CHIPS IS NOT FREE. YOU'L GET CHARGED FOR IT EVEN WHEN U DIDN'T ORDER IT.

Was in Vegas and found good reviews so my friend and I thought this would be a gr8 way to end our trip b4 we left...WRONG
BECAUSE
The manager is the rudest person I have ever encountered... in my life. 
He was all smiles when we first arrived, he seated us at our table. Then the waiter brought chips, salsa, and guacamole dip to our table and left. Complimentary RIGHT? All Mexican restaurants do this. We ordered our food, was alright. Got the bill and there was a $5 extra charge for guacamole dip WE NEVER ORDERED.
Of course I thought this was an honest mistake, I told the waiter who then said sometimes the manager forgets to ask the costumers if they want it. Let me get him.  What??/ we were never ""asked."" We call the manager who saw people around us were getting curious so he intentionally raised his voice and said ""I know I asked you"" He never did AT ALL ""it's going to be $5"" and he was being adamant. He added insult to injury by remarking well next time now u know in a snark tone. This guy is a major JERK and a LIAR. It's not the $5 but it's the principle of the matter, the fact he straight out lied and then raised his tone when others were listening to make it seem like he was right. The ironic part of all is that we witnessed the same scenario happen a few tables from us. The party called the owner but this time he quietly disputed with them because there seemed to be a very angry man he was dealing with as they were about to leave. I'm connecting the dots, they probably also had an issue with the MANAGER adding something onto their TAB that they never ASKED for.
I thought I would end my Vegas trip with a bang by eating here but this guys nasty attitude caused us to leave our food. I couldn't stomach eating left overs
from such a shady place.

I've visited Casa Don Juan several times. I usually order a margarita and chips and dip, because their food has never seemed too appetizing or authentic to begin with.  After my last visit, I will NEVER return, not even if I am thirsty. 

I ordered a fish ceviche tostada and was served FROZEN, actually, Frostbit, shredded tilapia on a tortilla shell.  As soon as I saw it, I questioned the waiter on what kind of fish they used for their ceviche as well as how they prepared it.  The waiter did not know, so I waited, and waited for an answer.  After thirty minutes with no response, I inspected it and confirmed the fish was frozen.  I then personally walked the dish to the kitchen and questioned the cooks as to what I was being served.  They confirmed it was frozen fish with lime juice, but that they'd be happy to make me another one. Seriously? They offered a shrimp ceviche, to which I replied ""Is the shrimp frozen too?"", sort of jokingly.  They didn't lie and said that too was frozen shrimp with lime juice. But that they could go back and check that the shrimp was defrosted all the way!  ""NO, Thanks!""   

This is definitely not authentic ceviche, which they should disclose, but that is not even what I am complaining about. These were not even chunks of fish, it was the scraps of frozen bits you find at a bottom of a bag of frozen fish.  Why would you serve that to your customers?  If you are out of something on the menu, your customers prefer you tell them you're all out and not being served scraps of frozen bits of fish.  Or maybe it always looks this way.  Is making $8 dollars on the sale worth it?

Needless to say, I highly recommend you DO NOT order ceviche, fish or shrimp, at Casa Don Juan.   I haven't had much else there, like I said before but this is one of those things that is unforgivable when it comes to food.  If I could rate zero stars, I would.

Also, I paid my bill 100%, because they still charged me for this food.  I was with my niece and nephew and they ordered burritos, and were charged and extra $1.50 for sour cream and another $1.50 for cheese, per burrito.  That's just ridiculous. The waiter said it would come out of his check if we did not pay for it when I started complaining, so I just paid for it as to not cause a scene.

Aside from their AC not working at 117 degrees outdoors,asking to be placed at a different table because the heat was unbearable, our server Jesus B.  was trying to pocket $100 our friend payed without letting us know. Our friend was the first to leave so we watched him as he payed his food on his way out. Little did we know he was being generous and payed more than what he consumed. Once the bill arrived I reviewed it but his food was still being charged on it. We waited for Jesus to come back around to our table and when he finally did I questioned him about the money that was given him to cover part of the bill. He would have never told us money was payed to him at this point if we hadn't seen it all. he proceeded to tell us he only payed $80 and to go ahead and just pay what was left on a bill of $186. So, to leave $100 dollars. REALLY !!! I call my friend to confirm the amount that was payed and he said $100. At this point he turned a million colors not expecting us to call and confirm. We then were pretty fed up and offended at his shady service so we left $80 on the table and we explained why, his only response was ""oh Ok, thats fine, and we all walked out.

Apparently Casa Don Juan not only has ton of reviews but friend told me second oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Really? I can tell you from the minute you open the door OMG not only does this place scream personality but the interior design is old school. Not even mentioning the fact the restaurant is located in downtown area that shady more so in the evening. They do have other business around and part of the whole revitalizing downtown scene. 

I came for early dinner with friends. It was my first time. Like mention before walk in the HH hour margarita menu board right outside next to the door screams personality. Not only from the day of the dead art on chalkboard but all the different flavor margaritas in different color. Once step foot inside there so much random stuff going on not sure what stood out more for me. The day of the dead characters on shelf, the history of Casa Don Juan, the photos, and even have zoltar but instead of your normal character you have Casa Don Juan herself. Kind of creepy. My opinion. They two separate dining areas and bar area (they have machines at the bar area). The waitstaff outfit got personality. 

The menu...swear by far one of the biggest menus seen in Mexican restaurant. It was like seven different pages. I had hard time figuring out should get the first time. Thankfully Yelp family pushing the fresh guacamole. We ordered that for appetizer or starter with the chips and salsa. The guacamole was awesome. It talked refreshing, fresh, the color tell used perfect ripe avocado nice green, and had nice seasonings. Definitely dish would recommend! My entree went with two tamales. Not often order tamales and not sure other Mexican restaurants if standard menu item. Whatever the case I got one chicken with green salsa and one pork with red sauce. The dish came with rice and beans. The tamales were amaZing. Everything was was point from the wrapping and once open it up jaw dropping. Nice hot, moist, and the fillings on both were hell of tasty and the sauce. I would say some of the best tamales every had in life. Each one was nice size. The rice and beans was solid. All the food is very reasonable price but honesty Mexican food not that expensive. The thing that stands out Casa Don Juan they say authentic Mexican food and it REALLY is authentic. They have lot of the traditional dishes that also on the menu. They also get best of las vegas awards. So 700 plus reviews and awards later Casa Don Juan Restaurant had truly stood the test of time. Happy that my friends suggested going here for dinner.

2235858,2011-08-28,6,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"This is a very hard rating for me to settle on. If Casa Don Juan was a bar without a food menu, I would give it 5 stars right now for the amazing pina coladas served inside a whole pineapple. I wonder how many cases of pineapples they must go through in a week. The flavor from having fresh pieces of pineapple blended inside the creamy, frozen beverage is just perfect. They also make fresh lemonade that is very good, along with other flavors of aguas frescas.

The food warrants a much lower rating. I enjoyed the chips and salsa, but nothing else tasted fresh. The cheese tamal was bland and dry, tasting like it had been frozen. The chile relleno was also strange, like a wet towel filled with a cheez-like mass.  I should have just ordered a burrito so as not to challenge the cooks too much. I hope they don't freeze those, too.

Until Don Juan decides to put the same level of effort into his food options as he does his beverage menu, I'm content to sit in the front waiting area, sipping my fresh pina coladas between the collection of sombreros and the wall dedicated to Frida Kahlo. Just bring me some chips and salsa if I'm getting a little tipsy.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,4,3,3,5T-RvNE3KQ9_Y__6VU9ebw

2241198,2013-10-03,0,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town and it doesn't hurt that it's located downtown near where I work. The service here is always wonderful and you are greeted as soon as you enter. And in my experience, unless you come during First Fridays, you are typically seated immediately. Once seated, drink orders are taken pretty quickly and then fresh chips and salsa are brought to your table. Sometimes they automatically bring you guacamole too, which is an extra $5.99 charge, so if you don't want it you may have to tell them upfront.

The food is priced reasonably, although it can be considered expensive for Mexican food, depending on what you order. Regardless, the food comes out quickly and the portions are fairly large. I usually get the same few entrees: huevos rancheros if it's breakfast time, or enchiladas or fajitas if it's lunch/dinner time. The food is delicious, comes out hot, and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I've had margaritas on a few occassions and they are pretty large, whether frozen or on the rocks, although not very strong (surprise, surprise). If you like it strong, you may have to ask them for a few extra shots...

Sometimes when I'm here the owners and managers walk around the restaurant to check on each table, which I find nice. Not many casual restaurants focus on customer service anymore and it's always about speed now. The waitresses here are patient but speedy with drinks/orders at the same time. The only thing negative about this place is that parking can be kind of tough if you come when it's busy. They only have a couple dozen spots in the back, as well as some meter parking out front.

My SO and I stopped in here for dinner after going to an event nearby. The bean dip was really bland, like it was straight from a can. The salsa was marginally better but still sub par. 

He ordered enchiladas - 2 chicken, 1 cheese. The chicken didn't have any flavor, he said he would give them 2 stars. 

I ordered a cheese and jalapeño tamal and a cheese enchilada. The tamal could have used some more time in the steamer. The masa was bland and it wasn't fully cooked in the center. Inedible. The enchilada was better but still not very good. How can something be both soggy and crunchy at the same time?

Is it a show stopping place for Mexican food? Not really but if you want that authentic, non-chain feel that few and far between seem to offer in this town, then check out Casa Don Juan's. 

4 margaritas (I had company OK), guacamole, 2 entrees, and feeling happy and full cost us about $40! Not bad for good eatin.",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,2,1,3,47CgbaiK1xAmkzQ95Xj9IA

Every time I have gone they have been incredibly busy, yet they are still quick to get chips, drinks and orders out. The food is amazing. The guac is def fresh, the cheese dip is a meal in itself and its always difficult to save room for the amazing fried ice cream. 

I have ordered something different every time I've gone - the veggie burrito and the taco's are probably the best in my book, but it all looks good.

Being a Mexican food connoisseur I'd stay they are above average but not the best in Las Vegas. Some places I see could use room for improvement are their salsa and been dip. The salsa wasn't bad however it was a bit watery and the bean dip wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be. I ordered a cheese enchilada & a chili relleno. The cheese enchilada was good. I order one every where I go. The sauce could have a little more spice to it as they were slightly on the tomato-y side but they were very very good. The chili relleno was the first time I had ever had one and it was delicious. We ordered the green chili verde and the pork was tender . Rice & Beans were good.

There is a burrito for that price - a full shrimp burrito, which I did not get, but had I known I was going to be charged that price, I would've ordered that. The least they could have done was tell me that I was going to get a $5 up-charge for the laughable sauce and drop of guacamole lol.

However, the food has remained really consistent.

What I don't love is using my groupon and being charged more at the table.  It sounds like fraud to me. Wait a minute...the hostess and waiter both said it is fraud too.  They blame Billy the manager and of course groupon.  The waiter was a nasty little guy till it came time for the tip.  The groupon clearly states 2 lunch entree's for $9.99.  Fine print states a value of up to just under $22.  All ok with me.  You can even take a peak at the menu via the groupon link.  The interesting ""fraudy"" part is that the prices reflected on the business website are not the same as on the menu.  Each item is about $2 more on the actual menu.  So it is impossible to actually use the groupon for the purchase price.  You have no choice but to pay more.  Again, the food is great. The groupon/fraud crap makes me not want to ever go back out of principal only.  Billy, fix the price discrepancy or honor the groupon...and teach your staff to not tell me it's ""fraud"" and they agree it is wrong.  The cashier stated that they have tried to call groupon and groupon is in control.  The interesting part is that the prices on the actual Casa Don Juan website are the same as on the groupon link.

We were in the neighborhood and decided to give them a shot during the ""Cinco de Mayo"" celebrations.  They were planning three days of festivites 3rd-5th we decided on the kickoff party on Sunday.  How disappointing this visit was.  

The staff the greeted us right away and we were seated shortly.  This is where the service took a turn for the worst.  It took several minutes for someone to greet us at the table and get the beverages ordered.  We decided on a couple of margarita's one on the rocks and one blended.  On the rocks is my preference but my lady friend had the blended and you could not taste the tequila or sweet and sour in that one.  The blended was not the best tasting drink I have had very watery and lacked flavor besides the salted rim.   

Now the big fiasco starts during the order process.  We were looking for a veggie burrito which they had on the menu for $8.00 or so but the server said No! you should order the number 35 which was $13.99.  We needed a build your own burrito with beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guac wrapped in a tortilla.  Easy right?? Well, I had to repeat myself about SIX times to ensure it would come out correctly and even then it did not.  Beans were served on the side with rice and the tortilla was filled with lettuce, cheese and sour cream only. Not sure what happened??? I brought it to there attention and all I got was Sorry! That's it. WTF?

My Enchilladas were ok.  I had the order of 3 and went with one of each of beef, chicken and cheese.   I opted for both green and red sauce on top. one was supposed to be spicier than the other but I could not tell.  The kids share the nacho order but for $6.99 and made incorrectly than requested.  We recieved a plate full of tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, and sour cream.  No tomato or guac as requested but the meat was on the side which was correct.  

The food was completely ordinary.  Nothing memorable at all.  what was memorable was the service or lack there of.  Slow throughout the entire dining experience.  What was more of a concern was the lack of enthusiam on the employees faces.  I did not see anyone besides the host smiling.  The bar tenders both the male and female looked as if they were mean as junk yard dogs. Very unwelcoming.   This is supposed to be a ""Cinco De Mayo"" Celebration and none of the staff looked like they were having fun or were even interested in working Sunday.  What a shame.

I also had an awesome vegetarian burrito (only like $5) that was simple and delicious.  I got a side of mole to dip it in, as I love to do with any place that has mole,  it was very good.  As you know, moles vary quite a bit.  This one was dark, smokey, and had a stronger balance towards a rich pepper flavor as opposed to a sweeter chocolate one.

The reason for 3 stars is because they took awhile to even ask us for drinks. After we ordered drinks it took them about another 10-15 minutes to come by and acknowledge us. They finally got to the table and asked us what we would like to eat. I ordered a beef chimichanga, which was delicious. However my girlfriend ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas and upon receiving the food, it was cold. It also didn't have enough seasoning in it.

2669958,2010-07-01,4,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"OK guys let me start off by saying until just about 3 years ago I have lived in Orange and Los Angeles Counties.  I was born and raised in So Cal. I have done my grocery shopping at Mercado's.  I've had many a drunken, reckless, eat till you burst and drink till you puke night in baja.  I have smuggled fireworks and Cuban, or what I was told were, Cuban cigars across the border and yes, I have most likely eaten dog or donkey tacos in Tijuana.  So If I am well versed enough to speak my mind about anything it would be Mexican food.  With all that being said...On with the review.

My quest for good humble Mexican food in the Vegas valley has been 3 years in the making and time after time I have been disappointed.  This place however was good.  It was not bad but it was not out of this world fantastic.  I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada 3 tacos, one carne asada, one al pastor, and one lengua to get a full range of flavors.  The lengua was pretty damn good moist, tender and flavorful, the same goes for the pastor it had good flavor, good texture and the taste was pretty impressive.  Now this was not the case with the asada.  The carne asada taco was dry and overcooked I would like to think I just got a bad batch but who knows.  

OK on to the ceviche. The ceviche was again not fantastic but better than just average.  I would like to have seen whole shrimp instead of the diced pieces of shrimp that they used here .  There was also a lot of diced tomatoes to act as filler.  If this same exact restaurant was located in Long Beach, CA I most likely would have given it 3 stars instead of 4, but considering the number of bad experiences I've had in Vegas, Casa Don Juan has acted as a glimmer of hope and provided this Californian a taste of home.",AoII0-uM9z0EesGnb9YCjQ,3,4,4,3jlHskoRBMcuXYfTY0ttMQ

Did I mention the make fried ice cream with Fruity Pebbles? SO GOOD! I've been here twice before and had a wonderful experience each time with great service - today was almost bad enough to make me not want to return.

The waiter was exceptionally bad. First, my friend tried to order a side of soup; apparently the sides of soup aren't sold on Sundays, okay, that's weird but whatever, she adjusted. Her salad came a good 15 minutes before my chicken, so she was nearly finished by the time I barely started. We went to order our favorite, the fried ice cream. We were kept waiting for about 10 minutes after ordering and then the waiter came back to tell us that there was no fried ice cream today because the ice cream was too soft. Um, you can't stick that in the freezer? His reply was chilling (even if the ice cream wasn't) : ""The freezers aren't strong enough to freeze ice cream."" 

WHAT?

While I was screaming to get out of there and questioning where my meat was kept, if not in this subpar freezer, my friend asked him to recommend an alternate dessert. His response: ""I don't really like the food here. I like Puerto Rican food better so I don't really eat here. The sopapillas look kinda good.""

We ended up giving up on getting anything sweet from there and just flat out left. The waiter didn't charge us for my friend's salad, which was appreciated considering 2/3 of our orders were rejected, but my advice to that waiter - if you don't like the food at the restaurant, at least have one or two recommendations that you can somewhat stomach! Sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.

Still deciding if we'll be back... that fried ice cream is pretty magical. But I think I want proof the freezer works, first.",PcqqldYB1hi0Mb6cwb2caA,2,0,3,kt2QJUkarLLQCbddKMwdAQ

The last time we went was for my boyfriends birthday. My mom ordered a whole fried fish covered in garlic. The thing could have easily fed 4 people. It smelled wonderful. However, I have a problem eating anything that stares back at me. I opted for two shredded beef enchiladas.  They were very flavorful and came with very large portions of rice and beans covered in cheese. My bf had a combo plate and he also seemed to enjoy it as well.

The portions are huge and very filling. That is usually the problem for me at Casa Don Juan. Now I am not complaining about being served a goodly amount of food for some pretty reasonable prices, but for some reason, every time I go, and no matter the amount of food I eat, it sinks like a stone later. And its not like I over eat each time. I seriously go into a food coma afterwards, and it feels like my stomach is filled with lead.

As for the margaritas and pina coladas, hmm, they were not sweet. I've had better ones at Outback . . .

I do have to add that they have excellent service. The server asked if it was a special occasion. We told him yes. They were going to bring us some free ice cream but we told them we were Very full. Instead he brought a plate of whipped cream which he dabbed on my bf's nose and the servers sang a birthday song to him. They also have one of those photo ops, where they take a picture of your group and give you a free postcard then later try and sell you a photo (totally optional and there was no pressure).",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,0,0,3,Th9VCWxzG5Jg54Pl1tE7aw

We opted to sit at the bar and avoid waiting for thirty minutes to eat. The bar area was pretty dirty, both the back bar and the front bar had old plates and previous diner's old cocktail glasses on them along with a half eaten bag of Cheetos, I'm assuming they were the bartender's snack. 

My wife and I decided to share a combo plate, two tacos, a Chile Relleno and Tamale. This wasn't the prettiest plate of food, but it did what it was supposed to do, fill us up. The tamale was pretty dry, too much masa and not enough Verde chicken inside. The filling inside was decent, but was hard to find. The Chile Relleno was a cheese bomb, the cheese was all I could taste, they used a very sharp cheddar and it blew any chile flavor out the window. I tried the taco, and after one bite it fell apart. The meat was flavored nicely, but the shell was something that reminded me of taco day in High School.

The parking lot looked pretty intimidating because of the tow signs so plastered all over the place. We were seated and the waitress came by shortly to greet us and take our drink orders. We didn't decide yet so we asked for waters in the meantime.  

At least 15 minutes went by and she never came back. I really want to leave at that point. Finally we flag another server to get our waitress. She finally shows up and takes our order. 

We ordered 2 lunch specials and 2 horchatas. The lunch specials came with a salad. It was the cheapest ingredients they could find. They made the salads swim in dressing. It was really disgusting. I couldn't eat it.  Horrible just horrible.  The entrees were out pretty quickly.  The tacos were generic tasting.  The refried beans are the ones from the can and the rice was bland. I don't understand why they name themselves ""authentic,"" because it's far from it. Anyways we had to ask for our drinks to another server. Why am I not surprised? The staff must of been taking a siesta at that time.

This place is a disaster. Not sure how they have 4 stars. Maybe they told their whole family to write a good review on their behalf. Worst Mexican food I've had in my life.",M4FlNdVn_K2L-p6NyaI-Og,2,2,1,lElrDciY2ZNXhKfue2txcw

I think the food ingredients, authentic, put it over the top. Although this is Mexican American food, it's just as good as anything you'll find in Corpus Christi or Chula Vista. 

Lots of seafood possibilities here, too. If you're a low-carb, veggie/vegan, let them know. There are sneaky ingredients at work here, but they'll listen and alter recipes to taste/preference. 

It has formal dining, and lots of Las Vegas locals, rather than the tourist business, although it's located in the very touristy Arts District (currently being repaved, but lots of free parking). This is my fourth time here, and it's been good each time. Recommended for small groups. A little kitschy here and there, but lots of fun and good food.

Yes, I realize that the word planned coincidence is an oxymoron, an oxymoron like Casa Don Juan.  First of all, the decor looks a little too festive and forcefully Mexican.  Any Mexican joint with that many framed photos of Frida, well, has something to prove.  Second of all, I ended up there as a result of an odd calculation with a close girlfriend who lives across town, as it so happens, Casa Don Juan seems the exact middle point of distance for us.  With such contrived factors in play, I expected the food to disappoint.  What a pleasant surprise Don Juan was!

The frigid January evening in the Vegas dessert is off to a fun start with really good live Mariachi music, the soft and painfully romantic kind of Mariachi that makes any woman wish she was living life with a South-of-the-Border lover, or maybe just with Mariachi music as the soundtrack.

A request for black beans (a blessing and curse from P90X nutrition plan) ends up with a waiter's ""no"" response, accompanied by the ""this is authentic Mexican, we don't do healthy"" glance.  However, he was nice enough to give me whole beans before they refry them in lard.  Beans were good, rice was good, tortilla was warm, and good.  But the mole sauce on the chicken was, well, a perfect reminder of my college crush on Mexican culture.  Flavorful spices and a hint of chocolate left heat on my tongue to be remembered.

So now I'm listening to La Paloma Negra by Lila Downs for the rest of the evening, the things that good mole will do to you!",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,3,3,4,BF-Z1aOmgbblz00Kq69xHg

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #13 **
.
This place was just somewhere we stumbled upon because we were hungry before a YEE that was happening across the street & I needed to eat something before the event since there wasn't food other than hot dogs which are like one of my least favorite foods. The inside seems like an authentic back in the days Mexican restaurant. Whole bunch of COLORFUL decorations everywhere w/ stuff hanging all over the ceilings. 
.
We sat at the bar since we were going to be quick & we just kept sitting at the bar ever since. There is this one guy bartender that we love w/ his Hispanic accent he is quick & funny & attentive just right. Forgot his name... =/

we didn't really explore to much into the menu &  just ordered what we were craving at the moment.

CHIPS W/ SALSA & BEAN DIP $0 - AHHHH this is the best kind of complimentary chips & salsa bean dip that we have tasted. i dunno what they use in their been dip but it is just SO addicting!!! literally makes you want to order a whole bowl and put it on EVERYTHING

CHICKEN W/ GREEN SAUCE TAMALES $3.75 - the chicken was nice & tender. could have possibly used a little more seasoning but i just added some of the complimentary salsa & bean dip.

CHEESE W/ JALAPENOS $3.75 - this was cheesy oooo eee goooeyy yummyness & it was warm & just perfectly made

TOSTADAS CAMARON $7.75 - this dish was freaken AWSOME! SO much freaken shrimp for a little taco. Definitely had to use some of the complimentary chips to eat the rest of the shrimp. The shrimp was chopped up w/ some veggies mixed w/ citrus & topped off w/ avocado.

Definitely will be coming back every time we want some margaritas & tamales & tostadas!!

This time around I went in with a groupon (2 Dinner entrees and 2 Jumbo Cadillac Margaritas for a $46 value) and a group of 3 people.

We tried ordering a Thursday special of Sopes without the margaritas they come with and we were told they couldn't charge us for the food without the drinks. Having tasted the jumbo cadillac margaritas we had received from the initial groupon we turned down the offer of getting additional margaritas. Why you might ask? They tasted less than mediocre and whoever made them was horrible at mixing! It also shows the lack of flexibility and management experience when the manager doesn't know how much to charge for food if its not printed on a 'special' pamphlet as well. We didn't mind paying a difference, and ended up ordering one Sope as a separate dish which truly wasn't a sope but a tortilla with chorizo on it.  

I give Casa Don Juan 3 stars for seating us promptly and being attended quickly by the servers with chips, bean dip and drinks. The restaurant was clean and it had musicians playing authentic Mexican Corridos with guitars. Definitely set the mood. The cheese dip was great and so was the handmade corn tortillas! But the food is fair, there's no sopa de fideo and we couldn't get over the horrible alcoholic beverages. Some of the staff doesn't understand English, glad we're Mexican and can speak spanish! Parking is also bit tricky and difficult to find-  unless you want to park at a meter-  because it was packed! Not the best yet not the worst experience. Our final bill was $65, we only paid about $30 with tip due to the groupon. For that amount you could go to another Mexican restaurant in a nicer area/location.

Green chilaquiles is always the way to go, they were not soggy or too crunchy they were perfect. It was ""brunch"" so we ordered some micheladas as well, very yummy as well!

In the past, I have enjoyed the margaritas but not really cared much for the food.  This last time, even the rocks margarita came out lukewarm and was unsatisfying.  The appetizer salsa isn't spicy, the appetizer beans are flavorless and the guacamole was really only tasty because of the onion in it.  My entrée was passable, as was my date's.  One positive aside form the friendly server is how fast the entrees arrived - FAST!  Overall, the portions are great too, but the food quality is on par with Macayo's - lots of cheese, but not much flavor.  If you like the food from that other restaurant (and many do) then you'll probably like the food here, but nothing about it seems particularly authentic or even vaguely interesting.

The staff is very friendly, unless they are busy. Maybe they don't schedule sufficient staff for the busiest times. 

So, food is terrific, service is usually timely, and staff is friendly...

I dropped a star because on my last visit we asked to move to one of two vacant booths. The hostess refused to seat us, saying they were reserved. Okay, except it was 10 minutes before anyone was seated in one of those vacant booths; and 20 minutes for the second booth. It made us feel unappreciated as customers.

We came in for dinner around 7 and were seated promptly. They have a small parking lot in the back which is awesome as finding parking in the area can be a problem in itself. Like most Mexcian spots, Don Juan gets props for complimentary chips and salsa but they made it even better with a side of bean dip yum!

Located right on Main Street near Charleston, Don Juan is located near the Downtown Arts District and gets packed during First Friday, They restaurant itself tries to capture that old-town Mexican feel with it's brightly colored walls, titled floors and hanging florals. The night we came in there was a mariachi band in the next room playing for diners - a nice touch. 

The menu is huge, easy to get lost in, and has pretty much every incarnation of Mexican food you could want. There specialty seems to be tamales but they have a pretty wide range of seafood offerings as well. I thought it was a little over priced, two chicken tacos with rice and beans were like $13. My  smothered carne asada burritto was ok, it looked like a giant enchiliada but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The carne asada was very dry and the fillings could have used a bit more spice. The re-fried beans were mediocre but the Spanish style rice was pretty good. I just didn't feel like it was worth the $15 I spent, there are alot of great culinary finds in the downtown area and I feels like Casa Don Juan could do more.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,8,3,2,U8sCxU3QjlaMDv1rsnd8FA

After repeating my order three times because my waiter just couldn't get it right, my order still came out wrong. I notice the waiter struggle with taking my order so I repeated my order in Spanish (not bc I'm racist - for that person that felt the need to attack me on that) but because I had no problem being patient and making sure he got my order right. And he managed to mess up the table next to us (maybe he was new?) We went at a time that wasn't busy but felt he was all over the place but couldn't really manage to get anything right. 

How does a Mexican restaurant get Tacos so wrong? This place manages to do just that. The food itself was horrible. We came here as it was highly recommended to be the best Mex Restaurant in Vegas but were highly disappointed w the food itself. 

And to top it off we had to wait a very long time to get our check. Only reason we left a tip was for the bus boys who manages to keep up with our refills. Our waiter just took our orders, managed to screw our orders and we had to track him down for our check. (Not exaggerating - my husband had to track him down bc he neglected to come by our table to check on us) If you are looking for a decent Mex Restaurant than try to avoid this place. It sucks!

The first thing I noticed when we entered was the amount of mexican people inside. No, not just the employees, but many of the patrons. You know its a good sign if you see the ethnicity of a restaurant frequenting it. 

The chips were pretty good. Standard hard corn tortilla served with both salsa and bean dip. The dip was a bit bland but it tasted pretty pure. The salsa had plenty of flavorful salsa. Oh and the margaritas are pretty strong, which is nice I suppose. There's a woman who takes your picture and then tries to sell it back to you in a cheesy Vegas themed frame. A hilarious attempt to squeeze money out of a local.

The actual food did not disappoint. My girlfriends chimichanga was easily the best I've ever tasted.
I opted for the bistecca ranchera. It was surely the best ranchers sauce I have ever had the pleasure if eating. The steak was well prepared if not a bit chewy. The rice was excellent, as was the guacamole. The flour tortillas were fluffy wnd singed just the way  I like em. I  could see this place earning a 5 from me, but I'll have to see how they do spicy food.

Inside is spacious and the walls are filled with Mexican decor. This last visit the place was packed, so I thought the wait would be long, but we were seated at a half booth half table right away. Our drink orders were soon taken and our server was nice about giving us time to look over the menu. 

Chips, Bean Dip and Salsa - All complimentary and tasty. The salsa was fresh however I did favor the bean dip even though I'd have loved some cheese on top. Chips were good. 

Cheese Dip with Jalapenos ($6.50) - When the hostess sat us she asked if we wanted some cheese dip and I politely declined. When the person came to take our drink order he too asked if we wanted any cheese dip and I again politely declined. When our server asked if we wanted any cheese dip, I figured it was complimentary since we were asked 3 times if we'd like some. Wrong! Also a waste of money that could have went to a margarita instead. The cheese dip was a very small portion (same size as bean dip and salsa come in) and was not only thin and runny, but it really lacked flavor. I expected to taste some spice since It was supposed to have jalapenos in it. 

2 Enchiladas and a Taco Combo #3 ($12.99) - I chose chicken for the taco and even though the chicken tasted great there certainly could have been more of it. I requested that the enchiladas be made with flour tortillas instead of corn and they had no problem making them that way which I appreciated. There was a lot of sauce on my plate and while it did taste great, I would ask for them to go easy on it next time. The enchiladas were perfect and they didn't skimp on the cheese. The beans that accompanied the dish were very good and I liked that there was cheese on them. 

I enjoyed a few strawberry margaritas and the price especially for Downtown was on point at $6.50 each and they were not weak. If you don't want to mess with driving Downtown they do have a Summerlin location. It's worth noting that Casa Don Juan has a breakfast menu that's offered from 7 am - 11 am and they also have a kids menu.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,53,53,4,Hs7sKeMmlNyAfhHufLGUhA

3586686,2013-01-29,0,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,I've been to Casa a few times.  It's solid Mexican food with a good ambiance.  On the Friday night I went they had a live singer performing so that was a nice touch.  It was packed but we were seated quickly and served within five minutes of placing our order. Their menu is incredibly extensive with the typical combo plates you find at most Mexican places.  My first time having a Torta.  Mexican sandwich as described by the waiter.  No idea I had been missing out.  It was good and I didn't leave filling stuff like I usually do after a heavy Mexican meal.,YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,1,1,4,NZPaOBmy9BtOYxrOCzeJLw
3592811,2014-10-25,2,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"My friends and I (a party of about 9) went for dinner last night and experienced a few things.

* There's very limited parking. The parking they do have is unlit and in a bad area of town. Definitely thought my car was going to get broken into because I had to park in a dark alley.

* Waitstaff is more than a little pushy. Especially the guy that walks around trying to sell you an overpriced photo he took of your party. Not hospitable at all.

* Portions were generous, but the food was mediocre. Our waiter even said that Lindo Michoacan had better food.

* 3 of the members of my party wanted more sauce to put on their burritos and tamales. The server brought out 3 portions of green sauce, but failed to inform us that sides of sauce were $3 EACH. When I saw an extra $9 added to our bill, I politely asked if they could remove the charge. I was told that wasn't possible so politely asked to talk to a manager. She also told us that it wasn't possible to take the charge off, even though we weren't notified when we ordered. 

For putting the business ahead of their customer, Casa Don Juan has lost a customer.",oKl7ScF9KZ0YL-QMSWrXzA,6,2,1,IAEoLQ7Y_lrH-dKiU7KXZw

When we were finished he didn't even bother picking up our plates we had to stack them up  before he realized he should pick them up.. 

As for the food , that receives 5 *****, it didn't fail us... our friends were impressed with the food and said they'll try the one on Buffalo .. the CDJ on Buffalo has an awesome waiter and I wish I could remember his name, when we dine there we look for him to sit in his section ..",QBzswob0srR2mj8K4549lw,0,0,5,Np6bnJAyNq0ggqnUkyGBrA

disguised by waitstaff dressed in traditional clothing and abuelita making tortillas a mano(like nasty Lindo Michoacan(barf sound)

John's House builds your anticipation up only to let you down in the end.
So we got the Guacamole to start, Wifey ordered the Mole de Pollo and I ordered the Chile Relleno/Chicken Enchilada combination plate.

Guacamole-The version that I whipped up at The Yelpmazing Race in under a minute tasted better, and Horchata is from the machine, not homemade.

Chile Relleno-one of my benchmarks for authenticity, no stringy, cheesy goodness, but a weird brown(overcooked?) firm cheese that had a texture like a VERY firm tofu in a barely in-tact chile held by a bunch of toothpicks, very disappointing.(How bout a throwdown Bobby Flay Style?)Enchilada was aight.

Chicken Mole-We're expecting bone-in chicken pieces, but instead, fricken chicken fajita strips double as the meat for the Mole. Even worse,
the spice, sweetness, and smokiness from the sauce tastes kinda off with a tanginess like a barbecue sauce!?!?!

Unfinished entrees, and totally dissappointed, a strong fishy odor permeated the dining room from a fried fish that was being delivered to the table next to us(feel sorry for that next victim)

The Mexican food is close to authentic, with rustic elements and more seafood than what you might associate with Mexican fare, though I'm told that is the real deal.  The rice and beans were scrumptious. Only downside might be getting a table during peak times and parking on the street.

My food came out amazingly quick which was awesome. As for the food, everything was good. Sadly that's about as far as I can go with it. The salsa for the chips was watery. No onion, tomato or much of anything to be honest. When it came to the guacamole... it seemed like it had been put through a blender. Perhaps I like my guacamole and salsa on the chunky side so to each their own. The chicken mole was once again good but not great. For fifteen dollars a person I would rather eat like a king at a mom and pop Mexican restaurant where there's a little more grease and a lot more flavor.

Overall I feel like this is a very refined (bland) Mexican restaurant. Their food is good but by no means amazing. Then again a lot of people tell me how delicious Robertos is...

We arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.

When my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.

I ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.

Everyone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.

We had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!

At that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.

I tried my boyfriend's Chile relleno and I didn't like the cheese inside. He said he liked them but he's had better. I just wasn't that impressed by the whole meal. The waitress was awesome so we did appreciate that. Also, the fresh-squeezed lemonade was great. I would definitely get that again.

I took my family to Casa Don Juan in July 2016, and we all loved our meal and experience.  

The restaurant is located about 1 mile from the Downtown Fremont street.  From the Strip is was a $6 Uber ride, and worth the ride.

The restaurant has a great old school decor and ambience.  There is a lot of Frida Kahlo pictures and art on the walls.

The service was fantastic, very friendly, professional and helpful.

After being seated you are given free chips, salsa and bean dip.  Something that you have to pay extra for at all the Mexican restaurants on the Strip.  The Chips and dips are very good.

The margaritas are large, delicious and you can tell they put a fair amount of tequila in the drinks.    The margaritas are about $10.

The food tasted delicious and fresh.  Everyone loved they way their meal tasted.  The portion size was perfect.  Enough to fill you up, but not make you sorry you ate the last bite.

The prices were very reasonable, especially when considering the quality and portion size.  You'll get so much more for your money, compared to restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Our bill was about $75 for four dinners, 2 margaritas, and desert.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be having dinner at Casa Don Juan.  I would also encourage all of my family and friends to enjoy this great restaurant.",lvD3j2ikhB48CZWMf-uLlg,0,0,5,zMUHygT9cOvnrRnfdW_aMg

Why not....is the question I ask when I realize we've wasted 3 years NOT eating here! This place is awesome! You can sit inside or out, your preference, and inside is fantastically bright, vibrant, and energetic. The waitstaff is QUICK. 'Let me get you a drink' 'Here are your complimentary chips, salsa and beans' 'What can I get you today?' They are speedy and friendly, and wonderful. A man even came over and took a complimentary photo of us...of which he then tried to sell us extra copies - we declined - but it was fun to have a Valentine's Day pic of us at a random Mexican joint :) 

The menu is intense - so try to either use a Yelp review ahead of time or at least have some clue as to what you're looking for before cracking it open. There are bright colorful photos that represent what the food looks like - and it actually does. ...and the photos aren't repulsive - which is a bonus!

I'm telling you for real, that within 5 minutes of ordering, our food was at the table. I had enough time to check into Yelp and ask my husband what he thought of the place and our food arrived. I was honestly shocked. The waiter said it oftentimes surprises him. The food was great. I got the #9 which was 3 chicken floutas, rice and beans. The floutas were HOT - yes, like they were just prepared. Crispy tortilla and succulent chicken with a kick - I didn't want to stop eating them, alas they disappeared quickly. The. rice. was. amazing. So delicious!! And guys - I do not like refried beans...except I ate all of them on this day. Yes. They were awesome! My husband got 2 chicken tacos, rice and beans and he nearly licked his plate. He kept saying over and over that he would definitely be returning to consume more food. ...and when Mikey's happy, Brooke is happy. 

The bill only ran us $28.10 - I think that's pretty legit for a delicious meal that we couldn't find anything wrong with. We'll definitely be back, and can't wait to try the margaritas cuz they looked b o m b.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,2,5,3q1bUmWHZD7t9anoTBoUYg

I shared a Saturday afternoon lunch with my dad and grandmother and we all were impressed with the quality, flavor and portion sizes we received!  The wait staff was happy to bring my dad a bowl of their hottest sauce, as he didn't think the regular salsa that came with the chips and beans was hot enough.

My carnitas was tender and juicy, served with guacamole and lime alongside of some of the best spanish rice I've had.  My dad proclaimed the chorizo in his huevos con chorizo to be very flavorful - he said it wasn't spicy at all, but he can't be believed in that.  The tortillas that accompanied our entrees were obviously very fresh and hand-made.

The service was friendly, but could have been a tad more attentive.  Lunch for three with coffee and tea, plus a dessert to-go was $41.  All in all, no complaints - and I'll definately be bringing friends and family back to Casa Don Juan.",WbKKJNRPIHB6l7csIV-2qQ,1,0,4,RUNRU0-_8NCebgDNNzeWaA

We start heading to the restaurant first of all I'm going to start off by the location is dangerous so much crime and just really sketchy and dangerous in general, so we go inside kindly ask the hostess that we had purchased a Groupon special & if we could take out instead of dining in we didn't want to be there too long since the location was very dangerous & the hostess rudely said no so I said okay that's fine I don't like being rude or disrespectful so I said never mind we will just dine in and they rudely sat us down never asked for our drink nothing they sent like 4 different servers because I guess nobody wanted to be our server they were all rude as soon as we mentioned the Groupon special we had purchased left & never came back to our table! Finally another different server came by and asked for our drink 30min later & the same thing happened when I mentioned the Groupon special he left never came back and I'm Latina so I understand Spanish and I over heard all of the servers  judging us, talking about how we wanted our food for free and we were broke when I had showed all of the our Groupon voucher and nobody has a right to tip if you feel like they aren't doing they're job as an employee! We wouldn't go to a damn restaurant knowing we don't have money like it's common sense I'm not stupid they were making fun saying oh im not serving them ""cheap assholes"" just being really disrespectful and judgmental for no reason so my boyfriend and I got up walked out really upset and disappointed & I'm not over exaggerating or being an ass because Ive worked the restaurant industry for over 4 years so I know how to be a server, host, and manager and let me tell you this restaurant does not know how to run a business!

I like the story of Frieda on the wall. It encourged me to watch a movie about her, which was very good. I found this place about 2 1/2 yrs ago. Way across town from where I live but I went there for the ambiance and food.  It was very good the first second and third time I ate there. Then last spring I went with my daughter. They had done remodeling and removed this cool palapa bar that used to be inside. This time the food was bad. My daughter didn't like her food, I didn't like my enchiladas which I had liked on previous occasions. Today I went in and ordered the special...flautas. He asked me chicken or beef. I asked to have one of each, he seemed confused. Then he asked me flour or corn tortillas. I said I thought Flautas were flour tortillas. He said OK flour. At that moment I knew he only knew enough English to get by. I thought taquitos were corn and flautas were flour? I get the plate of food. The rice andbeans were actually good this time. The flautas were very small. Every other restaurant I have ordered Flautas, they come with sour cream and guacamole. Not these. As plain as could be. I like salsas but theirs was bland and watery. My boyfriend ordered chicken fingers...I know...he wasn't very hungry. They guy tried to tell him that was the children's menu. My boyfriend pointed it out on the menu to the waiter, that it was not on the children's menu. He walked away and came back saying it was OK, he could have the chicken fingers. They were just like a cheap box brand of frozen chicken nuggets. He said they were horrible and refused to eat them. They did take the 8.99 off the bill. Another thing that has changed is the entire menu and the prices for lunch and dinner are the same. They used to have mon-fri lunch menu. Not anymore. The prices are ridiculous. $13-$26 with the average price around $20. Used to be able to get a nice combination lunch for $8.99 to $9.99 average. I want to know if they did indeed change ownership. What I do know is I will never go back to eat there.",0ZSSxlUujHpr76ZrcDKE4g,1,0,2,H1nWaVVSLBXDz87gVg7Vqg

Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say ""I'm an undercover Mexican!"" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.",_8ept2EntUAeZguQHBENjQ,2,0,5,IULBx9UJcH6bKLyq7vHMiQ

Yeah. It's pretty good. 

The standard chips and salsa with each order also come with a bean dip that's pretty good. And actually by the time my food came I was already pretty full from it! On the second visit we ordered the chorizo and cheese appetizer. I was expecting a queso fundifo-type deal, but it was literally partially-melted cheese with some crumbled chorizo and sliced (stewed) jalapenos on top. Quite disappointing, really. Their margaritas are good, and not too sweet.

I got the two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans the first time we went. Their tortillas, both corn and flour, are handmade.

Let me repeat that. Their tortillas are handmade. If that's not reason enough to eat there, then I don't know what is.",l3ShcNqJyis2hQqH7LvehA,1,1,3,jW_CuUSFMVkwweE-C-X0QQ

4239058,2011-03-28,0,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"I've been to a ton of Mexican joints around town. Many times, I've discovered that it's hard to escape the generic expected tastes that they tend to offer. Casa Don Juan seems to escape that trend by incorporating fresh, homemade flavors that I was able to see and taste. 

Almost immediately after sitting, we were greeted with chips and salsa. Salsa was great, same with the bean dip. I ended up ordering a side of guacamole with the chips, because of the rave Yelps about it. And yes, I'll have to stand by those reviews, because I absolutely loved the guac.

Entrees did not absolutely blow my mind, but they were still very good. The chicken entrees seem to be a bit lackluster, but the beef dishes seem to be more memorable:

-Bistec de pollo: a very basic grilled chicken breast dish. I would avoid. Almost seems like something I could make at home
-Carne Asada taco: delicious, juicy and flavorful pieces of meat. The homemade tortilla goes with this very well. I was a little surprised that nothing else came with the taco. It was just a tortilla filled with meat, with a side of lemon. The carne asada didn't joke around. One bite was both juicy and flavorful. My next visit is going to have to focus on this.
-Chicken mole: much better tasting chicken than the bistec de pollo. I'm thinking it's the sauce that saved it.

To end it all, we finished it off with fried ice cream (see picture). Here it's served a little different than I'm used to. Instead of a simple corn flake coating, they add Fruity Pebbles as well. If you're not a fan of the Fruity Pebble taste, maybe you should avoid this. I personally loved it.
----
All in all, the tortillas and guacamole were some of the best that I've had in Vegas. Friendly service and lively atmosphere were also a plus. Chicken entrees come off a little weak, but the carne asada is sure to impress. If you see me back here, my table will be dedicated exclusively to the cow and whatever it has to offer.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,0,0,4,D72S56bRSHJKfjW1A6Rr0Q

My friends and I went for a breakfast as we have done several times before. We all ordered Michelada's they charged us ala cart for each one. Two of them were $11.50 which used Tecate beer and the other was $9.00 because it was made with bud light. That was the first strike.  We were never told they were ala cart. 

Two of us ordered the Chilaquiles. I asked to have chorizo added and the server said ""no problem"".  The server then asked my friend if he wanted carne asada, he said no and asked for Carnitas. Again, his reply was no problem. 

Food arrived, my eggs were under cooked so I sent them back. No problem. The food was just ok. Nothing like it usually is. 

When the bill arrived we were shocked to see that the Michelada's were charged for each component of the drink. We were also charged an additional $10.99 each for the additional meat added to the Chiliquiles. The price on the menu was $10.99 for them so we questioned why were were charged $20.99 for an $11.00 dish. The response was due to adding meat to the dish. We asked how much is a side of either chorizo and or carnitas and they said $5.00.  So we asked why were charged double. They had no good reason. I asked the server why he never mentioned the ridiculous up charges and he said it wasn't his fault. Oh yes it was. It's his responsibility of a server to mention any up charge. He should have mentioned it when taking the order. Had I known it was so much we wouldn't have ordered it. 

I have no problem paying for additional meat but to double the price of the dish and have no good reason was absurd. We asked for a manager and the hostess quickly replied he wasn't there. I find that hard to believe that you have a functioning restaurant with no manager in the building. 

They made no attempt to clearly explain the double charge instead of the quoted $5.00. They made no attempt to help rectify the bill. We agreed to pay for the meat but not double. They didn't care.  

We will never go there again or recommend this place.

So me and the hubby were headed to a different (read: much further away) Yelp-recommended Mexican joint for some authentic south-of-the-border grub while we were in Vegas for the weekend. Then our casino taxi stand man recommended instead to head to Casa Don Juan and that he's sent many people through the years and they were never disappointed.  To continue with my rule of always trust the locals for great food, off we went!

The décor in this place is awesome - I don't know much about Don Juan, but clearly he was in love with Frida, cuz the walls are basically a tribute to her from an obsessed fan.  Super cool, authentic Mexican décor.

Every time we're in the states we try to get some great Mexican food because (Sorry Canada!) at home it's pretty terrible stuff.This place has an extensive menu, tons of variety, and all reasonably priced.  They have tons of combos to choose from, but they are also flexible if you want something different.
But first, one of the best features is the wicked salsa you get with the free chips.  It was so flavorful I couldn't stop eating! It wasn't spicy at all, but to some people that's preferred, and it's super easy to eat.  They also served a side of refried beans for dipping too, which was unique.
I ordered a chile relleno and chicken enchilada combo and it was fab. A bit too much cheese inside the relleno (I know - too much cheese? as if there's such a thing! But there was seriously ALOT), but overall a very enjoyable meal.  My husband had a taco, relleno and tamale combo, and as far as I could tell, the tamale was the star.  The huge chunks of flavorful, tender pork were impressive!

Another star here was my mango daiquiri (I'm too much of wimp for tequila).  I think I can safely say that it's the best one I've ever had.  So fruity, smooth, and didn't tasty boozy (but you knew there was a healthy serving of rum in there!).

The service was also impeccable.  Attentive, polite, accommodating, friendly, and really made you feel taken care of.  

So, overall - fantastic!  If you're staying near Freemont and want Mexican, check it out!",cvS8Y8lIgmxZ9sopXzYZdA,0,0,5,L8UZUbkhF_atwpdj6epJEw
4380473,2012-07-18,1,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"First of all, as you can tell by my pic, I'm a latina, mexican to be exact, so when it comes to mexican food, no one beats grandma or mom's cooking.  I've yet to find AMAZING mexican food in Las Vegas which is pretty damn disappointing.  Casa Don Juan is near my downtown office so I've been several times.  Here's a little rundown as I've tried several things on the menu-

Chips and Salsa- the colorful dressed waitstaff bring out chips and salsa with black beans which is pretty awesome. Bonus points for the black beans fo sho!   Add a margarita on the rocks (with salt of course, hey, I said I was mexican. lol) and BAM!  You have one of my favorite snacks/appetizers.

Guacamole- I'm suuuper picky with my guacamole and pride myself on making the best.  Meh.  Enough said.

Caldo- for you gringos, that means soup.  Probably my favorite thing at Casa.  Served with homemade tortillas. Its pretty amazeballs!!!  Damn I wish I had some for breakfast right now. Big bowl with veggies, beef, and spice filled broth that is out of this world!  Most people sprinkle the top with fresh onions, cilantro, and lime. I hold the onions, but wow, definitely a tasty filling meal!

Tacos- unlike that disgusting place down the road Macayos, Casa's taco shells are homemade.  Filled with shredded chicken (or beef), lettuce and tomato...BOMB.

Enchiladas- pretty gross.  the sauce is runny and just doesn't have a good taste.  Actually their enchiladas get a big fat ""D-.""  The only thing worse than Casa's enchiladas are when people make enchiladas with FLOUR tortillas instead of corn.  WHAAAAT??  Fail.

Chile Relleno- ugh, I hate when a place messes up a chile relleno. Its pretty filling, cheese is just right, but the awful sauce they suffocate that poor chile with is pure caca. See my above review on enchiladas.

Rice and beans- pretty impressive!  I'm probably the most picky when it comes to these two sides and I have to say, they're almost perfect.

Margaritas- awesome!  They get an extra star for their tasty drinks.  The only time I crave a margarita is with my chips and salsa, but these are done RIGHT. I also request a better tequila because tequila makes me SUPER feisty! I Know my limits. lol.

Service- always very fast and not to toot my own horn but the owner likes a pretty lady so yeah, I always get seated very fast.  Just saying because its so obvious! lol.  

Prices- they've upped their prices over the last few years, so their specials are the way to go if you're trying to keep the cost down.  For good mexican I'll pay more, just not sure if this place is completely worth it.  

Overall Casa Don Juan is decent.  I'm always up for suggestions on great mexican food.  I want AUTHENTIC.  No more messing around for this little mexi.",M9jjjTEi5-4J_TTcbGPXaQ,3,3,3,ORVQTvliF8rhY84tmXlx9A

My advise is get al carte, that way you can try a few things.  I got a tamale and it was amazing! So if you try anything then get the tamale, they make them onsite. I also got a fish taco and it was good. Awesome and strong margartias!

4451457,2013-06-14,1,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"Casa don Juan and I have had an up and down relationship in the past. The first time I came here I loved it, second time I was disappointed. It's been about two years (honest to goodness, really TWO YEARS?! time flies.) that I've been back.

After checking out the new bar down the street (which I will review later) my friend and I were having drunk hunger pains. I was in the mood for Mexican and was contemplating El Gordo, but since Casa don Juan was in perfect walking distance we decided to dine-in here once again.

Let's begin with pricing - I think theirs stinks big time. Look, most Mexican places in Vegas are traditionally not hard on your wallet. You can usually get a combo plate in the 10 buck range (including taxes) as long as you aren't ordering carne asada or shrimp. But not at CJ's. Dinner menu boasts prices of $11.99+ and even appetizers prices are flagrantly high, especially considering the location of this place. Look, I'm not a cheapskate, nor do I think businesses should not make money, but the bottom line is I can go to numerous other Mexican restaurants and have just as good food for about 5 dollars less.

Food - Chips were brought out cold. Bean dip was decent and warm. Salsa at least has a spice-kick to it, so it's not totally bland.

Ordered - The ""Casa don Juan"" style wet burrito with chicken. The burrito is a decent size, comes with guac on top and the ""wet"" sauce. As for inside, you get beans, lettuce, meat, pico de gallo, rice, and lettuce. To me, the lettuce was gross, wet and mushy. The beans were eh same goes for the rice. The chicken was not seasoned very well - just plain 'ol shredded chicken. Overall the burrito was filling for my drunk tummy and that's all she wrote.

So. The deal is I would really love to at least LIKE Casa don Juan, but they just ain't cutting it. They need to make the food better and keep the prices, or they need to lower their menu prices and keep the same mediocre food. As with many places downtown I think Casa don Juan is going through growing pains and adapting to the new popularity that a decent downtown experience has to offer. I hope they find a happy medium, and I may try them again in the future. We shall see.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,6,0,2,ZHi6B5Ey0XjJegl_FHzG7g

I've been to the one on Buffalo and really liked the atmosphere, food, and service.  Here, not so much.  But we were downtown, which doesn't happen often, with a Groupon that had expired, but still worth something, so we went.  And even though it was a Saturday night, the place was nearly empty, so there was plenty of space in the parking lot.

The restaurant was freezing, so much so that my husband was visibly shaking from the cold.  No matter which table we tried, it was the same.  And active ceiling fans only made it worse.  Luckily, I had a sweatshirt in the car, but he was SOL. Even though the manager grudgingly turned down the thermostat, it didn't help much.  It's hard to enjoy the best meal when you're colder than a cadaver with rigor mortis.

But this wasn't the best meal.  Herb had Chicken in Mole, which was a pretty small portion, and I ordered Chilaquiles.  I don't think any two restaurants, or even two Mexican madres, make it the same way, but this was simply ordinary.  I ordered the green sauce, because the waiter said it was spicier than the red, but it turned out to be 2 or 3 out of 10, and I don't like overly spicy food.  Also, it was just about the most expensive item on the menu, and I can't figure out why.  A little chicken, a lot of fried tortilla chips, some sauce, no leftovers.  And I'm not a big eater.

There was nothing welcoming about the service, either from the front or from our waiter, who wasn't terribly friendly and seemed to be perpetually annoyed, even though we demanded nothing.  

I read that they're going to be doubling the size.  I wish them well.  They won't be doing it for us. There are too many other Mexican joints in town that are much, much better.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,12,6,2,6ZmjdLf2FFSGXXjMBChlpA

I started off by ordering a lemonade.  I thought it was going to be lemonade from a fountain dispenser but it was freshly squeezed! It was a foamy lemon/lime concoction. It was delicious but no free refills so I settled on one. I also saw people drinking out of a pineapple. It looked refreshing but I didn't know what it was. 

I had the beef flautas which to me is like a rolled taco. It came with rice and beans. I forgot to tell them to hold the beans. It was good but my brother ordered the carne asada torta which tasted better. I told him he can have some of my flautas if he gave me some of his torta. The bread looked home made because the top looked bubbly. It isn't flat like the ones you would get at Robertos. My husband must have loved the Carne asada burrito because he was finished so fast!

The location is great for me, so we thought we would stop on the way to Fremont to check it out. Glad we did.  Although the lady at the front was kinda rude, she was the only one the rest of the night that was.  Everyone from the hostess, to the many waiters checking on us, were all super friendly and accommodating.

We got chips, salsa, and beans when we first sat down. The salsa was not the best I ever had, but it was good and I loved that it was actually spicy. Then we ordered cheese dip and guacamole to go with it. The cheese was good, and the guacamole was delicious. However, this was a mistake, because when we were into our second basket of chips, we realized we were too full for our meal. 
We had ordered the mixed appetizer for two, which was $20. Surprisingly everything on the plate was good. It had chicken chimichangas, beef flautas, carne asada nachos and quesadillas.

I've went a couple times around 2pm and loved it.  If you're looking for mariachis, then bring an iPod.  If you want Roberto's style quick food, then go to Robertos.  This place has decently priced beers and food.  I'm a fan of kicking back a couple Modelo's with some chips, salsa, and cocktail de camarones.  But then again, if you're in a lunch rush, I don't think two or three beers is what you should be after.

Everything about the restaurant was pretty unappetizing... The condiments on the table consisted of chips, a watery substance that I think was supposed to be salsa, and a grey paste that I think was supposed to be bean dip. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, thinking that would be safe enough, however it tasted pretty bad and I only ate about 4 bites of it.

However, 4 bites turned out to be enough to cause the worst food poisoning I've ever had, which kicked up around midnight that night and lasted until noon the next day.  I spoke to the other person in our party who had ordered the same thing as me, and sure enough, she had gotten sick too.

The service was just awful! 

It started with 20 minutes for a drink order. Our server brought the wrong margarita. We ordered mango and they brought strawberry. The owner came over and told us off saying we ordered the wrong margarita and it was our error. She stood there scolding us saying we ordered strawberry when clearly we did not. They re-make the margarita and bring it and it's still the wrong one - a regular instead of mango (but at that point who cared). Our server forgot to order someones food and when we asked he said we never ordered it (even though we did and he repeated it back to us). The server then brought the wrong food for another person. 

When we spoke to the owner afterwards (again), she was just as rude (if not worse) and then said FINE I'll give you a 10% off coupon. We told her, we don't want a coupon we're just giving you feedback. We're not complaining for a coupon or discount. She raised her voice, started walking away, rolling her eyes and said it was all our fault. Granted, we're not a group of rocket scientists but being college educated adults I think we know how to order a meal. She was a real witch.

It is close to my work and co-workers and I go there regularly, but yesterday my experience was disappointing.  I had a Groupon and went there with a couple co-workers. I ordered a Vegetarian Burrito.  I have ordered this burrito many times and have always enjoyed it.  To make it a little more substantial, I asked if I could add chicken to the burrito. The server said that it would be an extra charge, which I completely understood.  The burrito already has rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and pico, so of course charging for chicken is understandable. When we received the bill, they had charged $7.99 for chicken! That is more than the burrito itself (Vegetarian Burrito is $5.99)!  Another co-worker of mine ordered a chicken burrito wet, and it was $7.99.  She wanted sour cream so they charged extra for it.  That is understandable, but charging $5.99 for the vegetarian burrito and then $7.99 for chicken to be added is ridiculous!  I asked the server what the $7.99 was for and she told me it was for the chicken, and ""I told you that would be an extra charge.""  I told her I understand that, but $7.99 on top of the $5.99 for the burrito was not reasonable. I then asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and I explained the situation to him.  He responded, ""She told you there would be an extra charge for the chicken."" I told him I understood that, but $7.99 seems a little unreasonable and if you are going to charge that much you should tell your customers because I am sure no one would pay that.  You could order a whole other burrito for that price! He said that it was rude to tell people the price because it appears that you are implying that they can't afford the $7.99. I told him it was rude and dishonest to NOT tell your customers you were charging them $7.99 for a piece of chicken. He finally stated that he couldn't do anything, that they charged what the owner makes them charge, and ""it is what it is.""  I was so appalled by their attitudes and lack of customer service. They didn't even try to fix the situation.  Like I said, I do not work far from there, and many of my co-workers go there because we enjoy the food and usually good customer service, but this was unacceptable.  I have told other co-workers and friends about our experience yesterday and they couldn't believe it.  They all thought it was unreasonable and dishonest and were very disappointed. I don't want to say that we will never go back, but it definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back anytime soon.",1yOgfqVcZelUiLnMC22fDQ,2,0,1,z-goxlcShPDzLMBv27kqIg

I ended up giving Casa Don Juan a try for lunch. And to be honest while it's been less than 2 weeks since I was there I remember these things..which are not good. 

Flat iced tea. Very slow service. A very long wait for my check and my debit card to be returned. I do remember trying to enjoy a beef taco but it was too greasy to finish. I remember flavorless chips and...well they call it salsa but I thought perhaps someone confused the salsa bucket in the back with a water jug and they decided to fill it with tap water before realizing their mistake. It was red...it had cilantro and other stuff in it, but it was not anything I'd want to eat again. 

I'm really struggling to find something positive to say about this place...and I just can't. I wave my white flag of surrender...I ended up not eating the cheese enchilada! I've never left a cheese enchilada on my plate before. How in the heck can someone mess up a cheese enchilada and leave it flavorless is beyond me but they found a way to do it.

I thought our service was great from the time we walked in to the time we left. Everyone was happy, friendly, and helpful. This goes a long way for me even if the food isn't that great. I would even go as far to say that the service is what kept this place from getting a two-star rating from me. 

Unfortunately, the food wasn't good enough in my book to make a return visit. The food was generally underseasoned and un-inspiring. This is very standard Mexican fare and nothing outside the box. Maybe it is what it is, but this place is a cliche of a place with excellent service..",Tx9YmzkGh2F-VT_c_Xcm2w,0,0,3,i4ls8Sb2YzvzQK4ooM2hfQ

I didn't want to send it back never had to do it before.

As usual, she replies ""none"", you have to make them from home, but she did mention a few places and since Don Juan was pretty closed off of 515 that I was on, I decided to come here.  

It was reassuring when half of the parking lot was filled with Nissans.  Mexican folks seem to love Nissans.  The interior was strangely filled with Frida Kahlo stuff.  I was somewhat uncomfortable being surrounded by unibrow paintings but I got used to it.  

Chips with salsa/bean dip, tostadas with ceviche, carne asada burrito plate.  

The burrito was FULL of carne asada, unlike stuff you get at typical chain places where you find a few pieces of meat among a LOT of rice and beans.  It was the opposite and VERY filling.  Ceviche was good, but I'm more used to central American type of ceviche where there are big chunks of fish, but all of the fish ceviches I've had at Mexican places seem to have small, flaky sort of fish, but it was good in a different way.  

Depsite my running 8+ miles and having an enormous appetite, I did not have space left for tamales that were ordered so I had to take them home.

If you travel to Vegas and have a car (wouldn't really recommend a taxi ride, but hey, to each his own), you need to come to Casa Don Juan!

Since there isn't a single place on the strip that offers authentic mexican at a decent price, my family and I always head over here at least once during our Vegas stay. Although slightly overpriced (it IS still Vegas), you can get a very decent sized meal for $15-$20. 

I always judge a mexican restaurants' credibility off of ONE FACTOR - their RICE! Most mexican joints have either rice that's too dry/wet or too bland. The rice at Casa Don Juan had that perfect blend of spices and was just the right consistency. I purposefully saved it until the end so that I could end my meal with a bang!

The food itself is pretty good in general. They have all the regulars like combination plates and specialties, but they also have tamales everyday (which is not very common). They're pretty good as well and offer about 5-6 varieties.",pf7pB-UbvKT-AWfQcg6kBg,2,0,4,4m-B5iJxWAuDyRkn5q1eTA

Service was a dud this time, with our one waiter and one busboy running all around town.  It took forever to get our order in, to get plates, to get our check, to pay for the bill, etc.  Service was just lacking altogether.  By the time we did get our plates (which we had requested early on), our food was not hot.  Reminders about more chips, beans, and salsa were forgotten.

Food was still good though!  Chips with warm refried beans and cheese and hot salsa are always a joy to munch on here.  Our party of three ordered a few dishes to share.

* Carnitas de Puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo ($8.99) - Generous amount of shredded pork.  More than enough for one person.  And it was moist and tasty, not dry at all.

* 3 Enchiladas de Pollo con arroz y frijoles ($9.99) - It was good, not my favorite of the bunch. I spent more time eating everything else.  We chose the chicken for all three, although you can get beef or cheese as well.

* Carne Asada (estilo Casa Don Juan) con arroz, frijoles y guacamole ($10.99) - A decent size piece of steak covered with onions.  It took forever to cut with the butter knife they give.  They either have to cut it in strips or give you a steak knife so you can cut into it better.

We also ordered three micheladas.  But the waiter said it's called something else when there's hot sauce in it.  I forgot.  Oh well.  But it was pretty good nonetheless.

There was a slight discrepancy with the bill where they charged us for another beer.  It's always a pain to find things added on your bill and having to get them to fix it.  So double check your bill when dining here.

Overall, it's still a great place for Mexican food with great atmosphere.  Wonderful people watching when sitting outside, but it always seems lively when I pop in to use the loo.  (Not sure how the atmosphere outside would be should it not be First Friday.)

3.5 stars.

I'm far from an expert on the finer points of authentic Mexican cuisine, so I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach.  Casa Don Juan had all of the familiar earmarks of a family-run operation.  The dining room was cozy, clean, and colorful, albeit a bit gaudy replete with Mexican tchotkes and neon cerveza signs.  Service was fast and familiar as the complimentary chips and sauce were delivered promptly to our table.  We added an order of guacamole for our chips.  The guac was smooth and fresh, good, but fairly standard fare.  It may have been a bit more enjoyable if it had been made fresh tableside.  No worries, though, because my order of Menudo (available only on Sat. & Sun) was exactly what the doctor ordered.  The generous amount of tender beef tripe was swimming in a delicious chile infused broth.  The dish was fortified with hominy and accompanied by a plate of chopped cilantro, lime, onions, black pepper, and oregano add-ins.  It was hearty and flavorful and a big winner in my mind.  While there likely are whole list of Mexican restaurants that the locals know of that are superior to Casa Don Juan, the wife and I found it to be satisfying and a solid value.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,1,0,4,5TpkYGEK1yUphNhbbnzK8A

On this day, we decided to have an event at the Plaza hotel bingo hall, which turned out to be a flop. Although no one won that day, we sure did build up an appetite. The choices were Thai or Mexican. Mexican won, so our boss told us about this family owned local joint down the road from the Plaza. I'm always up for the opportunity to Yelp a new restaurant, this was no different.

Driving down Main St, you'll see the restaurant on the right hand side, adorn with exposed rock walls. There's a small parking lot in the back or street parking, but get there early so you can secure a spot. When you walk in, the website says you're treated to ""home-like Mexican setting."" It's more like a Mexican Quinceañera threw up! The walls are a bright canary yellow, the ceiling is lined with hanging colored paper, cut with different designs. Definitely looks like an outdated joint but somehow, that's their character and it seems to work. Our server was passable. Didn't really converse with us and we ended up waiting  a long time for out check at the end. Thank goodness I was surrounded with great company!

For dinner, I decided to get the number 10 on the dinner menu, Carnitas de puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo for $11.99. This dish is pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo. For some reason, Mexican prepared pork is always a winner in my book. This pork was nicely prepared, shredded and nicely marbleized. The meat was tender, however, drowned in oil. The saving grace was definitely the mild, yet flavorful taste. The rice was a nice dry compliment to the dish and help to soak up the juices from the pork. I thought the pico brought a fresh taste to the dish and who doesn't love guac! Overall, this dish was great.

At the end of the day, I would say I'm more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars for this place.I appreciate it's history and character, however, I feel like some things could be updated. Aside from the mediocre service, I would say the rest of the evening was a delightful one. I'm glad that it's close to work. For that alone, I wouldn't mind coming back again for another crack at it!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,0,3,fpRe1VxQP8uEkgDY5ZULmw

Food was fast, but blah and then we had to wait 30 minutes for our check. Finally, after paying at the register I was waiting for my partner to go to the bathroom and our waiter came up to see how much he got tipped.

5118244,2018-02-22,1,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"We found this restaurant by looking on Groupon for dinner deals in Vegas. The Groupon being offered was for 2 dinner entrees (up to $12.99) and 2 jumbo margaritas for $27 (a $46 value). Ideally, we wouldn't have purchased a Groupon for a place so far from where we were staying on the strip, but it was a pretty good deal and decided to give it a try. As we were driving to this restaurant, our Lyft driver was surprised that we wanted to go to a place so far off the strip but reassured us that it was authentic Mexican food. We had high hopes and expectations for this place. 

First negative of this dining experience was the location. Not only was a 15 minute Lyft ride but they were doing construction all around the restaurant, so the drop off/pick up is really inconvenient. 

Once we got inside the restaurant, the friendly hostess seated us and offered us guacamole or bean dip to start instead of the complementary salsa, but we decided to go with the salsa. Our short interaction with her was the end of the positive customer service we received during the rest of our time at this restaurant. 

Our waiter, whose name I don't recall, came to take our drink order and was friendly to begin with. Once I mentioned that we would be using a Groupon, his whole tone and body language towards us changed immediately. He said, with an attitude, we could only get the house flavor margarita or we had to pay an additional cost for a flavor upgrade. We said that was fine, and we had no problem paying the $1.50 difference for a strawberry instead of lime flavor. He then proceeded to whip open the menus for us and directed us to the two pages of dinner entrees we were allowed to pick from. I was highly disappointed in their lack of vegetarian options, but was not about ask if I could sub veggies instead of the chicken, beef, pork, etc. due to our waiter's poor attitude. I decided on fish tacos and my boyfriend chose one of their burritos. 

The restaurant was not too busy when we came in but by the time we placed our order, our waiter had a couple tables in addition to ours. Our food took an average amount of time to be prepared. 

After our food was brought out, that was the last time anyone checked on us throughout our meal. The food came out hot, and was very tasty and fresh. By the time our meals came, my boyfriend and I were over half way done with our margaritas and waters, and figured our waiter would be over to offer us another round of drinks. We spent 20 minutes enjoying our meal and in that time frame, our waiter did not once come to check on our drinks, how our food was, etc. After we finished eating, we sat at our table for close to 15 mins waiting for the bill while our waiter completely ignored us. While I realize he had a couple other tables, I've have never had an experience with a waiter/waitress who couldn't juggle 4 tables. There were multiple times he looked over at us and I made eye contact with him to signal that we were ready to cash out, yet he turned his back to us each time. At one point, I was going to ask the hostess to print our bill off so we could get out of there. He must have sensed that we were growing increasingly impatient and finally came to our table and said ""is everything okay?"" in a snippy tone. At this point, we were very disappointed. Our original plan was to order another drink before we left, but based off of how we were treated, we told him to bring the bill. 

After our waiter applied the Groupon, all we were left to pay was the taxes and up charge on the margarita flavor, which came out to be around $9. I know that when using Groupons/coupons, the correct thing to do is to tip on the original price, not the discounted price. This experience, however, made me so upset that I was VERY tempted to tip on the $9 that we owed. However, being the decent human beings we are, we tipped him on what the meal should've cost without the Groupon. 

Maybe our waiter was having an off day, but I don't believe this was the case. He probably thought we were going to short him out of a decent tip as we were using a Groupon. If he did not want to take care of a table with a Groupon, he should've asked another waiter to take care of us. Instead, we were treated like garbage. We will not be back to this place when we visit vegas again.",qVTg30bOMywB8YeiQhk-og,3,0,2,jASGlC4IiDt7b7kv7Ou3Fw

Started off with chips and salsa, beans and guacamole. Chips were good, not greasy as was the beans. The salsa and guacamole tasted canned but were still decent. 

We bought a selection of soups, cocktails, tacos and ceviche. 

The soup was deliciously flavored, well spiced. The cocktail was served in a large soup bowl and was equally as good. It was a sea food cocktail. The taco's just disappeared, with fresh tilapia fillet. Ceviche was mixed with fish, shrimp and octopus on q huge plate. I struggled to eat it all, it was so good I couldn't help it.

From the outside, it often looks as if it is glowing. As you know, I love an atmosphere that makes a statement, and I can definitely appreciate festive.

I went for dinner with a group after a talk at the Historic 5th Street School. It is an adorable little place with bright walls, tiled floors and lots of wall flare. Although we arrived only an hour before they were closing, the servers were welcoming. There were only a couple of other tables of diners.

The server brings salsa, bean dip and chips to the table. I would say that all were average. My friends had eaten at Don Juan before, and one ordered the chile relleno based on his previous experience. My other friend ordered two tacos, and I ordered a plate with one taco and one tamale. 

Perhaps I ordered poorly because the taco was solid, but the tamale was sad. Sad tamales are really sad. It was a weird diameter--I know that is an odd comment, but it was like a toilet paper roll, but a little shorter. I like a flatter tamale because it prevents them from drying out. Don Juan's tamale was very dry, and there was a lot of dough, not too much filling. Plus, it was lukewarm at best. I guess most of this could have been the result of it being a late in the day tamale. However, even early in the day it would have still been the same diameter with the same fillings, so, naaaah, I think it was simply a sad, little tamale. Hence, my sad little two stars.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,7,2,2,BCYzMjvCaP2xRGlX-Sesqg

My friend sitting across me literally waited for about 20 minutes for her beer and we had to remind them. The whole time we were confused as to who our server / busser was, there was like 4 different people servicing our table.  

The piña colada looked pretty cool as it is served literally in a pineapple. I ordered the pescado frito 'fried fish' and it was good.

We told the server right away and he seemed annoyed.  We ordered margaritas and was told it was only the house lime; no flavors were included as those were extra.  When we got our margaritas, my friend had a black bug in hers.  We flagged down our waiter and he didn't apologize or anything. He just said ""Oh. I can get you another one.""  Our food came out which was good, but the server never came to see how our dinner was, the bus boy did though who was very nice.  After we finished, the server came over to bring us our check and we have him our groupon.  When he brought it back, the groupon didn't cover all of it and we had only ordered exactly what was on the groupon.  The check indicated that only $45.97 was applied.  We checked the groupon fine print to make sure that there wasn't a maximum dollar value that we missed and there wasn't.  We asked the server why there was still a $12 balance and he couldn't give us an answer.  So we took it up to the front to the cashier and asked nicely to speak with the manager.  She said there was a maximum value on it but we asked where that was indicated.  She said it was in the fine print, but when we showed her the fine print, it was not there and she could not find it.  She didn't want to help us and felt annoyed that we were asking about it. Finally after her reading the fine print for another few minutes said ""oh well it should be in there"".  She didn't apologize at all and finally changed our bill to the correct amount where we just owed tax and tip.  She blamed it on groupon saying that the price in things have changed and that groupon didn't reflect that.

       - Service - The service was great. The waiter was took the initiative and answered all questions we had about the menu.
       - Flavor - Perhaps it was what we ordered, but the food seemed mediocre.
**Ordered**
       - $12.99 Pescado (Veracruz style) - They deep fried a whole fish. It was definitely an experience. However, the fish seemed a bit bland (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=PJHl0-1lr3VutIljvJWAgg).
       - $13.99 Carne Asada con Arroz, Frijoles y Guacomole - The carne asada was decent but a little dry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=2jMekOanf6P9EuTiBzuh0Q).
       - $2.50 Lengua (Beef Tounge) Taco - The meat was good. The only complaint was it was really spicy. I had to stop half way to take a break (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=YThhtM8r_BRfN3L56wfKGQ).
       - $2.75 Flan Napolitano - Made from scratch flan. It was delicious.
**Recommendations**
       - Out of all the restaurant style Mexican places, I'd rank this one pretty high. However, I think I'll stick to fast food Tacos El Gordo next time I'm feeling like tacos.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,0,2,EsDe_Eg1dUkqoQrMQUJSjg

For starters, we got the cheese dip to go with their salsa and bean dip. This is the highlight of the whole meal. I would have been happy to order a few bowls of this and a side of guacamole as my entree. Instead, I got sampler plate. It consisted of a tamale, enchilada, and a taco. I did the pork in red sauce, chicken enchilada, and beef taco. The meat was dry on all three. At this point, I was full anyways.

The margaritas are good. A little more on the sweet side than I would like, but a squeeze of the lime wheel helps. They come in two sizes, regular and the large. You might as well do the fish bowl, because life is better with more alcohol.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,0,2,tFz7UlvVSyzMx2hGQl76hw

Super easy to find and the building has a fun, comfy atmosphere. There's not too much parking right near the restaurant, but plenty within walking distance.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and led to our table. The hostess immediately asked us if we wanted either cheese dip (which I've heard is amazing) or guacamole with our chips and salsa (including bean dip). Being that my friend and I don't respond well to dairy, we opted for the guac. The hostess informed us that it was extra, which we said was fine. Had I known it was almost $6 more, I think I would've said no... super yummy guac, but not worth an extra $6. My friend prefers her guac with more seasoning and additional ingredients, so she thought it was just ok. I love plain guac, so I thought it was delicious. The bean dip was just ok. But I've been spoiled by Leticia's (north side of town) AMAZING bean dip.

Our server was great and attentive. He recommended the piña colada and checked to see the ingredients for us. The piña colada was delicious and just a fun experience! Brought out in a pineapple instead of a glass! For my entrée, I had the one taco meal with carne asada meat. The taco meal was good, but not amazing. Came with beans and spanish rice.

Overall, fun experience and good (not amazing) food. I kind of left feeling like I could've gone to a Mexican fast food place near my house for more food and way cheaper.

Food was under-seasoned and salsa had no flavor. When we inquired if they had another salsa that was hot, we were charged $1.50 (don't mind the charge) for Habanero salsa that did not do anything except help us spice the rest of the food.
Burrito seemed to have little if any chicken.
Chicken fajita and Beef and shrimp fajita had no flavor.
Took the left overs home, threw in some more onions, salt and pepper. Used green salsa/sauce from another Mexican restaurant and that made it taste good.

Lunch can get crowded so we usually get in around 1130 and are seated right away. Get the guac!! It is a little extra but totally worth it. I have never had bad service here and they are very attentive and the food comes out pretty fast. Not fast like microwave, but within a good amount of time for the amount of people they have sitting in there.

Both times I've been I was highly disappointed. Ridiculous prices (nearly every entree is in the $13.99 - $18.99 range) for what amounts to a big scoop or rice and beans and some packaged nonsense.

First time I came here, I had a soup. This time I had the chicken mole platter with no beans ($13.99.)

I took one bite and could tell that this was prepackaged sauce poured on top of frozen, precut strips of chicken rib meat. 

I asked for more salsa and the waiter said ""okay"" but never brought any more out. 

I noticed the women at the next table were commenting on how the cheese was congealed on their food. I bet the food goes into a salamander partially frozen for that to happen.

This place needs to pare down their menu and prices and focus on preparing a smaller number of menu items exceptionally well. If they started preparing quality food, they wouldn't need a Groupon when they're already an established restaurant.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,5,2,r59O2W48FrehsDPiXTdBEw

Something local, affordable, fairly close.

He shoots off a couple of recommendations that all seem a little higher end (we were in shorts and jeans and didn't want to change).  He then thinks for a second and says...""I know this local Mexican place you might like..."" and that's how we found Casa Don Juan.  When I need a good place to eat...I always ask a bartender - never had a bad meal on a bartender recommendation.

As we left the comfy confines of the casino areas and found our way into a different part of the city I had a feeling I was going to be really happy with this meal (big fan of off the beaten track restaurants).  We got to the place and parked (not a ton of parking, but we were fine) and we were happily greeted by the hostess who seated us immediately and gave us menus.  We also ordered a couple of Tecates and some fresh guacamole which came out a few minutes later with chips, salsa and frijoles.  Usually not a Guac fan, but this was pretty good...we hammered it.  

I ordered the Super Burrito Asada with Chicken and red sauce with rice and beans and my co- worker ordered the Chimichanga with shredded beef and also with a side of beans and rice.  I don't know about you, but when my meal comes out and I know just by looking at it that I'm gonna have a tough time finishing it...I know I'm getting my money's worth.  This burrito was fabulous and was bursting with flavor...and when I walked out of the place I was stuffed...and I was still full in the morning - I skipped breakfast!  My co-worker also loved the chimichanga and said the shredded beef was perfect.

Everything about this place screamed to me that it deserved a second meal...unfortunately, I have NO idea when I will be back in Vegas.  Great service, great food, ice cold beer, and a really great eclectic Mexican décor.

Then I tried the beans, they looked weird..like thin yogurt.  YUCK. Tasted like they had been diluted with water and lard. I had two chicken tacos crispy with rice and beans and guy had salad with chicken.  We were so hungry (you know this feeling) that my guy and I ate the food as we b*tched about it.  I even asked for different beans..but then said forget it.  The ones with my dinner were the opposite end of wet...dry paste.  Oh, they started dumping trash/food into two large bins by food window..right out in front of us!  GROSS.  Then proceeded to stack chairs onto the tables..guess it as hint to clear out even tho we were still eating...should have taken as a 'sign' and stopped.
I came home and had to stop thinking of how bad the food was for fear of up-chuck.  Had to take Mylanta before I could sleep.

The food was really good and came to our table fast. I do like Mexican food, this is a place we will go back to again. We sat down rather quickly and they are quick to come to your table. Staff is very friendly and multiple people bring you chips/salsa, waters, etc. I would like to try the other locations as well but this location was very festive and great to visit and see. Also they have Groupons sometimes also to check out :) Will definitely return here again soon, as there are other foods to try.",KCD6daAp293FoOUoTjT_YA,1,1,4,cX0ct5C0BtuFlBUfK1Co-A

We waited a while for our order to be taken. We asked several times for water we never got. Our drinks ; mango margaritas and other drinks tasted awful like water no liquor whatsoever. Our food wasn't great at all it tasted like you something you buy at the market reheatable meals. Our waiter probably visited our table maybe twice in the two hours that we were there.  We should've just stopped at McDonald's it would've been way much better.

5800220,2013-04-08,3,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"I usually come here with a group of people and the service tends to be good.

I was in the area and decided to stop by with my wife and get a shrimp cocktail. As soon as we parked and where headed inside we noticed 3 separate bums one laid out in the parking lot one at the corner stop sign and one walking inside the establishment. I don't have anything against homeless people but these people are beyond homeless you can tell the druggies and simply strung out and  just loitering around the business. Not really a good feeling when leaving and parking your car in the ""additional parking"" which is located in the back of the restaurant.

As soon as we walked in we where greeted by a very Hispanic women wearing a.. what a call MARIA DRESS!!! The restaurant itself screams MEXICAN and so does the exceptional food they put out as we walked in to the right we noticed a lovely older lady which could have been one of my grandmothers making fresh tortillas and fresh tortilla chips the smell was awesome. The only down fall is that I noticed that the staff seemed more preoccupied talking amongst themselves then taking care of customers it felt as if we had to let them finish talking to each other before they would notice or talk to us. 

I knew what I wanted to I tried to quickly place my order but was told that I needed to wait for the waiter. The waiter arrived to take the order and my wife had a regular water I ordered a fresh mango water and the shrimp cocktail. The order was made very fast id say it took about a whole 3-4 minutes for the shrimp cocktail to come out as a matter a fact the shrimp cocktail came out before the water which baffled me. I even told the waiter the cocktail came out before the drink?? he quickly replied and said why yes because the mango water has to be freshly made.....so the shrimp cocktail I guess was waiting for me..... The waiter then left and proceeded to a different table. This made me a little upset so I waived him down and asked him kindly to please bring the regular water that is not taken out of the well so that we may have something to at least drink on. The waiter then came back with both the waters.

The shrimp cocktail here is amazing the shrimp are a medium sized shrimp and there are plenty of them WELL THERE BETTER BE AT 15.99 a cocktail. I think that the price is a little high but it is worth it. I have not found another shrimp cocktail to be this tasteful and this rich in flavor and this is the only reason I come here. 

The service was so subpar I refused to leave a tip. When I was paying it seemed like I was bothering the cashier to come check me out after I had already been waiting for 10 minutes at the table for them to come back with my credit card and check. The customer service here is not so great but the food well at least the shrimp cocktail is AWESOME!!!",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,5,3,2,Hjo6XsxiDewszF_Jyhafhg

My only complaint would be that the strawberry margarita, which I paid an extra $3 for (upgraded from the on-the-rocks lime margarita that came with the Groupon), was the most bland, watery margarita I've ever had. When I ordered it, the server warned me that the regular margarita was better. I should've listened to him, because boy was he right! I tried the regular margarita as well, and it was good. For some reason, the strawberry one tasted like ice with a hint of bland strawberry flavor. Couldn't taste any tequila at all! But the food was decent (great for the price). I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which is probably my favorite food of all time. They were good. For the price, I'd come back to order them again.",3yA5NjTKyImkZWQ5Qbmwjw,0,0,4,-H30vkypHDdPI8tRD-WQ7A

5837371,2011-11-11,1,a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg,"I had been urged to come here several times by friends, for whom this is their go-to place for a Mexican food fix.  Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.

In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  

The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.

I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    

The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  

Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.

The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!

Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,2,3,18-pMZyseUvVLbocLo0Jjg

First, if popularity is any indicator, this is a great restaurant.  It was packed on Sunday afternoon at 3 PM -- and that's in downtown.

The vibe is typical Mexican.  The waiters' costumes are pretty and authentic.  The service is friendly and efficient -- the waiters hustle.

The margaritas are great.   The guacamole is very good.  However, having such a good feeling about the place overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my food.  The chile relleno was not very flavorful.  The taco was OK at best.  Overall I'd say ""typical smashed bean and rich"" Mexican food -- not worse but not better than the average -- in a much better than average environment.

The menu is huge so hopefully the other dishes impress.  Overall, I like the place and would come back.  (But skip the chile relleno.)",fqCxaOI1cvnXx1OlHRUDPg,1,1,3,BtQk_v6vxvP82l02AsShew
