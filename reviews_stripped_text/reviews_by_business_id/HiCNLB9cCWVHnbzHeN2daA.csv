The service has always been very good as the owners are there every night and make sure everything is running smoothly. Good prices on beer and wine. The listing on this restaurant shows that it is closed, but it is certainly not! Just ate there tonight and it is alive and well.",heEhkOC6R1kayjC5Z9Pr-A,0,0,4,793z7hjY_gRiZxEnojLYJw
240871,2011-08-14,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"Best pizza in Vegas. Being a native Chicagoan, I know my pizza! Thin, crunchy crust with tasty sauce, flavorful cheese and real Italian style sausage with fennel. Just like home. Chicago style decor, casual and comfortable. Service is fine- not great, not bad. Most importantly, pizza was served piping hot. I don't know about the other food, cause the pizza is the only thing we go for!",to-2EIRXGkhV3dWcwnllig,0,1,5,IqenPS-dEE9tVnTDBOMGWA

1512334,2009-02-06,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"I was soooo disappointed :( I had high hopes for this place. I lived in Chicago for a few years and was happy to learn there was a Chicago style pizza place. Sadly, it does not compare to the pizza I would eat in Chicago. The sauce on the stuffed pizza tasted like it was just tomato sauce out of a can. There was absolutely NO seasoning in it. The spinach was fresh, but it wasn't completely covered by the sauce, so many of the pieces were dried out. The cheese was okay, but not great. The crust was pretty nondescript. I definitely won't get another stuffed pizza from here. If they use the same ""sauce"" on the thin pizzas I definitely won't get pizza from here again.",XrlYaTPoZTpi-iluryFNcg,0,2,1,vMmKFi-9wthA-_CfnUP3jg
1613786,2012-03-21,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"Aurelio's is a wonderful Chicago tradition and I am so happy they came to Las Vegas.

My husband and I have come to Las Vegas twice so far from Seattle, and have made it a point to visit Aurelio's for our pizza fix. It is 10x better than Papa Johns or any other random ""chain"" pizza place. 

My husband grew up in Chicago (that's about 18 years of his life that he ate authentic Aurelio's pizza) and not only does he think it's just as good here in Las Vegas, but he's turned me into an Aurelio's addict also. Their ingredients are fresh and perfect! 

I also have no idea why people come to a pizza place and complain about other things on the menu. The pizza is what Aurelio's is known for, so at least rate that, and give it a chance. 

By the way, in Chicago they often cut their pizza into squares. It doesn't change the taste of the pizza, and it isn't just for kindergardeners.",aijOJzlIFg6ET8ZLwzz_gQ,1,0,5,yO2A3m8XUaD5ROKLs6W7BQ
2407564,2011-07-17,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"We went back to Aurelio's a few nights ago with my parents. This time I had spaghetti and meatballs. It was okay but the meatballs were a little overdone (i.e., bordering on burnt). My wife had the spinach calabrese which is similar to a calzone. It was pretty good. My parents split a pizza. I tried a couple of small pieces, and it was fine, but again not the best I've ever had.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,0,0,3,JPaNYwfUCzR6BSqS0au2UA

The thin crust is good, and the ingredients are fresh, and the pizza is cut interestingly...but in the end...it is not special at all.  It is also a little overpriced for what it is...average pizza...maybe slightly above average...but not enough to warrant 4 stars.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,1,2,3,UYtinP-pCMqL_z3JgjnJWA
3503816,2007-07-19,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"I freaking love this pizza!!!  I personally like thin crust pizza because I don't feel like I have a gut full of dough after eating one piece.

3618394,2010-08-09,1,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"This is some of the worst food I've had in a very long time. The salad on the salad bar was wilted and the pasta salad smelled terrible. The pizza was dry and tasteless with thin crust, hardly any toppings, and cut up into about 30 squares as if it were about to be served to a group of kindergarteners. The tortellini was gluey and dry. We also ordered wings which weren't half bad, but considering how rude the hostess was (you'll know her by the ten pounds of makeup she is wearing), I won't be coming back.",bJIcFnrRDKfsdjEtctglbw,2,1,1,dx1AoMZtb6K5MIxMq52_2A

It is a Chicago thin crust spot.  Despite what you think of Chicago Style Pizza it is very good.   It's like New York but squared.  To tell you the truth they have plenty of promotions to match there pie's.

We came to Vegas from NW Indiana and used to drive over 1.5 hours to the nearest Aurelio's. How excited were we when we just stumbled onto a VEGAS location. We couldn't believe it. Story is, one of their customers liked it so much they talked the company into letting him open one here.

I paid like $11 for the all you can eat, plus a soda, and a tip for the guy. Really not worth it, friends. 

The pizza was super thin crust, the toppings were sparse, and it wasn't too hot. It was actually kinda cold considering how ""fresh"" the guy claimed it was. Plus the salad wasn't the best. Also, it took the guy forever to refill my drink. He spent the majority of his time chatting with some guys there whom he apparently knew. 

The worst part is that once I sat down and started eating, I kept on thinking ""man, there's a Subway like three feet away. I'd much rather be eating a hot sub...""",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,0,0,2,l0a4bOcElIEWLqvLahMjrA

However, I brought my husband here and the owner hardly acknowledged us at the door and told us to ""Give him a minute."" There was one table occupied in the restaurant and we stood there with no acknowledgement for at least 5 minutes. We have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant and if it were busy, I would understand. We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out. The owner said he didn't know. After being ignored for a few more minutes, we left and will not return. I will not be treated like an inconvenience for average pizza.",IjFbUcclt2EiisphcW7bpw,0,0,1,i3-PK8brUUcBHTxWIKNdQw
4921356,2011-12-03,0,HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA,"All I ask for in a Chicago style thin crust is a crunchy crust, melted cheese and a great sauce.  If the toppings are of great quality it just makes it that much better.  I asked a guy I met at a gas station in a Chicago Bears ensemble with Bears and Cubs stickers all over his car if he knew of a good Chicago style pizza place here in Vegas.  He turned me on to this place, if I ever see him again I'm going to kick him in the baby maker and take 30 bucks out of his wallet.   I worked in Chicago for a year and definitely tried all the big names Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Geno's East and many mom and pop places... First of all I had it delivered so I can't comment on the restaurant itself.  When I called the gentleman was nice and informative of his product however told me I was out of his delivery area by a mile.  He did say that he would do it this one time to get me hooked and that they were really slow anyway.  I now know why they were so slow...  Food sucked!  I got a large pepperoni and meatball for my buddies and I, on the phone he said 30-40 minutes for delivery time, it took over 60.  Once it arrived I noticed the delivery driver was holding the container at an angle and thought maybe the handle was crooked or something.  OH NO!!! He was holding my pizza at an angle because when I opened the greasy bottomed box the pizza was actually so discombobulated I had to pull slices off of each other.  The pizza was so cold that it was like trying to pull a grilled cheese apart.  The meats were burnt and the meatballs were just chunks of beef, not little balls or thinly sliced actual meatballs.  The sauce was flavorless and the only taste that truly resonated throughout was the burnt cornmeal that they used to keep the dough from sticking to the oven.  If you want good pizza; stay far, far away from this place.",xHhJ7w9DQ7TY_0fU0HgKng,1,0,1,5Ta5hxWsJx7PezV1z9IuHg
