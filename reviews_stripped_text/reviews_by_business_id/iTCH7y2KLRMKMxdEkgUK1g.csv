I searched through yelp and wouldn't you know it this placed popped up and OMG. . .I love me some food trucks!  yes I do!  =)  So of course I had to try it.  =)

I have never had Venezuelan food before and really didn't know what to expect but I knew that I wanted to get the cachapa and the tequenos from the pics.

Ok First, when you get your food. . .ask for EXTRA sauce. . .I don't know what the sauces actually were as their english was not all that great but they were the BOMB!  And you know if the English is lacking normally the food is FULL OF FLAVOR!!  =D  

They did NOT disappoint!  I had to get a hot dog and honestly I have to say that it was a hot dog with crisp cabbage and crunchy potato chips on it.  Did it have a lot of flavor?  Not really.  Did it have an GREAT texture, YES it did!  =)  BUT next time for me I would bypass the hot dog and get the cachapa.

Now onto why the 4 stars. . .cachapas. . .do you love corn?  I mean fresh off the cobb roasted corn?  If the answer is yes then you are going to LOVE the cachapa!  As soon as I opened the to go container the aroma of freshly roasted corn just wafted up to my nose and I was in corn heaven!  =)  I took a bite and it bascially melted in my mouth as  corny goodness.  YUMMILICIOUS!!!  The meat and cheese inside was delicoious.  Trust me this is the thing to get here!  JUST GET ONE!!  You will not regret it!  =)

I had their fried cheese tequeno. . .delicious as well. . .=)

2235921,2015-12-28,6,iTCH7y2KLRMKMxdEkgUK1g,"Have you seen their new truck? Have you tried the domino arepa? These are just a couple of reasons to check out Street Dogs or revisit if it's been a while. I crave arepas the same way others dream of tacos, so I've tried every option in town and these are my favorite. I always see the same people preparing my food and I believe that makes Street Dogs more consistent than the rest. They no longer park at the Rainbow Blvd address listed on Yelp. Be sure to check Instagram/social media to see where the truck stops during the week. They travel all over Las Vegas and Henderson.

I was so happy when they added the domino arepa to their menu. It's a delicious vegetarian option consisting of savory black beans, sweet plantains, and mozzarella cheese. My daughter eats the Venezuelan-style black beans by the cup, and she'll even talk to the friendly owner and order them by herself. She knows what she wants when she sees this truck. If you've tried black beans from a Cuban restaurant, the flavor is similar. Just call them caraotas instead of frijoles. My husband's arepa of choice is the reina pepiada. 

The cachapas are tasty if you enjoy sweet corn pancakes, but a little heavy on the butter. I'd like to add beans to a cheese cachapa and see how that tastes, but I'm always craving the savory arepa. The creamy green and spicy red sauces complement the food perfectly. The new truck has a larger kitchen that's better equipped to execute their expanding menu, so it's a good time to try something new.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,11,10,5,yrII449xcNFUjH7EvpFxeg

#%^#^*

If you like corn cakes in Mexican cuisine, these are going to blow your tastebuds off! The corn (maize) dough starts off as an unassuming batter, but after they're done with it on the griddle and when you take your first bite into it, your mouth won't even know what to do! It's so good! I loved the subtle, unexpected sweetness the batter offered. It was also such a pleasure to find little kernels of corn hiding in the dough. The pulled pork filling was abundant and exceptionally moist with delicate flavor. The silky white cheese flavor is gentle to the palate in order to not take control of the show; this allows the corn dough and pork to shine through in all of its rightful glory! I could cut the entire thing easily with my plastic fork, so it wasn't dense in the slightest. I ate each bite with their creamy green aji sauce and the yellow spicy sauce and it was bananas! A wonderful punch of flavor to the face! I'll be the first to admit this - I really didn't want to share. It was so insanely delicious! I can definitely chalk this one up on the board as one of the best things I ever ate. Flavor rating: 5/5 through the sky! (Note: Wow pork cachapas prices raised to $10 now :O holy moley lol that's $$$$!) 

I also tried the little discs of joy called fried arepitas which are fried cheese and I think coated with a light corn batter. They were very delicate and surprisingly not drenched in oil. I'm not typically keen on fried cheese, so this was not my favorite, but it is certainly a great version. I enjoyed them more with the red hot sauce and their creamy green aji sauce! Flavor rating: 4/5

Oh yeah and their Venezuelan arepa is hooked up! Stuffed to the maximum with a mountain (see pics) of juicy and flavorful pulled pork and oh man, the dough its resting in between: so fresh & fluffy! It truly melted in my mouth like butter! However, I personally preferred the sweet corn Cachapas dough, since it had corn kernels and it's slightly sweet - but this one is also quality for sure. Flavor rating: 4/5

This brand new humble food cart in Las Vegas has forever changed my Venezuelan food life!

PRO TIP: call for their hours since the hours listed on yelp are wonky & call if you must have a Cachapas since they can run out on a good day.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,19,20,5,Twi1hqyqO3u5quwzIn8Cvw

ATMOSPHERE: 

Parking lot...standing room only with a few tables out front to dine on unless you wanna dine in your car, you're at one of Vegas' latest street vendors on Rainbow in the same lot as Rogue Toys.


BITES/BEVERAGES:

Tasty, hearty Venezuelan fare awaits you as  husband and wife team Luis and Elianita serve up Venezuelan style appetizers,  hot dogs, hamburgers, Arepas, and Cachapas-my absolute favorite thing to get here. Being that it was our first time here, Luis suggested the deliciously massive Mix Hamburguesa Combo ($8.50- your choice of  beef, chicken, or smoked boneless pork chop ) add to that ham, cheese, bacon, mini fries, lettuce and tomato and their sauces on the side..and wait! Your choice of fries or mini cheese arepitas(5) AND a drink??? Can you say sweet deal? You also got all your food groups covered! That's the most expensive thing here, and FYI, any combo comes with a drink, so we got their Papelon con limon, I guess its their version of a lemonade.

 If you're a fan of M&M Soul Foods' Corn Cakes, stop by and try the Cachapa, a sweet corn cake made with masa harina and bits of corn that is filled with cheese and/or your choice of meat ($3.99-$5.99) I went with beef and cheese, and I so wish they would include fried plantains that would elevate it even more. Nevertheless, still tasty and pretty generous portion. Luis' wife Elianita just had to tempt us again with their popular Teque√±os which is essentially thinly rolled bread dough wrapped around queso blanco and fried ($3.99/6 or $7.50/12) They also offer a chocolate version, but I'm almost positive that it is NUTELLA inside! These bad boys are ADDICTING!

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Way tastier than Viva Las Arepas, great price point and awesome service from a great couple, check Street Dogs out if you're in the area. Oh, and if you spend over $15, a free mini Tiramisu or Tres Leches is included... ALOHA!!!

4107063,2015-03-19,2,iTCH7y2KLRMKMxdEkgUK1g,"I was hoping to find something mindblowing, and I did. It wasn't what I expected though.

With Rika Arepa Express still out of commission, I sought out Street Dogs to try to satisfy my arepa craving. It was actually easy to spot their trailer in their usual spot on Rainbow Blvd because it was the only color in an otherwise deserted parking lot, and they have roadside flags that the wind today made clearly visible. Unfortunately, you probably have to make an inconvenient U-turn if you're approaching from the south.

The beef arepa ($5.50) was actually quite good, with a nice crispy corn flatbread, plentiful shredded and marinated beef, sliced tomato, and melted cheese. You can add garlic mayo, some sort of spicy sauce, ketchup, or mustard (all chilled in ice) to your taste. I'd choose it over Viva Las Arepas, but not over Rika, and I'd try the pork or chicken next time since the beef was just a little on the tough side.

The pork cachapa was the real star of the meal, and well worth the $8.50 for the incredible flavors. One bite had me so hooked that I had to force myself to add sauces (they worked). The sweet, soft pancake-like bread made from corn (including some intact kernels) is folded like a crepe to hold the tender shredded pork (even more so than the beef) and the gooey cheese. Topped with a pat of butter, this sweet and savory concoction is utterly ridiculous. I was sad that I had to use a fork and knife slowly instead of stuffing the whole thing down my throat.

Arepas and cachapas both come with a drink, which can be canned soda, bottled water, papelon con limon. It's a sweet sugar cane drink with a subtle but noticeable citrus tone. It definitely complements the arepa more, but it can still work with the cachapa. I only got one drink, but it's probably wiser for me to avoid diabetes anyway.

Catch a cachapa, peeps. You'll love it.

(QUICK UPDATE 3/26/15: beef hot dog pretty interesting and tasty, also not as good as cachapa. Ham cachapa has some meat but a more reasonable price tag. ""Chocolate"" (nutella) teque√±o is a fun dessert, and cheese teque√±o is a savory cheese stick apparently made with Muenster.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,5,5,N0wlTNInvRbEmjEX6GQ20w

It is a stand located on rainbow and sahara in the parking lot right across from Camille by Manon. It is operated by two friends.

Venezuelan burger: Obviously if you've taken a look at the photos the burger stands out and should be able to walk out of the photo and enter straight into your mouth.  What seemed to be a monster of a creation didn't make me feel like a monster afterwards.  The burger was neatly organized and not all that greasy.  We got the beef + pork which was a great pair that was further enhanced by the sauces they have.  The tan sauce was like a spicy ranch while the green sauce was a creamy cilantro. It seems like its big but one person can easily finish it.

Mini Arepas.  These tiny coins had more value than gold to me.  Nicely crispy exterior with a gooey and cheesy interior.  

Cachapas: Wow a maize pancake with an awesome blend of cheese, this was the highlight.  It was wonderfully soft with sweetness from the corn that would get all tangled and caught up from the amount of cheese that this thing had.  Honestly if you had to get one thing here, the cheese cachapas is king.

Overall: Very affordable with great selections and cordial service.  Food was absolutely divine and I have been converted.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,2,4,5,wq6sRSGkig0_L4tBy9MTDg

Per recommendation, we got a mix burger of pork and beef (+ ham, cheese, bacon, fried egg, mini fries, lettuce, and tomato.)  The burger looks like a beast and I thought it give me that greasy, ""why did I just eat that??"" feeling, but that wasn't the case.  Everything was cooked perfectly and despite all the meat, I didn't have any oil dripping out of the burger.  Add in some of the sauces and you are good to go!  My favorite of the 5 sauces were the spicy and garlic ones, which I was told by the cook, the sauces are homemade.  

The combo also comes with a drink and arepitas  (mini arepas that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They were extra tasty with the sauces as well!  For the drink, you can get either a soda, water, or papelon con limon (which is raw hardened sugar can juice/lemonade). We got the papelon con limon and it tasted a little like tamarindo to me. Definitely worth a try if you like drinks like that.  After all of that, we still wanted more so we came back for a second order which consisted of cachapas & tequenos.

Although I was getting full, everything still tasted oh soo yummy!  The cachapas was like a corn pancake folded over with cheese inside and topped with butter.  A sweet and savory concoction that I will gladly have at any time of the day.  I'm glad we got it without any meat because the simplicity of it, let it stand out.  

The tequenos was recommended as an appetizer, but I opted for it as dessert.  It is like a mozzarella stick, but the filling can either be nutella or cheese and the outside is dough.  I got the nutella tequeno and it was the perfect way to end the meal.

Don't know where communication fell short, but no pork, alas, cheese pancake for me. Woo.
Arepas with pork- I picked out the meat,  wasn't too interested in what it was wrapped in, but have to say pork was delicious and flavorful. 
 Fries are average garden variety and best thing about the meal was definitely the sauces. 
 Not the best value- cheese cachapas and fries are $8. With meat- $10. Meh.
 My kids are adventurous eaters, but they weren't interested either, after taking a bite each. 
 All in all I was pretty disappointed- after reading rave reviews, I actually painstakingly tracked them down through Instagram and trekked across town to Balloon Festival, where Street Dogs took up a three day residence. 
 I hesitate to recommend it. I do think it's an acquired taste so to be fair, other reviewers seemed to be into South American food and were probably more used to flavor combinations.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,1,1,3,-s55lni6pLkSb2wGQ6Ju4g

When visiting a food truck featuring foreign foods, I usually go for the stuff that you'd have a hard time finding in the USA, (in this case it would be Arepas),but the Hot Dog looked sooooo good and the taste matched its appearance!

Although hot dogs are common in the USA, this type isn't!  As a matter of fact in my humble opinion if it's not a Chicago Hot Dog made with Vienna brand meat I won't like it... but the Venezuelan hot dogs are GREAT!

I went at night so I couldn't see the true color of the meat, but it had a wonderful flavor that's almost like Bavarian Weisswurst..  They load it up with condiments and sauces, and they recommend adding the green sauce that's in the bottles on the tables.  They added something to it to give it a little crunch (either slivers of tortilla chips or potato chips) which makes all the difference in the world.  Really wonderful stuff!

The price includes a canned soft drink OR a traditional Venezuelan drink made of sugar cane juice and lime which I opted for and was so glad I did.  It tasted like a good quality limeade without having loads of nasty chemicals and artificial flavors.
