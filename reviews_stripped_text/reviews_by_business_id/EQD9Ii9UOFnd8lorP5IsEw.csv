It had a different feel then the typical old school diner DQ I remember, having a little more stylish update look. the chicken strip basket was pretty good not better then raising canes or chickenbonz but did the spot and was plenty filling.  As for the ice cream treats like the dilly bars, DQ sandwiches a bit smaller then I remember and now premade and boxed up. Where was the big white DQ bag with each individually wrapped frozen treats? I guess its good, customers don't have to wait for them to be made but that's what separated them from store bought ice cream

Anyways they still have the blizzards, sundaes, dipped cones, and banana splits.  Don't forget the waffle bowls. The workers at this location was pretty friendly and let's us stay until we finished even though they were closed. 

If you go online and sign up for the blizzard fan club they always offer buy one get one free for blizzards.  Never tried an Orange Julius before so i'll try it next time",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,0,4,JXhvNGw64Ig28NAwuk3EYQ

A Blizzard is a soft serve with the consistency of concrete. With a flavor for everybody, not finding one to meet your taste would be more difficult.

Two of my classic favorites are the mint Oreo and the Reese's peanut buttercup. Look no further with these two items on the menu. 

The only complaint is how slow the drive thru is.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,pmkQ7IaG9zSIu5jiBV6PVg

Dessert was great!",fuVOxtBymws7k8D8lTA_ew,0,0,2,K0E2kvqTRiuQRYZTvadhHg
