A new item is their homemade Kimchi which is a little different than Korean Kimchi. It has other vegetables in it, that are not usually in kimchi, I'm assuming it's used as a filler here. Large pieces of green onions/scallions. I'd prefer to get the Korean style Kimchi which they usually have in their market cold section.
