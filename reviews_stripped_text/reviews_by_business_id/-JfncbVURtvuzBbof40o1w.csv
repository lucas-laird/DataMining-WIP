First of all, the service is horrible in here.Nobody can speak English properly.Most of the workers are Indians and Asians between ages 45-65 year old grandmas.foods aren't good.It's just ok. I would rate them 0 for their nasty customer service.There is an Asian old grandma who is impolite and filthy-mouthed .We were waiting for someone to help us and she just came without saying hi .Just looked at me and said ""come"".Then , there was only one menu on the table and I asked for second one.She just stared at me and said first seat and I'm going to give it to you in a very bad way.Even my little brother noticed how bad she behaved.I just called another worker and told her that please let me know who is  the manager?I asked the Asian old grandma's name which was Chonita /chunita lol .Then I talked to manager and complained about her .My first and last experience in this restaurant was horrible and I will never come back again.I just put 0.00 tip for them .Because I didn't receive any good service in here.I felt like the manager was kind of scared of the workers and He can't control and manage them well.The worst restaurant at Monte Carlo.Let me add this that Chunita was very good with Asians and treated them differently.So , the workers are racist too.wow",Y2bZpyZbtM8ov9r--J96KQ,2,0,1,JBmurpZiTQL36AfxPM3aqA

She did bring a hot plate of potatoes.  Never returned to check on things or provide refill of hot water for my tea.  Just flew past and dropped the bill.

The waitress told me she wasn't supposed to bring me another juice but offered me ice so I could make it cold (and watered down).

1476516,2012-08-19,0,-JfncbVURtvuzBbof40o1w,"I went here twice. When my friends and I just flew in and were hungry. We decided to try out the restaurant in our hotel because it's near and it's hot outside to walk. We also got the $50 free dining at Monte Carlos so we were thinking why the heck not. Getting a table there was decently quick, but the service was absolutely horrid. I think it is just pattern at Monte Carlos. It also took a really long time to get our food. I want to say the wait was around 20 minutes or so. Either way, we had the sampler platter as appetizer which was pretty decent. The quesadilla was okay not stuff with all cheese and little meat, the meat to cheese portion was good. The buffalo wings were a little undercooked, but not so bad. The potato skin though, was actually not edible. It was cold, the cheese was hard and the potato was stale so we didn't touch that after we tried a little piece. The sliders was the best part. The meat was cooked medium so you see a little pink and the bun was warm, kind of soft and not soggy. Our entree on the other is the biggest let down. My friend asked for no bleu-cheese and salmon to be cooked medium. The waitress said they only cooked it to well done. Her salad came out with well done salmon with shredded bleu cheese all over. My friend's fish was bland and the vegetable was overcooked. My alfredo pasta was the worst. The sauce was really bland to the point where it just had a creamy texture with the taste like water and the chicken was so salty it was like eating the salt bottle. I added salt to the pasta and it still didn't helped. We only got asked if the food was okay once and our waitress never came back. So I was left unimpressed and definitely didn't want to come back again. It took us a long time to get our waitress' attention to get the check. Our billed came out to be around 70~ with three entrees and one appetizer. The second time I went there because we had the intention of trying brand steakhouse but they were closed and we didn't know what was open at the time so we just went back with our other friends that flew in. The second time was the worser version of the first time. The whole place was empty and we still have to wait for table for about 10-15 minutes. I think it was because they only one waiter and like two helpers at night. We sat down and about to order our food because we knew it would took long time but the guy who took our drink order said that he could only take drink orders and that our waiter will come to us soon. That was a lie. He didn't come soon at all. My friend ordered the pizza, sampler appetizer again, and sliders. My slider came with only 3 sliders so it was literally a snack which was okay. My friend's sampler's wing was cooked well this time and the pizza wasn't so bad. Diner's food really. When the waiter brought out my friend's tea, he didn't give us the sugar so we had to ask him. The waiter proceeded to ask the couple near us for their sugar container which I think is pretty rude and shouldn't all tables have their own container? After we were done eating, the waiter was nowhere to be found and so we ended up just going to the cashier to pay. So bottom is the service is horrible, food is inconsistent and sort of decent, the atmosphere is non-existent.

Really? Could they have just taken five extra minutes to give this place a better name?

Well, it's open 24 hours and smack-dab in the middle of the Monte Carlo ground floor. Cheap(er) drinks (under $10 in Vegas is a steal) but unmemorable food. That is, except for their POT PIE. Seriously, this thing was literally the size of a real pie, filled with scorching hot gravy, chicken, carrots, potatoes and onions. The exterior was a little more doughy than a croissant, and deep underneath this buttery coat there was a little dish . It was the shining star of the meal. Literally, I've never had a better pot pie in my entire life.

Service was slow, but our waitress told us the kitchen was a little backed up, and she was sure to keep our drinks coming.

I just felt I had to comment on that monumental pot pie more than anything.

1661542,2013-11-29,0,-JfncbVURtvuzBbof40o1w,"I am a fan for the following reasons:

1.) A good place for a hangover solution with no wait. I was with a party of 6 and there was no trouble in getting service. 
2.) Good menu offereings: I purchased the 12 dollar corn beef hash which was nicely made--no canned corned beef and good portion to satisfy my hunger. Also helped me deal with the darn hangover. The hash and the meat portions were good--not overly meaty and not overly hashy. There's another corn beef hash on the menu that had extra hash on the side (I declined that option since I try not to consume too much carbs) I also go the espresso creme brulee which was SO GOOD. I will say the espresso flavor was on point but the actual custard itself wasn't as creamy as I would like. But it was good regardless! 
3.) Full bar offering. Even though I was suffering from a hangover, I still took a grey goose shot like a champ! (I didn't buy this and it was still gross since I HATE Vodka) BUT I was able to chase it down with some tasty OJ. 

The Cafe is a much better offering than the typical fast food b-fast/brunch places. If you are staying or are around the Monte Carlo, this is definitely a nice and convenient alternative for dining.

I was torn between the Fish & Chips and Turkey sammy. Our waitress explains them both to aid the decision making process. I ended up ordering the Open Face Turkey Sandwich with gravy on the side. My brother orders Eggs Benedict. 
Our food came out promptly as the bro and I were in some deep conversation. The waitress explains that she didn't bring out my brother's eggs because they weren't cooked correctly. I guess the chef cooked them over hard and so she made the executive decision to have them re-made. Never seen that happen before in my life. She was really on par.
My turkey was dry *as expected* but the gravy made it more tasty. I loved the cranberry compote.

With a full workload at my job I chose to skip dinner the previous night in order to finish up early and join my two traveling companions for the long drive to Las Vegas filling myself later with snack chips, candy and bottled water instead.  That's not a whole lot of nutrition for someone with a goal of running in two races on Saturday and Sunday.

It seems eating wasn't a main priority for either of my friends once we arrived in Las Vegas.  After checking into the hotel then taking the long walk to the Sands Convention Center to pick up our race numbers for Sunday's half marathon and marathon my friends opted to go do some shopping instead.  I opted to return to the hotel on my own, drop off my things in the room and have an early dinner instead.

After checking out the menus on all of the restaurants at the casino level of the Monte Carlo I decided to try Café based on the menu and the somewhat reasonable prices.  The 24 hour restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner whenever.

We entered the Cafe at Monte Carlo and the host was a little bit rude when I asked for a table instead of a boot. So, when we sit, I asked her to plug my battery charger on the wall and she denied it.  I asked why? ANd she said that she was not allowed, and that I should talk with the manager. So, while my girlfriend was choosing on the menu, I went to talk with the manager, hoping that it is not a problem only a position problem. Wrong me. The manager, being very rude use the excuse that she can't put it into a wall because of ""fire issues"" - I was almost buying that and coming back to my table, but the way that she said to me and offering no solution to my case, also, when I turn back to my table, the hostess said a very ironic ""I told you"".... Anyways, I know that they are selling food, not battery charges, but, the way that people received me was just wrong. I decided to frustrate my girlfriend and get up and choose other place. 

Leaving the restaurant we found a power outlet on the outside wall of the same Cafe. I plugged my batter in, wait for 15 minutes and had enough charge to take my pictures and find another restaurant, that plugged my battery again with a nice ""No problem, let me take care of that"".

We were seated instantly and there were only two other tables that were occupied in our section.  After being seated, we were never acknowledge or greeted by our server for about 10 minutes even though she and her assistant saw us. Not even offered a cup of coffee or water which I thought was very unusual for a coffee shop/cafe restaurant inside of a large hotel/casino. 
Our server finally came over and took our order which was a typical and simple breakfast order.  We waited and waited for our food all while our server came by a couple times to tell us it was almost done and to refill our coffee.  A runner finally brought our meal out and mine was wrong so he took it back to be corrected and returned it very fast.  
The food was good but it was ice cold and after waiting so long for it there was no way I was going to send it back.  By now, our section had started to fill up and I noticed how fast other orders were being taken and food being served.
