Try finding that anywhere else in the valley and I guarantee the quality is bad. I had all three meals for 3 days while we had our baby. We're going to have dinner there every week",17yHr8bPrkmwjXML2aj7HQ,2,1,5,50arGj6rIEbXNeelfb0kSw

Well, regardless, the almond joy blended drink ($4.90 regular, $4.75 with badge) was the BEST drink ever. Price was fair for the quality & quantity of product.

Service was very cordial. Guy working the register (7/28/14) could not have been more pleasant. 

Coffee shop is more like a small bar on the left side of the main entrance. Easy to grab in less than 5 minutes on your way in / out of the hospital. 

I live close and I'm not above coming here for a drink in my off hours.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,4,4,YBMMNu8FGxZ_zm03LYME3Q
