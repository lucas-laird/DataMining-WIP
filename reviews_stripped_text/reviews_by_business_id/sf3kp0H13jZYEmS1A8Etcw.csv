32102,2015-02-19,0,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"The first time I dined here with my husband it was great. Sadly when I brought back my entire family it was a different story. I called to make a reservation, which hardly seems necessary since it always empty, I made me reservation and confirmed that the menu with the poutine fries would be available. The hostess replied of course as if it wasn't to be of concern. I was running 5 minutes late so I called inform them and again I confirmed that the poutine would be available since that's what I was raving about with my family. The manager answered and informed me that that menu is no longer available but because I was coming in specifically for that, should would confirm with the chef that they could make it. She got back on the phone and confirmed. When we finally got to the restaurant we ordered 3 orders of poutine, entrees, appetizers, and wine. When we got the poutine I was so disappointed. The fries were hard, there was barely any gravy or meat. I would have rather come in another time when the poutine was available than have them ""make an exception"".",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,1,0,1,EnZDorLsGejEHgPMYTPocg

A friend and I went in for the $6 lunch specials and were not disappointed at all. We both got the same thing (I know lame but the hear wants what the heart wants) the summer berry salad was delicious with lots of berries and the candied walnuts were awesome. The BLT was great, nice crunchy brioche, thick bacon and a tasty aioli. We split the chicken pot pie nuggets which were dreamy. The place was pretty empty while we were there but I can see how it would get busy in the evenings. We will go back for sure.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,0,4,BOCbKKphMC_6tyhSJqzyQQ
124296,2013-03-18,2,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"I will fully admit that I don't hide my hatred for over-hyped restaurants on the strip or failed areas of town like Tivoli Village, so it was with great hesitation that I took a few recent suggestions to go try the burger at View Wine Bar. Many restaurants and stores have come and gone from this ghost town of a shopping area, and I question how long anything could survive there based on how few people are around each time I visit. Because no one is ever there I typically assume that this means there's nothing worthy of perusing or devouring here, but after my most recent visit I couldn't be more wrong.

The View Wine Bar is located upstairs in the extremely odd and poorly identified Market LV area of Tivoli; billed as ""something you would find in New York or San Francisco"" this is anything but. They're trying to provide a series of mom and pop style shops in a 'cool' loft style space, but the whole thing seems kind of amateur and is really awkward to walk through. We went on a Saturday and it almost felt like we were accidentally walking into people's private studios or something. The bar itself isn't completely defined, but kind of spills out into the circulation of the market. Too much open space in between slightly oversized tables and chairs flank the 'view' out to the dinky fountain and lovely valet area below. The menu is tapas-style with many reasonably priced, decent sounding items prepared with the ""freshest, seasonal ingredients"" according to their website. Being on a mission, I skipped all the tempting items and ordered the 8oz triple angus burger with tomato jam, lettuce, balsamic onions and additional toppings. You also have the choice of egg, pork belly, bacon, caramelized onions and a few other items that don't sound as good.

I went with the additional pork belly as I'm always a sucker for it, and what came out a few minutes later looked as amazing as it tasted. The meat had really great fresh beef flavor, not much char but delicious nonetheless and cooked perfectly all the way through. The tomato jam had really good sweet flavor, and the pork belly was really tasty and crispy but not quite present enough. I pulled a few bites out to eat separately and enjoyed them, but would probably just skip it next time to save the dollar and enjoy the rest of the flavors on their own. The shredded lettuce and balsamic glaze were a nice touch. The bun was sweet and fresh; possibly the same as Bachi's but maybe a tiny but more dry. Also the bun was randomly a bit too cold when it first came out, but warmed up a bit because of the patty as I was eating. The cheese was melted but not at all noticeable with the strong beef and jam flavors to compete with it. The three different pickles speared to the top were all great, and a nice touch to start off my meal. In all this was a fantastic burger and a total shock based on other meals I've had there recently.

The fries were equally fantastic; thick and cooked well tossed with white truffle oil and a dusting of parmesan. Sadly there were way too few of them, they should almost double their serving size so I don't feel like I'm consciously rationing them through my entire meal. The mustard, ketchup and mayo were a good touch too. While $13 might be a few dollars towards the high end for some folks being an off-Strip location, the quality of ingredients and great flavor of this meal make it completely worth it. I'm almost scared as to whether this restaurant will survive based on how few people go to Tivoli, so I suggest you make your way there to eat this burger and keep this place open until I can make it back again.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,4,4,5,1GlcztyfdEznRJiKIYl4Ew

The decor is very modern yet classic and makes the dining experience fun.  The views of Tivoli and the location within an artsy, boutique market shop area set this dining experience above a lot of traditional restaurant setups.  The restaurant combines bar area, closed area seating, and open area seating.

The selection of beers and wines are quite excellent.  The beer and wine compliment the cheese selections quite well.  I have really enjoyed the cheese and meat selections chosen by the chef for the charcuterie plates.  Portions are appropriately sized as to allow patrons to enjoy both food and drink.  Over-portioning on the food can diminish the enjoyment of the beverages.  The filet mignon entree is excellent and was served with a well made asparagus side.

The HH specials included $2 wine and $1 PBR.  Add that to the 15% off Yelp check-in offer and it was a sweet deal.
I really enjoyed the atmosphere and our server was very nice, BUT service was extremely amateurish.  We didn't try the red wine as we were told it was coming out of the tap carbonated - um, yuck?  The server could not answer basic menu questions, such as what kind of oysters they were offering or details of the cheese.  I also noticed the cheese was pre-sliced and being handled with bare hands without any hand washing before or after when he then handled money.  As other servers came into the bar area, they were busy on their cell phones instead of helping with service, so it took a long time to get a glass of water or our second course.
I tried the risotto cakes, chicken pot pie nuggets and oxtail croquettes.  Everything was good, but I was especially impressed with the chicken pot pie nuggets and would get them again.

About 20 total selections, most of which were drastically overpriced and underwhelming. Our waiter, who told us he was also the bartender was nice as well as attentive, although he made it clear that his wine knowledge was limited when I asked for a ""bold red with a smooth finish"" and someone else came to have me sample wines that did not fit that bill. Now, on to the food... The tomato soup was SO sweet I couldn't tolerate it, so it was sent back. The risotto cakes were decent and came with a nice variety of sauces. We ordered the 5 cheese plate, which included what seemed to be American Feta (yuck) and grapes that were probably a week old. For $17, this was quite disappointing. Still not being full, I ordered the Lobster Mac, which for the record contains not 1 piece of Lobster. At that point I was a little too disillusioned to ask why they called it Lobster Mac, I figured I would probably hear that it had ""lobster broth"" or some lame thing like that, so I just decided to chalk it up to a $13 mistake. The chicken pot pie pie bites were a bit salty, the truffle fries were okay but not great. All in all, a $75 meal that would have been much better spent elsewhere, but at least now we know. If you are looking for an actual selection of wine with artisanal cheese, please spare yourself and go elsewhere.

Upon our return, the little middle space was open, and we grab a 2-top table. The seating was eclectic, but unfortunately my chair had an old, broken wicker back that kept poking me, making comfort next to impossible notwithstanding the padded seat.

We came for the happy hour. $3 draft English pub-style beer or $2 pinot noir, we went with the latter. But, to get that, you had to order food, the cheapest of which was $8/plate. Granted, the food was delicious, but a bit over-priced. We got tomato soup ($8), prosciutto-wrapped dates ($10) with a citrus-y flavor, and avocado bruschetta ($8). $2 wine led to a $44 tab.

But of course, I show up on a Saturday, and the drink specials are available but the burger is not offered on weekends during their brunch specials.

The brunch specials are affordable and large portions- particularly the $8 omelet, made with 4 eggs, mushrooms, spinach, and an unspecified ""artisan cheese"" that tasted like a regular sharp cheddar. It was cooked well and served with a side of sliced, fried potatoes, that were the only disappointment on the plate, as they were extremely greasy.

Service during my visit was friendly and fun, bartender reminded me of Mr. Clean and had a great personality. Unfortunately, during their ""brunch hours"" (open-3PM weekends?), they have a DJ blasting music that didn't really go with the vibe of the ""wine bar"" (and eventually gave me a headache, no drinking necessary).

Eventually I'll come back for that $5 burger my friends raved about...

Its located upstairs, along with some eclectic retail shops.  Out of sight, out of mind kind of situation.

Generally speaking everything is served tapas style.  The food presentation is very nice for a tapas style restaurant.  Most tapas places to me are very lazy with the presentation.  The food is presented like mini-entrees, very nice.  

What to order:
- Meatballs are phenomenal. Served with red sauce, side of toast, salsa and green sauce
- Avocado Bruschetta. Nice tangy taste to offset the avocado
- Fried chicken is great, white meat.  It is also served on a bed of mixed vegetables
- The chicken pot pie nuggets are decent, be careful, its very hot on the inside..Looks like small dumplings.
- For dessert, we love the binets as well as the carrot cake.

Basically we like everything we've ordered on the menu so far.  We appreciate the creativity put into every dish.  Like I said some restaurants are not into presentation when it comes to smaller dishes, but everything looks and tastes great here.

View is the only place i know of so far that carries Wasatch Belgian-style White Ale on tap which is a HUGE deal to me seeing as i'm a fan of Wasatch brewing company. 

Other than that the best advice i can give to anyone wanting to check this place out is to not come hungry. Prices are decent with very little over 15 dollars but portion sizes are Tapas.

Roasted Brussels Sprouts 
- Lately becoming a bigger and bigger hit at finer dining locations. The Brussels Sprouts offered here are served with potatoes and have quite a nice balsamic reduction poured on top. The potatoes are damn good as well

Grilled Cheese
- An adult spin on a childhood favorite this sandwich is just amazing. The soft creamy brie with the local hone, balsamic reduction, pesto, grapes, and others to enhance that subtle flavors of the brie

Fries Poutine
- Thick cuts of crispy on the outside soft on the inside covered in melted cheddar cheese and topped with what i think were large chunks of fried bacon. The red wine gravy was a bit on the sweet side but it went well with the salty fries as long as you take it one dip at a time. The ox-tail was battered and deep fried in a way that made them kinda of...shredded beef sticks which was strange at first but tasted quite excellent.

Rosen Colorado Lamb Chop
- one lamb chop already sliced. I was looking for more of a gamey taste but there was very little and not that spiced as well. Still good but i was expecting much more in terms of serving size and taste.

And then came time to check out. We had the 15% deal for checking in. The manager has to redeem it. We waited 10 minutes after receiving the bill, then asked the bar back to please help. Mind you, it's closing time, so while there are plenty of things they need to do to close but there  were not very many people left in the place. We waited another 10 minutes and finally just said forget the discount. Our husbands were waiting for us and we needed to leave. Why offer a discount if it's so difficult to redeem?

I've been here about 7-10 times. The food some happy hour menu/some not, has always been decent. A handful of delish dishes, to some super average dishes. They have a decent wine selection as well. 

The service has always been ok. One time my girlfriend and I went on a Sunday and sat at the bar. We asked the bartender what he would suggest for food and he pointed a few things out on the menu. It was good. 

After I got home I went on my IG to follow The View......and noticed that there is a SUNDAY special. Lobster, corn, dessert, etc.  I've been here at least twice on a Sunday and have never been told about this. Maybe they were out?? I mentioned it on IG with no response from the person running their page. 

I want to really like this place, there has been nothing terrible, but nothing outstanding either. I will give it another go at some point.

Highlights: 
Incredibly small portions...good, but not great items in general...innovative menu items

Refreshingly good wine selection...though most varieties start at $12/$13 a glass and go up

Exceedingly friendly/welcoming staff...It is clear that customer service is a priority here

I'm a fan of the modish/distressed/industrial/weathered tables & décor 

The view...of what again?...a fountain?  

Enjoyable live music!


Enjoyed a very good evening here with a group of friends.  It was immediately that the management here cares about the customer.  I really appreciated the friendliness of the staff.  The 3 servers I've had the opportunity of experiencing were helpful with the food, but need more wine training/experience to be helpful with wine selections...kind of useful when you're a wine bar.

We had a lot of food items here...as much because of the portion size as anything...and we paid more than anticipated to be full as a result.  Although most items were good, there is nothing we ate that I would specifically come back for...not one truly memorable item.  I listed what we tried in order of what I like the most: 
Tuna Tartare Tacos (a little on the small side, but tasty)
Butternut Squash Soup (lovely flavors...banana even)
Onion Soup (fans of French Onion should try)
Oxtail Croquets  
The Hero Sandwich
Steamed Clams
Tivoli Wrapped Dates (the minuscule size is what kills this dish)
Pork Belly French Fries (Don't remember the actual name of this item) 
Gnocchi Gratin
Organic Mushroom Risotto (not bad...but not good...so many places do this better)
Lobster Bisque (still searching for decent lobster flavor)
Chicken ""Pot Pie"" Nuggets (left wanting)

If I came back I would try the lobster mac and I heard great things about the cheese boards.

Come here for a wonderful ambiance and different feel than Vegas typically offers!
Come here for a nice wine selection!
Come here to enjoy solid live music!...not sure what nights though
Come here when you're at Tivoli because it's better than most of the other options!
Don't come here for a beautiful view!
Don't come here to eat a lot and enjoy a food coma!
Don't come here on a budget!

They offer a 15% discount when you check-in on Yelp!

It was crowded with Summahoods finest plastic surgery set, a band (including an upright bass, I'm a sucker for the upright bass) and Vanessa, Tien, Anthony & yours truly indulged and shared plates large and small. 

Anthony had butternut squash soup that was amaze; and the BLTA Flatbread which I nibbled a nom nom bite of a non pork belly containing corner. Vanessa had the grilled cheese: excellent quality brie with honey panini pressed:  it officially kicked all other grilled cheese asses. Her wedge salad with divine blue cheese: hold the bacon, was quite yummy too (that sounds dirty) I ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts ($6), half dozen oysters ($3 each) & 5 cheese platter ($15) w honey, fruit, British digestive biscuits & Carr's crackers. Our waitress was attentive, even brought more of those digestives I adore and extra mini tabascos (I collect hot sauce, love the minis!) The dark chocolate nutella cake was great and enough for all four of us to share. My glass of Pinot Grigio ($9) was a nice accompaniment to the cheeses in particular. For the life of me, I cannot recall what Tien had??

When we just popped our heads in a few months ago as they first opened, it looked sexy in the daytime. At night, it is even nicer. The obelisk/Tivoli lit up view is nice and the high ceilings give the space a loft vibe. 

The prices were reasonable (my bill was $48) and if you want to go for 3$ Pinot Grigio's & Pinot Noir's, you can sit inside the Cheese Shop during Happy Hour. Can't wait to go back.

First try was a stop in after cocktails in another restaurant in Tivoli....the bartender had told us to stop in and check this new wine bar out, so of course we had to. It's situated inside the new Market on top of Brio, so yes, you do get a ""view"", but it's of the valet drop off turnstile. I did like the decor, very shabby chic meets Pottery Barn. The bartender, Dante, was very friendly, he directed towards the seasonal wine list and recommend a French wine, I had asked him if it compared to a Sancerre, he didn't know what that was. Now I'm not saying you need to be a sommelier, but if you're a bartender working in a wine bar trying to sell me a $15 glass of wine, you might want to know your wines a little bit. Onto the food, extremely overpriced for the size, yes I get it is tapas, but come on, high way robbery. For example, we ordered the Nutella dessert cake, for $9 it was literally 3 bites. I asked for a cheese list, our waitress said they don't have one. Huh? So it's just a game of chance whatever I order? Waitresses choice? She followed it up with ""yeah we should get one"".

I'm ashamed to say that this is my first time here, considering that I live just down the street and have stated on several occasions to my hubs that we need to check this place out.  I love wine.  I love cheese.  I love bars.  Why in the hell haven't I been here yet!?  Alas, I finally made it and I'm so so glad that I did.  We were in the mood for ""bites"" of everything, so when I saw that this was a good place for tapas, we rolled on over the 1 mile it took us to drive.  At first we were seated in the ""dining"" area, next to the saxophone player.  That would've been okay, if we were just there for drinks, but the table was a regular height table and the chairs were comfy low chairs that would've made eating too much like work.  So, hubs and I moved to the bar, sat at a ""real"" table (I dubbed it Pinocchio), and proceeded to order different items from the menu.  First, let's just say everything on the menu sounded amazing.  I could've kept ordering, but hubs stopped me after 3 items (thankfully) and I honestly can't say I had a favorite, and that's a good thing.  Everything we ordered was so flavorful, and different and I'd do the same order all over again.  First, we got the chicken pot pie bites and they were perfect.  Savory, crispy little bites with perfect seasoning and worthy of the comfort food moniker.  Then, we got the lobster po'boi'.  Heavenly.  Just heavenly.  Served on a crispy bun, panini style...I can't say enough about this dish.  Lastly, we had the charcuterrie platter and each slice of meat was fresh, smoky, tender.  The pesto that was with it, as well as balsamic (tangy and thick) along with carrot curls and pickled onions perfectly complimented each meat selection, and the crostinis perfectly toasted.  My only advise is to ask for extra crostini, because there's more meat than there is crostini.  My ONLY complaint is the wine that I had.  I love a good New Zealand Sauv Blanc, and the only Sauv Blanc by the glass that they had was just a bit on the bitter side.  Really though, it wasn't bitter enough to keep me from ordering another glass.  Lastly, we finished our night of with a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake and O M G...I'm a complete snob when it comes to red velvet anything because nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to my Southern Great Grannie's RVC.

Went there to meet some friends for a quick drink, then on to a gallery opening downstairs.
We had such a nice time, ended up ordering snacks, a few rounds of drinks, and had to force ourselves to get up and go to the opening! I had lobster mac & cheese, yum! The burger looked really good, and the mushroom flat bread was delish! Can't talk about the pricing, one of our friends snuck to the bar and paid the bill. (Always a nice surprise!) But the food seemed very affordable on the menu!! Mostly smaller share plates, perfect for a place to sit and be social!

The staff was seemed so happy to see us, and truth be told they probably were. It was on the quieter side for a Friday night. The room is so cool, a cozy bar with small tables over looking Tivoli Sq.

It's a bit hard or confusing to find if you're not aware that it is upstairs.  The signs aren't all that helpful in Tivoli Village.  So... NOTE: it's upstairs and at the front of the building so once you go upstairs you'll need to head towards the front of the building.

Service was really good!

It can be a bit loud in there because it's open and airy, but really a nice place to just hang out.

The food was pretty good.  Upscale Comfort Food is the way I'd describe it. The tuna tartare nachos were spectacular.  I'd definitely order that again.

We ordered some appetizers and a bottle of wine. I asked for a few dishes to be made vegan. No problem. One came out with the sauce on it and had to send it back with the food runner. Our server noticed a new dish on the table and instead of asking us what we ordered or if there was a problem, she simply took it upon herself to ring in another dish to the bill. She didn't check the table very frequently, and I felt like we were more of a bother. We got the check and left. The food was okay, so we figured we would give it another chance. 

The end of 2014 we came for a happy hour one night. Their wines were on happy hour. We asked if there was a Pinot noir on happy hour. The server said no and seemed rather annoyed. He did suggest a wine similar to a Pinot noir and brought us a glass out to taste. It was okay. We asked what it was and the price because it was a little heavier than the usual pint noir. He said it wasn't on happy hour and was a 68 dollar bottle of a wine I can't remember. Whoa whoa whoa whoa!!! Now I am never one to really care about the price of anything, but if I'm there specifically for a happy hour bottle, why would you bring out one that wasn't? And if I asked for a Pinot noir, and you don't have one on happy hour, and your bringing out a regular priced wine anyway, why wouldn't you bring out your 70 dollar bottle of Pinot noir? Ugh! I was beyond annoyed and confused about what his motives were and what he was trying to do. Up selling is great, just listen to your customer!! When I say Pinot noir, give me a damn Pinot noir option. We left 5 bucks on the table for the sink waters and left. We probably won't be returning for a while.

When we arrived our friends had been sat but mentioned that after they got to the table the host poured them water and they hadn't seen anyone since... didn't think much of it at the time. 
We reviewed the menu for a while and our server, Kelsey, eventually appeared. We ordered drinks and my husband and I settled on the 5 cheese plate, a burger for him, and the pan seared tuna for me. 
Our friends opted for risotto bites, a burger, and the portobello burger. 
Drinks came out shortly followed by appetizers. After a while the two burgers came out then maybe 3 minutes later the portobello burger. 
They started eating and we realized my fish never arrived. After everyone else at the table was about 3/4 way through their meals our server came to check on us and we notified her. She said she would check on it...
She did not come back to give us any status update or explanation. At this point I decided I didn't want the dish since everyone else had eaten and I had probably eaten my weight in cheese plate. 
When another gentleman brought the food I told him I did not want it and he tried to tell me how busy they were etc. Mind you the tables adjacent to us had paid and left and the restaurant was not packed. 
When the server returned after this exchange she did not acknowledge my lack of food and we asked for our checks. 
Of course when she brought them to us my food was on our check. We mentioned this to her and told her we could not pay for it. She couldn't get away from us fast enough before my friend physically saw her mouth a certain plural expletive.

I ordered:

Butternut squash soup- this specific butternut squash soup really reminded me of bland baby food with no deep flavors. 

Avocado crostini- if you let these sit for a few minutes the crostini becomes soggy. By the menu description I thought the avocado, orange, and tomato were going to be sliced and placed on the crostini like a bruschetta but it was similar to a guacamole. The flavor was still solid it was just not what I was expecting 

Chicken pot pie nuggets-piping not; under seasoned 

Mary's fried chicken- this is not really a fried chicken but rather a lightly fried chicken that is pan fried on both sides and finished in the oven. Chicken needed to be taken out of the oven a minute sooner because it was slightly dry. The chicken was well seasoned and I thought the apple and Brussels sprouts complimented the chicken nicely. 

Apple cobbler- the glaze on the apples was overpowering; not enough crumble; average tasting cobbler 

I actually ordered the peach cobbler but was brought an apple cobbler. I did not notice until a few bites in and then I told the waiter. He said he had brought out the wrong one. You would think by the way the cobbler was garnished that he could tell which one is which. He said I can have the kitchen make the peach but it will take another 15 minutes. We passed on this offer and still ate it. He ended up charging us for the cobbler but it would have been a nice gesture if he removed it from the bill.

Meatballs with 2 dipping sauces, pesto and garlic tomato chutney. The meatballs  were a mixture of beef and veal. Great flavor and well paired with the 2 sauces.
Angus cheddar burger with garlic fries. The burger was good but nothing special. 2 burgers were ordered medium and 1 was more towards well done. The fries were tender and heavy on the garlic.

The charcuterie platter and selection of cheeses were good but could have used a wider variety. The mushroom risotto was rich and creamy, but could have used more mushrooms and seasoning and a lot less truffle oil.

Tables, sofas, high top tables and an inviting bar with...    Behold ...   a great view.

Take a date....    Just do it take a date.    Its tucked away but not hidden.   In a full room you feel like you are having a private conversation.    

Its a wine bar so not a surprise to find a bartender that can give an informed recommendation from the wine list...     giving sample tastes of different options before we decided on what we wanted.   Classy

NooooooooooOOOOO

Ok plan b

Skip the pork belly...    The pork is tender and nice but drenched in what tasted like ketchup.....   ew

Putine was a show stopper and the bites were awesome.    So its kind of tapas style which is great and social...   like a laid back and elegant option to firefly.

the place is called View Wine bar & kitchen with wine bar front and center....   so you dont get 10% off of wine...   just food.

When I asked where it was, I was suprised that he said: Tivoli Village. Lets be honest; that ishh is far. I barely even go to Red Rock! So, of course, he drove.

Got there and had no clue where we should even park because the parking wasn't so obvious.
After walking up to street level, we walked (semi)aimlessly to look for The Market. 

When we got into The Market, we realize that it's basically a warehouse with random rooms/kiosks with various shops. Pretty cool concept.

The View Wine Bar was the main eatery upstairs.

We had the happy hour red wine, cheese board, charchuterie (meat) board, clams, flatbread, and potpie chicken nuggets.

The only disappointment to the meal was the potpie chicken nuggets. All the workers were raving about it but, it was aight. It was good but, mostly breading....of course, fried breading is good.

Other than the obvious cheese board favorite, I really liked the marketfresh veggie flatbread with kale. It was such a strong flavor with the cheese and balsamic. I loved it.


We were seated right next to the piano and singer/entertainment of the night. Which was a 16 y/o John Mayer-like singer. Definately added to the winebar mood.


I was surprised to see that the service seemed to be lackluster in previous Yelp reviews bcuz all the workers/waitresses were nothing but, fast and courteous and knowledgeable.



pps. There's a 15% discount when checking into Yelp! The manager was happy that someone was there to redeem it =)",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,12,9,4,H8GDIypSTgrdzH72-tPJTg

We booked the private room in the back to run a business meeting, and the whole experience was terrible from the food to the service to the equipment. First off we got in the room and the AV unit wasn't working, called the staff over and he couldn't fix it. We then tried a bunch of things and finally after half hour one of my coworker got it to work but we had wasted a bunch of time. 

Then we got a prefix dinner. The chicken is super dry, super salty and overall disgusting and so was the Brussels sprouts side dish. Several people just left the food untouch. When it came to dessert, we got a few orders of the beignets and they were over fried to the point that they were burned and the corners of each one was turning black and super hard. Again not eatable.

The service was painfully slow, took forever to get our order of anything. The following day I called to speak to the onsite manager to share with him my experience. One of the staff took the call and told me that the manager was busy and would call me back. No response for several days. 4 days later I called again to ask to speak to manager, again busy and left a message, again 3 days passed and no call back!

I would conclude that this business is non-responsive to customer and just simply don't care. The food and service are equally terrible. Avoid!!!",8ZryN_S-n48g6rsa3W3QtQ,18,13,1,-kaVZcIchGynB7p8sln7iw

4 people went to celebrate a birthday and experienced service that can only be described as tragic: empty drinks,  forgetting about one of the tapas orders, clearing plates without asking and before being finished,  entres coming out 30+ minutes apart with the excuse of ""well you wanted it well done"", being handed a plate of the chef's cheese selection without being told what any of them were,  removing a purchased bottle of wine with wine still in the bottle, none of the soft drinks or tea listed being available,  absent and unresponsive wait staff,  literally throwing pens on the table for signing the check.

There are little shops around the restaurant you can look into such as dance classes, art stores, and even a hair salon. However, when I went most of them were closing down for the day. I stopped by the View Wine Bar at around 5:30 PM. 

We shared a bottle of merlot as we looked outside the window. It had a magnificent view of Tivoli village and a bit of the city. The wine was smooth. The waiter did a great job picking out a nice bottle for us. We ordered the dates and the avocado bruschetta. The dates were okay, but I am not a huge fan of them to begin with. However, my friend loves dates and she said it was tasty. 

The avocado bruschetta was SO GOOD! I loved the balance of the crunch in the bruschetta with the wiped avocado mixed with  orange, tomatoes, red onion, lime crema. We ordered a huge cheese platter that was great! I am not sure what cheeses were on there, but it was all good. I loved dipping the crackers in the drizzle of honey they had on the side. 

The ambiance was relaxing. Sometimes they have a piano player there to entertain the guests. The service was excellent. The food was good and I would definitely go back there for a girls night to enjoy wine and some tasting dishes. 

Make sure you park in the garage then go all the way up to the top floor above the Market. It is easier to get to the restaurant that way than to park behind Brio.",kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,2,0,4,ISvrhlD96CDUtLKUOycqug

My friend and I order the prime rib special for $ 24.95  It was very tough and fatty! The baked potato was soggy and about the size of  your fist or smaller. I left more than half and asked to see the manager. The manager listened to my concerns, but, was not offering any compensation and had the audacity to question how much I left on the plate! How rude and appalling to say this to a customer! I asked him to verify this with the bartender who took my plate away and would not! I had to request for the dinner to be deducted from the bill as all quality restaurants will do this if they take pride in their restaurant.

View wine bar and kitchen is such a cute, quaint, tasty, and fun place to hang out with your friends while enjoying some refreshing drinks and tasty treats. We ordered the chicken pot pie bites this time, they actually were not that good. They had a nice batter on the outside that resembled fish and chips type of batter. That looked good but then inside, it was kind of like a thick paste with bits of chicken and other things. $10 for about 9 of them, glad I tried but won't order them again. Then we had the triple angus burger for $12.95 with the fries and that is a default great choice. The burger was cooked perfectly, big, juicy, and satisfying. The fries here are so amazing and I'm not sure where they purchase their ranch but it's addicting!!! No diet friendly food here at all!

I can't comment much on the food because we only had the cheese tray to eat, but I thought that cheese tray was very good! 5 cheeses for $15 with a bunch of crackers, nuts, honey, mustard, etc. 

The wine list is, as expected, good with almost everything offered by the glass. I'd also be interested in some flights if they added those to the menu. In addition, they have a full bar (this is Vegas), so you can order pretty much anything you want.

Service was quick and super friendly and offered more like glass and a half pours. 

Prices are a little on the high side for wine glasses, but during happy hour (1-3 every day I think), they have $2 mimosas and bellinis! Maybe that's the best thing about this place!

The View Wine Bar also serves a bunch of mini dishes to either tie you over before dinner or to finish the job if dinner was too light.  Overall, the quiet, chill, and classy atmosphere at the View Wine Bar should make a fan of us all.  Sure makes a as perfect place for date night or fun/laughs with friends.

First things first, I need a drink. A nice wine selection and cocktail menu. I tried the east side Manhattan, and was very impressed. 

The food menu isn't huge but it has enough variety to please everyone I believe. Everything I've tried, which includes the mushroom risotto, the meatballs, the Brussel sprouts, the chicken pot pie nuggets, the ox tail have have been truly superb. Not to mention the burger is hands down one of the best I've ever had. It comes with these thick cut imported potato fries, that they fry in truffle oil I believe, that are to die for.

The staff are very friendly and knowledgable. They know there products well.

Only suggestion is the volume of the music blaring out of the cheese shop was a little over-powering and music selection was not really what I would have expected, but maybe quirky is what they're going for all the way around!  Not enough of a distraction to knock off any stars. 

Appy's you don't want to miss...the cheese ""sticks""...they're really kibbles instead of sticks, but the variety was good and breading just enough.  Ooey-gooey goodness.

delicious just a bit dry. All the toppings are very delicious but the type of flat bread they use here is a bit powdery and it dried out my lips.

Perfect sear, red middle, great smokey flavors and JUICY. Perfectly salted. Great steak!

Fries poutine: 5/5

4424818,2014-01-23,8,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"The View Wine Bar epitomizes the very essence of Tivoli Village. It's sophisticated with a modern rustic charm. The view from the window tables is beautiful at night. Take a photo of the view and it looks like you're somewhere on a European vacation.
The tapas menu boasts farm to table ingredients and some served on wooden planks.
My dining experiences at Tivoli Village have been more about experiencing food and flavors, not so much loading up to satisfy a hunger. The common denominator of Tivoli's restaurants is that all of them are pretty and you don't mind sitting and waiting. There's no rush, enjoy the views and appreciate quality over quantity. Even if the food sucks a little.
You hope it's going to be a good experience when a majority of the tapas items look appealing and it's a plus when it lists the ingredients. I like to know what goes into something because I might want to try making it later :)  It didn't take us long to know what we wanted to order.
TUNA TARTARE NACHOS - Light and fresh with hints of citrus, avocado, baby arugula and a touch of lime creme served atop a crispy wonton chip. I could have eaten 4 orders just by myself. I think Summerlin in general has a tuna ration.
AVOCADO BRUSCHETTA - 4 pieces of toast slathered with guacamole and served with lime wedges. It was good, but essentially guacamole with a light lime creme drizzled on.
RISOTTO CAKES - It comes with tomato jam (tasted like chunky ketchup), pesto (delicious), olive tapenade (nice and tangy). The risotto cakes were light and crispy and had a slight citrus flavor that reminded me of eating a cookie.
FRIES POUTINE - Pork belly, cheese and wine gravy with large cut potatoes. This was not very good. The pieces of pork belly tasted more like chewy beef and the wine gravy did not compliment the potatoes or cheddar cheese.
MARY'S FRIED CHICKEN - This was a big disappointment. It appears that Summerlin does not do fried chicken well at all. The chicken was dark meat and not at all crispy, but rather soggy. The best part of this dish was the roasted brussel sprouts and apple slaw with bourbon raisins. I had never tried roasted brussel sprouts and this was WONDERFUL! I don't know if it's supposed to come with the fried chicken or if the chef just added that on but I'm very happy he did. The sprouts were nice and charred with a sweetness that went well with the apple slaw and raisins. I would come back for this dish.
TOMATO SOUP - Meh. Tasted like tangy tomato sauce. No seasoning, very blah.

Service could have been better. The server asked us how everything was, I commented that I didn't care for the soggy chicken and she said they drizzle some kind of oil on it. Why? Isn't fried chicken supposed to be greasy enough? I mentioned that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and the server didn't even ask if we would like to have a birthday dessert. She just handed us the check and walked away.
Overall, I appreciated the different ""farm fresh"" items you don't usually see at a tapas bar, but it's nothing special. The ambiance is what you come here for.

P.S. Watch out for crotchety woman that owns the pet boutique around the corner. She disdainfully reprimanded my wife for calling her doggy a ""he"" and snapped, ""she has a vagina!""...right in front of our daughter. What a freak.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,14,9,3,CqrYeJym7ytJ3PuIQjU5yQ
4442506,2012-12-03,0,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"I want to love this place so much that after poor service the first week they were open I went back. The venue is beautiful and the food is amazing BUT the service left much to be desired. Our server never checked on us. The food is brought out on little plates and we had no room for the next course I had to clear my own table. I had to ask another server for our bill and then brought it to the counter both times. I have been warned by friends not to visit twice but I didn't heed the warning.

The worst part was the two kids singing. They are talented, don't get me wrong, but they are extremely pitchy and the acoustics inside don't lend well to the HIGH, immature voice of the singer. We wanted to relax, have a glass of wine, and nosh on some great food. Instead we ate as fast as we could so we didn't have to listen to the bad Disney version music that literally hurt my ears. Inappropriate entertainment for a place with a wine bar. We didn't shop long either because of the whiny songs that were screamed throughout the building.

It's not a surprise the place is always empty on Sunday's.",pq2yAgrQfvCMZFPxRV6eCg,0,0,1,zBV9xmn4IQ65UeAIKYxDxQ
4451696,2013-07-17,2,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"Come for Happy Hour at the bar area and leave. 

My friends and I decided to check out The View last night for happy hour. Unfortunately they do not serve any food at their happy hour. Draft wines for $2 though, are a steal. However the wines are not of the greatest quality. They also serve Stella Artois (on draft) for $3. AS much as I liked the prices, the service was mediocre. My friends and I waited to pay our bills for a good 10 minutes while the one bar server made cheese boards. She literally was away from all of her bar patrons for a good 5-7 minutes. In bar time - that is a really long time not to be able to talk to the people at your bar and get them more drinks. 

We then were seated in the dining area, which is really nice and open with awesome chairs that made me feel like I could sit there for hours. We also got a pretty awesome spot in front of a window in front of Tivoli's fountain. 

I found their wine menu to be somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, they offer a decent variety, but when I think ""Wine Bar"" I was expecting a booklet, not a page. Also, wines from France were sorely missing. There was only two, one of which you could only order per bottle. California and Washington varietals are center stage here. I ordered the ""dryer"" Riesling for $13, which I thought was decent enough, although I've had better. 

Food - I wanted the 5 Cheese Soup, but was informed they were out, in a hurry, and not really thinking, I ordered the Tomato Soup instead. What I was served was a puddle of tomato soup in a huge bowl. I will honest-to-God say the bowl had 6 spoonfuls of soup in it. At $6 a pop for a sip of soup I found it to be a huge let-down. Be conscious the style here is ""tapas"", small plates for sharing, but really, was I going to share my 6-spoonfuls of soup? Hell no I wanted a bowl of soup!

I also had the ""Green Eggs and Ham"" Carbonara, which was delicious. The sauces were perfect, the addition of the egg was perfect. The crispy pork belly was not crispy. It was a lump of pork, flaccid and not up to par. I wish I had gotten an entire plate, again, I was severely disappointed at the size of my pasta, especially considering I was STILL hungry after I had finished it. I was wishing I had gone to Brio across the street and paid the same exact amount of money and gotten a huge-ass plate of spaghetti.

I like the idea, but I do not like the execution of The View. I will always compare tapas (no matter what they are) to Firefly, and Firefly beats this place out hands down a million times over. Also, Nosh & Swig, a place that also does ""American"" tapas is better than The View with cheaper prices and better quality/quantity of food presentation. 

Service in the dining area was okay, but somewhat awkward. We were given a horrible ""appetizer"" (for free...) that consisted of cold peanuts, a thin slice of radish, a weird dried-out carrot, and what I think was two celery sticks. Mind you, there were three girls sitting at my table, whatever would we want with this weird concoction of ""food""? 

Service - 3/5
Food - 2.5/5
Ambiance - 4/5

I will not make a return trip. There are places with better wine and better food that will not leave me yearning for an Inn N Out burger after my meal.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,14,2,2,E5XcaXpYp63xHixBYatAfA

The name says it all...... ""View and Wine""!!!!
Located in Tivoli Village upstairs, View Wine Bar has a lovely view, great service, great wine, quality appetizer, and small plate meals.
Some of my favorites are: 
Just Fries  (cut and cooked perfectly then topped with parmesan and truffle oil) Yum!!!!
The Triple Angus Cheddar Burger was super good, not over cooked, not under cooked, and the cheddar was really tasty. 
Pan Seared Tuna has never disappointed, it is an absolutely must every time.
I have ordered the Cheese Platter a couple of different times. You can get 3 or 5 different types of cheese. It is ""chef selection"" so the type of cheese varies each time, but it has always been a very nice selection of cheese and usually a good crunchy bread, or cracker with honey or jam that compliments the cheese nicely.
They have really great happy hour specials, double check with them because it does change, but they usually have $2 wine from 5-8PM EVERYDAY!!!!!!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,1,1,4,FtvbwWQk6e4DtiNMy4-COw

We really should have gotten a basket of bread, or at least crackers to go with the cheeses and wine? My friend ordered a flatbread pizza which was great, and also some sort of...cheese grits?

For food we went with the sharing is caring method and had the chicken fingers, shrimp cocktail, fries and quesadillas. Out of these my favorites were the fires and shrimp. The fries had a nice truffle flavor and the portion size was just right. As for the shrimp I thought the flavor was excellent, but the portion size was only four pieces. The quesadilla and chicken were good, but pretty standard. I'd recommend trying some of the other options.

4701582,2013-08-16,9,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"The fiancé and I stopped by for lunch this afternoon and had a wonderful meal! So let's talk atmosphere, gorgeous. I love the light from all the windows, the vintage and rustic furniture, the lighting fixtures, just the whole package. It was completely empty before noon and no one at the host stand or bar, but we were content walking around and getting photos. Anyway, we got a table in one of the windows with big comfy chairs and it was so nice. They have lunch specials (salad and sandwich or sandwich and soup, etc), but we wanted to try their small plates. 

We got six dishes --
Tivoli Wrapped Dates: Soft, lightly sweet dates stuffed with goat cheese and an almond, wrapped in prosciutto. The presentation was beautiful and I love that they cut the round ends of the dates so it sat on a platter. Of course, I had to compare these to Firefly's dates and I'm happy to say that they were equally good in different ways. I like the freshness of this dish (compared to the smokey qualities of Firefly's), however it could use salt or another salty component for more contrast.
Lobster Mac: Generous chunks of lobster meat, whole wheat penne, Parmesan, brandy cream, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. Slightly under-salted, but I liked that it wasn't overwhelming. But $15? Not worth it.
Organic Mushroom Risotto: The dish was prepared well, nice mushrooms. Mushrooms still had bite and the rice had a good consistency. Although, it did seem under-seasoned as well, it was still good.
Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets: These things are amazing. Seriously genius!! Mini little bites of chicken pot pie, not a joke. The batter was so crispy and I love that it was served with freshly shaved Parmesan and lime zest.
Roasted Brussel Sprouts: Roasted in brown butter with Yukon Gold potatoes, Purple potatoes, pumpkin seeds, crushed cashews, golden raisins. Really good. I would have liked the sprouts to be roasted a little longer to rid it of the bitterness. 
Drunken Shrimp: Large shrimp fried in a Guinness batter, served with a mango-jicama slaw, and housemade vodka cocktail sauce. The batter was deliciously crispy, the shrimp was fresh, and I squeezed a little fresh lime juice before dipping it in the perfect cocktail sauce and added the fresh, crispy slaw per bite. Amazing!

Hands down, Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets and Drunken Shrimp are two of the best dishes in my overall dining history. What I like about The View, besides the great design, is that they are innovative with the selection of dishes, which was definitely vital in a market saturated with restaurants serving the ""small plates"" experience. They've taken dining favorites like stuffed dates, fried shrimp and decided to use other ingredients to make it sufficiently different. That's what will bring me back to dine with them again.  Service was wonderful; our server was great and checked in on us when needed. We also enjoyed their soda selection (Virgil Root Beer, Jamaican Ginger Beer). The only downside is the price. For two, our lunch bill was $75 (including tax and 21% tip) - yikes.  Although satisfied with the amount of food we consumed, we could have easily ordered more if we had more time and racked up quite the bill.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,18,13,4,_EkwYpV4fw0oUHU2ShLDTg

Four of us were seated at a community table, with barstools that were too short for the hightop table. Waiter was prompt and courteous, with nice explanation of the specials for the evening...but it deteriorated from there. WIne was served in good order, but the food was another matter. In past visits, the food came out fast, well-prepared, and hot. Tonight, there was a very long delay, then the food trickled out...vegetable plate, delay....then the waiter comes and tells my daughter that the flatbread she ordered is no longer available because the dough is frozen! Really?? At least two problems with that...why didn't you know before a long delay after ordering, and you just told us you use FROZEN dough??  She ordered a salad instead, which still took quite a while to come out.  My Mary's Fried Chicken, which I really enjoyed once before, came out next, and it was just so-so. Our soups came out next, and whereas mine was boiling lava hot, my daughter's was lukewarm. There was another long delay before my wife's burger came out, after having to ask the waiter twice what was taking so long...and not cooked the way she had wanted it done. His only explanation for the delays was that the kitchen was backed up. Even with a number of empty tables???  The worst parts: (1) at no time did the manager come speak with me about the problems and (2) there were apologies but not attempts to make it right with me by offering anything to compensate for the long wait.

Had the chicken pot pie nuggets and have to admit, were just plain good old fashioned comfort food.  Also ordered the burger, which apparently was voted best burger in Vegas, and I may say it does deserve that title.  Meat in the patty could of been seasoned a bit more, but otherwise a delicious burger to which a fried egg was added.  Brussel sprouts had good flavor and sunflower seeds added a nice texture and crunch.  The prosciutto wrapped dates were the only disappointment, Fireflies had that one down and can't be beat.
As the bartender stated, ""a good solid menu,"" and I'd have to agree.  Lots to choose from took a while to select my meal.

Their well vodka is wonderful, they carry Prairie which is an organic vodka, super smooth and went well as a dirty martini, the vodka was recommended by the bartender.

Downfalls, the restaurant is a bit confusing and very open on a warehouse type setting.  Has a cheese shop that appears to be a bar but you can't quite make out if they're connected.  This really is not an intimate restaurant.  It is located on the second floor above a crepe shop and I couldn't tell if they were affiliated either.  The ""view"" would be nicer if it were facing the strip but instead looks down into valet of Tivoli Village, which is not a very busy or exciting view.

The food was great we had the Garden salad to start and it was exactly that.  It had lots of fresh delicious vegetables.  Then we ordered a bottle of wine, for a wine bar in Summerlin I expected the bottle prices to be a lot higher.  We had a bottle of Cabernet for $28, which was the starting price but it was still very good.  We ordered both Steak options I would say the strip was more tender and a better value.  Then for dessert we had the benets and they were amazing the dipping selections for both the steak and the dessert complemented the dishes perfect.

The atmosphere was awesome as well! They have live mellow cover music. The performers said they are their on Sunday's and Tuesday's.
Since I am in real estate I always pay attention to the decor of restaurants to get Ideas for my clients.  They had a very nice feel to it, designs that reminded me of Restoration Hardware techniques.

Oh yeah and ""The View"" it was pretty cool to over look Tivoli Village while we ate.

It was a little hard to find however, since it is in the market above Brio the sign says the Market with the restaurant name on the glass.

This place was recommended to us by Andrea at the Aquae salon at the hotel. We LOVED it. Each of us ordered two small plates and we all sampled tastes from each one. Everything we ate was just delicious. I was most impressed by the chicken pot pie nuggets and the fries poutine. Both were amazing twists on classic US and Canadian (respectfully) dishes. I cannot wait to travel to Las Vegas next, just so I can eat here again. The manager and chef both came out to serve us, which was so nice. The live entertainment was great, just a guy playing the piano. I also loved the atmosphere of the mismatched chairs and decor. So cute. I was fully impressed.

5028803,2012-12-10,3,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"The View Wine Bar and Kitchen 
- A very classy bar with a view of the beautiful fountain, comfortable ambience. Offers good selection of wines, beers and small plates. The service is excellent, price reasonable. There's live entertainment at times.  No happy hour at the main bar.
- Happy Hour (5-7) is offered in its cute, little Cheese Shoppe & Bar (no view) across the corridor less than 20ft away, with half-off drinks.

Yelpy Details: 

One sunny afternoon, I was walking around Tivoli and spotted the Market Place, which attracted my attention, I stepped in out of curiosity.  Inside the front door was a gorgeous staircase leading upstairs. Even though the Market looked unfinished, the sign says there are shops and eatery upstairs. Well, with curiosity and THIRST, I went upstairs. I was pleasantly surprised to see some cute boutique shops open already, especially delighted to see the View Wine Bar and Kitchen open around the corner with a friendly hostess greeting custmers! She told me that they had two sections kitty-corner to each other; one main bar with a view, one charming little cheese shoppe and bar right across the corridor. Happy Hour, 5-7, is available ONLY in the small bar. 

I was too thirsty to wait till 5; the view at the main bar and the pleasant live performance of 2 youngsters were too inviting to pass up, so I took a comfortable seat at the classy bar counter with a direct window view of the plaza fountain, happy hour or not! My friendly and helpful young lady bartender promptly settled me down with a draft Stella ($7), and and the free cheese/vegie appetizer; she went on to introduce me to its menu if small plates and very extensive list of wines!  At the bar there were already 5 other customers; 2 tables nearby were also occupied, all happily applauding the band from time to time.

For the afternoon, I wound up having a delicious BLT Flatbread ($10), 2 Stella ($7 each), and a glass of house cab (Cypress, $6). I made a check-in on Yelp to this establishment, while I was sitting at the bar, and was pleasantly rewarded with a 15%discount!

The band performed in the elegant front corner, where there was a piano. The young singer looked 13 but had a very nice, rich voice of 30; his partner accompanied him with good guitar playing, not bad! That band kept me glued to the bar for an extra 40+min!

The main bar did not offer HH, 
the drinks and small plates are $5-19. Of course, being a wine bar, they offered a large selection of wines from $6-25 a glass. The lady barkeep, Joey, let me sample 2 kinds of Wasatch drafts ($9) and Earthquake Cab ($25/gl). The Wasatch was OK; the Earthquake was outstanding with its mellow, rich, lingering flavor and smooth texture. Joey is very friendly and attentive! All other staff is also quite pleasant and helpful, making one feel welcome! 
[- See pics of menu]

HAPPY HOUR
- Its ""Cheese Shoppe"" is a very cute, cozy bar, which offers food and drinks, and cheese, of course! HH is 5-7pm, with half off drinks. That bar has NO view, however, other than the main bar. One can hear and see the live entertainment here, also. When I left the main bar around 5:30, the small bar was almost full.

The Market Place is handicapped friendly, it has an elevator hidden in a corner beyond the grand stairwell.

Note to Management: There should be a TV facing the bar counter, so customers do not have to turn their necks!

BTW, I was told that the bars and the entire Market building are owned by Chef John Church, who worked with Ramsey and survived!

I ordered one of the specials, a fish and chips with thai sweet chili sauce. Fish itself was fresh but the batter could have used another minute to get a bit more crisp. Chips were well seasoned, but I expected ""chips"" as in fries, not as in kettle potato chips. 

Service was alright. My water could have used some refill attention, so I just conserved the 2nd glass a bit better since I didn't know if I would get another. We had to transfer tables because our original one had the AC pipe dripping a little.

Not in love with the food or wine selection but the ambiance is pretty impressive. 2nd floor view of Tivoli Village is A+ (especially at night) and I love that they have live entertainment. The man sings and plays the sax pretty well. What's to hate about that!?

I ordered the Tuna Tartare Nachos ($15). It was tasty and served with crispy chips. It was a fine preparation of tuna tartare. Nothing special, fancy, or innovative but tasty. My friend ordered the  Grilled Cheese ($10). This was tasty but incredibly rich. You really need the right wine pairing to cut through all the fat. This dish should definitely be shared. I didn't want more than half the sandwich. I sampled the Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets ($11) and the fries and they were both tasty. What can go wrong with fries? 

Everything was tasty and edible but I wasn't wowed by the food. Our server handled our large group pretty well. He was quick on the drink/water refills and was friendly enough. This is a great place to come for socializing but I wouldn't make it a food/drink destination.

5102417,2014-10-21,1,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"I've been here a couple of other times just for appetizers and wine. A group of us came here for dinner last night. 

I was very pleased with the food here. Everything we had was excellent! For the price, I think it's worth it. The wine is super expensive though, which it's marked up triple in some cases if not quadruple. 

We had -

Tuna Tartare Nachos - probably the best tuna tartare I've had in town. The tuna was very fresh and the sauce was excellent with a good spice to it.
5 Cheese - All of them were good, but the goat cheese was my favorite. 
Baby Wedge - excellent blue cheese dressing. There's only one other place where I love the dressing, and this has topped my list. 
Tivoli Wrapped Dates - these were not my favorite, but they were still good. They were wrapped with proscuitto and they were very soft. I guess I prefer mine more with a crunch to them. 
Triple Angus Cheddar Burger - This was the mother of them all. They were voted for the best burger in Vegas, and I can see why. Even though it's not the best I've had in town, it was still pretty freaking awesome. We got every extra you could add and it was a mess. Hard to eat, but it was worth getting messy over. 

The service - we were here with a large party and this always seems to pose as an issue at any restaurant I've been to. The service just seems to be lacking and we kept having to ask for more drinks, waiting on a lot of the food and this place was really slow. There was only 4 other tables when we got here at 7pm. We didn't leave until 10pm. Partially because we were just hanging out and the other reason because it took a long time to get a lot of our stuff. I definitely think they were way understaffed, but the reservation was made days prior. The staff was super nice, though. They just seemed stressed. 

It was also weird because we had our own table in the back, but there was no music back there...only a silent TV playing ballet. That made a weird impression.

Overall, I definitely recommend this place for the food. Everything else deserves 3 stars at this point, but the food was so good, it'll get an extra star for now. I'm looking forward to going back with a much smaller group next time...",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,6,4,4,bYvtYhDDRUfSFTy-rPQVVQ
5121090,2012-11-22,2,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"This review is going to be weird because i don't like wine as a general rule. I don't know if it is a result of sneaking a sip as a kid and hating it or maybe I'm just not designed to like it...whatever the reason...yuck.

Now, that said, I know for a fact that this happens to other people all the time. One contingent drinks wine all the time, the other...not so much. But you gotta go endure the trendy wine bar in order to be social and so...I'm a demographic that goes to these places even though I don't dig rotten grape juice. So the valuable advice I am about to share is useful in a way.

First, the decor - 
Classy! it's planted on the side of a ...boutique mall I guess you'd call it. but the light fixtures, furniture, view (hence the name) are all very nice. Bring a date, get him/her drunk and you're doing well.

Food - 
We ordered a few small plates and they were really good, small is very accurate but y'know, it's a wine bar. It's not like you're going to order a bucket of wings or something. Classy little plates of tasty stuff to go along with your booze. By the way, there is a little candy place around the corner that has chocolate... I have learned that chocolate and wine are a good thing.

Wine - 
There is no way I'm going to sound like i know what I'm talking about here. I did see a bunch of people with wine flights which, for my fellow noobs are little glasses of like 3-4 wines that you can sample. What i did try was a wine called Beaujolais nouveau (Thanks wikipedia!) This stuff didn't taste like the putrid swill most wine tastes like. I actually got pretty buzzed off this stuff.

TIP: Non wine drinkers.... we have been missing out. Liquor hits you too hard and beer makes you feel all full and bloated... wine drunk is my new favorite kind of drunk. Learn to like it!

Service - 
These people could not be nicer! Server was a sweetheart, the Sommelier (wine expert) was such a passionate guy about wine. I think he is from Israel or France or both. Such a nice guy, for real. he'll be more than happy to tell you about what you're drinking.

Pricing - 
It's Vegas, it's wine.... it ain't cheap. That said, it wasn't CRAZY.

So overall, I'm going to continue trying to like red wine for the mellow wine buzz. The wife will be ecstatic to have a drinking partner if the plan works... wish me luck!

I'm so glad my friend had been here before, because I don't think I would ever have wandered up to The View Wine Bar & Kitchen at Tivoli Village on my own. It was very quiet on a Tuesday at lunch and I sure hope for their sake that it gets busier at other times. (That goes doubly for all the adorable shops on the same level!) 

Our waitress Ashlee was amazing! Very friendly, attentive, and completely welcoming to my 5-month old baby boy who was along for girls' lunch - even though I would't guess The View to be kid-friendly. Ashlee also gave great recommendations when we asked! 

Chicken pot pie nuggets were great to share and my friend really enjoyed the lobster mac. The tomato soup was pretty decent and the mushroom risotto was VERY YUM. Great texture and taste and just ""gourmeted-up"" enough to make it somewhat of a stand-out:)

The prices were ok but would have been a better fit on the strip, especially considering the portions. In such a relatively tucked-away location in Tivoli it seemed too expensive.

He tried to be nice and he joked around with my son who liked him but I felt he was insincere.

Wow, what a great recommendation.  In fact, the cheese plate was excellent and we enjoyed it very much.

So my boyfriend asked for the Stella and guess what they don't have any because they ran out yet across the bar they had it. So he asked if he could do another beer for a happy hour price and she said no. I didn't mind the beer but when we ordered the cheese. My bf saw that they were coming from tupperware and the service size was definitely less than an ounce so we decided to leave and right when we decided to leave and cancel our cheese order.

Farmer's Market Salad
Nino's Meatballs
Mushroom Flatbread

The food is listed in order of preference. The lobster mac was small (perhaps the size of a generous cup) but soooo flavorful. I thought it could have used some more lobster, especially for the price. 

The salad is very large, with about four servings. Nothing exciting, just mixed lettuce, carrots, radish, and red onion, but I can appreciate a salad's place at the table. The food runner apologized for dropping one (of two) crouton and asked if we wanted him to bring us one. I think that's a predicament to put the customer in (you want me to request that you walk back to the kitchen to bring me one crouton? I would never); you either don't acknowledge it, or better yet, you return with a small plate of more croutons. 

The meatballs are hot and flavorful, served with small pieces of crustini and your choice between pesto or chutney. 

The flatbread was not enjoyable. It was dry and lacked any true mushroom flavor (think of small, dry shreds of mushroom?), and was incredibly overwhelmed by the cheese. 

I appreciate the style and atmosphere of The View and will certainly come back again, but perhaps they could fine-tune some items and service.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,1,1,3,pPrfot92AAPeFveTUMJ4Rw

I met up with a friend here for late lunch and drinks. I like the ambience.  Some of the menu items look awfully familiar. Oxtail croquettes and chicken pot pie nuggets seem Rx Boiler Room-ish to me. We got lucky we got here during happy hour. $2 mimosas, bellinis and bloody Mary's. Of course, we had glasses upon glasses of all 3 HH drinks. The hostess seemed to have been partaking in happy hour as well - kinda loopy if you ask me. She didn't give us a menu and she asked us if we were ready to order. Uh...

Tivoli Wrapped Dates:
Dates with goat cheese wrapped with prosciutto. I love dates, goat cheese and prosciutto...but put them altogether and it seems wrong. Maybe if they rendered the prosciutto and then put crumbles of goat cheese it would've been better. 3/5

Oxtail Croquettes:
Meaty, tasty and crispy. I like this version better than RxBR's. 5/5

Fries Poutine:
Cheddar, red wine gravy and crisp pork belly. It's a bit different from the Canadian version - this version is better. The ones I've had in Montreal had cheese curds and gravy. The pork belly was a nice touch. The cheese is melted over the fries and the gravy was just sitting at the bottom...so eat this quick before the fries disintegrates in the gravy. 5/5

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets:
Again, this is better than the RxBR version. Meatier and better tasting. 5/5

5529428,2013-01-07,7,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"The original plan was to grab a drink since we had dinner reservations later at a place that rhymed with ""Sonny Halt"".  But the wine and atmosphere was so cool and unVegas plus the menu looked so damn tempting and inviting that we just said screw it and settled in for dinner here. The live music trio they had performing was great and really enhanced the dining.

My favorite dish by far was the lamb shoulder.  It was slow cooked, very tender and the yogurt sauce that accompanied it was perfect.  The risotto was decent.  We weren't that into the grilled cheese.  Even though it was quite different than the average grilled cheese with brie, honey and walnuts, I didn't feel it justified the $7 price.  The 5 onion soup was above average.  Our bartender strongly recommended the cobbler for dessert and it was great.  

There are a lot of other things we definitely want to try that sounded scrumptious like chicken pot pie nuggets and the pork belly flatbread.  The menu they have posted online is dated as there's more to choose from than what's posted.  

I didn't really like how the dining tables were set up.  Neighboring tables were very, very close to one another.  It's as if you were dining with them.  They have the space to open it up a little more.  We chose the bar which was definitely better for couples.  So come as 2 at the bar or 5+ so you can take up a whole table section.  

They also have a happy hour at their wine and cheese bar from 5pm-8pm which includes $2 glasses of wine among other things.  I actually have a reason to go to Tivoli Village now!  Wow!  That only took a year and a half :)",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,18,12,4,DVOsGsirWb42a2mzYycZRQ

5628751,2012-10-26,12,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"To be fair the food was really good, however guys the portions are so small that you will need to spend about $50 to almost feel like you had a meal. 

The cause for concern with this place is the service. If your going to be a wine bar at least know a little bit about the selection your offering and ensure my glass stays full. We waited at least 15 minutes after we finished our first glass before our ""waiter"" asked if we would like another. We then waited seemingly forever to pay our tab and I actually had to walk over and hand the book to the waiter and manager at the register.  

The jazz major kid they had playing Piano and Guitar was the only thing that kept the evening from being a total disaster. He was really good and talented and the only reason that kept me from choking the waitstaff.",GFv75j9zT8D7WqTQQbs87A,13,6,1,dVA_QeDLHXTTaJLbXUsH-w
5675750,2013-05-11,1,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"After discovering that the game store in Tivoli Village was closed (apparently you can shop them online though) . The Wine Bar seemed to be the next best bet. With one of my best pals fully supporting this decision, we grabbed a seat at the bar and settled in for what ended up being a really long afternoon of drinking!

We ordered and amazing charcuterie plate and 5 cheese plate. They complemented each other perfectly. Also got the pot pie bites and grilled cheese sandwiches. DELICIOUS! 

They have a great wine selection, by the glass and bottle. We downed 3 bottles and spent about 5 hours parked at the bar. The service was excellent, and the place was immaculate.  It has an industrial but elegant feel with wine bottles incorporated into the design.

I must say for a bar named ""the view"" I don't consider it an amazing view to watch cars pull in and out of Valet. Well, maybe it's amazing if you're in to high end vehicles. 

And speaking of high end, the prices are a little on the high side for the small shared plates.

5734009,2013-10-07,1,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"Let me start by saying we came on a Saturday night during happy hour. First time here so we walked to the host stand and were promptly seated. Decor and ambiance really are great, the restaurant was designed very well. I would like to mention even though we came during happy hour there was no mention of it being in the cheese room only, we came to find that out later once already sat. Since we were already comfortable we decided we can try the happy hour next time and started with a bottle of wine. We also tried the following dishes, 

Angus burger w/ truffle fries- amazing

5 tasting cheese plate- also very good

Tuna tartare nachos - delicious, yet very small, even for a tapa.

Drunken shrimp- colossal size shrimp cooked with vodka, and a Guinness infused sauce. I could have passed on these, extremely battered.

Dessert was an Apple and peach cobbler, this was average, I think I would have rather had the beignets.

All in all it was a nice dining experience, the reason for the three stars is partially because how the servers demeanor changed once it came to paying the bill. Also, when we did use the 10% check-in offer it was only applied to the food, not the alcohol. To me I really didn't care, but I do think others might so it may be in their interest to add a discrepancy on the check in discount.

First impression was great, leaving impression was so-so.",iBW55099_0_zNQS15L3tYA,2,1,3,Eq15bZLYkdCElmFpRKnQPA

Our server Oliver was attentive and worked hard to ensure we had everything we wanted.  He did a nice job for only just beginning and the View just recently opening.  We had an opportunity to meet Executive Chef Johnny Church, cheese shop manager and other key folks that make the View Wine Bar special unique.

Furthermore, the price point was excellent, completely beat our expectations and agree with the experience they are looking to create...this is my neighborhood wine bar!",Q6oPcjwZgHShYbsu06Vq9Q,0,0,5,srBAlO5Z5wW1U1zXJLB3Ow

The decor and view is lovely. It's situated on the 2nd floor of Tivoli and overlooks the central fountain, which is really nice.  And the decor is very shabby chic. But I made the grave mistake of ordering chicken fingers, which were dry, not fried properly (crusting outside was soggy) and came with 5 small strips and 3 pieces of carrots... :( I remained hungry after that meal. But my friend ordered a salad that looked pretty decent? Our bartender was okay - kinda strange personality and slow, but nice enough. 

Tip: daily happy hour form 1pm-3pm with $2 mimosas/bellinis/bloody mary. The mimosa is mostly champagne with a splash of juice!",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,4,1,3,B6sik1kTxrJP6U9TiNWRbQ

5973538,2013-04-29,1,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,"I've come here twice now- for wine and cheese and for lunch.  And I love the atmosphere.  Located on the 2nd floor of The Market in Tivoli Village, it is a nice open loft like space with high ceilings and sleek modern urban decor, but with a cozy feeling at the same time.  The wine bottle lighting over the bar is a cute little detail. 

My first experience was wine, cheese, and charcuterie with a large group of friends.  These are probably my 4 favorite things in the world, so you can't go wrong with this combo.  Everything was delicious, and the atmosphere was perfect for stimulating conversation as well.   My second visit was for lunch and my husband and I sat by the window with a VIEW of the Tivoli Village rotunda. Because they dishes are tapas style,  we shared 4 dishes:
* pork and polenta -  this was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  
* roasted brussel sprouts - I love the fact that the veggies are from the local Farmer's market, but i was not a fan of the way these were prepared.  And I am a brussel sprouts lover.  These were more bitter rather than highlighting the deep nutty flavors.  
* lobster mac - the lobster was cooked perfectly and the parmesan and brandy cream sauce was the perfect accompaniment. 
* fries poutine - oxtail, cheddar, and red wine gravy.  My husband enjoyed it, I thought it was just OK, but that may be because I was completely carb'd out.  
The thing I love about tapas/shared plates is that there is something for everyone, and there is the opportunity to try many different things.  

Service was a bit slow, but very friendly.  There were 3 tables of diners and 1 at the bar, and only 1 server/ bartender/ hostess. She was working very hard and was very apologetic when I had to repeatedly attempt to grab her attention just for a water refill.  The price is very reasonable (especially with the Yelp check-in offer).  There are many other dishes I look forward to trying, and because of the atmosphere- I will be back. I definitely want to check out their happy hour and live music. Tivoli Village is part of my neighborhood, and I really want to see it thrive.  Hopefully, the View Wine Bar & Kitchen and the other boutiques in The Market will help.

You do need to order food to enjoy the Happy Hour, which is no biggy because... why wouldn't you want cheese with your wine! Sometimes it's busy at Happy Hour and you have to wait your turn, but it's worth it! Always good conversation with others and the Bartender. 

The only time it was a slightly unpleasant experience was when we decided to try their lunch menu... they place was empty but yet we had to wait an extended period of time for our order to be taken... other than that, this place has always been a very pleasant experience!!
