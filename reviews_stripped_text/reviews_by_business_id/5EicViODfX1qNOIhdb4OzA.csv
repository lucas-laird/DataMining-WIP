We took our out-of-town friend for dinner recently; and were very satisfied w/ the food & Service. We tried the Tonkatsu ramen, pork katsu curry with rice, a variety of yakitori, gyoza, and takoyaki, all of which were delicious & fresh. 

I am definitely going to return in the near future. The only constructive criticism I have is the cooking smell in the restaurant due to open kitchen design. Maybe I'll order take-out next time to bypass the smell. :)",JdmOsiCK_bJIip9EeUZoMg,2,0,5,DfKt8_rncNiDf831VTEa8Q

Incredible ordering experience, oddly enough a commodity, got there and the staff greeted and brought me food right away, clean very comfortable space. 

The salmon and yellowtail nigiri were thick pieces of super fresh fish. Lemon salmon roll was really good as well, especially for someone who is pretty picky about their crab flavor.

We ordered the pork belly yakitori, tuna poke, snapper carpaccio, and tonkatsu ramen. 

This resto has some very solid choices. The fish quality here is great. I loved the freshness of the snapper and the tuna. 


The ramen was rich and came with some tender pork slices. The broth was so good I slurped it all up! The soft boiled egg was nice and creamy. 


And last but not least, the pork belly yakitori was so delicious. It melted in my mouth. 


Definitely would come back when I visit Vegas again!",vWvzTNcWzGUQaczDJwtaNg,2,1,5,pgv4T0vdXkwytESmIuloQw

Last time I was there, they're still in the process of getting their alcohol license. So no beer in the meantime.

Other than that, the food is really good. Their Yakitori is tasty and their appetizers have good prices and portions. And the place is in Summerlin too. If you want a good sit-down Japanese place, you got it here.",NWJYydOUPmL5it7Dmz43qg,2,0,4,QUJH6-inmwypspxcRmJhrA

1821391,2018-04-16,1,5EicViODfX1qNOIhdb4OzA,"Nice new spot. I originally came here to try the ramen and ended up also getting a Tiger Roll. Staff are super nice. 

Ramen was small in portion. Smaller than I am used to at other establishments. The Tonkatsu ramen comes with half an egg, and 2 pieces of Chashu. The egg was yummy. Wish they gave you a whole egg though. Chashu was tasty but not as delicate as other places. The broth was just okay. I'm used to a Tonkatsu broth being thick and fatty/flavorful. While it tasted good for American tatse buds this white-wish-she-was-born-Japanese girl perfers a more traditional broth.

The tiger roll surprised me when it came out as it had a mayo/secret sauce on it which I am not used to. I'm not a mayo type of girl. But it was really good anyhow. 

Chef offered me a sample of a seared fish but I had to decline due to personal preferences. We even got to talking about other sushi chefs he knows in town that the owner speaks highly of. 

Defiantly recommend this place if you live in the area. I do not but I'm not against coming back and trying it again.",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,1,0,4,Pmdwi--Pji1xuKCFPb1Rbw

I don't know where the high ratings on this garbage place is coming from. We ordered our food it came out at different times one kid ate then the other then my wife then me but before anything even started coming out it took about 40 minutes or so. It wasn't even that busy like not busy at all. I don't even know what the hell to say about this place beside the food was good and it has some sorry ass service. It also took another 20 minutes to get my damn card back after the lady who I'm assuming is the owner took my payment. What a waste of time.

We started with salmon Skin salad (yummy) & a spread of skewers Chicken Skin -nice & crispy, chicken liver with sauce, pork belly was a tad dry, chicken gizzard, eggplant, kuroboto sausages these were all great! We also ordered the Chirashi Don- fish tasted fresh the rice was a little soggy and undercooked. The Signature roll was great  They don't have a liquor license yet tho.  My husband wanted beer with his yakitori the server said they will get it in July. All in all this place was great just a few tweaks and they will be a perfect 5!

She told me how fresh the fish are, how good the teriyaki and the yakitori are, how friendly the staffs and chefs are, how quickly the services are, and how satisfied she was when she came here last time she was in Vegas. 

So, what else can i say? I was sold and decided to give this place a try. I came in and made to go order. The place is really clean and has an inviting vibe to it. I looked at the menu and got Teriyaki, Yakitori and sushi. My order was ready and done within 15 mins. I was pretty surprised on how fast the service was. My food
was made fresh and right in front of my eyes. 
Everything that my friend said did not fall short. I did not have to turn in to a CRAZY HANGRY woman that day. I was hungry, got my food, left, ate some good food and VERY SATISFIED! :) 

I ordered: Salmon Teriyaki, Bacon Scallop Yakitori, Yellowtail Lover Sushi, and Ultimate Umezono Sushi

We had skewers: gizzard, heart, okura wrapped in bacon, chicken skin. The tempura udon and the ultimate umezono roll were all good. You have to also try the hamachi (yellowtail) collar. It is very limited in quantity so get it while you can.",s54yBK_VgftacvqLBRyRPw,0,0,5,rnQ2SH0_B-6HJdlq4VkCsQ

I don't need to finish my meal to begin saying that this place is hands down amazing. 
Quality. Quality. Quality. 
I was skeptical at first seeing that it is new. 
But the reviews don't lie. 
The fish is fresh, the ramen is top notch, and the service is good too. 
I've never seen my girlfriend go this crazy over how amazing she thinks the food is. 
The ramen beat her favorite ramen spot (monta)
The chashu in the ramen is grilled to perfection. 
There's so many good things I can say about this place. 
The only downfall is, it's in a random spot. And I wish it was closer to us! 
But wow. 
This place is one to try. And one to go out of your way for. 
Yes. 
Hands down. Coming back. Yes please. 
With how great this place, I hope their popularity doesn't take down the quality. Cause oh man. So good. 
I'm not even making sense. 
Alright. Here's some photos",l5Y0xliDOiP1ZAV2dLj9sg,4,1,5,Rfdf_SSBFZOcjHsB65jkjQ

The service is horrible! It took an hour before we got all our food. I came out of this place still hungry and sooo disappointed! Never going back.

5492533,2018-05-14,3,5EicViODfX1qNOIhdb4OzA,"New Japanese place closer to Summerlin....yay!  Our go to izakaya is usually Kyara but this place definitely comes close with quality food for a reasonable price.  Legit takoyaki is usually a benchmark for the rest of the food for us.  The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and the octopus was cooked perfectly inside. I hate soggy takoyaki. Our 2 year old devoured two of these on her own and we ended up adding another order. The takoyaki is also a generous size and comparable to the quality at Kyara, Jinya, and Monzo.  I was a little skeptical about the ramen, someone compared it to Monta....  While not exactly Monta quality, it was really good given this place is not noted to be a ramen spot.  The chashu was tender and flavorful, as well as the broth.  We also tried the chicken gizzard, chicken skin, ribeye, kurobuta sausage, and pork belly yakitori.  The skewers were decent but not the best in town...but I also said this about Kyara when they first opened, so always room to improve.  The skewers were a tad too oily and the chicken skin was still chewy and not crispy. The gizzard was done well and you can never go wrong with kurobuta sausage. We also tried the mango salmon ceviche, this was very light and refreshing.  Maybe I'm use to other places serving ceviche with some sort of chips, it was missing a crunchy element for me.  The place is relatively small but we will definitely be back to try more of the items.  If you work around here, I noticed they have a lunch menu that is really reasonably priced as well.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,3,3,4,lfZH_BH_JDl77aAuFZYd7Q
5529580,2018-05-29,45,5EicViODfX1qNOIhdb4OzA,"There is some terrific value to be had at the newest neighborhood Japanese restaurant!  They do a good job covering all the izakaya bases and I was pleasantly surprised.  

Right off the bat, order the yakitori before deciding on the rest of the meal.  They take a bit of time and the skewers arrive at the table kind of haphazardly.  Standouts were bacon scallop with salt ($2.50), pork belly with sauce ($2.25) and chicken skin with salt ($2.25), the latter not being for everyone (or anyone else at the table), but damn good. 

Although they offer many popular LV AYCE type sushi rolls, the best bet would be the ""Sashimi Combo"", which features 18 pretty thick cuts at $29.95 (tuna, salmon, tuna tataki, octopus, scallop and yellowtail) or if it's just two people, share the ""Chirashi Don"" with 12 pieces of sashimi on sushi rice.  Both of these beat the heck out of anything with imitation crab or spicy fish.    
         
The ""Hamachi Kama"" was my favorite item of the night.  At only $8.95, it was everything I had hoped for with a delightfully crisp outer skin and juicy, meaty center.  This should be ordered pretty soon as well since there is limited supply of these per day.  They did run out of ""Salmon Kama"", but more than made up for it with stellar pieces of grilled salmon belly instead.

Lunch specials and ramen look interesting and will be items I'll definitely try soon.  I also can't wait until they get a liquor license for a more complete meal.
