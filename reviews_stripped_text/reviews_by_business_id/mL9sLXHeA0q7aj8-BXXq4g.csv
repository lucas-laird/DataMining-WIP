Anyways, everything else is like any other McDonald's.",97PNvXEJunRS9O8rtkg5Ag,0,0,4,5PoA5XA23ZZ0rpy07VRHhQ

Along with other great deals on food. app wants a lot of info from your phone though and takes up 100mb. The app actually works at this Mcdonald's unlike many others it never seems to connect. But I've always give me the deal anyway at other . parking is limited at the store.,PqxJ-JmhcnMUSf3atMF0vg,0,0,4,c0yV8mgjjiBBeQTi9WZsSw

On the other hand, good customer service in general.",IbKtPlqcX40OErKNy1HhQw,0,0,2,UxKiREiwceL4XjUJTKWCwg
2943701,2017-09-10,0,mL9sLXHeA0q7aj8-BXXq4g,"Not only are they rude, but they are inefficient and always get the entire order wrong. I worked at McDonald's (different location) for a year and I know how the restaurant works. It's not that hard to provide quality customer service and get your orders don't correctly! I always have to go back for missed food and sauce whenever I go to this location! And it isn't much better than the other one close to me. It's always a fairly busy location based on wheee it's at and not quality whatsoever for the amount of traffic it gets.",AN0pN-i4NITZYtPKIr5vXQ,0,0,1,48UQixZuPfQOz1XKOb9HeQ

The drive through is almost always realllllly backed up, so that's annoying. But the inside is usually quick and clean, and the food is pretty average. I don't like the location, but this is pretty much what you get in East Las Vegas. Update: Came here for breakfast the other morning and they were out of.... guess......

5291610,2016-03-08,0,mL9sLXHeA0q7aj8-BXXq4g,So I came here about 15 minutes ago and literally was in line for a good 5 min due to there being 3 cars in front once it's my turn I wait about 30 seconds and I have a lady take my order who by the looks of it couldn't here. She was very direct and so was I. Usually I hear the how are you doing what can I get for you tonight but I get its quite busy. So I said my order and had to repeat myself a couple times. She gave me my total and proceeded to the second window. By the time I turned the corner the first two cars were gone there was only this annoying black Chrysler whom the whole time was going slow and they didn't have a big order as I saw earlier on the screen before pulling up to give mine so I have no idea why it took them so long to give them their order. Finally after waiting for what felt forever there was a guy and an older lady whom I assume was the one who couldn't punch in a simple order. Anyway the guy took my card didn't ask for ID as I was reading when I pulled up. Like if you are going to have a sign go through with it and be consistent. Not that I think a person would really steal a card and go straight to McDonald's but I digress. He gave me my two bags and two cones literally without a word or eye contact like cmon are you that upset at your lousy yet easy job. It wouldn't kill you to say have a good night thank you. I said thank you and guess what no response. Poorest customer service I've ever seen and it's at night like around 11:15 how could you possibly be so busy you can't say thank you. This location is closer than the one on Boulder highway when you need a bad late night snack but never again this place has not one good decent employee during this visit. Who ever that guy was on duty tonight needs to get some customer service training and the lady needs new ears or a new headset.,EVzpYvuyhBPb9u2sS-YJeg,0,0,1,p-FNVWKTTFd8lfAJhM4QeQ
