I have stayed almost everywhere in Vegas.This time we had decided to get a Suite in The Palazzo, hadn't stayed there before so hey why not.  The suite was exceptionally nice, with a sunken in living room with sectional, perfect view of pools, the beds were amazingly comfortable with plenty of pillows, bathroom was large and spacious had plenty of room to get ready (girls trip- 4 of us). The elevator was near by and literally drops you right near the center of the casino, so no need to walk miles(in heels) to this wing or that wing. We had brunch downstairs at LAVO! Another 5 star breakfast! Overall loved my stay there, the d√©cor is also very nice, staff is friendly and helpful. I will stay here again!",pIEe6Tm08iaekJa4LYdJqw,0,0,5,1b0Qp-R2YCQrQbAU4tZUYA
