19395,2015-12-24,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"All of the food was great, but they could really make some improvements when it comes to their service. I went there last night for dinner with my friends. Host was nice and greeted us at the door. It was a about a 15 minute wait before we got sat. The bar was completely empty around 7 pm. When I asked her if we could just sit at the bar since we were all doing AYCE, she told us that the entire bar area was reserved for a big party. That party didn't even show up until a little past 9. On the floor, there were three waitresses tending to all the tables at once. After one of them came to greet us and take our drink orders, another one came right after. Being a waitress myself, I know that most restaurants have their waitresses divide up their tables into sections. One of the first things I ordered was the soft shell crab tempura. After about 20 mins, I asked our waitress if the kitchen had possibly forgotten my order and she said it takes longer to make and that it would be ready soon. Ok, understandable. But after another 25-30 mins, it still had not come out yet. When I asked another waitress who took our order, she said that she would check on it. It didn't come out until we were pretty much full and about ready to order dessert. So I know they definitely forgot to ring it in. Also, it took forever to get refills on our waters. And after our waitress came to take our sushi orders again, she only took mine then left immediately after - without even looking at my other friends and asking if they wanted anything else. Overall, food was great like I said, but they really need to step up their game on service, especially on a semi-busy night like last night. Maybe three waitresses on the floor isn't quite enough?",tWmQoDhFxBrJ6zRYc4ajrg,1,0,3,G71qCQ0uqj6zIQEqDxfJ6A

You can order as much as you want. Not limited to one order per person like a few of their other items like the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi and other sashimi dishes. 
The quality of fish is not going to measure up to Nobu, Katsuya, or barMASA. Obviously! It's All You Can Eat. The Rock & Roll Roll is great has no rice and it's wrapped in cucumber instead of the usual nori on rolls. Inside Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, avocado, sprout & crab with yuzu ponzu sauce. They offer a lot of dishes that doesn't have rice so you don't get stuffed after only a few dishes. You can definitely grub out here. The service might be a bit slow sometimes which I deducted 1 star for. All together a good place.",0t0mlWEXNf_ScaKmZG-Oig,0,0,4,RdI11ETiuIJBZT-EP-lwPw
53421,2015-06-07,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"I really don't understand why I continue to come here but I guess it's only because my friend was treating me and my boyfriend out to eat. But EVERY SINGLE time I come here the service NEVER fails to disappoint me. The only good part ( as far as service ) was that we got seated right away...then it all went down hill. It took a while to get our drink order in and when we did, we didn't get the waters that we had asked for. After we got our drinks we waited for about 15 minutes, and no I am NOT exaggerating, to get our order in. When our server finally acknowledged us he said ""oh I'm sorry I thought the other server took youro order already..."" We got our food in a timely matter, then came our dessert, which he had forgotten to bring some out. After that we just gave up. We even ended up not tipping, which I am extremely ashamed of since I work in the hospitality business. There was even a couple beside us that got up and left, didn't even pay for the drinks. 

I saw only two servers working but even with those to two servers you should still be able to give AT LEAST decent service... Because it WAS not busy at all ( I will leave a picture to prove it ). And if that is them being ""busy"" then they should consider hiring more people. I really do not like to bad mouth anybody but this place NEVER fails to give bad service, the servers are nice though I'll give them that. Service just flat out sucks. No organization whatsoever. 

As for the food I'd give them a B-. Buttered scallops were tasty and were my favorite, rolls are average not ztoo many options, but they do have a wide range of tapas. I also like that they have ice cream tempura for dessert...",q6XOqCSxGJehCZIC6cvxjw,0,0,1,0OmcD-Cb8ZEUfXDpGOCjEA

85829,2014-10-11,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"I had read a lot of the other reviews and was worried about the service.  It turned out that all of those worries were unfounded as the service was great.  I don't eat sushi, however I have been to several ayce sushi places because all of my friends love sushi and I can always find some things to eat at those type of places due to their other Japanese non-sushi offerings.

I was looking forward to trying doh because of their extensive tapas menu.  It turns out they definitely have many more options for me then other ayce sushi places.  I enjoyed the usual appetizers, such as the shrimp tempura, gyoza, and skewers.  I also liked the Korean ramen bowl.  Unfortunately I was disappointed in the Kalbi, which wasn't hot and not cooked as much as I would like, and the pork belly, which was bland, and too fatty.

My friend who I went with, and has eaten there several times, said the sushi wasn't as good as usual, but had raved previously about the food there.   Overall I would consider trying again, because of the big selection and good service, and the fact that my friend had said the kalbi is usually a lot better.",ehZNBiB9sPyuTQyc80J9bw,0,0,3,Vv3MCtilTZvmxI6bt7c99g

158254,2015-12-22,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"12/21/15 Christmas date with my boyfriend with a la carte orders

Spicy tuna rolls- 3.5/5
My boyfriend ordered these since I'm not a big fan of sushi. Based on what he says, 'good but not enough.' When I asked him what about it wasn't enough, he simply said that there was too little rice and not enough filling. One order came with 8 pieces.

Calamari Tempura- 4/5 
Nice and warm. I really like the sauce with the tempura. Minus one cause according to my BF, it lacks salt.

Bulgogi- 4/5 I really enjoyed this one. My boyfriend said it was personally 4 stars for him because it was a bit soggy, but I think this tapas did have a lot of flavor, a bit of a kick, although it looked a little dry at first.

Shrimp skewers- 3.5/5 for us both. He thought it was too greasy but too dry. I personally love shrimp but there wasn't anything special about this one.

Pork Katsu- 2/5
Breading was falling off for one. At some point one whole side came off of my Katsu :( And it was really dry. But to be fair, the sauce was super good despite that and made it a lot better. 

Miso soup - 4/5 not salty enough for the boyfriend but he does love miso soup so 4/5 it is. And it took the looooongest time to come out. 

Service - 1/5 
okay to be brutally honest, the service sucked. The waitresses spoke too quietly, if at all and the other waiter who initially took our orders completely ignored us altogether. Hardly anyone checked on us except maybe once or twice while they were grabbing our dirty dishes. And our miso soup ... Never came until he asked waitress 10 minutes after we finished the rest of our food?  Also while ordering, the waiter was not polite at all. We literally had to ask ourselves to get our check after 10 minutes finishing everything. Like what's with that?

TLDR; Food was decent for the price we paid but as food servers ourselves, service needs to definitely be reevaluated.. My boyfriend outright refused to tip just for how bad the service was and he doesn't want to go back.",KLJ7SypKNaB1G3xhLjh2Dw,2,0,2,IUOtrt-zbpISl6aGZGKTTw
169297,2014-01-03,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"Not impressed at all. Was fiending for sushi and one of my friends suggested Doh because it was a new restaurant she wanted to try out. The restaurant is nice, open, and clean. The AYCE sushi price is about the same as most others in town and their sushi is okay. Not horrible, but not great either. 

Service is pretty nice, but a bit awkward and  not very knowledgeable. My friend asked for a Dr. Pepper when one of the servers took our drink orders. She left and came back to tell us they didn't have any Dr. Pepper. So my friend asked for a Pibb (she had to go and check to see if they had that as well). When she came back she suggested a ginger ale...because it is the most obvious substitute? Also one of the girls bringing out our food didn't know what half the rolls were. 

Down to my biggest problem with Doh: CONSISTENCY. Although the presentation was very appetizing, their dishes had a huge problem with consistency. I can stand for the garnishes and the way they plate the same dishes to be different, but food should always stay the same. Some of the rolls we ordered and liked, did not taste as good when we ordered a secondary roll. We also ordered the buttered scallops and literally every single piece had varying textures. I wasn't going to eat anymore after my first piece (way too soft and fell apart) but my friend said that they were all different. I didn't actually believe her until I kept popping them into my mouth and discovered how right she was. 

All in all, Doh is an okay restaurant. There are much better AYCE sushi places in town that are the same price as Doh; unless I was dragged back, I wouldn't go here again.",olnTacPoKxP_uFRS-__4bQ,1,0,3,dplik1rxz2mE2L3YzwU_OA

The only reason I didn't give them all 5 stars is because the service here can be a little better. The servers are nice no doubt but they confused my orders a couple times. I had to reorder my miso soup twice before they finally brought it out. My sister also ordered one and hers was never even brought out. She just gave up on reordering hers.

The food is different here compared to Goyemon so of course I didn't get my sushi fix. The food here is more tapas compared to sushi. They have rolls that don't have rice which is cool. Most of the dishes seemed more Korean. Some of the food was a bit over cooked as well. 

The workers didn't really pay attention to us even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Many of the workers are sitting on their phones and eating at the bar. The workers were also chatting with one another. They didn't take away our empty dishes or know where to place our new dishes. We had to track down the workers if we wanted to make an order.

Family of 8, we have dined here many times and each time it gets worse. The servers could care less and they automatically try to take an 18% gratuity? No way. Btw you can fight that. It's absolutely  ridiculous. My parents and grandparents orders for Ayce came out after, yes after, our ice cream desserts came out. The ice cream we ordered wasn't even correct either. They brought us out 3 more than what we ordered. Then they brought out the rest of the sushi which consisted of the ahi pokie, tuna, eel, baked mussels, etc ....only after we complained the orders never came out and it had already been over 40 minutes. Oh, and the sashimi my parents ordered never came out...period. I specifically asked the server about this and all he could say was it's coming. Well, it never did. Not exaggerating. I am also a server elsewhere so yes I pay attention. They were rude to us about it. No apologies. We had to complain to three servers!!! Only then was something done about it. This by far was the worst experience ever. The other times were not great but it seems to be getting progressively worse. I should have known. The place wasn't even packed or busy enough I felt. There were three servers I had seen. Anyway, come to this place if you enjoy bad and unorganized, careless, rude servers...okay quality fish...unless rolls are your thing.

Furniture should be comfortable, regardless of looks ...my place was the sushi counter. Chairs are ok ...a tad low for a 6 footer, but I'm not gonna trash a restaurant for their furniture. 
Music should be background; a tad loud for my preference with varied selections. Better if Doh keeps the music mix to one genre.
This is my second trip here in 4 days...I 
must admit I paid no attention to the above issues until I read the comments.
On food ....all my orders AYCE came out yum yum yummy 
On beer...... Nice cold Hite 
On service .....A-1 from servers to sushi chefs.
I can't understand why we have such complete opposite experiences.

The worst thing about all of it was the amount of rice. It seemed like an 80:20 ratio and it was a bit soggy and weirdly seasoned. We didn't get to try many things and barely got to take advantage of the 1/2 rolls. We usually go to jjanga and they don't do half rolls. But I'd say we would still rather go there. 
The service was pretty spot on. They kept our waters full and sushi and appetizers came out pretty quickly. 
I've been here a couple times before, however that was over a year ago, and all I remembered was the butterfly roll. It may sound odd but it has peanut butter in it, and it is just awesome! It was still as good as it was before maybe just a little more rice :/ but I'm still happy to have tasted it again. 
We had the banana dream for dessert which was actually pretty delicious! Id recommend if you decide to come here. We also had a plum ice cream which just tastes like bubblegum and the green tea which tastes like actual green tea! But I didn't like it too much because I think it needed more sugar ha. 
We also had a small hot sake, which was probably like any other house sake you would get anywhere else. We would usually order a few of those while we are eating sushi, but since we were already pretty filled up from the rice in our first round, and felt unsatisfied with our money's worth, we didn't order any more.

1297497,2014-03-19,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"So after much acclaim from friends on Facebook and Instagram, I decided to give this place a try. First off, for a Friday night, I was presently surprised that we were able to get seated right away. We were prompted with friendly greetings and looked over the menu. Maybe it's just me, but I love the huge ""Doh"" on the back wall where the sushi chefs are stationed. The whole set up in the place is really nice and I give them an A+ on that. 

The good thing about this place is, for a $25.00 price you get all you can eat sushi AND tapas. I was not expecting that, but I had no problem with ordering off of both menus. The time limit is one hour, which isn't much time if the place is busy. I can honestly say though that we were there for well over an hour and it didn't feel as if we were rushed or forced out.

As for the food, we ordered the BAKE GREEN MUSSELS and the GYOZA. Both of which were standard in their appearance and taste. Nothing jumped out at me. I did order the KIMCHI FRIED RICE which I really liked. They give you a pretty decent sized portion, so it is definitely good for sharing. 

The rolls were fairly standard as well, like the CRUNCH ROLL and LOBSTER POPCORN ROLL. They were good, don't get me wrong and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Maybe it's just me getting bored with rolls, but let me tell you their SALMON NIGIRI was perfection. A fresh cut of salmon with the right balance of rice. And the UNI was as fresh as I'v ever had it. Presentation is key, as we all know food tastes only as good as it looks and I was very happy with everything!

Through this, it may not be the most surprising sushi place in the valley, but I do think that it is a pretty darn good place. I would definitely come back for the nigiri and to try some of the tapas, including the ramen!

I recommend this place to all sushi fanatics, go out and explore the world of DOH!",cDrNm3ybIQF24wm-lr672g,0,1,4,GpNl_7DA1P1VbV-v35q4tw

1393446,2015-08-23,1,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"Went here the other night with some friends. We had been hearing a lot about it. Some were saying it was AYCE and Korean BBQ combined together. Unfortunately, we found that wasn't really the case and became quite disappointed by the false rumor we had heard. Despite this, I'm not going to write a review based around the claim that this was Sushi + Korean BBQ since that's not really fair to the restaurant. 

We had a variety of foods during this visit, from nigiri and rolls, to Ramen and Yakitori on the back of the menu. Overall, everything tasted good with a few exceptions. Based on what I had though, I couldn't point out anything spectacular. Doh is pretty average with the benefit of having a menu with a lot of variety. 

Below I list a few issues I had overall: 

- Got the bacon wrapped asparagus yakitori. The bacon wasn't very crispy, which my friend complained about, but I don't mind a soft bacon personally. My biggest beef with the asparagus was the graininess of 2 out of 3 of the pieces. I seriously had to spit it out into my napkin because I couldn't bear having it in my mouth anymore. This was truly a disappointment since I freakin' LOVE asparagus. 

- I wanted to order a drink on the menu called, ""The Sparky Ginger"". In case this item was not available for the day, I had a few backups in mind. When the waitress came around, she informed me that all the drinks I had chosen were no longer being served at the restaurant. Another big disappointment. I ended up not getting a drink in the end. Please update your menus or at least put tape over items not available! 

- My final qualm was the ramen. My friend had ordered a bowl of seafood ramen. It was quite large, so no problem there, but it tasted like instant, packaged ramen. The broth was good, so kudos to them making one of the best instant ramens I've had, BUT I still would have preferred something a little more authentic. 

OVERALL, the restaurant is good, but there are better ones, especially in the nearby area and for the price range. The only reason I would come here is if I were looking for a lot of variety and was really in the mood for a lot of appetizers with my sushi.",VFtQI1mODorJr_mHIglsCA,1,1,3,UgJkY0LfvjqJEX66SO48LQ

Chicken Gizzard Skewer, Tuna Poke, Seaweed or Salmon Skin Salad, Butter Calamari, Butter Scallop, Spam Musubi, Miso Soup, and most definitely... Nacho Daddy.

Select nigiri choices:

Garlic Tuna, Pepper Tuna, Surf Clam, Octopus, Bay Scallop, Albacore

Select rolls:

Pink Lady, Japanese Lasagna OR Volcano Roll, Butterfly, Crunch Albacore, and the classics... Philly Roll, Cucumber Roll, Spicy Tuna, Salmon Skin.

And top it off with mochi or ice cream.

There's probably been a couple times where the overall visit wasn't AS good. But a couple times out out of dozens of times is completely ok in my book. Everybody is allowed to have an ""off"" day as long as it's not often. In my experiences, it's not often.

Some of the longtime staff I haven't seen lately which is a little sad but it's the nature of any work environment.

He suggested rolls for us to try & asked us what types of fish we liked & would make up things himself for us to eat. So good!!!  He was also entertaining and fun to talk to which made the whole dining experience much better. The fish was fresh and tasted great. Totally recommend the Lobster Popcorn roll.

What I didn't like was that we weren't given what we wanted. For example, we ordered the peppered tuna sushi and you give us garlic tuna? Even though our receipt clearly showed that we asked for the former. On our last round, we got the Screaming O, Jonny, and crunch roll. The Screaming O roll and Jonny roll said it came with screaming orgasm sauce and you put eel sauce on it instead? I came here on a previous visit with a coworker during dinner and got the S.O sashimi so I've tasted and seen what the sauce is. Now I don't know if it's because they thought we were all newbies at sushi but I know what eel sauce and s.o. sauce are and you took the short route hoping we wouldn't notice. Especially cause the sauces looked and tasted exactly the same as the eel sauce put on the crunch roll. 

Apart from that, the agedashi tofu was good as was the edamame. We stayed away from the nigiri after seeing how much rice vs fish they were giving us from our first order.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,3,0,2,ueBwTgv4PjTASmcCUrLVpA

I was running around town with my family in tow and since it was an off hour, we decided to try it out.

The interior was frankly shocking. An antiquated library meets formal study. Lots of wood work and molding everywhere. Love the interior design. Spacious and open. Full sushi bar in the back.  Very nicely designed.

When I asked the quiet but polite server some questions about the space, she politely responded that she didn't know.

We ordered up! And how did it fare?

As far as highlights and lows...

-The seafood ramen was rich and generously portioned. 

-The breaded chicken was just awful. Seriously awful. Dry, chewy, and tasted like it was frozen an hour ago. 

-Bulgogi was spot on. 

-the okonomiyaki was such a bastardized version of real, honest-to-Japan messy goodness that is made me feel so sad. This was like a pizza version.

-Everything else was pretty average aka forgettable. 

The general rule for doh seems that their Korean dishes are above average but the Japanese ones are just wacky and poor in execution.

A lot of the dishes needed to come out when they done to ensure they were hot but since the timing of the kitchen was off or the server was waiting got a few to take, some of the dishes were cold!

Now for the music. Yes, music. Clearly someone's iPod on shuffle. Now, before I get slammed for anything, I really like kpop and jpop. Super junior, GG, beast, etc. But the playlist would play one English song quietly, followed by three really loud Korean songs. 

Then, at 3pm on a weekday, my family and I had the pleasure of listening to some song by Nikki Minaj and Eminem featuring F bombs and lots of colorful language. Awkward.

It took a long time to get all of our food and there were very few people in the restaurant.
Not to mention, as customers arrived, they sandwiched us all in a row in this huge restaurant. Come on, spread us out a bit! 

If this restaurant works out some pretty big issues, it could be awesome. But it has a long way to go.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,7,3,1,AuW4IT3ZNWA5eizTX9OPzQ

However, when it comes to the food - it is really hit or miss. I went and got the AYCE sushi/tapas option and it was a bit confusing of a menu and I'm not sure what the point of all of these types of restaurants are when really it's just an additional ten other items and the other items that we ordered off the tapas menus were much too dry and overcooked which is really what you want to go to a restaurant to pay for at the end of the day in my opinion. What ends up in your stomach. 

So for the food, because it's a hit or miss - one star.

An order of sashimi is included in all you can eat, unique feature for all you can eat sushi. The last lunch I had here our chef, Alex, gave me Red Snapper sashimi with REAL FRESH WASABI from JAPAN! It was nothing like the Wasabi (horseradish) paste that we usually have in the States. If you get a chance, ask for it.

However the kitchen really does close at 2 AM daily, but they stay open till 3 AM for hanging out or if you want to drink I guess? I think it's confusing, but the sushi was nice enough that I will be back at an appropriate hour. 

No wonder they were all cleaning up and the lights were brightly on. I'd be pissed too to see me walking in solo at that hour. I apologized and explained that it was my first time and that I did not know that they closed at 2am. It was then explained to me that I wasn't mistaken that they just do last call at 2am, but they're open until 3am. I replied with, ""if people want to drink at a bar they'll go hang out at a bar.""

My favorites are: Galbi (bbq short rib), soft shell crab, meat skewers, and crispy rice sushi.  I wanted to try more but I was soooo full.  The kimichi was a little bland for me (but I like it effing hot) and the sushi bibimbap had way too much rice and not enough vegetables.  I also wasn't too fond of the buckwheat anchovy noodle soup as it had very little flavor and was very filling, which is not what I'm going for when I'm trying to eat a bunch of different things.  One thing I didn't like is that they use pickled jalapenos on their dishes- I prefer fresh jalapenos as a garnish. And some of the rolls that said was made with soft shell crab was actually made with fake crab meat.  I get it, they need to save money and can't put the real stuff in AYCE but don't say it's real if it isn't.  Overall a great experiences and we look forward to coming back.

We asked our server politely for refill of water and after the third time he finally got us a refill but he took our cups from our table and brought them to the kitchen and can back with our refills but before coming back to drop off our water he stopped at the computer to place another party's order.

The food arrived and I was so please at how delicious everything was. Their spicy edamame and their crunch role was the best I've had so far! We pretty much ordered half of the menu and I enjoyed all of it.

The service was terrible!!

We didn't get any water refills unless we flagged one of them down. After all of our dirty plates were taken away and we informed them that we wanted the check it took about 20 min to get it and about another 20 for them to return with our debit cards!

2952048,2015-12-05,1,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"Thanksgiving weekend in Vegas.. The traffic was a bitch on the way back to LA.

We came here two days straight for lunch because we really liked the food esp the sushi and skewers. And who drinks miso soup for ayce? Apparently, I did and I liked it haha The reason I liked it because it was light and it's not salty like how most other places make it.

Anyway, as much as we liked the food, the service was terrible. At least I think it sucked. On the first day, we arrived at 11am and what do you know, they opened at 11am! So we were the first in the restaurant. However, when we were ready to order, we waited a bit for the waitress to come take our orders but she didn't even noticed we were ready because she was on her phone. Um...hello? ""Excuse me, we are really to order!"" I shouted. We also ordered the yummy soft shell crab but it took forever! But it was very tasty. However, if you eat two or more pieces, you'll probably get sick of it bc it'll be too oily since it was fried. 

The second day, we went around 2pm. It was also slow but the food came out quicker, maybe because the owner was working that day. But you know what, I didn't like the service either. We assumed that older lady that took our order is the owner bc she was talking to some of her customers in Korean. Well, I am sometimes a very sensitive person. I felt like she had an attitude. It's like we were not even done ordering and she already walked away with only a few orders. Geez, so much for customer service from the owner herself. Maybe that's why the staffs are just soso.

I usually get nigiri instead of rolls. Started off with yellowtail and salmon and I must say, it's really good. The slices of fish are just right. Not too thick and not too skinny. It tasted fresh and flavorful. The rice kinda just tasted like regular rice instead of sushi rice. If you're a nigiri type of person, I say go for it. 

Now the tapas. I got the soft shell crab tempura, shrimp tempura, beef tongue skewer, butter scallops, and steamed pork belly. Everything was pretty damn good EXCEPT for the steamed pork belly. You would think that this place being owned by the people of tofu hut would make their pork belly taste well, sadly it doesn't. It tasted bland and didn't come with any type of sauce. Their beef tongue skewer is to die for!!!! It's so good but unfortunately you can only get one skewer per person ): 

Lastly, I got the green tea tempura ice cream and it was okay. The tempura to ice cream ratio was off. If their was more ice cream it would've been perfect!",2Z29fLaeLtGnNroTuHyJ2A,1,0,4,ZhFHssc_fgN_PjkJskk67Q

The food was good, but their sushi is served more rice than fish. The crispy rice was practically burnt. The only really good thing was the plum ice cream. The venue was very nicely decorated.

Let's start with Atmosphere - open and very nice, friendly feel.. Actually excited for this experience-- 
Sat down... Waited maybe a few minutes for a waiter/ waitress to approach ask us what we would like to drink-- Tea is not Free you have to pay / wasn't told / that usually means it's not a true authentic Asian Resturant- but I know times are changing. Went to order the tapas but noticed they were very pricey- opted for the all-you-can-eat sushi instead--I critique a restaurant on very simple things, Time I get my food/ how it's presented, if it's hot or cold, and finally the taste.
Bland is the word I would use, for all the tapas I tried. 
Went to order Hamachi Kama on a Saturday night now at 6pm and your Sold Out?? really- ok- but u should tell people who order all you can eat-- that some items are sold out ahead of time-- very rude to just find out-
Now this is where it gets scary-- 
Order my sushi, the usual hamachi, bland, red snapper, bland- just no taste of the fish or maybe it's because they Slice the Fish so Thin that I just tasted the rice it was on? 
Order soft shell crab- it was great! Ordered Kalbi rock STARK cold-- sent it back.. Sad...
Obviously precooked, but ur not busy? Just pure laziness in a kitchen. 
The Amebi shrimp, sweet shrimp.. Just no taste...
Finally I ordered the most simple but yet tastiest things that I always order- Masago with Uzura- egg with Quail egg- I love this but this is what actually happened... I go to order and Waiter tells me, "" oh we are sold out of Quail egg"" I think ok, nothing new about this place, everything sold out... Done with dinner ordered dessert and out comes a waitress with 6 pieces of Masago with Quail Egg-- WTH!! I call her over and ask, is that Quail Egg, she says Yes... Wow.... So I don't wanna be racist but that was the most Racist thing I ever experienced in a Resturant. The table with Pure blood Asians who speak your language get what you told me, the white half blood and don't speak ur language, was Sold out... What is that?? I confront you by asking why they got Quail egg? And your answer is to smile - and ask if there is anything else we want. No. No- never again, will I be apart of that... Mortified is the word I wanted to use but posting it here feels like justice. Wow-- yah, service was Great! Not..",-7bM_DeL2Kj2CuYuVDsLNg,15,5,1,qNAG7D2M45ncxVWuIoXO6Q

3166670,2014-09-12,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"This place is bomb. That's really the only word that comes to mind when I describe it.  

The service is stellar. I never have to wait longer than a few minutes to be seated, though that could be due to the times during the day I go (late afternoon, early evening). The servers are always walking around and checking up on customers. Drink refills come often with no 10 minute wait to cleanse the palate. The ambiance and decor is really appealing and welcoming. It doesn't look like your typical sushi bar as it is really high-end looking. Of course that doesn't mean it's a certain attire to eat there. It's completely open to all. 

The food is amazing and really well priced. The sushi is freshly made to order and looks great in terms of presentation. The flavors are always spot on and spice levels are comparable to other sushi bars I've eaten at, though it tends to be a bit more spicy with certain rolls (namely rolls with spicy tuna). 

I see a lot of people post about the AYCE at this location. IMO, it's a bit pricey compared to other sushi bars but for the quality it's fair. I wouldn't recommend the AYCE though. It's not awful, just not worth it. If you love the specialty rolls that are a bit pricey, go for it. If you like the basic rolls (like me; I eat spicy tuna and shrimp tempura all the time with no complaints), don't bother.  The time limit is another thing that's a con but it's not unlike any other sushi bar so that's not something to hate too bad.

1.) Lots of options to choose from. There's an AYCE sushi & tapas menu for $25.99 (as of 06/21/16)

2.) The portions for everything is really big so beware & order slowly!

3.) Restaurant was clean & spacious


CONS:
1.) The service was extremely slow.

2.) Our waiter told me that my food will come out really late because I was one of the last ones to order from my group. WHAT RESTAURANT TELLS YOUR CUSTOMER THIS. Keep in mind that the restaurant was not busy at all.

3.) The food that was actually good we were only allowed to order it once. (Anything that has a star next to it.)

4.) The fish was not fresh at all! The tuna tasted dry & like cardboard.

5.) This place gave me food poisoning!!!! 


VERDICT:
- I will never come back here!! This place made me feel completely sick to my stomach after I ate here. The raw fish did not taste fresh nor did it taste like fish at all. Stay away from the raw fish if you decide you're brave enough to try this place! 

I decided not to give this place just 1 star because some of the food wasn't all that terrible. Highly suggest only ordering from the tapas menu instead of sushi to avoid getting sick. The tapas menu was by far my favorite.",YaDNB9P5ujr15xoOCtcQmg,5,2,2,de7exHE2AKCW3bZPv9nfLg

Today, I ate there for my second time. It was NOT busy at all. At most, about only 12 customers there. Being that I only drink water and I drink a lot of it, I realized they NEVER came to check on us and asked if we were doing okay (coming from a girl who has previous restaurant experience as a cashier and a waitress.) My friend and I were dying of thirst. I even said ""excuse me"" out loud as this waiter walked by. But he didn't hear me. Until the second time because I had to raise my voice a little. 

Ordering for our second round, I got appetizers. I waited 20 minutes for it. Calamari was under cooked. Keep in mind that it was appetizers. It shouldn't have taken them 20 minutes. Turns out, they forgot about my order! 

Once we were done, we asked for our check. $21 x 3 = $63, right? Plus a little tax of course. Our check came out to $83. On their menu, they only add gratitude to parties 6+. They added gratitude onto ours and it was a ""mistake"". How did they not keep our table on track? Also keep in mind that there were only about 12 people in their restaurant for lunch time! We told our waiter about it, she went ahead and fixed it. When she came back with it, she tossed the booklet with the receipt inside of it onto our table and walked it off like really?! but it really just took off about $10. For 3 people, $71 total. 

After all, I'm feeling really sick from all that food. So thank you for serving us, Jaehee.  I don't think I'll ever come back. Bad experience and bad service.",yesUBKGQWZ5gYspoYqyKug,7,1,1,U9_2vPflUGZghoF9XcbgAg

Seeing the pictures of the happy cooks and servers was nice to see, as well as the decor which was really awesome.  The environment was really nice, very quiet and super artistic.  Now the main thing is the food.  And boy do they not disappoint.   The nigiri is very well cut, and simple.  The size of fish portions well with the rice.  The quality is quite nice and it being ayce was pretty sweet.  The rolls were very special and different.  Most  of the flavor combinations were top notch.  Also the selections of hot food  was very large and great to choose from.

First of all, the sushi was incredibly bad.  The rice was very hard and chewy.  I don't know what kind of rice they use but it is definitely not sushi rice.  The amaebi nigiri sushi was ruined because they poured on some vinegary sauce on the shrimp.  This made the sushi sour and it made it fall apart.  The maguro was not cut in the right direction so it seems the sushi chefs do not know how to slice fish.  

The cooked items were better than the sushi except for the very small portions.  We had the Kalbi, bulgogi and shrimp tempura.  The shrimp tempura was terrible.  It was soggy and oily.  Very sad.

Doh sushi and tapas serves an AYCE menu of Japanese/ Korean sushi and tapas.
Doh gives off a very modern classic setting, very different from what is currently in Chinatown. In the front of restaurant you will find a study with wooden bookshelves. Feels like a scene out of the popular korean soap opera, Coffee Prince. There's a huge map on the walls of the restaurant. I like that they did not stick to the typical solid walls because it forces you to take minute and experience the restaurant and notice things like the molding throughout the restaurant,the color schemes they chose, and the sushi bar in the back.

I tend to overeat whenever I go to AYCE restaurants but that's the point...The problem with stuffing your face until you are at the point of bursting is that most dishes start becoming forgettable unless they were amazing! Dishes that would normally be good also start tasting like they lack or overdid something. 

I did not like all of the dishes that I ordered but some of my favorite were;
-The Bulgogi 
-Dragon Roll
-Salmon Sashimi
-Salmon skin salad
-Avocado Bomb

Their servers did miss a few of the items that we tried ordering but we were so full towards that middle of the meal that we decided not to even mention it. Service can be a bit slow but there is a server that walks around to check up on you and see if you would like to order anything else. 

I suggest requesting half rolls because not every roll is great.

The Bad - the rice to fish ratio for the rolls was lob sided, heavier on the rice. I don't know what your preference is but I like my rolls FISHY. Service could be better. There was a really cute waitress, though. 

The Ugly- although the quality of the fish was good, I wouldn't repeat. Maybe to see the waitress.

I was actually beginning to dislike the cuisine and started to lose my palette for it.

However my faith in sushi was renewed by Alan at this cheeky location, with its unique menu choices and interior. Not only were the classics on point such as Tuna sashimi and seaweed salad, but my favourite dish Super White Tuna simply melted in my mouth. I definitely got a second order before I got too full.

If you're not the biggest sushi or fish fan they offer an interesting dish that consists of deep fried ham and cheese called Vegas Toast. I myself didn't try it but my fish-phobic boyfriend had at least six orders on AYCE.

I also tried a new roll to my experience I believe titled the Jonny roll with SO sauce which was define. I always appreciate a restaurant that doesn't make me regret trying new things.

Alan was a delightful addition to the experience and kept consistently attentive to our orders. We never waited too long and he made sure multiple times that everything came out to our liking. 

Even the bathrooms were exquisite, which is always appreciated.

I went to lunch yesterday and I had a really good time. Maybe they are really looking at these reviews and taking them to heart? 

First off the restaurant is beautiful, spacious, modern, and clean. 

We were seated quickly and there was no wait as it was slow. 

I only had one bad thing and it was the strictness of their AYCE time limit. I totally get it but the lady was kind of rude about it. We were waiting on one person and were super hungry! So we wanted to order edamame as a starter. She gave us the whole speech about not being able to switch from a la cart to AYCE and I totally understand-it makes sense as I've done AYCE plenty of times at other places. I understand as they have a 60 minute time on the AYCE. My issue is could we not have just ordered the edamame and paid al a carte for it AND THEN decide to get AYCE when the other person arrived? I think yes but apparently we couldn't. My issue was just her approach. It's essentially putting more money on our bill so why not? Anyways.

After that everything went well. We had three people helping us, refilling drinks, and bringing our food. The servers were all nice and checked on us frequently.

We did end up getting a la carte. The prices are affordable for that. Miso soup was like $1.50 and edamame was like $2.50 so aside from AYCE they have some affordable a la carte options.

The thing that's unique about this establishment's menu is that they offer ""tapas"" or small plates. They have a few standard salads, the traditional AYCE sushi appetizers, and then more unique tapas dishes like agedashi tofu. 

I don't know if it's because we ordered a la carte but the presentation on these dishes were beautiful.

We got two orders of edamame, agedashi tofu, a house salad, sea weed salad, miso soup, spicy salmon roll, a golden California roll, and a shrimp tempura roll. With a coke and water it was about $40 bucks. Totally should have just got AYCE but I thought it was a good price.

None of the food was anything special except their rolls and the sea weed salad! Their rolls had the right amount of rice and they didn't over use the eel sauce. I love eel sauce but it really can overpower with it's sweetness or ruin the texture of the other components.

The spicy salmon roll was really good as it had large cubes of salmon instead of being mushy paste like most places.

The shrimp tempura roll was so good. Either I got the piece where the two shrimp usually meet up in the middle or they are really generous with the shrimp lol. They also wrapped it in soy paper which was a nice touch IMO.

The golden California roll was also good. They didn't use a heavy tempura batter so it was surprisingly light and and since they didn't douse it in sauce it was really crunchy. 

The agedashi tofu was surprisingly good also. I had to try something off of the tapas side and this is my favorite thing to order whenever I see it on a menu. I wish they served it with a spoon though or else the broth is hard to taste. They fried it well and it was delicious although not the best I've had. 

Overall I'm glad I came and will definitely be back.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,0,4,wIjtFcxu4Bo7IT8ztcaxBQ

The Korean ramen was a disappointment sadly... It was instant Korean ramen. The veggies in it were still dehydrated and tough. They did garnish with fresh spring onion however. I would recommend either making real ramen or taking it off the menu. Had I wanted instant ramen I would have gone to the market next door and added water to a $2 bowl.

4110036,2016-02-21,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"came here last minute after having drinks at the Golden Tiki, when we walked in around 7p there were a lot of people waiting but a LOT of open tables available.  I understand if maybe there aren't enough servers to wait on the tables then there's no point to seating guests who'll just be waiting for someone to come around, maybe they were short tonight who knows.  Anyway, we noticed there were just enough seats at the bar for our party of 6 so we asked the hostess if we could just sit at the bar, she said she would have to ask the chefs, ""Ok"".  She proceeded to look at her list of people waiting and after several minutes someone from my group takes it upon herself to go to the sushi bar to see if we can sit there (since it needed to be ok by the chefs) the chefs then said, you need to check with the hostess.  So here we are, with plenty of tables open, enough seats for our party at the sushi bar, hostess needs approval from the chefs, chefs need approval from the hostess, and no one wanting to seat us.  When we finally get the approval to sit at the bar, a server comes over and takes our drink orders.  It takes a while for someone else to come by and take our actual food orders for appetizer and things from that need to be ordered from the kitchen, after ordering and receiving some of my items from the sushi chefs in front of me, i realize we still haven't received our drinks.  To make a long story short, the service was kind of all over the place, it took forever for someone to come by with the check when we were finally done the food was just ehh.  Most of the nigiri I ordered was covered in sauce and the the appetizer I ordered (sashimi bibimbap) was just ok, kinda bland.

What a disappointment; We watched this place being remodeled and we had such high hopes for it. I agree with my friend Phillip T. This is not the best this city has to offer.

When my Korean wife found out it was Korean, she was very anxious to try it. The fact that she was able to converse with the staff in Korean would seem to give hope that we would be given good service. Think again.

First; In most Sushi Bars, sitting at the Sushi Bar is usually a unique and better experience. This place is not the case. The Sushi Chefs are simply under pressure to get out the table orders, and have no time to converse, laugh, or amuse the guest.

Sitting at the Sushi Bar at Doh, is like sitting in the Kitchen at In 'n Out. 

Sitting at the tables isn't much better. You'd  better order your whole meal at once, or face the fact that when you need to order more, getting you waiter will be like trying to hail a cab in New York at rush hour.

Now the food. It's mediocre at best. Sushi portions are very small, Sashimi is even worse. Quality is so-so. 

These good folks wanted to compete in the AYCE Sushi business, but sad to say, they've put their money into a very nice remodel, and are paying top dollar rent for their location.

Good place if you're in your 20s, on a date, and want to impress someone who thinks a California Roll is an X-treme adventure in eating. 

I suggest Umiya on Flamingo, Jjanga up on Spring Mountain and Decatur, or even Sushi Mon, such as it is, for a better experience in quality and taste.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,3,2,2,2ubhIM7IG3_fiXD36XgugQ

1.

Once in a while they will make a mistake and forget to put my requested item, sigh. They will make you wait when the restaurant is three quarters empty and no staff to make your food.  
2. Food: portion and quality.
It used to be good, they change the ingredients all the time unless you get something like straight sashimi.  They have the good chefs, just when and how you are going to catch the good chefs, you will just have to eat it out to find out.

WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GET BOMB SUSHI AT ODD HOURS OF THE NIGHT???

My friend and I got bored/hungry at 1:00 am and we were craving sushi.

The atmosphere was nice.  Surprisingly there were a lot of people there at 1 am.

We got served right away. Previous reviews claim the service was terrible but I think they must have changed or gotten better staff because our waitress was super attentive and we got our food SO quickly!

First we got the two Korean soju mixed drinks.  One had a sour berry taste and the other was sweet with a hint of cucumber/ginger.  I love soju so maybe I'm biased.

I ordered the vegas toast, which was super rich (it's fried ham and cheese. Delicious.)
I also got the crazy nut roll (I think that's the name?) Which is pretty much a California roll topped with spicy tuna and a jalapeño with sriracha and coconut flakes. I love coconut so I thought it was really yummy.

My friend got the fried scallop roll which was pretty yummy too.

Overall, quick service, great food and drinks, cool atmosphere.

Me & my kids had eaten prior to this, so we definitely did not want an All-u-can-eat-meal, but we're OK to try a few things on the menu. My husband on the other hand was Hungry cuz he just got off work and had nothing to eat.

My husband ordered the All-u-can-eat-sushi and one of the lady servers made us feel uncomfortable patrolling to make sure we didn't share since the rest of my family ordered A la carte. (Sheesh, not everyone is trying to do you dirty lady!) 
He drinks a lot of water with his meals, and he had to choke on some of his food cuz he didn't get a water refill until they saw that the kids needed water.

My daughter & I shared & ordered the Fish Katsu, which was very disappointing. To think that we were at a Sushi place, they would use fresh fish to make this dish. Instead, we paid $7.99 for 3pcs of previously frozen Gorton's style fish sticks cut into pieces, Served with a side of salad topped w/ a Marinara sauce kind of dressing? Yes, it was a pizza sauce salad. It was weird. I wouldn't order this dish ever again and I don't recommend it. 

However, we did have a tuna roll, and the fish was good! Which is why I was confused about the fish Katsu -_- 

My son ordered beef bulgogi, and he liked it. So that was the 2 stars earned. One for good FRESH fish, and for good bulgogi. This place just Needs work on service and should probably take the Fish Katsu off the menu.",gzd6RZ-Ci7LYh0LlesTCyw,0,0,2,_frH-3PRNVfCG_Lh_Ov7pQ

Doh sushi has a serious problem with temperature control, they must store their food at unsafe temperatures. Trust me I came here with an opened mind and its not hard to please me with sushi, I love it regardless but honestly STAY AWAY. I'm calling it now, the next salmonella food poisoning spot.

Ambiance: 
Cute the decor, dark dimmed, with twinkle lighting. Rustic, felt warm and inviting. Looks like a nice place for a date but looks aren't everything....

Seaweed Salad: 
When I sit I automatically order seaweed salad. I had high hopes for this place because their seaweed salad was delicious. Lightly sauced and it still had that crunch of freshness, but you can't really ruin seaweed salad.

Baked green muscles: 
I should say NOT SO BAKED, so my first encounter with their issue of bad temperature. Please refer to my photo, notice that the mayo isn't baked at all. When the order first came out I thought it was a slice of cheese on muscle, and the muscles were cold. Told our server, she apologized and sent out another order, the worst part. It was exactly the same, cold and not baked. 

Nigiri Salmon Sushi: 
You know when you leave raw fish out for awhile and then store it at unsafe temperatures it develops this opaque slime layer. Yeah, totally what they served us. The salmon was slimy and not fresh at all. The rice to fish ratio was more rice than fish. Honestly when a sushi restaurant starts cutting corners to gain more profit, their food sucks.

Nigiri Yellow Tail Sushi:
Also slime layer, more rice to fish ratio. Wasn't happy.

Not so hot Tea:
Not sure how the hell you mess up hot tea. Okay I understand you don't want to burn customers but warm closer to cold tea isn't considered hot tea. 

Service:
Not so great, our tea was never hot. Our server forgot orders, never brought orders out, brought orders that weren't ours out, and we had to send back an order.

The restaurant itself was very spacious so there is more than enough room to accommodate for a large number of people. At first impression, the place has a nice modern/hip atmosphere to it, which is nice for those looking for a casual outing with some friends or family.

The food itself was very mixed. Some things were good and some were bad. For me this is a list of some of the food I thought tasted good or bad:

Good:
-Soft Shell Crab Tempura
-Dragon Roll
-Rock n Roll 
-Salmon Sashimi
-Tuna Sashimi
-Yellowtail Nigiri
-Salmon Nigiri (although the cuts were thin and small with a lot of rice)

Bad:
-Uni (Sea Urchin) Nigiri - TERRIBLE. I've head plenty of sea urchin before but this was NOT FRESH at all. It came to me slimy and it tasted like plastic, SHITTY PLASTIC. 
-Mackerel Nigiri - Dry
-Beef Tongue Skewer - Disappointed in the taste.

In all honesty...I have had better. The sushi was just ""ok"". I am use to high quality fresh fish (Sushi Roku) so Doh's fish quality did not measure up. 

The tempura green tea ice cream was too heavy and had an unappealing presentation. See for yourself in the picture below. The tempura shell was ""greasy"" and had a fried oil aftertaste. I could not finish it. 

My memorable dishes of the night were the tiger roll, bulgogi and the seaweed salad. Everything else...meh.

I will give Doh another shot but I will avoid the tempura ice cream. My stomach is now upset by it. :(",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,2,1,3,StrkLPRjKZgY9qXx4I9H5Q

Service 2/5
Atmosphere 4/5

Lunch all you can eat- $22
Dinner all you can eat- $26

The food was great! I enjoyed all the Korean and Japanese dishes. I would say that there are mostly Korean dishes other than the sushi and okonomiyaki. 

On the menu, make sure to read the restrictions and don't fret about the time (60mins) because they said it's only for when the restaurant is packed. 

When we came in, I loved how clean the restaurant looked. It looked very new and spacious. 

Our plates were dirty so we had them be changed, but my new plate was chipped. I also think they need to clean the soy sauce bottle because the sides were crusty. 

The service was not that good. They only had 2 waiters. It was pretty full when we left but our food took a long time even though we came when it was fairy empty. There were people waiting to be seated for about 10-15 minutes although there were a bunch of tables empty. 

When we first came in, she was very cranky and complained to us of some crying kids at the table beside. I understand that she was very tired, but she should have been more professional and not have come to us to complain about it. I guess it's not a child-welcoming place. She worked as fast as she could, but they were wayyy to understaffed for the amount of customers they have. 

My only complaint about the sushi was that it had way too much rice, but the sushi itself was very fresh. 

We ordered the ...
Screaming O tuna- delish! I would def order this again! I really enjoyed the ponzu&mayo sauce
Pork Belly- (we ordered three) SOOO GOOD! You must order it! The marinate was very good and the pork was cooked perfectly. 
Odang- the soup tasted more like udon. The odang was very delicious tho! But it became very sweet because of the onion and carrot
Salmon- very vibrant orange. Very good and was near the belly area!
Tuna- good
Yellow tail- very good as always
Okonomiyaki- don't order this. It's literally batter with LOTS of mayo and little pieces of bacon
Banana dream- light batter drizzled w chocolate and caramel sauce
Crunch albacore- my favorite roll! The spice level was perfect!
Uni-pretty good
Soft shell crab- ordered two :)
Shrimp- good
Bossam- ordered three and devoured them

Overall, the food is very good especially for the price that I would come back even though the service was not good.",nRicr5sDYwpDUM9s2bjS4w,1,1,4,2mh-fuj7J7a79_VvIDcWYw

Sushi: A-OK ;)
Korean tapas: DELISH!

2 cuisines that I love most: Japanese and Korean. Now there's all-you-can-eat for both?!?! That's great news for me! I can get my sushi and my Korean fix here at the same time and leave EXTRA content. 

The truth: our server and the sushi chefs were a tad uncomfortable and unnatural while serving us. It almost made us feel a tad awkward ourselves. Maybe some confident, outgoing service staff is in order?

Also, the sushi wasn't amazing; however, for an AYCE joint, I really can't complain. I love that they offer sashimi (1 order per person) so we really enjoyed their salmon and pepper tuna, which was a first for me. Their popcorn lobster roll is fun. 

What really impressed me most were the Korean tapas! One word: KALBI. The kalbi reminded me of how my mom used to make it. It was so tender and marinated perfectly, not too salty but filled with flavor. The skewers are great! The beef tongue was a tad chewy, but still good nonetheless. Their shumai is different than other places but still yummy. I may come back and only order tapas!

GREAT variety, lots to offer!

The restaurant itself is nice and clean. I didn't go use the restroom so cannot tell you about that.

We ordered some tapas and rolls. They were all just okay. My favorite roll is the spicy salmon roll, but this place absolutely butchered it.  The salmon was in big chunks and sauce was meh and looked unappetizing. I like the salmon to be chopped up a lot more with a lot of spice.

Bulgogi was cooked in some generic teriyaki sauce. It didn't even taste like real bulgogi, but, meat was okay.


We also ordered the sashimi bibimbap (for Koreans hwe dup bap). The sauce was good but the white fish in it tasted terribly fishy. The other fish in it, tuna and salmon, were okay.  All the other rolls we ordered were california rolls with some sort of topping - caterpillar roll and lobster popcorn roll. 

Lunch came out to 60  + with tip and drinks and definitely not worth it. Should have went to Mr. Tofu where we originally were going to go because we thought this place was closed during the day.  Better than Naked Fish sushi? No way!",4AUHvCZVKsWH5Uqx5wgfmQ,0,0,2,3htuh_raQrkSO-BHGHWkvA

We were still determined to fulfill our AYCE sushi cravings. One of my friends recommended Doh as an alternative, they serve AYCE sushi and Korean tapas. Best part is they take reservations! We got a table for 8 right away. Great right?! Maybe something's  wrong with this place if there is no wait on a Friday night. 

The nigiri sushi and sashimi were disappointing because the slices of raw fish were too small and thin. Also there was too much rice vinegar in the sushi rice and it was too warm, which made the nigiri hard to pick up without the rice falling apart all over the place. Fail! Although the fish was tiny, the quality was good. Except the Uni wasn't too fresh. Usually it is my favorite thing on the menu but I had to gulp it down with water. Ugh! Second sushi fail. Amaebi was pretty good. So I'm 50 percent undecided about the nigiri sushi here. I'm not much for fancy rolls with a bunch of crap in them that fill u up. Though I did love the lasagna roll, baked and crispy with cream cheese and sweet mayo smothered all over it, yummy!

The Korean tapas were quite enjoyable. Loved the galbi, beef & pork bugolgi, japche and kimchi fried rice. The steamed pork belly was blah, but the raw mussel Kimchee that accompanied it was awesome! I'll order it again but hide the pork belly lol. 

Always room for dessert! The green tea ice cream was blah, too much matcha powder. Plum ice cream was delicious, I had to steal it from my friend since I didn't order it. Banana dream was just decent but not for me. Coffee mochi was very good. 

I will definitely come here again. The place was nice and had an open dining area. Staff was friendly and attentive making sure we were well fed with orders coming in at all times. The waitress did forget a few things like my smoked salmon nigiri, bummer. Oh well, I was too full anyways. I felt bad for one friend that tagged along and doesn't eat much sushi.

5004542,2016-01-03,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"My roomie and I's first time trying Doh! Here's how our experience went.

Ambience: the decor was geek chic. Loved the book shelves and the giant map on the wall! The seating was comfy, and the space was large and open.

Service: the waiters were a little slow at first. Took about 5 minutes after we were seated for someone to ask for a drink order. But once our orders were taken, the waiters were on point. Very nice and friendly!

Food: The quality of the food was good but I was a little underwhelmed. I'm not a sushi snob, but there were just a few things off.
   -Apps: the spicy garlic edemame was neither spicy nor very garlicky- disappointed. Cooked tender though!
   -The screaming o sashimi: I love a good screaming o. The sauce is supposed to be everything, but unfortunately, this one didn't have have enough or just didn't pack enough punch that I expect from a SO sauce. The fish quality was great however!
   -The rolls: WTH, Something Wrong, Screaming O, Rock & Roll, Fire in the Hole. Again, I'm not a sushi snob, but none of the rolls wowed me. The quality was good, but the flavored were lackluster. For example, in the Something Wrong roll, if you say it has a spicy garlic ponzu sauce, I expect- from experience at other restaurants that have this type of sauce- a sauce that will just slap me across the face with flavor, but I didn't get that- not enough sauce and didn't deliver on flavor. I got the Screaming O roll in hopes it would make up for the sashimi in both sauce quantity and punch, I was again let down.
    -Dessert: I was miffed they didn't have plum ice cream. Some weird excuse about how the fridge wasn't working blah blah blah, but they had vanilla? Odd. I settled for strawberry mochi, which they ended up forgetting I ordered, and I had to ask them again. The banana dream was yummy! Should've ordered that instead.
A few pluses:
    -Baked Mussels: DELICIOUS! Tender, came out hot, right amount of mayo and sauce! I definitely ordered seconds of these!
    -Nigiri: Super white and garlic tuna were yummy! Good rice to fish ratio.
    -Nacho Daddy: This was probably my favorite thing here. Just the right amount of spicy tuna and crab and copious amounts of sauce all layered on a nacho! What more could you want?! My only criticism would be that they should sub the store bought nacho for a homemade one or perhaps a fried wonton. But still great!

Overall, I might give Doh a second chance. Maybe it was an off night on the sushi preparation? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until I try them again.",iZk_fES5G7l1Nijw2rHfMw,0,0,3,lCxNNVYZeohDLy0QCcHkPw

Not sure why. Crispy rice use to be really good, now it's not, the crispyness of the rice varies. Hand rolls have gone from great last week, to stomach ache and heavy heavy rice this week. 

I do like the fact that they offer tapas AND sushi which keeps this place unique. Very wide menu. And it's right off of the strip, it closes at 2:30am, so it's convenient for drunk people. 

One time, the server spilled water right on my phone, and their apology was a $5 gift card. 

All in all, just indifferent about this place. Really have to find out what the good sushi chefs name is, because that's the only time I would probably come again.",JA1iXUGIBKeCLE2Vvjis1w,5,3,3,yA5A7q2TqhCM2WRe3takrw

I have been to many different restaurants in ChinaTown in Las Vegas and I cannot say this was the best one. But, it is definitely worth a visit. The $9.99 Lunch Bento Box is pretty good. I was not a huge fan of the giant noodles they served, but the broth they were served in was very good. I did enjoy the pork that I received in the box and it was very good, crispy and had a unique flavor that I would be willing to return to have.

So on our way back towards our house we figure "" hey let's just go eat at Chinatown"" our original plan was to go to kung fu for some Thai food but because there wasn't parking close to the restaurant we ended up parking right in front of Doh.

So we walk in and right away we get greeted by our hostess which was very nice and guided us to our table.our waitress was really cool and friendly as she was the type to recommend us things because she knew it was our first time. I sometimes dread when I walk into a AYCE establishment because nowadays most of the service is ok and most of the time you are rushed to order like they want you to eat fast and leave. But they were cool here.

One thing I have to say about this place is one you order your food you receive it within 5 min. That's awesome! I kinda felt I was eating at the sushi bar instead of a table.

Firstly it's located on Spring Mountain in Chinatown, in between Hot N Juicy Crawfish and Lee's Sandwiches.
When you enter Doh Sushi you can immediately tell the restaurant is clean and well kept. I loved the decor! The restaurant felt extremely comfortable to be in. When you first enter there are some bookshelves that give you the feeling of a warm and cozy coffee shop setting and then you have the contemporary furniture and brass fixtures that make it feel upscale. 
We ordered a variety of kitchen items such as shumai, gyoza, baked mussels, butter calamari, soft shell crab, and butter scallops. The shumai was slightly overcooked but other than that all was delicious, especially the baked mussels. 
We tried the Salmon, Jalapeño Albacore, and Tuna sashimi. All of it was extemely tender and full of flavor. (One order of sashimi per person for AYCE)
A variety of different rolls. The Vegas Roll (fried), the Lasagna Roll (baked), and the Something Wrong Roll (special). Every roll we had was full of flavor and fresh. The fried rolls were lightly breaded and cooked to perfection, most other sushi restaurants make them too crispy. 
We also ordered 3 different desserts. The green tea ice cream, chocolate mochi, and the Banana Dream (fried bananas with tempura vanilla ice cream). All I can say is WOW! Order the Banana Dream!
Lastly the service was excellent. Orders were taken professionally and promptly, drinks refilled often, and us kept happy. Will be my new regular spot.",iLaoGVj6x4kWW7xN34pOog,0,0,5,_yf9ZFyBc4VAUoyXMwi0Xw

We really the decor inside but the sushi bar didn't really blend in with the flow of the restaurant...the lighting was really bright and didn't set the mood. We did not do the ayce and I am really glad we didnt. We wanted a light snack before we had a night out in the town. We had the #1 and the pork belly, also the gyoza, California roll, spicy tuna roll, and the beef tongue skewer.

The #1 item was totally gross. It was almost like a thick tortilla with bacon that wasn't cooked right and lots of ketchup and mayo. Please avoid this item. We didn't eat it but didn't send it back because we had already sent back 1 item and didn't want to be rude.

The beef tongue skewer was bland. No flavor no salt no anything and was too chewy and fatty.


My husband had the pork belly and said it tasted like it was microwaved and not cooked.  It looked gross and I am glad I didn't taste it.

The gyoza was okay I really did not like the sauce it came with it was sticky too thick and sweet. I prefer Ponzu sauces with my gyoza.

The California roll was consistent but the seaweed was too chewy and I almost couldn't swallow it.. 

The item we send back was the spicy tuna roll. I love spicy tuna rolls but this was just awful. It was overly fishy and was all chunky and pieces of the tuna were stuck together..yuck.

I am not a negative Nancy but I work at a sushi bar restaurant on the strip and I know what good quality sushi and tastes are. And Doh simply didn't hold that standard. I was really disappointed because I had been looking forward to dining here. We left unsatisfied.. Our favorite part was the chardonnay we had and the green tea tempura ice cream.

We sat for an hour - no one had checked up on us; no drink refills nor did anyone ask if we wanted to order more food. 

We had to bother a waiter for someone to give us water and order desserts. 

Our waiter was overly rude for no reason. He was speeding us and he had such a bad attitude.

It seems to me that they strived to have delicious and high quality food for the first month, then became complacent and allowed the service and the food to go downhill from there. How unfortunate. I don't eat much but here are my complaints. Why is the rice so dry? It's so easy to cook rice and this is a sushi restaurant. That is completely unacceptable.

Meanwhile, the order in which the food was brought out made no sense. We ordered miso soup, salads, nigiri, kalbi, pork belly among other items. Why brought out the main entrees first? Wouldn't it make more sense to bring out the soup and salads right away? And how is it that the bowl of rice was brought out last? All you have to do is scoop it out of the rice cooker into a bowl and serve it. 

Also, we were unimpressed at how dry and tasteless the pork belly was, as if it was made and sat out for a long time. Lastly, I wanted to order a la carte but the waiter assumed we all wanted the all you can eat option. We weren't even asked whether or not to go with the all you can eat.

Ordered muscle for the appetizer. It is a little oily but it's good. Had the Bulgogi, galbi and bossam, the meat has very good quality, especially the Bulgogi. Fish cake soup taste like instant soup base to me.

The Soft Shell crab tempura is actually a surprise! I don't usually order them but glad that we did! It's very crunchy outside and soft and juicy in there.


Sushis are higher than expected AYCE quality, but I think the rice is way too thick! Salmon Roe is really good and fresh though. Don't order too much sushi coz the rice is too thick!!! Spicy scallop sushi is good.

Had the Rock & Roll, wrapping with cucumber with no rice, it's very sweet.

Ordered the ice cream tempura for dessert, check out the pictures! 

I'll say this place is a good quality AYCE, variety of Japanese and Korean mini dishes, I like it better than Sushi Kaya on spring mountain road.

My parents came home raving about how good their sushi is and how diverse their menu is since they also offer Korean tapas on the AYCE menu, and since then I felt excited to try it out.--Also because I started noticing people were making Doh their new regular sushi spot.

So I went one night and right away thought the sushi part of the menu was just eh, but they're fairly new so I figured they were still in the process of coming up with new rolls. The sushi itself was pretty good but nothing to make me want to come back for more. I will say this though, their tapas part of the menu is a really good idea. It gives the place a unique factor. Not all their tapas were 10/10 though. But still good. I think people like it for the price ($26 AYCE dinner) but the price is the same at Jjanga but it's waaaaay better there.

The family wanted to go to that G-spot sushi but there was a ridiculous 1hour, 45minute wait at 8pm on a Friday night. It was up to me to find a different place. I haven't heard of the people who did the reviews for this place so I was a bit concerned how reliable they were. My sister called Doh to ask if there was a wait since she can sense my patience ran out.

We were greeted by friendly hostesses and got seated right away. Our table was in front of the piano. There was live music while we were eating! But the pianist took a break/ went home by around 9pm.

The more I think about my experience, the more I like Doh. Last night I was telling myself, this place was not 5-star worthy and all the other reviews were shenanigans! I think I was just hANGRY for thinking that. I couldn't think of a single thing to complain about, well...maybe, the pork belly but our server did warn me about it though. 

This place serves AYCE sushi and Korean/Japanese tapas for $26 and is ran by Korean chefs and there were maybe 4 of them when we went so our food came out pretty quick. There's a limit on the sashimi, uni and amaebi just like most AYCE places. They have beer, sake, soju and cocktails. Our server was great. He answered all our questions and kept our drink glasses full at all times. He was dealing with a tough crowd: me - the impatient and hungry one, my aunt - with her weird questions, my cousin who's on a strict Mr. Olympia diet, my uncle who was late and extremely hungry...my sis and my bro-in-law who were the semi-normal ones for the evening. We got okonomiyaki, galbi, bossam (steamed pork belly), Vegas toast, shrimp tempura, soft-shell crab tempura, Aria roll, Rock & Roll, Avocado Bomb, Popcorn Lobster, Something Wrong, Screaming O roll, Screaming O salmon sashimi, salmon nigiri, pepper tuna, uni and amaebi. The quality of the fish and seafood was amazing. For dessert, we got a Banana Dream (banana tempura served with green tea ice cream) and a plum wine ice cream. My favorites were uni, amaebi, Screaming O salmon sashimi, and salmon nigiri but here are some remarkable menu items I tried:

Soft-Shell Crab Tempura:
There's a newer AYCE sushi place on Maryland Parkway and Flamingo that starts with an S that served (all in the past for them now) great soft-shell crab but I was sooo disappointed the last time I went. Doh's soft-shell crab was breaded lightly and the dipping sauce was a bit spicier than most places. I definitely enjoyed this. 5/5

Vegas Toast:
Breaded and deep-fried ham and cheese roll (no rice). The cheese was oozingly melted. 5/5

Okonomiyaki:
I thought I already posted a pic before I deleted all the pics but I guess not. Fail! Squid and veggie pancake with katsu sauce, catsup and bonito flakes on top. I screwed up ordering this and I was the only one interested eating it - not because it wasn't good but because it was too heavy and filling. This is not for everybody though especially if you're not familiar with takoyaki and okonomiyaki. I liked it. 5/5

Bossam:
And now, for the ""bad"". Steamed pork belly. This is how it's supposed to be prepared though so, our bad for only reading the ""pork belly"" part expecting marinated and grilled pork belly. This comes with onions and an oyster with gochujang. So since this is indeed bossam and not grilled pork belly this is 4/5.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,8,5,iOKANDZGvLtF0PJcVQHCaQ
5349061,2014-01-23,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"When I saw a new AYCE sushi place had opened up, I knew I had got to try it at one point or another. Not only did they have AYCE SUSHI, they had AYCE tapas along with it! So when my friends came to visit me, we all went to Doh to try them out. 

Let me start out by saying that Doh gives off a very modern vibe, in fact, it doesn't even look like a Japanese restaurant to me if it weren't for the sushi bar in the back. And surprisingly, it took them a tad bit longer than necessary to give us a menu and take our drink preferences down. 

I don't know about everyone else but for me, when I look at the menu, it is more than obvious that their nigiris are not the star of the show. The nigiris and sashimi only take up a corner of the menu. While their variety of rolls took over the rest of the menu and on the other side of the menu is their variety of tapas. I was a little disappointed because I am a raw fish eater. However, I am quite glad that they had some out-of-the-traditional rolls because one of my friends is a roll eater and then the tapas was perfect for my non-sushi friend. 

Now let's get down to business:

Salmon sashimi. I believe there is a one sashimi order per person rule and I LOVE salmon. However, the ones that Doh served me were not up to my standards. Fresh? Maybe. Quality? No bueno. I bit into it and ... it took work. It was stringy -- not sure if that's the right word for it since I only know the Chinese term. Not only that but it wasn't quite as flavorful as I expect salmon to be. 

Squid nigiri. I was actually expecting this to come out like the one in the picture, with the squid design and everything ... alas, that is not what came out. So I asked the server about it and he said that the squid nigiri only comes out like that if it was an a-la-carte order. Well, okay then. Though, he was really nice and offered to see if the chefs can make an order for me with the squid design, and they did. I was very grateful and happy! It looked good but they made it quite ... huge. It was a little awkward trying to eat it. 

Uni. It was a really odd experience for me when I was eating these at Doh. I'm VERY picky with uni because I can't stand uni that isn't FRESH (which is like all of the ones in Vegas amirite?) One of the uni pieces was not fresh -- tasted like salty ocean water with no sweetness to it. On the other hand, the other piece, was actually just fine. 

Aannnndddd with that concludes my raw sushi adventure at Doh. The salmon sashimi just completely turned me off to trying any other nigiris. 

Butterfly roll. I do believe this is the roll that has peanut butter in it. I applaud the creativity behind this but no, just no. For me, when I taste peanut butter, I'm expecting to taste some bread with jam along with it. This completely threw my senses into a spinning room. It just didn't mesh well with the ingredients either. I was either tasting the other ingredients in the roll or the peanut better. It doesn't combine well. It also filled me up quite fast.

WTH roll. This is supposed to be a spicy type of roll. I had asked the server if this roll was better or the ""Nuts on Fire"" and he recommended this one. Unfortunatelyt, I don't really remember much about this roll other than the fact that it was huge and I can't put a whole piece in my mouth. I ate the top and the bottom separately so I can't really give a good description of whether or not it was good. 

Plum Ice Cream. STAY AWAY FROM THIS. THIS TASTE LIKE BUBBLE GUM WITH A HINT OF PLUM. I couldn't really stomach this down :(

One of my friends ordered their Las Vegas roll and something else -- can't quite remember which one. Then the other friend ordered a bunch of katsu and meat from the tapas. 

There wasn't really a tapa dish that stood out to us aside from the Vegas toast. The Vegas toast is pretty much toast with ham and cheese then deep fried. It was done nicely and we ordered like 3 of these haha. Not really what you call Japanese cuisine but hey, whatever is good. 

To top it off, service is a little on the slow side. I normally don't really pay much attention to it when I'm with friends cause we're usually chatting up a storm. However, we were doing an AYCE option so there IS a TIME LIMIT. I was a bit worried but that's about it. 

Overall, this place is average. If you are a RAW SUSHI EATER, I don't believe that Doh is a very good option. But if you are eating with a bunch of people and you all have different preferences, this is a pretty good place. For those that don't like sushi can eat tapas and for those who do like sushi have a bunch to choose from.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,6,1,3,39fMg4pXPOqWaHRQHl4_Mg

       - Ponzu & Screaming O sauce - They do those two sauces great here. It's worth a try.
       - Eel sauce - I usually really like eel sauce, but the eel sauce here is just too rich.
       - Nigiri - 1st order had thick & fresh slices. Ordered Halibut on a second and it was thin & dry. Not sure their base line.
       - Choose wisely - What we ordered ranged from delightfully delicious to bland & dry.
       - Decor - The inside has a very modern classic look with the giant map on the wall, bookshelves & Da Vinci like sketches on the wall.
       - Rating - I'm giving it a 4 star since we can just avoid the terrible items next time we come.
**AYCE**
       - $21.95
**Ordered**
       - Skewers - Tender, but not salted. You'll have to salt yourself.
       - Dynamite - Didn't expect the eel sauce on top. I would of preferred without it.
       - Fish Cake Soup - Bland fish cake and I didn't care for the soup either. I'll stick with miso next time.
       - Soft shell crab - Lacked flavor.
       - Spicy Tuna Salad - The spicy tuna was very bland and there was no sauce or flavor to the salad in general.
       - Gabli - Short Ribs - Not as tender as I was expecting. Probably wouldn't order it again.
       - Bulgogi - Very dry.
       - Bossam - Steamed pork belly - Was expecting the marinated pork belly from Goyemon. Got dry & tasteless instead.
**Rolls**
       - Something Wrong - Shrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab with tuna, salmon & ponzu sauce on top. One of my favorite rolls. They do ponzu sauce great here. Everything in this roll went perfectly with each other.
       - Screaming O - Spicy tuna with screaming o sauce on top. It's your standard Screaming O made into a roll. If you like the classic, you'll like the roll.
       - Butter-Fly - Shrimp tempura, peanut butter (yes, the ones that go in sandwiches) with imitation crab meat, coconut shavings, yum yum sauce & eel sauce. I wouldn't order it again, but it's nice to say you've had it.
       - Popcorn Lobster - Cali roll with some fried thing on top smothered in eel sauce. Wasn't a fan of the eel sauce an the ""baby lobsters"" weren't impressive either.

**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for sushi with a slight twist. Be careful what you order though since the tasty scale varies greatly at this place.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,4,OP4mEBopZhbLnVwCt2t-mA

The server went back to the sushi bar and never came back to us to address the missing order. After a bit of time, she then comes back and asks if we had our last order. We asked whatever happened to the red snapper sashimi and the 2 orders of sushi. She said we had to re-order it because it already came out. We then re-ordered it and 'voila!' we got the 2 orders of sushi. No red snapper. We never heard from a manager regarding this. We completely understand that it's busy... and sometimes orders are given to wrong tables... this happened to us once at Umiya on an order of mussels and they rectified this issue with a million apologies... we never got one from this establishment.

Experience: we came for dinner so it was around $26 per person for all you can eat sushi, sashimi, and Asian tapas. We felt this was a very good price for everything that we received. There were some stipulations as far as everybody only being able to have one order of sashimi at a time per party which is fine I totally understand and we got way more food than we thought we could handle. There was also some rolls around making sure to eat what you ordered so that no food went to waste which I liked.

We tried a ton of food: raw sushi, noodles, rice, salad, soup-you name it we tried it! We were very satisfied with the taste of everything and didn't have one complaint. There is even good beer options and dessert on the all you can eat menu.

The okonomiyaki was the only dish that was okay in terms of flavor, but no way amazing...seemed a lot like a Korean pancake disguised as a Japanese dish. We ordered the regular and I honestly cannot imagine how small the tapas portion would be.  The regular kim chee fried rice came in the size of a small rice bowl...and pretty much lacks any real flavor.  We also ordered the galbi regular size and a tapas bulgogi....but when they arrived they both were in the same size dish.  Very sketchy, when we brought it up to the server he seemed kind of confused and wasn't sure if it was regular or tapas size.  It really wasn't rocket science there were literally 3 small slices of beef in the dish....He went back to the kitchen and confirmed they made a mistake.  He then goes on to tell us that we received a regular size bulgogi and that he would allow us to keep it.  How very generous of you?!  This ""regular"" size bulgogi is in a dish the size of my hand....and I have small hands.  Our regular galbi finally came out and it was what a regular size portion should be...clearly the waiter didn't really do us a favor with the bulgogi.  Perhaps you should just own up to your mistake.  However this is definitely not galbi, it's just kalbi cut off the bone and it really wasn't that tender or flavorful. The Korean ramen looks like instant ramen in a fancy pot/bowl....pretty lame. Being a Korean run establishment....you would think they would do Korean food better.  I've had better Korean food from a food court.  Way better Korean options in Vegas...even in the same plaza.  The positive, I did like the decor of the restaurant.  But overall our server was just awkward and really not that friendly or knowledgeable. Hiring teenagers who don't really care about their jobs is a bad idea for business. I have no plans to return. I was so us satisfied with the meal I went to go grab a snack elsewhere afterwards...",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,7,3,2,gBa6scyMBun_jm9lcM4Q3g
5503815,2015-02-26,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"Doh is okay. Sushi is kind of small, but the tapas are really good! Pork bulgogi and beef bulgogi tapas are my personal favorite. If you're a salmon lover like I am, unfortunately, there aren't many specialty rolls with salmon. Just get nigiri or sashimi.

A couple of my friends and I came here on a Tuesday night around midnight and service was pretty good. Our server let us order so many rolls! Sometimes the tapas would take forever to come out and sometimes they came out fast.. But hey, it happens.

Last bit of advice. Definitely do not go here if you're on a budget and not ordering AYCE. There wasn't really anything on the menu that stood out and was AMAZING.",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,0,0,3,S1PIS91WZEA4MGYF8ngMqw

5529242,2013-12-31,16,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"If an AYCE sushi buffet simply offered fresh fish and all the usual suspects for rolls, it would have automatically been 3-4 stars a few years ago.  But fortunately for people in LV, this isn't the case anymore since so many spots have stepped up their game post-Goyemon.  

While the service and atmosphere are good, hot rice, some weird interpretations of what they think is ""Japanese"" and fusion missteps will be the biggest reasons I won't be a returning customer. 

Getting into details... 

- I know not to expect authentic cold, well seasoned sushi rice at AYCE but straight out of the cooker is bad.
  
- What they have on the menu as ""okonomiyaki"" is NOT that.  I've eaten hundreds of okonomiyaki and this was by far the whackest one of all.  Ketchup on top?  The consistency of a crepe?  Everyone sells a roll called ""something wrong"".  Maybe they should call this the ""something wrong pancake"".  

- They put a deep fried shrimp head into the miso soup.  Try having that fly well with a native Japanese (my wife).

- Amaebi was terrible.  They drenched the thing in sauce and then put tobiko on top.  I assume this was just their way of covering up something else.  

- Steamed pork belly was weird.  Koreans eat it this way?  That's like steaming high end bacon.

And finally, they had a sushi roll with peanut butter on it.  Not a typo.  My mind's telling me nooooo..but my BODY.  While I respect them for trying to push the fusion envelope, this was terrible.  Peanut butter, avocado, shrimp tempura with crab and fried coconut on top tastes like you would imagine it would.  I don't understand why they thought this would be good.  If they wanted to be extreme, make the whole roll that way.  Pork belly or beef would have been better choices to combine with PB than shrimp and then just put Cheetos all over the mofo.  

Tetsuro P. saw that I had checked in here and stopped in to say hello which was cool.  He asked if what they were doing was authentic and I just said ""no"" without going into any detail since we were right in front of the sushi chef.  

Not to say it was a complete loss, there were some good parts.  Their ""bomb"" which was wrapped in avocado was decent.  The waitress mainly recommended Korean dishes like bulgogi and their skewers which we skipped since we had plans to eat Korean the next day.  I also enjoyed their yellowtail jalapeno.  But it won't be enough for me to come here again.  I would go to Umiya (both Korean owned) over this any day of the week.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,20,11,2,NW0PMQl2v9CiVGLIWO0v9w

The service was awful.  Maybe if we were in a smaller group it would have been better but it felt like they were resentful that we were there.  

After taking our first order the waitress scolded my husband when he ordered another roll, she counted off how many we ordered and told us that it was a lot already.  Our group had at least 5 big dudes that can put whole sushi rolls away no problem, she made it pretty awkward every time we tried to order.  

Once the food got there most everything tasted good.  We had a few complaints with some of the food (tempura not fried all the way on multiple things) but I think the fact no one could consistently order food made it worse.  We kept having to flag our waitress over, and one point my sister in law had to go get the waitress who was standing around avoiding our eye contact.  

We were there for almost three hours.  We had fun chatting with each other but by the time we left no one felt like we had even eaten or eaten our money's worth.

5765718,2013-12-29,0,lnZKSuiE8c8_zYaLTZacmQ,"Yummy new Las Vegas AYCE sushi addition, this one also serves Korean style tapas!  The sushi and sushi rolls quality is excellent, with excellent service to boot.  Come later, as the place gets really busy in prime time and you'll get better, faster quality service when there are fewer customers there.  They're open until 3am, so there's time to get hungry so you can indulge.  Highly recommend ordering half rolls so you can enjoy different varieties.  

The place is very big and located in the original area of Chinatown before it expanded several city blocks; plenty of parking too as it shares a large parking area with the shopping center.  Besides sitting at the bar, there's plenty of tables.  The waitress came around quite often to make sure they get in all your orders, or you can sit at the bar and directly tell the sushi chef what rolls you want.  Interestingly, they do serve sashimi, but it's one of the ones that you're only limited to 3 pieces.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have quite a bit of non-sushi items such as galbi, okonomiyaki, noodles, fried rice, kalbi, dynamite, gyoza, calamari, and skewers to name a few though some you're limited to ordering one per customer.  

As for sushi and roll choices, there's quite a lot of variety and they don't skimp on having originals.  Besides standard sushi rolls, there's a full page of specialty rolls and signature rolls, which I had thought was the same thing but I guess I'm wrong.  I ordered the Something Wrong (soft shell crab with shrimp with salmon, tuna, and dakon on outside), WTH Roll (soft shell crab and cucumber with tuna, spicy crab and jalapeno on outside), and Rock & Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacado with cucumber wrap).  They were all covered in sauce but were really good, especially considering it was an AYCE place.  I also ordered a couple of gizzards, galbi, miso soup, sashimi, salmon sushi, and urchin.  I didn't have room for dessert but they have various ice cream including tempura ice cream and something called banana dream.  

The price is $25.95 per person (for 60 min), drinks are extra.  Definitely worth going to especially if the other AYCE places have a long wait!",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,2,0,5,TGjFZRHof8uISqSXz9jK4Q

SERVICE: -4 stars
-----------------------
I arrived here with a party of 6, and despite half the floor being completely empty, they wouldn't seat us. My group and 2 other, different groups not with us - both with 5 people - sat in the waiting area whilst a good 50% of restaurant remained empty. Doh has a policy whereby the large number of 2 and 4-seater tables can't be manipulated in any way to accommodate waiting guests. They would rather turn people away than move a table and some chairs a few feet. I'm not making this up. Go for yourself and see.

Another confusing and LOL-worthy part of eating here were the sequestering proceedings. What are ""sequestering proceedings"" you might ask? Well if you order a la carte at the same table where someone orders AYCE, you can't sit next to them. NO MATTER WHAT. The server lady rearranged our table and wouldn't let us sit next to who we wanted. Evidently she'd rather ensure they don't lose a couple razor-thin slices of week-old tuna to an unscrupulous diner than have happy guests.

Finally, we round out the equally horrible and puzzling ""service"" at Doh with how they take orders and run food. They have a single person capable of making decisions about anything and a ton of runners. So it's one expediter-server-combo-grand-pubah and 6-8 runners. The runners can't (or don't?) take orders. They can't answer questions. ""I don't know let me check"". All they do is clear tables, refill water, and run food.

I didn't order AYCE, but the single expediter-server lady was running all over the place and couldn't keep up. She was taking orders from every table, expediting back @ the sushi bar, and responding to questions and requests for more from AYCE customers. Oh and did I mention the AYCE is 60 minutes? It is.

AESTHETICS / AMBIANCE / CLEANLINESS: 2 STARS
-----------------------
The space is actually pretty nice. The waiting area is ample, the dining area is clean, and it's cool how the sushi bar takes a center stage at the very back wall of the restaurant. It's a really nice layout. So with the unfortunate seating policy explained above, why 2 stars? I went to the bathroom, that's why. If you told me that it's not really a bathroom and more or less a purgatory for paper towels waiting to go to landfill Hell I wouldn't argue. It might be.

FOOD: 3 STARS
-----------------------
If you're into American-style sushi - rolls with all kinds of fried things and mayonnaise and cream cheese and sauces - Doh is a great place. I'd been here once before and had a decent experience; they do rolls like this well.

If you like sashimi or nigiri and more traditional sushi, Doh is not the place for you. On 1/9 I had (2) orders of yellowtail sashimi, and it was nothing more than AYCE nigiri slices in a pile. I've had sashimi at probably at least a half-dozen other places in the last year in Vegas, and a single order of yellowtail at any one of these places (808, Sushi Loca, Ohjah, and Sumo Sushi 2 off the top of my head) was at least as big - if not bigger - than 2 orders @ Doh. And it's not like you're getting something really special here - the fish I had was obviously on the wrong side of fresh.

CONCLUSION (-4+2+3= 1 star)
-----------------------
Doh is a great place for dining parties of 4 or fewer who enjoy American sushi and have a high tolerance for silly seating rules and crappy service. If you like nigiri and sashimi or are with a party of more than 4 people, go somewhere else.",bRZ8lsO2yDVRTvOkC7nX1w,1,0,1,xDhvqwwJbMyOqQTcJDJMXg
