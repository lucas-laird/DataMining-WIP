After being seated, our waitress came, and she was quite friendly.  It took about 30 minutes before we got our food - longer wait than we expected. It seemed there was a hold-up of some sort in the kitchen though because once the food started coming out, a lot of food was coming out. We had onion rings for appetizer, and it was delicious. The batter was light and crispy, and the sauces were very good.   My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium rare, and he really enjoyed it.  I was a bit boring and got the ultimate cheeseburger, medium well (since I'm pregnant and shouldn't eat anything too rare). The waitress asked if I wanted any toppings for my burger, and among other things, I requested extra pickles on my burger. When the burgers came out, it was obvious to me that the waitress wrote down that I asked for ""extra"" pickles because my burger was loaded with pickles - a good sign that she listened, and the chefs made the food as ordered. While I wished I would have ordered my burger medium, it was still quite good. The cheese flavor was quite strong, but overall, a very good burger.  Perhaps it's because I'm pregnant, but the sweet pickles were delicious - I had to ask for an extra side of pickles and actually finished all of that too. The burger was quite large for me, and after eating half of the burger, I took the buns off the other half so I can finish my dinner without overstuffing myself.  Overall, great place.

39953,2017-05-16,2,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Let's just say to start that I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. This restaurant however, shows some serious irony as to how he shows himself on television when it comes to running a kitchen. 

To start we had the kettle chip nachos. These had a nice flavor and the meat was tender. 

We ordered the Hog Burger and the Ultimate Cheeseburger with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries. We ordered the ultimate cheeseburger medium rare and the hog burger well. We were told that the burgers take at least twenty minutes to come out since they are made fresh to order. We had no problem with the wait. 

The burgers arrived.... the ultimate cheeseburger was cooked perfect and had great seasoning and flavor in the first bite... the next bite and the rest ended up tasteless and boring. The cheese even lacked flavor. 

The hog burger, that was just under cooked. When getting to the middle of the burger the pork was cold, mushy and well... was just raw. 

When we brought it to the attention of the waitress, now this is where it gets good, her response was, ""Well that is the type of pork it is."" We showed her that the middle was cold and raw and she continued by saying, ""The chef says that it is the type of burger that no matter how long you cook it the meat stays red and that the center doesn't cook all the way, that it is the way it should be."" I tried not to laugh. Kitchen Nightmares flashed in my head and I could picture Gordon Ramsay saying,""You bloody idiot"". 

The sad part is this restaurant bares the name of Gordon Ramsay a man who prides himself on how food is prepared and consistency of what comes out of his kitchens. I am just hoping that serving raw pork is not what his chefs think is best for his customers. 

In this case they should be embarrassed.",xthGkll8Xjrx_fIFcw-Zxg,3,0,2,gYDJ7poO6kCLUrL-U9NfTA

Menus were waiting, and within 5 minutes we had water and placed our orders (Tandoori Chicken and the Hells kitchen burger, plus an order of the parmesan fries).

I had some uninvited guests in the form of stone/broken chicken bone spec. When asked about it to the waiter he was kind enough to send his manager to speak to us and imagine what, I was told that these kind of things can be possible and sounded so obvious.

My question would be, who would have been responsible if I broke my tooth trying to chew that bone? Gordon Ramsay or his manager? 

Before I was assigned my table, I saw almost all tables having fries so I thought it might be the best item in the menu. I think it should have been named as wedges instead of fries.

Highly recommend the food and beers.

Unfortunately, I had to give Gordon Ramsay Burger only 1 star due to the service. It was not good, specifically one person. The actual service was good once a tall bartender named Michelle helped my girlfriend and me. The other bartender named Petey was solid, too.

Eric was a total jerk. He was very condescending and rude. It seemed as if he was unhappy to be at work and it was an inconvenience to serve my us. He was making rude comments about a prior customer to us. Uhhh, it was tacky.

Topping it off, Eric was extremely disrespectful and sexist to the girl bartender. The constant barrage of talking down towards the girl bartender was such a turn off. My girlfriend and I decided to leave after paying our bill, heading over to Heart Bar for drinks instead.

If Eric had a better attitude towards us and his co-workers, we would have stayed. Hopefully this was just a circumstance on which he was having a bad day. It still doesn't excuse the chauvinistic and disrespectful attitude directed at women our entire meal.

I will definitely be back for the food and beers, but not if Eric is working. Well, I could handle it, but no chance my girlfriend would want to be served by him ever again.

While I had high hopes for this place, I got to say, I was really disappointed.   I strolled up on a Friday afternoon, a little after 12:45pm  to place a take out order, as I was staying at PH and just wanted to grab something and take it up to my room.    The girls up front were friendly and eager to help, but seemed to be having a problem with swiping their cards and being able to log in to take my order.   They went back and forth between 2 different machines and called over like 3 different people to try.   Eventually they got it figured out and took my order.   I ordered onion rings, (asked for an extra cheddar ranch) and a burger cooked medium rare.   She repeated my order, but neglected my request for an extra ranch, so I kindly asked if she got the extra ranch part.   She said ""Oh yah, don't worry""  MMMMMMoK.  So I pay for my order and she tells me it'll be 30 minutes.   I was a little surprised, but was fine with that, hoping that since it was just a single burger and a side that it may come closer to the 20 minute mark.    It's now a few minutes before 1:00pm.    I go off and gamble in the casino a bit and come back at 1:30 thinking that the order should be ready.   I go back to the counter and ask the girl if my order was ready.    She tells me to wait on the side and she'll go check.   She goes off in the back and comes back a minute later and is just having a good time with her friends up there.   She's helping other customers and then talking story again with her co-workers, having a great time.   All the while, I'm just standing there.  5 more minutes go by and I go back up there and kindly ask if she found out if my order was ready because she clearly had no intention of letting me know what's going on.   She tells me ""oh yah, they're checking on it"".   Oooooooooook, well you could've at least told me something.    Another 5 minutes go by and now I'm just starving already.   Finally after 50 MINUTES, the girl comes up with my food like nothing ever happened.   She tells me thank you and is about to walk away.   I ask her is the extra cheddar ranch in there? and she tells me ""Oh, did you want an extra one?""   Uhhhhhh yes please, I already had to ask for it twice when ordering, why not one more time right?    I mean is that a difficult request to get correct?    She gladly gets it for me and I'm on my way back up to grind!    I'm all excited when I get back to my room thinking this meal is going to be hot and delicious......NOT!    No joke guys/gals, the burger and onion rings were not even warm.   Seriously, not even warm at all!   Oh and my burger was almost cooked well done.   On the flip side, Gordon's onion rings are BOMB (even when cold)!    The burger though was super disappointing.    Obviously because it was room temperature and over cooked, but it was also under-seasoned too.   Sooooooo disappointing.   

I thought about calling down and letting a manager know about it, but was just over it already.  We went through our apps, sides, and steaks in less than 50 minutes at Gordon Ramsay Steak earlier in the week, and it was amazing.   The Burger joint.......not so much.

We came with high hopes and left extremely disappointed after the service we received. We both have worked in the service industry for years so maybe we were a bit critical but this bordered on ridiculous.

After 12 minutes of being seated, our server 
greeted us with ""Did you decide what you want yet?"" 

Not a hello, not a ""welcome, have you been helped?""..poor server looked bored and tired. With an unapproachable demeanor she made us and apparently her other tables look a little hesitant to ask questions. We ordered water and cocktails, but our water glasses were empty for 25 minutes and cocktails didn't arrive until our food did. 

Appetizers arrived briefly, chips and curry were slightly cold but good. 

A whole 45 minutes later our burgers arrived. The meat was delicious and the flavors mixed perfectly, but the server never checked up on us after we started eating. Server was no where to be found when we wanted some limes, and only saw her maybe twice the whole evening. 

We had to remind her several times to refill our water, and at the end of the meal when we asked for a box she looked at me as if I spoke to her in an alien language. 

If you want to truly experience Gordon Ramsay: try the steakhouse and their amazing beef Wellington and ask for Victor, he will treat you like a proper server should and make sure your experience is worthwhile.

After waiting for so long we just wanted some water. There was a bar right next to the cashier with a Gordon Ramsay background so we asked for water. Surprisingly the person who worked there needed an ID to give us water so my aunt showed an ID and she said that she would not give us the water until we back away from the bar, so we did. Once the table was ready we went in and ordered drinks and food. I never knew I would enjoy the drink more than the food.

We ended up getting 3 regular ones which one contained a long piece of hair which couldn't have been ours for sure and another with no mushrooms and with onions. We politely told the waitress that the order was wrong and that there are no mushrooms. She then started raising her voice saying she ""sees the mushrooms inside"" and we opened up the burger showing her there are none.

The just fries and the mushroom poutine came out first. The fries was deliciously crispy and lightly salted. I wasn't a big fan of their curry ketchup nor the Chipotle ketchup. The mushroom poutine was so bland! All of the toppings, and honestly had no flavor at all. Our waiter made no deal at all about taking it back and the manager came out to apologize and ask if he could get us anything else, so we asked for the sweet potato fries. Ommgggg. They come with a vanilla powdered sugar with its own shaker. SO BOMB. We ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and it came out at the same time as the truffle Parmesan fries. No words. The meat was juicy and just as I ordered, medium well. The chunk of avocado was perfectly ripe and had no imperfections. The avocado sauce it had was full of flavor. The bun was perfectly toasted and soft. The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing!! Bursting with flavor, perfectly crispy! We ended our meal with the chocolate creme brulee shake. Wow. Speechless. The chocolate shake was rich,decadent. I don't even like chocolate ice cream but wow. Our ending total was $68, so for the average person it is pricey, but honestly worth it. The customer service was incredible and I hope they continue to treat every customer the way we were treated.",p-hgqJve04p67p8_rPHY3g,0,0,5,LTBcaQ9LzB_orELceUcJpA

I ordered the farm house burger. I really wanted the fried egg. I asked for my burger to be medium rare - basically red in the middle. It came more medium, pale pink the center. The burger was very tasty and well constructed. 

My husband had the jalapeño burger. He ordered his burger medium. It came closer to medium rare. He felt there was too much jalapeño for him.

We also had the sweet potato fries. These were the best sweet potato fries! They were perfectly cooked and dusted with powdered sugar.  

We also ordered the Oreo shake with 1/4 creme brûlée. That was the right amount of creme brûlée without it being overpowering. The shake was too thick for straws so we spooned it up. Delicious!

Service was very good. Our server was prompt and just attentive enough. Overall, it was a little spendy for burgers but very good.",i8Z33EfHmMRwoYH7XP8gCg,0,0,4,YOMhJAn_YB-xzLzFE8fVaA

THE GOOD:

1. Line moved quickly. We took under 10 mins at 7.30pm to get a table. 

2. Whatever ketchup they used was awesome!

THE OK:

1. Service was slow. 

2. Food was ok. I ordered the Forest Burger, which had mushrooms, cheese and duck bacon. Bacon tasted good. Beef pattie was tough unfortunately, and the mushrooms were overlooked little rubber tires. I asked for lettuce wrapped and they were great with that. So that was good. But the food was forgettable. Wouldn't come back. 

3. Husband ordered The Farmhouse Burger. He tells me it was a 7/10 so that is good!

3. The fries were good. Not perfect, but good. Solid effort. 

THE BAD:

1. My biggest complaint was the ambience and NOISE!!!! Good grief, if I wanted my ears to bleed I would have gone to a frikken Iron Maiden Concert. There is No carpet anywhere and the noise just resounds to the point where you have  to SHOUT to be heard. I am in the audiology industry and 85 dB is where hearing loss begins to occur as a result of noise damage, and I clocked an average of 83dB in this restaurant. So damn loud to the point of super uncomfortable. Just bad form Gordon. 

2. TVs were broken down and not playing- kind of added to the vibe of lack of care. 

All in all, for the price, I wouldn't come back due to the noise and lack of ambience. For my money, I'd go elsewhere.",Fg4EKJdYdo5OVVVAyKlSMw,1,0,3,iqXPcrEJBC82nyKMOcHBuA

I've finally got a chance to try it. Typical wait but much shorter(about 20 minutes). When we were finally greeted by the host and brought inside It was empty! There were at least 10 tables that were open so I don't understand what the wait was about. When we finally sat down the waitress took forever to come take our order. When she finally did we ordered a 'Hells kitchen burger' and truffle fries. The burger took awhile to come and when it did it was the wrong burger! They gave us the ultimate cheese burger! When we told her it was the wrong burger she didn't ask if we wanted a new one made she took another 10 minutes to go get the rest of the toppings and came back with a plate of it. She gave us a small plate with roasted tomatoes, avocado, and a cup of aioli sauce as if she was saying 'here make ya own damn burger.'

1209825,2018-01-01,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Best burger I have ever had in my life, period! As a die-hard In-N-Out fan, I used to view Burger as a fast and convenient eat. After trying Gordon Ramsay Burgers, it totally changed the way how I used to perceive Burgers, I had never thought Burgers could be this delicious. I was totally awed by their creativity in combining so many different ingredients to make each burger so unique and delicious. This is not only making a burger, but this is also making an art! 

During my stay in Vegas, I had the opportunities to try the following:

1. Farmhouse Burger(Rating 5/5)-The bun which grilled over the apple wood has a slight sweet taste to it and combines so well with beef, cheese,duck bacon and egg. This is a very traditional style burger can be served in many places, but the way Gordon Ramsay does it and the ingredients used making it THE BEST!

2. Lobster and Shrimp Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pickled vegetables, aioli combined with the lobster and shrimp patty was incredible. You get the taste of the sweetness and sourness of the pickle vegetables and the ocean taste of the shrimp and lobster all in one bite. The only downside is that the shrimp flavor overshadowed the lobster.

3. Hog Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pork patty combined with bacon tasted very juicy, tender and crunchy at the same time and the pickled cucumbers gives a slightly sour taste. Very very good.

4. Just Fries(Rating 5/5)-The potatoes they used were so fresh, clearly hand cut, not frozen and were fried perfectly. It comes with two different sauces: traditional tomato sauce and the spicy tomato sauce, both you can tell easily are home made and both taste are OUT OF THIS WORLD when you dip in the fries. I have never had any fries this delicious before.

The price is significantly steeper than a fast food chain like In-N-Out or Shake Shack, but I believe the quality and the taste made it worth every penny. 

I sincerely wish Gordon Ramsay Burger can be opened in LA one day. I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again.",oYBUPV6D0aqWCfcQD66sdA,0,0,5,0kLo6tE_jVsImGBpIl4Kuw

We walked over to Planet Hollywood and we saw there was no line here at 6pm. My gf was craving a burger and had always wanted to eat here, soooooo off we went. There was a wait of 5 minutes to which we avoided by sitting at the chef's table. Normally we love to sit at the chef's table, but this table was different. We sat right next to where the servers roll the silverware. So the staff would dump the silverware into the bucket and it was like nails on a chalkboard over and over again. We did our best to ignore it, but it was tough for sure. We looked back outside and there was now a line of 20 people! 

The benefit of sitting at the chef's table is you get to see all the food as it comes out. In addition there is plenty of staff there to help if you need more drinks, items or just have questions. When our server greeted us, he immediately let us know there was a 30-40 minute wait for food. We decided to chance it and order food possibly missing a few minutes of the show. Plus at most places they over estimate those times to cover themselves, usually it's half that time. 

We decided to go w/ their specialty burger of the day, to which they only make a certain amount of. I'm not sharing what that is due to not knowing if they only serve it particular days of the week, certain months or if it's a one time thing. I wouldn't want to get your hopes up. In addition to that burger we ordered the 'Hells Kitchen' burger - asadero cheese, roasted jalapeños, avocado, roasted tomatoes, jalapeño aioli

We kept watching food come out and hoping it was ours. It was starting to close in on that 30-40 minute mark. We hadn't see our server since dropping off our drinks and taking our order. Like magic he appeared when the food arrived. To which I quickly asked for the check. The manger on duty came to us to apologize for the wait and ask if we needed anything else. I informed her of the lack of attention our server gave as we sat there and how our waters weren't refilled during the time we got them until the time we got our burgers.

Once we started digging into these burgers, we realized it was worth the wait. Typically it can be hard to wow me w/ a burger at a particular price, but maaaaaaaaaaan were these burgers good! The specialty was $25 and the Hells Kitchen burger was $16. Both well worth the wait and price. 

If you are craving a burger on the strip, def check this place out! Just make sure you get a table and not the chef's table.",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,4,2,4,poWpRjh-TgxUHXUe1B2M2w

The burgers themselves are pretty good too. The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and balanced whereas The Crown burger I found to be over seasoned and a bit bland otherwise. The burger buns stand on their own though. They're soft and pillowy but also sturdy and soak up the burger juices without falling apart. They're buttery and have a good flavor from the sesame seeds. A perfect bun really.

The fries are pretty blah. I've had better many places. I like my fries crisp on the outside and soft in the middle and I feel like these lack a bit on the outside crispiness. The poutine is OK if you like mushrooms, though I've had better back home.

If you are in Vegas, go to Gordon Ramsay Burger. PLEASE!! My friend and I each got a different burger. I got the bleu cheese burger, she got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Get hers. The Hell's Kitchen burger was so freaking delicious!!! Mine was great, but I really can't get over how good hers was!

The burgers are so juicy. We both ordered ours medium well, hers actually came out over cooked, well done, and was still juicy. We later learned that if you tell them that, they'll get you a new burger within minutes. Our server seemed pretty bummed that we didn't tell her sooner. So please note that. They really care that you enjoy your food. 

I also enjoyed that you can keep the menu as a souvenir. I initially thought it was a little cheap for a Ramsay establishment to have laminated paper menus, until she said that, then it all made sense. 

If you're hungry, I'd go another day. It takes around 20 minutes for the burgers to come. And they're pretty hearty, so I'm not sure if I'd load up on appetizers. You know what you can eat better than I. 

Also, I must stress to get the truffle fries!! It comes with their house ketchup AND a truffle aioli. We actually added the aioli to our burgers and it took them up a million notches! Do it. You won't be sorry!!! This is coming from someone who dislikes mayonnaise, it's so good!!! And you can literally see chunks of truffle inside. Totally worth it.  

I will point out that burgers and fries are separate. Entries don't come with sides, but the burgers are so good they really can stand alone! I'll be back the next time I visit to try another sandwich. I know it'll be worth every penny!!",zip1LlpCmUMoqDkihglydQ,1,0,5,QgsvPTz3A1lcTCKywP4AqQ

Despite having been a life-long fan of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows like Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, and the F-Word, I've never actually visited one of his restaurants, so on my recent visit to Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Burger was the place to go! Located in Planet Hollywood, the place has a casual ""sports-bar"" vibe, along with an open kitchen, and there were people of all different ages and group sizes eating at this busy restaurant. We started our meal with the parmesan truffle fries, which came with a spiced ketchup and truffle aioli on the side. I didn't find the fries particularly special (there was a distinct lack of truffle aroma/flavor), but the truffle aioli was chock full of amazing umami unctuousness, though the ketchup was just dominated by sweetness.

And then what we came for--the burgers! The Hell's Kitchen burger was a must-order, and it came with melted asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno aioli, and avocado. Plenty of fire and spiciness indeed (and the burger itself was nice and juicy), but otherwise, the flavors of the burger weren't all that interesting, and the bun turned out to be overly greasy with butter. I much preferred the Forest burger, which came with salty tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula, and duck bacon. The flavors of this burger were very umami (thanks to the mushroom, cheese, and bacon), and the combination with the refreshing arugula worked very nicely! Again, however, the bun was way more greasy than necessary.

The burgers at Gordon Ramsay were good, but I can't say that they were the best I've had or necessarily worth the celebrity-chef price tag. I won't be in a rush to come back, but perhaps some of Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants in Vegas would be worth a try!",R7L6Fz8_SJuPJx3TqwzfTA,1,0,3,vxmUiItsmLLVDI8O9FlLOw

My waitress asked how I wanted my burger done, and I said well done. I don't like pink in my burger-- it grosses me out. I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. I also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. The cocktails are very strong! And yummy.

In less than 4 minutes my burger and fries came out. My burger looked delicious, until I bit into it. So raw, I could mush it (all I thought in this moment was that the cow was literally walking bc it was so rare, clearly I am obsessed with Ramsay). However, the ingredients were definitely fresh, the bun was perfect. The avocado was so huge, it was impossible to eat my burger without making a mess. So I mushed the avocado and then put it on my burger. No big deal, because it was a delicious and generous amount of avocado. The fries were a bit dry, somewhat crunchy, needed some salt, but tasted good once I dipped them in ketchup. You get a bunch of the French fries to share ($11).

I ate what was brown enough. The waitress said the manager took care of my burger which was really generous. I would come back for sure. But would probably choose a different burger and hopefully they make it well done next time I'm in Vegas.",Gbf7vVRZ6_FFltnExifqdA,4,0,3,siqmHxSNvHN334YFqPkx3A

When we passed by on our most recent visit and saw that it got rebranded to Gordon Ramsay Burger, we were a little surprised, but it makes total sense seeing as how GR seems to be taking over the strip with new places.

The menu has been revamped. There are definitely new items, and there aren't Total Rewards discounts anymore. The shakes have also been redone so that they aren't just named by numbers anymore. All that being said, the quality of the food is just as good as it was. Juicy, medium rare burgers with heapings of mouthwatering toppings that will just barely fit into your mouth.

Farmhouse Burger. Still our classic go-to. A juicy burger topped with bacon and a fried egg. You know, just in case the burger itself wasn't enough protein for you. The bacon has been upgraded from duck bacon to mangalitsa bacon, which we're told is like the kobe beef of pork. What's mangalitsa, you ask? Google it. You won't be sorry.

Forest Burger. This one offers up more greens in the form of arugula and 'shrooms. Duck bacon still comes into play here though, so don't let the name fool you into thinking this is just made of rabbit food.

Just Fries. Because sometimes, you just want to be fries. Thick cut fries served with two sauces. One reminded me of a curry-like sauce and the other was more a traditional ketchup with a kick.

Our visit landed us here on a Wednesday evening about 4pm & we waited 5 minutes for a table.
Appetizers looked amazing- especially their Cheddar Ale soup (which I really wanted to try $9) but- it didn't offer options for different portions. If there was a cup portion- I'd be all over it. Maybe next time.
I really wanted to try Bangers & mash... but, kept scoping the menu til it caught my eye- Foie Burger!! How often do your tastebuds land on this?!

Foie burger: Foie gras spread; Chevrè (goat milk cheese); frisée; port wine aïoli. I had to cut this burger in half- not that it was some huge gigantic thing... but, I wanted to see how it was layered. I'm neurotic this way, pardon me.

Foie gras spread on both buns- optimum juices flowed beneath burger patty! It took me a quick one to realize what caught my tastebuds attention! It was the Chèvre! I really don't like goat milk- but, it wasn't slathered thick at all.... and I was actually dealing with it well enough to eat every single bite of this burger! Super proud of myself.

The order of truffle parmesan fries comes w/ 2 condiments- ketchup w/ Tabasco sauce and truffle aïoli (you'll see flakes of truffle). Servers were kind enough to bring the curry AND chipotle ketchup too! That curry ketchup blew my mind! So glad these fries are steak cut!

1454820,2018-02-01,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"So this week I am in Vegas for 2 days for my daughters roller derby game. My 2nd time in Vegas, my daughters 1st. We arrive at our #Airbnb which is 20 minutes from the strip at 4pm. I've been driving since 10 or 11am and at this point I am #HANGRY. So we start going back and forth about where to eat and not steer away from our #Whole30 ways. All of a sudden it was like a lightbulb went off. Wifey and I were like BUMP THAT!!! Where's Gordon??? ""I want a burger""!!!

So we head over to the strip get to the restaurant and of course, there's a line from the door well into the casino. However, because we were only a party of 3 we didn't have to wait in that line. We did have a 45 minute wait time. So we walked around for a bit then came back after 30 minutes and ordered drinks at the bar. I look at the drink menu (which is a tablet) the bartender hands me and like a jerk, I start looking at the list of beers. First off, I hardly ever order a beer in my home state. It's a rule for my family, if you're out of town you do not order something you'd ordinarily get at home; if you do you are a jerk! 

Anyway, I ordered the Honey Tennesse Jack Daniels peach cocktail for me and wifey and when I say we were so happy with those drinks I ordered 4 more for myself (in my mind). But I needed to eat and I was conflicted because everything sounded so good. Plus I wanted that seafood burger and the Anniversary burger so I got both and a poutine.
I ordered it the way chef recommends and so glad I did. So flavorful and perfect portions. My only critique would be the seating booths are slightly too low, I felt kind of awkward at the table. Other than that the staff was great, warm a personable. We enjoyed every bite and will be back everytime we are in Vegas. #BaptisteClan",L025EBDucOsURCzTokiKKg,1,1,4,Z5HoagEnQMcXenYxTR69ZA

1467739,2017-07-19,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"After watching the Bruno Mars concert, the wife and I headed back towards our hotel and stumbled on this gem of a restaurant inside the PH. It was about 11pm and didn't expect to wait as long as we did. I should have known better, this was Vegas! We stood in line for about 45 minutes before we got seated. Took off one star for this experience. They have a dedicated line for couples and trios; larger parties skip the line and head straight to the hostess for seating. Why penalize the smaller parties. When we got to the front of the line, we counted three parties of six that were seated before us. How about clearing one or two couples in between seatings for the larger parties to make it equitable?

We got seated and proceeded to order. I went with the cheeseburger with bacon and egg and the wife went with the one with arugula. And some fries. In about 5 minutes, a runner came with a plate of tritip nachos. We didn't touch it and waited for our waiter. Asked him what it was and he immediately realized it was wrong. To our surprise, he took the plate away. Why didn't he just leave it? It's not like he could have served it to another party? He came back a minute later and offered it to us no charge. It was excellente! Found out later that it was intended for the trio of drunk girls next to us, to which we had some good conversation.

The burgers came out, and it was perfectly cooked. Medium as we ordered. These burgers were legit, the bun was great and the fixins were perfect. Great great burger. Bacon was thick and crispy and the egg yolk made a de facto sauce for the beef. Wish I came back. And surprisingly didn't feel too gross after. Fries - just ok. I've tasted some awesome fries and this here is lacking. (my baseline for great fries? Lazy Dog)

I give it 2 stars because about a year ago, I ordered the fish and chips dish (which I believe is no longer on the menu - and thank god for that!) and what I got was appalling.
That fish was so greasy, I literally had a POOL of grease on my plate. When picked up there was grease dripping from the fish. I made the mistake of taking a bite and had a real gag reflex. Yes it was THAT BAD. It felt like I got a big tablespoonful of oil in my mouth. I couldn't even swallow it. I had to spit it out into my napkin.
For someone who was seen so often yelling at other restaurant owners about greasy fish and chips (on Kitchen Nightmares), the guy should go taste the version his own establishment serves. I think it takes special talent to get the batter that full of grease. 
Perhaps it was a fluke, but a dish like that should never leave the kitchen at ANY restaurant.
Or maybe that's why the dish is no longer on the menu...?

We were 4 people at our table and nobody really liked their food very much. All other dishes ordered that day got very mediocre responses from our table. Anyway, we never went back after that.",x_eztqDB2mvZ5uTP5v3NUA,0,0,2,W35017na6HeelYp7lAIu5w

We waited in a 20 minute line. And i was getting nice and toasty by the front glass where the fire display was.

While youre in line, theres a touch screen menu you can scroll at. Pretty economical. There are tvs around, if you wanted to catch a game. 

We sat infront of the cooking line. It was amazing to see how efficient everyone was working and how fast food was getting expedited without losing quality.

We both werent super hungry, after eating all day. So we split a burger and app

We ordered the pork special. Pork burger wrapped in bacon for 18$ as recommended by our waiter, his favorite burger. I trusted him....and wish i went with my own intuition. It was good, dont get me wrong. But i felt i would have liked another burger much more.

Mushroom poutine: ive never had poutine and ive always seem ramsay go around the world poutine-ing this and that. So i was excited to try it out. I actually like it better than the burger. Definitely my favorite and most memorable. I went there sunday, and im sorry to say i cant remember the pork. And i love pork. Every single component in the poutine had its own tune. After awhile i started to disect it and try everything on its own(im such a brat foodie like that) and i wasnt disappointed. I could taste all of the ingredients put in. So much love into that poutine! And im sure it was prepped and reheated. Lol

I will definitely return and choose my own burger to my liking. And go for the poutine again. I wish i ordered another one to take home!

The burger was absolutely delicious and the meat almost melted in my mouth.

I'll admit I thought this place could be gimmicky but after a 40 minute wait in line plus an additional 30 minute wait for my food I was not disappointed! Got a counter seat looking into the chaotic kitchen. They were very busy (of course) but when I finally got my first item, the Creme Brulee Shake, I happily enjoyed sipping it! It was a very good shake as I could taste the Creme Brulee on the top but to be honest the actual chocolate shake underneath it tasted just like any other chocolate shake anywhere else. Next was the UK Burger which was very juicy. Juicy as in every bite I took of that meat patty was dripping of meat juice, not oil! What made it unique was they had some sort of sweet jam spread on it which balanced out well with the cheese. And finally the winner of the meal was the amazing Parmesan Truffle Fries! Now if you don't order this you'll be missing out, these fries are delicious but it is that truffle sauce that just blows it out of the water! Each time I dipped a frie into that sauce and took a bite I felt like I was melting into a sea of buttery truffle goodness.

Came here with a group of friends after driving in from LA. Got to the restaurant at 4pm and was seated immediately. When you first look at the menu you might think the burgers are pricey, but each burger comes with a considerable amount of beef.

I ordered the Forest Burger for myself and our table got the Parmesan truffle fries and sweet potato fries to share.  The Forest Burger comes with mushrooms, tremor cheese, arugula, and duck bacon.  This is my definition of a gourmet burger! The combination of all the ingredients was perfect; no item dominated the other.  If you aren't super hungry, sharing a burger is definitely reasonable, but be sure to ask for a knife to split the burger.

The Parmesan truffle fries are a MUST.  They might have changed up the way they serve this because the first time I ate here (maybe a year ago) it came with shoestring French fries, melted parmesan cheese, and truffles on top. My most recent trip, they came out with thicker pieces of fries, truffles, and shredded Parmesan.  Both times the fries were phenomenal and full of flavor.

Conversely, the french fries were too salty and were too crisp ( on the border of burnt). This ""gourmet"" burger and fries are over-rated and way overpriced. Plain old ketchup would have been more appropriate and less salty that the curry and chipotle mixed ketchup preparations they served with the french fries. I had to beg the waiter to come and provide a refill of my beverage...The place was a clip joint!

In and Out with its mass produced burgers and fries are much better prepared and their staff are more courteous.  I was very disappointed with the food and the service, the place was also very noisy, you couldn't hear your dining partner across the table.

1624683,2017-04-24,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"First of all, I HATE the wait process for this restaurant. If you are a party of three or more, you can submit your name and phone number and be called back. However, if you are only a two top, you have to wait behind some rope and get called in one table at a time. I'm sure this is so a crowd develops and sparks interest but it's really annoying to feel trapped in this line. The wait time we were quoted was way off...and not in our favor. There's nowhere to sit. You can't explore the casino while you're waiting. You have to just stand in the line at their mercy. It would be better if you could at least make an Open Table reservation and the overflow had to wait outside to attract a crowd but this line is your only option. We waited at least 45 minutes at 9:00 on a weeknight! 

Anyway...my other con to this restaurant is it kind of smells like a dirty rag at the entry way. Like that dirty bar smell that you sometimes encounter. I was SHOCKED by this two years ago when I first dined here and I was even more shocked that it still had this odor two years later. Very disappointing and it should be taken care of. Not up to Ramsay standards (that he prides himself in on TV) and his name is attached to this place. 

It is VERY loud in this establishment. It's totally open to the casino at the front and back of the restaurant so you have restaurant noise, casino noise, bar noise, television noise, music...on this particular day I had a migraine so I was really overstimulated. If you want ambiance and a private conversation...this is not the place for you! 

Our server was excellent. He noticed I wasn't feeling well. He sympathized with my migraine and even offered me Advil. He stooped down to our table to talk and take our order and I told him how much I valued his personality after our long day (we just returned from a 12 hour excursion). He was absolutely the star of this visit! He told us the burgers were running long and he would bring us our fries first. He was just so kind, attentive, efficient and great at his job. This establishment is lucky to have him and there should be more servers like him out there! 

They don't have Heinz ketchup here. Only homemade ketchup. For me, this was a major flaw. I just don't like the homemade ketchup. It doesn't taste anything like the flavor I enjoy from Heinz. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was ok. It wasn't particularly flavorful which is surprising  considering how much stuff is on it (jalapeño, roasted tomato, avocado...) My mom got the backyard burger which she said was delicious. We split fries. If I was feeling better I would say we definitely could have gotten away with an order of fries per person. I love french fries and the orders aren't THAT big. If you love fries and don't like to share them...go with one order per person. 

I wanted to love this place more than I do. My migraine, I'm sure contributed somewhat. They need to figure out that smell...and get some regular ketchup for those of us that prefer it. Stop forcing the homemade stuff on us! And please make Open Table available!",R0NPQEVtdE-3atyhMFt6PQ,4,0,3,Ri5uToC0mrc17P38lwpZhQ

This was clearly one of the best hamburger places that I have been too. I am more into a ""blue collar"" type of hamburger experience with traditional toppings and lots of beefy flavor. NOTE: so being from the Carolina's I love the Carolina-style hamburger but 1) I wouldn't even try getting this out of the Carolina's and 2) I wouldn't get a upscale Carolina-style hamburger (would be a oxy-moron concept).

The service and all the food was very pleasant and professional. My wife and I really enjoyed out lunch here. Highly recommend...  we almost went to Heart Attack grill but so glad we went here instead. 

What we had: 
Farmhouse Burger : dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg

It all started with me calling them to make reservations about a month in advance for July 3rd. I wanted to reserve a dinner for my family of 15. Everything went fine until they emailed me. The email said that because we have a large group, it's a minimum of $95 a person and we have to pay an estimated down payment ahead of time. I thought they must be joking. How can you bill someone a meal BEFORE they even eat it? Probably the most absurd thing is that even though it's $95 a person, they sent me a list of set menus that had a couple of three course meals for $70-80 each. That means pay $1500 up front? That means that every person has to have a drink? Well, we have 5 children a couple of my family members that don't drink.

So when I tried to talk to the ""Sales Manager"" Heather, she just so happens to be on vacation for the week. As popular as the Gordon Ramsay name is, I can't believe this is how they function when someone tries to book a party ahead of time. There's no way I'm going to pay money ahead of time for food we haven't ate and I can't believe people actually would. Even though I expect great food and great service, it's a people's business and all it takes is one person to have a bad day to ruin our experience.

We were also very excited to see poutine on the menu, as my husband is from the birthplace of poutine (Montreal) and GR could only make it better, right?

Wrong on both accounts.  The patty in our burger, although cooked medium, was dry and tasteless.  Now a medium burger is pretty hard to dry out!  It was as if they took gourmet ideas and plopped them on a little bit bigger (being generous) McD's patty and put GR's name on it to make people think they were getting something g special!

The poutine was equally disappointing.  The gravy was a VERY strong pepper gravy (some people might like... for me a bit too strong.)  But the biggest SIN was to hardly put any curd chees on it at all!  That's the best part of poutine, and we were left fighting over the tiny, tiny morsels of chees sprinkled throughout.  Curd cheese is CURDS of cheese!!

The burger comes with huge pieces of avocado and jalapeño aioli, which comes as a surprising (but tasty) kick. Everything was cooked to perfection and the burger itself just effortlessly melts in your mouth. However, I'm not a huge fan of their fries. Think thick-cut steak fries on the soggier side with no seasoning at all. Not even a pinch of salt or pepper - lacking some love, I'd say. Plus the curry ketchup was very much an acquired taste. The flavors just didn't mix well at all in my opinion. Skip the fries, but the Hell's Kitchen burger is a must.",7UhMMq-pUEcYq9UQ0-zbkQ,3,2,4,km_2o0DpA_1vgWyR-qBr9w

I think it comes down to fundamentals with a burger:  the preparation and arrangement of the components, the cooking of the burger, the presentation on the plate....those were all failures for 3 of the 4 dishes.  (One eater liked his Hells Kitchen burger).  Burgers were red-to-pink for medium-well!  And the pickles on one burger were all haphazardly centered in the middle so half the pickles had to be pulled off and the burger rearranged.  Minor quibble but we ARE talking about an $18 burger!  Bacon was soft and chewy on two burgers, and hard as a rock on another.  And the fries!  Just terrible.  Oversalted, and some strange ketchup/tabasco(?) combination, we left the fries alone.

I was trying to set realistic expectations for this place but it's really hard with a chef of this caliber in its name. For me, the burger was only alright. We got the forest burger and it was just too fancy for us. I guess sometimes simple is better, and this is definitely the case. The buns were really good and didn't look or taste like it came from a bag. The meat was well seasoned and cooked medium just like the way we liked it. Somehow the meat wasn't very juicy though. I wonder what the ratio of fat is in their patty...The part that threw me off was the cheese. In my opinion, the tremor cheese just doesn't go well with the burger. It tasted like goat cheese and I felt like it overpowered the burger. I was really surprised about the arugula though. It wasn't too bitter and actually went well with the burger. However, I still feel like normal green leaf lettuce would've been better. But I did really like the mushrooms which gave it a different change of texture. We also got the truffle fries and it was phenomenal. The truffle and cheese gave it a unique, creamy flavor that tasted best with the normal ketchup. Service here was great and our server was very attentive. To justify the price for just a burger I expected this to blow my mind away. This didn't happen today. If it wasn't for how good the fries were, I would've given this place 3 stars. I hope I just got the wrong burger and the others are actually very good.

The big thing with this place is timing.  If you go in off hours it's no problem.  During a regular dinner or lunch hour it's packed and there are lines out the door.  

Since it was an off time, I can't say if the service is always this good but on that day it was perfect.  We sat down with our menus, had the server there in minutes to take our drink orders.  They have lots of appetizers and stuff on the menu but since I never eat a lot I opted to just eat the burger and fries.  Think maybe they make their own buns or source them from some bakery because they didn't come out of a package.  The burgers were juicy and just the right amount of toppings.  Fries seemed like they might have been double fried, crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.

If you are a party of 2 you get to wait in a line and 3 or more you put in a reservation and get a text when your ready. So I waited in line for 30 mins even though they quoted 15 and the line was short. It goes REALLY slow. So I'm watching a bunch of larger parties getting seated before me.  When I complain about this to the overstaffed hostess stand, they explain that they have way more two top tables. This is a flat out LIE because they put many of them together to accommodate larger parties. Then after waiting a half hour, they break down a large table at the front with the sun blaring in to make four 2-top tables and offer it to us, after I complained about the wait and larger parties going before us. The four hostesses that were working didn't have enough sense to skip that question. You would think that between the four of them, that was a bad offer. Then they went down the line to offer that. 
So then we order the signature burger, but are told no substitutions. Come on Ramsey, don't be like that. Let us take off the lettuce, especially since they are little pieces.  
I will admit tho, the signature burger (once we removed the lettuce ourselves) was delicious. Short ribs with rib eye, and pickled onions were to die for!!!!!

The menu is built around gourmet burgers. I ordered the Forest burger and Parmesan truffle fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well with the Parmesan and truffle oil. It is enough for two to share as a side. The burger marinated well with the combination of mushrooms and tremor cheese. J was skeptical of trying the duck bacon since I am not a huge fan of bacon in general, but it complimented the burger itself, which was a thick patty. It was also topped with arugula and the sesame seed bun was toasted to a perfection and not too thick as to take away from the toppings.

I would definitely return to try one of the other burger options. The price point is decent considering it is a well crafted burger that will make you full.

The taste blends together too much. It's just a hot mess of meat and bread. They have few sauce selections. The house ketchup is too pungent, and the ranch is a cheese ranch, too much on the cheese flavor. Nothing fresh that cuts through the burger flavor.

I was going to eat-in but seeing the long line, I asked the hostess if I could get it to go, and hopefully, I could sit somewhere on the strip and eat it. I ordered the farmhouse burger and truffle fries. I was told that it would take 25min and that I could sit in the adjacent lounge. There was no space there because football games filled it up and I'm sure you have to buy drinks to sit there. I thought that I'd have nowhere to eat, so I asked if I could change my order to eat in and asked if there were seats for one. She said I could sit at the ""chef's table""-(stools facing the kitchen). While I waited, I took my Rubiks cube out and started to solve it. I noticed the worker stop doing what she was doing and watch me solve it. Afterwards, she gave me a high 5 and I got a fist bump from the chef. 

     The girl (Lydia) asked where I bought my cube and I told her if I could write it down. I had said that I bought mine from eBay when the first came out with stickerless 7x7 cubes for about $50. Now that more companies have been making them, the price is now $23 from www.cubicle.us, a company in upstate New York, which is good because you don't have to wait for it to come in the mail from China. She said she wanted to buy one for her sister or was it her daughter. I told her how I learned to solve it by watching how-to videos from a Prof. Arthur Benjamin, the creator of Mathemagic. I told her that I took a month to ""master"" the 3x3. and that I watched YouTube to learn the 4x4. I told her that you need to learn how to do centers with the 4x4, and if you know the 3x3 and the centers of the 4x4, then you can solve any sized cube.

     Next, the maitre d and I talked about how to solve it, and I told him that the night before, I went to Wahlburgers and drank to see how much is needed to slow me down. I said its more fun when you are drunk because now I have to think harder instead of solving it on ""auto-pilot"". I drank 3 drinks and still didn't slow me down much. He told me that I should eat now before my food gets cold. This was the best burger I've eaten yet. It's too bad I was still stuffed from the last night. I'm glad I decided to eat in. I ate half my burger the fries. The fries were great and was probably made with all natural truffle oil. I've bought a Perigord truffle once and I've bought artificial essence of black and white truffle that you mix with olive oil. After being halfway done, I stopped and played with my cube until I was able to eat again. Finally, I chatted with the chef and asked him if he had met the man himself. He told me that he his nothing like the Hell's Kitchen persona and that he is very mellow nowadays. I told him about how I love the UK version of Kitchen Nightmare, where he can curse, but it is more evidence that he cares. Check it out on youtube. I will try other burgers next time and I hope the chef there will go far in his career just like Marcus Wareing. I wish I knew the name of the chef. Lydia had told me, but I didn't hear her clearly. I also wished I learned the name of Maitre D'. I totally recommend this place and recommend sitting at the chef's counter.",njqCae7ttZ2gJtuzBo0pYw,0,0,5,DX7hPdrQX0MnAx3NyWFY4w

She estimated the wait at about 30 minutes, which turned out to be quite accurate. 

Our order taker-I hesitate to call him our server because he basically just took our orders-was clearly not interested in chitchat. His first words to us were ""are you ready for me?"" I can probably count on two hands how many words he spoke to us after that. We never saw a drink menu, which is apparently tablet-based because we saw other tables around us looking at it. We all ended up ordering iced teas, which was OK but we might have ordered something alcoholic...so basically they lost some of our business. 

Anyway, we all ordered burgers of some sort and sweet potato fries to share. To his credit, our order taker warned us that the burgers would take about 30 minutes, which again proved to be pretty accurate. Our burgers were good but the fries were not especially hot.

5 stars for some of the best food and best service I've ever received at a restaurant. I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan and this was my first time at one of his restaurants and I was very impressed.

The food was the shining star, as it should be. We had the hummus as an appetizer and W.O.W. It was probably some of the best - if not THE best - hummus I've ever had in my entire life, no exaggeration. After we finished the dish I immediately looked up Ramsay's recipe and I plan to make it very soon. Funny enough, neither of us ordered burgers and this burger joint. We had burgers for lunch so we were feeling something different. My friend ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca Sliders and I had the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad. Both were extremely good. And the burgers looked amazing. I really want to return again and try one. For desert, it was the Blood Orange Creamsicle. Tangy orange popsicle goodness with a creamy center. We also ordered drinks. I had the Skinny Screw and she had the Acai Lemonade. Again, very, very good.

Our waiter, Ryan, was the best. He was super personable and knew the menu extremely well so he was able to make some great recommendations on what to order. Since he seemed to be such a foodie we even asked him for a recommendation on where to go for breakfast the next morning and his recommendation did not disappoint (see my review for Mon Ami Gabi).

It's worth noting this place does not take reservations. You will have to wait in line to get a table. How long you have to wait just depends on the day and time you choose to dine here. We went on a weekday for a little bit earlier dinner and only had to wait about 15 minutes. But I have heard from others the wait can get up to 2 hours, so plan accordingly, particularly if you are catching a show afterward.

The hype is real and I highly recommend you add Ramsay's burger joint to your Vegas foodie ""to do"" list.",HFWckxypPmpvmWMURRo1rA,1,1,5,f82tTWzyJtbv2qOWzAgW2g

We started off with 3 kinds of fries - sweet potato fries, the just fries, and the truffle parmesan fries. The parmesan fries were hands down the best! And the sauces that came with were so good.

After ordering, burgers take about 30 minutes to come out, with the option of your fries coming out before or with your burger. 

My fiancé got the Hog Heaven which is a pork burger with BBQ pork and tons of other meaty toppings. Although he went in with a huge appetite, he could only polish off a little more than half. I ordered the Patriot Burger, which is a turkey burger with smoked Gouda, cherry chutney, spicy mayo and crunchy topping. I LOVED it, and after peeling off over half of the bun, I was totally able to finish mine. The fries were tasty, and we found it more than enough to share an order.

RECOMMENDATION: if you're going with a small party or even another guest, I would recommend getting two different burgers and splitting them. There are so many delicious options to pass up on! 

Truffle fries: a thicker cut fry sprinkled with parmesan cheese and comes with ketchup and another dipping sauce. (Perfect for sharing) They were perfectly cooked, meaning they weren't soggy or over cooked. The other dipping sauce had a touch of garlic to it which made the French fry experience that much better. 

Blue cheeseburger: Holy mother of flavors. Comes with blue cheese and manchego, fig jam, cider vinegar reduction and spicy mayo. From the first bite to the last, there is an explosion of flavor. The sweetness of the fig jam compliments the savory of the two different cheeses while the heat of the mayo gives it that extra kick that you didn't even know you needed. This is by far one of the best burgers I've ever had. 

Hell's Kitchen burger: more of a classic style burger with extra heat. We opted out of the roasted jalapeños but the jalapeño aioli was more than enough to bring the burger up a notch.",aXOkJO_X9IdiXiyjeCJ3tQ,0,0,5,GQHzQzIW0-Q_-vGZxvxctA

I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger, and it was sensational. Juicy, tender, and bursting with flavor. The figgy jam and cheese were an amazing combination. The bread was soft and delicious.

Walking by, there were a bunch of empty tables. And we were seated at one of them later. I never understand why places do that, is there not enough staff or does it take that long to seat people? 

Anyways on to the food:

Chicken wings (5+)- Prob the best damn chicken wings I've had in my life. The sauce was perfect. It was not a normal chicken wing but like a lollipop style where it's cut differently and the meat literally just falls off the bone. The blue cheese sauce is a must with it, my cousin wanted to opt out since he's not a blue cheese fan but he's so glad we got it on the side so he could try it & he was a fan. 

Blue Cheese Burger (4 stars)- This was my favorite out of the 3 that we had. I love blue cheese & ah fig jam brings the sweet & salty aspect of it. I've had better burgers so it's not quite 5 stars but def satisfied the craving. 

Hells Kitchen Burger (4 stars)- my second fav and others first. So I guess it's also all personal preference. This was a tasty burger though. 

Forest Burger (3.5 stars)- I found this one to be a bit dry. Thank goodness for the duck bacon which made the burger have flavor but as a whole nothing to write home about. 

Truffle Parmesan Fries (5+)- god damn these were good. You know how you order these and all the Parmesan eventually just falls to the bottom? Well this place knows how to do it right. Perfect seasoning on each fry & homemade dipping sauces (truffle aioli & homemade ketchup) were excellent!! A must order!

What is NOT GOOD are the sauces that accompany the fries. Ew. So nasty I don't get why these are something Gordon gets behind. The yellow one is waxy and tastes like lemon. Gross. It also looks like pudding. The red one is not ketchup. They don't have regular ketchup. Bottom line, I don't want to spend $20+ on a burger if there aren't good fries to pair it with and good sauces.

Compliments to our waiter, John. Explained the choices very well and made very good suggestions. Happened to also watch him find a package that another table left, picked it up and ran out the front after them to take to them. I had the Farmhouse burger. Didn't like the duck bacon but just removed it and enjoyed it without. I really liked the Parmesan truffle fries, husband didn't, he thought it tasted garlicky. He had the backyard burger and really liked it. It was more on the medium rare side and we asked for medium but overall good. Prices very reasonable.  The star for us was the dessert orange creamsicle- blood orange and a total surprise. I do get tired of similar desserts and this was a very pleasant ending to lunch.

2456917,2017-11-28,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Sorry for the long review, just thought I would explain everything that happened.  So I was flying from Iowa to Sacramento with an overnight stop in Las Vegas. Thought I would stop in at Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant and get a burger.  I got there around 5:00 pm on a Monday and there was no one in line. That was good for 1 star.  Sat down at the counter instead of waiting for a table.  GORDON, GORDON, GORDON!!!  What happened after that was a testament for not eating at the bar.  Ordered a drink, Captain Morgan and Pepsi (they don't have coke, mistake #1), was a little watered down or else Pepsi makes it taste funny.  Ordered the Forest Burger cooked medium and some fries.  Waited about 30 minutes before the burger arrived which is normal for this restaurant.  Ordered another drink just before my food came, Captain Morgan and Pepsi, that is even hard to say. No improvement in the drink, actually was more watered down than the first (mistake #2).  First bite, no pink, no flavor, no rush of ""Whoa, that tastes so good"".  Took a few more bites, no pink whatsoever in that overcooked burger (mistake #3).  The duck bacon was overcooked, but at least the bacon had some flavor along with the mushrooms and cheese.  I slow ate the burger waiting for someone to come over and ask me how the food was.  No one ever asked me how the food tasted or was it cooked right.  There were three of us customers sitting next to each other.  We all got to talking and we all had the same problem, overcooked food and no one asked us about the food.  Back to my situation, the bartender offered me another drink, I declined and said ""I'm good"".   About another 5 minutes later, the bartender finally noticed, which was about 25 minutes after I started eating and said, ""I see you are slowing down there buddy"".  Finally, I get to let them know about the food, which should have happened 3-4 minutes after I received the burger.  I let him know that the burger was overcooked, I still had only eaten about 2/3 of the burger, so it was there to be seen.  He asked, ""Was it cooked medium well"".  I raised my eyebrows and then he said, ""Oh, Well done, eh"".  He then let me know that he would get the manager.  The manager came over asked what the problem was and I proceeded to tell him the burger is way over cooked and had no flavor.  He said I should have let the server know that it was not cooked to my liking. I let him know that the server/bartender never came over and asked me about my food.  I told him, anyone, and I mean anyone, can cook a burger correctly the second time.  I let him know that I was not the only one here at the counter having this problem.  He apologized politely and left (mistake #4).  The bartender came back over to me and asked why I had not told him about the burger.  I let him know that I was waiting for him to ask me about the food and he argued with me that he had asked me earlier. Big Mistake #5!!!!   

So my lesson that I learned here was that bartenders are bartenders and not food servers. Don't eat at the bar.  Don't eat here on Mondays, as the part time chef works on Mondays, plus the chef needs to learn the difference between, rare, medium and well done.  Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant gets many 4 & 5 star reviews but not from me. FIVE MISTAKES for one customer, let's see.  How many stars is that worth!  I gave it one star because I got seated right away.  After that, all downhill as they say.  Oh wait.  The bill for the burger, fries and 2 drinks was $51.96.  They gave me a nickel back, so they gave me a penny tip back!!!  I left the nickel....will I be back or eat at a Gordon Ramsey establishment again...time will tell, but not anytime soon.

We came here not knowing what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.  We both had the Hells' kitchen burger cooked medium with fries.  The meat is seasoned well and the roasted jalapeño adds so much flavor!

Service was great for as busy as this place was (we had about a 15 minute wait at 2 in the afternoon).  Come early if you are too hungry to wait!

Our only issue was that the fries were not very good.  When a restaurant can execute a burger so well, it always makes me wonder how they can mess up french fries?? They were not crispy from the moment they hit the table.  We did enjoy the two varieties of ketchup that they were served with.

There was a line of people waiting, but my mom went straight to the front and checked in and they have that text service where they'll just text you when your table is ready so you can walk around instead of waiting in line. So make sure you check in instead of just standing mindlessly in line!

We got a text no more than 5 minutes later that our table was ready. We walked back to the front desk and they made us wait like 15 minutes for a table to be cleaned, and they they got frustrated with my mom for standing at the desk instead of further away which was not cool. I didn't witness it but my mom said the front desk girls were super rude and gave her attitude.

After we got seated the manager came over and apologized for everything that had happened which was nice.

So my family all ordered the ""Hell's Kitchen"" burger which was AMAZING. I got the ""F Word"" burger which is actually not on the menu! They only sell 50 a day and it's pricier than the rest of the burgers at $22 instead of $15. It was good, but if I came back I would def get the ""Hell's Kitchen"" burger.

I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but my boyfriend got those fries and he loved them. I got the truffle fries which were delish as well. The fries are like $12 so they're big enough to share between 2 people.

And on holidays, it can be a while before you can get in.
So, we decided to check it out one last time during the trip, and thankfully, there was no queue at the time. 

We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries, the vegetarian Portobella Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger (replaced with a Chicken patty). The fries were good. The mushroom in the Portobella was a tad bit overpowering for me towards the end. But nevertheless, it was delicious. My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. He prefers white meat to red. So, they offered to replace the patty with a Chicken patty. The Hell's Kitchen is a spicy burger. It could be a bit too hot for someone who does not eat a lot of spice.

I was very excited to try this place, but was very disappointed that was another open wall restaurant into the casino/hotel. For luxury restaurants, I usually expect a private restaurant experience and I feel like the open places feel too much like mall food and not enough like a luxury restaurant.
But the location was great, easy to find and right on the strip. 
The atmosphere on the inside was very appropriate for what it was. Thematically he was going for the American/British burger joint and it was set up that way. Large TVs with sports (which don't anything for me, but I thought was smart) and the blue and red color theme. Merchandise and photos of Ramsey made it seem more like a destination dining location and less like a luxury restaurant. 
The menu was perfect. Small, to the point, and cute. It had burgers, but also offered vegetarian option for burgers which is highly appreciated, modern and makes the burger menu feel complete. 
The service was good. We were seated fairly quickly, food didn't take too long to arrive, we were checked in on and my water stayed full. Nothing complain about!
The food itself was played beautifully. My chicken was a bit dry. But I will say that I was very much pleased with the flavor design. The idea of the creme brule milkshake is a brilliant twist on the classic beverages! And it was delicious. My chicken sandwich made me feel like a journey to the Mediterranean and it was almost a gyro burger, but without the tsatziki sauce.

I'm not so sure. At least I couldn't tell a big difference. I think Red Robin's onion rings are much better. Overall, it's still a great restaurant if you just want to eat burgers, munch on some bar foods and chill out with some friends without going out to a fancy restaurant.

We had the Hell's Kitchen burger and Blue cheese burger, both of us agreed that these were the best burgers we have ever had.  The Hell's kitchen burger jalapeno was perfectly seeded to give it some heat without it being overwhelming. The avocado was fresh and gave a great texture. Overall delicious.The blue cheese burger has a fig jam, this combination makes the burger. Blue cheese is a very salty cheese, delicious but salty; the sweet from the jam mixed with the salt of the blue cheese was heaven. I typically like thin burger patties as the heavy meat flavor can throw off the flavor balance, this was not the case, they are a thicker patty but the flavors are spot on and they were cooked perfectly. The one thing we didn't like is the truffle fries. The flavor was ok (super salty) but even the uncovered ones were lackluster; tasted frozen, not sure if they were.

The restaurant looked good but my first impression of the environment was not so good as the bad cigarettes smell of the casino was also in the restaurant. Then there was a slight wait and the hostess were wasting too much time chatting than helping customer. Once we sat down the service was friendly, but a bit too slow.. as it took at least 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it; on top of that, they got my wife's order wrong. The only reason I gave a 2 star was because the servicer was friendly. Overall, the experience was a disappointment and my wife and I definitely will not be visiting the restaurant again. So sad because I had high expectations from a place that had Gordon Ramsey's name on it and I am a big fan of his shows.",R27ww2seAoFt6Bobo1bV5g,1,0,2,mC2ayRqhZldzDWEjnDc9fQ

Yes, burgers may be expensive at $15 an order and that's WITHOUT fries. Adding a side of fries will be an additional $9-11. Get the parmesan truffle fries....yum!!!!!!! The burgers are  delicious and full of flavor. It's a perfect size, enough to make you feel full but it doesn't make you feel like a bloated person waddling outta there. You can request how well you want your burgers cooked and they're pretty on point with that.
The Hell's Kitchen burger is all that I order. It's spicy with jalapeños, cheese and avocados. Typing this is making me salivate.   

Keep in mind, DO NOT come here when you're starving/hangry. Not only will you have to wait for a table since it seems like there's always a wait here. My party of 4 and I were here for dinner on a normal Thursday evening and we still have to wait about 20 minutes. So after our waitress took our orders, she informed us that the burgers will take 30 minutes to make. WHATTTTT.....30 MINUTES!?!?! Urmm....okay, that caught me off guard. Wow...patience is a virtue here at Gordon Ramsay. I mean, she gave us the option of having the fries out first so we can munch on those but we didn't wanna spoil our dinner and get full off fries. But....different strokes for different folks? *shurgs*

All in all, this burger joint is definitely a must. Much better than Shake Shack in NY NY or this burger place at Fashion Show Mall. Come here instead. I will forever be returning here for my gourmet burger fix.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,3,5,EfIwYIRLiBuJB4E586vjPA

During my family's most recent trip to Vegas we finally got try their much anticipated burgers.  Overall, the dinner had some hits and misses. Despite the hustle and bustle, all the servers were all friendly, welcoming, and attentive.  We ordered many of the burgers recommended by the staff (i.e., Hell's Kitchen and Forest) as well as some others we thought just sounded delicious (i.e. Ultimate, Hog, Portobello). My favorites were the Ultimate and Portobella.  Both were bursting with flavor and cook to perfection. I would definitely order these two again. The other burgers left me unsatisfied.  The Forest was overall very bland. The duck bacon was flavorless and chewy and meat was unfortunately overcooked (based on how I wanted the burger cooked).  The Hog just had too much going on so it was difficult to appreciate all the ingredients.  Although the burger was definitely huge and filling! Hell's Kitchen tasted good but was under seasoned.  For sides we ordered the fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were AMAZING. They were seasoned well and had a perfect crispy batter.  Both fries were pretty average.  They were not very crisp or seasoned.I was not a fan of the homemade sauces. I was in need for good ol fashion Heinz Ketchup.

They had a opening at the chef's table so we took that spot. We both tried the ultimate cheeseburger which was very tasty. With the burger, we ordered fries and onion rings. Both of which were fantastic. It did take about 30 minutes for the burgers to arrive which the waiter did advise us.

2704335,2017-11-28,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Highly disappointed in the change in the menu. Less selection than what there was 4 years ago. Sat at the bar since I was by myself. The bar tender (Robert) was less than attentive and doesn't remember an order. Doesn't know the menu either, when asked what is in one of the menu items, he couldn't recall. As a professional bartender one of the BIGGEST skills needed is the ability to mingle with the clientele, to start and carry on conversations to help pass the time and also entertain a little. For some reason the ART of suggestive selling to help guide the guest through an experience has been lost.

I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger Medium Rare (The only way to order a burger)at 17:45(according to the time on the ticket) delivered at 18:19 (time on my phone when it arrived)wow what a long time. It was cooked to Medium Rare+ (just on the outside cusp of Medium Rare edging towards Medium). The flavor profile was somewhat bland with the exception of the mild heat from the roasted jalapeño and roasted tomato. The beef had absolutely no flavor. The fries were warm (not hot) and quickly cooled to a spongy soft potato.
The flavor of salt and herb quickly disbursed. No follow up to insure the meal was prepared to satisfaction nor was a follow performed for either of the two guest sitting next to me.

The 2 guest sitting next to me were also displeased with their experience as we entered into a conversation about their experience after I spoke up and mentioned an incident to a bartender (explained below). I informed a bartender that the guest to my left burger was over cooked and the bartender seemed dumbfounded and when I explained what a medium temperature should look like the bartenders response was ""I don't know, I'm just a bartender"". Wow - that really sealed it for me. My experience was ruined.. A moment later the guest was asked if they wanted to have the manager come by.(WOW really!! There should be NO question there a manager should have been informed immediately without asking anyone)

To add insult to injury, when a different bartender uses a bar towel to wipe his head and then leave the towel for future use on the bar that kind of turns my stomach. When I confronted that bartender his reply was (I wasn't using it) then I explained that he had JUST wiped down the back bar top with that very same towel  he just turned, shook his head in disapproval and said OK and took the towel and put it away. 

Overall, this experience was disappointing and only confirmed by the disappointment with 2 other guests dinning at the same time. It is obvious that Mr. Ramsey no longer is involved in this concept and the company that now owns the restaurant is milking the name for all they can. Overpriced drinks ($15 for a cocktail), poor quality of product and execution along with a poor service level brings this experience to a close.

I was SO looking for a great experience like the one I remembered from years past. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It causes concern for my next experience coming up Ramsey's Prime Steak House (I have reservations in a couple of days)..",Sfcnblf5ifBmQ_Vio7Amzw,2,2,2,6j2iYwlpej6bRql1bmIc_g

It was 10 min from the time that we got sat before our server came to introduce herself to us. She came over and asked if we were ready to order, my husband needed some more time, so she said she would come back. She could've easily taken our drink order but she never asked. When she came back, took our order, then at that time she asked us what we wanted to drink. It seemed odd due to the fact that everywhere we go, we get asked what we want to drink before anything else. Anywho, we never saw that server again, a younger gentleman came out with our appetizers and sat them down, it wasn't until shortly after that our drinks came out... 

The food was okay. We ordered the Kettle Chip Nachos, it was a little disappointing with the small about of shredded short rib it had! I'm pretty sure I would've been able to count the shreds of beef on these chips. We ordered some fries for our 2 year old to eat and they were so hard and tasteless, she gave up after 2 bites and would shake her head no when we offered her some more. This little girl eats crayons and she refused to eat these fries. 

 Next up was our burgers. I ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger, it come with different kinds of cheese and just the meat. My son ordered the Backyard burger, just a basic burger and my husband ordered the Hog Burger. These were actually pretty good. They aren't served with any sides so we ended up ordering some beer battered onion rings, but just like the drinks... these didn't come out until later, way later. 

Basically, service needs to improve. All food should come out at once except for the appetizer, don't bring out the side to my burger when I'm half way thru with it, at that point don't being me anything at all. We found out that the server never came back to our table because she got sent home, there was no introduction to the person that was going to be taking over her section. Really? And on top of this bad service, I'll still expected to tip 18 %

I don't think we'd come back, we have reservations for Hell's Kitchen in a couple of weeks, hoping that it will be a much better experience.",U28VstjRdxyoTp423t5JcA,0,0,3,bWqwT1FTIS-rNwkuCkhExQ

- Mushroom Poutine - gravy, duck bacon, cheese curds, vinegar pickles - flavors were good, but a little too salty.  Since the mushroom was the medium for this dish, it did not mellow out the flavors well

Since I have been to Gordon's Steak House I vowed on my next visit to Vegas that I would come to this place. First and foremost I want to thank the new GM Laurence from Gordon't Steak House for arranging a table for my family and I will forever be grateful for it was perfect.

Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in Planet Hollywood which is right next to Paris. This location is on a first come first serve bases. When we went to the counter to announce our arrival we were greeted with a very welcoming smile and they informed us that they were expecting us and they were preparing our table. As  we awaited the few minutes for them to finish preparing our table we had a chance to review the menu which was in Gordon's style;
simple and elegant. 

In the front of the restaurant there was a bar with several TV's for watching current sporting events for those who wanted to enjoy some appetizers with their drinks. As we were brought to our table we were seated in a lovely blue colored booth with the traditional Ramsay white table setting. My brother was amazed by the weight of the cutlery, which I love a nice balanced fork and knife. Our waiter Jared was just amazing, he answered some of questions about the various types of hamburger's that were offered on the menu. Jared also informed us that they had a special F Word burger that was not on the menu and of course you knew I was going to have exactly that. I also informed Jared of my allergies to shellfish and nuts, which he had made a special note so that the staff would be informed to use equipment that were not used with any products that could cause an allergic reaction. 

Some the of things we ordered along with our main dishes was a delicious Cesar salad with green apple slices minus the kale, I am not a kale fan. We also ordered regular fries and the truffle fries with parmesan cheese. The funny thing is that the pictures makes these fries look small but they are actually fairly big and even with 3 of us we could not finish all the fries. The nice served with different sauces too and came out hot and crispy golden.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxing and it has this wonderful wavy fire wall display. The temperature in the restaurant was perfect, yes I am one of those people that get cold easy lol so things like this are very important to me. Jared was very attentive and informed us that our special burgers will take about 20 minutes and I do appreciate that he served all our burgers along with the fries at the same time and they were all nice and hot. We were able to enjoy our dinner and Jared was very attentive by removing dishes that were not needed anymore and keeping our drinks constantly filled. If we were not so stuffed we would have ordered one of their delicious desserts but again the 3 of us shared a salad and fries and we all had our own individual burgers and we were stuffed. 

I wish I could describe how delicious this burger was but I have to let the picture speak for itself.  I know that there is no doubt that I will come back here again and I would hope they still offered the F Word burger.

We decided to visit Vegas on a whim. Also we wanted to eat at a ""celebrity chef"" restaurant. Btw Gordon Ramsay has like 4 restaurants on the strip. We figured we would give Chef Ramsay's burger place a shot. 

We came on Monday night and there was no wait for a table. But according to the server sometimes the wait is two hours!! I ordered the UK burger which had arugula, Dubliner cheese and a mango chutney. I prefer my burger or meat to be close rare. The server asked how I would like my burger I told her MEDIUM RARE BUT MORE RARE. She took my order and my hubby's and friends' orders. My friend wanted to modified or substitute an item. The server was nice about it but she did explain that the chefs are picky about modifications they usually DO NOT do stuff like that. But she would ask anyway and the chefs refused. So orders were finally placed. We waited 30 MINUTES!! Still NO burgers in sight!!! We asked our server about our food. She said it's a standard 30 minutes. She could tell we were irritated. She felt that management should post it somewhere but of course they wouldn't!!  Our food finally came out 5 minutes later. 

The burgers and fries (btw everything is al la carte) looked good. We were starving too!! My girlfriend order her burger medium. When I cut into my burger my patty was medium well. My girlfriend's burger was more rare and she ordered medium! I was upset!! Not only did we wait 30 MINUTES plus, the chefs DID NOT ALLOW CUSTOMIZED BURGERS and this place's speciality is burgers and they STILL COULDN'T get it right!!!! The burger had good flavor but the patty was OVER COOKED and DRY to me. For almost $20 this burger should be magically! It's was the cheese and chutney that saved it. 

I told the server my issue of my overcooked patty. And of course when you're a vegetarian YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD!! I don't know why the server felt it was necessary to tell me she doesn't have issues with overcooked meat because she's a VEGETARIAN!!! *hand clap* very helpful you millennial! I told her I didn't want to wait 30 minutes again because I was hungry. I asked her what can she do for me. So she said she would check with her manager. She returned and gave us 10% off the bill. Thank you millennial vegetarian working at a burger joint! *thumbs up*

Have you ever seen that meme where Gordon Ramsay slaps two piece of bread around a persons face and makes them admit they're an idiot sandwich? That's how I felt after I tried two burgers: like an idiot who paid $20 per burger. 

We waited for an hour before being seated. The line was frustrating because every time we peeked inside there were available tables that were clean and ready. Not sure what they were waiting for since the cutlery and napkins were already set.

ANYWAYS - we got the burger with goat cheese/arugula and the one with foie gras. Both were (and I hate to say this because I had such high expectations): underwhelming. The burgers were cold and I did not taste the melding nor complimentary nature of ingredients. 

The highlight of the dinner was the truffle fries dip. I asked for an extra helping and was pleasantly surprised when there wasn't an extra charge. I used everything (burger, crust, fries) as a vehicle and excuse to enjoy the truffle dip.

2848876,2017-12-27,7,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This is my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant and let's say I was expecting a bit more, but still enjoyed my experience overall. We decided to each order a burger and share so in case we wanted more, we knew what we would order. We ordered:
The Hog Burger: surprise burger of the group, as my party and I didn't expect much because our waitress sold us on the special burger (""F Word"") on our particular visit. This is layers on layers of pork, it isn't wasn't saturated in grease, and it was quick flavorful. All of the flavors mended well together and was the surprise ""favorite"" pick amongst us (party of 4).
Being as hungry as we were, we decided to try Chef Ramsay's take on poutine.
It was winner for us as we enjoyed the mixture of gravy, duck bacon, cheese curds, and vinegar pickled shallots. My friend even said on her next visit, maybe she'll just have an order of this by herself. It satisfied our taste buds and piqued our interest on what else was coming our way.
Shrimp and Lobster Burger: had a nice texture and though I liked the curry that seasoned the patty, I felt like it muted the shrimp and lobster flavor (as we know those aren't prominent to begin with). Still a pretty good burger, but I felt it could have been better.
Hell's Kitchen Burger: had a subtle kick to it from the jalepeno ingredients, but wasn't overpowering. The avocado did help quell the heat and add another flavor profile to the burger itself. I would say this was the second best burger of the group.
""F Word"" Burger: this was the special (off menu) during my visit, which is constructed with a patty that is a blend of a 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. Though sold as soon as we heard the ingredient list of this bad boy, we felt like all the flavors were not pronounced enough, but was still a good hunk of a burger.
We noticed all the beef patties were consistently good (they have that process down) and the difference on the beef burgers were just the toppings/condiments associated with each ""specialty"".",EE9txZm_zUFqWeYGVGaFNg,8,9,3,KQqaBpKf6l19octYzbp97w
2857184,2017-04-27,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"I along with a couple friends thought we would try this restaurant back in March. Fortunately the wait during a busy weekend was not to bad, about fifteen minutes. Once we were seated the waiter approached the table and promptly asked if we wold like to order anything to drink. We chose not to order any alcohol and simply ordered waters and soft drinks. It was very obvious from the waiters demeanor that since we did not order any alcohol this was going a low ticket table and assumed his tip would reflect that. Never assume! The burgers were about average, good but nothing to rave about. 

The little things are what made the difference. When our burgers were brought to the table they came in stages, not all together. Once we received the burgers it took about ten additional minutes for the fries to arrive. Why is the table not served together? Toward the end of the meal one of my friends finished his burger before the rest of us. His plate was clear while we were still eating. Is this common practice to start clearing the table before all the patrons are still eating. It made us feel as though they were trying to push us out the door quickly so they can get the next party seated asap. Maybe they were going to order alcohol to jack up the tab.

I ordered the Forest Burger (tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon). I list those ingredients because they are the only thing that brought life to this burger. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare, and received a dry overcooked piece of meat that would have sent Gordon Ramsay himself straight to the kitchen to tell the cook it was ""as f***ing dry as a camel's a**hole in a desert storm"". Yeah, that's a real quote. 

The toppings were stellar but the tasteless patty and sub-par meat quality are going to weigh this down to three stars. Watch out for the $8 up-charge for fries, yoinks!",ChAYZfqSI8OHlFd4QlYyFA,3,2,3,YzrUX9CxsdUqttlzOM7LPw

The masses dictate the survival or death of an establishment with their thumbs, like back during the Roman days of the coliseum. One key to unlock the success of a restaurant is to appeal to the majority and even offer a selection that simply can change ones mind about a dish or entree. Gordon Ramsey's Burger has done that. I hate onion rings. I've never been attracted to the concept of wasting batter on an ingredient that's used as a topping or for just flavor. I absolutely love these onion rings! They are by far the showcase menu item to me because the level of excellence it presents overshadows the delicious and decadent selections of burgers that the famous F-you chef's menu offers.

2942925,2017-09-19,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This restaurant originally opened as BurGR. The specialty of the restaurant are burgers. They serve a variety of burgers including a vegetarian. The beef is ground in the mothership kitchen at the Paris kitchen. They are serve appetizers, snacks, salad and milk shakes. This is a full service restaurant with a full bar. 

This restaurant always seems busy with a long line to get in but it moves fast. The atmosphere is very fiery, loud and energetic. Our waiters were both very friendly and gave us a briefing on the menu and were able to answer any questions we had.

We started with the Truffle Fries. We received a very large portion of Truffle Fries with two dipping sauces, house made ketchup and truffle aioli. The fries and very creamy and soft but not soggy. The top fries taste the best with the cheese and salt but as you dig down the taste builds up too much and the salt collects and the fries also turn too salty. I'd get plain fries next time. 

I tried the Tandoori Chicken Burger. The bun was buttered and grilled just like a grilled cheese sandwich. The chicken almost seemed chopped and was INCREDIBLY MOIST and juicy and full of flavor. It was an absolutely delicious burger full of flavors.

My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. It's bigger than the chicken and is a 7 ounce patty. It was made Medium/Rare just like he asked for and was prepared just so and also was delicious.

The food and service really was good but on the pricy side for what it was. Two burgers, fries and some wine sets you back about $100.00.",V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,3,3,4,eM3I4iFOD7zohe5M0mS8pQ

2972408,2018-04-15,2,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This being a Gordon Ramsay place, I held the food to a higher standard than I would ordinarily. I know of the guy, and I know he demands quality and precision. Would he have been in the kitchen that evening, I wouldn't have heard a barrage of profanity, but I would not exclude a bit of yelling. 

First, the server I had, Alex I think was his name was awesome. He definitely knew his stuff, and not from a handbook or manual, no, this dude has tried literally everything. The fact that the food took a little longer than I would expect to come out he let me know ahead of time, which was much more appreciated than the ""It'll be right out"" when guests start to get antsy. 

I had ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, cooked medium. Let's start with the good, so it doesn't seem like bashing this place is all I came to do: the flavor from the combination of ingredients was good! The burger wasn't overloaded to the point where you couldn't bite, but everything still came together nicely... or was supposed to.

Now, the not-so-good. If this were some little pub, I would give them more slack. In this case, I expected the same level of precision and quality Mr. Ramsay seems to demand of his chefs. 

The meat in the burger was overcooked for what I ordered. Per the server, medium is supposed to have lots of pink. In my case, they had overcooked it, as I got a medium-well, with tiny hidden areas of pink in places. I also found the meat slightly underseasoned, a pinch more salt and pepper would have done this place quite a bit of good. 

Then there was the overall execution which I found quite lacking. To me, when I bite into a burger, I'd like to get the same experience with the first bite, last bite, and each one in between. The avocado was more or less evenly dispersed, yet the roasted tomato(es) were very unevenly dispersed. Only a handful of bites got this taste, hence the quotes. As for the jalapeno aioli, it suffers the same problem... it was as if it was slapped on without regard. There was so little of this stuff, I don't even recall tasting it.

I'm hoping the photo I've attached from my meal will at least somewhat corroborate this point. 

One of the final points I'd like to make is regarding the fries. If you are here with someone, the portions are great for splitting with a friend or two. However, if you come here alone as I did, the portion of fries it too big for one person. That said, it would be awesome if they had smaller, individual sized portions for those not wanting to eat for two.",Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ,4,1,2,Qkj5fO3Yxb4j4PhR0Fwmfg

Everything from service to quality was absolutely unenjoyable. 

Small patties are hidden under an oversized bun. I expected a nice handmade patty, plump, and juicy, but the patties were undersized and all perfectly shaped and well-pressed under the flame. I ventured to order a ""special"" burger: lobster and shrimp... boy-o-boy was that a bad idea. The patty tasted like a rubber tire! I took a couple of bites just to make sure it wasn't me and tossed in the napkin. It ruined my appetite.

Quite some time after I'd tossed in the napkin, a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. I commented on the poor quality and preparation of the lobster and shrimp burger. He did apologize and asked why I didn't let them know, as they could have made me another, but when I said I wouldn't want to try it again he said he'd let the kitchen know and simply moved on. 

The sides were just as disappointing. The sweet potato fries were soggy, barely warm and covered in powdered sugar. They were served with a sweet opaque sauce they called a spicy aioli, but there was absolutely nothing spicy about it... it tasted like desert. 

I'd put burgers, sandwiches and fries at this establishment in the same class as Red Robin, Johnny Rockets, Applebee's, etc.

After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the Hells Kitchen burger, which was supposed to have roasted jalapeños, roasted tomatoes, jalapeño aioli, asadero cheese, and avocado. Sounds spicy right? Not at all actually. I saw the roasted tomatoes and stuff in my burger, but it was not spicy at all. In fact, I couldn't really taste anything except for the avocado. Not even the jalapeño aioli that was supposed to be in the burger. I ended up just dipping my burger in the ketchup and aioli sauces we got from the Parmesan fries because it was so dry. This was really disappointing. 

The second thing that was really surprising was what happened with my friend's blue cheese burger. While this burger tasted much better than mine, the kitchen somehow messed up and there was PAPER in the burger! I could not believe that there was actual paper that somehow ended up in it. We complained about it to our server, Elijah, and he was very nice and quickly corrected it for us and replaced it with a new burger. Shoutout and thank you for correcting the situation. I was just really surprised that this type of thing happened at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. 

I'll end the review on a good note with the Parmesan truffle fries - although I was hesitant about the $12 price tag, the fries were really good and you could taste the Parmesan and truffle sprinkled evenly throughout all of the fries. They come in a cone and sometimes because of that the seasoning may not be evenly spread out, but this was not the case at Gordon Ramsay, thankfully. I would have preferred the fries crispier, but they were still good. 

Overall, the paper in burger thing was really the biggest surprise at this higher class establishment. That aside, the food was just okay to me and not mind blowing.

The burger is good but found the bun to be too commercial.  HD makes their in-house so always have a fresh-soft-buttery bun.  

Overall a good burger and worth it with the credit!

We started off with the kettle chip nachos.  They came out fairly quickly, maybe 2 minutes from ordering them.  It came with a good amount of short rib and corned beef but thought it was a little underseasoned.  For our burgers, my boyfriend ordered the farmhouse burger cause he really wanted an egg and I ordered the anniversary burger (aged rib eye patty topped with short rib).  Burgers were juicy but we both thought they were just ok.

3092219,2018-02-18,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"For late-night dinner I tried the beer-battered onion rings ($9), burnt ends poutine ($14), truffle parmesan fries ($12), and the pork chop and applesauce burger ($16).

The onion rings seemed well-battered. The batter did not overwhelm with oil and possessed a fluffy texture.

The burnt ends poutine seemed at times over- and under-garnished. The burnt ends, in their limited quantity and size, made no apparent change in flavor profile. The shredded carrots' hard texture did not juxtapose well with the rest of the dish; future iterations should omit the carrots. The cheddar cheese curds also arrived in such limited quantities that they made no significant effect. The only redeemable element of the poutine, the black pepper gravy, had a lot of black pepper but needed a thicker consistency.

The truffle parmesan fries seemed satisfactory.

The pork chop applesauce burger contained a pork patty, dubliner cheese, branston pickles, apple braised pork shank, and cabbage-apple slaw. While these items individually sound delicious, their combination seemed underwhelming. The base pork patty seemed subdued in flavor, and the apple braising dominated the palate, relegating the other flavors to afterthoughts.

With the majority of my meal (burger + 1 appetizer) resulting in mediocrity, I will pass on future opportunities at this establishment.",dnNXirfyr8xcUS6E56oRIg,1,0,2,iaWGOPjSOem7CkXB62RDLA

THE WAIT:
- there was a 20 foot line of people around 1PM on a Saturday but we only ended up waiting around 20 minutes!

THE FOOD:
- Sweet potato fries +4/5
They sprinkle powdered sugar over the fries, giving the plate a unique, yummy taste. Feel free to ask for extra condiments (chipotle aioli, ketchup, etc..) on the side too! 
- Hell's Kitchen Burger +4/5
This was my first time trying this burger & wow - it was good. I'm not a burger person so this says a lot too. The jalapeño added the perfect spicy kick to it & trust me - add an egg to your burger to reward your tastebuds. The only downside was that the burger was pretty salty. 
- Hogg Burger +4.5/5
The bf ordered this and we both didn't expect how big the burger was going to be. He couldn't finish all of it but devoured as much as he could. If you've already had the Hell's Kitchen burger, definitely try this one next!


SERVICE:

We walked in on Wednesday, May 10th around 11:30pm. We were seated immediately at their counter with a view of the kitchen. A friend joined us later and we were able to grab an extra seat.

*Beer Battered Onion Rings: parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip ($9)

*Black Butte ($9)
*Coors Light Draft ($8) ×2
*Guinness Draft ($8)

I got the foie burger with truffle fries. I should have read the description closer as I thought it was going to come with seared foie. Instead, it was a foie pate. It probably would have been fine, but paired with the chevre, the burger was too rich. And not in a good way as the chevre added a tanginess I didn't like. It also seemed like the cheese and foie were fighting each other instead of complementing each other. I did enjoy the truffle fries, but I think it's hard to mess those up. We'd been drinking all day, so I just decided to get a couple Coors Light. It was easy to drink. The boys got the rest of the food and thought everything was okay. Not worth the price was the consensus.

We always do the high end steak house type of thing but this time I wanted to switch things up. Gordon Ramsay is one of her favorite chefs and she loves burgers! So this place couldn't have been a better decision. I called in advance to try and make a reservation and was informed that they DO NOT accept reservations and it was a first come first serve type of situation. Yikes! Say what? Yeah I was bit nervous about this because being that we were going on a Saturday night I could only imagine how packed they were going to be! 

When we first arrived the line looked like people ready to get on a roller coaster at six flags. I just knew the wait was going to be 2hrs! To my surprise I saw a sign that read ""For parties of 3 or more see host"" That worked out for us because we had exactly 3 in our party! Score! Gave the hostess my number at was told we would be seated in about 45 minutes! Not bad at ALL! The Miracle Mile Shops are good to wonder around when you have a wait like this but we didn't even have to wait the full 45 minutes I got a text message saying our table was ready in about 30 minutes. Wining points already!

Once we were seated our hostess came right over and gave us a cool little introduction about the place and explained the menu. I appreciated her acknowledging my best friends birthday and made sure that we were brought something out in celebration for that. The cocktail menu is on an iPad which I don't know why I always think this is so cool! No drinks for us though we had plenty before at Fat Tuesdays and at this point starving was an understatement! 

Food:

Beer Battered Onion Rings- Parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip

Truffle Parmesan Fries

2 Farmhouse Burgers- Dublinar cheese, Mangalitsa bacon, fried egg

Backyard Burger- American cheese, butter lettuce, tomato,pickle, onion

The onion rings are bomb! 
Delicate shavings of cheese topped a large cone of crispy, beer-battered onion rings and the  ranch dressing made the each bite melt into my mouth. My brother and I agreed, these were the star of our lunch.
My tandoori chicken burger was good, cooked perfectly with a fresh bun and my tangerine cocktail was so juicy, I wanted more, a great balance between sweetness and alcohol content.
The tables have a subtle British theme from the glossy menus with Gordon Ramsay flanked by the British flag to the blue place settings with red cloth napkins, adding a nice touch to the table.
One suggestion I'd have is to include plain fries with burgers to provide a more complete meal; it'd allow guests to still choose from their tasty-looking appetizer menu if they wish but would be a more traditional way to enjoy a burger without paying extra.

Ordered the special hamburger that was not on the menu (limited to 100 per night). It was priced at $22. It was a strip sirloin and ribeye grounded together and topped with a little bit of brisket. This was a disappointment. The burger was dry, not tasty and I ordered it as suggested by the server. The bun was excellent.  The nachos tasted good but had way too much cream sauce. The onion rings were tasty. They come in this cone holder. The not so good part was the bottom rings got soggy with oil. Which made them unappetizing. Would I go eat there again?

The wait time here was minimal, we stood in line for ten minutes, tops, and spent that time gaping over the menu on the outside wall.  Once we were seated, we were waited upon in short order, by a friendly server named Guy.  I forgot the name of the burger I got, but it was the once with a fried egg on top (farm burger?  barnyard burger?) and it was exquisite.  I like my burger medium rare, and usually I struggle to get a place to cook it for me medium rare, but this one came out right at the perfect temperature.  It was juicy, and flavorful, and all the accoutrements included upon it were scrumptious, also.  The fried egg was perfectly fried (overcooked eggs are a huge no-no for me) and the yolk was velvety, and rich.  Just an all around excellent burger.  The fries were okay, the onion rings were okay.  For those you are provided with a few sauces, one it a curry flavored ketchup, which lo and behold tastes like curry.  There is also a chipotle ketchup, which was tasty, but I didn't get much chipotle out of it.  The third is a cheddar ranch which was mindblowingly out of this world.  I would have ordered more fried to get more of this cheddar ranch.  It tastes like ranch dressing, without the acidic finish, instead replaced with a creamy smooth cheese flavor.  I've never had a ranch quite like this, and I lament that I will probably never find a comparable copycat recipe.  Overall the burger was worth the price, really tasty, cutesy restaurant, good service...a good experience for the low to mid budget gordon ramsay fan.",Yr955PFOzx8tDhQ47SwejQ,0,0,4,0Chkat0VRhmXx3hHNxTwfQ

Now onto the food: 
Truffle fries: Straight fire. But ask for extra ketchup. 

Sweet potato fries: Yes I know the name says sweet, but I guess personally most of the time I have sweet potato fries they're not really on the sweet side. These ones also had a layer of sugar on top which really gave it that side, so personally I wasn't a fan and would've just struck to the truffle. 

Forest Burger: I am a big mushroom person which is why I was leaning towards this one, and I will say that the mushrooms had a TON of flavor. The burger overall was pretty tight. I will say that there was a unanimous decisions that all of the burgers we had were slacking on saucing. So it really tasted like a patty and then your veggies on top. Similarly, i'd recommend asking for an extra sauce.

Finally the milkshakes were very very underwhelming. They only had three flavors and they weren't thick at all. I like true diner style milkshakes and this wasn't that. Of the three flavors I would recommend the butterscotch, even though I typically go for oreo flavored.",1hLtVM6J7bvNDVf0wHFqOg,0,1,3,0XHeunvZg6cxFyMMbhKlyQ

-- Got to try 4 burgers and 3 fries --

Let's start with the BEST, the burgers:

1) Forest Burger $17 - AMAZING. Wow, the juicy tender incredibly flavorful patty with even more flavor from the tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula (dressed, no naked ingredients here!) and duck bacon. I just wished my stomach could handle more but the sides we got were killers [I would not order 3 sides of fries for 4 people]

2) Farmhouse Burger $17 - This was great. All protein and not a sight of plant here. I think the fat afrom the mangalitsa bacon does the trick here, a shiny burger doused in liquid lard. 

3) ""Foie"" Burger $22 - My friend got this and she didn't love it. I thought it was okay as I am not a fan of foie anymore. I think it was just too heavy in all aspect, fat, foie, cheese... I personally think burgers should have some vegetables to balance the heaviness. The last two did not. 

4) There was also a Lobster and shrimp burger but it isn't on the menu anymore. It was good and lightish but here, you gotta get the beef. 

Then there were the sides which really felt like the main courses too (not my favorite and next time, I would skip these altogether)

1) Beer Battered Onion Rings $9. Good but honestly, too much in terms of dough and the salty parmigiano-reggiano as they were very generous with it. The additives make these heavier than your usual rings. Plan accordingly because we did NOT finish any of the fries and we are not slim people.

2) Truffle Parmesan Fries $12. There were aromatic as expected. Thick cut, loads of potato action here. Possibly a tad dry and a little too hard for my liking. 

3) Sweet potato fries. Disappointing because they were limp and not hot. They were clearly not freshly fried. I think they were SO busy that night that the quality of the food kinda dropped. 

We asked them to bring us freshly fried ones but the next batch was simply hotter and a little darker but did not feel fresh. We left them. Service was slow, it was a busy night.",wClUV2KsLWNZwOw5nlw6UQ,4,5,4,ORSWtcv4qn8homjS1xVQuw

I think we waited just shy of an hour for a gourmet burger and fries that were both mediocre in relation to price and wait time. The forest burger was nearly devoid of mushrooms (only two little morsels on each half) and the fries were kinda dried out steak fries and came with two sauces. The one sauce was a truffle aioli which was good and the other was a ""ketchup"" that I am pretty sure was house made and not very good. I could taste the worshi sauce and celery salt and other ingredients independently and it wasn't very well balanced.

Restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood. 
As we arrived, there was a long line. The host was going down the line taking names. For a party of 3 or more you do not have to wait in line. They write down your cell phone number and call you as soon as a table is ready. 
Wait was 1hr. 40min. 
Finally we sat down!!! 
Restaurant looks very clean and Nice decor. 
Ordered 3 Hells Burgers and 1 hot dog. 

Took about another 30-45 min. For our food to come out!
A total of almost 4 hours from the time we checked in to the time we left. Wow!!! 

My Party and I where really Disappointed! 

$15 Burger does not come with a side. 
We ordered a side of wedges and onion rings. 

""Hells Burger"" the description seemed like if it would be a spicy burger includes jalapeños and avocado. Nope!!! The presentation was really nice, but my burger was tasteless, it needed something, no sauce, I did not taste like jalapeño, it just needed something. It just seemed like a burger I could have prepared myself at home. 

Fries and onion rings, nothing special. 

 Hot dog is huge, but nothing special.

We picked this place over the other GR restaurant because it was within our price range. It's located in Planet Hollywood and you're greeted by a line of fire with the words Gordon Ramsay Burger. The wait wasn't bad, the line moved pretty quickly but please note that if you have a party of more than 3 people, go to the front and tell the wait staff. We had a party of about 15 and we didn't see that sign until we were near the front so it was too late for that. Our wait was about an hour on a Monday night. I think if you have a smaller party, the wait should not be as long as ours. And reservations aren't available. The neat thing is you don't have to be there waiting until the hour is up, I was able to give them my number and they would text me when the table is clearing. We walked around outside and saw the Fountains at the Bellagio. 
I ordered the Hell Kitchen's burger with the truffle fries. They warn you ahead of time to share the truffle fries with a couple of people so don't let the price deter you. This was probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. It definitely beats a few of my favorite burger joints in Dallas. It's also big so you'll be super satisfied. I split my burger with my friend who had the Farmhouse burger. The Farmhouse burger was interesting, wasn't my favorite exactly but it was still good. It had interesting toppings. The truffle fries were super flavorful. Every bite you took had good flavor. We were able to dip it in an aioli sauce and ketchup. The ketchup here is SUPER fresh, not packaged in a Hunt's ketchup bottle and you can definitely tell. I'm telling everyone who goes to Vegas to check this place out.

* Burger: patty tastes super juicy, yumm. I don't like the cheese at all, maybe it's not my taste. I could only finish half of the burger.
* Shake: if you can't comprehend a cup full of sugar then don't. 60% of the shake is the thick, overly sweet cream brulee cream, the rest is oreo shake.

3468806,2018-01-21,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Just an FYI: this restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood. Now for my review:

My husband loooves Gordon Ramsay. Lately he's been watching reruns of Kitchen Nightmares, and I've been trying to avoid hearing it in the background (yuck!). When we were staying in Vegas, I knew we had to go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. If you're dining at Burger, there'll likely be a line. We waited for about 20-30 minutes, and were offered a seat at the bar and we took it. The line seemed to die down around 10 pm (on a Sunday night). 

Yes, this is a splurge. You're paying for the experience of eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant. That said, my burger was outstanding. I had the U.K. burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had, if not the best. It had fresh green arugula and chutney on it. I'm not sure if they grow their arugula, but as someone who's currently growing lettuce, it usually only looks and tastes as fresh as it did if it was harvested recently. The other standout of the night was the white sangria. It was amazing. It has apple, pear, and cinnamon - just fantastic!

I'm only knocking off a star, because of a few things:

- I wasn't a fan of my husband's Hell's Kitchen burger. The flavor was just odd to me.
- The online menu needs to be updated.
- I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato fries. Maybe I wished they were more savory. They were kind of sweet, but not like dessert. It seemed like they were having an identity crisis.

Otherwise, if we're in Vegas again I might have to come back for the U.K. burger!",Tv0nXlxIm601ukBs_h__Cw,3,1,4,GpFzw7tTK9pqt0L2vz8usQ

The burger is cooked perfectly to your specifications and doesn't come soggy like most places. The bun is crisp and goes really well. 

I asked for the wings to be cooked extra crispy and naked and they came out perfectly. I recommend doing it this way so the wings aren't soggy because if the sauce is on the wings too long it'll happen.

While they don't take reservations, if you get there early enough, the line is maybe a 10-15 minute wait. This is absolutely one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. I don't think you can go wrong with any burger at this place but I've got to recognize the Ultimate Cheeseburger, which is my go to item. The buns are quality, the burger is juicy and flavorful, and it has three kinds of cheeses mixed together in what can only be described as my version of heaven. My husband had the Lobster/Shrimp burger which has a shrimp/lobster type patty and pickled veggies on it. It's really a different option then the traditional burgers. 

Lastly, you need to get one of their milkshakes. We didn't last time we were there so we made a point to try the Oreo Creme Brulee Shake on this trip. It is so rich and the flavor is better then just your average oreo shake because of the creme brulee pudding on the top. The cocktails we had were also on point.

When you check in you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready. Which is a really nice feature because you can walk around the casino or even go back up to your room if you are staying there. 
The food was delicious! I had the ultimate cheeseburger since I am a big fan of cheese, it did not disappoint really juicy and the cheese is fantastic.  We shared the truffle fries and onion rings. Personally, I liked the onion rings better, they were light and not oily. The sauces they give you are also very good. Both of my sisters really enjoyed their burgers, one is vegetarian and got the portobello mushroom burger she loved it and it did look very tasty, the other one got the blue cheeseburger she was very satisfied with the burger.

In my opinion it is reasonably priced $15-22 depending which burger you get. Even the truffle fries priced at $12 is not bad especially if you share with one other person. 

The only con is see is because of the wait time- but for me that doesn't warrant losing a star. If you plan accordingly and go off peak times, you should be okay.  I do not believe they have a reservation list. I came on a Monday at approx 6:30pm with my parents, we waited about 15 mins for a table (or could have been seated right away at the bar high tables). But when we came out a while later, there was a line all the way to the gaming tables- yes still on a Monday night. I've gone on a Saturday during peak time before and have waited almost 2 and a half hours for a table for 4. So don't do it and let it spoil everything.

The service was great, and the burgers are not monstrous. You will feel full and satisfied but not bloated, even with the fries. I recommend that everyone try this place.",B49gWR4uY7vcuDFOyj6LOQ,0,0,5,_wC-5VAIRTnYt9CgqJtD3A

*Crown Burger 15
aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb aïoli,
dried tomatoes - I ordered this as I love arugula and aioli. I cut in half but it was so good that I finished the half in three bites.

True Parmesan Fries 11 - Enough for sharing. I would not order individual fries. We finished about 4/5 of our fries. The aioli sauce that came with it was bomb. Definitely the fries to get if you are dining here.

The burger looked great (see photo). As for the taste, I was underwhelmed. Given this burger is about the blue cheese, I was surprised how little blue cheese flavor came through. Certain bites showcased the cheese and figgy jam nicely, but too many did not. Like the cheese, I wanted more jam than what was provided. 

The meat itself was okay. If you want a juicer burger, you may want to try it medium rare. For a gourmet burger, I found it fairly generic. 

The bun was solid. Not spectacular, but fresh, tasty, and the multicolored sesame seeds were nice. 

I paid ~$21 total with tax and tip. My burger was $16. 

Takeaways: 
-if I could do it again I'd order the forest burger (I'm a fan of mushrooms and bacon on burgers, and the duck bacon sounded good)

My family (fiancé, my pregnant sister & her husband, my big sister & her young daughter) and I came during the late afternoon and were told there'd be a 35 minute wait but were actually seated quickly. We noticed there was a slight change in decor and table setup, but for the most part things looked nice and new. At the table we were given the menus and ipad. 

IMMEDIATELY my sisters noticed that their favorite jalapeño poppers were abolished. Lol. New burgers were introduced but they kept my favorite Hell's Kitchen, and changed up the farm burger to a farmhouse, with a different cheese. Basic sides were the same. I thought I'd like to try the forest burger next. 

We were waiting a solid 15 minutes before our server came and asked what we would like to drink. She was busy I could tell but I felt that she was also flying through everything, NOT in a good way. As a former server I could just feel the tension from her juggling us, adding us to her pile of mounting mental madness. 

We ordered quickly (my sisters pushing for them poppers to no avail), and then waited a lengthy 40 minutes for our food. When our food came, presentation was not as it had been before. My fiancé had a piece of old cheese melted and stuck to his plate from either another plate or from a bad dishwashing. Our server had also forgotten one order of fries which we waited til the end of our meal for. We all needed refills for tea a few minutes into our entrees because they had not been filled after we had gotten them.

Although I have had the Hell's Kitchen burger a few times previously, it wasn't the same as it used to be. I feel like in the name of profit, the restaurant has become more for tourists and not for taste. Before, whenever we got our bill I had always thought ""I can't believe I'm paying so little for such a great meal and time."" Now, when we got the bill I thought ""This is just another typical Strip Burger joint bill for a typical Strip Burger experience"". Which is sad, because it had always been a place we loved to go for a treat on the Strip every other month or so, and whenever we had friends or family in town.

3683661,2018-02-21,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This isn't a review of the food at Gordon Ramsay Burger - but rather my parties' experience - and specifically the customer service at this establishment.  My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating my 50th birthday with 2 other couples on 2/17/2018.  It was during the dinner hours and were happy that the wait for our party of 6 was only 30 minutes.  We were all excited to try his restaurant - having been fans of the TV program and having dined at another higher end Ramsey restaurant on previous business travel to Las Vegas.  Upon putting in our reservation at the hostess stand, we stepped to the bar, placed an order for 6 cocktails ($75 for the round of beverages), and began to watch the Winter Olympics on the TV at the bar.  After a few minutes a hostess approached my wife and explained that we couldn't stand were we were  (at the bar).  Upon surveying the area - I at first thought that the server was saying that we couldn't stand near the area of the bar where they pick up bar orders (i.e. near the rail) or we were in the way of the servers -- we were not.  I totally understand this -- so I made a point of moving down, making certain that we were well clear of the server area.  A few minutes later the server returned -- and very RUDELY told my wife and friends that we ""YOU NEED TO MOVE""  (no ""please"" and in a very rude tone)  *** Important note *** several seats were EMPTY at the bar.   I explained we were having our drinks that we had just ordered -- and the server explained that it was ""against policy"" and that we would have to stand outside of the restaurant ""on the carpet"".  We walked back to the hostess stand --  I requested an explanation of the policy from the hostess and she reiterated the same.  Not satisfied with this, I requested to speak with the manager.  He came over - apologized, but said that was ""the policy"" -- the bar was ""full service"" and we would have to wait outside of the area.  I explained to him that I had just ordered a round of drinks and pointed out that ample seating was available -- I suppose I could understand if they had diners at the bar... but not really ... these weren't ""tables"" in the bar ... this was ""the bar"" -- and we were customers!  Unbelievable!   I explained to the manager that my friends and I were all frequent Las Vegas business patrons -- and didn't appreciate the terrible customer service.  Even if it was a ""policy"" - the server had no excuse to speak to my wife in such a rude and inappropriate manner.  He apologized for that (indicating he would speak to her) and offered to attempt to seat us -- but at this point I couldn't see giving the establishment another dollar.  Before leaving, I returned to the bar to put my $14 cocktails in ""go cups"" and the bartender also apologized for the policy.  Very unfortunate as I had enjoyed my other experience at GR restaurants - but given this experience will not return on future business or leisure trips.   I've been to many restaurant bars in my years of business and leisure travel -- but never experienced a policy like this - nor been treated so rudely.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants with exceptional customer service -  and we experienced several over our long weekend --- Gordon Ramsey Burger is not one of them.",cwOqqg17xfJrHCB69IruKQ,0,0,1,OrVPh9zzXk2yfZqPTaQW9w

As burger joints go, this one was actually pretty standard (compared to Au Cheval in Chicago, or even Five Guys), and the real taste probably came from the ingredients themselves, not the way they were prepared. That being said, it's pretty hard to go wrong with a burger, and the patty itself was pretty well cooked but didn't really give it the OOMF that separates a good burger from a great one. 

Salad was...okay, but looking back I probably should've tried another burger (the wheat berries and all the fruits in there made the taste quite strange)

Of course, I could've had the one ""off"" burger of the night, as this place is cram packed with at least a 1hr -1.5hr wait during dinner, and they must've been churning out burgers by the dozens.

We started to wait for our turn since 7pm on a Tuesday evening and it took us about an hour to get a table for two. Our nice and friendly server gave us really clear explanations on items on menu and he even gave us a heads-up that our food would take at least 45 minutes to prepare, as the kitchen was busy.

We ordered the following for two of us without any sides, so as to not over feed our tummies:
1) ""Foie"" burger 
The foie gras is just a spread on the bun. We weren't able to taste the foie gras spread as the taste of port wine aioli had overpowered the taste of foie gras spread. We probably won't recommend this burger, as it didn't look as appetizing as other burgers served on other tables.
2) Wheatberry-Quinoa salad
The chicken skewer was tender and it went really well with the salad. The salad is slightly on a sour side. If there is some sweet mandarin oranges or sweet peaches added to this salad, this will be perfect! The portion is good to share among 3 or 4 people.

I reviewed GR Burgr when it was at the ""other location"" but it was lost on yelp due to the alleged relocation. However, the restaurant never moved, maybe they redecorated, but it's still at the same spot in the Planet Hollywood resort right off the strip. 

Parking is a B! The PH parking is in the back of the resort and the attached miracle mile mall. It's a true workout to walk from the parking garage to the restaurant so you'll be good to chow down when you get there. 

We ordered four burgers and three sides and three drinks bill was $126. Well worth the price. The burgers are always juicy and delicious. There are a bunch of different topping combinations on the menu to chose from. 

My beef (lol) with them is (1) they exchanged the goat cheese off of the crown burger for a melty cheese which is still good but not the same, and, (2) the chips, or as we call them fries, are dry. Idk if that how they like them in England but I stick with the sweet potato fries and the onion rings for sides because both of them are awesome.

I'm not the biggest burger fan, but the patty was thick and juicy at medium-doneness without turning the bun into a hemoglobin sponge. I got the forester which has truffled goat cheese and duck bacon. There was plenty of truffle flavor, but the duck bacon wasn't anything memorable. It wasn't the best burger I've had, but it was still top notch.

My favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. The kettle chip nachos taste like an upgraded version of something you might find at the Tilted Kilt. They were good, but the hell fire wings were better. They're cut so that they're easier to eat, and they're fried perfectly so that the skin is crispy while leaving the meat moist. The buffalo sauce is not too hot and slightly sweet, but it's more like a glaze such that it doesn't ruin the crispy texture. Finally, they're topped with some blue cheese. I loved them. Still, my favorite dish was the truffle fries, and that's solely because of the truffle aoli. The truffle scent from the aoli dominates the atmosphere no matter what else you have on your table. It looks thick and heavy, but it instantly melts into a rich cloud of truffle flavor once it's in your mouth. I could've stuck my straw in the sauce cup.

Finally, that oreo creme brulee shake is great if you like rich desserts. The creme brulee pudding layer is very sweet and heavy, and the oreo milk shake layer is runny with no iciness. Getting a little bit of both in each sip is key.

While Gordon's was great, I don't feel right giving it 5 stars when comparing it to other world class burger joints. For example, I still think Chicago's Au Cheval has a much better burger. Still, it's worth a visit if you're in the area.",k2eR74OKSgQI0qn7TrGiYQ,0,0,4,amE-K8HMBvGqrf3SRtf16w

I literally moaned and talked about the shake the whole time I was drinking it. And it was gone by the time our burgers and fries came out. The burger had 3 cheeses on it and was made perfectly.

Burger patty was delicious but the bread was so forgettable. The patty itself had that smoky over flames on the grill flavor and was quite moist. Fries were subpar; I've definitely had better. 
Onion rings were a dream. They are thick, juicy, flavorful, and addicting. Covered in parmesan cheese, I couldn't get enough. The ranch was amazing too as it is made with little bits of cheese that compliment the onion rings perfectly.

One thing I must say about the chips (French fries) is that they can be so hard or stale sometimes. I'm not sure if this is affected by when I go in (the later I go in, the more stale the chips get), but it's a bit annoying because I love having fries with my burgers. The sauces are good but I would love some more universally friendly versions of them. I know the curry sauce had a very overwhelming spice to it. 

The burgers are good. The salad (pictured) is also great. It's Gordon Ramsay, what else do you expect? 

The only reason why I took two stars off was because the service is always sooooooo slow. I don't get it. I understand that it'll get a little slower when it's busy, which is fine, but even when it's not and there's barely a line, my server will always forget something or take forever to check up on me.

Food was great, as stated by my group who had the Truffle Fries, Bleu Cheeseburger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, and their off-menu special, The F-word (in honor of G-Ram's new show).

Fries come thick-cut with 2 sauces, Hell's Kitchen was not as fiery as presumed, and the F-word was mouthwateringly delicious, with its dry-aged ribeye and short-ribs. I myself had the Tandoori Chicken burger, which was on the dry side and begging for more of the scrumptiously-described tahini & mint vinaigrettes. On the other hand, love the black & white sesame bun aesthetic.

Skip the jumbo onion rings.

Service was 3/5. Kept our waters filled but the food took a good while.

The experience was not as amazing as I expected, but I'd recommend stopping by for a good beef burger.",KGxMotbTtX4hSCVGMhLiEA,1,2,3,v9HrMiOpfTSbmrCYKksD7Q

Unfortunately, they changed their menu recently. 

I always get the Hells Kitchen Burger! It has a nice heat to it. I always have to share because their burgers are pretty big. 

Since they no longer have the gooey fries, I got the kettle chip nachos instead. They were a decent substitute, but still miss them! 

The fries are more like steak fries. They had the texture as if the fries have been sitting under a heat lamp. It was crispy but a strange crispy.

The fact that I am still craving the Hell's Kitchen burger after few months proves that it was memorable.  The patty was juicy and not heavily seasoned.  I could taste the natural flavor of the beef and each ingredient inside the burger added a different layer and dimension to the bite.  The whole burger felt thoughtful and made complete sense.  I've never felt that way about a burger before so that was a first.  I should've ditched Fish & Chips and went back here last vegas visit.  

Truffle fries were superb.  I am picky about my truffle fries.  Sometimes they can feel like when you're trapped in an elevator with someone with way too much perfume.  Not this one.",Srn9A0mJroBvpovc3z8hrw,0,0,5,OpCYzJK4TtdXsfKZqMt9Ow

I did manage to take one bite of the burger my husband ordered, but that's all I could muster.  I must say, for that one bite, it was OUTSTANDING.  The beef literally melted on my tongue, and it was easy to tell it was very high quality.  The flavors were excellent, and while there was more waiting for me to eat, I just couldn't.  Everyone else devoured their burgers and 2 types of fries that were ordered (plain and truffle fries).  Oh, if only I was feeling better........ but for that one bite, yeh, I am reporting excellence on that.

Gordon Ramsey Burger is located in a very heavily smoke-filled Planet Hollywood, so if you are sensitive to smoke, beware.  Please also note that the wait-time can be quite long.... no matter what time you go !!  They do not accept reservations.",p4UcEYTLJyh96o1R8wrJaQ,11,7,4,4mt91A5FzUmDXAi66wwtvQ

I did a review for this restaurant before but I see yelp created another page for it so I will update you guys on this one. This is my second time here and the experience was just as good as the first. It's located inside of Planet Hollywood not too far from PF Chang's. This time, we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes in line before being seated. The last time...we simply walked right in. If you have a group of three or more, you will be seated a lot quicker than those with just two people. The service is fantastic! Not one complaint there. 

As per usual, the burger, the fries and the drinks are AMAZING! The flavor is intense and the burgers just melt in your mouth! The fries are big enough to share (try the truffle fries). As expected, it's not expensive but it's not cheap either. A drink gets is $13 and the burgers are between $15-$30.  

I would recommend the Crown Burger or the Backyard burger if you are looking for something simple. I'm definitely going to try the lobster and shrimp burger next! I hear great things about it!",8nOAfr6VEl4r77W15RU4AQ,5,3,5,J7bKju2WFEFk52VskZlhvw

In fact, our wait was 5 minutes max, which was great. The parmesan truffle fries were in fact kick-ass, and the Caesar salad with chicken was pretty nice (I liked the little fancy touches of 2-3 other greens besides the iceberg lettuce) and amazingly enough, adding chicken on was ONLY $1. Say what? This was two skewers of chicken freshly grilled. Usually chicken is $3 or more as a salad add-on, so I was impressed, skewer or no skewer. 

The downside is, of course, the wait on the burger. Like don't come hungry, cause you will be left hungry for a-whi-le. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, but it was more in the 45 plus range. More accurately, an hour plus but we had appetizers so it didn't feel that bad. The couple next to us only ordered burgers though; it got to the point where they complained, and their burgers were delivered first with a free appetizer, so maybe it worked out? 

As for our burger, we got the mushroom to split. They are able to cut some burgers in half, but ours had bacon, so it was no-go. By then, I had filled up on fries, water, salad, and wait-time, so I took two bites, one for the experience, one for good measure and gave up on the rest.

The meat was my favorite part; It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and everything. When it comes to portion, at first I thought it was a bit small.

I went to Gordon Ramsay Burger and I ordered a salad. Yes, the wheatberry quinoa salad. And here is comes: 

It was the BEST SALAD I have ever had in my life. 

I'm just gonna repeat myself because I know you're probably in disbelief. I went to Gordon Ramsay Burger and had the best salad of my entire life! 

I don't know when I became THAT girl that ordered a salad at the burger joint. I usually judge people who does that shit. It's like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering fried rice and orange chicken. No! That is not acceptable. (I'm Asian if you can't tell). But I did. I don't know if it's because I'm pregnant and trying to be remotely healthy for this unborn child or because I've been eating shit all week in Vegas, but something inside of me was screaming for the wheatberry salad. 

I was actually very hesitant to order it because I saw everyone around me eating burgers. And damn! Those burgers looked and smelled so good. So I thought I'd make the healthier choice and go for the salad. I knew I was gonna regret it. 

But to my surprise, it was the best decision I've made in life. It truly was. (Am I dramatic? Maybe! But food is life!) That salad was incredible! The chicken was so flavorful! Not greasy at all! The salad was full of crunch with all sorts of nuts, dried fruits, fresh veggies, and quinoa. It was epic and it was everything I wanted and more. I couldn't have dreamt of a better salad. I had asked for the dressing on the side, and I didn't even poured an ounce of dressing onto my salad! It didn't need it! It was that good!! 

The best part of the salad? It was massive! It can probably feed 3 people. Or one pregnant girl! Ha! I ate the entire thing myself even though I was so full half way through it. But I was determined not to let that deliciousness go to waste! Trust me on this- order the wheatberry quinoa salad!! You won't regret it. Your body will thank you. 

I had a bite of my friend's turkey burger and truffle fries. It was pretty darn good. I won't lie! Truffle fries are pretty greasy though. You can tell it came straight from the deep fryer and you can see the oil dripping down as you dive in for your first bite. If that's your type of thing, then go for me. For me, it was too greasy. 

I will definitely come back here! It makes me sad that we don't have this joint in SF. The restaurant is great- very modern and clean. Servers are attention and friendly. Prices are reasonable for the strip. And overall, it's just delicious! I don't know and I don't care who Gordon Ramsay is but man, he sure knows how to make an unforgettable salad!",21Yw7sljz0JqGNytZYXKCw,1,0,5,vIJq1u2H7R7cv1DuH5baiQ
4071292,2017-12-16,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This place lives up to the hype and the burgers are amazing! A friend and I stopped by here on a Friday night around 5pm. Although there was already a line, it wasn't too long and we were quickly seated in about 10-15 minutes.

The atmosphere is casual but classy and the waiters and waitresses are wonderful. Since this is called the Gordon Ramsey Burger, we both got burgers and truffle/parmesan fries.

The forest burger is a beef patty topped with tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, and duck bacon. It was sinfully savory and the buns are crispy and buttery without being overly heavy. The patty was cooked to perfection (caramelized edges with a hint of pink on the inside) and the goat cheese gives an unexpected tang to tickle the taste buds in a delightful way. The mushroom lend the burger an overall mellow earthy tone. Lastly, the duck bacon complements the tangy cheese well with its saltiness. However, I would have preferred the bacon to be thicker since this slice was too thin to bring out the meaty and fattiness of duck meat.

The tomato sauce and truffles aioli sauce for the parmesan fries are really good! The tomato sauce tastes like Italian sweet gravy and the truffles aioli is creamy, earthy, and savory. However, I prefer my fries to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries I received were dry on the inside and out.

The service was very good, but the burger could have been hotter when it arrived. When we received the burger, it was lukewarm which means that it was sitting out for a while before being brought to our table.

Overall, good meal and very good service. Gordon Ramsey Burger did not disappoint!",-1MF2tosrw2WcCxeVNk81Q,2,0,4,3Ej1Avx4XPAS8ehoZfplSQ

Apparently when you have a party of 3 or more, you can leave them your number and they will text you when you're table is ready vs less then 3 you just wait in this long looking line.  Either way it's a long wait.  When we got the text, we waited another 6 min for them to clean the table and finally we got seated.  Yay!

Most of us ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger because of our waiter's recommendation for first timers.  We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries and beer battered onion rings to share.  And Creme brulee shake and brown butter caramel pecan shake to wash down the greasy food.  The patty was melt in your mouth delicious!  I ordered medium rare and it came perfectly cooked.  My issue with the burger was that it was INCREDIBLY salty.  I recall a bite where it felt like I was eating salt straight up and could feel the crunchiness of the salt on my teeth.  Maybe the salt was spread on unevenly or extra was spread on after?  Had the same issue with the fries where it was just too salty.  The onion rings were ok but nothing to rave about.  I loved the oreo shake part to my creme brulee shake but it turns out to be overwhelming with creme brulee on top and on the bottom.  It was just too rich for me to finish and felt kind of sick sucking up creme brulee on the bottom.  I'd recommend just order the oreo shake without the creme brulee.  Everyone liked the pecan shake but I prefer something sweeter when it comes to shakes.

I think overall maybe I just had a really high expectation for this place and it really fell short for me: food and service.  I love Gordon Ramsay and I'm a huge fan of his show and it saddens me to write this review but   everything was just okay and no way in hellz am I gonna wait an hour and a half ever again for mediocracy.",Mqn0ms4csuvWtjCv6HStcA,22,19,3,-gUAJK0eg0qdjkmIv3_H3Q

Especially by the amount of people that were waiting in line to get in.  So I assumed it would be amazing. We each got a burger and we told the hostess to put it to go  because There was a long wait for a table . But what I didn't know is that our food literally took  like 40 minutes or more. Once we got it we saw that it didn't come with fries or chips or anything. Just a big box for a plain tiny burger. That doesn't have a taste to it and the worst part is that it was raw in the centerof the meat. I was so disappointed especially for the price that you pay for it.

At the end of the day, it is burger and fries, yet I felt like I paid such a high price for what I was getting. Two burgers, one order of fries and three beers was over $90 after tip, which seems extreme to me. I get that you pay a premium on the strip, but this seemed out of hand.

6.  Onion rings came out quickly and were outstanding. Very light batter that held up to frying and the two sauces provided. Sauces were nice mix between sweet and spicy.
7.  Despite delay, burger was cooked perfectly. Love the toasted bun with sesame (light and dark). Fries were solid. Not greasy. Nicely salted -- and I like a lot.

I am sure there will always be a wait to eat here because of how amazing the burgers are. This was my first time and we waited about 20 minutes to get seated which wasn't too bad. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super attentive and friendly. Greeted us immediately with drinks and gave his recommendations and what the best items on the menu are. We went with what he recommended which was the famous Hell's Kitchen Burger. It took a while for the burger to come out, which he warned us about, so we also ordered the truffle fries to snack on while we waited. The fries were okay, but I may be bias because I am a thin cut fry person and their fries are thick wedge fries. They were good, but would have been AMAZING if they were thin cut. All that matters is the main course, which was out of this world!! It was on the spicy side, but my goodness! The bun was absolutely perfect and the burger literally melts in your mouth.

UPDATE: I love how they ""renovated"" so they could start over on Yelp. {/end sarcasm mode}

TL;DR: Go to Bobby's Burger Palace if you feel you must eat a celebrichef burger while in Vegas. Half the price, better burgers, better service, little to no wait, no tipped employees.

Don't believe everything you see on TV! I'm so disillusioned. Gordon, you were my favorite celebri-chef. I forsook Anthony Bourdain for you! I have been following Gordon religiously and watching every show of his I could get my hands on ever since I discovered F Word and the original Kitchen Nightmares on BBC America 12 years ago. My husband and I have been quoting him for over a decade. I have even made Amy's Baking Co references in a Yelp review. But the food here was NOT ""simple, fresh, and vibrant,"" as Gordon could often be heard barking at hapless failing restaurateurs.

The fries were hard and over-seasoned. The burgers, which we ordered blue rare, came out well done. Sending it back did not fix it (and I fear the saliva added by our disgruntled waiter did not improve the flavor either). They also tasted burnt and oversalted, and both burger and bun were dry and crumbly - the former because it was overcooked, the latter because it was old (tasted even older than the bread we used to throw away for being too stale at the bakery I worked at while putting myself through college). The shakes were too sweet to choke down more than a mouthful or two and had way too much crap going on. Not just the shakes, EVERYTHING down to the sauces was needlessly complicated: some additional flourish for the ""coolness factor"" or something, not actually contributing anything to the flavor, and often going one step beyond to actually detracting. The food was as gimmicky and smug about its cleverness as the name BURG(ordon)R(amsay). No hint of simplicity, freshness, or vibrance. Just over-complication, massive overcooking, and smugness.

We left 3/4 of our food untouched, which is like a 9th circle-level sin for us. The servers just cleared our plates without caring to ask if there was a reason we didn't eat very much of it.

So not worth the hype, the price, or the long wait.

If I were Gordon I would want to make sure that every restaurant that bore my name and likeness had service and food I was proud to put my name on, but I guess he would rather watch his bank account grow than work to protect the reputation he sweated blood for years to attain.

The only reason why I can't say this was the worst overpriced meal I've ever had is because BEAST exists.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,2,0,1,gx6cpC9HmAB0jx3QMm5vOg

This was our Thanksgiving dinner this year.  My older son and I came here because the younger son was acting up.  This was my son's choice.  I was game.

There was a bit of a wait for two, but not too bad considering it's Vegas, at early dinner time, on Thanksgiving Day.

When we were seated the server came over pretty quickly.  They have a pretty simple menu of burgers and sides, but all of the offerings looked very interesting.  

They have a good selection of draught beers on tap.  I started with a Boddington's - delish.  

For an appetizer, we ordered their take on nachos - kettle cooked potato chips topped with corned beef and smothered in a cheese sauce.  OMG!  Wow!  This was sooo good.

My son ordered the basic burger and I ordered the Hog Sandwich for our entrees.  My son really liked his burger.  He plowed through it like nothing.  My sando was pretty amazing.  It had a ground pork patty topped with pulled pork, bacon, and onion strings.  Whoa!  Porky heaven.

The only hiccough of the meal was that they ran out of two beers that I tried to order.  I ordered the first off the menu.  The server came back and told me that they were out, but he also brought two tasters.  I really liked one, so I ordered it.  He came back a few minutes later and told me they were out of that one too, but he gave me a free glass of his other recommendation.  I did not expect that at a big name Vegas restaurant, so all worked out fine.

Definitely a great place for a casual meal in Vegas.  Based on this experience, I want to try some other GR restaurants.",AvSynsN0GKlZUPR5Ib1PCw,3,3,5,Bb3IVJupZTafl8iKC8mb9g

4381813,2018-06-29,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"We were pretty impressed with our first visit so we decided to visit again this trip. The wait wasn't too long at 7-8pm on a Thursday night - about a half hour for a party of 2. 

Since we weren't too hungry we decided to share the blue burger, chips with curry sauce, and a brown butter caramel pecan shake. Our server came by pretty quickly to ask us if we wanted to order any drinks (they're all listed on an ipad) but we declined seeing as how we already packed in quite a few drinks by that time. From there the service went a bit downhill, our server wasn't very friendly and also got our order wrong (order wasn't written down, just remembered). We ended up with the correct burger and drink but truffle parmesan fries instead - we decided not to send this back since it looked pretty good and the price difference is pretty small anyway. One thing to note, the food took a very long time to come out; we finished pretty much the entire shake before the fries came out. 

As for taste, the blue burger is a solid if you like blue cheese, relatively simple but done well. I will say that I enjoyed my forest burger from our last visit a bit more. We loved the fries though, especially the truffle sauce which was extremely decadent. The shake was superb and I like how there were caramel pecans right on top - would definitely recommend trying out their shakes!! 

We essentially didn't see our server for the rest of our meal and had to wait quite a while to get the check. 

With everything said, I still like Burger- the food is great & well priced, plus the poor service seemed to be a relatively isolated incident. The tables in other sections near us seemed to have pretty attentive servers & our server from our last visit was also extremely friendly and attentive.

By the time we were at the front of the line, we were super hungry - but we were told that a party of four would take 45 minutes longer, so we ended up splitting our party into pairs. 

We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Kettle Chip Nachos. The burger was really good! The beef patty was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. However, I was extremely disappointed with the nachos as the chips were basically drenched in oil. The chips were soggy from all the oil in this dish. One of my relatives felt sick to her stomach after eating this dish, and she was sick for the next few days of our trip. 

Overall, I would not line up again and wait to eat those nachos. If I come back to Vegas, I'll be heading over to Ramsay's Fish and Chips instead!",6aABpvJaTTy2gY0XomPUFQ,3,0,2,OC22pcbqoSUaSpOsbeESzg

+Blue Cheeseburger: I got this because I love blue cheese. I asked for the spicy mayo on the side because I didn't want it to be too saucy or spicy.

I found the exterior super exciting and cool looking. The wait was max 10 minutes. 

Once we walked in and were seated, I was quite impress on how fast that was, however when I saw how big the restaurant was, my expectations of the quality of the food decreased. Thank goodness the ending was not a disappointment.

Being a huge burger snob of course I asked the extremely kind gentleman that assisted us for his recommendations. He gladly recommended a seasonal burger that was off menu. He provided the details of the ingredients and I was convinced so I ordered it ( forgot the name but it was beef with short rib, it was amazing!!!). I also ordered the fries that came along with a curry & chipotle ketchup. Me not being a fan of curry, chipotle nor ketchup, the thought didn't fancy my interest so in addition to what was already in front of me I still went ahead requested for regular ketchup. I ended up wanting to get the full experience of their touch to the fries so I went ahead and tasted both the curry and chipotle ketchup resulted in making my taste buds tingle and I ended up not being able to stop dipping my fries in the curry... wowsers..

Let's cut this long story to a conclusion...

The burger exceeded my expectations.. Yes, it did!! Would I try this place again.. Yes, I would definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas!!

Excellent Service and even though we were warned that we would wait a little while for our food, the wait was not as bad as we thought.

I stood in line for about 1/2 an hour just before 3pm on a Saturday, which was understandable. After being seated at the bar, the server took my order within a few minutes.  I ordered the Hog Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and a Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake.  The shake came out within 5 or 10 minutes, followed shortly by the fries.  However, it was somewhere between 35 to 40 minutes before my burger came out. The server had warned of a 25-30 minute wait, and I had accepted that. However, by then, the fries were lukewarm, and my shake had been devoured as it was absolutely delicious.

The overwhelming memory of the Hog Burger was its dryness. The generous serving of patty was cooked to a perfect medium as suggested by the server, but I found myself requiring a lot of water to offset the dryness of the entire burger.  On one hand, this was a nice change to the usual grease-drenched burgers at other establishments, but perhaps a light spread would make the burger more enjoyable. 

The Truffle Parmesan fries were just ok. There was a light sprinkle of parmesan over the top of the fries, which lead to a rather uneven distribution of the cheese once you got to the fries hiding at the bottom, especially since they were served in a cone.  There were two interesting sauces; one was red and mildly spicy(chipotle ketchup) and the other was a yellow creamy blend(truffle aioli).

One of the barbacks/assistants made my service experience excellent. He filled in for my server and refilled water regularly and noticed that I was scrutinizing my prestained fork and offered to replace it without my having to ask.

I came here with my boyfriend around 11pm but called before to see what time their kitchen closes. The waitress said their kitchen is open until 11:55pm, which is nice since they actually close at 12am and they are willing to still serve you. 

Upon arriving, we see the famous Gordan Ramsay sign lit up with fire behind it. We were super excited about trying this place out, especially after reading the reviews. 

I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger medium rare along with the truffle fries. Nothing stood out about it. I've honestly had better burgers for a better price. I usually prefer avocado in my burger to be more guac style but here they cut it into slices for you. Also, there is tomato in it and it was cold and stood out (in a bad way) from the burger. 

For the name, I expected better food. The price was decent since everything on the Strip is usually around there though.

SERVICE:
The service was the most upsetting as the waitresses were extremely frustrating. I came with a party of 9 with them originally saying 45 minutes. After an hour, I asked of the status and a lady stated that ""it'll be 10 more minutes since they are now cashing out."" Half an hour later, we, again, asked of the status. Their response: ""oh, we gave it to another group. Sorry. It'll be 15 more minutes."" Each time we asked of the status, they would change the story of which table was ""finishing up"" and that it would be ""another 15 minutes.""

Guess what? 40 minutes later, they still have not gotten us a table and we are the longest waiting group. Total wait time was 2.5 hours when they originally promised 45 minutes. 

The service is poor and frustrating for such a famous location. If this location were to improve, improve the waitresses as they are just willing to improvise false stories and wait times. 

FOOD:
We decided to stay for the food since they made us wait 2.5 hours for a table they kept promising. The food was mediocre at best. The poutine was extremely salty and would bring even the healthiest person into hypertensive crisis. The meat was overcooked despite ordering a medium-- just overpriced for the hype. I am disappointed to give this a poor review especially since I am a big fan of Chef Ramsay. 

ADVICE:
Avoid this place. Just check out the Bobby Flay burgers near by. They treat you with respect there and the food is superior.",qyxjVGU76V6Ch2EqOO3SoA,2,2,2,2ajxfxHLyTRBbKFyb4Th_w

The wait to sit is long. The wait to get your food is even longer. Burgers are around $15 and up. Fries are not included and they will run you $8, $11 if you want truffle fries. 

The burger patties are DRY. I wanted to try a specialty burger so I went with the Hog Burger ($18) and BF went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15). Both of the patties were dry. We also got the truffle fries ($11) and they were steak fries which I am not a fan of. Also, they came out lukewarm. Now, I have no problem with the price if the burgers are good. I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so I understand the high prices. But if I'm paying for those prices, I expect it to be good. I've had super premium dry age beef burgers upwards to $26 to greasy spoon burgers, and I love them all as long as they are good. I rather eat In-N-Out, Shake Shack, even Five Guys that I don't like that much over Gordon Ramsay Burger. Even if they are the same price. 

The service is a whole 'nother thing. We waited close to an hour for the burgers to come out. The server explain that it takes them 45 minutes to an hour to cook the burgers. At least they could have given us the fries beforehand? And how come some people got their stuff quicker than us? We were highly suspicious they dropped our order or something went wrong in the back. Around 30 minute mark, we asked about our order and they said our burgers were next. Another 15 minute and no burgers. 50 minutes ish, the burgers come out and a bit later the manager comes over to apologize and explain, but there isn't much of an explanation. He says he'll get us a free beer or a shake but I know I'm gonna be way too full for that. I'd rather he comped the mediocre fries or something but oh well.

In the end, the bill was over $60 for two burgers, fries, and a beer. And a highly regrettable choice of meal for our short time in Vegas.",Wez_YoTdzSxsBWPvx-leaA,2,0,2,7vDP_PpzXTOB0hZZARLgwg

Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and truffle fries ($11) to share. The burger was delicious, with a nice kick of heat. Perfectly cooked. The truffle fries were okay - the parmesan was a little overpowering and seemed to absorb much of the truffle oil. 

The place is located in Planet Hollywood. It's got a very modern posh look. We came at 11:30am on a Tuesday and had no wait for food...unfortunately after ordering, our food took at least 30 minutes to come out! Luckily I was in good company so there was plenty to talk about but it really was a long time for burgers and fries. Service was just okay, as the server only came by once early on in our wait. The server was knowledgeable about the menu but really didn't display much interest in us after we ordered. The place also doesn't take reservations, so  it can get crowded at peak hours.

Bottom line: It's as tasty as you'd expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. A little pricey but it's Vegas and it does have the Ramsay name. Prepare for a length wait for the food, sadly.

Anecdote: The table of four next to us also had a long wait for their food, so much so that the manager came out to talk to them. They waited for over 25 minutes, which apparently is the policy there. We definitely waited just as long, but no manager came to talk to us - probably because we are potatoes.

We told a passing waiter and were moved a couple tables down by the manager, although I'm not sure they ultimately did anything about the cockroach.

Since I don't eat meat I decided to go for the Portobello mushroom burger which was over $20. I shared onion rings, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries with others. The burger itself wasn't that memorable and the fries were not the best. I think the onion rings were good though.

Def pack your patience and don't come too hungry! 

Lobster and shrimp burger - saw it on ""Worth It"" Buzzfeed channel aka basically  what we came for. In sum, it reminded me of eating a bunch of shui mai  (dim sum dumplings) sandwiched into a burger. Not exactly how I imagined it.. tasted fine but a little plain to be honest. With pickled  carrots as the only topping, it became boring almost immediately. 

Hells Kitchen's burger - traditional burger with jalapeños chili and avocado slices - tasty but compared to Holstein's the night before, it was pretty forgettable. Safe choice for those trying out Gordon Ramsey's burger for the first time though - original flavor with a slight twist. 

Sweet potato fries - game changer! - going to start dusting all my fries in powdered sugar.

The lady friend and I came here to get our traditional vacation burger fix.  No matter the trip, we always end up at a local burger establishment.  We decided on this one because of the namesake celebrity chef.  The restaurant has a very chain like feel and it's extremely busy.  The wait staff is flying around in circles trying to hurry up and turn those tables!  They want you to scarf down those 20.00 burgers so they can get the next sucker in here to buy a 20.00 burger.  

I had the farmhouse burger which comes with a fancy cheese, fancy bacon and a fried egg.  They cook the burgers to order and the fried egg oozes out upon 1st bite.  The burger is actually pretty damn good but it's 17.00 and comes with nothing else.  The fries are fresh cut and have to be ordered separately for 8.00.  Now the fries will feed 2.  We each ordered 2 beers to wash it down.  4 beers, 2 burgers and 1 fry and I spent damn near the same money as a 5 star restaurant back home in Nola.

The aioli wasn't overpowering and complimented the other flavors of the burger, I'd order it again! Truffle fries are a must when I come here, and the truffle dipping sauce is soo good.

4679939,2017-04-28,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This restaurant is terrible value in my book.  The service is terribly slow.  We (party of two) waited ten minutes to be seated (not a big deal), then after we ordered our drinks (water) it took another ten minutes to get them and be able to put our order in (not a big deal).  Then, it took us almost an hour for us to get our food (very big deal).  The menu is essentially just burgers and fries (we ordered two burgers and one order of fries) which are two of the simplest and fast cooking meals one could order at a sit-down restaurant (an entire industry known for ""fast food"" is built around burgers and fries).  It should never take that long to serve these items.

Again, service was inattentive.  We tried the sauce that came with the fries and didn't like it so we waited at least five minutes for our server to walk by so we could ask for Ketchup.  She said sure and returned with a third cup/dish of the same sauce.  We both tried it and looked at each other in amazement.  We waited at least five more minutes to be able to ask if there was any real Ketchup.  We were advised that there was not.  This put us over the edge.  My girlfriend like simple burgers with Ketchup and I, having already started eating mine (we were starving when we sat down), felt like the burger was mediocre (not a difficult item to make tasty).  Additionally, the fries (more like potato wedges) were bland and mostly hard - a condition that would have been easily mitigated with some Ketchup.  We finished our burgers in extreme disappointment.

Upon finishing, it took another 5-10 minutes for our plates to be cleared and then another five or so for our check to come back.  After providing my credit card, it took 5-10 minutes for it to be picked up and several more to be brought back to sign.  Once I had the check signed, we waited for our server to return to ask for a box for the nearly untouched order of fries so we could take them home and eat after getting our hands on some Ketchup.  We waited at least five minutes.  She came back shortly with the box and we promptly left the table.

On my way out, I spoke with the/a manager and advised him that the operations of the restaurant are poor and need work.  I also strongly suggested that the restaurant, a ""traditional American"" burger joint offer real Ketchup to which he responded ""that will never happen.""  That doesn't bother me because I will never eat there again, but I think it highlights a major issue with the restaurant.  The restaurant is not focused on providing a premier dining experience for customers but is solely geared toward attracting people with the brand name.  As is evidenced by the restaurant name, and Gordon Ramsay's face all around the restaurant as if he is superhuman, this restaurant, and Gordon Ramsay, is the poster-child for arrogance.

This is an expensive burger-joint.  $15 for just a burger, with no slaw or fries included.  Burgers are an easy dish - creating your own doesn't make you special.  Fries are simple as well.  Homemade fries are great, and always a little unique.  But let's not pretend as through they are a specialty item.  And Ketchup.  Well, Ketchup has been around a long time and is an All-American condiment.  To suggest that Gordon Ramsay could create a house sauce that is so good that nobody would ever prefer real, traditional Ketchup...is insane.  To call the house sauce ""Ketchup"" is misleading.  Not to mention that the sauce is actually terrible.  It tastes nothing like Ketchup and, to us, resembled a smoky shrimp cocktail sauce.

All said, I could never recommend this place. Food is sub-par, service is poor, and customer satisfaction is not a priority.  Arrogance permeates the atmosphere as the restaurant relies on the brand name to lure customers to pay high prices for cheap food.

Note:  The couple sitting next to us left in disgust shortly after receiving their meals.  We were only able to infer that something was terribly wrong with the food.  Either a grossly undercooked burger, a hair or other item in the food, or...no Ketchup (I had seen her spreading a giant glob of sauce on her bun/burger shortly before the server was beckoned to her.  The woman asked that her plate be taken away and declined an offer for any substitute dish.  The man stopped eating and asked for the check.  The manager who I ultimately spoke with, brought the couple the check and made an apology.  Note, he still brought the check which the man paid (over $60).  This does not seem like a genuine apology nor does it indicate any acceptance of responsibility on behalf of the restaurant.",-uk6ybHcuXNWGb8fUaDFFQ,0,0,1,LR0epHmVpzXMU724K-hLfg

Price: super reasonable prices especially for the Gordon Ramsey name and it being located on The Strip! 

Appetizers came out super quick, took about 2 minutes, it came before our server even gave us our water lol
Kettle Chip Nachos: instead of traditional tortilla chips they use kettle cooked potato chips, I feel like this is up to personal preference. I wasn't too crazy about it cause the toppings made the chips soggy but everyone else in my party loved it. They weren't skimp on the meats either. 
Beer Battered Onion Rings: super crispy and a good portion to share. Good but nothing too special.
Parmesan Truffle Fries: the truffle dipping sauce was really good! Again, good size to share with 2-3 people. This didn't come out until the burgers which I thought was thoughtful of them haha.
Cheddar Ale Soup: I wouldn't recommend, it was kind of plain and super super salty.

Took about 15-20 minutes after appetizers for the burgers to come out Our party ended up getting very similar burgers but all the burgers were excellent and cooked perfectly to medium rare, they were also hot temperature wise which I loved, I hate lukewarm food! :)

Hell's Kitchen Burger: LOVED IT! Two of us got this and both reviews were a thumbs up. Super juicy and moist, buns are important to me in a burger and I loved how the bread never got soggy. They weren't skimp with the avocado and there was a spicy kick but nothing too overwhelming. TIP: try adding some of the truffle sauce from the fries on this, heavenly!

Farmhouse Burger: who could go wrong with a fried egg? The mangalitsa bacon really pulled this burger together! I couldn't help but steal a couple bites! 

Backyard Burger: a classic burger but nevertheless a good burger!

Can't wait to be back and try some of the more exotic options like the Blue Cheese or Foie Burger, I love foie gras.

For the burger, I ordered the special which had a teeny tiny bit of rib meat thrown on top of the patty. Patty was a nice thickness, but the diameter was terribly disappointing.  Cabbage slaw in the burger was typical and nothing special.

Amazing Show. The sous chef ran the pass and was in complete control of everything that was presented.  Now to the burger.  With the first cut the perfectly runny yolk ran down the burger.  The mix of flavors with the turkey chopped burger with duck confit was amazing.  The bun was grilled to perfection.

We look forward to this and make this place a stop each time in Vegas. The burgers really are that good.  The wait this time was ridiculous, over 2 hours at some times!  Luckily on Friday at about 6pm the line was only 30 minutes so we again got our burger groove on.

Our server (can't remember his name) but he was spot on, super friendly and helpful and very attentive.  It's hard to have this type of attitude when a place is as busy as this place is so kudos to great service. 

The only downside to this visit is that some of the past menu items are gone.  :-(   No more Euro burger, it was a favorite and the new lineup of shakes is missing some of the old and best ones!  We actually declined on getting a shake this time due to there only being 2 offered that just did not sound so great.

We never get the fries as they are really expensive and quite frankly better at any Habit Burger.  Nothing special with them at all.  Sorry Gordon, the chips just ain't happening.

I wish the server would have told me that the ""house wine"" was $14 per glass when I ordered it, I might have changed my mind as it was really nothing special.  I guess I should learn to ask first.

In any case. Staff was a bit too casual if you ask me. One staff member loudly saying to the bartender how he lost his virginity to that song (kinda funny) but then proceeding to talk about how the other guy is going to get fired, etc.

Now to the actual burger. Got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Good combo with the jalapeno, guac, avo, but overall unimpressive. Slightly overcooked patty, but more troubling was that it wasn't exactly a great patty. 

More troubling is the fact that the extra Truffle Fries I ordered (yes, Fries cost extra)... were actually Chips (the English kind, not the Lays/Pringles kind) instead of fries. Now since most Americans restaurants serve fries for their ""Fish & Chips"" instead of Chips, I'll give him a pass on this one, but seriously he should know better.

Then again he's probably re-using them on his Fish & Chips joint few blocks down the road.

My breakdown for the 5 star and the suggestion to get it over Shake Shack is as follows:

Service (4.5)
Its a dine in with server style so of course you dont have to self serve like you would at Shake Shack. The server I had was pretty friendly and attentive during the whole time. 

Drinks (4.5)
While Shake Shack does serve beer, Ramsay Burger has a lot more options and varieties including cock tails and wines. I tried their Irish Mule which was apparently the most popular drink on the cock tails selection. It was as how the server described it, not too sweet but not too overwhelmingly strong. I believe she told me it was composed of jameson, some beer, probably syrup and lime. 

Burger (4.5)
I tried the Hell's Kitchen which seemed to be composed of provolone, patty, avocado, jalapeno and tomato. Yes the burger was on the pricey side of $15 without fries but shake Shacks burgers all average around $9-11 as well. For the quality of the beef patty and the structure of the burger, I d say this was worth it. 

Fries (4.5)
Ordered the parmesan truffle fries which came with two sauce. One reminded me of honey mustard flavor and the other close to marinara sauce like taste. But it was surprisingly very good as the parmesan grits and the fries texture blended very well together. It was around $9-10 which once again like the burger, is on the pricey side but its big enough to share between two people. So its not a bad deal at the end of it. 

Overall, my friend and I were both pleased with Ramsays burger and did not regret not going to Shake Shack.",boiI_xmXWNhUCskEyM5oCQ,4,1,5,y81zOl8VBH5hfK0mFBwCJA

The waiting line is about an hour to be seated and if you are a vegetarian, there is a choice of a portobello sandwich on the menu, but you are gonna pay for it at ($17)!  I have heard rumors that Gordon despises vegetarians, so this just confirms it for me!  He permits you to come to his restaurant but you will pay 2 more dollars for that non-meat sandwich! 

It took about 30 minutes for our food to be served.

My partner got the the burger. It was too salty and the tomato had not been cut properly because it had the brown end still on one of the pieces. What Gordon, you allow that?

The plain french fries ($8) were fresh cut and fine, but a bit stale/cold when we got them to our table. They do not come with the burgers, so you would need to order them separately. The positive thing is they are a large portion that can be shared between 2 people.

Overall, it was not a great meal and we will not be back. We were expecting much more from you Gordon.

We had about a fifteen minute wait, and the hostess told us it would be another five minutes or so, if we could just wait back within the roped-in line we had just come from. Sure, no problem. 

There were already people who gathered in that line, and because we had begun there, we simply stepped three feet to the side, so we weren't on top of anyone. 

Because we weren't specifically in the square foot she was referring to, she took a customer who was behind us in line first.

You couldnt smash it down but you couldnt eat it like a normal burger. The Hog burger was mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw.

I ordered the ""Foie"" Burger which had pate foie gras (spread), chèvre, port wine aïoli, frisee. It had a decent foie spread but at the same time, it was a little tangy from the aoili. It was slighty more on the tangy side so it could put down some people who dont like that flavor contrast. Luckily, my burger was manageable and it really did come out medium rare like I requested. At least they did something right. 

Overall, the server was great, the food was decent and the wait was horrible. I do not think I would return to this location when I am back in Vegas. Instead, I may check out his Steakhouse or go back to the Pub location.",58o-C814EC-P7NtRXugNHA,0,0,2,SpuBnm1Ahdw2bOtDIAzOdw

we got in line at around 8. there is two lines for big parties and smaller parties. i believe if you are more than 4 then you go into a separate line. the bigger line seemed to go faster just because there were so many small parties of 2 and 4 that they had to wait for other tables to finish first. we waited about 30 min which is not bad at all.

once we got in it was so classy so you def pay for what you get! we got a booth table and wow the set up was beautiful and they even give you menus with his face on it and you get to keep it as a souvenir!! which i def did!!

even as you sit and wait for your food they come over and snap some pictures for you to possibly purchase.

the wait was a little long but they let us know just because they do make the burgers from scratch. they did bring our fries out earlier - i just wish the burgers were a little faster so i could eat it with the fries.


so to the most important thing: THE FOOD!!!

-just fries ($8) - literally just fries; not amazing but they were thick cut and the sauces weren't anything special.
-truffle parmesan fries ($11) - just get the regular fries. again, fries were nothing special.
-farmhouse burger ($15) - THE REASON FOR THE 5 STARS. THE BURGER WAS AMAZING. highly recommend and all my friends were happy with their other burger choices.

Cons: ridiculous wait time, pretty expensive

The wait is crazy. If you are not a Total Rewards member, it may not be worth it because depending on the day, you might have to wait up to two hours to get a table. When seated, the service does move pretty quickly. Our waiter was very nice even though he was handling like dozens of people. 

At our table, we had the Hell's Kitchen burger, Portabella burger, and Backyard burger, and the Truffle Parmesan fries. All of the food was awesome. It's pretty pricey, and may not be worth it for some which is completely understandable. I don't think Burger is one of those ""must go to"" places in LV, but the food is still really good.

My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay and we always watch his shows so we knew we had to check out this place! We went around dinner so obviously we knew it'd be a long wait. It was a 90 minute wait and I was totally willing to stand in line but the hostess took our number and told us we could walk around the hotel/casino and they'd text us when a table was ready. I looove that! We ended up going to a cool bar while we waited and then getting a text to come back, so convenient! We were seated immediately and ordered our burgers. They let us know they take a longer time because they hand make them so we were expecting a longer wait than normal but it was sooo long! Maybe it was because we were hungry but it felt about 3x as long as you'd normally wait at a steakhouse. When we got the food it was absolutely delicious!! I got the UK Burger and could only finish half of it because it was so filling and tasty! Still craving it!

I didn't care for the cocktail much but that could have just been my own tastes. It took forever to get our server's attention to ask for the bill, and then for them to finally come back with the bill. When we finally got them to take our card it took a while for them to bring it back again! This was frustrating because the entire process of waiting for food etc had already taken so long, I thought the checkout process would at least have been swifter. When they finally brought the receipts to sign I was excited-- i thought ""write a tip, sign, then finally LEAVVVE!! YES!"" But nooo... turns out the server charged BOTH bills (we had two groups) on my ONE credit card even though we had given them two cards and explained. Had to wait yet again for them to correct this and I'm still not sure if it was corrected since it was so busy and couldn't hear what was going on much.

As most, this place was on our bucket list but we were half prepared that it was mostly hype. And, we were right.  Granted the meat, condiments and buns (wish it was warm but more on the cold side) were fresh. Although the burger we wanted was suppose to be medium rare, it could've use another minute on the grill.  Be forewarn that their foie gras burger is actually a ""SPREAD"", not a foie gras patty. Knowing this we still gave it a shot. Knowing it's a spread we still couldn't taste the foie gras, perhaps because the bleu cheese was too over powering. If there was a must try burger, go for the Anniversary Burger (it's not on their menu) and their Seafood burger. 

As for the appetizers, the onion rings are the best of all the bunch. The wings with bleu cheese didn't work for me. The Nacho's was made with fresh chips, but for some reason the meat, sour cream and everything else didn't mesh together.

Every table was full and there were lots of staff around - which I will address later in my review. We started with the Beer Battered onion rings. MISTAKE. They had obviously been fried earlier and the re-dipped in the fryer. They had this weird powder on them which was not Parmesano Reggiano as advertised  it was strangely reminiscent of the green can Parmesan.  

Come on Gordon, that would have caused a famous f-bomb and an equally famous spit-out. Now, I know you don't oversee the day to day, but your name's on it so ya gotta own it. These things reminded me of onion rings you would get in a take out that's delivered to your house hours after they are cooked. 

My husband had the Specialty fish and crisps burger... or should I say the indistinguishable protein burger drowned in a STRING dill mayo. F-bomb... spit-out.  A specialty ... wow NO. 

I, on the other hand, had a perfectly cooked Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was a perfect medium cook, great bun, and just the right amount of sauce to be moist, but not like the fish thing over-sauced. 

Now, the restaurant itself and the service. First we waited in line for ten minutes or so and there was this bizarre fire sculpture behind the glass. It was generating enough heat to actually cook the food there. Really!!! It was 95 degrees outside in Vegas so fake fire would have been welcomed. 

The service was less than stellar as well, actually it was terrible. We had 4 or maybe 5 different people waiting on us. The guy who took the order and the check and who didn't get a great tip stood on the side and joked around with his friends the whole time. He never checked on our drinks or anything. I chalk that up to management. A well-trained  floor manager would never have let that happen.

The food service is a little on the slow side (took 15 min to bring out our appetizer and another 15-20 min to bring out our burgers) but it's due to the fact that the kitchen cooks everything to order and they take their time to ensure high quality. Plus I asked my patties to be cooked well-done which they did perfectly!

Blue burger: 5 stars! Loved the complex flavors!
Hells Kitchen burger: also 5 stars, but I prefer the Blue burger more if I had to choose between the two.

Chips and curry dip: 5 stars... super fresh potato wedges, big portion, and delicious yellow curry dipping sauce.

We were able to get a table without reservations after a moderate wait, only 30 minutes. Which is to be expected with a place this popular. 

The drink menu was creative and delivered the flavors promised  There was nothing tricky about it but in hindsight, I should have just gone with a beer. 

We ordered poutine and onion rings to get things started. The onion rings were amazing. Usually onion rings go limp and soggy almost immediately but these held up. 

The poutine, however, was just a mess of flavor. Poutine is simple. Fries, brown gravy, cheese curds and optional meat. This was needlessly a complicated dish that tried too hard and was a disappointment. 

The burgers served up were delicious but the entire table I was with ordered them cooked the same way, medium rare, based on our servers suggestion. When they arrived, however, we had burgers that ranged from rare and almost blue to almost medium. I had one of the rarer burgers and while tasty, it just became a wet mushy mess a few bites in.

5188098,2018-03-30,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"Disclaimer: I was not a happy camper (with my spouse) once I walked into this place and looked at the menu prices. I gave her the look.

OK. To start off, my family and another family were on a Spring Break trip in Vegas (don't judge). And my wife was in charge of most of the itinerary and she chose this place I knew nothing about. I guess she seen it on TV or friends or what. Well, once I walked in and glanced at the menu, I was like this place is NOT price friendly for kids and we have 3 kids with us. Ex. The hotdog was $17 (I think). Anyways I just frowned up until the point of the food arrival. 
I ended up ordering a Cheeseburger as this is what they are known for. Again, wasn't happy with the price but I went along with it as planned. This place was very elegant and well thought layout. Live fires burning all around. You could see the kitchen in a distance as food was prepared. The wait staff was exceptionally polite and friendly. We actually held a 2-3 minute conversation that was pleasant as well. We ended up changing an order after placing it and the waiter was not upset at all for changing and also offered if we don't like something to let her know and she will exchange it. So I was impressed and feeling a little more at ease about the price issue (above). 

The food arrived:
I left out the part that my spouse suggested we order 1 french fries for my entire family of 3. Once the waiter placed our fries on the table, I was like wow. I should have listened to her. Ending result, we left several fries uneaten and I hate to waste good french fries. 

Now to the burger. The burger size was a decent size. The meat looked hot and juicy. Quality of the remaining of the burger looked great. I was impressed. Once I bit into the burger, all i could say is Hmmmmm. This is pretty good. And it was as juicy and tender as it looked. Those damn fries (sweet potato) were on fire (not literally). They were VERY delicious. I wanted to make sure I ate all of those before helping with the regular fries ordered. 

Hotdog: Yes, that $17 hotdog. That thing was huge. I was thinking no way my son will be able to eat half of it. The weenie was wrapped in bacon. With that notion, I really wanted to taste it. And once I did, it was delicious. I could have ordered it for myself and been happy. My son was able to finish half of it and he enjoyed it. We were all stuffed.

I recommend this place for the food mostly, and the amazing ambience they offer. And the cleanliness and wait staff.  All of it was amazing.",e76wLkE5xBusbd6qAKivyQ,0,2,5,dVMpzohgZxRVmsjCdJEk4w

We decided on chicken wings and beer battered onion rings.  Was super excited. Expecting to be blown away, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.  The rings were made with shoe string thin onions, a lot of oil and light batter.  I literally felt like I had a cup of grease in my mouth  
The wings were very meaty, but just seemed dry to me...but honestly I'm not a great wing eater, so according to husband, these were ""pretty good.""

Burgers--Hell's Kitchen burger, the chiles add a dimension of smokiness and full round flavor.  
The Hog Burger, super huge and filling.  Very delish!
Forest Burger, my burger:  bacon fried in duck fat, patty, sautéed mushrooms, arugula and I added an egg.  Thank goodness gracious I added that egg--it added some creaminess and moisture to the burger (even though I ordered med-rare, not very juicy) that it needed desperately.  I don't know if someone over seasoned the sautéed mushrooms and put too much salt, or if the thick cut duck fat bacon lent a salty taste to the burger, but darn it, my blood pressure went up!  I had to pull out the bacon 
And I absolutely love--LOVE arugula on a burger, but the heaviness, and maybe the creaminess of the egg in combo with the arugula just didn't work.

We both are huge chef Gordon Ramsey fans, we wanted to see if his meals were as good as they looked on TV! We showed up at about 3pm on Friday. It was a 30 minute wait in line just to see the hostess! Bring comfy shoes because there is nowhere to sit down unless you want to lose your place. I did see a couple come up in front of the line and retrieve a reservation they had made, so if that is a thing they allow I highly recommend doing it. There is a large fireplace with custom ironwork. It can be very warm standing in line so make sure you have layers that you can shed. But it was worth the wait. After getting through the line, we were seated immediately. I ordered a Backyard Burger with bacon and Dubliner cheese, I'm sure it tastes authentic with American Cheese but I wanted something a little more adventurous. I ordered an IPA cause you can't have a burger without a good beer. Their beer selection had a decent variety but not overwhelming. The food came fast but not rushed, I'm sure they take their time preparing. Burger was as good as I hoped it would be. I was surprised how high the burger was stacked, I generally like burgers I can fit in my mouth and not have to cut with a fork. And the spicy ketchup that came with the fries was interesting and good! Overall great experience. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

I've watched Gordon Ramsey's burger tutorial online a million times, so I had high expectations. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium-rare as recommended. It was perfectly cooked meat, juicy, tender, well seasoned. It's hard to keep that slippery jalapeños pepper in there when you bite into it! Definitely provided a balanced kick without overpowering it, but definitely makes for messy eating and constant burger management. My bun was under-toasted for my taste, very minimal color when I opened it up. My friend's was perfectly toasted. So a bit of bun inconsistency. For a $18.40 + tip burger, I really think just a few fries could be included. Even in Vegas. Or maybe offer a half portion fry volume. It's a large burger so no way I could have finished fries and definitely not at half the price of another burger ($8-12). But I would have liked to try them. I'd still like to try the Farmhouse next time.

I realize it's a busy restaurant but I'm not sure how it could take 40 minutes to make our burgers. It was also discouraging when our neighboring table sat down after us and they got their food before us and left before we got our burger...

Maybe because we ordered some beer is why they took so long but we wanted cold beer with a good burger. By the time our burger came out beer has warmed a bit... I'm not sure if our order just got lost or entered wrong but for a high class restaurant it sure sucked. 

Onto the food: (once it arrived) the truffle fries are out of the world! They come with their house ketchup and maybe truffle mayo? It wasn't too crisp but it wasn't soggy either! We ordered one order and it was plenty for the three of us mainly because the burger was big! I recommend the first burger I think it was hell burger? It's the one with roasted jalapeños. Hands down that has to be one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly medium and the roasted jalapeños with the avocado was such a good texture! Add fries and ketchup and it was an excellent meal.

The chef takes us by hand into a mangalitsic triple delight. To start with, a moist succulent pork patty wrapped in bacon topped with slow smoked/ braised pork brisket with melted white cheddar sandwiched between toasted seeded buns. Cabbage tarragon mayo slaw coupled with crispy onions flavored with garlic, paprika, and cayenne as delectable toppings. Bread and butter pickles cutting through the saltiness of the bacon and sweetness of the brisket, completes the scrumptious package. Hog burger is definitely an ambrosial experience to relish in spite the long line to get in.

I am not sure why Ramsay cannot afford a system in which they send you a text when your table is ready. Not only do you have to wait, you have to stand next to the fire wall, which can get very hot. 

We waited in line for about 40 minutes like suckers. After we were seated, we had to wait another 15 minutes for our waitress and then an additional 30 minutes for food, so DO NOT come hungry. The burgers were good but nothing unique for $15+ each. Eureka! burgers (a chain) deliver the same quality tasting burger for a lower price and shorter wait.

Since they were busy, our waitress barely checked up on us. What was even more annoying was that when we got our check, she made big circles around multiple things on it like ""tip is not included"" and the total amount, etc. as if we couldn't read.

5369823,2018-03-04,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"To sum it up - my second visit here with the wife was false hope for quality - with the visit being saved by the shake. 

Second visit for me to Vegas and Gordon Ramsay burger joint and the atmosphere is great, starting with the flame wall at the entrance. 

My last memory from 2 years ago was amazing. I was expecting the same quality. Having been at Gordon's steakhouse the night before, our expectations were high. We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries. The wife has a cocktail (signs of alcoholism for sure ;) - and I ordered the brown butter caramel shake. 

The fries came out first, we were very hungry and the fries were excellent. The truffle Parmesan fries were square cut and crunchy with a hint of shaved Parmesan on top. The dipping sauce was amazing - some kind of mayo rendition with some type of peppers. The sweet potatoe fries were thinner cut and crunch - absolutely to die for. They had a touch of powder sugar on top, as well as some on the side if you wish to add more. The dipping sauce was a jalapeño custard mayo type of sauce and is the perfect companion to the sweet potato fries. 

A few minutes later, the burgers showed up. This is where the disappointment happened. Gordon and staff - if you ever read this - I suspect you take quality very seriously and I'm not sure if this was a one off or what but the burger was atrocious - almost not edible. It was overly salty, the bun was stale and overall over cooked (we both ordered medium). Wife and I both cook, and we would not want to serve anyone that type of quality. 

Having ordered the shake, they must have forgotten it. The server apologizes and is in awe why it was not brought out already. She proceeds to bring it in a to go cup. Man, I am glad she did. It was perhaps the tastiest sweet item we've had in Vegas all week ( the desert at Gordon's steakhouse is top notch). The brown butter and pecan were rich and creamy - it does not let you put it down no matter how full we were. We were upset we didn't go back later that evening for a second round.

In summary - the fries and shake were a solid A
The burger, which is supposed to be a signature dish, was a complete failure. Shame on Gordon Ramsay and his staff for putting out such a terrible product. We may be back for the shake but doubt it for the food.",PpKBBNUlSbsRTFAhEeWnCw,1,0,2,Wp8bfX7o-KnSfmIjopk8LA

After wandering around trying to find this place (we didn't realize it was inside of a casino), we were finally ready to sit down around 10pm. Fair warning, since this is inside a casino, you have to walk through the clouds of cigarette smoke and crowds to get to the bathroom if you need to wash up before or after your meal.

As for the menu, there are tons of really enticing options. I went for the Hells Kitchen Burger, because I love spicy foods. I must say, the burger was cooked perfectly, had incredible flavor, and did not have insane amounts of heat. There was also a seafood burger on the menu, which sounded too good to pass up! A burger patty made up of lobster and shrimp? Count me in. But because it's a $26 burger, we decided to order it and split it amongst the table so we could all taste it. The burger ended up being incredibly disappointing. I suppose we had high standards due to the fact that it was so expensive, but it did not at all resemble lobster meat and just tasted like we were biting into a burger made up of shrimp. Not great.

All in all, I feel mixed about GRB.

These are the biggest waste of money ever! They are more expensive than the burger and have very little truffle taste if any. They are also cut so thick they are essentially wedges.

Chicken wings was what I was craving for. Im not a big fan of blue cheese but it was a good combination with the wings. 
I would say the lobster burger was slightly better. The beef burger was well cook to what I ordered(medium well) 
Truffle fries were a bit too hard (i think they were coated with corn starch).

I started to get less and less interested in watching reality TV but that never stopped me from trying one of his Vegas restaurants. I know Hells Kitchen just opened at Caesar's Palace but I was dying to try Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. I was on a budget so I strictly ordered the classic Gordon Ramsay Burger with fries and just a glass of water. 

Whenever I passed by the restaurant, the line was almost out the door. Thank, God I only had to wait 10 minutes and with the bar having open seating. I quickly stay down right away when there was an open spot. I didn't bother ordering anything else but the Gordon Ramsay Burger. Honesty, it wasn't excellent or below expectations. Maybe because I'm use to having gourmet burgers so it's hard to tell the difference. Let's just say the burger was cooked just right, juicy and tender. I'd comeback here to try other items on the menu. Now I can finally cross off the Gordon Ramsay Burger off my Vegas list.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,8,6,4,GeXLIaUHYfQe0jhBpZOMKA

We got there, got seated right away. Atmosphere was just an ordinary topical restaurant nothing fancy or anything. Only eye appealing was the fire place, which made it more formal.

We ordered ~

Truffle fries - thick cut, not much flavor, came out kinda cold. Not a fan :/

My husband got the Hells Kitchen Burger W/ Bacon - he rather have 5 guys burger all day long

I got me the ultimate Burger-  lack flavor and meat was dry even when I ordered it Med 

Over all I was expecting more from this burger joint sense it is Gordon Ramsay. But there was no party or firework in our mouth. Wasn't satisfied and not worth $70. Like my husband said 5 guys are better and it's half the price.

This means that while you're told 20 minute wait you're really standing in like for nearly an hour, in front of a roasting gas flame too (to give the Hell's Kitchen aesthetics, but is terrible placement for a line). I have to point this out the lines wait because while we were waiting at end of the line the hostesses continued to tell people 20 minutes and I'd keep interjecting ""we've been waiting nearly an hour"" so those people's expectations could be more accurate. It felt they were being disingenuous to people who may have plans/shows to go to. In the end they also stopped offering people tables (except to those skipping the line) and could only offer chefs bar seating.

Once we sat down for the meal it was prepared quickly however my party agreed the burgers were really nothing special. My own Hell's Kitchen burger was kinda ruined by the half-an-avocado which just kind of slides out as you try to eat, pulling the toppings out.

The one great aspect of the food was the truffle fries and onion rings. Those truly were great, and we agreed we're worth waiting in line.

Unfortunately at the end of the night the computers all went down and no one had any orders or bills so waitresses had to go around asking for orders again to calculate bills - then said people needed to pay with cash or else they'd need to go find those carbon-copy mechanical-slide credit card machines.

The burgers are pretty lovely. Have had The pilgrim every time. Heard great things from my Indian lover about the indian themed burger.

A creme brulee milkshake shouldn't be served with whipped cream, covering the brulee top. Be sure to order without whipped cream! The milkshakes are too sweet, the creme brulee pudding is good but sweeter than a creme brulee- more like American vanilla pudding. 
I wasn't the biggest fan of the chips n gravy.

I actually like getting the shake and fries take out because I can take them home and pop the fries in the oven and shake in the freezer, so the shake is thicker and the fries are crispier. It would be grand if they were thicker and crispier, respectively, in house. Fries gotta be crispy!

I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which includes asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto aioli. It was awesome! The combination of all the ingredients meshed well together, and the avocado was perfect in the burger. 

But the WINGS THO. These were Deeeeeelicious! That buffalo sauce was perfect and not too sour with the perfect acidity, and the blue cheese sprinkles on top of the wings just completed the dish so well. The first time I came here, I ordered just the wings and had a bite of my friend's burger. He had some of the wings as well, but I just wanted to try everything since I love food.

However, the SECOND time I came here, I ordered the shrimp salad (which sucked so don't order salad) and since I wasn't satisfied, I ordered the wings. Since it was a bit much I asked for a box as well as the check since I was in a rush. I put half the wings (4 pieces) in the box, and devoured the other 4. But mannnn, I couldn't help myself and slowly but surely, I ate the wings one at a time from the box I was supposed to take home to my friend. I ate one from the to-go box and I was like, just one more. Then there were two left, and who leaves just two pathetic wings for leftovers? That's just rude giving somebody two wings, so I HAD to eat the rest... xD

Anyway, if you come here, get the wings and the burgers aren't bad too! I believe if you are a diamond or seven star reward card, you get to skip the line.

FYI both times I came here the food does take awhile to come out, so it's not the best place to go if you are in a rush.

A four star average spread over 5,400+ reviews seems like a damn good reason to leave well enough alone!  Not that it feels like much has changed.  In fact, we wouldn't have even known if our server hadn't mentioned it.  At the same time though, as modest as their remake was, the English/grammar nerd in me was pretty happy to see them put the ""e"" back into ""burger"" (yes, I get that the ""BR"" were for his initials...).

In all seriousness, the look and feel of the now-named Gordon Ramsay Burger is the same as before.  The only real changes I could see were with the menu; prices are $1-$2 higher (they don't have a discount for Total Rewards members anymore) and their burger offerings have been tweaked a bit (some have been altered, others seem to have been added/removed).  Thank goodness my friend was down to split a couple of burgers though; getting to try two burgers at the price of one = more bang for your buck!

-- TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES...$12

In terms of taste, this was exactly as good as I remember - a decent amount of parmesan, the perfect amount of truffle oil, and all around delicious.  The fries were also just as crispy and flavorful as before, though the fries weren't cut as large this time around, which was fine.

-- HOG BURGER with Mangalitsa Pork, Mangalitsa Bacon, BBQ Pork, White Cheddar, Pickles, Crispy Onions, and Slaw...$18

With pork on pork on pork, this burger sounded awesome to a pork fan like me!  Sadly though, this didn't amaze (good, but not amazing).  The pork patty was super juicy and flavorful, and I loved the onion strings and melted cheddar, but I didn't sense much of the bacon or BBQ pork.  Not sure though if it's because they were lacking or if everything else just overshadowed them.

Though the Hog Burger didn't amaze like how I had hoped, this was terrific!  Which wasn't surprising, given the classic combination of toppings - soft, lightly toasted buns, a well cooked patty, a runny egg, thick and flavorful bacon (in this case), and gooey cheese.  Definitely recommend this!

Name change aside, it was great how our experience wasn't far off from the first time around - terrific!  The menu options, the food, the service...all just as good, even despite prices being a shade higher (to be expected after four years!).  While I still want to check out Burger Bar next door at Paris, and even though I'd still give Holstein's a slight edge by comparison, GR Burger is as solid of a choice as ever.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,12,13,4,9fM53gueEOGfQ4V5JQiG2Q

I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was just a little spicy and cooked to a perfect medium. My friend got the farmhouse burger which she enjoyed but she ended up requesting a side of avocado to add because she wanted to add a bit of freshness to her burger bc the beef patty, egg, and bacon was just a lot of fat. She was told there was a $3 charge for it but when we got the checks it was $4. We were in a hurry and didn't mention it. The avocado they add to the burgers (whether it comes with it already or on the side is just one big piece of 1/4-1/3 of an avocado which I wish they'd just slice thinly and fan on top of the burger.

We also split an order of fries which was plenty between the two of us. They are steak fries and not especially crisp on the outside but tasted fine. It came with what I think was curry ketchup and a house made one so if you're just into Heinz, you might have to bring your own.

Hubby had been wanting to check this place out for the past year, so during our last trip to Vegas over LDW, I thought what the heck, let's try it out.

We waited in line for about about 20 minutes, when one of the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the chefs table. I didn't really want to stand in line anymore since I was starving, so we took it. I'll admit, they made it sound like a cooler experience when they were telling us about the chefs table, so I was a little disappointed when it was just a bar counter. Fine, I'll let this pass, my expectations were a little too high.

This is where things went pretty sour. First, it took about 15 minutes for a server to say anything to us, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and about 45 minutes to get our food. Considering that i was starving, I was in a pretty hangry mood. I couldn't believe how slow this place was. I'll give it to the cooks, they were moving pretty fast at times, but other times, they were just standing around waiting for the food to cook. I noticed that the burgers would all come at one time, about 5 or so, and then the cooks would just be standing waiting for more food to cook. It's like they would cook the food in shifts, rather than being constant. Why not just consistently be cooking, rather than putting everything together, then waiting for the food to be ready together? 

Now about the food:
I had the Tendori Chicken, lettuce wrapped. All I asked for was the chicken, and cheese wrapped in lettuce. Not too complicated right? Well, the chicken has some kind of sauce that took away the goodness of it. But since I was starving, I just let it go and ate it. But I wasn't a fan of this sauce. When I asked the server what this sauce was, she didn't know, and had to ask a chef, who looked liked he didn't know either, and then just settled it with being ""marinade"". Umm no, this was not cooked with the chicken. This was tossed on top of the chicken. There is a difference.

Hubby had the Backyard burger, no complaints from him. He thought it was ok. High quality ingredients, but not really worth the price tag.

We decided to share an order of sweet potato fries, which are huge btw! We both weren't a fan of the powdered sugar they added. I don't get powdered sugar on fries. Whats the point of it? 

Overall, I don't think I will come back. There are better burger places around Vegas. At least I got hubby off my back with trying this place out!",XP-FLX7_KKxGEwADulSOvQ,2,0,3,mzcv0q7-4jZITU59v9JXuA

I had this on my must-visit list when coming to Vegas and Gordo did not disappoint! Went right before the dinner rush, which I recommend. No wait for my party of two - walked right in. 

The menu was fancy and short - so Gordon, am I right? 

I opted for the most expensive burger on the menu, ""the foie"" . It was the second best burger I've ever had. Meat cooked medium rare as requested. Bun... the bun . Never really considered a bun to be a really essential part of the burger but this bun is special .

5560781,2017-05-02,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"WOW . . . I mean. . . WOW 
Not many places make me say WOW in a review with all caps, but Gordon Ramsay achieved that twice in Las Vegas! This was one of the two amazing meals thanks to Chef Ramsay!

Came by around 6:00pm on a Tuesday, not too busy and did not wait at all.
We sat right by the flaming wall which really gave us a Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen experience! 

I will start off with the biggest and quite frankly the only downside to the night...our waiter. All the other waitstaff and hostesses seemed so nice, friendly, easy going . . . but ours was an absolute ass. We sit down and don't even open our menu and asks what we want to eat. Really? The rest of the night he kept coming by trying to force us out. We didn't care, we ate and relaxed, left him no tip.

ANYWAYS now for the absolute best part - THE FOOD! 
We ordered a few things, I will list them from least favorite to most favorite!

Pork Belly Hot Pockets - little hot pocket like pastries filled with pork belly, bacon marmalade, and topped with tomato jam and herb aioli. The flavors were honestly great. Tender, juicy pork belly, savory sauces, but it was just so little. For $12, the price to portion ratio just gave a lack of true enjoyment! But still good none the less 


Farro-Quinoa & Chicken Salad - this was surprisingly great! A HUGE salad that my mom couldn't finish, even splitting with my dad and I, it was so much food! the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, the vegetables were all cooked to a delicious soft texture, the lemon vinaigrette was light and fresh, and the cheese added a nice creamy sweetness!
 
Jalapeño Poppers - These were the. best. jalapeño poppers. I. have. ever. had. WOW! 
they bring out a long tray of six poppers, each in their own sauce cup. The poppers are HUGE! no cheapness there. The batter is thin, amazingly crispy, deliciously flavored, and inside ...WOW! jalapeños were soft, fresh, and filled with creamy thick bacon cheddar sauce! Then the sauce each popper was dipped in . . . the cheddar ranch sauce . . .OMG . . . thick, savory, salty, rich, cheesy, ranchy, absolutely amazing combination ! 

Last but not least, the star of the night and the whole vacation - the Truffle Burger! 
Let's start with the bun . .the soft, delicious, toasted, poppy-sesame seed bun . . . excellent!
Then the thick, amazingly wood grilled patty, so juicy and tasty, perfectly paired with the following condiments . . . truffle tremor cheese, oh so cheesy, warm, creamy, slightly nutty, coating your mouth in cheesy goodness. Topped with foie gras creme fraiche, continually coating your mouth while mixing with the cheese for a  savory, salty, slightly gamey flavor and creamy texture. All of this topped with truffle aioli . . oh man, this was the softest, juiciest burger I have ever eaten! Adding some fresh crunch with the frisee lettuce, this is seriously one of my top three favorite hamburgers I have ever. ever. EVER. eaten. 

Chef Gordon Ramsay has brought Vegas an affordable, delicious, amazing dining experience with some of the best food you will ever have the pleasure to enjoy!",iqsUoSxTpzAxt8AX8OgSZA,4,2,5,MgNfQe3aTJAl1Z7FxjPcgw

We came by around 8:45 on a Sunday night and ended up waiting around 10 minutes for a table for 2. 

I opted for the Hells Kitchen burger and my husband had the Hog burger. When the food came, we got our Parmesan truffle fries (delicious!) and my HK burger, but they brought a Backyard Burger instead of the Hog. We have no idea if they sent it to the wrong table... but expecting no less from a Ramsay restaurant, they had to fire a new one, which finally came when I was almost done with my burger and we had already finished the fries. Our waiter apologized and let us know that they were taking the burger off the bill. The manager then came over to also express his apologies and explained the situation. He also offered us a free drink since our waiter had not offered one during the wait, so we opted for the caramel pecan milkshake (highly recommend). Management handled the situation extremely well and we would definitely come back.

My only improvements would be a greeting once you get to the front of the line..and our server could've been friendlier... but that's it!

This was one of the best burgers I have ever had, I loved the spiciness of the roasted jalapenos and jalapeno aioli and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger itself was cooked medium well per my request, the meat was juicy, not overcooked and dry. There is a huge variety of burgers on the menu so if you are not a fan of spice, there are many other options. I also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries to share as a table.

Walking into Gordon Ramsay Burger, my expectations were very very high. Once you are seated you are greeted with a table setting that reminds you of the British Flag with and a simple menu on top with very minimalistic fonts with the name of the restaurant. The physical Menu it self even felt like there was a lot of thought, design elements and interaction put into it compared to a regular menu at majority of the restaurants. The drinks and dessert are on a separate tablet menu the server brings that seems a bit out of place and don't see the use for but I feel like its because of the limited space on their actual menu. 
  On to the food. I had the Anniversary Burger which also seems like the F-Word burger that wasn't on the menu. The patty is a blend of 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, Bone in ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. It seems like the design isn't very sophisticated and I like how simple yet flavorful it is. People might ask whats the point of all the best meat in a patty, you won't taste it.. but the truth is it made a whole lot of difference. you can actually taste the dry aged and the quality of meat in each bite. Parmesan Truffle fries are cooked to perfection with subtle yet enough seasoning and flavor of both Truffle and Parmesan in every bite of the Fries. It is hands down one of the best gourmet burgers I've had. 
  Service is a bit slow due to the place being so damn busy but it's understandable since the place was jam packed. The only gripe about this place is the waiting system. We had 5 people in our party and they were kind enough to take down our number and text us when our table was ready but for party of 2 or less, They said you have to physically wait in line. Though we didn't have to wait in line, this just didn't make any sense to me. If you already have a system of where you can take peoples name and phone number down, why can't you do that for everyone so they can go enjoy a little bit of Vegas instead of waiting in line next to a window full of flames? 
  Price is a bit high for a burger at $22 but I understand as it's hard to find anything to eat with less than $20 at a sit down restaurant in the stip of Las Vegas. 
  Regardless of the wait, and what other people may say, I personally enjoyed every bite of my burger and it was a extraordinary burger. it is definitely worth the try. c'mon it says Gordon Ramsay and how often do you have the opportunity to walk into a restaurant with his name in front.",Lklb_H4zLLtQvT1JP-zliQ,0,0,4,hpaPFwVDigFxRk5QjGOJ3A

Will the restaurant live up to expectations? Is it hyped up because of the name behind it? Are you paying a considerable amount more for something that isn't anything special? I mean this is only a burger joint!  Well, Gordon Ramsey Burger was everything I hoped it to be! 

I went in with my husband and a couple of friends on a Saturday around 11:45-noon. There are no reservations, it's first come first serve.  The line moves pretty quickly, it was about a 15-20 minute wait... and we were about the 5th party in line. Not bad! 

I love that the menu is fairly simple. There are enough options, but it's not overwhelming! Extensive menus are a bit of a nightmare for any indecisive person like me! Haha! 

We ordered beer battered onion rings to share as an appetizer. They came with two dipping sauces; chipotle ketchup and a cheddar ranch. The onion rings were cooked to perfection, flavored well and the cheddar ranch sauce was the perfect compliment to them! It was a great start to the meal! 

For my burger, I wnt with one of the more popular options; the Hell's Kitchen Burger. O-M-G! That thing was amazing! It was topped with asadero cheese, avocado, roasted jalapenos, and roasted tomatoes. The patty was so flavorful... it would taste good plain, that's how good it was! Seriously, there was a party in my mouth when I devoured this burger!!! It was tasty, memorable, and something I would crave! 

My husband got the hog burger and that thing was MASSIVE! It consisted of a patty made of pork and brisket, wrapped in bacon, topped with pulled pork, crispy onions, white cheddar, pickles, and slaw! What?! He LOVED it!

Our friends had the Crown burger and I think the backyard burger. They enjoyed theirs. We wanted to share a variety of fries, so we ordered the parmesan truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and the chips with curry sauce. The fries' portions are large and can be shared. Having 3 orders between the 4 of us was way toooo much. I would stick with the parmesan truffle or the sweet potato. 

We also wanted to indulge in a dessert and shake. I ordered the chocolate caramel tart which was chocolate cream served with hazelnut ice cream, hazelnut crunch, and milk chocolate! Sooooooooo delish!!! I would recommend it. Our friends shared the Oreo crème brulèe shake, they loved it. 

Ambiance is lively. Service is excellent! And the food is tasty/memorable! If you're a burger fan, check it out...quality meat in the burgers and very tasty!",pgLsGu_uUW2j0LUQETOwaw,2,1,5,LU7fdcagbYRdjdyMH78ogg

What I had: the Uber Cheese Burger. Why? Because I love cheese and apparently have no concern over clogged arteries. It was melty, and tangy and loaded with delicious cheesy goodness. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. It really needed nothing else and hit the spot. The perfect accompaniment was an order of their crispy Truffle Fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Because no burger is complete without exquisite fries, am I right?

Two of my friends and I came here for lunch in the midday during an educational conference located at the Cosmo. We were pleasantly surprised to find this place conveniently located across the street at Planet Hollywood with only a 15 minute wait for 3 people, despite the long line out the door!

We all ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which the server stated was the most popular. That makes perfect sense, as why not name your signature burger after one of your signature TV shows?

The burger was cooked medium, as requested. The meat was juicy, savory, flavorful, with the perfect texture (not too soft, tough, or crumbly). The sesame buns that had just the right amount of firmness, without any stale taste at all. The asadero cheese added a nice touch, and almost looked like a fried egg. Hands down the best burger I've ever tasted, and I've tasted quite a few in the world. I guess you can't go wrong with something created by a master chef like Gordon Ramsay. 

The three of us also shared an order of the truffle fries. Those were crispy, and delicious as well.. It was abundant enough for all three of us, with some left over. My appetite just wasn't at its baseline, otherwise I definitely would have finished the remainder of our fries.

Also, the place was splendidly decorated. Make sure to take a look at the blazing fire wall while you're in line and while dining in.",eXwGtbcI7kdgzZzBMMlf3g,3,3,5,mkSztYXH5YwatoqD6tzZGg

5717676,2017-11-20,1,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"My friends and I have decided to try out Gordon Ramsey Burger this weekend while we were in Vegas.

Host: 1 star

For anyone who is a first timer, parties of 3 or more do not need to wait in their line. You'll need to go to the host and tell them your name/number of people. They will ask for your number and send a text. Once when you get a text, you have 10 minutes to return back to the restaurant to get your table. 

Initially, we had a group of 7 present, which we need to wait about 35-40 minutes. We then had an additional 3 more people added to our group, a total of 10. I went up to the host, Kelly (asked our server specifically what was her name just in case if she gave me a fake name), to change the number of parties. She again asked for my number but  I never received an updated text. I reconfirm with another female host and she also said they will resend a text. Guess what? My request was never on the books. We ended up with 7 people in one table and the other 3 had their own table on the other side of the restaurant. This service is not acceptable. 


Food: 5 stars

Highly recommend: TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES

Burgers do not come with fries. We've ordered truffle French fries, ahi tuna sliders, hellfire chicken wings as appetizers. I've ordered a crown burger, super delicious! 

Server: 5 stars

We had great service from our server. She was very organized and friendly. Food came out quick.

Our server was great, super informative. We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, Blue Cheese Burger and Truffle Fries to share. Our waiter told us it'd be about 20-25 minutes for food. I did think that was a little awkward to tell us that, but I appreciated the honesty. We weren't in any rush. 

By about 30-35, our food came out. Looked amazing. Cut my burger in half a saw it was definitely well done (we had both ordered ours medium). Not a big deal but when Red Robin can get a burger done-ness right and not Gordon Ramsay, that's a bit of an issue. 

The burger was great except the patty. All of the flavors were there. Loved the kick of spice and my boyfriend loved everything about his Blue Cheese burger. Except the party. Not sure why we waited that long to have over cooked burgers. 

The truffle fries had the same issue. The flavors were amazing. But the fries tasted like they sat under the heat lamp waaay too long. And no surprise, if you looked over to the kitchen you saw rows of fries sitting under the lamp. 

The kitchen was clearly behind which surprised me at 6 on a Saturday, not what I would think would be the dinner rush. There were plenty of empty tables around us. 

Seemed like they were waiting for the kitchen to catch up because they stopped seating people for about 15 minutes. By then, the burgers seemed to come out a lot quicker. 


I really wanted to like this place, and had our burgers been not been cooked to death and our fries sat out, it would have been 5 stars.

The Truffle Parmesan Fries ($12) are pretty good. My favorite part is the dipping sauce - I'm pretty sure they make it from scratch (Fresh tomatoes and truffle oil, etc)

Hellfire Chicken Wings ($14) are amazing. Huge pieces, juicy, and an explosion of flavor! I definitely would choose this over their fries.

The Crown Burger ($15) is probably my personal favorite. It's extremely flavorful and the meat is spectacularly cooked - make sure you order no more than medium (I suggest getting medium-rare though).

The Hell's Kitchen Burger ($16) is alright. If you like spicy, this may be a good choice - but I personally don't think it tops the Crown burger in terms of flavor. Again, make sure you don't over medium for the meat!

The Lobster and Shrimp Burger ($26) is delicious. It's something worth trying once if you're a seafood lover. The proteins are cooked nicely. The only thing that makes this a turn-down is well.. The price.",ItF1lNKoPR72jGxrYH6ToA,2,0,5,NJYMIrAWOfrSdV-WbSgsdQ

We had one of the best restaurant experiences that we have ever had in Vegas! We loved it so much, we ate here for majority of our vacation. 

Just about everything you need to know:

Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino Resort. He has several restaurants in multiple hotels so don't get confused! When you arrive to Burger, you have to wait in a line to get in. We got lucky with the times that we went and didn't have to wait in line very long but it does get packed so be prepared to wait! The hostesses were so nice and friendly and made us feel so welcome. It was really cool that one of the hostesses remembered us and welcomed us back. 

The restaurant is a nice size and the atmosphere is really cool. They do not tolerate drunk and obnoxious guests which was really refreshing!

Service:
On both occasions that we went, we had TERRIFIC service! Both of our servers were very knowledgeable of the menu and checked up on us multiple times during our dinner. One employee who really stood out to us was the busser Caleb. Caleb was absolutely a joy to see on both of our trips to Burger. He was one of the kindest employees at a restaurant that we have ever encountered. He deserves a promotion, raise, or something. Just watching him take pride in his job and smile at every table was so refreshing. 

Food:
YUM!!! Over the course of 2 visits, I had the ""Hell's Kitchen Burger"", the ""Backyard Burger"", ""Beer Battered Onion Rings"", ""Kettle Chip Nachos"", and ""Truffle Parmesan Fries"". Everything was PHENOMENAL, except the Fries. They were not as great as I think they could have been but everything else made up for it. Make sure you request your burger to be cooked the way you like it. They normally make it ""Medium"" which is a bit too pink for me. 

Prices:
I think the prices are spot on. The price is definitely worth the food.

Overall,
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I highly recommend it and we will definitely be making it a tradition to come here at least once when we come to Vegas.

I hope this review helps you decide on where to get a delicious ""Burger"" when you come to Vegas!!!! :)",xb-oE_kX2GOL7Ge_rD1NSA,0,0,5,8jMaYiAYx9HaSncA8uA3IQ

It is pricy but very tasty...

I ordered Hell's  burger and Farmers burger with Putine  fries and Truffle fries...

The door opens at 11 am but already long line was formed...  I would say at least 30 people waiting in line..  Luckily I was 3rd person in line.  In the beginning dining area was empty but in minutes, whole place was filled up.

Hell's burger was very spicy... So if you can't handle hot spicy food, I don't recommend.

However, Farmers burger is good for every age.  Uncooked york of the egg makes burger more juicer and nicely blends with the patty.

Putine fries are nothing like the ones I ate in Canada..  It was totally different but visual, and taste is something you must try...",0XTNLVKxvFbYna7FiJtfHA,5,3,5,qGj_JFgvbXMTgO3s7yJP9A

Fries were ok, but a little dry, not made to order. Dipping sauces were the star there. The garlic aioli was fantastic. 
The tuna sliders were good, lacked the burst of flavor I think we were hoping and expecting it would have. Bangers and mash was pretty decent, the little potato balls were awesome, the roll the sausages were on were fresh and delicious. I can't complain overall, however - devils always in the details. 
That being said the curry dipping sauce I requested on the side had been sitting in the fridge and I had to stir it up a little to be able to dip anything in it. 
When you're paying $25-30 for a burger and fries..... I expect little things like that to be right.

If you're in a party of 4 or more, you can skip the line and go straight to the front to give them your name and number. They'll text you once your table's ready. When my party of 5 came on a Sunday, we checked in at 1:30pm and our table was ready at 2:15pm. By the time we sat down, our waitress - who seemed very unenthusiastic for having to work that day I might add - said the burgers would take half an hour to make. HALF AN HOUR! Our appetizers came out within 15min but our burgers actually didn't come out for another 45min. Imagine how hangry we were.

The Onion Rings and Truffle Fries are great to share with a group of people. The dips that each come with add a lot more flavor. They were both good but not great, I've definitely had better for less.

Forest Burger (mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon) - I loved the combination and it sure was tasty. I was intrigued when I saw the duck bacon but wasn't a fan when I actually tried it. There was no duck flavor and it tasted essentially like salty dried meat. Normal bacon would've made it better. However, the beef patty was delicious - probably the best I've had.

Farmhouse Burger (bacon, fried egg) - I personally liked the Forest Burger better but the 3 others I came with preferred this burger. They used normal bacon here which was a plus.

We also had the parmesan truffle fries which literally were french fries sprinkled with fresh parsley and shredded parmesan cheese. There was nothing truffle about it.  Since we were sitting right where the cooks work I literally saw the fries get fried, dumped in a cone, and then a waitress dashed some parsley on them and took a clump of cheese to throw on top and then they served it to us. Not sure what the sauces were as no one explained them and everyone was too busy to ask. Definitely not ketchup or mustard.

5978954,2017-11-14,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"This place is awesome. Here's my experience:
-The hostess was super friendly and sat me right away.
-My server (Ashley) was super friendly and did a great job checking in often, but not too often. Service definitely got this place the 5th star because she was a super star.
-The manager of the restaurant checked in once to see how everything was and was very friendly. Nice touch.
-The Onion Rings were really good. It's easy to take onion rings for granted because they are something that is just so simple and commonly served. You forget how good they can actually be sometimes.
- The french fries are good if you like A thick cut french fries. They were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Perfectly cooked. Seasoned well.
- The burger I ordered was rather plain as it just had meat cheese and bacon only. I wanted to see what the burger was like without tons of toppings on it. It was absolutely ridiculous on all levels. The meet was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing, the bacon was cooked perfectly, and the bun that they used that was toasted was absolutely perfect.

With fast and excellent service along with incredible food, I will definitely be coming back again.",pBlzGpvcrf6iRh9PgNhb0g,0,0,5,I4zvlxOozrX3xy3xA93wIw

No comments about burgers I make better at home. Even IN ND OUT it's better. Don't spend your money here.",Mna07ClgYddxHZD1O0hOow,0,0,1,huHCFaHOvZ6Taqmxuc7xdQ

5987694,2018-05-21,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,This was my first time visiting one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. The food was not good. I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger and it was greasy.  I ordered the burger medium well but it was undercooked. The Truffle Parmesan Fries tasted like death. The only reason why I gave it a two star is because the Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake was good.,B94Ok1iDFT5VadSxRVHUnA,0,0,2,rhSAD8j44o36gfyTuVswhw
5987946,2018-03-06,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,"We came here because all the buffets were closed. Didn't expect anything and chose it just because of Gordon Ramsay's name and we were blown away. The wait was a bit long but it was still dinner hours so definitely understandable. The service was fantastic; the waiters walked us the through the menu and made sure that everyone was heard (we were a pretty sizable party). At one point, someone in my group shattered their water glass and the situation was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Moving onto the food, I had one of the specials which was a burger boasting three different kinds of pig and it was honestly one of the best burgers I'd ever had. Definitely really hearty and I wasn't able to finish it but I'd come again for another attempt. If you're going to come though, you have to try their shakes; in particular the creme brulee shake is to die for. I've recommended Burger to many of my friends and will be making stops here whenever I go to Las Vegas.",QxFA2Lz0WPzDF_5ausPaLA,0,0,5,_OZtg8zf5IA35jQjWV1pvQ
5988034,2018-02-17,0,xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g,Just had the burger with the egg and bacon. So so good! Meat was cooked perfectly. Egg was done just right and the bacon brought it home. Can't say anything bad about it. I've always wanted to try a burger like this. Glad I tried it here. Wasn't disappointed. Overall place was very nice. Definitely busy. Our server was good but it did take him some time to get our stuff. For instance my husband ordered a coke and when it came for a refill it took forever for him to get it to us. We were already done with the meal when he brought it. Other then that I really enjoyed it. Will definitely come again.,V0WYxGfAPs3pfOfwiSfjgA,0,0,4,v_WZJwm7p4Gw314JmlNHoQ

There is usually a wait and you pay for fries separately. However, the presentation, atmosphere and taste is excellent.",k6GZnr_QVIKTWsO4LNeM9Q,0,0,5,w0NGO5nZhZyXWL7aV7RqFQ
