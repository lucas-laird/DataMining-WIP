They make it really crispy and juicy so you could taste the full flavor. They have a mini food cart every Wednesday to Saturday and it makes it more authentic. Inside, they have homemade ice cream with tons of flavors! Our favorite in the office is the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ice cream. It's a definitely must try.",VWxQyQo-nCx0oapaK-bAxQ,0,0,5,tzerkVNC4bJq1NG4CbQ-UQ

My favorite is their tripa tacos because they make it crispy. As for their desserts, they have a wide variety of ice cream, paletas, and sherbets. Their agua fresas are homemade and if you dine in, they will give you a refill. Their food is seasoned well from costillas, to the carne asada, to their homemade quesadillas. They have the friendliest employees that are eager to help you!",dia_CAtq1xe68HsP4gSQbQ,0,0,5,WrpV_Zp58WReWWo-6TCAWQ

When ordering my drink I was told by the cashier that she hadn't made the drinks yet. I was sad, it's 1pm and thought by this time an establishment should be ready to go. 

My meal started with chips salsa and beans, complimentary. Beans had a burnt taste and the salsa was very very water. The tortilla chips were stale. I was diappointed but still had hope I'd have a good meal. 

Had the asada sope and tacos 

The sope was a good size, topped with beans, asada, lettuce, sour cream and cheese. 

The lettuce was not fresh and turning brown and wilted. The radishes served on the side were transparent and soft to the bite. As if they had been sitting in water for days. The taco was tiny and lacked flavor. 

My conclusion, this place must not be very busy since things aren't very fresh on a Monday lunch hour. I would only return to try the deserts since it looks like that is their specialty.",IFLjYWaJPxI663SAkfOrdQ,0,0,1,TJ40uDZCjBRiWDHbNTIeYw
4353946,2015-08-13,0,J121PGT4oi5AqVbtMoEfVw,Food had no taste. I ordered the Asado Taco and as soon as I picked it up it fell apart. The hard shell taco is very thin. I took a bite and the meat had no taste. Poured some mild sauce to maybe bring out the flavor. Nothing. Poured the hot sauce. Nothing. No taste.,BL2bwHhZvfLmaEpjziThEw,1,0,2,dvX_hYDAtpbcvpy4oA5Kfg

Their aguas frescas are also very, very good. I tried their pupusas and they were just OK, not my favorite. I will definitely be back for some sweets though!",mJLRvqLOKhqEdkgt9iEaCQ,3,1,4,CqBSQq0EZKsBHp5Rer0Fog
5792610,2012-04-03,0,J121PGT4oi5AqVbtMoEfVw,Pupusas for $1.50.  $1 only if you order at least 6 of them.  Served with a mixed greens type of salsa.  Very delicious and the salsa/sauce really gives it some dimensions.  Great deal for pupusas.,17yeiTOfsnFUqPGWt165bA,0,0,3,N6xUMrxFZhzdOFcMjjblXg
