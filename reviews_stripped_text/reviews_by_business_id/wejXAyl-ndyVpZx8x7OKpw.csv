109669,2014-05-01,2,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"Wow talk about being disappointed. You look at this guys website and you think wow this has to be the greatest cheesesteak I ever tasted in my whole life . But then again in his website he said that all the best Philly cheese steak places in Philadelphia does not chop up their steak he is 100 % wrong. If anybody knows I do cause I worked at the original cheesesteak place in Philadelphia the 1st cheestake joint the place where the cheesestake was invented Pats... First thing he does wrong is he does not season his meat. And the reason why I know is because i was standing by the counter and i didn't see him season the meat  At Pats the way we cooked our steaks is first we took 6 ounces (that was weighted in advanced ) of rib eye put it on the gill that was already splatted with a little bit of oil season the meat with salt a pinch of black pepper and Paparika... Hanks  not have does not  give you any meat  At all I doubt if there was 4 ounces of meat on that sandwich and maybe one slice of American cheese. I don't mind paying $10 for a sandwich but give me something to eat I could've eaten 4 of those sandwiches and I still would've been full.. I could tell that the meat was very good it was fresh and the bread was pretty good ..But for gods sake let's stop being a cheapskate I know about food cost but come on you're charging almost $10 for a freakin sandwich.. Talk about being a stone face the guy never smiled his wife I'm assuming it's his wife had nothing to say..
 I don't think they were ever is business before or managed a philly cheesestake place like there web site stated.... Have you guys ever heard of truth in advertising !!!!!All in all I don't think I would ever come back here",T1F_QZDwRoth02ufRu2R3w,3,1,3,qOg6fLS9ZBoA6izlGcgfcQ

Ok not a deal breaker I can live without peppers but then I got the sandwich and I was even more disappointed.

My wife and I ate there and It came out to $32 for two full meals they charge an extra $1.00 for onions, $1.00 for bell peppers and $1.00 for mushrooms (even if you get the small). They have ""pizza fries"" that were frozen del taco style fries with nacho cheese and tasteless pizza sauce, what pizza has nacho cheese? Don't call that ""pizza fries"". The Philly cheese steak sandwiches were made with good sliced steak but lacked in flavor, very bland. I found myself adding extra salt and pepper. The folks working there were really nice which was the only good part about the experience. All in all this is not a place you want to go if you want to grab a quick affordable lunch you're looking spending at least $15 if you want fries and a drink.

I've been here in Vegas for 2 years now and haven't had one in forever ! It was good. Not awesome but good. I enjoyed it. This review is getting one star because of the owner who is quit possibly the rudest man I've ever met. I called to see if I could get them frozen so that I could send them to my aunt in Tennessee because they don't have them there. He said rudely that ""no we don't sell them frozen"". I've tried to explain that someone mentioned to me before that they have them frozen. He than yelled at me through the phone "" I OWN THE PLACE ! I DONT SELL THEM FROZEN."" When indeed the first time I was there he told me he gets the shipped to him frozen. Sooooo which is it sir ?? Don't be so rude. You will NEVER get my business again, and I will never recommend your restaurant to anyone. I've been working at restaurants my whole life and now own a business here in Vegas.

They use fresh and expensive meat the rolls are a lot better than great buns and amorosos. You can tell easily. It makes Pops on Decatur and what you get at the San gennaro feast taste like garbage. This is the real deal the owners are very cool from Philly and taught me what a real Philly is.dont waste your money at the canival ever again go to Hanks!,IAhOlCvSJVDyDkRqfOSScA,7,2,5,MG2NoB9cx4EyfM4vyVF_cQ

 We had their special, 12"" for $8.99. (Not sure if this special is everyday.) Great price. Bread was fresh and had a great crust. Meat was amazing. And again, the WIZ. Even our kids loved it!

They already have a strong following from folks from Philly so it must be legit. I've never been to Philly, but I know what I like and these are great sandwiches. 

The menu is simple which is my preference. Do a few things and do them well. In Hanks' case its five sandwiches and fries. At another Philly joint I like the provolone better than the cheez whiz, but here the Philly Joe with 1/2 Cheese Whiz and 1/2 melted American is better ($6.99). The provolone with grilled onions was a bit dry. That Philly Joe is top notch. All sandwiches come on a 9"" bun. If I were nitpicking, I'd like a smaller bun stuffed with the same portion of toppings.

We had cheese fries too ($2.99) they're crinkle cut and topped with Cheez Whiz they reminded me of steak fries. Light and fluffy. 

We'll definitely be back. You can call in take out orders too.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,15,3,4,uNzxa6_EgdwWX_TL1DsJ0w

The sandwich was bland, there was no salt, the mushrooms were clearly from frozen and not cooked long enough. The meat count was skimpy as well. 

This place claims to have been on the Food Network, but less than 6 months ago it was a catfish restaurant.

1098557,2015-03-19,0,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"Unfortunately, I couldn't even eat here. From the moment I started ordering, the male owner kept telling me ""we don't have it""... literally to the point where I had to ask him ""how do you stay in business if you don't have anything on your own menu""....

I TRIED to order a Cheese Whiz Philly... right off the bat he tells me ""we don't have Cheese Wiz"".... so he tries to revert me to ordering a philly with Provolone... now I hate to be a stickler here... but the MAIN REASON I even wanted to try this place was because it was the 2nd place that would give you a Philly cheese steak with Cheese Wiz... the only other one (that I know of) besides Pop's (on Decatur and Charleston). So, NOT having cheese wiz THAT DAY... the FIRST DAY I ever came to this place... was DEVESTATING for me. 

So, I half-heartedly TRIED to order a Philly with provolone cheese. AS ALWAYS, I TRIED to order mushrooms on it. AGAIN, he says ""we don't have mushrooms"".... again... devestated.

Then I try to order a drink. AGAIN... the ONLY drink he has is can of Coca-Cola behind me in this crummy little fridge.

Despite being denied what I came for 3 times... I ordered... but here's what got me... so much to the point where I had to just leave out of sheer frustration... when I went to pay he said ""CASH ONLY.... R U F'n KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!!?

I left IMMEDIATELY!

The place was so crummy looking too. By far, one of the worst looking places in Vegas as far as 'decor' goes. The owners could care less about their customers. While I was ordering, this guy's wife comes in... slams a stack of mail in front of me and starts talking to him... interrupting me ordering. And she was cursing like a sailor too and I had my 9-year-old daughter with me standing right on front of them.

To make matters worse... and just to show you how lazy they are... and how much they don't care about their establishment or their customers... THEY ARE LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO A GROCERY STORE (Fresh and Easy)... They could have went over there and bought some mushrooms and (perhaps) some Cheese Wiz AT ANY TIME... and yet they didn't have the foresight to do that.

FIRST AND LAST TIME I'm ever coming here. I'm sticking to Pop's! I've NEVER been told ""we don't have it"" at Pop's",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,3,1,1,kVnhVSztdBS0cs-0AQdM-w

Decent Cheesesteak sandwich, 6/10

Cons:
The sandwich could have used more steak on it
I ordered mine with onions, and they were pretty scarce.  You might want to order extra onions to get some.
Almost $10 for a 9 inch sandwich is way too expensive

This place is like a little hole in the wall. This was my second time dining here this time that I went i bought one of those discount cards from my daughters school's football team. We ordered 2 philly steaks with mushroom and onions and fried and drinks. I love they way they do their philly's they cook thinly sliced steak they don't chop it and you can get more than one cheese on it but i choose cheese wiz. They didn't add the fries on when we ordered and when my husband went to ask for cheese on the fries they added it and just charged for the cheese sauce which i thought was nice. so my cons for this place is the price my deal was for buy one get on 50% off and we still spent 28.00, We paid 2.00 total to add mushrooms to both sandwiches and they were canned mushrooms which to me takes away from the quality of the sandwich. They only have canned soda because their fountain machine is broken so you have to pay a dollar a can which if you drink a lot when you eat it adds up.

1538081,2015-01-24,0,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"Let's start with the fact I just saw this place on the food network. I literally drove all the way down there just to eat here and was very excited about it. Well  as i walked in there was a guy at the counter talking with some guy behind the counter and this was the only person working that I saw. I waited patiently to order thinking that he was doing the same, well this was not the case.......... After about five minutes the guy behind the counter says do you want to order? Really!!!!!!No I'm just standing here reading the menu on the wall. The guy that was talking to him says oh my bad and moves off to the side. The guy behind the counter says well, what are you having? I tell him i want the chopped Philly cheese steak, his reply was we are out so pick something else. Ok i tell him i want the rib eye Philly cheese. He says you want cheese, yup what kind, as I was about to say provolone he says wisely you want gouda cheese? I say ok whatever he says well we don'y have that ha ha...... WTH really this wise guy is making jokes now so he says well we have provolone or wiz will that do? I guess it will. 


Lets move on to the fact that besides me and my friend and the guy who was talking at the counter there was no one else in the place. I take a seat and wait for my order. In walks about six other couples now from the back of the grill area appears  a lady and she and him start to take all the orders from all six couples and then the guy says to the lady lets start cooking? Fail big time, why not start cooking the first order and have the other lady take the orders? Not sure what this was about but whatever.....


Its now been twenty minutes and still no food, the couple who walked in after i had order had placed a to go order and he was bagging up their food and they were walking out........ ummm did I miss something where was my order! The other couple that was sitting next to us looked at me like didn't you order first?


Then he again produces another order bagged up to go and calls me over and says to Philly to go? I said well it was for here but whatever I just want my food because I'm hungry. I open the bag and look through the food and realize that this is not my order. I take it back to the counter and tell him and he says wait this is the other guys order not yours....... Then why did you give this to me? he says oh well I got mixed up! Really its not even that busy and you can't get the orders straight. 

By now I can tell you that I am pissed off. This is another order that went out before mine...... Again all I had ordered was the two Cheese steaks and a cheese fries. So after 25 long minutes I get my order with no apologies just here you go, like nothing was wrong.


First off don't order fries for $4.00 this is what you give me a small thing of fries that I could have made at home....(The total for my order was $32 and change) The .99 fries at mcdonalds is bigger and better........ The cheese steak was decent but not as great as the food network claimed and not I repeat not worth all the hassle this place has to offer. They need to get their act together less time talking with people who are not even ordering and focus more on the people who  are trying to get food.... 



The general mood of the customers in the place was not pleasant as people had long wait times for their food and wrong orders going out.


By the way the mens bathroom was a mess, toilet was dirty and running water from the toilet was all over the ground. The trash can was filled to the brim with trash and the sink was unusable. The best way to describe the sink was it looked like someone mistook this for the toilet.


I was would normally have brought this to the attention of the owners, but whats the point the are too busy talking to care about the food and the customers in front of the restaurant  why would the back of the house be any different....



The bottom line is this stay away from this place, its really sad that the were on the food network and this is what they produce!!!!!!!",n_Vzepb6aEwmPDtz-ISshA,11,0,1,FH1VNHlfbthK7C2k7EmhuA

Hank's is a simple place, in the true tradition of Philly cheese steak places. The menu--well, you're choice of cheese steak sandwiches, of course! You can get fries, but this place focuses on doing one thing well, and they hit a home run!

You can get a traditional, Philly style sandwich with Cheez Whiz. Look out Pat and Geno, you've got competition out west! My preference is for provolone, but it is so nice to have regional food that is truly authentic!

Well I went there on a Wed 12:30 and they were closed.  Disappointed, I figured I will try again next time I had to do some banking.  A week later, I came back and was ecstatic to see them open.  
I went in to inquire about the famous Panzrotti, and they said they were out, and they would not have any till next week.  HUH???  I then asked them which Chef on the Food Network show claimed it was the ""Best Thing They Ever Ate"" and she replied she did not know.  Hey lady, for your info, it was Aaron McCargo, who won Season 4 of The Next Food Network Star.
She was very cold, unfriendly and non accommodating and I felt like I was bothering her.  She then said the dish is FROZEN, and it was being shipped from back East, so they would not have any till next week, even though the delivery was suppose to arrive later that day (It was Thursday)  HUH again???

Normally i like to add some spicier options to my cheese steak, but the options here were limited.  I do not like onions, or mushrooms, so I was left to just get a fairly plain cheese steak.  I wish they had some sort of hot peppers, but if they do it was not clearly advertised anywhere.  The bread was fantastic, seemed like it was homemade.  For cheese they have options of cheese whiz, provolone, or American.  I ordered provolone.  The cheese was ok.  The dissapointing part was the meat.  They used sliced beef instead of chopped.  I am not against either option.  The issue was that the meat severely lacked in flavor.  It seemed like there were absolutely no spices or anything to this meat.  The meat needs to have flavor otherwise what is the point.  I would much rather have a cheese steak from Capriotis sandwich shop or several other places that I have ordered from in the past.  I was excited to try this place, but sadly I can in no way give a 4 star, in fact this was a toss up between 2-3.  I love it when family owned (mom and pop) types of places open up, they are usually very good, but this is not one of the great ones from my experience.  Also, the price was around $9 for a regular cheese steak.  I would have expected my sandwich to be a bit fuller for that price.  I know without the extra toppings the size is smaller automatically, but it was still slightly undersized for the price I paid.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,1,1,3,Xmjhubb2dhhh--PkBFmyqg

This little spot is located in a strip mall. It's small and sparse, but has a nice homey feel. When I was here, there was no one else in the place.

I placed my order and opted for taking it to go. And everything was made fresh. The prices were ok. It can definitely add up, but it's nothing out of line with other area prices.

When I got home, I realized they gave me just regular fries, not the cheese fries I had ordered. And I'm not sure I got the right sandwich order. It sure didn't seem like there was any whiz in there. 

And the sandwich just didn't taste that good to me. I had high hopes. When I lived on the East Coast, I would literally drive to Philly just to have a steak sandwich. But this sandwich left me longing and failed to satisfy my craving. It wasn't inedible or anything. But I also picked it apart and ate little of it.

So all in all, this was a disappointing meal. However, I didn't try what they were featured on TV for. So perhaps I'll stop in again and try a different menu item.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,4,2,UIl8in7rxskUXxV9Z-nCiw

Be sure to get the american cheese on your philly! Super delicious. 

The cheese fries are pretty good too. I did the cheese wiz on mine, but you can do any of their cheese.

2509117,2013-12-20,6,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"Can't say that I'm a Philly Cheesesteak aficionado, but after reading so many positive reviews and driving by this place relatively often I had to give it a shot. I think it was a combination of it being a super cold night and that the food was just that good, but I really, really enjoyed my sandwich from Hank's.

I had a chance to chat with both Hank and his wife and they were very excited to know that their positive Yelp reviews led me to trying them out. I figured if I was going to try this place, I better go with the signature sandwich, a philly cheesesteak with cheeze-wiz, grilled onions, and mayo. I know mayo isn't everyone's cup o' tea on this sammich, but it works for me, so there! I loved it. The meat was tender and had great flavor. The cheeze-wiz, which I had never had on a sandwich, made it really moist and had so much cheese flavor in every bite. I ordered the onions well done, and they were perfect, sweet. The bread was absolutely stellar.

The ambiance is lacking a bit. I probably wouldn't plan to eat there, I'd just take it home. It was Monday night and some made for TV type movie was playing on their nice flat screen TV, not Monday Night Football which was kind of weird. It's pretty bare in there and could use some sprucing up. Not dirty or trashy at all, just kind of blah-zay.

We need more small business owners/foodies like this. I definitely recommend giving Hank's a try! Their sammiches are off the heezy.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,19,11,5,P-lKKjGPBGBQPI7F6hn3EQ

The steaks and rolls are exactly what you would get in Philadelphia. In fact, they are better than most of the steak places i have eaten at in philly. Their prices are completely reasonable considering they probably have to import their products from the east coast because I have never seen quality italian rolls and meets on the West coast, but Hank's has them. To me, what makes it even better than  Philly is not just the food, but how you are treated by the staff. For those people who have never eaten a philly Cheasesteak in Philadelphia you may not know that if you dont know what you want, they will send you to the back of a very long line and they are usually rude.

On the business listing it says they open at 11 am. Well imagine my dismay when I showed up at 11 only to say a couple of curse words and leave hungry to look for another place to hit up for lunch. Sucks when you have your mind made up for a cheese steak. Fyi I ended up going to Full House Barbeque (A Filipino restaurant) just down the street.

So this next time I show up exactly at 12 to check this bookmark off.

I get the foot long Cheese Steak ($8.99) with the Cheese Whiz/Provolone mix along with grilled onions standard. You can add Bell Peppers ($1.25), Mushrooms ($1.00), Pepperoni ($1.00), Extra Meat ($3.50),and Hot Cherry Peppers (50 cents).

The sandwich was ok but if you wanted to add everything that I mentioned, you would be looking at a sandwich that is over 16 dollars! Even if you didn't get the extra meat you're still looking at about 14 bucks. SAY WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?!

Service was great. The overall ambience of the place was just ok with several tables and chairs. There are Philly paraphernalia on the walls.

Overall, I thought it was just an ok experience. Nothing really impressed me but at the same time nothing really disappointed either.

OK, the owners here are great.  Uber friendly and they obviously have passion for what they do.  I've always said that whatever you do, do it well.  We talked for 10 minutes about what makes their sandwich so good.

Get a cheese steak (obviously) and top it how you like.  Personally that means peppers and mushrooms but no onion.  I opted for provolone though if you want to get dirty I hear the cheese wiz is a killer choice.  No chopped steak here, no, nestled in the bun is a steak grilled to perfection.  OK, I can't take it.

3213334,2015-02-01,6,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"The son was simply giddy over this place. He had hit up Hank's twice when in Vegas.  And knowing my prolific Yelp prowess, he felt empowered to drag me down there to show me he can be a good Yelper, too. 

The burning question:   Does this Mom (me) with fingers permanently attached to the keyboard from obsessing over 1400+ reviews, think as highly of this place as does her occasional user son (with a mere 1 review, and it's not even for this place)?  Not a proud moment for him, but I have to say at least he is using Yelp to find places and check in.

So in we went.

The thing is, it was Tuesday lunch time and it was empty.  And, as described by others, the not-so-enticing smell of the hookah place next door, which btw was not even open until evening hours, permeated the small dining area.

It was disconcerting when we got the feigned shock, then conjured evil eye from the lady/owner behind the counter when we dared to ask if there was any way we could keep the door open.  Obviously not, as she in no uncertain terms glared and replied it would violate code.  Ok, just asking....bad first impression.  At least the guy/owner was a more friendly sort, and he was the person who took our order and check on us.

So the sandwiches arrived.  We had all gotten Philly cheese steaks.  And to my surprise, their proudly proclaimed ""Authentic Kraft Cheese Whiz"" and melted ""White American Cheese"" on top were just fine.  I had anticipated (being the cheese snob I admittedly am) that I would dislike this processed cheese.  But it was fine.  And the thinly sliced, not chopped, rib eye steak and grilled onion made a delicious, moist sandwich.  

So maybe the son has his mother's good taste after all.  Cluck, cluck, cluck.

Would I return?  Possibly.  It was good food, what we had.

Would I sit down and eat there? No. 

Can I overlook the incredulous, unfriendly Philly (?) attitude?  Eh, I just let 'er slide.",W3Z5K5Ks4PJHo_RFexaqdA,12,6,4,AQkyJENKh88XyI9IHM4OFg

Sadly, like many things on the Internet, it was all a lie. I will probably give them one more chance and update this review but for now its barely a 2 star.

I went a bit later in the day in order to avoid any lunch rush and perhaps that was my mistake because they were out of a lot of things like Provolone Cheese, Peppers, Onion Rings, etc... So, I went with a cheese steak with onions and mushrooms and of course the cheese wiz. I wanted provolone and peppers as well but no such luck.

The first thing I noticed was the price. Sandwich, sweet potato fries, and a can of soda was just under $17.00. Thats a bit much especially when you see how little meat you get in the sandwich, it was mostly bun and wiz. The onions and mushrooms were both basically raw, I expected them somewhat caramelized.

3896710,2014-12-08,0,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"One star for a pretty decent sandwich.  Unfortunately the sandwich was the only acceptable part of this visit. 

We stopped in because they had a banner saying they were featured on Food Network. The bait worked on us, and we were hungry and just wanted to get to out hotel ASAP. How long could it take to get just ONE philly steak sandwich?! 

We walk in to an incredibly tacky looking place, but what REALLY hit us was the smell. Not their fault, but they're sharing a wall with a hookah lounge and holy crap, this place stank SO BAD. Sweet, fruity tobacco hung in the air and we could barely breathe. We almost left before ordering because of the smell but we decided to order anyway.

There was an older couple working. The lady took our order and was friendly enough but they were out of bell peppers (um, so go buy some?!) and she literally wrote our order down on this piece of scrap paper (an old receipt?) and laid it next to the grill for the cook. Hmmm, we were beginning to wonder...

We ordered one Philly sandwich which is pretty much the only thing they have on the menu. We also got a bottle of water and our total was $13.something. Seems a bit steep but we had high hopes.

The order of ONE sandwich took over 20 minutes. The grill was clearly not hot because the food sat on it for ages while the cook worked at a snails pace to assemble ours and the people's who ordered 10 min after us. 

Nothing on the grill sizzled and when we FINALLY got our sandwich nothing was caramelized or browned. Just gray. The cheese was laid in the bun and not melted on top on the grill. Weak. It tasted decent but was nowhere near worth the price or the wait!

The bathroom smelled of hookah and raw sewage and we were gagging at the smell of this place by the end of the meal.

Good luck staying open if it takes you 20 minutes to make one sandwich, the only thing on your menu. Stay away from this dump.",jnUECQSItgACyvhyzHXvXw,3,1,1,WBUwROXl-bZ-Q8IIghHAUQ

I had narrowed it down to three places, but there was something about the reviews that pulled me to Hank's.  I was rewarded for trusting my instincts.  The couple that owns and runs the place is charming and delightful, with thick Philadelphia accents.  

I ordered the Philly Joe (1/2 cheese whiz and 1/2 melted american with grilled onions) based on the couple's recommendation.  It took a while to make, but it was worth the wait.  First off, I don't like 'american' cheese, but this wasn't anything like kraft singles.  The sandwich was glorious.  Have you ever had something so delicious that you regret eating it quickly?  It was out of this world.  

The meat is high end ribeye, so you're not going to get a huge amount of steak if that's what you expect, but the taste is phenomenal.  The bread may have been the most amazing thing: the perfect firmness and it really makes the sandwich memorable.  It is a little messy to eat, but I wasn't even self-conscious about licking the wax paper.

I've never been to Philly, but I've had cheesesteak sandwiches from over a hundred places all over the country, from Subway to gastropubs and everything in between.  This is hands down the best Philly cheesesteak I've had in my life.  To really be impartial, I should go to other places in Vegas and try their versions.

4474320,2014-03-27,1,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"Unfortunately disappointed.

Had a great expectations since several of our friends from back East recommended us on numerous occasions.

We ordered:

1 large Philly cheesesteak at $8.99
2 fries at $2.50 each
2 regular can sodas at $1 each
1 side of wiz at $0.50

The large Philly was smaller than a small at Capriottis. The Philly meat seemed to be sliced and placed on a griddle, no seasoning. Maybe overcooked or just steamed through, but had no flavor. The wiz seemed to be a mix of 1/2 wiz and half American, which they offer, but we ordered wiz. The fries were definitely frozen Oreida and served way too hot. 

Prices are ridiculous, definitely feel as though we were nickel and dimed. Money is not a concern when the quality is there...but for 1 sandwich, 2 fries, 2 sodas and a side of cheese for $17, almost $18 with tax...??? Honestly you can definitely tell you are paying for the rent and not the food...if that makes any sense.

Possibly an off night for the mom and pop owners, who are very friendly...but the food was not notably worthy as the previous reviews suggest.",J3OIm59Uhfmd0pVVNDd2IA,4,1,2,d4j6xhlbM60C3CSL9vQDeg

Location:  Silverado Ranch strip mall. Selection:  cheesesteaks and hoagies. Price:  reasonable.  A large Philly Joe with cherry peppers and a soda was twelve bucks and change.
Food:  Good eats.  The sub roll was super dense and chewy but not doughy.  The sliced ribeye steak was tender and flavorful without any gristle.  Plenty of cheese and onions.  The bread could of handled more meat though.  
Overall, 4 stars.  I'd get it to go next time as the atmosphere is lacking.",67zOuDms6nAJDFXdOaJpyA,2,0,4,Dw_HZxbQeQ6lnUY0EydU_A

  The place itself is drab looking and leaves something to be desired. We ordered our food with high expectations of service and quality, but neither were there. The prices were high & the soda fountain was broken so we had an option of canned regular coke or diet, nothing else. It took us just under an HOUR to get two Philly cheesesteaks, two orders of fries (regular and sweet potato), and the macaroni bites. 
   When the food finally arrived one barely had any meat on it (steak, provolone with onions) and the meat to onion ratio was ridiculous. The second (steak, cheese whiz and onions) was overflowing with the cheese (which I'm all for) was okay, nothing spectacular or to rave about. The sweet potato fries were okay at best and I was not a fan of the pre-brought/pre-made/pre-frozen macaroni bites that were very, very under seasoned. 
  At one point one of my co-workers got up and walked to the counter and asked the woman behind the counter if she could have a receipt for her meal (the woman had failed to give it to her and we needed the receipts for work) She immediately got snippy & rude and yelled at my co-worker saying she didn't ask for one! My co-worker replied by telling her it was for work, and she needed it. At that point the man who was cooking (assuming it was the owner) came over and told the woman to just make her a new one.
  Not coming back here again, and will be telling others to stay away! Why wait almost an hour for a sandwich and then have rude service for asking a question? Stay away!!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,0,0,1,PzAXNUc_1aTSUFPD-g4tqg

But now, you struggle just to get one. They take forever, the prices are higher, and the attitude is a bit rude at times, even for Philly standards. Worst of all, the steaks aren't consistently good anymore. The latest thing, they no longer take phone orders?!?!? What? Really? 

 It's a shame. If they were quicker with getting the food out, maybe this would work. But they aren't, and it won't. The lack of convenience will decrease the visits I make to this place.

5390864,2013-07-26,8,wejXAyl-ndyVpZx8x7OKpw,"So in the last few months I haven't written many reviews due to a horrible case of writer's block.   It was going to take something of amazing to break me out of this spell.  It was going to take.....  the best Philly Cheesesteak I've had in Vegas.

A little background:   My dad is from Philly and as such I've grown up with cheesesteaks my entire life.  I've been back east with him a few times and each and every time I have a cheesesteak or two and formulate mental comparisons.   My favorites that I've had there are Jim's and Steve's (side note:  how come 95% of cheesesteak places are opened by people with the most common one syllable names in the US?)   When I read about Hank's opening up, and right by my house nonetheless, I'll be honest I was a little wary.   While I'm not picky in the least bit and can eat anything from a homemade cheesesteak using steak-umms and american cheese to capriotti's version to stake out's etc etc and be happy, I also realize that it's incredibly difficult to replicate geographic favorites all the way across the country.  I tried to keep expectations low knowing that there was a good chance this would be ""just another cheesesteak"" 

After chatting with the owners for a few minutes, my hope started to rise.  Hank (is it safe to presume his name was Hank?  I forgot what he told me) was telling me about the kind of meat, the differences in meats between various places back East, and basically was a walking encyclopedia of cheesesteak knowledge.  If this guy isn't updating the wikipedia entry on cheesesteaks, he should be.  Then the golden words:  he told me that his cheesesteak was most closely going to resemble Steve's from Philly.  SOLD.  

I ordered a Philly Joe based on recommendations here, and I also ordered cheese fries and some hot cherry peppers on the side because I'm a glutton for lactose intolerance and hot fiery things in my belly induced punishment.  It was definitely worth it.   For $6.95 you get 9 inches of the best quality steak I've had on a cheesesteak out here.   Whatever it's costing him to fly this meat out to Vegas, it's worth every penny.  The cheese got all gooey and messy and it helped that I devoured the whole thing in about the same amount of time it would take most people to finish unwrapping it.  This was the closest I've come in Vegas to the taste of the cheesesteaks I've had in Philly.

The cheese fries were good, and I easily finished off the order, but they wouldn't be something I would order regularly since I try not to eat like a complete degenerate every time I go out.  The cheesesteak though might be too good to resist.

5 stars for officially setting the bar for me on a Vegas Cheesesteak.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,15,9,5,lkSRro-3UZ3hQiggwYYw3g

Hidden behind Jack in the Box...I was actually on my way there to get a Sourdough Jack before driving down to San Diego...boy am I glad the fiance mentioned trying this place! These philly steaks come on bread shipped from Philadelphia! The bread is soft and buttery inside with a perfectly toasted exterior.  The flavor and texture of the cheese steak keeps you going in for another bite even after you are stuffed.  I got the Herman special which comes with steak, provolone, mayo, grilled onions. The mayonnaise and provolone blended perfectly together. The texture of the steak was buttery smooth...I mean I'm finding a hard time  describing with words how delicious these philly steaks are...the cheese blends seem to have the perfect combination of seasoning!  The fiance got the Philly Joe (fittingly since his name is Joe)...steak,half cheese whiz, half American cheese with grilled onions.  He loves philly steaks and has probably tried all the ones in town and he says by far these are superior!  Apparently, the Philly Joe is the fan favorite, since the owner told me I'd be jealous of his order.  Honestly, how can you go wrong with cheese whiz?!

I have been craving a real Philly style cheese steak with grilled onions and cheese whiz. Thank God for Hank's!!!

This joint is hidden in the back of a small little strip mall complex. I won't lie, as an avid Yelper  I was very nervous after reading the reviews. Odd hours that don't coincide with the actual posted hours and a rude owner? My response to this is, if you are kind and don't enter an establishment acting like an entitled scum bag chances are you will be treated with respect. My boyfriend and I had a delicious lunch and the icing on the cake with the real sugar Coca Cola in a glass bottle. The owner and his wife were friendly and chatty and we talked about Philly and food during our whole meal.
