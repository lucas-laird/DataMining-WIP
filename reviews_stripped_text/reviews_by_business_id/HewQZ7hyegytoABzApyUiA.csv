Unbeknownst to me, they told me they stopped selling individual chicken legs...really?! A chicken fast food restaurant that doesn't sell a leg for a kid? Ok...so I went to the one one warm springs and guess who sells individual chicken legs...this location was always mediocre but after that I'm just not going here anymore",MYWI6QqFTvhLozpGeiD2xQ,0,0,1,99K4EctvP4UQkaqluSgqFw

Get up there the woman at the window tells me how much it is I give her the money I say thank you she hands me my food not a word no you're welcome, no  thank you come again, no we're sorry we're out of drinks. Not a word other than what was owed, then basically just closed the window in my face. What crappy service. I won't be coming here again.",9K0fZeOG8onVzG5JZRwQkA,0,0,1,mf3yKMODlHfoqrfdV65jmw
1929949,2017-02-18,0,HewQZ7hyegytoABzApyUiA,"Well we were super excited to have a El Pollo Loco on the way home. Stopped on the way home today. Ordered an 8pc family meal through the drive thru. At the payment window we paid and the girl just handed us the bag. We were asked if we wanted salsa, had to ask! She seemed bothered that we asked for it. Understand it's the end of their day an hour before close but really?  Low and behold we get home and there is no plates, silverware or even napkins!!!!!! 

Again, it a freaking family meal!
Adding to this- the mac and cheese was hard!",zO91Ks4vyrhIpjvUJu0KnQ,1,0,1,NFOqEnazawK0qBBpvs99oA
2215133,2017-06-19,0,HewQZ7hyegytoABzApyUiA,I ordered our meals online because I that I would get the right stuff.  I ordered 3 combo meals.  My husband came out without the drinks.  Back in he went.  Came out with 3 drinks that were the same size.  I ordered 2 large drinks and one regular size.    This clearly shows who ever put the order together didn't read my explicit instructions.   Growing up things had to be prefect.  Anything less was not ok.  Tired of paying for and not getting what I paid for.,nWTMQnYVSmFNZpTaZDDgTw,0,0,2,9HabxNiJkcIC_51Ub7BY6g

My double chicken tostada arrived quickly, with chopped chicken from the grill, slices of avocado, lettuce, mild salsa, sour cream, hot beans and rice. The tostada was flaky and good for breaking off to use like chips.

I received a free $10 voucher for a meal by signing up to be a part of their pre-opening practice event, which was open to the public.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,1,1,5,x6pa_f8Uonnk0JK1fSIdSw

I even had a coupon ($20 for a 12 piece family meal), which was awesome. Just like it has been mentioned in the tips, don't forget to get the creamy cilantro sauce! It is so delicious!!! Food met my El Pollo expectations! I recommend this location.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,0,0,4,sO5Bpgvr-dj9DDOcMn0xBA

Lady was cocky and rude when taking our order. Then the food was cold and wrong. Mac and cheese was old and smached like mash patatos. Spoke to a manager and she gave us too free dinners to come back. 
We are here again and the service was great but the food was raw. Wtf!! We can get a break. Make sure you check your chicken!!",X0Um-q8rky3qK6cxul6tQg,0,0,1,btxYkujamzPJdy_3hGuV7w

It was just a hassle to complete my order...when you order a taquito and the worker doesn't know what it is to give you a simple yes or no its no longer on the menu well than... ignorance becomes time consuming to explain to the worker what exactly a taquito is... who doesn't know??? Well apparently it's on the catering menu thank goodness so you'd figure someone would have a clue, then for micheal to also be rude well kids will be kids... sticking to the rainbow location at least I know I'll get my order right and better customer service... but overall the food was great at the location.

I love that this is right next to where I work! I can go to dinner as soon as I get off....it's great! The staff here is so sweet and friendly! Luis has exceptional service. Chicken as well as the sides are very tasty and satisfying. I had the chicken tenders meal with mac n cheese and cole slaw....very good!

4645678,2017-03-12,0,HewQZ7hyegytoABzApyUiA,"If I could give this a zero star rating, I would. I've been here three times now ever since they've opened and each time gets worse and worse. 
Each time that I have been there, I've had to wait more than 10 minutes before someone finally comes and takes my order. Mind you, this place every time I've gone, is never busy and I'm always the only one waiting in line. 
Sometimes in the middle of the order they'll just turn around and start talking to the cook. So basically what I'm trying to say is, they have the absolute WORST customer service.
Not to mention the many times they've given us overcooked chicken that's been sitting out for so long. It's overcooked and it's not hot - it's pretty much just chicken jerky at this point. Each time I've called about it, they'd tell me that it had just gotten off the grill and is freshly hot. I've been to plenty other El Pollo locations and I know when the chicken is freshly cooked. When I bring the chicken back to show them, they just say, ""oh...yeah that's overcooked."" No shit that its overcooked! 
Three times now. I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but never again will I go back there.",BsOHtPtVWsPj3cfJJJShtA,0,0,1,v56adUQwNHq4GArPEsldDg

This is now the second time we've been to this location and both times they didn't have the tortilla soup we wanted. Her response was ""we stopped serving it tonight"" so when we got up to the window we asked what time they stop serving it and rudely she replies ""when we run out"" and shut the window.

I'm a regular guest at this location and time after time I have given them chances to get it together and make it right. With no exaggeration they have almost every time missed something on my order soda, churros, salsas, tortillas etc and keep in mind these are all different times I've visited this location. Today was the cherry on top! I asked the female who took my order a question about a taco and she rudely responses to me and I asked her to repeat her self and she did in the same tone. I responded that's all I wanted and drove to the window. Once I'm at the window she doesn't greet me, takes my card and gives me no receipt and to top it off she doesn't gives me or even asks me if I wanted salsas! I believe in second chances but after several countless times of screw ups I've had it. If you guys are in the business of losing money and losing clients then your in the right one for sure!
