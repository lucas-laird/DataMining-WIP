57602,2014-12-09,1,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"The ambiance in this hookah bar is great, there are a couple private rooms, and there's a great outdoor seating area, which is where we chose to sit. The planes going in and out of LAS can be a bit noisy, but its not too terrible.

The food and drinks were all amazing. Lots of Greek and Israeli fare. Fresh squeezed juice really elevates the cocktails ($12/each, but worth the price).

Unfortunately, I can only give this bar 3 stars because the service. At least to the outside patio, the service was practically non-existent despite the establishment having less than 10 patrons the entire time. We waited 20-30 minutes for someone to check on our drinks (we were ready for a second round), but we had to get up ourselves and go inside to order them. We ordered the hummus(amazing), which after not coming out after 30 minutes, we again went inside to ask about and the order had not made it to the kitchen, again despite the low volume of business.

The exception to this rule was the ""coal fairy"" or whatever you call the guy going around refreshing the coals.  He had excellent timing, showing up consistently when we needed new coals.

Overall, this bar is worth checking out and is only a 30 minute well-lit walk from Bally's. Maybe pick a seat inside, though, so you can call a waitress over when you need one",Hg6KEff_DURRXuoDfzn-vQ,2,1,3,r_B096nwsaBGMXY-dFJPBg

I own a Shisha lounge in London myself but I have never ever ever pulled a hookah so smooth before in my entire life; the smoke was incredibly thick with amazing flavours.

739710,2013-08-06,2,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"Please note I am middle eastern and my expectations of hookah and a hookah lounge are probably very different than a non middle eastern hookah lover.

as soon as we walked in we were greeted very nicely. the staff was very polite...no complaints there... my start rating is based on environment and hookah quality.
 
the place was practically empty since it was a random Thursday night. we had three people in my party. we sat at the big comfortable corner, they asked us to move since there was a minimum of 4 to be able to sit there. that bothered me since the place was empty and we wanted to be comfortable. not to mention It was not a smart business decision since my group of three middle eastern women were going to each order one hookah which is more than what a group of non middle easterners would smoke which Is generally one per two people (which is Another rule of theirs.. minimum one hookah for 2 people)
the hookah prices were high but I guess that's just vegas
my hookah and my friends hookah had an overwhelming mint flavor. when I told them, they switched the hose out and I ended up with a plastic china hose instead of a traditional hose. not ok for me.
they didn't like that I took the foil off the hookah head, but I don't like to smoke like that.

the place is not a place to go if you are hoping for a traditional middle eastern hookah experience. i don't want to wrap the parameter of the heads w foil, i don't want to sit on couches that have no backs, i don't want to smoke hookahs that are sitting on top of tables (hard to reach to rearrange coal) and i don't want to taste mint when i order grape... I also don't want to sit in an uncomfortable table and see 3 open corners just cause I didn't meet the minimum requirement of how many people need to be in my group just to sit there.

When I first walked in, I noticed that its pretty dark in here.  It is nothing like Rhumbar, which is well-lit (and obviously outdoors).  There are booths and cushioned sofas against the walls.  I like the lighting of the tables where the hookahs were placed.  Bf said the bathrooms are cool, maybe the mens bathroom has more decorations.  The womens bathroom is nothing special but its very clean at least!  Another thing about the atmosphere is that they play a lot of good music, and there are music videos playing on the mounted TVs... Yet they do not match.  I guess they dont have surround sound yet! 

Another cool thing is they put ice in the water so you get better smoke.  We ordered a Starbuzz Pink flavor and it was pretty tasty.  I liked that there was always someone walking around to change coals (kind of dangerous looking basket with hot coals).  

We did not order any food, but the kabobs smelt really good.  We did have a drink.  I think somewhere on the menu it says all hookah orders come with one drink order per person (but not included in the hookah price).  They have menu sets that come with entrees, a bowl of hookah, and a drink for two people, three, and so on.  

The service was not bad, all the guys that work there were really nice.  I ordered a shot of ouzo straight and the guy who brought it to me kept asking me if I wanted it on the rocks.  Well it was probably the strongest drink I have ever had but I wasnt about to change my mind for him.  Good looking out, man!  We also got 15% off our bill thanks to the Yelp deal! Sweeeet.

So my boyfriend ordered a whiskey and coke. The man next to us orders a coke, takes a sip of it and tells the waitress that it is not coke! she rudely brushed him off and said "" yes i know for a fact that it is"" and walked away. My boyfriend takes a sip of his drink and it is just coke! so she mixed our drink orders up. I had to get up out of my seat to find her, and tell her what happened. She than got an attitude and told me I was wrong  and they had ""bad coke"" which was to blame. wait what?: than she finally realizes what happened, and apologized. At this point i was pretty annoyed and it takes a lot to get me going. The same girl was hiding in the back and walking around pretty much doing nothing the entire long 2 hours we were there. 

We ordered 1 hookah which came with a free refill, hummus, chicken satay and 2 well drinks and 1 tea pot. Our total bill was $80 which i found to be overpriced. 

if you are looking for overpriced hookah,too much coal causing the hookah to burn out, expensive drinks, mediocre food and horrible service than this is your place.

The ambiance was typical hookah bar- Middle Eastern decor, lots of comfy couches, dark lighting.  The hookahs were very good and were serviced regularly. They have a guy who walks around doing tricks with the hot coals, so that was pretty cool. The music was fantastic- top 40/hip hop, which was perfect. Enough to feel like you were having a night out, but not so loud that you can't have a conversation. They even have private/VIP rooms. The seating is comfortable and the service is also good.

The only downside is that the drinks are rather pricey, especially since this is not a Strip bar/lounge. I definitely wasn't expecting $15 cocktails here. They were fine, but nothing special. The bathroom also could have been a bit cleaner.

The owner came over and was worse than his own staff, and demanded we move now since a big shot is coming...

Again we said we didnt mind we just needed a bigger table lol... The owner then aggressively told me this table was a mistake by our staff for you to sit here, this was one hour later of us sitting. He then snapped hookah from me and asked me and my group to get the f**k out.

So we did politely without an issue, the arrogance of this place left a bad taste in my mouth.

I also had a tasty Jolly Rancher cocktail. Members of the staff came around often enough to check on us and the coals for the Hookah. We also had a cup of Turkish coffee.

2927213,2011-07-31,1,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"When you enter, it is VERY dark. On the right, there are all the booths and on the left there's one long couch with a bunch of tables and hookahs lined up. There was only one group of people when we came in and no one by the door, so we waited a few seconds and a guy came out from the back to seat us. We were solely there to have some tapas and we explained that to him. He gave us a small booth in the back, which was nice and secluded and he took out two of the hookahs (there was 3 on the tiny table) so we could have room for the food. We couldn't help but bust out our cameras because the place just looked so sexy! The dark red and blue lighting, painted walls, and orange lit hookahs just gave it a very hip look. 

We perused through the menu, which included some funky names such as ""Wanna eat a pita?"" and ""Sum Yum Guy Satay"" that we both found pretty amusing. They also had a decent list of teas, including flowering tea ($12 a pot) and even some smoothies. We ended up ordering the following:

White Rose Tea - Very aromatic. I added a little sugar to mine and it was just perfect. Very subtle and relaxing. I can't get over the scent!

Mo'Rockin Beef Bowl (Slow cooked rib-eye on a bed of jasmine white rice) - This came in a pretty big bowl, which was perfect for sharing. However, Don enjoyed it a lot more than I did. I personally found it to be a little bland, but the meat was very tender

Sharing is Caring Sampler ($16), included the following:

Not Your Fava Bean Dip (""Fool Mudammas"" mixed with onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and olive oil) - I actually liked this more than the hummus. It was smooth and it really did taste like a mild bean dip. Very good with the pita bread

Sweet N Sweeter Chicken (Baked chicken honey on a bed of clementines) - Again, Don enjoyed this more than I did. I think it's more of an acquired taste that I can imagine many people liking, but it really just tasted like chicken that was rolled in honey bunches of oats to me, so I found it a little odd. 

Stuff it up your Kofta Kabob  (Marinated Egyptian ground beef stuffed with feta cheese and grilled on a skewer) - We both liked this a lot. The meat was juicy and flavorful, so I ended up pairing it with the caprese on the side.

Mo'Rockin Caprese (Feta cheese with tomatoes, cilantro, and Thai basil) - The feta was a little overpowering for me, so I ended up only eating all of the tomatoes with the Kabob, but they were very fresh and went perfectly with the kabob.

This Isn't About Me, It's About Hummus - This came on a big dish with a basket of pita bread. It was pretty grainy, but the flavor was just right and, when mixed with the bean dip, it made for a very pleasant dip.

Jo' Momma's Baklava (Fillo dough pastry stuffed with candied almonds and walnuts) - I've never had Baklava before this, so I didn't know what to expect. I liked that it came out nice and warm. It was also very flaky, which I am always a fan of and it had a delicate sweetness that was just right. Don, however, thought it had a ""weird"" taste, but I didn't detect that. 

The service was top notch, even though they didn't fill up our water glasses every single time they went empty, but that was completely understandable because the place is very dark. You can tell they really work as a team here because we were always checked up on and served by about four different people. The music was actually pretty good. They had a variety of reggae and some pretty upbeat music. I noticed they even accept requests. Some guy in one of the other booths ended up requesting ""Bad Boys"" and started dancing. 

My only real complaint is that their tables are WAY too small. At least if you're there to eat, which I'm sure majority of the customers aren't there for. All of our plates were given to us one by one because there wasn't room for a lot at once. This was just a small problem though, since the place is a hookah lounge and not an actual sit down restaurant.

All in all, we really enjoyed coming here. The ambiance was awesome and the service was tiptop. If we come here again I definitely want to get a hookah, maybe Fruit Loop flavor, and try their Cheesecake Lollipops. Yum!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,4,2,4,FAhBE9MwDZsA-6dqrIKi7w

I highly recommend the kofta sliders!  We ordered a large pot of the Egyption aliwizah(?) tea which our server regularly kept filled to the brim with hot water without any asking.

The hookah itself was the smoothest we've ever had and the staff were great about coming around regularly to knock off the ash.  The flavor itself wasn't spot on (we had 'pumpkin pie'), but it was still pretty good.

3202597,2013-12-27,0,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"I've never tried the food that everyone seems to rave about, but the hookah and the service was terrible. First of all, it is very expensive. To add to the expense, you are required to buy a drink which is nonsense to me. My group of 8 friends had to split their bill by only two separate checks and there's even a smoking fee of $5 if more than 2 people smoke on one hookah. The hookah wasn't that great in my opinion, we ordered 3 different kinds and none of them were memorable. You can barely taste it and most of the time it was harsh. When we went it wasn't that busy yet they only changed the coal for us two times (we had to ask for the coal for one of the times!) and it was harsh most of the time. I got really nauseated after (but that is probably my own fault for smoking when I was getting hungry) and it was almost so bad that I couldn't eat. 
I have no idea why it has more stars that 1. It's definitely not a place to go as a group. I could see that it would be nice as a couple thing, but I would still recommend The View. I do not believe this is the best hookah lounge in town, it is far from it. It may be Vegas but you can definately find cheaper places like The View, Cloud Nine, Rhumbar....

This was apart of our anniversary activities and I decided to leave and give the host my feedback. Terrible customer service! As I walked away she made snippy remarks so I replied in the same manner.

Here's my biggest concern. If you go here, please pay with cash, as I have experienced being double charged. I've been calling the place for days now during open and closed hours and to no avail, NO ONE answers the phone. I have emailed, left voice messages and no one has bothered to return a phone call. The mere fact that stuff like this happens and there's no concern for customer service in regards to transactions leads me to believe that something fraudulent is going on.

The food here is freaking awesome! They have a small selection but everything is made to order and is fresh. Their hookahs are clean which is a plus because most hookah lounges have nasty hoses. They give you the hookah tips here, and the water is 100% clear inside the bowl. Their hookah flavor menu is freaking awesome as well. Theres about 100's of combinations of flavors so you can be your own mixologist.

The drinks here are really good too. Cheap and strong lol. I ask for my signature jack & coke and they always put like 2-3 shots in my drink! Thanks guys ;)

The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hookah girls get too into flirting with the customers that they forget to check on other tables but its fine because I'm a pretty patient person.

5473091,2013-06-24,0,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book.
I've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.

Here is why:

1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness. The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative. They are excellent with their ability to match/mix flavors to your liking. They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences). SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours). Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking. The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).

2) FOOD/DRINKS: The food is excellent. All organic and fresh. You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this. The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic). None of them disappoint. Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.

3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well. They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly. It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes. They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations. They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).

4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space. It's a lounge so when I see people complain about ""table space"" I would suggest going to a restaurant. I make due with the space at hand. The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae. They mix it up often. I LOVE when they play reggae there. The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places). 

5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair. The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM. I go there during that time often. The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.

I have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe. It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees. I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.

Thank you Azuza.",mhHHgIC1HCAIq8tkGvtisg,5,0,5,hzYtn9gYWTJSdeTxbWURvw
5503239,2015-05-22,0,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"This place definitely stands up to the positive reviews. I don't understand why it has less than a 5 star rating with some folks. 

As a consultant/road worrier I'm always on the move. In a different city/state/country at any given time. Being in Vegas for the night, I had many MANY mind blowing options. I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I am that I happened to pick this place for my ""one night in Vegas.""  Eff ""the strip,"" this is where it's at. 

The staff is INCREDIBLE! Libby, I'm assuming the owner/manager/leader of the pack, is just as amazing as her looks. She's drop dead gorgeous but her attentiveness and her customer service skills outshine her beauty. IN A GOOD WAY! Actually, maybe they're on the same level. Yeah, Now that I think about it, she's just as hot as her customer service and attentiveness. She's one with the people, yo! TRUST. 

She stopped by often to make sure I had all I needed. I came here alone. Wah wah wah. Don't cry for me, Argentina, it's a part of the loan wolf/road worrier life style. But even with as busy as this place was, she was on point with her attentiveness. It makes you feel welcomed! And want to stay as long as possible!

Next, the food! Holy moly, jesus, write home about it NOW!! If the service is anything to rave about, the food matches the same! Good god, the hummus was on point! The flavour, the texture, the right amount of spice! I'm drooling just writing about it! Also, major points for having authentic tea and not the lame teabags most places serve. I drank the whole pot. By. My. Self. Don't judge. 

And the sheesha/hookah! Let's not even go there. I tried the ""chix mix"" per Libby's recommendation. Lemme tell you, Willis, not only is the lady gorgeous and warm and welcoming, but she also knows her stuff!! MAJOR MAJOR points. MAJOR. I told her the flavours I'm used to smoking. And she gave me an amazing recommendation. It went strong for over three hours. Yes, I was there for ages, and yes it was amazing. And yes, you should definitely be jealous! But why be jealous when you can come check this gem of a place out for your self!

Now, the music, no matter what your type, you'll love it here. Trust me. As an avid music lover, (along with my foodaddiction and taste for alcohol!) I was swaying to every beat that came on. By my self. Don't hate. 

Well Relaxed. Well Fed. Well Entertained. And, WELL TAKEN CARE OF!!!! What more could you POSSIBLY want?! So, stop reading the other unappreciated reviews and just come check this place out for your self! You're not gonna be disappointed. And if you happen to be amongst the few that miraculously don't like it, something's wrong with you. Not them!",NB2qP2k_78-XVogzoGReAw,5,0,5,_InD-ibTPfHp75K-NV4cNA

Downfalls was that I didn't like the fact if someone bought a drink, everyone had to buy a drink. Which I thought was kind of lame especially if you didn't want to drink any thing. I didn't get a chance to try the food. Only smoked hookah & the flavor was a watermelon kind, really yummy.",YmnBDY_egbjP_uxdAU-zbw,0,0,4,hOnr9X9OdUBF-DuoW5TgBg
5939344,2013-04-17,0,hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA,"one of the best places for a hookah i've been to. clean establishment, friendly service. hookahs are served with ice water in the base, providing a nicer experience. the coals are routinely changed out -- correctly with the filters blown out between.

some minor items i did not enjoy --
- table space is tight in some areas with tables butting up against your shins
- pricing is overly complicated and ridiculous
- cost is fairly expensive after the inclusion of a ""one drink minimum per person""",LB_dvaFy7Iv8RdLv4POYPQ,2,1,4,TtVA3qEqg5IdGGYFaeC0eQ

If you want a place with awesome sheesha and a fabulous manager, amazing setup, and great crowd this is it. Libby is off the hook, super sweet, very personable and knowledgeable of the sheesha biz. One of the staff wasn't the friendliest but don't let her ruin it for you, cause seriously the tables are so well constructed holding the sheesha in place and more so the owner, David made the tables custom. Come check this spot out, you won't regret it. Signing off - MNM",M9m1viBz8rJPu_oqmpbZxA,1,1,5,w5dC4wlqlvxeQ9d6c5WXyw

We have made visits almost exclusively on Saturday evenings and they can get busy but are never too packed where we don't enjoy our visit. Service is attentive and they change out coals and check on each table regularly.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,12,4,bUYccrv_khmXyFJTdp1vnw
