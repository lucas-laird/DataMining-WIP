Tried: Chicken enchiladas,  chicken tacquitos, chicken quesadilla, crunchy chicken and beef tacos, rice & beans etc.

Ive been eating that for a few years now since my college days and its always consistently good.
Also have had the Carne Asada Fries and they are pretty decent and the Chimichanga has been recommended to me by my friend for years.
Been to a few different locations thru-out the city but this one is the cleanest one.
Not an everyday kind of place but good enough to keep on the list for that once in a while visit.

The worst Roberto's we found was at a gas station, but  this location has a nice decor and has always been very clean.  The staff has been all hispanic, who better to make more authentic Mexican dishes?  A plus there.  And they have always been very nice and efficient

The food is a great value.  Big portions for a small price.  While we have liked a lot of things and go often, there have been some dishes that were not the best.  The nachos were a big dissapointment, very very greasy.  So they lose a star for a few bad dishes.  But their flour tortillas are the BEST!  They are HUGE!  I could make a meal out of those and refried beans only.

We're from Southern California (born and raised) and Roberto's is our go-to place for Mexican food. There is really no other place in Las Vegas that nails it like Roberto's does. It's excellent in every aspect from the quality to the ingredients to the service. This location in particular offers consistency of product and service that should be the model for all of their other locations.

I've eaten at probably every other Roberto's across Las Vegas and I've found every one except the Durango/ D.I. location to be perfect. That location seemed a bit disorganized on my visit and the people weren't of the caliber of the other locations. Not sure why, just my observation.

To add to the insult, what little girth it had was due to massive amounts of lettuce--it was about 80% lettuce and 20% fish.  When I was done, I felt like I didn't even eat at all.  Not to mention that at one point it had a weird bitter taste, enough to spit out what I was chewing--maybe I just munched on a cockroach.

Pros:
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
Very large portions.
Much closer to authentic than Taco Bell.
Doesn't make for an upset bathroom like Taco Bell.

Cons:
They never season beef or chicken good enough.
Unless we're talking tacos or burritos, sour cream is pretty much included on everything.
A bit too greasy sometimes.

Roberto's is some of the best Mexican food in all of Vegas. It's quite surprising that there's almost 50 locations of it all over town with how consistently good it is. I just wish they did a better job of seasoning meat so I don't have to pour a 1/2 cup of hot sauce or cheese over a burrito for flavor.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,0,4,6yPsimpV82apo54umSz0uA

Anywhoo, this location is cleaner than the rest. My sister who came to visit swore this place had the best breakfast burrito. It was way passed 1 AM , she was drunk and hungry. I did have to admit that cold winter night the burrito was good. 
Then we tried to recreate that moment couple months down the road..and the verdict was quite the opposite. 
Something happened to the cheap magic of the breakfast burrito. It was awful this time around. The meat and potatoes were so overcooked and salty. You couldn't taste the fluffy egg.

Their burritos are filling and perfect after a long bike ride or run. I also like their salsa bar. Though the salsas are far too hot for my white-girl tastes, I fill up on carrots (yes, they are HOT, but I grin and bear it), cucumbers, and radishes before I dig into my main meal. That way, I've had my fill of healthy vegetables and I have burrito leftovers for a snack later that day or the next.

My sons love the cheese quesadillas. They are basically heart-attacks-in-a-box--a carb/fat feast that is absolutely delicious.

1416517,2017-09-06,0,kwLlQn95rqiqvmM4Yc2hIg,"This is one of those places I just don't get. Attached to a full service car wash/gas station and a convenience store this place is always hopping with folks getting food to go. I have tried this location about a dozen times in the 10 years we lived in Vegas and it was always just decent, every other time. Remember I said decent not good. 

The food is always prepared overly salty, never the same portion any time you order it and every fourth time they give you the wrong to go order. Note that I don't order anything fancy here as nothing is fancy, I just order one of the beef taco combo plates.

There is no consistency with the food proportions and the way it's cooked. Sometimes the tacos are out of this world and served hot and sometimes the food is cold by the time I drive 5 minutes down the road and the beans taste old and they've salted my beef taco to death. In the second scenario I just end up throwing it in the trash after two bites.

Perhaps the secret to this place is to either be so drunk you don't notice how bad the food is or to take your to go order and sit down in one of the dirty, never bussed, communal round tables so you can scarf it down as your car gets washed or your gas gets pumped, that way the taste of the overly salty food just passes quickly through your taste buds. One more thing, this place employs the grumpiest, most un-friendly counter staff. Try smiling at them when you're paying and tipping 20% and all you get is a grumpy look or a scowl. Advice lighten up guys you're supposed to want customers to return.

If you want real authentic Mexican food in a clean place where people preparing your food not only prepare it with love and give you service with a smile, head to Pepe's. You'll be better off and be glad you didn't spend $9.95 on a taco plate.",hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw,1,0,2,ksHUukFYYKyllHkk6Z3b6Q

The food was very filling but not very appetizing. The carne asada was a bit bland and though the al pastor was better, it could still use a bit more seasoning. The best thing the al pastor had going for it was the portion...the taco is stuffed with meat.

I also visited another location last year where the food was a little better than this location but didn't meet the standards of the Roberto's I mentioned early on. Therefore this leaves me to believe Roberto's is hit or miss depending on the location you visit.

Today was just a disaster and I'm very off put about coming back here for a while.

Here are a few suggestions that I hope they follow as I've been eating at this place for over a year now:

1. Learn to begin calling orders by number and not by what people ordered. It will help with the inevitable confusion that ensues when people order the same thing!

2. It may make sense for you to have more than one register to take orders!

3. When I give you my card to pay, please, please, PLEASE stop walking away with it.  Fraud is abundant and you force me to have to watch your every move to make sure you don't swipe my card again.

4. When I order ""FOR HERE"" DO NOT put it in to go because it's easier for you...  Believe it or not, when you order ""FOR HERE"" you get better quality tacos and a larger portion.

5. Be consistent in your assembly of tacos!  Usually we get lots of cheese and chicken in our chicken tacos.  Now we get mostly lettuce, a PINCH of cheese and a few slivers of chicken! WHY? WHY? WHY?

6. WASH YOUR HANDS if you handle money and then my food.

7. Put priority on handing the food to your customers, rather than taking in the orders (see #2 about getting another register). Nothing chaps my a$$ more than waiting another 10 mins because you let me stare at my tacos and let them get cold as you take peoples orders. PRIORITIZE!

Summary:
What happened to the A-Team here. I came here today (1/8/2014) and it was like the C-Team was working the place.  Usually the cooks are fast and efficient, it looked like they were half asleep this time.  The cashier was very inefficient and slow and did not put the food out when it was ready.  I was just watching my food get cold and the food pile up behind him.  Then the food came with hardly any chicken or cheese.  Seriously? These are chicken tacos!  Either the entire team needs more training or some energy drinks.  What happened to my A-Team?!?

Tacos Tijuana on the east side was as authentic as could be (they had sesos, bucha, tripas, lengua, etc), cheap (just north of $20 for the three of us), and made a killer salsa. That place was a definite 5 star joint.

Habaneros Taco Grill just down the street had a wider selection, generous portions, a salsa bar with three salsas, pico, radishes, limes and the requisite pickled carrots. Nothing stood out but neither did anything suck. It was very satisfying and we left full and happy.

Roberto's pickled carrots were much better than Habaneros' but that's about it when it comes to saying the former was better than the latter. Roberto's should've been good but something was strangely lacking. There was no wow or even an oo-o. The ambiance was a bit off, too. Maybe because it was kinda cold inside or maybe it was the way-too-big cutout photo on the wall of the not-so-happy-to-be-celebrating-50-damn-years elderly Latino couple staring at you while you tried to enjoy your meal. Something just wasn't right about the place.

People kept streaming in one by one but nobody but us stayed to dine in. It was all take out. Maybe nobody wanted to stick around to actually eat there with Mr. and Mrs. Roberto staring at you without a smile on. If I had been in business for 50 years with multiple locations, I think I'd have a smile as big as a hard shell taco stuffed with all the fixings.

Back to the food. It was just ok. We went there because of the ratings, felt like we got suckered in, and had to go somewhere else to get a real fix. We don't need to go back, unless it's to steal the pickled carrots to go along something from Habaneros.",_RlWNkoiLYpijlb89V-CyA,0,0,3,AEYL1R9jvCx_yWwgB8jlJQ

After all, we all know good Mexican food comes from health food inspection failed places. I'm from Los Angeles, but I can recommend this place with two thumbs up.

Everything on the menu is good, like most Mexican places, it's the same stuff packaged in different things-- tacos, burritos, nachos, enchiladas, the food is the same but you choose how you want it served. The one thing to know is that the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. My girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla because she 'wasnt hungry' and received a half pizza-like monstrosity of cheesy chicken-y goodness overload.

My personal favorite are the carne asada nachos (order them to-go- for bigger portions) at around $7.50 coupled with a large horchata ($2.50) and you've got yourself a meal. My brother likes the #6 with steak (enchilada and burrito combo) and loves the red sauce on the enchiladas. Make note that pictures on the walls are not correct because the portions aren't that small (all the better for my bro) so I'd say for most things, you could split it with another bulimic person.

A couple of things I'd like to note:
- They're open 24 hours.
- The sour cream there is really good. I swear it's mixed with crack so if you like sour cream, try ordering a side of it for $0.99. They'll give you a lot.
- The guys there are really cool and speak relatively fluent English.
- They take credit cards.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,0,0,4,7xBqra2Tkcbe330hujIAmA

The chips and guacamole were a little different then other restaurants I've ordered from. I received a to go box filled with chips that were already topped with guacamole. I was expecting a cup filled with guac as it was a to go order.

The one on S. Fort Apache actually deemed pretty decent said my fellow diners as they are frequent eaters of the other Roberto's around Sin City.  

I ordered the Rolled Tacos (2 chicken and 1 beef) with Guacamole.  They were okay.  I think the frozen ones I had at home were a bit better.  The guacamole was plentiful, but a little too sweet for what I had in mind.  It would have been superb it my cheese was melted a bit...maybe add the cheese first and then pour on the guacamole?  The insides of my rolled tacos weren't hot enough for my tastes either.  Overall, they just weren't crispy enough for something that just came out of the deep fryer.  

I did get to try the Al Pastor soft tacos and those were definitely much yummier than my order!  The meat was super flavorful and definitely hitting my taste buds.  They taste even better when you load them up with freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce, and jalapeno peppers.  Unfortunately, my dining companion was a bit of a piggy and didn't bother saving any leftovers for me the next day!  Keep in mind that al pastor isn't offered at all the Roberto's, so take advantage of it when you find it on the menu.    

Another friend ordered what looked like the Carne Asada Fries and that was one hell of a mutha focker order!  When you open up your styrofoam box, it's like damn...that's your dinner?  Major bang for your buck for sure!  (It was noted that my friend said he got more here than at the other Roberto's!)

I finished up my meal with a $2 large Horchata that was oh so yummy!  And for two bucks, what a deal!  Hot damn!  It's hard to finish one of those big gulps on your own, so share it!  

We love Mexican restaurants that have a self service condiments section on the side.  I love loading up on tons of fresh limes, peppers, hot sauces, cucumbers, radishes, etc. without feeling like a pig 'cuz the staff isn't watching you overload.

If you like going to a taco shop and being stared at as you wait for your food this is your place. I ordered my usual Roberto's... Bean and cheese burrito and tamales. I was highly disappointed! The cheese on the bean and cheese was overwhelming. There was more cheese then beans and it was in one big clump. The tamales were decent but were kind of dry and hard/over cooked. 

I usually get a cup so I can get water well apparently this place doesn't believe in water because they have no water button on their fountain thing. The guys behind the counter were gawking so uncomfortably I was very relieved when my food finally came up. I probably won't be going back to this location.",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,1,0,2,HNN9bwmPf_S2ydST7CYlCg

The service is always decent but most importantly, the food is made really quickly compared to the other Robertos.  I always order ahead and it's usually waiting for me when I arrive.

The guy rarely gets the orders right and at he window when you TRY and let him know what's wrong he tries to convince you not to get what you ordered because he doesn't want to ring up anything or FIX anything. 

Then I get home and the me I ordered that's supposed to come with tortillas comes with none. Literally I'm over laying 30-50$$$ here for crap mediocre service when the one on Ft. Apache and Tropicana NEVER GIVES ME THESE ISSUES. 

If your restaurant can't handle the drive thru without having EXCUSES for their errors. 

When you call there they just blame each other , THEY NEVER APOLOGIZE OR try to fix what's just happened.

Every single time I go here I know to check my food because there is always something wrong with my order. Whether it's forgetting something, getting the wrong order, or putting guacamole on my boyfriends food when he specifically asked for it without because he's allergic, I deal with it every time BUT I can live with that, I just make sure it's checked before I leave. HOWEVER, today was the last straw with them. Of course, once again, they got our order wrong and we forgot to check it when leaving because we were in a rush, my boyfriends rolled tacos with just cheese turned into rolled tacos with guacamole (which they charged me extra for when we specifically asked for the cheese ones) then there was pico hidden under my chimichanga, (when I also specially asked for no pico) guess that's our fault for not checking this time BUT then I went to cut into my chimichanga and to my surprise the meat was BRIGHT RED, not their usual ""a little pink"" but actually raw bright red meat... Are you kidding me? At that point we were done and went back to get our money back and honestly if they would have been cool about it it would have been fine but the lady was completely rude. First she tried telling me that's how their meat always looks, I get the same thing every time, I know their meat is usually a little pink, but this was not just a little pink, this was 100% raw. Then she asked for the receipt, no problem, gave her the receipt which was the only receipt she had given me when she gave me back my card, but she still tried asking for another receipt and of course tried making every excuse she could until finally just giving me cash for my purchase. Had she not been rude about it all I would still probably go back because we love robertos and this is the closest one to us but now I will be driving the extra couple miles to go to the one on Durango.

I found out here as well (for the second time) that you need to ask for rice and pay extra for it. That's fine and dandy, I can live with it. But, the carne asada meat itself was meh, and the burrito in general was an OK for me. I wasn't too impressed. I also thought it'd be a hole-in-the-wall, which is what I was hoping for, but it's actually set-up like a fast food chain store! That was unexpected.

They normally always get our order right but one time they did forget to give us our carne asada fries. At least they had it ready when we came the second time around. 
I also like their pickled carrots and jalapenos are really good. I hate how some places cook the carrots and they're all soft so I am happy with the ones here.
It is a Roberto's so do not expect anything special.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,4,3,538y1GZXXRlNPAdg0dedmQ
