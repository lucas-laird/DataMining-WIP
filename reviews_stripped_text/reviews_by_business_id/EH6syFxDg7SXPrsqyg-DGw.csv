The only good thing about this place was the painted backdrop on the stage.",4bgpE8kMw8cQCaMin_dcww,0,0,1,oKI_WlXPWndCuwPA4xELiA

It's not one of my favorite venues, but it's not horrible either.  A giant mural of John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, and Henry Rollins by Danny Bennett decorates the back wall.  This place can get pretty crowded by the youngins with bands are playing, but it's a decent venue so that's understandable.  Drinks are reasonably priced.  Not a completely special place, but worth going if there's an act you want to catch.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,3,yxPbzu71vPZnSorCptlRrA

I wonder if Grumpy still runs the bar. I like this place. Booz is inexpensive and it's not really intimidating. The seats aren't as greasy as they used to be. It's a good thing this isn't a real emergency room. Cuz that would be gross. Definitely good band place - plus the seating isn't for ""bottle service"". It's funny because they are starting to market more. Yea...myspace... nuff said.",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,0,0,3,J5LmtEwLkgI_j6KpFIYhvQ
