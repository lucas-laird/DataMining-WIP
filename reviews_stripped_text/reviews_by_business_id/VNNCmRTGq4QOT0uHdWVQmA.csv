577825,2017-11-19,1,VNNCmRTGq4QOT0uHdWVQmA,"Worst experience in Vegas, shame on you Wynn.  It took 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. She took our drink order of coffee, a Bloody Mary and water, and said our regular server would bring them out. 20 minutes later the server brings out orange juice. Which was weird but it's okay, mistakes happen. So 10 minutes later we finally get our correct drinks and we place our order for food. We wait and wait and wait and 40 minutes later our outrageously priced below average food came out. The experience could've been saved if the food was decent, but it was thoughtless and cheap despite being expensive. I would've rather spent our $150 tab at Applebee's, and nobody spends $150 at the Bee's.  Instead, we got to enjoy a dry burger, what tasted like frozen wings from a bag, and a bowl of ice burg lettuce as a side salad. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on cocktail nuts and a box of wine instead. This joke of a restaurant is a GIANT nope.",yenoUp1guzhMIhc6jHnEpA,0,0,1,XTaGL5iLES-946kSwy3QQw

When you stay at the Wynn, you expect everything to be the best of the best of Vegas. So when you go to their sports bar, the table stakes are pretty well understood and there are certain areas where a place can go above and beyond the crowd.

Beer? You've got to have a good selection of beer. Charle's Bar has this nailed. Their ""coin toss"" was a pretty good bet for us. They had a seasonal Sam Adams on tap, and it was perfect for watching the NHL Western Semifinals (Vegas Knights won, of course!).

Burgers? If you can't do a killer burger, close your doors. The Charlie's burger is great:lots of fixings and a good sized patty.

Nachos! Whether you are watching hockey, football or baseball, a good plate of nachos is par for the course. You expect lots of tortilla chips, smothered with shredded and melted cheddar cheese, fresh salsa, guacamole, jalapeños, sour cream and other surprises. Charlies' nachos were very disappointing. Sub par. The guacamole looked like it came from a 7-11, the cheese was drizzled from a Cheez Wiz jar and no sour cream.

3781012,2017-09-18,0,VNNCmRTGq4QOT0uHdWVQmA,"My first time trying Charlie's, but I used to swing by here was it was called Zoozacrackers, which is where I'd like to have lunch when visiting the Wynn. Since then, it seems like this spot has been renovated, with the right half of the restaurant getting an amazing view of their fantastic sportsbook area. The food selection offers pub-like appetizers, salads, burgers, and sandwiches. I was a bit disappointed that the soup selection was only two items (clam chowder and something else.) But that might just be because I really wanted the motzo ball soup that the previous restaurant used to have.

Anyhow, I ordered the pretzel appetizer and a black & blue burger to share between myself and one other person. The pretzel is MASSIVE and comes hanging above two dips (one mustard and one cheese). This might be the best pretzel I've ever had in my life. It's really delicious and has the perfect amount of salt sprinkled on. I might just order the pretzel for myself next time. The burger was pretty good too, but it was a little on the small side. The burger doesn't come with anything included, so if you want fries you need to add it on. Just an odd note, but the kitchen isn't allowed to cut the burger in half for you. We asked but they said they couldn't and that they could give us a knife if we wanted to do it ourselves. Must be to keep the burger looking pretty when they bring it out.

Other than that, service here is pretty good. Our interactions with staff were always great. At one point, they clustered up and it was hard to get their attention, but I think someone famous was in the restaurant so there was some excitement. That was understandable so it didn't bother us too much. Otherwise, our experience here was really chill. It's nice to watch the huge wall of sports screens while having some coffee and pretzels. Their coffee is really good btw. But, I have to mention that the prices have increased noticably since the renovation. If I remember correctly the pretzel was about $13 and the burger $18.

Food: we ordered staples - turkey burger, fries and loaded nachos. The fries and nachos were brought to our table because the cook inadvertently put something on the burger we asked them not to serve because I have a severe allergy. As a result we waited about 15 minutes for the burger prepared how we ask for it but during the wait we had our nachos and fries. It was also very dry. The nachos were good but were served with a cheese sauce rather than shredded cheese which was a surprise. The fries were fries. 

Service: eh, I think we sat down around our server's break time or end of shift because there was a time when we didn't receive service and couldn't find anyone to help us but that's ok because the service before and after the empty window was good.

The wait staff was not too attentive and took forever to get our order placed and to get our check. Other than that, it is decent. Hopefully, they add more (healthier) options to the menu.",LfzZEw5lwcHIHTVwib_Qdg,1,0,4,ljlDX4hnEtsU5wR6-bH7CA

I also tried the Wynn quarter pounder vegan burger and although the patty tasted a lot like beef, the burger just reminded me of Burger Kings cheap veggie burger. The vegan chocolate shake was a good addition to it. It wasn't very milkshake like but was still great as chocolate milk on the side for a burger",HB2ZuK8vyTSkLU18KiqMxw,0,0,3,hWV4pbsS-vowDXJ3iRN24g

People seated after us are served. I finally say ""hello?!... remember us?.. we ordered our food a century ago""?! They bring it out about 30 seconds later. Cold pretzel and cold cheese and a box of burgers. The pretzel btw is enormous. Would have enjoyed it if it had been hot along with the cheese. The burgers were delicious, but well under cooked for my liking. My friend was so hungry, he said nothing and ate. I would have sent it back. I think this place is hit or miss. As you can see, they missed big time.",lCkR8V1fNtnRaqM3D-WPUg,2,1,2,XpaRLvjSKD49pvRWKxPASw

It is set in the middle of the Hotel overlooking the casino which provided a people watching view. The sandwich had an enormous amount of meat.

With Zoo Zoo Crackers gone, Charlie's Bar + Grill is now taking it's place. Located right next to the sports book and the atrium, most of the seating gives a good view of the casino where you can people watch from your table. 

I didn't see any specials but that didn't matter because we were thirsty for liquor and hungry for good food. Service was friendly and attentive just like the rest of the staff at the Wynn. The food was delish! The prices are pretty steep but I guess you're paying for the ambiance of the Wynn. 

I wish I've taken some pictures of the food but I couldn't wait so I went straight for the food. I ordered steak and tobacco frites while the rest of my family ordered buffalo wings, loaded nachos, fried chicken, parmesan buffalo wings. No complaints! Everything was perfect from the service to the food. One thing that was an eye sore was the bill. LMAO! 

Charlie's will be my go to place for casual dining at the Wynn.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,7,7,5,0K7e-vSncHdbFy9z5ExF7w

. It was delicious. My husband had the clam chowder. He said it was not ""fishy "" and the addition of bacon and green onion really kick it over the top. He also had a chicken sandwich and said it was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. I had the ultimate chicken nachos, and they were awesome. The nacho chips were fresh and well seasoned -which is a plus. The chicken was chunked, instead of shredded- which I liked. 
The service was also wonderful. Our server was attentive and came back several times to check on our food. Definitely give Charlies a try for lunch.",AhxWAdpRbaKysYwqJ6CTsw,2,1,5,gEWpupBn5ZLR-dGBXdH5ww

Now, it's very welcoming and the food is pretty freaking solid as well. It's proximity to the Wynn sportsbook makes it a great spot to grab a sandwich and watch the game. Overall, not too shabby! 

Legit-
Friendly staff 
Large portions 
Great drink
Selection 
Proximity to the sportsbook 
Well lit and welcoming

Your only option is paying for a $5 pickle or $12 more for enough fries to feed a family of 4. Will never eat here again and suggest you dont either.

It had that weird spiciness hot flavor to it. They pass it off as ""white sauce, thousand island style"". Nachos not so good. Needs pico or tomatoes. Looks good but looks are deceiving with that one. Servers were great. Scene was nice. Big screens everywhere. Very pricey tho. $80 for two burgers nachos and fries. The fries were really good tho too. Crispy hot and fresh.
