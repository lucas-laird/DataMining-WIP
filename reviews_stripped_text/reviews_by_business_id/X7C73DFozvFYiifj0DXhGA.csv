1248203,2018-05-13,1,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"Stopped by to check out this new place and: WOW!
Ordered the blueberry pineapple margarita and the kiwi mojito, and they were amazing. Refreshing and perfectly balanced. They also have a Skittles infused vodka that they use to make ""Taste the rainbow"". I'm gonna have to come back for that. 
Started my meal with the poke nachos and the French fry trio. Yum! Good size portion! For my entree I chose the Scottish salmon filet. OMG! Fresh ingredients, amazing presentation. The mashed cauliflower was delish! Kudos to chef Miguel and to Josh, the best and most entertaining flair bartender ever!
Live entertainment is offered Thu-Sat for now, and it was a pleasant surprise. They sounded very good, and the music wasn't obnoxiously loud.
They are open Wed-Sun, 5-11p, 12a on Fri and Sat. Loved this place, it's a great addition to the Suncoast.",3zuiM8dt9bq-1oHjpiEfrg,8,3,5,uT8JAKlO16Qjc7DikgkSNQ

The food was excellent and the server was able to answer questions and ensure the orders were correct.  Burger and fries are delish and I had the sorbet which was very good.

Only surprise was that the crowd was made up of a much, much older crowd. Seems 90 Ninety is marketing to a young crowd, but I suppose the oldsters are due a night out every now and again, too!  ;)",cs0Y0nio4n0uGEbAisBF6g,0,0,4,MylzVt_gViLrR75gfKYZcw

Ordered a beer, small talk with the bartender who did not have a name  tag, although other employees did.   Bartender did tell me about a few of his favorite dishes, decided on a burger and fries.  
Manager came behind bar, much more friendlier, seemed more interested in his guest. Did not address me. 
Will go back to check out happy hour. Overall will say interior is very nice.",II8eB5mYk200GW-m-wpsug,0,0,3,YykHHxeT75CiT_SKZKEztA

The bartenders are delightful and the food we sampled was tasty. 

However ladies, 90Ninety is NOT the place to gather your girlfriends for a Happy Hour martini. Gents, be prepared that your date may not be able to get her favorite cocktail at a happy hour price. The martinis are a standard 2 ounce size...though served in a lovely glass. 

So this is THE place for large portions of Happy Hour food and beer, but don't expect to get your cosmo or classic martini with any price break.",GwhnN6OAj7i1X9HSj55iLw,2,0,3,MzoD6jHVEpU7q2gsoqfQNA

I've been back 3 times since the grand opening.  Here's what I recommend:  lettuce wraps with chicken, hummus appetizer with warm pita bread, margarita pizza, kiwi mojito, and the deep dish cookie.

3241815,2018-06-15,0,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"This review is for the Happy Hour which is available throughout the restaurant including the outside patio. On this day outside dining was not for us due to the high temperature.
The dining room has a sports bar atmosphere with large TV's on three walls and loud music. Seating consist of booths along the wall, regular height tables in the center and some high top tables adjacent to the bar.
We were seated immediately and water arrived soon after. Food wait time was short and our server Elizabeth checked on our satisfaction. Empty plates were promptly removed.
The following items were ordered.
Giant Pretzel
Onion Rings
Chicken Wraps

The Pretzel was hot, soft and served with cheese and mustard sauces

Onion Rings had a nice crisp texture and served with a ranch dipping sauce

Chicken Wraps were served with two sauces, chili and peanut. There was more tofu than chicken. Most of the lettuce pieces were too small for wrapping. The dish was tasty but I would have preferred to taste the chicken. 
The pretzel and onion ring portions are large and definitely shareable with some left for take home. 

It was disappointing that wine is not available at a discount during Happy Hour. 

There are many choices for Happy Hour and we prefer others over 90 Ninety because of atmosphere and menu variety.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,1,0,3,yhsGu2uOPxLgIQ-8Ba0mZQ

This burger tastes as if it were to have real meat but is actually made from ""Heme"". If you do have room for more after that deliciousness make sure to try out the doughnuts Mmmm....  so warm and so round served with three sides. My favorite was chocolate though. The staff is very friendly Beth the server she is amazing. I am definitely going to recommend this place to my friends.

4714051,2018-06-06,0,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"Simple good dishes for an affordable price. We went on Sunday for an early dinner with a toddler and baby. There were already people lining up at the entrance before it opened. Interior was modern, sleek and most importantly clean. We made a reservation and were taken to our table almost immediately. We ordered the giant pretzel and chicken lettuce wraps for apps. They came out in minutes and were delicious, my picky toddler even eat the pretzel. It was soft and warm, lettuces wraps were yummy as well. I ordered the creole salmon and my husband ordered the fish tacos, my daughter had the cheeseburger sliders. The fish tacos were so good that my husband finished it before i could even get a chance to take a bite of it! The salmon came with asparagus and cauliflower mash with a side of tomato sauce I think. It hit the spot, there were no leftovers. The cheeseburger sliders were simple nothing to write home about but I loved the skinny fries that came with it. 

Great dining experience I wish it was closer to us because we live in Henderson but definitely a great place to go for food food without breaking the bank. We will be back!",DVtOnof-O1SwGYJ2EjrLRg,3,1,5,TJTJbcpfx7xXpIYhXVxbDA

I am pretty sure we have had every shareable menu item without disappointment. The fish tacos are out of this world! A perfect amount of spice with a little hint of sweet.

Joe the manager  came around to check on our meal and really made us feel welcomed. We had the giant pretzel and lettuce wraps which were both delicious. The pretzel was huge. Salmon and fish tacos for dinner. Both were cooked perfectly and the fish tacos had an amazing sauce. Sorbet for a nice refreshing desert and overall great meal.

4979730,2018-06-03,0,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"Yeeessss!!! This place is great!! New spot at Suncoast Casino and they have vegan options!! 

We checked them out for happy hour on a Thursday evening. Every team member we encountered was so friendly including the food runner who was so nice and caring and our bartenders where we had our dining experience. Ok straight to the happy hour and food!! HH includes FOOD and lots to choose from, select bottle beers, drafts and $5 you call it from higher end liquors. They also offer HH artisan pizza from the wood burning oven and let me say, they offer VEGAN cheese pizzas!! Yes!!! There are gf options for pizza and options for non-vegans :( and the pizzas are great size for 1, maybe 2 to share. We shared the giant pretzel (awesome) with mustard for me and cheese sauce for the Mr. They also have a reverse HH so check them out!

For our meals I had the Vegan Beyond Meat burger with their special vegan sauce (awesome) with sweet potato fries but heads up there is an upcharge and I wasn't informed and the Mr had the Cuban sandwich with fries and Tomatoe bisque soup. He said the soup and sandwich wad awesome but we agreed the fries were ok. Sweet pot fries were ok too. 

Decent wine list and they have a patio!! 

Check this great ambiance spot out!",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,1,0,5,DHb5ayhJAFWkNdoxdom4Qg
5484786,2018-06-30,0,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"The Suncoast has made some recent upgrades and 90 Ninety is an example of the direction they're headed: a more trendy dining option with a gorgeous interior. We had the pretzel and cheese with mustard (fantastic), hot wings (good), BBQ ribs (meh), and baja rock shrimp (recommended by the host). Service was great. We tried to reserve a table on Open Table, but it was down, so we called and had no issues getting in within an hour. 

My biggest issue might be a lack of my knowledge on ribs. The sauce was delicious - tangy and sweet, but the baby back ribs were tough. Cutting them with a knife was a challenge and I'm used to fall off the bone ribs. 

Otherwise, a good addition to their dining options. I'd return for the pretzel alone.",NE4M-eieJHOP7322Og_NnQ,0,0,3,TgfRafjDVqokPzNY93IVJw
5549314,2018-06-10,0,X7C73DFozvFYiifj0DXhGA,"We ordered their ""Rock Shrimp"", ""Chicken Nachos"" & ""Meat Lovers Pizza"". The rock shrimp was good. My husband thought it was a little salty. We weren't fans of the nachos. I think it was the nacho cheese that tasted like...plastic? There was not a lot of chicken either. We ended up sending them back. The pizza was great. We also got a couple of drinks. The ""Kiwi Mojito"", ""Strawberry Lemonade"" and ""Zombie"". All of them were FANTASTIC! Listen, that Zombie was NO JOKE! Very strong! Do yourself a favor and go during the late night happy hour. You're paying 50% off for the pizzas and some of the appetizers. The portions are still huge, even though it's half off!
