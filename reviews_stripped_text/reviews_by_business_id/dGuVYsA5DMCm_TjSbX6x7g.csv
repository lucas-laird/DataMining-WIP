20783,2013-11-04,1,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"The new king of Chicago style deep dish pizza in Las Vegas!

In my quest to find the best Chicago style pizza I try to taste any establishment that offers true deep dish pies. I stumbled upon Windy City while browsing Yelp (hooray!) and am I glad I found it!

Windy City is located on a nice corner with a small plaza out front. The interior is spacious and casual with Chicago memorabilia.

On to the important stuff: Chicago style deep dish pizza. Best I've tried in Las Vegas.

 The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and has an amazing buttery taste. The sauce is definitely a highlight, tangy, sweet and flavorful, next time i'll order some extra sauce to use on pasta! The cheese is creamy and tastes very fresh. If you order additional toppings you can rest assured the guys at Windy City don't hold back, they just pile the toppings! As always if you order a deep dish pizza, give it at least 10-15 more minutes than a traditional pizza. Good (and big) things take time...

The service is great, I was greeted with a smile and the staff was very pleasant to deal with.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,5,2,5,XJ-r5DAcEJmNh3DLMgJaVQ

50770,2015-03-26,0,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,This place is a fun little hole in the wall.  We came for the pizza.   Beware by the slice has limited hours.   They took a long time so we went to the front to ask and they said they forgot our slices and they were burnt.   We were told we had to wait longer for new slices.   It was a little annoying considering we had already waited a long time.  We watched three other families get there cooked food while we waited for two slices of pizza to be heated up.  Soda is served in styrofoam cups which is a little bit of a turn off to me.  We love that they have paper towel rolls on the tables!   The pizza was really good despite the long wait for slices of pizza that were already made. I would recommend this for tasty food.   The operation needs some improvement if they want to stay competitive.   Can't wait to try more another time.,spbGNR4n0Xs135hRhyO4VQ,0,0,3,WqGDj3_SJHh6isSruedJHg

124270,2013-01-21,0,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"Yes this is a pizza joint, but I was sent to review the burger as I often do, so here you go:

This particular iteration is located on Eastern just south of the 215 in your average Vegas strip mall. It's tucked in the corner behind an outdoor seating area identified with some fairly small signage. If I wasn't specifically looking for it I probably never would have seen it. The interior is filled with your standard plain pizza restaurant furniture, and fully decorated with plenty of Windy City sports team memorabilia. The menu predictably includes plenty of options involving hot dogs, pizzas, sausages, as well as burgers, wings and fingers.

I went with the #6 Windy City's Burger & Fries: ""a mouth watering 100% all beef patty with lettuce, onions, tomato & pickles. Special sauce served on sesame seed bun."" My burger was brought to me in a red plastic basket; I've hated this choice over a plate in the past, but it turned out to be large enough to work ok this time. The bun was a bit too large for the patty that was within, but it was very flaky and fresh. The meat had almost a questionable light grey color to it, but was somewhat flavorful and cooked well. It was not quite one of those patties you'd order medium rare, but still ok. The pickles and LTO were all good; fresh and just enough of each. The special sauce was kind of salty, and I'm not sure what it was exactly. I wasn't too crazy about it, but luckily it was only present in some spots. This was a messy burger, very juicy and not dry. Overall it was decent but nothing to go out of your way for.

The fries were of the very generic frozen variety, but they were cooked so well that I still enjoyed and ate them all. They were presented in a brown paper bag; I'm not sure if this is a tradition in Chicago or something? The #6 is a very reasonable $5.95. I was charged $8.86 so I assume this included another $1.75 for the fountain drink I ordered, and is apparently not included in the meal combo pricing. For a typical strip mall pizza restaurant this was a decent burger, but I think it's the same that you would get from probably any pizza restaurant in town so I can't say its worth going out of your way for. Still, if your friends or family are demanding pizza and you feel like eating something else, it's not the worst burger in the world.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,1,3,J8kumiZTm5oaDqlBA36fxQ

214321,2014-12-18,0,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"Ever since Chicago Tasty Dogs closed I thought I wouldn't find any place in Vegas close to me where I can get some quality Chi-Town eats whenever I felt homesick. I was very happy to find out that Windy City opened up in literally the same area. Once you walk inside you're met with a lot of Chicago-based memorabilia adorning the walls, so it really did make me feel at home. The staff are all really nice and are always a pleasure to see whenever I visit.

Here you will not only get Chicago style dogs (made with Vienna beef, nonetheless), but also other city staples like Maxwell St. Polish sausage, Italian beef sandwiches, Davenco gyros, and even Eli's cheesecake. As expected you can get deep dish pizza, but growing up it was all about Chicago style thin crust for me and they definitely do it right here: a crispy crust and cut in squares. And one thing I like to do here is, instead of just ordering the chili cheese fries, get a basket of fries with a cup of chili on the side to use for dipping.   

I find it odd how many Chicago food establishments are suddenly popping up all around Vegas. However, this place continues to be my personal favorite. And you don't have to come from the Windy City itself to enjoy this place. I've taken several people here who're unfamiliar with Chicago food and I've heard nothing but compliments. It's just a simple quaint place with a friendly atmosphere and good food, and that's all that really matters!",kYqYJ7L-JFitKgNpzmd_Tw,1,0,5,4Q5SOnyIRQ9TptZrdiWWvA

I have had the Italian Beef Sandwich twice, and the Foot Long Chili Dog today. 

The reason for no 5? Inconsistency? The first time I had the Beef Sammie, it was GREAT. Lots of delicious beef and cheese, and peppers and that jarsomething deliciousness these Chicago people put on everything, YUM! The second time? Bland. Not impressed. 

I also think they can be slow to get your order in if there is more than 1 order ahead of you. I would like to think it;s because everything is made fresh? ;) 

The chili dog was good, not the best I have had to be honest, the chili cheese dog from Sonic is 10000x better LOL..

When I eat hot dogs, I just like it plain. Literally just the bun and the hot dog inside. & that is the same case with my cousins. Then we'll have all the ingredients on the side to put in our hot dogs so we can control the ingredients that we want to put. But this is the ONLY hot dog place I know that can not give a PLAIN hot dog. They said they can't put it on the side when the ingredients are removable. Apparently she said that it has to be on it and I did not hear it so I came to her and told her I thought everything was on the side, so she gave off a rude vibe and said she already told me once that it has to be on the hot dog.

Needless to say no one ate the hot dogs. My cousins only ate the fries. Customer service is okay,- and the ambiance is good. I'll probably go back to try their pizzas and give it another try.",5eL7rlY6Ux7q3GrJpNjYGA,0,0,3,fk93AJ4IitrR7M_rWwXadA

I've eaten the sausage ($18.75), and two specialty pizzas ($21.50): WCBNP and the meat lovers. All are great, but the meat lovers is my favorite. The deep dish here isn't overly thick which I love because I like a good crust to sauce to toppings ratio. They get it right. The crust is buttery and delicious; it crisps beautifully so it can support the weight of the toppings (weak crust is another pet peeve). Toppings are fresh and so many combinations are possible. And it reheats well in the oven or toaster oven.

They have 50-cent wings on Tuesdays. I've finally tried those now, too. They are meaty, never greasy, yet super crispy. My preference is the Chicago hot, with no ranch or blue cheese. It has a nice kick and it's loaded with flavor. It's nice to actually taste hot wings.

They've had awesome specials for Blackhawks games, like buy a pizza, get one free. And coming up July 4th. They'll have .99 dogs (at both locations) with a soft drink purchase. Talk about a deal!",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,2,5,t_UFqwMLwgKFEc4lZZC9oA

Atmosphere and staff = fun, energetic, friendly. But not the kind of friendly you typically expect. They are looking to form real friendships/bonds with their customers. I've been here twice and I can already tell that they truly value their patrons. They have a lot of regulars and I don't blame them! 

First time, we had the Chicago style deep dish pizza with Italian sausage, mushroom, and onions. And oh man, SO GOOD!!! I have to tell you that I've sampled Chicago style everywhere -- from LA to SF to Chi town! And I have to say that this is on par -- if not better -- than the ones I tried in Chicago! Everything is well-balanced, cheese is OOEY-GOOEY GOODNESS, and they do not skimp on the meat. Everyone who knows pizza... knows that toppings are important, but what is equally important is the crust! And boy, this one delivers. Its soft, flavorful, yet crispy. 

I can't wait to try the hotdogs and gyros next! 

I recommend eating the pizza there though. I took one to go and though it was still good... it wasn't as good as when we sat there and dined in. Reheating in the oven helps a bit! But it is best right out the oven! 

Also, my bf is a huge Chicago Cubs fan -- and I think we found THE spot to watch games. I love the atmosphere. Everyone is a die-hard fan of anything Chicago! It makes all games that much more fun to watch amongst Chicagonians.",zLd_95bDEo8Wo-Ca7u54_g,2,2,5,qFtyrzfuj7veoPEfvd7fEw

The pizza  - nice crunchy crust with the graininess of the added cornmeal bottom ( which i like ) the sausage tasted great, probably a little more cheese than i prefer but not a bad thing.  The sauce - decent - strong oregano  taste.  And as usual, i dig the square cut as opposed to the standard slice cut.

The chili dog - a tasty mess !  Homemade chili ( no beans ) onions, cheese and mustard - ALL GOOD.  The sack of fries - nothing special.

Total cost - $26.50 ( not sure of breakdown cost between pizza and chili dog )

Upon further investigation by way of the Food Network and Google, I found out that this is the Chicago state dish along with the Chicago style pizza. While I never had the opportunity to try this item in Chicago, I was pleasantly surprised that a Chicago style eatery had opened near my house.

#13 Windy City Combo - A Chicago style Italian Beef and Sausage Sandwich
Ordered this because I wanted to try an italian beef, but also wanted to try it with an Italian Sausage. Also wanted it ""extra wet"" to give it that authentic experience. The roast beef was extremely tender and flavorful with hints of garlic and spices. The italian sausage was flavorful with a little kick to it as well. And the roll was juicy due to the sandwich being dunked in a beef broth. All in all, it was a great sandwich.

I will be back to try the Chicago style Pizza, great experience here!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,5,1,4,yg5wTESQhr-wlltdpBDZdw

My only complaint is there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza and too much sauce. They could be a little bit friendlier at the front desk but whatever. I was reading some comments about them being rude but I just assumed they were more straightforward in Chicago. The lady doesn't give off a friendly vibe but a business vibe, and that's fine.  I love the breading/crust!  It is very thick. It reminds me of Papa Johns breadsticks which I love. The thick crust that is. I haven't tried the thin crust so I can't make comment on that. The thin crust is significantly cheaper, I believe it was like $11 for a small $18 for a small but it is enough for 3 people. Anyways, try the deep dish pizza it is good. The only other ""Chicago"" pizza I've tried is East of Chicago pizza which is actually one of my favorites. Chicago is pretty good with the pizza.
Also which was kind of cool, they have a white board in the front with a name on it, and if its your name they give you a free hotdog. Just a nice thing to do I suppose. Also a good place to watch sports and they have several tvs and a projector which is located in the front.",BGZcv3B3mlofVJYG_TTsMw,0,0,4,2b-WbAMdPUDnAlfvyZf-aQ

I mentioned this to the Woman, who took my order that I was all the way from Pahrump and how much I was really looking forward to having some freshly made Chicago style pizza in a very long time. 

The Frozen Deep Dish pizzas from Chicago chains that you can order online for home delivery just aren't that great in my opinion.

I ordered their large Deep Dish and the large thin crust square cut style to go and a bottle of hot Gardinera and then I left to go move my car...I had parked in a bad spot because the parking area was jam packed.

When I came back to pick up my pizzas... the lady at the counter acted oddly, even nervous in fact I thought at the time maybe It was my appearance. She told me she gave me the discount for some current coupon they were accepting that day.

I was all that's great and thank you very much...the 2 pizzas still came to just under $50 dollars in total... but I thought wow! How considerate of her.

When I got back home I was really excited about having some authentic Chicago style food....you just can't get that in this small town I poured a glass of cold beer to celebrate my extra effort of driving all that way.

The verdict:  a God Awful disappointment!!! the deep dish pizza crust was burnt so badly it left a appallingly bitter taste in my mouth a flavor that permeated the whole pizza...The thin crust as well was way over cooked...both ended up in the trash can.

I think I can see why the lady working there was so nervous and gave me a slight discount....very bad form on her part if it was done on purpose.

I wish when they realized they were badly burnt she had offered to make 2 new pizzas and just apologize for the extra wait.

However it's possible it was just a mistake, maybe she didn't know the crust was burnt since the top of the Deep Dish pizza looked great but that shows a lack of quality control at least on this occasion.

To be fair this occurred months ago and I've only been there once and maybe the food and service is normally great and accidents can happen with food.",730-dTWiH_xNiqdbDlkE4A,5,0,1,asQUKIA9nhu4Adx3PqQV2Q

There are a few binders filled with old memories from Chicago for you to look through but I think there were all just black and white printing from online. 

I love deep dish pizza so instant 4 star.  I've already gone to Chicago and ate the good stuff a number of times but I'm far from any expert on the stuff.  A New Yorker might say MEH cause it's not NY pizza.  A Chicagoan might say MEH cause it's not as good as back home.  Honestly I'd say we're not in Chicago or New York we're in Vegas/Henderson :) Don't be offended everyone I haven't read anyone reviews but heard how some think when it comes to pizza.  I enjoyed it enough to go once on Friday that a few days later on a Monday.  It's not a fancy pizzeria that you dress up for and pay high prices.  It is just a good pizza, really the ingredients to make a pizza are literally 1/4 of the price everyone else charges for. Their deep dish is plenty filling like how a deep dish should be.  Thick, gooey, and made to be eaten with a knife and fork or hands if I was at home.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me and I would've loved to have a more buttery crust but all in all cooked properly together with some good ingredients it made a very satisfying pizza. Lots of cheese, meat, and sauce in a deep dish crust you can never go wrong.

They also made a thin crust which also wasn't that bad. They were cut into squares and about the thickness of a ""regular"" pizza. Not very thin and extra crispy like other thin crusts I've had.  Their pizzas are good especially when you get them on day where they're selling it at buy one get one free, check their calendar for daily specials.  If you don't really know what kind of pizza to order just order their WCBNP Pizza thin crust or deep dish it's a mixture of various ingredients or just keep it simple with cheese, meat, and sauce in a deep dish.

M-F during lunch they serve deep dish by the slice for $4. The slice is almost a quarter in size of the whole thing. With these try to get here early when their fresh out the oven cause it does sit and they when they warm it up it the crust might get hard.  

There have 2 hotdog for $1 and often offer free Chicago dog to anyone named whatever random name they put up on the board. There's multiple large flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant for watching sports. Cheese cake on a stick. There's lots of space inside. If you want to sit outside in the shared patio with other business at night they'll setup some light to see. Good service and reasonably priced.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,3,4,5YlObrAUtUJv4Xk4Uv0XMQ

First off the customer service. They are actually nice here. I used to put up with another pizza place in the area; that place had hung up on me and are impatient. None of that here.

Thin crust is cut into squares. The middle pieces are hard to eat. Maybe get cutlery. Make sure you have tons of napkins and cover your clothes. Loads of delicious oil drips off. 

Meat special is loaded with pepperoni, sausage, bacon and ground meat. The pepperoni is so good. It actually tastes so good you try to find pieces with more of them. The ground meat contrasts with a barely seasoned taste, just meaty. I don't remember running into much bacon, but this pizza was good. 

Chicago Style Italian Sausage comes in mild and hot. I opted for mild and got it wet. The bread is soggy but dense enough to hold up. It's loaded with sweet peppers. You can also get a side of marinara which I not only put in my sandwich, but dipped my fries in. Good stuff! Like the pizza eating this sandwich was a messy experience, but tasty.

Grab a calendar. They have random deals, things like if your name starts with the letter ""g"" you get a discount. They are active on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/WindyCityBeefsnpizza?fref=ts

We've come twice with Groupons and it is such a steal!! The salads are a miss with generic iceberg, tomatoes, and little else I remember with a choice of garlic or ranch dressing. It is more like ranch with a side of lettuce than vice versa since it is too thick to drizzle. Moving on, the pizza is the star of the show!! We ordered the deep dish with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, and onion and boy do they pile it on! Every bite has plenty of toppings and a very crispy crust on the bottom. I don't even know how this is possible when so many NY style pizza places can't even manage to keep their crusts crispy with minimal toppings. I think this pizza may be the 8th world wonder. 

The cheese used is amazing. It stretches and stretches. I bet it could reach the length of the table. Last time we were here on a Tuesday, and they had 50 cent wings. The wings here are always plain and come with various sauces to dip. They are legitimate, crispy, fried to perfection wings.

Got the one for $19 that was my first mistake I made thinking this place knew what a Chicago pizza even was. Well I was right putting sauce on top of a pan crust pizza is not a Chicago pizza look at your fake picture that a real pizza.  I guess they have never even been to Chicago or tried a real Chicago pizza before. I ate 2 slices could not even find or taste the topping on it had to put ranch and Sriracha just to get it down. The cheese was questionable not even sure if it was real cheese no stringiness to it. The pizza just taste like grease with a can of tomato sauce on top. The other 6 slices in about the only thing Chicago like was the pizza box are in my garage in the trash can and that is the first time I ever threw a pizza away in my life. The salads that came with it was a joke only iceberg lettuce and 2 not ripe thin slices of tomatoes and some expired onions plus the garlic mayo they call a dressing (disgusting) that normally they charge $4 for lol food cost is about $ .55 cents per salad. I understand markup but give me a break this place is a ripe off. As far as the 2 cannolis that came with it was store bought after one bite they went in the trash also. So that was a waste of $ 19 plus the $ 1.88 tax it would have been better spent at Walmart on frozen pizza , head of lettuce , tomato and a onion. Then I could have bought a real desert and still had dollars left over. The inside of the place is not even worth mentioning or the employees either because you should never have to go inside this dump.

I bookmarked this place because of all the check ins I see from my Yelp friends! If that many people just from my friends list go here, then it must be good! So the very first chance I got im all over it!

I asked the lady behind the counter what was good. She smiled and said everything. I asked what was good for a first timer. She said either the thin crust pizza or the Italian Beef or Sausage. So as my first ever order I went with the #13 Combo which was Italian Beef and Sausage on a roll which comes with fries and a drink. I also opted for the mozzarella cheese and sweet peppers. She asked if I wanted the sandwich dry, wet, or dipped. HUH? I guess I am a noob. Dry, the sandwich is just that. No sauce whatsover. Wet, they put a little bit of Au jus on the sandwich. Dipped, they literally dip the bottom half of the sandwich in Au jus. This sounded very intriguing so I picked that. 

When I got my sandwich, the bottom half of the bread was literally falling apart from the sogginess of the Au Jus. Like the noob I was, I still picked it up and tried to eat it like a regular sandwich. That's when I noticed the plastic fork that came with it. FAIL. Needless to say, it was really good. The Beef and Sausage put together was like Batman and Robin, Shaq and Kobe, Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.......ok that last one was a bad example. Anyways, you know what I mean. The two meats mixed with melted mozzarella cheese and sweet peppers were fantasmic! (refer to my pic!) The fries were nothing to be excited about.

As I was scarfing down my meal, I noticed from the little cardboard cutout thingies that form a triangle (there were two of them) on the table. One had a picture of a Frozen Chocolate Dipped Cheesecake on a stick! The other said that tuesdays were 50 cent wing tuesdays. Just these two pieces of info alone should be more than enough to warrant another trip or three in the future!

I paid about around 10 bucks for my meal  which definitely filled me up. That was about the average price for any one of their combos. 

Since the theme and ambiance was based out of Chicago, of course everything you saw on the walls were nothing but things about the windy city! The overall size of the place was very spacious and the location is sort of tucked away in a nice sized plaza. 

I am definitely coming back to try the thin crust pizza and wings, especially on a tuesday! They have specials everyday. The day I went, the special was if your name was Dorothy or Ryan, you get a free hot dog! (with proof of your ID)

So in closing, this is another one of those places that you are glad you checked out for it will be on one of your good grub places to eat list! So yeah, I am definitely a fan!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,9,9,4,9442amNpSB-QFwU_liCoyQ

It's not that I would eat hot dogs in Chicago often (not the healthiest of meals).  But when you have a taste for a RealDeal Chicago Dog and cannot quench it, that quench festers -- sometimes for years at a time.

So I was off-the-wall bonkers to discover this Highly-Rated Chicago HotDoggery in the middle of Las Vegas on my last trip there.

It's RealDeal and then some, bless them.  A soft, steamed poppy seed bun filled with the perfectly steamed Vienna Frank then topped with yellow mustard, neon-green pickle relish, chopped onions, a slice of kosher pickle, sliced tomatoes and Louisiana sport peppers, all bathed in a sprinkle of celery salt.  When done properly (as done in this establishment) it truly is a meal that would be fawned over in Paris.  It's that good!

Then to ice it, they serve Chicago-style hot tamales.  They're nothing like the authentic banana leaf tamales as served in L.A., but I guarantee you they taste infinitely better.

That was couple of years ago, and I never voted for them because I never made to that location, but I have to agree with him now on their sister location.

When I think of Chicago foods, the first thing I that comes to mind is the SNL skit of the Mike Ditka fan's.   Just watching those guys "" Kobayashiing"" a bunch of dogs, and self-resuscitating themselves back to life after getting a massive heart attack was pretty funny.   Well, this could happen if you ate this way 24/7, 365 days a year, but what the heck....you have to treat yourself once in awhile, and why not here because it's sinfully good.

I'm no expert on deep dish pizza, but this pie is worth the drive.   Personally, I'm more of thin crust pizza guy, but this pie is my exception.   The crust at it thinnest area is about twice as thick as thin crust pizza, and it does need it because this pizza is packed with Meat, and cheese.   The sweet chunks of tomatoes flows with the sauce on top, and this pie is not weak hearted, because after eating two slices I was done for dinner.   It was tasty, filling, and reminded me of the old Red Lion pizza in Waikiki(back in 1990's)

From what seen on the daily special board, there always a special if your name match the name of day.   Too bad for me, my name beyond uncommon.    Oh well.

I had a few of their sandwiches on another visit, and the Chicago beef was very good, but it was the fries that impressed me.

After reading solid reviews from LV Weekly and Seven I figured it was worth a visit.  Tucked away in a strip mall of off Eastern Ave (billed by me as the best road outside of the strip to find good eats), I feel Chicago authenticity when I walk in.  Just like the Vienna sausage company HQ in Chicago, IL, Windy City has yellow walls and plenty of Chicago maps and memorabilia.

The pizza comes in two Chicago styles, a thin crust or deep dish.  This time around I ordered the thin crust which had very melty cheese (not rubbery) and a good amount of sauce and well seasoned toppings.  As an app we had winds with a medium sauce, they didn't look good at first, but they were just the right amount of crisp and the sauce was a nice kick. 

This isn't the normal sorta light and dry thin crust you come to expect at Sammie's or CPK and while I still enjoy those places, I must say that Windy City takes the crown.  Next-up: Deep Dish!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,1,1,4,ERPjXHPQCjqgxr3zBYoaaA

I was recommended by a friend for their deep dish pizza! And i think it is one of their best things they have here.. maybe they have other great things like the hot dogs but i didnt try them when i was there. They do look delicious on their yelp pictures though. 

I suggest you to call and order ahead for the deep dish pizza, it takes them about 30 plus minutes to make them. Three of us ladies ordered #8 the wings with fries and also a 12 inch deep dish specialty pizza. 

The wings came out in about short 5 minutes, the buffalo sauce is delicious very good with the wings (and also with the pizza when that came out) the bbq sauce felt a bit tangy.   

BUT look at the picture of my deep dish pizza! Not super thick bread , it was filled with lots of cheese, sausage and tomato sauce, i would say it is authentic Chicago deep dish, not those super thick bread ones you find else where here in vegas.

Five stars. really? Eff yes. The pie is perfect in my eyes. The sauce is the best pizza sauce I've had in months. Chunky, sweet, not spicy. Just perfect. The crust is crispy, yet soft in some spots and buttery. Other Deep Dish pies I've had have been entirely too doughy for my taste. Not this one. Also it's not too deep. I could eat this shit for every meal and I have....It's even good cold. My one tiny complaint about this is when you are dining in the restaurant they give you a plastic spork to eat with. I don't know if the owners have tried doing this, but it just doesn't work. Maybe they have flimzy sporks just to laugh at us. I ended up flicking the sauce all over my shirt which sucked since I was going to a party after. Yes, instead of pregaming on vodka at home (so 2010) I pregame with some deep dish pizza.

As far as the BEEF in Windy City Beefs N Pizza I can't and won't give my opinion just yet. I haven't tried it, but I am sure I will at some point. Chicago dogs are one of my favorite food groups so I will let you know whaz up when that happens. 

Customer service is beyond great here. When I have dined in they check on you, but not to the point of annoying. Also, I ordered pizza to go and when I got it home I realized the crust was overdone. Seeing as though I paid $17 for a 12"" za I called the restaurant to let them know. I spoke to Dakota who happens to be one of the owners and he apologized and said he would make me a new pizza and have it delivered right away. When getting up to get the order number I spilled the god damn Ranch dressing all over my pants, feet, couch and carpet like a champ. When my new za arrived 40 minutes later it was piping hot and had two Ranch dressings in the box. The owner delivered it himself and apologized again and collected the overdone pizza to show to the staff. Customer Satisfuckinfaction.

I don't know shit if it tastes like REAL Chicago pizza and frankly I feel bad for you folks who have to compare everything to that. What I do know is it tastes amazing to me.

The pizza was absolutely delicious. Seriously The Best pizza I have ever had. It looked nothing like the deep dish pizza they had on their menu, but it tasted so good I could care less. The crust was perfection and that comes from someone who doesn't care for crust. The cheese was a wonderful melty, gooey yumminess. I chose mushroom, sausage, pepperoni and green peppers for my toppings. The sauce was perfectly seasoned. It was awesome! 

The salad was mediocre. Nothing spectacular, but I didn't come for salad so I could care less what the salad was. And for the value I got in the pizza from the Groupon it made up for your basic shredded iceberg lettuce, a few tomatoes, and sliced carrot. I believe the pizza alone would have been $21.50

I was so full after gouging on that fabulous pizza I couldn't fit the cannoli, but I did take a bite of it to taste. The filling was good. Not too sweet. Creamy sweetened cream cheese with bits of chocolate chips. It tasted like cream cheese anyway. I don't think it was ricotta. 

They have a 50 cent wing Tuesday with a minimum of 6 wings per order. Unfortunately I didn't order any because I knew we weren't going to be able to finish the pizza.

I will admit that I am not a fan of deep-dish pizza, favoring the Neapolitan style crust we make at home. For once I didn't get my way, being out voted 2-1 in favor of the Chicago style house specialty. 
    I griped that the pizza was going to take 30 minutes. I whined to my girlfriend that I didn't like deep dish. I told my best friend that his favorite football team sucked and I suspected he was gay. I stewed in the smoldering resentment of my own girlfriend and best friend betraying my superior knowledge of what constitutes good pizza. 

Then it arrived.  

Thick, perfectly cooked, thin wisps of motz cheese clinging for life as each slice was pulled away. In short, it was the fucking bomb. Even if you are not a deep dish fan (like myself) I would highly encourage you to try a pie from Windy City; just learn from my experience and don't say shit until you taste it.",dEajhmcM4CRR7EyMUVedDQ,1,0,5,owJ_0-9YBYfy40YD7l_KSA

So, after a not so great visit to Taco y Taco, decided to come here for some more food.
We ordered the sandwich and you can get it 3 ways....dry, with a ladle of au jus, or the whole sandwich dipped. We opted for the ladle. Also, you can add cheese and gardinere, which we did. 
I guess I should have ordered dry with au jus on side, because I did not care for the amount of juice on it. It made the bread completely soggy and we ate in and had it fresh, and it was sooooo soggy. Like, borderline gross, but the flavor was pretty good.
I wasn't impressed with the gardinere at all. I thought it would be tastier, or better and it was just eh.
I doubt I'd come back to this location, as it's far from me, but I would like to have that sandwich again, and I believe the have a location near Summerlin.",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,1,1,3,sEOZ7EsCXOwpWf5U1Cjpwg

The rest......eh. The beef is a pre-cooked product as told by the person behind the counter. The great beef stands in Chicago roast their own beef and use seasonings that may vary from place to place , but have a much better flavor than what I found here. The bread which is an big part of the Beef Sandwich is a thick crusted bread that soaks up the juices without getting doughy. Not the case here. The pizza........ forgetaboutit. It is not at all real Chicago style. I grew up in a family that owned a top Pizza-aria that was well known in the area. We were in business over 60 years.

3516988,2013-01-26,4,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw the photos that fellow yelper Shirley B. posted of her meals here.

They have a location on Lake Mead & Buffalo that is much closer to my house but, I noticed an event submitted by another yelper Jaime W., that they were opening this newer location and having a grand opening special where the whole day everyone got 50% off the whole total dine-in bill! How could I not help support a local business and take advantage of such a great discount?!?! The place was packed! I was so glad that we were even able to get a table. The wait for our food was almost an hour but we knew upon walking in that it was a mad house inside and wanted to wait it out. Staff came by to talk to us regularly. It was nice to see all the support this place was getting. Since I knew we were getting 50% off the whole bill I figured this was a good way to sample several things and see what I liked and didn't. Here it goes!

The ""Chicago Deep Dish Cheese Pizza"" was by far the best part of the meal. The sauce is sweet and super tasty. The crust is thick and crisp on the bottom and chewy in the middle. I would always order this! The sad part is they told us that they only make pizza at this Eastern location. The Lake Mead location makes hot dogs and sandwiches. We would make the drive to this Eastern location just for the pizza!

Next was the ""Windy City's Chicago Style Hot Dog"". This is a spot on Chicago dog people! We are talking a Vienna all beef hot dog with a steamed (makes such a difference in how the dog comes together) Vienna poppy seed bun, mustard, onion, green relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers and celery salt. The green relish is to die for! I recommend this for sure!

I wasn't impressed with the ""Windy City's Chicago Style Italian Beef Sandwich"". It had no flavor. If any of you have ever eaten at a ""Portillo's"" or ""Al's Beef"" in Chicago then you know what  good Italian beef is and this one here at WCBNP just doesn't cut it. I am willing to give this sandwich another try though since they were so busy maybe something was off and we did order multiple things. This sandwich was no reason not to give a 5 star review still because everything else was perfect.

We tried the ""Windy City's Maxwell Polish"" and I personally liked it. My man thought it was too charred on the outside but I like mine burnt! This one is a Vienna Polish sausage and you can get it plain or spicy, we chose spicy. They steam the sausage then grill it and serve it on a Vienna poppy seed muffin with mustard, grilled onions and sport peppers. 

I wanted to try their fries so I ordered the ""Full Basket Of Chili Cheese Fries"". I had them add onions. This was so good, but chili had an off flavor. Chili with no beans wasn't the issue. The fries were great. 

The place is clean and I noticed someone always wiping things down.

They serve beer and wine.

You can place an order for delivery! Call to find out if you are in the delivery area! They deliver up to 5 miles from WCBNP and charge $3.00 for delivery.

Check their website for monthly specials and coupons.

They do not accept personal checks or American Express. They do accept cash, visa, discover, and master card.

Outside is plenty of seating and in the middle of the seating is a peaceful sounding waterfall. So relaxing on a nice day I bet.

Lastly, go try this place!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,19,11,5,G2XbBvKAPGvdif-sxLUCyA

We had the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, my half had sausage and anchovie, and my boyfriend's half had pepperoni and mushroom. Both tasted great! The sauce is nice and thick, authentic and delicious. They put it on top so all the cheese and toppings stay on the crust.

We also started our meal with the pretzels, which was a mistake. Not because they were bad, they were awesome! Nice and yeasty, just how I like. The cheese sauce was smooth and creamy with just a little black pepper. The problem was that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we couldn't finish our pizza, no matter how hard we tried.

The hot dogs are good too, but the pizza is where it's at. The lady at the counter was also very friendly and patient while we decided what to get. We've tried a few other pizza joints but we always come back to Windy City!",PFdYlR5Jb0MNSb3L_AzJZg,0,0,5,NXJdt-77ijNHOAhPb5NwmA

We had a Chicago hot dog. It was perfect. (Only ate it on day one ;-)

The service is great and everything tastes like it did back in Chicago.  Real Vienna beef and hot dogs, S. Rosen poppyseed buns, pizza puffs, Jay's potato chips, Old Style beer and Green River soda can all be found here!  

I've had the pizza and the thin crust is crisp with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The deep dish has a sweet tomato sauce on top and the pepperoni actually has a little bit of spice to it, which is way better than the bland stuff the chains use.  The crust is a butter crust similar to Lou Malnati's or Ricobene's deep dish.

The hot dogs are made authentic Chicago-style (no ketchup) and include the neon green relish, mustard, celery salt and sport peppers on a Vienna beef dog with a poppyseed bun.  Can't get any better than that.

The Italian beef is by far my favorite.  On an Italian roll, of course you have to get it dipped so the bread is falling apart and the au jus runs down your arm.  If you like spicy stuff, get their homemade hot giardinera made with habanero peppers.  No need to thank me.

Pizza gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't.

I couldn't agree with this sentiment more, except I would probably seriously maim anybody who tried to stand in the way of me and this pizza. 

Deep dish is a while wait, but when you've got a place to sit outside, good company, and Nothing Bundt Cakes next door, what's the problem? Wait for the feast you're about to embark on.

A huge selection of toppings and of combos for Chicago dogs. The deep dish is crispy but then doughy towards the middle just the way it should be. I snarfed 3 pieces before I realized that I may go into cardiac arrest before the day was done. Then I ate the leftovers (heated up in the oven like bosses do) for dinner the next day and I was in heaven all over again.

My first stop in Chicago is Gino's, Lou's, Portillo's and Hot Doug's. Yes I will eat all in one day. I love a good, flaky crust. This pizza had a great crust, along with big meaty pieces of tomato. The kicker, they have giardineira. YES I love giardineira on my pies, but I wasn't in love with the brand they carry. My only complaint is the pizza could have been left in a tad longer, the sauce was on the lukewarm side. Since it is deep dish, plan to wait 45-60mins for it to cook. We passed the time by splitting a hot dog. They are pretty small, but perfect for an appetizer. I do realize I'm not in Chicago so I'm not gonna get all crazy and compare them to the real deal, but this can definitely suffice in between my trips.

Bottom line is that if I need a deep dish fix and don't want to go to the Strip (and wait forever there) for Giordano's, this place will get the job done.

Being from Chicago, whenever I see a restaurant that advertises its product as authentic Chicago food, I have to try it.  Tonight I stopped by to order the Italian beef/sausage combos for takeout from Windy City Beefs 'n Pizza.  The young lady behind the counter kept insisting how Chicago authentic the food was, but when asked if she was from Chicago, she stated no.  However, on with my order, the ""Chicago"" beef.  First of all, the sandwich didn't consist of ""thin slices"" of beef as described in their menu but instead the beef in the sandwich was in very small pieces.  And something that is repetitive all over the Valley when it comes to so-called ""Chicago"" beef sandwiches -- if you order a beef sandwich with sausage (called a combo), the amount of beef in the sandwich is minimal, nothing like Chicago!  In Chicago when you order a combo, besides the sausage, they smother the sandwich with beef piled high.  The bread had no consistency; it was soggy and falling apart.  And, it was shocking to see what Windy City calls giardiniera.  It's nowhere near authentic Chicago giardiniera.  Chicago giardiniera does not have jalapenos and the oregano in it was way too much.  It was spicy and tasteless.  Unbelievable!  As for their pizzas, looking at what the customers were eating reminded me of Tombstone pizzas.  Just saying.

We came in on a Saturday for lunch and they had a steady stream of customers, but we had no problem finding a table. We ordered a pepperoni thin crust, an italian beef, and a side order of fries. All were good. The beef was delicious - lean and plentiful - no fat blobs here! We ordered with cheese, sweet peppers, and giardinera (sp?), which was pretty spicy for medium. I don't think a baby like me could handle the hot. The pizza was a good, solid pie, and the leftovers tasted great the next day, too. I'll have to come back to sample the deep dish. Surprisingly, the fries were very good, sprinkled with some kind of a seasoned salt and plenty crispy.
They have lots of specials, like half price Fridays (I think), 50-cent wing Wednesdays, and a couple other ones I forget.
Prices are definitely reasonable - our pizza, beef, fries, and 2 drinks came to about $26.

4106851,2014-04-06,0,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"My introduction to Italian beef was through the new franchise of Al's Beef over on Sahara and Rainbow. I actually got a little bit of face time on the Yelp Las Vegas home page for that, so I felt the pressure to compare it to this place, which I hadn't tried until today. It helped that I found a Groupon for non-pizza items (so no, this is not at all a pizza review), and I decided to try a few different meats in buns.

First up, the Italian beef (#10). It's in a similar price range to Al's. It seems to be slightly better seasoned and herbed. Unfortunately, it didn't hit the palate quite as hard as Al's did. I think the beef may be a bit better, and the giardiniera looks more authentic and feels that way with the mix of veggies and peppers, but the au jus did not match up to Al's in terms of umami, and I'm thinking the bread may not be as durable. And yes, I got it dipped here as well. Small edge to Al's for just the overall impression.

Second, I had some of the Double Italian Sausage (#12). This is where Windy City Beefs fell flat for me. My comparison this time was to a well known purveyor of foods... which is a Costco food court in Virginia. Yes, they serve an Italian sausage sandwich at Costco on that coast. And yes, I actually would prefer to eat that one again. There was not enough sweetness in the onions and peppers or savoriness in the sausage here, and this one is significantly more pricey.

Finally, I tried a bit of the Polish sausage (#45) with fries. I actually was snacking on the shoestring fries with the other sandwiches, and keeping in mind that taking the fries to-go destroyed the texture (so it's not really the restaurant's fault), I thought the flavor was pretty good. That's all I can really say about that. As for the Polish sausage, it was really good and had so much more flavor than the Italian sausage. Sport peppers weren't actually all that bad for my palate, although they were unexpected. Anyway, this pretty much saved the average.

So, two good options out of three, and maybe future Groupons? I think I could see myself coming back. But I'm still kinda sad that I live way across town from Al's. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,0,4,axrbsiV9aa2Sr-uxO0RB6w

I came in yesterday around noon and Da Bears were playing.  There was a big projector screen and several TVs all showing the game.

I ordered a #10 dipped with medium giardiniera. That is to say an Italian beef sandwich dipped (submerged) in au jus (gravy I believe they call it) with added medium spice pickled vegetables.  I had a craving for one of these sandwiches for months.  It was worth the wait.

When you order a dipped sandwich, it comes out incredibly soggy.  Clearly a result of being dunked like carnival clown in a tank.  It is nearly impossible to eat.  That is if you try to eat it like a regular sandwich.  You will go through napkins like crazy as the juice drips down your arm and all over the table.

It was topped with purple onion and two tomato slices. Could have used some shredded cheese just to make it look more appealing. Husband for the ranch and I got the creamy garlic dressing. They were both good. The garlic dressing was more of the consistency of mayo but it had a good taste. The pizza came out faster than 30 minutes. It was the perfect the perfect temp.

When she finally said something, she was animated and friendly. 

My husband chose the Italian Beef with the spiciest peppers and 'wet'; and I of course chose my 'Chicago dog, 'not' Chicago dog and fries. They came out fairly quickly. The sandwich and the hot dog were both wrapped in paper, and the fries had their own little bag, which was twisted closed. 

The fries were thin, and fairly tasty but were not piping hot. My hot dog tasted like I remember them to be, and the Beef was good. Next time, he said that he would choose to have it dipped rather than just wet. This way it will be nice and messy! Yum.

If you come here for lunch, you can get slices, in the evening hours you can only get a pie. Tuesdays are 50 cent wings and they have pretty good deals other days as well. Be sure to pick up a deal calendar if you intent on coming back. 
Now to the nitty gritty, like I said the deep dish is pretty good. The dough is nice and fluffy and the edges are perfectly crusty. The pizza has chunks of sweet tomatoes and sauce on top, I prefer pizza with rather sweeter sauce so it was great for me. My bf hates to eat tomatoes and I thought he wouldn't like it but he did!

This is an update for a multi meetup event on 1/17/13. If you look at the pics I posted (the ones with the signs that say what each pizza is) you will see an amazing variety of pies. 

The owners Tim and Dakota were very accommodating, they met with our organizers a week prior to discuss the setup and what we expected. Even though they do not have salads on their menu, they went out of their way to provide us with a large tossed salad so we could have it served with our pizzas. Our group had it set up as ""communal style"" so we can try several different pizzas and there is something for everyone. Tim and Dakota set up some tables near the front and set it up buffet style, and brought out a couple different pizzas every 15 or 20 minutes so that the food was hot during the event. 

They had plenty of tables set up for our group of 32+ people, and there was plenty of room to move around and socialize. Their waitstaff was attentive and came over several times during the course of our event to check on us. We went to the counter to order our own beverages. They also allowed us to bring in beer and wine since their liquor license is not in yet. 

Everyone in the group was happy and it was a very fun time, nice atmosphere. Nice flat screens are on the walls and the room is brightly lit. Very positive feedback from all, I did not hear one complaint which is huge (because there is always one in every crowd). 

Here is what we ordered:
Thin Crust: 
Ultimate Veggie (green pepper, onion, mushroom and tomatoes) 
Sausage Classic (sausage, green pepper, mushroom, onion) 
White Pizza (olive oil, ricotta, garlic, tomatoes) 
Cheese 
Pepperoni/Bacon 
Pepperoni

Deep Dish: 
Cheese [note: this was REALLY GOOD!!! Cooked perfectly, gooey cheese, delicious sauce, oh my!!!]
Sausage/Onion 
Meat Special (Sausage, Pepperoni, Ground Beef & Bacon) 
WCBPN Loaded (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers & Black Olives) 
Ground Beef/Mushroom

I have gotten multiple thin crusts here,  and they have always been good. I normally settle with a cheese and a sausage and pepperoni. I wish the cheese had more cheese, but it is still tastey. You can actually taste the sauce, which has good flavor, and the meats that they use have a nice flavor and don't make the pizza greasy like other places.

I tried their cannoli, which was tastey for a Chicago pizza joint. Their regular salad tasted like it was out of a salad bag kit, nothing special, but not necessarily bad either. 

My only gripe is their deep dish. It is more like a Pizza Hut pan pizza, which isn't what you would want when you are expecting Chicago style deep dish. I don't plan on getting it again when I return. Other places in town like Amore Taste of Chicago makes a way better pizza with a legit deep dish crust.

Lots of tables, and they are spread out so you aren't on top of your fellow diners.  Also, the place was clean, from the dining area to the bathrooms to what I could see of the kitchen.  

We had a medium deep dish pizza, which takes about a half hour to cook, so be advised.  We got the meat special (sausage, pepperoni, bacon, beef) and I got some hot giardinera on the side.  This pizza is, in a word, enormous.  We brought it home with us and easily had enough for a second meal.  The crust is flaky and not heavy or doughy.  It definitely contained all of the toppings, which can be an issue with this style of pizza.  The sauce is thick and flavorful, clearly homemade.  The toppings were plentiful and of good quality.  The bacon was probably my favorite, it was thick cut and you get large chunks of it, not tiny chopped up slivers.  It didn't have much heat, so the giardinera was a welcome burst of spice.  

At home, heated in the oven it was just as good if not better than it was the day before.  You may balk at the price, but you get a LOT of food, and it's great quality, AND it heats up well the next day.  You can't beat that in my book.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,1,4,qoiJeo0JJ8nvdqx8HtuWIA

I ordered the # 4 which is the Vienna Chicago Dog and a 3inch Beef Sandwich which I had them dip in the au jus.

I've been hearing a lot about their Deep Dish here...so that's what I ordered!

Chicago Deep Dish : Half Pepperoni / Half Italian Sausage :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-pizza-las-vegas?select=KALsdp8z4anIuvinXKOJJg#KALsdp8z4anIuvinXKOJJg

The crust here is great, buttery, crispy outsides, slightly chewy insides, with a great hearty tomato sauce and tons and tons of cheese hiding inside!  This tasted much better than the ""other"" place on Durango that was highly recommended to me....so good!

But it wasn't all perfect.  The toppings tasted a bit cheap...possibly frozen or store bought?  For all the love I tasted in the crust/sauce/cheese, I expected more.  The pepperoni looked like they came out of a lunchables box, and didn't have much seasoning or flavor and no crispy consistency...soft and chewy.  Sausage was ok, but I have been jaded with other pizza places in town, with home-made house sausage that has a bunch more flavor and spice...this one was hiding in the sauce and didn't make a statement.

But everything else was great, even reheated for leftovers...the true test for great pizza!  I ate pizza for the next two days because the pie was too much!

A bit spendy...I think I spent around $18 for this 12in deep dish.  I don't mind spending good money for great food, so it wasn't a bother...just expect it.

I recommend checking it out!  I just won't be making the 45min drive again anytime soon...or just have to find the right toppings to make a legendary za!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,2,4,3PCavwoWkbOWvAmKiW0FiA

My favorite meal here is the gyros sandwich and I'm a real stickler on this. There are several places to get gyros here in the valley, but if you want the real deal Chicago style gyros this place has it and does it right. They use real shaved off the spit gyro meat on a lightly grilled pita with onions, tomato, and tzatziki sauce- and that's it! No lettuce, olives, feta cheese, weird herbs, or funky dressings like some other places serve it. At last I've found a decent gyro in Vegas!

5272727,2017-04-27,1,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"To preface this review, please keep in mind everyone has different thoughts about what Chicago style pizza is. This review is based on what the majority of Chicagoans consider Chicago Style. First time trying pizza here. I love Chicago style. 5 stars for flavor and service on the phone. Minus 2 stars for the make up of the pizza. I do not consider this true Chicago style. Chicago style is not about how much cheese you can put in it. The cheese and sauce should be about equal. The sauce should have tomatoes that you actually may have to brush off of the top of the pizza. My pizza from here was overloaded with cheese. Very good but, not enough sauce to go with it. The depth was lower than expected. They make it look good due to the cheese pulling away from the rest of the pizza. A good show but, the make up of the pizza was poor. Flavor gets 5 stars. Very flavorful. Girl on the phone was Haley. She was fantastic!! Very nice. Very sweet. Very helpful. Also, their menu shows the largest deep dish pizza is 14 inches. Says on menu 21.50. That is until you put toppings on. I had 4 toppings plus Giardiniera and it was over 31.00. They should have prices on that page for toppings and should also say 21.50. Toppings extra !
I am guessing they have pizzas with certain toppings already added but, guess I did not look around the menu enough to find them. Overall it was a decent experience. I will continue to look for good Chicago style pizza here around Vegas /Henderson. This one was tasty, just not TRUE Chicago. Eating true Chicago style involves one of two things; a slice held in hand should be a mess or you put it on a plate and use a utensil. This can be held in the hand and eaten like any other pizza. And the crust should not be quite as thick as this one was. But, still was very good. In a pinch I may grab another from here.

5769829,2018-07-01,0,dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g,"The deep dish pizza here is a serious letdown.  

The last time I was in Chicago I tried a deep dish I didn't like after taking a bad recommendation.  After seeing all the highly rated reviews from people from Chicago I was seriously excited to try this place.     

Here's why I didn't like the pizza:
-it wasn't hot when it came to us
-the dough tasted generic and store bought; it was simultaneously hard and soggy and not in the good way
-the tomatoes on top were flavorless 
-even with sausage and peppers, the whole thing was bland and flavorless

I will say that it had a good amount of good mozzarella.  It didn't taste like the cheap waxy stuff.

I wasn't sure I liked the service here either.  I came up to the register to place my order and I don't know...  I just didn't feel welcome.  You should want me to order multiple items and not keep cutting me off before I can.  I mean she wasn't rude but she also wasn't friendly or helpful.  If the menu says ""creamy garlic Italian"" dressing I say I want that one and you tell me you don't have Italian but I ask what is the creamy garlic Italian and you say it's creamy garlic... that doesn't help me.  In case any of you Yelpers want to know it's basically garlic mayonnaise (taste and consistency).",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,2,zF-dqYVNmLYq_CG3NuDTlA

Each time I have called in to-go orders for several of their deep dish pizzas for my family before hitting the road to Cali. They keep very well in a hot/cold bag during the trek home and heats up just fine in the oven. 

I've never been to Chicago but these are the best damn deep dish pies I've ever had. My usual is the WCBNP Loaded deep dish which comes with: Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, black olives & giardinera peppers (hot or medium). I get two pies, one with the hot giardinera peppers and one with the medium. The hot isn't super spicy but it has more kick than the medium ones and come with less green bell peppers. I believe you can also buy jars of their peppers at the front counter as well.

The restaurant is located in a large strip mall on S.Eastern Ave and Silverado Ranch Blvd, so finding exactly where it is could be a minor challenge.  But that also meant there are plenty of parking to go around when you go.

By the time I arrived after going to WCBNP straight from work, the chicken wings were already at the table and the group was waiting for the Chi-Town deep dish pizza (which of course took longer to bake).  The wings were really good (I am not even sure what flavor wings were ordered, but that was the highlight for me.

The deep dish pizza that was brought to our table was big.  Really big.  Not sure if I could even finish it all if I was given two meals to attempt to eat it all solo.  The pizza is cut up into squares, so it is messy work eating the middle pieces.  Fork, spoon, spork, offset spatula would all be very helpful in eating this as cleanly as possible.  Having plenty of napkins to mop up the delicious oils on your hand afterward will help too.

Price was really affordable.  With our small group it was like $5 a person for the wings and pizza.  Can't beat that!

I can't see myself coming here solo to have pizza, but the wings are well worth the drive to this east side pizzeria.  Especially on Tuesdays with their $0.50 wings promo with a minimum order of 6.
