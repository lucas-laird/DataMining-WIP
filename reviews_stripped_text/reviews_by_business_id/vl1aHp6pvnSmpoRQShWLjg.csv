Hostess staff attempting to use the southern drawl ..""Ya'll""... Just stop, this is Vegas, act like it and quit the stupidity.  The waiter also did another annoying throwback to Olive Garden and other large chain restaurants by squatting at our table to take our order.  I hate nothing more than trifle attempts at a larger tip thinking that such actions are welcomed.  Just take my order and take it well, do a good job is all I ask. Annoyance level - High.

I ordered the Hawaiian Mojito and my husband ordered the Dixie Sweet Tea.  These were the only reason that this review warranted the single star.  

We ordered the fried Okra, which obviously is a pre-packaged item that is simply dropped in the fryer at the time of ordering and not made fresh.  We did not mind so much, because it was not entirely bad.  

For our entrees my husband ordered the Po'Boy and I the Steak Sandwich.  His Po'Boy was overkilled by the bread, the catfish nuggets had no seasoning, the sauce on the sandwich had no flavor and the mac and cheese side was simply macaroni with cheese melted on top with no flavor.  My steak sandwich was completely overloaded with the peppers and onions and greens, the meat was extremely tough for supposedly being marinated the night before.  The Chiabata bread had to have been at least day old or older as it was hard as a rock and impossible to bite into.  I finally tried cutting the bread with the steak knife provided and the bread crumbled... The Baked Beans were edible.  The meat was inedible and my dog will be the only one to actually enjoy this meal. Of course, only after I take the meat and rinse and soak it before sharing with her. 

I could not get out of there fast enough out of fear of being sick from what I actually consumed of the meal. It is really sad, because we did enjoy the atmosphere.  This was a waste of money and not anywhere worth the price point.  We will not return, nor recommend to anyone. Nice touch at leaving was that tootsie roll pops were given in substitution of mints at the door. Do not waste your time or money at this place and save your stomach.",hoGdbFFWXKPbLTdOscBJ1g,2,0,1,wBYxDkbRLizb48k5zzifvg
60480,2015-01-05,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"I really hate having to write a bad review, but my visit to this location warrants this.

First, I'll talk about the food. Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything ""well done"" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.

Service - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service. 

Most likely won't be back. I tried the Green Valley location a few years ago and enjoyed it, but this one wasn't up to par unfortunately",Ys4rHDpli-IcVXSyspTpmQ,1,0,1,PG5S2s1vek5BXAAdY-A2og

There was an older couple that sat next to us and they constantly bickered back and forth and still she remained calmed, smiled and served the couple. She was really a sweet heart, she's a keeper. My husband and I ordered the deep fried shrimp appetizer. It was so good we ordered another one to come WITH our meal. It was perfectly seasoned and the jalape√±o tartar sauce was to die for. I also ordered the back porch entree which was loaded w/ a half bbq chicken, tri trip, your choice of ribs and 2 sides. The meat was seasoned, tender and cooked to perfection. The sides were ok, and truth be told I don't buy a meal for the sides so I was fine. It was so much food you really get your money's worth. My husband ordered the catfish and shrimp which was an absolute delight. I would suggest to use the same breading as the deep fried shrimp appetizer, it's a winner!

The customer service was pretty good as well. The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars is because it was really hot in the restaurant and they didn't have a bathroom.

139471,2014-05-25,1,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"I had high hopes for Lucille's BBQ at Red Rock Casino based on other Yelp reviews. 

Things started out quite well.  I was lucky enough to score a table quickly (less than 5 minute wait) on a Saturday night.  The server came by promptly to provide menus and get our drinks orders.  She came back quickly with our drinks and was ready to take our food orders. We hadn't had much time to look through the menus but we had some meals in mind so gave her our orders.

Turns out this would be the theme of the night - service was too fast. Not something you usually want to complain about but we felt that we were rushed out.

I had ordered  a salad to come before the meal. They brought the complimentary biscuits and the salad almost instantly. I managed to eat two forkfuls of salad before the main meal came out.  So I had to set aside the salad to eat the meal while it was warm (shame it was not hot).  I had only eaten half my meal when the server came by to see if we were ready for dessert.  We said no (as might be obvious from our half-finished plates)  - at which point she left the bill and took off.  

Overall the food was just fine - though not the best bbq I've had.  However, the service and meal timing was way off - which left a less than enjoyable dining experience.  Perhaps this was just a fluke so I woiuld be willing to try Lucille's again but I'm in no hurry to repeat that dining experience.",VNmQ12LYwG16HAspOp7WeQ,1,0,2,1W9d9Yr-8IW08uTElxDQyA

The atmosphere is better. 

The garlic mash actually IS garlic mash. I didn't receive rock hard biscuits, but piping hot ones which was nice for a change. I still prefer the biscuits I was originally introduced to in 2006, this newer version is lacking but at least what I was served last night was hot & fresh.

Starting with a mix-up at the hostess station, and continuing through a server who went on break as soon as we were seated, and ending in forgotten parts of the order ... The service wasn't up to the higher standard set by the green valley location.

The food was good enough, but hard to judge fairly through the lense of a bad experience.

265673,2016-07-04,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"TL:DR crowd - served MOLDY grilled cheese, sub par service and still paid for 70% even though everyone lost their appetites and didn't eat half their food.

We've been to the GVR location of Lucille's before and had a lovely time with great food and fantastic service. 

No brainer when we wanted a great place to go for a birthday!

The Red Rock Casino Lucille's was much closer to where we are staying this time, so we chose that location. 

We called about 2 hours in advance for an 8:30 seating for 8 people. We were seated around 8:45. We watched them clean the tables and then stay empty 5 minutes so we begged them to seat us as the 3 younger kids were taking up space in the super small indoor entrance and causing some traffic flow issues. 

The waiter took our order about 10 minutes later. Drinks arrived and our shoestring onions (tasty!!) arrived 15 minutes after that. 

Our food trailed in 20 minutes later in shifts. We got 3 plates (and a salad that was an appetizer added to a meal) and then a few minutes later, 4 more trickled in. The birthday girl was last to receive her food a good 5 minutes after the rest of us. 

She had only taken a few bites when we realized one of the kids was chowing down on a MOLDY grilled cheese sandwich. 

We asked the bartender for a manager. She took 10 minutes to arrive. She listened to us then said she wanted to take the bread back to have the kitchen manager check it. Five or so minutes later, she came back stating she gave us a sizable discount and took the kid's grilled cheese off. 

The birthday girl ate two bites and the rest of us had half the food on their plates and didn't want to eat another bite. 30% off. Our bill went from around $160 to $99 and we have 8 people half full and one very angry kid who got a sandwich taken away from him. (The manager did not show us a receipt or tell us an amount. She had the waiter deliver it a few minutes later and we never saw her again.)

Subpar service and terrible quality control. Don't know if we will return because that thought will always be lingering.

We went to this location on their opening day, there was barely anyone in the restaurant around 11:00 AM, yet it took an hour to receive our food.  When we did finally get the food, there were lipstick prints on my friend's glass (none of us wore lipstick), which was absolutely gross.  The waiter was nonchalant, when he took the time to actually check on us. 

When we advised the manager of everything that occurred, she apologized and stated that they don't hand wash the glasses.  I've been to a number of restaurants that have dishwashers and I've never had fresh lip prints on my glass.

Watermelon margarita with a float of ginger beer -- they didn't skimp on the alcohol, but it seemed they left out the watermelon.  The only thing we tasted was ginger beer.  Appetizer of BBQ Shrimp -- shrimp were good, and it would be great if you wanted shrimp in spaghetti sauce.  Not my idea of BBQ.  BBQ baked beans -- blah, no real flavor.  Sweet potato fries -- too much cajun seasoning, would have been better with just a sprinkle of regular salt.  Cole slaw was very good.

I like that they have live band.

Food:
The biscuits and apple butter are 'the bomb'. Don't forget to ask for it lest they forget. 

The mojito is sweet and minty. Very good.

We ordered the beef ribs: good and smokey but fatty. Tri tips were tender and delicious, highly recommended. We ordered roasted peanut slaw which complemented the BBQ, and some veggies as well. I advise to skip the salad, very ordinary and expensive for extra $5.99. 

The bread pudding is huge, and one of the better ones I've tasted. It will be dry without the sauce, which was very yummy by the way with a hint of orange zest and nutty flavor. 

Service is slow, food took a while to be served, it's a good thing there's a live band.

My wife ordered a pulled brisket sandwich and she said it tasted way too sweet and sugary . Oh and by the way they serve you rocks (biscuits) with a sugar butter. Tasted like I took a spoon and took a bite of pure flour. The mac n cheese looked like mashed potatoes and was very mushy. The mashed potatoes tasted way too garlicy.

And yes, I have been to Salt Lick when it was at the Red Rock and was not a fan. Although, I hear the original in TX is much better.  One of the reasons I like Lucille's is that they have beef ribs, which is not always plentiful at other restaurants.  A few years ago I went on a BBQ adventure of sorts and drove around Texas and the south trying to hunt down the best BBQ. And while Lucille's is not authentic in that it is smothered and basted in BBQ sauce, I still like it.  The sauce is a little sweet, and they have memphis, original and spicy sauce bottles on each table for more.  The portions are large and the sides are tasty. Last night we had the baked beans which had large pieces of pork in them and the cheesy grits - I love the grits. They remind me of the cheese grits I had when I was first introduced to cheese grits in South Carolina. Also, their iced tea is fresh brewed and they provide biscuits with a sprinkle of sugar on top and apple butter upon request.

1006622,2013-08-31,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,I stopped by to check out the new Lucille's for happy hour.  They are still going through some opening pains that caused the service to be below expectations.  Hopefully the service will improve as the staff gains more experience.  The highlight was the wedge salad - delicious with the crispy smoked bacon bits.  The Irish nachos (French fries with cheese) were tasty but got soggy as they cooled off.  The fried green tomatoes were good but the batter broke off of the tomatoes when cut.  The rib tips  and sausage were well prepared but in general I find Lucille's BBQ sauce too sweet for my taste. I also didn't really care for the biscuits with sugar on top.  Finally the happy hour drink choices: They have a good selection of Skky Vodka martinis but I found their happy hour beer selections limited primarily to their house brews.,iU7aLjrEtD4U7PudC95vcg,0,0,3,LYyyuMf8F_Norm1VI8Kjlw

1059409,2015-01-19,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"The darling Orchid had a taste for barbecue chicken last night.  So, with the help of Yelp, I find Lucille's.  I made a reservation on their web site, but never got the confirmation text the web site said I'd get.  Nonetheless, off to Lucille's we go.  We get there, and a fellow at the desk (named ""Abel,"" if I remember correctly) found our reservation in his computer, even though his computer said we left no phone number.  He said he'd bring that up in their next meeting for Corporate webmaster.  (And a few bonus points for a ""we'll fix it"" before I could even say, ""I think it's broken."")

Having never been in there before, it was a learning experience.  Our waiter, a very pleasant fellow named ""John,"" was patient with us as we asked questions from all over the map, trying to get a feel for the place.  The Orchid ordered a half-chicken-plus-two-meats (rib tips and pulled pork) with cole slaw, roasted garlic mashed potatoes and BBQ beans. (Platter comes with two; we paid a couple bucks extra for three.)  I ordered the same chicken-plus-two, with sausage and burnt ends, and mac-n-cheese and cheesy grits.  The burnt ends weren't really ""burnt,"" but they were good.  The sausage was a classic Louisiana hot link; not bad, but I have never been a fan of the texture.  Learning experience; I'll know better for next time.  The Orchid loved everything on her plate.

John, and the entire crew, all looked as though they liked their jobs, and they all seemed to have two speeds: ""fast"" and ""ZOOM-what-was-that?"".

All in all, a very enjoyable experience, albeit one that we won't indulge in frequently (the food is worth what you're paying, but you do pay handsomely). Well done.

1129773,2016-07-14,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Quiet and with a sense of southern backyard charm, I was pleasantly surprised the people-thirtsy Lucille's had such tasty food. Although on the expensive side, I thought of this BBQ joint similar to Olive Garden with its Italian food: affordable and fancy, but not gourmet.

You are offered their complimentary biscuits and cinnamon butter. I was not a fan of said butter. It made the already sweet biscuits sweeter. If you have children with an appetite, please, allow them to indulge at least. My waitress was gracious and efficient, quickly offering me my drink options ($3 for the largest Mason jar you've ever seen! Reminded me of Memphis, TN BBQ). No complaints there. It was after I ordered my food that it seemed to take ages for it to arrive. I felt the staff may have lost my request and kept anxiously glancing over towards the kitchen.

When you start running out of conversational topics, biscuit to stuff your face with AND you pull out your phone to start watching the latest episode of a series you're into, you know the wait was bad.

Lucille's smokes their meat in-house in a smoker right smack in the middle of the floor. My waitress was kind enough to inform me that I would taste the gaseous fumes, which I expected. Overall, the food was delicious and filling. Not only was everything fresh and well thought out, warm towels were brought out to satisfactorily clean my hands. Definitely beats the moist towelettes you get at other establishments.

1136613,2015-02-19,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"After leaving my last review on Lucille's, I was almost immediately contacted by Brad (Owner) who assured me that the less than spectacular visit we had was not the norm and he encouraged us to give them another try.  Well we did and this visit was a far better experience than our first, but not perfect.  We arrived and found it to be quite busy which was no big deal since we were told it would only be about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  The hit this mark right on the money, but our seat would not have been our first choice, it was right by the kitchen which meant we got to deal with the traffic of servers during our meal.  It would have been nice if they asked if this was satisfactory, I would have gladly waited a few more minutes for a better table.  We were both hungry so we dealt with it.

Now for the food.  We thought it would be best if we ordered at least some of the food we had the first time.  My wife went with the brisket which like the first time was tender but did not have the smoky flavor one looks for when eating barbecue and again the potato was on the small side. Overall it was good, but not great.

I went with the burnt ends and tri-tip.  The tri-tip was again outstanding and very flavorful.  The burnt ends were far better than the first time.  They were still cut small, but this time were very tender and a joy to eat.  They, like the brisket, could have used a bit more smoke.

This visit was far more enjoyable than our first visit.  I still think they are a bit overpriced especially since there are other barbecue joints in town who's food is as good at a much better price.  Would we return?  Probably.",9qGOxS9tFI6M7QwG4JjYuQ,1,0,4,Kw-eCX-ewlePionjd1d0MQ

When dining at the Red Rock resort it is nice to have so many options that are family friendly. It was our first time dining at this establishment but have had plenty of positive experiences at many other Lucille's restaurants in SoCal. This was not as good when compared to the others. 

I wanted to give a 1 star for the overall experience but went with a 2 star because, Roberto our server was very kind and checked on us a few times but the negative experience has more to do with the wait time. Initially I walked down from my room to scope it out because if you have been to a Lucille's on a Saturday evening you may experience a long wait to be seated. I walked to the reception desk and the place was about half full. The receptionist said they had plenty of seats available. What? I said to myself, that's great for us. Had the family come join me and we were seated immediately. That's when we notice something was wrong. They sat us next to a party of about 25 people in a small table next to the waiter's computer/serving station. Okay, family of 4, small table in an uncomfortable location with plenty of open booths around. Then I thought they saved those for bigger parties but no. They were sitting couples in the oversized booths. I should have spoken up but we were hungry and wanted food. 

Ordered drinks right away, took a few minutes for them to arrive. I like ordering the tall Guinness, it's a good deal plus better on calories, slightly. Then the wait started. It took another good 10 minutes before the rolls showed up, I usually stay away from the rolls but my family likes them. 

It was another 10 minutes before we placed our order. Simple, Lucille's grilled chicken salad for me, wife had the half chicken, kids both wanted the penne pasta from kids menu. I figured wouldn't take that long because majority of their meats are smoked and it should be prepared. Wrong! It took another 25 minutes before our food arrived. What upset me even more was they brought out 3 meals first and took another 5 minutes to bring my son his kids meal. Server said they had to make more pasta. All I am saying here is have some common sense or decency. Bring the kids their food first. My son is 7 but he was a little bothered by it. I understand this is a small life lesson that I could give him but this wasn't the venue for it. Roberto apologized and said they were busy because people were having holiday parties and they had 2 big groups at same time. Okay, that's not my problem but you are making it my problem because of the long wait time. Parties are usually planned out and the party more than likely gave an advanced notice to the restaurant and the management team either thought they could handle it, did not schedule proper staff, or staff members called in sick and left the burden on their peers. 

My family finished their food and left. I remained seated to finish my second beer and to pay. The food was good. It was what one would expect at any Lucille's. The negative was the absurd wait time. There are plenty of restaurants in the resort and a few within walking distance in downtown Summerlin to choose from. Maybe lady luck will be on your side but this particular night I crapped out with the pick. Probably won't dine here again. Good luck and happy eating!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,8,3,2,V1uWF7AMvrwvOCr3QyQrag

1406453,2013-09-01,1,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"This opinion may change when I give this place a second chance but for now here is how I feel.....I was really excited to try this place as I've been to their location in Southern California and loved my experience there so I did have high expectations for tonight.

When we first walked in the hostess informed us that ""it's a 20-30 minute wait"". We ask if we can eat at the bar and her reply was ""um yeah but last I checked it was full"" so we give her our name as we preferred a table but found a few seats at the bar. Then, as soon as we sit down at the bar, my mom gets the ""text message"" that our table was ready. This was my first sign that this restaurant hired an idiot for a hostess since that was only 5 minutes not 20. We went along and ended up at a table in the loudest part of the restaurant, that was a second sign that I was not going to enjoy this visit.

Then a random employee not sure what her position was but she took our drink orders and our server appeared right as she brought them to our table. She weirdly confirmed our drinks and then walked away and then finally came back a few minutes later to actually take our order. I found it very odd that when I told her I wanted the ""Smoked Chicken Pasta"" she had to confirm that was a real item on the menu, but then again their menu is large.

So then we waited with our two complimentary biscuits and waited and waited and about 45 minutes later we finally got our food! My mom ordered the Original Pulled Pork Sandwich but for some reason they gave her the Memphis which has cole slaw, but since we were both starving she didn't care and ate it anyway. 

Now, when I read the menu I read the description as ""pepper"" not ""peppers"" so I didn't realize my food came with ""bell peppers"" which I am not a fan of. I tried to eat the dish instead of send it back but every bite became more and more disgusting and I just felt unsatisfied knowing that this dish was going to be $13.49 and I had to wait 45 minutes for it and it didn't even taste good to me since I dislike bell peppers and it was covered in them.

We let the waitress know that I was not a fan and reminded her that we were trying to make a movie that started in 20 minutes and after 15 minutes the manager finally arrived at our table. I spoke with him and he did the usual, ""oh we are sorry but is there anything else I can make for you"" but what upset me the most was when I mentioned how long it took he became defensive and just babbled until I reminded him that we were going to be late for our movie. He finally shut up and comped both our dishes so we ended up just paying for our drinks and I left a decent tip to be nice.

I'll give this place a second chance, but it won't be on a Saturday Night before a movie. At least all I missed were the previews.....",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,4,2,2,Ogz7qXJxhcCFSsLm_sb52w

My father and I went in for a 2 for 1 special. We were in for a treat. We both exchanged a  bit of witty banter and small talk with the server and the bartender. Super friendly, and great service.

We started with some beer samples. The lucielle ipa was nice, bitter, and sour. The hefeweizen had a nice aroma as well as a sour note at the end of the sip. My favorite, though, was the red ale: lightly sweet at the front and hoppy at the back with a nice mouthfeel. It went great with my meat orders. My dad and I shared a total of 6 meats. The pulled pork was tender, but had just a bit too much bite. The rib tips had a nice flavor and texture. The chicken was juicy and sweet. The baby back ribs were tender and sweet, though I wish it fell off the bone a bit more. The big beef rib was great: soft, crunchy outside, soft inside. The tri-tip was so tender, I didn't even need to cut it. The biscuit and the apple butter was sweet and salty like a caramel. The slaw, while a bit heavy, but cleaned my palate nicely with the beer. The slaw was also sweet, tangy, and light. Not to mention, all of this came out in a timely manner... it was like we looked away, and our food came.

Honestly came in because I needed more protein and fat macros. Left super satisfied. Will eat again.",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,0,0,4,mrl7k7hKguWtk0f7gqcfkg

Staff was awesome...extremely attentive and friendly. Was seated and waited on promptly.

Went with the lunch BBQ platter, which includes three meats. Chose a hot link, beef tri-tip, and baby back ribs.

The sausage was absolutely off the hook...spicy and succulent. One of the best I have ever had.

The tri-tip was excellent as well: perfectly cooked, sliced, and the dipping sauce was delicious.

The baby back ribs were a major disappointment. Overcooked, dry, and stringy. The local pitmaster really needs to be more attentive to this...when a restaurant identifies itself as a BBQ, ribs need to be cooked competently.

Not sure whether I like the sugar dusted biscuits...tasty, but I'm more of a cornbread guy. Mac and cheese side was absolutely solid...not the best I've had, but a solid four stars in any foodies book.

No room for desert this time...will try again in a couple of weeks and focus on all three styles of ribs offered to see if the pitmaster gets his 'Q act together.

===================================================

Second visit. One week later.

Had the three meat combo again, this time with St. Louis ribs, 1/4 chicken and another off-the-hook hot link. The ribs were very good...smoked just right. The chicken was fine, but nothing exceptional. Link was just as good as the first I had.
Baked been side was a bit on the sweet side...a little more kick would have balanced it out perfectly.

Had the banana pudding to top things off...in a word, WONDERFUL.

One weird thing. Sat at a table by the bar...when the A/C kicked in you could feel the floor vibrate. Odd, but I can live with it. Going back in a few days to give the baby backs another chance.",qRia8y6bjvdoZHCmNpAeIQ,2,0,4,zxF4pRKwXr5T2KypZAHN9A

1479629,2015-07-09,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"This is a great restaurant that offers a variety of my scrumptious BBQ favorites! The portions are fair for the price. The sides (e.g., baked beans, corn bread) are delicious. The warm biscuits with sweet apple butter spread is divine. My favorite meal is the baby back ribs. The meat literally falls of the bone. They have many in-house drink creations and specials. I love the design of the restaurant with an entrance from inside or outside of the casino. 

I have to admit though, I know when to patronize this restaurant. If you don't, you might not have the same feelings about the atmosphere or menu as I. It only took a couple visits to figure out that the restaurant cannot handle large groups or an overly busy night without falling apart at the seams. The food quality goes down. The service goes down. The hostesses stop smiling. You become a number. 

I hear some patrons say - ""I pay no mind to service - just the food."" But, you really do and apparently don't give service credit for your overall experience. When you can't get a refill on your drink, your biscuits are cold and hard, your ribs are cold and chewy, and you go to pay your check at the end - service did matter. Service is intricately woven into everything part of a restaurant - or it becomes just another forgettable restaurant. 

So, I love Lucille's - but, I visit them during non-peak times. 

Last word for my older generation patrons that may want to visit Lucille's. They use your phone number at the hostess stand to text you when your table is being prepared & ready. I know... my grandfather said the same thing - ""What if I don't have a cell with text messaging?"" I think often times, business' forget about our older generation that may or may not be tech or text savvy. So, for those of you for whom this applies... you'll have to stick very close to the hostess station. They do not have a blinking rib notifier.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,4,1,3,FdG__syhudg9HDeGXGCRJQ

However, I must say I prefer their Henderson location over the Red Rock Casino location due to their food preparation and customer service management. The staff at the Henderson location seem more attentive and efficient in my experience.

In any restaurant, especially barbecue, I always consider the time of day when dining in to get the freshest batch of succulent bbq ribs when made fresh. This location for me is hit or miss with their beef ribs. I am a ""moo"" rather than an ""oink"" kinda gal :) They are sometimes tender and juicy and other visits some parts of the beef ribs are not so edible friendly. However, both St. Louis and baby back ribs are always tender and flavorful. I prefer the flavor of the St. Louis ribs over the baby back ribs!

What I like about the ribs at Lucille's is that they are not too smokey for my palate compare to other local favorite bbq places around town. They offer lots of southern style sides that are delicious! Lucille's has 3 signature sauces on the tables in which the original sauce is easily my pick! They also have refreshing fruit flavored lemonade garnished with fresh fruits! Some may think prices here are overpriced, but portions are decent and some overwhelmingly huge which makes Lucille's a great place for sharing. This is my family's favorite place for BBQ.

My other review mentions things like the quality of the meats, the sugar content of the everything, and the ever-presence of high fructose corn syrup. None of this has changed, and the food is still just ""A-OK"", as Yelp calls it. Not special, not outstanding, but also not bad and if you know what you're in for you will get exactly what you expect.

The difference in this review comes down to the building itself, the staff, and the bar.

First, the building seems either much larger or just better laid out. It isn't a great layout, but it *is* better than the one in The District in my opinion. There seems to be just more space, even if that space seems awkwardly placed.

Second, the staff at this particular one seems more friendly, happier to be at work. Maybe it's because they are a new place and none of the employees have become jaded corporate worker drones yet. Who knows?

Third, the bar. They mix the drinks stronger. It's as simple as that. Everything I've ordered at the one in The District has been delicious. Everything I've ordered at this one has been strong, tasted like mildly flavored booze instead of a mixed drink where the alcohol fades into the overall flavor. For some people that may be great, but I don't like the taste of well-quality alcohol and having it in the background of an otherwise delicious drink was a welcoming way to get a good night started.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,3,idgWfCaC4zLULmTkyPtfEg

NOT a fan of the thanksgiving dinner this year. The quality of food was not the same as last year. The turkey and ham was very fatty and extremely chewy. The sweet potatoes had sooooo many fibers in them it was like every bite had ""hair"" in it. You would get a mouthful of fibers and chunks having to literally pull them out of your mouth bite by bite. They were not smooth at all. Super gross feeling of eating hair. The stuffing was very spicy. So much that the kids couldn't even eat it. And that is their favorite part! The mashed potatoes had chewy bites of bacon in them or something and even gritty like the potatoes were not properly cleaned. They were chunky and not smooth texture that you expect in mashed potatoes. I am so disappointed. I don't think we will be ordering from here next year. 


Thanksgiving dinner 2015

We pre ordered the Thanksgiving dinner ""holiday family feast with all the fixins"" and picked it up a day prior to Thanksgiving. It came cold and it took only an hour to heat it all up in the oven. It came with 3lbs ham, 3lbs turkey, and all the fixins' for $159. It was packed neatly in a huge box. The food is really good quality, amazing! The ham and turkey is flavored with smoke and comes with extra sauce/gravy to top with. There is so much food, enough to feed 8-10 people. The to go service was excellent. My only complaint is the ham was sweet, there is a sweet potato souffl√©, sweet potato pie, house biscuits topped with sugar and a apple butter sweet spread, and with the cranberry sauce it was a lot of sweetness that I would prefer regular butter rolls.

We ordered our drinks, It was so tight the wait staff couldn't even serve water to us. While we were waiting for our beer and appetizers, (We never received the complimentary biscuits) I asked the hostess if we could be moved to another larger table, they seemed very put out and they let me know that it was disruptive to the staff. They had to change servers since the new table was 6 ft away. After moving and waiting 15 (yes fifteen) I asked the server if we could please get our beer, and the lemon we had asked for our water. I also reminded her about the biscuits. I was told they were coming. Another server brought us our appetizer, sat it on the table and walked away. Were we supposed to eat off of the table? So we waited until someone came by, I asked for plates and again asked for our beer and lemon. We were brought out salads, that was messed up too. By that time, we gave up on the biscuits. I excused myself and asked to speak to the manager. I expressed my concerns, he apologized and said he would stop by the table. We finished our dinner, apologized to the server for being apparently so difficult. Before leaving I asked for the biscuits we should've received at the beginning of our meal to go. The manager NEVER came by to say anything to my family. There were so many other instances of poor service, from refills, to us not being offered additional plates for the kids, no warm towels offered at the end of our meal, on and on. Very disappointed in this particular restaurant, but I still reluctantly tipped the server a minimum 15% gratuity. I won't be back. Ever.

Ordered sweet tea which comes in these big mason jar glasses, they are HUGE and delicious.   

Ordered Fried green tomatoes, I have always wanted to but my friend Polly said that they would be gross but I didnt want to leave the restaurant without a taste so I ordered them and the sausage trio, I didnt care as much for the sausage but thats just I believe because I am slowly switching around my eating habits--The friend green tomatoes were good but I dont know that I would order them again...

Polly ordered a full rack of ribs and she said they were amazing, Susan ordered Half chicken w/2 meats and she loved that and I had Texas brisket w/garlic potatoes, cheesy grits and that was amazing...

Dessert was banana pudding for me which was good...Not spectacular as advertised but alright, Susan ordered snickers pie which was delicious and Yep they brought out a slice of chocolate cake for Polly with a candle, I was super happy and impressed.

1757310,2014-05-27,1,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Growing up in Texas, I'm a pretty hard customer to please when it comes to barbecue. Lucille's did not do it for me, but with limited options in Vegas, I wouldn't completely write them off.

Opted for quite a variety of menu options, don't know that I'd highly suggest any of them. Definitely consider starting with an alcoholic beverage, the house margarita was tasty- I forget it's clever name though.

Complimentary BISCUITS upon seating- topped with cinnamon sugar why? Would be so much better unseasoned with regular butter, as others have said.
BRISKET CHILI- large portion, tasty, but brisket isn't as flavorful as I'd like. Adding cheese and sour cream kind of covers up some of the flavor. Cornbread is sweet, which isn't my preference.
PULLED PORK SANDWICH- large and juicy, top bun is disposable as there's nothing on it and the bun is quite large. Not really a sandwich you can easily pick up to eat. Served with fresh-made chips, which were actually quite delicious. 
TRI SALAD- salad topped with tri-tip and grilled veggies, gigantic in size and fresh. Worth a try if you're on a salad or health-centric kick, the meat is a good portion and isn't dry, which still makes it enjoyable for a steak at a bbq joint.
CHICKEN QUESADILLA AND GRILLED ARTICHOKE- had high hopes for this meal made of two half-size entrees, but was underwhelmed. Barbecue chicken in the quesadilla isn't particularly flavorful, despite simply being accompanied by grilled peppers and onions. LIghtly topped with a mostly-decorative design of red pepper sauce and barbecue sauce, this simply had too much going on and the chicken seemed bland, easily overpowered by everything else in the dish. Artichoke was artfully presented but a little difficult to eat, all but diehard artichoke fans need not apply.

Layout is a little odd, with a street entrance and a casino entrance- on a weekend afternoon, signage at the front of the latter instructed us to go through the restaurant to the other side of the bar to the other hostess stand for seating. Having never been there before, it was difficult to find and we basically wandered the dining room until we turned the corner making the stand itself visible. Not such a great plan- maybe have staff on the lookout to escort guests to the right place.

Service was fairly attentive despite a shift change during our meal, bonus points for the classic Ball canning jars used as water glasses. We were seated facing the bar, which has three TV screens above it, someone please change the middle TV from cartoons- bizarre choice of programming as this isn't really a child-friendly place.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,aaQ88QHXHPPSD9dnqKHkLQ

Three word review: Meh, at best.


I was pretty excited to try this place- obviously I had my initial ""BBQ in Vegas?"" skepticism, but then it seemed to get a lot of positive reviews on yelp. I live close to the Red Rock so having a good BBQ joint in the neighborhood would of been pretty awesome. 

We arrived around 6pm and the place was pretty empty- not a good sign since the Red Rock itself was pretty packed. Despite being nearly empty it still took about 10 minutes to get a table as the 3 staff working the door discussed the conundrum of where to sit us over their headsets with the mothership. It was another 10 minutes before someone took our order. 

Wanting to try a bunch of stuff we decided to get the App sampler which includes sweet potato fries, fried pickles, rib tips, okra, chicken tender, some sort of southern egg roll, sausage link, and some other unidentifiable food stuffs. It was all about the quality you would expect from making the same items at home in 1 oven at the same time by just guessing at what temperature would best suit all items. Sweet potato fries were mushy, fried pickles were tough, rib tips had bones in them and were tough, sausage was cold. Overall very dissapointing.

I also ordered the Brisket chili which was on the special menu- figuring after the app platter I wouldn't be able to tackle a whole rack of ribs, perhaps an error I admit. The chili was just very bland and only lukewarm. The cornbread that came with it was very dry. 

Throughout the meal service was slow, and despite the jars they bring the water in being enormous I was frequently without a drink which is a pet peeve. for 24 dollars a person it was on the expensive side for BBQ, with low quality.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,10,5,2,9hd3An1KLwzbEkuAUYq43Q

2206229,2016-06-25,4,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"The Skinny: The food is okay but definitely not special at all - pretty generic actually (3) service: generally good for lunch (3) value: kind of pricey for the quality unless you have a discount (2.5 starred review).

I was introduced to Lucille's BBQ by the hubs. The first time was the location in Henderson which was pretty delish. However over time, the quality of the food definitely degraded to the point that we didn't go anymore.

Enter in the Summerlin branch at Red Rock Casino. As a local, Red Rock periodically sends out coupons to entice you to come visit them. We couldn't resist the BOGO lunch entree coupon so we went twice to check it out.

The biscuits taste a little bit like Bisquick biscuits. But when they are served hot, it is a guilty pleasure all the same.

I would say for their lunch entrees get the BBQ lunch platter ($17ish). Just note, the portions were not very generous for the price. In general, the BBQ meats tasted kind of generic with not enough smoke to the meat. Hence, all the multiple bottles of bbq sauce on the table. It's to cover the relatively bland flavor of the meat. The best thing that we tried was the sausage links.

The sides we tried were the potato salad, the peanut slaw and the BBQ baked beans. The BBQ baked beans were probably the best side there. The peanut slaw and potato salad were both very uninteresting and I could probably do without either one of them. All the portions for these were rather small considering the price.

I tried their BBQ chicken salad entree ($10) and it was totally not worth it. Basically it consisted of a small side salad with hunks of cheddar, a few onion straws and less than 10 pieces of chicken (approximately the size of half a chicken thigh). WTF! It tasted okay but seriously could have provided a more reasonable portion. Even Weight Watcher's probably would have given you more (probably minus the cheese and the onion straws... but who's counting?)

The BBQ pulled pork sandwich ($10) was a more reasonable size but again the meat overall was pretty bland and lacked the smoky flavor.

If you're looking for some good finger lickin' BBQ, this is not really the place to hit. The food here is okay but if you factor in the price/portion ratio it is pretty expensive for what it is. Unless you have a BOGO lunch coupon from Red Rock, I'd probably skip this joint (2.5 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,2,y3WHRmH6fKhnc4SdneIbCQ

2217140,2014-05-27,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Since moving to Vegas, whenever the topic of BBQ comes up, someone always mentions Lucille's.  Despite being very close to the District location, I never made the trip.  Recently I was up at Red Rock Casino around lunch time and thought it was time to try some Lucille's.

Since it was a casual lunch and we didn't want to spend forever in the dining room, we opted to sit at the bar.  Normally we sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table, but this was about 1145am on a Saturday and there were maybe 20 other diners - in other words, it was empty.

The bartender took our order soon enough.  She was knowledgeable, she was pleasant, she tried to up-sell us on a few things.  She offered us biscuits but not in a manner that suggested they were complimentary (or apparently delicious); it seemed like the last in a long string of up-sell.

Our food eventually came and was decent.  It was not the best BBQ I have ever had.  It wasn't the best BBQ I have had in Vegas.  It was good and satisfying but that's about the extent of it.  DC's mac and cheese was a pitiful attempt at mac and cheese.  It was stringy and mushy and flavorless.  His chicken sandwich, ordered with ranch dressing on the side, also came with a healthy slathering of ranch on the sandwich itself.

The bartender checked on us once, right as we were taking our first bite.  Despite that fact that she was never more than ten feet from us, she never checked in again.  In fact, the only time she acknowledged us again was when we were laughing at something on the TV and she turned around and asked ""what's so funny? are you laughing at me?""  It was an odd question to ask and a little off-putting.  I'm not always the nicest person but I dont laugh out loud at someone when he or she is within arm's reach.

All told it was just a mediocre experience at Lucille's.  The food was alright.  The service was questionable (especially since it was quite empty).  I may still have to give the Henderson location a try, but I will keep on moving past the Red Rock version.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,2,0,2,IMh-h513kRuS-qJUiDYHRA

Promptly took our orders, let us know about the specials they had going on, and did everything with a smile.  Thanks to Christina I will be coming back to this place again.

When the food did arrive it was freezing cold. 3. The food didn't taste that good, i ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich with applewood smoked bacon which sounded appetizing on the menu yet when i received my sandwich the chicken was dry and the bacon had a similar texture to cardboard, it was far worse than microwavable bacon, and frankly i didn't even think it was bacon just some fake processed ""bacon flavored"" plastic. 4. The food didn't arrive all at once as it normally does at most restaurants, it came dish by dish, when one person finished there dish another one had arrived, and ironically (me being the only ""yelper"" of the group) my dish came last. I do understand they were swamped due to it being christmas day and all but this is flat out unacceptable. However they do have decent ribs. The only reason i gave this place 2 stars is because of our extremely nice server who was empathetic to the fact the kitchen had delayed our food and also because after speaking to the manager about our ""lovely christmas dinner"" he offered to comp our meal.

We decided Thanksgiving was as good a day as any to check this place out for some Thanksgiving dinner...even though we went for lunch. They take reservations both online and via phone, which was great for us because I had to ensure that I had enough time to eat and then go to work afterwards. 

Lucille's Thanksgiving dinner meal consisted of turkey or honey ham (of half of each, which is what we got) with gravy, green bean casserole, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, biscuits w/ apple butter and a small personal pumpkin pie. The food was delicious and we even had leftovers because we couldn't finish it. The best part was the personal pie that was amazingly creamy and served with tons of whipped cream.

The staff was nice and I like how they work as a team instead of customers only being able to flag down their assigned waiter/waitress like traditional restaurants. I also loved that they had TVs everywhere in the dining area so we were able to catch glipses of the Thanksgiving Day parade and football game while we were there.

Service was nice but definitely on the slower side, especially considering that we beat the dinner rush and it wasn't too busy yet. The meal comes with complimentary biscuits and a spiced butter. Biscuits are topped with a sugary crust and the butter is okay but didn't taste like anything to me. This is the first place I've been to that serves a sweet bread as a starter rather than a savory one. 

The food was tasty. I got the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich, which has a potato bun and mustard slaw. Side of sweet potato fries. The meat was tender, though I would have preferred a regular coleslaw instead of the mustard one. Boyfriend got the half chicken with brisket and rib tips. His was good as well, with the chicken being the most flavorful out of the three meats. 

Price-wise, it's on the expensive side, probably because of the casino location.

It really is a hit or miss here, more service wise but sometimes food wise. The majority of my dining is done in the day here. And we've come to the conclusion that sitting in the long big booths beside the bar are cursed. But in my restaurant world mind, I know why we usually get crappy service here. The bartender. This is the bartenders section and the day bartender always has sidework that has to be completed for the night bartender. SO their tables are a forethought in their mind. But I see her looking at us out of the corner of her eye and she's thinking let me finish this last lemon, or let me just finish prepping garnishes or re-filling mixers...but you took too long to finish and while we are here for a quick and speedy lunch, it always fails. We often have to ask for the biscuits, to tell her we are ready to order-which she probably already knows because as I said I saw her looking at us, for refills, the check, a box. As soon as the check dropped she was all smiles and thank you's. Nope, I don't fall for that and I am happy to educate the people that do not know better for they shall not be taken advantage of. 

The food is good. The portions are either too small or ridiculously big! Once I got a BBQ chicken salad for lunch, it was served to me in a soup bowl. UGH! Half of it ended up on the table after having to cut the large lettuce pieces. It was a $10 salad in a soup bowl. Their lunch prices and items are decent selection. 
On another visit I got, I think it was a special, BBQ chicken lettuce wraps. Could I have some more toppings with my lettuce. Thank you! But overall it lacked flavor anyway and I didn't finish it. The best things are their Fried Green Tomatoes with the Red Pepper Sauce! So yummy! 

Let me say though, I have had dinner at this location once and everything was great that night, service and food! 

Their drinks are probably the second best thing...their GIANT quart sized drinks will give you a sugar stroke if you are drinking pop but if you get their iced teas they are so good! Peach and Watermelon and they are not flavored with syrups! So they are unsweetened. That makes me a fan. The other is their cocktails while I've only had one at this location, Lucille's Big Peach, it was strong without being gross and I love peaches!

The atmosphere is acceptable, some cool artistic things around the restaurant but I didn't spend a lot of time looking at it. 
They bring sodas out in huge mason jars - which is perfect because I drink them very quickly. I ordered their signature soup, a corn chowder. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Seriously - best corn chowder ever. EVER. Perfect balance of sweet and salty, lots of veggies too. Server brought out some biscuits as well, and they were just okay, maybe a little dry but the sweet sugar butter they serve with it is yummy. 
For my entree I had the half chicken - served with 2 sides; I chose mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, all of it was very good and the chicken was not dry at all, the skin was slightly crispy from the grill and had a very good BBQ sauce on it. All that for only $25

2646033,2015-12-28,3,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Decided to give Lucille's a try after having previously decided on going to the Yardhouse for Xmas dinner.  We are glad we did.  They had just opened for lunch  so we were seated quickly.  Lucille's had some great lunch specials that grabbed my attention quickly.  The server Ricardo was very helpful in explaining the menu and a little about Lucille's showing us the smoker in the dining room and explaining some of the processes, the house made BBQ sauces. Ricardo even made some suggestions and I don't usually fall for these sales tactics but since he was being effective at his job and it was the holiday I went along with his recommendations.  In fact the service we received from Ricardo makes this a 5 star visit and most likely why we will be back.

To start we had the fried pickles with mustard sauce which came out from the kitchen quickly.  These pickle spears were huge.  I might get the half order next time because this was plenty of app to start.  Next they have these fresh made biscuits served with apple butter.  They tasted sugar crusted and were so light a flakey and hot out of the oven. Yum!

I decided on the combo platter with 3 Spare Ribs, Brisket Burnt Ends, and Pulled Pork and I chose the Mac n Cheese for my side.  No garnish of lettuce for this plating, They wanted to highlight the meat only.  The portions were good and definitely filling.  With everything else I had I did not even attempt to tackle the side.  The burnt ends were a little chewy, I think I was expecting a little more tenderness.  The pulled pork was shredded nicely and sauced appropriately.  I did need a slice of bread to go with these items but I decided on slapping the meat on one of the biscuits.  Spare Ribs were fall off the bone cooked to perfection.  ON each table they have 3 featured sauces for your taste bud tantalizing.  My favorite was the spicy. 

We also had the Garden burger which came out with a nice smokey flavor.  Ricardo came out and informed us of all the vegetarian options that Lucille's offer's and how they cane make many of their pasta dishes with out meat for those dietary needs.  

Overall great experience for our first Lucille's experience.  I have not someone been so accommodating at an eating establishment in a long time and Ricardo was rewarded nicely for it.  He set the bar pretty high for future visits and I hope we are not let down.  Thank You Ricardo. We will be back.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,5,3,5,FLvM9q02lOdAwkOy2J1iaw

Upon entering we enjoyed the pungent smoky/salty/sweet aromas of a mixture of meats that caused us to salivate like Pavlov's dogs.  After checking in with the hostess we were sat fairly quickly in one of the back room's booths.  We ordered a round of drinks (Blueberry Bliss Margaritas) and decided to start with the Fried Green Tomatoes and Roasted Artichokes however the server informed us that they were out of the artichokes.  For our main courses, we ordered the Beef Ribs, BBQ Sauteed Shrimp, Kid's Pizza and 2 orders of Mac N Cheese.  Our server was very nice and attentive throughout our meal.  The Fried Green Tomatoes came in a congealed red pepper sauce that was a pass, but the tomatoes themselves were sweet and tasty.  The beef ribs were incredibly fatty and charred with very little sauce.  The kids demolished the pizza and mac so those were the true winners of the meal.

the service was attentive and good.  She kept our drinks full and brought us two baskets of biscuits as we had multiple kids at the table.  The mistake they made was bringing the adults meals prior to the kids meals.  They should have come out first or at least all together.  
The baby back ribs were good, fell off the bone so they were tender but they didn't pack much flavor.  The tri tip also was tender and lean this time and the sauce it came with was better than eating it with bbq sauce but again not a ton of flavor without the sauce.  The corn on the cob my friend got was juicy and good, the veggies another one got was seasoned well but my sweet potato (and i love sweet potatoes) was runny and bland.  
We were all too full for dessert........we would come back due to the convenient location but for bbq itself we would go elsewhere. The issue we had too was that happy hour was only at the bar, so if we came with the kids after school we would be able to have food but not participate in happy hour. when we asked about it too we were told definitely not.

2739787,2013-11-28,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Second visit here at Lucille's Red Rock and under awed with the cooking, again. 

First time here, a Saturday night, I had a dinner salad with tri tip and way too much long-sliced scallions (onion). Whole thing was drenched in dressing making it just taste bleh.  

This time was a Wednesday, lunch special (3pm), stuffed baked potato with beef. Way hard to cut potato even using a steak knife (no joke) and the beef was chewy / rubbery, even under melted cheese - they left potato on warmer / heat lamp too long. Also, way too much long-sliced scallions as garnish. Why not offer chives as an additional pay-for option?

Tried Lucille's beer sampler this time and only their version of wheat beer paired well with any of the food, in spite of what alcohol menu & server said. Three other samples (blonde, and ??) were each very bitter. 

Also, just an FYI, happy hour prices are only in the bar. They'd make more money if they allowed happy hour prices in the whole restaurant, like other Las Vegas chain restaurants. 

On positive note, the server apologized for both my kid's meals coming out ten minutes (not exaggerating) after my wife's & my plates. The fries had sat out too long & got soggy, so they had to fry up another batch.

I never make a fuss in a restaurant, as I've worked in the industry. I'll go back one more time, as my kids like the Mac & cheese here. We'll see how they do then.

Then, if no change, I'll just post on here and call their corporate number to check out the reviews. That'll shake up the kitchen staff and hopefully improve the quality.

By the way, I'm a huge fan of the Lucille's in Henderson. Thought all chain restaurants had the same cooking practices, food & standards?",RQSUh9qbH8Ut7uJ0_iwALw,6,0,1,245b-ajDmSVpVqGtaOHg1g

Starting first with THE HOSTESS CANDACE who clearly doesn't know how to sit people accordingly. This is the same hostess I've read about in other reviews. Even if you make reservations she still manages to get it wrong. She will have you waiting for ever, so make sure to wake her up. She tends to fall into this I am so clueless kind of look( daydreaming). Not the brightest individual, clearly lacks common sense. But hey....what can you expect, it's CANDACE. 
    Oh and TOM the manager does not care one bit about his job. Lacks customer service BIG TIME!!! Don't even bother to tell him any bad situation you have encountered there. He might as well be known as CANDACE jr. He will look at you  and try to BS you with his awful explanations. I told TOM that I've been waiting for a table for a party of five. Which was suppose to be a 35 min wait. Turned out to be 1hr and 25min later. I asked him how hard is to accommodate 5 people here. He said that he didn't have anything available, yet as we are talking about this I see other parties of 4 go by and get seated. All of these parties came way after us being there. I told him I would call corporate and tell them the situation and that I would make sure to point him (TOM) and CANDACE out about how terrible and crappy their customer service is here. As soon as I said that, he then turned around like a little lost kid and all of a sudden there's a booth available. WOW!! Talk about getting caught in a lie, funny how they quickly changed as soon as I said I would be calling corporate. Which I still plan on doing! So thank you TOM-aka Candace jr.

Manager and the hostess here should get employee of the month for excellent crappy  service. Never once did he apologize about the inconvenience, but it's ok tho I believe in karma.

Just make sure you have good company to make the time go fast. Appreciate the text message updates of place in line. Now, waiting with Tokyo Teas (Think Long Island without the Coke, add Midori) in hand made the wait even more bearable. Appreciate the speed in which the bartender knocked out 2 Tokyo Teas, 1 Rum Punch, and an old fashioned. We had an accident with one of the Tokyo Teas when being seated, and management replaced it...with no issue and without having to ask them. The food was phenomenal, HOT, and well worth the wait to be seated. You won't get your food instantly, but good things come to those who wait.

 I liked the bbq chicken most of all.  It was moist and the smoky flavor made it so tasty.  I barely added any bbq sauce to it.  I loved that you didn't have to ask for extra sauce if needed.  There were two full bottles already on the table.  One regular and the other spicy, both very flavorful.  What I liked about the beef rib is that you just had to tackle it with both hands and just gnaw the meat right off the bone and with not a thought of decorum.  Unlike a lot of people who prefer the meat that just falls off the bone,  I enjoy using my ""canines"".

The pieces of tri tip, however,  got a C-.  It was only because I'm accustomed to it being medium rare.  Between the smoking, grilling and warming for serving, it inevitably gets to be well done and a bit dry.

As we were being seated we walked through the entire restaurant closest to the casino side. Here's when I started thinking what the heck is going on in here. We walked by about 20 tables and of those tables 10 were all dirty covered with plates, hmmm?? No busser? As we were seated we were greeted fast and ordered drinks. We got our drinks and ordered our appetizer we got the Chicken Fingers and BBQ potato chips BOTH were delish! By now 5 tables were all sat within 5 minutes in our servers section. He was trying his best to accommodate everyone but that's a lot all at once. I then watched a manager walk over passing at least 5 dirty tables not picking up one dirty plate or even to ask to fill a soda up saw that he was in over his head and drowning and walk away not even asking him if he needed help. We ordered our food, Pulled pork sandwich and he got the ribs with cole slaw and macaroni. It was all very good! When the food runner dropped off his ribs he said the macaroni was on its way but it never came and bc our server was way to busy we didn't get a chance to tell him. He handled it well and got us a desert on the house, snickers ice cream cake which was awesome as well. 
I work in the industry so I know what the server was going through. He had no help, no busser, AND the food runner forgot part of our order and no manager support. You get 3 stars bc Kevin was a great server but your restaurant as a team SUCKS.

I consider myself a student of BBQ, an avid backyard smoker and have had ribs all over the USA from Memphis in May to the Reno BBQ Fest. These were miniature bones. I asked the server why the bones were so short and if an entire slab would have all short bones. She did not know but was willing to ask the manager.

We split a TON of appetizers and got entrees -- bad choice because the portions are HUGE, great choice because everything was so delicious!  

I tried the corn chowder and smoked chicken pasta.  The corn chowder was delicious, creamy and a sweet corn flavor.  The smoked chicken pasta was incredible; the sauce was creamy and delicious, the pasta was well-cooked but not soggy and the chicken was tender and melt in your mouth.

I had the Georgia Peach (or something of that nature!) cocktail which was delicious; and moderately priced for the size.  Very refreshing and delicious.  I didn't get to try it but Lucille's also brews there own beer which I'm sure would have been great!

I was there for an early dinner on a Monday it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. Menus were dropped off and our server was at our table almost right away with drink orders. 
The food was very good. I had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger with fries as a side though you can have other options, like veggies or a baked potato. The burger was huge too, I had to cut it in half which for me is always a good sign. The burnt ends were delicious as well which came with a piece of watermelon too. Three types of BBQ sauce right at the table. They have their own brand. I didn't try all three but the hot option was pretty good.

It was extremely annoying. After asking several employees about it including a manager, they nonchalantly said it was the hotel and they couldn't do anything about. It was a little frustrating no sympathy, no apologies, just an oh well it happens all the time type attitude.

Inside was jumping with live music and large TV displays and decorated with a western theme with large wooden booths and tables. 

We were seated promptly however it did take a long time for the waiter to acknowledge us we needed to flag someone down to take our order I had to minus a star. After that the service was better and the food was amazing. 

The half portion of the appetizer platter was perfect for the 3 of us Pork Rib tips,  fried dill pickles, sweet potato fries, fried green tomatoes, egg rolls,  fried okra,  chicken strip and hot links. It was all very tasty and perfect if you want to try various things. 

We ordered BBQ shrimp, beef brisket and a bbq rib combo platter.  It came with choices of sides. I had the sweet potato fries which was awesome perfectly crunchy and seasoned I'm the outside and sweet and soft on the inside. The brisket was very tasty and you can tell that they have their own smoker in house and they smoke it there.  The ribs were amazing too! For a restaurant attached to a casino I was very impressed. The complimentary biscuits that they serve are deliciously homemade and I had to stop myself from eating too much. Unfortunately unable to try a dessert I was too full from dinner.

Holy moly, reminded me of chicken fried steak, it was AH-MAZING! Almost all the side dishes were excellent. Although I wouldn't get the garlic mashed potatoes again. Not bad at all, but they could be better I guess. 

Is it pricey? Um, plates run about $30-35 for the meat dishes. Appetizers are a bit on the pricey end up around $9-15. But it is SO worth it!

The reasons for the lost of a star are the air conditioning is super cold in there. Not normally a problem, but there doesn't  seem to be any spots in the back dining room to escape the AC. This is a problem, because the food gets cold quickly once it hits the table. The 2nd issue was the Baby back ribs were a little on the dry side. Good flavor, but maybe just a little well done.
With that out of the way, this was still a positive 4 star experience. 
Service was something to be seen in person. Great model of how to service your guest. Ordered the sample appetizer platter. The tri tips were outstanding! As well as every item on the platter. 
The entree was the 2 meat combo. It included the already mentioned baby back ribs and Brisket. The Brisket was top notch. Sides were authentically good too. They were cheese grits and collard greens.
They look to have a really good happy hour too.

So they have really good appetizer menu and prices during happy hour from 3-7 daily. The bad news, its only available in the bar part and they wont honor it in the restaurant part. So if its crowded and there are no seats in the bar, you get the pleasure of paying basically double because you have to sit in the restaurant. Terrible policy

I really do like their brisket nachos, sliders, onion strings, burgers, burnt ends and hot and spicy sauce.

Consistent, decent food. Service is relatively consistent. However, never have had a horrible experience. Yet, the last time I went, it was really off. Two of us ordered drinks from the bar & I swear, no exaggeration, it took them about 20-30 minutes to get us a beer & a margarita. Then, it took them 58 minutes to bring us our food; I only know this cause the Manager shared that with us while discussing the issue. Then once the food arrived, they switched my order with someone else at the table. When I caught it, they were quick to take care of it. However, I ended up canceling my order all together because I was afraid my food wouldn't make it back out until everyone at my table was done. Just a big ol mess!
Upside, our Server was super cool even during the disaster. However, I never blamed her for what happened. I mentioned to the Manager that she was great the entire time and he should double check the kitchen, the expeditors and the food runners. The Manager was an upside too. He immediately ran over to us, offered to rectify the situation. And when I asked him to cancel my order, he brought over the incorrect item in a to go bag & suggested that because they're just going to throw it away, if I wanted , I could have it. I politely declined. He then offered to give us dessert on the house however everyone else was too full & over it by this time, that we respectfully declined. 
Again, it's a chain. They do what their formula tells them to do. The food ain't bad. Service has always been good. Just this one time was a mess. I won't go running back, but it's there.

Their bacon is not crispy and was overwhelming in taste because it was cut super thick. I also had a tri tip sandwich here. The tri tip was decent with good moisture.

Obviously BBQ is going to be heavy, so no big deal there. I feel like Lucille's is rather pricey though, so I'd rather hit up places like Rollin' Smoke or Jessie Rae's as it's more the meat than the place that you're paying for.

Edit: The owner/manager of the Lucille's did contact me and informed me that they'd like me back for another try.

I sat at the bar and it was happy hour, so great prices on appetizers and drinks. I ordered a cocktail and my favorite, fried pickles. So far all is great! After finishing my pickles it seemed like a while before my sandwich came but the sandwich would be worth the wait. I get the brisket and portobello sandwich usually so yummy. The sandwich finally comes, I pick it up and oh no, the bottom bread is all soggy. It must have been sitting for a while. I eat around the soggy part, the rest is still good and the Mac and cheese was delicious. I finish what I can and decide I will get my dessert to go. We'll, when I arrived there were 2 bartenders and the guy that took my order was on it, he took my order, made my drink and he was very nice. Shortly after my pickles came he disappeared and the girl that was taking care of the other side of the bar didn't seem to have any customer service skills at all. When she cleared my plate and drink glass she did ask if I wanted more water. She filled it and then pushed my tab in front of me. I waited a few minutes and then figured I might as well order my cheesecake from the take out window, so I got out my card to pay. I told her I had wanted to order cheesecake but then I changed my mind. I know she was working the whole bar by herself but really! A few days later I got my cheesecake from the one in Henderson, they were very nice. I will probably give them another chance but might not sit at the bar.",kPqj2vG8BdzDa_ounewkvA,0,0,3,LYA1tOMq3SbIQiJGKcDbbA

3723816,2015-01-03,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Christmas day. Just saw a movie and we were at Red Rocks. Everything was packed with 1 hour wait times. Lucille's had immediate seating.

I love good BBQ. I love a good cocktail. Ordered the Moscow Mule. They served it in a frufy glass and not a copper mug. Had agave syrup. Not a huge fan. Not a real Moscow Mule.

The server was not as attentive as a server should be.

I had the full rack of Baby Backs. The wrong order was brought to our table. They were good. The sides were good. Would have been nice to have a side of BBQ sauce.

We were there just over an hour. Their famous biscuits and apple butter which were promised prior to the meal never arrived. We were told they ran out and were in the oven. At the point we were paying our bill I got the same story from the server.

I spoke to the manager and he handed us a bag of biscuits to go within moments. If you are going to offer a signature biscuit, one had better manage the kitchen better.

I really do like Lucille's in general, but this review was based on this specific visit.

Updated: The management reached out to me and apologized and gave me a $25 card for a future visit. They must care.",f4GXSyxFoHFNW7Og0J3WXw,1,0,3,GADzepHb_3JTx6t_u-afFA

(Insert the song  - T'Aint Nobody's Business If I Do by Otis Spann (1930 - 1970))

We walked through the Red Rock Casino and Resort to the casino entrance. We noticed a sign asking patrons to go to the other hostess station to be seated. While walking to the OTHER SIDE of the restaurant we were greeted by someone ""who would be happy to seat us."" Only to have that person turn around and seat us at the nearest booth... how convienent.

(Insert the song  - Born Under A Bad Sign by Albert King (1923 -1992))

The atmosphere was fine, loved the decorations, love the music being played.
Part of the decor included fake trees in one section of the dining room. Which led me to wonder how much dust has collected on the leaves. How often are the leaves actually cleaned?

(Insert the song  - Dust My Broom by Elmore James (1918 - 1963))

The food was fine by me. I had some chicken and brisket which is a staple in my diet. But no sooner would I server come by and ask how things are doing, a manager or such would ask the same two minutes later. Felt kinda over done. 

(Insert the song  - Got To Be Some Changes Made by Otis Rush (b. 1934))

All in all everything was real good. But it was the little things that added up and made me want to leave one star off my review. Would I return to Lucille's? Let me answer that by saying...

3776852,2014-09-30,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"This was our 2nd visit at this location.
Went about 10:30pm Saturday for late night bite.

Wife ordered Pulled Pork Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries & I ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich with Pasilla Peppers, Jack Cheese with Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw.
Nothing special about the Pulled Pork Sandwich or Sweet Potato Fries.

Decent amount of Pork in Sandwich & good flavor but easily forgettable.
Wouldn't crave it or make me want to come back to order same.
Fries were barely warm & not crispy. More like having sit for some time?
The Peanut Slaw was good but sure Stingy with amount served.

The Tri Tip Pasilla Pepper Sandwich had good flavor in general. 
Meat was tender, juicy & tasty.
The slivers of Pasilla Pepper with Jack Cheese added flavor to the meat.

However, again, stingy with the amount of meat & slivers of Pasilla Peppers. 

They, like many Sandwich places, pile most of the meat in the center so when cut in half, appears to have adequate amount of meat?
But the center pile was not very high & had to move some meat from center area to edges where no meat existed. 

At first I though sandwich was going to have a whole Pasilla Pepper stuffed with Jack Cheese, which would have been great but as it turned out was only slivers of the pepper in very limited, sparsely spaced amount.

You'd think that, for $14.49 you would get a little more meat & an adequate amount of the peppers and use somewhat larger slices of bread? 

The advertise thick grilled sourdough but I would prefer regular thinner larger slices!
They use the thick sliced bread to make the sandwich appear bigger but in reality,  it's just a Small Fat $14.49 sandwich!

I'll have to try ordering the same sandwich at the District location to determine if that is same or not?
My guess is that the District location will be better all around.

On the upside, the waiter service was great this time.",7ks5gnxM_o4XEJK4j6QnoQ,0,0,3,Tc8NQQGickuF-5DknVjaGg

I was there November 3rd for Monday night football and as it was a little chilly outside I decided to have some corn chowder soup.   The waiter who took our order was brand new as the woman behind him mentioned that as he took our order.  I got the soup with cornbread and should have said something about how it wasn't that hot and tasted a little off.   The way he served it with an uncertain look should have been a sign.   
That night I encountered the worst level of food poisoning ever which carried for a few days. I will spare the review from being descriptive but I don't wish my worst enemy to experience what i went thru.    
When I finally had enough energy to call them (not being able to eat anything at all for days) i called to speak to the manager who rushed me to expect a call from HR later that day.   It was a day later and instead of asking if I'd like to see a doctor, she told me she would call in a few days.   That never happened and instead I got a gift card from them....    I wouldn't consider going back and called the HR woman telling her how disgusted I was on how sending a gift card was there way of handling after throwing up for days and being as sick as I was (I should have been in the hospital).  She said I would get called over the next day or two by her supervisor as well as the insurance company...  
Her supervisor never called and today the insurance company called and basically told me they wont do anything making me feel like a victim with all their questions.   
I tried calling to speak to the owner, got the HR person again and I'm done feeling like a victim.  
I've contacted the board of health based on getting food poison following being there and if you also got food poisoning following going to Lucilles I'd recommend you do the same!

What could be better, they have since opened a newer location (August 2013) much closer to my location in Red Rock, so it was easy to get to and a straight shot from my house.

Lucille's has two happy hours per day, and I was coming for their 9 till close option. I got there a bit early and hung out at the bar till 9, not an issue. When 9pm rolled around, we decided to move to a table, and I found out you HAD to sit in a special section only for it, odd but ok. 

Wait staff was nice, but each one had some flaw that was a bit offputing. This evening I went each person had a habit of either talking down about their employer or it's food, which is a bit worrysome if you are just sitting down to eat and somebody has been saying some unsavory things that WORKS there.

The happy hour menu had a pretty good selection. We ordered drinks (which are also discounted) and found that one after the other we tried were not very strong and mostly syrup. I hope their full priced versions are a bit better, I kept my choices of drinks to a minimum. Everything tasted alright, but more commercially prepared and not something I would find myself coming back for. Wait staff was friendly, but our server did disappear from his section for a while. Each server introduced themselves as ""hi my name is ""x,"" and I'll be your server until ""y"" get's back from her break. We ended up having like three servers during the course of the night. 

The complaints I have are minor, but after time even 2-3 minor items can add up to a less then perfect evening. Would I come back...maybe. Would I suggest to others...probably not. Not bad if you don't have all that many expectations.

I don't normally pay mind to the service.  But it is very business like here.  From the hostesses to the managers, I never saw a smile.  The customer almost feels like he's intruding or being a bother.

The beef ribs were beautiful and plentiful, but really hard to eat.  Way too much sinew, marble, and who knows what else.  The sauce was sickening sweet.  And it was all just plain too greasy.  My teeth were throbbing and screaming for floss afterwards.  The rest of my party didn't like the ribs either.

I live nearby, but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when it's placed in the bun and therefore it wasn't a hot sandwich and in fact wasn't warm.  Luke warm would be closer to the temperature of the meat.  The mac and cheese stayed warm.  I thought the sandwich was dry even though the menu says it's tossed in their special sauce.  Maybe I should have asked for some BBQ sauce to go.  There was no toss that I could discern.  The mac and cheese was very good.  My wife liked her sandwich although she thought it was very spicy hot.  She liked the garlic mashed side.

I guess I'm just not a BBQ person.  Nothing about BBQ blows my socks off.  If I came back to Lucille's, it would be for a dinner of mac and cheese.  I'll take international cuisines or a good steak before I'd get this.  There's one other BBQ place I need to try before I put a nail in my BBQ coffin and lower it in the ground.  The price/value just isn't there.  But, Lucille's is OK--Just.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,3,3,2UkFI7PCPkaXwYgHtPSSvA

But why do they consistently not have bread ready to go, it usually comes out with the entrees or right before the entree is served.

Not necessarily the best BBQ out there, I prefer to go ""rollin"" elsewhere but these are still prepared well.  I only get ribs when I go to BBQ places so I'm not sure if the other items are just A-Ok.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,3,3,3,wYCrYuUsrtUeaMLEs8tE7Q
4014483,2014-03-11,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Been wanting to go to the Lucille's in Green Valley Ranch for the longest time, but it's just so far away.  Was happy to hear Lucille's would be opening much closer to my neck of the woods at Red Rock Casino.  Finally visited on my stepdaughter's 21st birthday for dinner.

Gotta say right off the bat...not very impressed.  I mean, for all the fancy d√©cor, just average BBQ?  I have no need for that.  I know it's a chain (and a big one at that) but I don't really care for a pleasant atmosphere usually, for me it's about taste and portions!  Especially with BBQ.  I don't mind eating in a po-dunk, out-back, no-utensils kinda place if the que' is legendary.  Really, I don't.  Lucille's just isn't that kind of place.  But at least they use mason jars for your drinks!

After being seated (and boy was the place packed) we went straight to menu lookin'.  After ordering our drinks-in-mason-jars (makes me wish I got moonshine) we started off with an appetizer of BBQ Pork Nachos.  They arrived after about 20 minutes and looked really good.  Nacho chips topped with smoked BBQ pork, BBQ sauce, cheese (some shredded, some that was more like canned nacho cheese), black beans, pico de gallo, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole.  This dish was actually pretty good and hit on all the right spots - crunchy, gooey, smoky, salty, crispy, tangy, sweet, warm, and cool.  Flavor was great with the smoke coming from the BBQ pork, very well complemented.  These nachos were just enough to whet our appetite for our main courses.  We had to wait for our actual dinner courses longer than we did for our appetizer (I was assuming good que' takes some time).  

The birthday girl had the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich.  Angus beef smoked, with portabello mushrooms, red onions, jack cheese, and garlic mayo on thick slices of sourdough.  It was a good sandwich, and that garlic mayo gave it a nick kick.  They messed up on her side of fries though, so a new order had to be brought out.  

The little one ordered from the kids menu and had the quarter rack of Finger Licken' BBQ Ribs with a side of macaroni & cheese.  What kid doesn't like mac & cheese?  Mine does.  But this one from Lucille's?  Not on par at all.  It was watery, and not very cheesy, in fact it was pretty bland.  Hardly cheese-tastic at all.  I mean she's not too picky, and loves the fake stuff from the blue box!  So for her not to finish this mac & cheese was a big statement.  She did like her ribs though, but the serving was just too small and she was left hungry (even after the nachos).  

The wifey had probably the best dish of the night, 5 bones of the BBQ Beef Ribs.  Make room, cause the suckers are HUGE!  Like mini-dinosaur bones!  The beef ribs are rubbed, slow-smoked, then finished off on the grill with Lucille's original BBQ sauce.  I had one and they were GOOD.  Meaty, cooked long enough so the meat comes off the bone with just a little bit of give.  Smoky for sure, and good with the BBQ sauce finish.  Her sides?  She wasn't impressed.  The sweet potato fries were just ok, and the Southern Braised Greens were lacking.  Either not cooked long enough or not enough flavor added to the pot, there were super bland.

I wasn't jumping for joy with my dish, the St. Louis Spare Ribs.  I don't mind Baby Back Ribs, but they are way too small looking for a guy like me.  I want more meat, so give me the bigger rib!  My order came out and I was like 'Huh?'  Didn't I order St. Louis style?  I asked our waitress and she said they were St. Louis.  I'm no expert, but either these were Baby Back Ribs and you were lying to me, or you cut the ends of my St. Louis ribs way too short.  Where are the ends of my ribs?  Look at the pic your self and see.  I felt ripped off to say the least.  If they tasted good I guess it would have made up for it.  But these 'St. Louis' ribs were not the best I've had.  They were dry, and the smoke on them were barely noticeable.  The BBQ sauce on them didn't help either, all it did was coat them in what was now too-sweet ribs.  Disappointing.  I can finish off a rack of ribs myself, but I saved half of these for home.

I think the worst thing we had though was Lucille's homemade 'biscuits'.  Very confused.  These are not biscuits.  Nor are they really rolls.  What the hell are they?  And why are they covered in cinnamon and sugar?  Just plain odd, and not the most tasty biscuits I've ever had.  You guys should just call it a day and go back with Biscuit Basics 101 - Flour+Buttermilk+Lard=BISCUIT.  If it's good enough for the South it's good enough for the rest of us.

Service got spotty after our entrees arrived.  Our waitress was far in between on service, had to ask multiple times for refills on drinks even as she passed right by us.  Seems she was catering to a larger table nearby.

Prices are kinda high for Lucille's, around high $20s for a rack of ribs with sides.  Luckily we had an Xmas present of $100 gift card, which we used all of.  EH.  OK.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,3,0dvhk6ZOTsXJYj6Arnd7JA

4052688,2015-12-10,6,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"For Thanksgiving this year my husband and I decided to take the easy route, and ordered the Thanksgiving family feast from Lucille's. While there were no complaints about the actual food, the overall experience left a lot to be desired. 

Disappointment #1: When I tried to order from the other Lucille's and I was told they were sold out. I don't reside on this side of town so I very rarely go to any of the businesses at Red Rock, but since I had no other option I placed my order with this location. I was asked if I wanted plates and silverware, and told my pickup time. 

Disappointment #2: Over the phone I was told I could utilize the parking spots reserved for customers picking up to go orders. When I arrived, these spots were taken. (When I left, they were still taken by the same vehicles, clearly not people there to pick up to go orders). These spots are pointless. I ended up parking quite a distance from Lucille's which wouldn't have been THAT terrible except...

Disappointment #3: After I paid for my feast, I was asked by an employee if I needed assistance, which in hindsight I think should have been obvious that I would need help carrying the very large and heavy box of food out to my car. However the employee was simply offering to open the door for me. The lack of basic customer assistance was a bit mind boggling, other Lucille's customers that were leaving as I struggled to maneuver the box out to my car even commented how they thought someone should have helped me. 

Disappointment #4: The plates and silverware I was asked if I needed? Nowhere to be found. Not a huge deal, but why offer it if you will not be following through?

After enjoying the food and company of friends on Thanksgiving, I considered posting this review but decided instead to write to Lucille's corporate directly. I received a phone call from a manager who apologized and said she hoped I'd give them another shot. While I do appreciate that time was taken to contact me, I do not forsee me spending more of my money at Lucille's anytime soon.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,8,4,2,aVtvf3KPMvFlrY750zjBaA

We arrived in a Friday arrived 5 for a party of 8. The hostess was great and suggested we look at the menu and let us know it would be about 15 minutes. Though it took almost 25 minutes to get seated, it ended up being worth it. We were seated right in between the kitchen entrance and the smoker which worried me at first. But it gave us the best seat on the house to see (and smell) all of the meat. Plus, we were constantly checked on by the flow of staff going by our table. 

Our drinks and appetizers were quickly served and everything looked great! I was overly excited about my sweet tea (which they perfected) and the sangria. There was an assortment of beers at the table that all got the thumbs up. And those sugary biscuits. Oh my!! I could have ate the biscuits and drank my sweet tea all night. I really hate to say that I didn't bother with the butter. I was temporarily in a sugar high and my vision was clouded. 

Once the food started coming out, we were ready to get our hands dirty. Since my southern twang was out in full force, I went for the southern fried chicken sandwich. Even the smell of the bbq could stop me. And that was the best choice. That had to be the best chicken sandwich I've had in a long time. The brisket from the table that I sampled only confirmed that I had made the right decision with the sandwich. And unfortunately even the greens were blah. And there was no salt on the table so they eventually got cold and weren't eaten.

Grabbing the Chicken and Pull Pork with a side of Sweet Potato Mash I dug in right away. Both the chicken and pork had a great smokey flavor to the them with the chicken nice and juicey. The surprise of the meal was the Sweet Potato mash!!! Highly recommend if your unsure of a side.

The place is designed to look like a Memphis neighborhood and it's adorable.  You feel like you are in a private courtyard having a down home BBQ.  The staff is very friendly and abundant.  At times I felt that there was more staff than customers, but they are happy to be at work and it reflects.

We ordered Fried Okra http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QPkwidK5tNowIAqaXyhW5g&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA  and Fried Green Tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=frsSYty3-wDSpFLo6poEfw&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA  as our starters.  They were both excellent but the sauces they served them with really made them stand out.  The BBQ Ranch sauce they make is fabulous.

Hubby ordered the St. Louis Ribs with Tri-Tip off of the lunch menu, it comes with a side and he chose the shoestring potatoes.  He loved his meal except the ribs are a dry rub not sauced and he found them very dry.  They do have several signature BBQ sauces on the table to use though.

We really enjoyed our meal but there was a very VERY long wait for our main courses, which made no sense to me because realistically this type of food has already been prepared hours earlier.  The staff apologized and would keep reassuring us that it was on the way, but they never gave us a reason for the long wait.

My husband and I popped back into Lucille's this past Saturday after seeing an afternoon movie at Red Rock. The casino was quite busy with the Derby and the pending Mayweather/Pacquio fight. The restaurant was quite slow - I think it was probably 4 pm?

We were sat immediately in a two-top table, slightly awkward to get to because of it's location in a corner right behind another table that was seated. We were greeted within a few minutes by Nate who was friendly. 

I ordered a blackberry margarita and hubs ordered sweet tea. His sweet tea came first after Nate informed us that the original cocktail meant for me spilled and had to be remade. No problem. 

We ordered our meals - pulled pork sandwich for me, fried chicken special for hubs. We were offered biscuits while we waited which were hot and fresh. (Side note...these still aren't like any biscuits I've ever had and, being from the south, I would never think to dust the biscuits with sugar...but, ok). 

Food arrived - mine first with my husband's trailing after. Plates felt as if they had been sitting in the expeditor's window but ok..we got our food. My pulled pork was fine and as expected. Hubs' fried chicken special consisted of two fried chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, saw mill gravy on the side and an ear of corn.  Hubs wasn't thoroughly impressed with the chicken - after tasting a bite, it seemed to be lacking seasoning or flavor in the chicken and in the breading. Overall, it was fine and he finished most of his plate and was full. 

We enjoyed the meal as it was, and the service from Nate. Being the bbq connoisseurs we think we might be, Lucille's doesn't make the grade for us but other folks will probably enjoy it.  The food prices, in my humble opinion, don't match the quality or flavor. 

Giving Lucille's an upgrade to 3 stars because they cared enough to get us to come back and the return experience was better than the original.",DD1Rm0J5xFmXWcDJZ2iMSg,0,0,3,uxFyU7ZeuvJhOeGYksKNEw

I'm not a fan of smoked (anything) but they put just the right amount of smoke in the Q that I don't feel like I myself am inhaling the smoke directly from the smoker. Their Memphis BBQ sauce is what makes it for me. I hearts me some garlic and that sauce has the right amount of everything!

Another one of the ""hooray"" moments I had was when they told us that they had unsweetened flavored teas, WHAT?! I dislike sweet tea, a lot. If I want a pound of sugar in my water, I'll ask for syrup. And most places have flavored tea but it's always sweetened and me no likey. They have watermelon, peach, regular and sweet tea. 

They have a nice backyard BBQ theme and have a stage in the ""Flying Pig Lounge"" which leads me to believe that they intend to use it one day for a live band. It'd be pretty cool to come in for a live band or even a comedy show :)

We were sat next to the water in front of Red Rock, so it was super nice! As the night went on it got a bit chilly, but we were ok.

Im going to keep this short, out waiter was an idiot and didnt listen to us whilst taking our order and messed up half of it. We then politley asked for it to be corrected and he AGAIN didnt pay attention so we ended up having an incorrect order. THEN we askd a waitress for a set of tableware and she looked at us as though we were asking for a million dollars, then only reason we asked was because they didnt give us enough!!

The food was cold and flavorless and we were basically ignored 90% of the night due to a large party in the bar area. The supervisors and most of the waitstaff were kissing this groups behind and it was getting pathetic.

There we sat waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Cold food and all!

We asked to speak to the manager and our server gave us a dirty look and asked why? WHAT!? Why? Because I said so! Jesus!

The steak sandwich was supposed to be served on artisan type bread but this was hogie roll like you'd get at Sams Club and seemed stale.  The steak was very thick...not good for a sandwich.  In the past at the District it was usually sliced and cut in 4 smaller size portions which were easier to eat.  Another favorite is the bbq chicken salad that my husband had...he lettuce was soggy and dressing tasted funny.

First of all, Hubby is from Kansas City (Bar-B-Que Headquarters of the USA) and VERY discerning when it comes to smoked meats! We decided to order a combo of Baby Back Ribs and Tri Tips. We had never heard of Tri Tips before and our server, Jill, did a great job of explaining the difference between them and Burnt Ends. 

The Tri Tips were tender, juicy and flavorful. The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious! We both were not impressed with the Original or the Memphis sauces, but the Hot and Spicy sauce was excellent!! We got Creamy Coleslaw and Honey Peanut Slaw for sides and both were delicious! We also ordered some Cornbread, which was yummy, and enjoyed the light, fluffy biscuits. I agree with other reviews that the biscuits really do not need the sugar on top!

For drinks we opted for a 1/2 caraf of Layer Cake Malbec, a delicious and a perfect pairing for the smokey meats!! We were impressed with the ""caraf"" option for wines, as we really didn't want a full bottle.

Our go-to place for BBQ was Famous Dave's. One thing that's better at Lucille's is that they had beef and pork ribs and Famous Dave's didn't. Once we heard that a location of Lucille's was opening at Red Rock Hotel, which was nearby our house we wanted to go. Now I will tell you my experience...

After looking through the menu everything looked and sounded so yummy. Our kind waiter came in asking what drinks we wanted, there was a good amount of drink choices. The drinks were pretty good then we ordered. We waited around 10-15 minutes for our food and it was very very yummy. The food costed a normal price, but if you want to save money and have a Costco membership I have a tip for you.

     So, right across the street is Costco, when you go inside head to the gift cards. Then buy the gift card which is 45-49 dollars (forgot) for two twenty five dollar gift card. Then buy it and use it at the restaurant, you just saved some money!

One friend had to send her burger back, but it wasn't returned until we were all nearly done eating, and then only after she corralled a different waiter to get her food.  With our drinks empty and 20 minutes to go before HH ended, we were never asked if anyone wanted another drink.  I was a little miffed that at the end, my friends decided to not only give the waitress a break, but even to go slightly above the 20% tip.  I wouldn't have stiffed her, but sure wouldn't have been that generous.

I had the Cuervo margarita, and it was very good.  One friend ordered the strawberry lemonade, and only liked it after she had them add a shot of vodka to it.  She didn't get a sense of any of it in there the way it should have been.

Now for the food:  the complimentary biscuits were good, even for this non-biscuit lover, but they didn't need the sugar sprinkled on top.  I like to save my calories for more important things.

Almost everyone ordered something different, so I got to taste most of the HH offerings.  I had gumbo and a blackened chicken quesadilla.   The gumbo was more like a stew, the thickest one I've ever eaten.  It came with a small mold of white rice on top.  It had good flavor and just the right amount of spice for me, but way too much salt.  What it didn't have was a single piece of okra and not a shrimp in sight.  A friend who also had it found one little shrimp in hers, but also no okra.

My quesadilla was okay, nothing to write home about.  Not a lot of chicken, and the chicken was barely blackened.  The one thing I can recommend is the wedge salad, ordered by another friend.  It was huge, and would have been a much better accompaniment to my gumbo.

The rib tips were dry.  Isn't this a rib place????  Glad I didn't order them.  I didn't taste the pulled pork sliders, but they looked juicy and my friend said they were.  Fried tomatoes - a new experience for the northerners among us (and that's all of us, except for the one Australian!) - were devoured happily.

Overall, Lucille's is okay, but just okay.  I don't think I'll use my gambling points to rush back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,3,HWUJNSZq6E_v4_zPFsa7tw
4491234,2016-12-30,1,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"It's the little things that bring me here like their Fried Green Tomatoes and my mom not wanting to leave the slots so I figured we should do dinner while we wait. This Luciille's is in the  Red Rock Casino so if you are with people who are gambling you can simply sit it out and have a meal instead. 

When ever I come here I start with the Fried Green Tomatoes because it's rare that I find it in any of the restaurants I go to. Truthfully ever since I read the book "" Fried Green Tomatoes "" in high school I've liked this dish and it's trouble some to make so I'm glad Lucilles offers this as an appetizer. The tomatoes are fried in what looks like cornmeal it's crispy and the sauce is cream based. I doubt if they are fried in bacon grease like it states in the book but hey are still delightful! 

I decided to get another appetizer so I can get exactly what I want so I ordered their fried shrimp. I know that it is two fried things in a row but trust me I'm southern at heart! I prefer their mustard dip to the tarter sauce because it's has a little more kick to it. 

It was my birthday month so my husband mentioned my birthday and they also sent out a colorful birthday treat . Chocolate cake , vanillia ice cream with sprinkles ! Yum! 

Our server was awesome he kept checking on us and tended to everything we needed from more bread , refills etc. He also packed us more bread and honey butter to go. Excellent service !",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,4,4,5,0LZHfC5q7cUeKnyIDOrCdg

Both servers should go to the table and introduce the other.

 So then we were upset with John because we still didn't get attention. I thought maybe things would get better but they never did.

Pulled pork sandwich came out with the bottom bun literally soaked through - disgusting. They remade it using a very thick brioche style bun that was all wrong for a pulled pork sandwich so I ate the meat without a bun. The meat was a C-minus at best. Tasted much more like a sloppy joe than bbq pulled pork. For the side I got macaroni and cheese which was also very disappointing.

4655174,2014-02-24,6,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"It was a Saturday night in Red Rock Casino and we were up for Lucille's Barbecue. So were several other people. There would be a 45 minute wait. Thanks to an innovative yet obvious system the 45 minutes would be put to good use. After the host informed us of the wait, he asked for the cell phone number. When our table was ready, he would send a text message. Lucille's just happens to be Red Rock Casino neighbors with the Yard House, an indoor theme park of beer. And when I drink a beer in the yard House, 45 minutes flies by fast and before I knew it, Lucille's Barbecue sent the text.

  I had my mind set on ordering some type of hamburger sandwich. From past experiences dining in restaurants specializing in barbecue cuisine, the hamburgers are exceptional (same holds true with steak houses). After a cursory glance at the menu, the smoked beef brisket & portabello sandwich struck my eyes. I am a fan of brisket and mushrooms. After the waiter said this is one of their best sandwiches, I ordered it. Color me impressed with the sandwich. Everything from the grilled red onions to the sourdough bread was quality. The space between the sourdough buns was thick with the smoked beef brisket. Delicious smoked beef brisket that is. I appreciated that it wasn't sticky. With the sandwich, I chose shoestring fries. They were decent. And the soda that I drank was in a large glass. 

  Attentive and for the most part friendly servers placed the food on the table. One of the servers was attentive enough to let us know that the bread rolls were taking awhile because they were making new ones. Toward the end of the meal, one of the servers took the initiative to give us a to-go box. My one beef with the service was having to wait on ketchup. 

  I am impressed with Lucille's Barbecue. Especially,  when a 45 minute wait is no wait, but the freedom to have a beer in the Yard House or walk around Red Rock Casino until a text message sends the alert that the table is ready.

I see a lot of reviews on the host/greeter. There were two people upfront, I think one was in training. Not very smiley, but they sat us immediately. 

I love the design of the restaurant! It's like you're sitting outside, there's fake tress and the kitchen looks like a restaurant and what not. They smoke the meat inside ! 

Our server Anthony, was nice. He took care of us, nothing too special. He answered some of my questions and wasn't rude about it. 

First we ordered our drinks which were an IPA beer and I ordered a blue bayou, which was a coconut tequila, 1800 reposado,  blue and blackberries, margarita type drink. When you order the Blue Bayou, a dollar supports the cause for autism. The drink was DELICIOUS. When we got our drinks, he also brought out some biscuits, I believe ? It was so delicious! It wasn't as moist. But it was still good. They also had some kind of whipped apple cinnamon butter ? I don't know what it was, but it was tasty. It's sweet, so I ended up eating it last, as a dessert. Kind of wish I had more . 

My boyfriend has ordered babyback rib lunch with collard greens, and I ordered 2 meat combo, which was burnt tips, pulled pork and Mac n cheese. The rib and the tips were bomb !!!! The pulled pork, not so much.. I find it kind of dry. Mac n cheese is normal, but the collared greens were yuck. It was so mushy. It reminded me of an Asian vinegar veggie dish that sat in a pot for a long time, so it became mush. I was a little disappointed. 

Up side , they have 3 sauces on the table! I love sauce, so I put hot sauce into the greens. It tastes a little better. 

Another thing, I posted a pic of my dish.. I know bbq food isn't really ""pretty"", but my plate looked like I got it from a cafeteria . It looked like someone scooped the meat. It's all in the middle, I had so much space on my plate, the presentation isn't as nice like other bbq joints. 

Prices are reasonable. 2 dishes(15.99&10.99) , 2 drinks(can't remember the prices), for lunch we spent about 48$ not including tip. 

We also got a deal since it's autism awareness month, if you donate 5$ you get 10$ to use on your next visit (may-June only). So we opted to do that, good to donate from time to time.

The Bad:

We ordered a full rack of St. Louis Spare Ribs. They appeared tasty we each cut a few off and took a few bites. Something was just not right. The best way I can explain the taste is if you were to dump a ton of lighter fluid over a charcoal grill and use it immediately after. We spoke with the manager and she agreed to bring another rack of ribs. This time baby rack - Maybe it was just a single occurrence? They had the same exact flavor. Something is broken. They confirmed something was not right. Not sure how everyone else was just eating away. They comped the full meal ($15) of sides and we left feeling sick and with a headache. Extremely disappointed.

It seems like I always get the overly dry baby back ribs. Grumbling all the way to Lucille's, I ordered the exact same thing as my girl. My incessant griping probably got to her nerves. I went with my rant on how my ribs always turn out dry and the only thing about this place is that they slather the ribs with a crapload of sauce. And then the waiter has the nerve to come and ask us how the ribs are after they give you a plate with enough sauce to drown both you and your dog, provided you went in with a seeing eye dog or something.

No, I don't know what's so great about the food. My ribs came out dry. But I told the waiter and the manager this time. Every time I go to one, I always get the dry one. I gave 3 pieces to my girl and she nodded her head that it was dry compared to hers. So the grumbler wasn't grumbling for the heck of it. But they were nice enough and got me new ones which were not as dry. But it gets pretty old to almost always having to do it when you order your food. You know for a nice BBQ without the wait or pretense, I'd go to Dickey's.

What I do like about Lucille's. Their staff are generally friendly and good. I just don't care for their food that much. The sides are good. My ribs sucked but my mac and cheese was great. As are the freebie rolls. Kind of sad that I like the sides more than the main dish. But if you are going to advertise yourself as smokehouse, inhouse made bbq sauce, etc., I'd expect a modicum of tastiness to the meat.

All in all, my 4th time and I still hate going. Until the next time when I get dragged to this place again for a get together, birthday, or whatever event; I'll get ready to eat more biscuits.

1st check out pic of the bbq slow roasting...thought that thing was for show...ha
I love the beef ribs here better than all the other bbq places around the valley...I've tried just about them all.  Quality and always well seasoned, not overly sauced when served and never over cooked.
 Im told the pork are better than the beef...by my roommates... unfortunately, I don't do swine..so gotta take their word for it.
Oooh-wee...the sweet tea is on point and served in huge mason jars...the fried pickles are always a good place to start for apps..artichokes were pretty good as well...could've been a tad bit more done.

BAD
Called ahead for reservations (4 ppl) requested a high chair, as well.  When we were sat the host must have not known we were in a  *fire zone* booth.  Because after apps we requested the chair then we're told we can't have it due to fire code and blocking  walk area?  Well...you sat us hear?? Didn't offer to change tables...weird?

Manager came by later and apologized for inconvenience and removed 20% off bill. Nice but passing an infant back n forth taking turns eating sucks...would've given the service a solid 4 star but the service short fall bummed down to a 3.5..

I'm very skeptical about franchise BBQ spots. But, what stands out to me about both places is the flavor of Gumbo. The people I was with also enjoyed the Gumbo. I can only imagine if they had crab in it. 

However, the burnt ends, was a major fail. Wasn't burnt and all Fat. Not much flavor to it. The deviled eggs were just okay. 

So, I was told there's a Lucille's in Concord, Ca which is about a 30 min drive from me, I will try their actual menu there. Also found out the story of Lucille is actually made up.",2qrGhalrni65mGT12igdYQ,0,0,4,USHlD3ethSCtKZensniTGQ

We made a resevations for a party of us and we were seated quckly and all went good with this part of our night. Service was just not good at all! We had to wait forever for our drinks to come, they gave only one person our table of 12 and he was over whelmed because he had multiple other tables. He then took awhile to take our order and asked if we wanted to order appetizers, someone at our table ordered some for all.. 

We should have just placed our regular order at this point... We are now about an hour an half into dinner and our appetizers finally came and then he asked if we wanted to place our meal order. We did, knowing it was going to take a while why didn't he just place this together or sooner than the appetizers came? 

By the time our food came we were full on appetizers and drinks and honestly could tell you if it was amazing or not. 

Wish service was faster, we were here for 3 hours... Good thing the Jazz music was good towards the end or probably would have complained a little more while here..

not good for large parties

4958300,2013-10-24,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"After eating at the District Lucille's for years, I was expecting to like this location at least as much as I like the District location.  I will say, the bar is much nicer.  The seats are comfortable, you don't feel crammed, and there are plenty of TVs.  From where we were sitting, each guy was easily able to see his NFL game of choice.  

But, the food fell short of the District location.  The fried onion straws were pretty much the same, they needed seasoning.  But, I find this to be the issue at the District location as well.  My catfish po' boy, on the other hand, was nowhere near the quality I get at the District location.  The bread was tough, not quite stale, but certainly not fresh.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the sandwich, which comes with 2 sauces, was nearly dry.  So, I had to order more of each sauce (a remoulade and tartar sauce).  This wait caused the sandwich to cool down, which made eating it less pleasant when I finally got the sauces.  The macaroni and cheese was standard, it was similar if not exactly the same as the District location.

I'm sure I'll give the Red Rock Lucille's another shot.  The service was good, and like I said, it's a much better bar area.  But, I'll order something else and hope that this food is more similar to the food I've enjoyed for years at the District location.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,0,2,c3vsO4NDiyvfBYusaX_B-A

Before putting any BBQ sauce from the table the pulled pork didn't have ugh flavor it was pretty bland. I added my favorite of their BBQ sauce and it was fine. I'm an original BBQ sauce fan of theirs however I didn't realize they really depend on it for the flavor of their pulled pork.

My side was the honey peanut coleslaw and that was amazing. The garlic mashed potatoes was also delicious.

He wanted to take me to his very favorite place Lucille's and I was open to the suggestion. The resterant for lunch time was oddly pretty empty. Clean environment. The hostesses were giggling like little school girls. My client really wanted a bigger booth and it seemed like it was such a chore for the red headed gal to place us there.
   Our server was an awesome young man with glasses,he was quick and efficient. No complaints with him. Me and client both order different things. I happen to order the Wedge Salad,unfortunately it dose not specify on the menu it included a bacon on top, no big deal to me when I just sent it back when a female running server,brunette with short bobbed hair cut gave me the look of death. I read clients and work with people everyday so I can read people very well. She was reluctant but seemed mad. A minute later as we were placed in our booth next to the kitchen my client stops me and says do you hear them yelling in the kitchen about your salad. I was a little shocked but kept moving on because its my client's choice and I have big money running with this client business.
  My chicken was not cooked extra dry/longer when I had asked. I was not surprised about the other reviews I have seen on here. If the client wants to take me there again thats fine as its his choice but not mine in the future at any time.",L2-hLqX1stB9xD2aJCJMYg,0,0,2,PJAlC4wSc4AWduwS8qhNAg

5042166,2013-08-23,5,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"This place literally opened a few days ago!  I knew I had to rush home and write this review, so I can be the 2nd person to review this place! When searching for a  restaurant to eat at, today at work, my eyes came across this restaurant.  I'm super familiar with Lucilles BBQ and definitely feel strongly about their food.  I was super excited to try this new location out!

It's located right next to the Yard House in the Red Rock Casino.  Such a beautiful location to begin with.  When you walk in, the hostess station blocks the entire restaurant, almost creating a curious affect amongst guests.  Once you round the corner, you're taken into a backyard BBQ oasis!  Southern pictures, vintage dressers and leg lamps from Rocky Horror Picture Show adorn the restaurant. The middle focal point is definitely the bar.  Huge rectangular bar top dressed with flat screens playing sports games and other shows.  You can't help but stare at it.  The restaurant is created to look like you're on gramma's porch, then in her backyard, then in a garden and even a Bourbon style hotel.  This location is unlike any other Lucille's that I've ever been to.  SUPER COOL!

The staff.  Man, the staff is on point!  I know this location just opened, however, they are really paying attention to the detail.  The greeters are perky and friendly, the seaters wasn't afraid to strike up a conversation with us as he sat us.  Our server, Joshua, was super attentive, nice and personable.  Whatever we needed, he was there to help.  All the other servers and serving assistants, kept coming back to our table and offering any type of service that would make our experience that much better.  In fact, during dinner, I looked my party and said, ""wow, what I like is that they always come around and clear any dirty dishes so our table isn't cluttered.""  ON POINT.  The managers, Jessica, Chila and Jeff even came by to say hi.  

For dinner, we started with a full size order of the Southern Fried Dill Pickles for $6.49.  It came with 10 pickle spears, battered in spicy flour and deep fried.  This dish is accompanied with ranch dressing and creole mustard.  The batter is light and airy, the wedges aren't too sour, just right!  Juicy and delicious.  My favorite sauce, the creole mustard is flavorful and really enhances the overall taste.  Great dish.  For my meal, I got the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich for $11.99.  One of my favorite sandwiches!  Lots of small fried shrimp served on a fresh baked baguette with shredded lettuce, vine-ripened tomatoes, smoked jalapeno tartar sauce and spicy remoulade.  The shrimp was super crispy, sliced tomatoes and lettuce offered a very refreshing taste to the sandwich.  The tartar and remoulade makes you think it's spicy, but certainly not.  The combination of both sauces really takes this sandwich to a whole new level.  It's a huge sandwich and will definitely fill you up!

Between the food, biscuits and apple butter, and mason jars, this place is certainly the BEST BBQ WITH THE FINEST SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.  I'm so jealous of Summerlin residents.  I live in Henderson and frequent the District location.  This location is new, it's fresh, it's awesome!  When you're in the area, definitely check them out.

5050027,2014-04-02,2,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Long ago when I was a teen, Lucilles was my favorite, even though it was one of the few BBQ places available in the suburb I was in. I haven't eaten one in years so I was curious to try it and we were at Red Rock to meet some friends. 

We came during Happy Hour at the bar area which includes drink specials and discounted appetizers (everyday 4 ) Off that menu we got fried pickle spears which had good flavor and came crunchy and hot, but a bit harder to eat than pickle rounds as the batter flaked off. 

We shared a half chicken plus (2 meat) hot link and pulled pork platter. The chicken and hot link were decent enough, but the pulled pork was a dried out mess. It includes two sides; I enjoyed their baked beans as it was tangy and sweet and the potato salad was standard, but good. We upgraded our biscuits to cornbread which was a generous portion and I enjoyed it. 

I enjoy the fact they have various kinds of sweet tea and lemonade. I had the watermelon tea which is mildly flavored with fresh watermelon and doesn't come sweetened but very good. 

Service was rather good. She checked on us, we got drink refills and the check all before we needed to ask for it. 

I find I enjoy more their sides than their BBQ here. I find that their BBQ taste just fine and that there are better BBQ spots out there. Is it weird that they have a indoor smoker and it doesnt smell of even a hint of smoke? I think I might stick to a la carte sides, appetizers during happy hour and their flavored teas and lemonade.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,3,H7L8HcrgFOOi78e_Hgj47Q

5102421,2016-06-21,15,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"I love BBQ. I was borned and raised in Oklahoma--so you can't NOT love BBQ coming from there. 
I've had some amazing BBQ in my life from all over the US. Is this the best? No. Is it good? Yes. 
Some reasons why this place is one of my favorites in town:
The food is consistent. 
They have great BBQ sauce. 
Their burnt ends are delicious. 
Their sides are great. 
Their biscuits are fucking amazing. 

I've pretty much tried all of their meats here. They're all very good. I would like a little more tenderness to it or a smokey flavor. But it's not going to change. They're great for what they are. And for the price you pay, you get a heeping portion. So for us people who love to gorge or have leftovers--it's great. 

They're service is always hit or miss. Numerous times we've been here, the hotesses aren't the most friendly. They don't even greet you when you walk in--or they don't tell you they'll be with you in a minute. We've stood there awkwardly for awhile sometimes. 
Their waiters aren't the best either. Either they're amazing or they suck horribly. 
The bartenders have always been awesome though. So I prefer to sit at the bar if we don't have other people with us. 

Overall, if we want BBQ and don't want to drive far; we come here. There are some amazing joints in town for BBQ. This one sits right below the amazing ones.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,20,19,4,zLc1OIZXqgZv8ZqcFim96g

Kinda dry, kinda lacking a masterfully applied smokey flavor, kinda skinny on the meat, which would be forgivable, had they rocked in the flavor department. Skinny fries were good. Cold slaw decent, didn't suck, no wow factor either. I had to go find my own damn silverware and napkin. Not once did the server ask if I wanted a refill for my beverage. It was exactly what I expected, pure mediocrity across the board, including 90% of the half assed attempt of outsider folk art on the walls and watered down blues on the sound system.

5165500,2014-07-02,2,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Awesome BBQ! This place is giving Phil's a run for their moneyyy in terms of sauces. First of all, the restaurant was huge and really clean. Our waitress was really nice! She even explained the 3 different type of sauces available &general info about Lucille's. She started us off with freshly baked biscuits. These were no ordinary biscuits though. Some may argue that the bread was ""hard"" but I felt that it was necessary to have them a bit sturdy rather than having them fall apart. It had butter and some type of sugar? on top. Not sure what it was but it was something different and definitely tasty! Their sweet tea was good too, all their drinks were served in mason jars btw, so hipsters rejoice. Also note that they do serve their drinks in shareable portions. 

Onto the food: We got the ""BBQ Lunch Platter"" [$16]. Came with baby back ribs (3 bones, normal or St. Louis rub) AND ""your choice of two of the following: pulled pork, brisket burnt ends, tri tip, hot link, rib tips or one quarter smoked chicken"" (from the website) PLUS a side. I opted with the normal baby back ribs- juicy and fall of the bones type- & brisket as well as tri tip. All great choices! Their mac & cheese was cheeeesy just the way I like it. Tasted their potato salad too, Phil's won in that department by a long shot. Now in terms of sauces, Phil's has more of the tangy-spicy taste whereas Lucille's has the tangy-sweet taste which I liked better.. In terms of size & tenderness, I feel like Phil's is better.

The hubs and I aren't crazy BBQ fans but on occasion we are down for some Southern cookin.  We decided we'd place an order at their convenient takeout counter located towards the front of the hotel (just so you have a reference point) and go home so we could binge watch and get fat together!

There was some mad crazy live music going on as the takeout counter is near the bar.  The big guy had a great voice and was fun, meaning he was getting the crowed included.  It was way to freaking loud though. Like hello....I'm trying to place my order here, ya'll!  Anyway let's get to how friendly the girl was who took my order.  I had to wait for a guy in front of me who was having payment issues then I had to wait for her to take a phone in order.  Finally it was MY turn! Hallelujah!  

The order was simple.  Hubs wanted jambalaya and said it was AWESOME!  He's not so easy to please to this means a lot!  I wanted the southern fried chicken but I didn't want to deal with bones.  Guess what!???  It doesn't come with bones! It's 2 gigantic chicken breasts lightly fried and covered in gravy!  Amazing!  It was perfectly prepared.  Since this was a to go order everything came on the side.  That was great so nothing got soggy.  I asked for a baked potato instead of the garlic mashed and I'm happy I did.  That baker was so good! I asked for extra gravy, they obliged!  The entire order was prepared exactly as I had ordered and tasted so good!  Lucille's, you've out done yourself!  We will be back or better yet, we may be doing UberEATS!

It came with a cream gravy which was okay....nothing special though.  The chicken was crispy but not hugely flavorful.  Finished the meal with the banana pudding for dessert.

Are you sure you don't want any dessert?  Otherwise, efficient.  

I ordered the tri-tip salad and my partner the gumbo.  It was long in coming, though not very busy during our time there (1:00-2:00).  The chef must have dumped a half cup of salt into that gumbo because it was not edible, so he ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  It didn't come til' I was done with my salad & unfortunately fell apart in his hands because of a too-old crumbly bun (which he ate anyway, out of hunger).  It had cheese on top which I'd not seen on a BBQ sandwich.  My salad had 4 very thin slices of not espec. tantalizing tri-tip & a sweet dressing over gourmet greens w/red & yellow bell peppers & red onion slivers.

5357400,2017-08-10,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que is decent but overpriced. Let's be real for a minute, this place is a chain, and as much as I like coming here for quick BBQ it's still turn and burn, get people in and get people out as fast as you can for as much money as you can. I wouldn't say that it's the fast food of BBQ that would be taking it too far but it really is as close as you can get to it without crossing that line. When I say it's overpriced i'm saying it's overpriced for what you're getting because it's not the best quality food or cuts of meat for the price you pay. For example, the Grilled Salmon here at Lucille's is $22.99 and one of my favorite items on the menu. It's a salmon fillet seasoned and hickory smoked or grilled. Served with New Orleans mustard cream sauce, Creole rice and fresh vegetables. It's good but it's not wild caught, and for $22.99 it should be. If places like Bone Fish Grill can sell Fresh Wild Caught Sockeye Salmon for $24.00, then so can Lucille's but they won't. I guess that's what happens when your business is solely profit driven. For these prices the meat should be grass fed with no hormones or antibiotics, the chicken should be organic free range, the fish should be wild caught. I'm not really trying to harp on Lucille's because I do enjoy their food I'm simply stating that they are absolutely overpriced for what you get that's all. Anyway back to the food the hot links are great and something I always order regardless of what entr√©e I order. One of my favorite things to order is the Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich slow smoked, Certified Angus Beef tri tip, hand carved, tossed in mop sauce and piled on a soft brioche bun. When it comes to BBQ I like to order the Smoked BBQ Half Chicken which is a house favorite. Half of a fresh chicken, marinated in their lip smackin' BBQ sauce for 24 hours, slow smoked to perfection and finished on the grill. When it comes to ribs they offer three different types Baby Back Ribs, St. Louis Spare Ribs and my go to personal favorite is their BBQ Beef Ribs. My two favorite sides are the Cornbread and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and when the Cornbread is hot and fresh it's delicious.

The salmon was cooked perfectly and was the right size for lunch. I asked for some changes to the menu and was cheerfully accommodated. The hubby's sweet potato fries were overcooked and was a skimpy portion. His ribs platter was a mix bag. Some of it was tasty and some was overcooked. Next time I will go back to the BBQ chicken salad. We had excellent service.,YCkRZrpcLi177y5wUSQX2w,0,0,3,MuJruJu2lwGs_j0Lxc-kwA

My hubby loves bbq and I love dessert, so we headed to Lucille's the other night. The wait was supposed to be 15 minutes, but we were seated after 30 minutes. The restaurant was maybe 2/3 full and the service was super slow. I ordered the ""Famous"" Banana Pudding and the hubby got the 1/2 chicken and two meats with two sides. He liked his food with the exception of a random piece of zucchini in his pulled pork. I had asked for my Banana Pudding to come out ASAP since my blood sugar was low. It didn't come out til my husband was halfway through his meal even though I ordered it as soon as we sat down. The waiter apologized and said that the first one fell on the floor and they had to make a new one. That happens, I get it...but it doesn't take 30 minutes to put together a new Banana Pudding. What I wasn't crazy about was this:
1- the pudding was at room temperature - which tasted really weird.
2- I asked for them to go light on the whipped cream, but it was served with tons of whipped cream.
3- there were only two tiny banana slices on top of the whipped cream and none in the actual dessert. Any other banana pudding I've ever gotten had bananas in the mix.

Overall, I still can't recommend this place. The waiters have no energy, the food is served without pride and I don't think the food justifies the prices charged.",WW3Jj78hqYyjEvXliM8aSA,3,2,2,eQsvsF-x6xgc9nMDwXlc-A

Manager Rebekah reached out to us to show their concern. It is rare that management does this, so I upgraded their review. We will be giving this restaurant a second chance, so the review could change again. 



So sad to have to leave a negative review, but our visit was just awful. Our waitress was so rude. We were a large party, which apparently annoyed her. She took our order and went off. We didn't see her again until she brought our salads, which had no dressing. We waited another 15 minutes to get someone to bring us dressing. They brought the dressing with our meals. So that ruined the point of the salad. Then I had to take my kiddo to the bathroom & the waitress took my almost untouched meal and threw it away because ""she thought I was done"". No apology, no offer to bring me anything else. Such a disappointment. We have been to this location a few times and the service was AWFUL!

Lots of places use animal fat so I wanted to make sure these didn't have any. I asked the woman waiting the table behind us because ours was no where in sight. She said she didn't know and would go ask for me. After she walked past the table a few times we assumed she wasn't going to answer. Then the manager brought our food to our table. So I asked him, he went and checked and came back in one minute. He was very nice. We were talking about how the chips in lots of places fry then in the oil they cook the chicken in. While eating the fries. We decided to ask and our waitress said oh yeah I didn't even think of that when you ordered. So I just stopped eating.

We got there before the dinner rush so we were able to get a table right away even though it was a Friday night.  Our waiter came by and took our drink orders quickly.  He then brought the drinks and took our food order.  It took a bit of time to get a basket of biscuits but I think they had to cook another batch.  

For our entrees, I did the two meat combo with pulled pork and burnt ends.  My sides were the peanut coleslaw and mixed veggies.  The veggies normally come with peppers in them but I was able to exclude those.  Good sign that they don't pre-make the veggies.  Everything was delicious.  I loved both meats and the coleslaw had a good vinegar bite.  It was a large portion so I was able to take half of it home for lunch the next day.  

Mom had a half rack of ribs with corn on the cob and beans.  She really liked everything especially the fresh corn.  Definitely no frozen corn on the cob here.

So definitely a great place to get your BBQ fix.  The service can be hit or miss but we had good service this time around and the food was yummy!",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,0,0,4,ySujF_xpYdHzMh4_VezshQ

5612288,2015-05-30,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience.     Long story that isn't worth the time to get into b/c I wouldn't go back to this place.   Please DO NOT mistake this for the Lucille's in Henderson which I actually love.  But this place is run by a bunch of idiots and the stupidity trickles down through all of the employees that we dealt with.  

Showed up and told the hostess that we were there for happy hour (for the food).  We had 2 young kids with us so sat us in a booth just outside the bar area but technically in the main dining area.  Settled in... got daughter #1 in a booster seat and daughter #2 stayed in her car seat so had to adjust the booth a bit to get her to fit in... but took a few minutes to get settled.  

Waiter comes and takes our drink order.   We ask about the happy hour menu for some appetizers and he says that happy hour is only in the bar area.  We explained to the waiter that we told the hostess that we were there for happy hour.  So we asked if kids were allowed in the bar area.  He said that they were.  

So we looked around and there were maybe 4 or 5 other tables occupied in the entire place as it was an off time of the day... maybe 3 pm or so.  So we simply asked if it was really a big deal for them to make us move our kids, drinks, menus and all of that stuff.   He said that happy hour needed to be rung up in the bar.  So we just asked if he could just ring our order in at the bar.  He said that he wasn't allowed b/c of his manager.  We asked if we could speak with the manager.

He tracked down his manager within earshot of our table and we heard the manager basically tell him that wasn't an option and he wasn't going to come all the way over to our table to tell us that....  of course he had a bit of an attitude that he was being asked such a crazy request.  So the waiter came back to tell us what he said and we stopped him and said that we want to talk to the manager... so we insisted that he actually make him come over to talk with us.

We repeated our request to the manager and explained that we weren't trying to be difficult but seems like a fairly simple problem with a fairly simple solution.  So he gave us the line that if he makes an exception for us... then he needs to make an exception for everybody...  so again... we look around the restaurant to see the 4 or 5 other tables that were occupied which were all in the bar except for 1 couple finishing up a couple tables away from us.  I explained that there wasn't anyone else in the bar to worry about and thought it was silly that a ""manager"" cannot make a basic customer service decision like this.  He insisted that it was not possible....  So my wife and I debated whether we wanted to move to a new table or just leave.  Again... with 2 kids and a hot day... just decided to move to another table since we were starving.   

So we get a new waitress b/c it is her section and she chooses to make sarcastic remarks from the very beginning about us having issues.   Took our order and gave us the bare minimum in terms of service.   We had to flag down random people for drink refills and the food came out all at once (appetizers and main course)   Food wasn't prepared well... but what's the point of complaining at this point.  So we laughed it off... got sarcastic with the waitress towards the end... left her a big fat Zero for a tip and won't be back.  

It is crazy what a night and day difference the Red Rock location is versus the Henderson location.   And for what it's worth....  it seems that we get poor service at just about every restaurant at the Red Rock Casino which is disappointing b/c it is such a nice place.   But seriously.... 10 years I have been in town and probably 5 or 6 restaurants there have consistently bad service.  This has been the worst by far!",mmAcpelY5OdTLgwjDDB6Lw,1,0,1,vN5rAlsm9oGfUnjkGaXRjQ
5620597,2017-01-09,3,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"The kind of place that everyone can find something to chow down on, Lucille's BBQ is popular with my extended family.  With a party of 11, we came here last night for my cousins' birthday dinner at their choosing.  Located at Red Rock Casino, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant so you don't even have to enter the casino unless you have to use the restroom because there aren't any in Lucille's. Reservations were made in advance and we were seated at a long table that accommodated all of us quite easily.  I've been to this location before with friends who also chose it for a celebration, it may have been a birthday, too, but I don't remember.  What I do like about this place is that the service is excellent.  I want to give a special shout-out to Miles, the staff member who was assigned to our table last night.  This guy took care of our larger group from beginning to end and was especially attentive to my littlest cousins who sat at one end of the table together.  Miles took their orders, crouching down to speak to them at their level and treated them, 7 and 9 year olds, with as much courtesy as he did the adults.  

As for the food, the menu is the huge kind with loads of choices.  We started off with their biscuits and apple butter that came out fresh and hot.  They're hard to resist so why try?  I had the BBQ half chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries.  Between the chicken, some of the mashed potatoes, plus a biscuit, it was more than enough food for me and it was all good.  My son ate the fries which he requested because his pulled pork sandwich only came with one side and he wanted more.

Miles checked on us often and everyone had a satisfying meal. When I asked him to take a group picture of us at the end, Miles wanted to clear some of the table off first so it didn't look so trashed plus he took more than one picture:  this guy knows what he's doing.  I would definitely recommend this location if you're a fan of Lucille's for the wonderful service and hearty food.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,4,ilETXU-trdL7e6BB5E-tEQ

For food - we ordered the brisket sliders, rib tips, and baked artichoke appetizers.

Rib tips were meaty and good. Again, too much sauce to cover up the flavor of the actual smoky goodness of the ribs. 5/10

Baked artichoke was overcooked, and also covered with so much garlic that it didn't quite taste good. I love artichokes, but this one neither of us finished a half. 2/10.

Mine were a little hard by the time they got home and not as good as they could have been.

Everything else was divine!  Baby back ribs, St. Louis rib tips appetizer, mac and cheese off the chains and cornbread (YUM).  We will definitely be back soon.",eHagJ19fXF6cim1QgryeEA,0,0,4,baT35rJyDufWpUKdrtKrvA

Friendly staff but biscuits were rock
Hard, ribs and pulled pork were tough!

Shoestring onion- 5 stars. So gooooood.

5831885,2014-05-19,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Because our first visit was amazing, we went back for a second time only a week after.

The second time wasn't as great as the first. Our bartender didn't seem as genuine as we would have hoped. This could have been perhaps she didn't think we were locals, but I guess that could be expected in a casino restaurant. 

We also noticed that the restaurant doesn't have a restroom! You have to walk into the casino to use the facilities :( 

Beef ribs were much more fatty that I had remembered and because our last visit was so great, we didn't realize that this place is pretty expensive!

We'll be back, but be much more picky about our visits.",imUgKz_a1y8gWkDw8btwgA,1,0,4,IqGfZuy-z4zyafrqvjE10Q

5916653,2017-06-20,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,Over hyped BBQ Forsure. This place Is Forsure without s doubt an average BBQ joint. Being located in Red Rock Casino you'd think it would've fall alongside the line of other places to eat inside the casino ate all pretty good. Only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is cuz the service was very great . Friendly staff and warming attitudes. Just a bummer of small portions and not too special of sauces they used on the ribs and all. Maybe yard house next time will do !,SaCb2s1SnXuOgG6OCMLurQ,0,0,3,pdwL3d9lcdinUPLqrgMsDA
5919752,2018-03-13,0,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,This place is inside the Red Rock casino and it's quite roomy.  We walked quite a ways to get to our table. I ordered the three meat combo and most of my meat was a bit dry. I did try the gumbo and that was quite tasty. I also ordered the smokehouse margarita and the drink was a bit savory and good. They offer 3 different types of sauces on the table and most are in the mild side.  If you have a players card they offer buy one get one free meals.,6eml0Mw8NglMn2GCyJzi-w,1,1,3,Qr5K3L1mQ_277veYzNuzfQ
5922526,2014-04-23,2,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"Worst service and some of the worst good I've had. Idk what their standard is, but I suppose if this is it, then I'm not impressed. The ribs were so dry, we needed extra sauce to drown it out. The drinks were extremely sweet with practically not trace of alcohol. The gumbo was alright. The Irish nachos needed something to moisten or flavor them otherwise were bland. The waiter took our food menus away after taking our drink orders, forgot the silverware and got some of the order wrong. He even tried to reason out why it was a bad day. I'm in the service industry myself and it's simple and plain; if you're having a bad day, the customer doesn't care. No excuses. It sounds like all I'm doing is complaining but I'm really trying to be understanding and optimistic, but sad to say I won't return.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,5,1,1,DnygzLiQwrRPoB-UKrReZw

Guys, it's a barbecue place, you gotta do better than that. The beer came about 30 seconds before the food which does not mean he beer took a long time, it means the food came out in less than five minutes. Do I look like a bum you have to rush out? At least the food was good, the brisket with beans (not corn or baked potato) and greens.

5928903,2014-10-16,1,vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,"I haven't been to a Lucille's for a pretty long time. I would say the last time was 4-5 years ago when I lived in California and when it was actually really good. The husband and I were at Red Rock and we decided to eat here, since we ate at Yard House not too long ago at The Linq. We were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon, but service was a bit slow. Our waitress was friendly and always had a smile on her face, but it seemed like she disappeared for a long time while we were waiting. She also forgot about the beer that my husband ordered, so we had to remind her when she brought out our food.

I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and geez, they were horrible! The sweet rolls were very soggy from the beginning. I decided to push those off to the side and just eat the pork by itself. But then the pork was waaayy to salty. It was like they went overboard with the sauce, then decided to dump even more salt over it! Even the sweet potato fries were very salty and over cooked. I can't remember what it was called, but my husband ordered some kind of meat combo and said it tasted fine. So I'm not sure if I just happened to come in on a day that the pulled pork was pure crap? 

The only highlight of this place was the sweet tea and the Totsie Roll Pops, so 2 stars for that! After we finished eating, there were flies flying around our food. I understand that the restaurant has no control over that, since they can come in whenever someone opens the doors, but it's still annoying. At least they weren't around while we were eating.

Well, I gave Lucille's another chance, but won't be back! There are definitely better bbq places here in Vegas! It's sad how this chain has gone sooo downhill.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,1,2,BghU5jarHiSFSX7zRGnBkg

We were seated in a booth - not given a choice - happy hour menu was ON our table but told we could not order happy hour because we were not in the bar ?!?  So we asked to be moved to the bar and ordered happy hour appetizers. 
Guys - don't put a menu on my table if I can't order from it.

Once we got reseated in the bar area where we could enjoy the happy hour discount we thoroughly enjoyed the food and drinks.   
Deducting ONE star for the large happy hour special.  Started off poorly but made up with the BBQ.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,2,1,3,w19DW9Zv3q9phJXb167r3w
