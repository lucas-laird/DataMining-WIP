Based on some good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Salvatore's a try. Walking in you get the distinct feeling of an old school Italian restaurant. There was a pianist playing a Sinatra tune when we walked in. The servers were all wearing white shirts with black vests. Our server, Lisa, came to our table immediately to take our drink orders. She was also quite helpful in answering questions about the menu. I elected to have the spaghetti with sausage. The spaghetti came with a very tasty red sauce. The portion was quite generous. Overall, the dish was good although not great. My wife chose the ribeye special. They cooked it exactly as she ordered. However, it was quite chewy, or as she put it, Heimlich material.

We were finally seated in the middle of the restaurant and had an older guy as our waiter, i think he was italian.  We eventually got our water and had to ask for bread and eventually were able to place an order.  I order the Fettuccine Toscano and a salad.  The salad was half covered with dressing and i had to ask for more and the pasta was just ok.  About half way through the fetticcine, i found a small band aid in my food.  I alerted the waiter and he immediately pulled a flashlight out of his pocket, grabbed my fork and started sifting through the dish.  He then said ill give you a free desert.  I told him i didnt want a desert.  He then took off with the plate.  He brought us the bill and told me he took one of the glasses of wine off the bill.

2434720,2011-11-14,2,zFzuJf6G8l1YWjqcmu_PgA,"I had dinner here on Wednesday nite, 11/9/11.  The place is very nice, but casual.  The dining area is nice enough, but they have a pretty small and crappy looking bar area.  Really bad in my opinion for a nice restaurant.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had three dinner companions and they agreed with me.  One had the seafood special, another person had the pasta special, and I had the osso bucco, which was another special for the night.  As the followers of my post know, osso bucco is my all-time favorite meal, and whenever I see it on the menu of where I am dining, I have to have it.  I must tell you that it was good, but not outstanding.  It was served over fettuccine noodles, which is the way I like it, but the sauce (gravy) was not very flavorful and the meat was dry.  The portion was of nice size, but the shank and the sauce was mediocre at best.   

I took two bottles of $130 wines for us to drink, since I looked at the wine list ahead of time and they did not have any decent wines -- another deficiency if you ask me.  How can you have a nice, higher end Italian restaurant and not have decent wines to select from?  And they did not have any decent scotches  either.  I wanted a scotch before dinner, but they only had mediocre and standard scotches; no higher end or aged scotches.  Again, WTF???  So when the waiter noticed my displeasure with the crappy selection of scotches, he asked me what I was looking for.  I told him any high end stuff, at least single malt, minimum age level of 18 years, preferably 25 years.  He said he had something very special and if I wanted to try it.  ASSUMING THAT THE A-HOLE knew what he was talking about, I said, sure, bring it to me.  So he brings me one shot, neat, in a big, wide, stemless Cabernet glass.  So I start to drink it and it was nice, but it did not taste like scotch.  In a moment my mind tells me that this is cognac and I call the idiot waiter over and he agrees.  Before I start to chastise him, my host, the casino boss, interrupts and tells me to forget it and he will handle the problem later.  Now I think that kind of problem is significant from not only a customer service perspective but also from an economic perspective -- from both a customer's and the casino's point of view.  Especially since was a shot of Louis XIII cognac at $160 a shot.  Lucky I was not paying for this because I would be super pissed if I was.

So although this snafu is part of my displeasure with this establishment, my rating is primarily based upon the mediocre food, crappy bar area, and crappy selection of cocktails.",v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw,2,1,3,yIQi_ZwB3iMLu0lp41AXaA

Service is great, from the Maitre D who seems to know everyone, to wait staff who are friendly and courteous, and bus staff who clear plates and keep waters filled in a timely fashion. Just a pleasant experience, at a reasonable price point. 

It gets busy early with the Sun City crowd, so reservations aren't a bad idea. There's a crooning piano player who is quite entertaining, the bar makes a nice Dirty Belvedere Martini, wine selection is good, and Mayors Carolyn and Oscar Goodman are frequently spotted (and applauded) dining here.

2800361,2017-04-20,0,zFzuJf6G8l1YWjqcmu_PgA,"This is perhaps the best Italian restaurant we have found over two years of living and dining in Las Vegas, and that includes many of the fancy Strip restaurants.  Salvatore's is really good food in a comfortable setting.

I started out with the crab tower, and it was towering indeed in both size and flavor.  My wife started with her favorite Caprese salad, and it met her high expectations.  My second course was the Pasta e Fagioli which was pretty good.  I still haven't found a Pasta e Fagioli in Las Vegas as good as my favorite version in Los Angeles (at Il Moro, if you're wondering), but this was better than most.  My wife had the lobster bisque which was good, but not great.  For the entree I had a pasta dish with sausage and cheese (it was an off-menu special, and I can't recall the name, sorry).  It was excellent and plentiful.  My wife had Linguine with Clams, which was also very good.  All in all the meal had the comfort food vibe that I like in Italian, rather than striving for the trendy, high-end fare that has crept into many Italian places.  I look forward to trying the Veal Parm next time.

The ambiance is good old-fashioned Vegas.  No faux, old Italy checkered table cloths, nor the modern hipster decor that you will find at, say, Giada's on the Strip.  No, this is just a comfortable room with wood paneling and low lighting - perfect for a romantic evening and quiet conversation.  The piano player / Italian crooner at the bar stuck to Sinatra standards, including the Great American Songbook stuff that I love.

The service was prompt, although a bit chaotic at times.  The wait staff brought out our soup course before we had finished our salads, which was a bit awkward.  But our waiter was both helpful and visible - enough so that the service does not detract from my five star rating.  What really seals the deal on the five star rating is the price.  I have had worse Italian food that cost twice as much at high end Strip restaurants.  (See my reviews of Rao's and Lupo, for example.)  The drinks were generous and not over-priced.  So, a very satisfying and affordable meal.  Give it a try.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,2,2,5,Xl-bpBBjQm1OlO2thxmDvA

The italian chopped salad
Beans and greens
Parmesan encrusted sole
Clams and mussels (and ... OMG, the broth must be sponged with the bread)

I would have expected to pay that at Flemings but not at a casino restaurant like this one.  The restaurant had a lot of empty tables so no reason for the poor service.

However, when you walk through the doors of this place, you see where they are hiding the class.  What a nice place.  I love the fact that the doors are closed so the noise and the cigarette smoke does not linger into the restaurant.  You wouldn't even know that it's attached to a casino, if you didn't have to enter and exit through it.  The food is good.  Is it exceptional, not really.  It's really, really good.  I had one of the specials which was Spinach and Cheese Ravioli in an Alfredo sauce.  They said it was an appetizer, but it was filling enough to be an entree.  I also had the Tomatoes Caprese.  It was ok.  I was thrown by the red onions on the plate that are not mentioned on the menu.  I don't do onions at all.  And they don't belong on this plate.  My Dad had the regular Cheese Ravioli with Pomodoro Sauce (Tomato sauce with spices) and it comes with a regular salad.  Also, the bread they serve is outstanding.

My personal favorite is the Gnocchi of course.  I always get it, either as an appetizer/side or an entree.  This past visit was no different.  I got it as a side dish and had the Spaghetti and Meatballs for my entree.  Both were awesome.  The Better Half and I split the Mozzarella alla Caprese for our appetizer, which was perfect.

Service here is very good.  There are a couple of servers that we remember and they stopped by our booth to say hello.  We miss this place.

My meal and I'd order the exact same thing again was some complimentary fresh baked bread, a side salad with some of the best Italian dressing I've had and the most excellent clam linguini in red sauce (the red sauce was a tip from the waiter).

The service started out very good, but towards the second half of the meal the waiter (Tony) basically disappeared.  By the time he returned to the table it was too late for a second glass of wine, and we had finished our coffees before dessert arrived.  We had to remind him that we needed change for our bill, he said he'd be right back, we waited another 10 minutes before he managed to return.  We will definitely dine here again, but will ensure we sit in another server's section.",TV0rz0EB1_z6RTA19YdDWg,0,0,4,ep957yqwFzcl6G-cdgnxuA

I was immediately taken by the change in customer service when I arrived.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table or booth.  Both of these seat 4 people.  I glanced toward the small bar area and saw small, high top bar tables, and I asked if I could sit there because I was alone.  I was told I could wherever I wanted and she escorted me to a table there.  There is a high cushioned bench running along the wall.  Once you get up on the bench, there's a raised platform for your feet so you can be very comfortable at these tables.

Tami, the bartender, took my order and checked on me after every course was delivered to see if there was anything she could do and to see if I was satisfied with my meal. 

When ordering, I asked if the soups were cups or bowls.  Being told they were bowls, Tami then said, ""But we can do a cup of soup for you.""  I ordered the Italian wedding soup that I haven't had in a long time.  For the main course, I chose the veal picatta.   And, they give you choice.  You don't have to take pasta with every entree.  I opted for vegetables that included some roasted potatoes.  That's what I mean by the change in customer service.

Dessert was a tough one.  There were so many choices I wanted to stay for a few desserts. I decided on the classic mud pie, and it was great!  Cookie crumb crust, at least 3 inches high with coffee ice cream, drizzled with chocolate, and accompanied with some fresh strawberries and a raspberry and blueberry.  

I think it was a bit pricey as others have mentioned.  I was quite pleased with the taste of the food and the service was the best!  I will be back, this time with company.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,2,4,POFRbAAmoTDD5QadvLziVw

Salvatore's is a fine dining Italian restaurant. From the moment you walk in to the moment that you walk out you're treated the way you should be in any fine dining establishment. You're greeted, seated and treated amazing. They had a gentleman on the piano singing and jamming away. Ambience was a nice change from loud, smokey room just outside.

Here's why I'm only rating this place 2 stars... It was my risotto. I don't know if I'm accustomed to the wrong version or they were trying to put their own twist in things but I'm used to risotto being cheesy and creamy this risotto had a tomato based sauce and maybe I would've their version-- if it tasted good but it didn't :(

Unfortunately I'd rather go to Olive Garden. But if I'm meeting someone for drinks and want a quiet and intimate place, this would be a 5 star experience :)",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,0,2,F8jo69XcpePN6CtY_YNosQ

4492782,2010-08-11,0,zFzuJf6G8l1YWjqcmu_PgA,"A friend wanted some Italian and some how we ended up at the Suncoast casino, after I remembered they had one next to the oyster bar after 2 other places we use to hit up have closed. The interior is nicely appointed with columns and capitals with sculpted walls to fit the booths. The place had a piano player today singing and playing Italian/American favorites like Sinatra and Dino. It looks like this place has stepped it up a notch since my last visit, the staff was attentive and came by regularly. My friend ordered the Chicken Francaise, his favorite if he can find it, and I tried the Veal Scaloppine al Marsala with a Caesar salad. The food was prepared nicely but mine was a little salty due to the wine I believe and the Caesar salad was OK but the Parmesan ""cheese bowl"" it came in was a little burnt and gave it a off taste. The tab was a little higher than I expected cause I thought the salad was included but was only for the house salad. For the two of us it was $84 before tip and no alcohol. Not too bad overall but priced higher than our old hang out.",T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,2,0,3,REaxilaxx3mEiX-6t-mzHA

My wife entree was chicken involitini - a chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto, spinach and mozzarella topped with a mushroom and tomato sauce while I settled on veal scallopini marsala. Both entrees were no better than average though the accompanying garlic mashed potatoes were good.  The restaurant was not quite full, yet the kitchen developed a back up with no explanation provided by our server until I inquired some 20 minutes after finishing our appetizer.

We ordered the lobster bisque and pasta e fagoli soups. The bisque wasn't the best I've had but not bad. The lobster pieces seemed chewy. The pasta e fagoli was really delicious and flavorful! I'd order that again.

We also ordered the seafood ravioli and risotto dish. The ravioli lacked a lot of flavor; like salt was missing. The risotto was cooked with the tomatoes and basil. I thought the risotto wasn't fully cooked through. It seemed crunchy, but my hubby said it was the onions that were crunchy. I'll have to disagree. 

My only criticism is that you can't substitute soup for a salad even for an up charge. 

I would go back to try other dishes.",g4NQ8YTArwKlCPQx2_GDVw,0,0,4,gMtmRdR4CnZZA1o1YZcBww
