The crust was firm but easy to fold for the chicken pesto but because of the meats on the Roman, it made the crust limp and a bit soggy. I would suggest getting the veggie style on this one.

Nothing wrong with that at all, I love when food tastes just the way I want it to! We ordered a whole pizza just to take up to our room. Was made fresh. The only problem was when the pizza was finished, none of the 3 people said anything to us. We were the only ones in the restaurant waiting and another table eating. Just a little rude from my perspective, especially when the 3 people were just talking and standing around while our pizza sat there.

It's not better than Joe's but you are still paying for the casino markup. Slices are large and of course reheated.

They have daily specials involving 2 slices with one topping but didn't have any vegetarian 1-topping slices available when I went.  They were even confused when I asked them to add a topping to my two cheese slices.

I got the Ham and Pineapple and although it was a little greasy, it was pretty good! Not bad for a small pizza joint! The slices were of good size but only wished they were a little bigger. I wasn't quite full from one slice but I know 2 would've been a little too much.

2459764,2015-12-30,0,5CJOaZc8Muu8WothauxQ4g,"Buyer beware...roll the dice!   

It looks like a cool place and it's nice to have options inside a hotel....but the food prep might not be all up to par and the customer service skills are poor at best - even from the owner!   Check out the type of demerits they got from the LV Health Inspection -- its all about food prep and temperature.  http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php  

Unfortunately for us, we found this only after our son got sick...here's our experience....

We ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza for my son, who didn't want to eat same dinner as us.   After eating only one of the two pieces of pizza, and a couple hours later, he got violently ill.   Ahead of the pizza, our group of 7 all ate the same things and places all day long with no illness.   SO, it was pretty easy to narrow it down to the pizza.   

When we called to report the issue, we experienced similar customer service issues as the other ratings have stated.  Our son got very sick that night and the owner, Nikki, was not all that compassionate or customer focused but rather defensive.    SO, maybe the employees take after the owners on this front.   This is not a hotel owned establishment - they only lease the space to the franchise.  

Nikki started with ""well what did he eat the rest of the day"" NOT ""sorry or how is he feeling now?""  

When we tried to explain to Nikki (owner) that it wasn't very busy last night, yet the staff seemed to have prepped a bunch of dough and sauce on trays, which were all sitting out in the open, she continued to defend that they had to prep a bunch of pizzas for the next day because there was a big order of 200 pizzas that they needed to cook.    First lesson in customer service.....LISTEN to the customer fully before thinking about your defensive reply.   

While waiting our turn we saw the food prep handler take one of the trays that had been sitting out in the open for some time (the sauce was all dried out), started to prepare it with cheese and other toppings its a clear sign that the night crew might not be following the proper process....but who are we to inform you as an owner of our experience, right?!?!?!

After several minutes on the phone with her, and the fact that she didn't want to hear what I had to say, I told her my husband would come down to talk to her in person.   Only then did she start asking what I wanted her to do?   REALLY?  Wow, you don't have any customer service skills!   She kept trying to insist that they did everything right and what did we want from her and that she wouldn't be there very long as she had to go to her other restaurant.   Again, I told her that we were in the towers and he would be right down to show her what he saw.   Only then did the first apology about our son getting sick come out, then she hung up without even saying ""good-bye"".    

I sent my husband down to talk to her in person, she continued to defend her process and never offered anything up only asking my husband what we wanted her to do -- he finally explained to her that the first thing she should have offered is at least a refund.   She agreed to refund us, but said that we would have to come back cause her cash drawer was not ready.    It is only $12 refund, but cost us a whole night of a kid throwing up and miserable with no compassion at all --- SO Nikki -- keep your $12 cause I can win that back on the high roller tables that I am playing this entire week.   

In light of all the food quality issues in the news lately, like Chipotle, you would think owners of food establishments would be a bit more savvy about how to handle these types of issues.   We were hotel guests, not just random off the street trying to scam a refund.   Nikki was told that we were guests here and you would think that might make a credible difference to listening to us.    NOPE!  

Good luck with your franchise and hope you learn to become more customer focused, cause it is a consumer focused world these days!   Take a look around... you aren't the only pizza joint in Vegas!!   I'm sure Hard Rock management will be interested to read this review as it affects their brand as well.",FMa9FMZVxk3v2xIWp7Zfcw,0,0,1,R8GT3k-KD7bzl24K6Dh7OQ

Luckily for us we were able to find Pizza Forte. Now we didn't get there til about 11:40 so the pizza that they had readily available was slim however we just needed a couple slices of cheese.

Upon going up to pay we were informed that they were doing a buy one get one promotion so we ended up getting 4 slices for $14. Knowing we would be near the strip we anticipated paying quite a bit for the night out so this was a pleasant surprise.

The pizza itself was very good and the people working were the evening were extremely pleasant. From order to receiving our pizza couldn't have been more than 5 minutes which was also nice after a night of being in crowds and lines.

Great pizza place for the tired and hungry after a show or gambling. The Hard Rock needed this place bad and PIZZA FORTE delivered big time.

Let me say they serve an entire pizza or by the slice so all your needs are satisfied. Slices very but you'll have a half dozen to choose from when the need is there. Keep in mind the slices are rather large so you may only need one. Also they serve hotdogs and tasty beverages. Limited menu so if your brain is detoxing or just not functioning you won't have to have to many choices to think about. And as for prices well 2 slices and a Coke was $13 so compared to what you blew in the casino, snorted up your nose or drank in the bar it's a cheap affair.

The restaurant is small like a hallway but again I just needed a grab n go meal. Saw the pizzas under the heat lamps.

Light sauce and lots of toppings. I do really wish it was a lot warmer though. Even throwing it in the oven for a few minutes would have made a big difference for me. Generous toppings compensated for lack of heat - but it needed to be hotter to at least mask the illusion of being fresh.

Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14"" or 18"" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.

Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.

Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.

I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.

The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.

If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,11,4,HE1FnXTXM0wXOGE_XnWnSA

It's not really competing. This is the greasy pizza place you stumble to during a show break at the Vinyl. That's exactly what I did, minus the stumblings. I started my drinking at PIzza Forte. Hard Rock has Goose IPA everywhere and this place was no exception. Beer will cost you around $7 bucks. Hey, at least it isn't the $10 inside the Vinyl. I only figured out the price when I gave the bartender a ten and never got change back...

Which pizza did I get? Greasy and meaty. Perfectly hits that carb spot. It's also the easiest to order when you only hear ringing in your ear. MEEEEEAT PIZZA! I'm sure there will be many more encounters with ol Pizza Forte.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,1,3,7c5LnwfVUSbHOJscQGMlFQ

Pizza Forte is simply a reheat in the oven type restaurant. You go in, pick the slice of pizza you desire and they'll warm it up in the oven for you. I'm sure the pizza is made fresh that day, I just don't know when. I ordered the Hawaiian slice and it was somewhat acceptable after a few Gin & Tonics at the bar. The crust was a bit tougher than I would like but like I said, it's the best option in the hotel after 12:00am. Perhaps the more you drink the better it'll taste. The price is around $6-7 dollars per slice depending on the amount of toppings. This price point is pretty common for a slice in Las Vegas. I might revisit Pizza Forte depending on how desperate I am next time. It's definitely not my first option if other restaurants are still open.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,0,0,3,X1QH5NupizExI7V_MxppHQ

Veggiterian - all the veggies on bread with cheese all over it. How can you not eat your veggies. Good and tasty. 

Spinach & Ricotta - now this was amazing. Great tasting pizza with the spinach cooked in to the pizza and the fresh ricotta cheese just oozing at every bite. Definitely a must try and would get it again.

Next time instead of the hassle of finding parking on the strip for pizza not nearly as good, we'll be coming here for sure.

Their hot dogs are also famous here & they have a little bar to stash some peppers, pickles, sauces, you name it. I'm a freak over pickles so I got a cup just a la carte for myself lol

Also the very thing I'm obsessed over in this place is the pistachio dessert. It's like a more firm pudding pie adorned with an almond crust & topping, it was delicious. I actually had it for breakfast & it was just perfect. 

I would give this place 5 stars but the only thing was that the pizza has to be eaten fresh. If it is, great. I brought it up to my hotel, did a few things, & it was cold even in a covered box. It was great reheated but the thin crust can't last too long. Also the entire place ran out of forks so I had to go next door to find one & I was so tired, lol.

Pizza Forte was really the only option that fit the bill on the premises of the Hard Rock. It's a small restaurant with a cramped layout and filled with all the carbs you could dream of. I went with a square Sicilian piece and my dude chose a caprese wrap. The tab came to the extremely reasonably price of $14  (considering it's inside a casino and all). 

The staff warmed up my pizza in the oven, but when I received my pizza it just looked like a brick of old dried out pizza. It was mediocre in every sense of the word. My husband was happier with his wrap. Pizza Forte definitely wasn't our first choice, but it got the job done and didn't break the bank. Affordability and convenience are key here.

Pepperoni Slice

Recently opened in Henderson, but already spawning a second location much closer to the family's eponymous home base, it was at the recommendation of father Gino that our party of four jogged across Paradise to visit Mimmo at Pizza Forte in the Hard Rock Hotel, and with Pantera playing loudly as we walked through the lobby it would not be long before the younger Ferraro greeted us warmly, every seat in the house filled as a steady stream of clubbers and concert goers filtered through for fresh slices from the electric oven and hotdogs the team will tell you are the best in town.

Already a hot-spot just six days into operation, the team turning out hand-tossed pies as needed into the wee hours of the night, Pizza Forte inhabits a shotgun space adjacent Nobu near the entrance to Rehab and with a short menu of Americana classics at expected Strip prices the effect of top-tier ingredients is immediately evident even before sinking teeth into the product, each slice glistening atop white marble while dogs, kielbasa, and sausages from Hofmann are presented on grilled rolls with a variety of condiments offered self-serve.

Opting for two slices of pie, plus an all-beef dog that was snappy and slightly smoky even as a naked frank, Forte quickly enters discussion as the city's best 'slice,' for although a touch oily as compared to that at Pop-Up at the Plaza the semolina infused crust is substantially more crispy without the slightest bit of charring, a remarkable feat that only serves to bolster the acid from a hand-crushed tomato sauce.

Equally impressed by a puffy Roman slice, the mozzarella's creaminess far more notable without pepperoni as diced tomatoes and shredded basil added  texture plus a mellow herbal tinge, it was with a single cannoli that a favorable opinion of Forte was further cemented, the crisp shell filled to order with airy ricotta straight from the refrigerator with a steep price of $5.00 similar to that of Buddy's version at Carlo's Bakery, but without all the pre-filled sog and hour-plus wait.

Obviously expensive compared to the slice shops sprinkled around Manhattan, but featuring a much higher quality product that most, Pizza Forte seems poised to mint money given its fanciful location - particularly considering the late night concert crowd and lack of other grab n' go options within the Hard Rock Hotel.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,9,4,zqh9FPTgsCI1NfvsaJ2nsA
