I asked for ice for my soda and the ice tasted like they scraped it from the freezer, ice taste like dirt! They fried the cheapest fish, not even tilapia. The only thing worth eating was the chicharon bulalak (yeah i know spelling). Save your 7.99 and go to Nany Glorias or Joy's on East Charleston.I should of known the food stunk especially when there was only 1 person eating the buffet. If you want to have the runs for a week, then i suggest you go to EPOY's......yuck! truly disgusting!",uOUVsZEvBPnDyTAG_Ta3aQ,0,0,1,ELD98hZVKE4zkMKyPlp68A

Super Cheap 7.00 
Quick and Easy
Cons 
Everything Else food is beyond fatty and greasy everything deep fried. Definitely felt my heart hurt after a little of the meal
Fried Chicken kind of tasty
Banana Egg rolls actually the bomb amazingly good
Ill never go back but glad I tried. My friend said if he was in the area and dying of hunger and happened to be right next to it he would try it again.
Lots of sketchy mystery meat",E3-bcRsTtyICecnHxJOGlw,0,0,2,QXh4OKUd5yKUBi1iTV3azw

Seeing lots of old flips that don't take the time to rate maybe a good clue that its good. Want some pakbet, BBQ or sinigang don't hesitate to eat here. Cheap and is Really one of the first original TURO-TURO'S in Vegas...nnn",C4Gcq7tkFlRn__yl11KNaQ,1,1,5,bHNDwvWRG7AgmZyRpEj2HA
