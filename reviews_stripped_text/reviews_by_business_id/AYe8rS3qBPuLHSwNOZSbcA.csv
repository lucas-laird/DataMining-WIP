I actually spit out some of the food i was served because it taste like it was out of a can and slimy i almost asked them to take it back but I'm not that kind of person to ask those things so i tried to order another roll but the servers were completely ignoring our table walking around when i finally caught someone i ordered the first date. Which wasnt as bad as the first roll but it had huge chunks of tofu soaked in soy sauce. Again not the biggest complainer and will eat almost any sushi so i ate it but to top off this night they handed us the check and the waitress literally stood there waiting for our payment and we stared at her until she left but all the servers were surrounding our table like sharks and kept staring at the check 5 servers came asking for the check and my mom was so irritated that they were surrounding us for our money but not even to get us water. After finally paying we left a $1 tip and swore we would never go back... Maybe we got them on a off day because i work retail and complainers is the last thing my family and i are but damn this place really is a no.",TIAunEhw1n-Bn3DrcOZQlg,1,0,1,AvMrT4cPCREEFJyRFypp9w

354539,2014-12-01,0,AYe8rS3qBPuLHSwNOZSbcA,"We have been to Sushi Loca a few times.  Mostly just for to-go sushi.

PROS: 

    -The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is good.  The decorations are attractive.

    -The actual sushi is good.

    -The waitstaff is friendly and helpful with the menu.

    -The soy sauce containers on every table are only low sodium.

    -Pretty food presentation.

CONS:

   -The music/restaurant was very loud.  I could barely hear the person across from me talking, which made conversation difficult.

   -NOT family friendly.  Last time me and my family went to eat there, there was a waitress with a headband that said ""f**k"" all over it.  Also, the menu has VERY suggestive names for the sushi with references to Viagra, orgasms, and ""Sex on the Beach"".  Not trying to be prude, but if you have a young kid that reads, it may not be the conversation you want to have at your dinner table when they ask what the words mean.

   -Could not find the website online.  They need to have website with the menu on it so you can call in your pickup order.

   -The waitress didn't come by the table enough.  We wanted to place our order and had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come over and get us drinks.  Then it took forever for them to come back to take our order.  We almost left.

  

They need to have a suggestion box so customers can give them feedback to improve.  Since they are a new restaurant, they should care.  I think Sushi Loca has great potential, and a great location, but they need to take steps to make it more family-friendly and accessible for more types of customers since they are in a mall.",8h1n9EAM36TO3gF4cHlydA,1,1,3,ApmxyVkKXiJRhOBFhcCRlw

What we ordered:
Yellowtail & Tuna sushi
Spicy yellowtail & tuna handroll 
Sushi Loca Special
Creamy Scallop Roll
Banzai Roll (to go)

The sushi had great flavor and didn't need any wasabi or soy sauce whatsoever. The handrolls were huge compared to other places I've frequented and I had to take one to go (I'm eating it as I'm writing this- yum)!  The Sushi Loca Special had spicy tuna and a garlic ponzu. The ponzu was unlike any other I have ever tasted before: lemony, garlicky, and lit my mouth up! The scallop roll had an interesting texture and a creamy mellow flavor. I brought home the banzai roll (cucumber, shrimp, crab, avacado, eel sauce) to the hubby and he devoured it in 2 minutes tops.

I dont care what a place looks like as long as its clean and the food is good enough not to stay home and cook. We have been here a few times since they opened so we hoped for some improvement. The funny thing is when you get thru the front door they think you speak korean or japanese for some reason. I'm thinking I have been around the world a few times but your in Summerlin a local town. Get your english on point. Keep in mind I do speak a few asian languages but your in America and most of your customers aren't Asian. Staffs customer service skills poor.  Order to go one time waiting at the front door and same the guy asked me twice if I have been helped. I said don't you remember you ask me a few minutes ago and I still don't have my to go order paid in full online. The place was empty on that day. On to the food Sushi is ok most of the time. However my wife made a huge mistake and ordered the Seafood Sukiyaki it was horrible. The seafood was farm salmon and a few other odd items I think one was brown / gray tuna. No shrimp for you and that will be $18 soup aka Sukiyaki.
We are going to stop going here and just order to go from another sushi bar that is more professional with less drama also I agree with another yelper the names of the rolls needs a serious creative change its NOT dance club its local sushi bar.

Sushi was good, but there are several restaurants nearby that are on par or better which  are cheaper/equal in price + good service. 
The service here is absolutely horrible. Upon arriving we were seated quickly in a mostly empty restaurant. The table next to us had been seated probably ten minutes before as there were two guests there and two more who arrived after we did. Upon initial order of food and drink, we were never helped again unless we initiated help with service through verbally asking. The table next to us received constant attention but the servers always had their back to us and never turned to ask if we required anything. One server took our initial order and we never saw her again. Two different servers were required to take additional requests, both of which made you feel as though you were troubling them. Our tables were never cleaned, waters never filled, check never came. Completely ignored. When asked for the manager, we were told there was none. When we complained about the service, was offered no apology. Finally, we got ahold of the manager, who said she was the owner, who's only offer of explanation was that it was busy, which is was not. No apology, no offer of compensation, just a bill and a verbal indication to not give a tip if we were unsatisfied with the service.  After giving us the bill, no one came to take it for several minutes. It was so appalling it was worth walking out on the check, but still I paid. I cannot express enough that the service here is terrible and I do not believe they care at all. I don't believe they care about any of these reviews and will continue on just as they do.

Sushi was good, but there are several restaurants nearby that are on par or better which  are cheaper/equal in price + good service. 
The service here is absolutely horrible. Upon arriving we were seated quickly in a mostly empty restaurant.

Upon initial order of food and drink, we were never helped again unless we initiated help with service through verbally asking. The table next to us received constant attention but the servers always had their back to us and never turned to ask if we required anything. One server took our initial order and we never saw her again. Two different servers were required to take additional requests, both of which made you feel as though you were troubling them. Our tables were never cleaned, waters never filled, check never came. Completely ignored. When asked for the manager, we were told there was none. When we complained about the service, was offered no apology. Finally, we got ahold of the manager, who said she was the owner, who's only offer of explanation was that it was busy, which is was not. No apology, no offer of compensation, just a bill and a verbal indication to not give a tip if we were unsatisfied with the service.  After giving us the bill, no one came to take it for several minutes. It was so appalling it was worth walking out on the check, bit still I paid. I cannot express enough that the service here is terrible and I do not believe they care at all. I don't believe they care about any of these reviews and will continue on just as they do.

Kind of like forced friendliness. But there was no problem and they did their job. 

So I have been on a mission to try fresh Uni for awhile and decided today's the day. I ordered a big order of assorted sashimi and boy they serve up some amazing sashimi here. The Uni was on that order. I have have always shy away from trying it because it look like it had a weird texture kind of like a younger but it didn't at all. I never thought that it would be so tender and so melt in your mouth but it was and I was hooked. The pieces were small but big enough to where I wasn't scared to try it. Thank you Sushi Loca for a great first time. 

The sashimi are very fresh and presented beautifully. The texture and the cuts of their fish was amazing. As for the specialty sushi rolls there was so many to choose from that I didn't k ow what to choose because they really all sound the same. The rice to sushi ratio was good and they flavors were on point. 

The chicken teriyaki dishes and sashimi salad was yummy as well and I loved their seaweed salad. Flavored well mixed perfectly and had a perfect crunchiness to it.

The service is good. Very nice wait staff. Attentive. For me, no amount of good service can overshadow the ""meh"" food.

Had the salmon skin hand roll. That was the only thing that was good! 5/5 stars for that! 
Uni sushi- I asked the waitress if it was fresh and when did they get their shipment. She lied to me and got her days twisted. Uni came out brown. And they charged me $11.95 for a week old uni. 
My boyfriend and I had also ordered a few rolls... 
First roll: Nobu special- 2/5 stars. The fish was dry the sushi was dry and the taste was bland. 
2nd roll: eel roll: 4/5 stars: nothing special. Just your typically traditional eel roll. It was just ok. They were shy on the eel and there was a lot rice. The boyfriend likes Eel rolls so we ordered that.
3rd roll: Burning sensation- 1/5 stars. This roll had bad news written all over it! The roll that was suppose to contained shrimp tempura and soft shell crab inside and SSC outside topped w/ tuna and avocado. The menu did not describe how the soft shell crab was prepared in a this roll. So I assumed the SSC was deep fried and rolled into the roll (kinda like the spider roll). But instead it came with some weird tasting minced SSC mixture. So when the roll came out my boyfriend and I both ate a piece and we both made a  face! The SSC mixture tasted awful! A taste that I cannot even discribe! I've had SSC rolls at a lot of places and it does not taste anything like that! Long story short! I had to talk to 2 waitresses(which 1 didn't speak English and another that had a major attitude and got in my face and told me ""it's my fault for ordering this rolls unknowingly not knowing how they prepare their Soft shell crab) and 1 boss to get them to finally exchange this roll to something else!

I was disappointed since this was so hyped up by a few friends of mine. We came here for dinner on a Friday night.

They never even had a reservation for us to begin with.

Service was kinda spotty...and weird at times. Our waitress would rush us to order and at the end, she kept on checking back on us because we took awhile to pay the bill since we were chatting and catching up with one another. You may be thinking oh she's just seeing if we may want to order dessert but no...her body language and behavior said otherwise.

My friend ordered his usual like Japanese Garlic Lasagna, Heart Attack and Burning Sensation. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and Jackpot. The rolls did not look too appealing. It was too big causing all the contents to fall apart plus there's just too much going on. Sometimes, keeping it petite and simple may be the best way to go about it. Not to mention, each roll is about $12-$16. Too expensive and it wasn't even that good. And....am I the only one who had stomach problems after eating this??

I ordered spicy tuna roll and my hubby got fried rice. Then we ordered the jackpot roll--my favorite. I order it every time but tonight it was off. And I told the owner I was dissatisfied. She then proceeded to tell me how it was the most popular item on the menu and she was sure it was made right. She wanted me to swap it for something else but as I said...I only order that. So I said no thank you and to just take it back. She went on to tell me how amazing it was, how sad she was that I didn't like it and that she was going to cry (she even did the hand motions for crying--wiping eyes #saywhaaat??) AND that we still had to pay for it. She argued with us for 5 minutes over this roll and told us that she'd do it this time but next time she won't just ""let us try things and send it back."" We politely told her there wouldn't be a next time, she then tried to argue with us all over again!! I'm appalled that this restaurant doesn't have basic customer service etiquette. I've had meals comped for FAR LESS ISSUES. I'm so disappointed in this experience.

Been there a few times for dinner.  Loved it.  Good food, great vibe, and great service.  

Went there tonight for a late night meal.  Big mistake!!!

Went there at 10pm.  No hostess.  Server finally came to seat us and look pissed off.  

Sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef looked miserable.  All the fish in the display fridge was cleared out.  They looked like they were ready to close and they still had two hours until closing.  

Ordered food from the sushi chef and the sushi was excellent.  I told him that I needed to order some food off the menu, but he told me that I needed to order from our server.  Our server who we have not seen since we got our drinks.

The restaurant is practically empty.  How can service be this bad?!?!

After 30 minutes into our meal, we told the sushi chef that we were ready for our check.  He finally smiled and looked relieved.  

We waited for our check and couldn't find anybody.  Finally a busser asked us how we were and we told him that we just needed our check.  He brought the check back and we asked him where our server went.  He said that her and the chef were in the back eating, because they missed their meal earlier.  LOL.  

Unbelievable.  

My tip to fellow yelpers... Go for lunch.  Go for dinner.  Don't go late night.

We've only been twice since it has opened because the service us so horrible. The wait staff are impatient, rude, and vengeful. We usually each get a roll and split a third. On this last visit our waitress became VERY impatient while we were deciding on our 3rd roll. Usually I would understand her impatience, but we were 1 of maybe 4 or 5 tables. There was no rush. Well 25 minutes later we still didn't have our food. We had to track down another waitress. 

The food is also more expensive than the original location. We used to be able to order 3 specialty rolls and drinks for $40. Summerlin location charges $2-3 more a roll.

3514874,2016-05-14,7,AYe8rS3qBPuLHSwNOZSbcA,"Located in Downtown Summerlin, the restaurant is beautiful and modern inside. The space is sexy, inviting, and comforting and showed a lot more personality than the drab exterior, which does nothing to draw people in.

Sushi purists, this is not the place for you. This is Americanized sushi to the max, full of mayo and orgasm sauce covering many dishes and rolls on the menu. But, that doesn't bother me. Sometimes I crave this type of bastardized Japanese the same way I occasionally crave a box of Kraft mac and cheese. I know it won't be the best, but it feeds and satisfies the craving.

The spicy tuna sashimi ($11.95) is nicely plated with thin cuts of fish atop rice noodles, all covered in a light sauce. The tuna wasn't bad, it exceeded my expectations which were low to begin with. The hamachi nigiri ($5.25) and the garlic ponzu tuna ($6.25) were slightly better than what you'd find at an all-you-can-eat joint.

Most rolls have ridiculous names and ridiculous amounts of ingredients and sauces. The massive ""Put your hands up"" was covered in tempura flakes and sauces like a snowpocolypse had just hit it. Each piece of the roll was so huge you'd have to be a porn star to fit it in your mouth. The Tiger roll was pretty good.  The Loca Special was my favorite roll of the night. While it was still crazy big, it was more manageable than the first one. As is common here, it was drowning in sauce to mask the freshness of the product, but it did its job -- it satisfied my appetite.

If you're just looking to stuff your face silly, you're better off heading to an AYCE spot. Otherwise, this is a decent place to go to quench you hunger for oversauced Americanized sushi.

The chicken karage was disappointing as it had no real flavor and was extremely dry.  The beef teriyaki was not very tender.  Everything just felt like it was missing flavor.

3783007,2015-05-01,6,AYe8rS3qBPuLHSwNOZSbcA,"WOW!!!
I am surprised at how much I hate this place. 
I am usually not one to destroy a place after a bad meal, however my experience at Sushi Loca has to by far be one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Vegas. 

The food I would give three stars. Definitely not terrible. I would come back if it weren't for the staff.  If I were the owner, I'd probably fire the staff and hire a new crew ASAP. 

Overall staff customer service skills are very poor. It's so disappointing for a new spot to not be on their A game, especially when it's fairly slow in the restaurant. You will not be greeted by any of the staff as you walk in. I was able to wander around the entire restaurant without being asked if I would like to be seated. If you are reading this review while sitting at Sushi Loca, stand up and just walk out. I'm sure the servers won't even notice. 

I enjoyed most of the items I ordered except for the jalapeño poppers which were terrible. Do not order this. We tried to send this back. This is where bad service became somewhat offensive. Instead of asking what was wrong with the dish, she told us that the dish is exactly what the menu describes and if we did not like it, that is our problem since we ordered it. WTF?....ok....
My friend and I were pretty much speechless at this point and just asked if she could clear the dish and bring us our check. 
She returns with the check and attempts to make ammends by explaining to us that if she took off or replaced every item that a guest did not enjoy, the restaurant would lose too much money. I understand this, however it is obvious that customer satisfaction is not of concern. Eventually she ends the awkward with conversation with ""Just this once I will let you order something else that is the same price as that dish but never again OK!?"" 
First of all. Thank you? But I will never be back so don't worry about it. 

They also charge 50cents for all sauces. I wouldn't usually mention something like this in a review because 50 cents doesn't really matter, however I asked for ponzu and she brought out the wrong sauce at first but decided to charge me for both. 

My bill came out to $100 for two people. There is no way I'd ever return to this place. There are just too many great restaurants to choose from to waste your time here.",4zGUfXRDgbLktXsYf0sHjQ,18,6,1,6wN1OTSGTfuXmw81TnloiA

So here's what we ate: Toro pieces were good sized, but at $17.95 a piece, highway robbery! The Negihama roll had double the rice it needed. The Kiss of Fire roll was swimming in so much spicy vinegar sauce that it made the roll fall apart - and the flavor was just sauce. The Spider roll had lots of the crab salad inside and the fried softshell crab was warm and crunchy. The Alaska roll and Tiger roll were just what was expected.

First time I went was a few months ago while visiting family in Summerlin and the service was terrible from the moment we walked in. Although we were seated right away we must've waited about 15 minutes just to order our drinks. The server kept forgetting about us and never brought us refills after I asked 2 times. The food took longer than any other place I've been to to arrive and they even forgot to bring my neices's kids meal and they brought it right before we left only because we had to remind them twice to bring it and by the time it arrived the rest of us had already finished eating. You're probably thinking it was a crowded night but it wasn't at all. I believe there were only about 3 tables being served so I have no idea why they took so long or how they can possibly forget a family of four.

What a big mistake! We were seated promptly but the service after that was a tad bit slow. There were only 2 other tables and they took atleast 10mins to get our drink orders and then another 10 to get our food orders. I work in the service industry and I understand that people get busy but you have 2 tables! And adequately staffed. What kind of service is that?
Don't even get me started on the sushi. They were all warm?? I got some smoked salmon and they tasted so off! I had to force myself to finish it despite only having 4 pieces. How do you even mess up smoked salmon?? Idk. My sister went for the lunchbox combo and it wasn't as bad as the sushi but the beef teriyaki was a little tough, Gyoza was gross, and the rice was a little hard.

We went this past Friday and didn't have a reservation and waited a little bit which we were fine with.  They seated us pretty quickly even though it was busy.  The hostess seated us and didn't give us menus.  When the server came and asked us what we wanted to eat we had mentioned that we never received menus and she looked irritated, we thought she was coming to give us menus.  We picked our items pretty quick and she came back about 10 minutes later to take our order.  Once the food came no one ever came back to see if we wanted more sushi rolls, water, tea, coffee, absolutely nothing.  So we gave up and decided that we would just ask for the check.  Good luck with that.  I finally got up to walk to the front stand to request my check when the server stopped me and asked what I needed (she noticed that the rest of my party had left and I'm sure assumed I was walking out as well).  I told her that I had been waiting and waiting for someone to come by so I could get my check.  I think she could see that I was beyond irritated.  So she brought back the check and stood over my shoulder and ensured me that the drinks were one the house for the slow service (we had 3 waters and 1 ice tea so it wasn't that big of a deal that the drinks were on the house).  I paid the bill and left.  I have no plans on going back, which is too bad because the food is really good.

The sushi chef was so pleasant and friendly and made incredible rolls. We're offered a cucumber started plate complementary. Nothing large but a small snack and it was yummy. Our service was fantastic and the food was on point. I'm not really one to suggest sushi as a restaurant choice but I think this place made a monster out of me. Better than China Town restaurants I've tried. The bf order the Crazy Horse roll and said it was fantastic and the Philly roll after. I, not eating meat or seafood order the First Date (no crab) and tempura veggie roll and they were amazing. The First Date roll was out of this world. The server described it like a French toast flavored roll and it was incredible. Then we finished off with tempura vanilla ice cream and it was perfect. Other notes I like to mention is the beer came out ice cold with an ice cold mug and they offer a large selection of vegetarian choices and a low carb menu.

It was clean & the sushi was fresh although the portions were quite small compared with our regular sushi bars in LA & it's conveniently located near our home in Summerlin.  We are that couple who orders the same thing each time even when we would place a take out order.  We've never seen this place busy so it never made any sense why the service was so slow but the food was pretty good.  The Screamin O is tuna sashimi salad of which was my favorite.  
We last ordered our usual approx 4 weeks ago as take out.  When my husband brought the food home, I seriously though there was a missing bag.  Our bill is the same each time, $74 in addition to a $10-12 tip for a take out order.  If I were to weigh the food, a McDonald's hamburger would weigh more than the entire meal for 2 people.  It was insulting!!!  The sashimi salad could seriously be consumed in 4 small bites.  The portions were significantly smaller so needless to say I was angry.  I called them immediately to complain...they knew who we were & that we are regulars.  There was a lot of screaming on the phone in the background between the workers so it was obvious to me that they didn't give a S#@T!  ""Come back & they'll redo the order.""  Sure, makes perfect sense to make a 2nd trip to the restaurant because they were too lazy & cheap to make it right the 1st time.  The $12 tip we had originally added to the bill just added insult to injury...I wish we could have taken that tip back.  Never will we eat at this place again!  I was floored at how arrogant the staff was coming from a sushi bar that was featured on Dirty Dining 2 yrs ago.  Avoid this place, it's not cheap, the service sucks & the portions are small.

Garlic edamame - tastes great, slightly strong flavor but bearable

Gyoza - decent, not the best I've had but it's definitely good with the Gyoza sauce

Tempura - pretty standard, no complaints here

Sashimi platter - wow so much fish, pretty freakin amazing assortment of different fish and it looks fresh. I enjoyed most of the fish on it. I couldn't tell you exactly what fish were on it but I know there was salmon and super white tuna which were both excellent

Jackpot roll - awesome roll, flavor is well balanced. 

Tuna nigiri - tuna is very hit/miss for me and I'm very picky with my tuna. I prefer the best of the best. It was just OK. 

miso soup - excellent. Bits of seafood in it. Just wonderful. 

Kiss of fire roll - freakin amazing, it's not super spicy, there is a slight kick to it but of course if u eat the jalapeño it will be spicy, I took it off. 

Hamachi - very nice, I like Hamachi and the sauce for it is excellent too. 

Super white tuna - o. M. G. So freakin good. I think it was belly or something? Idk but good lord it was tasty. 

Oh my god roll - wow, this roll is something else. I don't normally do rolls but... Oh my god this roll is good. 

I'd say the service was pretty standard; decent. We were well tended to and the waitress was friendly. The guy who cut our sushi for us was Han. He is good!

However, I had a friend in town who was staying out in Summerlin and I didn't want her navigating to the other side of town when she wasn't familiar with the roads.

I was a little concerned when I arrived at 6:00 and the place was completely empty. But then again, it was Week 1 of Monday Night Football so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it. The place was very spacious and beautifully decorated. I thought it was pretty cool that they served green tea from Le Creuset French press vessels. 

The food was service was good. We shared the jalapeño yellowtail, salmon collar and a couple of rolls. Everything seemed fresh and we actually loved that the rolls were more fish with just a thin delicate layer of rice. I thought it was strange that they only brought one plate of ginger and wasabi for the three of us to share.

- It's a bit pricey for what you get, although quality is good
- Sushi rice falls apart too easily.. good ingredients, mediocre sushi chefs?

This is my review from my visit with a friend on 4/21 around 3 pm. We first walked in and there were probably only 2 or 3 tables with people and the hostess told us to wait while she checked what was available...ok. We decided to order a la Carter because we weren't terribly hungry & wanted to have room for dessert. We shared the calamari tempura appetizer which was ok. It wasn't the worst, but I've had better. We both got 2 rolls each and I stuck to speciality rolls I was familiar with and knew I would like. My friend decided to get two rolls she had never seen before but both sounded good based off of the description. When her first roll came out she was immediately turned off because of the overwhelming smell that came from the salmon skin top (it was called the salmon skin roll). She only took one bite before deciding she didn't like it & pushed the plate to the side and ate the rest of her second roll. 

Our waitress comes around and asks us if we would like boxes and we both say no. She notices she hasn't touched her first roll & asked if there was anything wrong with it to which she hesitantly relied she didn't like it & wanted to know if she could get a different roll (mind you she is not a confrontational person at all and didn't even want to bring anything up to begin with. She was completely willing to pay for the roll even though she hadn't ate it.) The waitresses entire attitude changed and said she wasn't sure & had to talk to her manager. The manager comes over a few minutes later & immediately goes ""I don't understand, why don't you like it??"" And my friend simply says she just did not enjoy it (I didn't know it was a crime to not like a certain dish when you're having it for the first time.) The manager offers another roll & my friend asks if she could have it to-go because at this point we were done eating & wanted dessert. The manager proceeds to TAKE BACK her offer of another roll & says ""no I can't do that because that's wasting our food and I just can't do that."" We were both completely shocked at this point because we both work in a restaurant where our place of business is so strict on food costs, but that has never stopped us from giving a free item if a customer was dissatisfied with their meal (I thought this was common restaurant courtesy but apparently not). The manager instead offers a discount to which my friend agrees. She thinks it'll be AT LEAST 50% off but to our shock once again (not really at this point) it was only 10%. Mind you this is a $12 roll. 

Needless to say they DID NOT get a tip from us...correction, we left the 12 cents from her discount as the tip because they did in fact accommodate us sooooo well, how could we not be generous to their fantastic customer service? No wonder this place was almost completely empty on a Saturday afternoon when the mall is completely packed. Even Panda Express a few doors down had a line of customers!",2vDSIya9GE1-ej5zn8zpYA,0,0,1,Eidsw-OLxzXoXirywHvswA

We were given the lunch menu which the prices were not too bad. It was $13.95 for either a lunch plate which came with sushi, sashimi, and miso soup or a lunch box which came with your choice of two items on the list they provided and miso soup, salad, gyoza, and rice. 

It took the waitress a little longer than we would be liked to come and get our drink orders. So we decided to just order and ask for our drinks when she came to us. I chose the salmon teriyaki and vegetable tempura and one of my friends chose a California roll with the sashimi that was provided under the lunch plate. 

The salmon teriyaki was a bit overcooked for my taste so some pieces were a bit burnt. The vegetable tempura was overwhelming so I was only able to eat a few pieces. But I did like how it came with all those sides. My friend enjoyed her sashimi but her California roll had too much rice and was very filling.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,0,3,N3X4DnYRA6rQpg54c61YLA
