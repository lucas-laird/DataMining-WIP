Staff is friendly and knowledgable. With so many craft beers to choose from, every visit will be an adventure.  Smoking allowed but didn't smell smokey. 

With regard to the food it is a few dollars too much for what you get. $9 for 5 chicken wings? The conventional standards for bar food is tossed out the window. One is that the food is cheap and plentiful. Rebel Republic is expensive and small.  The other convention is that the food is average. Not here.

The food is fantastic!

I would highly recommend Rebel Republic for food with a warning about the cost.   

Beer prices were fair.  So we'll be back.  We will most definitely look for specials cause with so many choices in Las Vegas, we often have to go to options that offer a more modest value.",zDjzFJEgx8hxARZoYGXlnw,3,1,3,lmDptymD0OSO6NS9Ja9wSg

We came during the Patriots opener to find a somewhat dead bar. Although it's a new bar, the atmosphere was slow and boring. We had to request to have the tvs changed and volume turned on. The food and beer selection was awesome, and was at happy hour prices. Buttttt the server was pretty subpar. Working in the industry, I'm not one to really nitpick but I do notice the small things typical customers may miss. Our bartender Tina M was extremely slow and pretty unfriendly. I understand to a certain extent if they were busy, but with a dozen customers split between two bartenders, there's no excuses. Overall it's a nice venue with lots of potential, but it certainly needs some fine tuning when it comes to customer service.

But the pretzel was greasy, soft, and delicious. The monster burger came with deep fried jalapeños and onions rings. They needed to be deep fried more and we're kind of gooey. The burger was uh... Okay I guess. They used liquid smoke which I hate. I felt like I was eating a campfire to be honest. The bar itself is super chill and laid back, with tons of tv, slot machines, and great decor.

Apparently you need to sit at the bar in order to get some type of service. We had a party of 6 sitting at the tables across the bar and if we needed to order anything we had to go up and get it ourselves (according to the blonde bartender). So sad because they weren't even busy. A group of medical students came in a bit later to eat and poor things weren't even served. One of the busboys brought them water and after about 20minutes of being ignored they walked out. At that point there were 2 bartenders and 1 busboy. The guy and lady bartenders were totally worthless.  They don't make eye contact and they are not aware of their surroundings. The wait time here makes you NEVER want to come back again.

It's in the super ghetto complex with CVS and Tuxedo Junction (to the right of both) on the NE corner of Valley View and Sahara.

The decor inside is nice. Like super nice for a craft beer/sports bar. It's like what every other fancy beer bar (Yard House) was trying for but just plain ""cheaped out"" on when it came to design. The nice comfy chairs will totally guarantee I will be back to gamble some more just out of pure comfort. There's a few long benches/long booths along the walls and plenty of TVs throughout.

Beers: 48 taps plus 4 locals. The selection is good. Today (4/25/15) I'm enjoying a Cismontane Marea Roja (sour) at $6. Decent price. There's also some Deschutes, Firestone, Evil Twin, Ninkasi, Pelican, Stone, ect. There's also about 30 bottled including some gluten free beers and a Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout (which I believe is organic). Bottles range from $4 (domestic doo doo) to $13 for a Chimay Blue. Taps are $3 to $7 including a now tapped out (aka totally gone) Stone Hibiscusicity that was $3. Bummer I missed that. 

I was craving some fried pickles ($6) so when I checked out the menu on the website (Yelp, thanks Autumn!) a trip over here was a no brainer. Food came out pretty fast and was super hot. The fried pickles are delicious. Pretty unique with the homemade batter (buttermilk, super fluffy) compared to others I've had around town. The pickles are pickle chips FYI (my favorite).

Gaming, tons of beers and very friendly service (Sachi? was super friendly and super cute, she gave me tasters of a few beers without even having to ask!). Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their time during my stay. I will be back.

Oh and the bar is smokers friendly but you really can't tell and the bathrooms were a step above PTs (clean and usable).",Kez5MabViniF-HUZ166HFw,2,1,5,ye7a73RKahgDOPjaQqR3yw

The only reason the one of THREE bartenders came over and took my order, was because my friend finally waived her down to get her attention.....and I didn't receive a smile, a hello, a how or you, nothing. She walked around the bar as if she had no purpose for 5 mins, and EATING, before coming to tell me she was out of orange juice for my drink. Really?

2103910,2016-01-28,2,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"Rebel Republic has an amazing selection of craft beers. I love trying different flavors of beer and was intrigued by the peanut butter flavors that were listed and decided to try them both. The first one was the Horny Goat Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter. This was a dark beer and tasted like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup with no sugar. The next one was a bit more mild, the Belching Beaver Peanut Butter. Also a dark beer, but was a tad bit sweeter than the other. I had the genius idea to mix the two together, and I actually really enjoyed the combination of both. My friends ordered mixed drinks and said they were very strong, so that is definitely a plus. And they were very reasonably priced. FYI with your Yelp check in you get a free PBR.

I loved the interior of this place. It's very log cabin esque. There is bench-style wooden seating along the wall, and a comfy couch and oversized leather chair in the back by the pool table. Wall hangings included animal heads and vintage signs as well as flat screen tv's. The inside was dimly lit and many of the tables had small tea candles lit. The vibe was laid back and chill. 

The bartenders were a bit off putting. We walked up to the bar and they didn't even look up from what they were doing to say hello, or be right with you. A few minutes later one of the girls finally stopped what she was doing to help us and she ended up being very helpful and friendly. She knew her beers and also made some suggestions based on what we liked.

2197478,2015-01-11,0,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"Rebel Republic is an absolutely fantastic spot that for whatever reason is not getting the business that it deserves, probably from a lack of advertisement and it's slightly secluded location tucked away in a shopping center at W Sahara and Valley View.  As a swing bartender, most of my experiences there have been during the graveyard shift.   When I first stepped foot in there, I was immediately marveled by the incredible draft beer selection (52!!!!).  Not only that, but several of the beers are on rotation so I know that every time I go back there are new things to try.  

Whereby the majority of the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, I have been most impressed by a few of the graveyard staff.  Larry, was the first to break me into the incredible beer menu.  He is so good with the beers that he often knows what to suggest to me based on prior selections.  Some nights, I don't know what to drink so I tell him to send me on a craft beer journey, and he never disappoints.  He's also a consummate host, always ensuring that his clientele is comfortable, happy, and fed.  

As a gamer, I enjoy their machines.  The poker plays very well, although I haven't had too much success with any jackpots.  However, I can usually salvage a night with a fun romp with the video Black Jack.  

Larry also turned me on to the food menu, first starting me off with the Kobe sliders.  They are original, delicious, and full of flavor.  Also, they are on the late-night happy hour, which is a fantastic program, especially for those of us working late into the evening (or morning).  From there, he moved me onto other fantastic dishes and sandwiches.  The tempura avocado is a personal favorite of mine.  I never thought that avocado would go so well in that style, but with the help of the phenomenal graveyard chef, Antwan (spelling?) they are always a hit from their perfect crispness to the delicious dipping sauce.  While mentioning Antwan, he is so much more than just a cook.  He always ensures that the guests are fully stocked with silverware, napkins, or condiments of any kind, and he is always open and friendly.

Although I have been there on other shifts, graveyards with Larry and Antwan are absolutely my favorite.  They are so much fun that I've made a regular evening after work with a group of friends on Wednesdays (Thursday mornings).  I suggest Rebel Republic as a gathering place whenever friends want to get together and try something new.  

I will continue to frequent this establishment, and I hope it continues in the fantastic fashion that it has started.  Larry and Antwan are incredible assets to this company and I look forward to seeing them every time I go.  

Simply put, the combination of great food, an amazing beer and drink selection, and devoted and knowledgeable staff makes Rebel Republic an outstanding destination for anyone looking for a great spot offering excellence at any hour of the day or night!",g4YwkrAq_WvHWYpgg4mBDA,1,0,5,hEZ57opl7phiOClkIbTMZw

The things they do have going for them though, are going splendidly. They have a great selection of taps and they usually have something new to try when I pop in. If they blow a keg of your favorite brew, never fear, chances are they have something equally good to replace it with. 

I'm not a huge fan of bar food so there aren't a ton of options here for me to chose from. I eat the fries. As far as french fries go, these are decent. They're fat steak fries not the annoying shoestring version. The fish tacos are a good option too but they aren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure if the tacos are there to stay.

The decor wallside consists of a mix of TV's, portraits that are barely visible(given the lighting is dim and relax), black boards with drink descriptions, a big clock, a bust of a deer and a fish. Oh, and a projector screen.

The beer: The draft selections are numerous. The menu for each is on a rough tapestry type of paper; all hail liquid courage.  I prefer IPA and the menu is already amazing me with all these different types that I've never tried. On the back and bottom a note in red states that there are more in bottles, which can be seen on a separate list. I'm alone and will stick to just one IPA, Lagunitas. My shit. 

The liquor: Vodka, Whiskey, Rum and Gin. They have it all. 

The menu: I came here looking for a burger. I opened the menu and the options like most menus was seperated by appetizers, sandwhiches, burgers, meals and more. I wanted a burger as stated before, the choices were between an ""eastwood"" (there take of a western burger), the hangover, Reuben burger and well I can't remember the last one, but it was the last burger on the list. I'm sure if you come here with an appetite for a drink and are hungry or become hungry, you won't be disappointed. 

The service: I received the standard attention from a bartender(one of three) servicing 10 plus customers and 3 plus groups. I never felt like I was waiting long to receive a refill and the food came within 15 minutes of ordering. Speaking of....

The food: I received my food in a timely manner. And oh man, was I in for a treat. So the burger I chose was the Reuben burger, it's a patty with pastrami and other amazing things. The fries are home made, thick huge and bomb Diggity. The entire entree came in a metal basket with a handle.  That's pretty cool. 

The bite: My first bite after a few fries, my salivatory glands started aching,  it was so good. Oh crap. Did I find the best burger in Vegas? SO FAR. Hell yes!! 

Overall: The music was good if you like rock, the drinks were good if you like to get drunk, and the food...if you want to battle your hangover; this the place.

Food: it was not bad...when they brought out my fiance's calamari, i thought it was chicken wings at first coz it was shaped odd (like a surfboard, instead of the strips/rings that im used to)...for $9, i expected a bigger portion. Good flavors, otherwise.

The korean bbq sandwich gets a thumbs up for me. 

$5 for a teeny kobe beef slider...really?

My fiance got one of their burgers (the Eastwood) and was not impressed. For the price we're paying, we're better off at Bachi burger. My fiance was not thrilled with the ""meh"" burger so he was just nibbling at it. (since he did pay $13 for such a mediocre entree)

I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Our server/bartender Missy gave me regular fries instead and i pointed that out to her and she said she'll bring me the correct one....and i've never seen those fries for the rest of the night

This was our first stop of the night and it was cold outside and a bit chilly inside...so the kicker of it all was when Missy knocked a full glass of Dr. Pepper on my fiance's lap. Imagine, in the dead of winter, having an icy beverage spilled all over your jeans and you have plans to go later!!!! The busser was kind enough to mop the floors and apologize profusely.

So nearing the end of our meal, my fiance was the only left slowly munching on his mediocre burger. He was distracted talking to our big group of friends so tell me why Missy takes his burger and fries away without asking him!!! When she came back, he told her he wasnt done and she said ""i saw napkins on top of it and thought you were done"". Liar! There wasnt any napkins of top of his burger. I saw her put a dirty napkin on top of it and took it away!

She apologized and offered to grab him another burger or take it off the tab.

My fiance works in the restaurant biz so instead of Missy telling the manager the issues we've been having at our table, we had to flag the manager down to complain! Why wasnt this automatic, Missy?? You should let your manager know when there are issues IMMEDIATELY because the you want to please your paying customers!!!!

So when my fiance explained to the manager what happened, tell me why this manager says, ""What would you like me to do about it?""

As a manager, you should first, apologize then say something like ""let me take that off your bill"". Why would you ask the customer what you want them to do? Dont you think it's embarrassing if the customer tells you...""oh, you take that off my bill"".....The right thing to do is tell the customer that u'll take it off immediately, especially considering all the cr*p that happened to us. (my fiance told me this is what their managers do for their customers to keep them happy & for them to come back at his restaurant. )

The crowd: Tell me why our friends were the most diverse ppl in that whole restaurant??...i think majority of the crowd that was there saturday night were bikers and dudes wearing swastika, neo nazi shirts.....not cool if you have a crew with black, asian and hispanic ppl....but then again, we probably just went on a cr*ptastic night.

For a better variety of beers and fantastic food at reasonable prices (esp during their happy hour)...ur better off at Yard House!

2970939,2014-09-26,9,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"Food this good should not be coming from a bar in strip mall, but good lawd!

I know what you're thinking, ""5 stars for a Gastro Pub?"", seriously though this place has some of the best bar food I've eaten in a long time and I use the term, ""bar food"" loosely. I mean house smoked Pastrami Egg Rolls, Fried Kobe Beef Sliders and a insane calamari dish. Who's the f**king mad scientist in the kitchen?!

Rebel Republic is tucked away in a random strip mall off Sahara Ave. and the only reason I was able to spot it, is because of their giant glowing neon blue ribbon sign. Finally, all those years of drinking that terrible PBR slop are paying off. When you walk up to Rebel Republic you first notice a keen little patio area outside of the restaurant possibly for sipping and sampling. I got here around 1a.m. and it was still too hot to eat outside, so I decided to belly up to the bar.  

The beer selection can be overwhelming even to the most veteran hop heads. From what I understand they have over 52 beers on tap at all times, which is music to my ears; ""I'll start with the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA"". As I sipped my beverage, I noticed that the menu items here were very intriguing. ""Bartender, who's in charge of the food?"" ""Oh, we hired a chef to come in and revamp the menu and then teach the permanent chefs how to prepare each item""... Oh you fancy huh?

This made sense.  As I stated in the first paragraph the food here is amazing and is made fresh to order 24 hours a day! Literally you can get Kobe Beef Sliders at four in the morning... how awesome is that? Speaking of the super sliders, these are amazing little bites of heaven, perfectly cooked, seasoned, and placed between two soft pillows of sweet bread. Oh mama!

The Pastrami Egg Rolls is pretty much exactly what it sound like. You know, delicious! Salted cured meat, wrapped in filo-dough, deep fried, and served with a house made thousand island sauce. Seriously, this goes great with a solid IPA.

The final thing I decided on was the calamari. This comes in a bowl with pickled seaweed. (I'm not sure about that?) These tasty morsels resemble that of a sweet and sour chicken, but taste just like perfectly cooked calamari with a spicy, saucy coating. I almost ordered another round. 

RR has a very chill vibe and the decor of a Midwestern family's basement. Animal heads and wood paneling for days. Plus the servers here are very helpful when it to comes to ordering beers.

Located on Sahara almost right across from Herbs and Rye, which makes it pretty dangerous for me and my friends since we always come here now after we have some cocktails at Herbs. They are open 24 hours and have a 24 hour kitchen. Yes, I will say it again, 24 hour kitchen offering their FULL menu. And this is not some PT's type grub (not hating on PT's or anything, their 50% off pizzas during happy hour is my ishh) but this place has some quality gastropub goodness with 52 DRAFT BEERS! Holy. And since we always go around the same time, we always see the same bartender who is incredibly friendly and always offers tastings if we're iffy about trying something, he's also made some awesome cocktails on the spot for me and my friends when we weren't feeling beer. I'm not beer drinker but I do love their Blueberry Wheat Beer, Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat or their Grapefruit Ale. From their Small Plates, my favorite has been their Rebel Reuben Eggrolls, basically a Reuben sandwich in eggroll form. As for burgers, I believe I've tried their Monster Burger, Rebel Burger, Eastwood Burger and Hangover Burger. My favorite is definitely between their Monster and Eastwood. The Monster includes jalapeno bacon cream cheese, onion rings, and deep fried jalapenos with bacon, coleslaw and rebel sauce. Phew! This one is deliciously messy. Their Eastwood is basically a take-on a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger served on a sweet Hawaiian Bun. They also all come with Fries, or you can sub them from sweet potato or onion rings. Even their fries are awesome. Not quite steak fries but pretty thick and flavorful. The only thing I will say kind of eh about their burgers are that no matter how many times I order them and ask from Medium-Rare or any of my friends order Medium, all the burgers always come out Well Done. Always lol but it's fine since the flavor makes up for it but they would be 100x better if they could make it to our preference but oh well! Also one of my friends tried their Philly last time and it was pretty amazing, he said it was the best Philly he's ever had!

This place also has lots of seating and TV's to watch football along with football and happy hour specials. Tons of bar seats and lots of booth styled tables that wrap around the bar and they even have some couches in front of their bigger TV near the pool table and dart section. I like playing pool and darts so I love that Rebel Republic has these also especially since they seem almost new! Another big thing for me is that this place is incredibly clean! No sticky floors, and lots of new decor. Also really clean restrooms. Definitely a regular here! :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,18,12,5,p1Z2TDY6yhl3CSYaNNyaVA

When I finally heard about it, the website appeared to be down.  So I had to come to the bar to see first hand what type of selection there was.  

They had about 25 rotating taps and a large bottle list.  They had some rare Stone anniversary brews, many California and Colorado brands, and some local craft as well.  Most ranged from ($6-$8), usual Vegas prices, but there were also a couple beer specials for $3-$5, not macro, but an actual local craft.  The best part is they show the prices of the beer on the menu!  This is very rare in Las Vegas and worth the shout out.

I came on a sunday for football and they had a few beer specials on top of the daily deals, as well as some food specials for $5.  I had the pork sliders and kobe beef sliders.  The pork was good and juicy but the kobe seemed to be a little overcooked.  I will most likely be back to try the burger (looked good) and will absolutely be back to continue tasting specialty craft beers that they offer at a great price.  

And by the way, Rebel Republic is only about 10 minutes from the strip, so come here to watch some sports, drink craft beer, and enjoy yourself off the strip in local Las Vegas.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,Pyx4D-LE7o-O7sZt8DIw1A

Visited the establishment for the first time last Friday night. We sat at a booth, rather than the bar, my s/o & i both had a long day & wanted to relax. We noticed right away that they seemed short staffed so we were patient & waited for someone to help us. Eventually the same woman bartending, Tina, (only 2 bartenders staffed) came to take our order. Since we figured we wouldn't see her again for a while, we put our entire order in for drinks & food. Everything we ordered tasted delicious & was brought out immediately. We struggled getting refills, utensils, napkins, etc. we asked a bus boy if he could help us out, which he did, so we slipped him a few $ for his help. We didn't realize all those things were provided at the table because our table ran out but he took care of that & asked the other bartender to enter the order for refills. After that is when the service really went downhill. Seems that Tina was pissed that we asked someone else for assistance & verbally reprimanded the bus boy in front of us. Then we continued to sit there & be ignored for the next 20 or so minutes until the bus boy came to our aid again. At this point we simply wanted the check so we could pay & leave. We still left Tina a $6 tip for her time but it was a fraction of what the bill was. She did manage to take the time to acknowledge us on the way out with a fake smile & thanking us for coming in, but IMO it was her way of saying ""FU I saw you trying to get my attention all that time & instead decided to let you wait for the bus boy again."" 
Perhaps it was the fact that they were busy or understaffed but it's probably something she should have mentioned right when we sat down. I would've given a higher rating based on the quality of food, unfortunately the service can make or break an establishment & her poor customer service made it very difficult for me to give anything better than 2 stars. 
Best of luck in your endeavors - hopefully the rest of your staff is better at their jobs than Tina.",5qtZ39zsEKyCUX_853jlEw,0,0,2,fXXqlKGysqLEycdO7JJnVw

24/7 bar with a KITCHEN OPEN 24/7. AND THE FOOD IS ACTUALLY GOURMET AND FRESH!? helloooooooooo new favorite place to munch out at 3AM or whatever ungodly time you feel like shamelessly eating!!

Came here on a Sunday night (heh, maybe that's why it was so empty outside) and the vibes were sooooooo chill and nice here. Like, they were playing the Glass Animals on Pandora Radio chill vibe (cuz they were literally playing Glass Animals radio).

The menu is surprisingly impressive and modern. 

SHORT RIB POUTINE ($10) - 4.5/5 - YUM-O! I love me some fries, cheese, and meat! Their fries are really really tasty. Great amount of short rib. I'd prefer a smidge more gravy. 

MONSTER BURGER ($15) - 3.85/5 - JALAPENO BACON CREAM CHEESE?? whaaa?!? From the description it sounded like my burger soulmate - i love me some deep fried yummiez and i love me some spicy!! It's totally worth trying, but didn't taste as jizz-in-my-pants delicious as it looked. I can't even pinpoint where it went wrong, but soooomething seemed missing...personally would've preferred any other bread bun than a Hawaiian bread bun. Not a bad burger tho. Expect some grease. Paired it with sweet potato fries which were basic and on the border of looking burnt...but didn't taste burnt? See pics for reference. I'd say go with the normal fries instead.

My bae and I sat at the bar, wasted a few bucks playing video poker, sipped on $2/pint PBR's (with yelp check in), and shared a juicy burger. The server/bartender was SUCH a friendly lady and we had a good brief chat about music and alcohol. I see why they have regulars who stop by alone for a mini break from the mundane.

I got a 10oz. campfire stout from highwater brewing. It was pretty amazing, I've had it in bottle, and in my opinion its way better on tap.

  Through the many years I've always had noticed a bar called the Bounty Hunter tucked far in the north eastern corner of the parking lot. I had always believed it to be closed, at least Until recently, I had no idea it was renovated and now called Rebel Republic.  
    Well, through the 2 channels I get my information from I figured what the hell. It's close, it's not a dotties or any other ""mini casino"", and they allegedly had 40+ beers on tap.
   My interest was piqued and I hit up their happy hour!


         With plenty of parking available I was able get a prime spot within 50-100'. As I approached I noticed a lovely out door Bench area with fantastically green faux grass(awesome) and a bean bag horseshoe thing game. 
 I was here for the beer, so I just b-lined for the bar. 
    I was greeted with a smile by the Beautiful Missy, The bartender who's shift had just started, and the lovely young lady with glasses who was getting ready to leave. 
 As I sat down my eyes panned across the taps and said to myself, ""that's not even 25 taps behind the bar!""  
  My inner voice was actually speaking out loud at that point, and I was surprisingly impressed as my attention was directed to the other set of taps on the opposite side of the bar. At that moment I found myself surrounded by 52 delicious, craft beers. This was my Willy Wonkas Factory. 

     I found Missy very, very helpful pairing my flavour ideas with the beers on tap.  
   I started off with a Brooklyn Summer Ale, followed by the brew Purple Haze, switched up to a few Stone Ruination IPAs and then finished off with another Purple Haze and BSAle. 
     During my stint in the pub an unexpected business/office looking party of around 20/25 rolled in all at once. 
  The young lady who had just worked a double, got back on shift and the two lovely bartends handled business like stRaight up bosses. 
     After a few drinks, I tried some appetizers. BBQ pork sliders and BBQ pork egg rolls. I found them on the spicy side, but that's coming from someone who would get a negative 22 on Thai food. 
    The food was good, but not great. Of course That was just 2 happy hour appetizers. 
      Looking around I noticed their logo resembles a Pabst label, Which in my opinion is the equivalent of a hipster bat signal, and for a moment I second guessed myself being there. 
    However I hold no judgement whilst drunken. 
    I have found a 100% real, local, neighborhood bar with the best beers in the area on tap and bottle, food, great service, and an atmosphere that is becoming a rarity in this city.   
  Looking forward to my third visit and many more.

Judging the establishment from the outside it seems like a local dive bar. Right when you walk in to Rebel Republic you are welcomed with a fresh cigarette scent. It must the new air freshener ""La Menthol."" The scent is very strong so I warn you to enter with caution. 

Also, don't stand by the door looking silly just go ahead and seat yourself. The servers are not very attentive so you might have to flag them down to get you menus and drinks. Patience is a must at this restaurant because it took about 40 minutes for them to deliver the food. It took them so long that the bartender offered us another drink on the house. I appreciate that the bartender was trying to make it right. Therefore, I added another star to the rating otherwise they would've gotten the ""Meh, I've experienced better."" I mean how long does it take to make nachos and other finger food? 

When the food did finally arrived it was quite good. I recommend the Reuben Egg Rolls and Avocado Tempura. Both of those were excellent. The sauces on both of those items were very good. The nachos is another good selection. It comes loaded with chicken, avocado, sour cream, pico de gallo and a bed of melted nacho cheese. It was good but not 40 minutes of waiting good. 

I would like to give Rebel Republic a higher score but first they need to work on being more efficient and put a pep in their steps. Second, the cigarette smell can be unbearable for some. My buddy was choking up the entire time he was there.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,1,0,3,oBnVke7z9ktBpXpSz8-oPw

They also had some pretty decent food specials. We tried the wings, southwest egg rolls, pastrami egg rolls, and fried Kobe sliders. My personal favorite was the pastrami egg rolls. It's nothing like I've ever had before and very tasty. It was sort of like a ruben sandwich with a twist. I'd have to say the wings and southwest egg rolls were just so so, but enjoyed the sliders.

I was looking for a good spot for NFL.. With good food, atmosphere and specials...

There are the good dingy neighborhood hangs where you feel at home but you may not want to share that place with friends or a potential date..

Rebel Republic is the dive bar vibe you want minus the crappy food, dirty draft beer.. Loud fans and crappy dry wings..

It's comfortable no matter where you are from-  the happy hour/NFL game and specials are great because the food is actually good..

Everything fresh.. Nothing frozen..

Tons of TVs and a very eclectic crowd..
Sports fans, rock n rollers, blue & white collars and a couple of gay couples..

That says a lot about a place to me.. Everyone is welcome and everyone wants to be there..

Wendy & Tina are great as is the kitchen staff and bar backs.. Food is served hot fresh and quick..

Hot tips-  try the 5$ happy hour NFL food menu:  Avocado Tempura served w a great sauce & chop sticks 

And the Mini Sliders are AMAZING

Three of us stopped by on a Thursday night, and the bar was pretty empty even though there were games on; I'm assuming it's because they're pretty new.  The bar uses a lot of wood and piping for a neat industrial design.  Plenty of seating and plenty of TV's, I doubt there's a bad seat here.  They have a pool table and two dart boards.  The dart area is set up nicely, and offers a bit of privacy, however the throwing line (oche, if you want to use the correct term) is about a foot too close to the dart board.

Between us we shared a bunch of appetizers and a burger.  The sliders were good, and interestingly the patty was deep fried.  We tried a pork special they had, which had an Asian inspired sauce; decent.  Wings were good, nice and big, not too much breading.  The tempura avocado was forgettable.  The Pastrami Eggroll was good, and reminded me of a reuben pasty from Cornish Pasty, except more cylindrical.  The burger was a big miss; the beef quality was not there, it was flavorless, and all you tasted was bread and sauce.  

Not a bad place, lots of food and drink specials during games.  For the 6 dishes and 7 beers we ordered during Thursday Night Football, it came out to $30 per person including tip; not too bad.

The prices on food are a little bit high, but keep in mind this place is close to the Strip, and all prices increase as you hit the center of Vegas.
The Ruben egg roll and calamari appetizers were really tasty and unique, just smaller portions than expected.
We had wings, mushroom burger and spicy chicken sandwich -- all good, better than most bars and pubs.
The regular fries are well seasoned, not just salt - very tasty.
I recommend the onion rings as your side, they are the tempura batter style - my favorite.
The service was great.

Service the last two visits was horrific. Second visit 6 months ago we brought a group of 14 in at midnight and called them in advance to let them know. The cook didn't show so the bartender and bar back (who apparently was thrown into the kitchen) were the only two people there. The food was horrible and service was slow, despite there being very few people outside of our group there. Wrote it off to bad luck and gave them another shot last night (Tuesday). We (wife and I) walked in at 7:02 PM and stood at the bar with two friends who had arrived earlier. We stood there for 30 minutes without being served. The two bartenders never even looked in our direction and rarely came down to our end of the bar. After waving my arms and jumping up and down, one of them finally came over and, when we explained we had been there for 30 minutes, she asked ""so why did you stay""? Interesting business model. Her excuse was that there was a group of 80 that had walked in without calling ahead. I've tended bar before and if I had moved as slow as they were, chatting with other customers while people walked in and stood there for 30 minutes without being served, I would have been fired.

Lights were on and the music was blasting out in their front porch seating area, after 10 minutes or so of doorbell, knocking and calling with no reply, we left to go find something else.

Either no one can here us banging on the door, or the doorbell video isn't working and the phone is on silent or the staff was taking a siesta, it was a waste of our our time and a drive and we were just getting more tired from post work fatigue.

5691613,2016-05-17,0,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"I've been coming to Rebel Republic a few times a month ever since they opened. The food has always been very, very good and consistent, and I love the revolving beer selections and how they have a ""locally brewed"" section on their beer menu. The atmosphere/music/decor is great too... a little bit of ""hipster"" in an part of town that needs it! 

That being said, I have one major issue that has been bugging the hell out of me for the past year... and I'm not one to review stuff on Yelp, but by doing this I hope this problem will get some attention: Rebel Republic, YOU NEED A WAITER OR WAITRESS TO COVER THE FOOD AND DRINK ORDERS AT THE TABLES. Your bartenders are nice and cool, but thanks to them running orders out to the high-tops, we patrons at the bar go dry and get ignored. I've been at the bar on late swing on a weekday, and there's two bartenders and someone who appears to be a bar-back, but still, everyone is too busy servicing the tables. You realize that some parties with 6-8 people all want separate checks and when it's time for them to leave, the bartenders are spending 10 minutes with their nose in the register closing out tabs? I've seen it happen there quite often... while I'm sitting there with an empty beer for 8-10 minutes. Ask your bartenders about this... they know it's true, but I suspect they want the extra money/tips from the food orders... but really, I think if they just had to focus on the bar-top clients and rely on a waitstaff to deal with the tables, the bartender's tips will be better just based on the better service... I know I would tip better! 

Bartenders need to constantly be aware of what's going on around them... they need to look around, check on everyone at the bar and make eye contact with them. Rebel mostly fails at this. 

PT's bartenders are trained to hit a customer up for another drink when they see the client's drink down to about 20%. They also, upon taking a food order at the bar, immediately put the tray with all the amenities in front of the customer. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered food at Rebel and the cook (cool guy too) brings it out and then I'm waiting to get the bartenders attention so I can get flatware, napkins, S&P, ketchup etc... oh, and another beer. 

I'm not a huge fan of PT's Pubs, but I suggest Rebel adopt the above two practices because if you make the above two things a rule, you'll already be running things more efficiently and the bartenders will save time and hassle just by doing these two pro-active things that are merely anticipatory and common sense. 

Maybe try just letting the bartenders handle the food ordered by people at the bar, and have a waiter/waitress do the table orders. I recently saw a sign on the tables saying ""You're welcome to sit here (at a high top) but see the bartender for your drink/food order."" I can appreciate this on Graveyard, but not at other times... you have enough table business to justify a waitstaff and by doing this, your bartenders will hopefully connect better with the bar patrons (and schmooze the gamers!) and they'll return more often. Right now all your bartenders are just robot serving machines, constantly trying to stay caught up when it's even the slightest bit busy... and it's not working.

Over the past 6-8 months I've noticed increased business there... more bodies in the place, people enjoying themselves... and I'm happy for you but it's making this service issue worse, not better.

So there it is folks. Again, I love this bar... I live in the neighborhood and want this place to succeed... but I'm about done waiting around for decent service.",Z5OxyH35Iyy2uWv7mrh44w,5,1,2,HJIQrU77PRrMhcWBQqdItw

I wasn't able to eat the tacos because they marinate it with pineapple juice and chunks of pineapple. Same with the BBQ sauce on the chicken wings (chipotle one too)! The reason for the 3 stars is because the cook in the back came out with it and was kinda rude. Maybe it was a bad night for him? I always end up changing my reviews as things get better. Anyways! We ordered the wings naked with the sauce on the side. It came out sauced up. Still kept it and my hubs ate it. The bartender/ server was super nice.

Sachi and Kat are awesome, very attentive, and will engage you in conversation. I plan all my get-togethers with friends at this place including movie nights, my birthday, and our fantasy football draft. The draft beers change weekly and are always on top of what is fresh and new. Plus, the food is delicious and very different!",VSdiHsbzrVgZz-N14H4kqQ,1,1,5,BGmHriJCxaV8YHnlLPpGag

5922123,2015-03-07,0,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"Great selection of beer. The one star was for the selection of beer,  because the service was awful. I am a bartender in town at another establishment so I want to start off by saying I'm not perfect and I have bad days. So I'll give people the reasonable doubt that they might be having a bad day when the service sucks. 

Service, however, is pretty awful consistently around this time. Girl behind the bar was eating food (gross) BEHIND THE BAR, and then she was on her phone. Now I said before that I'll give anyone a bad day as an excuse but I've been here before seeing as how I live around the corner. Because I've been here before a number of times and she has yet to even approach me to ask me if I need something to drink, I'm sure it's safe to say she's either always having a bad day or she just doesn't care. So the service with her apparently is always terrible in my experience, but I've noticed if you're a guy you might have better luck with getting a drink from her. I don't know her name because she's never helped me out, but she has long straight hair every time I come colored brown and blondeish

The other girl was Missy and even though I feel bad for calling out her name on Yelp I asked her for a Coors light and she never brought it,  which made things worse. The third girl who was there was the one who got me the Coors light as soon as I ordered it with short blonde hair. It appeared as though maybe she was the manager or owner. 

When I first sat down I had met my boyfriend who was waiting for me and he was with his friend earlier at this bar. I sat down and maybe five to ten minutes later (which felt like 20) I was finally greeted. Before I was greeted I jokingly said to my bf ""i would love a drink""  and he responded ""yea,  it took forever before I was greeted too."" 

Grave shift is the best time to come here because that's when you actually get served drinks without begging. 

Obviously, this is a long review and most people won't read it but I wrote this review mostly to help out management. If they had been busy I would have been forgiving, but eating behind the bar and being on your phone is straight negligence. Great potential but wrong crew to carry it out. 

I can go to ANY bar to get a drink, it's the service at a bar that makes it worthwhile.",W8JJGXuBqhdmQoSDoB7Wqg,2,1,1,3ENK18C76YuyfoBvEOAMYg
5922176,2014-10-06,0,bPh7M1vos_V-g8_s-eHaNA,"It's been a few weeks since I've been here with my friends so this review will be about what stuck with me in that time frame.

First, when we went in it still had that new bar smell, meaning it hasn't been inundated with the smell of smoke infused furniture yet. There were screens eveer.erywhere and the amount of beers on tap was reminiscent of a Yard House selection (woohoo!) They had some awesome happy hour deals and this huge ""rebel mug"" that was about the size of my head. We sat around for a while on some couches contemplating the extensive beer menu. We purchased our drinks at the bar and were about to play some billiards when, rounding the corner, I spotted the best thing I have seen in a bar ever (besides beer). 

There is a small cubby dedicated to playing darts! Two adjacent dartboards with a little table for drinks. Our group invaded this area and held it for hours, playing the dumbest games. We enjoyed strange music being chosen by a group on the far end of the bar via jukebox (kinda expensive) and drank maybe 2-3 beers each. One of the staffers (an owner perhaps) came by and took our picture as we played. It was a fun and good ol time, and it was all for ourselves.

I haven't had the chance to sample food but the drinks were great. There was an excellent selection of craft beers on tap (gulden draak, one of my favorites, being one)

My only reason for the 4star review is because there is still room for improvement. We weren't served as promptly as I thought we would be considering it was a new establishment and building rapport with new clientele should be priority. Also, I wasn't returned my driver's licence (which I had to forfeit in exchange for the darts) when we were done playing although I had asked. Communication amongst staff seemed lacking, though understandable because the team was so new. I was inconvenienced of making a shocking discovery within the next two days that my ID was missing and would have to drive back to retrieve it. Upon returning though, I was taken care of by Missy, a cheerful bartender who really helped me settle in as I enjoyed a beer.

Would definitely come again!

Also we came here to watch the Rebels game and thy didn't even have it on the tv. They were confused when we asked them to change the channel... ""What game are you looking for?"" Umm, the Rebel game that is being nationally televised. They put it on, but there was no sound. Very disappointing for a place that praises the Rebels. Wish I would want to come back for the beer selection, but I really don't want to. :/",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,0,0,2,p6GX6erXQ9uw6wxtVid_rg
