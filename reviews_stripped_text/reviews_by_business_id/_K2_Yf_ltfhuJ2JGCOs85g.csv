The eggs were bland, the bacon salty and overcooked, the hash browns/potatoes tasted funny--overall, I stopped my hunger by getting slightly sick to my stomach.

It is a ""champagne brunch"" today since it is a holiday.  I'm currently trying to get something for my $10 by slamming some fairly nasty Champagne.  Mixing it with the only good part of the meal--orange juice.  This makes it tolerable.

Second - dinner price went up but choices and quality went down. We used to like bbq night, but this one is also discontinued so we went for seafood-prime rib night. In the past there were two meats at the carving station - prime rib AND brisket...now they had only pretty dry prime rib. I was really looking forward to brisket which used to be pretty good so it was a bit disappointing evening...they had some good pasta with salmon saving a bit of the day... Also the choice of desserts is not what it used to be. If I do compare this buffet now with 2014 when we were there for the last time it is really visible how much it downgraded...

My visit here was almost inadvertent - looking for a quick buffet meal before going to the airport. I see this buffet handicapped by factors not related to the operation of the buffet itself. It's in a traffic-congested area near UNLV. There was a heavy smoke haze with a stale smell in the casino that wafts upstairs to the buffet entrance and sticks with you. The whole property probably needs a makeover. During my visit some sloppy customers who didn't seem to care made a mess at the food counters and salad counter. Some customers had serious hygiene problems. A few customers were loud and obnoxious and were arguing with customers at other tables.

That being said, the weekend brunch was almost full with customers. The buffet operation itself is clean and actually looks like it's fairly well-run. The variety of foods is limited because of the buffet's smaller size - but there were a few specialty items. The counter workers looked extremely busy and attentive to the foods. Table service was courteous and prompt. Champagne glass were kept filled without asking. Food quality wasn't too bad. I'll give it three stars instead of two for staff and management competence, reasonably good food, and low prices. Breakfast opens at 7AM so I'm willing to try weekday breakfast in the future, but for my preferences when I visit Las Vegas, that's probably about it.",JBvCvZ4OnQVy-r9OZ0pMRQ,0,0,3,jxE9XdqejafnzkKomfDCeA

Of course, there are plenty of high end places, but part of the mythology of Vegas is the proliferation of cheap buffets, and we wanted the full experience. Our hotel had an advertisement for Terrible's, and we thought, ""A name like that must be satire. Terrible's would never be terrible."" 

Before I continue, I should tell you that we've eaten at our share of budget restaurants, so our expectations were not high. We have a pretty good sense of what you get for your money, and with the prices here, we weren't expecting Michelin star food.

Unfortunately, even at budget prices we overpaid. I honestly wouldn't pay a cent for the food we had. The easiest way to describe our experience is just to add ""cigarette smoked"" to any dish. At Terrible's, a scoop of mashed potatoes tasted like ""Cigarette Smoked Mashed Potatoes."" Garlic butter shrimp was ""Cigarette Smokes Garlic Butter Shrimp."" Caesar salad turned into... well, you get the picture. 

Hopefully we just went there on a bad day. I don't have any ill will towards the restaurant. If they've cleaned things up since we visited, two thumbs up!

no meat lasagna  so I tried the vegetable lasagna...BLAND almost no taste at all

shrimp sauce...but no shrimp WTF???

tuna salad which I usually like had a strong fish odor and a strange METALLIC taste...one bite and I was done

carving station unmanned and the one piece of pork there looked old and dry    no beef or turkey

no glasses for the ""free"" root beer float station

When we went, I think the buffet had less than six parties as customers, and the restaurant next door (which shares the same room), had at least half its tables occupied. Another reason why my expectations were low going in.  

It's $8.99 for lunch, but $6.99 with a player's card.  So, that $2.00 off really makes a difference.  If you get a 2 for 1 coupon in the mail, or something - then at $4.50, I think it is worth 4 stars (on an apparently good day).  First, there was no line, which I liked (a double edged sword for Vegas buffets because that is a sign of bad food).  The price was great (we had the 2 for 1), and the food was decent.

The selection is small.  I had the meat at the carving station, which was satisfactory; , the beef medallion with gravy, I did like.  The pea soup, however, I did not like.

Like at the Orleans buffet,  I took a nice quantity of shrimp, peeled the shell, and had my own shrimp cocktail on a plate - though the shrimp I got was softer than what I would have liked (probably becuase I got the shrimp form the bottom of the bowl where the accumulation of melted ice was located), that alone was worth more than the price of the lunch at $4.50, even at $6.99, the shrimp alone is worth the price - at $8.99, I probably would be writing that I would have liked the shrimp to have been a better experience.

I'll tell you why. Because it's not $7.99 anymore with the coupon. First, you now have to go stand in line at the players club desk to turn your coupon from the Sunday into a voucher. This voucher is good for two days, and also good for a BOGO entree at the adjacent cafe (up to a $13.99 value). So after we found out we had to go back downstairs to get the voucher, we went back upstairs to give it to the cashier. Instead of the $7.99, it came up to $10.99. When we asked why, she said now they don't give you the BOGO with the players card discount. But you have to have a players card to use the coupon. Oh yeah that makes a lot of sense.

This isn't the best buffet, so for all the trouble and the raised cost, go elsewhere.

Actually the prime rib at the cafe next door is not bad, and you can (hopefully) still use the voucher for that. I did check the menu, and it is still printed in there as $13.99. So a BOGO for the prime rib would be worth it.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,4,1,2,6jqT_GGB_Fg7Znc0dg7FLA

The beef stew was fairly good for lunch, it may have been of canned origin 'tho, reminds me of Dinty Moore at it's best.

The soft serve frozen desert machine was broken, so the chocolate came out a bit like it had the runs.

I didn't try the breakfast nor the dinner.  

As far as buffets goes, there are better choices in Las Vegas of both more expansive selection and tastier quality, but those will run you about $30-40+.

So, if you're hungry, and have $10, you get all you can drink (non-alcoholic soft drinks) and that should cover your meal, tax and tip.

Truthfully, the restaurant next door with the $10 entree deals like the Prime Rib may be a better choice for your money if you're into higher quality and not focused in on the diversity and quantity that buffets offer.

Don't fall into the trap of gambling here at Terrible's... twice I've gambled and lost enough to have used that money to buy a high end dinner at a steakhouse.

The golden rule of Vegas for gamblers... DO NOT GO CHEAP ON FOOD !!!  If you're so willing to throw $10, $25, or $100 on gambling bets only to let cards, dice a rolling ball or reels determine your financial fate, you most certainly can fork over $50 and treat yourself to a good meal, so at the end of the trip even if you lose, at least you had a good dining experience.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,1,0,2,ryVcydv9HejHFSHt6bVqNA

He grabbed a napkin from our table and squished the COCKROACH and said he would show it to the chef as he walked away. IT SEEMED LIKE HE IS USED TO DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM.

demanded their money back after witnessing the COCKROACHES as they were seated at a table next to ours. They also immediately left the area as they also could not eat after seeing this.

one of my parents' favorite deals are the buy one get one free flyers for terrible's buffet. our first day we arrived in vegas around 1pm and hit up terrible's $7.99 brunch buffet. so, wait for it, $7.99 for 2 people for a buffet!! 

yah, it's much smaller than typical vegas buffets (you can't even compare this place to wynn, rio, bellagio, etc... think of comparing denny's to lawry's!) but dude, think about the price. they have surprisingly tasty offerings:

breakfast: carved ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, country-fried steak, waffles made to order, biscuits and gravy, a fruit bar, donuts/danishes/muffins/pies/cakes, frozen yogurt (chocolate/vanilla/swirl but no toppings), cereal, yogurt, a few dim sum items
lunch: carving station for prime rib & turkey, fried catfish (my favorite), taco bar, chinese food bar, raw shrimp (surprisingly decent and always my dad's favorite), hot wings, salad bar, fruit, chicken soup and ham and bean soup 
we actually thought it was such a good deal we came back again at the end of our trip! we arrived around 10:50 and it was the PERFECT time to go since we got to have a plate of breakfast items and at 11:00 they put out the piping hot lunch items.

small buffet but for the price, definitely worth it!!",5p7fIgmWgP6yWdqJbSrlig,3,3,4,AvAB1h14Tq9FW4vcIy8KCw

Terrible's is a small casino (the low ceilings don't help) with a small dining area and small buffet.  You're seated fairly quickly and the wait staff is pretty attentive.  With such a small area, though, if your drinks haven't been refilled it's pretty easy to find someone to take care of you.  

The first time I went for the breakfast.  I've lived in Vegas for 2 years and have driven by the sign a million times so I finally decided to drop in.  Standard breakfast fare: eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, biscuits, cereal, fruit, donuts, crepes, waffles, etc.  Nothing amazing.  The quality was a bit meh -- the eggs were a bit watery, the biscuits small and hard.  It really reminded me of my high school's breakfast offerings.  It's really hard to screw up some breakfast foods, though.  So if you want some milk, cereal, fruit, bacon... why pay $15 on the strip for it?  For some reason they also had fresh chicken wings and chili. 

I later went again to get the $4 breakfast but it was the weekend and instead they were doing brunch, which is $9.  The brunch includes pretty much all the same stuff as the breakfast but they also have catfish, lasagne, a taco bar, several meats that you can request slices of, chicken fingers, stuffed peppers, cake, pie, pastas, and salad.  The eggs were a bit better this time around, but the other food was a bit lacking.  The chicken fingers were a bit dry, the taco bar didn't seem to have any cheese, and the slice of beef brisket I got tasted like it had been marinated in a gallon of liquid smoke.  

Overall, for $4 ($4.31 with tax) the breakfast is a fine value.  The brunch, lunch, or dinner buffets are not really worth it, though.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,3,1,3,xLImQhGBKN-sLw2t8ckgPQ

3787408,2012-07-09,1,_K2_Yf_ltfhuJ2JGCOs85g,"If you're here to decide whether or not to eat at Terrible's Buffet, pay attention:

Unfortunately, I and a few others got the random ""draw"" of visiting this place...I protested, but for naught...

This buffet is located on the second level, up an escalator.  The buffet itself is very small, the number of plastic trees situated among the tables, easily outnumber the food items offered.  As we were led to our table, a party of 8 had just sat down, they were doing prayers...I had a sneaking suspicion it was not directed at honoring their gawd, but what they were about to eat...and  as a sidenote, at the cashier we were asked if this was our first time at the buffet, I honestly answered, ""unfortunately, no"", without a blink or a hesitation we were given our receipt and ushered along the way...

What is wrong with this buffet...

1. The size and diversity, but that's a corporate, financial decision.

2. The mislabeling.  As is often the custom on Las Vegas Buffets, someone came up with the clever idea of writing the identity of the food on the plastic panels...on our visit, the labels did not match the foods, obviously no manager had taken the time to walk the buffet line.  Example:  ""stuffing"" was written on the plastic, where noodles were located, next to the cream corn.  There was no stuffing served this evening (it was ""prime rib"" night).

3. As a general comment, the display of the food was done haphazardly and in an unappetizing fashion.  I cringed when I saw the staff replenish the salad line with food items spooned directly out of the cans that Sysco had delivered.  Not how I want to see my ""fresh"" ingredients.  

4. The fried chicken looked just dreadful, like you'd find at a Safeway deli after it had been sitting there for 2 hours.  You would not think it possible to screw up mashed potatoes, they were dreadful...gawd I hope they were not made from flakes.  All of the sauces were THIN...example: the gravy looked like it had been watered down.

5. The organization was lousy.  Example... they served fried shrimp which actually was ""ok"", but there was no cocktail sauce anywhere near it... it was located over by the salad bar near the cold peeled shrimp.  I watched with amusement as customers took the fried shrimp, and looked helplessly for the cocktail sauce.

6. You can get away with limited entrees and side dishes, but it's hard to present a dessert section that is not well stocked.  It just looks pathetic, especially at a Las Vegas buffet.

7. The few servers behind the buffet, at the meat station in particular, showed no enthusiasm.  If they're not excited about what they are serving, how is the customer suppose to feel?

8. All in all, I can understand, or at least respect, the high level executive decision to offer a small buffet at a lower dollar level; I have no respect for onsite management who can't possibly have taken the time to walk the buffet to appreciate its poor execution.

The table servers and their customers deserve better.   The next time anyone mentions this buffet, all I will ever be able to see is that server pouring corn out of a large Sysco-like commercial can, directly into the salad bar.

Even if it is 110 degrees outside, even if the price for the buffet is low, even if you have coupons, I'd advise you walk a few blocks in any direction and get some real food, that is served with respect.",A-5DQIIb1YfQEBmabv-6Fw,4,0,1,3mtdKSrN-zXgqccdmmwWlw

Otherwise, go elsewhere & get better quality food for the same $$ or less.  There's a great variety of decent restaurants within walking distance of Silver Sevens that can fill you up for around the same price.

I'm a 'local' that eats at a variety of casino/hotel buffets several times a month. I had no expectation that the Silver Sevens buffet would be anything close to the Wynn or Caesar's Palace (I haven't been to them yet) -- I knew not to expect much, yet I was still somewhat surprised at how little they had.      

 I tried the Silver Sevens buffet last night for dinner, having a 50% off coupon that I got from one of the weekly local hipster magazines (note: 'hipsters' do not go to Silver Sevens  -- that's one plus...).    Even just paying a little over $7, I was disappointed with the selection & quality of the buffet items, when for about $15 or less, I can get much greater selection plus a little better quality at various other hotel/casino buffets, such as those at the Station-brand casinos. 

From what I could see, the place was relatively clean.  Service was friendly, however my iced tea glass sat half-full or less for about 20 minutes before the waitress came over & asked if I wanted more.   I didn't even want a refill because their iced tea mix/concentrate was rather stale and/or very cheap quality compared to everywhere else I get it at.

The buffet does have the basics -- a small salad bar, meat, fish, poultry, vegetables & potatoes.  I don['t know if it's a nightly event, but on my Wednesday night visit, there were small, chilled shrimp & oysters.  I'm a vegetarian so I didn't touch them, but even if I wasn't a vegetarian, I probably would have been very hesitant to consume such raw food at this buffet.

 While I was eating, I was hoping to be a little productive by using my phone to check my email -- not sure about the rest of teh casino or hotel, but the buffet area did not offer wifi.

The desert bar was actually pretty good, and the only thing on-par with the many similarly-priced buffets in the LV area -- it had a variety of cake & pie slices, cookies, a self-serve ice cream (chocolate & vanilla), plus toppings.   One very cool feature -- self-serve rootbeer spigot next to the ice cream machine, to make yourself a root beer float.

  I'm very much aware that people have different tastes & financial abilities.   The Silver Sevens Casino is exactly what I expected it to be, and god bless 'em, it serves a demographic & hopefully makes a profit.

My boyfriend read up on it and said the reviews looked horrible, that it wasn't even worth $4... We being adventurous folk, and having been strapped for cash, decided, why not!

I really don't know how anyone could say ANYTHING against this breakfast buffet! They had everything I could have wanted (given the price). Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast, yogurt, fruit.... I couldn't complain.

I left full and happy!

Tip: the buffet is actually $6 if you aren't apart of their card club thing. Which you just have to sign up for completely free, and only one person in your group needs it if your paying on one tab.",8ArqCPPE7RviFAry4n8vzw,2,0,5,WCJIFZ-kpuK1qb8YDg0q_g

There are buffets that charge 4 times as much and have widely inconsistent crab quality. My loved one and I had a strong craving for crab and we would not be denied. 

Now I've read some not so complimentary reviews of the buffet, someone didn't like the rice, really! Who comes to a buffet for rice! That being said I'm centering my review on the crab. 
The crab was plentiful, fresh, and not doled out by a server that decides for you how much crab you should have unlike some places in town. 

The buffet is clean and the wait staff is quick and responsive. My advice is to stick to the crab and prime rib. The other dishes were decent but I did not come for starch, sugar, or greens. I came for mountains of crab! 

The buffet is not as busy as some, so the trays of other dishes were not replenished very often. I'm also a bread pudding junkie but by the time I finished my mountain of crab the bread pudding was as dry as brunt toast.

I guess you pay the consequences for being cheap and stopping at the first place we drove past.  $10 for a tiny buffet with the normal free hotel food:  wet eggs, funky already made omelets, oval hashbrowns, thin bacon, and funky fruit salad.  They had a carving station with dry meat that was recommended I ""put a lot of barbecue sauce on it because it helps make it better"" by an employee.  
We did get a lot of champagne.  The only good thing.

Get yourself a BOGO coupon from the Sunday magazine and you get your lunch for less than $4.

Yeah the food isn't the best, but you can eat ok food for less than a fast food combo.
Decent salad bar
Two kinds of soup
Turkey or ham at carving station
American comfort food (mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, etc)
Pizza
Tex Mex
even dessert and drink included

Weekends you can use the coupon too, where they also have champagne and seafood.

First, the good news. The place is cheap! Especially if you have a players club card for the casino. That is literally the only good news about this place.

Now the bad. The food was bland and horrible. The turkey and pork were painfully dry. The mashed potatoes and stuffing had no flavor whatsoever. The spring rolls in the Chinese section was basically just deep fried rice paper with no filling. The pasta just looked scary as did the taco section. Everything on the salad bar was limp and old. I tried the chocolate mousse cake for dessert.The crust was rubbery and there was no taste of chocolate at all in the filling. Literally the best thing I had was the jello.

I guess this is a great place to go if you are on a diet, because the food is so horrible you won't eat much and then you will have a stomach ache the rest of the day and won't eat again.

My dad said it wasn't worth waiting again, so I just paid and we sat down. 

This place is REALLY tiny. I've seen buffets at KFC (yes, they exist) that are bigger than this. There was a tower of bagels, muffins and cake donuts (some had fallen onto the floor.) There were some sad looking fruits, mini pancakes, ham, scrambled eggs and hash browns. There was also cereal and milk and biscuits and gravy. That's about it. It was sort of like Continental breakfast. Meh.

Nothing was good, except for the prepackaged frozen hash brown triangles. The buffet was actually just all around disappointing. I would hate to see what this place offers for dinner (you can get a ton more food by eating at the Station casino buffets for about the same price.)

I liked only liked the pasta section. The lasagna, alfredo broccoli and zucchini pasta, spaghetti & meatbealls were good. 
The stuffed peppers with rice and meat was ok.
The meat section had brisket and this other meat that was soft and tender. The grilled chicken was dry, nothing special.
The cocktail shrimps were very small, but good.
The Asian/Chinese section was a sorry section. Sucked a lot more than Panda Express. It was pathetic Chinese food. The chow mein was WTH is this. And the sweet and sour pork was soggy. The eggroll was not good.
There was this make-your-own taco section that i didn't try.
There was also a make-your-own salad section, 2 different potato salads (this was normal), macaroni salad, cottage cheese, sweet carrot salad, sweet dessert salads, and coleslaw (the only salad i liked).
The dessert section had quite a few stuff to choose from, but I didn't like anything but the tiny eclairs. There was donuts (dry), pies (ok), cakes.
