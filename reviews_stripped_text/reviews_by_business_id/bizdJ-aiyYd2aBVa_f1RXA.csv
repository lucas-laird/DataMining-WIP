I walked into this restaurant bc i needed something quick before my show and I didn't expect much but I was beyond blown away by the delicious quality of food they provided me with. The Connecticut roll was absolutely divine and the Lobster Quesadilla was delicious and super cheesy and huge! I wish i could have gone back to try their salads, those looked amazing too! Definitely will come back when I go on vacation again!! The cashier was also very nice and outgoing and willing to help me decide and was able to make suggestions, thats always a plus!",A5bBSOMuJfeTwjK7-lp6qQ,2,0,5,UFbhj1U9ZAcR0e0pGXnBmA

Will definitely come back and visit.",-nud8_AkLbN29et2LHEO2Q,0,0,5,xOOWP1sU9_d4aYtBJWrBvg

The lobster salad was light and refreshing.  We enjoyed it so much that we ordered Lobster Salad, more bisque and some clam chowder for dinner too.  Reheated just fine- oh and the cashier was very nice! 
If we lived here we would visit regularly",gsiB-qamGb3knyA_-QH0Hw,1,2,5,tmazPvLM43hVmTKAn87pHw
