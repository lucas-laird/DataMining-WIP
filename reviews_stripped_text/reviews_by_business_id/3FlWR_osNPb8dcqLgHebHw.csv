The place was not busy at all when we got there, the hostess told us it would be a 5 minute wait for a table, OK, like I said the place was not busy at all. Sat and waited for 20 minutes, the 1st hostess disappeared and we had to find someone else to seat us. Waited another 10 minutes sitting at the table and no one came to take drink orders or anything. The table next to us said they also had to wait forever for their food.  Finally walked out and spoke to the girl who seated us and asked her why no one came to our table. No apology whatsoever, she just said were short staff and doing the best they can.   She also said they were trying to fix an incident because a customer was yelling at the wait staff and that customer had to escorted out, well I wonder why.

Our food was nothing spectacular but what did stand out was the total ineptness of our server. She was completely inattentive of the needs of her tables (2) and in my opinion, lacked the charisma it takes to work as a food server.

127300,2012-02-13,0,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"We came here for dinner and it was not very good.  We hadn't been to Mimi's in years and wanted to give it another shot.  We left quite disappointed and saying that we would not return any time soon.  We started out with the crab something-or-other (can't remember the name of it) and they were deep fried balls with some crab and other veggies inside.  They were ok. We also started out with the shrimp bruscetta with toast.  That was just ok.  The waitress had forgotten to bring our bread, we had to ask for it.  We thought maybe they had done away with that practice.  My daughter had the tomato bisque soup and that was really good.

For dinner my husband had the chicken fried steak, my first daughter had the kids' spaghetti and marina and the other daughter had the lobster ravioli (3 course special).  I had the chicken pasta dish.  The chicken fried steak dinner looked like it had been taken out of the freezer, defrosted, and served to him.  There was absolutely nothing good about it.  The meat was very salty (as if it was preservative-laden).  The kids' meal was fine.  The lobster ravioloi was really good but the sauce was way too rich and hard too eat too much of it before you started feeling ""gross"". And my meal was pretty decent.  The chicken was encrusted in panko and cooked really well.  

If I were to go back, it would be to try their breakfast. Maybe its more of a breakfast place, I don't know.  But we will never return for dinner.  

I really love the ambiance of this place - so its disappointing that the food doesn't live up to the rest of the place.  It could be such a fun dining experience, and very family oriented.",hwiKS2wmPtUdR7alQxeFSA,0,0,2,Q9SsY4flFmRWTt3T26stPA

Asked her for it 2 or 3 times, and when I finally got it I was already done with the rest of my food and didn't want it. My friend never received her tea and was still charged for it.

The waiter said it can still be ordered but with honey mustard dressing? no, no, no, - Mimi's no longer has honey mustard dressing. WHAT? We asked if the hamburgers were 4 or 8 ounces as 8 ounces is too much and food is wasted. He said 4 ounces (with confidence) and when we asked him to double check, he walked over to the mgr. and came back determined they are 4 ounces. We ordered a burger - it was big and didn't look like a 1/4 pound. We mentioned this to our server and he said ""Well, they used to call it the French Quarter so it must be a 1/4 pound"". Really? For fun, we asked him to check with the chef. He came back and said ""it's 7.9 ounces"". Well, there goes your French Quarter theory, young man. The food was so-so, service was okay but the waiter could have made more $$$ if he knew the menu and could have bothered to check with the kitchen staff who might actually know the size of the burger patty. Overall, we did have dinner but there are way too many places to eat in ANY town to bother with Mimi's.",kc9ngTjNnDC4FZVQAYz4rw,0,0,2,ZEym8CdPNSZnTr71gln72A
1232005,2014-07-25,0,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"The decor at Mimi's is decidedly French but, unfortunately, so is the service. Although the wait staff wasn't maître d' snooty, we certainly didn't feel welcome. There was no one there to greet us, and we stood at the front desk for nearly five minutes before we were acknowledged. Our waiter was friendly but slow, and he barely interacted with us. We also had to ask for the check, which eventually was brought out by another server, and then we had to wait again for the bill to be picked up.

That said, our food was fine; nothing to rave about, but not the worst I've eaten. I had the roasted chicken crepes and my husband had the bacon & egg cheeseburger. We had a buy-one-get-one coupon, and they had a $5 wine promotion, so we got out of there for under $40 (with tip).

One other note: There were about 20 customers in the restaurant, and my husband and I were the youngest by at least 20 years -- and we're no spring chickens. I've been to Mimi's for brunch before, and I had a much better time. The brunch clientele also seemed to be a mix of older folks and younger families. So maybe we were just here on an off night. Nonetheless, if I return to Mimi's, I think I'll stick with the early birds.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,3,0Ycgt8Cx8sEzVd15uX1dKw

Better than both Denny's and IHOP(which is saying a lot since I still love both those places). 
Reasonable prices for the quality(may be steep for some people but you get what you pay for).
VERY good quality breakfast food items.
Pretty nice looking restaurant period.
The muffins are awesome.

Cons:
Weird entrance.
The cheese in my omlette was WAY too rubbery. It was still good though, I just may never get it again though unfortunately.

Very good cafe type of place. I will always have a soft spot for IHOP but this place is definitely a step up! IHOP and Denny's are really just average, this is above and beyond.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,0,4,6yDxeBazraidye50ekUByQ

We were advised to get soup.  ""You don't have to look to find the clams,"" the waiter said when asked about the New England chowder.  My husband took his recommendation and agreed, ""plenty of clams, and good!""  I started with French onion soup, which I enjoyed.  That, coupled with the generous bread basket would have been enough.  (The basket contained banana bread, crispy rolls and other tasty treats.)

Since we ordered the three course special -- a deal @ $13.99 -- I'll keep going: my entree of grilled salmon with spinach and little potatoes, was very nice.  I'm glad I asked for the sauce on the side, which I tasted, but never used.   T. had a combination of pasta with little shrimps and scallops -- somewhat overcooked, but I noticed he ate the whole thing.

The third course was dessert:  a choice of brownie a la mode, apple crisp also with ice cream, or bread pudding.  The apple crisp was great, as was the bread pudding, neither of which we finished.  We were full!

I stood there an waited for 12 minutes before he came out with my food. I was furious but cool. I asked him if they had happened to start my food order when I walked in. He told me a bogus story, that the cooks had messed up my order and thought it was dine-in and not to-go, and had to move my order into to-go containers.

Came here on a Friday night & it was not as packed as I remember. Let me start by saying we loved our server though. She was very accommodating and apologetic for what I'm about to write. 

I opted for the Roasted Chicken & Frites for dinner. The bread basket came. Looked different but still the same carrot bread (now shaped like a Madeleine) and regular bread, which was pretty hard (I couldn't even eat it). 

The server came and said that they don't have Roasted Chicken. So I ordered the Under the Brick Chicken that I saw was plastered on their posters and menus. Few minutes later, she comes back again and says they have no chicken whatsoever, so I had to change my order as well as my mom who ordered Chicken & Waffles.

It's Friday night, pretty empty place, no damn chicken. Your menu is filled with chicken dishes! I'm so disappointed. We opted for Pot Roast instead and Steak and they were delicious but how can you not have any freaking chicken?!

DEVILED EGGS: three eggs each of three versions offered, 9 halves for $6. One with bacon, one with a tomato-y twist, and another less memorable version. Not sure why it's on the menu, doesn't go with anything else.
MEATBALL APP: generous portion for an app, could be an entrée. The sauce was surprisingly tasty, a bit on the sweet side and reminiscent of a tomato-basil soup, but in an oddly good way. Seasonal item?
FRENCH ONION SOUP: Not bad, not in the top 10 of the best versions I've had.
FRENCH STEW: sausage, spinach, and white beans, sided with a salad. One of the healthier options available, but still hearty. I'd recommend this.

The above was enough for a full dinner for two, plus leftovers for the next day's lunch, for $35 including tip. Good value, but they clearly seem to be struggling.

Today we had Louis again ... He split our breakfast orders in half & plated half of each one for both of us.  No extra charge & we had only mentioned that we would be sharing.  

The omelet was excellent & honestly I was full after finishing half of it so I brought my lovely mornay sauced spinach & egg crepe along with a mound of small potatoes home for my guy. He said it was delicious. 

The server was extremely good, helpful, prompt & funny.  He told us he makes the best Mimosas... Thought that was funny as it consists of pouring Champagne into juice... Still he was suggesting it & even though we were not getting a Mimosa, he chatted in a friendly manner & gave us suggestions. 

Food & cappuccino came out steaming hot.  Muffin came out warm & melted the butter... It was fresh & very nice! 

Today it was a 5 star... I can't believe it because a couple times in the past when I did not Yelp, it was lucky to be a 3 star... So, in all fairness I have to say it is spotty & not consistent.  I hope this is the new Mimi's & the experience will be a 5 star every time.  Louis is excellent... Even better than he was on our last visit!",Dkb-TJFNSWl4PYR8wEcWcw,7,6,5,J7HPrHtToi8Vf5BB8JZDGA

Food was alright, not much selection going on but Twas tasty and had a good amount serving for the price. They theme them self as a French Tuscany style restaurant and somewhat olive gardenish if that makes any sense. The outside of the restaurant is well themed but inside the restaurant is a little more tamed down if you ask me. Nonetheless due to the lack of people inside on a Saturday night peak hour seemed like we walked in to a small town diner joint. Service was reasonable and quick especially for such a slow night, and waiters and staff were very nice and courteous. I would come back sometime...not my favorite of all places, but I definitely don't dislike it. Again food was good too.",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,1,1,3,yZ8T80oS4N0VHKeVBVMJmg
2206227,2015-04-12,0,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"The Skinny: the food is okay not great (2) service: on a dead Saturday night with 3 tables,  service was completely pathetic (1) Mimi's cafe used to provide decent food and service at reasonable prices. How times have changed (1).

We used to come every so often to gorge on fried zucchini sticks which were one of the best things on their menu. However,  major revamping of their menu eliminated our favorite appy so we haven't been back for a while.

We got a coupon for BOGO entrees with drink purchase so we decided to hit the joint on Saturday night.

When we got in the place was completely dead. There were 3 tables not including us and a room filled with booths with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good sign about the service. 

We were seated at a table with some menus. Our table was bare except for condiments. It took 10 minutes prior to being asked about drink orders. It took another 10 minutes to get our orders in after which our meager bread basket came out. 

I don't recall much about Mimi's but I do remember the nice bread basket with three different choices. Oh how times have changed! Now, there's only a sad doughy ""baguette"" and the ever present carrot bread with very scarce walnuts now (small portion sizes too). 

At this time, our drink orders were still not filled and we still had no utensils. It took another 5-10 minutes to get those and only after asking for them. In addition, our server was largely MIA in terms of checking up on refills of our drinks. This is despite asking multiple times directly for refills and where she either completely ignored us (walked by us) or forgot. 

From then on,  we had a 20 minute wait for the $2.50 side salad and our waitress forgot the side of soup was ordered. My salad was pretty horrible. Limp spring mix on the verge of complete dehydration/mushiness. The hubs said his soup was okay. 

Our entrees came out about 10 minutes later. We both got a grilled salmon dish ($13.99) -  mine was with fries and the hubs was with roasted potatoes and cream sauce. The salmon was okay. The fries were soggy from the spinach on the plate... Meh. The roasted potatoes were on top of a horrible goopy sauce for the hubs. 

By this time,  we had enough. The slow substandard service when there appeared to be at least 3 wait staff plus a manager hovering around to service 3 tables is unacceptable. (apparently our server was the only one doing the serving... Why?) 

We asked for our check. We had previously told our server that we wanted to use our coupon but she said her manager had to review it first. That did not happen.  So when we finally got our check? No discount was on it. Frustrated,  we had to say it again. Finally the other server appears and looks at out coupon and provides us with the proper total. After that we put our card on the check. From the looks of things she probably forgot to pick it up so I took the initiative and handed it to her at her workstation. I did not feel like I wanted to spend the night sleeping at Mimi's.

We finally got out of there 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. We vowed we were never going to Mimi's again. With the non-existent service and relatively expensive price for the mediocre quality food,  there is absolutely no reason to return given the plethora of restaurants in the area (Cheesecake Factory,  Claim Jumper.... Heck even Feast buffet offers better quality food for the less money on their Prime Rib night). Considering the piss poor job management has done,  I would not be surprised if this restaurant's days are numbered. Sorry Mimi's...

2324537,2013-12-28,5,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"I always forget this place exists, I'm not sure really why but I do. Same with Marie Callender's. It's very American cuisine and maybe thAts the problem? It's not very memorable. This is a 3.8 review.

Don't get me wrong the food is great but it's not amazing and it's not something I can't make at home. Meatloaf? Mash potatoes? Yep, I have my grandmothers recipes, and I'm half white, I got it down thanks.

What's great is the customer service, the food is out in less than 15 minutes, warm bread to your counter, but not any bread, it's muffin bread usually. The spices in the muffin are unusual and flavorful. They have large plates of food, and coupons they mail you, trick you I'm. Those coupons always get me in at least. Buy one get one is a good deal.

If you like all American food, such as chicken fried steak, French dips, burgers,  soups, etc then this is your place. I like more variety. I'm more a Mexican food eater. The Caesar salad is really good, not too much dressing and there was the perfect amount of cheeses. Prices are overall reasonable. 

 Side note, the desserts are rich, creamy and savory goodness. Go for the trio! I'm not a bread pudding fan but my husband loved it. Too soggy for me. The other too were right on the money. Especially the chocolate lava cake. 

Impressed with the bar, which has seating for disabled patrons too, which vie never seen before, awesome.

I had a grilled cheese sandwich and French onion soup and both were great. The grilled cheese sandwich was not so great on its own, but I was able to dip it into my friends tomato basil soup and that was delicious! The tomato basil soup is nice and thick and made a perfect dipping! 

My husband had the mussels and it was more than enough for one person. Lots of sauce!

You can order a bottle of wine, have a glass of it and take the rest to go which is great! We ordered the sirloin steak for my daughter, but it was not very good at all. Most of it went completely uneaten. The fries were great though. The steak is just not a very good cut, it came out raw and then came back again and anytime a steak is cooked twice I think it loses more flavor than necessary.

I would definitely return here to try something different. I'm curious about their salmon, chicken Parmesan, and their chicken sandwich. Lots to try for next visit!",5v2i1lqsqGxQv8XV94Uclg,1,2,4,vQoL85Sx7xoJ-NQPsVZkAg

2460492,2018-04-08,0,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"The Ultimate Worst Service. 
Of all my years of experiencing and providing customer service, I have just experienced service that has left me completely speechless and quite dumbfounded. My mom (with a broken foot and on crutches) and I decided to stop at Mimi's for a quick lunch.  I will never EVER step foot in that restaurant again. I will encourage and spread the word of the worst experience and shittiest humans (2 of them at least) who work there to anyone who suggests going to Mimi's Cafe. 
I am an incredibly patient person and felt I had given opportunity after opportunity to make it right and they continued to act carelessly and rude beyond words. We got to the restaurant just after 1pm and was greeted by the hostess who said it would be just a few minutes. There was a couple ahead of us so we were the second group to be seated. 10 minutes passed, we were still waiting and so was the couple ahead of us. Then came another party of two and waited behind us. 15 minutes passed and I could see the staff looking into the waiting area and realizing we are all still waiting and not a word was said to us. Over 30 minutes passed and I couldn't handle the awkward looks along with the silence so I went to the woman who later called herself the ""shift lead"" and said we've been waiting for quite a while, like over 30 minutes, what's going on? Her response was ""we have a party in the back"" and I looked around the dining area at all the empty tables and chairs and said ""okay but there isn't a party in here..."" and she rudely continued to say um okay where do you want to sit? At this point I was livid because she made me feel like I was inconveniencing HER. And I said ""if we're an inconvenience I'd be more than happy to take my business elsewhere."" She didn't seem to care so I walked away and ""Mel"" the server came behind and with attitude called my name and I said well they were here before us (pointing to the couple who had been waiting prior to our arrival)  So Mel sat them and came back for us.
She asked to take our drink order and I just couldn't even stomach being in that place any longer so I excused myself and told my mom we were leaving. I told Mel to check her attitude before she helps the next party. 

I realize this was long and drawn out but it's been a few hours since this happened and I am still taken aback so incredibly that any company in the world would hire such terrible people. We can all agree that this world is full of unfavorable people but Mimi's Cafe needs to be a little more wise and particular in the type of people they bring on board.",DAnLQFqWVhDfVaveqXITng,4,0,1,v2ZSLSJ3VWDBrU0P3XjIxA

1- Entered the door. Everyone seemed happy and polite.  Was told there would be a 10 minute wait for a table for two.  Glanced around the rooms and saw 7 open tables of various sizes.  (and just for a note, the two larger tables for 6-8 were never sat for about the hour we were here)

2- Ordered the pink lemonade. There is some sort of artificial sweetener in this, even when they say there is not, you can taste it.  Unfortunately, the migraine I got from it afterwards would also say there is sucrolose in it.

3- Ordered the corn beef hash meal and the apple and bacon waffles. My father wasn't impressed with the hash, but said it was okay.  He stated the rye toast was the best part of his meal.  My waffles were SMOTHERED in syrup and had been sitting before being brought to the table so they were soggy.  The apple pieces were raw and turning brown.  Fairly expensive for three TINY soggy waffles with small apple pieces and crumbles of bacon on it, nothing special, expensive, and a little gross.

My folks used to like it quite a bit, frequently dining with friends but hadn't been in a while; they were served atrocious meals Monday. The only thing Dad liked was the Diabeetus-in-a-loaf carrot raisin bread (and he used to love their chicken pot pie--this one was cold and the gravy tasted like uncooked flour) Mom's meatloaf was abysmally dry and over oniony; three times the server asked if she'd like a to-go box for her nearly untouched meal without connecting the dots?! They are super easy to please, so complaints are few and far between. I'd not been in years...and

Then, last night, friends brought me take out: the pictured salmon was cooked to an inedible dryness and fishy to the point that I questioned its freshness. Spinach, which I'll usually eat in any form/preparation was watery and like a salt lick; potatoes were a mushy starchy mess. 

Admittedly I've never been a fan, but joined family and friends on several occasions. Though with many dining options light years better nearby, I've always made other ""suggestions."" 

One * for getting inedible food into take away box and one * because none of us died and I don't believe the awful was because of gross negligence, the kitchen seems clueless. Suggestion to procure fresh food and prepare it correctly.

Now, some may say this place is pricey compared to what's nearby, which it kind of is?

The juice glass is small, but the muffins are heated up for you and of a good size and quality. And the food is pretty solid. They do serve alcohol here, though I've never gone in so I can't rate the bar service.

Now, I wanted to give this four stars because I genuinely like going here, but the drawback to this place is that the service SUCKS.

It basically is, in food and especially decor, kind of  like an ersatz-French/generic ""European"" Applebee's in that generic, stock American impression of what French and general ""European"" or ""Continental"" places would be like, with a basic, generic cookie-cutter feel about it.  

However, thankfully the food and service were better.  We were happy with the food, which basically seems to be generic interpretations of American and French food: steak, fries, fried onions, salad, and house red wine, all of which was perfectly fine and enjoyable but not memorable.  Nothing was great but nothing was bad and it made for an enjoyable time for the whole group of us.

The standout thing was the service.  Our waiter was wonderful - very friendly, helpful, eager to serve, attentive, efficient, in short perfect.

The worst thing, in the end, is the rather tacky cheapo decor and feel of the place itself, largely an inherent problem with such chain places.  I should add that the place has different rooms that appear rather vaguely to have different appearances or ""themes,"" none of which works very well: there is what appears to be an ""American"" room, a ""French/Parisian"" room, and a ""Southern French"" room, etc.  Just think of a shizophrenic Applebees' with fake ""international"" theme instead of the fake ""local"" theme.",XMGCnzgUNyXbtO5aHjJfxA,0,0,3,DB7sIC3EZcwx_uafjFSQ2Q

3203639,2010-11-05,23,3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw,"There is a time and a place for everything. I learned that lesson last month. I was walking down the street and some uptight square walks up to me and says ""do you realize you are naked from the waist down?""  I stared at him. He said in a very excited voice, ""do you realize that you are drinking gasoline and smoking a hand rolled...um...something.""  I said I did.  He screamed. He screamed loud. I walked away...some people are just crazy and it is best to get away as fast as possible. When you hear someone screaming about pants, gas, and the fall of mankind you know what to expect.

Mimi's Café is much like that insane man.  Anyone who goes there with the idea that this is going to be anything except for comfort food might as well start screaming on the street because you are nuts! I have been to Mimi's about 10 times and each and every time three things happened...there was good service, there was good food and there were good specials.  To me, your future king, that makes a good restaurant. I don't need finger bowls, 80 dollar bottles of wine and Baked Alaska to consider it a great place to eat...of course if I am eating Baked Alaska it means that I have travelled back in time to 1986, and I probably had a main course of Chicken Kiev.

So, I know you have questions. What is good to eat? How did you get so great? Why do we need to wear pants?  All good questions, and I will answer some of them in my new book ""The Pantsless King.""  I will answer the first question now.  The best thing on the menu is the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Simply amazing. Perfectly panko breaded chicken with ham and swiss cheese. The best in the city...yes...the BEST in the city. More good stuff...Country Fried Steak, Chicken Pot Pie, and the grilled meatloaf.  Not feeling the classic comfort food? Okay...go to hell...but okay...try the French Classics. The quiches are terrific. Light. Fluffy. Eggy. Deliciousy. I would recommend the Quiche Lorraine. Bacon. Green onion. Cheese. Yum. That's right...I said yum.
 
Not feeling the French...I understand. The last French I felt was really hairy where it mattered...Rex doesn't dig that. Go with a sandwich or a salad. The best sandwich is the Chicken Jack Ciabatta. I am a sucker for Ciabatta...Ciabatta, women who sweat and shiny dimes.  The Turkey Pesto Ciabatta and the West Coast Reuben are very good as well. All of the sandwiches are large and worth the reasonable cost. Best salads are the crispy chicken and the BBQ chopped.  

Tip: Never eat yellow snow.  

Tip: Sign up for their specials.

Tip: Love Rex with all your heart.

We came here on a Saturday around 3pm and it was quite and very few people were there. Our very nice and friendly waiter was Brooklyn and he knew the menu like the back of his hand even when asked about dishes that were no longer on the menu. He was very good about filling our glasses and the food came out really fast.

Yelp says this place is American, but it's really French-American. They have many Americanized French dishes, which is good for picky children and grown men that hate anything they can't pronounce. I love my boyfriend, but he has the palate of a 7 year old. He had the Tillamook Mac 'n' Cheese, and the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger and he liked all of it, his only complaints were that the fries were not crispy and the burger was a little on the sweet side for his taste. 

Their Tomato Basil Soup is the BEST tomato soup I have ever had, and I am not a fan of tomatoes. It is quite thick but it complimented the 5 cheese grilled cheese sandwich I had, which is no longer on the menu but our waiter Brooklyn had them make it anyways, which was awesome 'cause I was really in the mood for a grilled cheese!

I give it 4 stars and not five because I really wish they would offer their ENTIRE breakfast menu all day. Instead, they only offer a few select items. 

All in all, Mimi's Cafe is a warm, inviting, family oriented restaurant. Their portions are perfect, their food is pricey but high quality.

I don't get this restaurant at all.  What is it suppose to be?  A family restaurant?  A French restaurant?  A New Orleans restaurant?  Because it fails with all of that.  The menu consists of rather bland café fare.  There is Chicken Cordon Bleu on the menu.  Rather than actual Cordon Bleu, it is deep-fried chicken served with a bright yellow mustard sauce that they have the guts to call Dijon sauce.  The room we were in was decorated as if we were in a New Orleans café, ironically painted with the names of fun, Cajun dishes that were not on the menu. 
I ended up getting the ravioli...I know, I know, how French is that?  The sauce would made Chef Boyardee seem gourmet and the ravioli seemed fresh from the freezer. We went with Greg's mother, who I refer to as the Dairy Queen.  She became absolutely disgusted that they didn't serve real butter with the bread.  It tasted as if it was Promise, a butter substitute.  She, after finishing with her unbridled disgust, decided to bring her own butter with her on any future trips to Mimi's Café.  I, on the other hand, was not offended by the butter substitute, but will not be returning to Mimi's ever again, with or without my own butter.",pd5ouypeFcAlLEZ25o2uBg,1,1,2,D8bWbCupp5_Xqg1qdzZNzA

My wife ordered a tuna combination lunch and it was so soggy that the bottom half of the sandwich was stuck to the plate.  We complained to the waitress and all she said was ""OH"", not offering to replace the meal or get the manager.  My wife ate the tuna out of the sandwich and left the rest.  When we received the bill I asked for the manager because I was not happy at all.  Brenda, the manager, came over and said she would take 1/2 of the bill for my wife's meal.  I am also a veteran so I asked if they had a veteran discount as well.  She told me she could not give me both discounts so I would need to choose which one I wanted in a very sarcastic manner.  Now being upset, I told her the meal was not a discount but rather a very large inconvenience since my wife's meal was not eatable.  The manager then sighed very loud, turned and walked away shaking her head and making faces.  The manager then came back and handed me the bill stating she took my wife's meal off the bill and that is more than half, no kidding!  Then as we were walking out she looked at us and said ""happy holidays"" with a smirk on her face.

She brought the table behind us their check, remembered the bread she had promised and finally went and got the bread. Our order was finally taken. The appetizer, the Meyer lemon mussels were awesome, but she had to be asked for the appetizer again after another 10 to 15 minutes had come and gone. I had added dessert to go when she brought the bill. Long story short, she was getting off of her shift and told us she needed the signed receipt before she left. She was obviously in a hurry, which I understand and don't have a problem with. The biggest problem I had was she gave me the wrong dessert to go which I did not realize until we were leaving and I saw what the dessert was supposed to look like.

The request for fresh bread was repeated and did not get a response after a while it was brought, but we were kept guessing & the was certainly no apology (ok, we gave it our best shot & now we're pissed!). The potatoes au gratin turned out to be a rectangle cut from a casserole & bone dry. The pot roast was very tender, but so dry that it stuck in my throat. I got more gravy, but it was a bit sweet, very shiny from the mostly cornstarch recipe & not very good, although it did allow me to swallow.

I got the quatre fromage quiche which their menu describes as Swiss, brie, feta and parmesan cheese with sun dried tomatoes and hickory smoked bacon. Served with baby greens, fresh fruit and a freshly baked muffins.

The quiche was very good tasting and the size was a perfect amount for breakfast.  I did not, however, receive any muffin or bread.  I didn't see the muffin on the menu when I ordered or I would have asked.  I thought with the pastry crust of the quiche, that would be equivalent to toast.

Back home we use to come here quite a bit to meet family for breakfast and since I had such a pleasant experience here on this day, I'll have to remember to stop in more often. 

Since Mimi's prides itself on it's French theme it's not surprising that the quaint decor starts before you walk in the door. The restaurant looks like a beautiful French country farm house and when you walk in you'll be greeted by rooms full of ceramic roosters and gold top railings off the booths reminiscent of a brasserie in Provence...only bigger.  We were seated promptly and our friendly waitress was quick to bring out some hot coffee.

Be sure to request the carrot and raisin bread to start. Its moist and tasty and best of all its complimentary. 

Lots of options on the menu so it was hard to choose. Brioche, Eggs Benedict, Quiche... If you're not in the mood for an omelette I do recommend the buttermilk pancakes-they were fluffy, full of flavor, warm and perfectly cooked.

The warm carrot raisin muffin was scrumptious. They serve their butter nice and soft and whipped like. Excellent. I HATE when you have cold hard butter and it rips your toast, or muffin. Get it together breakfast places of America and soften your butter! 

I had a vanilla latte. It was yummy. Once again, thank you Mimi's for offering espresso drinks for those of us who just can't get on board with black coffee. 

I had a clever twist on a eggs Benny. The traditional English muffin was replaced with a potato cake and topped with spinach, bacon and tomato. So actually, the only thing that resembled a normal Benedict was the hollandaise. Nevertheless, it was tasty. My eggs were poached quite nicely and when cut poured yolky goodness all over the plate.

We were not greeted immediately as I think they may have been a little short handed, but at 12:45PM (not so good). Once one of the waiters came over to check us in things moved along pretty quickly. We were seated towards the rear of the restaurant in a booth that had an 8 inch split in the seat in the area of the booth I sat in. There were no other defects in the surrounds within eye view and the seat was still very comfortable in spite of the crack that I was sitting on.

Here are the most important reasons you should visit Mimi's. First of all, it's uniquely French in an otherwise very American neighborhood. The food is so awesome that you could pick anything from the menu blindfolded and you wouldn't be disappointed. My Mom had the pot pie, wife had a burger and I went for the Chicken Parmesan. OK, nothing super unique in our choices but getting the basics right at any restaurant is important to us and we were not disappointed.

The pot pie was enormous, hot, and very tasty. At 94 years old, pleasing my Mother is not easy and my wife and I laugh at the various complaints she concocts to avoid eating a good meal. Mom started with the calamari and loved it (didn't quite grasp what it was but she ate every bite). Sue (my wife) and I thought it was the best we ever had - EVER! Sue had a burger that was perfectly prepared and although it was larger than her hand she left nothing but a single bite for me to enjoy. My chicken parmesan was hearty and so good. It was more than I could ever eat, but it really was the best, tender and tasty.

Sarah was our waitress and she was sweet, fun, fast and accurate. Sarah made the meal fun and a bit unpredictable which is what I like in good service. A smile and a good sense of humor combined with efficient follow-through are the things I most enjoy paying for. Her up-sale was smart but gentle. Met the manager Ian and he was fun and made me feel welcome.

I was surprised when I was taken back and a booth was vacant as well as all but 2 tables.  A smile and ""we would be glad to seat you there"" would have gone a long way.   Those that frequent this business know the room directly forward past the counter must have bad acoustics's...it is too noisy... so I didn't want to sit there.

After ordering I had to ask for coffee refills...not offered or taken care of.  Cup sat empty twice.  I felt like I was being ignored?

Service was very slow today.  Ironically the manager came by asking how things were before the food came...I complained (Not something I normally do) ...it was taking long....his response was "" there is only one server in the room"" and walked away.  Not..."" I will check on it"", or an apology of sort...more of an excuse.  ....perhaps the manager should pitch in and help if the server needs help?   Soon they won't have as many to serve.

On previous recent visits we have noticed the bread basket that used to come automatically, now seems to have to be asked for.  And it has taken asking more than once in some cases.

Since Im cheap I just opted for the coupon deal bc I didnt wanna pay anything. So I ended up choosing this burger with avocado and 1000 island sauce on this gross Parmesan crusted sourdough TOAST. 

Now this thing looked like a burger between 2 pieces of toast... but the toast was only toasted on 1 side!! So I ended up getting the sauce on the side and put a little on and salted my avocados. I took a bite and it was ok, then I tried the fries and they were ok as well, after a few more bites my toast became soggy and was SOOOOO FULL OF BUTTER! Yuck!! I asked for a bun or something bc I couldnt stand it! 5 mins later she finally brought me a bun. It was ok, nothing amazing, but ok. The burger was medium and was cooked pretty good. 

My ex got the french dip and it looked ok, hes still greedy and didnt share but said it was good... then again he would probably eat a poop covered pretzel if it looked good HAHA.

This place isnt yummy, its just ok. I probs wont go back, the prices equal applebees, but you get more at Applebees. HAHA.",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,0,3,1K-kpAqtuf3vM_aodP012Q

Despite very friendly hosts and some of the best, most attentive waiters in town, Mimi's chow will only disappoint you.
We tried a variety of dishes here, from the crab cakes to the pancake breakfast and were thoroughly disappointed.
The place makes a homespun, middle-America attempt at showcasing itself as a neighborhood French bistro, but even the worst hole in the wall in New Orleans or Paris outshines the food here - just further proof that substance will win out over style any day of the week.
The pancakes are gummy, the protein dishes are waaaay over-sauced and I swear to God, I felt sick to my stomach for a full three hours after the last time we went here.
And it's a shame, too, because Mimi's is staffed by a TON of great folks. Yet even the friendliest, most efficient wait staff can't make up for the truly sub-par preparation of the food.
We had expected so much more from this place, but there's just no way I can recommend it. 
On the plus side, the food is very affordable, but after my three-hour bout of nausea I can see why. 
That said, the place is clean, very clean. So it's not a question of sanitation.
It's a question of management not hiring cooks who know how to deliver tasty food.

I recently signed up for their club, so since we had a BOGO, we decided to go back to one of our original haunts when we first hit town.  Not much has changed at Mimi's since then, except that our more sophisticated palates, the plethora of restaurants we now have to choose from, and the quality of the newer offerings make Mimi's seem like a throwback.

I ordered the salmon.  I almost never have that unless it's wild salmon, and this was Atlantic, but all the other offerings seemed too heavy.  The menu stated that it was ""with a light Chardonnay Dijon sauce, but I was dismayed to find that this was a cream sauce, which I avoid like the plague.  That wasn't explained on the menu, which is glaring, IMO.  I'm not one of them, but there are many lactose-intolerant people who need this information.  The waitress offered to change it, but there wasn't anything else that piqued my interest.  The sautéed garlic spinach and roasted potatoes that came with it were delicious, and I had no complaints about the salmon itself, which was properly cooked.  My husband had the pot roast and he was satisfied with it.

Service was very good, efficient but a bit impersonal.

Overall, Mimi's is okay, but nothing that sings to me and makes me want to rush back.  With so many terrific restaurants in our town, this one will remain an afterthought.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,2,3,hCOVUCPkTIFUNS2L-UHNag

The ham and Swiss crepes are my sister's favorite new food.

1) For dine in.  Had it rare, meat was tough.  Ran out of ketchup twice (should have told the waiter to bring me a bottle instead of just a dinky little sauce cup of it), which was annoying.  Didn't care for the home fries even though waiter says they make it themselves fresh on premises (I prefer In 'N' Out's fresh fries version).
2) Had ordered 1 to go (had to use up the $25 gift card I got from work), waiter recommended that the steak be medium-rare for safety reasons since I was taking it home.  Oddly, the medium-rare steak microwaved in my kitchen and eaten off my coffee table was much better than the rare steak I had at the restaurant.  Also, for the to-go order I opted for fried potatoes instead of fries, and the potatoes (little spuds cut up) were great, especially with my endless supply of ketchup from my fridge.

I asked if they could add berries since I saw them on advertised pancakes. The server, Candace, said ""Sure!"" When I received the bill, I was charged $2.59 for a side of fruit. While I realize that is not a large sum (which is not the point), I have 2 issues. #1 Any time there is an upcharge, the customer should ALWAYS be informed of it at the time of the order. #2 there were about 8 blueberries and 1 thinly sliced strawberry on the french toast---not even close to the amount to qualify for a ""side"". 

They weren't horribly busy but it was steady. The server bumped into our table, nearly spilling the drinks several times as she dashed about like a chicken with her head cut off. Parts of the order were not prepared properly and an assistant asked if we wanted freshly ground pepper on our bacon. (???)",NPmKodK-FMd7jsql8E9Tbg,1,0,2,cOo38u3HeqRaNln3-_7v0A

This is an unorganized mess of a restaurant that obviously need lava common sense manager focused on cleanliness. For starters more than half the restaurant was not being utilized and every one was being crowded into a little area. They had 4+ servers and every employee was in panic/rush mode. The pace and atmosphere was rush and unwelcomed.

They need to slow down, clean the restaurant and tables properly. Nothing was clean. We had to request a bus boy to come re-clean our booth because it had pancake syrup smeared all over - probably a small child seated there before us. They were put out by this request that should never have to be made by a guest in the first place.

The bathrooms were filthy and smelled like a dive bar. There was no point in belaboring the lack of cleanliness in this establishment. There is also no excuse for the poor quality of environment and attention to details.

This place should shut down until they can find an organized management staff. 

The food quality was ok at best. The home style corned beef hash promoted by the server was clearly from a can and very cheap version that shouldn't be served in a restaurant.",Q7IoE5m2heQKThuVq3SYFA,8,3,1,6NCwqTkW6r-8OPYjYqDJQA

I've been here before for lunch, and remember liking it.  I had a salad with crab cakes, and a cappuccino.  Everything was good.
My boyfriend, and I decided to try this place for breakfast.  I had eggs Benedict.  They were really runny.  The whites hadn't even set.  My boyfriend had an omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really inspiring either.  It would have been better if it wasn't quite so dry, and it would have been excusable if the price wasn't nearly 10 dollars each dish.  When I pay that much for eggs, I generally expect some kind of quality.  Same goes for the mimosa I ordered.  For $7 a glass, I'd expect at least Korbel.  I couldn't recognize the brand that they were serving, and although it was still very enjoyable,  it definitely wasn't anything special.    
The service wasn't anything to write home about either.  When my boyfriend left for a few minutes, the waitress ran up, and snatched his plate.  There was a lot of food on it that we were planning on taking home.  I asked her for a box, and she went to get one.  I shook my head, and turned my attention back to my potatoes just to realize that she snatched the ketchup, and all of the condiments off the table while I was still eating.

Sadly, the carrot raisin bread isn't great anymore. The baguettes were ok. When we finally got our food it was just ok. The steak was gristly, but the butter made up for that. The fries were super over cooked. The pot roast was bland - not nearly enough sauce. The au gratin potatoes and green beans made up for the lack of flavor in the meat.

The service is always excellent, the place is always clean and well organized and the food is usually good. I love the 5 dollar happy hour which seems to be all the time-meaning whatever time I pop in I can get a 5 dollar glass or 20 dollar bottle. Not bad at all for a good restaurant.

The food is also good, but I suggest sticking to their soups (tomato basil and corn chowder are my favorite) and sandwiches like the tuna melt or grilled cheese because they are awesome. I did have the BBQ burger here once as well but I was not impressed really. So as long as you stay away from the red meat here you really can't go wrong. Their food is usually always on point.

The servers at this Mimi's are my favorite, super personable, friendly and fast. We never wait for a table or long for our food here which I personally love about Mimi's.

This place is right by where I get my hair done. I was early for my recent appointment and decided to grab a quick breakfast while I waited.

It was around 8:30A on a Wednesday, and the place was empty. When I entered (just behind another party), there was no hostess and we all just stood there, waiting. I decided to head to the counter and seat myself instead.

Although there was only 1 other person at the counter, the server took FOREVER to greet me, take a drink order or give me a menu. Otherwise, she was really nice.

I decided to try their berry mimosa and surprisingly, this was one of the best mimosas I've EVER had (that is saying a lot)....they give you the split of champagne and there was plenty of juice/berries and it had really good flavor (considering it was cheap champagne).

It was just before St. Paddy's Day and the corned beef bennie had my name written all over it! The corned beef itself was good, but this wasn't really a ""bennie."" There wasn't any bread and I think that was a big mistake....if everything were on top of brioche or an english muffin, this dish would have been REALLY good. I also didn't really like the small, whole potatoes on the side.
