I guess it was my fault for going to Chili's (yes I said it), but it was near the AMC theater for the Star Wars premiere.

We ordered the queso to start. It comes out about 90 seconds after ordering, which is odd, but whatever. It came out with a large area of dark brown film, which I think is disgusting. I couldn't believe the server brought it to us like that. So I started looking around and luckily another server came to the rescue. When I pointed it out, she defended it by saying that's just what happens to the cheese after some time.

Tip: even though it's queso, please do me the courtesy of removing the nasty brown film and pretending it's fresh, even though it obviously isn't.

When our server came, I told him about the situation. He also said the same thing, almost verbatim, defending it. He said ""that's just what happens when it dries out"" ..which is laughable. Are you seriously saying these words to me? You're acknowledging that it's not fresh? Okay, thanks. He literally didn't care. He shrugged it off. Then he started patronizing us about the chips. He said that we could keep the chips and salsa without the queso.. He definitely wanted to charge us for it. We got a weird vibe like we were no longer welcome, and just asked him to take it. We paid, and left. 

Then he yelled halfway across the restaurant, ""what, you guys are leaving?"" 

Yes, Juan. We're leaving. Six minutes into our dinner.

Went to Macaroni Grill next door and are currently having a fantastic time. Happy to bring our money elsewhere.

Avoid at all costs.",xAGAy6XHcRjkDz_dQKkguA,2,0,1,8pCrzZ22RSNq2H09-mjVnw

When we were seated, it took around 12 minutes for anyone to see us. I know this because I checked in on FourSquare and got a free salsa and chips deal, so I had to keep my phone open to show my server, and I couldn't help but notice the time.

When when we could find our servers, which was hard to do, they were polite and helpful even when fixing an ordering problem. 

The food was OK, nothing special. I did find the idea of corn in the guacamole a little unusual. I had the burger bites which were tasty enough to take home. My companions had ribs and mozzarella sticks.

Main complaints? Hard to find the servers, and the floor in the place was DISGUSTING. Napkins and sticky stuff everywhere.
Nice things? Free deal on foursquare for salsa and chips, tasty burger sliders.",tVUliFzrkMMLzXHTcdyKGQ,0,0,2,ANmQgBLtJKr47vlCKvM-PA

One of the female workers answers and places me on hold, by this time I'm leaving work and driving to this restaurant. Surely they will pick up before I make it there, afterall its now been 3 mins. that I'm on hold. Five minutes later I pull up to the restaurant and I'm still on hold. I walk in with my phone still counting down and ask for a manager. I show the manager on duty (Z Morris) my phone and tell him that I called to place an order 8 minutes ago and was placed on hold. He gives me a rushed unsympathetic apology and looks at his phone, realizes it's true then hangs up his line (keep in mind there's hardly anyone in the restaurant). He proceeds to ask me what I would like to order. I place my order with him. At no point does he give me a discount or a free appetizer or anything for my inconvenience. Instead he tells me that he will rush my order, 20 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting. Needless to say, I will never spend my money with this location again.

NOT TRUE HERE!

I think we saw 4 or 5 servers during our dinner, bringing different items including our meal. They were so nice and attentive but not up our grill. It was like they telepathically knew when I needed a new drink as I was thinking it. Totally chill with our lil one to. 
The food was cooked perfectly. I actually ate an entire big mouth burger, the avacado burger. My wife had the sirloin steak, with the most amazing orgasm in your mouth loaded taters!

Not that bad yet!
Checked out their 2 for 20 menu, even with having low expectations about it my girlfriend and i skipped it and went for the main menu. I haven't been to a chili's in years and couldnt figure out the stupid ass menu. Honestly, very few pictures and some entrees had 0 description in one area, listed again on another page or in the little side menu planted on the tables. Given ample time I perhaps could have made an educated choice but our waitress was rushing/borderline harassing us.
As soon as we sat down she asked if we were ready to order, BEFORE getting our drinks, really? Who does that...
She came around 3 times in the next 5 minutes and asked ""Have you decided yet? -- Did you guys pick on something? -- Know what you want now?""

Um. If customers have their noses planted in the menu and they arent looking up at all, NO THEYRE NOT READY

As a result I ordered a classic, cheese steak, cant screw that up right?
Sigh...
0 taste for anything but the peppers, BARELY. I didnt notice the onions at all which is really sad, the cheese was gross :( and their fries are exactly the same as jack in the box regular fries.... wow ruined my whole day and i WONT be returning to ANY chilis again for years.

Def wasn't our first choice. After dropping off our month and a half infant at the babysitter it left us with little time, worst part was we had made reservations at a place across town. Thinking on our feet we settled for outback which was 3 blocks away. Hoping to get a table there was an hour wait. I couldn't believe it. Especially when this outback had horrible reviews on Yelp. 

Looking across the street we spotted this Chili's and opted for it. 

We searched and searched for about ten minutes for a place to park. It didn't help especially when my hubby is picky about where he parks. [his mustang is his life] but this time he had no choice. Any parking spot would have to do. 

Finally getting inside we noticed people were waiting. We prayed th eline wouldn't be long. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes and she told us to take a seat and it'd go by fast. The next people that came in we're told they could wait in the bar.. gee i wish they would have told us that, i could have used a couple drinks. next, another couple came in and were seated right away. My husband got up to ask why and the hostess announced that you can go online and be put on the waiting list. Good to know for future nights to chili's. That'll def save time and help my poor tummy from starving.

Once we were seated a nice good looking gentlemen came and asked if it was our first time there or if we were familiar with the menu or specials. We said we'd been there a few times but not in a while so he explained every thing clearly and even offered which drinks were the best tasting. 

I ordered a strawberry margarita, which i thought ended up being way too sweet and i always order strawberry margaritas when i go out. The hubby got a martini and another drink but i cant remember the name of that one. Food wise, he ordered the beef fajitas which he thought was delicious but not very much meat. Mostly veggies such as bell peppers. I ordered the fish taco's. They were very dry, but good. My favorite and his on our plates was the rice. So moist and fluffy. Probably one of the best rice's i've had a restaurant that wasn't authentic mexican. 

So basically i gave 3 stars for the waiter and the rice, haha.. other than that it was just an okay experience nothing special.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,0,0,3,fWHUq_960ZZCAnn1yGT4Pg

I usually associate this place with overweight people with unhealthy food because my previous experiences here have been for drinks because of how close the location is to my previous work.
Ps a BIG heads up about drinking here: because this is a ""family establishment"" the waiter wouldn't bring us more than 1 drink at a time. I know this because we tried to order 2 shots for my friend and the waiter refused. So what my friend had to do was take 1 shot and then less than 5 sec later order another one. I have to say, it is a great way to force drinks down people's throats.
Anyways went here on a Friday afternoon for their lunch specials as per suggestion by a friend. 7-8$ gets you an appetizer and a small lunch entree. I got the carnitas tacos with a side of tortilla soup. My friend got the taco bowl with tortilla soup. We both got the soup because the waiter suggested it. Truthfully the soup was ok. Kinda salty and bland at the same time. Like the broth was salty but it had no other taste. I had to ask for extra tortilla for some extra crunch and a side of pico de gallo to make it edible.
As for the tacos, the carnitas were bland as well and it came with a side of fries. The fries were soggy and not tasty.

I can say the food here is always good - nothing upscale but there's a nice variety of choices and everything I've had is usually pretty good.  Its certainly much better than Applebees (don't get me started on them).

However, what I've noticed with this location is your satisfaction will depend largely on your server.

A recent time I'm pretty sure our server was stoned - at least I hope he was - because he got literally EVERY SINGLE thing wrong - right down to giving us the wrong check.  Got the appetizer wrong, got both entrees wrong (one in 3 different ways), overcharged for one entree even though I held up the menu and pointed to what I wanted (could I have made it any simpler?), and gave us the check for the table next to us - who had left 20 mins prior and was 40% higher than ours.  I'm a pretty patient person, but seriously, how many mistakes can 1 server make on a single table?  And the glassy eyes - maybe it was an Rx that caused him to be so off but I don't think he was all there.

Yesterday I ordered a plain med-well hamburger.  After 40+ mins I got a cold med-rare cheeseburger ... again ... how much simpler could I have made it?  I don't really blame the server here - but how it took 40 mins to get a cold burger, I'll never know.

The 2 best servers are Norman (usually works the bar but I haven't seen him lately) and Erika (little blonde always charging around like shes on a mission) - they have never done me wrong.  The guy who wears the NY Giants lanyard isn't half bad, except for the obvious flaw of being a Giants fan.

For starters we walk in and wait to be seated.. the guests before us were asked by the hostess if they would like a booth or a table, after choosing they were seated. We were not asked just seated at a table and then she left, our server came around and we had to ask him if we could have a booth. He tells us we had to wait for one to be available, which was odd because I could see at least 3-4 booths empty and appeared to be clean... but what do I know, maybe they were secretly dirty lol. After about 5 minutes of waiting for a booth we see a lot of people come in, no one around to greet or seat them. As we all wait about another 5 minutes the hostess comes back and we are finally seated. Our server arrived quickly to our table to get our drink orders..... they bring out our sprites which tasted like straight club soda lol and that took forever to get switched out. My son ordered mac and cheese as well as a pizza, I ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken crispers. My sons mac and cheese was close to cold, my steak was so over cooked that it nearly bent my wire from my braces lol and there were more onion and peppers than anything on the skillet, they brought my boyfriend one little container of ranch for 2 orders of fries and the chicken and of course no sign of our server or anyone to ask if this could be refilled. I ordered a watermelon cooler and after tasting mine my boyfriend ordered one for himself, we didn't see our server so the manager came out to take his drink order. Yeah we never got the drink. We were sitting directly across from the kitchen so I could literally see everyone pussyfooting around the kitchen. Took a good 25 minutes to get to go boxes and no one came back to our table so I guess no one gives checks anymore, we then realized we could pay from the kiosk on the table. We did and left. If it weren't for them singing happy birthday to my little guy they wouldn't have even received the 1 star I'm giving them.

The menu is all over the place, I never know what to order. But, they do usually have deals such as 25$ for two. So you order 2 entrees that comes with an appetizer for 25$. Today that was not on the menu anymore. They did have a dinner one for $35 but I didn't really pay much mind to it. 

I've had few different items on their menu. One that I usually get is the Texas fries. It's basically loaded fries (cheese, jalapeños, and bacon). I have had their flat beard before which are pretty good. The beau usually gets their ribs which really aren't anything special. 

They added these screens at each table. You can order your dessert, ask for a refill, look at the menu, play games (for 99cents each game), and pay your bill on. It's pretty neat because it even allows you to split the check and tells you how much to tip!

Once more the service is very quick for the appetizers as well (usually 10-15 minutes depending on how crowded it is). 

After the appetizers you then pick one of the many entrees. There's an entree for everybody no matter what your tastes are. 
The service for the entrees is very quick usually only taking 25 to 35 minutes. If you aren't full yet, there's always a dessert for you! All of the deserts are delicious and the best part is that you can order them from the tablet the table comes with.

The baby back ribs were delicious. Succulent, flavorful and falling off of the bone - lick your fingers good, and the french fries were fantastic. I only ate two of them. My husband was so bummed out about his salad, that I traded him my plate for his. I thought 'how bad could it be? it's a salad!'. 

It was bad. It was really bad. My tastebuds were assaulted with an overbearing onion-meets-citrus-meets-bitter-arugula. The grilled chicken wasn't seasoned well, and disappeared into the pile of greens. Every once in a while I stumbled upon a black bean, and I think someone accidentally spilled a few kernels or corn.

Chili's has good food. I don't remember what exactly we ordered last time, but it was tasty. This time, I had the turkey sandwich, which was complemented by honey mustard and sweetened bacon. If you don't like foods that taste too sugary, I guess you might find this distracting. Personally, I loved it.

Another person had the pulled pork sandwich. I sampled some of the meat and sauce. Both were excellent, imo. The meat was tender and the sauce was sweet (again) with a bit of a spicy kick. I actually started dipping fries in the sauce later on because I couldn't stand to waste it.

Meh, not great. Service was not the best. Good was ok! What I am mat upset about is our alcoholic drink... Let me just tell you a lil something about me real quick.... I'm a cheap date, lol it doesn't take me but a few sips of anything alcoholic to feel buzzed or drunk lmao! The drink we ordered either had a thimble full or none in it. I not only couldn't taste any, but never got me two sip buzz. I drank the whole almost $9 drink and nothing. Super disappointed guys!!

What we could see was filthy, so who knows what the kitchen looked like. Well, actually on the way to the bathroom, I could see the kitchen. Someone had dumped tortilla chips on the floor and just left them. Ugh. 

We arrived on Sunday around 2pm. There were so many tables that needed to be bussed. Maybe they were short staffed? It seemed as though there were enough people working, and someone could have stepped in to clear some tables. 

Anyway, we split a Bacon Avocado Chicken sandwich for lunch. It is skinless boneless chicken, with provolone, sauteed onions, spring mix, tomato, cilantro pesto mayo all on a toasted pretzel bun. I didn't realize that it was on a pretzel bun, and this was my first time trying one. It was actually really flavorful, and soft. The chicken was very moist, and the spring mix was a nice change from iceburg lettuce. I am not a huge fan of cilantro, but this was fairly mild and the whole combination tasted good. 

For dessert we again split a dish, and got the Skillet Toffee Fudge Brownie. This came out in a small cast iron skillet. The brownie was hot, the vanilla ice cream was nice and cold, and there were bits of toffee and some caramel drizzled on top. I liked it a lot more than my husband did. It was good, but it was more sugary sweet than it was rich and cholatey, if that makes sense. 

When we first sat down, I noticed the computer screen at the table and thought 'oh no, I will have to work to figure out how to place my order using this screen'. Not the case. Our waiter took our order. The waiter did come by to give us our check as well, and he put it onto this table top computer. This allowed us to see everything on the screen, it even gave us the opportunity to split the check if we needed to do so. It offered a suggested tip, with a sliding scale to change the amount to your preference. This part was really easy. At the end, it printed out a receipt as well. The screen itself though...dirty. Ugh. 

We have not been to Chili's in awhile, and after this visit we most likely will not be back any time soon.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,0,0,2,gkgAXgDBSyzHJyfUPKe4sA

They have a new menu, which we didn't really care for, having been regular customers of Chili's for at least 10 years. We went for the ""2 for 22.00"" special. I had the chicken and pasta dish. My lunch guest had the small grilled steak. The salads were standard house salad with ordinary iceberg lettuce and a few spring greens. The ranch dressing was nicely seasoned ... however, the croutons were WAY over-baked, dry, and resembled cardboard in taste and texture. The chicken was rubbery and under-grilled. The pasta was a pile of over-cooked tubes covered in pale yellow ""cheese-sauce"" that had the consistancy of Elmer's glue. Kraft macaroni and cheese has this stuff beat by a mile. My friend's steak was more than 50 percent gristle and fat and he couldn't even cut through it. The broccholi was crunchy, though the mashed potatoes were fine. When our server came back and gathered our plates, she looked surprised to see how little we ate and asked if we wanted ""doggie bags"" and I said ""absolutely NOT!"" and she only smiled and said ""I understand."" She quicly brought us our check without asking if we enjoyed any part of the meal. I think she may have read our minds and left the subject alone. So sad they took off a lovely grilled salmon from the menu, as well as a pasta and grilled chicken dish, which was beautifully prepared.

4451907,2012-02-25,0,H5Y6o9H4rtxbHJFgLqI6Fw,"When I was in college I dined at Chili's often - often enough to have sampled almost everything on their menu. I hadn't been in awhile, but all the staples are still there - out-of-control burgers with lots of toppings, the ribs, a few scatterings of fish dishes, one pasta dish, and of course, the appetizers and my favorite - the chicken crispers. 

This Chili's was super packed when my boyfriend and I showed up on a Friday night. Luckily, we were able to snag a two-person booth quicker than the said wait-time of 25 minutes (yikes!). Anyway, we were seated and greeted by our waitress who was pleasant, but seemed a bit overrun and busy. However, being a Friday night at Chili's what else is there to expect? I ordered a Stella and a water, while my boyfriend went for a Sam Adams draft.

For some reason there wasn't much on the menu that was enticing me. I thought about going for the ribs, but ended up ordering a new addition to the menu, a twist on the chicken crispers - honey chipotle chicken crispers. Well, this item was somewhat of a let-down. The crispers were much more sweet than I imagined them to be. I was thinking something with a spicy kick, but not so. Of course they gave me a heaping amount of fries and the corn on the cob, which was good.

My boyfriend's fajitas looked much better than my meal. He got the trio, with shrimp, chicken, and steak. I did try a few bites, and the shrimp was a tad over-cooked, but the chicken and steak were very good.

Overall this place is great for families (there was even a person running around making balloon animals) and it's just like any other typical Chili's. I found no huge problems with the service or the food, but it's simply another neighborhood Chili's.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,3,jTDGYGSvQDmcmR2ihphPrA

The variety is huge and everyone will win, whether if your a hardcore meat eater, vegetarian, or even if you are on a diet. The flavors for their ribs are always changing, currently they have a beer flavor and a Dr. Pepper flavor. I love their happy hour, which is from 3pm-7pm Mon- Thurs, and Sunday all day, not sure if i'm missing another time slot in between there. For Happy hour they will have appetizers at 4.99 or 2.99, and drinks such as beer starting at $3 and Margaritas starting at $4.50.

Some of my favorite items are their Spinach and Artichoke dip, chips and salsa , chicken crispers, ribs, cinnamon apples, burgers, fries, ranchsauce, chili soup, steak and shrimp fajitas, and molten chocolate cake. 

This time i ate the Grilled Sirloin with Grilled Avocado, it is one of the  items from the Healthy choices. Its a 6 oz sirloin or u can upgrade it to 9 oz, it is drizzled with a cilantro sauce, served with cooked cherry tomatoes and garlic and with a salad all on one plate. I always order mines medium rare. 

I also got the Skillet queso, which is a mix of ground beef with beans and nacho style cheese. Comes served with chips and salsa. Great chips, they are warm and thin. 

And we also got the Molten Chocolate cake. Its chocolate cake with warm chocolate in the middle, ice cream on top with hard shell chocolate.",-gSz76_bKNJsKM2adr12yw,0,1,4,jTeR9l2S34J5TO-XMmfp5A

After only 8 minutes or so the server showed up she was super nice I believe her name was Boons at least that's what was on the receipt. So my question for her was how much extra would it be to have only shrimp fajitas (I only eat seafood and my friend is a veggie as well) Boons wasn't completely sure but she stated that she thought it was about $2 and that was fine for me. My friend was not sure what to get at this moment (it was her first time and possibly last time). I tell Boons go ahead and start our apps and for sure the margaritas and we will place the order my friend also requested a water. The time is now 10:12 we new they closed at 11 we just wanted to eat a little but mainly drink and take our food Togo. Soooooo we are sitting and sitting but we had some things to talk about but then I happened to look at my phone and notice that it was now about 1030 no drinks no apps no WATER!!!! I happened to glance to my left and notice how filthy the place was I mean there was literally trash EVERYWHERE DISGUSTING!!!! I tell my friend this place is a mess and I'm leaving in 5minutes!! I normally do not glance at other diners when I'm in. A restaurant but for some reason the trash in the floor had me starting to look everywhere and where the heck are my MARGARITAS?!

I happened to catch eye contact with him and I'm assuming he says something and she soon appeared with the margaritas and appetizer (CHEESE FRIES ARE AMAZING, no bacon of course lol) and apparently no side plates come with apps.We then place the rest of our order and I request that WATER AGAIN for my friend. It's now about 1040 no water but a lot of sex Ed well until she decided to finish out the other tables that were there. A group of 4 people came in after us received drinks food and service far better than we did!!!

YES I SUCKED DOWN THAT MARGARITA QUICK hey I was in a mission.. Anyway another mako it section has now moved closer to us because as Boons begins to work on the computer her love shows up behind her and they go at it again!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm furious and ready to go I begin mumbling loudly about the I professionalism that is not happening! Soon the session breaks up and out comes the food!! Yay it's only 1050 now. Boons places the meal down I have a fajita and tortillas not the side of beans and rice I requested not the two sides of avocado we ordered; she then states that she will be right back with those items at that time I request a plate so that I can eat my fajitas on it instead of off the skillet as well as a water she returns with everything but the side plate! I then nibble a little because im upset and annoyed by the dirty staff and restaurant. My friend finishes her meal !!Boons has not checked on us at all!! Eventually she pops up I'm like can we put that desert order in please and get a couple boxes! She brings the boxes the desert was shortly after and then I asked for togos for the desert as well.

The queso was terrible because the menu described it as cheese with seasoned beef. Quite frankly the queso was an overly salty bean dip that looked like congealed beef gravy. Blech! To our server's credit he made it right and swapped out a spinach artichoke dip for us.

I had the Memphis dry rub ribs which were really good and nicely seasoned with a peppery, brown sugar and paprika mix. They were served hot and the sauce had a nice tang to it. My husband had the mixed fajitas with chicken and shrimp. It was pretty darn good as well with our daughter getting a cheeseburger, mandarin oranges and a chocolate milk.

I don't like the new table top screens that you can pay your bill with. It looks like a tablet with a stand. Not a problem unless you have a savvy preschooler that attempts to order dessert and another round of margaritas. Yeah, not so great on that point. The tablet ended up pushed to the far side of the table.

Our server was great in getting us napkins and removing the hideous bean dip. He did explain that Chili's was going to some pains due to getting rid of their bussers and expeditors which means the server has to do it all and it really detracts from service overall. Overall our experience was a 3, 3 1/2 star rating due to the service and the ribs pulling the numbers higher but Chili's needs to yank their 'queso' that is truly a bean dip and nothing more.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,2,0,3,_oLOv7MmuLLu6w8TcFXLPQ

So we just gave up on our meal and asked for our check, also advising our server that the food was super salty, and that the sauce was cold and we were not happy with what we were served.  She asked if we wanted anything else, of course we said no since we were already turned off.  She just gave us our check, didn't offer a discount or apology or anything!  So it was like she didn't care that we were not happy with our service.  That type of service was just unexpected but I guess it just wasn't the servers day.",VtbMdCdlmNkcFNj1JB9EIw,0,0,2,4puEB-QviFzWZVW8WboqEA

Been years since I have been to a Chili's, so can't say how it fares across board, but it is decent food at good prices here.  Probably more on the cheap end actually with those 2 for $20 deals.

Went with the baby backs, the more tangy sauce....the ribs were pretty tender, fairly easy to pull apart off the bone.  A good rib, just not a great rib.  I am getting spoiled with these more spendy BBQ places in town.

Tried the burger, again, decent but not great.  Same thing, becoming jaded with all the exceptional burger spots in town.

Had the jalapeno fries or whatever they call them as our app.  Not bad, wish they layered the cheese and goodies though, since all the fries on the bottom go naked.

Service was a little slow, but we had a big group, so I chalk it up to that.  Won't really ding them for that in our case.

Overall, this will be a good Chili's to attend, if you want Chili's.  Otherwise, keep searching Yelp for better craving reducers!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,1,3,iCTseD9IHMBhqRFx8oemvg

My order was not correct, when I explained what I ordered, Sarah, the bartender, didn't want to look at my order, which I pulled up on my phone - she just walked away.  When she came back with one of the burgers, she tells me they didn't make the other one correct either.  I asked to speak to a manager.  He comes out - blames it on the online ordering system (which I agree, is terrible), never apologizes. I told him I'm mad that I pre-tipped when I prepaid online.  Didn't offer refund or anything - just asks if there is anything else he can do to make my order correct.  Will be a long time before I give them my business again!",1n_zmXvCDEQgAxJ-j1DMng,0,0,1,meYyCXE2AUAb2WfaKoxzQA
5193102,2015-08-30,0,H5Y6o9H4rtxbHJFgLqI6Fw,"Went yesterday (Friday) for my birthday. Was seated quickly and even was able to choose which booth we wanted. 

Our server Brian was awesome. He kept our drinks topped off and made sure we were never in need of anything. Originally we ordered the Queso Skillet and Chips and an order of fried onion rings. Both arrived fairly quickly yet both needed to be returned just as quickly. The chips were so salty it came with a side of High Blood Pressure. The Queso was subpar. Tasted as if it had been sitting all night. The onion rings were so overly cooked and burnt that my husband refused to have them remake them. We did choose to have them swap out the original Queso for White Spinach Queso and it was actually one of the best appetizers I've tasted in awhile. They really did regain themselves with that one. 

In addition to my appetizer we ordered two kids meals that weren't bad for the price and hubby and I split a Mix and Match Trio platter with an extra order of shrimp. The hubby said his steak was really tender, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. The vegetables were charred very nicely without being over cooked or mushy. The warm tortilla shells were a pleasant contrast to the cool creaminess of the sour cream and guacamole. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the hint of spicy was just right. 

I had the Triple Berry Margarita on the rocks. Another awesome for Chili's. So much so that I had to order another! They weren't skimpy on the alcohol nor was the flavor over bearing. 

Sometime during our meal my husband was able to sneak away and let the staff know it was my birthday because halfway through the meal they came out with a vanilla scoop ice cream topped with hot fudge. Pretty basic since the hubby said the lady next to us who also had a birthday was brought a slice of fudge cake. But hey, it's free and unexpected so I was happy! Especially since I had no room for dessert and my girls ate it anyway 

Other than having to return our original appetizers, our dinner and waiter was awesome! Price wasn't too expensive. They applied the 10% military discount to all items except alcohol so it allowed for a nice tip for our waiter. We usually add the 10% we get off on top of their normal tip. I know he was happy.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,0,0,4,q3T43N890T-vYjybE3c7_g

As for the food it's average for this type of restaurant. I enjoy the 2 for $20 deal because you get an appetizer and two entrees.
 
Tonight's experience was interesting. We were seated immediately by a waiter. A group of four women with too much perfume sat next to our table. We asked our waiter to move and he really didn't pay attention to us. I stood up because I couldn't take that strong perfume smell diffusing throughout the room... all I could taste was the perfume! I walked to the bar area and told the hostess the situation and she cleared a table for us A.S.A.P; it worked out that Cameo was working that area and became our new waitress. That guy, who's name I didn't get, was rather rude to us and didn't seem to care.

B.T.W: Cameo is a great waitress. She works hard for little in return! We appreciate the over-the-top service you provided.",Fzz-0v1yHLaWuTV64b1miA,0,0,4,5VteitRNxDADocey89LWKg

You are pretty sure you think that they think that means you are doing ""the drugs.""  You are going to Chili's, pal.  That's what these guys are here for -- a place everyone can nod at while you eat your fries and listen to how Aunt Ethel's goiter is doing.

The good thing about Chili's is that everything is very well-priced;  three people can get entrees and a giant starter for $40.  Good thing your Uncle who doesn't know you always sends you these gift cards for Chili's!   Perhaps he always knew you needed them;  because as you're there on these holiday eats,  nodding about Ethel's thyroid problems, you know that you certainly didn't want to directly pay for this to happen to you.

Did I mention there's a person whose sole job is to make balloon animal hats?  And that they are actually very attentive with drink refills?  Instant extra star.",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,1,0,3,OzSfgcUXxiZydz7Cd4-XAA

For some reason this Chilis will not accept phone orders within a half hour of closing. I once called at 9:32 (they close at 10) and was told I could not place an order. I had just gotten out of work and wanted to pick up food on my way home. I was told I was more than welcome to come in person and order food to go. I explained I wouldn't get there until 9:50 and again was told that was my only option. So I drove there and had to place an order and sit and wait for it. I watched a guy come in and sit down at the bar and order food (to stay and eat there) at 9:59 but apparently me calling in an order at 9:32 was not acceptable. No where on their website does it state this ""rule"" about when you can place to go orders so I'm not sure how that is good business. I was so annoyed and probably will order from the Applebees across the street next time instead.",sxxL6TjvDolUE7GeWBRZrg,0,0,3,LuU1JXLQy30ERyXCO_F56w

Today, I ordered the fajitas triple play, which included beef, chicken, and shrimp.  It was put on top of grilled onions and green peppers.  They served it with a small plate shredded cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.  This was disappointing because it was so little, just about a spoonful each.

When they bought out my plate, the shrimp was missing and our server said it was coming, by the time I had eaten everything else, they brought out the shrimp.  It was good, but I would have enjoyed it with my meal!

I must admit this was an ""okay"" meal, not something I would recommend, but if had no other choice, would eat it over perhaps something else.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,3,kVmBsKsQOUuTh2oCLgRO4A
