178910,2013-08-11,0,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"Tried the regular cheeseburger combo. 
First: the burger. It's okay. Kind of a neutral beef taste, not bad but not all that outstanding.
The toppings: possibly the freshest tasting I've had at a restaurant.
the onion was strong, the tomato bursting with juice, and the lettuce crisp and tasteful.
the fries are more like french fries used to be, not the bland tasteless ones served by most fast food restaurants. All in all, a nice cheeseburger experience.",m305_uyUl6G65VXYJGCv0w,3,0,4,qn5k7KtrjEjqXo1dLLPILA
201712,2013-12-11,1,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"I have tried this place twice. This time I went all out and got the onion rings. They try to make up for lack of taste with size. I ordered a large and it is quite a lot. But when you get down to it, it is only 7 rings. One thing about onion rings is you need to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter. Neither of these two main things were present. The batter is flavorless and falls off into one big mess. The onions were so hard they were not even cooked. When frying foods you need to make sure things are fully cooked. In this case size makes no difference. 

I've had the burgers there and are generally, bleh, same as everyone else. Nothing special. Flavorless meat with so much toppings you are wondering if you are eating a topping sandwich instead of a hamburger. 

Not worth the premium prices and bad onion rings.",2gKWbRWSFWiJDKe_xEzbVw,1,0,2,Kw5ikRpsb7dNEEwrdn4BuQ

Burger and chicken sandwich were ""ok"" but way overpriced. avocado spread made bun very soggy and fell apart. bacon good.

I chose the two onion rings/two zucchini sticks. my husband loved them, I did not care for the coating on them. he ate all of them.  other than the offering of the giant zucchini sticks , nothing very special here.  they do have hot breakfast meals which are available at night too.  in addition they have fish, and some sandwiches too on menu.  look at about $11 for sandwich/burger, side and a drink.",LVNY_kblr7GZBGJLmzOq6Q,0,0,1,zEseIpPYB5VX53rck3N_7Q
253031,2013-01-23,0,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"Went into this place yesterday to pick up lunch for the office. My dad recommended it and it wasn't too far from work so I thought i'd give it a shot. I placed my order and got my food relatively quickly (to go). 

Much to my dismay, when I got back to work the order was COMPLETELY wrong. Our two burgers and onion rings somehow turned into a burger (not even the right one), a chicken sandwich and fries. I gave them a call because I didn't have enough time on my lunch break to go back to get the right order. I explained the situation to the manager who said I could come back that day or the next and they would replace the order for me. I told her I'd be back same time tomorrow to try it again. 

Went back in today and saw the manager as I walked in running orders to customers. She remembered my call and got my order started right away. I placed a couple more orders for other co-workers and she offered me a 50% discount on the new orders, which I didn't ask for and appreciated. They still got my order mixed up with someone else (which is what I imagine the problem was yesterday as well), but I caught it this time. 

Anyway, enough about that. The food was good. I got the Jalapeno Burger and it was pretty spicy, but the flavors were good and the quality of the ingredients seemed above par for most fast food. The onion rings (which are the source of much debate in the reviews apparently) were okay. My advice: try them and see if they're for you. Definitely better than the fries though. My boss said the Pastrami sandwich was great as well.

Bottom line: It's a new restaurant, orders are going to get mixed up and the employees don't know the menu very well yet. These are problems that (hopefully) will go away after a few weeks. Management was more than accomodating when it came to fixing the mistake, so I'd still say the service was good. The food is good and I will definitely be returning. Just make sure you check your orders before you leave.",yf2GPyegETvno2o4Pv9lBw,0,0,4,ETg7Gt6PVhTXQFM0u6M2NQ

On Saturday and Sunday their special is the 3-egg combo - which is everything I listed above for $7.  My husband got the BLT sandwich which is said was good for the price and had just the right amount of bacon.  It gets the 4th star because it's a nice and clean restaurant with fast service and very little waiting - which is not what you get at the more popular local breakfast places.  For a good quick hot made-to-order breakfast, you can't go wrong here.

One highlight was the southwestern salad which is a special right now. Fantastic salad in a huge bowl. The veggies are very fresh and the dressings they provide are great. 

The barn burner burger was juicy and spicy just like it should be. Paired with the onion rings which were crispy, and by far some of the biggest rings I have seen, made a great meal.

Happy very friendly staff members.

Ridiculous amount of food.

We had a coupon for the Four piece fish dinner. Beautiful, fat, well coated, crispy, wild caught, white, Pollack Fish. Included salad or soup, fries, onion rings, and a roll. We opted for the lettuce, red cabbage, and tomato chopped salad with Italian dressing. We also had huge fresh cut  Zucchini sticks . To wash all this down we had very taste fresh made iced tea.

Two of these whopping meals with our coupon cost us a total of $19.44. Are you kidding me? We had to bring stuff home. There was just to much for us to eat everything. 

We can't wait to try some of the other menu items. This may be our new dining 

Anyone who likes fried fish needs to try this. Anyone who likes food needs to go there.

1069156,2013-03-02,0,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"I'm going to break my ""no-chain-reviews"" rule here, because despite only having two locations in the Vegas area, Farmer Boys is a pretty big chain in So Cal, especially in the OC/IE area. But it's new(ish) to Vegas, so... deal.

Farmer Boys had a unique place in my heart back home -- better than fast food, but not quite restaurant quality. It was the place you went to when you didn't really want to get gussied up for a restaurant (nobody REALLY likes to gussy, let's face it) but could go for something a little classier than Mickey D's. When I heard there was a new location relatively close to me, I was on it like Comet.

Now... I understand this location hasn't been open for all that long. But the service... well, is it so much to ask that my order not be interrupted three times because you messed up on the prior order? Then go running around for a pen because you don't have one readily available? I mean, seriously, that's about the extent of your interaction with servers, so don't mess it up.

As for the food, it's still a pretty good quality. I went for the chili and cheese omelette (Ryan's Rule for Yelp Dining: Everything can be made better with chili) and it was pretty good. I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. I apologize if I sound like a broken record... broken record... broken record... but again, it was not restaurant quality, but certainly better than an Anything McAnything. Though I didn't have one this time around, I remember the burgers being pretty tasty too; I'll have to get one next time.

So this Farmer Boys location takes up the mantle I left behind in Orange County: somewhere in between a fast-food place and a real restaurant. And that's okay... something's gotta fill that void, right?",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,1,0,3,kw7DvlNwEaDClI9a-7W7LQ

We ordered the farmer burger, BLT, onion rings and a shake. 
It was 20 bucks. I'm not someone who goes to expensive places a lot so to me this was A LOT. 
When I got my hamburger it was HUGE. Which made me feel better about paying a lot. The BLT tho was tiny. My sister even got a bit mad. 
The onion rings were good. I liked how they had ranch, jalapeños and ect things for people to get. 
Well the hamburger was pretty good and too big for me to eat. 
We didn't get our milkshake until like 20 minutes after our food. Did not like that. 
The sandwich was okay.

The burger was great on a sesame seed bun, it held together nicely with that perfect amount of ""good sandwich"" drip.

I ordered their bacon/avocado cheeseburger with their thousand island dressing on the side. I wasn't sure if I would like avocado with thousand island. Turns out-I didn't. 

The burger showed up pretty quickly with no bacon or avocado on it. Since I paid for the extra items, I let them know what the problem was. The manager then comes to our table to make sure we were not hiding the bacon or avocado anywhere. Awkward!

He takes my burger back, and 30 seconds later bacon and avocado show up on my burger. I did like the bun they used-it was soft and had no sesame seeds. On the other hand, my wife ordered the standard cheeseburger with pickles and mustard only. Sesame seeds showed up on that burger? I am not sure why the difference. ..

The fries were ok-- although s little under seasoned for my liking. The onion rings tasted like leather with coating thicker than my ex-wifes makeup. No bueno!

Prices were OK , and the place was clean. One bonus was that they offer Pepsi instead of Coke!  Yay!

If you get the onion rings or zucchini, it is a matter of preference. I have brought many people here and they LOVE them. I do not, they are too greasy for my liking. I'm not in love with their fries either, but to each their own. The rest of the food makes up for it. 
The breakfast sandwiches and French Toast
 are my breakfast favorites. Their bacon is always hot and delicious, which is something that really matters to me. 
Pretty much everything you get here is hot and fresh.

3391588,2014-05-02,0,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"One day I had to drop by Wal Mart for some quick shopping, then since it was time for lunch I thought I would get some Del Taco, but wait there was a place I've never been to or heard of, ""Farmer Boys"". I didn't even know their menu, but could see alot of cars going through the drive thru and plenty of cars parked outside. I took a chance and ordered a burger combo with zucchini through the drive thru to take home. I did kind of notice the bag, when handed to me was extremely heavy for what I ordered, but didn't think much of it (maybe some heavy ketchup packets?). As I was driving along I could smell the aroma of fresh zucchini so I thought I would take a quick bite. I reached into the bag and could feel one, so I started to pull it from the bag and it was HUGE! like a foot long and enormous! My first thought was I need to tell my wife and take her here, she would love it. I got home and had a good lunch and was glad to find such a good place for once. We went back there yesterday and went inside, again it was very busy and people know good value and good food, so it was a good sign. Our lunch was really good, but I guess the only complaint from my wife was the air conditioner was turned up too high and it was freezing. I actually like it that way, but even for me it was a bit over the top. Overall service is excellent and the staff even comes out to the tables and takes away trays when they can. The decor inside is like a old style farm/barn and kind of rustic, but still it's in the shape of a fast food chain so they don't quite get the effect across, but it's a excellent effort. The menu has some good variety and if you don't want junk food, you can go the healthy route if you wish. (Salads, wraps...). The menu has calorie information, but no one should eat like that everyday right? so no big deal, enjoy and treat yourself. 
They have many locations in California and seems they have about 5 locations in the Las Vegas area, but it would be nice to see one in Henderson, just a little bit closer to where we live. Good stuff!",rn2DB_YX0BvToYe50RNr_Q,0,0,4,-H5j8L_7DVYg_5RrZBVsOQ

(Apparently, spending too much time with your mother is a great personal sacrifice. sniff, sniff. Or, maybe she's afraid I'll embarrass her, and, considering the fact that even I never know what I might say next, I guess she has a point).

 Anyway, she got the burger with bacon and avocado, so of course it was good. And I got a BLT, which more fast food places ought to serve as it is one of nature's most perfect foods. Of course, it contained somewhat less than the pound o' pork I would have used, but it was pretty tasty nonetheless. The fried zucchini is great- it comes in a huge order of crispy battered spears and the onion rings are actually onion rings. YUM!  (Anyway, I think these were good. As far as I know, they tasted like ranch dressing and ketchup, respectively).

The service was great, meaning the cashier was friendly, you could understand her voice on the speaker, the order was served up in a box (like doughnuts- not squished in a bag! Yay!), and, drumroll please: they got our order right! This was drive-thru Nirvana!

I would definitely return. I would like to try their breakfast- they have actual hash browns and fried eggs, not just variations on an Egg McMuffin like most fast food places. However, a meal like that would lose something in being packed in styrofoam to go, so if I want to give the indoor dining a try, I guess I'll have to go without her!",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,3,3,4,C32GG0NuJ5evR4L0X_Gm_w

The customer service was nice and the employees are very polite. However, the food is overpriced for the quality. I ordered a bacon avocado burger and the avocado was only on one side of the burger. There is hardly any produce on the burger, it's all about the beef. The beef is cooked on an open flame, which is why I had to wait 10 minutes to receive the order after paying (no one else was in the drive thru at the time). I did not really notice much of a difference in flavor of the patty to most other fast food chains. 

Paying 11+ dollars for a single, regularly sized combo, I honestly expected to be blown away and sadly I was fairly disappointed.

However, they do serve you the food and the employees go around asking the patrons if they need anything else with their meal. On a brighter note the quality of the food makes up for the price and I can say you get your money's worth, which would make me pick this place over Denny's. They also have a yelp check in burger combo for only $5.50, which I have yet to try. In addition, they have daily specials, which also makes it more affordable.

So what went wrong today, well I walked in and I waited and waited, then walked up to the line for the counter, one person in front of me being helped.

No, I had to wait for the one cashier, even though they had employees all over the place. 
I get up to the counter and I am greeted, oh okay. Then another employee walks by and says hello. So, maybe I was judging too quickly.
My food came out and the French fries were ice cold. No one ever asked if I needed a refill on my drink. The burger had too much sauce on it, and it was runny. But it still tasted good.

Firm. Hot. Crispy. Exactly what I love so much about it. The third piece was on the soggy side but still good. My fourth and final piece was horrid. It was a limp mass of green yuck. The breading wouldn't even stick to it. And the seeds underneath the breading were brown. I feel that piece of zucchini was either left out too long or wasn't a good squash to begin with. Either way I did not eat that last piece.

In the end, a big burger and the three pieces of zucchini I did eat were filling. The restaurant, which looks like Grandma's dining room back in the country, was not very clean. There was a lot of crap on the floors. Mostly burger toppings. Many of the tables were not clean. And the trash cans were about over flowing. I think they were understaffed.

I had a philly cheesesteak.  It was pretty tiny considering it cost $6.89 pre tax.  The bread was more of a flatbread instead of a hoagie bread; it was weird.  It was a bit heavy on the green peppers.  The cheese (provolone) to steak ratio was good though.  The meat was gross though.  It was bland and had a mushy texture.  I'm thinking that the meat was boiled instead of grilled.

My friends seemed to enjoy their burgers, but they also seemed a bit small for the over $6 price point (without fries).

The onion rings were good but once again I'm not sure if they were worth the $3.39 price.  They are huge and are an actual onion ring (not the composite mushy stuff).

In my original review I said I would not go back, but Farmer Boys lured me in. Mostly because it is so close to where I work and when I get off work I have limited options as to where I can eat. Typically I try not to eat out during my work week, but this past week I was being lazy because I had had a head cold. So - cheeseburger to the rescue!

This time I went with the ""Natural Burger"", which I honestly enjoyed much more than their regular cheeseburger. The cheese was really melted into the patty, which was nice. But there were a lot of onions on the burger I ended up picking off. Next time I'll just say no onions. 

Instead of fries I ordered onion rings, but ummm I really, really did not like these rings. They were just really not the style I like. The breading was falling off before I got home (because I'll be honest I DID eat one while driving down the road). The batter is very thin and the rings are very big and chunky. I think this is really just a preference thing - but the onion rings here were not for me.

New overall opinion - A-OK. Would I go back? Yes. Would I order the onion rings? No. Maybe I'll just stick strictly with the burgers and try the breakfasts some time.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,3,_MGA6z3nziTDyAagEeGpUA

I went back inside and told the girl who rolled her eyes, not at me but at the mixups and disorganization that seemed to haunting this place today.  She gave me my cookie with a smile, apologized and wished me a god day.

This is only the second time I've eaten here, I am not sure if there will be a third time.   The $5 off voucher he gave me I am sure will be passed to someone else as I probably will not be giving this place another shot.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,9,6,2,bKDLwV34jE-hT-qXCwf9cQ

The Farmers burger lacked anything resembling taste and to be honest I wasn't thrilled with how it felt in my hand. It was very stiff and reminded me of a day old AM/PM burger... you know a coaster between to rock hard buns. 

My wife had the breakfast burrito and all she could say was... We should have gone to Jack in the Box... I don't think I need to say anything more. 

The employees were really friendly and fixed my wife's bacon burrito when it showed up at the table with no bacon. 

I would say try this place and maybe you can find what you are looking for. For me it's too far away to justify mediocre food when In N Out and Freddie's are just across the street.",eXVdbhzZGvIVbqVJzP2bxQ,2,0,2,1Cz7iDwt6b1Q9S5UVlr5sQ

I called corporate and she was surprised but she never heard anything from the area manager either. Farmer Boys reaches out to me via Yelp but once I responded, i still didn't hear anything. Corporate was helpful but nothing was done of this issue. Terrible customer service. 

I came here today and ordered a California chicken club combo and a bbq chicken ranch salad. After waiting for 15 minutes I went up to the counter just to ask how much longer my order was going to be. The supervisor checked my receipt, went to the back to talk to the cooks, and then comes back to me and says the the club sandwich takes longer because they have to fry the chicken. FYI, the chicken on my salad is also fried but she never mentioned that at all.  As she was saying that though, I hear the chicken bring dropped in to the fryer so it makes me wonder if my order was skipped over or forgotten. After 20 minutes, I finally got my order but no apology from anyone for the long wait. Once I finally got home, my order was completely wrong and the fries were cold and ended up being trashed.

I am always impressed by their excellent service. You order your meal at the counter, and they bring it out to your table. Even though drinks are self-serve, the servers will come by and check on you, and will refill your drinks. I love their melt sandwiches, soup, and fried zucchini. I tricked myself into thinking that Farmer Boys was super healthy, but now that they have calorie measurements on their menu, I know that the food is hearty (not exactly healthy). But given it's a fast-food joint, there are a lot of worse places you can eat. Watch for daily specials to get a good deal.",Un8zM5fXROJt1i1tKooENw,2,0,4,pDmbUZ6j7co8eTJD_w7_iw
4654990,2016-05-01,8,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"On this wet and wild Las Vegas Saturday morning to delay the pouring rain and wild driving environment I waited for the rain to calm down with a Farmer Boys breakfast. This would be my follow up visit at this location in the shadow of the Eastern McCarren Marketplace Walmart. 

   As soon as I stepped inside, my mind was transplanted from Las Vegas to a barnyard. The farmyard theme permeates the lobby creating an interesting visit. The lobby is decorated with rooster statues, pictures, and other interesting barnyard memorbelia. At Farmer Boys, the barnyard theme is a good thing because the wait from order to table is approximately ten minutes. The restaurant boasts that upon the time of the customer ordering they make the food. 

   Regardless that Farmer Boys makes the food fresh and allegedly use the freshest ingredients; the format is fast food. Just like in Carl's Jr., the customer peruses a menu above the counter and orders. After paying, the employee hands you a number to bring to the table. Disparate from a handful of fast food chains, Farmer Boys features an expansive selection of all day breakfast and lunch/dinner items. I would get a taste out of both. 

    On my leading visit, I ordered the Big Cheese with fries and a beverage. In my opinion this was an ordinary burger that did not stand out from the competition of casual fast food restaurants. However, my opinion differs from several foodies in the Inland Empire. The My Fox LA Hot List Inland Empire voted Farmer Boys the best burger in the Inland Empire. 

   As I began the review, early this morning I went here for breakfast. Using the barnyard apology, the prices are nothing to cock-a-doodle-doo about. The rooster and barnyard theme absorbs the blow of the high prices. Take the breakfast I ordered. The three egg breakfast combo costs around $8.79. That is before you add a beverage. I cannot enjoy breakfast with a beverage. The small coffee added to the combo added up to close to $12. Another comparison is the BLT combo was around $10.75. That is astronomical for a restaurant with a fast food format. If it was not downpouring, it is guaranteed that I would have waved goodbye to the roosters and made a path to a full service breakfast eatery such as Egg Works, Has Houses, IHOP,  or anywhere. 

    This three egg breakfast also included ham, hash browns, and English Muffins. The ham stole the spot light over the three scrambled eggs. This was a decent size juicy ham. It is a good thing that I ordered this over the bacon or sausage. The shift manager who took my order delivered my breakfast and cup of coffee to the table. I appreciate that she would volunteer to refill my mug (not disposable) of coffee  and mentioned that she'd give me a to go coffee cup. For the record this was good coffee. 

   It appears that management might of read Gregg W's review. On my two visits they played oldies in lieu of country. Oldies and a barnyard theme create an upbeat atmosphere. 

  In conclusion I am not in a hurry to return here. Management needs to do something about the high prices. A possible and realistic solution is to include coffee with the breakfast combinations. In similar style to my three star reviews there is a return factor. During my public check-in, my Yelp friend Travis asked me if I tried their breakfast burrito. It is possible that I would return here for a breakfast burrito made with fresh ingredients or to try their large onion rings. What is certain that, I Daniel.

I was kind of surprised by all of the different things they offer. While their burgers looked good and smelled even better, I'm trying to watch what I eat and I thought I'd compromise with a Southwestern Salad...

This wasn't a compromise. This was not a salad with tons of iceberg lettuce and a few things tossed on the top to make it look good. This thing was loaded with good stuff all the way through, and it was good from start to finish. Most importantly I wasn't starving again 2 hours after eating it.

I'm also a fan of their fresh squeezed orange juice. I tried it on a whim and OMG is it good. I'd go back for the Orange Juice alone, but my first experience overall was good enough that I plan on going back again. I even bothered to download their app and if you scan your receipt you get $5 off your next purchase. Trust me, I'll be putting that $5 off to good use shortly.

The employee who took our order was VERY confused by the Yelp deal, and it took her a couple extra minutes to punch it in, but no biggie! It also took 10 minutes for our order to be prepared, but when it was ready, it was fresh and delicious! I highly recommend the cheeseburger as well as the cinnamon bites.

Nah, I'll say a few more things...

The menu is for sure a little over-whelming for a first timer. The salads, which all look really good, are a tad bit too pricey for me. It's lettuce, c'mon peeps. 

Now. I had the regular cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger patty was pre-formed (boo) and cooked correctly, but the bun was cold and tough. Me no likey. Nothing about the burger made my mouth water.

I ordered my burger with onion rings. Some people like them thick, some thin. I am on team THIN. Don't get the onion rings here if you like 'em thin. They are over an inch and a half wide with an enormous amount of breading on them. You actually need to cut them to be able to dip them into any sauce.  It's like they cut a whole onion in half and began to drop them into the frying batter. There was so much batter that the onion barely cooked. Gross. 

I may give them another chance because my friend Mark B. is a real burger lover and we promised to take him there to try the burgers. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to get blown away by awesomeness. Rather, if you'd like to revisit the leather strap that daddy spanked your buns with as a child, order the onion rings.",U2OB6OngndDXcYML0dlq-Q,2,0,2,hhaWCIsbOOs4_SxM7v5kUg

It was very good but I wasn't able to finish it so my boyfriend had the rest. He liked it so much, we decided to go back today for another. We got 2 this time: no eggs, no salsa, extra hash browns, extra cheese. This time I was charged a side of hash browns with a side not saying ""split on burritos"" by a woman named Rosie, who I believe is the manager.. Okay, no problem I'll pay whatever as long I get what I ordered. We get our burritos and drive to work. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE EXTRA $$$ I WAS CHARGED. And by a manager, none the less. I'm not upset that I was charged extra, I'm upset that the manager felt so annoyed by my special order she felt the need to charge me an extra side of hash browns which I wasn't charged for just YESTERDAY and then didn't deliver quality food. My guess is the cooks didn't read her side note to split it on the burritos and sent an actual side of hashbrowns and then they didn't bag it and give it to me. As a manager, she should be on top of things. Especially if you're going to complicate things by charging side items to be added and then not ensure it is what was ordered.

This time I ordered the ""Bell Ringer"" which is a 1/2lb double cheeseburger with the usual toppings, some onion rings, and a drink.

I have to say the burger this time was very good. The meat had a much better flavor than I remember my last burger had, and the toppings were in better proportion as well. Plenty of onions and tomato this time. I decided to leave the bacon off this time. Not sure if they improved that as well, but the burger was very good without it.

As for the onion rings, they tasted good enough, but IMO they cut the onions way too wide. When you take a bite out of one a lot of the breading crumbles off because it doesn't stick to the onion very well. Also, even though you probably end up getting a fair amount of actual food by weight, an order of onion rings comes with only 4 rings. It feels like you're getting shorted.

Won't be eating here again when there are better options. Its overpriced, and not that good.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,3,2,moPQ9vbAg9CCDuqUamQLaQ

5808317,2015-02-24,1,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,Everything is made to order so it's about a 10 minute wait whether you go inside or through the drive-thru but totally worth it! Two thumbs up and can't wait to go back!,ZebxjffGSh9gSS4CLwzY7Q,1,1,5,IjpsA5cJbeaDGJ22fqZgsw

On my way to a friend's house one night I was craving their fried zucchini w/ranch. I stopped by and ordered a 4 piece, and boy oh boy these things were huge. They must have ordered the Monster Magnum zucchini's. These things were cut to the size of 10' inch bozacks! I really had to work them to fit in my mouth to take a bite. This was good however at the same time quite irritating. Especially eating in my car on the move. I am at the stop light and people are staring like what the hell is this woman putting in her mouth!!!!! It was crazy, like trying to shove an old school wood baseball bat in my darn mouth.

They were tasty as always, fresh and juicy fried to perfection exploding with hot juice every bite. Let them cool off a bit, they are so long and thick that it is extremely messy.

I have been a huge fan of Farmer Boy's for a couple of years now. They never disappoint and their customer service is Fantastic!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,2,0,5,y94E2lqsq0MiWsKjtdXm7A

5959596,2013-06-13,3,mswelTP1cQiuAps2fSGuBw,"Farmer Boys is a good alternative to the typical fast food in the area. I wanted a sandwich for lunch and although they are far from cheap, they have good quality food and it's as close as you can get home cooked food a a drive thru spot. 

This particular location was a little speedier than others I've been to. Big fan of that since I usually avoid other Farmer Boys locations for that reason. The service was pretty standard, nothing made it stand out more than other drive thru restaurants, but it was solid. 

I can't attest to the service when you dine inside, but I would probably stop here again if I'm in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,2,4,VebBV0bYSqtLsVDG316a6Q
