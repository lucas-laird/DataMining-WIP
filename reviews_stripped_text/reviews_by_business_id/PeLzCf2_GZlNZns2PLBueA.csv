I had ordered two lunch specials for me and a friend.  1st, friend ends up cancelling, then the food comes and it really tastes bad.  The portions are very small and the food came just soaked in extra, extra sauce.  So I asked to take the other lunch home and put it in a to go container.  Then a patron couple decided not to eat & grabbed my food and ran out the restaurant.
Oh shit right, no the store did not take it of my bill.  They proceeded to take my credit card and still charge me.   Bad food, bad area, and very bad service.",384cDTD7keZlYBq8KhP15A,5,0,1,It5eD2865n99htJmVTNnWg

I'd like to start off by mentioning that there is a $7 delivery fee- and it took them an hour to get here. I ordered fried rice, lo mein, chicken wings, and an eggroll. STARVING, I open my food and I'm beyond repulsed when i find a HAIR in my chicken wing! Gross. To make matters worse, the rice is hard and the lo mein is ridiculously bland. I look inside the bag for some duck sauce & soy to fix it, and can you believe they only send ONE pack of soy and no duck sauce???! The fried chicken was not your reg. Chicken wings u usually get it but was breaded and tasted equally as awful as everything else. Just when I thought they couldn't mess up anymore I look at eggroll and it's not a eggroll but spring rolls instead.  I called them and complained about everything and they simply said 'so sorry'. I'm absolutely disgusted with this place & just finished taking a nasty dump after I forced myself to eat it bc I was so hungry. AVOID at all costs! Sorry for the TMI but it was absolutely necessary.

I really wanted to like this place, it is small family owed and I love to support small businesses. My California roll was bland which I didn't even know was possible it's like the most easy to eat sushi ever because it has pretty much no taste, but this took it to another level. It was dry and just very disappointing. I also purchased their shrimp lover roll which is pictured on the menu under sushi and that was bland and not appetizing either. These 2 rolls cost a total of 15.05 and were a complete waste of money. One plus was that the rolls were a nice size about 8 large pieces but the fact that I only ate 2 pieces of each it didn't really matter much. So maybe it's my fault for ordering sushi from a Chinese food place but I give this place 2 stars and that's really pushing it.",Z0O9lJh3uS4_8HaHpZE8tA,0,0,2,4cjaTecBLoC52_UMb2D4MQ

As for the food, the reviewers weren't exaggerating. Very bland taste. 
The mapo tofu was bland. The fish with black bean sauce had a weird taste. The breading overpowered the fish twofold.

They were quick to re-make the order and send her on her way happy and satisfied.  Definitely awesome customer service.

Now to the food!  I ordered the fish with the black bean sauce and I wasn't let down.  My food came with lots of rice and some soup to boot (egg drop I believe it was?) and it quickly went down the hatch.  The only criticism that I have about 'Wok' is that it took awhile to get to my belly.  It looked like they were a bit understaffed and my wife and I had to wait awhile to get our orders.  I'm not the one to complain if my food takes a little while to make, but it seemed like they were working to the wire to get orders out by delivery and to us as well.

General Tao's Chicken - not too spicy, great flavor and just enough sauce.  Also came with a generous side of chicken fried rice that was delicious and not greasy at all!

Mushroom Beef- deeeelicious!  Lots of veggies but just as much beef!

Mongolian beef- a little spicy with a sweet side that compliments the beef perfectly!  Generous helpings of beef and veggies!

Combination lo mien- shrimp, beef, and chicken in a traditional lo mien sauce.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and everything was hot even after an hour of delivery time.

Appetizer combo- came with 2xfried shrimp, 2xwonton soups, 2xcheese wontons, and 2xspring rolls- everything was standard here.

I could tell by how the mother kept nervously telling her son to be nice and to leave my daughter alone. I thought it was cute, she's only two and the little boy is four. I enjoyed him keeping my daughter busy while we were waiting for the food. The food came out pretty quick and tasted good! The prices are great too. I will probably go back. :) defiantly a child friendly restaurant, which can be hard to come by on the eastside.",G69bboYuOJtlV_XFvxVfmQ,2,1,4,KcvcIBHXW9G6Ulu7BwGVVw

The food wasn't too bad although some of it can be done better but the delivery was sorta fast I suppose.. I really don't understand how the driver would not have any change at all though. But never the less their portions are good,ZtmGyiIF9N98YxXK-J2ZAA,0,0,4,AlrnN1DLSJ7wjsbfQMXjbA
