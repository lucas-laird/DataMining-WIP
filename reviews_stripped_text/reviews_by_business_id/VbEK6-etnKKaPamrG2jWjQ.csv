386146,2014-01-31,0,VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ,"Good, but not great. Overpriced for what it is. 

I ordered the Detroit Coney Dog (with Kobe hot dog) and the Polish sausage with peppers. The polish sausage was OK-you can find much better polish sausages at any grocery store. The Kobe dog was very good-juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the dog tasted like food-service quality buns, chili, and shredded cheddar cheese. Nothing special there. 

Overall it's a good place for lunch or if you've been drinking (it is located on the Vegas strip). A big critique is that two hot dogs and a drink costs about $20. Although it is located on the strip (tourist prices), you can certainly find much better places to eat for $20, even on the strip. 

My biggest critique is actually the menu. When you walk in the menu is located almost near the ceiling, so everyone is straining their neck to look at it. There's way too many types of hot dogs, each one  coming with a different type of meat for starters. There's Kobe dogs, grilled franks, polish sausage, steamed franks, etc. Then they all have catchy names, and the menu is divided into two sections of hot dogs. It's too much, too confusing. They should keep the menu simpler and make it easier to actually look at.  

Now that I've tried it I wouldn't go back unless I was walking the strip with friends in the evening and wanted a quick snack to go with my beers.",Td_ONQQFhfa2U0tmvzaRWA,0,0,3,NuagV9dlBQsja7vtCmh8GQ

789785,2014-05-08,1,VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ,"**Haute No More** HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

I'm rarely compelled to give a one star rating for various reasons, and unfortunately, this is one of those rare instances.

The one star is given to the tempura avocado on The Rising Sun and the port onion marmalade on the Billionaire Dog. The place is decently clean with an inviting decor. I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is where it all ends.

Our number was called roughly 20 minutes after we placed our orders, mind you that all we wanted were 2 dogs to fight off mid-afternoon cravings prior to our dinner reservation. As suggested by the time of the day, the place was not packed with people during normal dining hours, although there was a steady stream of foot traffic coming and going given that people tend to eat at any hour of the day in Vegas. 

I tend give new restaurants the benefit of the doubt because I understand that it takes time to grease the wheels back in the kitchen, and so I stayed optimistic. And perhaps, with wishful thinking on my part, that they were taking their time to make the dogs right. Unfortunately, one disappointment followed another from here on. 

Both franks were dry and bland. There's nothing special about the kobe frank that is to be desired over a regular dog. And based on the other comments, the regular dogs are not getting complimented much either. In the test kitchen, they may have tasted as good as they sound on the menu, but unfortunately, they were poorly executed here. There was no hint of truffle in the mayo, and so I asked for the Garlic aioli to bring it up just a notch.

Now, this is the part where the story could have taken a turn, but instead, it sealed its fate.

The lady behind the counter looked down at the receipt, then back up and said, ""It's 50 cents. You can pay it at the register up front."" Under normal circumstances, I would not have made a fuss had the menu (both in the store and the website as of the date this review is posted) not said that it was FREE!!! (You can verify this under photos that other customers have posted should they update the menu at a later time.) There were no fine prints indicated otherwise either. When I pointed out this fact, she repeated the answer using the I-can-care-less tone and gave me the you-are-wasting-my-time + leave-me-alone combo look. Strange, but true. No explanation. No apology. Just Attitude.

It also left me wondering how many customers have been falsely charged for the condiments without knowing. Just to be clear, I'm not appalled at the fact that they're charging for condiments, but I am annoyed at the attitude in which the manner was handled, and the deceptive business operation this little incident is projecting. I cannot believe that a place of their potential would risk of categorizing itself under *****FALSE ADVERTISING***** over chump change, inadequate customer service, and poor management!!!!

This is one of those rare instances where I would steer people away from a place even though I had a not-so-pleasant experience because I believe I visited a place on one of their ""off"" days. But after reviewing other comments (which is what I should have done before I got all excited about the mysterious power that Kobe and foie has over me), it seems to me that an abundance of ""cold"" disappointments are being served up at this supposedly ""hot"" joint.

All in all, there is definitely no shortage of competition in Vegas, especially when it comes to eateries. I am curious to see how long the little Doggery door can stay open with the high lease and the streak of low ratings. Any guesses?",2dLHGbCUPQ7gKW9TQ9D2_g,2,0,1,xaK5gieL93qH0zydWdwhRQ

For the price, which is $5-$10 for a hot dog (most are closer to $10), I would expect better.  The toppings and the hot dog itself were fairly good.  But then again, it shouldn't be too difficult to produce a decent hot dog.  What I found surprising and disappointing was no effort to heat up the bun.  It was served cold and right out of the package.  No steaming, grilling, or toasting of the bun.  So what you get is a cooked hot dog with hot toppings, and a room temperature bun.  Also tried onion rings and poutine fires.  The onion rings were good.  The batter was light and fried well.  Unfortunately, the poutine fries were terrible.  There was barely any gravy and cheese curds on the fries.  In fact, when I first looked at the fries, I thought they had given me regular fries in error.  There was not enough gravy to cover the fries and I had to dig to the bottom of the fries to find any cheese.  The ""cheese curds"" turned out to be a ping pong ball sized glob of completely melted cheese.  If you are looking for a place that services poutine, this is not it.  Their version is nothing like traditional poutine.  Additionally, the cashier who took our order had a scowl on her face and made us feel like we were bothering her.

I had the Tijuana Dog - bacon wrapped and deep fried frank, grilled onion and jalapeno with mayo - $7.30

The Good: 
When I saw  ""bacon wrapped frank"" my mouth began to water, how could I resist? I just hoped it was as good as it sounded, and it was. The flavor of the bacon combined with the dog, grilled onions, and jalapenos was very tasty. 

The Bad:
This is pretty minor and strictly cosmetic, but the dog didn't look all that appetizing when it came out. The bacon was nearly blackened around the edges and the dog had blistered up, I'm sure this was from the deep frier. I don't know if this could be avoided by shortening the cooking time by a few seconds or would it be just as good if it had been grilled? I don't know but this wouldn't stop me from ordering it again.

The Indifferent:
At first I was a little leery of the prices. 5.50 for a plain dog? That's a bit steep. But when I started looking at their more interesting offerings (like the Tijuana), I figured those prices were worth it for a unique hotdog experience I was unlikely to stumble across elsewhere. 
   It did take them a while to get our food but they were fairly busy and the wait wasn't annoyingly long.

My only regret is I didn't have time to come back and try a couple of their other offerings before I left town. There are at least four or five other dogs on their menu I'd like to try on future visits.",maeTOPoDpldg7ltkDmOVaA,2,0,4,VWt2JC_ObG1TxzVJAuWESQ

The space is a small storefront in the Linq promenade and has seating for probably 20-30 if you packed people in.  It's obviously an eat and run stop off.  The hot dog was normal sized (odd for Vegas) and I had a basic chili dog.  It was good. Not great.  For the price, I expected something a bit more.

They serve dogs, burgers, fries, onion rings and beer (plus sissy non-alcohol beverages).

I had the Empire State Dog and onion rings, which were okay.

I chased my dog with a Heineken Light, which is light enough to make your late night fuzzy brain think the water content of the beer actually has a hydrating quality to it.

Idea and concept is there but execution sucked! Presentation sucked! And service definitely sucked!

First the prices for hotdogs, burgers and fries were up the ass.. Second, upon ordering our burger we had requested for the meat to be cooked ""medium rare"".. The cashier and so-called cook said ""You know that's raw right?"" I said, ""What?!"" Excuse me last time I checked medium rare meant the meat cooked but has a touch of red in the middle, not raw.. PLEASE EDUCATE YOUR COOKS & STAFF!! Looked at us like we were stupid... Third, when we received our food presentation was crap! Wasn't at all pretty and looked pretty damn ordinary to me considering we got the most expensive hot dog & burger... 

Now the taste.. There was no quality in the food! Was not worth the monies we spent! Hot dogs could've more than likely come from your local Albertsons, the foie gras was bland, cheap bread, the ""Perfect Burger"" was so ordinary, my first poutine was yet my worst poutine..

Needless to say I didn't eat another for over a decade and we've had a tense relationship ever since.

Enter Haute Doggery- located in the LINQ, touting Kobe-beef dogs with gourmet toppings. I opted for the Fun-ghi Dog, menu description: a char-grilled frank with grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle mayo and shredded Gruyere cheese.

It arrived covered in cheese, which was fine with me since I love cheese. But I quickly discovered that the cheese was a blanket of deception, meant to hide the fact that my $9 hotdog had a scant four mushrooms on it and so few onions as to seem missing or forgotten.
Oh, and I highly doubt that these are made with Kobe anything- and even if they are, their cooking method renders the quality of product useless. Listed on menu as grilled, it tasted boiled and lightly seared (which explains how it was ready in 3 minutes) and had ZERO snap. And the bun was unremarkable other than it being broken in two pieces before it reached my mouth.

The service is alright. They're not super involved with your dining experience. The place is run like a fast food joint. Order in one line and pick up in another. It was just meh.

It consists of grilled Kobe beef frank, Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo. Individually, the ingredients didn't really do much for me. I didn't really taste the mayo, but maybe it was subdued due to the truffle mixture, the onion marmalade was good, though. I've never had Foie Gras, so I didn't know what to expect. This was heavy on Kalamata olive flavor. I'm not a fan of said olives so it was a bit alone. However, taking a bite with everything combined was magical.

Venue-wise, it's small inside but due to its location, that's understandable. You can eat in a booth, stand at a table, or sit at a counter. The dogs are made very quickly and the service is friendly. I'm definitely coming back.",y9vss4aVUULf6Zc86MCbvw,0,0,5,WJvSi3-SUVdqAq_iiNisOg

He has never been to The Linq yet so we decided to head over there to check it out. This is my 3rd time at The Linq since it's been opened. Quick update: still boring, still bland stores and still a wannabe LA kind of vibe. Ugh. STILL a no-go in my book.

Anyways, wanted a quick bite to eat...literally. We weren't too hungry and we didn't want a big ol' lunch like what The Yardhouse or Tilted Kilt would offer. Wandered to Haute Doggery. Took a quick look at the menu and said, sure...why the heck not!?

We ordered the Tijuana Dog, the Gold Standard, and Crinkle Cut French Fries. 

The Tijuana Dog DID NOT taste like the ones I've had in Downtown LA. So all you LA natives, you will be disappointed with this one. It was good...but not great. My boyfriend enjoyed his Gold Standard. Sadly, the crinkle cut fries was the star of everything. It came out pippin' hot and fresh. 

Also, I found it weird for them to NOT have soda fountain machine. They only serve their drinks in bottles. ie. a bottle of mountain dew was available for purchase. I just think maybe they're being cheap and don't want people to come back for refills 5+ times a day. Oh well...whatever floats their boat. We came, we tried, and most likely we won't be coming back again. The price for what we ordered was not worth it. Almost $10 for a hot dog?!? No. Just no.

Kobe Beef Dog, Port Wine Onion Jam, Truffle Mayo, topped with Foie Gras Torchon(cold) all sounds pretty bangin' right?

Well, sad to say that this wannabe Hot Doug's version sounded better than it tasted.
The dog itself was good, but if you're gonna advertise high end stuff like truffle and foie, don't skimp on these things! Couldn't even taste truffle in the mayo, and the foie was random broken pieces rather than nice medallions.

The interaction between the cashiers and cooks are just about non-existent too. Seems like they just go through the motions rather than engage a guest, offer suggestions and sell you product, know whattamean???

So early one Saturday evening we ventured down to the Linq. It is an unwritten rule for Vegas locals to stay away from the Strip on the weekend. 

What were we thinking? 

A few words on the Linq dining & shopping area itself:  
There is only one taxi drop off location and it's located under the new ferris wheel called the High Roller. You can also be dropped off at the Flamingo and schelp though the casino or at the IP oops wrong name - the Quad and schelp though. The Haute Doggery is on the strip side of the Linq so it's a schlep & with crowds, not that easy to navigate on a Saturday night - sober. 

The ""Doggery"" itself is bright and cheery. Extremely clean & well laid out. A variety of seating - and yes Fatastic seating. 

We ordered: 

Tijuana Dog - 4.95+ a perfect Kobe dog, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, garnished with a fantastic mix of jalapenos & onions and dressed with a light mayo. The only -1/2 point was for the ugliness of the actual dog after the deep fry. A victim of circumstance but close your eyes and take a bite..after that you won't care. 

Empire State Dog - 5+ - NOT a dirty water dog! - grilled to perfection and the red onion sauce we love. Just biting in made me homesick. 

Plain Jane - 5+ - we fixed ours up with extras like bacon and a slathering of garlic aioli. 

Order of crinkle cut fries 5+ delicious & brought back good memories of Saturday nights on the boardwalk at Coney Island. 

Some might think it's a tad expensive for a 'dog' but its KOBE dogs. not some generic out of the freezer case dog. 

The only down side was that it took quite a while for us to get our order and it came out piece by piece instead of all at once.  I can see this will be a problem once the High Roller opens and the crowds move in especially during huge events like the EDC & NFR.  Maybe by then they'll have their routine down and be faster at getting the orders out.

The inside is cool. It's a small space with tables and countertop seating. They have license plates that cover the ceiling. 

There was fine print of course. You had to buy a hot dog and you could get the shrimp cocktail for $1. 

We were pretty full and all their hot dogs sounded fancy and were loaded with toppings. It took us a few minutes before we decided on a plain hot dog with sauerkraut to share so I could get that shrimp cocktail. The lady at the register was patient and nice as she answered it questions. 

Well of all, even if it's a $1 or free even, it's not worth it. The shrimp cocktail is very small and on a bed of lettuce and cocktail sauce to fool you into thinking there's more. It's flavorless and watery.

However, the hot dog was amazing which ironically is not what brought me in. It's a ripper style hot dog meaning it was deep fried so it was crisp but juicy. This is the reason why I gave them 4 stars. I wanted to do a 1 for tricking people but then a 3.5 because the hot dog was great and the service was good.

Yes, the prices are steep. But it's on the Vegas strip and as far as I've experienced so far, EVERYTHING is overpriced around here. Even Starbucks seemed to have cost me more than normal. Having said that, the number one advice you should follow when it comes to trying Haute Doggery is DO NOT ORDER DRINKS HERE. Their drinks ARE ridiculously priced even for Vegas. They are very conveniently located right outside the Linq.

I have tried the Fun-ghi (mushrooms and Gruyere cheese) and Detroit Coney and loved them both. Fries were very crunchy and my son loved them. Very little sit down room but pretty clean place. More a place to eat and run rather than stay and hang out.

Advice to management: You may want to put a large sign outside listing your menu. You have a pretty complicated menu (with fancied up names and lists of ingredients) and during the two times I ate there, I saw A LOT of people come in, look at your hard to read overhead menu, and step back out. If you put a menu outside, at least they get to read about all the complicated menu items and decide if they do want to eat there or not.",ZvQStbXtZbIvajYZox_9Og,0,1,4,NR5jnD2hvUbRrwpb9jvkBw

Cute little hot dog and burger joint right next to the Linq hotel. The interior is fairly clean and bare, with some tables and stools. Has a diner/soda joint kind of interior decorating sense to it.

Prices seemed fairly reasonable for the strip, especially since it's a step above the usual fast food chains but you don't have to sit down. Staff is very friendly but service is slowwwwwww.

The pricing doesn't really make sense for the burgers - they're all about the same price (~$11) even though they come with vastly different amounts of stuff on them. 

I got the southern smokehouse burger which comes with double meat - beef brisket and a fat, flavorless and rather soggy patty. Despite having SO much stuff on it (BBQ sauce, hot sauce, cheese) it still managed to be rather flavorless. The portion was huge but with how underwhelming it was, definitely felt a little much.

4958526,2018-04-09,2,VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ,"Haute Doggery is good, but even considering its location on the Strip I found it to be overpriced.  I had lunch at Haute Doggery on a Friday about 1:30.  It is a small joint inside, I would guess it seats about 30 at the max.  There is additional seating outside, and you can just get your food and eat somewhere in the Linq Promenade as well.

I went with the All American Dog and poutine on the side.  I had water to drink, and was told they have no free water options.  So, I bought a 16 ounce bottle of water for $3.  This is absurd given that Haute Doggery is located in the middle of a desert yet has no free water options.  I would rather they charge more for the food (which was not cheap either considering what you get) and give water cups to customers.  They have no fountain, but there certainly would be a way to make this possible.  Otherwise, continue gouging customers for water at over 300% markup.  I suppose I bought the water rather than going elsewhere, so Haute Doggery wins.

The dog comes with pulled pork, coleslaw, bbq sauce, & a few fried onions.  The onions were the best thing about the dog, they were crispy and fried perfectly.  No oil at all.  They were also flavorful, I should have ordered these as a side.  The dog is super messy (as most on the menu are when you put this many ingredients on a hot dog) but it was good.  Not close to the best ""fancy"" hot dog I have eaten, but it certainly wasn't bad.  

The poutine was the weak link in the meal.  The crinkle cut fries are fine, but needed salt and pepper.  The gravy was a little thinner than I prefer, and the cheese curds were not distributed well.  About 1/3 didn't have curds at all, and in one part the cheese melted into a glob that I had to pull apart to eat.  I did not finish the poutine, buyer's remorse over the fried onions.

The lunch was nearly $20.  I realize we are a captive audience on the strip and I am sure Haute Doggery's rent is insanely high.  But, the meal delivered was not good enough to justify the price.

5042315,2014-04-27,1,VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ,"Last night, my friends and I had the amazing opportunity to see O.A.R. and Gogol Bordello for free! O.A.R. started the evening off right! Such a great show and full of energy, energy that built up my appetite. Between shows, my friends and I decided to walk the Linq and check out Haute Doggery for bite to eat. 

First off, when you hear the name Haute Doggery, you think gourmet. You think, wow, that's a cool spin to a hot dog. That's what originally caught our curiosity. Hot dogs are an American classic. When there's a spin like that, you can't help but walk in and try them out! Walking into the place, you notice the bright accents around the room. White table tops, wooden trimmings and bright red chairs. The focal point to the place is the hot dog artwork to the back of the room. I thought at first sight, this place looked awesome! Then it was time to order.

THE BIGGEST, and I mean the biggest turn off for me are non engaged employees. When I walked up to the counter, the lady taking our order was texting on her cell phone! Clear as day, it looked like she was hiding from her coworkers, but didn't care about doing that in front of her customers. I took a picture and posted it onto the business page for proof. If you zoom into the picture, she wasn't texting anything professional. The conversation via text was about some drama. WHAT. A. TURN. OFF. That should NEVER happen. Unacceptable. She let me stand there for a good 30 seconds before saying something. When she did, she said, ""Don't worry, I can hear you. Go ahead and order,"" WHILE SHE CONTINUED TO TEXT. Ugh, I'm sorry for the rant, I just felt cheap and unimportant at that moment. Not good for this business. That may be the reason why they just opened in the Linq and so far have an overall Yelp score of 2.5 stars. 

Aside from that, here's what I got for my meal:

-Crinkle Cut French Fries for $3.99: the big disappointment with these fries that they weren't fresh cut fries. If the business is going to advertise themselves as a step up from the normal hot dog joint, well then I would expect them to have stellar, fresh cut ingredients. 

-Tijuana Dog for $7.29: When I did get the opportunity to talk with the hostess, I asked her between this dog and the Gold Standard dog (advertised on their business page on TheLinq.com. She told me hands down, this dog. This dog was bacon wrapped and deep fried, topped with grilled onions, jalapeno and mayo. The jalapenos weren't overly hot and coupled with the onions, it brought a nice crunchy texture. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is eating a hot dog with mayo. This was no different and super delicious! Although the hot dog was bacon wrapped, which I LOVED, the dog was super small. It had a nice snap to it, but unfortunately for me, it got lost in the mix of ingredients and wasn't the true star of the show. 

The word Haute means, ""fashionably elegant or high-class,"" depicted by Websters. This place was inspired by the famous Holstein's menu and to me, a huge disappointment. I appreciate their overall take on the American classic. I really wished the experience was much better than what I saw, heard and tasted that day. For the strip, I would say the price is on point, however, not worth the return visit in my opinion.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,2,1t3V0MV7hTf0jtfhb54P_w

It is not a great idea to eat something salty and fatty before fitting into out tight clothes, but we really wanted something cheap. Us 6 shared a hotdog, onion rings, and regular fries. The total was about $20? The hotdogs that we got was the Billionaire Dogs, which cost $10.99. It is a grilled Kobe beef frank, with Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo. The hotdog was pretty good. The Foie Gras torchon aka liver, was kinda gross because I expected them to slice the liver thinly or even grind it into a pate style. Instead, they just put two blocks of yellow-color liver on top of the hot dog. The onion was really well marinated to the point it got sorta over powering. The truffle mayo looked gross to me, but my friends loved it. I only liked the Kobe beef and the buns haha. The beer battered onion rings were pretty darn good. It wasn't oily as I thought and the onion rings were perfect bite size. The fries were crunchy and not overly salted. Overall, it's a good place to come by if you don't want to spend too much at Pink's Hotdog. (Price is around the same but probably $1-2 cheaper).

Given that the name of the place has the word ""haute,"" I was expecting some really good gourmet hotdogs. I don't think that's the case here.

The interior is pretty small with limited seating inside and two small tables outside the doors. It was nicely decorated with anime-like drawings on one of the walls and an American flag made out of license plates on the ceiling (yeah patriotism!).

The employees weren't really that welcoming, but at least they (kinda) warmed up to us when we ordered. 

Anyway, the hotdogs were just eh. My friend and I got the Gold Standard hotdog and used the check-in offer to get a free Polish hotdog to save for later. 

The Gold Standard was apparently a char-grilled hotdog with bacon, cheese, tomatoes, arugula, and a garlic aioli. The Polish was just your standard hotdog, nothing too special. At first glance, the hotdogs looked like fake food. I mean it was glossy and when you bit into it, the hotdog had a weird texture. The arugula was fresh, but it didn't go well with the other things on this hotdog. The tomatoes were fresh as well and super juicy, but I didn't like how it made the hotdog bun soggy... I didn't taste the garlic aioli in there, so it basically tasted just like a regular hotdog... with cheese. 

Haute Doggery didn't really knock my socks off, and I don't think it was worth the price. I know things on the strip are a bit more expensive than places off the strip, but with subpar ""gourmet"" hotdogs you should really save your money for something else.

It was nice, clean, and organized when we went. Food was presentable, hot and juicy! I wouldn't recommend the dollar shrimp cocktail - tiny shrimps and not fresh. I mean it was only a dollar so what could you ask for. But I still wouldn't chance it for stomach ache..

The bun was soft, the hot dog cooked well, and the toppings were decent; nothing to hoot and holler about. The fries we got seemed to have either been sitting for a while under a heat lamp or were overcooked or both.

I took a couple of my friends down here for a late night dinner/snack and found the Poutine to be bangin as hell...we weren't that drunk yet btw.

While they were good, they definitely weren't the best hot dogs I've ever had. The actual hot dogs themselves were a little too salty for me. The chili was good, but nothing spectacular. The sauerkraut also didn't taste homemade, so again just a run of the mill hot dog.

Usually I go all out fatty in Vegas, but summer is coming, and I've been trying to be a little better in portion control, eating well, and working out.  So while in Sin City, and since I wasn't able to do my usual all you can eat buffet, I decided just to just get a quick bite to eat before hitting up the club... Haute Doggery was the nearest, most convenient, shortest wait option.  

Afterall, you can't go wrong with a hot dog right?  (wrong...) lol... I should have stayed with a usual regular hot dog, but noooo.... The menu had to throw in keywords like ""Kobe Beef"", ""Foi Gras"", ""Billionaire Hotdog""... The marketing totally got me and at the end of the order make you not mind paying over $10/hotdog for those crafty keywords... Oh and since I didn't have that great of cellphone reception, I was unable to check in and get the yelp discount; make sure you do that if you eat here.

As I waited, I admired American Flag ceiling made out of license plates...

My order came out and presentation was a disappointment.   I brought my order to go and walked it upstairs to my room.  As I was in the elevator, everyone made conversation about the hotdogs I was holding.  Two black men remarked ""WTF is that, livers n sh***"".  I was a bit embarrassed about my order as they snarled at me for being asian, filling in the stereotype of eating weird things.  The ultimate taste of this hotdog was bland, almost a gross texture, and nowhere near tasting like a billion dollars.  The Billionaire dog looked like it had two hard boiled eggs on top (cold foie gras).  What a waste of foie gras.  I don't think I'll ever eat foie gras again after they butchered it; cold, hard and disgusting, leaving me with a bad taste and memory... When I finally ate it, it had a thick sweet sauce which I was not a fan of.  It was plain gross, imo.

The Rising Sun dog, which I ordered second, looked like it had a fried jalapeno which ended up to be a fried avocado (I know weird).  It was much better than the Billionaire dog, but nothing to rave about.  All I liked about it was the spiciness to remove the taste of the Billionaire dog.  I don't know why they call it a ""Kobe Beef"" dog.  It tastes like a regular hotdog.  Meh.... Marketing...

The two expensive dogs on the menu were terrible.  I wish I had ordered something else, something normal.  Better luck next time Vegas.",p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ,4,2,2,mqKyJKX0VaelNeYouV0TNQ
