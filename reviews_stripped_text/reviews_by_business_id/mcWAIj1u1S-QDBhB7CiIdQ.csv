She came back with my drink and no change.   I put the diet Coke on the table I was sitting at.   I went back to the bar to see if I can get my change.   After another 5 minutes of waiting,  the dopey female bartender came back,  asking me what I wanted.   I asked for my change.

All the bartenders I have come into contact with. James, Tiffany, the cute couple who bartends together, and Arty are friendly and fun. Arty though tends to cut people off from playing music, instead he plugs in his ipod. That can be disappointing sometimes because my friends and I love playing music while at bars. 

The BEST thing about this place besides the people and atmosphere, is definitely the food. The pizza is to die for, garlic fries, wings, etc. I have not tried everything, but I am in there enough to probably get through it eventually.

(probably not a good idea)  A few people took some minor shots or insults but you expect that going into a different team bar.  

The bartender Jennifer was super cute and nice.  She was great service person, fast and friendly and quick wit and humor.  I think a great compliment to a local bar.  

The drink prices were good and drinks were not watered down.  This is a good place to hang for good prices and decent bar food.  

I did have one issue.... I was given a warning for offending other patrons.  Neither I nor my party of 7 understood what this was about.  The best we could come up with is I was wearing Dolphins gear and cheering good plays  (for Buffalo at that)  

I think this is a good place if you are a sheep who wears the same flock of jerseys of the Bills...I do not think they welcome anyone else much less if their team is losing.  (Coming from a Miami person who's team has not done much better so no digs there)

I assumed the only wine I would get is the ""house red"" or ""house white"", so I ordered a lite beer immediately ( I am low carb, and haven't had a beer since 2007).  After I order, I was impressed by the wine selection there were actually choices, and reasonably priced too!

Reminiscent of the divey bars I went to in grad school in the NJ/NYC area. We were sitting at a long table with benches. However, refreshingly, our waiter was really cool...checked on us enough but definitely didn't hound us to order drinks or food.  I was truly impressed, especially when a drunk stranger sat incredibly close to one of our friends...he calmly said to guy, ""Hey buddy, your seat is over here."" and then the he led the buzzed stranger to a seat near the bar. Very cool, very well played. 

Pizza tastes very homemade, I don't mean that in necessarily in a  good way, but it really wasn't that bad either. Just like that pre-made unroll and bake dough you get in the grocery store (BTW, I despise square pizza) and topped with premade sauce you get in the grocery store with processed semi-fake pepperoni & sausage (added soy filler), and cheese that is probably the generic big bulk block o'cheese from Costco or something.  The last time I ordered the ""Naked City"" pizza  was ""To-go"" and it did not taste good at all. This time it was perceived as solid ""bar"" food, and the meat didn't taste sooo mysterious.  Maybe it was because I was very hungry...remember I ordered my first beer in 6 years...so I guess this is the beer munchies?  Bear in mind, I did not eat the crust, which is a huge component in judging pizza. 

While the pizza doesn't necessarily bring me back to this place, a good cold beer with great service does. I'll be back!",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,1,1,4,X-IGc00puNcRfQ0u1Af0tw

2313045,2012-12-12,2,mcWAIj1u1S-QDBhB7CiIdQ,"Our eyes couldn't focus quick enough, coming in from the bright Las Vegas sun, into this extremely dark and cool (as in vibe and temp) dive bar off the beaten path, miles off the strip.

38 Special's ""Hold on Loosely"" was  jamming from the jukebox, locals were seated at the bar and our eyes focused just enough to see the ""Please Seat Yourself"" sign. We carefully made our way past the 70's-style booths and found a cozy two top.

Before we could sit, a voice echoed from the darkness, I'll be right there. That gave us time to awkwardly gawk and gaze around like the tourist we were. This could be a seedy local refuge for undesirables or one of the best kept secrets in Vegas. We soon found it to be the later.

Our server Nicole came over, bubbly as gas in a hot tub, decorated with a bright smile and oozing with local charm. We felt welcomed, comfortable and wanted to know more. She dropped off two glasses and a bottle of water, no...not Fiji, or Evan...a bottle...with a cork...that had water in it. The bottle may have come from Al Capone's vault. Classic. (and no tad poles).

She gave us the back story of the joint, ex MGM chef from Buffalo cranking out authentic buffalo-style and east coast cuisine with some of the smartest pizza combinations on the planet. Of course we were there for one thing...the Suicide Fries.

Her face lit up, ""I love those, we now bottle the Suicide Sauce.""  She explained the complex mixture of hot, hotter and hottest all brought together over a plate of fries. We were sold. She also suggested a great local brown ale (maybe from Sin City Brewery, but wasn't sure). The beer and the spicy fries were just what we needed. We were in heaven. The plate had spice, but more importantly, flavor. 

Every bite made you want to have another. I worked up quite a sweat and was thankful for the cutlery...you don't want these spices resonating and breeding on your phalanges all day, then touching an unsuspected body part later...

We will definitely be back to try some of the other great sounding items on the menu, enjoy the friendly service and just to see if we can recognize any of America's Most Wanted sitting at the bar.",Sy6Uwey7gRoH2jaNUzyT4w,2,1,4,4V_xeAn99uxxVgyc4p1WqQ

Another great feature about this bar is the beer selection.  Tons of great craft and micro brews are to be had as well as your standard  big three choices.

The pizza that Naked City Pizza serves up through a window in the bar is spectacular. Seriously, check it out. Several customers came in just to pick up large to go orders of pizza. 

I'm a big fan of dive bars. I have lived in Las Vegas for 15 plus years and have tried and frequented many. The reason for my 2 star review is strictly due to the bartender that was working. I don't know her name - black hair, pretty, tattoo sleeves, pierced face. Rude as hell to my brother. He went to the bar to order beers. She had her back turned and he said ""yo"". She proceeded to blast him in front of the whole bar from that point on even after he apologized for offending her for saying yo as his greeting. She said ""where is it ok to speak to people like that?"" I could hear the conversation as I sat in awe waiting for our drinks and food. Total over reaction. This is a guy that's never met a stranger and everyone likes. He tried to apologize and she still wasn't having it. 

We would have stayed and spent more money but she was unwelcoming. I'm sure she has a following but it's not going to be me or my friends that frequent places like this. 

That's my rant. Still a fan of the dive bar and local treasures. Won't be coming back here though unless it's to grab a pizza and carry it home. And, by he way....many people say yo and it's not taken offensively. I mean come on, Breaking Bad popularized the Yo. Yo bitch...",aFSO1FBT-zpoo-4Q0A7c0g,5,2,2,8GnMoMvnQ32uLbAWljQwbA

The glorious absence of sophistication has Buffalo written all over this place.  Blinded by the darkness as we walked in....it took my breath away.  This is every little corner  bar in Buffalo that is known for cold beer and good wings.

I mean Damn this place is special.  Buffalo style pizza tastes like it's from Abbot Pizza...you know, the place on Abbott Road in South Buffalo.

Look, I've travelled the world and Buffalo Wings are a staple of my diet.  It's difficult to find a place outside of western NY with good wings, but Moon Doogies nails it!

The Bills decor reminds me of what I would find in my broke ass friends basement, but it is perfect.   Tiffany the bartender is very Western NY friendly even though she's not from Western NY.

Let me start off by saying that I'd never had a problem prior to my very last night there. During my stay in Vegas, I found myself frequenting MD at least three times a week. The bartenders and I had shared some laughs and drinks and I pretty much thought (incorrectly, mind you) that they had my back...

Enter douchebag bro and bimbo girlfriend who decide to start having a hootin' and hollerin' contest inches away from me. After looking around and finding the place to be too packed to move anywhere else, I turned around and POLITELY asked them to not shout in my ear...and that's when the real ""fun"" began - everyone knows douchebags will do the exact opposite of what you tell them (especially if you say it nicely) because they believe it magically makes their dick bigger. So they start purposely shouting in my ear to the point where I get mad and turn around to tell them to ""STFU!"" That's when the insults start flying in: everything from ""fat bitch"" and more. After complaining to the bartenders (the same ones I'd shared laughs and drinks with), I was told in so many words that they were buying too many drinks to get kicked out and, if I didn't want to be bullied by douchebag bros and their bimbo girlfriends, then I needed to not come to a dive bar and, what's more, I needed to leave...Okay...cool...I get the feeling that if I'd been one of the regular skinny, blonde bitches that frequent your bar, then maybe, just maybe, I would have gotten a little help.

So what is a girl like me to do? I'll tell you what I did: quietly excused myself from the bar, walked to my car and cancelled the debit card I'd been using to keep an open tab, then drove away and never went back.

My boyfriend wanted to try Naked City Pizza that is located in here. It's not my 1st time here so I knew what I was in for, a dive bar with good food. 
The first time I came here was a few years ago. Back then there was a waitress that would take your order and bring your food. Now you seat yourself and when you're ready to order, proceed to the window under the giant ""order here"" sign. Then head over to the bar to put in a drink order. Unless you want water. Then there is a self service water dispenser with plastic cups. 
They have six tables, two booths and one long picnic table. Sitting at anyone of these tables has a great view of the horrible restroom set up. Can't tell you how many men pissing in a urinal I got to see during dinner. It's a 1-2 person bathroom for both the men and women side. 
The music is eclectic, ranging from The Rocky Horror Pictures Show soundtrack to Metallica, classic rock, grunge and even some I'm a Barbie girl! 
The air is smoky but this asthmatic will suffer through it for some Naked City Pizza! 
We started off with the suicide fries. They were crunchy and loaded with spice! That sauce has some serious kick. Enough to get your nose running so be sure to have a cold beer to tame the heat. Jalapeños and habanero slices were garnished on top with their spicy suicide sauce. Ordered the garlic rolls for the first time. Those could have been a meal in itself. I was expecting little garlic knot type dough balls. Nope, these cheese filled garlic loaded bad boys were the size of a Cinnabon! It was served with marinara in the middle of the plate. Although the sauce was flavorful, it was served cold. That was an odd contrast from our piping hot fresh food. 
The chicken wings were fried up perfectly and evenly tossed in a medium sauce...we needed a break from that suicide sauce. It was accompanied by carrot and celery sticks, French fries and their awesome homemade ranch for dipping. 
And now for the pizza. We got a half sheet of the Back Home pizza. I normally don't eat the crust on my pizza. It's boring and I'd rather move on to something covered in sauce and cheese....I ate all of my crust. It was delicious and the pizza was great.",FANt14cGQpOJskxQUQBK1g,2,1,2,cFf6VM2UxvgBBKoGtk3CZw

The drinks are poured strong, and their beer selection is OK. 

The biggest draw is a toss up between the amazing food at Naked City Pizza (inside the bar as well), and the amazing Bartenders. Always friendly, all of them cool, willing to bullshit with you about ANYTHING. Just great people.

We wanted to leave but since they had my credit card for the tab we were stuck until Jenny noticed us.  My girlfriend waived held her arm out several times to wave Jenny down but she literally ignored us.  I finally had to yell out can I get our check before Jenny finally noticed us.  Jenny then went on and on about how her dad passed away and she was talking with her friends she hasn't seen and etc.  I told her as apologetic I am about your fathers passing I don't know what that has to do with her serving everyone else and flat out ignoring us to which she tried saying she did Ng see us which was impossible unless she is blind.  I asked her to tell me if she served one drink since we been here for two hours eating and drinking in which she just gave me a blank stare and finally said just don't come back and she was the bar manager.

What does not work in it's favor is the dark, smoky, and uncleanly aspects of this joint. I have been to the bathroom on a couple of occasions to find that they have ran out of soap. 

Besides eating and drinking, Moon Doggies is not the first place I think of when it is time to find a chill bar to hang out with friends. Even though they have a pool table, golden tee, a shooting game, and a punching machine, none of my friends have ever suggested to play. Usually we are competitive and search for activities to one up each other, but not here. Maybe we are too busy stuffing our face. With the blaring sound system it can be difficult to do anything else. Sometimes it gets to the point where the bartender has apologized for the loudness. 

The music is completely in the hands of the crowd. This can be a good or bad thing. You will not be listening to the likes of Britney Spears here.

First trip - Went for the pizza because my sister absolutely loves it there. I was a little disappointed in the pizza, not because it was bad, but because my sister had built it up as being the best pizza ever. It was good though, but certainly not great. I don't think I would ever go there just for the pizza, but it does have a lot of other stuff going for it. We also had wings, again, good, but not great, and beer, always great!

Second trip - I went to watch football on Sunday morning. While this is a Buffalo Bills bar, the Bills had played on Thursday that week, so it was more of a free for all. The crowd was very fun and friendly, the bartender, who was the same bartender as my first trip, remembered me and my beer of choice (pretty good for only my second trip) and was very friendly and helpful. This time around I got the Royal sandwich that is advertised on the menu as being the best sandwich in Las Vegas. Not being a Vegas resident I can't say if it is the best sandwich in Vegas, but it is definitely the best sandwich I have had in Vegas. Big thumbs up for the Royal!

So good beer, NFL Sunday ticket for football, good (but not great) pizza, exceptional service and one awesome sandwich. That all makes for a winning combination.

On a dive bar tour with about 30 of my co-workers I demanded the bus stop here first.

But, I guess most would think that cheese curd gravy over fries doesn't sound that appatizing but sure enough, it was a hit! A few of them have even gone back to sample some of the other fine Buffalo area dishes.

1- it's got Naked City Pizza inside!  This pizza is bonkers.  I live in Oakland California and we cannot get pizza this good here.  I come to Vegas twice a year and I always get Naked city!!

2- it's a Bill's bar!   Yes, all the games!  It gets crowded and insane.  

3- PBR in big ass glasses.  Most places have cans or bottles and draft but not big assed glasses.  I'd give them a sixth star on this review if they served Genesee.  

4- responsible prices on shots.  Local pricing is appreciated.  

5- it's a locals type place off the strip which is a great thing.  Getting there is stupid easy with uber and lyft.  

6- the staff is amazingly nice!  Rare for most dive bars where staff can look bored.  Pleasant demeanor and friendly. 

7- the freaking PIZZA world class pizza!  I cannot overstate how great this pizza is. B

8- it's easy to get to and uber/lyft make it easy to get home from.  

9- the bartenders are on it.  They aren't pretentious jackasses.  They work and they are welcoming.  I came in at 2am in a tuxedo and was greeted as if that was the most normal thing.  That's appreciated.  

There is plenty of seating inside for most nights except Bills game day.  So if it's game day get there early as hell.  

Thanks for the good times.  See you again soon!",4IzHh2Cfoddv3ZXZqqtZzA,3,1,5,snPdLvohclFbnpZ-GybZyA

And in fact, I quite enjoyed myself at Moon Doggies.  There seemed to be a good amount of seating and I quite liked the chair I was in.  There's an eclectic but not in a cool way vibe that I truly appreciate going on.  I don't think that it looks truly run-down and dive bar but I can see how it could get there in the near future.  

The drinks were strong and cheap and you can get pizza.

The place looks a little rough and is on the middle of a used car lot. We almost passed, which would have been sad if we did. Our thought that if there was an issue, they wouldn't have their.4.5 star Yelp rating.

BTW, this was a stop on Guys triple D show.

So Moon Doggies turned out to be that perfect divey bar that is great for a Sunday afternoon beer.

Naked City Pizza had one of the best homemade pizza's I've had in a long time.

Couple that with outstanding service and servers, you win every time!!

The Bartenders were really friendly, the drinks were full sized, and half of the TV's were on ESPN and the other half on Cartoon Network - perfect! Then, we ordered a Wee Guinea's Pie- Fantastic! You could tell that the meatballs were made in house and the crust and white garlic sauce were fantastic. Highly recommend :)",QFaj6o7zJDN_6fpx-sduQw,0,0,5,hzFt0026v8bE6ZueCGlCCw
