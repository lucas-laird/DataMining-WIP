I pay I get me order no hash rounds.  He said I didn't order but will give then anyway.  I drive off.  Have to go back because the croissant itself is cold like out if the frig cold. I drive back and tell them.  The guy his back and pulls and box of bacon.  Says... ""Not to be funny but this was just cooked""  I said in an not taking about the ingredients inside. I am talking about the croissant itself it's ice cold! I don't think it's supposed to be served cold. I told him he could keep the damn sandwich and I would be contacting the corporate offices, but there is no number. Maybe I will get lucky and they will read this review!! Will never go back to that one!!!!",VcGlNE0h0cHSW8pPDyd7ag,0,0,1,JR-j51i5X2IJjuWhbicQDw

Looked like she was high or hasn't slept in days. I should of driven away at this point. The food was cold and iced coffee was way too sweet. Food went to the trash.",c4nYAUAc8N058A28cHNoMA,0,0,1,1qqtMSm5oI5nGViRdsN0tA

Location is a tad shady though, not overly bad but around the corner is a strip mall that looks sketchy.

What cost them a star is they were out of cookies....  Other than that it was a typical Burger king dining experience in all it's glory.",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,4,0Pq2HbqIyzt3lLdH6Bn7-g
