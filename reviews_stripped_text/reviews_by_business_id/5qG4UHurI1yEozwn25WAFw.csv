Let me just explain the process...you check in, fill out a waiver (don't freak out), then you put your items in a free locker. At that time, go to the bathroom before hand, then go back to the counter to get seated. You meet your server, they ask for any food allergies, hold each others shoulder then walk to your seat. The server helps you sit down, shows you with your hands where everything is on the table, and takes your drink order. They bring you all the courses, they cannot explain what you are eating until the end out of respect for the others eating. When you are done, they stand you up, hold each others shoulders then take you out to the room. I recommend bringing sunglasses to protect your eyes. Go get your locker stuff and check out. At that time, you can see what you were eating.

You have to come with an open mind, but omg it is so much fun!

Coming back soon!",5dDWSKfqEhLYB3BtulflrQ,6,2,5,knjFhvFbVH53yVQ2WTOETQ

We had a 4 course lunch meal. You only get to choose your drinks and the type of food flavor (spicy/savory/sweet). What a great experience. I will definitely come back again. Super friendly staff.

217549,2017-12-22,13,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star, and to start this review off I just want to say I haven't been on my yelp in a long time so I finally signed back in to write this review to hopefully ""be heard"" by someone at this establishment because my experience is one for all to be heard due to getting hit with a plate to my nose during my dining. I am not one to write bad reviews in which the day after this issue had happened I immediately wrote a long email to the business and had no response. Enjoy!....
This place was of interest to my brother and the reasoning we went there is because it was both mine and my brothers birthday and we wanted to try something different. We arrived at the restaurant around 8pm on September 30th the night of my birthday and it was myself, my brother and my fiance. Fully excited we were greeted by an individual who was our server and he had just started a couple weeks prior at this place. We entered the restaurant and believe it or not it was an amazing experience to begin with. We started to enjoy our meals and drinks and everything was good up until I was adjusting my chair a little forward (keep in mind he can see us with the night vision goggles he was wearing and we couldn't see anything through the whole meal) I got hit with a plate to the top of my nose! From that point on I was in pain but I didn't want to ruin everyone night so with my hand over my nose I sat there for about 15 minutes while a migraine headache started pulsing. My experience went from great to crappy in that instance because not only did I get hit with a plate, but through the whole time I was at this establishment NO MANAGER came to see if I was ok! This is not what you expect to happen on your birthday. The server then asked if I was ok and offered to comp me a drink for what had happened. With my mouth held shut because I was so upset that through all of this time a manager had not approached the table I told him that it was fine to bring me a drink but not a martini because he had offered that. ""He brings me a martini"".....I then was fed up with my whole experience that I just asked for the bill. Like really? I literally sat there while all the meals came out and still no manager. We had a show to attend so I figured I would reach out to the restaurant the day after so that I did not miss our show. I walked out to the hostess stand to pay the bill eager to leave this place, and I began to explain what happened hoping someone would get a manager involved but still again no manager around, and to top that off the hostess said it was my fault that I moved my chair and got hit with the plate! At this point, on a $200+ bill I tipped way under 20% and walked out. The next day I woke up with a bump/bruise on my nose, and it was October 1st the day my parents were throwing a birthday party for me and my brother. I wrote a email and waited for a response back.....a couple days went by, nothing from them. As I said in the beginning of my review, I am not one to write a bad review because I feel good customer service and addressing the situation no matter what, will always keep a customer happy no matter the situation to keep the good reviews coming, but not with this place. I then decided before writing a bad review that I would dispute this whole transaction through my credit card company. I also made an attempt a  to contact the restaurant and ask for a manager to speak my mind out since my email I wrote and my credit card company was not giving me any response from the restaurant. I spoke with the manager there ""Theresa"" twice; the first attempt she listened to what I had to say and apologized but did not do anything as a manager to make sure I was happy. Instead she took my number down and said either her or the owner would call me. A month goes by and the dispute I did with the credit card company comes back not in my favor because the restaurant communicated with my credit card company and proved I ate there and provided them with a receipt. I then re-opened my dispute and fought it again providing the credit card company with the emails I sent to Blackout and explained to them I was not being heard by anyone and that was the most frustrating part. I have the money to pay for my bill, but my experience was unacceptable and with a bad experience the customer needs to be heard!  A couple more weeks went by and I was having no luck still and no-one still had reached out to me. I reached back out to the restaurant and spoke to the ""manager"" Theresa again, and she said there was nothing she could do she had given my information to the owners and that is all she can do! I asked her ""so you being a manager can do nothing to make sure I am happy?"" she responded it is not a decision or credit she is authorized to make.

Overall, I didn't want to write this review but I felt the need to be heard by others since this place couldn't reach out to me and make things better to save a customer.",aJavb4oSy0ztP3x5wI-idg,7,2,1,lPA4D4t_kcoVK6d7PCKq3g

What they don't tell you though- is that most the courses are very very small and it's all vegan. Yes you right that right - 100% vegan. Why they are not totally up front about this I don't know ... probably because they figure it would put people off.

For that price you could go to a lot of restaurants in the strip and get an excellent two course meal and just eat it with your eyes closed to get the same effect as this place! 
Also I feel sorry for meat eaters because they only tell you it's vegan afterwards - why not just be upfront about it and say it's a vegan restaurant from the start? Is it because you know nobody would then pay 65 bucks for a vegan meal ?",dwy2OI1FNjQ_tZw8upWpmg,3,1,1,lJEV-SkX_e9fK-AxmgVhog

This is an experience so don't go if short on time, we were there for about an hour and 45 min.

I knew it was vegan going in and wasn't concerned, but this was just... gross. If you like stereotypical vegan food and a lot of bitter tastes, this is the place for you.

1122526,2017-10-02,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"The experience itself was pretty great for our group.  The lobby and restrooms were clean and inviting, along with the thoughtful lockers to store your belongings.

The service was great is so far as attitude, explanations, and friendliness from the staff.  However, each course was served much too slowly and we had to ASK for the next course repeatedly.  This is not acceptable in multi-course dining.  A guest should also never have to wait for drink re-fills.  This is Restaurant 101.

The environment is loud (which is fine) and if somebody starts a silly song or chant (i.e. Marco / Polo), everybody loudly participates for some good fun.  It's a safe environment and the waiters are very attentive to guests in the dark environment.

The food was average, at best, much like the other diners mention.  The experience is what you are paying for, definitely not quality food.  The dishes weren't bland or bad by any means, but none were ""excellent.""

As it stands, the place is surely over-priced (almost $70 per guest) since the food quality and speed of service were quite subpar.  

They need to work on speed of service and food quality and they could easily be 4 or 5 stars and justify the high price-tag.

P.S.  It was also disappointing to have a group behind us using the flashlight on their phone which kind of destroyed the experience for us.  That group should have been immediately ejected.",iSCvaQ4hfEGiZ_KFGJ2w3A,5,1,3,prLHMuuz6-5V0jQk7M4b6w
1206754,2018-02-16,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"Wow what an experience!  Blackout offers its' patrons a unique and fun experience, totally out of the norm.  As the name states, you dine in the dark...literally.  All you see is pitch black all around.  No clue what is around you.  The restaurant could be in a run down warehouse and you wouldn't know.  Definitely a memorable experience for the husband and I.  

Although you cannot see the area that you are actually dining in, the area you can see, the check in area, is bright and pretty nice.  They have a nice chandelier hanging in the middle of the room with the check in/out registers on the side.  They also have a nice couch sitting area while you wait for your waiter to come and get you.  My only gripe is that the locker area where you have to put all your belongings in, was a bit snug.  Since it is located in a narrow hallway right in front of the bathrooms, it can be a bit difficult trying to get your stuff in and out while people are walking in and out of the bathrooms.  Especially if your locker is right in front of the bathroom door and yes, we were one of the lucky ones in front of the men's bathroom.  So you can just imagine how many times I had the ""I promise I'm not looking into the men's bathroom while the door is open"" awkward moments and thinking ""no eye contact please"" LOL

Now for the food, they do serve you a 6 course meal all in the dark and they don't let you know beforehand what they are serving you.  You pretty much utilize your senses throughout the entire.  It was fun trying to figure out what we were eating.  Our waiter, Willy, was amazing!  Since we were pretty blind the entire time, he gave us specific instructions on where we could find our water, drink, etc. and what to do with each course.  Not only that, but he was on top of getting us our next course as soon as we were done with the current one.  No waiting, everything was served back to back.  Now be aware that the entire meal is vegan, but don't let that deter you!  Even the meat eating husband enjoyed his meal.  

All in all, I would definitely recommend you try this place out even if just once.  The experience in itself was unique and worth it.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,4,3,4,nB2z3Z_pK073ioVZ-RFkvQ

I was very apprehensive initially, because I couldn't tell if it was a gimmick or not, but as soon as we met our server, Anthony I knew it'd be a good time.

First and foremost, I think it's awesome that our server could tell we were nervous, and therefor tried to break the tension with comedy. He was actually one of my favorite parts of the night. I appreciate that they inquire about allergies, and went ahead and verified why derivations of my allergies were okay, if any. 

Walking in was terrifying, because you go from the light to nothingness. They cushion it with another room that's partially lit, but the absoluteness of darkness was jarring. 

Feeling around to try and discover what foods are what was so fun. Our server wouldn't tell us if we were right or not about what we were eating (except for once on accident) but that made it all the more fun when we got out to see what the menu is (sorry guys, no spoilers from me). They also change their menu every three months, so even though the website says they have sweet, savory, and spicy options, there's a new menu that is actually different now that's one menu for everyone (unless your allergens prevent it). 

I love that Anthony noticed when I didn't finish something because I didn't like it. And he was actually very worried that I wasn't going to get enough food and offered me more because I skipped a portion (it tasted fine, but I've some texture aversion issues and I couldn't get over the mouthfeel coupled with the fact that I had no clue what I was eating). 

You think the courses are too much, they're not. They're perfect! And a pallet cleanser comes in at the perfect time to change the pace. They did a really good job with this. You could sense the chemistry between the employees inside which was also enjoyable to listen to. PLUS, we got a special gift at the end! (I'm not sure if it always happens, or if it's because it's a holiday weekend)I will probably come here every time I visit Vegas just to see the new menu and have the experience again!

However, if you understand what you are getting I think most people would find the experience worth it (at least once) and really cool/enjoyable. 

I have been to a similar restaurant before in Germany but for my BF this was his first experience. The concept is simple, dine in pitch blackness, and experience your food with your other senses. Additionally, because you are completely unplugged you can have a nice actual conversation with your dining mate! 

Service was amazing, Anthony our server was super friendly and helpful. I loved the hostess as well. You can tell they really like where they work and believe in their concept. 

There are 6 courses, all are vegetarian so you don't have to worry that you dont know what you are eating. However, it was NOT vegan, just FYI (they call themselves plant based) if you don't eat dairy I found there to be a lot of creamy sauces although no cheese. (as far as I could tell haha) It was honestly too much food, I couldn't finish the main course which was huge. So even if youre worried about the no meat thing, don't fear even my BF was stuffed. All the dishes tasted good and it was fun trying to guess the flavors and elements of each. I loved eating with my hands but again if you are someone in which that would make you uncomfortable this may not be the place for you. At the end they let you take a look at the menu so you can see how right (or wrong) you were.
If you are looking for a unique experience I would check it out. Honestly it was the same price as all the ""celebrity"" chef restaurants at the casinos and I found this to be more fun than just another over priced strip restaurant.",upTZgbM6SbDTgPc2rjGV5Q,1,0,4,wFNy8Etp6tJIpdhRQ4eGIw

1375161,2018-04-21,1,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"This definitely was a different experience. Dining in the dark with no access to technology was definitely refreshing. From the moment we arrived we were excited for the experience! Our waiter was funny and really accomodating. In fact, all the staff were! My only reason for giving a 4 over a 5 for the star rating is because the food was not the best. 

Without spoiling the menu since that is a major element of the surprise, it just wasn't that great tasting to be honest. When you see the menu after you're done eating you'll see that you ate something completely different than what you thought. This was definitely a fun part of the experience. 

The food wasn't terrible, just not worth the overall cost.  However, you'll see that you're paying for the experience and not the meal. Go... enjoy...spend time talking and not texting. For that alone...i loved it!!!",gW7ZR0O8HZKaE2QniyX2PQ,5,0,4,tmthK2vq69IMx5fygdxgJQ

I'd read a couple of reviews about it after my girlfriend suggest it for my birthday and understood that because you are truly dining in complete darkness, a lot of thought had been put into the menu and the ingredients that make up the 6 courses you'll be served by your night vision goggle clad server. Your 6 courses and their ingredients are purposefully made up of a variety of foods of different textures, flavors, density's and sizes. Before being escorted Conga Line style into the dining room, you'll get to choose one of the 3 flavor genre's that will make up 2 of your 6 courses; savory, spicy or sweet. The other 4 courses are the same for everybody. Your server will then carefully escort your party into the blackness of the dining room and seat you individually., explaining the layout of the table for you because you literally can't see anything. They'll take drink orders (be aware, these are pricey) and bring out your first course. What I found fun about the experience was that I enjoyed every course, and that most of them were relatively complex recipes (no burger or sandwiches) that we'd try to decipher and identify their different ingredients by taste and texture alone. We'd take a bite or two and then discuss what we thought we were eating. For a picky eater or the less adventurous diner, this might not be as fun as it was for us. I enjoyed all of the courses, especially the dessert. Even our conversation felt different because as we talked, all non-verbal cues and feedback were eliminated and you really have to focus on the other persons words. And you may say things you might not otherwise say, if you'd been influenced by those non-verbal cues, such as their facial expressions, while you spoke. Your server continually reminds you, out of courtesy, that they can see everything , while you cannot. They do this because diners often forget that because they've been blind for 60-90 minutes. So don't pick your nose or your butt crack, or do anything else you wouldn't do in the normal light. They'll also tell you which tool to eat with for each course. Such as, ""You'll want to use your fork for this course"". And they'll tell you where that utensil is with a clock face reference; ie. ""At one o'clock is your glass"" or ""Your fork is at your three o'clock"". Overall, it was a great experience and I'd recommend it to any adventurous person who enjoys a new experience.",gGtqfSDAhuXs_2GOyobs8Q,2,0,4,lEH8RhTXfr7ZqHxw05yG4Q

1627142,2017-07-15,3,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"I am giving three stars because the waitress was very upbeat and apologetic. It was a new experience eating in the dark. Also the restrooms were very clean.

1. There is no menu. It is a surprise meant to activate your other senses. You choose between three categories. (Savory, sweet, spicy) 
-No menu seemed exciting. I took the risk, trusted the staff and left extremely disappointed. I did not hide my disappointment. My waitress apologized for 5/6 dishes because I was unhappy.
2. It should not be a secret that this is a vegan restaurant. There are only meat like items.  
-The menu can be secret, but tell people in advance the type of restaurant. I was thoroughly upset. When we first got there and asked about any conditions to be aware of, my bestie told them she is vegetarian. The girl said ok no problem we have a menu with options for you. I said I am not a vegetarian and no allergies. She said ok no problem. During the experience, I kept asking will the next course be my main meal with meat? (I actually asked for meat)  I repeated I'm not vegetarian and expressed my concern there may be confusion in the kitchen. The waitress kept saying possibly... I can't ruin the surprise...test your senses. I think that would have been a good time to tell me I am not getting meat or fish. 
3. The price...$70 per person. There was one course that I fully enjoyed. The other courses I didn't eat everything due to bland taste or certain veggies I have never enjoyed. 

I am not ok paying so much for a meal that I didn't enjoy. It's pitch black so you're  not paying for the ambiance. I expect to pay for great tasting food... whether all vegan or meat included- a price that high MUST be great tasting food. This did not cut it for me.

You'll be greeted by your waiter and enter the curtains where it is pretty much dark. You'll hold your hands on the persons shoulders and move like a slow train walking by other diners. Overall it was a cool experience and I'm glad we tried something different. Let's just say the conversations are interesting when you can't see anyone. The food was pretty easy to find once they tell you they're setting it own. You'll feel for your drink and utensils. Our table did great, no one was clumsy and we all communicated very well. Our party of 4 was $240 at the end including tip (6 course meal).  


TIP: The staff walks around the the inferred goggles so they can easily see if we need anything, by waving our hand in the air.

Coming into a mystery meal, not knowing what you're going to get definitely peaks your curiosity. 

The concept you choose your beverage alcohol of coarse and then you choose your flavor sweet, savory or a little bit of both. Then you put your complete trust into your server. 

When you are ready to be seated you are  guided into a small introduction room off of the lobby. NO cameras, phones, iwatch or anything that can light up is allowed in the dinning room to ensure the absolute darkness that is expected. They provide each couple or group with a locker to keep all of your belongings safe.

Anyhow you enter first room get briefed and then you are guided by your server into the complete blackout dinning room. All of your other senses starts to take over, smell and sounds are in over time until you sit down your taste gets tested.

Mostly Vegetarian dishes with plays on a lot of spices helps stimulate your taste buds to make you figure out the different flavors you are experiencing.  Do mind the sound for some reason when you can't see you SEEM TO BE SPEAKING A LOT LOUDER. You and everyone else in the room lol!

It was I believe a 5 course meal with an alcoholic beverage to help take off the edge of any anxiety you may have with not being able to see. The whole dinner takes about 2 hours to go through to absorb everything in but you can request to be escorted out for restroom breaks or if you just need a breather. 

Oh forgot to mention feel is also a sense that you are encourage to utilize was you are eating your meal. I guess its easier you navigate your food rather then trying to be all proper with your silver wares...or who know what color your spoons and forks were, it was dark lol!

At the end before you are guided out to the main lobby after dinner the server hands the men a rose to present to their date as a surprise. 

One of the best date experience ever, bucket list check oh and the owners are so nice! Everyone must try for sure.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,9,9,5,0LtrSa6gMjQvJUk30pdQcg

If it wasn't for her, I probably would of given this 2 stars. Why you ask? I'm still freaking hungry! For a 6 course meal, $60+ a person (not including drinks) and all vegan menu... I honestly expect more and feel slightly ripped off. If you are one for new experiences by all means try it but expect to hit up the closest McDonald drive thru after. I was so hungry after, I even told them when paying the bill... Living in Vegas, for the price I've paid I should not be this hungry and this broke (joking on the broke part).",FLZZjEX_B-ps9lKwB2CoJg,10,3,3,xeL0S8lstqw8wkwa2p8f-g
2157958,2017-10-31,1,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"Have been really anxious to check out this place and finally had an opportunity to this past weekend. 

We walked in and were greeted by very nice front desk staff. They explained what we should expect from the dining experience and what to do with our electronics and had us sign waivers. 

We were then greeted by our server who would walk us in and get us seated. My wife was a little nervous about being in the dark so the server seated us near an exit sign for some illumination. 

The service was great and I have no complaints about it. The food was quite good. My one complaint was that the first course, which was supposed to be warm, was lukewarm at best. (I won't spoil the surprise of any of the dishes) 

My other complaint was that although it was a unique experience I feel it was a bit overpriced. I wish we could go do this more often but at nearly $170 for 2 (no alcohol), it's not very affordable. If they used pricey meats or protein sources, maybe I'd be a little more understanding but this wasn't the case. These prices are in line with the top restaurants in the city and you don't really go here for that type of formal experience that should come at that cost. 

So definitely give it a shot if you've never experienced anything like this before. It's really cool. But expect to dig deep in your pockets.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,12,2,3,zFGi4R9dSl3Asoa0UQ_g7g

I found a friend ballsy enough to try it with me. Basically you have a pre set  6 course meal in the dark. You cannot pick from a menu so all is a surprise. You only have the choice of picking from savory, sweet, or spicy. So you definitely have to tell then if you have any food allergies. The only things you can order from a menu prior are the alcoholic drinks.  You are not allowed to bring your phone or anything that lights up inside the restaurant. They provide lockers for you to keep your personal belongings.  Before walking in, they will bring you into a room for your eyes to kind of adjust to the dark. After that you are led to your table. You walk in a straight line....hands on shoulders of the person in front of you til you reach your table. Once you are seated you will start to adjust and feel comfortable. I will not be sharing with you the food we ate, but I can tell you we did end up full at the end. Even though portions were small, I feel it was just the right amount. I feel like you always have to keep a convsrsation going with your party otherwise it will be awkward silence. Since its pitch black, your other senses such as hearing and taste are more enhanced. We got a 10% local discount. They change up their menu every season as well. I truly enjoyed the experience, but not sure if I will be back anytime soon. Dont forget to make a reservation. If you are adventurous then definitely try this place. It may be a good 1st date place if you are a nervous kind of person because you guys can get to know eachother in the dark hahaha.",dAfdS9l7DOMze3orptDxiQ,0,0,4,tZBEXBOg6FuYjQf1kZxBWA

This is a fun place to hang out with your friends and families. You get to explore and enjoy your food and your surrounding with only four senses. Fun adventure! 

Its location is a bit hidden, at the corner of Valley View and Flamingo. Once you pulled into the parking lot, you will find the entrance on the side. They will require you sign a waiver (don't worry, they don't serve anything repulsing or sickening - this is a vegetarian dining place). They will then explain the rule while you are in there such as no standing up, etc. You will be asked to remove any blings attached on your body including smart watch and put it in the locker. No cell phone allowed inside. 

The server will then guided you to the dining room. You will not be able to see anything inside, so it is impreative to stay with your server who will guide you to your table. Our server, Anthony was very kind and patient with our group. He explained it all well to us (all first timer). He made sure our drinks were filled up and we enjoyed the food. 

There were six courses throughout the dinner experience. I was so full at the end and could not finish my last course before the desert. I thought the food was so so, hence I cannot give it a five stars. Some was good, some was bland. The experience, however, were unique and exciting! I was guessing and visualizing what I was biting...what was the crunch, could it be.... haha that was the guessing game in my mind the whole time I was there. 

Overall, we had a blast and would recommend this for a special occasion, birthday, team building, etc. Something you should add to your bucket list.",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,10,6,4,izKOEDzXI_WbI9ePm6QeOg

You start off by placing all your belongings in a locker. This includes anything that lights up so be prepared to not have any access to your cell phone. 

You are then giving some shades to wear and you walk into a pitch dark room being lead in by your waiter with your hands on his shoulder for him to guide you to your table. I couldn't see anything. I admit it's scary at first and anxiety of the unknown was getting the best of me but once i sat down it was the most amazing dining experience.

Something about sitting in the dark and not knowing the food that was being served was exhilarating. Your sense of smell, taste, and touch is enlighten. The best part of this experience is that it generates great conversation and avoids you from being distracted by people watching or messing with your cell phone to check on social media. 

The food was good and the music set a great atmosphere. It's a 6 course meal. This is where I had to knock off a star. I felt the food could've been a bit more variety. It felt like dishes were vegetarian. Don't get me wrong it was good but I feel a menu that provides a dish with protein was the missing factor to complete the experience. I know it's kind of hard to serve a protein dish in the dark to be able to cut things up but bite size pieces could be an option. We are in Las Vegas and I've had many food joints here serve incredible dishes so perhaps that's why I'm a little harsh rating the menu. I was full by the end of the 6th dish so that is a plus. At the end is when they will reveal to you the menu. It was fun using my taste buds to guess the food we were eating then at the end seeing if we were right. 

The service was top level as they were right there to refill drinks and the timing between each course was perfect. They knew when to arrive and provide clean utensils after each meal so that old flavors didn't transition to the next meal. They described each dish and gave you great instructions on how to eat the dish. 

I highly highly recommend this type of dining experience. It's a great place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, or as a date as you will get to the know the person more intimately. 

They change their menu ever 3 months so make sure to give them a call to check if you decide to return. I look forward to coming back in the future! They got a fan right here! 

Advice: use the restroom before going in. The transition from pitch dark to light feels like your eyes were dilated. Your gonna be squinting and trying to adjust back to light. You don't want to go in and out believe me. Best is to stay in there for the entire dining.",Q2SqwNL1m9Wt7mlOh5NR_Q,6,3,4,r93SLPyiUZlCMXlIM4_4Yg

You have to understand a few things:

Firstly, this is not an experience for someone who is ""precious"". If your going to be demanding and high maintenance, go somewhere you can pick your food, ogle the waiter, and try to look alluring over candlelight. 

Secondly, the whole point of dining in the dark is so that you fully immerse yourself in the experience of dining, without distractions. Yes, it's a mystery menu. That's part of the point.

Thirdly, I learned something about myself I would have never notified before. I was eating my entree and it was incredible! I think this was the fifth course. I was so full by that point I stopped eating. Our waiter came by and asked if I was done, and I replied honestly that I wasn't sure... I couldn't see how much food was left on my plate. The moral of the story is, without the visual cue to keep eating just bc the food was there, I stopped eating when I was satiated.

The food was excellent and the experience was eye opening (pun quasi intended). Would definitely recommend for foodies and adventurers alike.",G4-0IiHDfhsuCM4x1XIh5g,1,1,5,Tuc2T-UI5i71gAdZkijlwQ

Our server Willy was polite and respectful yet personable and humorous. He offered us comforting advice and gave us a simple run down of how the dinner service would go and it was greatly appreciated. 

The walk into the pitch black dining room did make me a bit nervous, but Willy was great about talking to us during the walk to the table to ensure we were safe and able to follow him. Service was fast but not too fast- each course was timed to perfection with just enough time in between courses to chat and discuss the mysterious foods we were eating.

The server was very nice and engaging as was the person up front. 

The food itself was quite disappointing, especially after reading reviews - it was very salty and greasy; too many flavors trying to be combined. As other reviewers mentioned it is plant based, which is fine with me as I personally followed a vegan diet for many months, but this was not filling food as much as it was just heavy. The dessert was so sweet that I couldn't eat it. 

2 stars because for the price it's not worth it, as innovative of a concept as it is. It's not even directly on the strip- it's in an strip mall near the strip, but you're paying as if it's in a prime location. If it was more reasonably priced or if there were some options for the courses I would've given it 3 stars. 

I honestly think that the restaurant should consider simpler dishes- stick to protein, starch and veggie as was done for many of the courses but use less seasonings. Or include something like a pasta dish, and explore something like a cashew cream sauce which has an amazing amount of flavor but is still simple. Experiencing the crunchiness, texture, natural flavors of the food would enhance the experience overall.",2CJ7wQtoFUEPJZbEw0Zgig,4,3,2,0yz5tMEZV9TprJ_o8LzzlQ

The owners have to be pinching themselves in disbelief at what people are willing to pay (myself included) for the craptastic food just because they have the lights off.

Way too many vinegar based dishes. Don't bother. We are foodies that love our veggies and this place was awful. Not to mention the very awkward waitress and dirty dishes I could feel.

My man and I enjoyed our date night here and it was just SO awesome! I can't wait to return. Our server was phenomenal and made sure we felt comfortable throughout. To remove the sense of sight is at first a tad concerning but as we adjusted it just heightened the mood and experience all together. 

Note that our service took almost two hours so be prepared. 

Also, my non-vegetarian boyfriend enjoyed it just as much as I did. No need to worry about the lack of meat! 

I would've really enjoyed to see photos of the dishes we enjoyed afterwards, although they do show you the printed menu. Seeing what the dish looked like and comparing it to what our imagination has created throughout the experience would've been the icing on the cake! I hope they take this into consideration as time passes.

Another suggestion would be to turn down the lights in the lobby/front room area. It's so bright! Something to set the mood and help adjust our eyes upon entering and exiting would be greatly appreciated.",TfofCo_xEwY4am19d8lGYw,2,0,5,prKVvY-um388cz4pjPLQEw

It forces you to put away your phones and any other distractions and just focus on whoever you brought with you. And the darkness adds an element of intimacy hard to get at restaurants. The food was delicious and mysterious. Its surprisingly difficult to guess what each food is without being able to look at it. At the very end they show you the actual menu and wow so surprised to find I got almost nothing right. They also cater very well to allergies as I am allergic to gluten and they had no problems at all with making sure everything was safe and yummy. Its also a surprisingly large amount of food that starts small and gets larger. And oh that dessert! Epic win. Our server was Victoria and she was very nice and charming.

#2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience. 
#3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. 
All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!

We dined in the afternoon which was a four course vegetarian meal (dinner is six course). This indeed is an all vegetarian restaurant. I am not vegan and never had a total vegan meal but I did enjoy it. Perhaps some people (if you're not vegan) may not be satisfied or feel full as some complain, but I didn't come for the food. I came for the great people I was with, to laugh a lot and for the unique experience and I really loved it.  I won't go into details because the other reviewers already did  but what I was happy to know in advance was to know and prepare myself for pure darkness....no shadows....nothing! When you first walk into the dining room you are like WOW...can't see a darn thing and your other senses kick in big time! It was a lot of fun but also makes you appreciate things you take for granted. Our waiter Willie was AWESOME and will make any anxiety/nervousness you have subside. He guided us through the entire experience and if you lose your way and need help finding a utensil, glass etc. (LOL!) he's right there to help you out. Being with a group of six was perfect because we were able to talk and hear each other easily. We laughed and laughed, had fun trying to find and maneuver things and tried to guess what we were eating. The young lady at the  front desk was super nice and friendly and we met the owner who just great. I hope you go...have fun!",CrEBVkzIQs7tS-wWfaCjNQ,2,1,5,jmzmiDqcB7D0WTPkaGU1pA

Imagine how excited I was when my date surprised me by taking me here! 

At first, all I kept thinking was that show, Black Out, where one has to complete certain tasks in total darkness. As I signed the waiver, even though I was assured none would be served, I pretty much told myself I was going to eat a bunch of live bugs in the dark. 

I was very relieved that nothing I ate contained any live bugs and once I calmed my nerves (the music helped) as I'm afraid of the dark, I found myself really enjoying the whole experience. Eating in complete darkness really perks up your senses and it was fun trying to figure out what we were eating.

What I wasn't a fan of was the price of an all-vegetarian meal. This was a surprise date for me- so I didn't check Yelp or know what I was getting into... apparently it's on the customer to ask about food and even though I had some questions it was never disclosed that the menu is all vegetarian- it's definitely an avoided subject. I'm not opposed to vegetables... but five courses of them is a bit much- and if we are paying around $70 a person I'd rather go with fewer courses with either a meat or vegetarian option. Most of the dishes tasted fine. Some courses I enjoyed better than others. The dessert was a bit generic, but it tasted good. 

I don't know if there's a philosophy behind not outwardly claiming it's a strict vegetarian menu or what, but I found that odd. Overall I'd try again if they ever decide to adjust their menu.",-on2hNUiASICH9wlylxR8w,8,3,3,xYmGIyJNNpVaPmxpBZhBXQ

They walk us in a group holding shoulder to shoulder to our table. Once you enter, you really are in pitch black nothingness. You're extremely vulnerable and need to rely on your server. 

It is definitely an experience that I think everyone that's willing to try, should try. 

I found myself using my hands to feel out my plate before using my fork. It was really difficult figuring out if we ate all our food or not or whether it was dropped in our lap. It was quite cold in the restaurant so maybe bring a light sweater if you get cold easily. 

It's interesting trying to figure out your food relying merely on your taste, touch, and scent. 

My favorite dish was my last course. Since this is supposed to be a mystery I won't ruin the guesses. Overall, it was a different experience and that's basically what you're paying for.

Well, it was definitely a very cool thing, and I'm happy I got the chance to experience it but I don't think I will be back unless there are some changes. When you first get there you check in and sign a waiver. You meet with your server (our server was amazing! I forgot his name but he had a cool mustache!) you get taken behind a curtain and explained what's about to happen. You hold each others shoulders and begin your journey into complete darkness. I wouldn't recommend wearing heels to this place. Your server seats you at your table and explains everything and where all your utensils are. Dinner is a 6 course meal and lunch is 4 courses. My friend and I did the 6 course savory meal. Each course is very small, bite size portions to be exact until you get to the last 2 items. You have no idea what you're eating and they don't tell you until after, but they do ask if you have any guesses. I do have to say, for $60 a person for a 6 course meal, I don't think was worth it at all. The food is insanely small and what you're eating is not expensive food. Another thing I didn't like was the whole menu was vegan, which they do not mention. To my understanding I thought we were gonna be tasting a little bit more expensive unique food, like steaks and seafood. Nope, you're not gonna find any of that here. I don't understand why they ask if anyone is vegan or vegetarian when it doesn't even matter because the whole menu is vegan. They should definitely make that clear because people go in with the impression they're going to be eating a filling 6 course meal. With meat. All in all it's a cool concept. If they were to add non vegan options, make the portions bigger or the price less I think it's gonna work out. But it's vegas, and you can get a hell of a lot more food anywhere around for the amount you're spending.

3467967,2017-11-27,5,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"I gave this review a week of thought before posting it. Bottom line the food was TERRIBLE and like other reviews noted, was served luke warm at best. I predict that this place will be out of business within 6 months if the management doesn't start making changes based on customer feedback and complaints. This is a one and your done type restaurant but terrible food reviews will stop the flow soon. Sounds cool to eat in the dark but no one wants to eat bad food....ever. I really wanted to enjoy this experience with my family but we all walked away wishing we had spent $250 for lunch anyplace else. 

Caution: spoiler alert ahead. 

We were the only customers when we arrived. You have to fill out lots of personal information on a computer for their waiver... No privacy policy involved so I made up all our details. We were given the choice of viewing preset menu choices or going with the mystery menu and since we were there for the experience we all chose the mystery menu and the ""Spicy"" entree.  The staff still seemed to be working out the kinks and did not really have the spiel down yet. Bibs were not offered. Water glasses were never brought to our table after several asks. The dinning room was silent and we could hear the staff talking elsewhere. The food was brought out on a noisy food cart and plopped down in front of us without any details offered by the waiter to intrigue you. Lunch had 4 courses. Only one course, the 2nd was decent. None of them complimented the others and seemed to be random. Random may be fun if the food was good but it was not. The first course, a soup of carrot and coconut was watery, a little gritty and barely warm. The second course, 3 corn fritters in sauce was actually good and something to keep on the menu. Our waiter even mentioned that this was the item everyone liked. This should be a hint that management should try and include other menu items people would like. The 3rd course, our spicy entree was a small risotto ball with sauce over limp bell peppers. Not spicy and not much flavor. The texture of the limp and semi warm bell peppers that tasted like day old something was very unacceptable. It was as if it came from a pot that had been sitting out too long. It made me wonder if there was even a chef in the kitchen or if the waiter just scooped premade food into bowls himself. The 4th course, the dessert was a small cup of strawberry mouse with chocolate on top but it was so sickeningly sweet we could not eat it.  Such an odd contrast compared to the bland meal. Sizes were also very small but that did not matter since we did not finish what we were served anyhow.

Once finished we were rushed back to the lobby without the offering of sunglasses as others had mentioned. The check in desk lady was helping another couple that entered and when I asked to see the menu of what we ate she reluctantly handed it to me but sternly told me to make sure I didn't show it to the other people. Yay, okay. Had not planned to. 

I get the concept and the likelihood that they will not get repeat customers but this place needs to at least develop a menu that will appeal to the masses, food should be served fresh and hot, music should be played for some ambiance and encourage the wait staff to add to the experience. Tell us what is great about what we are about to eat. Is it a family recipe, is it locally sourced, organic or health benefits, why was it chosen for the menu, why is it special??

I am vegetarian which was nice knowing they were more Vegan based by previous reviews. My friend however wasn't to thrilled about the Vegan base cause he was hoping for the meal to be a bit for filling especially for the price! 

Daniel was our waiter which he did great! Good customer service! 

Before our meal the lady told us we would be able to see what we ate after we were done. But, when we finished she then apologized and told us she was unable to let us know anything because of a recent menu change. That woulda been nice to know up front. 

The food was ok... there wasn't anything I tried that I'm dying to try again (my friend felt the same). Nothing stood out to me as wonderful. Both of us ate everything but the dessert. I love me some sweet sweet desserts which it's extremely rare for me to turn down some sweets but it was way too thick and sweet for our liking.

This is not just a restaurant, it truly is an array of feelings you aren't accustomed to. 

As you walk in it's a modern, clean front area. Very friendly staff welcome you and give a quick intro to the concept. Then they have you sign a waiver, put away your things in a locker, pick type of flavor: savory, sweet or spicy (the only thing you get to know about your menu). This is also when you tell them if you have any allergies or food aversions. My brother and I are vegan, they were very accommodating and assured us they would not put anything non-vegan in front of us. They said since this is dining in the dark, they take food preparation very seriously and don't cross-contaminate anything, which put me at ease.

Now, we were escorted into the restaurant, in a ""train"" form, with hands on each others shoulders led by the server. It is a surreal experience, it's completely dark (close your eyes, like that!) and all you can sense is smells and noise from tables around you. Felt like being in a haunted house. As we were seated at a table, the servers gave us more directions as far as how the food will be served. After a while memory kicks into gear and you are able to find your way around your dining space. I was drinking my water and cocktail no problem. Feeling my way slowly not to accidentally knock anything down. 

The food! I have never felt this much thrill while eating in my entire life! Each bite is a complete mystery, you race through the food trying to experience it and discuss it with your dining buddies. There was an item with a fresh strawberry that I and my husband recognized right away, however my brother just could not guess what it was until we told him! This experience truly makes you focus on the food and enjoy it to its full extent! There were 6 courses of small size, and by the time you get to dessert you are well stuffed, but the dessert was absolutely perfect ending to the dinner! Whatever that chocolaty goodness was, was amazing and worth another trip to there just for that!

Come with a open mind and get ready to have a great time. 

Before you enter the dining area you are asked to put your phones and any light emitting objects in a personal locker. You get the key so everything will be safe. 

Your server will then slowly take you to your seat. Make sure you pay close attention to what they are saying because they are your eyes!

After you're seated you will choose something to drink and a flavor pallet for your multi course meal. While looking forward to this event I mostly focused on the eating in the dark aspect but was blown away by the food! Everything was very flavorful, fresh and fun. 

The staff was great and we really enjoyed our host. Our host/server was very friendly informative and made us feel comfortable in the dark. 

This was definitely a great experience and I can't wait to bring back some friends and family.

Blackout: Thank you for the great start to our anniversary weekend.

Tip: Bring someone that you can have a good convo with!",7AU9Di3jrXhMam-UQMK2Cg,7,2,5,on1V-uA5v3QA_YcnKpT4Tg

When it comes to experience and service they deserve 5 stars. Our waiter Daniel was fun and  informative. The 6 course meal spread out over approximately 3 hours felt like we were in a time loop when we were brought back to the light. Having no cellphones available was refreshing and we had a great time figuring out how to manage ourselves in the dark. 
The food however fell short. Without giving anything away the caliber of food felt more like a bad deli's takeaway section instead of a restaurant at $70 per person price point. The dishes lacked depth of flavor and complexity, after the first two courses we lost excitement in our future courses. I personally enjoy vegetarian meals quite often and eat pretty healthy however these dishes felt very plain, simple and I can't even say it was well prepared. If the food was a higher caliber I would have been much happier with my experience.

Make sure you give yourself plenty of time as this is not a fast food joint.  This is my second time dining at Blackout.  First the food is amazing.  I thought it was good the first time but this time out did itself.  I love that while your eating you try to figure out what is in the meal.  You cannot see it so it is completely on taste, feel and smell.  The fact that you are in the dark makes the experience even more fun and adventurous.  Our waiter Anthony helped to make the experience more than I expected.  He was fun and personable.  You always knew where he was when he approached the table or set the food and drink in front of you, he also explained where everything was sitting so you could find it, in the dark.

The atmosphere is fun and relaxing at the same time because unless you tell everyone what you are doing they cannot see you if you are drinking your soup or eating with your hands.  It was a fun experience and I am looking forward to going again.",rKQ-EoWO490qvJWdPhkhyg,0,0,5,As8Q4dae2klqZwbCm6yc2A

The fact that they don't tell you what you are eating adds to the mystery, but you will most likely leave hungry and everything is vegan. The price is something I would expect from a master chef's restaurant on the strip and It just wasn't to that level of perfection.

The first course was two shot glasses of let's say soup to get your taste buds ready. The second course was salad and I had the sweet one. The third course was vegetables and falafels, very tasty but not too sweet! The fourth course was dessert & we all had the same dessert - it was yummy!

HUGE ISSUE:: they don't tell you the price. And won't tell you when you ask. Expect to pay $100 a person. And for the food they provide that's too much. 


They break the price into entry and food, but let's be honest that's a way to confuse the attendee. It's a restaurant. To have a hidden $30 entry fee without telling you till AFTER is extortion. 


Our server was fun and added a lot to the experience. 

I'd love to give a big 5 stars to the idea and the creator, but not after being so overcharged. 


The food wasn't worth that price. I won't spoil
The ""surprise"" of the menu, but suffice to say the ingredients don't warrant $100 

Somehow Vegas has come to an agreement that it's ok to add a lot of hidden charges to bills and patrons will write it off as ""oh well, it's vacation."" I think that is a shitty business practice. 



I'd love to suggest everyone try it, but I don't support they way they aren't transparent with the billing.

3985303,2018-01-04,5,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"Dined here when they first opened as a guest of a friend who was very excited about it.

First things first: this is a VEGAN restaurant. No meat. No dairy. No animal products. None.
It doesn't matter what you tell them on your form and if you tell them you eat meat- it is all an act to make you guess what youre getting. And at no time will it be meat. They've even said here on responses that they dont offer meat because they find it too easy to guess what it is by eating a piece of chicken or steak. True as that may be- it's dishonest and feels very very misleading as a patron. 
I eat almost entirely vegetarian- and I was still offended. This is a city with a lot of fine dining, some of the best in the world, if people are going to spend that much on a tasting menu- let them know what it may be comprised of (I.e this is a entirely plant based menu) everyone should be aware of that going in. It's dishonest not to and you upset more people after the fact than if you had told the truth.
I can only imagine the reverse of tricking people into a meal with meat or dairy  and saying ""look how good that was! Look how we've broadened your horizons!""
Actions like this is what gives a plant based lifestyle and vegans a bad rep.

The review listed here by a 'Lisa G.' Stating she got steak and fish is a blatant lie. Previously Lisa messaged me asking me to take down my Tip here that stated it was a vegan restaurant. She asked me to because she thought it would scare people away and this could help people be turned on to vegan food not knowing when they go in! furthermore all of her yelp reviews are publicly for vegan food and vegan restaurants and on her profile it says ""i love vegan meals"" and ""meat causes cancer"" this woman didnt eat steak, nor was she served it. Im not sure what her agenda is and if she worked for Blackout but if not they should seriously consider deleting that misleading and dishonest review clearly written to ""trick"" people into going thinking they'll get meat or fish- and there's plenty of proof to call her out. I wouldn't want her review on my page if I were this establishment. Update: worse yet they've commented on it saying thank you to her without addressing the blatant lie in her reviews, which is highly unethical as a business and should be duly noted. They're aware of the fact this woman was never served meat as they say themselves they are a ""vegetable forward"" restaurant and are only helping the idea of 'tricking' people into enjoying plant based food without transparency. 

Anyway I digress
The experience was fun and unique but in the end the food was Lukewarm to cold, bland and even tasteless and not worth the money in any sense. Our service was wonderful but everything beyond that fell short on food and experience. Furthermore feeling like youve been lied to or tricked is an awful feeling after dropping hundreds of dollars a person- if this restaurant openly avdertised (and I mean publicly) they were vegan I'd respect them and what they were doing a lot more. In fact I would've been more excited had I known before rather than feeling like someone tricked everyone to smuggly say ""see, look how good that vegan meal was!!"" I've heard that since complaints started some waiters tell you at the get go it's vegan- which is better but in my opinion they could do a lot more to advertise this and make sure people knew, and it could in fact help people become more excited. Nowhere on the information about the menus does it say ""all of our menus are plant based"" which is I think misleading and unethical.
Maybe if they change their business practice and chef I would consider going back, but for now in this town there is too much fine dining (even vegan) to pick from to come here.",ZSsDseiFE7mAh9ZNP-MPqg,15,3,1,pxX4GAEem1Ppix30iYURJA

We got dropped off by our lift at 8:19... our Reservation was ay 8:30 they have on record that we went back at 8:56. After the first 2 course we fine but after which we started to realize we had been there quite a while we asked for the time 3 times... after the second we were told 8:45 ( remeber they said we got there at 8:56) however once we said no way that is thr time....the waitress came back and told us in fact it was 10:20 alot later than she had thought.

 We were told dinner would take 45 to 90 min. After it took very long to get water and our 4th course where we requested to have all others prepaired now and not to wait till we were dones with this one. After awhile and still no water....We realized we were the only table left in the room. 

We raised our hands, hollared and even yelled for someone anyone and no one was in the room. We finally had enought after a plate was neviously pushed off the table and still no one came to help. We desided to get up and try to leave our selfs when, we were a few feet from our table when we finally met by our waiter. It was 10:55pm then...they  close at 11 but tecnically we still had 2 courses left ....

 We paid the full $212 for 3 people. And left.
The next day i called to speak to a manager and where they refunded $70 based on the fact that we didnt finish our last two courses.

They argued that the time that we had experience was typicall.... even at 9pm to 11pm that is 2 hours not 1.5 but we werent done we still had 2 courses left. 

HOWEVER that is not my biggest consern. 
My consern is you trust them to keep you safe as you are completely vulnerable in the dark and yet there was no one in the room with us for at least 20 min.

 We had no way of calling them but yelling and they still didnt come. One of my friends that was with us is highly allergic to dill we exspressed this and the other is very much afraid of the dark. So we have to trust the staff to keep us safe.....
We felt very taken advantage of and disrespected by the responce we got.
 I suggest a policy change where someone is in the room at all times. It is irrisponsable and dangerous for there not to be. Go at your own risk if there is not a policy change.",wPsC-ykuxSRXGtvMkQPHsg,6,3,1,Eof7XJePSffyHCycRAPaHA
4061592,2017-08-14,2,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"I was excited af to try this out as soon as I heard about it and it's A-OK in my book!  I checked it out with my favorite yelper who's always down to try things and step out of her comfort zone..

Service: Great service from entering the building until the very end.  You're greeted immediately by a host and they get you checked in: process your waiver, get you a locker to secure any belongings that might emit light, and introduces you to your server.  Our server broke down the upcoming experience of your other senses become enhanced in the darkness.  Jessica (I believe was her name) was great from beginning to end.  She made us feel comfortable as she led us to the table and brought our dishes for the 6 courses.  She was very professional, friendly and checked on us frequently. 

Food: You have 3 choices for the 6 course meal: Savory, Sweet or Spicy.  I went with spicy and she went with savory.  The food was all vegetarian based we were informed.  Little over priced in terms of the quality and volume, but the experience makes up for the food shortcomings.  Water wasn't offered with our meal, but that was fine since we were enjoying our cocktails.  Cocktails were made well and were $14 a drink.

Ambiance: The lobby was inviting, smartly decorated and clean.  Your dining is in complete darkness but the chairs were padded and comfortable.  Based of the sounds from our conversation and feeling around, I'm guessing our small table was square 3x3 or 4x4?  The background music keeps the mood chill and soothes any anxiety you might have of dining in the dark.  In here, you're more likely to hear food being chewed and cocktails being drank.  Even the voices sound a little different in complete darkness.  I was with a friend I can chat with for hours,but make sure you have someone you enjoy talking with over an hour+ period or it can make for a long dinner. ijs..=)

Value: $64.95 for each person for the current 6 course meal is a little steep considering the quality and quantity of food.  Vegas is a low key foodie city and $64.95 can get two people some high quality food in this city quickly.  I understand we're paying a premium for the experience but the price is coming out hot because it's brand new and there's a buzz.

Something to check out once?  Absolutely, I had a blast and the staff was great.  The value isn't there at the current price but I've paid much more for dining experiences where I didn't have as much fun.  If the price decreases, a local's discount or a groupon kicks in there's a good chance I'll head back.  If they incorporate some kind of happy hour or reverse happy hour special I'm coming back quickly with a group! lol  The experience was that much fun for me!

Our server was Daniel and he took such good care of us - I don't want to give too much of the experience away, but I will say that if you go into this with an open mind, you will no doubt have a great time. There is no question that you are dining in the absolute pitch dark, but the music and food actually distracts you from the fact that you can't see! 

I did see that some other reviewers were complaining about portion sizes - this was not an issue for my husband or myself! Our portions felt huge and they were so filling! My husband is 6'4"" and is not a slender man, so if he left full, everyone else should too! There also seemed to be concerns about the vegan/vegetarian menu options... if you want a steak, go to a steakhouse. These are unique and flavorful dishes that go beyond what the average palette is accommodated to. Don't let the lack of meat dissuade you; live a little and enjoy the food as it is all handmade and fresh, not the frozen overproduced meat products that you can expect even at the finest of steakhouses (and trust me, I love a good steak just as much as the next guy, but this was next level!).

Recommended for special occasions as this experience is a bit on the pricey side, but worth every dollar! Also, their menu changes seasonally so there's opportunity to go back time and time again.

I enjoyed being able to spend the night with my partner because that is what it is all about - the experience. I have read some of these reviews and was shocked at them. If you have practiced mindful eating, you would know that this is for the experience. It was a lot of fun because we ate slower than we normally do because we wanted to try and figure out what we were eating. I would not go in a large group because I feel like I would have to yell across the table but with a partner or a friend, it is a great idea. I saw this idea on a TV show many many years ago and was very excited to have it come to Las Vegas. I think the tourists would love this concept. 

I do believe that you could get more food for your money, but people need to realize that you are paying for the experience. I pay more at a crowded Indian restaurant without the experience.

4215402,2017-07-30,4,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"I was fortunate enough to try this place out thanks to a lovely invitation from a friend. Apparently Blackout Dining just opened at the beginning of this month so it was pretty exciting to try this place out in its prime.

What I liked about this place was its air of mystery. You can tell from the rest of the reviews that no one dared to reveal anything about the main menu so I'll hop onto the bandwagon and keep the mystery chain going as well!

When you reach the restaurant building from the start, you'll notice all the windows are blacked out into secrecy. The entrance is actually on the other side, hidden from view so you'll have to walk around until you see white lettering embossed on the door. Upon walking in, you're greeted with the receptionists wearing uniforms in the same colour scheme as the walls and brand logo of Blackout - black and green. You'll be asked to sign a waver from their immaculate mini computers. 

Afterwards, you are given a key for a mini locker to put your wallet/bag and cellphone away near the bathroom hallway. They'll make it quite clear that absolutely no photography is allowed once you've entered the dining room. I guess that's part of the idea though- a dining experience thats shrouded in mystery. Oooh, ahh!

Once seated, the server will ask give you three options on how you like your menu to be: spicy, savory, or sweet. Don't hesitate to be inquisitive; ask all the questions to your liking. The servers will definitely try to make it comfortable for you as possible. Luckily we came in before it was time for dinner so we pretty much had the four course lunch menu! And oh, whats that, alcoholic drinks? Don't mind if I do! 

Now imagine being in a room in total darkness. Its a strange type of intimacy where you take your time feeling around for things and getting out of your comfort zone by depending on your senses. I was apparently at a table seated among 12 friends so it was thrilling and entertaining to hear their reactions and sounds- from slurping their drinks, crunching onto ice, and om nom nom-ing on their meals. One of them in particular wanted to be the jokester and be touchy feely among their neighboring friends HAHA! It was also fun pseudo clinking to everyones glasses as we made a fake toast to start our meals! 

I'd also like to mention that the musical score they had for background music in the dining area was interesting. They had smooth electronic beats but wasn't overtly done nor did it feel like a nightclub/lounge. It felt rather intimate and surreal, I heard beats from Alina Baraz's ""Undress You"" and reminisced in Sneaker Pimp's ""Six Feet Underground."" Hearing that definitely heightened my stay there. 

Overall, my first sensory experience here was inevitably something that coloured me unique. I liked the idea of it and the execution was definitely creative. However, for the price I honestly feel that it would be best to be here when there's a promotion (ie: the 20% off they had earlier this week) to make it worth the value.

The entrance is nice and appears pretty cleab. They have lockers for you to store your light emitting devices.The dining room itself was pitch black, dark. 

The staff was accommodating and very friendly. Kory was our server and took great care of us. My wife was freaking out within the first 10secs of being in the room. We made it to our table, sat down, and immediately had to get up to step outside because she was panicking a little. The host was able to move our table closer to the entrance to help her fears. Kory was kind enough to lend my wife his NVGs for a minute here and there so she would feel more comfortable, knowing what her surroundings looked like. I doubt I would've been able to try the food if it wasn't your Kory's encouragement and positive reinforcement. 

The experience was fun. Nice way to test your pallet and how much you think you know about food. I'm sure you'll get some but not everything (unless you're G. Ramsey). Give it a go, face your fears, try it out.",KDpYnJJAFkZO-GNa1oq7wA,0,0,4,Kz9Zpfn4XqpUkxJc6IhdFQ

I didn't know what to expect to be dining in the dark. But I get nervous as it is eating in front of people, so this was a savior! 

The lobby was super nice, clean, modern, worthy of posting on social media. Lol. The staff was super nice and personable. We signed in using their laptops. We also were given lockers to place our phones / wallets, anything that would be a distraction or shine light. I thought was cool because I'm all for not being glued to our phones. 

We were given instructions on what to do prior to entering the dark dining room. Our server was Victoria. She was amazing! Super nice. Patient. Informative. Etc. 

The room is pitch black. So dark you can't see a thing. But the experience was awesome! I left there being thankful for my eyesight! Lol. The food was delicious too. Each course was yummy. 

It is on the pricey side, but definitely worth every penny. I would highly recommend and we all agree we would return. Check it out!!",F47atsRPw-KHmRVk5exBFw,4,2,5,WHvCpPrERhxYN-xsKZJxrQ

They lock your stuff up in a locker like you're in grade school again, and walk you into the pitch black dining area like a human train with their night vision goggles. 

Speaking onto the sensory deprivation part, you really are legitimately deprived of sight. Me being me, I found myself looking around everywhere anyway knowing no matter what direction I looked in I'd see the same thing... pitch black. I just found it worth noting simply because all of our table had different discussed behaviorism in this environment. It was very cool and unique. 

I do wish this place wasn't EXCLUSIVELY vegetarian, however. That would have amplified the experience for almost all of us. Even just as an option, it would have been nice. 

I'd recommend but on the caveat that you're very orally experimental and not easily queezy. With your taste heightened, the stuff that's good is really good, but the stuff that's bad is really bad. State your allergies or uncomfortable foods in advance and you should be okay for the most part. But for real... meat... get it in here.",4xgbVGM9yklvk8zrOf7tiA,2,1,4,PMz8Hx0svUbWL1RG55yksA

First, we had a great time at this restaurant. It was fun to rely on other senses. We enjoyed trying to figure out what we were eating.   We were pleased at the end of our meal to see we were mostly correct. 

Our server Martha was amazing as she walked us through our service. She did a phenomenal job explaining how to eat what was in front of us. Her tips and tricks were great.  I regret not asking for extra napkins. It seems almost everyone uses their fingers at some point. With all the sauces it became quite messy. 

We were disappointed in the food. Vegan restaurants should celebrate plant based foods. Black Out tried to disguise the food with rich sauces, too much salt and sugar.

So my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a couple Days and wanted to do as many activities as possible so I Googled something  for us to do and this was one of the things that caught my eye. Why do u ask? We're both foodies and the thought of eating in the dark peaked my curiosity plus I thought it would be a fun experience. So I ended up purchasing for 2 on Groupon ( not much of difference between purchasing on Groupon and at the place saved about 10-20 bucks) Fast forward we get their and we were greeted by the cashier very friendly forgot her name but she explained we needed to fill out a waiver ( Nothing crazy dont worry you won't die of food poison) and were told to put our phones in a locker. The waitress came out wearing night vision goggles and escorted us to the dining area where it was pitch black. You get seven courses and the food actually tasted pretty delicious. One in particular had a great sauce my boyfriend was sneaking food off my plate and of course I didn't know cause it was dark. He told me afterwards ;(. At the end of the meal its revealed what you've eaten. Plus a bonus gift for the ladies. For me this is definitely a one time experience but still something to experience.

Add in the pitch darkness and you create an experience where you really try to identify the textures and the individual ingredients in each dish. You find yourself wondering what that ingredient is that you know is so familiar but just can't place.  Yes, it's vegetarian food, but you really don't feel like you're missing anything - and neither of us could finish all the food.

The owner and waitstaff brief you on the process and patiently work to orient you to your environment. If you ever need anything - since you can't see your waiter - you just raise your hand and they come attentively. Yes I heard a few spills and drops through the night, but it really just added to the experience as we were laughing and having so much fun.

I don't bother with reviews and wouldn't of wrote this if they were straight forward about being a vegan restaurant and not beat around the bush about it  but for them to charge what they charge for what they serve you is just comical and I'll be completely shocked if the business is still opened by the end of the year because it's a place you try once for the gimmick but the food just isn't good to consider going back especially in a terrible location. Did they actually think tourists were going to leave the the strip and all its options to go eat on a shady block behind the Gold Coast?? I love the concept so hopefully someone with some business senses teams up with a real chef that can offer a satisfying menu and open a place like this in a successful location.,-F3EKrtmb-uhZjojHc8u3A,9,2,1,WbNIH7-OFd1uaVmxKi1KbQ

Walking in, you go into a waiting room area where you are asked to put your handbags, electronic watches, and phones into a locker.   So take pictures first!  Once you do that, you will be asked to sign a legal disclaimer (as expected).    You then get offered a drink menu where you can order some specialty cocktails.  After that, it's GO time.   We were escorted by Ashley who was perfect for blackout dining virgins.  She was funny and really took time to explain everything each step of the way.   I held her shoulders and the boy held mine and we were on our way. 

It's SO dark guys.    For us it was a fun date experience as we worked together to try each other's drinks and talk about what we thought we were eating.   Oh yes, important fact:  they will not tell you the menu until the end.   This doesn't matter because the food was delicious.  Nothing made me happier than finding a deposit of food that I missed on the plate.   We laughed the entire time and truly enjoyed the experience.  For meat eaters, adjust your own expectation down a bit.   This isn't a steak house but it is really great plant based food.

I do think it is a bit pricer...could be maybe 10-15% cheaper for what you get but no regrets.   We were told they change out the menu every couple of months so I will definitely go back.   For those interested, 2 of us with 2 alcoholic beverages ran about $240.   They do lunch as well which is a little less expensive.   They also currently have a Groupon which will save you some money if you can schedule in advance.

From being lead to our table through a room so pitch black that I couldn't see a hand in front of my face to figuring out what we were eating was undeniably fun.  No phones, no nothing.  A group at another table likened it to being in the SHU (Orange Is the New Black, anyone?).  But the idea was to heighten one's other senses while sitting through the 6 course plant based meal.  If you're complaining about no meat on the menu, try dealing with a bunch of people holding sharp steak knives in darkness.

All the servers wore night vision goggles (does anyone else automatically think of Silence of the Lambs too?), which helped tremendously when trying to find a utensil or wine glass.  I admittedly gave up during some courses and went hand to mouth just because it was easier.  Not like any of the patrons could see me eat so rudely :P   

I won't get into the food, since revealing that would ruin a lot, but I was surprised how far off I was in guessing what was eaten.  It wasn't until the end that we were shown the full menu, which did garner some laughs.  All of the items were generally decent.    

The only real downer was the price tag, which was around $80 per person without drinks.  I mean...these people are making a killing!  They save money on electricity, didn't need an interior designer, could probably get away with mismatched silverware and don't use any fancy ingredients.  

I was lucky enough to get a BOGO, but despite the fun, would rather wear a blindfold (or just take my glasses off?) to an Indian restaurant.  Even with all that, I still look at the evening fondly.  So if you're looking for a unique date night (literally, blind date) or a funny group outing or just want to spoil that special vegetarian in your life, this is still worth considering.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,105,84,3,_KHlNylz4x_BROM3vO2PXw

We are both Vegan so we knew that we would be getting amazing food. 

That was not the case, the hostess asked if this was a special occasion and we did mention that it was our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement of our anniversary. 

We were cool with that because we are a same sex couple and we understand how people may react. We were also shocked how the bottle service was going to be $35 which is more expensive than the bottle of wine they served. That should have been our first sign of actually leaving. 

When the waitress came up from she made a comment with a small attitude about so you call me up here for a two topper but there are multiple two topper which one is mine. 

The waitress provided wonderful service but it didn't make up for the sub par quality of food. 

The first entree the waitress went ahead and said you may have already had this which we did, and I was already disappointed. We know that the menu changes every couple of months and the last time we went was back in August 2017. 2nd entree was very disappointing as if the restaurant didn't know what to do so they just scrapped a couple of things together and served. The third entree they used gardein products and I was extremely disappointed as prior time they were able to put together a meal and make it delicious and having us use are palette. 

The fourth entree was ok as it wasn't anything to fancy. The fifth entree was definitely a huge disappointment as the veggies were under cooked and the starch was over cooked and the fake meat once again came up again. The dessert came and it was good. The first and last dish was probably the only thing I real enjoyed at the restaurant .

Upon paying my bill I was extremely shocked that the price went up another $20 per person which I do understand that if it's a high demand restaurant that you gotta do what you gotta do but at least make the meal worth $80 per person.

5660274,2017-08-19,4,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"WARNING: THERE IS NO MEAT.

Okay, this is a very mixed review for me. First let me start by saying the employees are absolutely wonderful, and the customer service we received far surpassed all expecations and made the experience an incredibly enjoyable evening. 

Next on the review was the experience itself, for something as simple as eating in the dark it was  actually really fun, unique, and everyone in my party had a really great time. They make you lock your phone(and anything else that creates light) up in a locker, which is really cool and lets you enjoy the people you are with. The only real way to describe it, is that it is an experience like none other you have ever tried. 

Now for the cons and it falls in the most important section of a restaurant, the food. Heres where everything went very downhill for me very quickly and, why I most likely will not be returning. Apparently their entire menu is all Vegan/Vegetarian, which I was unaware of, because it is not posted anywhere in the location, on the advertisement I saw, and the website that led me to the restaurant had no indication. I ended up paying somewhere between $70-$80 with tip, for the six courses on the weekend. Every plate that came out I was expecting meat, and one after another it was just more vegetables and vegan food. Super dissapointing to pay that much and get food that you really did not like, because you have no choice since its a predetermined selection. I did not feel like the food was worth the money and 3/5 people in our party left hungry, and we had to go get food somewhere else after already paying $70 each. 
For that cost you could go to the Bachannal Buffet, Texas de Brazil, and many other higher end restaurants in the city, where you would get a much better bang for your buck in terms of selection, and leaving satisfied. 

Overall, to sum everything up the customer service was above and beyond, and the experience itself is really fun, and unique. But coupled with the lack of meat and food variety, it makes for a very overpriced night which left us hungry, and upset that we paid that much for essentially some plants and sauces. I wouldnt be nearly as upset if it was noted in the restaurant somewhere before we sat down. Because we would have just left and gone somewhere else, prior to even getting a table.",GoIcIKAtJebJVefczaMV4Q,17,2,1,op35tv-G2mBy5N5GP_HQkg

The sensory experience was the main appeal to me but the food definitely beat my expectations.  I work in the restaurant industry and after reading many reviews, lowered my expectations for the taste and whatnot.  Definitely didn't need to do that though.  Everything was super flavorful, some more simpler than others but from the perspective of serving dishes that are going to be eaten in the pitch black I think it was a great menu.  Course 3 was my favorite.  I left full, got to drink a couple local beers, had pleasant service, and an overall good time.


For a 6 course prix fixe the pace was rather quick.  I do think it could have been slowed down just a tad to allow a couple extra minutes between courses, though our server was extremely upbeat and fast momentum so perhaps that was her style.

Pro tip: don't be afraid to eat essentially everything with your hands, and listen when the server talks about where things are located in your dish or table.

5783355,2017-09-05,1,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"Short review: A unique experience that is WAY overpriced for the food you get. 

Long review:  There is no denying that this is a unique concept that is executed well.  This  restaurant is exactly what it says it is.  You get to have a meal in complete darkness.  The staff is very courteous and does an excellent job of welcoming guests, explaining the experience, and guiding you through dinner without hurting yourself or spilling your drinks.  The mood music perfectly complements the pitch black atmosphere as well and to a certain degree it is worth having the experience of trying to eat in complete darkness and figure out what you're tasting. 

However, I can't help but feel the darkness helps to perpetuate a fraud.  It was not until after we started reading these reviews that we found out the place is vegan.  That information is never told to you.  I also did not ask about the price and just assumed it would maybe be somewhere in the $50-$80 range per person.  So when we were presented a bill for over $220 (between my wife and I), I was blown away.  I do not mind paying for a meal like that if I'm getting some quality food (like Kobe beef or something).  But again, this was all vegetables.  There is no way that anyone should need to pay that much for a meal consisting of all vegetables. Our main course was, no kidding, a risotto sandwich. At no point were we blown away by any of the dishes in our six-course meal.  Given that this dining experience is supposed to enhance your other senses (especially taste), you would hope that we would have dishes that were a little more inspiring.  We did not. We went with two other friends and all of us wished to go to In and Out burger afterwards.  

I cannot help but feel that this place would be far more successful and earn a lot more repeat business if it were honest with its menu and pricing and at least offered a non-vegan option.  Great potential. Mediocre food at best.  Only worth the price if you value the experience over the substance.",pEcHu9lR-LxvBeZN1Iv2eg,1,1,2,nTcbOHDolzgwCxfAGnWNcA

You get to indulge in a six course meal being served to you in pitch black darkness using only your sense of touch, taste and smell. The restaurant will adhere to any dietary restrictions that you give them. The food provided did not require me to use my knife, so that was good. Your fork, spoon, and fingers get the job done! 

I think my favorite part was that you have to lock up your cell phones and watches (basically anything that might emit light or sound) in a locker outside of the restrooms. You get to keep the key on you. 

The servers use your first name each time they speak to you. They inform you of where things are by referring to ""time"". Example, your fork is at 9:00, your drink is at 2:00, etc. The Rachel Collins was my cocktail of choice and it was very good! They will provide you with a bib upon entering the dining room if you want one, I opted not to and was totally fine. They give you a free pair of sunglasses upon exiting the dining room and I highly recommend you take that! Even though it was evening, the minimal light in the entry way felt like I was staring directly into the sun! 

Put this place on your list for dinner the next time you need to get out of your dining rut. You'll leave with a smile on your face, and a story to tell people.",ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ,36,29,5,YLOE54KY6-7Pgdfzpl15OA
5793068,2017-08-03,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"I want to first point out this place is vegetarian. And to those who have complained about not being told up front or that there should be meat options let me explain that there is a good reason it is vegetarian. You are dining in PITCH BLACKNESS using your hands most if the time because using a knife would be impossible. Also with meat you run the risk of temperature issues. Imagine trying to bite in to meat or grabbing meat that is too hot, or with fish having issues with bones. So as someone in the business I say to those who are put off by the fact it is vegetarian I say to you suck it up and try it, a vegetable won't kill you and your going for the experience and that is the best part.
Now moving on yes this place is PITCH black the only thing you can see is the floating light from the staffs night vision goggles. 
My advice is too sit with closed eyes because trying to see any light puts a strain on your eyes. 
Matt was our server and he was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. He really made our experience and if you go ask for him. 
I will not spoil it and tell you the menu, trying to figure it out was the most fun.
So my advice is go, have fun enjoy a new experience and some yummy vegetarian dishes.",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,3,0,5,06L1ZjjYN519Agyi7aoKWg

Blackout has 3 ""types"" of meals, Savory, Spicy, and Sweet. My husband and I enjoyed the Spicy 4 course meal. Our server Daniel took great care of us, escorting us to our table in pitch black and informing us of every course change.

Very professional and clean (from what we could see) - completely black inside. Food was amazing - every 6 of the courses. We all loved our food. There were three of us so we got to choose one from each category (spicy, savory and sweet). The wait staff was very professional and didn't hover. I would say their drink selection could be better but all in all I would highly recommend this experience!!",cSVl2qXY-n2gv523cGeSWA,0,0,5,QaFhd60AaaIvfWiEFxR_mg
5865378,2017-10-02,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"The disappointment was this.  We ordered the wine tasting.  They explained that the glasses were like 3/4 full with each pairing.  However, seeing that you can't actually see the pour, we both soon realized it was about two drinks of wine and the glass was empty.  I was a little taken back by this and disappointed.  Next time I would bring my own bottles so I know how much we are getting.  

The food was good.  Our only complaint was the food is just on the warm side vs being hot.  Possibly because they do not want you to burn yourself as you can't see the food.  

Not sure if we will try again.  Our server Anthony was great!  Very funny also and made us feel very comfortable.",91qLUJP_nljeOi8G4uQzWw,7,1,3,frttbpWb3dzQykh0GZV0zg
5910069,2017-11-07,1,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,The service was 5 star but I gave it three stars because the food was blah. Ashley our server was the best. She took the time to explain and made the experience so much fun for us. The cost is around $70 per person (not including cocktails) those are extra about $14 per drink.  We used  a yelp voucher. $55 for $70 worth of food. 6 course meal not good at all sorry to say. The chef needs to improve on the flavors to make this place a success! All vegetable menu hope they add some meat in the near future. We were told the menu will change in January hope its better so we can return!,X7_GQJKvVNNhLjQQ-NvxoA,5,2,3,v30b23RtK-zozrMa3oz9SQ

At first, we were all a little uncomfortable, because we didn't know what to expect going into a pitch black environment. But, on the other hand, that was the point! To try something new!  Our server, Anthony, made us feel at ease, and was very gracious and enjoyable! The food was all fabulous (I won't tell you what it was, in case yours is something similar).  Six courses of delicious food that we all enjoyed!!  And something we found interesting --- if you know what is in your food ahead of time, you often pass on it because you ""don't like a particular ingredient."" Or, if you can see the food ahead of time, you pass judgment on it because the ""serving is too small"" or ""that's way too much. I won't be able to finish it!""  We were afforded none of those prejudices. Consequently we ate what was served to us, and tried it without knowing the ingredients, and without being able to see the serving sizes. We enjoyed the entire meal, and later saw the menu and realized there were ingredients we would not ordinarily have chosen, but we actually liked when we just tried them!!  We eat at a lot of restaurants, but this is one of the most amazing experiences we've ever had!!

Wow.  So much fun.  Such an amazing experience. It was made even more fun by having such a group of friends. Enjoying the delicious food and drink, and the entire experiential aspect of the dinner, was really really enjoyable, even if you couldn't see me smiling in the dark. :-D

The check-in process required us to sign a waiver and have a short briefing talk.  Then we were led past a couple of curtains and turns, conga line style, to our table.  Sitting down was a challenge when you can't see the people next to you, the chair, or the table, but one that was easily overcome, especially since it's something you've done a few times, likely. 

The dishes are not described but are different textures and flavors.  When you're deprived of vision, your other senses are enhanced, and you can curiously consider the scents and tastes before you.  What I liked about all six courses was that the textures were very different and unique.  And very clever in regards to some courses. 

The table I was at had only one wine glass spilled, and lots of laughter and guessing.  We joked and teased each other, and had great conversations. 

When we were done, we compared notes, talked about favorites, and led each other back into the light.  

One note bears emphasizing: The service was absolutely fantastic.  The highest level of service here, with helpful hints for how to eat certain dishes, what to expect from what was on the plate you couldn't see, and refills on water and drinks.  They referred to us by name, which was impressive.  

I think this is highly recommended. I can't wait to come back and I hope I do soon.  Really a must try, well done experience for all the senses except for one.",l0-VQ8nA_oijpKlRB7dkow,2,3,5,HkZx1LHXP3ARDaG4Sf1tMQ
5925489,2018-04-07,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"What a memorable experience!!!

Seriously, the place is dark. As in pitch black. You store your phones and anything else with lights (like watches) in a locker to ensure the dining area stays dark. The server marched us in like kids: single file, our hands on each other's shoulders, nice and slow. This was good because it is really disorienting to see NOTHING. But she put us at ease, carefully guiding us to the table and helping us get oriented and seated. We felt completely safe the entire time.

She also guided us through the meal, explaining where the food was as dishes were served, and making suggestions as to how we could eat it. Expect to use your fingers a lot! It's easiest, and no one can see you anyway. :) 

The menu was really creative, and we liked most of it a lot. ""Plant based"" does mean meatless, in case you didn't catch that - it was a vegan menu. We had fun guessing what it was we were eating, and at the end we saw a menu telling us what it was. We got most of it right but not all. It's really interesting using your other senses more, and noticing what cues you focus on. And although we couldn't see the dishes, I appreciated that they used really interesting shapes. When you can't see, touch is that much more important. They also had good low-key music playing the entire time...to my surprise, I tuned it out, while one of my friends said that was a highlight for her, putting her into almost a meditative state. 

This is an experience I'd love to repeat in the future. They change the menu every few months so that it's always a surprise. So much fun!",whBHYUvpYIsZGsbPRS61zg,0,0,4,j1hzOo5BBETWuD_ZsiRgOg
5928557,2017-11-21,0,5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"The food was surprisingly good. They basically gave us a choice of sweet, savory or spicy. It is a 6 course meal, none of which is disclosed to you until the very end. It is so dark in the restaurant that you can't see your hand in front of you, however, all the waiters and waitresses can see you very well. The experience was very interesting because you must rely on your sense of smell and taste to figure out what you are eating. You also don't know if the restaurant is clean or a dump and whether the dishes are clean or not. You are required to leave cell phones, lighters and anything with light outside in the lockers. They reveal the menu to you at the end but it left me wondering if that was really what we ate. Although food was pretty good. The experience is worth a one time try, but the price of eating there is better spent at a high end restaurant like Ruth's Chris where you can see your food and your surroundings. 2 people, we paid more than a couple hundred. Drinks are charged separately from the $65 per person meal. We had 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine.",du2NxTkiVB5NQsOGlczEVQ,1,0,3,uBecjdOPn-FDN8JyBaXSXw

That should not be a deterrent . I think skipping one meat meal never killed anybody. You'll be surprised at how filling and delicious the courses are. The creativity of the menu still shines through even in total darkness. Like everywhere else, when you dine out you partially pay for atmosphere. Here you get an unforgettable experience. I suggest you go with people that you trust and are well behaved because the darkness does require you to challenge your trust issues and experience something new .  The last two times I went, the menu was the same. However I look forward to coming there again in hopes that they create something new . My only suggestion is that maybe they can ask or keep track of patrons that have dined there before so they can offer something new every time.",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,0,0,5,4fZ7eEQxWczBB_KlRwAlVA
