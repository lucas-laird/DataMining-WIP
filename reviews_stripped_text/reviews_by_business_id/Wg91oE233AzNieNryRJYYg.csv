It was never excellent service but we enjoy the food and occasionally we got great service. Tonight was HORRIBLE, the night started off waiting 20+ minutes for WATER. After someone finally acknowledged us we ordered, another 15 minutes later we got our appetizers. The chips and salsa was covered in salt. When they brought out of main entrees they didn't give us everything we ordered (which they had charged us for) and they had made my order wrong. The waitress never checked in on us after speaking with the manager about our disappointment because we are regulars here. They covered our check but we did not finish the meal and left immediately.

They have a great happy hour at 3pm for 1/2 price appetizers...cool deal!  So, our burgers come and my mushroom swiss burger doesn't look right.  I kinda poke at it..no mushrooms..and a weird gravy on it. I let an employee know and he immediately took the plate away.  Jaime, the manager, came by and profusely apologized and said, ""That was NOT what you ordered.  I'm really sorry about that.""  He said they were making my burger again and he said he was going to give it to me on the house!  I never expected that!  My burger came and it was perfect.  I really like Applebees...their service is quick, their staff is friendly, and I can sit and watch some sports and relax.

Thank you Jaime!  This shows that there are restaurant managers who do care about customer service and customer experience  :)",5ixS7Bcii00Pyirl2l4E_w,2,2,4,e5ZYt0I4o5tdott_DOYH7Q

First The good. The waitress was wonderful. Now the bad. The food wasn't all that great. The chicken  crispers were hard. My aunt and my guy ordered the all you can eat riblets. My guy opened his napkin which had the silverware in it and a gift. There was a small white bug crawling on the knife. My guy showed it to the hostess. The hostess showed the bug to the manager. The manager came over to our table with a very very offensive statement saying ""I heard you brought one of your friends from home"" and he laughed. I looked at the manager and I looked at my guy his face must have changed three shades of black! I was so proud of my guy his normal reaction is to curse the manager out  however, he just looked At the manager and said ""no sir, I did not bring that from home and the manager said it was a joke. Well, we did not think it was funny and highly unprofessional. Even though the food was horrible, the service  was great the only good thing was my guy got his meal free but only after my Aunt made that request.

We were enjoying the games on TV and our food had just came when David turned up the lights full blast like it was last call. We were planning on a couple drinks afterwards so I asked David to turn them down. He turned them down slightly. Not enough though. It was terrible really seemed uncaring of the few people who were at the bar. By the time we finished our meal everyone had cleared the bar. I plan on coming back because you can't beat the club sandwich but won't be sitting at the bar again. DJ and Christian were fun 5 stars for them.

EVERYTIME I come here, I order ""to-go"" (the chips and salsa) and let me name a few thigns that I am really pissed at: 

1) It takes someone forever (about 3-7 minutes) just to come and take my order at the to-go desk. 

2) 2 girls who work there always ring up my chips & salsa for $5.95. Well tonight I went up there & a different girl was working there and she rang up chips and salsa/queso up for like $11!! I said ""Um no, you must have put it in wrong because I always only pay $5.95"" and she got her manager and he said the same thing. ""No it's 11.97""....wtf? I said ""Well can you try to put it in a different way maybe? Because those other two girls do it...maybe try putting it in as like chips and salsa and a SIDE of queso or something???"" and he gets an attitude & says no that theres absolutely no way to do that.....wow really? 


3) They finally bring out my chips and salsa and queso (yes I paid the $11) and they bring me a TINY cup of salsa! It was so small...I laughed and said are you serious....normally they give me a NORMAL sized container of salsa...no this microscopic thing, can you bring me a normal sized one considering I just paid ELEVEN dollars for this?"" and she brings out a bigger container of salsa and had an attitude and did not say thank you or sorry or one dam thing to me. 

It was some mixed girl (black and white) or something..with a tattoo on her neck. 

HORRIBLE!!!!

922029,2014-08-14,1,Wg91oE233AzNieNryRJYYg,"My experiences with Applebees have usually been positive or okay. Our visit did not begin well. Our host, a young and effeminate black man, passed us over for a party of young, white and single men. After he seated them, he sat us, two Hispanic women. I guess the host has extracurricular interests in mind rather than doing his job right. 

Our server, Hispanic as well, was not particularly helpful when it came to my dietary specifications. She acted like the restaurant was doing people like me some kind of favor by being accommodating. The server dedicated more time and service to white customers who were already leaving than us. She wasted our time because the server made us wait several minutes before she came back and took our order. After the iced tea that we ordered finally arrived, we checked out. 

This brings me to address a serious problem in customer services that some minorities perpetuate against ourselves: treating white customers better than ourselves. Whether this is consciously done or not, it is unacceptable and must stop. One cannot presume that nonwhites are going to leave a bad tip compared to whites because some of us see ourselves as ""perpetually poor"" and less worthy. 

When we paid our bill at the front, the host acted flippant and bewildered as to why we left the restaurant. We did not bother to elaborate our reasons because the Applebees staff would be too clueless to get it. Also, The waitress continued with the ""we're doing you a favor attitude"" just because she shaved us $0.40 from our bill, which was the tax. Wow.

When first arriving to Applebee's the parking lot was empty due to the time of day but it was still clean. Once stepping into the restaurant it was cool which was nice on a hot 105 degree day. There weren't any aromas from the kitchen but it did not smell so that was a plus. The music was very low so it seemed quiet making us not want to talk as loud so we wouldn't disturb over guest. The décor reminded me of a sports bar but it is a family restaurant at the same time.  The restaurant was very clean and well organized. There was a nice flow for the food runners to deliver the food and return back to the restaurant. The bar had an attractive setting to view the options. Our server Allegra was very energetic and upbeat. She came and left swiftly and did not spend too much unwanted time at the table. I had the lunch special of 4 cheese mac-n-cheese and a chicken wrap. The food had a pleasant aroma that I recognized because I order the same thing and it had the same savory sweet taste that I enjoyed. Overall the food did not disappoint me. The highlight of our time was our server. She was very professional but still had great small talk. She had an answer to any question we asked and moved quickly to get out dishes and drinks. I have always enjoyed Applebee's so this time did not disappoint. The restaurant is very comfortable and relaxing. My only suggest would be to turn up the music.

I stood at the door for at least 2 minutes before being acknowledged. At least 5 different servers looked me in the face and continued to scurry around the restaurant without a single, ""Hello,"" ""Someone will be right with you,"" ""Welcome,"" NOTHING!!!!! So the bartender DJ saw we were there and greeted us. I told her that several servers had looked at us and kept walking and we had been standing there. She was gracious enough to leave her post at the bar and seat us. I asked her to send the manager over so that I could speak to him about what just happened. She gave us menus and took our drink orders immediately. We thanked her. She continued to check on us and make sure we were good. The manager never came. We ordered and our food came. We ordered several different items, most of which we have had before. One of my favorites are the double crunch wings with the Asian chile sauce. We ordered those and they came out soggy and loose. 

I asked DJ what drink she recommended and she recommended a raspberry lemon drop and it was AMAZING!!! It was literally the highlight of the night along with her service!!!

DJ the bartender came over to check on us and I let her know that the wings were not crunchy and showed her the loose skin. She apologized and immediately went to take them to the kitchen and get us more wings. The manager Dave brought a new set of wings or and it was the same problem. I told him of my issue and he began to make excuses and tell me hat they couldn't get any crispier without being burned. I then informed him that I've had the double crunch wings before and I know what to expect and it's not loose chicken. So he said he would go and make them himself.

As if things couldn't get any worse, While waiting on our chicken my friend found a hair in her Pub Philly Sandwich. So we of course sent that back. DJ came to the rescue on this too and was extremely apologetic

Minutes later the manager Dave came with the wings and they were not right again. The manager Dave proceeded to give excuses like, ""oh they aren't meant to sit because of the sauce."" I informed him that I've had them before and have eaten them the next day and they still had a crunch. He never even came back. DJ took the food back explained it to him and she explained the bill! I feel our whole meal should've been comped but it wasn't. 

DJ the bartender's EXCELLENT service is the only reason this review got one star. But she really gave 5 Star service!!! She was so much more accommodating than the manager Dave the entire night!

Every time I attempted to let my server know I was still waiting for my food while the rest of the party had their food I was told ""wait a minute"" and was ignored. I then witnessed the server and manager discussing the situation on the dining floor a few tables a way. Manager came over and said ""I cancelled the moz sticks"". I told him, I wanted my food. Once I finally received my food, it was time to pay. The manager comped an appetizer, which we didn't ask for or care about, and I payed the remaining bill plus the birthday boys drinks using a card on their table systems. I left a tip even though she most definitely did not deserve one at all and completed a survey (with the waitress standing over the table waiting for me to finish). As I was able to leave I was told wait, we have to confirm your payment, it's not showing up in our systems. I've never received such horribly rude service in my life and been publicly embarrassed in such a manner. I showed my bank statement showing my payment and was STILL asked to show them my debit cards last 4 numbers. 

We asked for a happy birthday song and they laughed. The birthday boy is a VETERAN. No happy birthday song. Discounts don't compensate for shitty service. Also, the entire staff looked extremely sloppy like they were all high. And they moved like it too. Slower than hell. We were told to chug our drinks so they could reuse our glasses. They weren't even busy. So I'm assuming they only have 10 of these glasses. We even said we didn't mind if they were put in a different glass and we're told they needed our glasses to get us a new drink.

Roberto quickly soon figured out that I am constant with my request for refills on my drink and being that it is my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant is when I have to wait for a while, he just went ahead and brought me two glass of my drink which was very good! We got boneless barbecue wings for appetizers which I think is the better choice of the spinach dip, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. They have good mango lemonade which I prefer over the mango ice tea. As for the main course, I got the 4 cheese Mac n cheese with the honey pepper chicken tenders, which my girlfriend also got. Now this dish is good, but personally I think it also tastes a bit too sweet. What makes up for it is for the promo deal, there's a good amount of serving to get you full without that feeling of an over priced meal. To be honest I enjoyed the boneless barbecue wings more than my actual main course meal. The atmosphere of the place is like any Applebee's. A bit dark but still a good vibe. It does get a bit crowded at nights and it just feels really packed but I've only really had Roberto serve me most of the times and I come for the good service. I've visited once with a different host but it didn't really do it for me.",jDcEgczm7r2zlzV1keoW2g,2,0,4,vCNo_aOSVXZQ9VcZWE9lOw

She took our drinks down and happily ran to the bar to get our beverages about 3 minutes later, she came out with our appetizers. Our original waiter then passed by us and commented on the fact that we just then started to eat our appetizers he said and I quote  "" you're just now eating that, that's crazy"" as he walked away. We got our food from a different waiter and enjoyed it very much. About 10 minutes into our meal the original waiter walks up to us with the receipt in hand and leaves it on the table. Unbelievable because  I wasn't even halfway done with my meal.

In the past, the meal portions were pretty skimpy, but the quality was good, so who can complain if it is free? Anyway this year we went and the food quality was horrible. Just horrible. I ordered ""the american standard"" burger and fries, that comes with some wierd sauce, american cheese, bacon, onions. I asked for no cheese, because I dont like smelly american cheese. I get the burger, and lift the bun, and it looks like some one took a bite out of the burger patty. I showed it to the waiter, and he agreed, and offered to get me a new one. He comes back with a supposedly new burger, which looks exactly like the one he returned. with the original bite mark, and two additional bites taken out of it. The burger had some yellow diarea looking sauce, and no bacon. I did not bother returning it, and just ate the fries. I was a cook once, and know what happens when people keep sending the food back.
Wife had the chicken strip platter, and I grabbed a couple of her chicken strips. Not too good, seemed undercooked. 
Needless to say, no tip for the waiter. I usually do tip, if everything is good, and service is good. 
This veterans day the place was not crowded at all. Usually it is pretty crowded. Maybe a lot of people are not very impressed with the food. 
I headed over to the applebees at a different location, and got a free chicke platter. Food quality no good there either. 
I dont think I will be coming here for the free veterans day meals in the future. I absolutely wont be returning to pay full price for this crappy food. Just a big dis-appointment.
Hey applebees, if you are reading this, the free meal thing for veterans day is an opportunity for you guys to impress people with the food, and maybe they will return as regular paying customers. But the meal portions are very skimpy and high priced, and lately the quality is horrible. example: the burger you sell is 10.99, for a couple dollars I can get a better burger at Mcdonalds.

2995325,2017-05-11,0,Wg91oE233AzNieNryRJYYg,"This Applebees locations needs to do something with their 'management' or lack of. We came here for Hispanic Mother's day. Why? I have not clue, mom is a sweetheart and likes the simple things in life. Upon my arrival at 7:30PM I walked in and there was no host/hostess to greet or help me. I waited about 2-3 minutes before someone came over and asked me how many?
 No 'hello how are you doing today?' just 'how many today?'. I told her we would be 5 total so she took my name and told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. We were seated around 7:50 so not too bad. While waiting I noticed how many Hispanic families there was in the building(about 90% of their customers). I also noticed many seemed unhappy and there were so many empty tables,but about 15 people waiting to be seated. Clearly whoever is managing this place has no idea when peak days or international holidays/events are. How can you work in the service industry and not know this. 
Our waiter Devin came and took our drink order and placed our orders rather quickly. He seemed very flustered and already frustrated because I am sure he was getting many complaints and disgruntled guests. It took our drinks about 10 minutes to get to us. My brother ordered a beer and it came stale, he tried a different one, same exact thing. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes, around 8:35 is when we got them. 2 Salads, 1 order of wings, and 1 order of Mozzarella sticks. We had no silverware, plates, or napkins at our table. I had to wait a couple minutes until one of the wait staff walked by and ask for them. Once we finally got a hold of someone we received our knife and fork wrapped in a regular brown napkin, pretty sloppy. 
Our food finally came out around 8:50PM and it was cold, very small amounts of chicken in a pasta, my medium steak was cooked well done and potatoes were cold. I did not want to wait another hour to try and get another steak, instead I had go ask for a steak knife because butter knives aren't meant for steaks, who knew? I tried eating it and couldn't get past the first bite, it was like trying to chew leather. 
I almost forgot to mention, when our food was coming out we had set our appetizer bows and plates to be taken away and 3 different wait staff came to our table to bring our food and none of them bothered getting them out of our way so we could eat comfortably. It wasn't until once younger lady stopped by and took them off our table, I didn't get her name, but she was very pleasant and had a nice attitude and apologized about. She also asked us if we needed anything.
Once we finally were ready to leave it took us about 15 minute just to get our check and another 10 for our waiter to come and check on us again. Once he finally came in I asked him if he knew what today was and told me, yes, he found out a couple hours prior, but they were not pre-shifted or talked about today, which explains why they were so short staffed on what I assume was a rather busy day for them. There was maybe a total of 40-50 people max in the restaurant all night, but could not even come close to proving decent service. 
As I looked around I could see all of the disgruntled and very upset customers. There was no manager anywhere to be found, nobody stopped by and asked how our meal was and if there was anything else we needed, or a simple 'I am sorry, we are short staffed and we sincerely apologize for the long wait times and maybe offer some type of credit or discount for the less than stellar customer service.
I talked to our waiter Devin and told him I understand it is not his fault that the manager does not give a damn about its customers and training or supporting their team. I still  None of the wait staff looked happy or like they were a team. I still gave him a $15 tip because I know it is not his fault the kitchen and management is crap and only so much a waiter can do. There is a clear lack of leadership at this location and something needs to be done. There are so many of the same complaints and management is in denial or just turning a blind eye to the problem at hand. I can assure you we will never be returning to this Applebee's and would highly suggest you think twice about visiting this location until it is under new management that cares about its team and customers.

The server was average. Not too nice, not an ass. Average. He looked like he led an average life, nothing exciting but nothing shady. The booths were average. They have a design on them specifically to make you forget about them. It was almost like staring at a casino floor, it has patterns but nothing you could ever remember. The walls are decked with Rebels stuff but I can't remember a single thing. That was also made to seem appealing but entirely forgettable. The music level also was at some optimal level, just enough to make out the words but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.

We did the 2 for $25 deals. Mozzarella sticks had the breading actually stay on which was good. Unfortunately, there was TOO MUCH breading and then trying to think how many chemicals or the process to keep that breading on there made us worry. Marinara sauce was weak, nothing good there. Ribs were average. The smokey chipotle BBQ sauce was actually good. But no good deed goes unpunished as the ribs were a tad burnt and hard to cut. Shrimp that came with it were pretty gross actually. Not fresh and greasy. Four cheese mac n cheese was not great. It was weirdly sweet and the chicken fingers they put on were comically small. 

But hey, drinks were like $4. So that makes up for some poor food. 

I really think the person who designed/designs for Applebee's is a genius. They have perfected the art of the average dining experience. The food isn't good but it wasn't offensively bad, like it's not the best meal but it was $25 for the whole thing. Eh. The ambiance is generic but nice enough to have a conversation. It's non-threatening. When you are finally tired of debating with your picky friends on where they want to end, you all end up at Applebee's, because why not.

We had a (christmas) gift card burning a hole in our pockets, so we chose boneless chicken wings came with blue cheese and ranch (good amount of zest, but kinda messy)- our appetizer to share, riblets (tender, fall off the bone)- for my husband, and fiesta lime chicken (good flavor), with rice pilaf, and shredded tortilla chips (nice touch)- for me. It was a $25 gift card, so there was a couple dollars left. It's a good value, overall- the 2 for $20 deal. Everything was really good. No complaints. My husband finished his entree. I think that the restaurant chain is along the same lines as Chili's (go here the least out of the three) and TGIF, so it's dependable.

This particular location is not inside the Boulevard Mall, but in the corner of the parking lot sharing Sears Auto Center, facing Maryland Parkway.

And, just like every other Applebee's I have been to, nothing really stands out. I did, however, enjoy the dishes I ordered.

Service was average. The only negative remark about my second server was that he did not seem happy working there and also forgot to refill my water after I asked. Other than that he was just an average server.

In regards to food, the 2 for $20 deal (can be found on the last page of the menu) gives you the best bang for your buck. It comes with an appetizer and two entrees.

We ordered the potato twisters for starters. This was a pleasant surprise for me. It seems that this dish consists of thinly sliced potatoes that are fried with a spicy cheese dip. The potatoes vary -- some slices are half fried and half soft, whereas some are fully fried. I enjoy this because it gives this dish a unique flare. The spicy cheese dip was really good as well and complemented the potatoes perfectly. I recommend this dish to anyone who is also a fellow potato fan. A+++++

Between my boyfriend and I, the two entrees we ordered included the Applebee's Riblets in Honey BBQ and the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne. These two dishes were good, but not ""I-am-going-to-tell-all-my-friends-about-this"" good. Just good.

I am honestly not sure what people expect from a chain restaurant like Applebee's, but I recommend you trying the three dishes I have tried if you are looking a fulfilling meal. I also recommend checking out the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 page if you are sharing amongst people.

I must admit their values menu is pretty cool the 2 for 20$ Menu and it comes with an appetizer.

I ended up ordering the chicken fingers basket with ranch and honey mustard and my aunt ordered the same thing and we had the spinach and artichoke dip..

Applebee's is way low key nice place just to relax, grab american food. Their food is decent, and an ok place to meet up with friends..

I would go back to applebee's suprisingly their menu and service has improved over the years..",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,6,7,3,wNBeGK9Ln_p7pvF7N3sKeg

The second time I ate there I had a different experience.  The steak & shrimp was ok, but didn't meet the quality of the 1st visit.  Tonight we at there again and this was the worst of my visits.  The meal was ok, but not as great as the 1st time.  The presentation was also bad.  Everything was clumped into the middle of the plate, with the steak on the top.  

Another detractor was the customer service.  Our waitress was slow.  She combined our bills, even though we were separate, then tried to give us the 2 for $20 even though it meant one of us paying more.

The service here was great, and the food was done just right. Nothing was over or undercooked. The flavors were distinct, and the drinks were cold.

I took my grandma here for lunch while I was visiting town, so I have no previous experience at this location to base my experience on. However, it is a rarity that  you find a server these days who will patiently wait to be addressed so as to not interrupt a good conversation, especially in the fast paced world of the western USA and in Las Vegas for that matter.

Our server was very very polite, astute, and courteous. It was a very enjoyable, casual lunch.
