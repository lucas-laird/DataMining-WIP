Croissant and pain au chocolat were just like we had in France. Flaky and buttery. Baguette was perfect, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 

It was noon so there people eating but service seemed a little slow. Also, they were out of a number of items which seemed a bit odd for noontime. Later in the day I could understand. 

Would really like to try some other pastries and one of their lunch meals but overall very promising!",a88IGZ0P0YRXePKi0UKARw,0,0,4,EzuExdOuoQJ68DWZ-dyLIA

The sun was just bouncing off of the black sea of a strip mall as the car wash and office supply stores were squeaking to an early morning. Delices Gourmands French Bakery welcomed us like the sand welcomes its lizard royalty. 

This is a place where industry meets cafe. The place looks like a commercial bakery that, thank the good lord, is open to consumers.

The bakery has incredible breads and sweets but no cakes. We believe you can special order those.  They also have crepes, omelettes and sandwiches.

We ate some delicacies that could not decide if they should be in heaven or if they should be on earth. We also questioned whether perhaps we were in heaven or on earth. 

This place could use some help in the service department. You order at the counter, then find a seat -a task that gets harder as Delices Gourmands grows in popularity. Then you wait.  Sometimes the food comes scattered so some guests start earlier than others. 

But the food will bewitch you into returning over and over to try everything. It's that good.",zDjzFJEgx8hxARZoYGXlnw,0,0,4,FJwFr0UIKJw601vAiBOGuw

Visit #1: A latte and a chocolate-raspberry cake/pie thing? The dark chocolate and perfectly-ripe berries atop a firm crust was the highlight of my day!

Visit #2: Popped in for a solo brunch, under $10 for a small salad (love the slightly-spicy house Dijon dressing!) and a ratatouille quiche that was surprisingly filling, with a light crust of cheese on top.

Visit #3: Grabbed a sandwich to go, then hurried back to work. Heavenly bread, plenty of toppings, simple but fresh. I swear I got back to business in a better mood, thanks to the great meal.

Great service, easy parking and a fun little bakery to visit. The only thing we had trouble with was using the Wifi. Three of us couldn't seem to get it to work on any of our devices - iPhones and Macbooks. Oh well, we were there for treats!

Just the right crispy/ flaky outside and light texture inside with a hint of the almond paste. The raisin pastry was not my fav.

Not bad for US made pastries and especially for Vegas standards.
I was about to give 4 stars for the apple turn over ( it tasted almost like the ones you can have in France) but for whatever reason the next day it tasted different ( like a US one).

-the chocolate croissant: not bad but the chocolate is too sweet.

-the brioche -Nutella was pretty dry and very little chocolate.

-the raisin croissant , I didn't like it, different from the real French recipe.

The staff isn't really nice, except the lady, she's professional and helpful. but the guys are obviously annoyed. I'm not complaining about Vegas service, having lived there I know the deal..., rudeness is the norm. That's another topic...

On previous visits, which were mostly late afternoon, they only had a limited selection of pastries.  This time I showed up around 9:30 on a Friday, and there were so many more wonderful pastries to choose from.

My #1 favorite here is their Almond Croissants ($3.90).  I can not begin to tell you how much I love those things.  Almond Croissants aren't even my thing.  Other than this place, I never order them.  The only reason why I tried them here is because, on my second visit last summer, the guy behind the counter practically insisted that I needed to.  So glad I listened to that cat.  One of the best pastries I've ever had in my whole damn life!  Spectacularly good!

I'm also all about the pistachio rolls.  So good!

When I was paying for my almond croissants, another customer strongly advised me to check out the bread here.  The woman had a French accent.  French people don't play when it comes to bread or wine.  They know their sh$T.  I took the woman's advice and brought home a nice crusty baguette.

Sliced up the baguette and made a nice little charcuterie platter.  Really wonderful bread!  And it's not expensive.  I don't recall exactly, but it's like $1.79 or something for a baguette.  Whatever it is exactly, it's worth it.

From the very first day it was love love love. First of all the staff is gracious and generous and friendly as can be. We were offered small tastes of many things and we instantly loved the atmosphere.  We immediately found it to be our favorite, and we have gone almost every day since they opened sometimes twice a day sometimes three if we forgot a loaf of bread. 
Then we ordered an iced latte. They use very delicious coffee and the drink was made to perfection. We are both very picky about our iced coffee drinks and this was wonderful.  But why am I talking about a coffee drink in one of the best French bakeries I've ever visited?  The croissant was large and flaky and exactly what you would expect. Their breads are divine. 
They have created sandwiches such as a tuna and boiled egg concoction that has to be seen and eaten to be believed really delicious.  The quiche Lorraine is divine very very rich and they have about seven other varieties including a bacon one that are equally delicious.  Small glaze desserts are great and many times I've taken a box of them to work to share everyone loves them.  They cater to American taste by offering cheese danish and other danishes which are delicious in their creative versions.  I've had most of the crepes on the menu but my favorite is a mushroom one that is made of mushrooms with a delicious gravy and my husband gets sweet ones which are delicious as well.
One of my favorite French foods is onion soup; i've been known to order two bowls of it for lunch at this place.  They make other soups - there is a vegetable purée it is out of this world.  I recommend getting adventurous with your order because everything coming out of the kitchen is wonderful. 
They offer a brownie that rivals any brownie in an American shop, as well as just one cookie which is made of pecans and deep dark chocolate pieces. How wonderful that they only offer one cookie and it's my favorite. 
The kitchen is open clean and spotless and even the chef comes forward sometimes to say hello.

It transports me out of Las Vegas and to a favorite cafe in St-Germain, Paris.
The pain au chocolat has perfect chocolate throughout it, and the pastry just melts in the mouth after the crispy bite. Just saying chocolate croissant seems to be too prosaic. It's the best palmier ever, and finally, the canelé -- perfection.
A canelé is supposed to be so heavily caramelized so as to be skirting with going black. It will taste like caramel and molasses on the outside. The inside will be airy and cake like. It is heaven in two small bites. That is if you get a proper one. I've almost never had one like that in the US. I was so looking forward to another one on our second trip, and they didn't have any. As our dear leader says -- Sad.
The second day we went with cooked food, along with pastries. My wife says it's the best omelette she's ever had. It was more in the French style.
Finally, the coffee. The coffee was excellent both days. It wasn't bitter, or sour. The drinks were properly made. However, on our first visit the barista had more skill, and it wasn't just that the latte art was better (it was), the coffee was better. That's the problem with real espresso drinks (no whipped cream or flavorings wanted) is that the flavor is in the quality of the barista.

Actually went here a couple of times. When I am in Las Vegas for tradeshows, my coworker and I like to go here to pick up quick sandwiches and ofcourse a couple of pastries that we never finish.. The pastries are always tasty, I always pick up different kinds to try everything! Also got the regular ham and cheese sandwich before. The bread is fresh and delicious. To me, it's a bit chewy! My jaw hurts after, but I still finished the sandwich! 

Environment 
The location is in an open plaza. There are a couple of out door seating. Seating can eat limited. It looks big, you can see what goes on behind the scenes. 

Niceness
The ladies there are all so nice. They are patient to explain anything you want to knows whether you want to know what a certain pastry is made of or what she recommends.

Dollar
Reasonable. On a day when you work at the convention center and want to have a sandwich not from a chain. Or whether you just want to pick up pastries. 

Yes?
I would recommend this to someone that likes sandwiches. It may not be a grande meal or something overly special. Simple sandwich with tasty pastries! Enjoy!",m_8dwsTsN6ZnY9o9ah368Q,1,0,4,ECjA_o_HyxYNZ3UjhUjMfQ

The place had the feel -and most likely is- a wholesale operation, but still the atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant, and the staff very friendly. The selection of breads looked the par, but my years of authentic French bread experience made me a discriminating eater: the chocolate twist was good, the raisin roll not so much: too soggy, not crispy enough from outside.

4414655,2017-04-19,1,QSS4Jry8zQv8yGfkUhsZLA,"My regrets? Not ordering more items and/or coming back for more on my previous trip to Vegas. We were in Vegas briefly as a pit spot to pick up our rental car from McCarran Airport. The road trip was destined to send us through various places in Arizona and Utah. Vegas was just a starting/ending point of the trip. I found this place via Yelp because I was eating at a local breakfast joint literally down the street. Scoop up some pastries for the long road trip ahead? Hell yeah, who doesn't get the road munchies while on a long drive.

It was a Thursday morning and the parking lot was as desolate as being inside Blockbuster Video Store during its final downfall (who remembers this?). The store is just two stores west of the CVS and sits facing W Sahara Avenue. Don't look for the name, just look for the big words: ""French BAKERY & CAFÉ."" It's really not that far from the strip, only a few blocks down from The Palace Station hotel. 

Not to get too boggled down with overbearing specifics, we scooped up a pistachio roll and an apple Danish. The pistachio roll was very subtle. The texture was perfect though. Not too mushy and not hard as a rock. It didn't fall apart; not flaking all over the rental car as I bit into it. It's quite the perfect pairing with a hot caffeinated drink. 

We actually ate the apple Danish the next day. Surprisingly, it still tasted great. Obviously a little sweeter than the pistachio roll. It looked like it should've been overwhelmingly sweet but it wasn't. Again, the texture was still good even though we were eating it the next day. It held up just fine 24 hours later.

As stated, my only regret was that we didn't pick up more goodies from this place when we got back into Vegas. They have plenty more to offer. Some good looking croissants, pastries, breads, and a few French entrées. I will definitely come back to check out the other items when I'm back in Sin City.

A solid find. Thanks Yelpers.",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,3,0,4,Li6GX8lJkTdfsuiMMO0Y1w

Everything about this place was on point! Coffee, bold & strong. Pastries were authentic and the crepes took me back to those bistro cafes in France and Italy. 

We ordered from the savory crepes selection which were the Paris and the Montmartre. The Paris crepe consisted of ham, Monterey Jack cheese topped with a fried egg. Delicious! The Montmartre consisted of spinach, goat cheese, chicken, béchamel, onion and Monterey Jack cheese. Good but a little too rich for my liking. 

 We also got a couple of pastries to accompany our coffee. I have a weakness for almond croissants and these were fantastic! Flaky, buttery with almond cream goodness inside. We also ordered the cranberry scones and they were very good. 

I enjoy Bonjour Bakery, but Delices Gourmands offer a bigger variety of Parisian baked goods and pastries. I recommend Delices Gourmands. Oh and naturally they have baguettes and quiches.",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,4,0,5,L8sSr887qoxCSXnwEgnOyA

We also shared a pistachio financier.  Both the Danish and pistachio roll were very good and reasonably priced, but our first ever financier proved to be, at best, just fair.  The size of the bakery operation and number of workers appears much larger than could be supported by the walk-in business alone so I would hazard a guess that a wholesale operation is either in the embryonic stage or being contemplated.

However, we ordered a bacon panini and a smoked salmon sandwich to eat in there  before heading back to LA.

Opened for approximately one month, and gathering some positive word of mouth from persons often in-the-know, it was just past 10am on Friday that the pink and green sign demarcating ""French Bakery & Café"" was located, the corner of Valley View and Sahara certainly no 'culinary destination'...the same to be said of Delices Gourmands.

Reportedly owned by the former team behind La Belle Terre, ""they use low quality ingredients"" quoted from one local Chef, *though not the one with whom I dined*, Delices Gourmands occupies an enormous footprint within a random Strip Mall and offering several housemade breads alongside sandwiches, quiches and pastries the goods are all nicely presented and average priced, both important to note as management admits the Bakery to be ramping up as a production facility soon.

Well trafficked for a new place, a total of eight parties coming and going over the course of an hour, perusal of Delices Gourmands goods shows several puzzling inconsistencies in labeling as well as ingredients, the 'crescent' in place of Croissant amongst the most obvious though the accented server also seemed clueless when reference was made to a Mille-Feuille she could only call a Napoleon, similar blank stares meeting the request for a Blueberry Clafoutis that she insisted to be a Strawberry Tart.

Eventually selecting fifteen items, the total charge pennies shy of $40 when accounting for tax and tip, tasting began with a twice-baked Almond Croissant that avoided the mistake of too much sweetness but fell short in terms of shatter, the effort still more admirable than a butter version that was almost completely flaccid, the quality only a notch above that of a New York Street Cart.

Disgusted by a canele that ate no different than a gumdrop, the fact apparent even behind glass as the center is puckered while the outside comes across medium yellow instead of browned, Financiers quickly right the ship with great texture and richness whether Pistachio or Natural, the Kouign Amann well caramelized and buttery but falling short of CRAFTkitchen or Bouchon while the Pistachio Snail was another fine choice, though still lacking in terms of lamination.

Executing cookies well, both a jammy Linzer and bitter-sweet Chocolate-Walnut round meeting standards of French bakeries on both sides of the Atlantic, Palmiers come across as a bit drier than several found elsewhere, though it was also less sugary - perhaps merely a different style considering regional variations across France and the Basque, but not particularly memorable just the same.

Moving on to the cold case, a brownie saved for later actually the best thing sampled at Delices Gourmands with a light crunch on the outside and fudgy interior studded with nuts, Carrot Cake was decidedly pedestrian with frosting too-sweet to be described as cream cheese, the 'Napoleon' an unmitigated disaster that smooshed under fork pressure with the layers already soggy despite theoretically being stacked just earlier that day.

Rounding out the morning with a crusted clafoutis that was a bit more firmly set than most yet still satisfying as a result of so much fruit, the Baba au Rhum proved a fortuitous offering considering the Chef I was dining with has been toying with the idea of putting one on his menu, the flavor ""Americanized"" due to a high simple syrup-to-rum ratio though the body was moist and toothsome beneath a dollop of cream that was unfortunately pasty and low-grade.

** Having recently seen the local pastry scene upgraded by Rosallie, Mothership, CRAFTkitchen, PublicUS and Kitchen Table there is simply too much great baking going on throughout the valley to seek out instead of 'settling' for something made to be scalable that is merely 'okay.'",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,3,2,XSsUX1QZfOfImZRp-gtfHQ
