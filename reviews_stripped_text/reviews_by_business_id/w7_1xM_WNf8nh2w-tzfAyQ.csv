445424,2012-04-05,2,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"My brother and I decided to try a new venue so I hopped onto Yelp and found Volcano Grille. It received good reviews and I was very curious to try out their different sauces since I so consider myself a dipping freak (I'm the girl who prefers sweet and sour sauce over ketchup for her French fries). 
Volcano Grille is nestled in what looks like an empty shopping center. There were some seats in the front and more seating toward the right side of the restaurant. What really caught my eye was table set up for the different sauces. You could get as much as you wanted of any kind. It definitely saved me the embarrassment of asking for one of each.
After looking at the menu, I liked that they offered hearty and/or healthy choices They had side dishes of brown rice, white rice, grilled veggies, and gyoza. The proteins ranged from steak (filet mignon, mmmm!)  to salmon. Feeling like a light lunch, I ended up ordering the box lunch of salmon with brown rice and veggies. Before I sat down with my meal I grabbed 3 different sauces: teriyaki, sweet garlic teriyaki and their very own yum yum sauce.
The salmon was cooked nicely, seared with garlic. I found myself dipping my salmon and veggies in the sauces. The yellow yum yum sauce was pretty good,  tangy with a nice hint of creaminess. The sweet garlic teriyaki was my favorite with the salmon. The seared garlic salmon with the garlic in the teriyaki was garlic overload but in a wonderfully delicious way. I ended up going back to the ""Sauce Center"" to get two more cups. Quite tasty!
I feel like this place could be a diamond in the rough. It's not fine dining but definitely a great place for a quick bite if you're not in the mood for greasy, junky fast food. They've got something for the healthy and for those who want to splurge a little (I might just have to try to steak next time). The staff is friendly and overall I had a good experience. You'll definitely catch me over there again.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,5,5,4,w0PCM7z9xW89UGAncgkIug

But now since the price for every item on menu drastically went up and significantly reduced the portion size ($1.50 may not sound a lot but it is when you get only a few pieces of steak and chicken for $13), I would everyone to get a chicken bowl (it is $7.02 now with tax included). It is the most bang for buck because you get less than 10 pieces of steak when you order steak bento for $13.00. Simply over priced. Also they don't use fillet mignon anymore.

The place is usually empty, but I think it's gotta be due to the location, because it's really some of the best Japanese style food I've had. The steak is super juicy, shrimp is great, the noodles are amazing, everything is seasoned extremely well (not overkill though, just tasty), and they have a variety of interesting and tasty sauces.

I live in Henderson, but after a friend introduced me to Volcano, I make it a point to head over, if I am even remotely in that part of town.

It seems to be made to order, so depending on how many orders they have going, it can take a bit. It's worth it, IMO. Might considering calling in an order once you've been a few times and know the menu.",tolEbbJYJpQkZ42XNC-TTQ,5,3,5,j5APbIgIYMMLME5JYrvfNw

As to the food, the Filet Plate is bomb and well worth the $9.95. Its always been cooked to be nice and juicy then with the fact that you get the Gyoza or Vegetable Choice, and choice of Fried Rice or Noodles, you can't go wrong. The Chicken plate is good quality chicken breast too and is at a sweet spot price of $6.95. I usually order a couple plates for my family to split so I have tasted all the offerings many times and everything is always delicious.

And if I haven't sold you yet, they have a choice of like 10 different sauces. I've tried most all are good. Those that stick out are the mustard sauce my wife likes. My son loves the yum yum sauce. I like the sweet garlic sauce.

967480,2011-01-05,4,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"I was pretty surprised at how decent this place was! First off I highly recommend you pick up a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place. Well worth the value and you will get to try more items. 

Volcano Grill is NOT a sitdown-and-get-served restaurant. You step up, place your order and then take a seat. They bring you your containers of food at the table, but they come in to-go bento style packaging. The food is Japanese Grill or Teppanyaki, with out a chef at your table.... 

The menu is very simple. Pick your meat, pick your rice or noodles, pick your side and pick your salad. They have a buffet bar with a large variety of sauces. My husband and I wanted to try a variety so we went with: 

2 fountain beverages $1.69 each (they only have one size now)
three of the combo plates with these items in no particular combo  ($9.75 each)
-black angus beef 
-white tiger shrimp 
-atlantic salmon 
-lo mein 
-brown rice 
-fried rice 
-steamed vegetables x2 
-3 goyzas 
-cucumber salad 
-ginger salad x2

The shrimp were perfect just as they were cooked, no sauce needed. The beef and salmon were good, and cooked well, but they weren't as good as the shrimp. None of the proteins required any additional sauced, they had good flavor with the seasoning they were prepared with. 

The lo mein and fried rice were very good, the brown rice was cooked perfectly. The goyzas were yummy when dipped into the Hot Magma sauce! Steamed veggies were just average. Of the salads, our favorite was the cucumber salad. Next time we will order more of that and 86 the ginger salad. The cukes were crisp and had decent flavor.

The restaurant.com gift certificate that was $25.00 required us to spend $35.00 and so we only came out of pocket about $12, which is better than if we would have come with no gift certificate AND we got more to try.

Overall the food was good. Not amazing, nothing to call home about, but good for a quick lunch or dinner. Volcano Grill will come in handy during lunch time shopping or as a place to pick up dinner on our way home. We will surely return to eat there again.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,2,1,3,1g_w1Bw5HFNphWSLCY3FGQ

I came here with my Grandmother who does not like hot spices and she enjoyed her shrimp and salmon. I had the steak and noodles.

Bento or Bowl, it's your choice. We were staaaahrving so we opted for the bento. Pretty self-explanatory, pick your protein(s) & sides. I ordered the Ginger Salad, Steak, Salmon, Gyoza & Fried Rice Combo while the mister ordered Chicken, Shrimp, Yakisoba, Fried Rice Combo. For approximately $9-11, you get so much food! Steak bites were tender, juicy goodness, salmon was seasoned & cooked well, fried rice was delicious & that ginger dressing on my salad.. MMMMM! There's also a sauce bar & my favorite of course, would have to be the Sweet Teriyaki. I paired it with everything I ate & it made everything even better.

This is by no means a typical Hibachi/Teppanyaki spot so don't expect a grill on your table or anything. But it is cook-to-order quality food.

I dove into my bento box...amazing. I am so mad at myself for judging this place as a fail before tasting it.  It reminds me a lot of a teppanyaki place without having to wait for 8 other strangers to sit at the grill with you to begin ordering.

The food was made to order, so being gluten intolerant it makes it easier for modifications. The employees were so helpful and accommodating. I explained my dietary restriction and he was so nice and said that he would use my GF soy sauce. Then, he informed me which sauces had soy sauce so I knew which ones to avoid. 

I ordered the filet with brown rice and spicy tuna. It was perfectly seasoned and fairly tender. 

The 2 employees that were there are now aware of GF (wheat allergies) and hopefully it will be helpful to future patrons. I'm hoping that they will carry the GF soy sauce in house. Other than that, I'm just happy that they are accommodating.

This place is a hidden gem! You could easily pass it when trying to look for it since it's tucked away in a little shopping center with a mediocre restaurant in the same complex. 

They cook everything fresh on the grill and it's quick! It's inexpensive and the quality of the food is great! I usually order the same thing every time I go so I recommend the filet mignon with lo mein, and gyoza (aka pot stickers) in a bento box. Can't beat it for $10. 

The same guys are always there and are super friendly. They often have specials on facebook if you check in so go and 'like' their page!",H3yXN4G5ABqBhTWDWEyyxw,4,4,4,z1oqYp4_kxwdvVKqtF193g

It's a little out of the way and totally hidden in a corner... but worth finding!
The ingredients are fresh and the sauces are yummy.

The restaurant itself is literally a hole in the wall... teeeny tiny w/ minimal seating but it always looks clean!

We've never eaten inside.. IDK y?  We've always just ordered for pick up and ate at home!

Let's get to the food... 
My husbands usual:  The Filet Mignon: sides fried rice/gyoza/salad
The Filet Mignon is so tender and juicy!  [Obviously i'm prone to just jump on his plate and take what I want!]  If you are a steak lover, this is a good choice.  

My order:  Wild Alaskan Salmon:  sides brown rice and grilled veggies
More health conscious obviously... I love the salmon.  It doesn't taste frozen and it's cooked just right.

The sauces!  They offer a bunch of different sauces to dip your meat, chicken, or seafood in.  My favorite is the terriyaki and  sweet garlic.  [Make sure you have a mint or gum on hand]

Over all... we frequent this place a lot.  We like it!  It's quick and it's good...

 I already looked over their menu so I knew what I wanted to get. I went with the Bento Box, my two proteins were steak and shrimp and sides with rice and garlic noodles. Salad with ginger dressing .79 extra. My husband had the Bento Box also he got the chicken and steak with fried rice and grilled vegetables. We ordered two waters they gave us a little baby cups. So if you want bottled water ask for it. 

 We saw the sauce bar and started loading up on all the flavors from ginger, teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, yum yum, spicy yum yum, sweet garlic, hot mama, and japanese salsa. 

My salad came out first with a ginger dressing which  was very fresh. We waited about ten  minutes for our food to come out. It was hot off the grill and smells so good and taste just as good. It's trial and error when it comes to the sauces, but so much fun to try the different flavors with each meat and vegetable. The garlic noodles are awesome!! The meats were cooked perfectly. I think the steak was the best!! Everything the first time was a little bit greasy. The second time I came with my sister in law it wasn't as greasy. Tried my sister in laws gyoza didn't care for it to much.

Extremely healthy and top-notch fresh ingredients.  It's pretty obvious to me when a place uses fresh ingredients to make its food.  The steak and salmon I had were as good as it gets. Plus, the sauces make everything THAT much better.

And had I not been completely dead starving when I came here, there was no way that I would be able to truck over double steak AND double salmon at the same time along with fried rice and yakisoba.  That right there is almost $20, but easily enough for two meals on a normal day.  Not to mention that $20 for all that food is almost highway robbery.

The location is...um, questionable I would say?  It's literally tucked in the back corner of a fairly deserted strip mall, which is also surrounded by pretty much nothing.  Needless to say, you're not finding this place unless you're looking for it.  Which obviously suits me as long as it holds out like this!

Service is pretty fast too.  Just put your order and within 10 minutes you got food.  Easy as it gets.

It's rare that I give a five star review like this nowadays, but I call it like I see it.  This place deserves one.  Since my friend is in the area, will definitely be coming back.",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,4,5,5,u36Tvuf7xytW7ueOP1bWdw

For protein he chose filet mignon cut steak, and I chose the grilled shrimp.  Tasty, simple, and easy - and they even had a sauce bar (cute touch).

Volcano Grille even passed the test of my 4 year old daughter who ate everything I put on her plate!

Or how they say the smaller hidden places are the best. The atmosphere is chill and the place is kinda spacious. Right when you walk into the place it's the kitchen. You can see them cooking your food. There's also tables right by the separator of the kitchen and the sitting area. Once you walk in you'll hear the good songs they play. Sometimes you might even hear the chefs singing as they're cooking. 

The boyfriend and I decided to get the bento box. Which was a good idea. You get a choice of 2 or 3 proteins and 2 choices of a side like rice, veggies, and or pot stickers.

This place is kind of hidden in a small plaza on the corner of Warm Springs Rd and Tenaya. If you are not paying attention, you can easily drive right by it. I guess the plaza they are in is still pretty new because some of the suites are still unoccupied. 

So I go with the Bento Box. For 3.99 you choose 2 sides from Yakisoba, Fried Rice, White Rice, Brown Rice, Veggies, Gyoza, or Salad. Then you can pick 2 to 3 meat choices each for a charge. Steak is 3.49, Salmon is 3.49, Veggies are 2.49, Chicken is 1.99, and Shrimp is 3.59. I chose double Chicken, Brown Rice, and Salad.

Everything I had on my plate was good and you can tell that it just came off the grill. If you want to, there is a Sauce Bar where they have different sauces you can put on or dip your meat in. I recommend that you get a small serving of each in the plastic cups they provide so you can taste each one. That way you can discover what sauces you favor the most and just get more of that. Also, don't be shy to mix any of the sauces. So far my favorite sauces are the sweet garlic and the spicy teriyaki. I mixed those two together and man, I got the best of both worlds in one cup. 

Service is decent. I was greeted accordingly and was explained the process once I told them I was a first timer. Had to wait for my food a bit but I understand it takes a bit of time to cook it. Of course, if you have lots of people here, it will take a lot longer for your food to get to you.

The ambience of the place has a laid back relax and take your time eating kind of feel to it. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs not to mention more outside.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The only thing that I think could improve would be the meat portions. I doubled my chicken but when I got done, it seemed like I could have eaten more.

This is not a craving but an addiction!  I almost want to hold a special party there for my friends just so I can show them how great this place is!  Okay, back to the review...

They got a new sauce bar!  I think it's easier to use too!  On the downside, prices have increased slightly for all menu items...for example, the filet mignon used to be $9.95 and is now (I think) $10.49'ish, most dishes increased by about .50 cents.  Still insanely cheap for the quality and quantity you are getting!  Now I'm telling my friends, ""All of their dishes are under $11.00!!!!""  The slight price increase is probably due to the paragraph below...

My husband and I were talking with the owners a few weeks ago about how their business is doing and they mentioned their rent is increasing and there may be a possible relocation.  We immediately asked if it will be nearby, and they responded yes it will be (I forget the exact location they said).  PHEW!

I liked it so much the first time, that I came back a second time just a couple days later. 

In my opinion, Volcano Grille has some of the BEST tasting meats that I've had in comparison to similar menu restaurants. 

I ordered the bento box with shrimp and steak, noodles, gyozo, and side salad. The food was cooked completely fresh. The chopped up steak tasted better than most steaks I've had in fine restaurants. That definitely says something as I'm a steak kind of guy. It was tender. It was juicy. The chunks were nice and thick. The FLAVOR was perfect. The shrimp was juicy and just right. The noodles were a perfect balance between quality ingredients and oil, just enough of each, whereas many Chinese restaurants have very tasteless but oily noodles. The potstickers (gyozo) were yummy, they reminded me of the potstickers at P.F. Changs. Definitely worth it. 

The second time we went there, ordered the same thing but with chicken as an addition. The chicken, was masterfully cooked. Plump, cooked but not overdone, and flavored just right. 

They have your regular array of soft drinks as well as a side-bar of different sauces to try your food with. Teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, garlic sauce, soy sauce, sriracha, and several others. 


The owner and employees were very friendly, patient, and respectful to me and my group of friends on both occasions.

I don't know why this restaurant came up but decided to go try it because it was literally 4 mins away from my house. As i arrived to the restaurant i thought it was closed...there were only 2 cars out front and the open sign wasn't even on. The entire business complex is completely empty.

After looking through the window and realizing it was still open i went inside. The inside is actually pretty nice kind of looks like a panda express. The menu is pretty basic. Either order Bento Box or Bowls. You basically get to pick a 2-3 proteins and 2 sides. I picked steak and chick for my protein and fried rice and gyoza as my sides.

The steak and chicken were very good, tender meat both cooked in a garlic seasoning. Definitely my favorite. The fried rice was cooked with onions, scallions and some carrots. it was ok. The rice was little too soft for me, kind of mushy. The gyoza tasted like the frozen ones you get at store and thaw and fry, It wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. 

I would like to come back here but i find the price the biggest negative. For all the food i ordered and 1 drink it ended up being $13. And it wasn't like you got a lot of steak and chicken either... Teriyaki House on rainbow you get so much food for only $7. Maybe on days where i am really lazy i would go back.",fKqMqB36iwQuskyXB1kOtw,2,0,3,G2DTms0FxVXcpag19eeIeg

4973797,2010-12-03,0,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"Been passing by Volcano Grille a lot these days and the Husband and I finally decided to check them out.  (Didn't hurt that they had a gift certificate on restaurant.com either.)  We definitely were surprised with what we got.

First off - Volcano Grill is a fast food Japanese restaurant.  Walking in, there's the counter and register right in front of you.  You put your order in and pay first, then grab your condiments and take a seat.  Our food was brought to us in to go containers despite the fact that we were 'dining in'.

""The Plate"" options include your choice of protein (filet mignon, shrimp, wild alaskan salmon, shredded crab, chicken breast, or vegetarian); choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein; choice of cucumber salad or ginger dressing salad; and choice of grilled vegetables or 3 chicken gyozas.  Your price is determined by the protein choice.

For the two of us, we choice three plate options.

* Filet Mignon Plate with Brown Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and Ginger Dressing Salad ($9.85) - The beef was tasty and the grilled veggies mostly consisted of napa cabbage.  

* Shrimp Plate with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Generous with the shrimp and tasty too!  The gyozas were enjoyable as well.  The cucumber salad is a pickled salad.

* Wild Alaskan Salmon with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Although it wasn't bad, the salmon was our least favorite.

They did get the orders mixed up a bit (wrong side or wrong salad with our protein choice) but we did get everything we wanted.  (Not a big deal since we were sharing, more of a concern if you're picking up for a bunch of different people.)  Although the price says $9.85, I think he may have rang us up for a higher price.  So double check.

I also ordered two regular soft drinks ($1.49) but he rang us up for two large ones ($1.79).  Which wasn't a big deal since we were dining in and they have the cool iced tea machine and soda fountain to help yourself to.  

In the condiments section, they have a bunch of different 'special' sauce that you can help yourself to.  Ultimately, you don't need them, but they are nice to have.  (Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Sweet Onion Chili, Japanese Salsa, and Spicy Miso)

They pride themselves on a menu that has nothing over ten dollars, which is true.  They also offer a cheaper ""The Bowl"" option, which comes with white rice and grilled vegetables. 

Overall, the food was good.  It's more of a lunch option, not some place you'd go out for dinner though.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.  This is far from a teppanyaki experience though!

5083575,2013-05-23,5,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"I went in on my lunch break one day to try out their bento boxes.  I ordered brown rice, garlic noodles, diced salmon, and diced filet mignon.  As you can tell with the pictures posted on here, Volcano Grille tries to bring a menu filled with healthful options (salad, choice of carbs, and protein). While this may be the case, flavor should not be compromised. I was actually a bit disappointed because their food was not packed with flavor.  I understand that they have a bunch of different sauces to pick from and take to go, but at least make the flavors of the actual food stand for themselves.  And no, the seasoning of the garlic on the noodles, and the rub on the fish did not really help.  

Besides their food being a level or two above the borderline of bland, staff was really helpful.  The noise level is a bit average here, not loud at all.  The dining area was very clean, so I appreciate that.  

I would say that if you do not really want to be impressed and are looking for just ""ok"" food that you can just smother a bunch of sauces and sriracha on, consider going here.",K536-wsQXCN7bZaPM0RDng,0,0,2,wps7W9P4y2scugeQ4OS0ZQ

It's a teppanyaki type restaurant, but without all the fancy tables and onion volcanos. I think it's actually a good idea since I like teppanyaki but sometimes I don't need the whole show, weird people sitting at my table or annoying birthday songs. It took them about 5 minutes to make my to-go order and considering they just opened, it seemed fine to me.

I ordered the Ckicken Teppanyaki plate with Bok Choy & Fried Rice. It was all cooked right in front of me, all the ingredients looked and tasted fresh...not too shabby, seems a lot healthier than Panda Express.

The price was a little over $7 without a drink, I guess that seems fair. The decor is simple & modern with dark brown and reds. What kind of cracked me up is the Teppanyaki chef guy still had to add a little flair even though I don't think it's neccesary, I guess old habits die hard.

What I really like about Volcano Grille is you can get a hearty meal that's fresh and healthy for a pretty decent price. All food is cooked to order. The bento box with 2 proteins is the way I went the last time. Steak and shrimp were my choices and next time I am just going to ask for double steak.... The shrimp wasn't so bad, it was just that the steak was THAT good! I think it was the marinade and sauce that were just perfect. Mix it in with your rice and savor every drop!!

While dining in can feel a little awkward (I prefer to takeout) - there are still places to sit and eat. Although when we went in April and ate there - the air conditioner wasn't working very well so it got pretty hot very fast.

The reason, most likely, is that they have solid food. It is better and healthier than fast food. The prices are a little steep for the serving size, but it is a healthy portion. One of their bento boxes is a good amount for an adult, but not as big as other restaurants. 

Each order starts with a protein of choice. My friend got the the shredded imitation crab meat (6.95) and I got the filet mignon (9.95). Next is the choice of starch. The options being white, brown, fried or chow mein. We both got brown rice and there was no extra charge. +1 for not charging for brown or fried rice. Then comes either veggies or gyoza. We got an order of each. I prefer the veggies. They were steaming hot and retained their crunch without being too hard. All boxes come with a salad as well. 

While waiting for the order, we looked around the sauce bar. They have such a large selection that it was hard to pick one. Luckily, the bar is open for as many samples as you want. The sweet garlic, spicy teriyaki, and hot magma sauce were probably our favorites. They also have yum yum, hot mustard, sriracha, ponzu, lava, regular teriyaki, and an unlabeled sauce with onion bits in it. It is cool to see an Asian restaurant have a salsa bar style amenity for their guest.

We also got an order of shu mai because we had wanted dim sum, but missed our time window. They were not that good. Next time I will pass on those.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,9,6,4,WqOhjf5TMiYUQ08g5j1qPA

5492372,2012-03-14,2,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"Come with the expectation this is not a fine dining or traditional Japanese establishment, it's more a fast food/take out joint.  They have a very limited menu of items.  I tried the filet mignon/garlic noodle/gyoza bento combo and the filet was cooked to a perfect tenderness and flavorful! The gyoza is standard fare...definitely not home made.  The only gripe I had really was with the garlic noodles, they really lacked in any kind of flavor....but perhaps that is why they have the unique sauce bar concept.   They have about 10 dipping sauces available, ranging from spicy teriyaki, teriyaki, fuji yum, hot magma, japanese salsa, ponzu, etc  The sauce that stood out to me was the fuji yum...I felt like dipping all the food in it, including the filet =).  The noodles I ended up pouring spicy teriyaki over it to spice it up a bit. So really i would give this place a 3.5 star rating, perhaps I didn't understand I was to pick my own flavor for the noodles at the sauce bar....but generally I prefer my food pre-flavored rather than having to do it myself.

Overall, I would probably go back if I needed to order to go or for a quick lunch.  Food comes out fast, but that may be due to the fact they are not too busy.  There really is no service to rate, since it's a pay up front and grab a seat kind of establishment.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,1,1,3,kGQTC9Kf7qAZExb9bHWIiA

We usually get the bento box with chicken and steak, fried rice and pot stickers.

Food is reasonably priced and realtively healthy if you opt for the brown rice. Steak is soooo tender and tasty! Hoping more people figure out about them, they're in a 95% empty strip mall and it's always pretty empty when I stop by for dinner and I'm so afraid they'll go out of business.

I was in the area and craving rice. Been sick all week and looking for comfort food.

Went in with an open mind.
I ordered the steak and shrimp with brown rice and veggies with a side salad. I pretty much ate everything but walked about disappointed and still hungry. 

This location is really random and hidden... no one was dining in and the employees looked bored.

For the price point, friendly customer service and menu options... it was okay. If you live or work in the area this is a decent lunch spot.

Would I go back? Probably not.
Not to keen on the serve yourself sauce bar... where everyone touches the sauces.

Lunch for 2 with set you back around $20.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,3,1,3,g2uYn2--zxl_CqOA_GU6PQ

The Volcano Grille has superb food. The owner/ chef is incredibly skilled in Japanese cuisine and it shows in everything I have ever eaten there. The food is seasoned to perfection, cooked beautifully, and the sauce bar is the perfect compliment to a spectacular meal. 

Don't judge this book by it's cover. This is no franchise chain fast food... It is fresh, delicious, Japanese cuisine... And best of all it is very inexpensive and prepared to order!

5772118,2013-10-01,1,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"I've come here maybe 3-4 times now. I really like the service here, from the first time that I came to anytime after the guys here have always been so friendly and helpful. 

The first time I got the bento box with shrimp and steak as my protein with fried rice and gyoza and a side salad. I was VERY happy with the steak omg just thinking about it now has my mouth watering it was SUPER tender, flavorful, and scrumptious. The flavor was on point too...LOADED with garlic, which I loved, so if you aren't a fan you might want to stick to something else. The gyoza wasn't memorable, I know it wasn't bad but that is about all I remember. The shrimp I was not a fan of, it was small and under cooked, I haven't gotten it since. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the salad at rice trax's so I was really hoping that it was similar....it wasn't, it was watered down and lacked flavor. 

Also, I have tried the chicken and the noodles. Chicken was great and there was something about the texture of the noodles that threw me off, however, my husband does love the noodles. 

They have a great selection of sauces my favorite are the spicy teriyaki and the ginger sauce AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH the ginger sauce I wish they would bottle it's so AMAZING!!!!!!!

The prices are reasonable, it is always clean, there's never really a wait, service is on point, and the boxes they put the food in is cool they have the coolest lid that makes it so convenient when taking left overs to work the next day. 

I knocked off a star because of consistency, last time I was there the steak didn't taste like it usually does. It was weird I tried my husbands and his was like normal but for whatever reason mine was not.",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,1,2,4,PfzjgjZ1vXlh8tH35GthAw

5876860,2013-04-01,6,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"Not sure where to start. The good, the bad, or the ugly so I guess I will simply start at the beginning....

We drove by this place by accident as my daughter learning to drive and was too nervous to cross a heavily trafficked road.  We ended up taking a right going through a business area and neatly tucked into the corner of a strip mall that can't get much foot traffic let alone car traffic was a place called the Volcano Grille. 

The Bad is the location the Ugly is definitely the decor/ambience. Its barren at best. Hardly anything save the dangling lights hint at the Japanese culture this restaurant has at its core.

Its late March in Vegas, Its just starting to get warn outside yet this place was easily 90° inside. I'm hoping that was by design and a play on the name and not because the store doesn't get enough business to expense air conditioning. We did feel bad for the employees which leads me to the good.

Employees were nice, knowledgeable about the product and to make suggestions based on our orders. The food was plentiful and tasted amazing but we were disappointed with the lack of shrimp we received in our orders. 

We ordered the large meals and received a total of four shrimp a piece. While that upset us the seasoning they had was killer. I could have eaten another 96 or so more. 

The sauces they had were good but for a place called Volcano Grille you would expect a sauce called magna to blow the top of your head off. It barely scratched my throat. The other hot sauce they had did get my noise tingling and had great flavor but wasn't all that hot.

My Girlfriend thought their Hot Teriyaki sauce was the best she ever had and wanted me to see if they would sell us a bottle of it (they wouldn't but told me to take as many to-go containers as I wanted home with us).

Our price was shocking and deserves to be on the bad list as well. It was $35.00 and for that price you would expect a well rounded dining experience served on real plates not plastic throw always. If we go back we will definitely take another Yelpers suggestion and go to restaurant. com for a coupon. 

We will also try another location just to see if the heat in the dinning area and poorly designed decor is a theme for this franchise.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,4,4,2,9muBpiaYOF-HQ9iQAMctAA
5929380,2010-05-18,1,w7_1xM_WNf8nh2w-tzfAyQ,"I wasn't too enthusiastic about this place as we drove into the barren shopping center.  They have those big stickers on the windows outside telling you about their specials.  These stickers usually mean that the restaurant is focusing more on money than the food.  I couldn't be more wrong about this assumption.

I ordered the bowl special, and I was really blown away by the quality of the food.  I ordered the steak.  They make everything to order from fresh meat, and it had a nice sear on it.  Instead of masking all the flavors of fresh veggies, rice, and meat with huge globs of gloopy teriyaki sauce, they use dashes of seasoning to really make all the fresh flavors pop.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by what they were able to do with a little chicken bowl.

They have a sauce bar, and I dipped my meat and veggies in 4 or 5 of the different sauces.  All of them were excellent and different.  I ended up combining 3 of the sauces and mixed it in with the rice.  It was wicked good.

In short, if your want fresh, fast, cheap, high quality Japanese food come here.",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,5,0,4,UbgxaugFS_5FBBtiz41BPQ
