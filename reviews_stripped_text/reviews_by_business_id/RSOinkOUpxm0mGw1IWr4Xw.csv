Had a piece of kampachi, the sake made for Katsuya, and the wagyu beef with foie gras.  Beef was EXCELLENT, kampachi was good, sake was above average. 

Walk in and you get what you'd expect.  Fantastic and kind service, fancy atmosphere, and good but small portions (though tasty).  Sushi prices are for single pieces.

91219,2017-02-10,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"I would give this place one star, but I know the workers there are simply doing there job.. 

So two stars... I'm giving one star back since I did read the menu, and was cognizant of how overpriced this place is..

 It is really pricey, for pedestrian food.. My girlfriend and I went on Superbowl Sunday just after the game, I asked that we be seated at the Sushi bar. The place was not busy, and only a few tables came in after we were seated (around 7:15)

After awhile I  told my girlfriend we are leaving if someone doesn't take our order.... Since the Sushi chef couldn't be bothered to see we were sitting in front of him... And then someone shows up to take my order....

Service is lacking... this was the first time I have ever sat at a sushi bar, where the  Sushi chef  didn't even acknowledge that someone was there..... not a hello, not a teeny amuse bouche, and then there was the ""wasabi"" bait and switch... I noticed one of the helpers grinding fresh wasabi root,  That gave me pause and optimism that I would have a great memorable sushi dinner.. However, when my sushi was presented to me..it had that rehydrated 
 green powder as an accompaniment

In all I got 8 pieces of sushi and one cocktail... cost $85... and I tip....the waitress and server  just work there, they are not responsible for fustercluck that are celeb restaurants..

So $100 8 pieces of fish, one drink....  I left unsatisfied, Ill never  ever go to one the this Katsuya branded restaurants ever again
..

Given the hype.. restaurants that allege to operate at this level need to get everything right every time... Katsuya Las Vegas fails...


So if you are OK with paying stupid prices for food you can get elsewhere for a lot less go for it,,,",1uSH7SJEXKOJJxfIDUg2wQ,2,0,2,IJvxKPNjIoT-5i9cI4BaWw

118016,2014-09-23,1,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"I was staying at SLS about a week and a half ago, and was pretty disappointed with the check in and Unami burger.  With the lack of service from Unami burger, I was really skeptical about trying Katsuya.  I was with my mom and a friend walking around the hotel, and decided to try it out.  And, I have to say that I am glad that we did!!!!

We made reservations around 7, upon arriving I could tell that the service would meet my expectations.  When we were seated, Dash was every prompt on filling our glasses and recommending some items on the menu.  Of course he commended the chawanmushi, crab rolls, omakase geta, and the carbonara.  Shortly, after giving us his recommendations our server Jen (?) made sure that we were doing alright with the menu, and suggested that we try the watermelon cucumber mojito.

After letting us decided, we order the slider, omakase geta (which feeds 2-4 people), watermelon cucmber mojito, and a couple of apps that I really can't remember.  First off, the chawanmushi was AMAZING!!!!! I have to say that it is THE BEST that I ever had!!!!! And, the omakase geta was AMAZING as well,  Coming from Hawaii, we know our seafood and Japanese food.  And, I have to say that omakase geta was probable the fresh fish I had in a really long time.  The ama ebi was so sweet!!!

While dining there, Dash and Jen were excellent!!! Their service surpassed all my expectations, and really turned my feelings around about the hotel and their service!!!!!",xRyFpZPWYefy7Xj0MSAf1A,3,3,5,d84SfnjNC07hsw-BqL5MjQ

219824,2016-08-28,2,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"SLS is an interesting resort. It's too isolated to be mediocre, but (aside from the veneer of elegance) is rather charmless. This carries over to Katsuya, a Zagat rated sushi joint, with stained wall coverings, and a harried staff unwilling or unable to explain what customers will be served while ordering. 

We had the Chef's Choice sashimi, and each selection was fresh and tasty to be sure. However, do you remember that girl in 6th grade who started wearing blue eyeshadow, before all of the other girls were wearing makeup?  Remember how awesome you thought it was? How chic and adult she looked?  The reality was quite different, and time reveals what a disastrous choice she made (I mean, really, blue eyeshadow?) Katsuya is that girl in restaurant form, and she still hasn't figured out just why people are looking at her with a small smirk.

Katsuya chose trendy over satisfying, and that's just not good enough. I can't believe that we are the only people who've chosen that dish, only to be confronted with a meager selection of food and fake wasabi.  At the very least have a picture for us rubes who aren't used to trendy food selections.  Encourage your staff to ask the question, ""have you ever ordered a dish like this before?  You're getting the chef's best selections, but the portions are modest and intended to be savored, so if you have an appetite you may want to order some rolls.""",wM826KHTxfMC4paZ13rwxg,0,1,1,mOpqhXuhQa_BiEYF6xGuNw

Would not change a thing! Had to order a second salmon sashimi because it was too melt in your mouth amazing. Overall the quality of sushi and food here was amazing. Five stars for sure. The service, on the other hand, was lacking. They claimed they didn't have our reservation, but seated the two of us quickly anyways. The waitress hardly ever came by to check on us, had no recommendations and overall was mediocre. It was easy to only have one round at drinks when you only see your waitress once. She also forgot our hamachi order and then charged us for the crispy rice after we gave her the coupon.

Especially when you get of a long night of running a restaurant and you just want to have a bite and a drink with some friends at goyemon. But this place trumps blue ribbon, social house and kumi. It's not the all you can eat vegas tradition but even know it is pricy, it is worth every cent and scent. I love the servers, all knowledgeable as a well managed spot should be. Food was impeccable from presentation to taste. Atmosphere was mind blowing, especially when you think that this is a building that is over a half of century old. 

Server made recommendations and all were on point. The fried rice here crazy good, not like the crab fried rice I had at the other Japanese spot, gross. She set us up with a bottle and some hand crafted drinks and it did nothing but elevate the experience.  Managers touching tables, chef made apperinces to the tables. This was a well trained room with quality training of server sequence.

As for the food, you will leave happy.   Fish was not to cold allowing the oils to release nicely and giving full flavor to the  sushimi. Fried rice as I said, crazy good. And overall just a great experience.  I love my job but I love to see when the industry produces venues like this, so I can up our game and my standards.

870822,2016-05-23,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,I originally gave this place 2 stars mainly because of the long wait and lack of staff. Every thing I had tasted really good. However we waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our sushi. The waiter warned that it would be a little while before we got our sushi. However I seen some tables that sat after us get their sushi before us. After inquiring about it they said they accidentally gave my sushi platter away to someone else. I had a flight to catch and was not expecting to wait this long. Food was excellent. Just ruined by under staffed sushi chefs and poor attention to detail. The manager apologized for the long wait and took the sushi off my bill  he also threw in a free dessert. So I changed my review of 2 stars to 4. Had I not have to wait they would of got a 5. Food is worth going there for. I'm sure it's an amazing place if you don't have to wait.,SgviM36bnjNDi9Dk0crV9Q,0,0,4,lM8RAVcVCOkKsK4yc0KTUw

899946,2015-07-13,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"We were recently in Vegas and my friend wanted sushi so we decided to try Katsuya as it boasted the most vegetarian options (for me) to choose from. We were there around 8pm on a Friday and though we made a reservation we didn't need to as it was not even half way full. We didn't order anything crazy and stuck to some simple basic fare, so for us this was the most well-priced meal we had on our trip to Las Vegas costing just about $50 total for 2 people (before tip and with no booze).  We started with the corn tempura which came stacked high in a beautiful presentation.  Interesting and unique twist on the basic tempura that every Asian style restaurant offers and equally delicious.  We also got the Japanese Caprese Salad which was also very good.  Additionally we ordered a spicy tuna roll, the cucumber roll, and the vegetable roll.  Even though we got a lot of basic menu items they were all fresh, wonderfully presented and executed perfectly. One thing I also enjoyed was the size of the pieces that they sliced the sushi rolls into...they were perfect true 'bite size' pieces. Greatly appreciated since I am always the person either practically choking myself trying to eat sushi in one bite or trying to take it in two and having the whole piece fall apart onto my plate.  With how wonderful even the most basic of menu items were, I can only imagine how good everything else on the menu must be.  Atmosphere is pretty simple, modern with clean lines, and casual.  Bathrooms had a nice decor and were clean.  I liked that the sushi bar was the focal point, located in the center of the restaurant with the regular bar located against the wall to the right.  Service was good-waters were always full and our server was able to answer all of our questions and make suggestions.

Pros - Food is delicious! Hands down! I used to come here almost every other week with friends. I absolutely love their baked crab handroll & their yellowtail sashimi. Those are my absolute two favorites. Their service is great and you don't have to wait long for the food. 

Cons - Everything is wayyy too overpriced and their decor and furnishings aren't that great for an overpriced restaurant. Their tables look cheap and almost feels like they cut down on the decor. Secondly, they're not open everyday. They're closed on Tues-Weds and only open for a few hours a night for dinner.

They entrees literally came with nothing, and even though we got a side, I still felt like I needed carbs, especially since there is no bread for the table.  I ended up ordering a side of vegetable fried rice, and it was pretty much the worst I've ever had.  It was so salty that I felt parched and had a horrible taste in my mouth the rest of the night.

The venue was very open and with dim lighting, and the service was amazing from start to finish! :)

We started the night off with some of their signature cocktails, which were delicious! Highly recommend:
- BURNING MANDARIN: Absolut mandarin vodka, hand crushed serrano chili, fresh lemon & orange juice with a splash of cranberry. 
- WATERMELON CUCUMBER MOJITO: Bacardi rum, crushed seedless watermelon, englist cucumbers, fresh mind & freshly squeezed lime juice.

In terms of what we ordered, we shared:
- KATSUYA CEVICHE ($18.00): A generous amount of a refreshing blend of sashimi, dressed with yusu and lime -- with a side of light shrimp chips. Such a perfect appetizer!
- CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($13.00): A large helping of brussel sprouts with salsalmic soy reduction & toasted almonds. Amazing! We HAD to get two orders of this... that's how good it was! 
- CRISPY RICE W/ SPICY TUNA: Four individual spicy tuna sushi -- supposedly their most flavorful dish, no soy sauce or anything needed! A definite must try! 
- LOBSTER ROLL ($24.00): Cajun spiced lobster on top of a California roll with dynamite sauce.

So we started out with some Rock Shrimp, Brussels, jalapeño Hamachi, Crispy Rice w/spicy Tuna... Everything was good, no complaints... 

I ordered the Miso Cod which was good aswell, didn't care much for the potato thing. Really had a plain taste to it, but the cod itself was good! Nice and hot, miso was perfect on the fish! My friends ordered some sushi rolls believe it was Sahara, Baked Crab, lobster roll. All the rolls where great actually, and I found it neat that they plate the lobster body with the roll!!!! We had sashimi which was nice n fresh, think that was my favorite part of the meal was the sashimi! Dessert was Mochi Ice Cream and this Yuzu tart thing.

Stephen Lim was the sushi chef who stuffed me so full, I had a hard time leaving Katsuya and this is as a pregnant woman who gave up raw fish while pregnant.  Thanks to his suggestion, I tried the crispy brussel sprouts.  Omg.  It was SO GOOD!!  It was incredibly tasty and crispy but without being greasy.  I don't know how they managed to do that.  It must be culinary magic.

The hamachi kama was also amazing.  It was fresh and the dipping sauce was both tangy and light.  The chicken karaage was also amazing.  Light, crispy and magical.

I wish I could remember what the name of the roll of was that Stephen made for me.  He understood my craving for sushi but my hesitation to eat raw fish.

There was a group of 15 of us and we were seated in the ""dragon room"" as I call it because the wall had a huge drawing of a dragon. There was one other smaller table in the room with us. We ordered tons of food since they were small portions and very easy to share. Can't remember which items stood out the most - they were all very delicious. I think the dry noodles/ramen was my favorite. It was served in a ceramic pot. I liked that you get some of the crispiness from the noodles mixed in with the softer ingredients and the flavors were all there. I didn't have the sushi but someone from our table ordered the sushi boat - it was quite extravagant! The cocktails were very good - we had the special that they made but I can't remember the name of it. Oh we also met Lamar Odom when we dined here. I love the decor of this restaurant and the openness even though it was a small restaurant.

SLS Las Vegas
2535 S Las Vegas Blvd
Las Vegas, NV 89109
5 STAR

The night started out badly due to a flood warning and heavy rains in our area.  The parking garage at the SLS is an extremely old structure.  Thankfully, we parked on the first floor because the elevators were shorted out due to the rain.  I am disabled, so struggling down one flight of stairs along the outside of a very wet, roof pouring water on top of me, uncovered stairwell, was a bad start and a bad reflection on the SLS Hotel only (not the restaurant).  I also had to walk through large puddles of water in some very expensive leather shoes.  This put me in a very bad mood before even starting dinner.  But enough of that.  

Our reservation was for 8:30pm.  We arrived at 8:22pm at the Hostess Station but no one was manning it.  However, a hostess showed up within minutes. and we were seated at our choice of table or bar.  If I'm seated within ten minutes of my reservation, I consider it five stars.  We were seated a few minutes prior to our reservation.  So, kudos again.  Our waitress' name is Ashley.  She, along with two helping servers/bus persons, did an excellent job.

Although I have rated everything for the evening, I do have to point out that the reservation was well known by the staff and we were being presented the best service, table seating, timely food service, just the best of everything under the direct supervision of the general manager.  We expected no less.  So this review should be judged by readers completely on the taste and presentation of the food alone.

We chose our food selections according to reviews we read, selecting only the items people had raved about and that we had not ordered on our first time in the restaurant.  We order two drinks, a Burning Mandarin and a watermelon/cucumber cooler (not sure the price but Happy Hour showed them for $7 each), and two waters with lemon.  At the same time we also ordered our appetizers, Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($13) and Wagyu Shashimi ($18).  The drinks came out instantly and were quickly followed by the appetizers.  The watermelon/cucumber cooler was delicious.  The waitress remembered the lemon slices for the water.  I didn't like the Burning Mandarin, it seemed too strong to me, but my son loved it.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were not anything like I imagined.  They looked more like wilted mini leaves in a bowl.  Looks were deceiving.  They were sooo delicious and different (in a good way).  I cannot wait for someone to leak the recipe so I can make them at home.  The Wagyu Shashimi was outstanding too.  It was medium rare tender beef strips with a light flavored oil on top.  Also delicious.  I added wasabi to my bites and it just elevated the flavor.

For our main course, we ordered a Wagyu Rib Eye ($48) medium rare, A4 Wagyu Fried Rice, Pork Belly and a Tiger Roll with fresh wasabi.  The Pork Belly and Tiger Roll arrived first, shortly followed by the Rib Eye and Fried Rice.  The Pork Belly should get 10 stars.  I died and went to heaven with my first bite.  My son does not eat or like fatty meats, and yet, he fell in love with it on the first bite, too.  I will be ordering a side of Pork Belly every time I eat there from now on.  It was the star of my meal.  The Tiger Roll was large with about 12 pieces, and scrumptious, a definite 5 stars.  The Wagyu Rib Eye arrives on a sizzling plate topped with truffle butter and a side of wasabi-ponzu sauce which you can use for dip or to pour over the beef.  The beef is sliced atop two large caramelized onion slices.  Perfect for sharing, which is what we did.  The Wagyu Rib Eye was good, very tender, but not extraordinary, but definitely 4 stars.  My son felt like the Wagyu Fried Rice was the star of his meal.  The rice is sticky style so it's easy to pick up with chop sticks.  It has a luscious sauce and was topped with five larger than bite-size portions of Wagyu beef, very tender, and sooo flavorful.

Lastly, I have to mention the General Manager Jonathan Toobi.  He was awesome (and gorgeous (but that's a different review *grin*).  He made us feel so welcome that it was almost like eating with family.

Overall, I have to give the experience and food 5 full stars.  I am also attempting to remove my original one star review, because I no longer feel it does the restaurant justice.  If you have had a bad experience at Katsuya, it may be in your best interest to give it a second chance, and mention to the hostess that your first experience was not good and you are hoping for better service.  I'm sure they will make note of your request and go out of their way to show you your experience may not be the norm for the restaurant.  Also, maybe stick to the food items that have received gushing remarks of goodness.  They have a new summer menu featuring an appetizer, entre and dessert for $39 a person.  We'll be trying that soon and will let you know if the great experience continues to stand.",jvmB9pym9-VVf-TBOUMGeg,1,1,5,tAyn-0HbBbROyD7cusFFYg

I am also not certain, but the menu has changed for the worse. Yes it is mainly sushi, but the meat entree options are virtually non existent. The LA location has a *much* better menu.

1729391,2015-02-23,10,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"Katsuya has made a name for himself in sushi, but I've been disappointed by the Strip versions of other chefs' restaurants before. I'm happy to say I was delighted by most of the dishes here!

CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA: it's crispy, it's spicy, it's delicious! But with a menu descriptor calling it ""our most flavorful dish"" and ""the one Katsuya is most famous for"", I had higher hopes. This version did not stand out from others I've had elsewhere but it is good.
LOBSTER & TRUFFLE ""CHAWAN-MUSHI"": I'll never know how great this dish is unless I come back. I ordered it, but it never arrived. More on this later, as service is why my rating is not higher.
CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS: with balsamic soy reduction, green onion, and toasted almonds. What the heck?! These sprouts are flipping delicious. Didn't see this coming, but the sauce perfectly complements the roasted veggie, and the onion and almonds add texture. Going to try to replicate this dish at home!
SALMON SASHIMI WITH CAVIAR: fresh, flavorful salmon wrapped with onion chutney, topped with caviar, and placed on a slice of cucumber. The artful presentation was as good as the flavor. Be sure to use the accompanying lemon wedge, as the burst of acidity elevates the flavors.
TIGER ROLL: Only Katsuya can put shrimp tempura, truffle oil, and caviar in my sushi- AND make me like it! I don't even understand how everything works together but it just does. A stand-out roll for sure. 

Starck has made a modern space with traditional, custom accents to perfectly showcase the upscale take on sushi presented here. The service is friendly, but unfortunately I had significant difficulties receiving a dish I ordered. 

TLDR:
The chawanmushi was ordered as an appetizer. Halfway through my entrée, I asked my server to check on it and he admitted he forgot to put it in.  He added it in and assured me it would be here soon. After a considerable wait, it was removed from my bill for the inconvenience, and I was assured it would be out any minute. Bartender was extremely embarrassed and apologized profusely, and I ultimately left over an hour after placing my order- and never received the dish.

I wanted something like porridge or soup so I found this place!
Thinking rice will be better in my stomach than greasy buttery steak.

I had not expectation since I never been or looked at this place before.

We got chicken karaage, lobster roll, sushi rice, wagyu, and salmon roll.

I was looking for some miso soup or something but since I didn't see any I got the lobster roll.
FYI, I don't eay raw fish.

The chicken karaage came out a little late dispite the fact that it's an appetizer.
But luckily the salmon roll came out right away and soon after the lobster roll came.
I did not try the salmon roll but my bf said it was good.
I tried the lobster roll and it was delicious!
I was a bit skeptical since CA calls crawfish as lobster too. But they do use lobster! Just the onems without claws.

The chicken karaage was great!!! By far the best!!
Even though I was sick, I couldn't stop eating it!

But sadly, the wagyu that I was expecting to be great was not so good...
It was too cold... i don't know why but it seemed like it waited out in the open too long before it made it to our table.
The butter on top wasn't even melted and still hard and cold..
I was going to ask them to redo it but I wasn't feeling good to wait for another one to get cooked.
Won't get the wagyu again.

1800381,2016-12-17,2,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"I have been wanting to try Katsura for sometime. It is my daughter's favorite sushi restaurant in Los Angeles, and she has excellent taste. Plus the Yelp reviews for the restaurant here in Vegas were pretty good. So when I saw that they were offering half-price for locals, the deal was too good to pass up.
The restaurant itself is right off the casino in the SLS. And the entrance is completely open to the casino. So there is a significant noise level while you are eating.
The busboy was to our table almost immediately to fill our water glasses. Our server also came by fairly quickly. Because we were first timers, he explained many of the menu items for us. Overall I would rate the service is very good to excellent.
We wanted to try things that would not be readily available at our local sushi restaurant. Based on several of the yelp reviews plus the recommendations of our server, we decided to start with three appetizers. We chose the lobster truffle chawanmushi, Japanese octopus carpaccio, and the crispy rice with spicy tuna. The chawanmushi is a very small cup of what I would describe as a cross between a flan and miso soup. It was interesting, but not great. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was also interesting but nothing special. And the octopus was a real disappointment. For our main courses, we decided to try the double hamachi roll and the mushroom bop. I would say the double hamachi roll was ordinary. Not bad but certainly not outstanding. The one truly outstanding dish that we had was the mushroom bop. This is primarily a rice and mushroom dish that is served in a smoking hot bowl. The rice continues to cook as it sits in the bowl. So when you start the dish the rice is soft. By the time you finish the dish the rice that is touching the bowl is quite crispy. Variety and flavor of the mushrooms in the dish were spectacular. Getting to try this dish made the drive to the Strip worthwhile.
I really wanted to like this restaurant more. To their credit, the service and the presentation of the food were quite good. But you need much more than that to justify the very high prices. The food did not distinguish itself from my local sushi restaurant, which is quite good, to justify the price and the inconvenience of schlepping to the Strip for a sushi dinner.

We started off with our drink orders, everything went well with that. When the drinks arrived we placeded orders for appetizers, some gyoza and a few bowls of miso soup. So then just one bowl of miso soup shows up, we said we needed two more I gave her the benefit of the doubt maybe she mis heard us. By then we went ahead and ordered our entrees. Not sure if they thought we were sharing or going tapas style or family style wbecause they started bringing out plates of our entrees but not all together...keep in mind we have still not recieved the gyoza we ordered for appetizers. Things just kept coming but not all together, it was a mess. Finally the gyoza came out after we were finished with our entrees.

-salmon caviar, bitter and what's the mystery creamy stuff inside?

We expected it to be a cool and busy place because we knew how hip and trendy it was but never the less there was a variant in the crowd which was nice not a ""night club"" turn Resturant with a bunch of annoying  drunk 20 something's and a bad DJ with loud music. 

The Resturant was immediately packed right when the ropes went down but service was never behind. Our waitress Ashley was very nice, super attentive and extremely accommodating. She must have went back to ask the chef if they can revise their tasting menu to suit my needs about 5 times. But every time she did they pleasantly did what I asked and I was very happy. 

My wife and I ordered the tasting menu for me with a Lobster Roll, Tiger Roll, fried chicken Karanga, Tempura veggie (not your typical) love the exotic veggie verity and dessert Sampler. There was only 3 minor mishaps 1. The Fried chicken app didn't come out till almost last and after we asked about it 4 times 2. Lobster roll came out without the lobster tail and head shells like the one served to the people next to us and 3. My wife asked for candles to be put on the dessert (being that it was my bday) and the dessert came out without it. But it did come out from a different server. So our original waitress took care of it right away apologized and was very sincere about it.

But all that didn't matter because everything was so good (except for the Green Tea Cheese cake) I didn't really like it at all. Our waitress and servers were great the whole staff was so friendly and nice and the food and Burning aka ""Spicy"" Mandarine drink was amazing. This is and awesome resturant with great food great staff and great atmosphere. I had an amazing experience and will return again and again. Thank you Katsuya and my wife for a great Birthday.

He was quick to make our cocktails while making conversation with me and my two girlfriends. The cocktail was amazing. It was very light & refreshing. We didnt have to ask but he made some suggestions from the menu that he thought we should try. 

As all five of us were seated at our table, we noticed the table was wobbly. Instead of putting something under it to control the wobble they had to move us which was kind of inconvenient already. Our server was Wombo who was very kind and had good knowledge of the menu. Some of the girls ordered appetizers to start then entrees later. One of the main issues I had was the food not coming out in any specific order and also very slow. The first set of items we ordered came all at different times and even some after our entrees. I did not enjoy my other friends eating their food while I watched and by the time I got my food, they were done. I had Edamame, Creamy Rock Shrimp, Tuna Tataki Roll and Miso marinated Black Cod. All were good. We were sent a round of sparkling wine compliments of Katsuya. Im not sure if that was for all the tables or because everything wasnt going smoothly. One of the Chef's came by to make sure everything was ok. His name is Derek Powers. He invited us back promising to make our experience better. They didnt have dessert menu's but Wombo told us what they had. We ordered the dessert platter with green tea creme brulee, chocolate molten cake and lychee ice cream. The small ice cream cones were presented in a plastic holder with two very tiny holes that did not hold them because the second the runner placed it down while warning us, it fell over. He mentioned its been an issue but it hasnt been fixed. We were suppose to get our cones replaced since they fell on the table and we were only brought one. We mentioned that both fell and came back with two more.

Overall, The food was 4 stars and the service was 3 stars. Our server was great the entire time and very apologetic about all the issues we had.",TvUe4KBLF87f6h0gAG8Jxg,1,1,3,gK5AVlCvhiYQrAsLVRw5QA

2158930,2017-04-20,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"I know I'm being a bit picky here, but the advertising hype and talk of Katsuya being the best place for sushi in Vegas just reminds me that Vegas is in the middle of the desert and not a city for sushi.

The shishito peppers were a bit oily and not quite as snappy as I am used to, although adding a dash of coarse salt helped the flavor. As for the sushi itself, the yellowtail was only decent, but the shrimp and tuna were both excellent. I was definitely disappointed by the fact that the wasabi was the same green horseradish found at almost every other sushi restaurant although with better texture. I know asking for fresh wasabi is a tall order, but my expectations were high coming in.

Quite honestly if it hadn't been hyped so much, I'd be rating Katsuya a 4/5, but whatever happened with the shishito peppers was just a total disappointment. I get better than that in Oklahoma on a regular basis. Maybe that's a touch unfair, but I tend to rate places for what they are rather than comparing high end Japanese dining to a hole in the wall restaurant.

We came for Social Sunday for locals which gives 50% off food and beverages to certain restaurants at the SLS. This week it was Katsuya. FYI - the Omakase Geta, A4 robata and the Toro is not included in this promotion.

Spicy Tuna Crispy rolls: 4 pieces for $16 is a bit pricey for this dish. The maguro used was okay but the rice was too soft, over seasoned. The crispy rice wasn't quite crispy enough. Pass.

Lobster Chawan mushi with truffles: texturally it was nice and silky. Flavorwise, the truffle wasn't really there. (Actually all their truffle dishes didn't taste at all like truffles-I think they used Chinese truffles which look similar but have no flavor) The sauce on top was rather overly salty although the dish did improve after scooping up from the very bottom of the cup. Kinda of a meh dish for me.

Vegetable tempura consisted of about 10 small pieces of mushrooms, asparagus, sweet potato and zucchini. Nothing special except the exorbitant price.

Brussel sprouts, fried with dashi and vinegar were delicious. The crispy texture matched well with the nuts and mildly sweet glaze.  and definitely the best dish of the night.

Kakuni (""stewed pork belly""): sent it back because it was an entirely large piece of pork fat without little to no meat on it. Would not recommend.

Wagyu beef with Foie Gras: served with an overly sweet sauce, the dish lacked balance and could have used a bit more salt. The beef was perfectly cooked though and the foie had a nice sear to it. It was okay but not worth full price.

Tuna Tataki roll: too much sauce, mushier sushi rice caused the roll to break apart easily. The amount of tuna was generous enough though. Meh, don't need to order this again.

Omakase sashimi: the quality of the fish was very good however the serving size was rather small given the price.

Given the level of the cuisine we experienced, it is definitely not worth the full price of admission. There are definitely better sushi restaurants in the city at more reasonable prices too. (3-starred review)",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,3,iOZr-ifLSx3l4RseEsDCLA

Myself and two friends of mine visited Katsuya on our first night staying at the SLS hotel and were so excited to try the decadent menu that only THIS location had to offer. Needless to say, the service was incredibly terrible. Our dishes took an hour to come out, with little to no attention from anyone that worked in the restaurant. The food was cold, the drinks took 15-20 minutes to get... we even watched the server stand at the bar laughing and talking with the bartender while our drinks sat there. So disappointing. 
The icing on the cake: when our server went to cash out our bill, I asked her take the $80 in cash and put the rest on the card I provided. She comes back having charged the card for the full amount ($200), and the cash was gone. I still am waiting for that pending charge to fall off, as she had to run my card again for the amount that should've been charged initially! 
I work in service, I've worked in the retail industry for 15+ years, 5 of them I served at a handful of busy bars/restaurants that required high patience and your full attention.

Got the chef's choice sashimi. Got a few small bites.  Still hungry.  Fish I got was fine, but precious little of it. Fine I get it. This is your best stuff so you're going to be very sparing with it. But it also was presented very carelessly. Came in one small serving. Thought maybe they'd put a little flare in the presentation for $55 a person -- a couple plates brought out in sequence. Some small thing to start. No!  Dropped one plate for me and one for my guest, rushed through the description of what's what and left us to our disappointment. The one she said was halibut (and I asked specifically) didn't seem like halibut to me. But who knows.  No starch anywhere to be found. A little blob of seaweed propping up some of the fish.  You get the fish, pay a fortune per bite, and better be happy with that. Well im not.  

Ordered dessert. Got a bland little tart with a second rate sorbet. Sorbet wasn't smooth--still frozen pretty hard.  Had a bit of rock sugar type stuff on the top, which was  tasteless.  Pretty blah. 

Service wasn't bad. Glasses were kept full. Things were delivered promptly. 

The environment was as mentioned very noisy. I couldn't hear my guest. 

Not going back.  Contemplating what I'm going to eat now that I'm home since I'm still fairly hungry. $170 btw for two people including meager tip (meager %wise because it was a ripoff).

I ordered my food at 6:55pm and most of my good came out within 10 minutes. The food service was extremely fast while maintaining great quality.

My server was really nice and honest. I asked him that I have a certain budget, should I order off regular menu or social hour. He responded with social hour as they only reduce th  price but not the quality of the food. I really appreciated his honesty.

I ended up ordering the nigiri sampler, albacore sashimi with crispy onion, the tuna taki roll, the tuna tataki with crispy onion, and the Sahara roll. Their rolls and nigiri were great (4/5), but their sashimi were amazing (5/5). The sashimi were just so flavourful and fresh.

In retrospective, I woild just order 4 plates of sashimi and one plate of the nigiri sampler.

I'd try this place again during social hour! Not sure how I'd feel paying full price as the menu gets fairly pricey!",jkBOSB5CBB_omGWIHKCIpg,0,0,4,fo46BjLCUm2v638P0ErXzg

Here, they call it ""social hour,"" and there are discounted drinks and small bites. I stuck with several craft beers as well as an assortment of bites.

Being that I am living in a mountain town in the middle of nowhere at the moment, lol, getting good Japanese is not very likely to say the least. So I was looking forward to having some great cuisine.

Katsuya is a very open space, with a large bar in the middle and the casino of the SLS is in plain view. Even that being the case, by the time we got there it was fairly vacant and not at all noisy. We were seated right away, ordered promptly, and within a few minutes our plates started to come in at a good pace

We started with some pan fried pork dumplings, and crispy cauliflower. Both of these were fantastic. Then followed our main course, which was the Fried Rice with A5 Wagyu, the Wagyu Ribeye, and a Sunset roll. Now a lot of places like to advertise wagyu steak, but don't really taste any different then a prime steak. So here I would say is the first time I tried what I imagine is an authentic wagyu steak. 

The ribeye just melted in your mouth and was cut into pieces with a spoon, almost like steak jello but with just enough bite to still eat like steak. That might not be an appetizing way of describing steak, but I can assure you it was delicious. It also came with grilled onion rings that were a nice touch.

The fried rice was excellent, and the wagyu steak that came with it was equally delicious but with a different texture than the ribeye. It was cut into cubes with a seared outside but soft middle. Really good stuff!

The Sunset roll was also great. I am not a big sushi guy myself (my girlfriend is), but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Dessert was delicious, and overall just a great meal. Would definitely come back.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,4,0,5,F6TJuNEAN5UR7bkrZYpFDQ

The service was ok, I have mixed feelings, basically here it is.  In order to enjoy the happy hour you must be in the bar section.  So we request the bar and the rest of the place was empty but the bar was at capacity. The hostess takes us to the actual bar and Byutercup asks me if it ok to sit there as the bartender is asking how old she is.  oops not 21 so not sitting at the sushi bar we go back to the hostess, my friend is about to throw a fit (totally not necessary)  anyway a couple tell me they are getting ready to leave and we can have their table.  I love people.  So we go back to the hostess station I let her know what the couple had said and let her do her job.

I usually come into these Asian-fusion restaurants like Katsuya with some doubt in mind because they have failed to impress me. With a SLS $75 F&B credit to my name, I was intrigued to try Katsuya with my dad because of the high rating on Yelp. 

My pops and I went with the following choices:
the summer 3-course dinner
Corn crunch roll
Lobster Tempura

Corn Crunch Roll (4/5): Garlic-butter sauteed shrimp and avocado, accompanied by corn tempura on top. Absolutely a must-get for people who don't like raw fish sushi rolls. This was full of flavor and a nice of change of pace from the typical shrimp tempura roll at most places. 

Lobster Tempura (4/5): Amazing, lightly battered with a mild-spicy sauce. Lots of meat within the 1/2 lobster.

Summer 3-course dinner (5/5): Easily the best part of the dinner. Choose the mushroom salad as starter, seafood yakisoba noodles as main entree and chocolate cake with tapioca for dessert. I LOVED the mushroom salad and seafood yakisoba noodles. There were many varieties of oriental fresh mushrooms inside the salad, they complemented the greens very well.  Seafood yakisoba noodles consisted  an abundance of shrimp, calamari, scallops and lobster and was seasoned to perfection. 

Service was probably the only negative highlight of the dinner experience. They brought another table's food to us two separate times and were slow to refilling water glasses. Aside from that, I was happy with the food at Katsuya and I can't wait to be back again!",wczP8ehoY_SWCRRLFuSNrg,7,3,4,pynXCe0T_NkgIQgAfqGw3Q

The Brussels sprouts and ceviche were the dishes I remembered most. The mushroom salad also good, but the butter lettuce needed to be cut into smaller pieces.  Whole lettuce leaf and chopstick for a salad makes it difficult to eat.  

The serve was average, even though they were on top of things.  The server had to inquire with another person about at least three items on the menu. 

We ordered numerous amount of drinks: watermelon mojito, kiwi envy, espresso martini, hot sake, jasmine margarita & two IPAs.   If I were to ask which drink had the highest price point, which one would you chose?  

Answer... 12oz IPA = $22 (I ordered two not knowing totaling $44).  I'm a pretty avid drinker if IPA and was also a GM at a bar, so I feel I have a good understand of the average price of IPAs.  But $22 for one beer ... Is more than I would even consider to call pricey.

Would definitely go eat there again but I will start asking for the cost of each alcoholic beverage I order.",DkC05G4w7jsrdCH_BAnlrA,0,0,3,x6vg9NuiJOZLpk_3erZVQw

The reason its not a 5 star review is because the 2 times I was there a weeknight and Saturday early evening dinner they were ""out"" of uni. 

That killed me, since I love it so and in a gunkan, mmmm. But I was able to recover and eat a lot of other great seafood. This past trip was for my parents' 53rd anniversary. We ordered the omakase geta. Their largest sushi platter. All the fishes were awesome, the rolls were great and I really liked the play on their crunchy rice spicy tuna. Being 1/2 Puerto Rican, it make me think of pegao with fish. Great mouth feel and contrast on texture.

2949036,2014-11-21,1,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"My favorite Katsuya location so far! This restaurant has a very nice layout, the dining area in the back is very romantic and intimate, with booth or half booth seatings. At first we were seated at a very uncomfortable table with hard chairs right in the middle of all seatings in the sushi bar dining area, it was unacceptable cause we never sit at hard chairs whenever we dine at Katsuya! I guess it was section manager saw us looking around, asked if we needed anything, we complained, she moved us to a big booth for four in the back corner of the dining area, it was so private and intimate, that's more like it for our favorite sushi dinner date!

We have tried pretty much all the items on the menu in LA, Just when we couldn't decide what to have again this time, we saw Omakase?!!! That's awesome, we LOVE Omakase! I love to see what beautiful creations chef has to offer! Omakase it is! I ordered a refreshing vodka specialty cocktail, hubby had our favorite sake Kikusui, they were light and tasty drinks that are perfect for sushi and sashmi.

When our Omakase came, it was WOW!!! It looked so beautiful, spectacular presentation, with assorted sashimi, nigiri sushi, signature rolls and hand rolls. It also came with signature apps like the new chawanmushi, it's steamed eggs with lobster in mini size, marinated raw octopus cucumber salad, and my favorite spicy tuna on crispy rice. It was a lot of food for two people! I think it could easily feed up to four people! 

Everything was so fresh, probably the freshest among the fresh! We took time to sip on drinks and enjoy this amazing Omakase, it was so romantic and lovely! Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, all the staffs and section managers were very professional, checked up on us now and then, great job! 

I plan to eat here every time we are in Vegas, they open till late on Fridays and Saturdays, this is the only fine dining restaurant that opens till late at SLS. 

Again Katsuya?! You are the BEST! 

Ps. Our server gave us free LIFE nightclub pass, not that we needed it but it was nice of him.
Starck likes to design all whites with popped out colors, it's so beautiful, but can he just let go of the hard chairs, why some of the dining people deserve to sit on uncomfortable hard chairs eating at the same restaurant? It's not fair!",-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,5,4,5,gQf6u8aW60v6gTeB5f-6sw

The staff were all very friendly and they even checked to see if we wanted anything more before happy hour ended, which I appreciated.

First off, The service is really great. They have trained their staff to be very attentive! 

All of the food was very fresh-- I tried the rock shrimp (DELISH!)

And the seared tuna and yellowtail sashimi plates. Both were good but not mind blowing. The yellowtail was great but I didn't love the sauce they put on it- too much lemon. 

I had the tuna tataki roll and added avocado (definitely a good choice)

I got 50% because they were doing a Vegas local special and I'm glad I did because it's pretty pricey.",Xde3UEeqDU281Db-3NAxFA,1,1,4,wgkEJ32H6j4n0bxw_IpQgw

We originally saw a tasting menu for two on travelzoo, but unfortunately we were too late to purchase the deal. So, we called SLS / Katsuya to see if they would honour the deal, and they graciously did!

We went to celebrate my partner's birthday. Right from the check-in, the hostess quickly brought us to our seats and wished my partner happy birthday. Our server, Jennifer, was very friendly, knowledgable, and overall outgoing. The manager, Leslie, was also very friendly and came by our table a few times to introduce herself and make sure we had a pleasant experience. She even wished my partner a happy birthday, which we hadn't expected. We were a bit underdressed but the staff didn't let this affect the level of service we received. Jennifer put a candle on the dessert and also shared very kind birthday wishes. Overall the level of service exceeded our expectations -- we felt quite valued as customers.

The food itself was absolutely amazing. The lobster chowan-mushi was something new to us and was very delicious. Our favourite was the Sahara roll... Never had anything like this! The sashimi was nice and thick. Everything was very fresh. Their drinks were phenomenal as well (I had the watermelon cucumber mojito, and my partner had the -- if we recall correctly -- the burning Mandarin).

My friend from Oregon who I was entertaining was extremely impressed with everything especially the service. She said we have to go back when she comes to town again. Why am I such a fan now?

Omakase sushi-Chef's selection of nigiri and hosomaki.  Total of 13 sushi: tuna, salmon, snapper, yellowtail, albacore, octopus, spicy stuns, and toro.  Very fresh and will fill you up. 

Crispy tuna sushi that came in 4 pieces. I love the crunch of the sushi rice served with a generous amount of tuna. 
 
Seafood Yakisoba- Generous amount of shrimp, scallop, calamari, mussels, and even a lobster claw served with stir fried with garlic cloves, chives, and sprouts in a hot clay pot. The seafood was fresh and had a lot of flavor with the noodles.

Our server, Mario, was A++. 

Now, for the food.... we started off with the crispy rice and spice tuna. it was the perfect 10 in texture and flavor. That will easily be a go-to the next time I'm here.

I had the crispy chicken salad, the California roll, and, the belle of the tasting ball, the Special Katsuya Roll. The flavors were clean, fresh, and delectable.

-Rock shrimp appetizer:  I didn't like this dish.  I normally enjoy fried shrimp but this dish was drenched in sauce which made the shrimp mushy.  The sauce that they were drenched in tasted very heavy and mayo based.
-Crab handroll:  This was probably the worst dish I had at this restaurant.  It was very apparent that the crab they used for the handrolls were the pink imitation crab meat.  I wanted a crab handroll...not a california roll.  
-Uni sushi:  Their uni was very fresh!  I loved this one.
-Yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno:  The fish was fresh!  Also a good one to order.
-Tiger and Double Hamachi roll: NO NO NO!!!!  I think both these rolls were $20 each and both featured as their ""specialty rolls"".  Just trust me and do not order. 
-Crispy rice with spicy tuna:  I've had something similar for half the price at Gyu Kaku.  The spicy tuna lacked in flavor.  I would not order again.
-Halibut usuzukuri:  Flavorful!  I liked this one.

True to form, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($21) is both beautiful and tiny with just enough sauce to enhance the flavor of the fish without overpowering it. The octopus carpaccio ($19), after you dig it out from under the lemon herb relish, is firm and slightly chewy. The spicy albacore sashimi ($19) is excellent, but like the octopus is buried under other ingredients. In contrast, the wagyu sashimi ($18) is accompanied by a minimal amount of other ingredients that let the savoriness of the lightly seared beef shine.

Service was informative and friendly, without the pushiness to order more. Cocktails, including the watermelon cucumber mojito ($15) went down way too fast.

I've been to Katsuya in Glendale, CA three times and hate the place because both the food and service are terrible. I was pleasantly surprised by the food at this location!

I made a reservation for 14 via OpenTable (max party size before menu restrictions), but had it changed to 18 the day of in person without any problems. We actually ended up having 21 people, and were seated in a private room, which was fantastic. We got really lucky getting the private room without having to pay any fees or do any prix-fixe menus, which is usually the requirement.

Since we had such a large party, the birthday boy decided to do omakase for the table to share family-style, so it would be easier. We were served six bowls of Crispy Brussel Sprouts (normally $13 per) and six bowls of Creamy Rock Shrimp ($18). The brussel sprouts were cooked in a balsamic soy reduction with toasted almonds and were sooo bomb. I could eat two bowls of this by myself and be a happy camper.

Then we were served four giant boats with a variety of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Included were these two small cups of steamed egg which were so delicious. Everything else on the boat was okay, as I don't eat a lot of raw fish. We thought there would be more food coming, including hot dishes, but that was it, so that was kind of disappointing. One of us made a birthday cake and the kitchen was kind enough to cut it for us.

I'm not sure how much everything cost as the birthday boy took care of us (thank you!). My friend did see in the menu that it was $75 for two to do omakase, so I can only imagine how expensive it was. I'm estimating it was around $1,500 because a lot of people also ordered cocktails. Katsuya is definitely not cheap!

The service was okay. We only got our water cups refilled once, so for the second half of our meal, I was dying of dehydration. But to be fair, there was another party of 40 in the restaurant and most of the staff was preoccupied with them.",3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg,7,6,4,BuxTrJvRCWaddhuj_wC7xg

This time I ordered the chef's tasting menu which is a five course dinner featuring ""the best of the best signature dishes"" from Chef Katsuya Uechi.  That's a quote from the menu.

Course 1 was an appetizer sampling.  There were four items--creamy rock shrimp, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion.  The spicy albacore was hands down the best of the four but they were all good.

Course 2 was a ceviche of sashimi with yuzu and lime.  Very refreshing, served with a spoon, but I found it difficult to eat with a spoon so I used my chopsticks.  Much easier!  I believe this was meant to be the first course but it didn't matter.  It was small but very tasty.

Course 3 was miso marinated black cod.  The fish was superb.  Soft, moist, and very flavorful.  It was almost impossible to pick up using chopsticks but I managed to do it. 

Course 4 was the sushi course.  There were 5 pieces of nigiri style sushi.  Pretty standard.  Nothing exceptional but good.

Course 5 was dessert and I asked my server about two potential choices from the ones they serve.  He recommended the Yuzu tart and it was perfect.  A very pleasant, light dessert and a super way to finish this meal.

The restaurant was quite busy and alive tonight.  My server, Ken, was spot on with everything he described.  His knowledge of the menu was exactly what I needed in deciding to do the tasting menu or to order à la carte.  He was efficient, polite, and pleasant.

I really like this restaurant and after talking with a young couple next to me, I know have to come back and try some more dishes from the menu--the lobster dynamite being high on my list.

The manager, Jesus Sanchez, happened to be at the host desk when I approached.  He convinced me to try this place and I was not disappointed.  All of the happy hour prices were similar to what a good sushi places charges normally, however, their food is far beyond what normal places offer.  

I started with the Katsura Ceviche which was full of flavorful fish in a light lime dressing.   The manager then sent over the delightful crispy Brussels sprouts which were like mini potato chips in a balsamic soy reduction.  

There were so many interesting choices for rolls but I ended up getting the Corn Crunch Roll.  Garlic butter-sautéed shrimp and avocado rolled with crispy corn tempura and drizzled with sweet soy.  Excellent!!!  

The happy hour wine was only $7....a bargain for this place and very well appointed. I will certainly be back on my next trip.",NzhfiuGQ8z6Dl-lWpQV5qg,0,0,5,47UNNPeKmYKwsVF_BAbXvQ

Also the chef, Daniel, was treating us extremely special and gentle.

Started off with a cold beer and an appetizer of Karaage chicken which was marinated, had a excellent flavor and fried perfectly. For my main entrée I selected the Omagase sushi combination which was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked.  At $38.00 the selection of sushi was generous and fresh.

FOOD & DRINK:
-----------------
Due to SLS's awesome $100 daily dining credit deal (see TIP below for details), I was treated to a most excellent social hour indeed by my big sis Sue K.

We each started out with a **Watermelon Cucumber Mojito $8** minus the simple syrup. Not too sweet, and very refreshing. Perfect way to begin.

When it came time to order, we very nearly overdid it. We thought for these prices in Vegas, we'd need to overestimate food portions. Whoops! 

* Crispy Brussels Sprouts $8 - browned perfectly and dusted with bonito flakes, this ended up being one of my favorite dishes of the night.

* Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño $10 - thinly sliced, very delicious and not even mildly spicy once the peppers were removed (accommodating my spicy allergy).

* Creamy Rock Shrimp $10 - flavorful with a mild kick.

* Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna $10 - amazing blend of texture and taste! 

* ""Karaage"" Japanese Fried Chicken $6 - so well-flavored I didn't even need to use the sauce. 

* Double Hamachi Roll $11 - such a long roll and so much fish! Hamachi both inside and atop the roll.

* Black Sesame Panna Cotta $12 (dessert menu) - good thing we saved room for dessert! Really enjoyed this as the last taste for our very full meal. Nice and light.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
------------------------
The bartenders and manager were excellent. It's wonderfully convenient that they are able to serve their full menu at the bar. Super friendly service from every single person, including the busboy/wait staff. Props!

Located in the relatively new SLS Hotel, the decor is simple yet elegantly modern. Whether you sit at the bar or at a table, the view is pleasant and not extravagant, compared to many other Vegas establishments.

TIP: Through the end of 2016, SLS Hotel offers a $100 daily dining credit if you book your stay there. What a great deal!

DATE TIP: Social Hour is definitely more than date worthy. Stuff your date with amazing food at a smaller dent to your budget.",trUFnQXasV8l2iJSzZKXrg,42,39,4,uEaJ2bMrTmqpI_oTp-3qkw

We started with Salmon Sashimi, Gyoza and the Creamy rock Shrimp, Salmon Sashimi with Caviar followed by Wagyu Fried rice. 

The shrimp was my favourite at Hollywood, but unfortunately there was no love in this. There was no crisp to it and no spice. 
The Gyoza impressed me with the cute edible crunchy case over it.. 
Sashimi with caviar was a refreshing change to the normal sushi Maki. 
Wagyu fried rice has been given great reviews by a lot of people. 
Dont get me wrong, it was nice.. Wagyu is always good.. but I found the overall dish to oily and I was actually quite disapointed. 
My overall experience was ok.. the server was lovely. 
The wine list needs to be looked into.... I know certain wines from New Zealand and they are more than 500% over cost price. I never like this when I see it in menus and you have to pay $60 for a $8 bottle of wine. 
So, finally, my night unfortunately ended up 4am in the bathroom with a tad of food poisoning. Lets say projectile vomiting was not pleasant. But I felt good once all was out. :( 
I have a feeling I must of had a bad shrimp or two.. but who knows, could have been anything on the spread.

I made a reservation because I heard they get busy. It wasn't too busy when we were seated at 6, but they filled up fast. The decor and vibe seems like it is geared toward people in their 20's and 30's. It definitely leans more hip than upscale.

For dinner we had the Japanese Fried Chicken, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll, and Corn Crunch Roll. The Japanese Fried Chicken was the only disappoint. It wasn't bad, but it lacked flavor and didn't really have anything Japanese about it. The Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna is a signature item for a reason. Amazing! The combination of sweet and crispy rice with spicy tuna is so delicious. The Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll again blended spicy tuna with a sweet tempura shrimp and was our favorite roll. The Corn Crunch roll also followed our love of sweet and spicy. The corn tempura with avocado mixed with well a sweet soy sauce. We were definitely happy with the combinations of flavors and tastes of each dish.

We wrapped with the bread pudding which is the signature dessert. The bread pudding was tender, warm, and full of cinnamon flavor. It was topped with a little vanilla ice cream and a shot of Hennessy. We were told to either take the Hennessy as a shot or cover the bread pudding with it.

Nothing good at all to say about the Dine and Dash event, it truly might have been the most UNORGANIZED event I have ever been to, a piss off of a couple hundred bucks for the both of us

Katsuya was the second restaurant venue on our tasting map of the aforementioned event....we just were so fed up with it, we decided to just call it quits there and have dinner at the sushi bar.

It took a few minutes to get the hostess to seat us, but really can't blame her since the host station was in the middle of everyone walking into the bar area for the D&D event

we actually had some nice seats towards the back of the sushi bar
not your traditional sushi bar, but we had a really nice view of the sushi chefs doing a carving presentation of a large tuna for the D&D attendees.

we just decided to go with the Omakase Geta

I'm not sure what our server's name was, he was a young Korean or Japanese kid, but he took our order brought us water.  We had some of the cocktails from the event, so we didn't need additional drinks.
things pretty much went downhill from there

a platter of some type of sushi roll was brought to us by another server, and since we weren't exactly clear as to how the Omakase was to be served, we began to prep our soy with wasabi, and took a bit of pickle ginger too.  About a minute later, our waiter came back and told us that was mistakenly brought to us and our order would be out shortly.  fair enough, mistakes happen, no big deal....BUT then he proceeded to take this dish and gave it straight to the party sitting next to us????? Yes, we did not take any of the rolls yet, but we had bogeyed some of the wasabi and ginger already.  He should have either 1)left the dish for us or 2)taken it back to kitchen to be re-plated or thrown out.  I don't think the group next to us saw what he did, but that does not excuse his action.

Our platter of sashimi and sushi was brought to us about 10 minutes later, and it was a decent looking presentation.  Assorted sushi and sashimi on a wooden serving vessel similar to some of the ""boats"" you see offered at Japanese restaurants.  It was a bit annoying though that again a different server, not our waiter brought this to us, and was not quite certain as to all of the components to our meal.

the sushi itself was nothing special, no real outstanding components to the sashimi either.  I had seen decent reviews of this place so maybe our expectations were too high? although that should never be an excuse for any restaurant....they should all strive to be the best they can be.

in any case, we actually just asked one of the sushi chefs about a few of the different fishes we were served and he was quite a bit more helpful.

I think the only thing that kept the meal enjoyable was my wonderful dining companion.  Always makes for a nicer meal when you have it with a pretty gal!
It was also nice that we enjoyed the drinks offered from the D&D event at the Katsuya bar, since it was only a few steps from our seats, we were able to get a few of the tasty Burning Mandarin's and Katsuya Fresh drinks....like an all you can drink option to our meal!

Our waiter finally showed up after a bit with our bill, I was really contemplating whether he even deserved a tip at all, since other than the removal of the wrong dish, it was the only other time we even saw him during our meal.  I only gave him 15% because he did mention how pretty my gal was when she went to the restroom....I know, pretty shallow, but it was true and was nice of him.
Gave the sushi chef a tip directly too, he deserved it....he actually brought us a small dish of tuna, cheek I believe, really good!

I would give the restaurant maybe 3 stars tops, but the shock of our waiter just moving the mistaken dish to group next to us was a bit much.
not sure we will try this place again, maybe stop by for drinks though, they were pretty tasty!",XnI-AHs6Sf323o913vXObg,5,2,2,32rysY8cwc-Rm5CKegQpHA

Gorgeous decor with 3 different food stations that can be seen from your seat. The staff were attentive,sociable & attractive (good food with a side of eye candy,yes please!). We went earlier because we had a show to go see at a different location & were able to get seated in a booth with a nice view of the restaurant.

You can get a free crispy rice with spicy tuna when you check in & buy 2 full priced cocktails or wine glasses,score. That being said,I had an Eastern raspberry sidecar & a fallen angel cocktail,they were both pleasurable. The martini glasses were rimmed with sugar which complimented the drinks well.

The miso soup was ok but nothing spectacular. The most famous & flavourful dish on the menu is the crispy rice with spicy tuna & it was truly appetizing & had a great texture (4 pcs for 18$ but I got it for free!). The special Katsuya roll was mouthwatering,it consisted of tuna,yellowtail,salmon,scallop,crab & avocado wrapped with rice,soy paper & cucumber served with wasabi ponzu on the side.

The robato hamachi kama was enjoyable but I wish the portion was a little bigger. I always finish my meal with a tamago & just like the miso it was good but didn't blow my mind.

The katsuya premiere cocktails are pricey & the bill reflected that hence the reason the 3.5 stars was given.",1Fz81SDs6kLN6ZiSL0vdmw,2,1,3,cnjCTcxAnL7dS0a23ebXZA

We arrived only a half hour prior to the kitchen close time, but the friendly staff was happy to seat us without any sense of rush. In the course of conversation with our server, we described our disappointing experience at Sake Rok, after which the manager on duty personally offered to comp us a round of drinks simply for choosing their restaurant as an alternative.

That's before we get to the food... yes, it is pricey. But worth every penny, which is not something I often say about high end restaurants. The fish was insanely fresh and delicious, the flavors bold and unique, and the dishes beautifully presented. We had:
-Crispy rice with spicy tuna
-Wagyu beef sashimi 
-Tiger roll
-Double hamachi roll 

All four dishes were recommended by the server (and they were not the highest priced items on the menu by any stretch). Wonderful, friendly service and to die for sushi? You can bet this is now one of our must-go restaurants in Las Vegas.",RcLilYQtI9ON7jaXOb7Lig,0,0,5,dvGEoGT7h019nfpWEW9pwQ

We did not have reservations so we opted to sit at the cocktail bar.  Our bartender/server happened to recognize me from a past job in town and that made it a very personable experience.  We got there right at opening (6 PM) and ordered immediately.  I had iced green tea (apparently the SLS commissions its own tea plantation for exclusive hot and iced teas) and Eric R. had hot green tea and the Katsuya fresh cucumber cocktail.

Some things we ordered we waited over an hour for, and things our neighbor at the bar got we were told the kitchen ran out of even though we ordered them at the same time (like negi toro) so that was frustrating.  We tried a variety of dishes, including the seaweed sunomono, salmon sashimi appetizer with caviar, and the wagyu beef sashimi with hot oil (Nobu's was better).  We sampled yellowtail, salmon, toro, scallop, and mackerel sushi.  The mackerel was served with thin kelp on top of it.

I also tried a salmon skin handroll which had kaiware sprouts, gobo, and cucumber.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the mushroom bop - a hot stone pot like dolsot bimibap with arborio rice, a variety of mushrooms, a hint of parmesan, and a sauce that brought it all together so deliciously.  We finished with the dessert omakase which had mochi, yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and sorbet.  Service was great though we had a rush of food then a very long wait for the rest of the stuff.  With the half off and a few comps for the wait plus the $5 happy hour cocktails, we ended up right below our dining credit allotment so all we paid was tax and tip - sweet local deal and a great birthday present for Eric R.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,3,4,4,93cCQZLnbNsI97DIHMYQ4Q

I haven't lived in L.A. For years now and haven't been to a Katsuya for a very long time. So, when I happened to be in Las Vegas, I was so excited to re-visit ""Katsuya"" again...
Oh boy was that a huge mistake!
The food: My miso soup arrived at a couple degrees, at most, at room temperature. They were kind about replacing it and comp'ing it  from my check but, it was a bit of a reflection of what was to come.
The spicy lobster roll's tempura bits were not hot and too greasy, which makes me think perhaps the oil wasn't hot enough when they cooked it or, it wasn't served when it came out of the kitchen in a timely manner... I don't know. Then my miso black cod was just... Warm. Not hot. The middle part of the fish was so watery and it didn't flake like most of the other miso black cods I've had there. Was it because the fish wasn't fresh? Was it because the kitchen didn't cook it right? Was it because my server didn't bring it out before it cooled? Again, I don't know.

My favourite out of the bunch was the corn tempura -- it tasted so fresh, the corn was so deliciously sweet, and the sauce was nice and tangy. Mushroom Bop is a close second; it is a Korean-inspired dish (think Bibimbap), with the rice crisped up perfectly by the hot stone pot. However, the other 2 dishes are misses -- I usually like those items a lot but these don't even compare to my usual ramen joint, and we are paying a slight premium.

4701569,2014-12-12,1,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"We dined here a couple weeks ago for their #SocialSundays promotion for locals (50% off your bill). There were a couple items that were excluded from the promotion: Omakase Geta, Otoro, Chutoro, and A4 Sukiyaki. I was disappointed since I wanted to order the Omakase Geta, but that didn't stop me.

We were sat next to the sushi bar, so I had a wonderful time watching the sushi chefs expertly craft their beautiful dishes. It was very busy that evening and service was just okay. We were constantly wondering where our server was and our beverages remained empty on a couple occasions.

Naturally, I had high expectations because of the stature of Katsuya and the prices to match. However, I was also anticipating it to be all ""hype,"" but I was pleasantly delighted with our meal. Besides some of the typical flavors you could find at any sushi joint in town, there were great surprises. Overall, the food is delicious and although the high prices may be a deterrent, there are several dishes that I would love to eat again.

Katsuya Ceviche ($18): Assorted sashimi, avocado, red onion, radish, cilantro, edible flowers, yuzu and lime dressing, and served with shrimp chips. This was wonderful. It was fresh like you'd expect from a ceviche and the dressing was fantastic!

Salmon Sashimi with Caviar ($25): Salmon sashimi is rolled around a Japanese onion chutney, topped with caviar, and served on a cucumber crisp. The chutney turned a simple dish into something a little more special. I could have done without the cucumber though; it didn't add anything to the experience.

Wagyu Sashimi ($18): The thinly-sliced wagyu is topped with hot oil, young garlic, and chives. The wagyu was fantastic and the oil/sauce was flavorful.

Wagyu Filet with Foie Gras ($39): Filets of perfectly cooked Wagyu with equal-sized medallions of foie gras, topped with a plum wine reduction. This dish was fantastic. The Wagyu was so, so tender and it was just euphoric with the custard-y foie.

Mushroom Bop ($18): It's a take on Korean Dolsot Bibimbap with a hot pot filled with rice, spinach, and miscellaneous fungi like Truffle, Procini, Enoki, and Shiitake. Now, this is a dish I would never have ordered and I was so pleased with it! The flavors were incredible.

Omakase Geta ($150): Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi, Tako with Cucumber Sunomono, Special Katsuya Roll, Sahara Roll, Baked Crab Hand Roll, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Negi Toro Roll, Assorted Nigiri (Ikura, Uni, Chutoro with Caviar, and Kanpachi), and Assorted Sashimi (Amaebi, Scallop, Otoro, Japanese Red Snapper, Aji, Bluefin Tuna, and Salmon). First, would I recommend ordering the Omakase Geta? Ehh, yes and no. It's a gorgeous, tasty masterpiece that is impossible to capture in one photograph, however, the items offered are rather boring. The exception being the Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi (I recommend ordering a couple of these to start your meal). Everything else was delicious, but nothing I haven't had at other sushi restaurants (I would pass on the Sahara Roll as it tasted exactly like rolls found at AYCE sushi places). Oh, the Baked Crab Hand Roll was a surprise. I didn't think it was going to be much, but it was great!

Dessert Omakase ($8): Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream, Lychee Sorbet, Chocolate Cake, Yuzu Cheesecake, and Matcha Green Tea Creme Brûlée. I really enjoyed the Yuzu Cheesecake (although it was MUCH too small even to share), Lychee Sorbet, and Chocolate Cake.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,2,4,I4TJlsdByPTrD_OKhhMYEQ

If the manager and waitress wouldn't have been so apologetic and kind about what happened, my husband and I were ready to give 2 stars... So, we made an 8PM reservation. Very long week, and we needed a romantic evening out with some amazing food. We showed at 7:40pm and were seated but not at a very romantic table, squished between two other couples, and the music was SO LOUD we could have a conversation across the table. We were literally yelling back and forth to communicate. I get it, SLS is going for an epic club, high class, party all night scene... But does the restaurant need to be louder than the club? I'm 29, so I'm not some old crotchety lady... They took musical ambience to a whole new extreme. 

Jennifer was our waitress, and let me point out that she was TOP NOTCH. This girl is good at her job and our experience was in no way her fault. She was probably the best waitress I've ever had. 

So, we've sat down, Jennifer comes to greet us right away and fill up our water. I order green tea, and 15 min later it comes out luke warm and very flowery. I just wanted some pure HOT green tea. But hey, it's a new experience, so I drank my luke warm flowery beverage. We promptly got the Brussels sprouts, and they were AMAZING. 

Then, 12-15 more minutes for our edamame... And then 20 more minutes for our crispy rice spicy tuna appetizer... And then the biggest wait of all... Over 30 MORE minutes pass after the spicy tuna, waiting for our next salmon/caviar appetizer and yellowtail sushi roll... We can't talk to each other, it's too loud, and my tea is now gone from luke warm to cold... So we give up and ask for our check, we were going to head over to umami burger for the dinner we never received at Katsuya. Jennifer is super apologetic, agreeing it's taken much too long. She assures that the sushi is on it's way, but she's taking it off our bill. The manager comes over and sees if there is anything else she could do and also apologizes. (It was really sweet, but then we became the center of attention... :( ) 

The sushi roll was good but the salmon appetizer was on soapy cucumbers which definitely took away from the freshness of the salmon caviar bite. 

We really appreciate their kindness, apologies, and the personal care after the fact. Jennifer had no control over how the food was coming out of the multiple kitchens, so we don't blame her. 

Am I dying to come back? Not after that, no. We will likely give it another shot in a few months when they've worked out the kinks of having four kitchens. I hope it's a better experience next time... When my husband surprises me with a nice dinner out, it's a letdown when it goes like this. :/",dzGuZ0k2RoEEaaXbZNZviQ,0,0,3,w261taFOHZFSv7ZFo13M8Q

Usually, hubby and I would go to the nearest buffet (our last was at Aria 3 yrs ago) but this visit is buffet-free. So Katsuya here we come. To start, tried the Lobster/truffle ""chawan mushi"" $8 and the brussels sprouts $14 Sooooo gooood worth every bite!!!
Main course was the wagyu beef tobanyaki w wild mushrooms 38 The beef melts in your mouth like buttah!!!
yellowtail sashimi w jalapeno 23 wish there is more serving of this delicious sashimi, crispy rice w spicy salmon 14 first time in my life to try a crispy rice roll. Hubby ordered 2 orders of sake to celebrate the deliciousness.
For just the two of us the total bill is $220 Again it is worth the price. I will not complain for the price, Katsuya exceeded our expectations. I will def, try the happy hour on our next visit.

- Very knowledgeable and friendly chef
- Nice open space
- Nice hum to the place without it being too loud
- The oh-toro was good (as it should be), but it wasn't amazing and oh-toro should be amazing
- The maguro was excellent.  Had a nice bite to it
- The king salmon (farmed) from New Zealand was delicious and I'm not typically a fan of farmed salmon.  Very fatty, meaty flavor
- The hamachi was hamachi.  Awesome buttery goodness!
- The red snapper had more flavor than usual for this fish.  I enjoyed it
- The kampachi had the right texture and also had that buttery/fish flavor mix that I crave
- The engawa (especially the preparation) was delicious.  I love engawa and this was exceptional engawa

Additionally, I always have the chef make me his/her favorite roll.  This chef made some kind of 6 kinds of fish cucumber roll.  It was good, but didn't blow my mind.

The only downer is that there just wasn't much of a fish selection.  The chef said Katsuya used to carry many additional kinds of fish, but no one bought them, so they simplified the menu.  From a business perspective, I get it.  However, it still made me sad.",Z1Ce1N6F7vw9pKnsv8MtRA,0,1,4,c2SRc-_MebolGAHN1Qss9w

Food was not very good. We had one dish that was so bad that we sent back. Had another dish that was horrible and learned that they delivered us someone else's custom dish that had cod instead of crab. Waygu fried rice, one if their signature dishes, was not very good. Lacked depth and flavor. 

Waiter did bring out complimentary desserts due to all of our issues, which was very nice but did not make up for our expensive tasteless dinner.

5094832,2014-12-21,18,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"A ""Japanese"" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the ""green"" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Like many of the Los Angeles offshoots within the SLS Hotel and Casino, Katsuya by Starck arrived to excited opening acclaim when the resort opened its doors just one year ago, and although time as well as legal troubles have led to a bit of negative press the restaurants themselves have continued to show well with trendy crowds and bumping EDM detracting only slightly from cuisine that fares far better than doubters may expect.

Admittedly known to the house, but ordering a la carte and treated to items no different to those served at tables around us, it was at a cozy booth decorated in katana and neon fans that our trio sat, and greeted by Chefs as well as a young server who proved above par for the course a ten-item sampler of signatures as well as a couple more eclectic items were ordered, the results ranging from truly excellent to surprisingly not bad.

No doubt a spot to be seen, the crowd well dressed and attractive with the sort of lighting and ambiance that intentionally screams 'cool,' the meal began with Japanese Beer alongside Sake and progressing to an atypical chawanmushi that saw custard atop black truffle mashed potatoes punched up with lobster there is little doubt the menu's high prices are at least in-part justified by the quality of ingredients, each bite utterly indulgent no matter how far from tradition it did stray.

Requesting the kitchen to roll out items at the Chef's discretion, plates two and three featured Katsuya's signature crab roll alongside rich pork gyoza interconnected by a flaky lattice, and although the former was indeed creamy and supple the crustacean itself seemed a touch muddled by semi-sweet sauce while the golden dumplings were a head-on assault on the senses, the thin shell breaking forth with juicy bekshire pig lent balance by a melange of herbs and spices.

Next offered an iced sashimi box along with a full order of tomago, suffice it to say that with exception of a few mispronunciations from the server everything spoke to quality fish sliced by a skilled hand, and with the half lobster arriving next given a whimsical 'walnut prawn' treatment the lightness of the batter almost seemed impossible, particularly when accounting for the fact that the flesh itself remained sweet, tender, and appropriately cooked just past raw.

Amused by the crunchy corn roll, an item selected almost entirely because it seemed destined to fail yet one that instead offered a complex flavor profile that saw discrepant ingredients each add something to the whole, savories concluded in a large bowl of wafu noodles steaming beneath a poached egg and tender bacon, the soy unfortunately pushing the salinity a bit past 'umami' and into the realm of outright salty, a shame as the noodles and bacon were each prepared quite well.

Unable to settle on just one dessert, the selection of sweets actually quite appealing compared to spots like Nobu or Koi, it was with two items served alongside a double espresso of LAMill over ice that the meal would end, and although the small tart of yuzu pudding on a buttery crust was a refreshing bite brightened by strawberries it simply couldn't compare to a creamy bread pudding given the 'baba au rhum' treatment by way of a pipette of booze, the addition of a honey tuille and rich vanilla ice cream adding complexity of temperature, texture, and taste.

Faring better than similarly branded swank sushi houses with a few standouts and the only real flaws in cuisine a result of too much sauce, Katsuya fulfills its role of offering tourists and club kids a good variety of light bites in a trendy setting while also providing high quality cuisine for more serious diners willing to look past the 'scene.'",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,10,3,8rofvyEPYOhVhwAhseGzSw

The atmosphere and ambience is very cafeteria like as well, and it was freezing In there. Seemed like a half ass effort to bring a hip spot to the SLS.",051AhVL4NGvfQPchCqtoHw,3,1,2,AhKkIHsipLV__A8vpd9nFg
5311235,2018-06-27,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"Went there on a Wed and tried the social hour which was highly touted by fellow yelpers.  The food and environment was good but our whole experience was marred by our server.

Location: in SLS hotel inside the casino areas, easy to find
Ambience: new and contemporary and hip, music not too loud, good vibes, no complaints here.

Food/drinks: watermelon cucumber mojito was not bad, Hamachi kama was wonderful and was more than ""tapas"" size, the nigiri samplers, yellowtail sushi and Hamachi rolls were all descent, no complaints here.

Service: saw only one Asian lady behind the bar who took drink+ food orders.  After bringing our drinks, she never return once to check on us to see how we are doing, during our entire 45 min stay!!  This despite the fact that she walked by us multiple times and even chatted briefly with patrons in the next tables, WTH??  Based on her body language, I suspect she's one of those snobbish Asian ladies who found it beneath her to serve other Asian customers.  Au contraire, other servers who brought us food from the kitchen were pleasant and courteous enough.  

Price: $61 for 2 drinks and 4 ""appetizers"", not exactly cheap but reasonable for anything served inside a Vegas Casino

Conclusion:  social hour at Katsuya would have been a 4 star  experience if it wasn't for our ""inattentive"" server.  Would not return.",CMOZ8rx9ZUOt2L5sv5cGlg,0,0,3,BVNn72Gi9TjjHD_qxGPVmA
5320634,2015-03-24,3,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"I had the pleasure of dining at Katsuya twice during their Social Sundays.  Everything on their menu, except specialty sushi items was 50% off. Needless to say, after experiencing this culinary delight, I will never look at Japanese food the same way again. If you can dine here during this promotion, which I believe they have once or twice a month, then consider yourself blessed by the foodie Gods. Basically, you're getting the fine dining tasting experience --quality vs. quantity-- for a little over the price of mediocre local Japanese restaurants.

Ambiance: Katsuya is located at the end of the strip, inside of the new SLS casino. Bc it is a boutique establishment, restaurants here are  smaller than most on LV Blvd. However, what Katsuya lacks in size, it definitely makes up for in its seductive & intimate ambiance. Katsuya follows the upscale contemporary elegance theme very well. Upon walking into its open floor plan that overlooks the casino, you immediately feel the trendy city vibe right away. Most of its  decor is also more on the minimalistic side. Imagine neutral colors with bold accents, bright sofa pillows & large abstract paintings that make up the walls. The tbls also seat low to the ground w/ various combinations of booth, lounges & stools. The lighting is also not as dimmed as most places. You can definitely take decent pictures and read the menu w/o killing your eyes. Lastly, on a scale of 1-10, I'd rate the noise level a 7. Both times that I went here, the music playing in the background was either house or lounge music. IMO, it was perfect to set the mood. With that said, there is one flaw in its setting that I don't like: Their beverage bar. I've definitely seen bigger and nicer ones even in local places. IMO, Katsuya's bar doesn't have enough seating and it's also hidden on the far right side of the restaurant. Upon walking in, you're most likely to even miss it.

Service: The service here is excellent. However, there are times when the restuarant is so busy that the servers take longer than usual to tend to a tbl. Other than that, the front of house staffs is usually very accommodating. They'll recommend dishes and also explain each one as it is being dropped  

Favorite Dishes:
Crispy Brussels Sprouts - $13 Don't be fooled bc it's a vegetable! This is by far one of my favorite appetizers out there! Brussels sprouts come out in a bowl, deep fried and extremely crispy. It's also drizzled with a balsamic soy reduction that is slightly sweet to the taste and goes very well with the toasted almonds combined inside. Both of these ingredients compliments the slight bitterness of the Brussels sprouts perfectly. Overall, definitely one of those items that once you start eating, you can't stop because it's so addictive!

Mushroom Salad - $12 Mushroom lovers delight! This salad has a substantial amount of Japanese mushroom that I believe is sautéed in butter and some type of yuzu soy. It comes out slightly warm on top of a bed of butter lettuce. The combination of the two, warm and cool, is perfect in your mouth. If you're looking for a lighter appetizer for the palette, I'd recommend this item!

Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - $18 Classic dish! Very beautiful presentation. Rice is squared, crispy but not hard. The tuna is also the perfect texture and amount of spice. Very fresh ingredients!

Wagyu and Foie Gras -$39 Absolutely amazing! If you're not a fan of fatty richness then I don't recommend. Waygu is beyond tender and juicy with a slight sweetness from the wine reduction. When combined with the buttery taste of Foie Gras. it's unbelievable! True to al la carte portions, they only serve 3 pieces in an order. However, it is the perfect amount because this item is extremely heavy on the palate.  Definitely good for sharing.

Wagyu Sliders - $14 Delicious dish. Wagyu has a delicious sweet teriyaki glaze that is served in traditional slider buns. It goes very well with the butter lettuce and creamy aioli sauce. Really wish there was a full size portion of this. It's another one of those items where once you start eating, you simply cannot stop. 

Braised Short Ribs - $31 RECOMMEND Best way to describe this dish is a Japanese version of southern comfort in your mouth. The meat is extremely tender and falls apart immediately when you put your fork through it. Also very generous portion. The wasabi mash potatoes have a pleasant kick to it. Really puts the ""Japanese"" taste to these short ribs. Presentation is also very beautiful. Meat is placed on top of the potato bed..Deep fried sugar glaze vegetable garnishes are also very good. The sweetness perfectly balances the wasabi potatoes' starchiness really well!

Miso Black Cod - $32 Yet another classic! Black cod is broiled perfectly with a deliciously sweet miso glaze. 

Seafood Yakisoba - $37 Very big portion with scallops, lobster, calamari and shrimp. Perfect combo of seafood and garlic chives. Very light as well, not salty at all. Recommend!",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,5,3,5,WlwjbDzpPf3AMG-WXqmcFw

We made reservations on open table for 8pm, when we arrived our table wasn't ready so we had to wait until a little after 8:30, which was slightly annoying but no big deal. I was pleasantly surprised that just about everything on the menu including drinks, was included on the 50% off deal. We had Baked Crab Hand Rolls (twice) which were amazing as always, the Crispy Spicy Tuna is usually my favorite menu item at Katsuya but this time it came out completely cold so that was disappointing. The Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi appetizer was very light. The Lobster Roll was one of the most delicious sushi rolls I have ever tasted, and I consider myself a connoisseur, it had so many incredible flavors. The Corn Crunch Roll also had great flavor, but took a while to come out and tasted like it had been sitting for a while, but it was still decent. Finally the Chocolate Cake with Coconut Ice Cream was pretty good, it could have been a bit more moist and I could have done without the tapioca that didn't add to the dish. All of that plus a glass of Cab and our bill was only $76! Of course we tipped on the pre-discounted amount, but it was still a great deal!

I had been to the Katsuya in Brentwood before, and while all these Japanese restaurants seem the same to me (Katsuya, Nobu, Sushi Samba, Social House, etc.) and are pricey for having such small portions, I keep coming back to them anyway :p  Each restaurant either has some kind of stand-out dish or ambiance nice enough to make me want to come back.  

For Katsuya, the stand-out dish is their Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - it is a MUST!  Other than that, we got items that you usually can't go wrong with and they did not go wrong: Creamy Rock Shrimp, Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Miso-Marinated Black Cod, and mochi for dessert.  Actually, I had never had mochi before so I had nothing to compare theirs to, but it was ok - nothing all that special.  

Service started out pretty good but started to slack off a bit.  For instance, the mochi my sister and I ordered never came out  - I think they had lost the ticket for it or something.  Meanwhile, our friend was done with her meal and dessert long before they finally ended up bringing us our mochi.  Our server though apologized and made up for it by taking it off our bill.  Also a nice touch was the rock shrimp being on the house - I heard the person who brought it out say something about it being a special for locals, and our friend we dined with is a local.  

We got seated at a booth which we requested when I made the reservation.  It was pretty full on the Sunday night we went.  Our reservation was for 8pm, and it stayed busy until closing.  It's a trendy place, and the later crowd seemed to be in their clubbing best :p

Located in the SLS, the restaurant is pretty spacious and carries a very nice ambience. From the host to the servers, everyone was kind and offered great service! They are very accommodating as my boyfriend and I showed up there at 7pm with no reservation. Understanding that we were on a date, the host gave us options to either sit us right away at a loud table in the middle of other tables or wait for a more private area to open up. We opted to wait and they let us sit at a table for the time being, offered us water and gave us the menu to look at as we waited. Very accommodating! 

As for food, they offer plenty of options. From rolls to sashimi and plenty more, the menu seems endless! Our food came out quick and tasted so fresh! The blue crab handrolls are a MUST try.

The bartenders were gossiping most of the time and the one with the short blonde hair that was serving us stood there and watched us eat but did not talk to us. Very strange and uncomfortable.

When we asked for what was super fresh, they recommended the blue fin toro. It delivered - melt in your mouth goodness. It redeemed some of the other items. 

I LOVE yellowtail & anything sashimi so we ordered that off the social hour menu. Both my husband & I had a bad piece. Being regular sushi eaters- THESE THINGS HAPPEN! No biggie and they handled it well. Took away the fish & deducted it from our order. Thank you!

The edamame and shishito peppers were huge portions which was great so delicious we arrived hungry. The rainbow roll was shockingly good- my riceless self deconstructed it and devoured them. Our server recommended the baked crab hand roll which we had high expectations for but it fell short. It was a small portion and just didn't wow. 

Likewise for the tuna sashimi with crispy onion on happy hour. It wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily good- it was edible.

I think it was my err honestly. We've always had amazing sushi in Vegas and have come to expect such- happy hour or not. But here, I think your best bet is to ask the Sushi chefs what's fresh and just order from the full price menu unless you prefer rolls. 
Needless to say lesson learned. I think we'll be back if we stay at SLS or W again but i don't think we'll return for social hour, unless it's just for the peppers and edamame.",9qxZWyZcgYZJqPTvWoWjBg,22,17,4,AIITTzLHRDDxNA4EXQ2TOA
5529410,2014-08-27,31,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of ""Irashaimase!"" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the ""Sahara Cooler"" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit purée, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the ""Wafu Carbonara"" which was simply described as ""slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg"".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,57,41,4,avNyJp5mhcTUhnC40LC8Aw

I personally can't remember the last time I had albacore as dubious as what was served to me here over the weekend, which probably gives you a good idea of how my other sashimi tasted!  I'm not sure if this place is just struggling and saves there's fish way too long, or if the management just isn't running this establishment properly -- Either way, I'll be sure not to overpay for sushi this awful ever again in Vegas. 
Frankly, the best part about this restaurant is the ambiance. The service was ok, and you already know how I feel about the fish... Do yourself a favor and don't waste a journey off the strip to this gift-wrapped gross sushi bar.

A large group of us dined their for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  I am not a huge sushi eater, but there are a few things I know that I enjoy - I chose this place because I knew that everyone else would really love it. Well, as it turns out, I also really enjoyed it.

I can't even tell you all about everything we had - but here were some of the highlights:

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: I've had this before, but it's one of my all-time favorites. So light and fresh.

Crispy Brussel Sprouts: I normally do not like this veggie at all, but holy crap were these amazing!! I have been dreaming about them ever since and can't stop telling everyone how delicious they were.

Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna: Not my favorite, but well done. I was confused as to whether it should be one bite or not - one bite is not a good idea, for future reference. Haha.

Katsuya Ceviche: Also really good. I am not normally a fish fan, but for some reason I love sashimi quality stuff. This was so fresh and the flavors were awesome!

Creamy Rock Shrimp: Another favorite of mine. Creamy and crunchy and spicy all at the same time. Yum.

Cucumber Sunomono: A pleasant surprise. I love cucumbers, and these were tasty.

We had so much food that I honestly don't remember everything we had. Everything is really well done and delicious and we were all so full and happy after dinner!

They make wonderful signature cocktails and have a good list of Japanese beers (and of course sake).  The vibe in the restaurant is young and hip and it's a great place to go before heading out for a night of gambling or clubbing. The service was amazing - fast, friendly and efficient.

Best part - they are currently offering a LIving Social deal - dinner for 2 for $99. Trust me, that's a great deal and you should do it - NOW!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,4,2,5,T30JJG1A1aCKvznizcGrfw

The lobster with house dynamite saucy was good as well, but I'd ask for light sauce.  I would have rather tasted more lobster.  I also enjoyed the yakisoba, they did not skimp on the seafood!

Plus, it's in SLS foodie hotel which i had great experience at Cleo and Bazaar. Must be good right? It was quite ordinary for the price tag. It wasn't bad, but wasn't an amazing sushi experience. 

Rock shrimp - Think of the chinese shrimp walnut with mayo sauce except this mixed in with sriracha sauce. It was okay, but not spectacular for $18. We didn't finish it. 

crispy spicy tuna - Check in Yelp to get it complimentary. The spicy tuna with the fried crispy rice was toasty! I like it!

wagyu ribeye - For $48, we probably had about 6 thin slices? Not bad for the wagyu price, but not high quality wagyu. We requested medium rare which appeared to be med rare, however the steak was dry and the flavor is not there. It was quite forgettable. 

porkbelly skewer - it was good and flaming. 

chef selection $175 - Very instagram photo worthy, but i would rather order my own sushi because we didnt eat the sushi roll. It came with lobster chawanmushi which was a small tea cup size portion (it was delish!), couple rolls, fresh sashimi, and the nigiri was quite enjoyable, but not amazing!

Everything was divine except the spicy tuna rolls - topped with Serrano peppers - were actually not spicy at all.  Strange. 

If you are a champagne / sparkling wine lover, do pair your meal with both the Houhoushu Hana Pink and the Bunny Blueberry.  Served in Sake glasses and do ask your waitress to keep the bottles chilled next to your table.  

If you know Sushi, you know this food is perfection.  

By the way, the dress is quite casual.  We dressed up thinking ""SLS.""  But there were many in there dressed casually and also lots of babies in strollers - which is way cool. We will bring baby next time cuz the walk from the SLS entrance to Katsuya is very short.

5967373,2015-07-17,0,RSOinkOUpxm0mGw1IWr4Xw,"This was one of the restaurants we looked forward on trying on our 6 day stay in Sin city. We got there at 8 PM when we had reservation and the restaurant was not even half full. In a city where popular places need reservation it could be because of the location at the fairly new SLS hotel far down in the north end of the strip close to Stratosphere where theres not that much action. 

Anyway when seated our waitress Jennifer tells me about the 50% of Sake bottles and i say we will think about it.  She comes and takes our order and again tries to sell us on the sake bottles where some bargains could be bottles that normally go for about 250 $ only is 125 $. We kindly decline since i dont like sake at all.  

We order 2 appetizers, another small dish to share and 3 mains. We ask Jennifer if the dishes are big as we had eaten a few hours earlier and she says that ""Its a good start"" and that we can order more afterwards.  

For the food:  

*Wagyu Sliders +2
We where informed by Jennifer that this little baby was cooked through since it was pork inside? Hmm why put pork in a slider with the expensive wagyu beef meat so you would have to cook it dry? What does people who dont eat pork out of religious reasons think about a beef slider that includes pork without it beeing mentioned in the menu? Anyway, the sliders where dry and tasteless and the taste of ginger was all we could find.  

*Sticky rice with spicy  tuna +3
Nice fresh tuna and the rice was ok on this signature dish though we couldnt call it spicy even if we tried. 

*Steamed lobster in broth +3
The lobster was cooked in a proper way and tasted ok but since we are from scandinavia we are used to exceptional seafood and this was more ""ok"".  The broth was tasty. 

*Wagyu Carpaccio +4
This was one of the best dishes where the gorgeous meat was the star. Thinly sliced and with lightly seasoned it was a hit dish.  

*Bass with szechuan sauce +4
By far the best dish of the evening. Superb cooked bass that well in pieces when touched. It had a crispy skin and an amazing szechuan sauce with a tangy nice kick.  Order this and thank me later!   

Our little Jennifer came by a third time to sell us some discount bottle Sake and asked if i really had tried it both hot and cold. I really dont like people who cant take a hint and her pushy ways was part of making this dinner one of the worst of our 6 days in Vegas.  I would rather eat on Fatburger or Dennys where the service is nice and with a smile. 

The price with 4 beers was a hefty 141 $ with tax but without tip.  
While the food was not bad but rather mediocre the price and Jennifer was what brought our experience down. And im not very sensitive to high prices as long as the quality of the  food is the same level. We had a +400 $ tasting menu at Alize a couple of days later that was worth every penny.  

Will not be coming back on my next Vegas vacation.

My husband also ordered the rainbow roll and said that the fish on top was so fresh that he didn't really even have to chew his food. Lol. He ordered the Cucumber Watermelon Mojito, and loved it. He said it was very refreshing, and that the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering. He said it's the kind of drink that the alcohol effects could just sneak up on you.

Our waiter (sorry forgot his name) greeted us immediately and we started the night with his recommendation of a round of the house special cocktails ""Katsuya Fresh"" which was a mixture of lime, vodka, sake and cucumber. It was light and refreshing which paired with our meal perfectly. 

Now onto the food:

Appetizers: 

Corn Tempura: amazing! If you're a corn lover like me you'll love this dish. 

Crispy Brussels Sprouts: I try to be healthy even tho this dish is fried. 

Creamy Rock Shrimp: I've tried this dish both here and Yellowtail and I have to say this definitely beats YTs. It was crisped perfectly and not overly drenched with the mayo sauce. 

Crispy Rice w/Spicy Tuna: this one is a must order out of all the appetizers!!

Yellowtail Sashimi w/Jalapeño: super light and refreshing and it came perfectly right after all the fried apps we just had. 

Main Entrees:

Braised Short Ribs: marinated perfectly and so tender that you can eat with just the fork and if you like wasabi like me you'll love the mash potatoes along with it. 

A4 Wagyu Fried Rice: Wagyu Kobe Beef. No need for further explanation. 

Miso-Marinated Black Cod: mmmmmm my FAVORITE of all!! Amazing flavor and tasted so fresh and flaky. 

Sushi:

Corn Crunch Roll: like I mentioned I love corn and this roll was rolled with the corn tempura along with garlicky shrimp YUM!

Tiger Roll: just like all other ones I've tried at other places but this one took it another notch up by topping it with caviar and truffle oil.

Omakase Sashimi: super delicious and fresh. 

We ended the dinner with a hot steamy bowl of miso soup which was perfect after 3 rounds of cocktails.
