I do not expect nice customer service or great food at fast food restaurants like this location, but it was the worst customer service I have experienced, the food I got looked like a trash or left over food, and the table tops and the floor of the front and the back was dirty. Especially the kitchen floor seemed to have water leaks or an overflow somewhere. Simply the entire place was not really being cared or maintained.
Anyway I always order a same kind of smoothie and chicken wrap every time I go to any TSC location. At this location, I ordered the same things for to go as usual and everything was just fine until I saw the girl who was a cashier went into the kitchen and started making my wrap with unwashed bare hands after touched insanitary things like money. I wanted to ask them to make a new one, but I decided not to because I didn't want to be a ""picky"" customer. She brought me the food and I got into my car and opened the paper wrap to eat the food, but I couldn't even touch it once I saw how messy the food was! Tortilla of my chicken wrap started being unfold as I opened the paper wrap meaning the tortilla was wrapping the ingredients roughly so I could see the ingredients were dumped carelessly and the sauce was overflowing out of tortilla. The worse was that the ingredients looked obviously not fresh at all. I went back to the restaurant and asked the other girl there to refund the money showing how disgusting the wrap was. She went to the kitchen and brought the girl who made the wrap. I asked her again the same, but she said she couldn't because there was no manager acting like the wrap had nothing wrong. Then I just left leaving the wrap next to their POS. It was not worth wasting my time arguing with them.",9HVZObEUgK9dxlK-ux5N7A,0,0,1,LbHDVeXNy09X5_bYX2SHiQ

When I told him I would be calling the corporate office, he just threw his hands in the air. Needless to say they will not be getting any more of my business.

It wasn't even their fault, they were slammed so I just chose the worst possible time to go get my fix.

I've been going to Tropical Smoothie's in the valley for quite some time and I think this one is my favorite so far. Since starting their 24/7 hours, I have always been satisfied with product I receive.

I always get either PEANUT PARADISE or PEACHES N' SILK. Both are very good for a very reasonable price. All of their smoothies are always prepared very well and I have never left this location unhappy with my product. Especially with the Peanut Paradise, sometimes they skimp you on the peanut butter at other locations and the taste is just off. Here, it's just how I am expecting it each and every time. 

They even have delicious wraps that I would highly recommend. If I'm getting a wrap I get the KING CAESAR, TOTALLY TURKEY or the THAI CHICKEN WRAP. All are heeeeelllllllllaa good and are insanely filling.

My first 2 star review...I try to do give an honest and fair review based off of a couple of experiences...I've been to many Tropical Cafe Smoothies...this review is only in reference to this particular location...so each time that I went here, from entering to leaving has been nearly the same experience...I've gone here at different times of the day and each time, inside and outside the area looks pretty dirty. The neon lights weren't even on. You can see with my photo's that I've included...There's not 1 worker there that seems to like working there. Each time, while I'm in line, someone is talking about their personal life problems...In my opinion, it's ok to talk about whatever you want to talk about, when there's no customers around, but when there's customers. It's best to try to be as professional as you can. I get everyone gets a bad day every once in a while...I'm not knocking on the taste of my smoothie...because it's been consistent. I usually just get the Peanut Paradise with Whey protein........my location of preference would be either the one on Blue Diamond or the one on Las Vegas Blvd near the mall and Canes...It's weird how this location has pigeons, reminds me of the Bay Area, where I'm originally from, without that stank ocean smell........This location is in Summerlin... Summerlin I was told is like an upscale neighborhood vs North Las Vegas, Henderson and even Southern Highlands...just 2 stop lights up the street and the complex is completely clean.

The lady who took my order was very rude and short. Before she even took my order she was on the phone in the back and didn't even acknowledge me until about after 6 minutes of waiting at the register. I was asking what all came in a honey ham & swiss wrap and she pointed and said ""everything in the picture!"" That was the rudest service I've ever experienced.

So I just went ahead and ordered the flatbread sandwich, a banana, and a 24oz mango smoothie. The flatbread sandwich was dripping with some kind of weird honey dressing and she only gave me one napkin that was already soaked from the sauce leaking. The banana was beat up and bruised and the smoothie was the thickest drink I've ever had. Literally brick hard! There was no way to possibly consume this smoothie through a straw so I was forced to eat it with a spoon.

Overall, DO NOT EVER EVER EVER visit this location unless you want to or have $10 to throw away on a lunch break. I am upset at myself for that. Tropical Smoothie will never get my money again!",WX1k1QLhG6_kmbK-R2YQiQ,3,0,1,FSWJkukKgVOP0krDqAZwOQ

Unfortunately, the last time I was there WILL BE MY LAST. I bought four wraps and three smoothies for myself and my family. I specifically asked the cashier (Darren) if he could split the transaction between two cards because I knew I did not have enough for the entire transaction in one of my accounts. (The total was $32.99) I asked him to run $31.00 on my first card, and the remaining $1.99 on the second. He looked a bit confused because I do not think he was properly trained in how to handle transactions between two cards. 

He ran my first card, and said it had ""cleared"" at $31.00. When I asked him to run my second card, he said not to worry about it because it had totaled at $31.00 so I did not owe him a remaining balance. I left the store, not thinking much of it. The next day when I checked my bank account, I noticed that Darren had run the entire amount of $32.99 on my one card. Due to this, it caused my account to bounce and I was charged a $35.00 NSF fee. I was upset, but thought that Tropical Smoothie Cafe would take care of it, since it was their mistake. WRONG!

I went back to Tropical Smoothie Cafe and asked to speak to the manager. I spoke to Darren again, who apologized for his mistake and gave me the manager's name and number. (His name is George Aranda by the way) Darren said he hoped that George would be able to issue me a refund for the NSF fee I was charged. When I called George, he got defensive and said he would have to speak to the owner in order to get me a refund. A week after I spoke to George, I texted George a picture of my reciept as well as a print screen of the transaction of my back account, showing that their mistake caused my account to go negative. I have not heard back from him since. 

I called back again, hoping to reach George at the store. I spoke to Nicole, who said she had ""heard"" about the issue that occured with my experience at the store. She said that George sent out an email, telling all employees to no longer accept two-card transactions. Wait...if the reason that I got screwed out of $35 was because your employees are not properly trained to split transactions between two cards, but instead of actually teaching them to do the procedure correctly, you are just going to avoid it altogether? THIS MAKES NO SENSE. 

I have filed a negative report with the Better Business Bureau and have contacted the corporate office twice. I will continue to contact the corporate office until I hear back from someone regarding this issue. 

George and the owner have yet to contact me to make this right. I pray that this location goes out of business because of their terrible customer service. People should not be treated this way.

Instance one: Young brunette girl was way more interested in chatting it up with the other girl in the back then focusing on her orders. You have a line and people waiting, yet somehow discussing snapchat was her main priority. Always a pleasure when someone tells you ""Have a nice day"" with their back turned.

Instance two: New guy overcharges order on free boost sunday. Thats ok, he's learning and he wants to do right by the customer by offering extra boosts to compensate. The problem is that he's clearly having difficulties processing the orders and making smoothies, and the other guy is too pre-occupied being ""fake-busy"" to offer him help. The cashier is new, get off your lazy tail and help him for goodness sake.

After trying the Sunny Day, Kiwi Quencher and Mocha Madness, it seems they're all consistently good.

The menu also includes light foods:  wraps, sliders, sandwiches and salads just to name a few items, and they're open all day.  There are menu items for every meal and even a kids menu!

The restaurants I've been in have all been clean, the service was friendly, and my order was prepared quickly.

The location is dirty and the restrooms are a mess. Would hate to see how the kitchen area is. Guests are ignored at the counter and not greeted when you come in. I have never waited less then 15-20 mins for a smoothie. The food items always seem off. Seems like they don't follow the same recipe that all other tropical smoothies follow.

The food selection here, or I guess at any Tropical Smoothie is sort of guilt-free, tastey, &, conveniently for us, along the way to our hiking spots! 

Because we're here pretty often, I see the same faces working and I know it's early, I KNOW, but we, the customers, are always the ones greeting them good morning. Hm. 

That's not too big of a deal though, what bugs me is that the last two times I ate here my spinach and feta wrap was cold in the middle (first one) and the second time it was still cold at the bottom. We were already headed toward the hike while eating in the car so I couldn't turn around and ask them to make me a new one or finish heating it so it bugged me enough to not want to come here anymore. Not just because MY food was cold, but another friend of mine ordered a spinach and feta wrap as well and HIS was still cold.

But here I am, ready for another hike and this restaurant is conveniently located near us & since it's open so early, we stopped by anyway. Although I'm not giving their spinach and feta wrap another shot, I decided to go for a peanut butter crunch flatbread. I didn't really like this one either, it had peanut butter that was an inch thick, like they took a spoon and slapped it all on there. I didn't finish it and threw it away.

3471661,2018-06-16,0,VP10-f6y0I94fUh1xY2Ruw,"I was here twice within these last two weeks. Let me start by saying that I am a huge Tropical Smoothie fan. Also, this is my first time ever leaving a negative review on something. I will try to be unbiased and fair in this review as I know many people would appreciate seeing a negative review that isn't emotional and angry. 
These last two times I came here, I was serviced by two different people. Didn't get their names. One was a blonde male, the first time. The second time was a brunette female with light eyes. 
My first time, the male, I came up to the register to place my order. He was in the back by himself preparing other orders for people. And nobody was upfront to take my order. Red Rock Casino is an incredibly busy establishment, and having one employee doing all of the orders and cashiering is a huge fault all on its own. I couldn't be mad at him for that, even though I had to wait for 5 minutes. What I can blame him for is: 
A) Not acknowledging me standing there for 5 minutes. Although in the back, he can clearly see who is at the register. 
B) Not saying anything to me, such as ""I'll be with you in just a moment"". He said nothing, didn't look at me, and even acted like I wasn't there. I felt invisible and wondered if I was going to even be able to place an order with him. 

5 minutes later, he comes to the front and doesn't say anything. He just looks at me, and I placed my order. He asked for my name and said it would be out shortly.
That was my first interaction.

Second interaction, this time being the female, it was in the morning on Sunday, June 10th.  I remembered what day this was specifically. I was there with a friend, and I saw the girl getting ready to open for the day and asked her what time they open. She gave me a blank, unfriendly face and told me the time. (It was either 8am or 9am, I just remember being there pretty early). So, I let the establishment open before I place an order. I went up to her register and I got that same blank, unfriendly stare. Didn't even ask what she could get me. Just stared and waited for me to say what I wanted. So, I place my order; she's silent the entire time. At this point I am wondering if her behavior would change if I gave her a small tip. I usually try to tip people who give me bad service and see if their behavior changes. I gave her a $7 tip and she did that blank/mean stare, said nothing and threw it in her tip charge and walked off. I couldn't believe it. In all the times that I have ever gave someone a tip who was giving me bad service, their behavior changed immediately. Not her though. She was the first person who gave me bad service, who did not even bat an eye at the fact that I tipped her. I also asked for a banana as the side to my sandwich. 
When I got my sandwich, (and mind you this AFTER tipping her!) she did not even include my banana.

Unfortunately the other lady there was super slow and didn't start the smoothies of the people who ordered ahead of me when they ordered so they actually got theirs after mine and after their food.  The server who helped me had to get the smoothies started when the people asked about them while the other one just stood there.

Our wrap was not made right! We PAID for a Southwest wrap no chicken but substitute with extra eggs. Now we get home to see chicken in our wrap. First ever problem with Tropical Smoothie at any location ever! Out of all the night we decided to go to this location ugh! I cant express it enough how TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT is on this location! WHO LEAVES ONE EMPLOYEE WORKING BY HIMSELF ON A BUSY FRIDAY NIGHT?! The kid was nice and we felt really bad that he had to be on his own because a LAZY ARROGANT MANAGER decided not to come in to help. I'M SO IRRITATED because Im a pescatarian and don't eat chicken.

They always have new combos and the ability to customize everything for your needs. They have a wide variety of things you can add depending on if you want protein after a workout, energy, fiber, etc. 

I LOVE the health nut and again you get a ton of smoothie for roughly $3-$5. I always went here when I lived here and have never experienced a bad drink or bad experience. Also they have an app that has different specials and their rewards system. I love when places have rewards, especially a bogo free off anything on the menu like the worker informed me had happened yesterday. 

Their food is pretty good and cheap! I usually got a panini with chicken in addition to a smoothie. Loveeeee visiting Trop when I'm here in Vegas!",X7iSWCaekeMT9nW87NH_6w,2,1,5,-Eru5qj7nw6HoeBd8K0zqA

You have to wait too long sometimes at night because they are under staffed. The staff is pretty quick here, but there is only so much one person can do with a store full of customers. They are finally one of the locations that are open 24/7. Now I don't have to drive to Flamingo at night anymore.

They have great smoothies. I usually get the Tropi Colada or the Acai Berry Boost with Splenda. They also have pretty good wraps and sandwiches too. I like the wasabi roast beef sandwich.

For working by herself every time she works (6pm to close), she had a pleasant attitude, great customer service, and made our order right. I've been to this location multiple times before, during the day/morning, and was never greeted, or if I was, it was a greeting like it was my fault that the employees had to work. On top of that, my order was frequently made wrong and when I'm getting a smoothie to take to work, leaving work to have it fixed isn't the easiest thing to do. 

They definitely need to have 2 people working at night, but, scheduling-wise, Tiffany is the best person to handle nights on her own.

I'm a loyal customer of Tropical Smoothie but this particular location has absolutely disappointed me.
I'm a very patient person. I don't mind waiting a little while especially if I see that the place is slammed.
there was only three people ahead of me in line and a total of 6 people just hanging out drinking their smoothies and waiting on sandwiches.
I waited a total of 30 minutes for this man to take my drink order. I get he was busy but apparently he was not busy enough to just stand around and speak to the lady that was ordering ahead of me.
after I ordered he promptly put all the ingredients for my smoothie into a blender and proceeded to blend it. when the blender stopped he ran to the back to do who knows what and I sat there staring at my blended smoothie just sit there for about 5 minutes, when he came back from the back he pressed the blend button again and took some other peoples orders, cool, im here seeing my smoothie just melt there.
he finally goes to the blender and presses the blend button yet ANOTHER time.
I finally get my smoothie after being at this place for 45 minutes.
I get into my car RUSHING as my lunch break is an hour long. I take a sip of my smoothie and it is absolutely DISGUSTING! seriously, I ordered a sunrise sunset and got what tasted like pink blended water and ice.
it was way too late to go back and ask them to remake it. I truly did not have another hour to waste.
Highly disappointed. highly recommend you to stay away from this place. might as well starve during lunch instead of trying to get a smoothie.",ahBmKmdU3t9YoypPuQPRcQ,0,0,1,i9AnAKZ2rerkvHKAB9AH4g

I placed an order from UberEats since they popped up on my ""30 mins and under"" category. However, it literally took them 1.5 hours to fulfill my order. My Uber delivery driver literally waited there for 45 mins, along with other drivers and customers.

Come to find out, the manager/owner decided that it's a smart idea to leave his first-day-on-the-job employee handling the store by herself.  It's definitely neither her nor my delivery driver's fault. It was the manager/owner's lack of care and business sense.

To make the whole experience worst, my order was wrong and tasted horrific. I did not receive the chips I ordered and the sandwich came with almost no grilled chicken at all.

I've always had issues with this location. They either mess up the order or the restaurant just plain dirty or there's literally 1 employee handling the whole store.

I love Tropical Smoothie. If you make the right choices you can get a very healthy meal or treat here.
