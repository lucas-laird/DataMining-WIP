Croissant: crisp and buttery, but not the best I've had.  It might have been better if I'd had it earlier in the day.

Pain au chocolat: Again good, but not the best.  The chocolate had never fully melted and the croissant was on the dry side.

Pain epi with butter and cherry preserves: A great deal at $1.75.  Pretty crusty, but in a way that I like.  I'm not sure what kind of butter it was, but it was very good, as were the cherry preserves.  This was my favorite item.

Lemon Macaron: I have only had macarons a couple of times, and I'm not sure I'm a fan, so I don't think I'm the best judge of this.  The texture was light and crisp on the outside, then chewy, then gooey in the middle.  I think it's the goo I don't like.  

I've had some very good pastries, so I judge pretty harshly.  If you are visiting from an area that doesn't have as many options, I would highly recommend checking this out.    These are made right, and this is probably among the top 5 bakeries I have been to.

We were surprised when we saw the coffee mug given to us. One of the coffee cup had disturbing Racist comments written over it.  We were shocked but did not wanted to argue with the servers.
We went directly to the hotel concierge and the manager was called. They were shocked to read it too. The hotel security was called and a complaint was filed against the bakery staff. 
We were told that the matter would be investigated and someone from the bakery will contact us within 24 hours. We were there for 4 days and never ever heard back anything. Our whole vacation was spoiled because of this disturbing experience.
After about 3 weeks when I called the bakery manager she admitted that she was aware of the situation and started making stories that it was the customer's fault.
When I told her that I was the customer, she completely flipped and said ,""oh let me investigate and call you back."" Since then I have never ever heard anything from them.

My friends and I would take advantage of most opportunities to sample the macarons that any cafe had to offer. When I moved back, macarons became scarce and my craving was left unfulfilled. Cue the search on Yelp which led me to Bouchon and other patisseries on the Strip.

Most people get lost trying to find this hidden nook of baked goods, so remember that it's located underneath a set of escalators near a candy store. Also note that the bakery is separate from the restaurant. You'll also need to find another place to enjoy your treats since there's no seating area.

Along with their baked goods, Bouchon also offers sandwiches, salads and coffee. I opted for the raspberry and pistachio macarons. They both had strong distinct flavors, but the filling was too sweet for my liking. While I understand the difficulty of making macarons and that they're on the Strip, $3.50 for a macaron is pretty expensive despite how big they are. Their red velvet cupcake was moist and had more than enough icing on it.

There's no doubt that their pastries are of good quality, but I was left underwhelmed by their selection and some of their prices.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,4,1,3,gdEnopnT3BUtokwvLWRF5g

They had a nice crunchy exterior, soft interior, and creamy filling. Imagine a brownie as a cookie with a fudge filling...that's pretty much what the chocolate macarons were like here. Something else that caught my eye were these huge oreo looking things (Thomas Keller's version of the oreo).

A trip to Las Vegas isn't complete without several trips to Bouchon Bakery. I stayed at the Venetian Hotel and Casino for one major reason. Thomas freaking Keller! Whether I was dining at Bouchon Bistro or snacking on treats from Bouchon Bakery, I followed Keller like a fly on a horse's butt! First trip consisted of one of there famous macaroons which I didn't see what the fuss was. I got the vanilla flavor but maybe they only taste good when they first bring them down because mine was a little on the stale side. While the vanilla cream inside was good the stale outside just ruined it. 

Second trip was a little more successful. I ended with the famous Thomas Keller's version of a Nutter Butter and a freshly baked Chocolate Donut with a custard filling. The Nutter Butter was good, much better than the cookie, with a peanut butter cookie on the outside and delicious peanut butter on the inside making it a perfect little treat! Move over Dunkin Donuts because I run on Thomas Keller's Donuts. Perfectly shaped donut with a wonderful custard feeling with chocolate icing and chocolate sprinkles on top. MMMMMM Donut was the only thing that kept popping in my head while eating it! If I had a Bouchon Bakery near me I would be the size of a whale. 

Third trip was my favorite. I got the Carrot Cake Cookie. It tasted so fresh and moist and looks just like that big cookie in the movie ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" that the ants were eating on. Hopefully ya'll know what I'm talking about. Just like the ants I couldn't get enough. It had that nice little spice that carrot cake has with a wonderful cream inside that reminded me of the cream in those oatmeal cookies I got growing up in my school lunches. Just a perfect cookie!

Last and final trip, a tear slowly ran down my eyes while I made my final purchase, was Red Velvet Cupcake with a Citrus Frosting. While cheesecake is my favorite desert, red velvet is my second and this cupcake is the reason why. I got it as soon as they came down from baking, it was perfectly moist with a wonderfully rich cream cheese feeling inside a nice citrus frosting on top with a cute little smiley face made of chocolate chips reminding me it was Halloween. It was very rich but very good!

338725,2009-10-22,0,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"I'm actually rounding up - in reality, I'd only give it 2.5 stars.  However, I award stars relative to what I expect of a particular establishment, based on it's sister restaurants, press, chef, and overall reputation.

Being the baby sister to the high-end, über-famous French Laundry under the keen eye of masterful chef Thomas Keller, one should expect a modicum of basic service standards in a restaurant with such a pedigree.

However, the food and service were disappointingly mediocre at best.  Aside from the incredible pastries and outdoor ambiance, this restaurant leaves nothing to be desired.

For those of you unfamiliar with the ridiculous parking-garage, elevator-changing, treasure-hunt required to find the restaurant, prepare yourselves.

Once you have finally made your way to the entrance, it is likely you will be graciously greeted by a host/manager, then asked to wait (reservations are not allowed for breakfast/brunch).  My average wait time on a weekend has been pretty close to the quoted time, which is definitely a plus on their behalf.

However, once seated (even with empty tables all around) we were promptly greeted with water service, but then waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to offer other beverages.  Even after the beverage order, drinks were painfully slow to arrive - the waiter actually made it back to our table to take our food order before bringing our drinks.

Let me reiterate that the food here is delicious, without debate.  However, I wasn't prepared to spend the entire afternoon here, regardless of the beautiful weather and our outside seating.  It took over 45 minutes for 4 brunch items, one of which was a fruit plate, and none of which required pre-ordering or long cooking times (ie. well done meats or souffles).

During our wait, we had to ask for everything we needed, except for water refills & the bussers were very attentive.  However, the server had to constantly be flagged down or requested through the busser, as he stood idly around the corner completely oblivious to what was happening at our table.  He ignored the need for:  rounds of cocktails, missing silverware/linens, plates for sharing (after being asked twice), and our second food order (of which we had also made mention).

For such a highly regarded restaurant and world-renown chef, it would seem likely that with all of the out-of-work professional waiters vying for a job, that Thomas Keller would be able to hire someone slightly more competent.

As a local, food quality is important, but so is value - especially if I am expected to trek to the strip and brave the crowds of tourists and labyrinth parking garage.  Value for me includes service.  Perhaps we would have had a better experience with any other server, but this particular experience really tainted my ability to give an otherwise above average restaurant more than 2.5 stars.",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,0,0,3,BAbbP5wuZLO9CLp0okXrYA

Thomas Keller pretty much gets a free pass on GP, but Bouchon Bakery is nice because for not much more than the price of your hotel starbucks, you get decadent baked goods that are worth waiting at least 4-6 minutes in line for. 

I'm not certain you can go wrong with any of the baked goods here unless you are super picky about your preferences on the way certain baked goods are prepared, or if you are just being troublesome for the sake of having a more cultured palate than everyone in your circle. 

I find it a little humorous that you can buy pain epi that are complimentary at Bouchon proper. If you've eaten these, you may have a sardonic grin on your face right about now. I've contemplated purchasing these a la carte before. I've also stuffed my face with about a dozen of these at the bistro.

My only qualms are with the line, which at peak times can be ridiculous, the servers, who can be inattentive or somewhat forgetful when it comes to your order or requests that accompany your order, and that not all items are available year round, especially some of the fruit preserves, and without a website, or public forum to announce availability, sometimes you just need to call beforehand to see if they have something you are looking for. Also, they run out of things, which is a given considering it's not a huge location. They are a little counter tucked under a stairwell.

But certainly add this place to your list of early morning haunts. I'd rank it above Payard, below Jean Philippe Patisserie. So it's good.

And make sure you buy a bag of bouchons (6 for $10) to go and don't forget to ask for a little bit of raspberry sauce on the side. Heat those puppies up in the oven for a few minutes, pour some of the raspberry sauce on top, make obscene noises while consuming.",VxUuMNnCqgA8zK4F0TYHMg,1,1,4,pJcTBAp2SdD3rbpX6mSbNw

My latest visit came after a one-month, self-imposed sugar ban.  And, because I love these trendy little cakes so much, I chose to break my fast on a Bouchon chocolate cupcake!

The basis for my obsession is that the frosting will not put you into a diabetic coma.  The sweetness is doable. Further, the chocolate frosting tastes more like a mousse, less like a birthday cake.   If I wanted a cupcake that tastes like birthday cake, I'll make it myself (and you do not want to see me bake...scary).

And, at $3.50, these are a pretty good deal -- smaller, less delicious cupcakes in Las Vegas can be had for $2.50.  The selection, however, is limited--I've only ever seen chocolate and red velvet.  Both are good.

Bouchon Bakery is a great way to experience Thomas Keller without dropping a few hundred at his restaurant upstairs.  I do wish they'd serve up some tables though! What is up with that!?! Come on!",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,2,2,4,Xj1wL-ayzNAxoumZ4Opf0Q

When we got to the Venetian there was a Bouchon bakery right at the entrance after the walkway but it was tiny. I thought it was bigger when I saw it online so we looked at the map and saw there were three locations around the hotel. We decided to try a different one on another floor and when we got to that one it was pretty small but slightly bigger than the first one we saw and had a crazy long line. We jumped in line and when the lady took our order she was incredibly rude. You then get some of your food unless you are getting something heated up at which point you have to go wait in another line where everyone is waiting for coffee at this tiny little window area on the side. I probably stood a good 10 minutes waiting for my food to be heated up dodging people picking up their coffee. There are no tables nearby to eat at so we headed up to the food court to eat. 

Overall there was a small selection of food, no blended drinks (I can't stand drinking hot coffee in hot weather) or even iced drinks. The food was mediocre and not really worth the hassle.

Saturday was our shopping day, so we most definitely pounded the pavement for a good few hours. After Payard, we did some browsing, and some of the ladies went shopping. A few hours later, my friend Izzy and I were separated from the group when we were heading towards the Venetian. The reason for that was some dude pulled us aside trying to offer us wrist bands to get into clubs, and all he asked for was a tip. Since we didn't live in Las Vegas, we weren't sure if this dude was legitimate, so we walked away from it. We were trying to look for the rest of the girls, but then decided that we should meet near the canal shops where the gondolas were passing (instead of Bouchon Bakery). 

So Izzy was leading the way over to the bakery. After walking a good 5 minutes from the entrance, we arrived. Bouchon Bakery can be easily passed by because it is under an escalator, across from the Bouchon restaurant. I came to the bakery solely because of the macarons, which Izzy said were pretty good. So I bought one of each flavor and there were seven of them. They were $3.50 each and totaled to $24.50. The price of those bad boys were steep, but I forked over the money just so I could taste them. I ate the chocolate one and the cinnamon one, and they were both delicious. I shared the rest of the macarons with the rest of the girls when we met up at the canal shops, and they thoroughly enjoyed them. One of the girls, Nicole, felt bad that I spent that much on the macarons that she didn't want to eat anymore. I insisted that everyone have the rest because these macarons are sweet, and I already had my intake of sugar for the day. Because of the macarons, it prompted a few of the girls to buy some as well from the bakery. 

Overall, the service at the bakery was excellent, and the macarons were delicious. I popped my macaron cherry. lol..... But the cost of them I wasn't so fond of. I know there has to be a few patisseries in San Diego that make macarons!",JAWpwyfRiRjgr0PDUrm00Q,0,1,4,xfQaPwnL3Y7dhmKg2_ZL7Q

So-so with the s'more cheesecake. The textures were off, in my opinion. The chocolate was chunky and hard, would've been much better smooth like the cream filling. The marshmallow was difficult to eat. And the butter in the graham cracker crust overpowered the other flavors.

Got 2 pistachio (because I read how fabulous they are), 1 chocolate, 1 raspberry, 1 espresso, and 1 vanilla bean. Pistachio was definitely our favorite. But they were all really really good. All of them had a light, fluffiness about them w/ that perfectly delicate outside. I loved that they were nice and puffy and none of them were too sweet. If I had to pick, vanilla was probably our least favorite, but that's only if someone made me pick. I was a bit sad when a couple of them broke because the box wasn't full and they were rolling around in the car (still in the box of course), but they were still yum.

Their huge slider-sized macarons caught my eye when I first walked past and I knew immediately I had to come give them a try. Oh, and these babies? The Queen bees of macarons as their gargantuan bodies stood out amongst the vast array of smaller, more delicate confectioneries and other irresistible French baked goods on display. 

I purchased their Pistachio, Vanilla and Chocolate macarons and, not surprisingly, Pistachio was my favorite - I've been completely smitten ever since!   Quite possibly the best Pistachio macarons I've ever had. The cookie shell was perfectly crisp, yet easily giving way to the pillowy soft goodness within as you take bite after delicate bite - sigh, Heaven. The prices were great too at $3.50/each.

Chocoloate Bouchon...Imagine the best brownie you ever ate, but more moist and less dense; then add some semi sweet chocolate chips in the middle, dust it off with some confectioner's sugar and you have a chocolate Bouchon. They clearly used a very high quality dark chocolate, could be a Valrhona 60%+ dark baking chocolate. Who knows? But I do know that I will be buying more of these bit sized treats.

3. Almond Brioche...The edges have a slightly stale and burnt taste to them. While some may prefer this texture and flavor combination, I did not. After discarding the edges, I was left with an amazing piece of soft and moist brioche bread with a wonderful almond paste and sliced almonds. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Service: poor, sloppy, rude. My latte came out too hot and I could taste the burnt milk (I used to be a barista so I know they steamed it way over 140 degrees). When I asked them to redo it, the guy rolled his eyes, didn't acknowledge me and handed it back to the barista. No apologies that my overly expensive $6 latte tasted shitty.

Came here for the first time during a vegas super bowl get-a-way! One of my besties (Rosie) and her bf brought some back for me a few years ago, but I never got to try them fresh. The bf and I got a nutter butter, 6 French macarons, and a chocolate dipped raspberry macaron. I thought the macarons were pretty subpar. The NUTTER BUTTER was our favorite thing! It was gigantic and super delicious ! I also really enjoyed the chocolate dipped macaron minus the fact that it tasted like hazelnut when it was supposed to be raspberry, but I'm not complaining I love hazelnut. I thought the texture of the macarons were a bit too chewy. The weird thing though, the macarons tasted better the next day! Instead of becoming stale, they were of beter consistency of a macaron lol. Yum.

This Bouchon Bakery is located at the Venetian Hotel, right underneath an escalator. In reality, this is not really a bakery but more of a small stand that sells Bouchon pastries. It's no bigger than a Starbucks you'd find inside a grocery store. Even though it's small they still have a good amount of baked goods. They have things like macarons, cookies, breads, sandwiches, pain au chocolat, muffins, bread pudding and more. They also sell coffees and other drinks.

He said his favorites were coffee or pistachio so I got a coffee macaron and a madeleine.  I've bought a little bag of madeleines at Jean Philippe Patisserie before and they were very dry and awful.  I was very disappointed with them but Bouchon's madeleine was moist and good as it should be.

My sister said there is this bakery shop near her work which sells macarons and they were so good, she always thought to bring some for me but they were so delicate, she never did.

Bouchon Bakery had a really good espresso blend that is custom blended by Illy for them.  Their lattes really hit the spot in a city where it seems alcohol is consumed in larger quantities than water.  I couldn't wait to get up and hit this bakery almost every morning during our stay here.  Once I was even asked by the cashier if I worked at the hotel because she had been seeing me around a lot. 

Their selection was all so drool-inducing but could easily leave a large gaping hole in your pocket.  Not to worry, the sticker shock will leave you momentarily in a daze until you realize yes, you are on vacation and YES...it is WORTH IT.  Their buttery, flaky croissants are excellent with jam on the side. Not to mention their red velvet cupcakes that were really moist and topped with soft sweet delicious frosting.  They definitely have all the red velvet cupcakes sold in my hometown BEAT.  These things are so popular they do sell out, so be sure to make your way here early enough in the day.

My only regret is not going more often and trying out the macaroons but I am sure I will be back on my next trip to sin city.  Do you ship??? :)",-UsOWfiz6IVAhZzWhzhT9w,1,1,5,_UVH4Ast9hPT0UqSchSF1A
1741324,2011-01-23,13,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"I've been to the Bouchon restaurants in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas.  Both experiences were okay but nothing particularly exceptional.  I've read a lot of good things about the Bouchon Bakery though so I was still eager to give it a try.

Bouchon Bakery is conveniently located near the guest elevators on the casino floor.  The bakery is a simple open storefront.  They have glass display counters showcasing the many attractive pastries and desserts while coffee is made/assembled in the background.  I went three times and it was busy on each visit; still, lines moved quickly each time because service was organized.

I had a good sampling of their offerings and most of what I had was good.  Here is the rundown.

(Pain Au Raisin) This was nice croissant dough that was mixed with golden and dark raisins.  The pastry was good.  It had a good crispness on the outside, but it still had a nice flakiness and softness at the center.  It was nicely sweet but not overpowering.  The raisins were plump and flavorful--too often raisins are overly shriveled in these types of pastries.

(Chocolate Bouchon) This was a chocolate brownie shaped like a wine cork.  The bouchon I had was dusted with powdered sugar.  It also had a little bit of fudgy chocolate ganache in the center, which may not have been the intention (a later bouchon I had seemed to lack this fudge).  The brownie was good.  Good, rich chocolate flavor and the appropriate texture of a brownie.

I have noticed that a lot of bakeries will alter the brownie recipe to create a moister brownie with a longer shelf life, which results in a fudgy brownie that is not really a brownie.  I like how the brownie here was baked as it should have been.  Because of that, the Bouchon here may not have been the moistest brownie, but it was still satisfying and thankfully still a brownie.

(Macarons) I had three here--caramel, vanilla and coffee.  All the flavors were good, but if I had to pick, I would probably say the caramel was the best.  Good and smooth cream centers that were flavorful.  The macarons' outside shells had a light crispness while the inside was soft and chewy.  The macarons here were larger than most macarons I've had (priced higher too at a little over $3 a piece).

(Chocolate Croissant) This (or maybe the apple croissant) was probably my least favorite thing here and it may have a lot to do with how I am not the biggest fan of chocolate croissants.  I think part of it has to do with how I don't like how big and soft they tend to be.

The croissant was light, crispy and flaky.  The croissant featured a thick and generous chocolate bar at the center.  The croissant was fine though it was very similar to the other good chocolate croissants I've had (and it did not really stand out).

(Apple Croissant) This pastry was not your typical apple pastry.  The bottom was a flat puff pastry base.  It was topped with apples and then a slightly crunchy and sweet cinnamon streusel-like topping (similar to a Dutch apple pie).

It tasted fine, but it was not as good as other apple pastries I've had.  The pastry base was a little firm and thick.  It lacked the light crispness and flakiness of a good croissant.  The apple flavor was not as prominent as I would have liked, which was mainly due to the generous portion of the cinnamon streusel (kind of overwhelmed the apple flavor).

Service was good and pleasant on all of my visits.

Pricing was about what you would expect with most of the options in the $3-$4 range.  I would imagine that most bakeries/pastry shops in Las Vegas (even bad ones) would be charging similar prices.  The quality at Bouchon Bakery was high and because the prices were reasonable enough, this one might be worth the extra walk or the extra casino hop if you get a hankering for a good pastry during your stay.

The Venetian offers complimentary valet parking.  Like other major casinos, I imagine they would have complimentary self-parking as well.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,18,17,4,_VWG7UosJGkVtGUQi6SRdg

The pain was surprisingly light and flaky, not too buttery although I'm sure it's layered with butter.  The latte was good but  I recommend 2 shots to balance out the milk.  You also must try the fresh squeezed OJ. Unfortunately, it comes in large size only but I finished most of it, it was that good.  For these 3 things, my tab was around $18, I think.  It's pricey but everything is jacked up on the strip.
I recommend the croissants, plain or chocolate.  I'm not a fan of the strawberry croissant.  It was mushy and too sweet (basically croissant topped with strawberry jam and dusting of powdered sugar).  I will not be ordering that again.

Bouchon Bakery is in the Venetian right underneath the escalator (if coming from self parking) next to the Apothecary. They close early sometimes depending on how busy they are. The 1st time I tried to go here they were shutting down at 10pm to my dismay.

The macaroons here are HUGE and the price tag is $3.59 a piece. I got the seven pack for (I'm embarrassed to say) $17.29 and a cappuchino to boot. My mama opted for their chai tea and the apple fritter croissant with almond creme. That croissant was delish and even though I'm not a huge croissant fan (after you've made them once its hard to eat that much butter knowingly) I snuck a bite or two of this. 

I haven't made it all the way through my box yet but so far the chocolate has been the best. The texture of the macaroons is right on point!

1812994,2013-01-21,21,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"After walking up and down the Vegas strip all day, I wanted a light sweet snack. At Bouchon Bakery (which recently opened a second spot also in The Venetian, next to the Venetian Sports Book), it's about the macarons, those light meringue confections that can be one of a zillion different colors.

Here, they also have chocolate-coated macarons. Haven't had that one before, so I ordered the raspberry one ($4.50). Perfectly executed. Extremely light, with a thin chocolate coat. The hint of raspberry flavor goes well with the chocolate.

I also got the Apple Croissant ($3.75), a butter croissant with thinly sliced apples and baked almond cream filling, topped with almond streusel. Huge thumbs up here. Velvety filling, flaky pastry. Not too sweet. Basically, it just kicks ass -- and I got way more bang for my buck here than with the macaron.

Frankly, the price is really the only thing that would prevent me from just dashing right back and ordering one of everything in the display case. A fine example of how one must pay for quality. Plus, it's located on the Strip, so it'll automatically be hella expensive.

The person at the counter tried to sell me on getting some cookies as well. Not this time, but who knows. I could end up getting a cookie bender in Vegas one day.

I wish they had more flavors.  They have a total of six flavors: vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, raspberry, coffee and caramel.  My favorite flavors were vanilla and raspberry.  The chocolate and coffee macarons were too rich for me.    Pistachio and caramel were descent.

Iced Mocha - rich with quality cocoa powder. The best mocha I've ever tasted. Has notes of coconut from the rich cocoa powder. Get it! 

Macarons - best macarons IMO. They are big too. No hollow shell like some places. Perfectly soft with the nice macaron shell crust. Not chew like some places, although I'm not against the chewy type macarons. These macarons melt in your mouth.

Cupcakes - I saw a giant cupcake for $3.25. They are in between the jumbo muffin and regular sized muffin cups. I've never tried any of their cupcakes, but they look really good. $3.25 for a cupcake is a steal these days considering Sprinkles at the Linq charges somewhere around $4 I think.

Better Nutter cookie - GET IT. Even if you don't like peanut butter. This is like a peanut butter lover's dream come true. My mom isn't fond of peanut butter but she is absolutely obsessed with this. The cookie has bits of peanuts in it as well as peanut butter I believe, the cream filling is a peanut butter italian meringue buttercream. OMG, it's soooooo good.

TKO cookie - chocolate butter cookie with white chocolate ganache filling.  Meh, it was okay. I wish the filling had some vanilla flavor, but it was really just cocoa butter flavor and cream. I think vanilla would've helped the flavor shine a bit more. The cookie is also really soft. It was hard to break pieces off. But hey, that means you don't have to share. The chocolate cookie itself was good and not sweet. It balanced the sweetness of the filling nicely.

Bread - it's their standard baguette they serve at dinner in their restaurant. They toast it up for you if you want and ask you if you want jam or cream cheese. The bread does get hard after it cools down, so better eat it while it's warm. Nice crust and chewy. Great aroma.

Americano - the first place I've ordered an americano that tastes creamy without anything but espresso + water. I don't know how they managed to do that. If you need a dairy-free option, get the Americano.",cxcp1WYR9wvJtBFfzbelVw,3,1,5,q2k-_lX-ane-KAvgmm2Xvg

The chocolate almond croissant was more dense than any almond croissant I've had experience with but my boyfriend said this is how a proper almond croissant should be so be prepared for something a little different. There were 3 flavors available for the macarons. The pistachio had good flavor and a slightly chewy texture with a light crispy exterior. These macarons are on the large end but they were baked perfectly. The pastries here are certainly a step above your standard French bakery and if you love pastries this is a must eat while in Vegas!",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g,1,0,4,HnHxG4oKX6Xx641jFTvSng
1901606,2016-09-11,1,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"Unfortunately Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian was a huge disappointment.
It began with trying to find the small counter located in a most obscure location within the massive property of the Venetian Hotel.  I felt so frustrated by the time we finally arrived and made a comment about the location to one of the many employees behind the counter.  The young lady looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  She couldn't have cared less.  Remember?  This is a Thomas Keller experience and I guess I should have remembered that part.  Once I made my selections I was passed over to the cashier, or was it one of the many other people behind the counter (they were literally bumping into one another because there were so many people behind the counter) where I repeated my order to her and cashed out.  I had selected the ham and cheese on a baguette that was heated up for me and was good.  No complaints.  The bread was fresh and because it was heated had a nice crunch to it.  I had also ordered several other products for the sake of this review and because having recently returned from a 3 month stay in France wanted to have the opportunity to make a fair comparison.  Keep in mind my selections (with the exception of the TKO) are standard faire anywhere in France so in my mind the right selections for the sake of comparison.
The almond croissant was so heavy (weight).  As soon as I picked it up I knew it was nowhere close to an almond croissant one would find anywhere in France or any Stateside French bakery.  It was FILLED with almond paste and there was no flakiness whatsoever to the pastry.  I took a couple of bites and tossed it.  I pulled the Financier from the bag and took a couple of bites of it and it too was just a big heavy something or other.
I am not trying to sound like a snob but I have come to realize there are ""American"" French (sounds good) Bakeries and there are French Bakeries.  This is definitely an American style French Bakery.  The products are heavy, way too big in size and lack any ""French"" to them.  
So to wrap it up, I thought the employees made me feel like I was lucky to be at a Thomas Keller establishment.  The location (or secret hiding place) of this particular ""kiosk"" or ""counter"" was ridiculous.  And finally it is not a French Bakery but a bakery where you can pick up something that resembles a bakery item you would find in France or most French Bakeries Stateside.

1905473,2012-06-12,1,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"After visiting the Bouchon Bakery in Napa Valley, I just had to visit the one in Las Vegas when I was there. I brought my friends along because they wanted to see the huge macaroons. Be careful though because the place is pretty difficult to find (I even had trouble with the directions given by the Venetian associates). 

The only thing I purchased at this Bouchon Bakery was the full set of MACAROONS (a total of six pieces). NOTE: If you buy 5 macaroons, you get 1 free. The macaroons were about $3.50 each. 

I purchased a pre-packaged set of six macaroons, which containedVANILLA, PISTACHIO, RASPBERRY, COFFEE/CAPPUCHINO, CHOCOLATE (brownie?), AND A SPECIAL BOUCHON FLAVOR. Truthfully, since they were pre-packaged, I'm assuming the macaroons were made that day hopefully rather than the day before. Just to be safe, for anyone purchasing six, one of each flavor, go with the regular boxing where they grab the fresh ones made. 

I wanted to bring it home to Orange County to enjoy with my boyfriend, so I stuck it in the trunk and drove on home with the others. Need I remind you it was summer, but I never would have thought anything would have happened to the macaroons, sensitive creatures they are. 

Sad to say, never ever leave your macaroons out in heat, even if it's not in direct sunlight. Room temperature is best. Why? Because when I opened the truck, my poor chocolate/brownie macaroon sort of melted and oozed out this liquid and traveled down the box and ruined my other macaroons. Some were also cracked already (dang, sensitive pastries)!!! 

They all looked horrific by now, so I dare not show them to my boyfriend. As a result, I enjoyed them by myself. :) :) :) Hahaha.

Anyways, onto the review of the tastings and enough of my ranting. 

In the end, I prefer the Napa Valley Bouchon over this one.

Overall, all the flavors were actually perfect and light. The only thing I have to say about the CHOCOLATE/BROWNIE macaroon was that it was a little too dense and chocolatey (probably because of the melting though). My favorites were the VANILLA and PISTACHIO. The coffee one was alright. If you like coffee flavored pastries, you might like this one. As for the RASPBERRY, I never got to taste it. *sobs* I accidentally left it out and the dang ants got to them. 

This was a bad luck batch of macaroons is all I'm saying. On my part though, not the bakeries.",ireQlNltOIdagLTNs_Q_Pg,1,1,3,6ab1HVXZgWYSUIjNLap1-A

My favorites
*  Oh Oh - Used to be called a Ho Ho, but I think Hostess had a problem with that.  But, this is pretty much a gourmet ho ho and it is awesome!
*  TKO - This one is like a gourmet Oreo.  In fact, I think the name stands for Thomas Keller Oreo.
*  Vanilla éclair - Simply a pate choux pastry with vanilla custard and cream.
*  Strawberry/Cream Cheese Croissant
*  Nutter Butter

Other notes:
-  Opens at 6am, which I guess is early for a Vegas crowd.  10 am would probably still be early, too!
-  I'm not a big macaroon person, but they have a pretty good selection here.  They also have 2 different sizes.
-  They run out of some pastries fairly early in the day, so if there's one particular thing that you like, make sure you go early.

The ""Let's meet downstairs at 11am on a Saturday"" plan is not going to work for you. Enter Bouchon Bakery.

Open 6 am to 9 pm every day of the week, Bouchon Bakery presents the opportunity to grab a snack the night before, or offers you a destination in the morning when you are inevitably awake before everyone else. Craving something sweet? Go for the decadent sticky-bun. Want something a little more basic? An epi-baguette with butter and jam will stave off hunger until it's time for brunch. Flying Southwest (no meals) at an ungodly hour Sunday? Grab a ham and cheese croissant and laugh at the people eating the pathetic airport offerings.

Also good: the raspberry filled ""beignets"" (they're not beignets--they're regular donuts, but they are super delicious), the macarons (especially caramel), the almond toffee and the shortbread cookies (the latter two make a particularly nice present for your significant other that hates cheap crap like magnets and key chains).

As I'm sure others have mentioned, it's not cheap, but nothing is in Las Vegas. At least the expense doesn't come with a long wait. It's notable that it isn't anywhere near the Bouchon restaurant.

1936739,2009-06-01,5,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"We were getting ready to leave for the airport and wanted to get a bite to eat in the hotel before we left.  It was close, on the way out to the airport and we assumed it would probably kick the crap out of any airport food you could get.  

Here's what we sampled:

Turkey Brie Sandwich: Brie, lettuce, roast turkey, and mustard.

Warmed and pressed, the bread had a texture of a ciabatta which was good, the creaminess of the brie got a little sticky and runny in the sandwich after heating it, and I liked the aroma and texture of melted brie in any way shape or form.  Still, I have to admit, this didn't outstanding, it was good, but the taste wasn't any different from a sandwich that I could have made myself.

Vegetable jardiniere Sandwich: With Portabello mushroom, eggplant, fennel, caramelized onions, picquillo pepper, fontina cheese and pesto.

My g/f ordered this.  Oh my goodness.  This is the sandwich I SHOULD have ordered from the start.  It is a vegetarian sandwich, but the meatiness of the mushrooms, the texture of the eggplant, with the aromatics and crisp bite from the fennel.  Each bite was almost a unique cathartic experience, you had a mixture of caramelized onions, the mellow heat and body from the pepper and the melted fontina cheese was able the sit carefully on the knife edge on being flavorful and robust but also remained delicate enough it didn't overpower the sandwich.  Seriously, my g/f loved this sandwich so much, it was almost impossible for me to get additional bites, I even offered her a trade on our sandwiches, where she simply smiled at me and continued eating.  This was a fantastic sandwich that even me; a devote carnivore, feel as though this was a sandwich that I would be happy to eat on a regular basis. 

Chocolate bouchons:  

Their name was given due to the fact that they are shaped like the corks from bottle of wine.  Without a doubt they certainly taste better then the real corks, these little morsels were rich and super moist, with little chocolate bits inside.  It reminds me of a brownie, a damn good one at that.

Chocolate Eclair:  

This was my dessert, me being the chocoholic after first glance when I saw it in the glass enclosure, I didn't stand a chance.  The choux pastry dough, was light and airy, carried a light and subtle sweetness, additionally the chocolate creme patissiere was decadent and smooth, and there was a rich slathering of more chocolate right on top, creating a lovely balance with each intoxicating mouthful.  

Lemon Tart:  

My g/f's choice, and quite honestly she has bested me once again, in terms of picking the item I would get again, the lemon filling almost reminded me of a lemon curd; with all the zest that they put in you could really taste the fresh lemons, the wonderful level of acidity balanced with a creamy richness.  Most notably, is the crust, here rather then to just do a pie crust or a simple graham cracker crust, they went with a fresh pine nut crust, the pine nuts created a great aroma, nutty texture with a crisp crunch.  With each bite of the two elements, with their contrasting flavors, and textures melded together creating a absolutely amazing dish.  It's a must try for those that have yet to experience this, and one I'll be getting next time.

Parisian Macaroons

Appearance wise these were stunning, I bought a couple of boxes to take back home as gifts, and even though up front they ran out, the staff were kind enough to go into the back room and make the rest to complete our order.  Wonderful presentation and colors, I was told that they each had different flavors, (which included lemon, orange, strawberry, vanilla, mocha and chocolate.)  Basically, we had a delay and ultimately a cancelled flight so me and my g/f may have dug into one of the boxes, you know we had to sample the gift we were giving and we did want to make sure the gift we were about to give was fresh since our next flight would be the next day.  So we sampled a box.  Rich, chewy and super dense, with a wonderful flavor sandwiched with a very thin layer of creme.  If I had to rate it in the order of preference, it went vanilla, coffee, lemon, chocolate, strawberry and orange.  Goes really well with a nice cup of plain coffee as well!

The next day on our way back for attempt #2 to the airport, we stopped by one more time here and replenished the macaroons gift box that we consumed while taste testing it.  So make sure next time your here go ahead and give into whatever pastries and sweets you desire just make sure don't leave without trying the lemon tart and the Vegetable jardiniere!",8DqQqPnWLMllH2Dd0bETtQ,8,6,4,k4_3ej_Moxs9KkUNRW9ENA

I'm somewhat surprised this business still has the Bouchon name on it- the quality is nowhere near what you receive at the bistro, despite a few shared items, nor is the quality.

In terms of setting, the place is a cute little stand overflowing with all manner of sweet treats palatably displayed.  An energetic staff deals with a fair crowd in a friendly, efficient manner.  You can order hot drinks as well as pastries.  I tried a spiced hot chocolate, which was a bit thin and not quite irresistible, but tasty nonetheless.

The pastries were phenomenal.  I picked up a croissant, a cheese danish, and a TKO.  The croissant was flaky, endlessly layered, and rich with buttery flavor.  It was one of the best croissants I've ever tasted.  The cheese danish was easily the best cheese danish I've ever tasted, a luscious golden pastry perfect in every way, completed by a delectable cheese filling heightened with lemon.  The TKO was true to its humble Oreo roots yet elevated chocolate and white stuff to heavenly splendor with its moist cakey outsides and fluffy cream.

I also bought a couple boxes of macarons, one as a gift and one to eat as soon as possible.  The box came with six flavors - raspberry, lemon, vanilla, espresso, chocolate, and pistachio.  I was a little bit disappointed not to have a salted caramel, but it's hard to be sad in the face of good macarons.  Bouchon's were not the best I've had, but they were very good, with great yielding shells and light insides that delivered sugar without getting saccharine.

I ordered an epi bread mini baguette, 6 macaroons in 6 flavors and a TKO cookie. The Epi bread was hard as a rock. I threw it away after 1 bite. Plus, fresh bread tastes best hot, not room temp. Next I tried the TKO. Supposedly white ganache inside a chocolate cookie crust. I love ganache so I couldn't wait to try it. Meh. It tasted like an oreo but 10 times more expensive. At least I ate that. Then I had 2 macaroons.  Very gelatinous in texture. Not like a typical macaroon, which I knew from looking at it, but just not very good at all. I'll give them to my friend so at least they won't go to waste but I'm not eating anymore. Not worth it at all.",72_LYJ526rMrrJ1gjzBbAg,1,1,1,sY2-KhbeqnHtNa7K7JQZRg

2180017,2014-01-22,7,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"Just call me crazy macaron lady.

I've been on the prowl for perfect macarons for a couple of years now. I've found a couple places that I love, a few that I like, and a ton that were just not good. I was delighted to find a small Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian when I was in Vegas last. I saw a ton of macarons and I knew I just had to try them.

MACARONS.
Hmm... well, I've had better. Collectively, the macarons were just okay. Individually, some were better than others. I went to Bouchon thirty minutes before they closed and realized they didn't have many macarons left in the display. I asked if they had more in the back, and the girl working there said they do but they're in a set of six. I thought to myself, this was perfect! I wanted to try a bunch of flavors anyway. So I ended up paying around $20 for six macarons. Crazy right?! Usually I pay around $25 for a dozen. But hey, when in Vegas. 
I noticed immediately after my first bite that the macarons that were pre boxed were not very fresh. I could tell because the macaron completely crumbled after one bite, which is usually because they've old. Fresh macarons (24-48 hours) are typically crisp on the outside but are chewy on the inside. Though the outside shell can be crumbly, the whole thing shouldn't just collapse. The macarons were either old or they weren't made properly.
Regardless, I tried every flavor. My favorites were the chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The chocolate was filled with a rich chocolate ganache. The coffee was strong but in a good way, the way it should be in a macaron. The vanilla was light and it cleansed my palette after the strong (delicious) coffee macaron I had just before it. The strawberry tasted funky to me... kind of like a flower. I don't know how to describe it, but I didn't like it. I find strawberry macarons are a bit tricky to get right, not unless you use fresh strawberry in the filling. The artificial flavors just don't cut it with this delicate french pastry. The pistachio was horrid... it was strong in flavor and was just too much for me to finish. I'm not a fan of pistachio, so maybe that's why. But if you love pistachio, you'll probably really enjoy this one!

PRICE.
About $20 for a box of 6 macarons is quite expensive. I realize this is Vegas and Bouchon Bakery is expensive, but dangggg! I think next time I'll come earlier in the day, make my own customized box of macarons, and call it a day. I'd be more satisfied with a box full of flavors I really like.

OVERALL. Okay macarons, in my opinion. The price is way too much for what you actually get. I'm no cheapskate, but I know how much an 'okay' macaron should cost, and how much a GREAT should macaron cost. I paid too much for 'okay' macarons.",wKV3ZMdOe4b_yaPGTy8Igg,7,7,3,McUeIP7fxx9tQsvo6d-TEA

Tried some of my cousin's bread pudding. As good as any bread pudding I've ever had, even though I'm not a huge fan of bp to begin with.

The strawberry croissant, though innovative, was a little too sweet for my taste. Don't be deceived by its flatness. Even though it is a little unsightly, I think you'll be satisfied.

Summer 2016

I'm cheap when it comes to shoes and purses, but with pastries I'm a freakin' baller. I LOVE breads and desserts from Bouchon, that's where I'd spend my dollar dollar bill, y'all! 

In this review, I'm going to focus on their macarons, the French sandwich cookie (NOT macarOOns, the cookies with coconut). I get irritated when people label their cookie pics incorrectly. 

It's hard to resist macarons, airy and delicately crisp, so I bought a box of six minis and six large ones (buy 5, get one free). I love the sweet, creamy filling but their flavors were not very exciting - vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel,  raspberry. How about matcha tea? Blueberry? Black Sesame? Or how about Champagne? They need more colorful macarons!Nevertheless, I enjoyed the French cookies but I don't need to get two boxes next time. I'd rather stock up on the breads.

The Raspberry Macaron was by far, my favorite of the 6, followed by the Pumpkin and Chocolate. Like all Macaron lovers, I'm pretty picky about them (I'm a fan of the ones from 'lette) and these had the perfect ""chew"", flavor and shell :) Next was the TKO....and yup, it was a winner! Seriously, every bite was sinfully good. It was ten times better than a real Oreo (yes, it's possible!) 

I've been on the hunt for the perfect chocolate chip cookie and Bouchon helped me get one step closer to finding it! It was wonderfully chewy and full of rich, quality chocolate...soooooo good!

Oatmeal cookie- large. Full of flavor. So so chewy. I bought it and ended up not eating it until 2 days later, still so fresh tasting.

Granola bar- sweet and chewy. Also really good. 

Chocolate almond croissant- so crisp and flaky on the outside... But soft, moist, and buttery inside. Just enough chocolate bits and a nice amount of almond spread. Just a bit messy to eat! 

Macarons- I got one of each flavor. Again I didn't eat right away, instead, I took it home and stored it in the fridge. Next day, the macarons still tasted very fresh. Delicate cookie, soft, and chewy. The vanilla and chocolate ones were very sweet and rich. The flavors were kinda plain actually... The PB&J macaron tasted a bit like the chocolate one, but with jelly/jam in it.. The size of hockey pucks, just one is enough to satisfy any sweet craving you might be having.

What's not worth it? Those strawberry croissants that everyone was raving about. I was imagining fresh macerated strawberries, perhaps with a touch of cream, inside a buttery, flakey, chewy croissant. What did I get? Something like the love child of a fruit pie with crumble top and a danish. Yes, it's a croissant. Sort of. It's very buttery, but very flat. There aren't that many strawberries in it. And the flavor is dominated by the crumble topping (butter, sugar, cinnamon). It was not bad, it was just, eh, whatever. Definitely not worth getting up early to buy before they sell out. And definitely not worth getting more than once, if at all. I would say save your money for the macarons. 

Oh, I almost forgot--there's some kind of round cheese danish type sweet that's AMAZING. I ate it at the restaurant, but if they have it at the bakery, you will not be disappointed. Get that instead.

Location: 

Inside the Venetian. It's a little difficult to find if you are on the strip coming from the direction of the Wynn. Once you get to the Venetian you'll see the entrance to the casino (to the right will be the gondolas). Just go through the doors. Once in the casino, you'll see the sports book area to your right. Go straight through past the slots, table games and more slots towards the theater (currently showing the Phantom of the Opera). You know you're close when you see some restaurants to the right and an information desk in front of you.

I was STOKED that they had a pumpkin macaron, perfect for fall and winter! Unfortunately, it got smushed in my bag before I found a spot to sit and gobble it.

I bought a pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant shaped into a rectangular roll) for breakfast. It was flaky and delicious, however, it needed more chocolate! There were only a few chips...disappointing. However, the other baked goods I got to take home were excellent.
First up was a strawberry cupcake. It was gorgeously made and topped with a small chocolate disk. This one tasted like it had buttermilk in the batter. It was moist and ever-so-slightly tangy. Really excellent paired with the strawberry cream. As good as the ones I make! ;)
Then, I got 4 different flavors of macarons. The vanilla one was fine, as expected. The chocolate caramel was the favorite. Rich caramel flavors in the filling. Delicious! Strawberry and chocolate were good also. The macarons are about 1/3 larger than the usual. They have a perfect crunchy exterior, the frilly ""feet"" that are mandatory for macarons, and the right amount of creamy filling. The texture is slightly chewy at room temperature.

(-1) For having the dryest butter croissant. It looked soo good and flaky. But darn can looks be deceiving. 
(-1) For having the morning sticky bun that was made two mornings ago. They claimed these were baked fresh... but i've made sticky buns myself and they didn't taste that stale (the butter in the caramel had almost a rancid taste) even after days in the fridge. 
(-1) For macaron that was frozen, not properly thawed, and then produced to ice while still being ice-cold. The worker claimed they were ""Refrigerated"". Unless in the cooking world -8C is refrigeration, something is wrong.

Both croissants were light but yet had a crisp but not too crumby exterior.

If you like really good croissants, don't get there's. Honestly, it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco. Not that there isn't a place for those, but it isn't at an extremely reputable patisserie. 

More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can't decide whether I should finish eating it or not. 
If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn't be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it.

This macaron, again, tastes a day old, it's hard,crunchy, and too cold. 

If you haven't had a macaron before, don't have this one or else you'll think macarons themselves are disappointing. The flavor is ok, however.

We have been to the location in Beverly Hills but this was my first time here at the Vegas location.  My wife and I both ordered the Petite breakfast which comes with a pastry, coffee and juice, eggs, and bacon and sausage and a side of fries.  The food was good and obviously this place is know for its pastries.  We did have an issue with the service.  Halfway through our meal we noticed that we were not served our juice.  When we asked one of the wait staff, we were told that it did not come with our meal, which we were a little confused because the waiter took down our order.  It wasn't until we got our check that we asked another person and he clarified that it was indeed included so they brought us a glass after we have already finished our meal.  Also our fries never came and by the time someone came by to see if everything was ok, it was already too late so we told them to cancel it.  Needless to say we felt like the waiter just totally ignored us when it wasn't even that busy since we were seated at like 8am on a sunday morning.",NPoMCxJOTIkH71nuR5flRQ,0,0,3,2eKOW4jttfCS8Y9hmhqZrg

The only thing that saved me from pulling my hair out was the delight of munching on my pastries I brought home from Bouchon Bakery!!!

I had the Financier and Pain Au Raisin for a total of $5.25.  Trust me, this is a very fair price to pay for heaven in your mouth!  First, I devoured the Financier, which is like a Madeleine but better!  It's encrusted with sugared, sliced almonds, which gives it the perfect crunch while the cake itself was perfect in every way: both in texture and taste!  I wikipedia-ed financiers and supposedly, ""financier"" is ""derived from the traditional rectangular mold, resembling a bar of gold"".  And boy, this truly is a bar of gold.

At this point, I was going to give Bouchon Bakery 4 stars.  Then........then I finished my Pain Au Raisin for breakfast.  Can my taste buds be any more spoiled?!?  I thought being a day old would depress the quality of this croissant-like pastry but noooo.  The raisins aren't pruny; you can actually taste the meat of the raisin..and the sugar crystals instantly dissolve in your mouth!  

I admit, I was skeptical at first..but now, I'm a believer!  I can't believe I didn't try Bouchon Bakery the last time I stayed at the Venetian, considering it's the first thing you see once you leave the Venetian Guest Towers!

So wrong.  Days later and back in the Midwest I am gorging on the goodies and dreaming of Bouchon.  Such classy and excellent staff, so helpful and friendly.  Late hours at a bakery?  Phenomenal!   And that damn good cup of coffee. 

Now. Macarons.  Some are small and crisp me skimpily slithered with succulent jam.  Others wear a brittle meringue hat and one may find the head within that hat a bit chewy and dense.  These varieties may be daubed generously with supple sensuous buttercream--never overly-sweet.  

Bouchon has the latter sort.  I tried Black Forest, coffee, salted caramel, chocolate covered pistachio, and pumpkin.   All amazing, some more or less so.   I also destroy---er, I mean I ate a better nutter and a tko (aka Thomas Keller Oreo).  The two sandwich cookies were deliriously delicious.  Like a transcendental experience.   Full body bliss.

The baguette was okay.  It came with two little sides of mayonnaise and cornichons.  I got it toasted, which now I felt I shouldn't have because it takes away from the texture of the bread.  A bummer was that the cheese wasn't even melted and there was an excessive amount of ham.

Too bad it doesn't taste like anything. 

We got raspberry and their special flavor of the month (or week, or something?) which was strawberry lemon. I could BARELY taste the raspberry, and subsequent bites lost all flavor completely - I could taste the almond from the almond meal. And the strawberry lemon?

I bought the set of flavors here, and it was totally worth it to try all the flavors! Now I know which ones are my favorite...and they have to be Raspberry, Vanilla Bean, and Coffee. I think these flavors are more fragrant and they coffee has a deep earthy coffee taste to it, just how a coffee flavor should be. The lemon and orange were a little too sweet for me, and I just somehow don't like the citrus flavored macarons as much. And I never had a thing for chocolate flavored anything, so take my opinions with my preferences in mind.

The shells are very delicate, as they crack quite easily, but the crunch had just enough soft chew too, and on top of the cream or ganache inside, it was heavenly! 

I also tried the carrot cake cookie and it was okay. I think the carrot cake could have been more moist. The cream cheese filling was good though. =) There was also a really cute sweets stand next to this stand. Oh, and Bouchon Bakery is not a store. It's literally like a little stand!

The little (and I emphasize little) shop was clean and welcoming, and the clerk was also pleasant. Selection was not great, but it is a satellite location and it was later in the day. There was still enough to choose from, but nothing tasted very fresh.
The almond croissant was absolutely gorgeous but dry and hard to chew. 
I cannot judge the macarons because, not unlike sushi, I realize they're popular but I have no idea why. You can have my share of those and the pork belly, too.
The peanut butter sandwich cookie was good, but had too much overly sweet filling (this coming from a glutton), and the TKO (oreo) she got was rich and chocolaty but a disappointment with it's hardened filling that should have been creamy. 
Not sure where or when these were actually baked, but I made both of these cookies at Christmas from the Thomas Keller cookbook, and, god strike me dead, the ones I made tasted better. Could it just be the freshness factor?
In the interest of full disclosure, Rosebud HAD visited the Yountville location in recent memory, so her expectations were high, but I was only expecting for the professionals to do it better than me, and was still disappointed.

So, I tried one of their chocolate chip cookies -- huge, about the size of 4 normal sized cookies. The flavor was good, not intensely sweet, but I've had better. It could have used larger chunks of chocolate.

I also tried the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). Loved it! Although is was bordering on being too sugary and sweet, the chocolate cookies were soft and chewy (but not too dense) and the creme was fabulous.

I was staying in the Palazzo but Bouchon's was just a short 5 minute brisk walk away. I love the fact that the bakery, is just a simple and open store. It's not big and extravagent - just an open storefront you might see walking down the street in Europe. Once my friends and I got here, there were so many choices starting from breakfast items like croissants, breads to dessert like massive chocolate chip cookies, macaroons and dessert beignets!

I eventually ordered:
* Almond brioche - it's almost like almond brittle baked on to a nicely toasted slice of brioche. Nice and buttery.
* Chocolate chip cookie - A little too sweet for me but lots of butter :)
* Assortment of macaroons - I got the box set which included every flavor - strawberry, orange, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, espresso. The box set was $17.50 which is a steal when you do the math. Individual macaroons were $3.50 each. These macaroons weren't your normal sized macaroons either, they're about 3-4 times as big which makes me gladly hand over my money for these bites of delicious goodness.
* Beignets - They come at $3.75 for two so I got both flavors that they had that day, raspberry and chocolate. The raspberry one was nice and sweet but was way overfilled with too much raspberry jelly - a little hard to eat. The chocolate one was heaven - rich chocolate ganache inside of a chocolate flavored beignet with chocolate sprinkles on top. Can it get any better than that?!

The macaroons were definitely the highlight of the bunch. They were sweet, crunchy, creamy and divine.

We are Las Vegas locals. I have been here once before and had an OK experience then as well. 
The first time we came rather late, there was a very minimal selection. We chalked it up to how late in the evening we arrived. On our recent second visit we came at a decent time mid-day. It was the same scenario, barely a selection. 

The macaroons are OK. We got the Salted Caramel, Vanilla and Chocolate. One of them was really stale and hard to bite in unfortunately. The texture is on point, but sadly the taste just isn't there. They all tasted very similar, with not munch of difference in flavor.

The juice was fresh and I am sure they didn't add any sugar. It was delicious.
The grilled cheese was properly buttered and there must be an extra ingredient because that thing was the bomb - or maybe I thought so because I was starving.

( the one above Walgreens)  My husband and i have been long time fans of bouchon bakery... so much that we have to stop by each time we leave.  our must gets are usually the ham and cheese croissant and ham and cheese sandwich / turkey sandwich.  This past weekend ( easter) , we stayed at the palazzo and walked to this tucked away location thinking we could beat the line.  we got there and were the only ones there ...so here we were thinking yay we scored.  The girl behind the counter did not greet us right away... not that it mattered if she was busy .. but she wasnt and when she did she was not very friendly.  I placed my order of the ham and cheese croissant and waiting for it to be heated up.  IN the meantime, my husband wanted to place an additional order but this girl was just ignoring him.  It took almost like 2 minutes before she asked if he needed some help or if he wanted to order.  yeah granted we came together, maybe that can be confusing, but i thought it was pretty obvious that he needed to place to order.  Anyways, after 2 minutes she finally acknowledged that we wanted more sandwiches.  Again she was not friendly, and almost borderline giving us an attitude. But we didnt say anything; we just stayed quiet and just waited patiently for our sandwiches.  At the other locations, the staff normally would put the whole sandwich in the panini press but this girl... she took the sandwich apart and then heated it .  

it just seemed so different ... but the main reason for this review was b/c both my husband and i got food poisoning from these sandwiches we got .  I dont know if its b/c of the location - that they may not get the most fresh items or if the assembly of these sandwiches went wrong.  

but for now .. im definitely staying away from bouchon.  
some may say .. maybe its something else we ate or drank that day ... but to make it simple, those sandwiches were the only thing we ate that day before we headed back home and water was the only thing we drank ( bottled).

During my last trip to Vegas in October, we came here spontaneously after LAVO Brunch. They have various desserts, including giant and mini macarons, giant cookies, cake, and other pastries. Currently, if you buy 5 giant macarons, you get one free. It's obviously a better deal than the box of six mini macarons, but the mini ones definitely look a lot more appetizing.

After much contemplation, I got a box of six mini macarons for $15. The flavors included were pistachio, pumpkin, vanilla, sea salt caramel, and coffee, which were all very, very good. Amazing flavoring, texture, and consistency; the outer egg-shell like crust was perfectly thin, airy, and the inner had a soft, almost meringue texture.

- Macarons: these are PURE PERFECTION. They also have a super cute box of mini macarons of 6 for $18
- Kouign Amann: I've been on a Great British Bakeoff kick lately and this was one of the challenges. I was curious to know what it tasted like, so I jumped at a chance to try it when I saw it. This was so flaky, sweet, crispy, delicate. I really like Bouchon's version (that lamination!)
- Epi bread: If you've ever eaten at Bouchon, you know their version of baguette bread. Sprinkled with a little water, and a few minutes in the toaster oven and it's like you're eating it fresh! Or you can just eat it fresh in your hotel room. I always ask them for butter and jam to go. 
- Chocolate Chip Cookie: this is a chocolate chip cookie. It's literally perfect. It's got the crispy edges, the sharp bitter chocolate, the chewy and tender inside. When I crave a chocolate chip cookie, this is the one I want. 

Pros:
- Literally everything in the display case looks freaking amazing, and taste delicious. DELICIOUS! 
- Perfect snack to nibble on during the drive back home

- Great deliciousness comes with great price. It's not as cheap as your corner donut shop, but honestly, why not treat yourself a little during your stay in Vegas? DO IT! TREAT YO'SELF!

What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the  overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. 

Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic.

I could not help but purchase 4 orders of apple croissants, 2 almond croissants, a kouign-amann for the road. Out of these orders our favourites were the apple croissants; a delicious almond filled croissant with soft baked apple layer on top. 

Although I noticed an array of vast macarons, I was not keen to try as their flavours were nothing but the ordinary. For macaron consumers, these sizable cookies would be an indelible treat.

I stayed at the Palazzo this time and was so excited that Bouchon was a short walk away from me!  Bouchon for breakfast every day!

I only managed to take a picture of my almond croissant because I would devour everything else I bought without thinking.  Also, because I was hungry.  On this trip I got almond croissants, a chocolate chip cookie and a breakfast sandwich.  YES, everything was amazing.  I've also tried their macarons in the past.  Their macarons are huge.  To me, their macarons are the next best ones after Laduree. That's saying a lot!

Their breakfast sandwich is cheese, an egg and bacon in a croissant.  They warm it up for you and the croissant becomes this soft flaky heaven.  This sandwich is also huge by the way.  I'm sad I couldn't finish it.  Their chocolate chip cookie is wonderfully soft.  So soft, it stayed almost it's natural state 3 days later in the bag in my hotel lol. I couldn't eat it all at once but still tasted great the third day.  I got the almond croissant almost daily to have some sort of carb readily available in my room.  So good.

The bigger size does not take away from the consistency of having a crispy shell with a soft and chewy inside. How do these compare with Paulette's, which have become the standard for good macarons? The texture is definitely there, but the flavors still go to Paulette's. The flavors are limited to: chocolate, raspberry, orange, lemon, espresso, and vanilla - good, but not amazing.

3948069,2014-12-31,0,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant  NOT the bakery. 
My review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. 

They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners 

The coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.  

First, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said ""that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old"" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. 
 I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. 

Do not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding. 

The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. 

I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.",Uwu6MCuv_YIxHL0kDxEVxg,2,0,1,ynqgUNgx_SasELX7oPVqMA

The bakery doesn't provide a sitting area, but it's a great place for a quick grab and go. Showcasing countless selections of morning pastries and snacks, it was difficult choosing only a limited few. Between the 3 of us, we walked away with a slice of pesto, tomato, & feta foccacia bread, pistachio macaron, pear & apricot glazed bread pudding, strawberry croissant, mini chocolate bouchons, and a box of half dozen macarons for the flight home. $48 for everything was a major rapage, but well worth it.

The pesto foccacia was very moist and flavorful, but a bit on the greasy side. Appropriate to indulge if you need to recover from a nasty hangover. Bread pudding was a major surprise, but the richness and density in each bite was overwhelmingly filling. I wish I could have stomached more, but at least my left overs lasted 2 days later and still tasted just as amazing. 

For the box of macarons, we had pistachio, raspberry, vanilla bean, lemon, mocha, & chocolate. Favorites listed that order as well. The texture is much more dense than what I'm used to, but the cream filling won me over. Not sure how many of these babies I can devour over a cup of coffee, but they're certainly a delectable treat.

So I ended up getting that pack. Yes, fat girls' problems, but it's worth it. They were of six different colors, There's a vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel flavored. I posted a picture of it, colors do get to me. They're not too sweet, which I liked. My favorite ones were the pistachio and the coffee ones.

Since we couldn't all afford the real deal, we stopped by the bakery which is right across from the Phantom of the Opera Theater.

I couldn't finish it all in one sitting so I saved some for later. I thought I would be back to get some macaroons - they are the hugest I've ever seen - but I never made it back so that's something to get next time.

I could do without the earl grey one, the flavor just didn't do it for me.  It was a weird combo of flavors.  Wasn't bad...but wasn't great.

4005015,2017-01-01,21,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"This small French dessert kiosk is located behind the escalator on the casino floor of the Venetian. The obscured location might be difficult to find, but somehow we always managed to stumble upon it. Without a seating area, the line alongside the large pastry counter may be long, but it usually gives us just enough time to make the right choices. 

My favorite item was the PBC ($4.25). It came with a layer of salted peanut butter with a ring of chocolate, sandwiched in-between two thick cookies filled with bits and pieces of peanuts and chocolates embedded here and there. The centrality of the sweet and salty peanut flavor nicely intermingled with the dark semi-sweet chocolate. The cookies were firm with a nice crisp and crumbly texture. I am a big fan of peanut butter, and together, this sandwich cookie was a winner.

I also enjoyed the palm size French Macarons ($3.50) and would highly recommend them. One of Santi's favorites, the Pistachio Macaron was semi-sweet, and carried a refined, natural pistachio flavor. The outer texture was crisp, egg shell-like, and delicate, followed by an air pocket before reaching the base of the shells and its creamy filling. Together, the macaron had a good chew, but the base of the shell was a bit stiff and thicker than necessary. 

Comparatively, I had better results with the Salted Caramel Macaron. Well balanced, the refined caramel flavor was sensational along with a slight hint of salt in the background. The all-around contrasting textures of this macaron were also more consistent with my expectations. I would love to get the Salted Caramel Macaron again, but I'm also looking forward to trying the other seasonal flavors.

The Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($3.25) was not the best, but still highly addictive. This massive cookie was firm, crispy, and fully loaded with semi-sweet chocolate in every bite. I wished the crispy buttery cookie had a softer chew, but the thick crumbly texture did not deter me from eating it all in one setting. I would have enjoyed this cookie more if it could be served warm. 

The item I did not fully enjoy was the Pain au Chocolat ($4). The crisp, ultra flaky, airy and soft textures were impressive, and nicely accompanied by a hint of salt and buttery flavor. However, there were only two tiny strips of chocolate embedded at the bottom of the croissant. To date, Amandine Patisserie still has my favorite Pain au Chocolat.

I also do not recommend the Cinnamon Roll ($4). The layers were too dense, stiff, and cake-like without the yeasty airy dimensions to render that soft gooey cinnamon wow factor.

The TLC ($3.25) made with pecan, cinnamon, and rolled oats had a one-dimensional earthy flavor without some other ingredients to complicate the overall profile. I tried, but did not finish the cookie.

Overall, their desserts were more buttery than sugary, with impressive level of balance in the flavors and textures across each ingredient. It wasn't necessarily a refined experience in every bite, but there was still plenty to like about their pastries and desserts. Service was to the point and prompt on each of our visits. I hope to return soon to try their Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Kouign-Amann, Thomas Keller Oreo, and Seasonal Éclairs and Tarts.",0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw,35,33,4,bD_8eky8Yax-fH5a_0JnKQ

I visited and purchased food from the Bouchon Bakery on the first floor of the Grand Canal Shoppes area. It's just off the Strip near B&B Burger and the outdoor gondola ride. We happened upon another Bouchon Bakery when we went upstairs afterward, and the original location is somewhere inside The Venetian. We found this one to be the most convenient, and it had a slightly wider selection than its overhead neighbor.

I took two items to go and ate them within a few hours. The Croissant ($3.75) is a go-to pastry, and the version here is golden brown outside and chewy outside, with enough buttery flavor for anyone but diehard butter fans. Aside from how easily some of the outer layer flakes off, it's comparable to any other versions in town both on-Strip and off-Strip.

The Kouign Amann ($4.50) is another classic, although it's tougher to find. It's both more difficult to make and less popular. This version does have a lot of the right crispy and chewy textures and the expected sugary flavors. I think this one cheats a little though; you can easily see a glassy sugar layer on the flat side of the kouign amann, and the dough just doesn't have enough layers. It's way too flat compared to other good versions that I've had. However, if I was blindfolded, I would likely have no issue.

As long as parking stays free at the Palazzo and the Venetian, I'd consider making regular stops to this Bouchon Bakery for some pastries. My first taste was good enough (let's say 3.75 stars averaged between the two bites), so I'm optimistic about similar results if I venture into the cookies, macarons, or other baked goods (cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and so on).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,6,4,YFxshyr0Y6uBxjtBq41Ntg

4 days in Vegas and I made it a point to stop here just for those delicious macaroons I keep reading about. There's no secret, macaroons are just simply heavenly and to die for but these were probably the best I've ever had, no lie.

The filling was a little more buttery which I loved because it contrasted with the sweet crispy cookie perfectly. I splurged and bought 2 gift boxes, one of the mini's and one regular sized. At first glance, the prices may shock you but for the size of the cookie and quality in taste, it's well worth it.

I didn't actually get to eat most of them until I got home since I was stuffing my face with everything else on the strip haha. Scared that the cookies would lose the crispiness, I literally scarfed down my macaroons in a few days. I was surprised though on the fourth day, the cookies were nearly fresh still.

So when we arrived we were told about a 30 to 35 minute wait. We asked to be seated in the section nearest the glass doors. When They first called us to seat us about 30 minutes later they offered us a table that is a shared bench with others. We told the hostess we prefer to not have that kind of seating and would rather have a table by the glass doors. I mentioned they had five open tables and perhaps we could have one. Hostess told me that the tables are reserved. I told her that when I called I was told I could not reserve a table. She then told me that they keep those tables open for the owner or the owner's brother in case they come in. Of course I found this to be absurd. I know that highrollers get better service but I still found this to be quite absurd. So we sat down to await a better table. About 10 minutes later another hostess trier to seat us at another table with a shared booth. We told her again that we would like to have a regular table so she had us wait again. About another 15 to 20 minutes went by and another host came to seat us and tried to seat us in a bigger table with a shared bench. Just as he was doing that one of the original hostesses came over and told him that we wanted a table. I gestured to the now four open tables and he said that they're reserved. I thanked him but told him we were going to just leave. He said he didn't want us to leave so he gave us one of the tables that we had asked about. Frankly, we used to love this place. We always came here whenever we are in Las Vegas. The food and service has always been impeccable. This time the servers were nice, but  just overworked.

1) BOUCHON BAKERY - (little stand)

If you've got an insane sweet tooth, then try the apple croissant.  I wouldn't suggest that one for breakfast though b/c it was way too sweet for my liking.

The macarons were packed well for travel so they went right into my carry-on bag. They were larger than what I typically see in Seattle. Win! They were also very well done with flavors that range from chocolate to pistachio to salted caramel. Kouign amann is at the top of my list since my friend introduced me to it years ago. This did not disappoint. A hard, sweet exterior surrounds buttery, velvety goodness inside. This is enough to ruin you forever! The croissants were very large and flakey.

4402137,2017-05-05,3,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"Bouchon Bakery is a classic tourist trap in the Venetian on the Vegas Strip. I came to Bouchon Bakery one other time a year or two ago and the experience was so forgettable that I don't remember what I ordered or ate. 

This time, they won't be so lucky.

I ordered a ham and cheese croissant ($6.94) and requested it warm. Their version of ""warming up"" a croissant sandwich is apparently putting it in the microwave without actually turning the microwave on. Whatever treatment they gave it resulted in a ""smooshy"" and sad-looking croissant, but one with a decidedly cold filling. The ham was of the normal sliced deli variety. Despite being billed as containing dijon mustard, I couldn't taste any mustard. My eagerly-anticipated croissant ended up being nothing more than an unfortunate waste of emmenthaler cheese, and a waste of $7. I would have had a more satisfying croissant sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts.

I also ordered the kouign amann ($4.16), which was not as bad, but also no better than the kouign amanns I get at bakery-chain Paris Baguette in San Diego for half the price. Rather than being rich and buttery, with a cake-like consistency, Bouchon's kouign amann simply tastes and feels like a large croissant with a caramelized top (or bottom, depending on how you plate your kouign amanns).

My pastries were accompanied by an iced latte ($5.32) that was poorly conceived and negligently put together, with my syrup of choice fully sinking to the bottom of the cup before I could even take my first sip. Middling chains from Starbuck's to Panera Bread to Coffee Bean have solved for this by using thinner, more soluble syrups, why can't Bouchon Bakery?

Anyway.

Shame on you, Chef Keller. Understand that when you put your name on an establishment that serves food, your customers reasonably expect that establishment to represent your culinary ideals and perspective, regardless of whether or not you're directly overseeing the operation or engineering the menu. Your name has value, and people are willing to pay extra for that given your well-earned reputation. I have to believe that if one of your pastry chefs ever tried to serve anything of the quality I've had at Bouchon Bakery to your customers at French Laundry or Per Se, you'd fire him or her immediately for gross incompetence. Do the right thing and put this abomination of a bakery out of its misery -- your reputation is at stake.

Note: the bakery is separate from the restaurant, it's on the lower floor where everything's at, near the convention center I think. 

I came here based on Yelp reviews and of course I came here for the MACARONS! The eggshell-like cookie texture and soft, supple, and oozing center was on point and I suppose this is how an authentic macaron should be but I'm sure they don't compare to the ones from the Laduree in Paris. I hear the ones in Bottega Louie come close - my next target.

The macaron is like a mature, sophisticated, cultured, flamboyant, confident, well-dressed and sexy version of an oreo for all you macaron virgins (better yet, just look at the fuckin' pictures).

I got the packaged variety pack which cost around $17 and the price is worth every shining penny; definitely grab one, it includes 6 delightful pieces of art (each equivalent to an hour at the gym). The Pistachio macaron in particular was a tad larger than all the others (I've been told that Pistachio is the preeminent flavour to which all others will be judged) and this flavour was by far the best to lay on my hurricane tongue.

Bouchon Bakery, you tried to hide from me by tucking yourself underneath the elevators and stairs in the Venetian but my macaron senses started to tingle as my foot hit the casino floor and I instinctively walked behind the elevators. 

$17.50 for a box of 6 (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, lemon, orange, raspberry)? Only in Vegas will I splurge, but is each one worth like $3.50? Given that fact that it's twice the size of normal macaroons and it has the perfect crispy crunch on the outside and soft chewy middle I'd say YES !! I also didn't expect the lemon to taste very good so it was the first one to go, but the boyf and I LOVEDD it!!

With much hesitation he finally agreed.  This is going to be a short review but definitely to the point.

1. Chocolate Eclair: ugh.  Disgusting.  The chocolate filling was too bitter and it left that ""made yesterday"" taste.  Which it probably was.

2. Macaron:  I'm sorry, but macarons are not suppose to be more chewy than a stick of gum.  And it was chewy.  I lost faith in Bouchon's macarons here.  I thought they may blow LaDuree or even 'Lette macarons out of the water but they did not.  Even my husband (who's not big into sweets) even thought 'Lette macarons were good.

I ended up giving one away (not sure which one it was, hopefully not one that I would regret), but I kept the rest in a tightly sealed container in the fridge and I devoured them throughout the week.

Pink - My guess is that this was some kind of berry, maybe strawberry or raspberry, but it was yum.

Green - Pistachio. Great for nut lovers. I personally am not a big fan of pistachios in anything other than the nut itself, but the fact that I was eating a macaron, it didn't bother me.

Brown - Chocolate. I'm a huge chocolate fanatic, so this was orgasmically (if that even is a word) good. 

Yellow - Lemon. Perfect for those who like their sweets a little tart.

Beige - Coffee. This was my all time favorite of the batch. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I do love the taste of coffee and the fact that I can't have any right now or the next four months I think made this one top it all.

After the manager refused to give her whatever cash she wanted, she said something to the effect of, ""I know Thomas Keller, and this is not how he would want his business run.  I'm going to let him know how you people are treating me.""

The manager eventually gave her some money just to move her along, and then she pulled the following... She took her bag of pastries (just 2), went off to the side, and when the workers weren't paying attention, she put the bag back down on the counter.  When the worker came back to the register, she yelled, ""Where are my pastries?!?""  The worker responded, ""I just gave them to you.""  The lady decided not to respond, and just reached over and grabbed the bag that she had JUST PUT DOWN.  I think she was trying to con her way into some extra freebies.

The listing shows all three locations, but there are separate pages for the Clock Tower and Casino bakeries. Ugh. This bakery is directly in front of the Venetian Theater under the escalators.

Anyway, this location tends to be the busiest as I'm sure it's the most known and there's a lot of foot traffic from the Venetian parking garage and the casino. They stay well-stocked throughout the day; I haven't had any issues with not being able to find what I need.

Would give them 4 stars, but the first time we tried to go there, it was an absolute nightmare. We asked two Venetian employees where it was; one gave directions to the ""closest one"" and said there were three locations, the other said there was only one location and directed us to the one under the escalators by the Grand Lux. We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home. On the plus side, there was no line at all and I really liked the packaging of the 5-pack for the airplane.",TSj_Dc6xcrzJ2Hdyx68Lyw,0,0,3,YJAyomipozgIX4MnmA9emA

Most importantly, I needed to cater a small meeting in the morning and the staff there was able to accommodate my last-minute request for 20-ish pastries.

The carrot cake sandwich was my least favorite, though it was moist.  I guess I'm not a true fan of carrot cake.  It is either too sweet or too dry.  Theirs was perfectly not too sweet nor dry. The cream cheese frosting in the middle was perfectly sweet. It just wasn't memorable.

Their macarons were expensive, but I had to give it a try.  It can't be as good as Bottega Louie in Los Angeles, can it?  The coffee macaron was actually pretty tasty. The outside had a nice crunch, and the inside was soft and creamy.  The coffee taste was prevalent, but was a bit too sweet.  Nonetheless, it was delicious.

I saved the best for last.  My favorite, the nutter butter cookie was amazing.  The cookie part was crispy and buttery.  The inside peanut butter filling was creamy. It was like an actual nutter butter sandwich cookie, but a hundred times better.  The taste was definitely memorable.

This bakery and sweets shop is really hard to find.  Once you find it though, you will be glad you did.  Their baked goods are of the highest quality.

On my recent trip, I got a box full of Beignets, Monkey Bread, Chocolate Almond Croissants, and Kouign Amanns. Everything was so delicious, but oh my goodness, the Monkey Bread was  phenomenal! I've never had anything like it. The sweetness of the bread was so perfect, I didn't mind how sticky it was. Pair it with a coffee and you have a nice little snack. 

In addition to all the sweet baked goods, there's also a good mixture of savory items to choose from as well. The Ham and Cheese Croissant is usually a crowd favorite. However, I like the Turkey and Ham and Gruyere Baguette Sandwiches. They're perfect for a snack or quick lunch.

If you have limited space in your carry on, might I suggest bringing back a Macaron Gift Box. These are some of the best macarons I've ever had. Each box comes with 6 macarons. The quality put into each macaron is worth the price of the $14.50 box.

The mint choc chip was decently flavored, but it reminded me a bit of toothpaste. The cookie was a bit too mushy. The passion fruit was a disaster. The filling tasted like buttery egg, and it was only very very slightly passionfruity.

I enjoyed everything I ate, almost to a level of frustration for not knowing about this place sooner. The banana bread had so many nuts in it with a nice flavor of banana. The chocolate chunk cookie lived up to it's name sake with big pieces of chocolate in every bite, it was also really soft on the inside while having a crunchy outside, just how I like it.

The perfect ratio of crisp to chew, just enough raisins to keep things interesting and that butter flavor, true butter flavor, not that artificial butter flavored shortening garbage.  

They also do their version of a ""nutter butter"" cookie and if you're a fan of those peanut butter cookies then just times this version by 10. oh yea, it's that good.

Well as of May 2011, it's the best macarons in the whole universe. I got the wow factor, several times on my first macaron here. It went like this...""wow...ahhhh...ummmm....wow....awesome....etc"" and it went like that for the next 15 minutes because that's how long it takes to finish just one macaron.

They're $3.50 per macaron, but they are more than 3 times the size of a standard sized macaron. It pretty much fits right into the palm of your hand. So you get the quantity as well. But the quality far exceeds every other macaron I've ever had including the ones in Paris.

Bouchon, you have won me over. C'est la vie. My first one was the pistachio and it was phenomenal. The flavors just kept coming and coming. It was non-stop. Whatever they did to these macarons, I just had to buy more.

So I got the 6-pack as well. For $17.50, you definitely save a lot more instead of just buying one and you get one of each flavor available. I got everyone in the group onboard with my macaron frenzy and they too enjoyed and devoured their piece. Me on the other hand, wanted to savor this 6-pack at home and I regret not buying another box.

The 6-pack includes the raspberry, chocolate, lemon, pistachio, cinnamon and coffee. I'm not going to make another essay out of my macaron review, but essentially all of them were of the 5-star quality. No bullshit here. 

I also got one of the giant chocolate cookies, $3.50. Again, savor this one, because this one is rich, full of buttery chocolate flavor.

They have a few other Bouchon's out there including one up in the Napa Valley area. NV, you are now on my bucket list for a future visit and some more macarons.

They are not limited to just macaroons , there are sandwiches , bagels , brownies, muffins , coffees , juices . Well rounded spot for fancy snacking , that you can later walk off .
The macaroons have a slight crunch , but then seem to turn into a soft cookie that melts in your mouth . The chocolate ones are the favorite, for they are decadent without being too evil .

So when I FINALLY got the chance to try Bouchon Bakery this summer it sort of lost it's appeal. BUT, I had to give Bouchon a try since this is the first place I fell in love (at first sight) with macarons to begin with.

So I decided to try the pistachio macaron, a chocolate croissant and a TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). These are mega macarons, almost twice the size of the usual sold elsewhere. It was delish.I only wish they made smaller sizes so that different flavors can be tried. The chocolate croissant was just okay, maybe because I bought mines in the evening so perhaps it was not as fresh. I was also infatuated with the TKO because who doesn't love a homemade oreo cookie? It was good, but the white filling was a little too sweet for my liking.

Prices were: TKO ($3.25), Chocolate Croissant ($4.00) and macaron ($3.50). No tax was added on so total came out to $10.75.

Location of this kiosk:  The Venetian, under the escalator near the Phantom Theater (or whatever they may have re-named it by now).

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I figured I'd start my day properly with a visit to Bouchon Bakery.  I didn't feel like blowing my funds on a full sit-down brunch, so the bakery downstairs was the next best thing.  Not to say that the bakery is cheap (omfg, Porto's in LA...) but it's a more thrifty alternative. 

We picked up a tomato/feta focaccia (which the server offered to warm up for us) and banana walnut muffin.  Both were delicious.  The muffin was moist and not too sweet; the focaccia was savory and tasty. Nothing fancy, but the quality was more or less there.  One day, I think I'll actually venture up into the restaurant... but for my first Vegas trip, the bakery would suffice. :)

I only had two things at this french bakery.  They were so good, I kept on getting those two same things here:

1) Turkey and cheese baquette (toasted optional).  Comes on a walnut baquette with flavorful swiss cheese, turkey, and a sweet mustard-like spread.  I ate 4 of these, one for every day I was there.

2) Macarons.  So sad I discovered these late, as I was always focused on #1 above.  They have choices such as lemon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.  I got the vanilla. 

**pause** 

Melt. In. Your. Mouth. So. Delicously. Amazing. Macaron.  

Where have you been all my life? 

I've always thought the term ""macaron"" were reserved only for those coconut dropball cookies, but I learned from Eunice K. that this term also applied for this hamburger-shapped cookie sandwich filled with vanilla cream and coated with a light crunchy meringue-like coat.

If you are in for a quick breakfast or lunch, Bouchon has quality pastries, sandwiches, coffee and tea for that to-go meal you need.  Two big thumbs up from me.

**Just a note, it's a stand around the corner from Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian.  Nothing fancy.  Just a stand that serves delicious bakery items.  Eat your baked goods fresh, that's when they taste the best***",PQZ92eE6FFQlKfoxS4AESg,1,1,5,pCT0KKsl9BSUoif1qND3dg

Not so favorite experience: Eclair (it was stale!), caramel macaron (my preference is for it to have less caramel filling)

Service: 
Very nice - friendly counter person who generously gave me the last 2 broken raspberry macarons for free (I purchased 6 as a gift already) - me and my 3 year old had a very nice treat! :)

Pro-Tip: If it's your first time, you will get lost trying to find this small outpost so make sure you leave enough time if you've got other events on the agenda! After asking 4 different staff members and getting 4 different answers for two different floors, I ultimately lucked my way unto the Bakery. If you're walking towards the guest elevators, do NOT go up them. Instead, you'll find Bouchon Bakery literally behind the escalators.

Pistachio Macaron [$3.50]

I started off with a few macarons. Perfectly textured with a nice chew, the pistachio imparted a slightly nutty flavor which was nice. 

Salted Caramel Macaron [$3.50]

You can't go wrong with the salted caramel, which had great depth and richness. 

Better Nutter [$3.25]

The better nutter was better than your average Nutter Butter indeed. Within crisply thin cookies was a gorgeously creamy and light peanut butter that wasn't too intense. Pass the milk please! 

TKO [$3.25]

But really we were here for the TKO. Better than your average Oreo, the juxtaposition of the creme and the bitter chocolate notes from the cookies brought me back to childhood indeed. 

The pricing is admittedly a bit high, but you're paying for technique and precision from the pastry kitchen of Thomas Keller, one of America's notable chefs.

Imagine my surprise when I found out that it was just a tiny little stand (no seating) at the base of the escalators in the Venetian.  No matter--I loaded up and took it upstairs to the food court area and then indulged, Vegas style.

Here's what I got:

-Chocolate macaron: (5/5) Chewy and dense, this reminded me of what would happen if a cookie and brownie had a love child. 

-Carrot cake sandwich: (4/5)  Two carrot cake ""cookies"" with the frosting sandwiched between. It was very good, although the edges were slightly dried out.  I did go in the afternoon, and I assume the stuff was sitting out for a while, though.  

-Chocolate Chip cookie: (3/5) 

-Roast beef sandwich: (5/5) The chewy bread, the PERFECT roast beef, and something sweet mixed in there (caramelized onions perhaps? idk) was just heaven.  

-Chocolate bouchon: Cute and tiny. I didn't get to try this one, but was told it was very very good!

-Chocolate croissant:  (5/5)  This was the least oily croissant I've had, so it took me a while to get used to it.  I really liked the flakiness of the shell and the excellent dark chocolate inside.  

-TKO--The Thomas Keller Oreo (3/5)  I didn't really enjoy this that much. I thought the cookie was light and yummy, but the inside filling didn't do it for me. But perhaps that's because I don't like oreos to begin with. Why did I get this? Idk. I guess I read so much about it on Yelp.  I would only get this if you like oreos.

I do not crave sweet sugary foods (except for fruit!), but I'm glad I tried Bouchon bakery.  I'll be back next time to grab another sandwich and perhaps try more of their sweets!

Also, bouchon bakery is probably the best spot to get coffee in the hotel. The ratio of girls to guys in line is 5 to 1. That's pretty good odds for Vegas.

I chose vanilla and chocolate, after the girl helping me told me that the vanilla she picked up was a different color because it was prepared today and the others were not.

Great, I thought. Ends up the macaron was a different color, however, because it was lemon. It was still good, but do everyone a favor and ask your fellow workers before you start making things up.

5348909,2012-01-30,6,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"I am a fan of Thomas Keller. And I also have a thing for French Macarons! Enter Buchon Bakery of Las Vegas, NV.  Located in the casino level of the Venetian (under the escalators). You can find this one-stop shop infamous for their coffee, cakes and other carb-a-licious sweet goodies!

What did I try?
- BOUCHON = the French term ""bouchon,"" in English means ""cork stopper"" or ""cork in the mouth of a wine bottle"". In this case their ""bouchon"" was in the shape of a cork but in a cupcake form since it was a mini-brownie! This was VERY delightful! (emphasis on the VERY) In fact, the bouchon was soft and moist, chocolate-y, yet not over-powering. There was a touch of powdered sugar and for ($2) for one of these, you better savor the scrumptiousness! It was very heavenly!

- FRENCH MACARONS = I bought the to-go set (for $17.50), which includes all 6 flavors of their French macarons. They have chocolate, espresso, pistachio, strawberry, lemon and vanilla. ESPRESSO was my favorite out of all of them!

- CROISSANT = simple, buttery, flaky and couldn't stop myself from eating this! Caution for some of those buttery flakes falling upon your self! Word of advice: don't leave the evidence laying around!

- BREAD PUDDING = was very delightful! Filled with some custard, cinnamon, raisins and apples, this dish was very well put together! If you left me alone with this, it can be quite dangerous! I'm glad I shared!

- VEGGIE BREAD = made with fresh tomatoes and greens. It also had olives, pinenuts and delicious cheese! It tastes even better when TOASTED! (FYI = if toasted, expect to wait 3-4 minutes for it to be complete). But overall, even though I'm not vegetarian, I'd opt for this again!

Overall thought?
Awesome with a capital ""A""!!! I was a carb-fix so I did not sample the coffee. But there were lines of people who were ordering the stuff! Service was quick and it was nice that they were able to toast the veggie bread! The next time I visit here I'll be sampling the cup of joe with an espresso-flavored French macaron! Until next time my sweet, carb-a-licious bakery, I am forever a fan!",lj3rJy1dUuHMDnqU_OCfsA,11,7,4,sKPFvVCm1u4o3jyUSvd1TA

The macarons are good but I wish they would make them half the size and half the price so I could eat more flavors. I like to try different flavors but I don't think I can eat more than one without getting sick.  Plus if you don't like a flavor (I didn't like the chocolate) then you feel guilty about throwing away a $4 macaron. I'm a dark chocolate lover, but the flavor just seemed way too intense for a macaron. I also tried...

Blueberry Financier - ehh, it's ok, but the plain almond one was way better. Too bad they don't have it right now. 

Apple Croissant - Amazing, esp if you love apple crisp or Dutch apple pie. Make sure they toast it for you on the panini press.

Almond Chocolate Croissant. - It's pretty good, but the chocolate dominated the hell out of the marzipan, their regular almond croissant is better, but they don't have it there now.

Bouchons - INSANELY DELICIOUS. I always buy a package of 6 for $10 and take them home and bake them in my toaster oven for a couple minutes. They get kind of crisp on the outside and very soft and melty inside. They are very high in fat, so I put a wad of paper towel under when I bake them. It's always soaked with grease so I figure I can eat more because I am sparing myself a lot of fat grams, lol!

I'm dying to try their HoHo or choc tart next time

I next asked if i could customize the box of macarons, was told no. So i said i'd just get 4 pieces of macarons. When i get to the cashier i was told my bill was $28+. I wasn't thinking and just handed my card over. They never said thank you. Walking to the Palazzo, i realized it seemed too pricey, i opened my bag and realized that they put a box of macarons which i never ordered. I normally won't mind this but i was very disappointed and displeased with their service. I got home and tried their almond croissant with drizzle and was not impressed.

5406638,2017-07-08,2,3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ,"TLDR - good pastries but not something to seek out specifically

I was expecting more of an actual bakery/store but Bouchon Bakery is more like a small kiosk instead. There's 2 of them in the Venetian - one on the 2nd floor by an entrance to the shops and one on the 1st floor near the food court. 

The selection of pastries is rather small. There's macarons, cookies, croissants and a few other sweets. Nothing fancy or particularly unique or special. Prices are pretty standard for a typical bakery. 

Their cookies and pastries are good and a decent size, but not necessarily something I'd go out of my way to get again. Save your sweet tooth for other things in Vegas. 

My friends and I got a few things to try here:

* CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5
Nothing too special but still good. There's definitely a lot of chocolate in it for any chocolate lovers out there

* OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5
If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, theirs is worth a try. It has the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness. Just a slight crunch on the outside for some texture and chewy but not too soft on the inside

* BLUEBERRY CROISSANT ($3.75) - 5/5
My favorite of the pastries! Honestly it looked more like a danish than a croissant since it was pretty flat and had a ""filling"". It was basically a blueberry muffin in the center and croissant around it. Nice twist on a blueberry muffin! The muffin part was moist and the croissant part was light and airy.",ofZzcj1oiHS64f7jbGCXxQ,0,3,4,edQOzgjq8A3ItLJlkYP9wg

If I were to ever get the urge though, there's a pretty good chance it would be for a delicious, French macaron.  Well, other than ice cream of course.  Or a fresh, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  A thin one, with slightly crisp edges, a golden brown bottom, and a soft, chewy center with plenty of melted chocolate chips.  Yeaaaaahhhhh, that'd be good....wait, what was I talking about?

While most French bakeries offer up smaller, near bite-sized macarons, I love how Bouchon's are almost the size of your palm.  Even though that means you pay a little more for each cookie, it also means you have that much more to enjoy.  And enjoy you will, with a light, crisp exterior sandwiching a sweet and chewy filling.  Although I've yet to try the Pistacio flavor myself, I've heard plenty of good things about it from friends.  For me, my favorite has been their Espresso Macaron - loaded with a rich, coffee flavor, it won me over after just one bite.

Since this Bouchon Bakery is really more of an outlet/coffee stand in the Venetian (by the theater), the selection is smaller compared to what their actual ""bakery"" locations can offer.

(OK, my boss pays for the trip under the pretense of sending me to the Consumer Electronics Show- but he's really just making an effort to keep me on staff by paying for me to get my Bouchon macaroon fix.)

It's a little bakery stand in The Venetian.  You'll find a couple of locations scattered around.  There are two (one upstairs, one downstairs) up on the north end where there's a raised walkway across the strip to TI & Mirage.  I tend to go to the upstairs one, as it's on my walk over to the Expo center, and the CES shuttle busses to the LVCC.

I've seen a few walk-in closets bigger than the stand I frequent- but as long as it's big enough to hold the macaroons (and an attendant to sell them to me, along with a cup of coffee), that's all that matters.

The macaroons seem a little high-priced (but what in Vegas isn't?), but once you take a bit, you'll know instantly that you would pay more.  They're delicate and chewy all at the same time.  Not overly sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy a bakery craving.  The outer shell crumbles nicely, and the core is creamy and firm.

Right underneath the elevator in the Venetian is a small little bakery stand named Bouchon. I heard about this place from my friend Aileen A., who raved about its sister in Yountville, CA. I decided to eat something sweet after a nice big Lemon Chicken Piccata from the Grand Lux Cafe at Palazzo. 

My friends and I chose the fruit tart ($6.50), the chocolate eclair, the pain au chocolat, and the chocolate cupcake. The eclair was alright...it definitely wasn't as good as the eclairs at Chocolate Swan. The cupcake was a bit too rich, but had a nice chocolate mousse filling. The best one was the fruit tart with its vast array of fruits like cherries, melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, etc. The pineapple on it tasted like a wet rag, but everything else on it was delicious! I just love tart crust! YUM!

I took the pain au chocolat home with me, and decided to eat it for a late night snack. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Just enough dark chocolate with the perfect flakiness of the bread! Loved it!

I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who wants nice bakery goods. I can't wait to try Bouchon in Santa Barbara this weekend!

I grabbed a snack here EVERY DAY while we were partying up in Vegas. It also didn't help that I was staying in the Venetian just an elevators ride from the bakery...

Favorites were the chocolate eclairs and the ham and brie sandwich. The bf really enjoyed the bread pudding - it was still moist and had a yummy crunchy texture outside.

And I used to really dislike macroons - until Bouchon! Probably the reason this review got bumped from 4 stars to 5 stars - because I still dream about those damn chocolate macaroons.

They seem to be pretty popular as I've encountered a line each time, but it moves fast. I've tried a bunch of their baked good like cupcakes, chocolate croissants, danish, scones, sticky buns, beignets, cookies etc over my visits. All their products are fresh and taste great specially the sticky buns which are loaded with pecans and have a coating of caramelized sugar which balances the taste of the pecans very well still they tend to be on the sweet side. The cream danish on the other hand has only a mildly sweet filling that will appeal to people who don't want their deserts too sweet.

Thus far, I've tried their red velvet cupcake, a vanilla macaron, and of course, a few TKOs. Red velvet cupcake was good, but not the best I've had. The vanilla macaron, however, is one of the best I've had. They have the textures down nicely and a well-thought out balance of flavor. Not too subtle or overpowering. JUST right, which I can appreciate.

As for the TKO, I can tell you the exact setting of where I was when I last bit into one. The memory will stay with me forever.

My goal was to get my hands on their famous macarons. And yes, they were worth the trip and yes they were massive! At $3.50 per macaron or $17.50 for a box of 6 which included raspberry, caramel, vanilla, coffee, pistachio and chocolate. You can also buy 5 macarons of your choice and get 1 for free which obviously works out to the same price of $17.50 but you get to chose the flavours. Yeah, kinda pricey but macarons are hard to find in my city and a good maracon is even harder to find. I am use to smaller macarons, the Bouchon ones can be the size of a small palm. They are quite delicious - light and crisp exterior but full of flavour inside. My favourite is the pistachio but they're all great so get the box set.

The madeleine ($1 each) were quite yummy too. But I was disappointed with the croissant ($3.75), it wasn't as buttery as I wanted but very flakey. A surprise yum here was the mocha! OMG, their mocha is absolutely amazing - smooth espresso taste with a not too sweet, not too bitter chocolate. It was $4.75 for a small mocha and it was worth every penny!

The bakery is in the Venetian, right by the Phantom of the Opera theatre, just around the corner from the Grand Luxe Cafe and under a set of escalators. There's no seating dedicated to the bakery so it's basically a pick up and go place.",zPNrEv30Piqoig3YG4en2g,1,1,4,MkuirNW4Wyp62-XExmJHGQ

I would've given them 5 stars, but 2 things knocked them dow for me....price and flavor selection.

Macarons: fresh, soft, filled with flavor! Larger than typical macarons. Quality and freshness wise...best I've had so far!

Flavors: It changes from season to season. but they have their general flavors and usually a seasonal featured flavor.

What I've tried:
- Mint Chocolate Chip: delish! It was like eating a puffy andes mint! Mint and chocolate was balanced perfectly. Had to special order these puppies though, because they were out of season.

However, when I visited Bouchon again this week, I was disappointed in the size of the macarons. Their macaron size now is very inconsistent, some were larger than others, and overall, the macarons had shrunk. When I ordered a box back in June, all the macarons were in perfect uniformity. Now, some were small, while other flavors were larger.

I also tried the turkey sandwich, and fell in love. The bread has cranberries/raisins, and when toasted, it was a perfect complement to the turkey and brie cheese. I got this sandwich every morning and am still not sick of it.

When I went down the elevators from my hotel room, I spotted this little spot packed and busy. I came closer and saw what all the buzz was about. Delicious looking pastries, breads, desserts, and more delicacies! I figured it was a go! I really did not want to spend more than $6 like I did the night before on a small cappuccino at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf that was mediocre.

Out of all the flavors, salted caramel was definitely the best, then pistachio, chocolate, raspberry, and eggnog. All of the macarons were too crunchy for my liking. The shells were slightly dried out and didn't have the chewiness I like biting into. And the flavors themselves weren't that vibrant. I didn't feel like I got the pure taste of each flavor in the macarons sadly. 

Honestly such a let down but what saved the trip to Bouchon for me was the chocolate almond croissant. I never thought I could like a croissant so much, but this one hit the spot. Even though it took me a full 5 days to finish the croissant, I thoroughly enjoyed every chocolatey bite and correct me if I'm wrong but I think there was also a spread of coconut in between the flakey buttery layers. The croissant didn't go stale and tasted a million times better lightly toasted in the convection oven. 

So definitely come here for the chocolate almond croissant. Maybe swing by earlier in the day for fresher macarons?

When you first bite into this cookie you get the slight crunch of the outside shell then a cake like consistency, then chewy, and THEN the most heavenly center of anything that could be a center of goodness(if that makes sense).

GAH IT IS SOO GOOD when it hits your lips. 

My favorite flavors are the chocolate and vanilla. 

The chocolate has the most amazing ganache that melts as soon as it hits your tongue. Usually I think vanilla is too plain for me, but this is not the case here. You can see the vanilla beans from the pods and it is so light and sweet, just amazing.

My two favorites were the spiced pumpkin as well as the vanilla.  But were bomb.  Pistachio was good as well.

I didn't try the Bouchon restaurant or Oyster bar or anything else, just the bakery (and I visited the downstairs bakery). But I already love everything about this place. 

The coffee was delicious, including the lattes. The pastries all looked great. But the reason for coming here has to be the macarons. 

Wow! They are huge, and reasonably priced (and they often have some special going on- for July, it's buy one get one free for the chocolate-covered macarons). The light, crisp outside and the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth filling- delicious. My favorite was the vanilla macaron, followed I think by the pistachio. The salted caramel and coffee macarons are worth your time as well. I'm not as much of a fan of the berry flavors as others tend to be, but my colleagues told me that the raspberry was fantastic. This may just be because there are not a lot of mind-blowing macarons nearby where I live, but I've been disappointed in every one I've had since trying these (and even the good ones are so small compared to Bouchon's monster macarons!)

Fellow Yelper Vivian H. gave me the tip that the downstairs Bouchon Bakery (enter the Venetian, go right down the escalator) typically has shorter lines than the upstairs one, and you can grab a seat by/on the pretty fountain to chow down. So true!

I got a vanilla for myself, one coffee, and one chocolate. They were HUGE. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FpZ0Z9WfAehLwRn8TZlegw&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  Holy moly.

Great deep rich chocolate flavor without being overly sweet.  The texture is perfect as well as the outer shell is light and crunchy, the inside is soft and chewy with a beautiful chocolate center.

I always get macaroons whenever I see them and this place has the best.  Further, these are almost twice as big as regular macaroons.  Always, ALWAYS get a box of 6 because you get 1 free as it helps to alleviate the price a little even though macaroons are pricey everywhere (even for small ones).

I've also gotten the 3 pack of chocolate chip cookies and they were great also...good chocolate flavor and a nice texture.  The first time we tried the macaroons, we tried almost all the flavors...the other flavors were OK, but I can't recall any single flavor standing out except chocolate.

Anytime I'm up there I will wake up early, drive way out of my way...anything to get some Bouchon treats!  I'm such a huge fan.  When I found out they had a location in Vegas I dragged my boyfriend and a few friends out to find it.  When we got to the bakery I was a little disappointed because it was a small stand with a smaller selection, not a full store, but still so excited to pick out some tasty treats and get one of Bouchon's amazing sandwiches.  I stood at the glass cabinet like a kid on Christmas and picked out 5-7 of my favorite pastries and then a sandwich and a latte for my boyfriend and I to share.  They asked if I wanted it toasted and I said yes.  I paid and then stood at the counter waiting for our drink and the toasted sandwich. The drink came fairly quickly.  But then we waited...and waited...and waited...and no one was paying attention to us.  It was like that section of the counter was invisible. There wasn't that much of a line so after a lengthy wait I walked around to the front of the counter again and asked about the status of the sandwich. She handed me one that was wrapped sitting on the counter and I noticed it was not warm, but thought maybe it had cooled off from sitting for so long.  We found some seats in the mall and I took a bite..COLD all the way through. This had not been toasted at all.  I LOVE these sandwiches warm so I went back and stood in line AGAIN like I was going to order something (only way to get someone's attention) and when I got to the counter asked the woman if she would mind toasting it because it did not feel toasted at all.  She took the sandwich from me and put it on the counter, looked at me, and then fished through some receipts on the counter and said ""You didn't pay for this."" ??!! I paid you, I bought all this stuff I'm holding! ""No, you didn't pay for the sandwich, only the other stuff.""  Apparently she forgot to ring up the sandwich and was now acting like I stole it. Really? I'm just trying to get a sandwich and some pastries, she made a mistake, and now I'm a criminal.  Outrageous.  I didn't notice that she forgot to ring it up because I purchased so many small items that my bill added up to $40-$50 and it seemed like the right amount!! She didn't even apologize for her mistake, I would have paid the extra, but she acted like I was trying to rob them so I just threw my hands up and walked away with the pastries I purchased to find lunch somewhere else.

Pistachio: The pistachio flavor was good, but the cream inside was oily and not good at all.

Vanilla: Fake vanilla taste, almost coconutty and not good at all.

Coffee: Not bad, pretty normal. 

Overall, I would definitely rather go to other places (like Payard) for macarons, but I guess drinks are good enough.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,1,0,2,FiKV0GH1LBl_mjjQb5JEEw

It wasn't until this past weekend I was in Vegas that I got to taste the sweet macarons once again. They were and still are the best macarons I've ever had. They're large, the cream is smooth and light, and the cookies are flaky but packed with flavor. My mom loves these and says they are the best she's ever had, too. I regret not getting more boxes of these and also trying more of their other baked goods. Until next time!",vRRZbOGmmO2bi7IPLeurvA,1,1,5,dt6JrCvrrBjOst43VwiZQQ

tried 6 of their macarons flavors and most if not all taste fresh in terms of flavor. they all tasted somewhat artificial! 
definitely something you try once to see for yourself and can say that you've tried it before but never go back for more type of dealio. There are better macaron places out there.
Their chocolate chip cookies are good but then again, how wrong can you go with chocolate chip cookies? haha",XqmISkEvoUQ0ECK-qFQ1Kw,1,1,2,JabsXa0QXKC53NMCYQLHEg

My chocolate almond croissant was amazzzzing but my mocha was just ok and I had to go back to re-ask for whipped cream because the barista forgot. 

Glad I was finally able to try Bouchon Bakery even if I did pass on the macaroons, but I wouldn't say its a must have in Vegas considering all the other delicious things nearby.",L8PRZYJ-Xpux56ChOAqgZA,0,0,3,c6dCMG_Sl3TEEFnhuy5k4w

The red velvet cake was very good too.  I also tried the carrot cake cookie which was more like two soft carrot cake muffin tops with cream cheese filling inside...yummy.

For some reason, the plain croissant and the pain au raisin tasted stale and dry that day.  We purchased it around 11 am...bummer, we had to throw most of it away.",1uIP-Tn0owmL7-yeZQ9ZIg,1,0,4,1ROambGiXYBblaegjrPemw

I'm still dreaming about the red velvet cupcake with the humongous filling on the top with the red sparkly glitter.  Bouchon makes Sprinkles cupcakes taste like recycled plastic brown bags.

The most memorable items are the French macaroons. They are larger and flatter than macaroons from other places. I had to resist myself and only get two, raspberry and pistachio. The raspberry was delicious, but a little on the sweet end. The pistachio was nutty and more true to a real pistachio flavor than most macaroons. 

The apple croissant was flaky on the outside and full of apples and crumbs on the inside. 

Bouchon: These were a lot smaller than I had expected and more like a brownie than a fluffy cake that I expected. The ""brownie"" was very rich and delicious!

Pricy, yes, but worth every penny. Most recently I discovered the TKOs and that is precisely what they did, packing quite a punch on my taste buds.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,8,5,zcLpwseBE52zdpMXhi8NSg

I wanted my niece to try this place because she loves macarons.  She got a 6-pack of macarons.  raspberry, pistachio, strawberry lemonade, coffee, vanilla bean, and salted caramel.  The coffee and the pistachio were the best tasting flavors.  The others were good, but not as good.

We did try a few other baked goods here, but I cannot recall the exact names of them anymore.  I do remember that they all tasted quite good though.  Surprisingly, the prices were very reasonable as well.

But I can't give them more than 3 stars. I expected way more pastries and my pecan roll was good, but nothing to swoon over.

So, A-OK it is. Would be nicer if it was a little cheaper and the seating was closer. We ended up getting lost looking for a place to sit and just ended up at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf upstairs. But definitely a nice little quick breakfast if your buffet the night before left you more bloated than old Elvis.",P7git5lUc--3lmX4KA2hng,0,0,3,8kEmIuzStbdxnacvkKmGRw

However, I was a little disappointed with my visit here. I decided on the red velvet cupcake and a caramel macchiato. For $3.50, the cupcake was a good deal for it was the size of a muffin! Most cupcakes I've had are for the same price but pretty dinky in size. The frosting wasn't overly sweet and the red velvet was nice and moist. It was a tad bit doughy though, but nonetheless pretty good. The coffee however, is where things start going downhill. Maybe I came on a bad day or maybe it was a new worker, but I've had caramel macchiato before at various coffee places and never had I had one like this. For $5 I got their smallest size and when I picked up my cup, I was surprised at how light my cup was compared to the other girls that ordered other Lattes and such. I opened my cup and found it to be filled halfway with foam, barely any coffee so I asked the barista if it was the correct order. He just kept saying that that's how it's suppose to be. It didn't seem right, but in any case, I didn't make a scene about it. $5 for half a cup of bitter coffee and foam is not well worth it! They also have a few other things there like sandwiches and such, but all were a bit pricey. Expected I suppose since it is Vegas.",-bj4evSejxRDuvYnmcGNrg,0,0,2,FSJxtRmqjfbe6RjOL-WuPw

They have all the baked goods that the other locations have. I was surprised, though, that I did not find the coffee as good as when I went to their main sit-down location two days prior. It tasted a little burnt, maybe? It was certainly drinkable but not as divine.

Either way, I would not hesitate to come back to this location, as it was fast and more central to the casino happenings. It doesn't have the same ambiance as the other locations, of course, but it's great if you're on the go.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,7,6,4,RWiSsTvrqfO3AJFg9EJT9w
