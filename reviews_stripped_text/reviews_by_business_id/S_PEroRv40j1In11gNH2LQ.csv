144853,2013-11-11,0,S_PEroRv40j1In11gNH2LQ,"I was once asked during a job interview how I handle stress and my answer was ""potato chips.""  Not the healthiest response, but it is illustrative of my love of potatoes.  Until today, I thought it extended to all forms, but I was mistaken.  I do not love the fries at Five Guys.  They were plain and mushy.  The best part was the ketchup.

I had the grilled cheese, so I can't comment on the burgers.  The grilled cheese was sad and I didn't finish it.  The soda machine stressed me out.  The whole experience made me miss Create (the place that used to be there) and question President Obama's judgment when it comes to fast food.

I gave it two stars because it was clean and the girl working the cash register was very nice.  I won't be going back.",5i8ceYJVyYYT2vzl0Bc48g,0,0,2,FzY25KcA-cgkkxtfPf_4KA

904891,2013-02-19,0,S_PEroRv40j1In11gNH2LQ,"As a local Californian, I'd been hearing rumblings for quite some time that there was a new game in town-- that my beloved In-N-Out had competition in the form of Five Guys.  Well, I finally gave Five Guys a shot when we went out to Vegas a few months ago.  

There is no comparison to In-N-Out.  None.  (Other than maybe the color scheme).  

In-N-Out wins, 10 hands down.  (That's all of the hands of each of the 5 guys.)  

I will give Five Guys credit for excellent customer service.  Employees are attentive and walk around to check up on whether you need anything.  

The soda machine is the best.  It's like a video game.  You can concoct thousands of different soda combinations. (Pick your ""base soda"" of Sprite/Diet Sprite/Coke/Diet Coke/Root Beer etc. and then add flavors orange/lemon/lime/strawberry/peach etc.)

As for the burger, it is no In-N-Out burger,  The burger here was just ""OK"" for me.  It tasted more like a Whopper, if I had to compare it to another chain restaurant burger, and I didn't care for it at all.  The bun got kind of soggy.  There are quite a few topping options, to customize your burger.  My husband enjoyed getting jalapenos on his burger.   

The free peanuts were a nice touch.  It's nice to nom nom on them while you wait for your food.

I'm glad I went, so I could finally put to rest my curiosity about this place.  I won't rule this place out for a return visit, but it won't be at the top of my list.",IoBj-2_XaOx3AZljDKvdlA,0,0,3,RYvrAqDwD1sR_ob1_YCxVg

I can tell you this, the atmosphere with the workers is definitely a better one and the management definitely took care of me with the given situation.
Over a year ago, on two separate occasions they had messed my order up. First time I ordered in person, when I paid my orders were correct on screen, but when placed in the bags, the stickers on the burgers did not match the tickets outside the bag, and unfortunately, with hungry children, they just start grabbing & eating whatever they thought was theirs. The second time the order was placed online, I had to wait 30 minutes for pick up, that was fine we had at least 6 burgers  again, when I got there of course it wasn't ready, and management didn't do anything to acknowledge that. I ended up waiting another 30 minutes, even tho I told them to make sure the burgers are marked correctly, the same issue happened. thank God that manager is no longer there. I complained on the website & the district manager responded & offered to replace a third of the meal. I love the burgers, but not enough to experience the same customer service hence the reason for not returning.
 Most  places  only  honor  offers  like these  for a  limited  time. I  explained  to situation  to  the new  manager &  he  understood  and  made  sure  we  were  taken  care  of and  he  did  just that.  finally  no  more  in &  out  for  us  when we  want good  burgers =)",DB52-ldxRed6JpdtE6yUMg,1,0,5,A15DOGDA214ZRlyodi4StQ

Five Guys has a nice concept.  You can really customize your burger with whichever toppings you would like and even customize your soda.  Everything tasted fresh and service was extremely friendly - someone checked on our table twice to see if we needed anything.  I had sauteed onions, bacon and BBQ sauce.  The bacon was crisp and generous, but the bun, though soft, was less substantial than I like for my burger.  The fries were a great texture, though I didn't personally care for the cajun seasoning and would get plain if I returned.

In all, not a gourmet burger, but a step up from strictly fast food.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,4,1,3,nZ8mbPQc88iUxWuBDARQPw

We were a little ahead of the dinner crowd so the place was empty of customers.  The staff created us right away as they were busy preparing for the big rush.  The staff was helpful in explaining a few items.  Order taken and was ready in about 5-10 minutes.  We both had the ""little cheeseburgers"".  Little is a quarter pounder, and a ""cheeseburger"" has two beef patties.  
We shared a large order of fries.  The burgers were very tasty and the fries also.  You can customize your burger with about ten different toppings which are no additional charge.  

Overall it is a very good burger joint, and it is very clean.  You can also have she'll peanuts for free while wSiting for your order.

Update 1/11-2017********

Second visit much different.  I will say the employees were great.  Lady taking order gave us free fries when we related that our previous visit fries were very salty.  Also, she said she would go turn the air conditioning off.  It was extremely cold in the restaurant.  Food cane out and was cold almost immediately due to temp in building.  Meat was overlooked and dry on my little cheeseburger.  Also the cheese was missing.  Did not take it back to counter.  I would compare it to a run of the mill Burger King whopper.  Fries were good.

At first I was a little excited that you practically get to customize your burger with unlimited toppings, I think that was probably the best part so needless to say I was disappointed.  

I felt it was a little overpriced, I got the 'tiny/small' burger and 'tiny/small' fries, no drink , just water, and it still came out to a little over $8??? And there's no combo options whatsoever.

Now when I got my burger I was looking forward to eating it, however, with every bite, the extra ingredients kept falling out!! At first I'd put it back in then eventually I gave up and resorted to getting a fork so I could take a bite then pick up the fixins after.  It was very sloppy and messy.  Also, the patty tasted pretty bland, maybe I was just expecting a lot more since the price was above average.

The fries were on point though.  Ok, so two things good, the customization of burgers and fries.",vPEyTMUVv66T8LoSsufYtg,2,0,2,P9ijDg_YSawyqMM2gxrEfw

The place gives off a genuine atmosphere, the employees are really nice and are all about real american food.

I got an egg on my burger and that egg must have come from a Pterodactyl it was so old. I would often lay in bed at night thinking, ""If only a group of men would come and offer me a tasty burger"" and sure enough baby jesus answered my prayers and Five Guys came to the rescue. 

I used to live in DC so I was familiar with their work and went there immediately. Obviously five guys is a chain but oftentimes chains will have varying degrees of quality- the food is still made by humans(... for now) and so there can be huge differences in quality. This Five Guys is probably one of the better ones I have been to, I will give a few examples of what I mean

1. Online ordering- when I ordered online the first time it said ""your food will be ready in 8 minutes"" - usually a claim like that results in me getting to the place on time and then waiting 20 minutes for my food. Not so here- I got there in 7 minutes and by the time I had finished my drink my food was ready. The last thing they did as I was waiting for my bag was fill my cup of fries- and then dump an additional scoop of fries into the bag for no reason other than awesome. 

2. I am waiting in line for my food and I realize due to a miscommunication they have given me a burger with no cheese. I bring this up and they fixed it without charge - and in fact gave me extra cheese. 

3. 300 flavor coke machine.

As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were met with ice cold freezing temperature in the building. We were all cold before we even got to the register to order. The ac was on full blast belting out cold air, yet it was cold outside. 

As our food came it was instantly cold because of the temperature of the air in the building. Most of the tables that could for our crowd had the ac vent right above is making our experience even worse. Most of us were so cold we were shivering or bundled up as if we were ready to play in the snow. 

Our hamburgers were tasteless with zero seasonings on the patties. I had to eat multiple pickles and onions just to get any sense of flavor to finish the burger. This was my first time at Five Guys and I can say I'm highly disappointed. 

The staff was amusing in the beginning but they were beyond loud by the time we left. You could hear them and they were being highly inappropriate for it being a public establishment with child present. The manager was also very active in the inappropriate content of their conversation. By the end of our meal we heard what sounded like a dog barking and screeching in their vicinity. Myself and everyone in my party looked at each other to actually try to figure out if they had a dog behind the counter. That's how real it sounded. Nope it was an employee acting db making noises. It was not a joyful relaxed experience at all. 

I even walked into the bathroom to try to defrost my fingers after eating, by placing them in hot water. Needless to say I was disappointed when all they had was cold water to wash my hands. It was nicer outside than it was in the building. It should have been the opposite feeling. After reading reviews it seems the temperature inside has been an issue before. 

All I know is I will never be back to Five Guys again, even if it's that's last burger joint standing.",4SYG0-U7kHIvNGgqEGgsyg,0,0,1,KyrOqmKykF-ay1nVgzOJRQ

Given that it just opened, it's clean and inviting, and the staff is welcoming and enthusiastic. The manager seemed to very much be on top of quality control for the food that went out.

I ordered:
1 regular-size bacon cheeseburger (2 patties), with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, jalapenos, and steak sauce
1 regular-size order of fries (good for 2-3 people, easily)
1 large drink

The burger was juicy and delicious, without being overly greasy. Their patties aren't too large, so their standard 2 patties are about the equivalent of one regular-sized Smashburger. I would've preferred a bit more sauce, but they don't go so heavy on the toppings that it overpowers the burger's flavor.

The fries were fresh from the fryer, and although they ostensibly put them in a large cup, as is standard with Five Guys, they pretty much overfill the cup and fill up the entire bottom half of the bag with fries. Great if you love fries, and their fries are really good (I love skin-on fries), but don't expect to finish them all by yourself.

They use a dial-a-drink soda machine, which I love for the variety and customizability, and I like to take advantage of that by getting drinks you don't find everywhere - in this case, Cherry Vanilla Mr. Pibb Zero.

Overall, I had a good experience. This Five Guys location is definitely better than their Henderson location (maybe because it's newly-opened?), and it'll be good competition for Smashburger and In-N-Out right down the road.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,5,0,4,kuMzTSdMG8Q4JIkgRXKkmQ

My boyfriend also ordered the Cajun fries and I was kind of hesitant at first because I thought the Cajun seasoning was going to burn my mouth. Well it didn't.

The store manager was anxious to know if we had a good experience and really went out of her way to get feedback, which I gladly gave.

I'm a huge fan of Five Guys fries.  A trick to ensure that yours don't get soggy is to dump them into the bag your meal came in, then tear off one of the sides of the bag.  By doing this your fries can breathe and won't sweat (making them soggy), thereby staying nice and crisp .

1 Cheeseburger all the way, no mayo.
1 Regular fry
1 regular drink

I normally only give one star reviews to restaurants who had bad food or service and failed to try to correct the problem. In this case it's the business model that gets the bad review.

     I ordered a regular cheese burger meal and told the girl to large size the fries and drink. ""$15.69 please"" she said. I was sure I heard her wrong until I looked at the register screen. So I pay the ticket and start to watch them do their thing. When the food came up the fry cook shoveled a whole basket of loose French fries on top of my food in the bag. ""Why did you do that""? I asked. ""That's the Five Guys way"" he replied. Even before he handed me the bag I could see the oil seeping through. (Picture Attached)

     When I got home to eat my food I had to remove an oil soaked burger from a mountain of loose french fries. My hand was literally wet from the oil........Gross City!

     Five Guys misses it in the three most important area of quick serve food, Price Point, Speed of Service and Presentation. $6.99 hamburgers, $4.99 French Fries and $2.49 sodas are not going to drive sales in this competitive market. Throw into the mix, made to order food you have to wait on that has oily french fries on top of it, and you get a pretty miserable experience. Their name and logo isn't even on their packaging.

The drink machine was one of the mega machines, either had cherry Dr. Pepper or Cherry Mr. Pibb, whichever one they had there, I like that, gave an extra half a star for it.

The burger was good, it was a thick patty, by today's standard, as such to get the middle cooked enough for health reasons, the outside is overly done.

I ordered a small order of fries, they put them in a little cup, put that in the sack with the burger, then pour three times as many fries over the top of the burger in the bag. Tons of fries, I didn't finish half of them, I didn't care for them. If I had to point out the low point, it would be the fries, although they're fried, the texture was like they were steamed. No crispness, soggy, just a mess. If the fries weren't so pathetic, this could have been a 4 star review, 

They give you all the roasted peanuts, in the shell, you want, gratis. They were very good. I was a bit surprised by the peanuts. With the public uproar about peanut allergies, I'm impressed with them serving peanuts. If those fries weren't so bad, I would have given 4 stars just for standing up to the PC peanut people.

There's only a few choices and the burgers can be ordered with any number/combination of toppings you choose.

When it comes to the burger, I can't think of any fast food burger in town that I like more. I get mine somewhat simple and order the bacon double with grilled onions & mushrooms, mustard, jalapenos and extra cheese. When they make it right, which they usually do, this is a ridiculously good burger. The meat is tender, juicy, flavorful and reminds me of a homemade, grilled burger. For a fast food joint, the toppings always seem extremely fresh and they have really good jalapenos. The fries are also super tasty, both the Five Guys style and Cajun style. 

As a fast food spot, they'd easily deserve 5 stars if the prices weren't so high. It's not hard to spend over $20 for two people, even when sharing fries and a drink.

My wife and I each had the standard cheeseburger and they were magnificent.  Juicy, tasty and delicious.  Veggie toppings were fresh and crisp.  Our fries were perfect too (I had cajun, the wife had regular fries).  A ""little"" serving of these was tons (next time we'll share one).  

I also want to comment on the outstanding customer service.  When we walked up to the counter we were greeted with a smile and our order was quickly taken.  Loved the fancy coke machines and it's variety of drinks (especially diet options - yeah I know its crazy to pair a diet drink with a burger and fries, but regular soda is too sweet for my tastes).  Place was clean too - immaculately so.  While I waited for the food, my wife took our drinks outside.  During the brief wait one of the folks working in the seating area asked if I'd like some peanuts and a cup for water.  I accepted the peanuts, but when I mentioned my wife had my drink outside so I didn't need the water she took my wife a cup of peanuts as well.  Just amazing service.  

My only complaint? I wish there was a tip line on the receipt.  I almost never carry cash, and I would have liked to leave a tip for these great workers.  No that I know, I'll be sure to bring in some cash next time.

5 Guys makes a good burger,  but its not as good as In N Out. It's  not as good as Tommy's.  It 's not as good as any number of places here in Vegas. Why ?  While the burgers are big - they simply lack in FLAVOR,  in my opinion. In N Out,  Tommy 's,  and Fatburger have flavor - their own unique flavors. You know it when you taste it.

I don't fault the overall construction of the burgers,  but the patty tastes bland to me.

To the fries. Overkill, if you get a regular size and your by yourself. A regular size order will feed two easily. If you go by yourself - try the small. The Cajun fries are not hot,  the spices are Very mild in my opinion. The free salted peanuts you can eat while waiting are actually  ( for me anyway )  better than the fries.

We've been hearing mixed things about Five Guys and here's my take...

Service: LaWanda gave us stellar service from start to finish after hearing that it was our first time. Burger prices, burger breakdown, and ENDLESS TOPPINGS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!?!? COOL!

Peanuts: Who else gives you AYCE Peanuts waiting for your order, and after you finish your meal if you have room? Five Guys does!

Fries: Freshly made, Potatoes come from different states, and this day, the fries were made from potatoes out of Idaho...

Freestyle Coke Machine: Coke products...endless combinations...nuff' said!

Great meal, Great prices, and its as if we were watching ""Good Burger"" in real life with LaWanda and the rest of the crew, just enjoying serving customers always with a smile.

I did some research and found that this is a recurring theme with Five Guy burgers, which is really disappointing considering how delicious that one, good bite was.

I often tell my wife ""Stick With Me, We'll find god places to eat.""

In my first review of Five Guys (The one in Salinas, California) I made mention of how much my wife liked going. (This was her first time) I lived in Northern Virginia from 1980 - 2005 so Five Guys, I am very familiar with them.

On Thursday, October 23, 2015 my wife and I were running errrands and it was around lunchtime so I asked my wife the following:
""Wife"", I said ""What would you like for lunch.""
without missing a beat she replied, ""I want to eat Five Guys"".

She had her heart set on their cajun style french fries.
She also loves how she can order whatever she wants on her burger.

Me I just plain love the food.

This store in Las Vegas however, very noticably, had the best service. Greeted mere moments as we walked inside. Greeted again at the counter. Someone cleaning the dining room asked how things were. 

On the walls of the dining room, are pictures of older magazine articles about Five Guys. Being from Alexandria, Virginia I wanted to look and check them out. I was near the front counter looking at one when the same person who greeted and took our order asked me ""Are you ordering more?""

I replied no, I am from Alexandria and actually has been to some of the original stores. I actually heard one of the cooks say ""wow.""

Great food and great service, thank you Five Guys.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,1,1,5,EWRJ1daw_ur85FmsuNA4qw

Now this one is SUPER CLOSE to my home, a five minute drive away.  When I'm feelin' greasy cheesy...I can head over to this Five Guys for a fix!

This Five Guys is just like every other Five Guys here in Vegas.  Burgers.  Fries.  Free peanuts.  And that damn cool Coca Cola machine (which is more like a robot) that serves umpteenthousand combinations of your favorite sodas and soft drinks.  I like it!

Yes, Five Guys remarkable reminds one of another great burger joint in Vegas, In N Out Burger.  While the premise is similar, the reality is far different.  I love, love, love In N Out (UNLV memories abound) but Five Guys brings in a beacon of change!  You can eat hearty for a measly pennance.  If you leave here NOT full, it's totally your fault.

The menu is pretty straight forward with burgers, cheeseburgers, bacon burgers, and bacon cheeseburgers.  Burgers come standard at close to a half pound, or you can opt for you burger in 'little' which comes in closer to a quarter pound.  Either way, with your toppings your possibilities are almost ENDLESS!  You can create about 250,000 combinations with the choices of free toppings offered:

-Mayo
-Lettuce
-Pickles
-Tomatoes
-Grilled onions/regular onions
-Grilled mushrooms
-Ketchup
-Mustard
-Relish
-Jalapeno
-Green peppers
-A1
-BBQ sauce
-Hot sauce

You like change?  Go for it!  The world is your oyster.  I personally love grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo, and A1 on mine!  Flavor city my friends.  Some folks are purists and love just meat, cheese, bun, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  But folks like me go all out and do a little bit of everything.  Luckily the burgers aren't frozen but fresh, and grilled right in front of you.  So they taste pretty damn good!  Burgers here don't come with fries so don't forget to order a large cup of these hand-cut beauties.  I really do like the cajun style, and they are great to dip in malt vinegar!  But ketchup will do as well.  And while you're waiting for your order, don't forget to grab a tray of free roasted peanuts for snacking!  Do like some folks and take an entire paper bag home!  

With a burger, fries, and a regular drink, depending on your burger and the size of your fries and drink, it will set you back around $9.  Nope, not the cheapest by any means but still change for what you're getting.  This burger could probably count for 2 meals if you really wanted it to (I particularly don't because I'm a piggy).  And compared to a night at a Gordon Ramsay pub?  A steal!

Five Guys also does hot dogs and a few sandwiches like a grilled cheese and a BLT.  But I say stick with the burgers for a sure thing.  

Service here is always quick, but I never feel rushed especially when I decide all those toppings I want on my burger.  The wait is not usually long except maybe during some lunch rush hours.  I hungrily anticipate that brown paper bag with the oil stain just seeping through the paper.  Goodness ensues!  And a run on the treadmill too.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,1,4,2qak8VktO0z2Ns1qm696VQ

It's a very good thing that you can add any toppings for no additional charge but I feel like they need to season the hamburger meat. So far every time I have been here the meat has been very bland and tasteless. I NEVER get onions on anything, but yet I was very turned off because everything on my burger tasted like a raw onion and come to find out there was one on there so I had to throw the rest away because I can't get past that taste.  The fries were very over done and burned on the ends but at least it was fresh oil unlike other food places I have been to. 
One concern I had is that while sitting and enjoying my time with my family there was an employee just wondering around all lost while customers were near the counter, but when they leave she is back up at the counter talking and normally I don't care but I could hear the whole conversation and some things should not have been said out loud. Basically airing her dirty laundry. 
My 2 last concerns is that when you are sitting there, you shouldn't hear the employees constantly yelling YEP YEP YEP. It gets annoying very fast. Especially when it gets louder and louder.

4142685,2013-08-26,7,S_PEroRv40j1In11gNH2LQ,"Oh me, oh my, there is a Five Guys near me now!  Oh happy day!

We were heading over to a different place for lunch when we saw that a Five Guys had moved in next door.  Sorry other place, you just got bumped for Five Guys!

First let me tell you that I am a burger lover.  I am always trying to find a great burger wherever I  am.  When I was in Kenya a couple of years back, I almost died because there weren't burger places in the Safari-lands.  I went 3 weeks without a burger and almost died, I swear!  So whenever I find a great burger joint, it makes my day and I love to spread the word.

So we walked into the store and all you can smell is wonderful, meaty goodness.  I knew my mind was about to be blown and boy was it!  We walked up to order and that is when I saw the wall of options you can get on your burger for no extra charge.  You can go simple or crazy and everything is the same price.  I love condiments, so I was really happy with the extra options like A1, BBQ, and hot sauce.  Life needs spice, so might as well add it to the burger, right?

We waited a few minutes for our burgers and that is when I saw the Coca-Cola machine of my dreams.  So many options to customize your drink.  I love soda, almost as much as burgers, so I was in heaven.  It was almost overwhelming to have so many options.  I was just happy that I was able to try out several different soda combinations during our visit.  I think I drank my entire month's allotment of soda during this one visit, but it was worth it baby!

And then the fun began because our burgers were ready.  The first bite of my delicious burger made me see stars, in a good way.  I even chewed slowly to make the moment last longer.  I had juices and sauces all over my face and running down my hands, but I was in love.  Sorry hubby, the burger may have bumped ahead of you on my love meter!

Now every burger needs some fries and the fires here do the job well!  They do a cute thing here by posting where the potatoes that your fries are made out of were grown.  It is fun to know such a little detail.  My fries came from Boise, ID, in case you were wondering.  We each got an order of the Five Guys Style and the Cajun flavor and loved both of them, but we only needed one order between the 3 of us.  I think one order would feed a small family, so keep that in mind when you order your fries.  They were great fries though.  You can tell that they are fresh cut and fried right away.  They were yummy and delightful.

Another thing I really liked was that they label each burger.  It is nice just to look for your burger # on the top of the burger, than having to open each lovely present to check and see if it is yours or not.  Great idea Five Guys!

So yes, I have a new burger place for when I am on the go.  I am lucky that one isn't too too close, otherwise I might end up being 500lbs.  If you haven't tried Five Guys, go do it now!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,9,7,5,x1CTnSiXecnWZDsIy5FKkQ

The burgers are so remarkably fresh when compared to other fast food burger destinations. They make a good burger with a smile on every face behind the counter and that puts a smile on my face too.  Five Guys runs a good business and they do it without the help of sexy girls making a mess, clowns, large headed watchamacallits meant to jump out of boxes, creepy kings, obnoxious redheads and talking chihuahuas like some fast food places. They stand alone and offer up an amazing experience. I appreciate that a burger can be customized as I please and that it is not an inconvenience to them. Tonight I had a cheese burger (two patties) with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, grilled mushrooms, mayo and ketchup. It was messy and delicious as a good burger should be. I only wish the mushrooms were fresh instead if canned (I think they are canned). I also appreciate that there are two kinds of fries, regular and cajun, though I don't actually care for the fries. But if I did I would be thrilled with how many fries they give you. A bag with whatever size you ordered plus an additional scoop on top of that. Fantastic.

So here's the low down you can have a single(little) or double cheese or hamburger each meat patty is 1/3lb. There's a huge list of toppings to choose from, my gotos being extra extra shrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and mayo. Normal! You can also get steak sauce, BBQ sauce, relish, jalapeños, and many others! Now the fries!! They're made fresh and you can have regular or Cajun seasoning. I get regular with a side of Cajun and mix it into my ketchup for dipping yuuuum!

The burgers here are pretty good. They're cooked well, the toppings are good, and they're pretty big. The regular order of fries is way too big for me, so I try to stay away from it. The cool soda machine that allows for a million drink combinations is pretty cool, though I always end up with Sprite and peach flavor. IDK. In short, I like the food here. 

So why three stars? This place is expensive for what it is. It's a little burger joint, NBD, located close to an In N Out and Smashburger. Both places serve amazing burgers for better prices. I went to Five Guys a few days ago and spent $24 on two burgers and two fries. Seriously. I coulda gone to Applebee's and done their 2-for-$20 deal I love so much.

4655120,2012-10-01,2,S_PEroRv40j1In11gNH2LQ,"Last night was a pivotal moment in my fast food dining experiences. I finally tried Five Guys Burgers.

  Five Guys burgers taste superior to the burger chains. It ought to considering that a cheeseburger, medium fries, and medium coke is approximately $12.

  This is why I am a fan of Five Guys food. The thick and juicy cheeseburger that is cooked in front of you is favorable to the tastebuds. With the exception of beacon, the toppings are complimentary.  The fries that are served in a cup are quality. Five Guys stands by their fries and proudly displays where they came from. There is not a few choices of fountain Coke A Cola. There are 108 flavors. I recommend Peach  Fanta and Strawberry Sprite. For the record, before you order, you have the option of filling a cup with complimentary peanuts.

  If you don't have a headache, Five Guys is an upbeat environment. The food is prepared in front of your eyes. The cooks get really into it and scream out the orders when they are ready for you to pick up. They communicate out loud when they cook the food. I would hear them shouting out the famous John Belushi catch phrase, ""cheeseburger cheeseburger."" Depending if you have a headache and your mood, the yelling in the open kitchen can be entertaining or it can be annoying. The best thing happening in the kitchen is the food being prepared in front of you.

  The dining area is brightly lit. The walls display framed accolades on Five Guys from major newspapers. The restaurant has sufficient seating and two Coke machines.

  When you add the service and lower the price Five Guys is worthy of four stars. The employees were helpful, put on a good show in the open kitchen, and were friendly to the point of showing me where an electric outlet was and volunteering to dump our trash.

   Five Guys is pricey. If it was less expensive it would be 4 stars. As it currently stands I rate Five Guys 3 &1/2 stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,5,2,3,uWsOKw1NAri5ILjzfbV-SQ

The thing I like is that the burgers are juicy but I kinda don't like it being wrapped in foil since if you're not eating it right away, it will get smashed and soggy. This I feel is more of a eat here fresh burger and not take out. I like getting A-1, mushrooms, onions and fresh jalapenos on mine. It's my favorite combo of toppings to do at home and glad theres a place I can have it made when I don't feel like grilling myself. 

The thing I like best though is the fries. I like semi thick, somewhat crunchy somewhat soft inbetween fries. I don't know why, but I can eat just a bag of fries and be perfectly content. 

The only minus is no brewed ice tea and while the soda machine is novelty cool, I actually don't drink soda.

I have been to Five Guys 4 times now. I first tried it in Alabama, now here in Vegas. What I like most about this place is it's usually very clean, fast/good service and the food is good. 

The best thing in my opinion is the buns. I usually don't like really soft buns, but they are good and they toast the inside. This place is awesome because you can choose whatever you want to put on the burger unlike most places, where you have to ask to have things taken off. The also have fresh beef, never frozen. The patties are very tasty, I just they would come a little more rare. 
A lot of people love the fries, and they are good...but I am a thin fry kind of girl. But they do have malt vinegar to dip your fries in, which is really good. 

If you haven't tried this place yet, you should. If you like In and Out, you'll like this place as well. But oddly enough, I'm not a fan of In and Out.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,5,2,3,5b5SWdZPribzQfA-oUaFdQ

5204583,2012-10-01,0,S_PEroRv40j1In11gNH2LQ,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I did not get a burger... at a burger joint. I know dumb idea to expect a good grilled cheese sandwich, but they had not one but two menu items for grilled cheese sandwiches!

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with sautéed onions and mushrooms and a side of french fries. Despite getting regular size fries, the girl dishing out the fries scooped up an extra bit and tossed it in the bag as well. That's about as far as the compliments go in this review.

I really wish I had anything positive to say about the sandwich, but it was pretty terrible all around. The cheese was soft and gooey like a nacho cheese, but lacking in any flavor. In fact 20 minutes later after the cheese had cooled off the cheese was exactly the same consistency. If they use the same cheese for the cheeseburgers, then I can't imagine anyone giving this place high marks. Additionally the bun/bread or whatever it was was soggy with grease and tasteless.

Maybe the burgers here are amazing (though I have serious doubts), but the grilled cheese sandwich left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I will be staying far away from this place.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,1,0,1,3oLVq6kbVFUsEFxDcT1yxA

I always laugh when I walk in look at the location and say the fries last week from Barron County Wisconsin were so good I hope these guys from .....Idaho can compete;  I always get a surprised look from the people around me in line and its hilarious. 

The burgers are top notch and unless you are starving only go for a single; anything else is going to be way to much. Oh yeah and if you are there with friends only order one fry for two people.  They fill up the cup; put it into a bag and then add another scoop on top of that. 

The last time I was there I tried one of their hot dogs and it was top notch and if I can't find my new favorite Food Truck I will be coming here for a hotdog;  
I've told this story a few times as well when asked about this restaurant and it goes to show you how good their food is here; when this chain came to Omaha it was a 30 minute drive from my side of town.
