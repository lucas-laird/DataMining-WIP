My salad was really fresh and I liked that they had some different topping choices, such as cucumbers, black olives and sauteed mushrooms.  (I'm used to Zabas or Chipotle that pretty much only offer salsa and some peppers). My steak was really tender -- juicy enough that I didn't even use any of my salad dressing. 

The facilities were clean and there was plenty of comfortable seating.  I also thought the pricing was fair for the amount of food given.  The staff could have been a bit more friendly, but sadly that's pretty much the norm in Vegas.

622041,2014-11-04,4,o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA,"I have to start this review by letting everyone know how excited I am that a Moe's opened in Las Vegas! I'm from the east coast where they have quite a few Moe's! I used to eat there faithfully. So when I found out about this particular opening, I was thrilled. 

I have been ordering a to go lunch every single Saturday since it has opened! And have not once been disappointed by the food. I love the many options that you can pick from, nachos, bowls, burritos, salads, quesadillas, tacos and even something called a stack! I always end up ordering the vegetable band camp burrito bowl. I like the funky names for each option. 

In my amazing band camp bowl, I always get extra rice, lots of grilled green peppers and onions, corn, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pickled and fresh jalape√±os (A+ for having both!) and the famous queso dip on the side! I tried a sample of the black and pinto beans! I think next time I order a veggie bowl, I will add pinto beans for something different! 

I love that Moe's is so vegetarian and vegan friendly!!! Both pinto and black beans are vegetarian, they offer tofu for a little extra cost, and they use vegetarian cheeses and sour cream! The guacamole DOES NOT cost extra! :) They give you a free bag of chips too with your to go order and a variety of salsas are set out for you to take! 

My experience this particular Saturday 11/01/14 was the best so far! The new girl starting the line was friendly and listened to what I wanted. The guy on the grille was explaining to me how they make a stacks order and kept all of the bins of veggie and meat options full. He was talkative and kind. The girl finishing the line was also friendly and I have seen her every Saturday along with the two boys at the end doing chips and cash register. I left with a smile on my face and I couldn't wait to get home and open my Moe's bag of goodness! 

I had one unpleasant experience and one a step above that, but the food at Moe's makes me want to return! In the hopes that the gentleman with the huge bouncy hair isn't working the grille on Saturday. BOTH times he was there they were out of peppers and/or onions. I'm a patient person so it doesn't bother me that bad. What bothers me was coming in the line, letting the girl know I want extra peppers and onions when they are completely empty of peppers, her letting the guy on the grille know, and him still not making it 10 minutes later. He was just goofing off and yelling at the girls to be quite and he's making it ""blah blah"". I just stood there, waiting. Finally after about 15 minutes they had peppers to put on my bowl! Woohoo! Like I said....the food is yum.

All in all, I love you Moe's. I will see you every Saturday for our lunch date! :) And I will need to try this ""Stacks"" thing soon!",f1XbbdfPcBz7JeF1RzMG_A,4,7,5,SU7ohSqIxpPl48aqvgDNNg

Today, however, I took a closer look at my Yelp messages and noticed something interesting.

My first message was from a yelp user named John J., however, it was signed by Alisha, the Moe's supervisor!

Okay, she's using an alias. I guess that's fine. But what happens when you click on her/John J.'s reviews???

http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jw2HaZgWb3eVktJuVX4PyA

What???

Just in case she/John J. deletes their reviews (which they most certainly will), I'll sum them up below.

Moe's Southwest Grill (6910 S. Rainbow)

5 STARS

Moe's Southwest Grill (W. Maule Ave)

5 STARS

Moe's Southwest Grill (10965 Lavender Hill)

5 STARS

Seems a little biased to review a company you work for Alisha/John.....

But wait, there's MORE!

Cafe Rio (4830 Blue Diamond)

2 STARS - ""Was not happy! Waited 20 minutes for a quesadilla, A joke... I have discovered a new concept from the East Coast down the street. Moe's Southwest Grill. It was great. Quick service- I had a Billy Barrou! It was really good. I have found my new lunch spot.""

Pieology Pizzeria (10965 Lavender Hill) --- Right Next Door To Moe's

2 STARS - ""We stopped in when my son decided that he wanted a pizza instead of a burrito. We were all outside eating our meal and he refused to eat. I thought he was just being picky until I tried it. The crust tasted old and burnt, the toppings were dry and the marinara sauce
taste bad. The weather was nice outside, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.""

Seriously? So you make up positive reviews about the 3 Moe's in town and then you trash your competitors? Seems like bad business Alisha/John!",BwoZMzp8iqeNFwGMhS25Dw,3,0,1,TEyrgmS1zeh5q4y8pm5x3g

1118477,2015-11-07,0,o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA,"I grew up in Atlanta and Moe's is great there. This one is terrible. I tried repeatedly to make it work. I've gotten hard rice like others complain about on here, they've been out of guacamole and other items, and today the most disgusting thing of all happened.

I went in about 1pm on Friday Nov 6. The person behind the counter walked to the back when I arrived. Someone else was sweeping the floor.  She came over carrying the broom and dust pan, brought them back to the kitchen and put gloves on without washing hands.  I walked.

I understand that all restaurants have some level of uncleanliness. If someone isn't going to bother to follow the most basic health code of washing hands after handling garbage right in front of a customer, what other corners are they cutting? 

I made a complaint a few months ago. An account here contacted me as the franchisee. I was actually going to PM them this story until I discovered that they were abusing their account. 

They left a glowing review of their Moe's and negative ones about three competitors in their shopping center, including a competing Mexican restaurant.  The other negative reviews are about Pieology (its next door neighbor) and Shake Shack.

I took a screenshot of them and contacted each business and Downtown Summerlin to show them what their competitor/tenant was doing. I also contacted the Moe's corporate office.

That is as sleazy as it gets. I will not be giving the Las Vegas locations, apparently owned all by the same group, any business. I will be happy to visit the ones in Atlanta.

Edit: I contacted Yelp about this user and establishment and they removed several of his reviews, including his positive Moe's ones and the negative ones about competitors.",kFuqgoQCKs19a8-o2JvbYg,3,0,1,qE6Ma2F-S2bkaJC0YlyOdw

It's pushed all the way at the edge of Downtown Summerlin. The location is large. It's a little dark and the trays were very sticky, but it was about what you would expect. 

I got a chicken burrito with lettuce, rice, and jalape√±os. I enjoyed the option of having fresh jalape√±os, and it added just the right amount of heat. They serve tortilla chips with it, which is a nice touch. 

The salsa bar was a great option. I wish they had a spicier tomatillo, but I found that I actually enjoyed my burrito more without the salsa -- surprising for me.

To begin with, the menu is impossible to understand... They give funny names but no description of what exactly you're ordering. 

I purchased a Groupon, had to go in 3 times before using it, because every time I went in, they were out of something... How can a Southwest Grill run out of such things as Rice, Beans, or veggies?

I finally went in on a Monday, they run a special that any burrito you buy is $5.99... I advised them that we had a Groupon... I was advised they don't accept those on discounted food, I found that acceptable. My wife ordered a bowl and I ordered a smaller burrito. 

Once we got up to pay, I handed the young punk my phone, and he was baffled and told me they can't accept the Groupon I paid for.... He kept insisting that he had to give me the discount price because, ""It's Company Policy!"" 

I've eaten there a few times during day hours, and it was fine, but as time has gone by, things have changed.  I will never go back. 

Quality of food I rate 2 Stars, Zabas is better, and a cool restaurant called Panchos is within walking distance.

The chicken salad sans the tortilla tends to be my preference.

Service. There was only one lady working to assemble and ring up orders when I came in on a weekend. The line grew to six people before one of the guys watching from the kitchen finally came over to help. She apologized for the delay and let me know the guac was on the house for the inconvenience- which was appreciated. 

As for flavors? The salad is the only thing I've found satisfying, and that's with tons of added grilled veggies. The queso has the right consistency but no cheesy flavor, it's really bland. This spot will work in a pinch, but I won't go out of my way to return.

REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!   we always order guacamole on everything we order even though it is extra $$. We have always felt it was well worth the extra $$. But on Friday, March 25 at 12:14 pm we got maybe one small teaspoon on each item.  Even the giant burrito we order had a little tiny teaspoon and that was even after I complained about the amount on the four steak tacos we ordered.  
Kim was the one making the tacos and when I said we usually get more guac on the tacos She said ""This is how much we put on"".  The guac container was almost empty BEFORE she started on our order.  So on four steak tacos and one chicken burrito we were given less than two tablespoons of guac for about $5 extra.  When I asked for the owners card she just told me to leave a review on Yelp.  I could not believe that !!!!!   Who wants a BAD REVIEW about their restaurant?????   She knew the review would be bad because I keep telling her she was not putting enough guac on each taco.  I said just because you are running out of guac that is no reason to skimp on the current customer.  She did not care at all.   By the way....

I explained to her that I did not want extra meat, simply half portions of each meat. She said that ""it's still extra meat."" She then put two scoops of chicken into my meal. How hard would it have been to do one scoop of each meat without an additional charge? Even though she was very loudly bubbly, she lacked personality and friendliness. She seemed rushed or bothered. The food line counter was very dusty, you could see the difference between the edge on the client side and the inside. It grossed me out but I was already mid order. The iced beverage area by the register only had 1 bottled drink in it and be ice was melting like it had not been refreshed for hours. The salsa counter and beverage area had water all over the floor like there was a leak. There were 2 rugs in place for safety and a wet floor sign but it clearly needed attention. As I looked for a place to sit, there were a couple of dirty tables, that had not been tended to once the patrons departed before I arrived. While I sat and ate, I could hear everyone's conversations, including the girl asking people for their order and I was sitting in the furthest corner from the front, as there was no music playing. Total atmosphere killer. The food lacked flavor, the lettuce was browning like it was old, and the guac tasted like it was straight out of a bag. As a Moe's lover, I was very disappointed when I visited this location. Overall, the lack of care, cleanliness, and quality was extremely disappointing.

My husband and I went in on Friday night for dinner and like some of the other reviews we were confused by the menu. Almost immediately I was concerned about my decision of choosing Moe's. There was only 1 person working; she had 3 customers ahead of us and not only was she making the food but also working the register. I looked down the line of food and the place was a mess. When it finally came our turn to order we were advised that they were out of rice. We were disappointed but not completely turned off and decided to come back at a later date. The following Monday my husband and I returned to redeem our groupon. Up front I told the employee that I was there to use my groupon.  I was a bit nervous as my bowl was being assembled; clumpy rice, strange film on the beans, barely enough chicken, white not green lettuce and to top it off a scoop of sour cream which was scrapped from the bottom of the container.  When I got to the register and presented my groupon I was then told by the second employee that I can't use my groupon on Monday because of their $5.99 Monday burrito special. I then said I would pay full price just so I could use the groupon. After some back and forth discussion, where I filled him in on the rice issue from Friday night it was clear to me that they weren't going to accept the groupon. I told the employee that I would not be purchasing the food, that I would be canceling my groupon order and that I would never step foot in that restaurant again. He looked at me and said OK.

2608297,2015-10-13,1,o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA,"I really want to like Moe's but I don't think I can. I've eaten here about four times. All in the late afternoon/evenings. There are never enough staff to make the food and they are always 'out' of something. Today was the final straw. They were out of the flour salad bowls, so I got a regular bowl. The rice was hard and crunchy, I skipped on the beans after the customer in front of me ordered them and they had a thick line of crust around the container from sitting so long, they were also out of grilled onions. They did offer to make new grilled onions, which they did and they placed them right back in the same dirty container.  The chicken that they had was the last of it, and she scooped it in and said ""That's almost a full order of chicken"". Then we got to the cold section, where they were basically out of sour cream. Now I'm sure they had more, the girl asked someone to get more, but it never came. So I accepted the fact that I got a half order of sour cream. When I got over to the salsa bar, the poor salsa suffered from the same issue as the beans. Just a large thick ring of dried up salsa on the sides. 

As we were eating, a small child, no more than 3 years old emerges from the double doors that are the kitchen and starts running around by where the sad food is peeped into whatever you order. His mother apparently worked there and he was with her at work. I watched him climb across a table and then go sit on the dirty floor under the same table to proudly get up and walk back to the food prep area. 

The rice was hard and crunchy, the chicken was DRY (and I like dry chicken, but I couldn't even stomach it), and everything was cold.

2646050,2016-02-09,4,o1Pjim5n8xJjjAE_v4RiHA,"Like they say ""you only get one chance to make a first impression"". Not impressed with my first visit to Moe's.
I felt the menu was a little confusing with names and references of popular culture to identify food offerings with no ingredient description.  I think they missed the mark. One example was the ""Art Vandalay"".  I love the show Seinfeld but how does that tell me what is in the burrito? Could it be latex? Definitely not, so I'm not sure where they were going with that one.  

The staff were definitely new and could have used the more guidance from the MOD who had better things to do on his cellphone while at the register not to mention the personality of a brick wall.  

I chose the burrito this visit and an Art Vandalay which seemed to end up as half a burrito because of the small size.  All items are sitting in hot and cold well pans and you go down the line and choose your toppings.   I had the steak which was a little chewy for sitting in the well to long maybe? 

Moe's offers a combo of $2.89 add on which includes a drink and a choice of side.  I went with Moe's famous Queso dip which for 2 Oz goes for $1+ by itself.  That's crazy I thought.  They do offer a salsa bar with 5 or 6 types varying in spice level. I tried several and none of which tantalized my taste buds.  Warm tortilla chips do come with your burrito which is a nice touch.

This location had some opportunities to improve guest service and enhance the experience.  2/3 of the staff kept dissappearing to the back and leaving the newest guy out front to handle several guests for lunch rush. I saw 3 people leave after waiting several minutes and no one acknowledged them.  The one guy who looked like he was supposed to be in charge obviously had no interest in being at work today by his lack of engaging with the people who pay his salary. 

I had high expectations of Moe's from an episode of Undercover Boss. The food looked awesome and the concept seemed great. However I think the BOSS needs to make a few more visits or this concept will sink in Downtown Summerlin.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,7,4,3,oSEwQ_sMUzbEFL2RISITaw

Moe's earns a good solid 2.5*s but I've bumped it up to a 3 because of two things: one, they have burrito bowls that you can easily customize to be low carb (leave out the rice and beans) and two, they have a good, small salsa bar to spice things up! 

This Moe's location is big inside with lots of easy parking (you don't have to park in the mall's garage which is nice). The interior is new, clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and welcoming and seemed happy to help newbies decipher the menu. 

Bonus points for having one of those amazing customize-your-own Coke machines (with like 500 drink options). They also have Southern style sweet brewed iced tea.

Moe's is a lot like Chipotle where you go down an assembly line and tell the employees behind the counter what you want to add to your burrito. I love being able to customize my meal. Moe's doesn't have any seafood options but they do have grilled tofu (a big plus for my vegan friends). 

I visited on a Tuesday night around 7 pm and the place was mostly empty. No lines and no crowds at all. I ordered a burrito bowl, low carb with no rice or beans. I opted for grilled chicken breast and I added extra meat (the steak). I was VERY disappointed with the portion sizes of the meat. The amount was SO puny that at first I thought they forgot my ""extra meat."" I've eaten at Moe's many times and this was even less than the ""normal"" amount of meat at other locations. Be aware that they screw you on the amount of meat here. 

Yes, Moe's is expensive for what you get. I left hungry and I added on the side of chips and queso (the cup of queso you get is so small they should be embarrassed to charge what they charge; it's about 5 bites of cheese) and paid extra for ""extra meat."" The chips are bad, don't waste your money. 

I think the expense in relation to the portion size would make me not eat here too regularly. I know this location just opened so maybe the employees need training on the amount of meat to serve -- they just seemed to be SO stingy with the meat portions. At least the guy loaded me up with pico and cheese! Overall I'm happy to have another quick service Mexican style option in town.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,1,0,3,dhG18aHizb7uNDDKb1CjyA

The food on the website makes it look like it would challenge Cafe Rio but guess that's not the case. Even the companies own website says they are open, which isn't true. Considering how many places have burritos and tacos, not sure I'll even bother trying to come back to this place again. Makes you wonder why they would close, health district shut them down? Treat their employees poorly so they don't have staff to keep it open? Doesn't matter now, lost this customer.",C7YJ5WvJbMqzfFw2e4eA4w,1,0,1,IP2bNulQLyTSAIk23DI8rA

Not a pleasant experience at all. Not to mention getting into Downtown Summerlin is a nightmare. One way in and out.

After LOVING Moe's in Florida, we finally found one across town and made the drive because of how much we enjoyed the Moes back home. To start the bad experience off with a bang, an employee was making food for a friend (possibly another employee on her day off) and ignored us. When she finished with her friend they proceeded to go sit at a table and have a conversation about some boyfriend drama...with lots of cursing. There was also no exchange of currency, so the friend was not charged for the food. At this point I'm covering my 5 year olds ears so he can't hear the language. We should have left immediately, but we had driven all the way across town. When another employee came to help us she was very nice. But there were no black beans ready and I was told I could wait 10 minutes or longer if I wanted some. I also got the last scoop of cold dried out chicken that was on the line. When I asked if there was more, again I was told it would have to cook. My husband asked for more beef on his burrito and was told there would be an extra charge. The only reason I gave them 1 star was because the queso is so good. By the way, I got the last of the queso so the next 2 people in line were told they were out. It took almost 20 minutes from the time we walked into the door until we sat down with our poor excuses for a $30 dinner. I also asked for a discount due to hem being out of ingredients and was told that couldn't be done. I have never wanted to ask for a refund or walk out without paying until now. It was the WORST experience ever. The only thing that could have made it any worse would have been bugs in the food or if one of us ended up with food poisoning. I won't go back and will recommend everyone not even try. Disgusting and disappointed!",UtSla-0fuM31jRsKUZ-qIA,2,0,1,jrkFzs2PdLx7ufJGs3WG-w

Just to give you an idea, Moe's is pretty similar to Chipotle but with a southern twist to it. The food was good but I was expecting a bit more from this food chain. The service was pretty weak and most of their employees did not know what they were doing yet! They offer nachos (they were huge), quesadillas, burritos, tostadas and tacos. I liked the fact that they have a lot of toppings you can choose from which are free of charge of course sour cream and guacamole are  usually extra.  Oh and did I mentioned that they have the Coca Cola lifestyle!! Yeee! Overall, a decent lunch/ dinner spot if you are looking for something quick! I will give them another try and hopefully their training curve will be over!",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,3,0,3,MaDM0LubLZgcbcc1p3RzNQ

It started with the attitudes of the two girls working there. Almost like we were inconveniencing them by trying to order what we wanted and how we wanted it. Only getting worse from there, when I brought to their attention that there was a hair in the sour cream, the attitude increased as if I was behind the counter and put it there. She straight up took the hair out and kept serving the sour cream. ""Complementary "" chips were also a hassel for these girls. Another customer asked about their soda machine being out of everything,  which is was, and the employee, keeping with her poor attitude, ""well I don't work at this store"". I guess I'll fulfill my cravings for Moe's when I'm back in Buffalo. This location is surely a lost cause.",ivdF2eehpkR6QqwM63tqnQ,5,1,1,DTyf_Q19_XWRtpdkVSXNfQ

They ran out of chicken when it was my turn to order.  So I waited patiently.  They said they would bring my order out. They served me the wrong order.   and forget my side of guac.  The manager asked if I would like anything for my troubles, so I asked for another small guac and maybe some queso.  She never came back out to the table.  I finished my meal.  Tried to throw away my trash but they removed the trash can for emptying.

The employees aren't trained properly and don't seem to understand their own system, promos, or menu.   Food that seems to have sat out all day and tastes stale, or at best, flavorless. This place is not fresh and you can tell food hardly moves/changes like at a Chipotle, etc. I wish I could have gotten a refund or just walked out. I should have known this place was bad when they're running a 5.99 Burrito promotion and it's the lunch rush and the place is empty. My salsa had hair in it, not just a single hair but several. I'm surprised this place is still in business. You're better off going else where.  I don't know if this is indicative of the chain or just this location, but stay away and beware of this location. I wouldn't eat here if they paid me to it was that bad.  When there are other options like Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja fresh, zabas, etc. just around the corner /nearby, you're better off going elsewhere. 


P.S. 
No employee carries a name tag and they sign in as cashier on the receipt. Impossible to hold anybody accountable.  Again,  poor management,  food quality, service etc.",2l4bC506FRdJLz1RKNN0UQ,1,0,1,V7tn_Gfd9IW0PjfT0WdCWg

Save some money, even Taco Bell is better.

The service was horrible, the girl working the evening of 03/0716, has NO knowledge of the menu, apparently she has no training.

Soggy tortilla, pretty tasteless overall. The chips and salsa were pretty good last time I ate here but not so great this visit. The lack of details/ingredients about the menu items led to me not knowing if the burrito I received was composed of the ""right stuff"". And the employee making the burrito didn't know much about their food. 
I had the pork burrito and it was among the saddest pork burritos I've had in a long time. It's too bad because this place is convenient when shopping in the area and I imagine it could be so much better.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,1,2,gzToEuWZh-3Qg8SX8N6cTg
