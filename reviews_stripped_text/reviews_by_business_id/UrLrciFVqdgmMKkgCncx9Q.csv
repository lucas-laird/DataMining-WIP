493889,2014-02-27,0,UrLrciFVqdgmMKkgCncx9Q,"Went in at 10 am on a Saturday.  Two people ahead of me that had placed their order and one at the car window.  Five people including the ""Manager"" behind the counter and it took them 4 minutes to take my order.  Sat down and one of the people waiting for her order started bitching that she had been waiting for over 15 minutes and what was the problem.  Another lady came in and the manager took her order and walked off.  After nine minutes I went back and asked if it was training day because they were really taking their time and the cashier said ""No...just another day.""  The manager walked by and I asked if she was the manager and she said  ""Si"".  I asked her if she knew what she was doing because now I had waited 13 minutes and still no order.  The woman that the manager helped asked if her order was in because the manager had not taken her money and she said no and she left.  A few people came in and out and heard the problems and left.  After 17 minutes I finally got my order.  This Burger King will not be open in a year and if you hire management they better care about the job and be smart enough to handle the job.",VGmI4JlKYP_U_gxIn1txmw,1,0,1,prQUmojFg9-dP8228foU6A
675693,2017-09-08,0,UrLrciFVqdgmMKkgCncx9Q,I live right down the street and go often that the regular employees recognize me. Today I went for a quick dinner for my family during rush hour. Had some newer employees ring up my card and said they couldn't take it cuz it wasn't reading. I told them they have had to punch it in before and never had an issue. The supervisor on shift said he has no authorization to do anything and they can't help me at all. Had to go down the street to get food and waste my time.,K-5J_H16HJi60rsUMQuy9w,0,0,1,zXaXEVZtzJg8vyIujsjd4w

1834438,2013-06-07,0,UrLrciFVqdgmMKkgCncx9Q,"Since opening, we have been to this Burger King 5 times.
I will not be back for a couple months... That should give them time to figure everything out.

We have encountered issues with orders, prices, and wait times, despite visiting at various times of day. The staff appears to be new, not just to Burger King, but to speaking with people who are paying for products.

On my most recent stop, around 7am on a weekday, there was only one other car in the drive through. I ordered a breakfast combo with a large coffee. The items did not come on the screen. I was instructed to pull around to the window. When I got there, the price was more than $1 over what it should have been. I asked way, and this is where it got bad...

The attendant told me ""it just is, that's what it costs. What, you wanna look at the receipt?""
I said yes, ""I am going to look at the receipt."" I was given  bag of food, then, he handed me the small receipt, without saying a word. I saw what it was, and decided not to make any more of an issue... BUT then, he gave me a cup of coffee that was not filled, followed by a handful of cream and sugar packets... Not in a bag, not in the bag with the food, just dumped them in my hand and closed the window again...

So, what was the problem with my order?? 
He rang each item in individually, resulting in a higher price.
AND did not include the potatoes in the bag. 

I stop for breakfast or coffee only once ever few weeks as a treat.
$5 every day adds up, so my family avoids wasteful daily stops.
This was my first ""treat"" in about 3 weeks and it was terrible. It was a waste of my time and my money AND cost me more off both than it should have.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,3,0,2,J9eQZA0iW7lzJhlUZOTLPg

Their service is poor and I've never seen them flame broiling burgers..... So after waiting 20 minutes and still didn't have our burgers, I asked for my money back. The kid at the register went back to I guess the manager and told her a guy wants his money back. I hear her say ""I don't have time for that!"" The kid gets the override card from her and proceeds to try and figure out how to return my money. My bill was $20.09 and the kid hands me a $20 bill and closes the drawer. I let him know it was $20.09 and he starts going through the refund process again.  Frustrated I tell him never mind and leave. 25 minutes total time spent and I left losing $.09 and didn't get dinner.  This is the worst Burger King.

3085618,2016-04-08,0,UrLrciFVqdgmMKkgCncx9Q,"This Burger King is located on the North side of Las Vegas, near the Decatur Ramp for the I-215. I went to this establishment during the evening on a Friday.

Atmosphere: Flashy and Modern!
I'm not even kidding, this is one of the nicest Burger Kings I've ever been to. I've only seen these types of Burger Kings on YouTube that are located in other countries. There are many places to sit, and it looks like there is new furniture around the restaurant. There are two touch screens installed next to two tables that let patrons play games as they enjoy their meal, both of which look totally cool.

Service: Polite and Quick
I got my food within a reasonable amount of time. The cashiers were nice to me when I ordered my food and called my number out clearly.

Food: Not as bad as I thought it would be
I had a chicken sandwich combo, which included a small drink and a small order of French fries. The chicken in my sandwich was nice and crunchy, but had a slight taste of grease on it. The fries were pretty good and it's always cool to use the Coca Cola Machine.

Overall: Good time!
I would come back here just to hang out on the slick new furniture and technology. I have to remember that Burger King is a family place. There were several children present when I entered this Burger King, and if it wasn't for their parents nagging at them, my dining experience might have been a little more peaceful. For a Friday night, it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,4,LnNhhQAg580ANgYtrPhp6A
