Produce is nice. Home goods section is adorable. Single serving foods for a quick lunch at work you can buy by the case. Meats and seafood you can find seasoned and marinated ready for cooking or unadulterated for your favorite dishes at home.

Especially if I need, green onions (5 bunches/$1), napa cabbage, onions, or an assortment of mushrooms (enoki, beach, shiitake). 

They have a great seafood section. I always get a little slab of salmon to eat salmon sashimi! It is always fresh! They also have a small selection of already made foods such as an assortment of kimchees, kimbab, vegetable pancakes. My favorite is the seasoned raw crab! They also have pre-packaged raw meats/seafood with vegetables to make hot pot, I'm assuming?

They have a food court in the front area. I've never tried any of the places (I usually buy already made foods from inside usually) But it looks like there are a lot of choices from a few vendors. They have a small little bakery in the front as well. They have freshly made breads, cookies, manjoo, breads filled custard and much more.

One word: Smelly. All of the sashimi here smells terribly fishy. I made the mistake of buying the fish without smelling it first (amateur, I know). I got it home and it smelled TERRIBLE.

I tried making it into spicy tuna and spicy salmon the second night in the hope of drowning out the smell. I took two bites and gave up. I'm throwing away about $15 worth of fish because the smell is so fishy, you can taste it in every bite.

Other than that, there's certainly variety in terms of this being a huge market with a ton of stuff. Anything that's a dry food is a safe bet here. Just stay away from the fish.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,1,1,2,BN-Rvo8B8Qz_fHfUQpNN4w

Although they can be quite overpriced, the products I've bought are so worth it. I love the ramyeon, jajangmyun, etc noodles section of the market. They have SO MUCH selection. 

The workers here are nice, but they don't really communicate with you unless you have a question. And when you do, they are more than happy to help you and assist you with satisfying and answering your question. I also like that the grocery market itself has a hot food section where you can purchase cooked Korean food. They sell kimbap, soondae, dumplings, and etc freshly made every morning. The kimbap (laver roll) and the corns are put 50% after 8PM which is pretty awesome!!!!

I believe that the customer has the right to get the employees name first of all and when i first asked to speak with the gm she said she was the one speaking.

Supermarkets need to be assessed based on these categories:  Selection, layout, quality of service, and price.  Here's why Greenland slathers the competition in Gochujang, and throws it on the hot grill:

Selection:  Although it's predominantly Korean, there is a large variety of goodies here, ranging from whole fish that the monger will slice or filet to your likings, freshly made banchan, good produce, and an array of delicious snacks.

Layout:  The store is organized in a logical manner.  If you start out with the produce, and make your way around the floor, you'll finish at the frozen goods.  This is how it should be, so your frozen food doesn't get all melty on you before you check out.  

Quality of Service:  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful, even if a language barrier pops up, you can still get the answers you need rather easily.  The fact that you can have the seafood prepped here quickly before you get it home is a huge benefit to trying new recipes.  

Price:  The prices here are similar to many other supermarkets, cheaper than Whole Foods of course.  

**Bonus**  The food court here offers up some tasty fare, including soups, stews, sushi, and some grilled items.  A new Korean fried chicken place opened here, and while I haven't tried it, it looks fantastic.

This is a review of the food court:
In the Greenland Supermarket food court there's a Hawaiian place, a Sushi place, two Korean booths, a Tofu ""casserole"" place (which I don't think I'll ever try, it sounds kind of disgusting) and a coffee shop which serves Boba but seems to be out of it a lot. 

I really wish the Hawaiian place served lumpia and Portuguese donuts but I digress, the spam musubi was quite delish. The sushi place is pretty cheap, for $1.99 they will give you two nigiri, which is about ten nigiri for $10. I also tried Korean food for the very first time when I came to this place, just for the hell of it. I had a kim-chee and meat stuffed bun, which will have to grow on me sadly. It tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd. 

In conclusion, I had a pretty good experience here. I wish they had a little more variety (such as a Vietnamese booth or more offerings at the Hawaiian booth) but I will definitely return.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,2,0,4,Hp2-wvC0pXCi2qOGVnS5NQ

As for the meat, I do favor buying their pre-seasoned short-ribs and beef brisket. They have it nailed down when it comes to the taste and freshness. Its also perfect and easy to cook when you are at home craving for that Korean BBQ taste, minus the smoke. This is the prime place to pick up your kimchi as well!

To compliment your food that you get here, you can also purchase soju here.

Towards the back you will find pre-cooked food. meaning you will find kimbap, fried mackerels, glazed chicken wings, vegetable/meat cake, seaweed salad and much more. I've tried a good handful of these, and they are a life saver when you don't want to cook that day or if you are in a rush.

If you are looking for your instant Ja jang myun gratification, look no more! You have find the prime spot to find your perfect ja jang myun noodles. There are literally two sections of noodles for you to select from.

The prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.

The food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.

Greenland is this half-Koreans dream come true!  This is where I go to get my Seoul Food on!!!...LOL...I used to always rely on Vietnamese markets to find my Asian supplies...until a friend told me about here...  Seriously kick @ss!!!

So your thinking Greenland, that doesn't sound Korean...well once u walk into the place you'll think differently!  There's a food court with yummy smells coming from each one!  Some of the signs r written in Korean but the folks there r always smiling n willing to help (I've been to 2 and there's like 8-ish different ones...). There's also a couple different shops...I just remember a hair product one and a coffee one I think, but the Bakery stand!!!  Ohhh this lady knws me cuz I ALWAYS stop for something!!!  Lil pastries for like a buck25 each or so...(hint hint--there's a lil tag on the back telling u what each one is, LOL...)

Ok, onto the shopping!!!  Always fresh produce!!!  Great prices, and some hard to find items too...the back does have a fish dept...a little bit of a fish smell in that corner (it really is minimal!), but not NEARLY as bad as some places I've been to...if your looking for fish it's always fresh w/ good selection, they also have a small fridge area w/ a sashimi selection too!

The high point in my book is the back section where they have marinated selection of meats!!!  Kalbi!  Bulgogi!  Spicy chicken!  I love the boneless rib meat the best!!!  Also they weigh the meat, make the price sticker, and then add the extra juice...Brilliant!!!  

Also have a meat fridge selection of Shabu!!!  Tons of different kinda, in different thicknesses...
Further down the line they have more made goodies, like rice cakes, Dop-po-ki!!!, Kim-bap...
For those familiar w/ Korean food you have to have all your little side dishes right?!  Well they have a slew of them in little plastic bins ready for consumption...nom nom nommmm!   =)
Yummy yummy all up in my tummy!

Of course they also have rows and rows of your staples like rice, sauces, ramen, etc etc...additionally also items like porcelain dishes, knives, serving dishes n all...best part you can tell this place is new and well kept CLEAN!!!

I want to point out, the ratings for Greenland itself are going to be skewed because I am seeing reviews for the food court eateries, and those ARE NOT part of Greenland itself. They are INDEPENDENT shops who lease the space. 

Continuing with Greenland. They have pretty much ALL of my favorite Korean foods all in one place. Before they opened, I would have to stop at both commercial center and the one further down spring mountain (at valley view), to ensure I was able to get all that I wanted. 

I like the pre-prepared meats as my mother did not learn to cook a lot of korean foods growing up as she always had older sisters around to do it for her... so, in turn, I didn't get taught either. 

The ONLY reason that I did not give Greenland a full 5 stars is because twice now I have bought pre-made kal bi that was already turning! It made me sick the last time. :( I really do love this place, though, and I continue to shop there, even with the meat issue. 

I love their prepared sides and it appears they refresh them regularly, and check for freshness regularly, too. They also have a steady supply of kim bahp! The other stores run out around 2pm, 3pm if you're lucky, but I can never get out there that early. 

If you want to check out food reviews, the food court stores are: Soon Tofu, Chapaghetti, and more that I will write down the next time I am out there.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,1,4,Nb3SDymJTz74pE6dFMOpdA

Depending on what you are looking for you may not have a choice. For example, Greenland is probably the only market in the Valley that sells uni (seasonal). A tray for $7.99, not too bad, but not like you have any other choices in town.  They've also got several types of marinated kbbq meats ready to grill which I haven't seen anywhere else either. The seafood section is one of the cleanest, but no live fish or crab/lobster tanks. Produce section has mostly Korean specific stuff, even real Korean pears actually from Korea, but again pricey.

If you're into Korean noodles, they have a huge section in the front of the store, though brands that are sold everywhere else such as Nongshim are priced about $1.50 more per pack. Here, Nongshim Black was priced at $6.99; at SF down the street they were $5.49.

Another huge selection that I was not expecting was pickled daikon radish (takuan). I was looking for some at the other markets in town and they all only had about 3-5 brands and every single one either had artificial color Yellow #5, aspertame, and/or MSG. At Greenland I found a few brands that had none of the above offenders and only limited and natural ingredients. If the daikons have artificial coloring, perhaps it was not pickled correctly since the traditional pickling process turns the radish yellow.

Too bad their prices are high, otherwise I'd come shop here more. For that reason, I only shop here if they have something I can't find elsewhere.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,2,3,zmRnZWT-U-KIj0BDIEroog

The prices are very reasonable for most too all of products.

The atmosphere is nice laid back lots of tables and chairs. I never went super crowded so maybe it could get loud? The service is excellent they call your number or not paying attention they come drop off the food. Something makes it different most food courts.

My best friend Kelly is Korean and always used to come here and ask me to go. I had it bookmarked and for some reason beer ventured out. Jump to present time and Kelly has moved back home and I'm heartbroken. To ease the pain and get a place of my bookmarks I decided to finally come here.

Now, I wasn't blown away. Maybe it's because Kelly sends me these items in the mail from Korea so I'm used to it. Or maybe Korean stuff just isn't my thing. I'm more a Mexican meat market type of girl

Okay okay I will get to the review..

This market has high quality fish, but not any other great types of meat. The ones they do have our limited. I felt as I was walking through it was just snacks, chips, munchies etc. they have a ginormous amount of ramen soups. That definitely shocked me. Of course I'm spoiled though and why would I make ramen from a box when I can go to a ramen house that delivers it fresh for practically almost the same price. 

My husband got their coffee. It's in te picture. He's ridiculously obsessed with it and it's all that gets him through his long days at work. Swears it's better than Starbucks or mad hatter. 

It was very cool to see there was a food court outside the supermarket that had sushi, ramen, tofu and BBQ grilled type foods. We tried the grilled one. Thought it was a inexpensive. Just wished I would have liked it more. She said it came with two sides. The sides being potato, broccoli, fish patty, macaroni salad and beet salad. Went with potatoes and fish patty. Fish party was so fishy if couldn't eat it. The potatoes were delicious but ice cold. Which made it difficult to eat. The BBQ chicken though was extremely tender and delicious. Not much BBQ taste but it was too good to care. I wouldn't come back to this restaurant. 

Next we decided to try a roll from the sushi food place and the rolls are only 5.99. My husband got the dragon roll ad thought it was amazing for the price. We will def be back to the sushi place. 

Warning food courts only take cash.

Unfortunately, Greenland Market doesn't store them frozen.  Just stacked up on a open refrigerator.  This is how mold grows.  I stopped buying raw or partially cooked noodles (especially the Yakisoba) from 168 Market for this reason, and 168 is even worse.  Fortunately enough, Okinawa Soba noodles are pretty thick, so, I was able to pick the ones with the mold on it, and just cut that part off.  After boiling them, I examined it and the rest was fine; however, some people may have an allergic reaction if they eat those noodles.  I have also checked the other pack in the freezer by opening the outer bag and sure enough, mold.  I'm afraid to imagine what the other noodles look like in that stack.....  I've also bought some curry yakisoba that was in that stack.  I have yet to examine those.

Greenland Supermarket stands out for a few of reasons:
1. Sashimi Grade Fish--they always have fresh, sashimi grade salmon and tuna...sometime they have tuna belly and yellowtail as well. 
*1a. Wikipedia states that ""fishing and fish exporting is a major part of the Greenlandic economy"" ...probably why they carry sashimi grade fish...
2. Sake--Greenland has the largest selection of sake of the Asian markets in Vegas, including some high quality Junmai Daiginj?, Daiginj?, and Junmai Ginj? sakes.
*2a. I was told that Greenland is the world's largest island...so largest sake selection and largest island...
3. Eats--In addition to the groceries, Greenland itself has a good variety of Korean Banchan, as well as some noodles, and dumplings, and the like... but they also have a great food court (as food courts go) that offers different types of Asian options. Across from the food court is L'epid'or Bakery, a wonderful Korean Bakery.
*3a. Kiviak is a traditional Inuit food of Greenland made by stuffing Auks (birds) in a hollowed-out body cavity of a seal, sealed with seal grease and covered with large rock pile for 3-18 months...probably not as tasty as the aforementioned Greenland Supermarket food court items.

The tofu soup is something I wanted to compare to Mr. Tofu, but the soup here was so bland and tasteless. However, the small fish it came in was really delicious (besides the fact that there are many bones and it is a pain to remove them). 

The jjajangmyeon from Chapaghetti is an awesome dish that everyone must try! It is something I remember eating growing up as a child. Also, the noodles came with a sweet & sour chicken, which I think has a lot of MSG because it was so slammed with the flavor of MSG, I forced myself to swallow it.

Last stop, dessert (fish cakes) from Tiffany's Coffee Shop.

Please try the Red Bean fish cakes from here. It is an authentic Korean dish. The fish cakes are filled with red beans and surrounded by a waffle-like texture that comes out delicious, warm, and perfect during the winter time (in my opinion).

Their sake collection is above average and fresh fruits and vegetables are vibrant--always carrying seasonal produce. Apple pears and soshito peppers are good now.  Even though they are known for Korean groceries, they also carry a variety of international products. 

Their food court offers many choices from sushi, pho, Chinese-Korean fusion, to of course Korean food.....as good as you can expect for a quick and simple food court at fairly reasonable price. Also, don't forget to stop at Lepidor bakery on the way out.

Greenland was built after Albertson's had shut down a couple years back. It's exciting that the Korean community is growing in Vegas. Now I don't have to drive down to LA to get my Korean market fix. Sure, there are smaller Korean markets in town, but Greenland is the first of its kind. 

They have great produce selection for fair prices...sometimes. My mom likes to buy her apples there but complains that its much more expensive than the supermarket down the street from our house. They have a good selection of meats, too. You can find different cuts of beef and pork already marinated and ready for the grill! They also have a good selection of side dishes. This comes in handy when we get too lazy to make our own. Furthermore, we all have to agree that Korean cookies are the best! You can find an isle-ful of sweets here. If that's not enough, there's a small area in the front where they sell pastries and cakes - all fresh baked and delivered to Greenland every day. These pastries are my guilty pleasure. 

Their pre-made hot food (i.e. jap-chae) is buy one get one half off after 8 PM! But beware, the cashiers have to manually punch it in and they always forget to do so. I lost count how many times my mom went back to the store huffin' and puffin', all angry at the fact they keep forgetting. 

Food isn't the only thing they sell here. They also carry household items too. I love the  red Korean rubber gloves that you use for dishwashing. Seriously, better quality than the typical yellow ones you find at Wal-Mart! I also bought a back scratcher from here - you know, the Asian wooden ones. 

Greenland has an amazing food court! You can find your typical Korean stews and soups here. Have a craving for some jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) or jjamppong (Korean spicy seafood soup)? Well, you don't even have to pick between the two. One stand serves both in a bowl divided in half. Feeling like sushi? They have a stand serving your favorite rolls. Want something sweet? They have a little boba/coffee/snow ice shop adjacent to the food court to satisfy your sweet tooth. Most of these stands open at 11 AM. Perfect for lunch!

First off this place is clean! No overwhelming fish smell (99 Ranch!) or messy produce/deli sections. However, the aisles are small and hard to navigate if the store is busy. The aisles aren't organized that well either. Chips and assortments of noodles can be found all over the place. I noticed that the prices on some of the items were a big higher than say, SF Market or Seafood City but Greenland has a lot more selection and variety. For me, this super market is my one-stop-shop for anything KBBQ: The deli/butcher shop features pre-marinated bulgogi, kalbi ribs, chicken or pretty much anything you need.

But what really sets this place apart is the food court. Small eateries that make up the food court offer a great opportunity to sample some unique Korean and broader Asian food if you don't have the time to cook it up yourself at home. The sweets/boba spot offers excellent smoothies and the sushi stand serves up freshly made rolls.

I do like the variety they provide for people with things such as rice, fruits, frozen items, Korean specialties, etc. The food court though has gone down hill to say the least compared to when it first opened. The food court was my favorite part of going to Greenland and people loved going there, but now the food court is relatively empty and dead now.

The supermarket itself is nice. My favorite part is shopping for where all the meat is because of all the different Korean meats you can get. They range from different kinds of beef, spicy pork, and chicken. Their snacks that they have, are filled with variety. My personal favorite are the shrimp crackers! Those are a MUST try. I do like these seaweed flavored chips by Calbee (if I remember correctly). They are different, but a good different for me. It may sound really Asian of me, but I like that they have all the different kinds of rice you can choose from. I like short grained rice, and they do a really good job of having a variety of those. Line things that I didn't like is that they discontinued their rewards program, for whatever reason. I think that was pretty selfish of them, but hey, what can you do about it?

This Greenland supermarket has a good court in it, so that has to play a role in my rating. I really really loved the good court. I would go with my family at least a few times a month, and then they started changing. Things became different and less people started showing up for whatever reason, and then the restaurants started closing down. I don't really know what happened, but I was bummed out about it. Currently, they reopened it with a few restaurants up, but it is nowhere near the same as it use to. People who did come during the prime of its life know how it was, and it was amazing.

I was in dire need of these ingredients, and as quickly as possible. Plus, I called around and this was one of the ""for sure"" places open later on a Sunday. Skinny me, here I come! 

Initially, I thought this was a Japanese market, but my Yelp homeslice Tetsuro P. informed me that it's actually a Korean market that has been taken over by the local Japanese community. I had to giggle cuz that's awesome, but then I thought.... WHERE YOU AT, KOREA? Yall need to roll up and Gangnam Style yo fly as*es back up in your own market. There's enough love and gochujang paste to go 'round. 

Aaaaaa-neee-wayzzz,

This place is spacious! It was much larger than I thought it would be. Very inviting. Brightly lit, and despite the isles being a little bit small and overcrowded, things were well organized. It was almost like they were trying to cram too much Asian goodness into the place. 

I never felt judged or weird here, like at some of the Asian markets I have been to in the past. It's bad enough not being Asian in one of these joints, but having tattoos and stretched ears usually makes me stand out like a sore thumb. NOT HERE! I actually saw like, three other alt chicks besides me shopping. Sweet. Possible alternate reason I wasn't judged: There are more Mexicans working here then Asians. Real talk.

Now to the little stores. This place has a few perimeter shops as well as a food court. Because of the aforementioned diet, I unfortunately could not sample the delights that the food court promised. Sad day.

I did check out the coffee shop/bakery. Not much to report there. *shrug* Maybe it's better during the day. Then I popped into the cosmetics store. LOVE! I only looked around for maybe five minutes, mainly because I was afraid of buying something. Everything looked legit. Next time I go, I will definitely be making a purchase there. They had makeup, hair dye, lashes, face creams, that sort of thing. All from Japan or Korea.

They also had a bunch of empty stores, just waiting for some really bomb stuff to fill 'em. Like Mitsuwa Marketplace, they should get a bookstore, liquor store, ceramics place, and a sweet bakery. I would die of happiness. My heart so filled with joy, it would proceed to burst into teeny, tiny, pulpy pieces inside of my chest.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,7,8,4,9z_pNs5AS8R1SL9AtxznuA

I come here and to 168 Market for all my Asian food needs. I rarely venture outside of the two and I don't have to go out to LA constantly as they have what I need here! 

I usually get some of my Japanese foods here as well, since they have some of the better quality stuff for a decent price. I usually get my udon and soba here along with soup stocks and sauces that make up the dishes. 

I love getting Korean snacks here! I wouldn't know what to do without some of them. They have an aisle full of Korean snacks and a lot of them are my favorite from my childhood when I used to visit family in Korea which is a huge plus!! 

I get a lot of meats from here as well! Specifically if I'm buying meats for KBBQ or Hot pot for home. They have a wide selection and the quality is better than most of the other supermarkets. I also get a lot of my produce here because it's usually cheaper. 

Since it's a typical Asian supermarket they have household items as well. They have a wide selection of Asian household items that you wouldn't find anywhere else really and are a LOT better than Wal-mart.

Even ready to take kimbap! WOW... just WOW! The pre-packaged bulgogi is YUMMY! And, if you get the bulgogi in the case, they weigh the meat first, price that, and then ask if you want more sauce!

They even have other things besides food, like teapots, plates, fans... a bunch of random home goods and personal care items on the left side of the store. I thought about the hair dye... haha, but that will need to come with a translator! I did buy a cute little teapot for under $10 though. 

I'm also happy that the people at the check-out counter are friendly! And the prices are very reasonable too! Especially for a lot of the snacks!

Enter Greenland.. they have a huge variety and selection of Korean products/snacks/drinks/etc that you would expect from an Asian supermarket. My favorite part is the kimchee and side dishes that they sell in the back. Word on the street is that they're made fresh in-house! The price is decent and there is a huge selection of dishes to satiate your pickled needs. I grabbed the cucumer salad, bean sprouts and radish kim chee. A perfect supplement to almost any meal at home!

The kim chee is probably going to be the main reason I come back here. Honestly, I can find cheaper groceries (sometimes) at other Asian supermarkets. But the kim chee is a winner in my book, so hello Greenland.

I fell in love instantly. They weren't busy when I first went there around 9pm. I really like that they close at midnight everyday. I tend to do most of my shopping at night when places aren't so busy.

Besides being a market, they have a mini food court, a little side that sells baked goods, and little stores varying from beauty products to clothing.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how bright and clean it was. All the fruits and vegetables looked fresh. As with places that have seafood, there was a fishy smell, but not as bad as other places tend to be.

The meat looks really good and on my second trip there I had gotten some marinated short ribs and they were to die for. I'm not sure what prices should be for that kind of thing, but it wasn't bad at all. The gentleman that got the meat for me weighed it then added a little bit more for free. They have a ton of side dishes to go with your meal that are made fresh available there too. During the afternoon they tend to have free samples of food like curry and iced coffee.

They also have some frozen Hawaiian food! I forgot about that. The prices are a lot cheaper that what I used to pay so I'm definitely stopping there more often. In fact, a lot of things in there were a lot cheaper than the bigger stores here.

Just after, is a sushi joint.  I've only gotten the Korean Style Jirashi...absolutely love it.

It's not as busy as some of the Asian supermarkets in Chinatown.  There are several Korean businesses in the front when you walk in.  Try the food court to the right; I recommend Island Style.  I love the snack foods available at Greenland Market i.e., cookies and chips.  There are some items from this place that we have made a staple in our pantry.

MIRAK
Typical Korean food here. Meat dishes and soups. I've never tried this one. See photos for menu. 

SONG'S FAMILY
They have Kim chi fried rice, ramen for $3 or $4 although I think it's instant or about $6 with rice cakes. Haven't gotten a chance to try this either.  

SAKURA SUSHI
Typical sushi rolls (Philadelphia, sunset, spicy albacore, tempura.) Cheap California rolls for $4. Also Haedukbibimbap (which is pretty much a Korean poke bowl) for $8 and katsu for $9. 

RED GATE WOK
More of a Korean/Chinese fusion. Lots of chicken options here like orange chicken. Also jjangmyeon, which are a good portion of noodles with a thick black sauce. Always served with pickled radish. 

HOT TOFU
I've eaten at this place the most. I've had soondubu which a tofu soup served bubbling hot. Ask for an egg to be cracked in it as its bubbling. Served with a side of rice and fish and lots of banchan. Good price and really fills you up. I've also had the spicy noodles and pickled radish with cold noodle soup. These use thin rice noodles. The cold soup (it had ice in it!! :o) was delightfully surprising and really refreshing on a warm day. 

PHO THIEN HUONG
This one isn't Korean. It's Vietnamese. Extremely large menu. Pho, rice dishes, mi (egg noodles), bun (vermicelli noodles), egg rolls, banh cuon if you come early. My boyfriend tried the pho and he described it as very watery. Meat wasn't too fresh and you're better off going to the pho restaurant next door. Can't speak for the other menu items here though.

Korean Food: 5/5 I love Korean food and at Green Land I love their meat section. You can pick from and variety of different meats to BBQ that are already per-marinated to Barbeque. I love the their side dishes from sea weed salad to cold noodles to Kimchi and radish so yummie. I really like their selection of rice cakes golly they have a lot. 

Veggies: 2/5 Its a hit or miss, they usually have way better prices than your average grocery store but I find a lot of their produce aren't fresh. Some are even beginning to welt and rot away. 

Food Court: 3/5 Like I said I love the concept but I don't the selection. In OC the selection are all different but at Greenland they seem all to be noodle stews. I want tofu stews or Korean BBQ at a fraction of the prices because it is in deed still fast Asian food.

Pros:
- HUGE selection. If you are looking for something you'd go to an Asian grocery store for, chances are very likely you will find it at Greenland. Lots of Korean goodies too. Veggies, fruits, fresh/frozen seafood, meat, kimchi, rice, candy, instant noodles... The list is endless. 

I don't want to go over my entire my grocery list but a few things I always come to Greenland for is to replenish my rice (huge bags) and soy sauce (big tin gallon). I always get a couple pounds of the frozen sliced ribeye to make bulgogi and tofu to make Soondubu and Mapo Tofu too. 

Cons:
- I think they only get a shipment of certain goods once a week. There's times when I make the trip to Greenland and there are absolutely no bean sprouts when they usually have a few rows full!
- They have an area where workers make banchan and they sell premade packages of it. I've tried various kimchis, ddukbokki, japchae, jun... Not very good
- The food court is not impressive. I've had their Bibimbap, Yukaejang, Jajang-myun, Tang-sooyuk at all different places in the food court, hoping that the next time will be better. I've learned my lesson...

She was also there to point me in the right direction to this fabulous Chili paste that I love...move over Sriracha! 

We first started in the far left side of the store where they have everything from hair dye to kitchen knick knacks. I love their little Sake sets and they even have waffle makers that will put hearts on your waffles. I fought off urges to get cute stuff and bought some practical cleaning supplies. One of my favorites worth mentioning was this dish rag that had all these holes in it. If you can imagine Madonna back in the day in her Lucky Star video with her black mesh blouse. It kind of looked like that but it was thicker and pink. The holes help all the dirty dish water to escape and because the material is hard it's easy getting off caked on food off your plates. It works like a dream! 

They have pre marinated Kalbi it's a great quick fix if you are entertaining or need a Kalbi stash in your freezer. Greenland has a decent seafood area it's not the biggest I've seen but I if they sell Dungeoness crab at a good rate then I don't mind. I didn't have a chance to check though. 

Greenland also has the biggest selection I've ever seen of soy sauce, and sesame oil. I never knew there were that many. I of course picked up that chili paste which is yummy! 

This supermarket  has a vast selection of exotic vegetables and fruits to choose from. I saw that they sold Lotus Root ...I've never tasted it but would love to try it.

Possibly the cleanest Asian Grocery store around LV and thank God for living close by. Greenland's neat arrangement of aisles and a variety of products keep us coming back -  make that Korean, Japanese and some Chinese!

Yesterday, my parents and I strayed away from our usual restaurant hops and settled with getting some pre-packed cooked goodies - chicken kampung gi (sweet with a hint of spicy), broiled blue mackerel, kimbap and spinach - which we ate at their food court. For less than $15, we had a well-stuffed lunch that kept us away from any other cravings the rest of the day. 

Greenland is not merely a supermarket, but a whole lot of other things too. They have postal services, bakeries, a jewelry kiosk, a Korean airline agency, miscellaneous gift stores, clothing stores.

I have been on a search for good ethnic markets where I can source authentic produce, sauces, spices, and other items and that search has led me to some interesting places. My visit to Greenland was another one of those discovery visits, I needed a couple of basic things and thought I'd give them a look. 

Getting in the place was interesting as one of the front doors was broken. Once inside the front door you have to pass through a mini-mall of sorts with assorted shops, food offerings and even small appliances on display before you finally get to the market. Shopping carts...you gotta look for them as they are tucked away to the right side and I almost missed them. 

The produce...was disappointing. It's overpriced for one thing. And the quality was hit or miss. The Italian squash was huge and good quality. The mushrooms? They looked good in the package but once I got them home they were slimy, stinky, and woefully disappointing. But they do carry lots of various peppers, they carry shallots, and even had watercress but again the pricing seemed a bit too high compared to other places I've been. 

They do offer Mexican coke in the dairy cooler which caught my eye before I checked out the seafood cases. Shrimp was priced pretty competitive, but overall...I felt the seafood selection was ho-hum. I've seen better selection elsewhere and yes that includes the squid. The rest of the store was not anything surprising. If you like a wide variety of Cups of Noodles you'll be impressed. They also had large jars of kimchi including some that listed radishes vs. cabbage as the main ingredient...and they had some housewares including average quality pots and pans, chopsticks, soup spoons, and the mandatory bulk rice section that was again priced a tad too high compared to other places. 

Overall...it wasn't worth my time to drive to check it out. I'll give them 2 stars...one for not finding flies on the produce like Seafood City had going on, and another star for fast checkout lines. Otherwise...yawn...it ain't all that.

The biggest reason I go to Greenland is for their BBQ.  They have several meats already marinated and ready to take home.  Buying your kalbi/bulgogi/etc. by the pound here and grilling at home is so much cheaper than eating out!  That wouldn't mean much if the meat and marinade isn't good, but luckily that isn't a problem.  Potluck coming up?  Pool party coming up?  Greenland's BBQ is my go to spot for bringing a dish.

Everything has been decent and consistent.  For someone that's never made banchan at home, this is my only option!

I had soft pastry items and the bagger threw them into the bag at the bottom under heavier items causing them to all get smashed. Then he proceeded to throw the already bagged smashed soft items into the bottom of the cart further pulverizing them with the other grocery items being thrown on top.

The food court is amazing too! I love getting japche and dukkbokki. When I was living in Korea, there was a street vendor on my walk home that sold dokkbokki. My home-stay sister and I would stop there and get some just about everyday. I was glad they sold it here. On thing I liked in Korea's food courts specifically was that they don't use Styrofoam as much as we do here. All of their plates, bowls and utensils (beside chopsticks) can be washed and reused. I was happy to see they do the same thing in Greenland as well. The only Styrofoam they use is for the drinking water. And the service is just about the same with the numbers on the screen. I feel as if I'm right back in Seoul.  

Overall I love this place and can't get enough of it. It's very clean, the workers are very helpful and you can find what you're looking for.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,2,0,5,C2SpFLp57qldfHVTlcPGbw

What I love though is how clean, organized and well stocked this store is! Ingredients are labeled well and usually in English somewhere. This is helpful to those of us that love these foods buy can't always decipher the original label.

The have a nice seafood section although probably not as big as some of the other asian markets. They will clean them to order, however. They have a nice selection of sashimi cuts such as salmon, ahi, hamachi, and white tuna. This varies as I have also seen uni and octopus. just look for the freshest ones!

I was able to find all the condiments among all the different brands that they had of mirin, soy sauce, sake, & gochujang.

Since it's a newer supermarket, it's very clean and quite large.  They also have quite a few promotions going on and the Husband loves to stock up when they have their mushroom sales.

We've been known to hit up their sliced fish section and have our own little sushi meal.  They also have a lot of pre-cut up items ready for your own hot pot / grill meal at home - so many variations of marinated meats!  That's definitely useful and something we'd love to take advantage of in the near future.  (We've already witnessed My T.'s use of their sliced meat section and can attest that it's great!)  

Their selection of ramen is worth taking a look at too - Koreans love their ramen and you can probably go for weeks and have a different kind each night!

Even through its a food court, prices are relatively high. Probably 8 to 12 dollars per dish. I highly recommend the spicy pork with rice. Forgot the name of the stall but look for it on the menu. It's a generous amount of food and their flavor is very good. Pork might be a little fatty but it adds to the flavor!

I asked if they can scan my items in front of me but they insist on finding it. When they finally found my items I noticed the one lady who made this a bigger deal than it should speaking to the other lady who actually honored the price being very passionate with her words.

They have a plethora of different types of rice cakes, fish cakes, meats, ramen, sauces, banchan, dry goods, snacks, etc. and this is the only Korean market where they actually pay attention to the expiration dates of the products! The meats are good quality and you will not regret purchasing any marinated meat and the pork belly. My favorite 'togo' meal they have is near the banchan isle and its an assortment of fish eggs bibimbap style. It has chunks of sashimi with lettuce, daikon, carrots, and hot pepper paste. Mmmm yummy! Before you enter the market they have a list of specials that you should take advantage of, especially the dumplings and cold buckwheat noodle soups. 

Last but not least, the GS foodcourt. My mom and I usually stop by Baek-ni-Han (corner store towards your right). The owner is a man with glasses and he makes everything from scratch. If you like soups and noodles, try getting the half seafood soup with cha-chang myeun. The bowl actually has a divider so you can have a bit of each.

My husband and I have been trying to cook more at home and trying out different recipes. There are certain things that I usually buy at Greenland because they are the only ones that have them or they have more variety to choose from:

Huge jars of kimchi
Soondae
Gochujang (red pepper paste)
Ssamjang (fermented soybean paste)
Pork belly slices

Their meat selection is usually a better quality than some of the other supermarkets in the city. Their sliced pork belly here is amazing and we tend to always get it here if we are making dwaegi soondubu (spicy pork tofu soup). Or if we just want to grill some up and make a wrap or sandwich with it. Their sliced beef here is great as well and we usually get that for our hot pot nights. They also have marinated meats here like bulgogi (marinated rib eye slices) and it's delicious. Their marinate isn't too sweet or too heavy. It's great when paired with rice.

They also have ... beef bones! They're in the frozen section and they sell 'em by bags. I don't think there's another super market where I've seen them just sell beef bones. Oxtail bones sure but not beef bones. You can use these to make beef bone soup, i.e. sullungtang. 

They have a decent selection of ramyeon (instant noodles) and some are imported from Korea. They have the firey noodles and they sometimes carry different flavors of it (2x spicy, curry, mala, etc). They also have a good selection of frozen rice cakes and packaged fresh noodles. 

BANCHAN! They have a really good selection of these. They have roasted anchovies, spicy roasted anchovies, spicy cucumbers, seaweed salad, etc. They have a cooked foods area where they have corn, japchae, kimbap, fish jeon, and soondae! Soondae is korean blood sausage :) And it's delicious! 

Their alcoholic beverages are also decent. They carry flavored soju -- even though it did take them a while to get it in. They don't carry all the Korean branded beers though. The last time I went, I wanted to buy some Cass and they didn't have any. I can't seem to get any Cass lately...

Speaking of their stock ... it's not very consistent. There are a few items that I have bought, ran out, and wanted to buy again but they were no longer in stock. I'm not sure if they are just out of stock and haven't gotten the item back in or if they stopped carrying it. 

Regardless, still one of my regular grocery market stops. They have a food court, beauty shop, bread shop, mochi shop, and they recently opened a ginseng shop!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,2,4,sBGA28D8VFA4MmdmWKrdPg

Reasonably priced, this market offers quality nori, frozen gyoza, Thai/Korean/Japanese spices and sauces, soy wrap paper, pre-cut fish for sushi, fresh veggies and AMAZING salmon steaks. I went in for a quick look and ended up spending over an hour just browsing around. The staff is pretty friendly and will accommodate your requests (meat department).

The prices at this market are right on par with any other grocery store in Las Vegas, so if you are in the mood to try exotic spices or different foods, come shop here. Some of the things I found here are:

* Nori (quality stuff)
* Salmon Steaks
* Sushi grade salmon/tuna
* Pre-cut fish for sushi
* Sushi rice
* Loco Moco sauce
* Apple-Pears
* Amazingly fresh ginger
* Fresh pork belly

I love supermarkets. Maybe it is the fact that we all need food to survive and food has always been a source of comfort. Walking around a supermarket in any country I visit is almost as important as seeing a landmark. It speaks more about the people of that area than any other culture center.

The pre-made food section offers a wide selection of banchan (Korean side dishes). I haven't tried any yet, because I am still in the stage of wanting to make my own. I have 8lb. of kimchi sitting in my fridge as proof. Thank you Greenland for stocking all the essential ingredients. ^_^v 

I have bought their bulgogi since my friends were too impatient to wait for me to marinate my own. I liked it, I would only add some onions, enoki mushrooms, and green onions to give it a little contrast to the sweetness of the sauce. 

The japchae (sesame clear sweet potato noodles with vegetables) was also decent. A little sweeter than I am used to, but it is decent if you add some black pepper and slices of green chili peppers.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,1,5,oUP-bfAD_ffk5Zl2OToFdA

Great selections all around. I even find things I need that has nothing to do with Korean food. We love their banchan that is sold by weight in their cooler section. Whenever I was in my postpartum (4x btw), my korean friend said that the Korean seaweed soup (miyeokguk) is what Korean mothers would eat because it helps with their bm supply. So miyeokguk to Koreans is equivalent to chicken malunggay soup to us filipinos. I actually found the seaweed in the miyeokguk definitely helpful to my bm supply. With all the newborn craze, it's nice to be able to buy it premade so i can simply heat it up at a very affordable price in my opinion.

The workers have been friendly, fast, and efficient. You'll definitely walk out with a hole in your wallet especially if that shopping cart is filled, but who said korean food is cheap?! =)

I was invited to a bbq and Hawaii style dictates try never to show up empty handed. Being too lazy to make something, I sought out the nearest Korean market since they almost always have marinated meats. So glad I was forced to come here! 

First off, the parking lot has slanted parking spots. As anyone who's been to Chinatown knows, Asians can't reverse for sh*t. Hey I'm not as bad as some, but sadly I'm included in that generalization. It's nice to shop w out worrying about some little old lady w a minivan backing I to your car.

The store is very clean since it's still pretty new and hopefully will stay that way. They have a great selection of produce, but sadly the quality is lacking. I got super excited about a box of dinosaur egg pluots by the entrance, but every single one was overripe. 

The seafood section isn't as extensive as other Asian markets in town, and nothing live swimming in tanks. But that's usually in Chinese markets, not so much w Korean ones. 

On to my reason for being there - the meat dept! Large selection of cheap marinated meats and everything I've tried so far was great. Spicy pork isn't too fatty and has great flavor, although I don't consider it spicy at all. I usually add more garlic chili paste before cooking it. Bulgogi is pretty good, but may not be marinated long enough since flavor wasn't really set in. Same with kalbi ribs, which were also extremely fatty. Yes I know the cut is supposed to have marbling, but this was excessive. 

They also have ready to fry tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and chicken katsu. Katsu is simple to make, but creates such a mess I hate it. Awesome to have this option. They must season the meat because it has flavor even w out katsu sauce. Spicy chicken is just ok, teri chicken is flavorful and so juicy.

Their regular meat section has cuts of varying quality including some beautiful and expensive kobe beef. Next to that is a small hot and cold prepared food section. The best thing there is the beef pancake. Its a beef patty w carrots and other veggies mixed in, dipped in egg and pan fried. Its like a patty version of meat jun. Whatever it is, just get it. FYI - the label simply said beef on mine. 

Greenland has the best selection of Korean snacks, nori, instant soups. It seems to be the only place that carries my fav potato noodle soup. 

Ladies at check out are quick and friendly, although they always talk to me in Korean. I respond by staring back blankly....  

I've only tried the homemade fried mandoo at island style. Its just like my Korean aunty used to make, and love that I can also get Hawaiian sun juice w it.

This market is pretty damn awesome, but I still prefer SF market (spring mtn/decatur) for my produce, seafood and spices since Greenland is solely Korean.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,5,KuhEddvqjs4cu9j-nZ3D4A

What they do have, is my fave brand of kimchi by OSHINAE (it's got some cartoonish ladies in the front) for those who can't read Korean. I don't settle for anything else, so this is basically why I go. Also, I don't have a choice to get Korean stuff elsewhere. Greenland is as good as it'll get in vegas. 

Don't get overly excited though. It's generally an average market even in Cali with a bunch of other competitors like Galleria Market and California market, so, I'm giving it 3 stars. I love the stealing photos they got posted by the cashier. It's blurry and graphic all at the same time. And yeah, the people who work here seem a bit robotic in their actions, starting from the cashiers to the baggers. Hey man, it doesn't hurt to smile once in a while.

It's clean, bright, does not smell (well maybe only by the seafood section). But I love the cheap produces and the meat selection here. You can even get the pre-marinated Korean BBQ. I would not recommend their fish though, I bought it twice and it was not fresh.  

So I would suggest their meat, which is really fresh and also their cooked food section with various kimchee and Korean side dishes and salads. (These however are a little bit pricy but I thnk that's pretty common for Korean food, it's usually on the more expensive side)

Second part is on the food court outside.
Two of my favorites ones I think are worth trying is the Chaphaghetti (try their Jajangmyun - noodles with black bean sauce) and Island Style (which is a spinoff of their original location on Sahara I think?)

For me this is a good spot to come and get some lunch or dinner if you want to pick up something quick and easy. You just probably won't catch me wondering the store with a basket and shopping.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,6,2,3,uGERK5ivAG75XPMgccQXag

They also have a members reward card system that offers % back.

And the produce sections and the pre-marinated meat sections still offer great products at a reasonable price.

Plus if you can't wait to go home with your groceries, you can always grab a bite to eat from one of the food court vendors.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,2,4,UtczUoVu0zhJe_McWSn8RA
5928961,2017-02-07,1,qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw,"Used to like Greenland Supermarket, but it has really gone downhill since I first moved to Las Vegas. I still come here maybe 2-3 times a year to buy a few select things, but try to avoid this supermarket as much as possible. 

First of all, this place is claustrophobic. Everything is cramped and unorganized. When you walk around, it feels like they just put products wherever they can fit them. Good luck trying to get around with a cart since the aisles are very narrow. Also, double check anything that you buy here! I have already noticed a few times that they leave expired and damaged products on the shelves. Horrible! I know that this is a Korean market, but they used to have a lot more Japanese items in the past. I see less and less each time I come here.

Last year, I remember during one of my visits that this place smelled like clorox bleach. Really strong too. I'm not sure if it was coming from the food court area or the market area, but it made me feel sick. I mean come on, the least they could do is thoroughly air the place out! Customer service is pretty horrible. The employees do not care and just shove their way past you without saying anything. I was here about a week ago, and as we were checking out, the woman who was bagging our groceries just decided to stop halfway. Yup, walked away and never came back. After paying, the cashier started to ring up the next customer, so my mother-in-law and I bagged the last of our groceries ourselves. I mean seriously?? WTF?? They should just have a self check-out lane at this point!

Ughhh so frustrating! We need a Marukai or Mitsuwa in this city, that is all.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,0,2,4Z144bp8KzJeWfWB4yLJlg

It's your one stop shop for all your Asian, specifically Korean food and accessory items. 
The prices here are very competitive and the bonus is no tax.
This store provides fresh fruit and veggies, meats and all your other supermarket needs. 
They have several areas dedicated to ramen and rice. It's like a shrine to these two items Lol!!!
If your in Korea town, stop by and take look.",8Ywq24WJ9BbgmMgwUZtMYQ,2,3,4,YZ31Swo1rDk_5hhnMoTDVg
5960066,2012-03-20,2,qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw,"Greenland is probably my favorite Asian supermarket in town. The store has so much variety and is pretty well-organized and clean, which I enjoy. Everything is pretty reasonably priced as well. 

I don't shop there nearly as often as I'd probably like, probably because I don't really cook. I do try to get here about every month or so, just to get my fix. Also, as someone who doesn't really cook, I really enjoy their huge selection of premade items as well as all their inexpensive kitchenware.  

Another great place about this place is all the food vendors that are located in the mall area as well. I can usually grab some food to go on my way out for dinner as well, which is probably my favorite part about the place. Convenience is the name of the game here.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,4,m_2wfuWQYp0RSDdkB8TRYg

This is a little Korean food stand in the far corner of the Greenland food court.  While there are lots and lots of Korean restaurants in town, I haven't found many that serve Champong.

Champong is a Chinese-Korean noodle dish made with a red, spicy Beef broth. It is noodle based, and filled with seafood and vegetables. (See pic #45).

Champaghetti's version offers large portions, and great flavor, with a decent amount of spice.  Takuan, Kim chee and raw onions are also served as sides.  The broth is very red, so dress accordingly-- no white shirts!  Also, get a few extra napkins, this stuff will make you sweat! Great all year round, but a must for the rainy weather season.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,2,1,5,Eq961QhO8EejD56vTC2TrQ
