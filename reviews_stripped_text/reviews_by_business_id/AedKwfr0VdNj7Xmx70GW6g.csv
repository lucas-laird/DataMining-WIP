Old School is what you get when a true beer lover opens a brewery then asks his 8 year old nephew how he should run it. With the best hefeweizen in the valley and games like chutes and ladders, candy land and sorry available, this place has something for everyone. My kids played battleship while my wife and I had a conversation. A conversation....about adult topics.  Like a real conversation similar to those conversations people you see on TV have who don't have children. It's been years.  When the food came, no fighting. We ate and the food was universally popular. Then, the adults talked some more. We didn't have to exchange actual currency for worthless tokens or count tickets to purchase this rare serenity either. The staff was the best part. Our waitress was so attentive and friendly that she could have sat with us and shared our appetizer we wouldn't have noticed. This place is pretty new so let's all work together and spread the word. Ideally, there are 10 new Old School Breweries opening up in the next 10 years so everyone can enjoy the greatest beers, served by the greatest staff in the greatest brewery.",KPj-EVyIDmU6xtQG9sIEeA,0,0,5,sOnZIWMe2y-9v5EBP4rosw

Sara was quite knowledgeable about the beers offered and I asked for a flight of samples. After asking me my preferences, we ordered dinner and she brought me four samples. Mind you, these were not shot size samples and 3 out of 4 were great. The other was well made, but not to my taste. I ordered up a great pale ale and we waited for out meals.
   My son ordered a pizza and I ordered the Artichoked chicken sandwich with tater tots. Both were excellent. I had asked for a side of ranch for the tots and Sara suggested I try the cheesy beer sauce. The ranch ended up pretty much untouched as the cheese sauce was delicious.

It's not just the beers that are good at this place, as  they seem to of done quite well on food. We tried the Amaze-balls appetizer which are house made meat balls smothered in an apple chutney.

556611,2015-09-22,1,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"While I will admit that Old School has a certain atmosphere (I always have fun in there), it's mainly due to the staff...Courtney, particularly.  She's an outstanding bartender/mixologist and conversationalist.  But if you're a beer geek or beer snob, you'll be disappointed.  The beer list is mediocre, at best.  They have a couple of porters, a vanilla and a ""root beer"".  The former is overly sweet and the latter I haven't even bothered to try.  Their Hoppocrates IPA, is hit or miss.  I've ordered it perhaps 4 or 5 times, and twice, I received something which didn't smell, look, or taste like an IPA, though the bartender (not Courtney) insisted it was an IPA.  The Homeroom Hefe used to be decent, but the latest version (which I received a sample of) was all bananas, slight bubble gum and zero cloves.  That's not a German Hefe.  The new Red IPA has promise, I will say that, and their Vienna Ale is great for this heat.  They have an Imperial Stout (9.1% abv) and I recently tried it and I heartily approve!  Good stout!!  They also carry Angry Orchard, which does nothing to improve the beer ""list"".  And Old School, for some inexplicable reason, seems stuck in this pseudo-German, 80s feel (IPAs, porters, and stouts are not German styles) which just does nothing for me.  All beers are served in glass steins...all of them.  Even the samplers are miniature steins!  This glass may do better at keeping your beer colder, but it doesn't help with head retention, and if you try to swirl your brew to oxygenate it and get a good ""sniffy sniff"", you'll end up wearing most of it on your shirt or covering the bar with it.  Depending on what you ordered, that might be a better place for it than in your mouth.  The bar food is actually rather good, though that is probably because there is also a restaurant within the brewery.  It is rarely busy, if ever, and, I think, is a waste of space and resources.  The brewery needs work, not an empty restaurant.  The brewers/owners, and there are several, are inflexible.  I'm not the only one who's suggested that proper glassware might improve the enjoyment of the beers and might get more beer geeks through the doors, but it's all been ignored.  I could see if the beers did the talking themselves, and beer connoisseurs flocked in (like they do at other amazing brewers in Henderson, wink wink) for a chance to sample the contents of their steins.  But they don't.  In fact, Old School has already closed its doors once due to a lack of success.  In summation, Old School Brewing is a fine destination if you want a good time while having mixed drinks, rather decent food, and perhaps a beer that won't blow your socks off.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Three stars for those aspects, they lost two for the so-so beer.  They are a brewery, after all.",IovXpcpRk2F58tzvblZFew,1,1,3,C37dMu-ofG66tSCSwcLUew

Old School currently has four of their own beers on draught (Hefeweizen, Pale Ale, Vanilla Porter, and English Style Bitter Ale). There are three styles currently brewing as well (IPA, Russian Imperial Stout, and Irish Red Ale). They also have guest taps from local breweries.

Beyond that, the food is very good. My personal favorites are the pastrami sandwich and the fish and tots (where they use salmon as opposed to cod).

I have never had a flight with seven beers before and it was absolutely great. Old school make some great beers, my favorite being the peach blonde ale. However, the food and atmosphere were not as great as the beers. The amazeballs meatballs had great flavor but were slightly overcooked and the chip hop hooray nachos were very flat. It was just cheese and chicken thrown over wavy chips. And the atmosphere of the bar made me feel like I was trapped near a foggy lake.

They recently re-did their menu and it is now a professional menu with plenty of them available (they have solved the clipboard menu issue I saw mentioned in other reviews).

I was there late on a weeknight so it wasn't too busy.  I got good service.  For an appetizer I ordered the Amaze-Balls which are some delicious meatballs with some fancy sauce, plus some carrots which I used to mop up the tasty sauce.  I also got a sandwich, called the ""Dancing with the Devil' which has some savory medium-rare steak with a bunch of spicy peppers.  I was also told to request an off-the-menu sauce called ""Kiss of the Devil"" I think.  This is one of those super-hot sauces but I really liked the flavor on my sandwich.  To finish it all off, I had a piece of crispy wonderful  bread pudding with some pecan whiskey sauce.

I tried both the ABCD ESB (amber ale) and the red ale whose name I can't remember.  They were both great.  If I had to choose a favorite out of the two I would go with the ABCD ESB but that's because I'm an amber ale fan.

I feel like they could use a pool table or something to stir things up, but didn't see space in the bar for it.  And the staff was fun and kept me entertained; one of the cooks came out and was BSing with everyone, telling everybody a different fake name and backstory for his character.  Think of Roger on American Dad.

They do not serve watery mass-produced beers here; only their own beers plus a couple other craft brews from other breweries.  If you try to order a Bud/Coors/Miller the bartender may or may not react violently.",Ml7vmAHIi3kJGANiofExPA,2,0,5,arRK2pBUg_9r_rp0tM4pJg

985265,2016-03-02,0,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"I was visiting from Ohio a couple weeks ago and decided to try out some microbreweries in town.  I also hit up Bad Beat and Craft Haus in Henderson, and the 777 at Main Street Station.

Two stars for solid beer (really good hefe) and friendly bartender, although she seemed understaffed.  I like to pick the brain of staff members whenever I visit a new brewery and she didn't really seem to have the time to talk.  I did love the cute unique mini mugs for the flight.

I was turned off by the atmosphere though.  A craft microbrewery needs to be centrally focused on its beer.  Instead, I was subjected to the same old smoky and video poker bar atmosphere as every other corner establishment in Las Vegas.  If it wasn't for its house beers, I might as well of been at a PTs.  I did enjoy their beer, but walked out not knowing anything additional about its startup, background of the brewmaster or what other types of beer may be in the works for the future.  I also smelled like a dirty ashtray for the rest of the night.

Finally, I always purchase an empty growler at every new brewery I visit to add to my extensive collection.  I've NEVER been charged more than $5 for an empty growler.  Old School charges $10!!!  Definitely not an old school price!!",12G_aGLfLJ3r759jW6Fmkg,1,0,2,4ZDmyzWvYpycN9-i0o-dlA

Drinks: Their craft beers are delicious. Needless to say, its far more flavorful and interesting than the usual stuff you'd see. I prefer dark beers, so the vanilla porter is something I usually get. Most my friends prefer light beer so we usually order any of their hefeweizens (I prefer the homeroom.) Lately, i've been ordering the Cloudy McCuisinart. It really brings out the caramel flavor that you expect a brown beer to have. The drinks are easily the reason this place is my favorite bar

Service/Atmosphere: I really enjoy coming here because the atmosphere is really chill and its not your typical jocky sports bar. Out of the countless times I've been here, I've only had unattentive service once. That was during their 1 year anniversary, which I expected to be busy anyways. Other than that, service is super friendly and attentive.

Food: Probably my least favorite thing about Old School. Not because the food isn't good, but because the food is a tad pricey and they do happy hour (I actually love the fact that they don't do happy hour because that means they aren't charging you $5 food during happy hour and $20 for the same thing during normal hours.This just seems like fair business to me.) In all honesty, the menu is really well done and they have cool specialty dishes throughout the week. The dining experience is probably more enjoyable on the dining side though.

We live fairly close, so we wanted to check this place out....esp. as my husband fancies himself a beer aficionado. [He had actually visited just after they opened, but their home brews weren't being made yet, and sadly it took us months to get back.]
Myself, I am ""meh"" about beer. One sip of most, and that's enough. And then I tried Old School's Hefeweizen. Oh my gracious! Very lightly carbonated (naturally; not added), not too cold (just the way fresh natural beer should be, because it's not gonna get skunky), and TASTY! It went down way too easy :-)
We also ordered a flight, and they had just finished a new beer that day...Irish Red. My husband said it was like no other Red he'd ever had before. And I had to agree, just as tasty and drinkable as the hefe. The other standout was vanilla Porter. The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for a very dark beer, and you could really taste the vanilla. This was more of a sipping beer, and I could envision marinating pork in it before smoking it. Yum! (Hey, maybe y'all over at Old School could do that...?)
The food was good too--a burger cooked just as requested, hot cheese curd bites, an overstuffed pastrami sandwich. I liked their housemade thick-cut potato chips too. And a dessert that had a delectable whiskey-based sauce (just a hint)...I wish I had asked for an extra serving of that! 
The music was right up my alley too: they were playing classic headbanger rock (I heard most of my faves while we were in there: Metallica, Guns-n-Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana. If Pearl Jam had come on, I might never have left....) Not too loud, so conversation was possible too. My only reservation is that there were a couple of families with young kids dining, and some of the lyrics were pretty graphic...maybe wait to play that genre until after 9 p.m.?
Anyway, nice meal, fun evening. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I'm mystified as to why this place wasn't PACKED on a Friday evening (the bar area had a more people, at least). 
So if you love natural English-pub-style beer (not too heavily carbonated, not too cold, but very flavorful), and you like simple tasty bar food, AND you like the music genre I mentioned above: MAKE THIS YOUR PUB!!

2304012,2015-04-13,0,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"Old School Brewing Company for my experience was craft solid! I notice going over the reviews that talk about mixed opinions across the board. One trend that notice was the ones that had less then three star experience all came during its soft or grand opening. I have always learned being in the food service industry not really the best time to review any restaurant. Too be fair even in training there still nothing that can stimulate the little things of live service and apparently from past reviews they had few issues. I went with my roommate Roy E (just so happened the last time he came here was during that chaos or mess) after Elite event. I was excited! National Beer Day deserve good craft beer and always wanted too check this place out since close to the house. Roy was telling me about the special seasonal red ale beer he had that was awesome. We went with pitcher of the red ale. Not sure if they do it every National Beer Day but that night was two for one pitchers.

I got the Dancin with the Devil Sandwich. It was solid. It was sirloin steak cut in slices (steak was cook on point nice medium rare to medium), the red pepper aioli really liked plus worked well with the steak, and the peppers/onions. The bread was pretty good. Overall nice hearty sandwich. Warning kind of messy just cause lot of stuff going on inside but all in a good way. The chips would highly recommend over any other side choice. It really looks nothing WoW but when you bite into them. Not bag chips in the bulk or small bag of chips. It sliced thin rigid cut potatoes deep fried just like french fries. Hot, crispy, and addicting. Roy ordered meatball appetizer. Generous enough got to try one. Honest had better. Just ok for me. 

The service something that seems everyones had more bad then good. We got here late. Not lot of people in the bar. The bartender was on it. He was friendly, great talking stories with the whole night, couple other regulars in the bar next thing know talking stories with them, and feel this great laid back vibe in the bar. The bar area really not all that big. The bar basically just rectangle with high bar tables all around. Multiple televisions all around so if want check sports great spot. Talk about dark. The bar area not sure if not well light for reason or when you go into the dining room literally night and day. I never seen brewery that restaurant and bar area is so polar opposite. The restaurant lot lot more spacious, higher ceiling, all booths around and middle area (all the board gamers come out each week) open space all tables and chairs. and so bright almost had get eyes readjusted checking out the dining area. The decor is odd. I come too a brewery drink first, food second, and board games not so much. Board nights apparently big deal bartender was mentioning to us. All that goes on in the dining area. If you board addict you can bring your own games or they have some house games that can use. 

When you walk into the bar they have list of micro brews plus the seasonal beers. It on chalkboard. So if craft beers your taste definitely need check Old School Brewing Company out.  I only had the red ale. If any of the other beers are like it got nothing but praise for the beer. Craft beers always been fan! Micro breweries. Thankfully compare to twenty years ago now in Vegas we have lot more options. This is one plan on coming back and trying more of the craft beers.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,2,4,AgzE12KGyyw-gJ2cACKZtg

2388661,2016-04-13,2,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"One of the worst restaurants in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, we made the mistake twice to eat at this restaurant. Each time we spent at least 2.5 to 3 hours with horrible service. This last time we waited 40 minutes for menus to be delivered. When we finally ordered our food, we found out 30 minutes later that our food was not entered into the system. Our appetizer arrived 2 hours later with all of our main items. We completely forgot that what we ordered. 

We had to grab all of our drinks from the bar since our drinks never came. Refills were never offered. 

The food is good but it is not worth the horrible service that we have received not once but now twice.
We will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. We learned our lesson and will never be back. 

Update 4.13.16 - In regards to the comment below from Nicholas. 

His statements regarding my visits to the restaurant or my behavior are not accurate and in an effort to defend myself here is the truth. 

The first time I ate at this restaurant was after my daughter's soccer game across the street at Desert Breeze. We had a group of 6 adults and 5 children. We were the only table in the entire restaurant and the service was horrible. 

Our second time I ate at the restaurant was after the Las Vegas Geocache Event and there were a lot of people in attendance. The event was over around 8:00 and we ordered our food at 8:30 and we were 1 of 4 tables left in the restaurant. 

I declined to visit the restaurant for a third time. The family that I was with did not call the restaurant and apologize for my behavior. That is not true. 

My hope is that consumers in Las Vegas do not waste their hard earned money supporting an organization that does not value input or feedback from their customers.",DB89q5HIiV4kVYjl4rYYyw,4,1,1,Ow6cx2ICH7iTH0ahM8u6uQ

I was here on 1/15 and they didn't have their house brewed beers on tap yet. However, the fabulous bartender said they would be available by the weekend. I haven't been back yet but I'm guessing their own brews are flowing by now. 

Prices were very reasonable. Staff was friendly and fun. The smoking (gag) bar area is completely separate from the dinning area. I abhor smoking but I only saw one person sitting in the enclosed bar area when I arrived so I decided to risk it. After all, I was there for the brews. I was momentarily disappointed when the tender told me that their brews weren't ready yet. That feeling quickly abated when I saw Citra Rye on the menu. Anyway, they only have a handful of gaming machines so maybe the cancer will be kept to minimum? Only time will tell. On the plus side, the clean-air dining room is a much appreciated option.

2611729,2016-01-24,2,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"This has been my new favorite bar for a while. Im not sure why anyone would give this place less than 4 stars. They are currently going to be celebrating their 1 year anniversary on Jan 30 with $1.11 flights of beers, 11.11$ appetizer, meal and dessert. And all kinds of prizes. I do have to agree that this place is short staffed but it is a local business where I met the owner last night and he is so nice and pleasant and has a lot of pride for his bar. 
This is the second time I went here. The first time was on a Sunday night and there was no one there except me and my friends. Service was great, the wings and cheese curds were tasty as hell. Only bad thing was the nachos- tasteless and not a lot of toppings.
The 2nd time we went here was with the BEER club on a Sat night around 7PM. I can tell they were not expecting that many people there because there was one bartender and the owner. 
We ordered 6 beer flights which came with 8 4oz beers (one of everyone on tap) and 2 appetizers each. The appetizers were the Hot buffalo wings, the cheese curds, and the chicken tenders. 
I have to say the hot wings were great, a little spicy for my taste, loved the cheese curds although warning (EAT WHILE HOT) or the cheese curds get hard and not edible. The best was the chicken tenders. Lightly breaded and not too salty. It came with a lot of tatter tots. They were so good my friends was ranting about them. He was like ""these have to be home breaded or the best freaking frozen chicken tenders I have ever had. I must know what bag these came from!!"" They def tasted home breaded and the chicken was super tender. Delicious!
Also we got some other beers. Our favorites were the Bus Imperial Stout and the Varsity Vanilla Porter. Also we cannot wait to try the ROOT BEER PORTER (coming soon!)
I know this place isnt super classy and semi understaffed. But root for the underdog!They take pride in the bar, serve descent food, and even better beers! A great place for locals, unlike those snooty places near the strip. 
Also the 12oz beer is 4$!!!!
And great tip: During NFL sundays and anytime the UW or WSU or even better the SEAHAWKS play (since this is a seattle themed bar), they serve BOGO beers. That means 2$ a beer. Doesnt get better than that!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,4,3,5,QRr4ok0udjVln5mvug6lCQ

It sits inside a shopping center off of Desert Inn and Durango tucked in the corner. I've passed this place a bunch of times and never thought much of it, till we finally decided to go check it out. We came in after midnight on Saturday/Sunday, there were only 4 other people there. 

I usually order a New Castle but of course being a home brew spot they had none, I should have known better so instead I ordered the Homeroom Hefeweizen. I actually enjoyed the Hefeweizen here a lot more than Chicago Brewery's, it was really delicious, I recommend any beer person to try it. The service was good, she greeted us right away and even gave us suggestions, checked in with us quite often.

My only complaint is when we walked in there was a sewer smell by the bar, not quite sure where it was coming from or what it was but it was not pleasant. We would have stayed longer but the smell got to us, don't want to think of sewer while drinking a beer.

Old School has limited hours from 4-11pm. Currently they were brewing a Vanilla Porter, a Red IPA, and Dunkel Weiss heffeweissen.  The Porter and IPA were both solid brews made in house.  My favorite trait of Old school is that they carry several local brews on tap like Big Dogs,  Joseph James and this delicious Mudshark blue have. Very unique blueberry scented beer that was very smooth to drink.  Check out a sample for sure. 

The service staff were very friendly and had great personalities not to mention easy on the eyes.  Courtney made sure to check on us often to ensure we had everything we needed. 

Happy hour specials occur from 4 -7pm and include 1/2 off appetizers.  I went with the fried WI Cheese Curds. They had a nice crispy and light tempura batter and fried golden brown.  These were real deal curds that did not disappoint.

They had a few guest taps but nothing worth mentioning.  The flights are very inexpensive though, so although not the greatest microbrewery in town, it is a good way to get introduced to different types of beer, for a cheap price, if interested.

The trivia was also underwhelming and extremely too difficult.

No. Aside from that, the owners (one pictured) are great people.  I had fish 'n tots. I've never seen a restaurant use salmon for fish 'n (chips) tots. OMG, amazing!! They make fresh chips (not fries, potato chips) in house. Hot, fresh potato chips ... I don't even like potato chips, but I could have eaten an entire basket by myself.

For a split second I thought it was closed. So we walked in, glanced to the right side, no one around, then a quick look to the left, the 'bar' side, we see people and out comes a female and says, where do you two want to sit? Easy choice..where the other people are! The TV's are in there! 
We sit and are quickly waited on. Decent home brew selection, I tried a 'sample' (2 ounces) of a couple, not bad, I order a tall ale. Cloudy and tasty, just the way I like it.
My wife orders a Chardonnay, got the stamp of approval on that one too. So far so good.
It took us a bit to figure out what to eat. Not a huge menu but enough of a variety to make it interesting. I went with the pastrami sandwich, the wife went for the Slammin' BLT, which was an intriguing BLT sandwich with a filet of salmon wedged in there. It was quite good as was my pastrami melt. for me the tots were good, crispy, nothing to somersault over, but good. The wife, not so much. But that's not a reason for either of us not to come back.

Went here for the first time this Saturday and was impressed by the quality of the food and kindness of the staff.  

The prices were quite reasonable and the quality of the food far above any kind of chain brewhouse.  Got out of there with lunch for three people + non-alcoholic drinks for under $40.00 inclusive of a 20% tip.

My six year old ordered off of the kids menu: hamburger and tots with cheese and ketchup on the hamburger... when it came she took one bite and refused to share with us because the burger was fantastic! --(we did weasel a bite after she had managed to fill up her tummy and was feeling more like sharing) 
I had the Fruity Goat Salad and it was very tasty the only drawback was that I think the plate needed to be bigger...my salad kept sloshing over the side (not that this kept me away from eating it all).  My husband had the pastrami sandwich and corn chowder which were also yummy.  

Our waiter and the hostess were both congenial and made us feel welcome.  Our drinks stayed filled and the service was just really nice.  We enjoyed our outing here.

As mentioned in other reviews, there is no character or ambiance yet.  At some point there will be something on the bare brick walls, but at this time only two flat screen TVs.  Their menu is odd.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, which comes with tator tots and BBQ sauce (on the side).  Tator tots are fine.  The sandwich was nothing more than a grilled chicken breast on a nice bun with lettuce and tomato...  I could easily make this bland sandwich at home.  My son ordered chicken wings.  Really nothing memorable about them.  They were certainly not the usual battered wings one has come to expect as an appetizer, not an item we would order again.  My wife ordered a Margherita Pizza, which lists basil as one of the ingredients.  No real evidence of the basil.  Not really a great pizza either, just average.  It was clear that the restaurant was trying to fit into its skin.  Beer, brewing, seems to be the real focus, not food.  After all, they call themselves a brewing company.  I think that in time the menu will be tweeked out of necessity to make the restaurant more inviting for families, especially those in the neighborhood who used to bring their families to the old pizza joint that occupied the building for many years.  (What's missing from that is the carpet and video games for the kids, now just a concrete floor with all the cracks and repairs... that will be covered with something after they pay out a few insurance claims for slip-and-fall lawsuits!)  When they figure out what to serve with their tator tots, maybe burgers and pizza, they will be a popular place for all the local sports teams and dads and moms who want a great beer.  And their beer is GREAT!  I spoke to the manager about the permitted smoking in the bar.  He stated there is a new ventilation system which will keep the stench out of the restaurant.  I hope, for their sake, he is right.  No family will subject their kids to the foul odor of cigarettes if the owner can't isolate it to his pet project: his beer bar!  I wish them luck.  We'll try again someday, but for now, we know where to get great pizza and great wings.

4293878,2015-05-14,0,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile since it was under construction for such a long time. I didn't go when it first opened, but I finally got around to it earlier this week when a friend suggested it instead of our normal Porchlight Grille.

I will say this, the employees were very nice and welcoming! Since there were only like 2 other people in the bar area around 530, they were very attentive and we really liked our bartender.

They also have beer pong in there which people actually did start to play later on in the evening.

That being said, the food brought this from a 4 star to a 3. They have a new happy hour from 4-7 that are half off appetizers. I was so pumped about this I called my wife and had her come and have some food as well.

We ordered:

Buffalo wings w/buffalo sauce - 4/5 - good sauce, great wings

Buffalo wings w/Kiss of death sauce - 4/5 - interesting and very spicy sauce, if you want a ton of kick, this is what you should get

Cheese curds - 2/5 - These were pretty bland. You can't really go wrong with cheese, but it's like the batter they used had anti flavor. It just made the whole plate pretty meh.

Wurst n tots - 2/5 - Same deal. My wife is German, so she's generally skeptical when we order anything bratwurst related, but this had the same problem as the cheese curds...just lacked a taste. The tots were very good, but the bratwurst was very bland (it's also fried in the same batter, so perhaps that's the problem?)

The service for food was also pretty slow, which I assume was the kitchen, because our bartender seemed pretty on top of it. We ordered mostly things you just drop in a fryer, but somehow some things took 20-30 minutes to come out (these are all appetizers btw). 

 The ambiance wasn't too bad, a little empty, but that wouldn't have been as noticeable if there weren't so few people in there.

All in all, I may be back from time to time (the beer was good), but when porchlight grille is right next store, I'll have a hard time not going there.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,3,0,3,Z9xeIzeASIQ7krj18fj8yw

Like many other users that left a review, I also came here for their grand opening. They were offering a free 4 X 4 oz flight of beers from 5 pm - 10 pm. Luckily we got there early, and were able to get a table. 

At 5:15, the bar area only being half full, and they were already struggling with the flight orders. Our waiter seemed panicked, and rapidly took our orders. He didn't really give us any recommendations or history about the brewery. We had some more people join us around 6:30 pm and we ended up waiting at the bar for 20 minutes to place more orders. At this point, it was SUPER obvious that the staff was just plain annoyed with the promotion they had decided to offer and they weren't shy about voicing it. 

The beer itself was OK. The Stout and Red were the best. I wouldn't advise the ESB if you aren't familiar with the taste. The Hef and Vanilla Stout were a little on the light side. I think we all ordered multiple Stouts and Reds throughout the night.

I was a little saddened by the staff. I know a Grand Opening is a busy night, but it's your chance to gain some loyal customers and share your brand with the world! It should be exciting!

5279539,2015-03-30,4,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"Spending extended time in 'soft-opening' in order to perfect their brews and nail-down a menu intended to impress both the gastropub crowd and families alike it was finally on Friday that Old School Brewing Company celebrated their Grand Opening and although I could not attend the festivities due to schedule an afternoon brunch the following day showed signs of a restaurant looking to do big things with the brewery in back already turning out beers that had tables around me singing their praise.

Invited in by one of the owners, an IT-Guy named Nick following his passions into a whole new scene, it was just after noon that I entered the sizable space and greeted by Nick himself as one of the servers had apparently called in sick it was not long before I was seated at a comfy four-top along the restaurant's outer rim, the decoration still sparse with the center of the room awaiting communal tables while light music played overhead.

Separating the smoky bar and gaming area from the dining confines, and thus allowing customers of all ages to indulge in the 24/7 eats, it was already having spoken with Nick in advance that my menu was crafted and having requested half-portions of several items in order to better sample the cuisine it was only after a sizable delay due to a surprising number of families filtering in from nearby soccer fields that the meal began, my first bites of a dried out biscuit far from inspiring though the spicy sausage gravy was appropriately rich and stick-a-spoon-up-straight thick.

Charting a path that allowed me to see breakfast items first, my second round of food arrived amidst the growing din of children in need of something to fill their mouths, and although I personally would have preferred none of the artificial syrup be added prior to arriving at the table one would be hard pressed to find any fault otherwise in the griddled cinnamon loaf from Bon Breads, let alone a duo of flapjacks from which the Baby Bear was pure fluffiness punctuated by chocolate while the toothsome quinoa and blueberry Mama Bear was the sort of risk-taker that made one think of something priced double at a celebrity chef spot located on the strip.

Clearly forgetting my request for smaller portions, an 'error in your favor' later described by Chef Lea as simply getting caught up in the moment as well as wanting the plates to be seen as they're intended to be served, round three arrived with some of the city's best garlic knots served up alongside marinara and as good as these were they simply couldn't hold a candle to the sort of cheese curd treatment one doesn't even experience in Milwaukee, the squeaky little nuggets just melting beneath light tempura beer batter with sharp beer cheese sauce good enough to be bottled sitting in a sidecar at their side.

At this point realizing I'd need to scale back my eating in order to save room for that which was to come it was to a truncated portion of the humorously named ""Amaze-Balls"" that I was treated and with plenty of spice in the porky sausage finding levity amidst carrots glazed in sweet chutney the name proved quite appropriate, that same sausage finding even more spice when paired to Sriracha on one of Oldschool's personal-sized pizzas, the crust a bit more doughy than I'd prefer but the toppings well balanced allowing several divergent flavors their time in the spotlight while also serving to temper the burn.

Rounding out the savories, though there are at least a half-dozen more which warrant attention when I return, it was a duo of sandwiches that Lea sent out and with her time at Skinnyfats already apparent in several prior courses both the substantial New Beet Generation and sized-down Mayham were the sort of things one could probably make at home, but most likely wouldn't - the goat cheese marrying nicely to the thickly sliced beets on soft rye while the briny ham and crisp apples melded beneath a veil of melted cheese.

Unfortunately informed that the Ice Cream Malt Cake had sold out during the Grand Opening it was with a duo, rather than a three, desserts that the meal would end and while I admit to being an absolute sucker for any form of bread pudding it was actually the chocolate cake that stole the show, the substantial cocoa notes finding a whole new level when paired to frosting imbued with bitter stout...though that isn't to say I didn't scrape every bit of the boozy bread pudding plate clean, either...just that the cake is possibly the best I've found in this city to date.

Still a work in progress, the décor needing a bit of work while some sort of sound absorption would go a long way in protecting diners from overwrought kids, there is undoubtedly a lot to love about Old School Brewing Company even for those who do not personally favor beer, a strong compliment to a place that could just as easily mail-it-in with the same boring menu as any number of other 24/7 spots but instead chooses to break the mold.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,7,4,U1VqnCk7kBWFwYZ904PeKQ

5413844,2016-07-27,0,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"Reader be warned: This is a negative review but it is based solely on my experiences on Tuesday nights during the Geeks Who Drink Trivia. If you don't plan on going this pub between 8pm and 10pm on Tuesday this review likely won't be relevant for you save for the good points. 

I have been to this pub many times during trivia on Tuesday nights. The beer is good, the food is better. The trivia is best.

The friendliness of the staff is awesome. Everyone has smiles and seems to want to do a good job. Unfortunately once the place swells with customers for Trivia you are out of luck if you want things like drinks or food in a timely manner. I am saddened to say that I've had only one positive experience as far the service goes for the many times I've gone on Trivia night. I've had almost every flavor of awful service dispensed to me. I've had servers never come by to take orders, servers getting the wrong orders, servers not coming by for 30 minutes or longer to replenish drinks and servers taking orders and then never putting them in to the kitchen. Thankfully I've never had a rude server. I really believe their only problem being shorthanded on Tuesday nights. The unfortunate consequence of this is if you show up at 7:50 for 8pm Trivia you likely won't be able to have food or drinks until 8:30 as the staff just cannot cope with the volume of customers brought in by the weekly event. They also frequently run out of certain beers and sometimes have a limited menu (if you are lucky enough to be able to get your hands on a menu). This has been ongoing for months. It's really disheartening that nothing has been done to match the need for service on these occasions. 

To complete this criticism sandwich: The food is very good. The pizzas are amazing. I highly recommend any pizza they have. Wurst and Tots is another favorite and their breakfast sandwiches are all worthy of a 5 star tasty rating.",CYccznHIW4f7dvy9jY1wPQ,0,0,2,aIfZmtNIA90ZDsN9-XQ5xA

5567787,2016-01-31,1,AedKwfr0VdNj7Xmx70GW6g,"A friend invited me to come here last night for their 1 year anniversary. It was my 1st time going. The service was HORRIBLE. We had a server named Tessa and once we sat down, it took a good 15 mins for anyone to even come over. We ordered 1 beer flight each and that took another 15 minutes to come out. When that came out, we ordered another one since it took so long the 1st time. Well I'm not sure if she kept forgetting or what because it took 35 mins to get that next flight! Then she apologies and says our next flights are complimentary since its taking so long. Then, she only brings out 1 flight- there's two of us. Then our bread pudding was hard as brick! It was inedible! We were finally just fed up and asked for our check. I looked at the check and she charged us for the flights she said would be complimentary. I wasn't going to argue because we didn't want to stay any longer.  It's an understatement to say that my first experience here was one of the worst services I ever had. Actually, THE only bad service I've ever had. We got there at 715p and left close to 10p- not because we had beers in our hands but it took that long to get even just one flight beer in our hand. Another kicker was that we saw other tables in her area that were getting served right away!!!! Oh! And don't try that peach hefe that the tour guide recommended.

All in all, it was a party. They had free beer/food tastings (pairings & you voted for your fave) and handed a gift bag (shirt, keychain, shot glass, coupon, etc) to all attendees! This was totally unexpected and a very nice thing to do. 

They also had an $11, three course meal 1st anniversary special so we had to experience that. It took about 30 minutes to obtain a table in the crowded dining room. I don't even know how long dinner took, it seemed like 2 hours. They were short staffed (??) and our server seemed to be covering almost the entire dining room. I tasted all their brews and the stout and vanilla porter were very good. The rest were decent too. The lounge with gaming is separated from the dining room.

I'm not really sure how to review this place. It's an awkward and very spacious location. We opted for the restaurant side, which is huge. It's a little too well lit for my taste and there are rows and rows of booths as far as the eye can see. They just recently opened, but the decor is bare, and that's being kind. The walls are stark and there is really no ambiance to speak of.

The menu is small and despite the restaurant being completely empty the server only had one menu for our table and promised to find another one for us, which she did after a while. For a restaurant this large, I'm pretty surprised they don't have more menus, especially since they are printed paper on clipboards. 

The menu didn't look too exciting and after a while of perusing neither me nor my dining companion could find anything we wanted to try. Our server was so nice and friendly, we felt obligated to order something so I went with a house brewed hef. The server offered me a sample to start and after taking a sip, I knew I wanted nothing to do with that, since the flavor didn't do anything for me. My friend got a cider. We also shared some tater tots. The waitress recommended this house brew and offered me a sample of brew first off, which worked out well. She described the Flavors in it and I lost interest after she mentioned bubble gum. I still have it a sip and and I didn't enjoy it one bit. So glad they gave me a sample first. The tots were basic but I didn't really enjoy any of the flavors of the beer cheese and bbq dipping sauces.

I understand they are new and are working out all the kinks, including the menu and drinks. I wanted to like the place and although I didn't try too many options, I can't see making any special effort to return. I hope they can put a little more decor on the walls, lighten up the atmosphere and develop their menu a bit and I could see this place being successful, but for now it's dullsville. Maybe even adding a trivia night would help the restaurant portion a bit. I always root for new places, so I wish the best for them.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,5,2,0EGg7Gnz0VvJX8oOatJelw
