-Go with popular choices of combos and snacks rather than ordering dal - combo or Dum Aloo combo. It will be quick and good.

Had the chicken tikka masala with a mango lassi. The mango lassi was good. The masala was over priced for the quality it was. It is in a food court and should be evaluated as fast food. Not the greatest, but okay when you are hungry and anything will do. Not the best if you are looking for good Indian food. Though the naan was pretty good. The question I had to ask was ""where's the chicken?""  Too much sauce for the amount of meat. 

So, in the end, the value to quality did not justify the price. But if you get that late night craving for Indian food in the city that never sleeps, this would be an okay stop as they are open 24 hours, but for a great meal of Indian food, find somewhere else.",jSw32S5s2qgUBVhuLvGf_w,0,0,3,hm5CWlgQSWegXgsgNFxlzg

I was craving for Indian food, and my friend stated lets not go there it has many not-so-great reviews.

I told him not to believe it (yet I am here writing one :)

I played it safe and ordered the idlis (rice cakes)

Normally when the idlis are good, the chutney is bad or the sambar is bad. For all 3 to be excellent, its a feat I have not  experienced anywhere in the world.

Then I ordered samosas to go. Of course, they were pure heaven,

It was so good that my friend and I who were staying at a distant casino started craving for both the idlis & samosas everyday !! We would pack tons of food from there and bring it back.

Kudos to the people who run it (Punjabis I think) for running this awesome place that even is open 24 hours I think (though the late night food is limited)",mnfk9Cjoej2sVCcO__bI3A,1,1,5,Rc-4_gHk6JePi7zsUoyDnA
303406,2012-04-13,2,PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA,"I regretted not trying out India Masala the last time I was at the Riviera.  An Indian restaurant in a food court?  I didn't really trust it.  But a couple days later I saw it on Yelp with plenty of good reviews.  So when I finally headed back to the Riviera a few months later to check out roller derby, I knew where my dinner stop would be.

The menu is large and has plenty of vegetarian options.  We were starving and not sure how large the servings would be so we went a little crazy; we got an order of saag paneer, vegetable korma, and a masala dosa.  The saag and korma both came with a side of rice and naan, while the dosa came with two chutneys.

The dosa came out first and was HUGE.  I know dosas are large, but I'm pretty sure I could have thrown the thing in Lake Mead and rode it around like a boat.  It was full of potatoes, peas, and lentils and had a nice samosa-taste to it.  I was so hungry that I completely forgot about my chutneys and didn't try them at all.  Boo. 

The saag was good, but lacking a depth of flavor I get at Mint and Origin.  It wasn't bad, but considering the price was the same I'd rather eat at one of those two restaurants.  The vegetable korma was also good but looked a little different from others I've had.  This one was more red in color (instead of yellow) and had a smoky taste to it.  The sides of rice were large and you get a piece of naan the size of your plate.  I love naan, but this one was a little boring for me.  Plus one came out nice and doughy while the other was overcooked and had a crunch to it.

We also ordered a mango lassi and it was undrinkable.  The consistency was too thin and almost tasted like spoiled yogurt.  It went in the trash.

In all, this place is good and I would come back if we were at the Riviera, but the prices are pretty ridiculous to me considering they are in a food court.  Isn't the point of a food court to get cheap grub instead of paying the extra money to sit-down somewhere?  Their appetizers (samosas and such) were about $7 while the dosa was about $8.  I knew the dosa was more food and therefore a better deal so that's why we ordered it instead of an appetizer.  Entrees were around $11 while combo platters were around $13.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,6,0,3,0VeVpi11XEcwn_Czw-1scA

And the two dishes we ordered were fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try more! I just wish we didn't have to go to the Riviera to do it!

The food itself was decent. We got chicken vindaloo, chole bature and mango lassi. The portions were all generous enough to feed two very hungry people. The chicken vindaloo was very nice and spicy, but used entirely too much tomato. The chole bature was spot on. The bature was obviously made fresh and a great balance of crispy and soft. The chole was a little stale tasting but still delicious. I particularly enjoyed the mango lassi. It was nice and thick with strong mango flavor.

For those who've been to its other location on Flamingo near UNLV, this isn't as aesthetically pleasing.  However, something about the griminess of the surrounding area made the experience that much better.  In fact, I prefer this one as it somewhat feels more authentic.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have an all you can eat lunch special unlike the restaurant; but hey, it's open 24/7 so I guess I just found a new joint to hit up after a long night of debauchery!!

I find it quite amazing how a fast food stall in a food court can offer such impressive array of dishes that most Indian restaurants don't.  In this case, the menu comprises of northern and southern Indian specialties--some of which I've never even heard of before--thus it'll definitely take several visits to try every single food from this place.  I thoroughly enjoyed their vegetable samosa especially with the tamarind chutney.  Another great choice is their tandoori combo which includes tandoori chicken, garlic chicken, chicken tikka, and chicken sheesh kabab with a side of saag paneer and naan.

TIP: Park at the lot next to Peppermill and enter from the front entrance to avoid the long, confusing walk through the old casino floor.

Overall, India Masala is definitely a great spot for Indian food any time of day.  It's right what they say that some of the greatest things out there are found on the most unexpected places.

""Shari. It's in a food court. At the Riviera. Sharing a kitchen with a burger joint.""

I know, I know, I know, but you know what? It's not only some of the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas (and as far as I know, I've left no tandoor untouched), but it's the kind that tastes even better the next day, just like homemade. Order big - you'll be glad of the leftovers later.

After a delicious first meal there back in the spring of 2010, we'd speak longingly of returning, but every time we'd think about parking, think about navigating the Riviera, and then think about sitting in a food court that, while clean, is still an old food court in an old casino, and we'd end up somewhere else, somewhere with waiters and easy parking.

But then one day we had a coupon for a meal elsewhere in the Riviera and, alas, the meal was pretty bad. So bad that we decided to push our plates aside and walk across the casino to get some India Masala to take home with us.

After that, no more excuses. We have this down pat: if I drop off my husband by the front door. (The food court is right through the southern front door opening onto the Strip.) Then I circle around a few times, pick up him and his Enormous Bag of Fragrant Wonders, and within 20 minutes (15 if the traffic is right), we're back home and laying out a delicious Indian feast on our dining room table. 

Mike always gets the chicken tikka masala, which he described as perfectly spiced with good-quality ingredients. (You can read his review here, too, but I think he was too pleased with the taste and surprised at such a find to take the time for much description.)

We both like the naan - it's enormous and fluffy. I almost always get the shahi paneer - creamy, spicy sauce with cheese - made at about a 7/10 per my request. (If your server doesn't ask how hot you want it, let them know. That's true of any Indian restaurant. Otherwise, if you like spicy food, you risk them playing it safe.) 

Unfortunately, shahi paneer isn't on the late-night menu. That's a shame, as I can personally account to some lost 1 a.m. sales during summer break. 

In fact, I was going to take off a star for this and also because it's in a food court, but that's really unfair. If we stick to food court expectations, this is a 7 out of 5. The flavours are as layered and subtle as anywhere else in town, at least for what we order. (In fact, the only place that makes a better shahi paneer, in my opinion, is a weird dive on the east side with rotten service, so this is really my top option.) Service has always been friendly. And although the late night menu is smaller and more expensive, the regular menu is available until 10 p.m., the same as most restaurants. 

So, yes, the ambience is severely lacking, but you know what? India Masala transcends its location. I started this review regretting that I couldn't give it five stars, but that's just nonsense. This is wonderful food, served by dependable and polite people, and it tastes and looks great when I bring it home. FIVE STARS!",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,19,14,5,RhNBdGYZgGkG9eYPo6v6PA

While waiting for my order, I wandered down the food court to check out the other vendors and happened upon the India Masala / Gaylord India mini-truck parked outside - I had no idea that the Rio Hotel's Gaylord India restaurant was related to this food court satellite.

Excellent service. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo (requested extra spicy), and my friends ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both dishes come with rice and naan. Both come out to ~$13 after tax. Both plates give large portions relative to all other Indian cuisines I've been to. 

CHICKEN VINDALOO: kinda spicy, I had hoped for spicier, but oh well. I loved it. They use dark meat from the chicken and don't skimp out on your portion. The potatoes could've been better prepared. It was a little hard or undercooked maybe. The sauce was amazing and very well spiced. Rice was okay; no comments there. The naan was great and fluffy, and it was pretty heavily glistened with butter. 

CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA: I tasted some of my friend's tikka masala and I thought it was also really good. Definitely one of the best plates I've had for Indian cuisine. It was reasonably spicy and spiced perfectly. Not many other comments since I only tasted it.

I was hesitant to venture into the lifeless and downright creepy Riviera but  I quickly passed the slot machines and the desperate souls attached to them on my way to the equally comatose food court.

As suicidal thoughts entered my mind, my spirits were promptly lifted by the friendly folks at India Masala.  My eyes wanted the entire menu but I restrained myself with an order of naan, daal maharani, mango lassi, and gulab jamun.  I carted it back to my hotel and devoured it all in no time.

This place is so good! The family and I wanted to get a bite to eat before watching Society of Seven at the Riveria Hotel and Casino so we made our merry way to the Food Court since there's a variety to choose from.

Walking up to the food court, you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in Indian food. I LOVE Indian food so of course I didn't care to check out the other spots, I wanted some curry and naan! 

I ordered the chicken tikka masal, chicken vindaloo and naan. OMG, so freaking good! Both were served with white rice. The naan was like the size of my face! It was coated in butter and I used it to soak up sauce from my dish. The chicken vindaloo was my favorite. It was nice and spicy and had a ton of flavor.  I devoured the whole thing and ate some of the chicken tikka masal since that was my sister's dish. She liked it too. It could have been spicier but that's just personal preference. 

It was kinda expensive but Indian food is kind of expensive as is. Each entrée was $10.99 and the naan was $1.99. The food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. I got a cup of water and the guy said if I wanted more water he'd fill it up for me. That was nice of him!

I really like this place. When I go back to Vegas, I will for sure come here for my Indian fix. I'm craving Indian food for dinner now!

I have tried chicken biriyani, butter chicken combo, utthapam and Tandoori combo. This is a north Indian style kitchen and expecting south Indian dishes like uthappam to be good is my mistake. Biriyani was decent, Butter chicken melted in my mouth. There was a girl on the cash register was explaining that her favorite drink is Mango lassi to one of the person ahead of me in the line, so I wanted to try it out, it turned out to be the best of all Mango lassi I had.

Naan was soft and yummy.  $15.99 for Tandoori Combo may be little pricy, but better than most Indian lunch buffet I had in Vegas.

I learned that they have another restaurant near the strip where they have buffet (India Masala Bar & Grill - 1040 E Flamingo Rd Las Vegas, NV 89119) and more like proper restaurant. I am going to try it the next time when I will be in Vegas.

Prices range from about $11 and up per dish. So by food court standards its expensive. I ordered 2 dishes and the guy wanted to make sure someone was eating with me, since it was a lot if food. Lol...do I look like I can eat all that? Even if I was going to eat it all, it was none of his business. 

I ordered chicken Tikka and it was sprinkled in some kind of curry powder and was very dry. The meat was red on the outside,  like tandori chicken usually is. Not the chicken tikka Im used too. Wasnt the best. I also ordered the chicken tikka Masala with was 75% sauce 25% chicken, served with equal parts of white rice.

I have access to really good Indian food in the OC and I am not a fan of this food. And I was left hungry and disappointed. The beast, however enjoyed his meal and has a tradition of coming here  every year when hes in town.

4484300,2010-04-01,1,PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA,"A couple of weeks ago my husband and I went to a festival celebrating Indian culture and food at the county building. While there, we sampled food from several Indian restaurants around town, and were most pleased with what we had at the booth of India Masala, which is permanently located in the Riviera. For the first time we had dosa, a lentil and rice pancake/crepe that is a typical dish of Southern India. We happened to pick up a postcard offering 25% off our check so we decided to head to the Riviera to see what else was being offered.

It's no surprise that the Riviera is on its last legs, and ranks up there with Circus Circus as being the most rundown hotel on the strip. We certainly worked up an appetite as we made the looooong walk from the parking garage to the food court (next time I'd valet in the front of the casino). No, we weren't expecting Indian Masala to be a semi-fast food restaurant, but as it turns out, it was. The prices aren't really justified considering this, but the food is really good and it was packed with more Indians and convention attendees than any other tenant's space when we were there (see below), so we figured it was safe to stay. We had to wait about in line for five minutes and then another ten minutes or so for our food, which was a bit frustrating, but I felt rewarded when I got my dosa. Today I opted for one stuffed with spinach, the palak dosa ($7.99), but you can also choose from a filling of chickpeas (chole), potatoes (masala), or no filling at all (plain). It is served with what I learned to be the traditional accompaniments, sambar (a vegetable soup) and coconut chutney (imagine a thick and textured almond milk). There is also a third side that I can best describe as a pureed and spiced red bell pepper spread. The dosa is flavorful enough on its own, but the sauces add another dimension and were very much enjoyed. The dosa itself is delicate, with a browned, crisp exterior and a soft, lightly chewy interior. You can get a better idea of the textural difference when you order it plain, but the filling makes it a meal. I must say it's a dish that's growing on me, and I'd bear the pain of walking through that casino to enjoy another one day. My husband was less thrilled with his dish, but it seems to me that the emphasis here is on lesser known Southern Indian cuisine so chicken vindaloo ($11.99) might not have been the best option. This vindaloo was flavorful but not nearly hot enough for Ian who asked them to make it as spicy as possible. The larger problem was the color of the sauce, which was reminiscent of an artificially colored sweet and sour. The color should have been deeper and darker had it been a result of the spices. Things that don't look natural probably aren't, so we'll just say this color most likely wasn't derived from where it should have been.

If you are interested in trying a new kind of Indian dish that isn't available at other restaurants around town (as far as I know), I would definitely recommend coming here for the dosa. I'd be willing to try a few other things but I think what I had was the most reasonably priced for you what you get, and certainly the most unique.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,6,5,3,dp4sqVP7k8QODaMmxxtf2w

Hmm. What to make of this place. It's Indian food. In a food court. In a strip hotel. OK so it's the Riviera, but still.

Cutting to the chase, the Butter Chicken was yummy. It had bell peppers in it, which stood out for some reason. Maybe because there usually aren't bell peppers in Butter Chicken? IDK. I liked what they brought to the party. The plate comes with a good amount of Basmati Rice, and a ginormous piece of Naan. In my book, it doesn't get much better than savoring some delicious Butter Chicken sauce with some Naan.

So the food was good, but back to the place. The fact that we even have Indian food in a food court in this town makes me happy. The down side is that you're paying more for it. Like I said, it's in a strip hotel, albeit the Riviera. They're probably paying a lot for that location, so their prices are naturally higher. I mean, $12 for a plate of Butter Chicken isn't insane, but it just feels weird because you're in a freakin' food court.

In any case, I left satisfied. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but I'd consider it if I'm ever back in the Riviera. Like the next time I watch some roller derby!

p.s. I pretty much always order Mango Lassi if they offer it. I've had better, but it was pretty good.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,5,4,HBULGKIc3aDP0VWCWLUzSw

SITREP

Hot Dam!  What a find when wandering along Las Vegas Blvd at 2am!  

MENU

LV Yelper Paolo had recommended the Butter Chicken, Naan, Rice, ALL GOOD, and this particular dish tends to be my ""litmus test"" for different places from Seattle to Sacramento to L.A. and now Vegas, and I have to say it was De-LISH.

PRICE YIKES!

But the combo was about $14 after tax and tip, with this and something that I would consider to be very pricey if at home or work.  However, this was my Vegas trip and in most situations while traveling, I won't spare the expense for the experience.

THE LOWDOWN

A great find in Vegas for Indian fare!",3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w,9,5,4,TqQPze8V-gvDzYiLWw5N5w

5199053,2011-03-29,10,PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA,"Not going to lie: It is hard for me to distinguish the culinary merits of India Masala from the joy of eating Indian in a food court. Food court discoveries are like finding $20 in your winter coat pocket, unexpected and put to immediate good use. In my world, every food court would have Indian. It would make trips to the mall immensely more pleasurable.

I had known of this McD's killer for quite some time, but it isn't too often that I end up at the Riviera. Actually, prior to the Sin City Rollergirls' bout I had been inside the Riviera a grand total of ZERO times. But, when we rolled up for derby action, I knew where I was headed - to curry land. To my surprise it is located right next to Super Burger (or something like that.) I love the sign.

The menu is extensive, including a nice selection of dosa. I definitely want to return to try one. However, on this trip, I went with the vegetarian combo, which comes with daal, chana masala and saag paneer, plus rice, naan and pickles. At around $12, it was not cheap. However, it did come with a beautiful, gigantic piece of naan. As for the actual dishes, the only one I wasn't fond of was the saag. It was underspiced perhaps as the only flavor was spinach, which I like, but it was a bit plain for me. Everything else was quality. Plus, the people behind the counter were sweet. When our naan was a little crispy, they happily prepared another one for us. As I left, I decided to try their chai, and it was disappointing as it lacked the strong clove and cardamom that I associate with a delicious chai. Alas, I was still happy with my court time experience.

They are open late (approximately 2am), which is a big bonus for night owls. The only odd thing is that the prices go up on the ""After Hours"" menu. However, I didn't see an indication as to when exactly it is after hours. 

Either way, pretty sure I will find myself back in this food court in the future. I am a married lady, but if I weren't I would find a India Masala/Sin City Rollergirls evening an entertaining 4th or 5th date. Just an idea.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,11,4,o2VDxp_st6W4jPve0MgpaA

And the Chicken Tikka Masala and Masala Dosa was very well seasoned and freshly made with a over sized piece of naan. Jasmine rice also comes with the tikka masala. The food is delicious and they give you plenty of it. The staff was friendly. Seating area is limited since its a food court.

* Owner was very nice and helpful and told me that if I wanted spicy, just ask for extra chilies, which I did and it was much better than cheap-o packages of hot sauce.  She also explained some of the more exotic items on the menu to me.

* The Chicken Tika Masala was OK.  Granted, it was missing more of the complex Indian spices and became one- dimensional after a few bites.  But the nan bread was hot & fresh.  And heck, it's a food court and much better than Subway or pizza-by-the-slice.

I'm still trying to figure out why it's here.  Do guests of the Riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors?  All I see are old people playing slots!  It doesn't matter though.  I'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous.

Not only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south Indian dishes most places don't.  I only wished I was hungrier when I came to try more things.  We ended up ordering the tandoori combo which included 4 different meats and the saag paneer accompanied by 2 orders of naan.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.

The two reasons for no 5 star rating are the location (hate the parking garage) and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places.  There are too many Indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all you can eat.  Still, it doesn't take away from how good their food is.

We don't eat onion or garlic and the chef was really accommodating with that too whereas other restaurants are always talking about how everything's premade.

Definitely not disappointed. I truly would have never found this place if it were not for Yelp. And probably even if I did, I would have been reluctant to try it since it is in a food court.

If you are going to India Masala it is for nothing else but good food. I mean who says I am going to the food court to eat dinner? Other than maybe high school kids. 

Prices were a bit pricey for a food court but it is in a hotel on the strip. However, to my surprise I had more than enough food and could hardly finish my meal. I paid about $15.00 for a butter chicken (spicy) meal with rice, naan and soda. I definitely was not disappointed. 


You wait a little longer for your food than we would be accustomed to in a food court setting but my food was fresh and oh so good. I am literally salivating now just thinking about it. 

My only set back was I had one little piece of lemon grass that was too big so when I bit into it it was not fun for me.

Good sign for me is when I see native people eating their own food. There is nothing worse than going to an ethnic place to eat and you do not see any people of their own kind there.

Best Naan in town, hands down.

This is definate must try for any Indian Food Lovers. You can not be disappointed. It is definate return and new fave for me.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,12,3,4,Xsa0hw5bG1_WmutPRfbthg

My expectations were low, but I persevered. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which came with rice and a side of naan.

The curry was decent. Not very spicy and more on the bland side than I would prefer, but still ok. The rice was dry and overcooked. It was clearly sitting around a while so I avoided it. The naan was my favorite part of the meal. It was overly oily, but delicious. We were tempted to order an extra one for dipping, but decided against it.

Decent for a food court and probably ten times better than the other food court options at the Riviera, but that isn't saying much.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,7,2,0mIX36Isb3WbDLkuWREDTw
