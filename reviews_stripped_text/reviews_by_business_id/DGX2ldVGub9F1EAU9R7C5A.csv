I've come here many times as it's close and I love the drive thru component.  My experiences here are NEVER good.  

I've had 2 sandwiches be made incorrectly.  The first time was over a month ago, I ordered a turkey bacon flatbread and got a chicken bacon.  The girl was very kind when I went in and remade my sandwich.  

Today was a different story.  I ordered a 6"" turkey bacon avocado on white flatbread with cheese lettuce onion banana peppers pickles olives and ranch.   To start off, the girl who took my order in the drive thru didn't ask me step by step, she took my whole orders. I then moved up to the window and she told me that they are out of white flatbread and asked if I wanted wheat which I said was fine.  I was rung out by a man and because of the interaction with the girl who took my order I wanted to check it.

Immediately I knew it was wrong.  There was spinach, tomatoes, green pepper, and mustard.  AND to top it off, it was on white flatbread which I was told they didn't have.  

I went inside and told them this.  The female had a lot of tattoos and her ears gauged.  She wasn't concerned with my incorrectly made sandwich one bit.  The man working had to tell her to remake mine first.  She began making it on wheat flatbread and I said ""Do you have white since you made my other sandwich on white?"".  She said ""this is all we have"".  Meanwhile the guy working went and got a bag of frozen white flatbread out for me.  She CONTINUED putting it on the wheat even though he was going to heat up the white for me.  Unbelievable.  He told her to give me a footlong for the inconvenience which was appreciated.  She then made my sandwich and I left.  

I am appalled that you have someone working at an organization like this.  Being a food and beverage manager even if I worked at Subway that type of behavior and level of customer service is unacceptable.  

She looked like she was completely miserable.  If she's going to be in customer service she should definitely be in the back of house with her attitude.  The name on the receipt was Juliette.  

I don't know if this location is understaffed or if they need more extensive training but the inconsistency in service and quality is very noticeable and will turn away business including mine.",gwXobKRw1ihYiKPqwUE9xQ,4,1,1,226NFYrGOcBAfABU-8nBBg

I do not eat ham and have had turkey substituted in many times and many different Subway shops. This individual says they can't do that. Can't throw two pieces of turkey on a sub in place of ham because they pay more for the turkey. I can understand that...but how much more do you pay? $30? $40? $100??

I know most of you have been to a Subway at one time or another and many of you are 'Yay!' and some of you are 'Blah.'  But this Subway here by my part of town is my fav place to pick up a Subway sub!  This one is pretty new, maybe a year old or so and is the sub shop is connected to a Winchell's Donut.  Pretty good way of cancelling out the benefits of eating healthy, eh Subway?  Get a sub with all the veggie fixins' and chase it with an order of glazed donut holes?  Meal of champions I tell you!  

This is my fav Subway mainly because their ingredients are always super fresh looking whenever I go there.  The assistant manager I met there (I refer to these guys as the 'Ass. Man.' ha ha) said he tries to run a pretty tight ship because other Subways he's been to don't  live up to the company's high standards.  His efforts must be paying off because he mentioned that this particular Subway has been consistently getting the most sales on the SW part of town the past several months.  That's saying a lot because there is a Subway on almost every block you go.  See kids, high quality always leads to high profits!  Don't skimp on your standards.

Back to the sandwiches.  The ingredients here I can see are always fresh, nothing ever looks old.  The tomatoes aren't soggy, the lettuce isn't wilted, and the red onions aren't stinky-slimy.  This Subway even serves spinach!  Rare find in this town, most Subways I go to don't have this on their veggie menu.  I've never been let down by any of the sandwiches I've gotten here, I leave pretty satisfied.  The bread is fresh and fluffy (not flattened like you see at some Subways) and the meats don't look like they've been sitting out all day.  

Personally, I love the Subway $5 foot long menu.  I work out a lot so I'm happy knowing I can go have a cheap, healthy meal afterwards.  One of my fav sandwiches is the Oven Roasted Chicken Breast with ALL the veggies, provolone, extra lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, light mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper.  Another one of my favs is the Spicy Italian.  I also like the Meatball Marinara with provolone, tomatoes, spinach, bell peppers, and banana peppers.  So good toasted!  Lately, I've been on their Orchard Chicken Salad sandwich kick (ahem...not toasted, ick), I like the apples and golden raisins in it.  And for $5 for a foot long...with chips or 2 cookies and a drink for under $8?  I can use this sandwich for 2 meals, unless I'm super hungry!  Or have to share with my fiance...which means I have to remove my double order of red onions (sigh).  And give her one of my cookies.  Fine, fine.  You can have my Oatmeal Raisin, but the Chocolate Chip is mine!

Another few reasons I love this Subway?  The service and the cleanliness.  The staff have always been pleasant to me and never complain when trying to pack my over-stuffed sandwich (they have been known to be super heavy because of my veggie obsession) into a bag.  This place is usually pretty clean too, bathroom is kept up, and the floors are always mopped.  if you find a dirty area let them know and someone will be on it.  

One of the coolest things about this Subway?  It's open 24 hours a day!  First one in my area, now if I have a late night craving for a sub I can drive down here at 2 in the morning if I want (I sometimes do on those long, Halo 3 filled nights).  I heard this Subway (and subsequently, Winchell's) is open 24 hours because a big part of their clientele are the nurses and doctors that work in the St. Rose hospital almost literally right next door.  In fact, the hospital is large chunk of their revenue.  This Subway also makes it easy for you too with a drive thru.  Yep, a Subway drive thru!  Don't even have to get out of my car for a Subway fix.  Hey doc, you got a heart surgery in 5 minutes?  No problem!  Just don't forget to wash your hands after you eat.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,1,4,hsSN7ebLuebyi6x5EW9IEA

I don't know what her name was but this girl (Monday morning) made my sandwich as if there was an earth quake happening. At first she cut the bread wrong and was having an incredibly difficult time putting the meat on. Eventually she started over. And when I asked for avocado, she cut 3 tiny slivers and didn't even spread it out. It hurt me to watch this go down. I'm not sure if it was her first day or if she just hated her job but I've literally never seen an uglier sandwich, and I told her that. I was so jealous of the other customers because they had this younger guy who was literally a sandwich artist, nice and neat. She couldn't even wrap the damn thing. At one point I really considered walking out but I was so hungry, I bought it. Fire this girl and put her in the donut shop.

I ordered a cheese pizza for my kid, a 6"" veggie meal for my wife, and a 12"" veggie meal for myself. I noticed the cheeses and veggies looked subpar, but decided to order against my best judgement since we were already there. While I was filling drinks, my daughter was complaining about her pizza being cold. It was litterally still icy. As I walked up to get it reheated, the only employee (...3rd shift ever) walked off quickly to finish whatever tasks she was attending to. I saw her enter the freezer room on my second attempt to call her over, and again, she doesn't hear me. She was clearly dodging me while fumbling with trash and whatever else. On my third, louder ""excuse me"", she walked over reluctantly. I told her the pizza was cold. She literally grabbed the box with her dirty gloves, and only realized the sanitation error when I called her out for potentially risking my kids health.  I immediately asked for a refund after witnessing this major health hazard. This was a pizza for my 3yr old daughter, and at this point I wasn't confident in eating what I ordered... with just cause. I was denied a refund, even though the only food consumed was a bite of cold pizza... which by the way ruined any chance of her eating dinner tonight. I paid in cash, but they claimed they couldn't open the drawer to refund me. Then, I offered to buy a drink or cookie to get the droor open. I was denied again by a woman named Savanna via phone. After this extremely frustrating and gross experience, I left with an unfed family and partial refund. I can't believe I was expected to eat food after witnessing an unsanitary process. I was not in the wrong, but was penalized somehow. Why is this location allowing an employee with 3 days experience to run the entire restaurant? She clearly doesn't understand basic health department protocol. No respect! Terrible service! UNSANITARY!!!",Sznlzx1IAFcZUfrZQFfa3A,0,0,1,fb1AEZ2YSurqfA_v5PAeLg

I informed the server I have an allergy to milk (which includes cheese) and watched as the server picked cheese out of the steak and proceeded to scoop the contaminated steak onto my sandwich. They also used a visibly dirty knife to cut the sandwich and my boyfriend's wrap. I watched another employee ""clean"" the same knife for the next customer by wiping it with a paper towel.  This is cross contamination, there are people with really severe allergies and that could kill or seriously harm them. The lobby is dirty and unkempt, possibly explaining why an ant would be on the checkout counter. I told the server to inform his manager about the bug.

Drive up for drive thru and was told someone will be with me soon -- we left after 5mins of radio silence. Smh. This was at 10am with one car in the parking lot and no other cars in drive thru ???????

Love Subway for a quick meal and we frequent the Warm Springs/Buffalo location because of the drive thru.  Half the time they get it wrong... the order taker is almost always rude.  Okay whatever because how excited can you sound taking sandwich orders all day?  But when you're paying for ""deluxe"" sandwiches you expect some effort.  They take your full order up front and I feel like they don't even write it down and go off memory.  Which is why the sandwiches are come out wrong because they forget items or make things up in their head instead of clarifying the order.  

- Ordered vinegar but got mayo
- Ordered american cheese but got NO cheese 
- Ordered extra olives but got only 5 pieces if any...seriously??? 

You can't expect customers to open the sandwich up at the drive thru to check their order before driving off (out of courtesy for those behind you in line who have waited long just as you have)...So I'll just leave this review & take my business elsewhere next time.",-8FDlhUsu5_lVONV_aOnGA,0,1,1,SgciLbVerf4QGCLi_ZzYPQ

That being said the customer service at this location is terrible! I went through the drive thru at around 1130 pm and the sign is dark, not lit up. I sat there for 5 or 10 minutes with no voice to acknowledge that i am there. So I finally say hello are you open? I am then met with a smart ass sarcastic voice from what i can tell is a young boy who says to me ""i was with a customer what do you want?!"" As if i am bothering the kid! So i say im sorry to bother you. Then he begins to rant about me being rude for asking if theyre open! I didnt even entertain or argue i simply drove off. Im noticing these days this type of attitude from this generation is common. I will never go back to this establishment.

However, when I said that I didn't know that if I didn't say yes to the extra meat I would get no meat. This is what I call stealing. The employees have either been advised to do this by management or they just do this for whatever reason. If you are looking to see what Subway is near you to buy a sandwich and this location pops up, go to the next closest location. Or if you want to be served by employees who were obviously in a hurry as my no meat sandwich was sloppily put together, and overall demeanor of staff rushing their customers, this Subway meets all that criteria.",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,1,3oRey9QllCCUso9NPeqMYA
