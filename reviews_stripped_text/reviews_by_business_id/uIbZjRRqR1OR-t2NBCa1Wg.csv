12:45PM - Placed order to be delivered to Monte Carlo. Order was supposed to be delivered at 1:16PM.

1:15PM - received a call from a woman thinking that our order was downstairs and ready to be picked up. Instead she called to inform that they're out of grilled cheese stuffed crust. So our pizza wasn't even made yet, awesome. I asked her how much longer it will take, she said within 8-10 minutes and make sure to wait downstairs by the valet because delivery guy can't go up. So down to the lobby we go. 

1:30PM - No sign of pizza guy. Called Pizza Hut, a man said our delivery guy JUST went out the door. 

1:40PM - still waiting out in the cold, delivery guy finally calls and confirms location.

1:50 PM - PIZZAAAAAAAAA

Way to take over an hour to fulfill our order and be completely inaccurate in ETA, Pizza Hut. Only an extra star because our delivery guy, Ermias, was very polite and apologetic even though I knew it was probably not his fault.

My friends and I were guests at the Vdara hotel and wanted to have a quick dinner before lining up at the ridiculous hour of 8:30 at Marquee at the Cosmopolitan.

Pizza seemed like a great solution. Affordable, delicious, and able to be delivered to our room while we got ready to go out.

WRONG! First warning sign...the guy who answered the phone did not know where the Vdara hotel was. Mind you, this pizza hut was only 2 miles from the Vdara and part of the new CityCenter complex. How could you miss it? You can see it from the 15! To add to that, it took me more than 20 minutes to give the dumbass the address and our order. The genius on the phone must have asked for the hotel's zip code 6 or 7 times. Yes. I spent more time giving this incompetent excuse for an employee the hotel's address rather than giving him the actual food order. After all that, we were told that the pizza would be there in 30 minutes.

After an hour, we called to inquire about the status of our order. I was informed that our order could not be found in the system using our name, phone number, or address. After our order was placed only an hour before! Again, the employee on the phone was rude and extremely incompetent and could offer no explanation as to what had happened to our food.

2898010,2015-05-30,0,uIbZjRRqR1OR-t2NBCa1Wg,"I would rate this a zero if i was able to.

I ordered 2 medium pizzas and 2 orders of chicken wings for delivery.  When the food was delivered no chicken wings were delivered I called the store and told them of the mistake.  I was referred to a manager by the name of ""Venegas"".  She apologized for the mistake and asked if we still wanted the wings to which we replied ""yes"".  Venegas said she would get it to us as soon as possible.  Fast forward one hour and 5 minutes and we still had not received the wings.  So, once again, I called the store and asked to speak to a manager.  This time I talked to Jessica.  It turned out that the wings that were supposed to be delivered were never made or sent out for delivery.  Jessica apologized, said she was not aware of the situation and put me on a brief hold.  When she got back to me she stated that she could get us the wings and a $10 credit (which does not cover the actual expense of the 2 orders of chicken wings).  If you were to look at my order history with your company you will see that I am a frequent customer (I would assume more frequent than most).  But, after today that will no longer be the case.  I am the type of person who hates to complain but to actually just ignore my first complaint and do nothing about it is inexcusable and just plain bad customer service.  It is one thing to have an employee make a mistake and not follow through but to have a manager fail to deliver as promised shows poor expectations even above management level.
