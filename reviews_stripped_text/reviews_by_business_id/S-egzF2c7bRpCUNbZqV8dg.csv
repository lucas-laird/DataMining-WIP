The Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese was oozing with delicious brisket! I tried my mom's TNB burger and I wished for another stomach. I washed it all down with the Herb Infused Lemonade. So refreshing. We also got to try a secret item not on the menu. The buttermilk fried chicken on biscuit sliders were divine. But you also need to try the Sinful Tots! So good with my sandwich. Don't forget to leave room for dessert as the French Toast Bread Pudding was to die for. I was only sorry that I had share it with my Mom and sister!

150353,2016-02-23,0,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"I walked past a plate with a single large pancake overflowing onto the table. Their signature burger has a thick layer of mac-n-cheese spilling over the patty. The chicken and waffles is thick enough to hold a steak knife upright. Talk about American gluttony and comfort food at its best. 

While the menu houses some conceptually interesting dishes, overall, it wasn't anything that special. Call me old fashioned, but when eating a burger I like to be able to Hold my burger. Theirs is too big and sloppy to manage without fork and knife. We also tried the Monte Cristo- ham, turkey, cheese, and mustard on French toast. It was a little too sweet for me. The French toast overpowered the filling. Also, I was rather disappointed that their lattes and cappuccinos are brewed via machine... using powdered milk. No thank you. 

The food here wasn't that bad. It just didn't really live up to the hype. The truffle fries were probably the highlight for me- thin, crisp, delicious. And our server was welcoming with a great attitude.",3jGAIGtktbbv3rMpU08Sew,0,0,3,_hVV2SNHuGSyKg052ZK0cQ

Previously, we had the TNB Signature Burger, burger with baked crispy mac'n cheese and bacon jam(they are famous for this) and my wife had the Cobb Chicharon salad.

The last three times I have ordered, thinking it will be better this time, I have been disappointed and down right upset with today's order.  Waldorf Salad with no raisins (thats a main ingredient and not having them changes the balance of flavors).  No caramel sauce and no raisins in the very mushy bread pudding.  Ordered waffles and chicken, the chicken is over cooked and tastes burned but still cold in the middle.  Waffle is chewy, quite frankly, the Eggo waffles my kids eat are better.

308284,2015-12-11,0,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"Wow, this place is amazing.

First the service. Awesome. Me and my friend swing by for a late lunch after seeing this place on Yelp. The waitress, a blond lady (I believe her name was Jessica?) was very sweet and inviting. She came by the table many times and was always refilling our waters as soon as they started to drain down. As someone who works in a restaurant, I can say that she does a great job, and I hope the rest of the staff follows suite.

And now, the food.

At first what may seem pricy for a burger, really doesn't seem all that pricey once you receive your plate and pick up the massive meat and Mac and cheese mountain that is your entree. Not to mention truffle... Truffle everything. Unlike most non-fine dining restaurants, the truffle in this place really shines through, and the ""bacon jam"" is enough to make any bbq meat lover rejoice. Be warned though: this place is not for the weak of heart (or stomach). Although I haven't explored the full menu, it seems most of their dishes are extremely heavy and rich, so if that's not your thing, maybe this place isn't for you. But if affordable, gratuitous portions of ""heart attack food"" is your style, then you'll be coming back again and again.",-mLSUe9DdlY2QEmBbdNOYg,2,1,5,9x-lQEZ-enJNVYAYmY8pWQ

I ordered their house special burger with a side of truffle fries, and it was absolutely amazing! The others enjoyed biscuits and gravy, banana french toast, and the breakfast mac and cheese. The food was nothing short of fantastic. Overall, it was a great experience. 
However, they are receiving 2 stars because when we were closing our tab our table was  approached by a staff member asking us to move to the seating area so they could sit another table of guests who were waiting. Mind you, there was another table available next to us. I've never in my life been rushed out of a restaurant like that. It was extremely rude. When I asked to speak to the manager I was informed the woman who came over and asked us to hurry up and leave was not only the manager she is also the owner! Quite unfortunate.

To the owner of this establishment: You've created a beautiful menu, but if you don't learn customer service you'll never succeed.

When I got there I waited for over 15 minutes and this was at the later time that Grubhub gave. They weren't even busy, 3-4 tables at the time. When my food finally came out, they told me they were out of chocolate chip cookies and they canceled it. Not even a sorry, not can we offer you something else, nothing, ""We don't have it.  We canceled it."" As I was leaving the store cookie-less, I realized they had other other cookies. I ordered the cookie because I wanted it, not because it was $1.25. I went back and pulled out my credit card (because I didn't care how much the other one cost $2.00 for the ""manifesto cookies""). I made sure she saw the credit card and told her that ""I wanted a cookie, I'll pay for it separately"". She said which one, I told her I didn't care. I understand that GH takes a percentage of the cost and which is why they sometimes snub customers who use it. But it's easy and it's there. If you're going to use GH to promote your business, than be faithful to the platform and deliver well. That extra $.75 cost between the cookie I order and the cookie they had was more important to them than offering a good experience regardless of where it was from. I promptly called up GH and asked for a refund of the tip I gave them (not the entire amount, I'm not a jerk) because they did not deserve it at all. The worst part about it was that the food wasn't even that good...such a shame. I hope that extra $.75 was worth it, because I'm never eating here again.

From the cute blue pig character, to the modern french look to the restaurant, this place definitely looks appealing and a fun hang out. However, what brought down my rating for this place is the service and food. Sadly, upon siting and waiting, I got to see every table that came in after me order their food first and get served before someone came to take my order. The waiters seemed disorganized and the kitchen was slow. Now, I'm not someone who expect customer service or hasty food, but if you're going to make me wait and have terrible service, the food better make up for it. Well, it didn't. Tried several dishes and let's just say that nothing seemed fresh. The fries were stale and cold when served, any dish with biscuits just avoid completely because they are hard as a rock that my fork can't even break in, and the salad served on some of the dishes was so bad because the greens were almost brown. Now, one of their most popular dish is the burger with Mac n cheese. I would hope that the most popular dish is at least well made and it was the least disappointing dish. The burger has a bacon jelly and although it's interesting, it didn't taste like bacon, more like a sloppy joe mix. Now I was really excited about the mac n cheese but boy did that disappoint my burger. The mac n cheese did not stick together and fell apart as I ate, it had barely any taste to it, and hello....where was the cheese on the mac n cheese? Now I could go on about how there were only two ketchup bottles at the restaurant and how the two bottles available were empty or I could talk about the limited items on the menu and how it is over priced, but I think I've ranted enough. I feel like this place has the look but some changes need to be made with the staff and possibly the menu. The least the place can do is make their food fresh and of higher quality. Unless some changes are made, I don't think I'm coming back:/ sucks cause I love bacon (btw there weren't many items available with bacon).",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,2,1,3,_le9E1TyUUFPiCehCWCasA

Service when we first came in was very weird. Nobody quite seemed to know who should come seat us. Then they assumed the couple standing several feet behind us were part of our group. Again, just awkward.

And that awkwardness continued through the entire lunch. This is by far the most awkward restaurant I've eaten at. The food was alright, nothing to get excited about or not eat.

However, it just came out at random intervals. My wife's meal came up first, then the starter, and then a solid 20 minutes later after I ask for my sandwich they realize they gave it to the table across from us.

He never got what he wanted, told them to just cancel it. I felt bad for him. He wasn't happy with my sandwich. If it was constructed like mine, though, I understand it.

Sinful Tots were good, but for $7.50 I want something mroe than bacon crumbled in bbq sauce, over what looked to be run of the mill frozen Ore-Ida tots. Sandwich was alright, too, except the construction was pretty... awkward. Big glob in the center of the bread, nothing on the outsides.

And my salad just had no dressing. My wife's did, so that's something. I also didn't get any sort of acknowledgement of, ""Hey, sorry you got to watch someone eat their lunch while you sat with an empty space in front of you and not once did your server come over in that 20 minute period of time to ask"". That would have been cool. I also would have been less thirsty.

Way overpriced for what you get. Nothing close to worth it when you compare other restaurants at the same price point, both in terms of service and food.

And the best part: Watching them clean the tables. Something that looks like unused silverware on the table? Don't clean that, just rearrange the table! I guess it's important to save water, but... move it off the table if you're going to reuse it.",TBqZJ0AL1Bik65RjjzQYjQ,1,0,2,Fvnzlydy9u0mNPsxX4L_nQ

Four of us have been dying to try this place based on the drool worthy menu items and prime location for a breakfast/brunch location. We decided a Sunday brunch date was in order. 

We arrived at 11am to a moderately busy restaurants with at least 4 open tables, however waited approximately 10 minutes to be seated and curiously wondered why others continued to wait to be seated with open spaces available. 

Service was okay, each person at our table had to ask multiple times for drink refills after waiting at least 10-15 minutes for the initial drinks to arrive. 

We placed our orders and danced in delight when we received a mountain of banana French toast, biscuits and gravy, a massive burger dripping with yummy mac and cheese and the breakfast mac.

We savored every bite and all agreed with delight that we had finally found a great breakfast spot, and agreed we would all be back... 

We asked for our check and boxed our leftovers as we waited to sign the check and split the difference between cash and card. We were then approached by a member of the staff other than our server, who asking if we were finished, We agreed that we were just signing the check to a response of ""Great, can you all pack up and sit in our waiting area if you decide to stay, we need this table for another group"" Our rebuttal after the bit of shock was ""Yes as we just told you, we are signing the check"" a bit confused as the three additional tables now accompanied the vacant tables around us that had yet to be filled with other guests. We were reminded once more that ""We needed to make room for more people patiently waiting... so can you sit in the waiting area""

This would all make sense had we over stayed our welcome, demanded more drinks or refills far past the signing of the check.. or if there was a line or no open seats available. (I've been a server, I am a patient and understanding diner, turn and burn to make a profit) but never have I been asked to leave a place because we were in the way.

We asked to speak to the manager once our server approached the table to address the looks of shock and disgust on our faces, only to find out that the manager and owner was also the same person who asked us to leave.

The waitress was taking the large tables order, she went from that table to 2 more tables, took their orders then came to us and asked us for our drink order, she then went to another table and took their drink order.

I'm an avid Food Network/Cooking Channel viewer, so I have seen Truffles n Bacon on tv, but here's the thing: I think bacon jam is gross. I don't love bacon to begin with, so when you make it sweet, you've totally lost me. Not a popular opinion, I know. 

Nevertheless, a friend really wanted to check out the cafe, so I agreed.

The decor is perfect. It reminds me of a sweet, southern cafe where you could actually spend hours sipping tea and eating biscuits.

As for the food, I opted for The Godfather Mac and cheese. I was very pleasantly surprised! The Mac was perfectly creamy, and the bacon added a little pop. I wish I tasted more of the buffalo and jalapeño, but those are my only complaints. Let's be honest, though, they can omit the salad that's just helping you pretend that you're not completely indulging.

As for the service, our waitress was pleasant enough, but she seemed a bit forgetful. The food took longer than expected, so I wouldn't go for a quick lunch, which was fine with us. 

We did go to pay and asked to split the bill. That was not a particularly well received request. They asked that next time, we let them know up front. Fair enough.

Honestly, I don't think you should charge $2 to share a plate either.  Especially, if it's $6 or $7 & we wanted to share multiple items so when I do the math it didn't seem right.  Also because the competitors around you do not charge a sharing fee.

Herbed lemonade: I could have overlooked the ambiance but this is the reason for knocking one star off. ""Infused with basil, rosemary, mint and edible flowers""??? I call BS. It was straight normal iced lemonade. No hint of any herbs. Definitely not what some of the photos show of the herbed lemonade slush. I got a cup of iced NORMAL AVERAGE lemonade SANS herbs. Perhaps they were out of their herbed lemonade and thought I wouldn't notice if they gave me normal lemonade. I noticed. and I'm writing about it.

Not your mama's grilled cheese: DELISH! A hair on the sweet side, but still very yummy. the panini was perfectly grilled. It was SO GOOD. Definitely by far the best panini/sandwich I've had in a very very long while.

1500353,2016-02-21,2,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"Writing off a memory from a brunch we had the morning before Valentine's Day. I had chose it for exploration and the first early V-Day meal with the boyfriend. 
Walking in, I thought it had a really cool set up. Diner breakfast counter area, and there were some tables with with sofas as seats against the back wall. Art work was cool, and there was a nice seating waiting area. I was a bit confused 'cause we didn't know whether to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. We were honestly going to seat ourselves, but all the open tables we wanted weren't clean. A server came up a good minute later and seated us near the entrance where we didn't want to sit, but at least she was nice when she greeted us. 
Service was nice when we got it, but we rarely got checked on. 
Noticed a staff member that I thought was a busperson start cooking in the kitchen. Uh...? Okay. I can appreciate the helpfulness and cooperation of staff members, but I still find it a bit questionable. Maybe it was a shift change or there were staffing problems? The tables never did fully get caught up to all being cleaned the entire time we were there. 
Umm... We ordered mac and cheese balls, Heather's Choice for the boyfriend, and I had this fried chicken sandwich (ciabatta bread with avocado, bacon and some kinda bacon jam) for me. I really wanted to like my food, especially from such high reviews and the photos gave me high expectations. The mac and cheese balls were supposed to be our starter, but it came with our actual plates and there was a thin film over the cheese like it had been waiting on the counter to be served. The ciabatta bread didn't hold the bacon jam and avocado well at the bottom of the sandwich from the grease though, and the chicken in my sandwich looked like it was either overcooked or cooked in old oil, so I only ate half. The boyfriend liked his sandwich, but about 3 hours later he started feeling sick. Umm... Well that ruined plans to go out for an early romantic dinner with me. 
It doesn't look like we were the only ones satisfied with the establishment though. There was a specific woman in a tea hat and red velvet dress that clearly voiced her displeasure en route to exit: ""What a mess.""",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,2,2,sZoC6Q1KfGu4EpRZJJnnvA

The inside is smaller than I thought, but not too bad. I started with the herbal tea with lemonade...definitely not your typical Arnold Palmer. I liked that it was different but if you don't like herby flavors then I wouldn't try it.
I ordered the not your mamas grilled cheese and my boyfriend got the banana walnut French toast. OUR PLATES WERE COMPLETELY CLEAN AFTER. I ordered truffle fries with my sandwich, which was an extra $2.. I was kind of bummed to find out that the sandwiches and burgers only come with a side of greens.. not with fries. That was a negative thing for me, the greens were the only thing I did not touch. Truffle fries were okay but my sandwich was to die for. I will probably go back multiple times for that grilled cheese. It comes with brisket, kale, and their bacon jam. So messy to eat but oh so amazing. The banana walnut French toast was also delicious. I'm glad my boyfriend got it because I don't think I could eat that whole thing. I liked that it was made with plantains and not bananas. It definitely added a different flavor that I feel regular bananas would have ruined. Everything was so fresh and flavorful I couldn't keep left overs. We ate everything  (except the greens) and took a nap right after.

Many weeks have passed since my first visit.  I am haunted by memory of sin tots.  I am haunted by bacon jam.  I am haunted by the bacon jam on sin tots.  I am getting ahead on myself.

Walking in with the GF, I found a very laid back atmosphere and super friendly staff. Bacon jam..........

I ordered up the TNB Signature (indeed) burger consisting of get this....a mac n' cheese brick on a burger covered in MmMmmmmmmmm......bacon jam.  I never thought bacon could taste even better than bacon.  For a nominal fee, I ordered up sin tots. Bacon jam.

Deciding what to eat took a while but we decided on the 3x3x3, which had 3 big pieces of bacon, 3 eggs cooked however you want and 3 pieces of homemade French toast. We upgraded the toast to banana walnut, which was plantains cut up and walnuts in a delicious sauce to put on top of the French toast. Amazing! 
We also tried the Breakfast Mac bowl. That consisted of creamy/cheesy Mac and cheese, crispy hash browns/truffle oil, ham pieces and topped with an over easy egg. 
We at as much as possible and still had over half of beach entree leftover when we were done- Made for a great dinner later on! Pricing was also reasonable for portion sizes!",oUQf8DMMNUZSkV449G1hMw,0,0,4,z3zMQxNQZs7ljmrDPRv1Ug

They brought out a can and a glass of ice.  I guess there aren't any refills here.  I haven't seen that in a long time.  

We ordered the TNB Signature Burger to share.  Delicious!! Perfect burger topped with crispy Mac n Cheese and bacon jam.  What is bacon jam? I'm not really sure but it has a smoky, salty and sweet flavor all at once.  There is almost a carmelization that melds it together on top of the burger.  Amazing.  The sweet potato fries were the perfect side to compliment the burger.  

We also shared the Godfather Mac N Cheese - baked mac n cheese with buffalo chicken.  Another winner in my book.  What a great combination of flavors!  It was packed with chicken and would definitely order again.

Update: Went to their new location on Eastern and Pebble a few months back. Food was good but wow no silverware, no condiments, and we have our food!?

There are just a handful of places in the area that make an egg salad sandwich. Im bumping this place to top for go to egg salad for sure!  

What you'll love about this one is the egg salad is light, whipped, but creamy. It goes great with the smoked salmon.  It tasted really fresh. Oh so good! And with marbled rye bread, simply delicious. You like egg salad you're in for a nice treat!

This sandwich also came with salad greens plus your choice of sides fries, tots additional 50 cents .. for additional 2.50 I got a little side of their Piggie Wedgie.. potato wedges topped with shredded slow roasted pork cotija cheese with a garlic crema. That was pretty good too, but ended up being too much food for me.  The sandwich alone is pretty filling. So keep that in mind. 

Nice to see Truffles n Bacon getting back in the groove.  Starting out was a little shaky there. Soft opening was rough starting out that first day in the kitchen especially when they were not able to test out equipment prior to that first day. Great to see it running more smoothly and they have addressed concerns  shared with other reviewers. 

They have increased the staff, which did great!  The young lady who was my server was nice, confident and knowledgeable about menu items. Other staff on floor was friendly and attentive also.

They have additional help in the kitchen as well.  This visit my order came out promptly.  Everything presented was made to order and hot.

For those who tried out Chef Jackie's TnB Burger when TnB was over at Antiques Market,  you'll be happy to see it's permanently back on the menu! 

I get why now they called their place Truffles n Bacon. One reason why, it's that bacon jam! Chef Jackie's version is my favorite!  Perfect balance of savory and sweet! My wish would be to have more dishes incorporated with her bacon jam.  It deserves to be prominently featured.  Another reason, it just sets the tone of this place, fancy (Truffles) & comfort (Bacon). Chef Jackie is very talented and you will be in for a culinary treat! 

Their new place here on Pebble and Eastern where the Regal Collonade Theatre is pretty nice!  Huge dining area. Beautiful artwork graces their walls.  Look like they have more working space in the exposed kitchen as well. 

Only minor gripe..  the menus on printed paper that have grease spots and or food stains or are crinkled are a little turn off. It's laid out good and easy to read though! 

With the improvements they have made the past two months and the menu items offered, Im looking forward to more visits here. 

And someone mentioned in their review they have tea service? I didn't see any mention of it on their menu or on the daily special menu board, so I gotta check that out next time too! Tea time anyone?",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,9,12,4,kcS9pD-REh_bdgdhTobk8g

1781295,2015-06-10,5,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"With a name like this, Truffles N Bacon Café has been on my radar for a while- I can appreciate a good truffle-flavored dish, but I'm not a fan of bacon. Oddly, it's their diverse menu of sandwiches that really caught my eye. I went with friend Shirley B's recommendation of the Jessie, but the mushroom BLT and Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese both beg me to make another visit.

But I was underwhelmed by the SIMPLY JESSIE egg salad and smoked salmon on rye sounds both simple and delicious, but the salmon was minimal specks amid the salad, which barely held together and mostly ended up on the plate. I do like how they toasted one bread to help make the sandwich sturdier, but it didn't quite work. Added on a side of SINFUL TOTS for $2.50- nicely crispy bacon was the main topping, with a bit of cheese, a few pepperoncinis, and a slight essence of truffle oil detected on the fresh and crunchy tots. Good flavors, but slight missteps in execution.

It's a cute, sunny spot with warm wood floors, bright color accents, and an absolutely darling server- who I believe was the owner? Service was great: friendly, attentive, exceedingly polite.

I wanted to order food for delivery since it's my cleaning day at home! Sigh. The delivery reviews were outstanding as well. 
Ok, so...I ordered
1. Godsons mac and cheese   $8
2. Banana walnut French toast   $12

Total 29.84 (I ordered trough grub hub, delivery fee, taxes and tip, made it almost $30.) 

Food quality- The mac and cheese was just that, mac and cheese. Elbows with multiple cheeses, stringy. It was ok, just ok. Seemed more like a side dish to something. But it was fine. The French toast was 5 slices of bread with walnut, banana ""sauce"" I guess on the side. So overly sweet. Lots of walnuts tho, I used some butter at my house and put a tiny bit of the sauce on top. Not horrible. But nothing I would ever order again, on either entree I ordered. 

Delivery- I think this just topped off everything. I guess BiteSquad was the service they go through. Came in an appropriate time, the delivery person basically gave me the bag, said ""sorry I spilled some"" and walked away. I tried to stop him and said, oh ok, is this everything? And he said yea, and left. I didn't receive a receipt, there was cheese sauce all over everything. It was just disappointing. 

Final points - I really, really wanted this to be good. That's why I gave it 2 stars, plus the fact that the delivery service was horrible, didn't help the rating. I see some potential, maybe I just ordered the wrong things. The food was edible. Hopefully this is helpful to a single person, willing to try something new even though it's expensive. I work hard for my money, and this experience was annoying. I will try the restaurant in person. Maybe it will be different.",l2UalxwqxtZo4x90-omwVA,0,0,2,cicTJrHkQrcklQTo0B-b7A

He then seated us next. At which point we sat without anyone greeting us for minimum ten minutes. Grabbed a menu on my own. They realized we were waiting and assigned a waitress from another section. We ordered immediately.

So my boyfriend and I decided to take my friends out to lunch for Valentine's Day.... not realizing it was Valentine's Day. Lol

They never been here before and was super excited after how much we raved about this place. I decided to try something else other than their breakfast Mac on got their house special hamburger with the bacon jam and Mac and cheese inside... let me tell you that it was A M A Z I N G. Like delicious. My friends loved the food and decided they were going to bring their family over sometime later that week. The people there are always friendly and it makes me happy that they recognize my family everytime we come in. 

A must try restaurant in Las Vegas... hands down. 

-------------------------
So my boyfriend use to order take out for me here all the time. But today I finally went in to check it out with my sister in law and nephew. The atmosphere here is so cute and relaxed, definitely somewhere you can hang out by yourself or go with someone on a date. Their choice of old school RnB playing got me singing along too.

I would have rated this place a 5 star but no one is perfect. 

I ordered the breakfast Mac and cheese which is something I ALWAYS get alongside BACON JAM. It's a stoners paradise, although I don't smoke. But it does remind me of something someone who smoked marijuana would make, lol. Overall the richness of the Mac and cheese is just AMAZING and when you add the bacon jam it just takes it to another level.

The downside of my review would be that my sister ordered a burger and it came out dry. This is because our server did not ask how we wanted it cooked. When she got it, the burger was just really dry... She drank 3 cups of water to finish half of the burger. Overall, she said everything else she ordered was delicious, but that burger would not be something she would order again. On another note, the server also did not know how to split by tender.. It was just confusing and I had to walk him through the error he made. Regardless we still tipped him well because he was so kind and friendly. 

This is my favorite cafe. I would probably be here everyday if it was not a 35 minute drive away from my house.",CrInIRBSZA7HERD_ZzZSdw,2,1,5,w82YLXdkBz5vO8pPoOPoIQ

Finally an opportunity presented itself to eat here when a friend and I got together for brunch and she told me to pick the spot. They were pretty busy on a late Sunday morning. It's very small inside. The front waiting area is also the checkout area so things can and did get very crowded very quickly. We waited about 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged and then another little bit to be seated. The service can be summed up as friendly but slow. 

The menu is interesting. They have a some standard breakfast/lunch items, but a bunch of unique items I've not seen before including what I ordered - ube French toast. This is not on the actual menu, but on their ""not so secret menu"" which you can find on IG. I got eggs with toast for the kiddo and a side of bacon jam. Citrus iced tea to drink. My friend ordered the belly burger and a side of sweet potato fries. The food took a while to come out, probably at least 30 minutes, and they had forgotten the fries. They brought them out shortly after, though by that time my friend was already full. 

I enjoyed the fresh toast. It wasn't as sweet as it looks and as I thought it would be. I didn't really taste too much ube flavor though despite the purple colored cream cheese and gob of purple ube? on top. I'm just not exactly sure what it was. The star of the meal for me was the bacon jam. It was freaking delicious. I still am thinking about it hours later. They even have it for sale! I should have bought some but I'm glad I didn't because it wouldn't have made it home. 

My friend really enjoyed her burger and it looked delicious. It had pork belly, spicy mayo, pickled veggies and an onion ring. I need to order that next time. Yes there will be a next time.

First located them on Ginormous Dishes (I think it's called) on Food Network. Decided to go give it a whirl during one of my diet break meals. I went with the chicken and waffles for the entree and bread pudding French Toast for dessert. 

The chicken and waffles is really as good as it gets. The waffle was fluffy and flavorful. The chicken is just perfect with a great batter. They have a honey sriracha sauce for the chicken and I went with the bacon jam and maple syrup for the waffle. You won't find this dish done much better. Kudos to them. 

The dessert was incredibly sweet but it was equally tasty. Highly recommend you try it out. 

The server (Dino) is really what makes this place a true gem for me. He's the most kind, caring server you'll ever have. Incredibly personable with a ton of personality. My experience wouldn't have been the same without him. 

Now for the missing star: I've been to T&B twice now. The first time I went, although Dino was awesome, the restaurant was understaffed. The service was unbelievably slow. I waited about 30 minutes from the time I put my dessert order in until it got to my table. And this was on a weekday morning. A man and his daughter literally walked out after waiting for their meal for over 30 minutes. Even I felt bad seeing that. 

During my second visit I took my parents who were visiting Vegas from Philly. The wait times were much better so I feel comfortable saying that my first visit wait time was an anomaly. 

I'll definitely be back.  Give it a shot!",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,1,0,4,pwvWmSBJsjjMW-43qR76Cg

Go inside and there were two other tables with diners sat.  Wasn't sure if we were to wait to be seated or to seat ourselves, so we waited in the front for a moment until a lady came out and let us know we could sit wherever; she'd bring over menus.

Waitress was very friendly and let us know of the specials today - one being loco moco.  It had been quite awhile since I'd had some, and it sounded pretty darn good.  I opted for extra egg instead of fried spam and got the gravy on the side.  The gravy.  Was.  So.  Good.  I felt like that's exactly what loco moco gravy is - thick, with just a tang - and it went perfectly with the hamburger steak.  The rice, however, was a pretty drastic clash as it had a lime flavor and  some of it wasn't fully cooked.

Tried some of my fiance's bacon and it was thick with an amazing richness to it that I'd never had in bacon.

With tip our meal was $40, so I felt is was a touch steep for loco moco & a waffle with eggs, toast & bacon.  Wouldn't mind coming back here to try some lunch options (yeah, I know, I didn't get the soup & sandwich).",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,0,2,3,9SU8V4qET9VsDU6S2tdPjQ

A few in our group had half empty or empty Starbucks cups that our waitress ""offered"" to throw away so she didn't have to charge us the outside food or drinks fee. Mind you most of our group was ordering more than just water.  The water cups were very small and I requested lemon but got a thin cut garnish slice instead of a squeezable lemon. I ordered the hulk and the truffle tots. The sandwich was nothing short of a let down. It tasted like chicken and bell peppers. Although once I added some ranch it was a little better. Another person in our group ordered the same and had the exact same complaint. We also ordered the buffalo mac and cheese to share. This was a major let down. The macaroni was good but the chicken was missing that buffalo spice. It just tasted like katsu chicken in home made mac n cheese. I honestly would have gave the place two stars but the truffle tots saved the day. They were seriously amazing. Some at our table got truffle fries and they were equally as good.

The tea is refreshing, with a real slice of orange and a few sprigs of mint, right up my ally. The tots were crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Plentiful melted cheese, and crispy bacon, and the Chipotle mayo and truffle oil were just enough to give ample flavor without being overbearing or making the tots soggy. The pepperchinis on top added a tangyness that went well with the savoriness of the bacon.

The bacon jam the sweetness and bacon combine it with creamy cheesy mac and cheese. Nirvana. Seriously. The perfectly cooked burger. Protein overload. It does come with side salad just in case wondering where the vegetables. I added side of sweet potatoes. They were good. 

The menu had real nice diversity from breakfast items, lunch items, and little something of everything. I love the decor. It DEFINITELY has personality all it own.

When she came back with the milk she asked if we would like a coffee refill since she brought the coffee back with her.

We did not ask them to remake our food because we were hungry, and it took a while to get to us. Not sure why it took so long to get the food but it did. I'm guessing that maybe they were short staffed or maybe just not organized in the kitchen.

As indicated, the food taste good but was not hot. The coffee should be brought around more often without having the customer ask, oh and if juice or milk is ordered make sure to bring it with the food.


The fans were good but they were not installed correctly, I talked with the owner/manager, and did not give the staff the ability to adjust. It was either off or it was on, and only on high. We had to make sure the napkins had something on top of them to keep them from flying away.

Would we come back? Yes we will come back to try it again. Hopefully when we do come back all of the things I had listed would be resolved. The only item that will limit how often we come back is the prices. They are a bit high for how much you get IMHO.

Again, the food had great flavor but it was cold. Service was pretty good, but that could improve as well.

We will be back.",qYmjkHGQnpdLimN2I9cI6g,0,0,3,31olONDhV4Zlwm6lKbSv5Q

So I placed an order that totaled $67.55 after tax, tip, and promo code which removed $5.99 delivery fee. That was this morning for breakfast. TONIGHT I find myself getting an email from grub hub saying the menu price of the kids pancakes was slightly lower (fifty nine cents) than it should have been so apparently the cafe was asking for my bill to be adjusted? I might possibly be understanding of something like this, after all we ordered two of those kids pancakes platters so the adjustment should have only been an additional $1.28. MIND YOU I HAVE A SCREEN SHOT WHICH TELLS ME MY TOTAL SHOULD BE $67.55. THE NEW TOTAL GRUB HUB IS ASKING FOR IS $74.81! What happened to only needing to add $1.28? THIS IS THEFT! I inquired, OBVIOUSLY, and grub hub responded that the total reflects the additional $1.28 PLUS the $5.99 promo code. WHY DO WE NOT GET THE PROMO CODE ANY LONGER? This is completely illegal and we will no longer be using grub hub NOR WILL WE EVER RETURN TO THIS CAFE.

Good news everything has something bacon in it, according to the server that is. I haven't really looked at the menu to verify it but I'll believe her for now.

I was told that I should try the Double Vision cause it was a jalapeño bacon burger between a grilled cheese sandwich. How do I say no? Intrigued I ordered it and even threw in some tots. It was nice sized I probably could've forced myself to eat it all but only consumed about half of it, I was slacking. It was yummy just wished there was a more cheese along the edges of the grilled cheese but all good. Was it a healthy meal? I don't know about that one. I mean it did have a salad. The tots were tasty, I want to try them as how I see them in other pic with sauce.

Some friends I was with had the TNB Signature Burger.  A burger with mac n cheese and bacon inside a bun. The idea wasn't new to me so I didn't want to order it at the time. After the orders came out I was like ""damn I want that too"". Yea I kind of screwed myself over even failed to realize one key detail about the burger, the bacon jam. I sampled the bacon jam it was delicious. I for sure will be going back for this burger soon.

The rest of the menu sounds tasty. The place looks like it could fit a lot of people though it was empty when I went, it was a weird time between lunch and dinner I don't know.  The service was very good, very friendly and not slow then again we were the only people there. Supposedly the chef is from some show on tv or something I don't know.

Along with their special tater tots that had some great sauce and more of the special bacon, it was a delicious and filling meal.  Although at $14.50 + $2.50 for the tots...was it a $17 hamburger plate...not really (reference Bachi Burger if you actually want to spend that much on a hamburger for lunch).

My girlfriend had the ""3x3x3"", which consisted of 3 bacon, 3 French toast and 3 Eggs.  While that sounds about as generic as could be, it was very good.  The bacon pieces were super-thick and well done to a crunch (perfect), while the French toast was on French bread slices and well seasoned.  Scrambled eggs were 100% unremarkable and standard.

In short, I'm not sure if it will replace breakfast favorite Weiss Deli, or even Sunrise Café, for that matter, but we'll be back to try a few more menu options in the future.

Location:
I'm not a local so I have no clue where this place was, lol. Wherever my navigation told me to go, I just kind of followed. I know I still had to get back on the freeway to get back on the strip. It was close to South Point. When you do get to the area, you will find this place in a strip mall. There was tons of parking. I loved that! Just look for a giant black bus with a blue pig monkey looking logo slapped on their catering truck. They park their catering truck right out front so you can't miss them.

Service:
Fantastic! I love it when waiters/waitresses actually talk to you to get a feel for you. They can make better recommendations that way. I was pretty tired from the drive from Los Angeles so our waitress didn't hesitate getting us our drinks. It took a bit of time to get our check though, but I didn't know you were suppose to pay up front. So for everyone else, PAY UP FRONT or you'll just be sitting there like a lost kid. 

Food:
My wife was very adamant about trying their secret menu Ube French Toast. Of course that means, we haddd to go. (Damn you instagram!) However, this was a good thing. I was pleasantly surprised by how much ube and cream there was. The french toast was perfect. Plus they give you a lot! Couldn't finish it, so we definitely had to pack this up. This Ube French Toast held me over all weekend as I drunkenly munched on it as the night progressed. I, on the other hand, had this burger with bacon jam. Bacon jam!? Wah!? A bit salty, a bit sweet, this worked well with my burger, especially with the small little bits of bacon. The only thing that didn't work well with my burger was the salad. It was a good salad, but I felt as if the dish mocked me for being a fat a** for grubbing on this burger and shoestring fries. I covered the salad with a napkin and the world was ok again. I washed it all down with some orange juice (tasted like minute made), but I can't really complain about that.

Final Thoughts:
The Ube French Toast (which is off the menu) is worth giving this place a try. Yes, I'd come back here again. Yes, I'd order the same thing again. Yes, their logo is a pig monkey. 5 Stars!",GMA1uPQwTXboNsbuWj5_pg,1,2,5,wFPrAJXSxVl2RPXZKb_1Ww

2603354,2017-07-07,1,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"I'm sad to say I was extremely disappointed with my entire experience. I've been wanting to try T&B for about 6 months now (after seeing it on Yelp and word-of-mouth). It's not close to home so we purposely made the trek to try it out. The food was average... but the service was terrible! 

I wanted so bad to have a delicious brunch meal...but it was all just underwhelming. 

We ordered the spam fries to start (fiancé is a spam freak). They were tasteless...mostly just oil and fried. No flavor. The dipping sauce it comes with was good though. 

We split a few other items. The main meal was the Bangers and Hash. Bangers were the best part. Good flavor. The Hash consisted of diced and shredded potatoes. Good, but nothing special. We also ordered biscuits and gravy....crazy disappointed. The biscuits were frozen or old as hell. They were rock hard on the bottom and then so dry they were disintegrating into the gravy. Yuck! We also ordered a side of bacon jam... not bad, but we didn't understand the hype. It was basically bacon in oil? Might be a personal preference..?

The worst part was the service. Our waitress, Marilyn(?), didn't know the menu when we asked questions. After ordering she didn't take the large menus off a small table, followed by not clearing dirty plates, she never (not once) came by to check on us, & the kicker...we sat for nearly 15 minutes with dirty dishes stacked in front of us and empty glasses before walking to the front hoping to get the check. During the time we were sitting there we had another server (not ours) walk by and one gentleman from the back who made direct eye contact with me and then looked down at our stacked dishes...to then just turn back around and walk away. Once we were standing at the front to get our check the 'other' server didn't acknowledge us & proceeded to take a to-go order. She then came back up front to help us a couple minutes later. We told her we didn't have the check yet and proceeded to tell me our total, without showing us the check. I think she caught on to my shock and turned the iPad around to show me the total and to check things out. She was nice enough, but my annoyance was with the whole experience at that point. Finally, as we were paying, who we think is the owner the owner pulled up out front and our original waitress walked right past us, looking directly at me, and didn't say a word - no apology for the wait, thank you for coming, nothing. She walked out front and started unloading the car. Dumbfounded. 

Definitely not worth the $35 or the hour of time spent. There are too many brunch spots to choose from to have service so terrible and food so mediocre. 

Please note we dined at approx 11:30a on a Thursday. There were approx 7 other tables with 2 servers. I really don't like to leave bad reviews.... but it was just that disappointing. ""/",5sLcx-Os2KF6AMrp53j6tA,1,1,2,3g8rJcqfmoqoZUxsmpEpNw

Why close at 2 on what would ideally be the busiest day? They were out of the first three things I wanted to order which I had decided on by looking up their menu ahead of time.  So that was disappointing, they forgot the bacon in the bacon waffles my friend ordered (they are bacon waffles how do you forget the bacon?) they did give us a discount for the inconvenience so I appreciate that. The totts were delicious with the flaming hot Cheetos on them and the pork belly omelet was also good. I got the breakfast Mac and it left something to be desired. Maybe I was just disappointed because it wasn't what I came in for. Plus when it came time to split the check it was like I asked him in Chinese. Split it four ways that's all I asked and that process took 10 minuets at least when I was already ready to go. I think it's a relatively new restaurant so maybe they are still working out the kinks!

The floor is stained cement.  I must say that I absolutely love how clean this cafe is, and I especially love the open kitchen.  This shows they have nothing to hide.  There are no heating lamps, no microwave!

FOOD: Who doesn't like bacon?  The name of this cafe is what attracted me here in the first place!  The vanilla latte was the BEST I have ever had... and I am a complete latte snob.  The server took a while to make my latte and it was not rushed like someone at Starbucks.  I almost contemplated ordering one to go too- it was that delicious!  I ordered the buttermilk waffles with maple bacon syrup.  The waffles were fluffy and delightful and the syrup was tasty.  Hubby ordered the country scramble which was absolutely perfect in every way.

SERVICE: Marilyn was our server and she was very accommodating and nice.  We wanted a little sample of the bacon jam to try and she brought it to us warmed up on top of small pieces of toasted bread... how nice was that?!?!?  Anyway, we ended up buying THREE of the large servings of ""Crack"" in a jar!  It was sooooo delicious.

REQUEST: The only request I have is when being seated, perhaps consider mentioning the special or ask if we want to hear the special.  The specials for the day are posted upon walking in; however, we didn't see it until we walked out.  We would have probably ordered the special although we have no regrets ordering what we did because it was so amazingly delicious!

It's a little bigger than some of these other popular breakfast spots. There's a warm inviting feeling when you walk in and we only had to wait for a few minutes to get seated. The waitress was very friendly and helped us through the menu giving us suggestions and telling us house specialities and guests favorites. 

We went with the poplular spicy grilled cheese called ""heathers choice."" Truly one of kind with a bacon jam and gooey cheese and jalapeños and onions. Sweet and savory and an extra kick. If your a fan of grilled cheese this is perfect for you. Gave it a 5/5.

Had a waffle and added bacon. Nothing spectacular or different but prepared very well.

Also had the truffle tater tots... holy cow those were phenomenal. 5/5

Had to also get the mac and cheese. Ooey gooey goodness full of flavor and love. 5/5

Oh, before I start telling you all about how wonderful a spot this is, and believe me it totally is, let me warn you that they are CLOSED on TUESDAYS!  I know there is at least one photo in the gallery that says that they are open every day. Anyway. . . where was I?

This spot is awesome.  It is family owned and run.  Their servers are awesome and you'd be in great hands if you were helped by Raphael.  He made some great suggestions and was so helpful.  He gave us the opportunity to try a small sample of their bacon jam. OMG! I like bacon in general but I'm not the type to jump out of my pants over it.  In this particular case, I've just had a food-gasm and it was all in my mouth, down my throat and into my now happy tummy!! omg!!! I THINK that's what heaven must taste like. Seriously! Like I said, I like bacon in general but I'm not gaga for it.  This stuff, however, is gold!  I ordered a burger with bacon jam on it. I had to. After placing our order that is when we saw that Food Beast was at the restaurant too.  They are a friendly bunch of folks. I'm so glad that this spot is getting their kudos. They have some great products here. 

My husband and I ordered the ube French toast, which I did not see on the menu but also just knew to ask for because by word of mouth, we were told it was AMAZING. I really enjoyed it. I think one more slice of French toast would have made it just that much better but only because there is so much cream cheese that's on it.  The little bit of macapuno and ube on top, I craved a tiny bit more of. Nothing was overpoweringly sweet like I worried it might be just because of its appearance. The flavors were so good and well balanced. There was the right amount of softt to crispy and sweet to savory. I'd definitely order the French toast again. 

The burger. . .The flavors were really good. For me, it was a bit too much bread for me but I think it's because I don't use artisan breads too often for my burgers that I make at home. The bread was delicious, don't get me wrong.  it was just too much for me, especially after we'd devoured the French toast. The Mac and cheese was tasty but I thought that there would have been a slight bit more of a cheese pull when I cut into the burger. The chuck was good but I thought it could have been a tad more tender. All the flavors, juices and spices were all there. It was covered in bacon jam. YESSSS!! YIPPPPPPPEEEEEEEE!! Seriously, the bacon jam was giving me LIFE that day!  

While we wanted to try a lot more, we didn't have any more room. It gives us a good reason to go back.  Hopefully Raphael will be able to take care of us again. I couldn't leave without buying some bacon jam to take home.  Warning, if you are flying, make sure you package your bacon jam very well.  It's wrapped in paper but as it warms, oil seeps from the jar.  I was lucky that I had another ziplock bag in my luggage that I could use to catch the seeping oil.  Otherwise, my poor purse would have become a pricey dog magnet. Talk about ""All the bitches love me!""  Oh no no! That bacon jam is so delicious. I've had a tiny bit with some eggs, with a nice rib eye and even on top of a turkey burger. You can't go wrong. And why torture yourself, splurge and get the 8oz jar!  You won't regret it. I know I love it.  

Having to leave this place was difficult. Raphael even shared with us some of their Belly of the Beast burger. it was HUGE! Yes, that's what (she) I said!  It was 10.5 lbs of beef patty with things like tater tots, hot cheetos, jalapeños, etc on it.  It had been cut up to share and to also be photographed for Food Beast to create their piece on their restaurant, but even after 6-8 people dove into it, it still could NOT be conquered. Crazy!  

Service was great. I blame Raphael for my new bacon jam obsession. I hope the restaurant is able to get their stickers out. I know my water bottle is dying for one. Leaving was as painful as break up, knowing I'd never find the same back home. Ugghhh!! 

I'd suggest coming here with a few friends and splitting things to be able to try more. I wish we had that chance but maybe next time. Believe me, we'll definitely be back!",GHYUiM3elmIbwpwrIqR_ew,2,0,5,l7FsvmWn0Ag4IeTLc1zCUg

Truffles N Bacon Cafe turned out to be a fabulously fantastic find because my 'breakfast' extended itself into a brunch instead!  The grilled cheese sandwich could be cheesier for some, but for me, it was the perfect balance of just right gooeyness and bacon-jam filling two, thick-sliced toasted, um, toast (haha)... I ate all of my vinaigrette side salad to kind of make up for ordering both the tater tots AND sweet potato fries which were oh-so crispy but not greasy.  I ordered their famous french toast bread pudding to go, but after I got home (15 minutes later), my stomach decided that it wasn't so full after all, and that bread pudding needed to be immediately consumed before lunch.  I topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream from my freezer, and it was the BEST dessert I've ever had for 'breakfast'!  I wouldn't be surprised if everything else on their menu tasted as good so I'll definitely be back for lunch!

The hostess and help really seem to attend to their customers, and there's also a cozy, relaxing ambiance to the place.  I went early in the morning on a weekday so there wasn't a lot of people, but this cafe's high quality and service deserves to attract more attention.  Its location is a little difficult to see if you aren't looking for it in the corner area across from the movie theater and Havana Cuba restaurant in that huge Eastern/Pebble plaza.

Noticing that Truffles N' Bacon had relocated a short distance away from my house. I was very excited to dive into some brunch goodness. Sadly this did not happen, but what did happen was a mac n' cheese covered burger with bacon jam.  Not too shabby. 

My experience here wasn't the best. The menu was pretty bare and only had lunch items available, if you wanted breakfast you had to ask the server, who then had to ask the owner, who then had to come over an try to recollect the breakfast menu from memory. Hence why I went with TNB burger, which by the way, also isn't on the menu. I was on their old Yelp profile page and pointed to a picture and said... ""That one""

This TNB was pretty good. The burger was cooked perfect, the mac n' cheese was in abundance, the bun was super soft, but I wanted more bacon jam. What's the point of adding it to a burger in small amounts. Make it rain bacon jam!

Sinful Tots. Bacon Jam, truffle oil, and carbs, what's not to love? Maybe the fact that only a quarter of the tots were covered. Still, I loved and devoured these salty treats. 

I'm assuming Truffles N Bacon is going through a new set of going pains. Hopefully the pain will subside and the new location will be just as good as the last one.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,10,8,3,R_920Ffthy2rFC3lg9Q2gA

3017122,2017-05-22,2,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"We went to TNBC for Mother's Day because my wife really wanted to try some place new, and this was on our list of places that we'd seen but hadn't been to.  Plus, bacon??  Sold.  

Now, maybe it was because of Mother's Day, or maybe it's always this way (I was able to read several poor service reviews for TNBC on Yelp while we were there...), but the wait to be seated was tumultuous.  The oddity is there were obviously clean and ready tables available from the minute we walked in, but we (or the two couples ahead of us) weren't seated until much later.  Perhaps they were short on staff, it was hard to tell, there appeared to be a  number of bustling staff members wandering aimlessly around and chatting with various diners. There was this man at the front counter, thin with grey hair - he really didn't seem to know or care what he was doing. He would check the sign in roster randomly, yet only acted on it once every three or four returns. It took about 10-15 minutes each for the two couples ahead of us to be seated - at tables that had almost immediately been vacated by previous diners. Finally it was OUR TURN. *Time passes...* Ultimately, after watching grey hair guy look at our name on the list at least 4 times, and us longingly looking at empty tables for about 30 minutes, we were happily seated at a table that had yet to be cleared/cleaned.  Our waitress greeted us, brought us water, and disappeared.  About 20 minutes later, another host asked if we'd had our order taken, and we said no.  I was still watching that grey haired man wander around - picking up menus, leaving them at tables, picking them up and putting them on the table next to the waiting area, talking to staff, wandering around... wandering...  wtf is he there to do?  Some couples came in after us, and were immediately seated, while some more were made to wait, even though there were open tables.  Then, one of those couples received their food...  WHAT!? Our waitress wandered by and asked if someone had taken our order.  ...  We said yes.  She looked relieved and apologized for the wait and disappeared again, forevever.  It was a giant cluster.  We finally received out food after grabbing the hostess that took our order and asking what was going on with it.  Checking out, their machine was down, so I waited for an extra 10 minutes - TO PAY - while a new hostess I'd not seen before was trying to reboot their ipad based register.

The service at TNBC was like watching a pile of ants try to recover after some devil person has scraped away the top of the pile (or detonated an M80 on it).  Some things get done. Some don't. Some people are seated, some aren't for a long while.  

The ONLY saving grace was the actual food. I can abide horrible service if the food is good - and it was/is/should be (I hope), since I'm not giving a one star review. Diner beware, if you have a couple hours to blow and can use the disarray as entertainment, then you'll have yourself a delicious meal (the leftovers were great a day later).  If you get peeved by terrible customer service, avoid.

TLDR - food is good - service is like stepping into the twilight zone.",nS66_0T1PcmYe0RSgM-ZTQ,1,0,3,YLJiwsxUdAxVn0vQHbEASw

3024619,2017-07-23,0,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"This review is only for the afternoon tea service. 

I have been on a quest to find places in Las Vegas that serves afternoon tea/high tea. Most of the places I have tried have always been at The Strip. This is the first place I've tried that was ""off the strip"" so it doesn't come with the price. At $22/person + tax, the afternoon tea here was such a good deal! 

RESERVATION: One of the things you must remember is to make reservation ahead of time. When I made my reservation, they asked for my credit/debit card information. Also, be ready to provide the zip code associated with your card. I find a bit weird that they would ask for it. An explanation for why would have been... comforting in a way.  I do understand it's for cancellation purposes but most places just need the card number, security code and expiration date. 

TEAS: They offered several variety of teas that are in tea bags (Shangri La Tea). We tried the Chocolate Coconut and Earl Grey - both went well with the food that came along with it. I personally like the coconut tea. It has a slight hint of sweetness to it. 

FOOD: We were started off with a small plate of Buttermilk Chicken n Waffles (with honey Sriracha) with mini Godson's Mac. I personally love this because it gives you a taste of what Truffles n Bacon has to offer. I love their fried chicken and waffle! The mac and cheese was a delightful addition to the dish.

The tea service comes with the following small bites: 
-Assorted berry scones with apricot and raspberry jam and butter 
- Smoked Salmon on cucumber 
- Chicken Salad on toasted bread
- Tomato with chopped artichoke, cucumber and olives with yogurt filling

Everything was delicious and delicately prepared. For the price, it was a plenty of food and endless refill of hot water for tea. 

Overall, I would say this is my favorite place for tea service so far (I am still on a hunt!). I like that it's located away from the strip and I get free parking. I love the food and I mean, who's not obsessed with their bacon jam?! I will definitely come back here for more!",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,4,1,5,Kcz1XDUNQq06fXO0Otjesg

It has Macapuno (coconut) topping and a scoop of the Ube Jam (the best part of the meal). I wouldn't order it again. My bf thinks the French Toast was ordinary but the mac n' cheese was okay. His exact words were, ""It wasn't bad but it's not the best I've ever had."" We'll probably go back again and try the rest of the menu.

I ordered the TNB signature burger and it was only $4 more than  the than the eggs. I thought it was an error so at checkout I asked the gentleman at the cash register about it. (It seemed a bit extreme to charge that much money for a couple eggs and a side of spinach), he called the manager Magnolia over and she said nope when you order a la carte there is an extraordinary price markup because it is more challenging for the chefs to prepare. I would understand this if I was asking for a burger with Spam eggs mac and cheese and 45 other ingredients that are not normally prepared with a hamburger that are extensive to make this would be acceptable but come on if you're scrambling eggs that's pretty much the simplest thing you'll ever do in a restaurant.

Came here with my buddy and right when I walked in, I thought I was in the twilight zone. I couldn't really understand the theme/decor of this place. It's a diner concept, yet it looks like a boutique furniture store. The servers were a little cukoo and overly friendly (not in a good way), but hey the food was absolutely delicious. 

Sinful Tots- I'm usually not a fan of tater-tots, but these were really good. The combination of the cheese, bacon jam, and truffle oil on these tots were just orgasmic. 

Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese Sandwich- One of the better sandwiches I've had in awhile. The panini bread was toasted nicely (crispy but not overdone), and the brisket was really soft and flavorful. The bacon jam was the highlight in both of these dishes. Great combination of sweet and savory. 

Buttermilk fried chicken and waffles- the chicken and waffles were superior. My buddy ordered this, but I got to try some of it. The waffle was so crisp, and the fried chicken was hot and crunchy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. It had the breading of a katsu, and it was so good!

Will definitely have to come back and try some of their other items.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,9,8,4,l6ojjKCZCf1AwCStJEz2oA

We were immediately greeted and sat at one of the back corner table, draped with a nice table cover to give it the high tea time vibe.  For our tea selection, I got the jasmine green tea while hubby got chai.   They were bagged teas instead of loose leaves...so I wasn't too impress with that.  
We got two kinds of sandwich each, cucumber something, and two kinds of scones accompanied with butter, and 2 jams.  We also got a slider and a petite dessert that I was too full to consume at that point.  It cost $22/person.
Though it was lovely, hubby didn't care for tea time.

So a week after, we decided to go back and try other items on the menu.
I wanted the bacon jam and avocado on sourdough but unfortunately, they were out of avocado.  So, I went with the chicken and waffle.  I must say the chicken was quite moist and crispy.  I do like this, but it is something that I could only enjoy once every month or 2.  The fried chicken skins were good because there were chicken meat attached to some of the pieces, and the dipping sauce was a good accompaniment to the chicken skins.  Hubby ordered a patty melt and a side of pork belly.  He thought it tasted ok, but nothing special.

Want tuna on a grilled cheese? If that's your thing, by all means you are entitled to do that. However, you don't make a grilled cheese with tuna. You make a tuna melt. Want bacon on a cheeseburger? Ok, but it's not a cheeseburger anymore, but a bacon cheeseburger. The same idea applies here. Once they add brisket, kale, tomato, etc., it's no longer grilled cheese. Seriously, they had a chance to use alliteration in their naming process and could've called it ""Not Yo Mama's Melt"" - an infinitely better name for this sandwich.

Well, the staff got on the offensive when I pointed this out to them. They cited that there's a grilled cheese truck that adds additional ingredients as well. I promptly told them they were wrong about that, too. Also, I don't recognize grilled cheese trucks as the authority on this subject.

As for the sandwich itself, I felt it was slightly overpriced and not worth a second go. I actually enjoyed the fresh greens more. There was a sweetness coming through that I didn't enjoy. It may have been from the bacon jam.

The over-hyped ""locals"" destination proves far from extraordinary. With torn menus, outdated decor, and a terrible seating system, this location probably needs to be saved from their downward spiraling demise. 

Upon walking in, I am greeted from an older lady who clearly has no concept of wait times. She stands around looking for things to do when there is really much to be done to satisfy both awaiting and eating guests. 

Upon waiting for my party, I order the disco tots with meat on the side. Ticket times were approximately 18 min for what is reminiscent of a disaster in kitchen nightmares. Literally chips thrown in a bowl with some tots and drizzled with some sauce. Truffle oil? More like olive oil with reminiscence of fake truffle extract.  No mixing, no presentation. Just thrown in a bowl. I regret eating it as I write. 

To even order the appetizer, I had to wait 6 minutes for someone to approach my table. In fact, the server touched the other tables that sat down after my party did. When my appetizer came, I had to ask twice for a place setting because I wasn't given one. When you need refills of coffee or water, the server has to take the cups away from the table. A pitcher or dispenser system would probably help out the servers from making unnecessary trips. I'm still trying to understand why the servers were so discombobulated. They don't even handle the checks. I wonder if a team system would work better. There's 22 tables max if you separate two tops and three servers. I mean there's 4 chairs at the bar, but there's even a busser and an older lady who does the side work. I'm still trying to figure it out. 

I won't even get into my entree. It's not even worth my energy. But hey, at least I got free refills on my coffee.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,6,1,2,f1skofT4L716rk1xzFW2GA

It is generally a bit crowded and right when you walk in there isn't much space to stand and wait to be seated as the sign says, especially if multiple people walk in. There is also a jewelry display right when you walk in which is a bit odd. However we walked in and waited about 5 minutes to be seated, after being told to ""hold on"" by at least 3 different staff members before finally being seated. Now we are seated with menus and are taking our time to go through them as we haven't been here before. I kid you not when I say we were sitting at our table for at least 10-15 minutes without even a greeting from a waitress or anything. Mind you they were tending to all the tables surrounding us BUT ours. We had to flag someone down to get service and they did apologize for ""not noticing"" us but being as I am someone who works in a way busier and high volume restaurant 3x the size of this little breakfast place, I was highly unamused. Now as far as the menu goes there are plenty of great options that sounded good. My grandmother and I decided to split the chicken and waffles. Might I add that they do charge $2 to split a plate for you which is just annoying & i've never really seen that before but we still did it for the sake of convenience. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that they don't have soda on tap. They serve you cans with a glass of ice for $1.75 per can, also a rip off. Anyways food came out quick and was good I would say, but after that it was nearly impossible to get ahold of our server again. We had to call for her and ask for 2 glasses of water that were forgotten about, and she just left us there sitting for about another 15 min after we finished our small portions. We were literally looking around trying to figure out if we go to the front and pay or how it works since nobody was helping us. Finally we had to ask another person for a check. The check came and our server still failed to mention that you take your check up front and pay up there which is also very stupid and I'll explain why. What is the point of having us go up front to pay when there are only two cash registers and again no space to stand?! So there I am waiting even longer in a line of other people trying to pay and also a mix of people placing to go orders. All in all, this place is very unorganized, has extremely slow service, and the food isn't good enough to make me come back and deal with that again.

I was fed up after she went to the counter so I found a manager, told her what happened and that it was not her or the restaurant, but THAT horrible waitress.

Servers are always nice and attentive, but the food can take quite a while sometimes, even when they aren't busy. Worth the wait though. Trust me.

I usually either get the signature burger, which is absolutely bomb, or the 3x3x3 (a perfect french toast breakfast. The chicken & waffles are super good too. Extra points for the katsu style chicken w/ the honey sriracha sauce. Also, extra points for Lavazza coffee...Their caramel latte is really good.

The ""TNB Signature burger"" mac n' cheese burger is almost on-par with the Spotted Pig's charbroiled burger in NYC. It is rich, dense and filled with umami savoriness. Surprisingly the mac n' cheese does not overpower the burger and instead provides with a nice creamy background to keep the burger moist. Just like any hefty burger, the decadence stops half way through before becoming too much to handle.

The truffle bacon  ""sinful"" tater tots are a nice original tasty side with a bit of crunch and drizzling of truffle oil. It is not doused and the texture of the tater tots are maintained while still imparting it with truffle flavor. The ""piggie's wedgies"" pork fries are also unique though not quite as good as the tater tots. It lacks a punch in its flavor.

The best thing on offer here though is DEFINITELY their ""Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese"". By far one of the most balanced yet flavorful sandwiches you'll ever try. This isn't just good by Vegas standards, this sandwich can more than hold its own to the best that New York has to offer. The brisket is tender, seasoned well and pairs perfectly well with the sauteed kale and grilled tomatoes. FUCK it's that good.",XjyTxD6wAINeTsclXB6LeQ,3,1,5,sF5ByleeGwLvR0l_NEsQJg

We started with the Pimp My Toast appetizer which was a wonderful choice. Each piece of toast had its own arrangement of goodies and each was completely different. All were amazing but my favorite was the Avocado and Bacon Jam. I have also had the Breakfast Mac and the Chicken and Waffles. I am a sucker for chicken and waffles so I'd have to give it my vote but the Breakfast Mac was a yummy twist on traditional mac and cheese with bacon mushrooms, hashbrowns, and a bunch of other stuff thrown in. The chicken and waffles are served with this honey sriracha which makes them irresistible!

Items shared and devoured (over two visits):
Hand Rolled Mac N Cheese balls $8.  Delicious mounds of mac & cheese, deep fried with bacon, and topped with Peruvian Aji (green chili) sauce, and sitting in a shallow well of melted cheese goodness.  Make sure to get all flavors in one bite!

Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese $11.  A panini containing brisket, bacon jam, grilled tomato, melted cheese, and sauteed kale.  This was a fantastic sandwich, but I'm not sure why it's called a 'grilled cheese'.  It was a little hard to pick up and eat, but worked just fine with a fork.  The brisket was tender and flavorful, and all the other accoutrements complemented the brisket perfectly.   

Pastrami Burger w/ Swiss $11.50.  Burger topped with pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Thousand Island dressing.  I did not try this one because I don't like anything on it except the burger patty, but was told it was fabulous.

Bunless Bacon burger $11.50.  The flavor of the burger patty stood on it's own, it was very good even without toppings.  The bacon was think cut and really good, not very salty.

Sides are $0.50 if you add them to sandwich or burger.  The Sweet Potato Fries were the best I can remember ever having and the tots have truffle oil and some awesome secret seasoning on them.  Both a must try.

Something to note: they have canned soda for $1.35, no fountain drinks, but the citrus iced tea is brewed and very good.

The service was what knocked a star off for me.  We were served by the same lady on both visits.  On our first trip she was sitting at the counter eating after bringing our drinks and we had to flag someone down to take our food order and she came over.  Then she left the restaurant after dropping off our food and no one else ever came back over to check on us.  I had to go up to the counter to ask for our bill.  It was a little odd especially since the place was empty.  I would have liked a refill on my very tasty citrus iced tea (online menu states 'free refills'), but I guess that was not in the cards. 

I thought that this may have been an isolated incident of bad service because it was a Saturday and we were the only people there, so I came back for lunch on a weekday and the service was marginally better.  We did not see much of her, but on the upside, she didn't leave either.

Their menu offers a number of delicious-looking burgers, sweets, and of course mac & cheese. But above all else, you have to try their signature TNB burger. A beef patty is topped off with a crispy baked mac & cheese brick, further topped with deliciously addicting bacon jam with sriracha mayo. I was surprised by how soft and light the buns were as well. I ended up splitting this, but it made me want to eat the whole burger myself. There were so many different flavors and textures with the mac & cheese baked to perfection. 

 For those who aren't locals, you have to try the well-known, but off-menu ube pancakes. You get three fluffy, soft pancakes, sandwiching ube cream cheese topped with young coconut shavings, condensed milk, and a scoop of ube.

The server talked my friend into the french press coffee, which she received the entire press at the table to refill her drink.  There was cappuccino on the menu and the server told me that it was the real way to make cappuccino.  As I lived in Italy for six months and feel in love with a good cappuccino, I ordered and prayed he was right.  He didn't disappoint.  Truly an enjoy cappuccino.

There are a lot of heavy items on the menu.  I asked for a few recommendations and agreed to the Florentine Frittata.  Really light and fluffy eggs with tomato, spinach, mozzarella, and pesto.  It came with potatoes.  He forgot the biscuit with gravy, so by the time I got it, it was cold.  I tasted the gravy and it was a little too peppery.  So, while I only ate half of the frittata and got the privilege of taking home the rest, I ditched the biscuit.

My friend enjoyed her omelet and french press coffee.

Their menu consist of eggs, omelets, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, cheesy mac combinations, burgers, soups, and salads. Finding the right meal for you shouldn't be an issue at all. With all of the different options at Truffles N Bacon, I stuck with something my diet needed and that's eggs.  I got their Country Scramble ($10.90). This scramble is 3 eggs with bacon and sausage. I also added chicken breast to up the calories and protein. This meal also comes with potatoes and biscuits & gravy. For less than $11, this was a good deal and tasted good too. The portions were on point. It's their biscuit and gravy that stood out the most. The biscuit itself was buttery and even though it was drenched in gravy, it was still flaky and had some crunch to it. I just loved it. The service was fantastic and the owner is as good as it gets.

4107081,2017-09-27,7,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"I skipped the truffles and didn't love the bacon, but I enjoyed my breakfast anyway.

Truffles N Bacon Cafe is in one of the smaller buildings parallel to Pebble on that movie theater-containing plaza on Eastern Avenue near 215. I found myself in the area during breakfast and decided that I should finally visit this fairly well-received restaurant, which is only open for breakfast and lunch and serves food for both during their hours.

After signaling my interest in grabbing a table to the gray-haired host/server and requesting a glass of water (surprisingly to my liking: little ice, no lime, and no offputting flavor) and a coffee ($2.75, the comes with refills as expected), I sat down to try to figure out what I wanted to order. I ended up with a different server, and I was not just disappointed that she didn't offer much help beyond giving me more time to mull my options but that the aforementioned gentleman seemed to be able and willing to guide newbies at other tables through the menu.

Nevertheless, I eventually chose the Buttermilk Chicken & Waffles ($13.59) as the centerpiece of my meal. The serrated knife is purely for show because both the chicken and waffles are fork-tender. The waffles are flavorful and nicely chewy, and they're perhaps my favorite non-crispy waffles yet. Normally, I would bemoan the lack of that texture on the waffles, but there was more than enough crunchiness in the impeccable, golden-brown panko breading of the chicken. There was actually so much chicken that it almost feels like chicken with a side of waffle, and that's not unwelcome for me because it wasn't dry and had the aforementioned textures.

The menu also suggests some premium add-ons for this particular dish. I skipped out on cheese or the option to sub french toast for waffles, but I did add on the signature Bacon Jam ($2.59). It came on the side for some reason, which is fine because it let me visualize the more-than-sufficient portion. I can see how some people might like the bacon jam, with the onion-fortified richness, smokiness, and hint of jalapeño, and so might I with the right dish. However, I didn't enjoy my bites with bacon jam significantly more than those without.

Butter is included on the side, and it does help as expected, but isn't strictly necessary. The server brought out both normal and passion fruit syrups for me, but not sriracha honey, which is listed on the menu but wasn't seen at all on my plate. Hmm... anyway, the passion fruit syrup was definitely the better choice here. Although I didn't get the distinctly flavor of the uniquely tart fruit, I tasted a more interesting, fruity note than in the other boring syrup. Try both syrups, just in case.

Along with dessert, I ended up taking half of my meal home in a to-go box, but maybe a ravenous eater could devour the whole entree alone in one sitting

I also had the French Toasted Bread Pudding ($7.75). Unfortunately, this arrived at the same time (perhaps a server misunderstanding, or a kitchen judgment call) as my entree. Fortunately, it was fantastic. I loved the smooth, light bread pudding with that French Toast crispiness on top along with a modest amount of rich caramel syrup, and the fresh blueberries did add a nice tartness. It's not all that sweet, but even my sweet tooth didn't mind it. I tried all combinations of the bacon jam and one syrup, with a similar neutral or slightly positive reaction each time. Despite the price and not-that-generous portion, I'd order this again any day.

Noting that there were some portable options, I also ordered some baked goods to-go. The Chocolate Chip Cookie ($1.25) doesn't offer anything special other than the high density of chocolate chips. It is small and has little chewiness to offset the crunch. The Mixed Berry Scone ($2.25) was much more interesting, despite being similarly diminutive in side. It appears to be more of a Scottish take on scones than anything American and looks and feels like a somewhat less airy/crumbly biscuit. I enjoyed that they baked the crust to a golden brown and made sure that there is plenty of berry flavor in every bite.

Decor is welcoming enough, and they've gone with keeping the guts of the ceiling exposed. I liked my ""booth"" seat with the cushions and pillows, and there are plenty of those as well as tables. It was not crowded because it was a weekday.

Truffles N Bacon Cafe is at least a solid breakfast spot in my book. I'll definitely try their lunch options eventually. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll be able to bring some friends here to share items from the diverse menu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,9,4,6xzGCcNnHxVatSkjnvo1cA
4122636,2016-12-11,0,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"I've been wanting to go to this cafe for a while so I was excited to come when a colleague and I decided to have brunch together. I've been seeing it pop up on my social media accounts so I was excited to see if it was worth the hype.

The waitress that took our order was very kind. She offered some great recommendations to us and was very accommodating. My colleague decided on the Not Your Momma's Grilled Cheese (grilled cheese panini with brisket, award-winning bacon jam, tomato, and sautéed kale). I decided on the TNB burger (angus beef burger topped with grilled mac 'n' cheese and bacon jam). 

The food came out fairly quickly and man, were the portions huge! Having to use a knife and fork to slice up my huge burger, I went ahead to take a giant mouthful of food.

The food was pretty good. The burger was juicy and fresh and the mac and cheese complimented the bacon jam a lot. Bacon jam was just the way it sounds, sweet and savory at the same time. One recommendation is asking the customers how they would like their burgers cooked, since the server had not asked me for my preference -- though I had no complaints. However, nothing honestly stood out to me that made me want to come running back.

Prices are a little steep, but the portions were worth it. We had more than enough to take home for another full meal.

Though Truffles and Bacon sadly did not live up to the hype, don't pass up this cafe. It has great food and service, just nothing I would drive across town for. Maybe when I'm around I'll come and visit, but there are a lot more options right across the freeway entrance.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,1,1,3,-fzsob6j4RIGQg5NDXDj8Q

I visited this ""new"" place (it's actually just relocated) with high expectations according to the previous Yelp reviews I had read, unfortunately, the dish that I ordered fell incredibly short. 

I will disclaim that this relocation is still brand new, so I assume they are working out the kinks. I ordered the Chorizo Eggs Benedict. It sounded amazing and unique when it was described to me, but I didn't enjoy it at all. First off the eggs were not poached properly, one was over cooked (the yolk was solid) and the other was undercooked (when I cut into it there was a milky white, runny fluid). The chorizo patty only slightly resembled a chorizo flavor; it was not at all like I imagined. And the potatoes that accompanied the dish were incredibly bland and flavorless. The biscuit appeared to be homemade; it tasted good, but the lack of delicious runny yolk that you would typically find in a bennie was missing so they were pretty hard.

To be completely honest, I disliked the dish so much that I didn't even eat it. Instead, my BF was so gracious as to share half is his TNB signature burger...now that was tasty!! I would recommend you by pass the Benedict and order the burger instead. 

As a former server, I understand the obstacles and missteps that can go along with soft opens. With that said let me end by saying that I do intend on coming back and giving them another chance after this location has been open for a while.  I hope at that time I will be able to try a more satisfying dish and update my review.",cglyQq_IWXEuAFKXYhNXgg,2,2,2,XQuC-9fMzO1u8Po-xuM20A

I was sold after seeing the photo of the sinful tots. Tots with bacon jam and truffle all sound like the best of all worlds coming together in the potato-fry world.

SINFUL TOTS-- I think I may be spoiled with the bacon jam from Carson's Kitchen, and was happy, but not mind blown like my coworker who was literally having a mouth-gasm with every bite. 

I'm NOT a huge fan of mixing certain foods I love together, such as their signature burger that combines a burger with mac 'n cheese. I was thinking, ""really?"" An FYI: I'm not a fan of combining hot dog with chili or burger, though i love them separately. Same concept was going in my head for the burger with mac 'n cheese. 

Well, am I glad my coworker was there to want this burger, because it was by far the best decision I made today. Somehow all that stuff together really worked. The spicy sirracha mayo worked with it, too. And believe if or not, the side salad that comes with the burger had a lovely, zesty vinaigrette that contrasted well with the loaded, greasy burger. My only critique would be that the bun could've been better. I didn't find it to be appealing in any way, from the flavor to the texture. But hey, I could use some low-carb action so thanks for saving me some calories.

We came for lunch, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that they were offering breakfast as well. My french toast was served with bacon butter and a passion fruit maple syrup. I can't put my finger on what it was, but there was a flavor in the french toast that pushed it to the next level. It also had a nice crispness and was a generous portion with five pieces of french toast. I added a side of bacon and that was also very good. It wasn't your average bacon and tasted like it may be maple smoked. 

My husband had the country scramble that was equally delicious. The egg scramble was delicious and had large pieces of sausage and vegetables in it. The hash browns were flavorful and not overly salty. My favorite part was the biscuit and gravy that comes with the meal. Biscuit and gravy as a side is genius and it was well prepared.

I also ordered chocolate chip cookies and an apricot scone to go. The chocolate chip cookies had a rich chocolate taste, but weren't as buttery as preferred. They were good, but probably not the best item they offer. The scone blew me away. It was perfectly prepared-buttery, flaky, and tender. The apricot added just a tad of sweetness without being too sweet.

It has bacon, ham, mushrooms and their signature breakfast potatoes (cut like fettuccine) drizzled with truffle oil and topped with a sunny egg. And the freaking BACON JAMMMMMMMM!!! I could put it on everything. We live all the way across town so going to Truffles is not at all convenient, but it is SO WORTH IT!!

4458826,2018-05-05,0,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"Had to try this place since I see it posted on so many foodie bloggers pages. It definitely has the picturesque factor in their meals, and the taste of it is pretty good. 

We ordered:
* Spam Fries- delicious!! it's spam covered in katsu crumbles and served with sriracha ranch. My only concern was that it is pretty pricy for a starter ($8 when most entrees range from $10-$15) 

* Pork belly omelette- I wasn't too fond of this one, they mince the pork belly in really small pieces so I wasn't even too sure if they put it in there. It was also way too cheesy for my preference They also put a green pepper or chili there on the side (note that it's REALLY spicy!!) 

* Pork Belly Burger- SOOOO FREAKING GOOD! It's filled with 2 pcs of glazed bacon, 2 pcs of glazed pork belly strips, cucumber & lettuce, angus burger, on a sourdough bun and served with a side salad. The cucumbers were pickled so I removed that and the shredded lettuce bc I didn't like the flavor of dressing they put in it. Other than that it was pretty good! 

* Truffle Tots- seriously, no wonder they're called truffles and bacon because they NAILED this. It was so flavorful, like when you took a bite it was seriously a burst of flavor. Sooo good. 
* Truffle Fries- i think the tot form was better, but it still tasted pretty great! 

They have a lot of secret menu items like the ube or nutella french toast, so request for that if you'd like it. I'm sure the place gets pretty busy and that waits can be long due to the size. It's on the smaller side. Parking is no problem since it shares a private lot with the Cinema & other local businesses, and the location is great- right off the eastern/215 freeway exit. 

The service is great as anticipated, food came shortly and we were out in no time. I hear the place gets pretty packed so I waited until brunch on a friday that way it'd be less crowded in which it was. This place is pretty good but it's a bit pricy, so I don't think i'd be eating here as often as some others do. But every once in a while it'd be nice! I definitely would like to try the BEAST BURGER (which you have to order 72 hours prior to you visit).",9teqovwDI0r7m1M-f5eq5w,2,1,4,0b7W5h34pt5ONG6Dj9GQYw

Food my kids enjoyed the chibata bread with denver egg and bacon. My french toast I give it a 2 star I think I should have eaten it right a way (ordered it take out) it became hard and not tasty eating it. Also I think I was thinking of waffle toast but I ordered instead a french toast which it doesn't matter it was the kind of bread that they used. Will probably come back and will eat in instead.

Service is great, with the only complaint that this place is extremely uncomfortable to sit & dine in at. The tiny tables are set up in a way that doesn't make sense, and you are super uncomfortable and smooshed together. And with the awkward lighting of the place, you need to wear polarized sunglasses.

I had the "" Not 'yo Mama's burger "" which consist of a huge slab of cheesy mac, angus burger and bacon jam which just melts in your mouth! The shop is both clean and tidy and has that country  home atmosphere. All the staff members were attentive and greeted everyone with smiles as they walked in despite how busy they were. I would thoroughly recommend ""Truffles and bacon"" to anyone who is hungry for a fat juicy burger. Oh...they serve breakfast and sandwiches for the light eaters too (which I know is just as good). Make it a point to check rhis place out if you're in Henderson, you wont be dissapointed!

The tables and chairs are clearly purchased second hand, which is not a problem but it definitely took away a little from the place.  When you are eating at a wobbly table and your chair has rips in the seat cushion it definitely takes character away from the place.  I had the chicken and waffles and it was 5 stars.  The chicken batter was amazing and it was cooked perfectly.  Lots of food for the money, brought more then half home.  My husband had 3x3x3 and he said it was below average.  They did his eggs wrong 3 time, so attention to detail is not their strong point.  While I would go back, he said never again.",yZ3Zm1fBfqlBWhFikW7MEw,0,0,3,2c_oyDq5_RuuTTi8aRyGpw

First found it on Restaurants.com and have been wanting to go for months. Hubby and I finally made it there for lunch today. I am pretty sure that we will now be regulars!

I had the Monte Cristo with truffle fries. The best Monte Cristo I have ever had. So much flavor, every bite made me smile. The fries were very tasty too.

Hubby had the Belly Burger with sinful tots. Easily in the top 3 burgers he has ever had. It was almost to big to eat - burger, bacon, pork belly, sunny side up egg, onion rings, oh my. And those tots are just too good. Bacon jam rocks! We also enjoyed the Citrus Tea and Herbed Lemonade. 

Much too full for dessert this time, but I think next time we might just get a plate of the sinful tots and one of there yummy looking desserts.

In yet one more of the ubiquitous Las Vegas strip malls, this gem of a restaurant needs to be frequented by discerning diners who appreciate food with soul. Those of you who are searching this city for the elusive great food....eat here.  Worth the trek off the strip...

Prices are a steal for what you get. Here's what we had today for a late lunch: (obtw, they had just closed up when my sister showed up....and opened the doors back up to invite our family in.  Now, that's a family-oriented joint!)

The first dish was a WOW!  
Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese:  Grilled Cheese Panini with Brisket, their Award-Winning Bacon Jam, Grilled Tomato and Sauteed Kale.  I was stuffed when done, and that after sharing 1/4 with my sister.  Yummy goodness I would definitely recommend.  Spend the extra 50 cents and get the truffle-oil tater tots.

Another WOW!

TNB Burger:  Meat Patty (that actually tasted like fresh-ground high quality beef), crispy mac-n-cheese, bbq brisket, and Bacon Jam on a perfect bun.  My friend had the fries with it.  They are yummy in their own right, and dipped into bacon jam, made the dish perfect.

The third WOW!

BLT Steak Sandwich.  Now, this isn't a sandwich with slivers of steak....it's a steak, in a sandwich.  With fried thin onions, jalapeño bacon, lettuce, tomato, and yes....Bacon Jam.  I was too stuffed to try a bite....(sad face).

Drink some of their fresh passion fruit iced tea or lemonade with your meal, and you can't go wrong.

For dessert....the kiddos had a sweet waffle topped with ice cream and fresh strawberries.  The rest of us shared a large bowl of bread pudding topped with ice cream and caramel sauce.  OMG.  Two of us who ate on the bread pudding 'hate bread pudding.'  Funny, I couldn't tell.....as it was being devoured with gusto.

Rest of the story.
Bathrooms are clean, restaurant is clean and inviting.  Proprietresses are genuinely good people.  A man came into the restaurant while we were there....looked to be homeless.  They treated him so kindly, giving him a cup of iced water and looked like a little cash.

To wrap up this review.  Go here if you want great food cooked by a chef with imagination, in a great atmosphere, served by the friendliest of people....",UqHTZKPc8mtIkbmWfXid7A,2,1,5,VhhdthhsCulVAJtliLiZng

Customer Service: 4/5 Super friendly staff, always smiling. It felt like I was eating at an Aunties house. The reason for a four was because they forgot about us, but once they realized they did they bent over backwards so that we would be taken care of immediately. 

Da Food: 5/5 What can I say, the food was amazing!!! My wife got the Vegetarian garden omelet and I had the Ube French Toast! It was so amazing and delicious, I still dream of the food. Excellent on the taste. for the Garden Omelet it tasted really fresh and clean. The Ube French toast was bomb, they had an Ube jelly and fresh Ube, it was a nice touch.

Da Price: 3/5 The price to me was a little to steep for the portion size. My wife and I share everything wherever we go and that we can try a little bit of everything and still have left overs. This place's portions were so small that we ate everything barely shared and were still hungry after we left. For the price we paid we were expecting to get a good size portion of food, not the small amount that we did receive. 

Da Wait Time: 3/5 The wait to sit down was really quick, taking our drink order was super slow. They forgot about with taking our food order, they took two other groups' orders that arrived after us. The owner came to talk to us and check up on us cause we were sitting there for a while. She took it right away and our order was placed on turbo because it came out pretty quick. 

Da Ugly: Forgetting to take our order, and then forgetting to bring our toast. Also the portion size, you leave hungry!!!

Da Bad: the waiting, if not for our order,, its for the food and if not the food then it's the check, and after the check is them ringing it up. Wait, wait and wait.
 
Da Good: The food was so ONO!!! I'll go back for their pop up menus and their bomb Ube foods!

I split the burger with my mom because I knew it would be very filling and I'm glad I did. It was really good but I wouldn't have been able to eat it all myself. It also came with a side of fries so it was just enough for two people to eat. If you order this you need to be hungry. Or splitting it. Or both. 

We also got the red velvet cheesecake for dessert which was also very yummy. We split this between the whole table (three people). It was just enough to split. I think with it being lunch I didn't want too much dessert because it would have made me tired by the end of my work day. 

This was a cute little place. It newly opened so it wasn't too crowded but I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a new place to eat.

Pro Tip: You can buy the wonderful Bacon Garlic Jam to bring home as a gift for $12. 

Truffles and Bacon offers up a huge menu of breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers and more. All their starters sounded excellent, but I had to try their Bacon Garlic Jam on toast. I also ordered the soup of the day, which was mushroom soup. My husband decided on the Brie BLT. Wow! It takes a lot to impress me and my stomach these days. Let me tell you this meal was out of this world. 
I could not get enough of the warm rendered down bacon mixed with the sautéed garlic. It came in a tiny cup with sourdough toast points. I wanted to just dump it all in my mouth. My Mushroom Soup was ok. The flavor was good, but it had a gritty texture. My husbands Brie BLT was delicious. The Rye bread was filled with slices of Brie cheese, sautéed mushrooms and bacon!! It came with a side salad and Sinful Tots. Definitely get the Sinful Tots! They are crispy tots covered in the Bacon Garlic Jam, cheese and sliced peppercinis. It is definitely worth the extra money for the upgraded tots. 

The staff was very friendly and our order came out quickly. They also packaged up my Bacon Garlic Jam that you can buy to take home in beautiful wrapping paper.

So instead of deciding which one to eat, you simply combine it all into one dish and call it a night.  

The scent of truffle that perfumes over the entire restaurant is overly heavenly. Once the truffle smell parks itself underneath your nostrils, you'll find yourself salivating until your meal hits the table. 

I now understand what it's like to be a dog watching other people eat food as you desperately hope for a dropping to be able to sneak a taste. The food felt like it took a century to come out. But once it did.....satisfaction across the board to the conclusion of your meal.

Looked great, but the BBQ sauce was overwhelming in conjunction with the stale hot cheeto texture. It was photo ready though, I'll give it that!

Walking in, we were seated right away and noticed that the restaurant was packed with only two servers (and one of them was our hostess who seated us). As we looked through the menu, our server stopped by to introduce herself and said she's going to give us a few min to decide what to drink. It took her about fifteen min for her to come back to our table to get our drink orders. After waiting for another ten min (which felt like eternity), she finally came back with our drinks and took our food order. My boyfriend ordered the citrus iced tea and it was not sweet at all. Because our server was going from table to table extremely fast, we had to flag her down to get her attention so she can bring us sugar for his tea. For the food, it took another 20 min for everything to come out. I ordered the Godfather Mac & cheese and it was delicious. It came with a side salad which was good. The portion was huge and I had to get a to go box for it. My boyfriend ordered the country scramble. He liked his dish but the biscuit & gravy that came as a side was cold in the middle. 

The sad part is that you know the service is slow when you notice other people around you complain.  There was a table next to us who were frustrated because their server (the hostess who seated us) was never around and all they wanted to do was place their order.

It was a lot."" I got the daily special, which was the adobo fried rice with an egg. We shared their sinful tots. The Adobo fried rice was garlic rice, 2 pieces of chicken thighs, topped with a fried egg. The chicken mean fell off the bone, the dish was really good.

Now on to the breakfast mac. I was already pretty full from the burger that I only tried a few bites of the mac. Definitely an array of flavors I've never had in a mac and cheese. And a fried egg to top it off. My boyfriend finished his pork belly omelette so fast I can only assume it was good. Him being the foody and all.

Lumberjack Pancake - Bacon Jam, Bacon Butter, Pure Maple Syrup
Buttermilk Biscuit
Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese - Grilled Cheese Panini with Brisket, our Award-Winning Bacon Jam, Grilled Tomato and Sauteed Kale

Originally visited in June of 2014, the small restaurant toqued by Jackie Lin at that time inhabiting a space within Antiques at the Market, rumors of Truffles n' Bacon Cafe relocating to a sprawling storefront on South Eastern immediately put a return on the agenda - an all new menu featuring expanded options as well as breakfast only serving to elevate intrigue stoked by the creativity and quality seen during my first dining experience.

For sure as 'hidden in plain sight' as the original, the 90+ seat cafe still tucked away from main throughways in a sizable strip-mall with nearby eateries and sports collectable stores seemingly doing good business, it was just after 1:15 that I walked through the glass doors of Truffles n' Bacon and surprisingly greeted by name from across the room, the owner apparently a social media follower, it was with warm smiles that a choice of tables in the quarter-filled space was offered.

Gussied up with large-scale works from a local modernist as a light soundtrack helped mellow sounds from a kitchen twice the size of the entire original cafe, it was to an equally enlarged menu that eyes turned while sipping cucumber infused water, a bit of disappointment in the already-sold-out mac n' cheese bites quickly resolved by selecting two entrees plus a flaky house-made biscuit served a la carte with a sidecar of honey.

Told that portions run large, but not so large that ""(I) couldn't handle it,"" from someone clearly amused by the eating exploits described on this site, it was nonetheless with wide-eyes that plates were received in short intervals, the two-top almost overwhelmed while the pate porting a fluffy buttermilk flapjack literally could not be seen when looking from top down.

Remiss to have passed up the signature bacon jam on visit one, and requesting it in place of the eggs and meat normally served alongside the Lumberjack, suffice it to say that the juxtaposition of savory and sweet is everything one would expect from the item's description, and with a light bit of heat lingering on the finish the only question becomes how best to utilize the condiment, in this case gilding the edge of pillowy pancakes with great results on its own, but even better when mixed with housemade bacon butter and 100% pure maple syrup.

Taking note of French Toast for a future visit, and reluctantly omitting one of the best bread pudding presentations in Sin City as well as the warm brownie that saw me swoon just one year ago, it was to savories that attention was turned for entree number two and although a bit skeptical that the sandwich may have a bit too much going on, the ""Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese"" was actually a well-balanced update on an oft-riffed classic, the golden bread doing an excellent job of holding up to melted cheddar and juicy brisket while sauteed kale and sliced tomatoes added bitterness and acid to offset the another hefty layer of spicy bacon spread. 

No longer limited by a tiny stall in an antiques market or a kitchen without a hood, Truffles n' Bacon Cafe continues to execute upscale American classics at a great value with one eye on decadence and the other on balance.  Though perhaps not as cute and kitsch as before, one must wonder just how far this team could go if given the right motivation and clientele.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,11,4,45hsWUPExHOCHIsNbRdnaQ

The meal itself was quite hearty. For four college kids who have yet to eat breakfast, the food did not disappoint. We shared a couple of bites with each other, but continued to inhale our plates. Overall, the food itself was flavorful and each bite was never a chore to consume. 

The most important thing to do is to tell the waitress from the get go that you are splitting the checks. We didn't do so until our waitress came with the check. When we walked up to the cashier/host stand the individual instantly became frustrated at the fact we requested to split it.

I got The Rawlins Chicken Sandwich - a crispy, fried chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon on Ciabatta bread. It was huge!! I was sad that I could only finish half of the sandwich at a time since it was so delicious. The fried chicken was cooked really well and wasn't dry at all! The dish comes with a complimentary side of mixed greens.

I love tater tots so I was really happy to find a restaurant that offers them. I got the Sinful Tots as a side for $2 more. The tater tots were mixed with truffle oil, chipotle mayo, and their famous Bacon Jam. It definitely lives up to the name sinful. Such a delicious mixture that I felt almost guilty eating it! 

The food takes a while to come out but the waitress was really friendly. I just wish the prices were a bit cheaper (my sandwich + sinful tots side cost ~$16) but at least the portions were huge enough to take some leftovers home.

Service: The staff is very friendly and helpful, they give the restaurant a very local feel and make you feel like you're enjoying a meal with friends!

The service was indifferent and all the breakfasts arrived tepid and were edible at best. As disappointing as the service and food were, the main reason we will not return is due to the Owner/Manager's complete indifference towards the safety and wellbeing of its clients.  You see, while we were sitting at our table by the window we witnessed a suspicious acting man loitering in the TNB café parking lot, pacing back and forth through all the customers' parked cars. The man acted as though he was looking to break in to one of the cars when suddenly he URINATED all over the drivers side of a black SUV (the SUV belonged to one of the TNB customers who had walked in just moments before).  We immediately notified the owner/manager to let him know. To our surprise, the TNB owner/manager responded by saying ""oh, that guy hangs out in our parking lot, we see him every day, he's harmless."" Harmless!?  The manager was not interested in doing anything further. He wasn't interested in warning his customer that their car had just been sprayed with human urine. I can't believe that there are people and businesses out there like TNB that are so complacent towards criminal activity that they are willing to put their customers in harms way.

5583217,2015-03-06,3,S-egzF2c7bRpCUNbZqV8dg,"I don't normally review new places based on one visit but this one was so up and down that I wanted to get some info out there now with the hopes that things will be more consistent in the future.

Today's review is all about S and M.  No, get your mind out of the gutter, I am talking about Service and Menu.  

But first, some info. 1) The hours today were until 7 (glad I called ahead because the yelp site says 6).  2) The TNB burger is not on the menu but can be ordered if you ask.

Now to the S   Service has many facets.  You can have a very sweet owner scrambling around to make you happy and yet basic service issues keep cropping up.  In my case I noticed the following:  1) The waitress asked if I wanted my soup early and I said no, with the appetizers is fine.  Well a) the appetizers didn't come out until the meal and b) she tried to bring us someone elses' tots. 2) The TNB burger was  cooked before the toast point appetizer and then sat under the lights while we were served everything else we ordered, ostensibly because she was waiting to bring it out with the other people's tots.

I watched her have the same service issues with the few other tables.

Now to the Menu. We ordered the Toast Points with Artichoke and sundried tomatoes  and bacon jam (they were nice to leave off the mint peas.), the mushroom and brie soup, the TNB burger and the godson mac and cheese (4 cheeses).  The toast points were ok but I thought the bread was not very fresh tasting as it was very rubbery making it very difficult to eat.  On top of that there was too much cream and it was very messy.  In contrast the bacon jam was mostly bacon and not much jam but tasted fantastic.

The Mushroom Brie soup was excellent!
The Mac and Cheese, as my daughter, the Mac and Cheese aficionado put it, was not the best but pretty good.  My little taste confirmed that while it was good, It did not knock my socks off.

The TNB Burger was the star.  The burger comes on a solid bun with a well cooked and seasoned burger patty topped with mac and cheese in a seared block and bacon jam on top with just a little kick.  THe taste was great, the burger was cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that I had to keep putting the mac and cheese back in.

The other things I noticed were the beautiful art on the wall, and the little couch sitting area. 

So here is the bottom line.  When evaluating a restaurant, you have to decide where there is room to improve.  You can usually improve on service with very little effort such as hiring a smooth waiter/waitress so the owner can stay behind the counter and run the kitchen to make sure the apps come out at the right time.  As for the food, if you don't have a good cook, you are doomed to repeat your mistakes.  In this case,the cook is very capable and has some very interesting options that work so my hopes for TNB is to see vast improvement as they settle back into their new location and perhaps get some needed help.  I look forward to returning in a month or so to see how it pans out.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,7,4,3,Sk6l4kKRuTvztc1lJFEJWg

Sadly I do not go here anymore and can not recommend it.  The business has a dishonest streak that cannot ignored.  They offer up discount vouchers via restaurant.com.   For $10 bucks, you get a $25 off coupon if you spend $50.   The terms clearly state that there is no expiry and that it is valid on weekdays.  When you try to actually use it, you are told that they will honor it for $10 only.  Hell, that is what I paid for it so there is no bargain.  The excuse is that they stopped offering the $25 deal in September and offer a $10 version.  Ok, I understand you changed your promotion but honor your prior commitments.  In good faith we purchased your deal and then you won't honor it when presented with it?   How is that good for business?   Just dishonest greed.   We have been having breakfast at the Omelet House 50s Diner on Desert Inn and The Diner at LVM Resort on Arville Road.  Give either of these a try for some delicious breakfast dishes.

I came in a week ago with my mom for breakfast. It was good, except the glass of OJ I ordered. It was awful. I think it had gone bad or something but our server did take it off the bill. Just disappointed that the only other juice choice was apple. I got the bacon Jam garlic toast. I think they should offer that with maybe like an egg and potatoes or something so it's not just a bunch of garlic toast with bacon Jam, but it was good. And my mom got the breakfast that came with French toast eggs and potatoes. It was very good.

On today's visit with my husband, it was kind of funny, our server Dawn came to our table and asked if we had been there before then she said she'd be right back, she didn't even take a drink order or anything. She came back and asked again if we had been there before. My husband got the chicken and waffles. He loved it. I got the buttermilk waffle with bacon butter then I got a side of potatoes and a side of bacon. That was all good except for my bacon, which was 3 pieces of undercooked ,fatty bacon. I should have returned it. And when she came around to refill our coffees it was lukewarm coffee. I wanted to ask for a fresh cup but she never came around again until We actually had to ask the other server walking around to get her to bring our bill.

We ordered the Double D omelette and the banana walnut french toast. Yum!!! The omelette had kale, spinach, ham, tomato, and roasted peppers. Everything tastes fresh and so healthy tasting. The omelette did not leave me feeling overwhelmed and hurting. I left just enough space to enjoy my french toast. That was so delicious! I'm guessing it was french baguette drenched in a buttercream sauce topped with banana and walnut. So much sweet goodness, you could drink the sauce like a soup, it was so yummy..

We ordered two items on the menu.   A florentine fritata for my wife and a breakfast mac for me.   The fritata came first and my wife said it was very good.   So I took a bite of the biscuit with gravy.   It was indeed very good.   The gravy was very tasty and had a distinct flavor of ground pepper with it which added a dimension to it.   Then my breakfast mac came.   I took a spoonful and put it in my mouth and I cannot describe the surprise I had.   It burst into flavors I did not expect.   Of course I knew from the description in the menu that it had cheese and pastrami,  which I expected to overwhelm the experience,  but it was not so.   There was,  of course, the pastrami and the cheese,  but it also was added the nice flavor of the mushroom,  the hot pepper that continued to surprise my taste buds for minutes after my first bite!   This was one of the most incredible foods I have eaten in a long time.   I HAD to ask to meet with and congratulate the chef on his creation and execution of such an amazing dish. I highly recommend this place to anyone interested in good food to come and check this place out and find out the impressive experience of the wonderful chef/owner who had worked in many of the top places in the country and finally decided to do this in such an unassuming place in Las Vegas!

It was a Sunday morning, so we had a bit of a wait.  After about 15 min, we were told we could keep waiting or sit with strangers at a 4 top.  I don't care about who I sit with (plus I was STARVING) so we all agreed.  The table was kind of tight but it didn't feel too awkward.

Our server was great.  We even had another one come over to tell us we were fantastic people for sitting together.  The food service itself was pretty quick and we didn't really have any issues.

Now the food... I guess I can understand why people like this place.  Everything is knocked up a notch.  The latte was too sweet.  The sinful tots were so salty and drenched in truffle oil.  The chickarones were super oily.  The breakfast mac and cheese was floating in cheese sauce.  Definitely come here as a once every 3 month splurge but not a weekly thing.  I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil (I like real truffles and sometimes the canned stuff) and I think a little goes a long way, but they seem to use it extensively here.

We walked in and instead of being greeted or seeing a sign that says ""please feel free to take a seat"" the staff just stared at us confused as to why we were standing. We asked if we could just take a seat and was sort of brushed off by a gentleman with a sarcastic tone of ""yeah anywhere is open."" This was a Sunday afternoon and there was five other tables with customers and plenty of open seats so they definitely weren't busy. The waitress came over and took our drink orders and gave us our menu. She asked if we had been there before and we said we had not hoping she'd recommend something or explain the menu. Nope. She just walked off and then another waiter came over asking if anyone had taken our drink order, so clearly they aren't very organized as to who's section is who but at least he acted like he cared unlike our waitress. We ordered and proceeded to wait 37 minutes for our order. Our order consisted of a small bowl of mac and cheese and a burger? No reason it should take that long and again there were only 5 other tables, 3 of which had food on the table when we sat down and then we watched one other order get taken out as we were hoping it was ours. The have a completely open kitchen so we watched the staff stand around and talk meanwhile we waited and waited and waited for food we were hoping was good. Unfortunately we were slightly disappointed. The early sunrise burger presented well but was overall a mess as the omlet wasn't fully cooked and created a runy mess. The godson Mac and cheese was really just extra soupy Kraft macorni with some shredded cheese on top. Definitely nothing I'd ever go back for. My biggest problem was when I reviewed my check at the end (which I had to ask the bus boy to get for me as the waitress never bothered to check on us and we were in a hurry now being there for well over an hour.) with the entree section it lists different options for sides such as truffle fires, waffle fries, Tator tots, etc and lists the extra prices should you choose that and the prices range $1, $1.5 and $2. I had asked for waffle fries instead of the greens they list and they should have only been $1. To my surprise there was a $5 for ""cheesy waffle fries"" for $5 and then a note saying no cheese. That's not what I ordered! I just wanted a side of fries like it listed. And to be honest I didn't even eat them because I had requested ranch both when I ordered and when my food arrived since she did not bring it out. 15 minutes later the ranch came and we were too annoyed and spent too much time to even care to eat them. So there was no way I was paying $5 for something I didn't order nor eat. I had to come to the register to get this dealt with because I knew it'd take another 20 minutes for the waitress to come by and the gentleman said there should be no problem getting it solved. Well another women who I assume is the manager came over and talked with my waitress arguing that a side costs $5. I showed her her menu where it clearly states $1 and she then argued with the waitress again saying when it comes as a side like that it should be a smaller portion than the one I was served. Well that's not my problem that's a miscommunication from the waitress to the kitchen! I shouldn't be charged because they screwed up. She seemed very annoyed and just discounted the $4 price difference. Such terrible service.

I wanted to try the TNB burger but I was not going to pay $14.00 for a burger. 

We decided on the godgather mac & cheese (which is listed under ""entrees"") and the not your mama's grilled cheese with truffle fries. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, again is was not busy at all. I was really surprised at how small the mac & cheese was. At $9.50 It was much more of a side dish than an entree. the flavor was very good though with lots of cheese. I didn't taste much of the buffalo chicken since it was small cubes of chicken. It also came with a green salad which was just sitting on the paper lining the tray it was served on, kind of strange. You can see how big the side salad is compared to the ""entree"". 

The grilled cheese was really good! The sourdough was grilled nicely and all of the flavors of the cheese, brisket, bacon jam and kale came through nicely. A really good sandwich. The truffle fries were also good, nice and crispy. 

A solid 3 stars for the service and the grilled cheese. I do think the prices are a little too high for what you get here.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,2,3,5OEfQW0bhh0FpBUa92XLRg

The food presentation was excellent, but the food quality and flavor is why I gave them 3 stars. The steak was chewy and tough, the scrambled eggs were not fluffy, hash browns undercooked etc. I really wanted to love this place, but the food was the crescendo that fell flat. 

I will give them another try for sure as they are very close to home. I also understand today of all days could have been an anomaly due to high volume business.

When we got there, I was assuming for a long line but we arrived around 10 AM which seemed to be an ideal time for a Sunday morning. No line, but the venue was full and busy. We sat cramped in between two other guests who were enjoying their food when our server asked if we were ready to order. 

Rather hopeful about the dishes, I opted for their classic which was the TNB Cafe Signature Hamburger. Now before I begin, I just want you to know that my favorite burger is located in Santa Monica, CA which taunts me to this day because it's not always available for me to have due to distance. So knowing that I have fund my favorite burger is Godsend. 

This burger consisted of Angus patty topped with crispy baked mac n' cheese and our signature bacon jam with sriracha mayo. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant to get it since it sounded a little busy, but I went with my gut. 

The wait time to receive this order was rather fast. And when we got it, many people around our general direction looked at what we were having. The woman next to me even bothered to ask what it was. The burger looked like a piece of art. And it was just as good as it looked. Filled with flavor that was synchronized all together. A hint of spice, salt, sweet, but nothing was overpowering each other. Along with the texture of the mac and cheese and the bacon jam which added the crunch, WOW. It's so hard to describe how delicious this burger was. 

My meal came with a salad which seemed like the polar opposite. You can add fries, but honestly, it was a lot of food to begin with. 

Now, the final question is, would I come back? The answer is straight up, YES! There's no doubt they'll be seeing me more often here. This is truly a hole in the wall.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,2,5,HVx2qDaKGY_QRQ8Pk6qW5A

I'm happy this place isn't packed as well. The inside gives off a homey type of feeling. All in all, one of my favorite places if I want some good comfort food.",FUvz0aGY6qlmykbzKF6W6A,1,0,5,vKK8MEw3Ys_dUshUTuOThA
