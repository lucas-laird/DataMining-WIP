I ordered one large pizza with pepperoni, beef, and extra cheese, 1/2 bucket of buffalo wings, breadsticks to-go. 

The service was really nice, the man behind the counter was patient while my roommate and I were deciding on what we wanted. 

While waiting for our order to be ready we looked around at their dining area and decorations that hung on their walls. The place seemed pretty clean and they had awards hanging on their wall. I didn't really pay attention but a lot of them were appreciation certificates from police departments. 

We didn't have to wait that long for our food, the pizza was spot on! Not greasy, right amount of cheesy, the chicken wings could've been a bit spicier but next time I'll just ask for hotter wings, and the breadsticks were okay, nothing too exciting  but they were good.

To sum it up , it is a very good place to grab something to eat , you'll get your money worth over there with a full belly 

Plus , as Muslims it is entirely halal and they don't sell any alcohol which is rare nowadays lol , the Owner Ahmad was very nice and let us pray in the back

Both pizzas were very light on sauce and cheese. I couldn't taste the sauce on the garlic pizza at all. 
I asked them if I should get extra cheese or if they put a lot of cheese on their pizzas when I ordered. I was told there was a lot of cheese. That was very far from the truth. There was no cheese pull. Nothing 

The garlic chicken pizza had a breaded chicken that had a weird flavor. It just wasn't right.

I've had pizza here a couple times and it is always delicious. The older gentleman, who I'm assuming is the owner, is super sweet and considerate. The last time I picked up a pizza he had me check to make sure it wasn't cooked too much, seeing as it had been a little well done, and that surprised me a little. It was cooked exactly the way I liked it but how many times have you ordered pizza and they send you some super burnt piece of bread and you end up spending the next hour waiting for it to be recooked, delivered, etc. I really liked the fact that he took the time to make sure it was up to par.

I've also had the jalapeno poppers here and I like that they're made with cream cheese as opposed to the cheddar cheese that seems to be the new craze. Deeeeelicious.

Positives. 
1.  Service is still great
2. They still have a $9.99 3 topping special 

That's where it stops. I can only give you two stars. The quality of the food is just not good! Your cheese is cheap. Even as hot as can be, no stringy cheese means a sub par pizza. That and bland sauce means that I'll be using the papa Johns online specials vs supporting a local one.

We decided to check this place out.

Place smelled a little ripe. I guess they also serve Halal food.

Okay, we're hungry, whatever; let's do this.

Well, we were discussing splitting a pizza when my friend asked to the lady behind the counter, ""How long does a pizza usually take (to cook)?"" as we were on a lunch break.

She replied (rudely), ""You want me to rush?""

Wow, not off to a great start, lady. I then explained we were on lunch.

She said, ""10 minutes.""

Okay.

There wasn't a clear Pepperoni Pizza option on their above menu, and that's all we wanted: the most normal pizza order in the world. She had asked what size pizza we wanted as they had 3 options, and I asked if their 14"" Small Pizza was big enough for two people.

She said, ""NO!"" pointed the larger box (which we couldn't clearly finish between the both of us).

So, instead of her rude ""recommendation,"" I told her that we'd like a small pepperoni -- the one we were asking about in the first place.

""........... -_- Anything else?""

""Sure, a couple of Cokes.""

""How many?! 1, 2, 3, 4...!!??""

I don't usually leave restaurants, but I didn't even have to think twice about walking out here.

I couldn't tell you about how the food might've been. I typically don't like to dine at places operated by cold, bitter people.

Don't waste your time. They can't even be nice to customers. It's one of those places where you ask yourself, ""How is this place open?"" That's never a good sign.

Well we got the pizza and it looked like the ingredients were tossed on the pizza after it came out of the oven. There was not enough cheese and it tasted like tomato sauce on dough with some veggies. 

The service was also horrible! We ordered delivery after receiving a flyer under our resort room door. When the driver delivered our pizza he told us we were supposed to order Parmesan cheese and crushed peppers when placing the order. When delivering to a hotel/resort that should be necessary to have some handy, especially when we mention we are staying in a hotel/resort when placing the order! 

When I called to complain about the pizza and mention the lack of cheese and peppers I had to repeat my complaint to two different people! I'm assuming the manager was the last to speak with me and he was very very rude!! Telling me that they normally don't automatically have cheese and peppers on hand because we were staying at the grand view ""resort"" which are like furnished condos. Any hotel is like a furnished condo, you idiot!! A resort does not differ from a hotel in any way other than their reservations and fees. This guy assumed a resort also meant full stocked fridge and pantry in order to save money on having a driver always carry peppers and cheese??? 

Not to mention, the complaint about the pizza was also not taken lightly! I was told I was the first person to complain about their food in 20 years!! Maybe because their customers are normally already drunk by the time they get their pizza late night and it makes no difference to them. This guy then proceeded to tell me that I could call back in the morning to repeat my complaint to their day manager. I ordered our pizza at 830pm, what good is calling the next morning going to do for our disgusting dinner!! I was told they would not send a driver out 30 miles to deliver us a better pizza. Um, Did he not realize that I could google them and see they were only 8 miles away! And even if they were that far, why would they advertise under our door if they were not willing to drive to us! I have never had such horrible service or food!!

I guess Little Italy Pizza doesn't care about customer service or customer retention because they market to the hotels and resorts which contain people that are only here for a few days at a time! Very very disappointed with this place, if I could I would have flyers placed under each resort/hotel door with this review of them. 

I would definitely suggest Rosati's Pizza instead! They aren't open late night but if you're looking for a decent pizza dinner on vacation I would suggest Rosati's.

Also the homeless regulars add a nice touch of entertainment. Can't go wrong with little italy!!! :-)",fOnZOwSbIGj05PYn-3a4SA,0,0,5,WA7d85oIm06RyHt5r3qBQg

4526190,2017-02-02,0,5gv6AqHXfi3gJV4fb432Vw,We were looking for a good halal place that had something for everyone. We ordered cheese pizza and supreme pizza which the kids liked watching them roll out and freshly toss. The pizza was so quick and fresh with halal pepperoni and beef and fresh green peppers and onion. The smell was enough to tell you that it was going to be really good which the first bite only confirmed. We ordered two double burgers and hamburger and cheeseburger which were equally yummy. Juicy burgers dropping with mayo and ketchup and all the trimmings. My little 5 yr old ate a whole six slice cheese pizza saying it was the best pizza he's ever had. The tomato sauce is perfect not a tangy or avidly sauce at all. Just perfect. I will be back to try chicken burger and philly sandwich. Those look amazing as well. The guys behind the counter were so sweet and amazing at making the meal hot and quick.my husband is Pakistani and I'm American and this was amazing place to eat at.,zPD6a5mMw-FPubptoJANkg,0,0,5,OYRdt3b_s04t2j-FcEI09A

While I was waiting, I got a phone call and needed to write down some information. I asked the girl if I could write on an order pad, but she didn't hear me because she was in the back of the kitchen making my food. I went ahead and did it, and when she came back up she had a horrified look on her face, and said that her manager would get upset because all the pages on the order pad have an order number on them, and if one was missing he would accuse her of stealing. So she had to take the note back into the office to show him and clear it with him. I heard some harsh words from her manager (who, as it turns out, is her father), and when she came out, she was crying. I felt terrible, so I walked back into the office to tell her manager/father that it was my fault, not hers. He said he understood and asked me to leave the office. He followed me out, and proceeded to very harshly reprimand the girl for doing absolutely NOTHING wrong. I told him that his behavior was extremely unnecessary and inappropriate, and that he should be ashamed of himself for treating that poor girl so terribly. He was a complete bully, totally humiliated her in front of me, made her cry, and told her to call her mother to come pick her up. I'm not one to intervene in family matters, but this man was a mean, miserable, unmitigated scum bag. I will never, ever give this place my business again.

The pepperoni pizza was cold, bland, and the pepperoni s themselves looked different than any I've ever seen or had before and it tasted off like it was vegetarian or missing that pepperoni taste.
