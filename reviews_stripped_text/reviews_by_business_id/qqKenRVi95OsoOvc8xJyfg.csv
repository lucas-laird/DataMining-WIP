Located in the food court at Greenland (AKA 'Koreatown'), Han's Chicken is a little restaurant serving Korean & Asian fare.  We were just done shopping and were hungry for some dinner but too lazy to think about where to go, we just plopped ourselves down at the food court and decided from there.  Reason we went with Han's Chicken was because of their daily special.  That day they had an actual 'Loco Moco' on deal for $6.95.  Really?  Han's serving some Hawaiian delicacies?  Reluctant to try, I gave in cause the price was right.  The other daily special was Curry Rice with vegetables for $6.95 as well.  We got an order of this too.  After a 15 minute wait our entrees arrived to our table.

Eh...not too special looking.  In fact, on their big, pretty plates our food looked like small portions.  Lots of empty space with our dishes.  Each entr√©e came with a tiny bowl of 'salad' (basically cut up iceberg lettuce, cabbage and carrots) topped with a light 1000-Island-ish dressing.  This was ok, similar to something you get in a fancy sushi restaurant when you get a side salad.  

Han's Loco Moco was pretty similar to what you see at other local Hawaii joints that serve the same dish.  Hamburger patty, topped with a fried egg, covered in gravy, accompanied with white Calrose rice.  Han's hamburger patty I'm pretty sure was the pre-shaped kind you buy from the warehouse store in bulk, but it was pretty big, about a 1/2 pound I think.  But it was overcooked.  The patty wasn't pink in the middle at all, lending to it being on the dry side.  My fried egg was overcooked as well!  Big no-no.  The egg should still be yolky in the middle so when you break it the egg oozes over your hamburger patty and mixes with the gravy to make a good sauce!  Cooked yolk in the middle makes me a sad camper.  The gravy was probably the powdered kind, little to leave in flavor and substance.  Pretty bland and not much of it.  The little mushrooms looked almost like garnish.  This Loco Moco needed some help, but it was eaten by us anyway since we were hungry.

The Curry Rice wasn't much better.  Basically a big plate, a thin layer of curry with vegetables, topped with a bowl of rice.  The curry wasn't the greatest, not full of deep all-day simmering flavor.  It was likely from the box, as it was on the salty side.  The veggies in it didn't add much to the party, mostly some cut up carrots, celery, and potatoes.  But damn, there were a crapload of onion pieces!  Big chunks of onion.  Now I love onions, but the curry was just swimming with them.  For having no meat in this curry, the onions were overwhelming.  Not my favorite.

Overall a disappointing meal.  I think if we do have Han's Chicken again we will go for their specialty, chicken...and possibly their signature Korean Chicken Wings.  Should have done it this time around!  Lesson learned.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,3,FLu2bmH1jUeiJ7i7lHKdXw
4050532,2013-11-22,5,qqKenRVi95OsoOvc8xJyfg,"First off, screw all these fake reviews.

2nd, my Korean Style Boneless Chicken Nuggets (Korean Sweet and Spicy Sauce) was undercook.  I popped the first one in and took it down.. Notice it was very tender.  My second nugget was slightly larger, so it bit half of it and saw it was slightly pink/red.  I cut opened other smaller pieces for inspection, and they too were highly questionable.  Nope.. Not taking any chances.  I should have took a pic, but it would have been displeasing to the eyes with the chunk i spat out.  That image would crack your screen, no question.

I let the cashier know that it was undercook.  She offered an apology and a chance to remake it.  When i respectfully decline, she offered a refund instead. Very kind of her, but I refused that too.

Reason being is that i don't see myself enjoying a whole plate of this to myself (you get a lot).  I felt the sauce was unbalance.  Typical sweet and sour with a little more heat, but the sweetness was overwhelming.  They don't drown the entire batch in the sauce, so not all is lost.  And did i have some pickled radish to throw that off, but it was not in my best interest to create some form of formula on my own.  Written off for a small price.

No big deal.. No harm no foul.  I appreciate the effort, but this wasn't for me.  Maybe if i was sharing this with others.  I'd normally wouldn't bother with this review, but i have an opportunity to back up my rating.

5049712,2014-01-20,0,qqKenRVi95OsoOvc8xJyfg,"I was at the Greenland foodcourt and wanted to try all the spots here since they're all new vendors. I figured I'd start on the right most, and just work my way stall by stall. Now I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before eating or I may have skipped it. 

I got the Korean chicken nugget meal with green onion which comes with miso soup, cabbage salad, white radish, rice. It was a pretty good portion, more than enough. 

The chicken was crispy and didn't get soggy with the sauce, even when I took it home. I chose the soy garlic sauce and it's like kalbi or hawaii soy glaze which was decent, but needed more garlic flavor. There were chunks of sweet potato mixed into the chicken nuggets as well and green onion on the side. It didn't say anywhere it's garnished with sesame seeds and crushed peanuts so if you have a allergy to nuts, you may want to tell them.The white radish was fine, miso is standard, cabbage was fine but they put thousand island which is sort've sweet and I didn't like. 

It took a while to get my food, but I guess I rather it be fresh and made to order than refried frozen nuggets. I would probably eat here again but stick with these nuggets or wings.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,0,3,ySKwi-FeW0aB5ABy8ikPOg

I looked at the menu...and saw raw chicken sitting on the counter. GROSS! I don't need another bout of food poisoning so I left. Obviously, the 5-star reviews here are fake.

5672205,2014-01-13,0,qqKenRVi95OsoOvc8xJyfg,"I ordered Chicken Katsu from Han's Chicken Saturday evening. My family ordered from another establishment a couple minutes before. Their food arrived and was consumed. They were done for almost 10 minutes before my food even came out.

While waiting, I saw a tank top wearing dishwasher spending a lot of time in the Han's Chicken kitchen, there is no way this is sanitary.

My food finally came out... what a disappointment. First of all, I requested no cabbage salad with the meal. I specifically asked for chicken and rice, only. They couldn't even get that simple request handled. Next, I ordered Chicken katsu. Katsu sauce is a ketchup based sauce. I received fried chicken with brown gravy. Their menu states a special sauce, not a gravy. If they gave clear descriptions of what the food offerings are, I could have saved $10 and not ordered food. The gravy is funky tasting and was not appetizing. 

Won't be eating there again, unless I feel adventurous and try one of their pizzas.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,1,8fC8VAWJdMifO2eUdRZxPw
5915236,2014-01-03,3,qqKenRVi95OsoOvc8xJyfg,"Newsflash: This is a real review for this place!  Hopefully soon they will filter all of the bogus reviews for this place. 

To my knowledge, this is one of the only places in Vegas that you can get Korean Chicken wings. so fake hype or not, this place was on our radar however, we tempered our expectations. 

We ordered 1 8pc spicy and 1 8pc traditional BBQ. The clerk said that they are made to order and would take about 10 minutes; so plan accordingly... 

We balked at the prices for 8 wings however it was quickly put to rest with the sheer size of the wings. Reference the soda can in my picture for proof. Size matters! I hate when you order wings and end up with micro sized wings.

The traditional BBQ sauce is very similar to garlic chicken glaze that us 808 people love (think sugois and fat boyz) just not as garlicy.. 

The spicy BBQ sauce was they typical kochujang/garlic spice that we all come to expect when eating Korean food. Very close to Banchan but not quite..... 

Both versions of were delicious and were free from frying defects that previous reviewers reported. My only gripe is that they were not saucy enough. No need to give us ranch to dip our wings in; save money and add more sauce to the wings! Other than that I think that our tempered expectations were met. 


One final note: they offer a free soda with FB or 4-sq check in.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,7,6,4,dw3blc2GXSxqicxZ98iQ_A
