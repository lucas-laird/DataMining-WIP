It is far from my house(25 mins drive) but if you like to try mediterranean food specially Persian this is the place to go. Barg kabab , kobide kabab, tahdigh with ghorme sabzi are the best on the menu that i have tried. The food quality bitting all other Persian food in the town. Tables always design with napkins and almost full set if silverware  that is not every where in usual restaurants.( i have been on top ones so i know what is full set ) 
Yogurt drink or dough is homemade style which is perfect and delicious and brings you the true food culture of mediterraneans.
Servers checking on you every often which is perfect to keep the table clean for next dish that is coming. Pricing is fair for the quality, also if you are a fan of live music, they have live music on weekends i think. I have not been there on weekends!

1340238,2018-01-14,0,jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"If there is one thing I crave about Persian food, it is the creamy and aromatic spice flavor of Cashke Bademjan, which is a delicious and Authentic Persian Eggplant Dip, and it's a personal favorite appetizer. I am hoping to get the same food experience at this restaurant. I did find it unusual that this specific item is not listed anywhere on the dining menu, but it is on the to-go menu worded differently. So I place an order of the Kashko Bademjan ($7.95) and the Falafel Plate ($9.95). 

The Kashko Bademjan has eggplants sautéed with garlic and herbs, and it is topped with kashk yogurt, a drizzle of fried mint, caramelized onions, and serve with soft pita bread. I am a bit disappointed with this dish. The quality flavor is there but with the excess amount of oil, it makes it very difficult to enjoy eating with pita bread. 

Now the Falafel Plate comes with four deep fried patties that are a mixture of chickpeas and fava beans and is serve with a cucumber yogurt dip, along with a crisp lettuce salad that has slice tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled red cabbage, and basmati rice. The salad is good and the basmati rice is cook to perfection, but the deep-fried falafel patty taste dry and crumbly like crackers. Even if I add the cucumber yogurt, the dryness texture is still unappealing. Maybe if they had made this into a falafel ball and deep-fried it, the outside will be crunchy but inside the falafel ball, it may still remain soft. 

The service is good and the dining area is clean. You can easily find this restaurant by looking for the Snug Harbor sign and you will see the light post. There is one thing that is puzzling though, the music in the background. It makes me wonder why are they playing Spanish songs at a Persian restaurant. That is so not authentic.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,0,0,3,06lEJbjpqAohcnRjzr_A5g
1486982,2017-12-01,0,jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"Today is my third trip to American gypsy cafe. I've had twice for take out and once I've eaten there 

This is the best Persian food I've had in vegas. The food is consistently good.  If you're from Los Angeles you're familiar with Raffis.  That's my benchmark for kabob.  Well this is as close as you're gonna get in vegas. 

The khoreshts both the gheymeh and ghormeh Sabzi are just ok. The tadig was thick but tasted a little old. 

The joojeh kabob on the bone is moist and juicy and full of flavor. 

The beef soltani is always delicious and a must have. 

The ground chicken from the chicken soltani is not over powering and is juicy. The chicken breast barg is seasoned differently. I'm undecided if I'd order it again. 

The rice is perfect. I've had both the plain and zereshk.  

Portions are huge. 

Service is better than most Persian places. The owner is always there. 

The restaurant is usually slow. If you go and no one is there go in anyway. You won't be disappointed !!

Enjoy. 

Update 11/30/2017
I've gotten take out a few times this week and I've noticed the quality of the food has gone down. 

I tried the thadig with ghormeh sabzi.  Delicious but not enough of the ghormeh sabzi to accompany the thadig. We ended up throwing most of the thadig away because it was just chewy and greasy.  I know it's a sin to throw away thadig but that's how bad it was. 

My biggest disappointment comes from beef kubideh.  It used to be a higher quality beef.  It's now rubbery. 

The zereshk polo used to be full of the little berries. Now there is less than half of what they used to give you.   It's all yellow food coloring with half a  handful of the berries.",_UwZg-ztV7gc9u0zsRSHxA,0,0,4,84pWo_iEHy9PIutD4Rck6A

I ordered the chicken and beef koobideh kabobs!  My meal came with basmati rice and a salad and Pita bread on the side!  They have a spice called Sumac which you put on the kabob.  It adds a nice kick to the dish.  The whole cutural experience was amazing.  I spoke with the owner for about 30 minutes about where he was from and the origins of the food he makes.  I feel like ive been to Persia just from one meal here!  The owners are wonderful people and Im very excites to try more of their foods!

2116192,2017-07-17,2,jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"I came here for lunch yesterday as I was coming back from an errand in North Las Vegas. I have been craving the vegan ghorme Sabzi and could not curb the cravings any longer! 
First impression walking in the door is that this is very much like the Persian restaurants in SoCal I have grown up going to with my family. The decor was nice, authentic, & the atmosphere was very mellow and inviting, yet classy. Tony, the owner was very kind, and although I saw they were set up to have a large party, he was still accommodating to my request for a vegan meal. There weren't very many vegan options yet but he did explain that they would be adding more within the next week or two. Definitely piqued my interest for return visits. 
We ordered a Shirazi salad (which is my last name..as this particular salad originated in the city where my ancestors are from). It came out aesthetically pleasing and tasting exactly the way it should. Fresh, cut up just right, and with the perfect amount of lemony seasoning. Tha basmati rice with saffron was perfectly fluffy, with no butter just as I had requested. The Ghorme Sabzi was flavorful and cooked for the amount of time to truly get the flavor right. Also, this food was not overly salted so I was able to add in the amount of salt I wanted. 
I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely return. Tony is a class act that you can tell genuinely cares about his business. As a patron- that really matters to me where I spend my money. 
I'm looking forward to seeing what items he will be adding in the next few weeks, and I am already craving my return!",QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA,6,3,5,YigUkZOpDtfGQcZG6XovtA
2129666,2017-05-11,0,jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"I was very impressed by this place. 

I was looking for Mediterranean in the Eastern and Flamingo area and stumbled across this place on Yelp. 

I had never seen it before on yelp so I do not know how long it has been open. When I traveled on Flamingo I actually passed it because everything in this particular shopping center appeared to be closed (in the middle of the afternoon). Once I actually pulled into the parking lot it's still appeared that everything was closed. 

Once I walked in, I realize that this place is very nice. Very clean, and very nicely decorated. The bathroom was also extremely clean which I truly appreciate. 

I went with the lunch special of the chicken skewers. It was $8.95 and I couldn't believe the amount of food that they had for that price. One of my coworkers tried the bread that came out and said that it was warm which was awesome but quite chewy which was not awesome. 

The server was friendly and his service was great. The food was very good. 

One negative was that I wanted a second chicken skewer to double the protein on my plate and they charged $6.95 for it. The entire plate was only $8.95. I think that an additional skewer at lunch should have a lunch price so that an $8.95 lunch special doesn't turn into $16 plus tax and gratuity. 

That being said, I know most people don't get extra chicken so it typically would not have been an issue. 

I will definitely be going back on future lunch breaks.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,0,1,4,hiToeVa9BLK_4sIsK66ygw

My only wish was that they had more selection on dessert but that's just small oversight. I'm glad they are back up and operating and will be returning soon.",NJpmODCPI8bEwlwOKCv5NQ,1,1,4,8u_rfZB4MfqQxRwyjH5w5w

3527793,2018-06-08,0,jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"We were craving Persian food and went to American Gypsy Cafe with another couple for dinner this week based on the strength of the yelp reviews. Although the food we ordered was good, the restaurant was out of a significant number of things we would have ordered that are standard fare in such a restaurant,and the service was neglectful, even though the restaurant was not busy.

We arrived at 7 PM on Thursday evening, the place was clean and presentable and there were three tables occupied. The four of us were seated at a nice booth. We ordered beers and doogh (yogurt drink) and the Greek salad as an appetizer. We were told that they did not have the tadigh (crunchy bottom of the pot rice appetizer), which we had been craving. We were surprised by this considering that the tadigh is a byproduct of the cooking of a pot of rice, and the restaurant serves rice.

For the main course, we ordered some soltani beef kebabs with rice, some koobideh beef kebabs with rice, and one of each of the stews.  After several minutes, the waitress came to our table to inform us that the stews were not available except in vegetarian form. Again, we were surprised and disappointed, but we ordered one of the vegan stews anyway, because we wanted our friends to try a variety of Persian food.

The dinner arrived quickly while we were still on our salad course and we had to make acrobatic moves of our plates to allow things to fit on the booth table. The salad was well seasoned, the kebabs were tasty and so was the rice. The vegan stew (gheymeh) was just OK and, as earlier mentioned, we would've preferred for it to have the chunks of meat normally found in this dish.

After our meal, we asked for the dessert menu and were told that they were ""out of dessert tonight."" We ended up ordering a few teas, which were brought out with a few Keebler like box cookies. We were disappointed that we were not able to introduce our guests to Persian ice cream and the other Persian desserts that are normally served at such a restaurant and were indeed on the menu.

In sum, we were somewhat underwhelmed by our dining experience and were left wondering if the place should not have limited itself to being a kebab house and lowering its prices accordingly. Given the exceptional variety and quality of restaurants on and off the Las Vegas strip, we would be hard-pressed to go back to a restaurant that is seemingly out of everything but the kebabs we ordered.",OX9YI-QyGaDrWFwnI8rAEQ,0,0,3,4IpYjGafv43oy0TgSNXA2A

Tonight we had friends in town and my fiancé being Persian wanted to introduce them to chicken kabob, koobidah and tadig.  We ordered the food to go.  When she got the food home we were completely disappointed.  The beef was burned, greasy and tasteless.   The gaymeh was very oily and was unappetizing.  We paid over $100 for that meal.  What makes me angry is my fiancé called to get a little satisfaction and the manager did not even apologize.  After stewing about it I called the restaurant and spoke to the same manager.  She was unapologetic and told me if I bring the food to her she can see what I'm telling her.  Implying that I was lying.  Like I mentioned before, I had friends in town and did not want to drive uneaten food back there.  Her customer service was horrendous and she should not even be allowed to speak on the phone.  All I wanted was some sort of satisfaction.  At the very least an apology but she acted like I was trying to rip her off.  Very disappointed and I will never go there again.

I wanted to get away from drinking and the pool, so I headed out to the nuclear testing museum.   After leaving there, I was starving.    I looked on Yelp and found American Gypsy Cafe.   It was just a mile down the road.  perfect!

I pull up to a strange lighthouse at the front of the building.  it totally threw me for a loop.   I entered and a gentleman was seated with his feet up behind the host station.   It was a little warm in there, but they quickly turned on the AC. 
I sat by the window.  I looked at the menu and my eyes got huge. 

I haven't had good Persian food since I left Los Angeles.   I saw tadig with ghormeh sabzi and had to order it.  I also ordered the chicken kubideh.   

I could have ordered one or the other and be satisfied.   Instead, I was served enough food for 4.  Challenge accepted.

The tadig was crunchy.  The ghormeh sabzi had great flavor.   If they had given me one of the dried limes, I would have been overjoyed.   

My chicken kubideh platter was enormous.  I had asked for half rice and half salad.   I ended up leaving the majority of the rice because I was already full when my food was brought to me.  I was also going to head to the Pinball Hall of Fame, so didn't want leftovers in the car.   I tucked in.
