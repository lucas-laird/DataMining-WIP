491589,2012-08-29,1,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"So let me start by saying I have never been a real fan of sushi! I had a bad experince at a sushi bar and said I will never eat that nasty crap again. I'm more of a burger and fries kinda guy anyway! But a good friend of mine insisted I go and that this is the place. So ya you only live once why not try some un-cooked fish wrapped in rice!!

Here's the thing, if your a rookie sushi person like me don't worry. The chefs here will recommend the right roll for you! I do suggest going with someone you know who will push you just enough to try the amazingly decorated plates of sushi! The staff there was great! We went with the all you can eat! Even tho the place was busy it seemed that there was a fresh plate of sushi or lompia waiting for us to devour! Before I finished a full roll of  sushi the chef was asking us what we wanted him to make us next! Yes, you order it and they roll it and make it right in front of you which was an experince in its own! 

I must say that this place has given me a new outlook on sushi. I can say that I like that un-cooked fish wrapped in rice covered in sauce and falvor! This was the first time I went there and wont be the last! 

I recommend the yoshi dynamite, the Stalone, and shrimp tempora. Great place for a date or hanging with friends and overall price you just cant beat it! Eat all you want as much as you want for under $25 bucks a person.

The AYCE option allows you to pick almost anything on the menu and let me tell you the menu is HUGE. It was very hard to pick.

I cant remember the name of the rolls I enjoyed but the Las Vegas Roll just wasn't for me. It sounded great on the menu but I think that raw snapper just doesn't do it for me.

You can also tell when he has someone he knows around the bar. They get served before everyone else, service is slow and you receive very little attention.

Each sushi portion we ordered was small, lacked the seafood, and the quality was overall lower than before. The edamame even smelled funny as if it had spoiled. I don't know if this restaurant got a new owner of the years, but this sure appeared as if a new owner who didn't care for quality had taken over the restaurant. On top of the poor food quality, the menu was slightly adjusted to limit and restrict what you were allowed to order from the all you can eat menu. For example, only 1 dessert was allowed for each person.

However, it's been a disappointment.

First of all, their food is okay.  it's not particular better than another Japanese restaurant. Although they said it's all-you-can-eat, you can only have one Uni per customer.  I can understand that. However, they didn't even have it tonight and they won't even let us know while we are ordering it.  

Moreover, one waitress suddenly tell us a new policy: additional sushi such as sweet shrimp are now only limit one per customer as well.  This ""new policy"" was not even show on the menu at all. One of the waitress was quiet impolite. 

The deliver time took a bit longer. In addition, some food we ordered were lost and never delivered.  It's lucky that it's ""all-you-can-eat"" (sort of). Otherwise, we might get charged more than we ordered.

After we tried it in person, I can tell you that this was not a good experience. I hope that they should be clear with the policy and treat each customer the same.  Until I hear some improvement from fellow Yelpers, I prefer to go other place.",k7McWqCW36crpakCWUFG6Q,1,0,1,6iNLzdx6E2FfAJ3iz2e0oA

There is another similarly titled sushi restaurant on Eastern, at which I had a TERRIBLE experience (see my review here: http://tinyurl.com/awh5l9f), so I thought this was another location for that same restaurant. Thankfully, my experience here was the exact opposite. 

Like most other restaurants in this shopping center, it's pretty small. I actually thought there was more room in the back when I first came in, but realized quickly that what you see is what you get once I sat down. There aren't really any spots you can be seated to avoid the cold wind that blows every time someone opens the door, if you dine during the winter as I did. 

The service was impeccable - the waitress was very friendly and prompt with placing our AYCE orders. In addition, our drinks were refilled constantly and empty plates were removed almost instantly. 

As for the rolls, my favorites ended up being the Las Vegas roll and Xtreme Tina Crunchy roll. I also had the Dragon roll and Caterpillar roll, but those are pretty standard among all sushi restaurants typically. I had no concerns about the freshness or quality of the fish. I ended with the tempura ice cream for dessert with no complaints.  AYCE for $25.95 is pretty standard pricing as well. 

All in all, I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised by this place since it's so close to home. I'll definitely be going back more frequently now that I know it's nothing like the other Xtreme Sushi place!",6N8scdRhsaGLZxvqriE7iw,3,1,4,erzh7w-QOqlEkySrpVmC9Q

We stood at the door for 10 minutes waiting to be seated when there was clearly 4 empty tables. The hostess did not make eye contact with us, and continued to serve the patrons that she just sat down, as well as the other customers. Their first order arrived before we were even seated. The lady at the register didn't acknowledge us. The chef saw us and knew we were waiting for awhile, but did not say anything...not even a friendly hello. When the hostess finally saw us she told us to sit anywhere (as if we were supposed to know that). When we were finally seated and began to order from the all u can eat menu the hostess/waitress tried to stop us in the middle of ordering to tell us it was too many. Our goal was to order everything we wanted to eat with plans that we wouldn't be given good service and because there is a 1 hour time frame for all you can eat. It took a while for our order to arrive. She never cleared our table so we had a few spills that we cleaned up on our own because plates of new food and empty plates took over space. We had to ask for refills on water, and continuously had to remind her of the rice or miso soup that we ordered. When dessert arrived, I accidentally knocked it off the table (again because our table was full of plates that piled up). She saw that my ice cream fell on the floor, which I cleaned up on my own, and was never offered a new one. After waiting 10 min at the door I know we should have walked out, but we were in the neighborhood craving sushi. I would rather have driven the extra 10 miles to our favorite spot on S Durango & Flamingo. The food was okay. I've had better, but I think the service didn't help make it an enjoyable meal.

1977642,2012-11-13,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"I love Xtreme Sushi. Although I no longer live in Las Vegas, I still manage to visit there when I am in town. Fish is always fresh, they offer some crazy inventive rolls, and the price tag is low. Who could ask for anything more? Well, I could.... I know, some women cannot be pleased. I just wish this place were larger and I wish it weren't associated with the one on Eastern & the 215 (can we say ghetto?). 

On our last visit, 11-11-12, the place seemed to be showing signs of wear as far as decor goes. Maybe someone could invest in doing a little touch up maintenance to bring it back to its beautiful glory of week 1 opening. But nonetheless, the sushi was great. My personal fave is the X-Box Specials they offer; you get miso soup, salad, shrimp & vegetable tempura, shiumai, and a California or Spicy Tuna roll with either teriyaki chicken or beef or salmon. Not a bad deal for $16. 

Of course they have the standard rolls: dragon, rainbow, California etc... but they have some really fun ones too. The Pacquiao is a fave of my friend, Sonny. The 702 Roll & the Money Roll are always ordered for AYCE. The Volcano is just that.... lava in your mouth but oh so delicious.

Honestly, this restaurant was just okay. They have a TV mounted on the wall with a good amount of seating inside. Something worth mentioning is they have this ""all you can eat sushi"" special for $25 and that's including a complimentary ice cream dessert. My two friends decided to go for this deal, but I decided to just get a regular entree instead. The prices are a little on the high side especially for the quality of the food.

Our server, actually confessed she isn't a connoisseur of sushi so she doesn't know what they look like.  I was like ""Really?""  Why would you be a server if you don't know what you are serving?  We ordered our food and was not happy with the service.  We didn't order AYCE so I expected our food to come at the same time.  My partner got his sushis and I was left without any food.   I ordered a bento box that came with miso soup and salad.  They didn't bring the soup until I asked about it.  Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good, most of all the grilled BBQ salmon that came with my bento box.  The thing that really somewhat made the experience unpalatable was the service.

2358455,2010-07-06,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"I just love Xtreme Sushi! This time the chefs were different, since the normal chef/owner was his day off (he is our favorite).  

However the chef we had was pretty good, a little slower than our normal chef but I am rating for quality of the nigiri sushi and the idea of AYCE of everything on menu (except sashimi of course and hamachi Kama) is fantastic! 

They only had 2 servers last night, but they did pretty well considering they were really and hectically busy. The restaurant was full and I noticed that they were forgetting someone's order, but obviously the customers patiently waited with out complaints.  They must be there for the same reason that we were, for the fresh quality of fish and AYCE of everything on menu! 

Appetizers:
Fried Soft shell Crab - very good, crunchy and tasty

Fried Calamari - The BF's favorite, he is Italian and says that it's better than most Italian calamaris

Fried shumai and steamed shumai - I prefer the fried shumai than the steamed

Shrimp Tempura - love their tempura, this is when we noticed that the 2 servers were a little frazzled because it took a while for them to get our tempura sauce. I ate mine without the sauce and no complaints. 

Teriyaki Steak - The BF said that they put too much sauce, but the steak was really good.

Baked Muscles - Oh goodness, can't have this without our sushi! I love the sauce especially when I slurp the muscle and sauce all in one breathe! It's so steamy hot and delicious!

Nigiri Sushi -
Yellowtail - Oh my gosh! We have never seen any chef take a whole fresh fish from the back and cut it how they are suppose to for Nigiri's. What a treat and pleasure to see! We ordered a total of 5 orders of fresh Hamachi and it was soooooo fresh and delicious! 

White Tuna - This is one of our favorites! It's so darn good that it just melts in your mouth! We had 4 orders.

Red Snapper with slice of Jalapeno on top - We first discovered red snapper nigiri with the Jalapeno on top while we were in Cebu Philippines at our friend's restaurant. Ever since we fell in love and snapper with the spicy crunch of Jalapeno is just so damn good! We had 2 orders.

Uni - I love love and it tasted so fresh and yummy, although my bf doesn't like it because of the texture.

Surf Clam - This was okay, but I ate it anyway.

Salmon  with avocado and smelt eggs on top - This was my BF's creation and I was so surprised how good this was! I even squeezed a little fresh lemon over it and it was awesome!! 

Smelt Eggs and Ikura - These were both good and fresh, when it is too fishy it's not so fresh but it was just right (we learned this from Japan)

Unagi - It is as good as it gets, especially how they always listen when request for extra crispy.

Salmon Skin Handroll - This is the only thing that was off. I guess it depends on the chef. It's usually crispy salmon skin, but he made it with the salmon meat and a little bit of skin which was not too crispy. Don't get me wrong, but it was still really good!

Baked Scallops and salmon with Eel sauce and Siracha - This was my creation and it was really good! 

Amaebi with fried shrimp heads - Very fresh and sweet and a great combo with the crispy shrimp heads! 

I really wanted to try the rolls, especially because you can order half orders also with appetizers and nigiri! This is why I love Xtreme, because although there are rules, they don't disappoint me when I want to order little by little. 

Next time I have to try the special and Xtreme rolls in half orders, which comes in 4 rolls instead of 8!

The reasons only four stars is the selection. The menu isn't very extensive as rolls all have rice, no screaming orgasm and limited apps! They also are very selective then on making things not on the menu. Lastly some of the rolls are a little heavy on the balance with the rice.

The fish taste spot on and the rice portions are small and has just the right amount of plumpness to them. The sushi chef went a little nuts on the wasabi on certain nigiri, but once we notified him it was better.

I think the reason why Xtreme is so under the radar is because their rolls are nothing spectacular. I love them but frankly it's nothing out of the ordinary. The service is great but they aren't necessarily the fastest when serving, Goyemon will burn them in a heartbeat. However, the one thing that Xtreme does do right and are the BEST at is serving the freshest nigiri. The yellowtail, sweet shrimp, tuna are just a few of the nigiri to die for. I thought this bliss was shortlived when their quality was not up to par the last few months but recently I gave Xtreme another shot and I'm so glad I did.

One thing to note though, on a trip to the bathroom, I did hear one of the new chefs just totally berating the staff and being an uber douchebag. From what i found, he's not even a senior guy...he's a new guy barely there a month and already acting like he owns the place. 

DEAR OWNER: keep your eye on this guy. I'd hate for your place to start getting that unhappy vibe if the wait staff is under oppression by a tyrant sushi chef.  Otherwise, keep up the good work.

Warm greetings are projected right as you walk in the door.

My friend and I went today for the AYCE lunch deal and it was $20 per person until 3PM. After that, it counts as dinner and I believe it is $25. AYCE excludes sashimi, haha.

We were seated immediately and decided that we were going to sit at the bar. Our server was great and every time we made eye contact and it looked like we were in need of something, she was there to help us. Our chef was very nice and he gave our orders out to us in a quick and timely manner. He tried to converse with us also and we had a few laughs together.

Now the food!
Appetizers- The miso soup was delicious and my favorite thing from the appetizer menu is the baked mussel! If you go there, definitely try it! I kept ordering it throughout our meal, hahaha. My BF loves gyoza and will order it anywhere we go but he said the ones here were delicious.

Lasagna Roll: My most favorite roll EVER. I have tried many sushi places and this place definitely makes it to my liking the most. It comes out hot and delicious and since my appetite gets the best of me, I am not patient enough to wait for it to cool down xD 

Dragon Roll: My second favorite roll from the menu! All of the sauces on it were so good and I just kept wanting another order of it.

Caterpillar Roll: That roll looks very cute and it tastes very good.

Yoshi's Dynamite Roll: This roll was the yumyum scallops with different sauces and srircha on it. It was spicy but it was soooo good!

King's Crest Roll: The BF ordered this roll and it was pretty huge so I let him have that all to himself, hahaha.

We ordered more but those are the ones that really pop out. Our stomachs were definitely FULL by the time we were done but of course I did not pass up the chance to get some vanilla mochi ice cream :] Haha, this place will remain my one and only sushi place because it is worth every dollar.",E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,3,2,5,5TT3ijZ34Gr2JMhbBOVdrw
3599663,2010-12-01,10,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"Went in on a Tuesday night with high expectations after yelpers and co-workers raved about this place.....

We decided to sit up at the bar and check out the action up close. We were greeted by the two sushi chefs that night. One of them was Guy, soft spoken, looked like a local Hawaiian dude, and the other chef was this Japanese dude
with hair parted in the center and a mole dead center of his forehead. From here on out, he'll be known as ""JD""(Japanese dude)

So for round 1, we order some nigiri- hamachi, salmon, uni, garlic tuna, and unagi. Our orders come up, but we still have no plates, chopsticks, wasabi, or ginger.....""My bad, "" says a server"" I'll get you some right away"" Finally when we get squared away with our attack gear, we dig in.  All the seafood tasted fresh and good but THE SUSHI RICE WAS AL DENTE?!?!?!?!

Pasta and Risotto yes, but not sushi rice!!!!!  Most reviews on this place highlight their ""minimal rice and more seafood"" ratio, especially the nigiri sushi, but what good is it if the rice isn't done right? 

People also seem to be thrilled at the fact that you can order anything on the menu except for sashimi, but why would you pay for AYCE sushi and get filled up on  a salad, bento box, or noodles? 

Already off to a sketchy start, we decide to order some side dishes and wait until the batch of crappy rice is done, so  we order some shrimp and vegetable tempura, baked mussels, and I ask about hamachi kama(Grilled yellowtail collar) and the waitress informs me that they do have it, but its not included in AYCE.....WTH???????

the sides were okay, but we came here to get our sushi on. By this time there was a different batch of rice, so we order a couple of different half rolls- the volcano, jojo's poki roll, and the helmet roll.
The Volcano was tasty, the helmet was okay, but the poki roll wasn't
poki at all, just a mix of diced tuna, onion and ocean salad?!?!?!WTH?????

At this point, my tea cup is ice cold and takes me forever to flag two different workers just to get a refill of hot green tea, which they also charge $2.75, while its complimentary at other sushi bars.

I'm also starting to build a barrcade of plates between me and the lady eating next to me, hoping it doesn't go TIMBER! like a chopped tree, but  the sushi keeps coming, this time from JD.

we order more nigiri and some handrolls-amaebi, fresh scallop, ikura, white tuna, and the baked fantasy roll...We also ask JD if he can do a tempura broccoli and avocado hand roll for Sylvia, and my favorite salmon skin hand roll for me. So JD hands a poorly constructed handroll to Sylvia looking like its ready to fall apart before even taking a bite, and my salmon skin hand roll is dripping unagi sauce from the bottom. Maybe he needs to go get lessons from Jin and Ynot from Blue Fin or Jesse and Jimbo from Sin City on how to make a proper hand roll because JD's skills are pretty lacking, or maybe its his stale sense of humor that had other patrons saying ""what did he say?""... Not a very personable dude who had a lot of people lost in translation. After the hideous handrolls, we(actually, I) continue with more nigiri, repeating orders of hamachi, salmon, scallop, white tuna and unagi...

While the wifey has tapped out and wanting to try something different, I decided to put JD to the test.....at this time, he's assuming I'm ready for dessert....

JD: ""Dessert ?""

Me: ""nope, Sushi""

JD:""Still!?!?!?""

Me: ""Yup, All you can eat, right?"" ""What do you suggest?"" ""do you have any special items or creations you like to make?""

JD:""Nigiri, or Roll?""

Me:""You're the sushi chef, I'll leave it up to you....Surprise me""

Most sushi chefs like the idea of a challenge, surprising customers
with their custom creations, but with JD, it was like pulling teeth, and instead of rising to the challenge, he had these additional remarks...

JD:(pointing to me and telling Sylvia)
""This guy, no limit, huh?""
""Just like Kobayashi"" (former competitive eating champion)
""Man, we lose money tonight""

So after all his ranting, what was his ""surprise????""
He hands me an order of tuna nigiri-WEAK!!!!!
Unimpressed by his antics, I order a tempura fried ice cream for dessert.   
Meanwhile, he's scraping all the fatty goodness of the Tuna skin and throws it in the garbage.
whips up about 3 orders of negitoro looking sushi....hands one order to the guys watching sports....hands the second order to the couple to his right , and hands the third order to the couple on his left...completely passes me up...pretty childish....He probably watched my time like a hawk, and/or didn't want to lose any more money.
Like he watched my time, I watched his every little move behind the bar.
One of the couples asked ""Wow, what was that you just gave us, it was delicious!

My friend, who's a sushi chef @ Marssa, kept telling me that Xtreme Sushi by my house was his favorite spot and I kept thinking he must be crazy cuz it's off strip and in a still developing area; AND I couldn't believe a place near my house was THAT good (let it be known that Southern Highlands is in dire need of foodie spots).

I should've listened to him a long time ago...I'M AN IDIOT!

ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT lunch special is at 12-3 and it's UNDER $20!!! I think dinner is around $24, which is average. 

And it really is all you can eat! Like, EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!!!!! E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. (except sashimi) But, there's appetizers, specialty rolls, curry, soba, ramen; I can go on & on & on...
And trust me, I tried eating on & on &on... 

The pieces of unagi were hugemangous..the same for the yellowtail =) And the sushi tasted so fresh. It's like they have the ocean in the backyard and they catch the stuff right before serving! Unbelievable. 

The specialty rolls were ahhhhh-maaaa-zing! And you can order smaller portions with pieces of 4 so, you can SAMPS more rolls. My favorites were the Kayla and some unagi roll which was crisp on the inside and outside.

After this lunch feast, I was done. SPOILED! I absolutely cannot eat at any other spot than this...EVEN SUSHIMON SUCKS in comparison. Believe it.
Now, I tell all my friends, I don't want to eat at another sushi spot if I know I can get all-you-can-eat ridiculously hugemangously yummy sushi here!

Do yourself a favor and SAMPS this place! And if you're eating lunch here, LET ME KNOW, I'll meet you.

3775411,2011-10-19,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"My roommate and I decided to come here last night. We had both been to the location on Eastern and had bad experiences (horribly slow service), but decided to give the original location a chance based on word-of-mouth and its better Yelp reviews.

We walked in and were immediately seated at a table in the corner. Upon opening my menu, I was hit with an extremely foul odor. My roommate initially suspected it was fish being cooked, but upon closer examination we realized that the strong vinegar-like smell was coming from both of our menus. I can only assume they used a dirty rag to wipe the laminated menus.

We ordered our first selections for AYCE and waited almost half an hour before anything arrived. There were dirty dishes sitting on the empty table next to us the whole time. When questioned on the wait, our friendly server explained that the chefs were backed up and that everything would come out at once. She asked if we would like anything from the kitchen, so I ordered some steamed gyoza and tempura vegetables, which came out reasonably quickly. There were two sushi chefs working, with about seven occupied tables and six people at the bar.

Once the food came, it was generally good. My roommate did have a couple of issues with the menu descriptions - he said that his ama ebi did not actually appear to be ama ebi, and had the same issue with the super white tuna. The Kayla Roll and Las Vegas Roll were both delicious, and the fish seemed fresh and of good quality. Another bonus was that the portions of rice in the nigiri were very small, as mentioned in some other reviews. 

The chefs seemed to catch up eventually and our subsequent rounds came out a bit faster, but we were still left waiting quite a bit. During some downtime, I was admiring the modern decor and sleek lamp above our table when I noticed the cobwebs in it (photo attached). 

I'll give this location two stars for the food and generally friendly service, but will definitely not be returning. I'll stick to Goyemon, Sushi Mon, and Oyshi in the future.",g0hpMcW5zJgJHMR32f-W0g,2,0,2,R603Of3-uaLujWJQwY8n_A

3993324,2010-09-27,1,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"This is similar to any of the other sushi restaurants in the Vegas area.  They had a very extensive menu: appetizers, salads, sushi (rolls and nigiri), sahshimi, noodles, bentos, donburi, and desserts.  Of course they also have an AYCE option.  This is where Xtreme sets itself apart somewhat.  

With the AYCE option, EVERYTHING on the menu except sashimi, is available for you to order.  So if you wanted two bento boxes, a bowl of udon, and some sushi, then Xtreme sushi is your new best friend.  Like most AYCE places, you are only allowed one order of uni, but  on the bright side, you are allowed unlimited orders of ama ebi with the deep fried heads!

Now for the negatives.  The most obivious for me was the location.  It is really far to drive for AYCE if you live in the Summerlin, Henderson, North LV areas.  The other negative during my visit was the service.  It is a smallish restaurant and they had two sushi chefs, two waitresses, a busboy, and a cook in the back.  When I started eating there were only three other parties, but yet no one seemed to be in charge.  There was a lack of overall coordination.  The service only got slower as more people came in for dinner.

The tab at the end of the night with tax and tip came out to about $35, average price for an AYCE dinner.  I think the best option in terms of value would be to drive out for the AYCE lunch special for $20.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,1,3,jhHeirPElQduICoqUtG7jg
4050531,2010-05-14,6,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"Every now and then I'll hit up a spot and neither review them, nor pretend it really happened.  Xtreme Sushi was ""ehhhHhhh"" at most..  

I came in on a week night and sat myself at the bar next to two other couple.  It's a small little restaurant with one chef behind the bar on this particular night.

I order 1 AYCE even though I'm sure I can do 2 AYCE for just myself, but I'm more reasonable than that and rather save money. ""Just 1 AYCE will do, thanks."" 

I started off with a few piece of Nigiri.  Some scraps were left in the fish which was no biggie.  I just asked for another clean napkin as i separate and spat out the chunks into it, and discreetly dump it in the restroom as I do not want to disrespect the chef

I go ahead and proceed to try other fish. So far not so bad, but then this Gaijin next to me wanted to chime in.  ""Hey, you should try their Spicy Yellowtail Nigiri, bro.  It's Amazing.""  He goes ahead and order me it and I accept, but get this, the chef had the Spicy Yellowtail mixture premixed!  Sooo I take a piece and toss it in my mouth.  I was expected to be blown away since it came from the chef's hidden secret stashed, but meehHh..

I proceed to go about my route and order other stuff including Garlic Tuna Nigiri.  Now THAT was amazing.  So I thought to myself they must have really good Maguro (Tuna) today.  I order one and a salmon too.  My new sushi buddy overheard me and told me that their salmon is ""Phenomenon.""  Ok, buddy..
I get my sushi and the tuna clearly did not look anywhere as near as fresh as the garlic one I just moments ago.  Even my salmon looks slimy!  At this point I'm befuckled.  Was I not getting any love from the chef?

I stuck with a few basic and safer choice from my earlier selection, and finished off with the chef's special Spicy Yellowtail but this time hand roll and I think a complimentary mochi for dessert.
I go home right after dinner and puked my brains out because i felt sick from what i ate.  Must have been the chef's special because that's all i could taste in the back of my throat ;(

Verdict:  Find your own sushi chef and stick with him.  I'm pretty sure all these Sushi place gets their fish from the same vendor, so keep a look out for the slower restaurant since they don't rotate as much fresh fish as the busier establishment does.  Also don't trust Gaijin (non-Japanese) that winks at you.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,3,3,2,kKZ6a6h0KeHoAxJMZinymw

The employees are so nice and welcoming. The service is always great.
One cool thing about this place is that you can order half orders of rolls and salads so you don't get full off of one roll or a full salad during your AYCE stay. I have never seen any other sushi place do that before.

I've been to the original location on Eastern & 215 a few times and absolutely loved the food, service, and ambiance. Therefore thought this location would be the same. 

I live down the street and thought ""How convenient!"" First visit was take out for some basic items: tuna sashimi salad and philadelphia roll. Fairly good.

My second visit i ordered a rainbow roll, tuna salad again and a screaming orgasm (seared tuna, shredded radish on a ponzu jap mayo sauce) and a hawaiian roll. Mediocre as the fish on rainbow roll seemed a little dried out and flat if that is even a good description. The screaming orgasm was alright, tuna slices were very thin but i love the raddish and sauce. 

My last visit has allowed me to make my decision that i will no longer visit this location unless they change something. I really hate to say that because it may be hurtful but i've given this restaurant several attempts. 

I ordered a philadelphia roll and yet again a screaming orgasm. Philadelphia roll was stuffed with cream cheese that i ha to slice open each piece and remove half of the cream cheese. The scream orgasm tuna was not fresh. The sauce was in a smaller container than i've ever seen. And the presentation in the to-go box was depressing. I completely understand that during transportation of food it's going to roll around. But im very cautious with my food when i order to go but really!? Fill up the container with raddish to cushion the fish or something. I cannot believe i paid $10-12 for a pityful order.

He also mentioned he would not know what to order so I proceeded to tell him no  worries I will order away for both of us. 

We had a few rolls ordered first thing, the Yoshi's dynamite roll which they top with tuna and yum yum sauce and then torch it to give it the real smokey flavors that I truly enjoy. No keep in mind that ordering for him was like watching a early 90's Mike Tyson Fight. Quick and to the point and it was like he was punched in the mouth and had no idea what had happened to him. He was hammering the rolls after that and could not stop saying how great the rolls are and how awesome all the appetizer option are, in his book this place was a complete win. 

Now for me, I obviously enjoy all the rolls, but this time it got interesting. I decided to ask the chef to make me something SPICY, of course I was given the scale, "" okay, spicy between 1-10"" I said make it an 11 and he attempted to spice it up, his first attempt was to make the snowman on fire, which is amazing and has slices of jalapenos on the top but that is very standard as far as spice is concerned for me... I then let him know that it was tasty and had some spice but was not HOT. A few minutes later he walked over holding this half roll of what looked like a sure slow fiery inferno of death. It was a roll with no regular wrap... It was wrapped with Peppers and stuffed with EXTRA spicy crab and then filled with other hot peppers, covered in sauce and torched. Talk about amazing, It was so delicious and then a good 5 minutes after eating it my mouth began to pulse. I may even have shed a tear and to this moment I am still not sure if it was due to happiness or pain.

These guys and gals are always on top of it. The sushi is always top notch and the service is always stellar. How do you go wrong with an AYCE that allows customizations, tons of options for even the faintest of sushi eaters and any and every app. you could ask for.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,1,1,5,eKPPzh3zZsfCJVpb6UlbQA

We walk in and the 3 of us grab a seat at the bar.  Xtreme is an AYCE place, so we took full advantage.  I wanted to start off with California Rolls as I was a little apprehensive.  But, there was a foot that went down and a different order was placed for me.  Michele and the waitress took matters in their own hands.  This place is great, because you can order half rolls and try everything.  So, I started out with the Protein Roll... Tuna / salmon rolls.  So, good, it was at this moment that I knew I was hooked.  I don't even remember every name of the sushi dishes that came out after that.  I just knew everything was incredible.  The sushi chefs were kind and amazing.

Since we had a 5 year old in tow, who loves seaweed and her special roll, the chefs made sure she was taken care of too.  As we were leaving one of the Chefs gave her Japanese gum... 

I have been here twice now and, I couldn't give this place a higher ranking.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,7,7,5,9I5IiBudbZujo9ogi7jLHg

After leaving being done from a tour of The Grand Canyon I was ready to demolish some sushi before heading back to L.A. Well Thank You Extreme Sushi for being there and on my way home. 

Staff and service is good and the All You Can Eat option is just great. Huge selections under one price ($25.99).

Will return again when I am in Vegas.

Thanks!",UtmsHIyNNgeVZlm6CYLWjA,0,0,4,fSwyoiG6UDh4H6PhGy8gwg
5529351,2010-04-05,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,Pretty run of the mill AYCE sushi. We only went here because we were at The M and the buffet there was closing in an hour.  My eyes were bigger than my stomach of course and still ended up stuffing myself to the gills.  I should've went to Barcelona instead.,8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,3,3,3,bO8Qcl7ksl68Xe2nEgEDaw

Xtreme Sushi is fully deserving of a perfect score. I love the people who work there, the menu selection, and you can not beat the price for their quality.

We always sit at the sushi bar so we can talk to the chef, Fredo, he will create new combinations and cuts from fish that we have never seen on a sushi menu. I can not express how amazingly delicious and plentiful the food is here.

ALWAYS get the buffet, because even though every sushi roll you order is completely satisfying there are still dozens of other rolls that are as good and sometimes, surprise, better than the last roll you had. This place is foodporn for sushi lovers.

This place is consistent on all counts of great customer service, great food, great pricing!

5633956,2013-05-10,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,One of our new favorite AYCE Sushi places. They have an extensive menu of yummy options. They have a little bit of everything.  My husband and I tried about 10 different rolls and I would order 9/10 again. We went here on a Wednesday night and the fish was fresh...I even ate sashimi and it tasted great. The dessert wasn't the best so I wouldn't get that again...but who needs dessert when there is more yummy sushi to eat?! ;),K57Or8FN_mQI2QVa8Z0HyQ,0,0,4,VnaIyUrohpA-ioMQpCoVgQ

BUT,  I think I'm done. I don't know why it bugs me and I can't seem to let it go, their menus are filthy - sticky, dirty, and kind of soggy! It grossed me out so bad last time! 

I will say the food it not bad, and the service is ok, but damn those menus!  - it makes me wonder how clean the rest of the place is...",9xlwSCtOABq2CuzY_REQpw,1,0,2,U4Mrpz4HtChO9DChd3CxEQ
5918638,2010-11-14,4,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"This in my opinion is a top quality AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  Even if it is really far from where I currently live in Las Vegas.  Driving out here is almost like driving back to California, you are near South Point Casino and M Resort.

But if you are in the area, and looking to eat some of the very best sushi in Las Vegas, this is one of the spots I recommend you hit up.

Pricewise, it is fairly reasonable.  $19.95 for AYCE lunch (until 3pm) and $25.95 for dinner.  Kids AYCE is priced at $11.95.  And you can order just about everything from their extensive menu (except sashimi and single orders on the regular items like uni, amaebi, etc.).

The restaurant is on the small side, but the decor was nice. My friend thought it was better than Sushi Mon.

Food was delicious, fish was fresh and fried items like calamari were baked just right (still moist and not overcooked and rubbery).  Service was pretty good for our group of 8. And we were not rushed or anything even though we were there for a good 2+ hours, eating, drinking, and eating some more.

These are what I particularly enjoyed:
* Teriyaki Beef (possibly one of the best in Las Vegas, perhaps a little sauced but the beef itself was great).
* Calamari (prepared just right!)
* Sushi Poki Salad (fish were fresh)
* Fried Soft Shell Crab - so good we ordered seconds.
* Baked Muscles - one of the better ones available in LV.
* Uni, Hamachi and Super White Tuna - must have in my book.

If you are in a large group, you will likely be automatically charged the 18% gratuity. Which is cool, since there appears to be no time limit to our AYCE dinner.

If you have never tried Japanese food, this is the place for you to experiment with the sushi and other menu items. The option to order everything but the sashimi in the entire menu, is great for adventurous beginners to get a taste of everything and find out what they like or don't like.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,13,12,4,qo6J-uME1XJZMzZdbafgEQ
5952018,2011-02-15,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"By far this place is very generous with their sushi, it's not just all rice.  Fish is fresh but not the highest quality but for AYCE it is good.  The appetizers were ok nothing wow but if you like a lot of sushi this is probably your best bet.  I love the fact that the owner is japanese and the chefs are japanese making the sushi and onigiri.  I might come back here if I crave a lot of sushi but my favorite so far is 808 hand down even my daughter who is really not that picky said 808 is also her favorite place and we go to a lot of sushi places in LA so now we decided to test out some of the sushi joins here.  808 you rock. xoxox",RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,0,0,3,GOr-WSrm6IPe5JbNnuXTew
5990955,2011-03-21,0,6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg,"Ayce sushi includes everything. (I think it might be a weekend only thing.) Fresh food. This is my mom's local friend's favorite sushi place. I thought the service sucked but the food was good. It's rare to find places where full-on Japanese like the sushi being served so this is makes me happy. 

I like that you can get some of the Americanized stuff (dragon rolls, etc.) in a four piece set instead of an entire log. I like trying some of the weird rolls but don't want to make a meal of them. They have a lot of traditional Japanese nigiri that I like. The only thing is that if you get the AYCE sushi, you can only get one order each of the uni and ama ebi.",AVx7i10wyGXgb9tv2KB1vA,1,1,4,MLZoKeSd5FMpIwt1ojL67g
