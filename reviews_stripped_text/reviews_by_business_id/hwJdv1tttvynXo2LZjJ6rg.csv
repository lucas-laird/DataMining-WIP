Gross I am still Verping 3 hours after dinner! 70.00 wasted! The next morning, we went their for breakfast (I thought, How can they screw up breakfast) Boy was I wrong... I ordered scrambled eggs with onion, potatoes, and bacon. The eggs were dry, the onion in the eggs was RAW, the potatoes were deep fried and so crunchy they were also VERY dry! The service also was horrible, there were two ladies working. We had to stand at the entrance for at least 8 mins before anyone said hello. Most of the tables were dirty, and the one waitress was clearing the tables so slow and kept holding her back. IDK....

1899283,2017-01-15,0,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"Charming little American restaurant serving a few surprises and staffed with super nice people.

Service - Excellent. Forget these other reviews, first of all. There is a difference between slow and bad. Easily overwhelmed? Yes they are. Bad servers? No, absolutely not. Paris, our server, was actually very quick to take our order, quick on the refills, and brought the food out hot (well, one exception, not her fault). Hostess is super slow to sit you and the cooks take a bit but overall was very happy. Actually adding a star just for Paris, she was great. Again, witnessed other guests acting inappropriately, shocked at the composure the staff kept, makes me think they get it a lot.

Food - adequate, prob should be a three star for the food. For starters, we got the lobster Mac and cheese bites. Sriracha sauce okay, not spicy at all tho. The ""bites"" are huge, it took like 4 bites to eat one. Three per order, unfortunately one was still cold in the middle, oh well. Both of us got the ribeye, fairly standard, a little overpriced but you're a captive audience, where else you gonna go? Came with a side of grilled veggies, these were pretty good, a winter squash, parsnip and carrot that seemed fresh. Baked potato, standard.

Drinks - they have a separate bar that makes several cocktails, fairly good list actually, even have two fairly respectable whiskey flights. Wife ordered a sidecar and they ran out of cognac, so bartender asked if brandy was okay, turned out alright. I had a jalapeño margarita, jalapeños were pickled, still not sure if I liked it this way but overall drink options were nice touch, more than just blank and coke, gin and tonic, etc. Wine list very small. Didn't make it to the bar to see the beer selection but it was just a few handles on tap, the evil blue oval of bud light was the only one I recognized from a distance.

Ambience - sitting by the windows watching the snow fall made us forget that a patron assaulted a server and police came to arrest them. Over wait times. WTF is wrong with ppl? Can't fault the restaurant for who shows up. That aside, there's a few fireplaces that give a warmth and glow, but also look like they need a deep scrub and some new paint. The country music playing has all the top hits from 1995. The view really is excellent and the huge vaulted ceiling with log cabin decor adds to the feeling that you are in Colorado not Nevada. I overall thought it was pleasant and enjoyable.",Fhius40l4G-Dc0Zdou9HSg,2,1,4,ACU6CB9rpgL-YP9A7Grgxg

2125428,2011-11-15,2,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"I've been putting this review off for awhile now because I've needed a certain element to complete my review.  I just obtained it so here it goes...

My wife and I stayed at the Hotel for a wedding over the weekend.  The hotel is old and dirty.  The rooms seemed like they were from the 80's.  Our room was even slightly slanted which felt like walking on a cruise ship when getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.  But this review is not of the hotel but the restaurant in the hotel.

We were a party of 7.  All our food arrived.  We started eating and then my wife gasps.  I look over to her and ask what the problem is.  She points down at her food and says there's a screw in my bacon.  I look over at her plate and indeed a metal screw was cooked into the bacon.  I couldn't believe and immediately stopped eating.  Lost my appetite and called the waitress over to get the manager.  At first there was no manager and the waitress said she was sorry and she was going to comp my wife's meal.  WHAT?  All seven of us are hungry and we have stopped eating our meals due to your horrible kitchen conditions and all your going to to is comp my wife's meal.  I was only thinking this while the waitress left to go see if she could find a manager.  I then followed her to listen in on the conversation.   

In the end they ended up comping everyone's meal at the table.  I thought they could have done a little more than that seeing how our breakfast was ruined.  Oh well...   I'm sure all seven of us will NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!

I posted a picture we took of the screw in my wife's bacon.  The screw was actually cooked into the bacon.  No joke, this was not a plant.  Just click on the photo's and it's the third one in.",wvbTVyNLzpIWA7alkd4afg,2,0,1,DPcKFSCpVaz02HiNIE5Xtg

2433237,2015-12-07,1,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"Outdated hotel but somewhat cozy. Restaurant ambience is warm too... however the customer service is not.
Took 10 minutes for someone to comeout to ask if we would like to dine. Nobody was waiting at the front desk. So from the time the server came it took another 20-30 minutes to take us to our table. Which we couldn't understand coz the place isn't full at all. We can see at least 6 tables that can accommodate a family of 4 that are clear and empty.
Since we noticed the very slow service we decided to skip appetizers and order our meal same time as our drinks. We told the server that we are already starving so we'll go straight to ordering.... he interrupted us and said he'll have to get our drinks first before he can take the rest of our orders... really?!?!?!
Our food was served another 15 minutes later. And unfortunately we were given one wrong order so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get it corrected :( sigh... the view was amazing the service was just soooo bad.
The food was okay, nothing spectacular.

There is no hostess, the wait staff will seat you, that is, if they come out of the kitchen, where they seem to hide.  The food is ok, nothing special, however, the prices are way too high for what you get.  For dinner, an entrée is served with nothing else, no bread, soup or salad.

2927297,2012-01-15,2,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"I understand this is a ""steakhouse"" and all, but seriously, 5 DOLLARS for a cup of coffee!?

I came here with a friend for brunch with a Restaurant.Com certificate. The place is pretty small and quaint, but in need of a makeover. There was a lot of mismatching paint all over the walls including a spot where they obviously moved a light from one side of the wall to another (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bF1efunae8VjyZiWaAjYag/l.jpg). We weren't sure if we were at the right place at firstbecause we couldn't find a sign saying ""A Cut Above Steakhouse,"" so we just asked one of the servers before we were seated.

At first, everything was pleasant. We got our menus, got some water, then got our orders taken. We ordered the Mountain Meat Stew ($9.95) to share, I ordered a cup of coffee ($5) and the Chicken Pot Pie ($13.95), and my friend ordered Fried Chicken ($13.95). All of the food and drinks came out pretty quickly. My coffee must've overflown a whole bunch before it was given to me, as the cup had a whole bunch of spill marks all over it that they didn't bother to clean up (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vDBNUcePvXvEn6WC5-Hk_A/l.jpg). My Chicken ""pot pie"" wasn't much of a chicken pot pie at all (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uOIa1leCpYjtpxAaAU-19A/l.jpg), but I guess I should've read that in the description: chicken in a creamy sauce with Pancetta, peas and carrots topped with a puff pastry. I just read ""chicken pot pie"" and wanted that immediately. I think the only thing I really enjoyed about it was the puff pastry because the rest of it just tasted like a boring soup. The Meat Stew was alright, but I'm not much of a stew fanatic to grade it any higher or lower. 

We were about halfway through our meals when the waitress came up and just handed us our check. Before she did that, I saw her go to at least two other tables asking them if they were ready for some dessert, but she failed to ask us. We wanted to get the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, so we waited for her to come back, and while doing so, I took a look at the bill and noticed she charge us for a ""Large Juice,"" which none of us had (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uHIWvPGI0_FadlaLj1xjGQ/l.jpg). When she came over, we told her we didn't order that and she told us, ""Oh, it's the same price as the coffee, so I just marked Large Juice."" Okay...how is a CUP OF COFFEE the same thing as a LARGE JUICE?! I can understand a small juice, but a LARGE cup of juice being the same price as a cup of coffee? That just doesn't make sense to me. I understand it's free refills, but still. My cup of coffee was sitting nearly empty (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/up2XVgZFLwedqMB4I2VHBw/l.jpg) in the coffee stained cup from the time we got our food until halfway through our dessert because she never offered a refill (I didn't want to ask for fear of having to pay another $5) until we we sent the check back. When she did ask me if I wanted a refill (when we ordered dessert), she didn't give it to me until we were halfway done with the cheesecake. It was pretty annoying watching her walk around asking other guests how they were doing when she was suppose to be getting me a refill.

I just don't think I'll ever come back here again. The people that work here seem to cater to their regulars and the price of their food and COFFEE do not match the ambiance.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,4,0,1,fIKFXG3RWUqspwpBUV1WSA
3096159,2017-01-02,0,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"Are negative stars an option? This is hands down the worst place I've ever eaten at. I've never actually wanted to get up from my table and leave so bad in my life. 

Place is extremely dirty to begin with...However, we were hungry so we stayed and waited and waited. They were very understaffed which could've been because it's New Year's Day or because it's on a mountain, but still not a good excuse. At least 10 tables were open for about 20 mins before anyone was sat and the hostess was telling everyone it would be at least a half hour wait (much longer than that). 

Once we were sat the server didn't come over for at least 10-15 mins. We asked for 2 drinks and waters. Waters took 30 mins!! We had to ask 3 different people for waters before someone finally brought them. We also asked what their soup of the day was and what meats and cheese are in the appetizer special. After waiting for 30 mins I was ready to leave so my husband walked to the kitchen to ask for our check and the server said ""Oh, I have the meat and cheese platter for you."" We decided to stay because I thought this was an apology for horrible service. It wasn't, she thought I ordered it. 

We ordered our food and continued to wait. There were children running around the restaurant screaming. I took a video. Everyone in the restaurant looked perturbed to say the least. 

Now the food. I ordered lobster Mac and cheese (awful and clearly had been sitting for awhile), asparagus (5 pieces flavored well), and truffle sprouts (very pretty and tasted between ok and good, but not great). My husband had the chicken pot pie (tasted like it came from a Campbell's can soup) and by this point  my husband was over it. We asked for the manager (took 10 mins for him to come over). We told him how awful our experience was and specifically how unacceptable it was to have children ruining everyone's dining experience. His answer was that he was sorry the for the poor dining and that he can't tell people that their kids needed to be seated. Then, he asked if we needed anything else, um no just the check! He did comp 50% of our meal, thank you, but we definitely won't be back again.",jrgfWasVL5LAg_OpCUXzlA,2,0,1,TMOjrNzTc2_8sqkO_e3bzA

3743466,2007-08-13,1,hwJdv1tttvynXo2LZjJ6rg,"Ate here last night while staying in a cabin on the Mountain. Its in the Mount. Charleston Hotel. The menu was pretty simple, but reasonably priced for being the only real place to eat on the mountain. Steaks, chicken, and some pretty good appetizers. The french onion soup was pretty good too. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but decorated pretty nice. flowers on the tables, and multiple fireplaces, Enya playing in the background.... Most of the tables are situated by the windows, so almost every table has a great view of the surrounding mountains. I took off a star because the candle on our table wasnt lit, and they never brought us the bread they said they would, and another because my steak was a little charred on the outside, but at least it was still medium rare on the inside, like I ordered it. They did serve it with A-1 sauce? Which I personally dont think any steak house that takes itself seriously should ever do. The wine list was simple but good, with alot of wines by the glass. Overall, it was a decent place for a dinner while on the mountain, and even though there are better places a 45 minute drive away in the city, I'd recommend it for the view and the ambiance. And if your so inclined, you can get a room there too for a pretty reasonable price, and not have to worry about the drive home.",p6_VRzQMYM-JTTpsdBFOeA,3,2,3,xgvezVypffgZldYkRVgVwQ

Not to mention our order was not even correct and Grandma asked for Rolls with her salad and they were FROZEN. That just made us laugh.

It wasn't busy when we were there so we pretty much had the restaurant to ourselves.  Though this place needs a paint job, I still give it 4 stars after having a horrible dining experience at The Lodge further up the hill.

For lunch, I had a buffalo meat burger and french fries.  I decided to try something different from what I had on my first visit here.  I've never had buffalo before but my burger came out nice and I love their fries.  Our group ordered one of each dessert on the menu: carrot cake, bananas foster, chocolate cake, bread pudding, cheesecake and creme brûlée cheesecake to share.  Everything was swimming in whipped cream.  We had extra slices of cheesecake since our server said she couldn't get that perfect slice.  I particularly enjoyed the bread pudding. I liked our server.  She was quick, attentive and actually talked to us.

We had a few drinks at the bar last night.  I had a seasonal German brew (forgot what it was but it wasn't Lobotomy Bock) and peppermint schnapps.  We had one of the best bartenders in Vegas.  She made perfect drinks.  Two people from our group were raving about the Cosmopolitans they had.

For breakfast this morning, we had the place to ourselves again as we got there as soon as it opened at 7am. I got the Whole Mountain Skillet (3 scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, cheese and seasoned potatoes) with a side of sourdough bread.  It was huuuge but I finished it.

They have a giant wood center beam from a big old tree. I like the old look. The views from all the windows seem nice. We were a bigger party so we weren't by the window though we could still see somewhat out of them.

Now for the food I had the Belgian Waffles Breakfast. It came with waffles, two eggs, potatoes and I chose sausage. The waffle was perfectly cooked. The eggs were scrambled just how I like. The potatoes were tasty though some were kind of burnt. The sausage was tasty as well.

For the service I have to say the staff was friendly. When we arrived it was already quite busy. The hostess was busy helping to clear tables and as she saw our group standing smiled finished clearing a table then came over apologizing. The two waitress were having to run all over the place. Luckily we already were reading the menus before sitting so we could order right of way which we did. I felt bad for them since it seemed they could use maybe one more person. We had to wait for refills on water but at least a waitress that wasn't ours came by and filled our waters up instead of leaving us waiting for our waitress.

I give 3 stars for good breakfast, excellent setting(you're in the mountains what's not to love!), and decent service.

I definitely want to go back during the winter and stay in a lodge with the snow and then eat there for dinner.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,1,0,3,uxg4m2Ky-xQDz5wHyahbyA

However they were all very friendly, which was at least nice despite the terrible dining experience.",QhKrd2NOxu_Zk8MTpEGo2w,2,0,1,5Uv7s7i1uBW0_y-gbPne8Q

Once blessed with her presence she was quite ignorant about the menu and drink selection. It took another twenty minutes to receive our drinks. Took so long that we left the restaurant walked around the outer most part of the hotel  and made out on bench and came back to still no drinks. Another half an hour later we received our food. 
Let me tell u how fantastic that was!! NOT!!!
My wife ordered the medium rare  filet with a blue cheese crust and mashed potato. She received a medium filet no blue cheese and a baked potato.  I order a ribeye and was shot down and was forced to order the ""horse"" ribs.  The toughest things ever! They then brought out a mound of cold blue cheese for their mistake  and not even offer to brûlée it.  The only thing worth eating was the mound of frozen bag fries.  
After sitting for another twenty minute after we had finished our food we were able to yell across the restaurant for our check. She took her time bringing it out to tell us, oh no! I forgot to put your last round of drinks on it and disappeared for another 10 minutes. I guess this place isn't meant to be know for it's marvelous cuisine, more for ""it's ambiance"".......
