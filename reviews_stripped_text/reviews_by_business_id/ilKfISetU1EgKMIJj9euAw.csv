Their Chashu is not fatty and their ramen combos are incredible.  I alternate between the Miso ramen with 1/2 order of pork fried rice and ramen with beef curry rice.  Ramen comes with spinach which is a nice addition.  Quality ingredients and great tasting food.

Service is always solid",u3yfRirFSQbfOZ3EdzIQPA,0,0,4,fUWdB_Qtrvc7HCVdUdnASQ

A++ on the soup base.

I came here with a group of friends for lunch and the place had a couple of other customers. I think they were Japanese so maybe that's a sign that this place is authentic? Looking through the menu, the beef curry caught my eye and I got that. The curry flavor was very bold however after I left the restaurant, I was very thirsty so maybe a little too much salt? I also got the chance to taste my friends' ramen broths and I was not impressed. The flavors were a little bland and definitely lacked depth. I also wished they offer tonkotsu ramen since that's my favorite. I might've ordered the wrong stuff but it seems like the ramen and the curry are the main dishes here.

1939602,2013-04-26,0,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"Okay there's a bunch of Ramen places suddenly sparking up in the valley so we're no longer limited to waiting around Monta for a seat to open up cursing that damn hipster that finished his bowl an hour ago and is checking his instagram. 

Anyway i have no idea how long this place has been open nor anything else about it. Just went here to meet up with a few buddies to grab a bite to eat before a meetup. 

Interior decor is quite nice that there was enough to build up a vibe like you're in somewhat of a larger ramen house commonly found anywhere and everywhere in japan cept it's on the larger side. 

Anyway ordered the Chicken shoyu ramen just because it seemed interesting. Really wanted to Popeye Ramen but wasnt willing to pay that price. I've never seen chicken in ramen before it's usually pork but some broths have chicken in it for sweetness but again i've just never seen ramen that has actual slices of chicken in it.

Bowl arrived and what was presented met my expectations. Only thing i slightly disapproved of was the chicken meat itself. Slices of white breast meat that's been boiled. Sure it was tender and all but didnt have no flavor. This could go both ways because i know some like that in their chicken but when it came to boiled chicken i've always has stewing hens. Coming from a Vietnamese background we have many chicken dishes and usually the birds are stewing hens which are a lot tougher then standard run of the mill chicken. The meat is tougher and holds up to boiling so there's still texture and a little flavor after it's been boiled for a while. That's what i was expecting so hopefully that explains why the low score and why i'm umimpressed with their chicken. 

The broth i have nothing to compare it against since i dont usually order Shoyu. It had a nice soy sauce flavor obviously since that's what it's based on. 

Overall i'm up in the air about this place. Sora is still my go to place for ramen and the reason we came here was because it was down the street from our meetup location so not exactly sure when/if i'll come back to try something else and do a followup review.

Not that I could ever complain because I do love good bowl of ramen. =) I decided too try the newest spot the other day for lunch. One of the first things I notice walked it really liked the decor with all the dark black color wood, and the bar area that perfect for single guest. Unlike most of the other Ramen spots around town feel like this one might be the biggest one. It tucked in the corner behind Starbucks off of valley view and spring mountain. So chance you might miss this little gem driving around. Just look for Starbucks.

The food was surprised that not only serve ramen besides normal sides of gyoza and so forth. They also serve fried noodle dishes, different kinds of japanese curries, and just nice diversity too the menu. I love that fact! Plus they offer combo just in case thinking ramen and curry. This occasion feeling more in curry mood so got the beef curry with side order six pieces too order gyoza. I like the presentation really simple scoop of rice with the beef curry also little pickled daikon on the side. The curry not many places that I found serve it Hawaii style or japanese based curry. Kaba Curry my go too place for curry action. Korakiu just might have taking over the title for best curry action in Vegas. The only thing felt was missing was more vegetables in the curry or come think of it just beef in it. I enjoy the flavor of the curry could have it with any of the proteins they have too offer and loving life. The gyoza was perfect too! I enjoyed the filling and on point.

The pricing is very reasonable like most Ramen places around town. Not sure long the wait can be when its busy. If line too long the beauty of this location is have so many more options up the road. The server was nice, friendly, and did wonderful job. I not tried the Ramen but trust me I willllll. The greatest thing about Koraku Ramen is fact can get too of my fixes same spot Ramen and Curry!!

2301425,2013-06-30,0,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"Went here with my sister the other day and was a tad bit disappointed. We just decided to stop by because we were going to go to Kuma Snow (located next door) and we wanted to try the ramen and see how it fared against the competition. The inside of the restaurant was just a little bit more spacious than Monta ramen (2 tables, 4 boothes and a bar) and they had a lot more items on their menu. There were more variations of ramen here and a cuople more appetizers to choose from which was cool to see. My sister got the Shouyo ramen and 1/2 fried rice combo and I got the Hot Volcano ramen (w/ corn, butter and tamago). The ramen looked quite nice but it just tasted okay. Now I'm not saying that my ramen was bad by any means but it was just simply alright. I know the volcano ramen said that it had veggies in it but half of my bowl was veggies (intead of noodles). The broth was alright. It tasted a bit like a spicy shouyo broth. The noodles weren't bad either, I felt that they were kind of short but otherwise they tasted okay. The service was fast and the waitress was very nice and informative. 

But will I be returning any time soon? No. To be honest there is nothing about this place that makes me want to choose it over Sora ramen or Monta ramen (both establishments just a couple of blocks up the street from this one). They are going to have to step up their game just a bit because I'm sure that every other person that comes here will compare them to the other great ramen places in town.",eCwl6zWjwj3ypgPbjom6gw,2,1,3,OhPlHO7DUy2Gb4qzdr5jhA

Our friends ate here, and told us it was horrible. My boyfriend wanted to try, so what the heck, let's not be biased & try it out right? Well, I am greatly regretting it.

We ordered korokke to start, which tasted like they just took flour, cooked it, and then served it to us. Worst korokke in my life, which I'm sad about because I love korokke. :(

Next, my boyfriend ordered the Miso Ramen, while I ordered Shoyu Ramen. His Miso Ramen smelled funny, and I thought maybe it's okay, taste it first. So, he tried it, said it tasted sour & weird, then I tried it afterward. He was correct, it tasted nothing like Miso Ramen, it tasted as weird as it smelled. My boyfriend and I hate to complain at restaurants, but his food was not even edible, so we let them know & he had it switched to Shoyu. When his Shoyu came, he tried it & told me his soup spoon smelled funny. He handed it to me & I knew the smell, being a former server at another restaurant. It reeked of bleach, not the amount that you should use for sanitizing, greater than that. As if they poured an entire cup of bleach & just gave it to us. I gave my boyfriend my soup spoon instead, since I didn't really need it.

My Shoyu Ramen, on the other hand, tasted OK.. There was something about it that tasted weird, but I couldn't figure it out. Not the best Shoyu, and it's usually my favorite. The noodles were aldente on the inside, but gooey/slimy on the outside. From two to three bites, I got really sick for some reason.. So I stopped eating, took it to-go, then tossed it when I got home. :/

My boyfriend also got really sick, so our friends were right about this place. I don't want anyone else getting sick; one of my friends wants to try it as well, even after our warning. Something has to be done, either figure out what you're doing wrong & fix it, or just close the place down.",4d7PvOD51AdvX4Wr1xB-5Q,4,0,1,B48-UeFr8H_tF3rdm_QR3g

I ordered the spicy house ramen with extra chashu for $12.95.  The broth was what I tasted first.  It was a bland chicken based broth of some sort with a bit of spice added to it.  The good thing about this ramen was that it was packed full of stuff like little pieces of pork, bok choy, a few pieces of squid, a couple small shrimp, etc.  Overall the ramen wasn't offensive in any way, but it also was pretty much average tasting.  Not a lot of flavor or complexity in this stuff.  I would say to stay away from the squid as it was rather rubbery.  The chashu was also not worth paying extra for as it was dry and plain tasting.  

Overall I am not sure how this place is going to fare against the two really good ramen places in this area.  It is even a little more expensive than those better places, and the service was considerably slower.  I definitely won't be returning when those other guys are right down the street.

4054750,2013-06-23,5,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"Another Ramen house in Vegas and I'm sorry to say, I wasn't too impressed with the ramen.  I didn't have ramen as my main meal, but tried some of Terri R's.  Maybe I don't know what a good bowl of ramen is.  Maybe I'm just too loyal to Sora and Monta.  But one thing that disappointed me about Koraku's ramen is that it was lacking that silky and creamy taste.  Actually, it was lacking flavor all together. This is just my opinion.  Other people may like ramen with almost no taste.  But all wasn't lost on my visit here.  My main meal was their Ground Beef Steak and a side of their Mini Menchi Katsu.  I felt both were pretty good.  

Ground Beef Steak:  This was served with Hayashi sauce. This was pretty much a Loco Moco minus the eggs, but you can get eggs with this.  The sauce was made the way it's suppose to be (i.e. thick, somewhat tangy, and all over the place). I'm not huge fan of this and end up brushing a lot of the sauce to the side. Other than that, I thought my meal was filling and flavorful.  This had more of a Salisbury steak taste to it than a ground beef taste, in my opinion. 

Mini Menchi Katsu:  This was basically two mini hamburger patties that's breaded and deep fried.  Think of the texture and initial taste of a chicken katsu, but with a ground beef taste to.  Wasn't bad at all, just bad for you.  

The restaurant wasn't too busy and the service was great.  We had a lot of food, but again, I wasn't too impressed with their ramen.  But I could still see myself coming back for the other food on their menu.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,6,3,JbehYbR-14Et7iHbW1wx2w

Koraku reminds me of those ""okonomi shokudo""s that are quite out of style in Japan.  They serve all kinds of food, from curry to tempura to tonkatsu to ramen, and none of them as well as a specialty restaurant that sticks to one genre of food.

5659612,2013-05-01,1,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"The tofu appetizer was pretty plain but still delicious if not for the fact that it's tofu that you can dress up with cucumber and various little toppings like green onion. Tofu from the pack is not that cheap either so this appetizer (which I believe is half a pack) was quite worth the price.

If I had been the one to order the Volcano Ramen, I would probably give Koraku a 3/5. The haphazardly thrown in vegetables just seemed so unappealing. I guess I had gotten used to eating ramen that only had the basics like nori and chashu. However, my best friend in middle school was Japanese and her mom would make ramen with the same haphazardly thrown in vegetables so that was a nostalgic twist. 

It wasn't the vegetables that did me in, though. It was the broth. The spicy level of the Volcano Ramen was okay but it was just the type of spice that weirded me out. It tasted like it didn't belong in ramen but would rather be in some type of curry dish. 

Why 4/5 stars then? The miso ramen! Whenever I try a new ramen place I always go with miso the first time I'm there. Now, I am a die-hard Monta fan but I think Koraku's miso ramen suits my taste just as well. It might not be as decadent and rich as Monta's but that is also where it shines. The chashu isn't as fatty but it still maintains its richness and texture. The broth was very yummy and not too heavy and the noodles were cooked just how a like it (okay maybe a tad too soft, but I always preferred firm noodles anyway).

Our waiter seemed somewhat shy or reluctant to be serving us though, as if he was forced into this job. Maybe he's just new? 

On another note, the ice water here tasted really good and not like cheap tap. +1 for you, Koraku. I'd definitely come again for the miso.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,1,1,4,dWOVJCBoox3lAgdALP-UWg
5913308,2013-11-26,0,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"I've bookmarked this location knowing they serve Tenshin and Mabo Tofu. On my way home I decided to stop by and give it a try since I've been wanting to try a different ramen location that my usuals. 
I ordered the Moyashi (bean sprout) Itame Ramen without the pork due to being pesceterian and won't consume meat. Also ordered a half Chahan (fried rice) on the side. It seemed quite busy when I walked in even one hour after their open so despite the negative reviews I have read, I was pretty excited. 
To start with, I felt the mountain of Moyashi was a bit over seasoned which ended up making the soup taste the same so I didn't get to really taste the soup itself. However the noodles were the wavy chewy type which I definitely enjoyed. 
The fried rice; which I also got without pork, wasn't bad but wasn't too impressed by it either. A bit oily where I couldn't finish neither bowls. 
I was desperately craving ramen and this place definitely filled me up but not sure if I will be having the Moyashi ramen next time. I definitely need to try the Tenshin and Mabo next time!!! Service was good, so for that I'll give it 3 stars. I'll be dining in again.",AsqGY-mvNg4KEyIEtjkQow,0,0,3,NOMAG6uWFEZVYIStU18hnA
5918770,2013-04-11,13,ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw,"Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little ""We're Open"" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,23,14,4,Cnpdb-7HjiSt6f4Gr5BF_g
