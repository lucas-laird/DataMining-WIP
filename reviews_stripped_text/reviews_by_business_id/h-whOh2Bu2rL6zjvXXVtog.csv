195935,2016-01-26,0,h-whOh2Bu2rL6zjvXXVtog,Sorry I have to update my review after last night .  I came here a little late last night about 8:30pm which is right before closing.  I understand the cook might be a little irritated but don't sit in the booths upfront and look annoyed when you are at work and actually have to get up and DO SOMETHING.  I ordered two bean and cheese burritos the cashier was short and rude.  I got home and got halfway through my burrito when I took a bite and pulled out a chili stem!!!! Ewwww. It looked like the cook took a bite abd threw it right in my burrito!!! I was soooooo mad and disgusted. Immediately lost my appetite and went back and received my refund.  Needless to say I'm sorry I WILL NOT BE BACK...,0BfLpKuexmgW54OuQ75Mlg,0,0,1,busz7IyIzhhTZW89HUBG3Q

The sauce was so good it wasn't to spicy but it had that Mexican home made touch that's rare to find. I got one taco al pastor and some Spicy shrimp and the shrimps were so juicy and big. The lady at front was so nice and sweet I asked her which sauce was spicer and she answered and was so polite doing so. I will definitely come again .,msPmOG7Bcr5nTIgGZQlzCQ,1,1,5,wjCc1w-qRQd1-DnLtWr0Xg

1097178,2018-04-17,0,h-whOh2Bu2rL6zjvXXVtog,Horrible service. I walked in no greeting and no one else in line. Hispanic guy walk in right behind me and and the girl behind the counter speaks to him and just starts helping him and fixing an order for him without saying a word to me. And looked me dead in my face and still didn't say a word so I left out. Will not support this place. Appeared to me racists towards blacks as I am an African American. You've been warned. I wouldn't support this place if I was use. Plenty of other taco spots. Wish I could leave -10 star,WQEeiSz_d7aX0ci4RkwA_w,0,0,1,Gt96grQOoGrj6O1-ZPbt7w

We pulled into the strip mall, caught sight of the neighboring Taco Bell, and agreed that would suffice should we not find anything else.

Well, we found Tacos Los Toritos, and it beats Taco Bell any day. 

It's a lovely little shop with an extensive menu. I ordered the veggie burrito with chips and my Mimi the fish tacos and rice. We looOOOoooved the food. It was fresh, delicious, authentic--everything you want and need in a taco shop!

The staff were friendly and quick with getting the food out to us. We ended up getting a couple burritos to go for my aunt and cousin, which were met with joy and praise. 

So in short, skip Taco Bell. Go to Tacos Los Toritos.",qpuYp31W89tq6vaGY6wLVg,2,0,4,BEvOAMa0BW_fEXH1iDbbtw
3340756,2016-07-05,0,h-whOh2Bu2rL6zjvXXVtog,"Authentic Mexican food.  I offer come for the fish tacos but occasionally have one of their hearty soups. I choose either Pozole or Caldo de Res . And always have one of their large drinks of horchata or cantaloupe .
The food is always great and the service is friendly. The only drawback is slow service . It's mostly due to a small staff ..one counter person who has a lot to do.
But that shouldn't stop you from coming here. 
Reasonable prices, and plenty parking as it is next to Smiths groceries.

I called around 8am & whoever answered the phone didn't understand English because she thought I ordered 2 Large Pozoles. I didn't I asked her if she had Pazole & if they were open she said ""maybe in 20 minutes"" and she asked if I wanted Pazole & what size. 
So I figured they were going to get started & prepare it fresh, when we got there the Pazole was already bagged to go but I didn't ask for it to go I wanted to eat there so we finally sat asked for 2 bowls & had to pour the hot soup into the bowls.
I was so dissapointed because for the price we paid for the soup it was so watery & instead of meat we mostly got bones & fat! I was upset but I ate because I didn't wanna waste the food 
Oh they give you lettuce instead of cabagge for your Pazole which I thought was odd....epic fail we won't be going back ever again",hMWX2HUTPcP7a-aFBbv-bg,0,0,2,ww4gb3u9yVvbBpoqXYWFqw

4826409,2015-02-18,1,h-whOh2Bu2rL6zjvXXVtog,"When reviewing an eatery, I always consider the overall value.  At $1.50 a taco (carne asada and al pastor), I've gotta say I've had way better for less cost.

The carne asada lacked any unique flavor.  It merely tastes like meat.  I would have appreciated a slight lime or chile flavoring of sort.  Heck, I'd take a salty peppery taste (the easiest to achieve without messing up the taco).  

The al pastor had a nice sweetness to contrast the slight spiciness; however, the meat and the onion and pineapple mixture had all turned to mush.  The taco lacked the basic ""meat"" texture a taco needs to make it feel like you're eating a taco.

I also ordered a fish taco ($2.00) which was alright.  It wasn't battered and deep fried (Baja style) but grilled instead.  The fish flavor was present, but, much like the carne asada, there was no real seasoning to set this taco apart from any ol' taco place.

The tacos were standard street size (fit in the palm of your hand, double tortilla). 

The place was really clean.  The green and red salsa were GREAT with the complimentary chips I received.  

Overall, this place isn't terrible or anything.  It's just nothing to rave about.  If you're looking to get your taco fix, you can get it here (I just can't justify paying more than $1.00-1.25 per taco....yes, 25 cents makes a BIG difference, especially when ordering for a family).",bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g,0,0,3,c2MwKcTGrlqHRyDKqoILPQ

5116438,2011-08-22,1,h-whOh2Bu2rL6zjvXXVtog,"Big surprise here. We ducked in here on a whim and are very glad we did. First off, knowing I'd be yelping about this place I took an exterior photo of Tacos Los Toritos. As I was snapping the shot, some guys were just starting to walk out. Going for the laugh, one dude struck a pose, for the shot. We all got a real good laugh out of that. It made for a good first impression, happy, goofy customers. Loved it. Inside the place is bright and cheery, nothing fancy, but welcoming and sprinkled with art reflecting the old country. They make a nice array of fruit drinks (large $2.25), made with a base of freshly squeezed fruit-orange, watermelon, and my favorite...cantaloupe--I loved the cantaloupe. They also serve up ho-made horchata too. Free samples? No problem. For some reason fish was sounding good. I order up a ceviche tostada ($2.99). It was loaded with fish (tilapia?) and burst with a rockin' spicy, citrusy, flavor. The gal behind the counter was very helpful and mentioned the fish tacos ($1.50) as being popular. They create their own breading mix there, and the tacos came out with a delightfully light crispy crust, served with lettuce and tomato on small double wrapped corn tortillas. I prefer cabbage, but didn't miss it at all with these bad boys. Chille Relleno with rice and beans ($7.40)...also delish. A decent condiment stand tops it all off with a couple of salsas, limes, radishes, and a nice surprise of spicy hot roasted serrano chili peppers and onions. We were there during the non peak time of about 1:30 on a Sunday. They had a steady stream of customers the entire time, which is a good sign. The cutie behind the counter mentioned they have coupons on the back of the receipt next door at Smith's. So, Smith shoppers, check those receipts and swing on in for some pretty fine Mexican chow on the cheap. Thanks to the ethnic composition of this area, there are several really good choices when you're ready to get your Mexican on, Tacos Los Toritos is right up there.
