I happen upon Mad Matty's Bar and Grille next door and decided to try it out (love their witty comments on their LED scrolling sign such as ""oh cool, a bus lane! note: this was during the bus lane construction on Sahara and later ""wasn't construction over weeks ago"" -about the delay in completion).
Anyway, the place is dim and full of video poker and slots just like any other casino-bar, but as soon as i walk in i'm greeted with a warm welcome by the bartenders.  Both of them were really friendly and we even shared a few laughs while i ordered.  I got the mad matty's burger (typical bar food) but not so typical burger! for about the same price as Wendys next door, i Got a huge 1/2 lb burger with cheese, fries and ranch!

A chill place with a good burger! So if you're looking for a good burger fix in the area, opt out of typical fast food and grab one at Mad Matty's.  You'll also get better service and friendly bartenders! Sit back, sip a few beers, and good luck hitting that royal flush playing deuces wild!",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,3,0,4,L4zpwF-QBjqJEZ6sLeWQTw

why anyone would wanna come to your bar is besides me!  You have the absolute worst service from any bartender I've ever been to at any bar not only in this time but anywhere in the United States.

2045494,2015-03-15,0,rhYZCUiywRknWKieJ75zug,"Since the management change, there has been a major change in the menu. As others have mentioned, no more prime rib special. Also no more chicken-fried steak; and fewer Mexican dishes. However, the burgers are still terrific.
One positive change is that appetizers and flatbreads--along with draft beer--are half price until 7 p.m. So you can come here and get a casual dinner and drink for a really good price. [They also have a half-price breakfast deal, right at breakfast time, so that's nice to know.]
However, I'm downgrading them a star because since the mgt. change, they've closed their non-smoking section off. Now we have to eat in the regular, very smoky bar section. Being a non-smoker, I really don't want to do that; and will probably not be coming here as much; unless I find out they've re-opened their nice dining section.",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,3,0,4,IMkWUmLFxhvOHSwzjYPduw

Over the years the original bartenders and staff have moved on and things have changed in terms of the interior and service quality. 5 stars for our originals, Stan, Sheila, Big John (R.I.P.), Art, Eddie, Erin and Dina.  

Their original menu never disappointed and you'd be hard-pressed to find anything less than good back in the day (5 stars there). Apparently management has decided to downsize the menu and do away with almost 90% of the items which has regulars less than satisfied. 

As of January 1st, management has decided to shut down the dining area and renovate in hopes that they can appeal to a younger crowd with more of a lounge feel near the fireplace. Have to keep up with the times I guess. I get that. Fingers crossed things go well. 

At the end of the day, let's see how the place goes after the renovations have been completed as it's too early to tell what the outcome will be.

3602192,2011-06-02,1,rhYZCUiywRknWKieJ75zug,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have a review yet. It is considered a ""casino"" with video poker and various slot machines that I haven't touched (I'm not a gambler), with restaurant seating and bar. Every time I've been in here so far (3x), I've never seen the restaurant side open. The place is 24 hours, and the best part is that their full menu is available 24 hours as well. I noticed a lot of places will close their kitchen during the later hours of the night, and that's no good for people like me who get the munchies after a fun night out. 

It's a very mellow place and so far it looks like only locals come in, so don't expect speedy service. It's good service...but more like 'lax service. Plus they usually only have 1 or 2 guys running the entire place. The food comes out pretty fast after you order, but this is the kind of place that won't give you the check unless you ask for it. One time, I finished my meal and just sat and watched TV/played on my phone/chilled for a good thirty minutes before I finally told one of the bartenders I would like to pay. 

The food is great too. There is a bunch of items I haven't tried yet but what I have tried has been very good (the potato cheddar soup, bbq ribs, cheesecake a la mode, and few appetizers). I love fries, and theirs are perfect: crisp, hot, and well-seasoned. They have a full menu including breakfast which I am determined to go back and try one of these days.

We ended up ordering quite a few delicious things that were all filling for super cheap. For an appetizer, we got nachos with the chicken on the side. It was a huge portion for only a few dollars. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sliders (they come with fries) and I ordered a Mediterranean pizza with no olives.

The pizza was a perfect portion and my boyfriend liked the sliders quite a bit. The fries were PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. I could order those by the bucket. They were crispy on the outside but not too crispy on the inside. Perfect taste!

Our first indicator that we should be worried was that at NOON on the Friday we gave them a try there was but a single other car in the parking lot - NOT usually a good thing. On the entry doors was a big sign advertising their ""Prime Rib Special"" for $9.99.  Inside was as dark as a bar usually is but well decorated with more than a dozen 4-person tables in a separate dining area. We were greeted by the sole waitress/hostess who was serving the only other customers and we were told to pick a table. We didn't see a bartender at any time while we were there. Our waitress (ADEL) brought us menus and took our drink order. When she came back I asked whether she recommended the Prime Rib Special and she said that it was great but that they also had a shrimp special that day too. As I love prime rib and trusting her very positive endorsement I ordered the 'double-cut' for $14.99 and my friend got a French Dip sandwich. When I asked for the baked potato offered as one of my sides Adel said that they were ""pre-baked and would be microwaved to heat it up"" but would still be very good! I'll cut to the chase here - I asked for rare to medium-rare and I got a piece of grisly pan seared meat that was truly tough to even cut with the knife. Under the 'main' piece of meat which was medium to well done was a much smaller piece of seared meat that was well done - I guess it was supposed to be my 'double cut' serving! Only once in my 60 years have I sent a piece of meat back but even my friend tried the meat and agreed that it was not edible!  We called our waitress and she took a look, apologized, and said she would get me another piece of meat. I said that if it was also going to be pan fried I would rather just get a burger instead. Sandwich prices are high and as stated my
special was anything but special! Even though our server was a truly nice lady I would never go back here even with a Groupon. It was a BAD experience.

Happy hour here is from 3pm-7pm, and it's half off ALL alcohol and appetizers. Let me say that again, HALF OFF ALL ALCOHOL. Pretty unbeatable for drink specials. 

The food is another story. We ordered mac n cheese balls, flat breads, fried calamari, and nachos.

Mac n cheese balls
These aren't what you're thinking. They are two giant balls of lightly fried mac n cheese covered in marinara sauce. The marinara sauce was super overpowering to some really mediocre mac n cheese.

Fried calamari
Such a shame. Very very very overcooked. Barely any breading on it. It was super tough to eat and very rubbery. I finished it only because I hate wasting the life of any animal that has found its way to my plate.

Flatbreads
Not great. Crust was burnt in places. Ordinary marinara sauce and giant blobs of mozzarella. 

Nachos
Exactly how you could make them at home. 

The food was incredibly disappointing and took a long time as well. You can get much better at Steiners, Rounders, or similar. I hate to write a bad review, but I have to be honest about the quality here.
