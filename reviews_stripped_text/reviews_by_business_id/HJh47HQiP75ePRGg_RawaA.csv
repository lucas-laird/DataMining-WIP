Girl that was working there was tryin to be funny but nah not funny to me.  Somewhat rude.  She was all like ""oh that's my first time making the maki sushi pretty good right?"" I was like ""yea u did a good job"". Then she goes ""oh u believed me that's not my first one"" then giggled.  Then when I went to pay she ask where I was from I told her then she said ""oh I'm from Waipahu"" then I was like ""oh really?""  Then she said again ""oh u believed me again"" lol whatever girl this the first time I met you and joking around with me like that?

But ANYWAYS the only good thing I got was the chili frank.  REALLY just that.  The mac salad, pork hash and tuna maki was really bad.  Manapua was alright I guess.  Don't think I'll be back.",TxY4aE_qndZvhl43N4sZTw,3,1,2,5DxyHFCGzhEnEMUTKbkAqw

Simply comparing this place to other ono options in Vegas, I was a bit underwhelmed. I didn't realize that this concept is a grab-and-go with bentos premade in a warmer, which affected the texture and moisture in every item, and not for the better. Perhaps returning for fresh-made options or breakfast dishes would yield a more positive experience.

The 702 Bento has chicken teriyaki, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, Redondo hot dog, and a fish cake served on furikake rice. The teri sauce is thin and didn't have much flavor while the fried chicken was soggy. I was most disappointed in the shrimp, which tasted spoiled- heat plus seafood plus an indeterminate amount of time is not a fun formula to play around with. The casual ambiance and hole in the wall location make this place feel like it has the potential to be a ""hidden gem"", but I'll wait to revisit when they work out some of the execution issues.

Love supporting these family owned business! They only have 3 tables (6 seater,4 seater, and 2 seater) so be aware if your trying to come down with some family and friends that the seating is limited. Be ready to take to go because I can see this place getting busy. 

This place has the making of a hole in the wall restaurant that I would categorize as a hidden gem! The location is tucked away near the airport and if you don't pay attention you could miss the spot. It looks like an apartment area so keep your eye up! But once you find it your tummy will be so happy!

The food here is O'no licious!!! I had the chili and frank with side fried chicken! I felt like I was home! The hot dog was Redondo and only people from Hawaii would understand how awesome it is to use that as the Frank! To be honest I had a little nostalgic feeling of Zippy's chili and fried chicken combo when eating my dish. My son had the Korean chicken and that was outstanding! My wife had the roast pork and she absolutely loved it! 

I was pretty sad that I wasn't able to try the Okazuya menu! I'm definitely going back early to make sure I create my own bento! They said they usually stop the Okazuya around 1pm so plan ahead if you want to try it. It looked like they had a large menu for the Okazuya so super stoked to try it in the future!

Only downfall today was a few of the items were sold out so I wasn't able to try the pork hash or shave ice. Next time I guess!

The prices are fair but as you add all the delicious side items it can get up in price. Be warned they don't have fountain drinks and all drinks are from cans. They do carry Hawaiian sun products so I was glad to gulp down an orange passion! 

Staff was very nice! They had the aloha spirit in all of them and treated us like family! That's how it's suppose to feel! Loved this staff!

2463441,2017-06-23,0,HJh47HQiP75ePRGg_RawaA,"Just went to try this okazuya for the first time...

I got the Rise and Shine bento, a small order of chow fun, and a spam musubi. $15 to try something new.

I've lived in Las Vegas long enough to remember when there was an okazuya on Rainbow and Westcliff and I've always felt the 9th Island needed one again since that one closed. I read a few of the other reviews, and I believe the portion size is actually a little small for what you get. The spam musubi had a thinner than normal spam slice but the taste was what you'd expect. The chow fun was good, and the bento was pretty solidly packed although it was in a kinda small container.

I guess if you're hungry for early morning local food, this is a good go-to spot. $2 for a musubi and $3 for a spam musubi make me cringe a little though... I know, okazuyas are always a little more expensive, but when I can wait an hour or two and get a chicken katsu plate at a plate lunch place (with bigger portions) for a dollar more than a breakfast bento here... *sigh*",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,7,1,3,21b5x2rFktJxoGdxce6Yzg
2577709,2017-07-02,0,HJh47HQiP75ePRGg_RawaA,"After hearing that a new local Hawaiian place opened up, I had to try it out. I wanted to like this place (from the mostly positive reviews and pics on yelp) but I gotta say I was disappointed. 

For starters, I was excited to see they had butterfish on the menu (I haven't seen any other local restaurant in Vegas offering it). Knowing that they just opened recently, I called beforehand and asked if it was available, I was told yes. Took a half hour drive down there (right after calling) only to be told they sold out early that morning. 
Uh okay, guess the cooks forgot to tell their cashier they where sold out. I was bummed but no problem, as there where other things I wanted to try. 

As luck would have it, everything I wanted to try they where out of, or had only couple pieces or a spoonful left of. I was kind of puzzled about that, being it was only 11:30-noon time. Wasn't sure if they where gonna make more since it was lunchtime (figured they would have fresh stuff made to be ready for the lunch rush). They didn't say but instead, I was told to come early in the morning next time (for lunch?) and was offered other things that I wasn't interested in trying. 

As I'm looking in the window at the food, I have to say it looked old, dry and over-cooked (set up okazuya style-what you'd find back home in Chinatown, the manapua man, and Mom & Pop local restaurants-that are always so ono and tasty). Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with their set-up (food sitting under a warmer/heat lamp for a significant amount of time will dry food out quick).

Ended up ordering the Korean chicken wing plate and it was pretty decent, sauce was a little salty, but the chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy in the inside. The mac salad had a weird taste to it. At first I thought they used some weird mayonnaise like miracle whip or something. I don't know what it was, but it just tasted off.

I also took the last 2 pork hash they had left and it was old. Not bad tasting but old as in, when you know something has been cooked awhile ago and has been sitting out. Tried the last of the chow-fun and it was bad! Old, dry, bland, just not fresh. I'll chalk that up to being the last scoops out of the container is most likely why (what I got looked no where near like the pics others posted on yelp). Also got the ume/fudukaki musubi. It was okay, what you would expect musubi to taste like. Rice wasn't dried out or anything, but honestly, it's not that hard to make musubi and even harder to screw it up where it taste bad. 

Now for the worse part. Being local, that's a given to want to try out a new local establishment's poke'. From the pics. posted on yelp I was excited, it looked fresh and ono. 
Bummed that they where out of spicy tuna but still had regular poke'. I should've known better than to buy it, when it was sitting in a shallow tub on top of the counter in already melting ice. I went against my better judgment (as poke' should always be stored in a refrigerator type setting).
When I opened the container, the poke' was grey in color already and slimy. No way was I going to even touch that. 

I ended up throwing most of my food away and leaving.
Super bummed of my experience, when I was so hoping that I could've found a new favorite local place (especially one that has an okazuya set up). Unfortunately not the case.

They definitely have a few kinks they need to work out and hopefully in time they will (since they just opened). 
Not sure if they just had an off day when I went in (it was on a Sat) because what I got served, looked nothing like the pics. posted on yelp. 
But after getting poke' that was straight up rancid, I'll pass on this place for good.",fYubasho7eQ5yU9jfT5ZNw,9,0,2,uNWWOczXShoCl9Eh_MuWZw

First impression of my squid luau (this thing cook or what?) was afraid I was going get itchy throat.  So I dug into my squid luau.  I think they mixed some luau leaves and collard greens.

3215558,2018-02-20,2,HJh47HQiP75ePRGg_RawaA,"Pro Tip: The surrounding area is kind of sketchy, but no fear, go inside!!

Before I tried this place, I heard some mixed reviews.  Since I work pretty close to here, finally decided to give it a try.  Went in with 2 coworkers for lunch and we loved it!!  There are premade bentos and musubis (ume, spam, hot dog, and portuguese sausage) for those on the go that need to grab a quick meal.  Then there are all the different plate lunches available.  I didn't know where to begin.  I wanted to try 12 different items!!  And that isn't including the manapua and pork hash!!  I was quite overwhelmed, we all were.  It took us a good 10 minutes just to get our bearings.

Visit #1 -  I finally decided on the garlic chicken and chili frank mix.  My buddy got a manapua and roast pork plate.  My other buddy got 2 manapuas, 4 pork hash, 1 spam musubi, and 1 ume musubi.  Everyone was super happy with their food.  It was so good, in fact, that we decided to go back 3 days later.

Visit #2 - I got the hawaiian combo (lau lau, kalua pig, lomi salmon, mac salad, and rice) with a small side order of squid luau.  The lau lau was packed, unlike some other lau lau that is all leaf and not much meat.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  you get a lot of food for your money.  However, the squid luau was a little bit too sweet for my taste.  My buddy got a teriyaki chicken plate with 3 pork hash.  My other buddy got a spam musubi, 2 manapuas, 4 pork hash, and a 702 bento.  We all agreed that visit #2 was even better than visit #1.  

My new go to spot for 808 grub in the Vegas Valley!!  Everyone is so super friendly and helpful.  The staff guided my 2 haole friends through the menu and answered all of their questions as well as gave a few suggestions.

On the upside they also have hawaiian combo plates, breakfast and lunch bentos that has reasonable prices. Manapua and pork hash are also items you can purchase. Lastly, you can drink it down with Hawaiian Sun drinks. 2 *'s for now but I know it'll get higher as time goes by.

So this is a small mom and pop home style Hawaiian restaurant.  It's not very big inside, but it's full of music,  family, laughter and stories...

When you walk in you're greeted with smiles and automatically feel like you walked into your auntie's house.  You can smell the cooking in the kitchen and Hawaiian music playing in the back ground. You'll see people standing around or sitting outside talking.  Walk up and say hello!  You're either family or friend when you walk by.

The menu reads home cooked meals and if you've been to Hawaii or are from Hawaii you'll know what I mean.  Now don't get mad if you order and they say they're out.  They do make big batches, but they are popular, so you walking after lunch, you may miss out...

We had Korean Chicken and katsu while there and ordered a custard pie to go.  Now weren't hungry just there to visit.  But we ordered and so glad we did.  As my hubby would say - so ono!

2 Scoops of Aloha is a nice family-owned business. Everyone there was super nice and friendly. We barely stepped into the store before we were greeted warmly from the family. 

There are a lot of options to choose from the menu and I felt a little overwhelmed. However, after giving it some thought, I just decided to go with one of the pre-made lunch boxes under the heat lamps. 

I chose the Rise & Shine Bento (corn beef hash, Portuguese sausage, Spam, scrambled eggs, and Furikake rice). The overall flavor of the bento box was good; everything complimented each other. There wasn't much to the hash besides the slight meaty flavor. The eggs and rice helped cut down on the saltiness of the Spam and sausage. Don't underestimate this little bento box, it's very filling and I was only able to finish 80% of it. It was a nicely balanced meal.

I also got a Spam Musubi, just in case I got hungry on the plane ride home. Surprisingly, it wasn't as salty as I had anticipated. That's probably because there was a good amount of rice. This was a filling snack. 

I really hope 2 Scoops of Aloha flourishes; it's run by such a genuine group of people and that's not something you can easily find in bigger restaurants.

I mean, everything's great here, but when I have a craving for pork hash, this is where I have to go. And I finally found a place that has lup cheong. I haven't had that since I left Hawaii two years ago and I've really been missing it. They are Portuguese fried rice is also to die for.

4247301,2017-08-04,0,HJh47HQiP75ePRGg_RawaA,"I was very disappointed with the chow fun and the fried noodles. I spent over $40 and nothing was wow or gave me that familiar taste of Okazuya from Hawaii or Okinawa. It was bland food, soggy mac salad in a paper cup that gave way to the liquids. The poke was tasteless and not fresh. I am sorry to say that my first visit here was not good, but I want to try their non Okazuya menu items on my next visit. Awesome and nice people here working hard and I think the reviews will speak for itself. They need another experienced cook from Hawaii.",hMh9r-pOrNV0FT0uV_h81w,2,0,2,t9AXQlsSiBg-4hQtyfE8DA

4542142,2017-09-01,0,HJh47HQiP75ePRGg_RawaA,"I came here about 2 months ago. I saw online that they were an okazyua and was so excited to try it. 

Came in around 4pm, just our luck that there wasn't many choices because we came late. That's our fault. But they still had a good selection to choose from. Girl at the front helping us had very little knowledge about what was being served or how the menu worked. Majority of the questions we asked, she had to turn around and ask the people behind her. I get that they were fairly new and she probably didn't know much yet, but come on. I overheard my bf ask if the containers in the front had pickled onion in it (I knew it was pickled onion, idk why he didn't just ask me) and she didn't even know. Other than that, her and the aunties in the back were really friendly. 

I got chow fun, hamburger steak patty, fried chicken, and rice. My bf had the same thing, we also got 2 juices and a bottle water and another plate lunch. All of that was about $50. Shocked about how expensive that was. 

Food was okay. Chow fun was a little mushy and dry for my taste. 

I would return again in the future, only to see if the quality of the food improved.",ChQUPGg4Bh6R059hUwaQ8Q,0,0,3,lUxS966eNE0hYaBCK0OUsA

I Got there a little after 7am and they only had breakfast bentos and a few okazuya items available and They were only starting to cook the chow fun. I was disappointed as I was hoping to leave with lunch, since normally okazuya's prep and open early. Instead I left with breakfast, which was pretty good. Not sure when I'll get back there but hopefully they open a little earlier and have more okazuya items available when the doors open for business.",mt5fCaR-xKrZjmIkXnjnEw,0,0,4,xNwrHjmgfjr71_TWSHUdog

The family friendly atmosphere is definitely backed by one; and no matter who you are or how much you have been here they treat you like family. The food is always fresh and tasty, each plate they serve is made with heart and a passion for the foods they love. The customer service is beyond amazing, the food surpasses expectations every time, the restraunt is super clean and the energy is unbelievable.

Unfortunately I don't think words can describe how thankful I am to have this restraunt in town, as it has definitely become one of my favorites. What I can say though is anyone intimidated by new places, or anyone who is looking for new foods to try, come to this restraunt. I promise you wont regret it!

Thanks 2 Scoops for all the great laughs and meals over these past few months, you guys deserve every star!",NNsrBR25olLGM_vX6fO3cw,0,0,5,W6ffIkpYs1AN-y8QNawciA

Every single person in the restaurant was cheerful and helpful, and one of the ladies recommended a Hawaiian Sun beverage... OMG!  The Lilikoi Passion Fruit is like heaven in a can.
