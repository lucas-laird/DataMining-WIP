While I don't eat anything with wheat, sugar, or oil, I come here weekly or bi weekly to get my husbands bagels. 
Honestly, dear husband usually beats me to the trip to say hello to Mr. M. 

Amazing place to have here in the Historic Loop...with the family that lights up a city with love! 

I know they are traditional...but a Kite Hill chive cream cheese would really put the cherry on top!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,20,18,5,BYmoz318EU-iWL_0s5B48Q

So glad I did, got an everything bagel/cream cheese and it was DELICIOUS. And I am a picky eater. Loved it so much, went back with my boyfriend, he is the foodie, and he loved it too. He got the bagel w/ Lox. The customer service is amazing,  very friendly, ma & pop vibe. Will definitely go back.",cg4G9gYy0xqXh_TMreQlXg,0,0,5,y09JVVBD1g_xxhAVWAd15g
2016949,2018-02-08,7,Sg2AKa2X31UCmc1SmsrNUw,"One of my biggest Vegas restaurant regrets is that I didn't make it to the Montesano's Italian restaurant across town before they closed last year. Luckily, they're back in business on my side of town so I can pop by frequently! They took over a bagel shop and upgraded the product and vastly expanded the bakery offerings, adding tons of cookies and cakes. The traditional black and whites are enormous and only $3, while the giant tray of coffee cake is probably going to be my next business breakfast contribution.

My go-to order here is the Nova lox sandwich. At $10, I can customize my bagel (or bialy) and house-made schmear choice without an upcharge. I usually go savory with Everything, Cheddar, or Onion, but always get the scallion cream cheese. Bagels are always notably fresh and have just the right chew, and the lox is portioned well. Even going during peak weekday breakfast hours, they get me in and out and back on the road super quick (and with a smile!), and the portion is enough for breakfast and lunch. I've also tried the pastrami sando, which was super tender (add mustard!), but usually stick to the above. All sandwich orders come with a side and pickle, making more than enough food even if you're ravenous.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,12,4,bD9XcCNmVVfB_m1cglaoPQ

3547360,2018-02-10,0,Sg2AKa2X31UCmc1SmsrNUw,"This is my first time here and I'm really impressed! We ordered a plain bagel, garlic bagel and a house sandwich - egg salad on a lightly toasted plain bagel. The sandwich came with a choice side of coleslaw or macaroni salad. I chose the latter. The egg salad was a bit too salty for me but I guess it complemented the plain bagel. The macaroni salad was okay, nothing really special. The bagels, however, were great! Customer service was equally awesome. The lady, whom I assume was one of the owners, came over to get our empty baskets to clear our table and to give us ""more elbow room"". To top it off, the restroom was clean! If I'm on this side of town again, I'll be back! Definitely will be back!",2UEa-sgwSybZUNZsvwnwJw,0,0,5,4eYIjWI-GS6ABNg-QdhmrA

3897656,2018-03-26,0,Sg2AKa2X31UCmc1SmsrNUw,After my doctor's appointment across the parking lot I happened to see their sign. Always craving a good bagel I decided to give it a try not expecting much mainly because I have not found good bagels anywhere in Vegas. Got a half dozen with an extra one being free. Liked the free one!  Got them home and immediately ate one.   Really really good!  I grew up back east. I would say very similar in taste.  Cooked just right for the best combination of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Will definitely be back.  Looking forward to trying other things there.  In addition to the good bagels the lady at the front counter was very nice.,plZ_-qqohmS65q5WRX29uw,0,0,5,pptIkkUXm9zxyakQ1gbnMA

I came for lunch and ended up eating my dinner here as well. I noticed they had breakfast sandwiches which is hard for me to stay away from. Egg, meat, cheese melted together in a mess is tough to top. I asked the gentleman behind the counter (Stevie i believe) to make the sandwich as if he was making it for himself, and he said Taylor Ham! I have heard of this ham from a comic named Joey Diaz so i was excited to give it a whirl. In addition to my breakfast mess, i crave a good bagel with lox/cream cheese and order this to combo with my breakfast sandwich. Also asking him to please make it as he would like it, and i ate BOTH my sandwiches in my lunch sitting. So good, and super reasonable for the money. I really appreciate service, and Stevie seems to have a genuine passion for the food he serves and makes you feel very welcome and appreciates the business you bring him. Just a straight up real person, this alone would have me return but its a bonus he serves good grub. 

Only regret...I should have tried to coffee cake but i was so full i passed on it. Next time, it shall be mine!",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,3,2,5,ny_607uiodc_p1HsjI2-Zw
4123401,2018-06-15,0,Sg2AKa2X31UCmc1SmsrNUw,"This gets a 5 star because:
1. This is an actual bakery (just like the name suggests) where goods are actually baked where they're sold and they're delicious, we tried two different types of cookies.
2. The deli items were made/prepared in-house, such as the potatoe and egg salad and these items were also delicious. 
3. The service was good.
4. This place is super reasonably priced, $7 for my bagel sandwich, side, and pickle.",dN6_5KVoN2jWrO81o00CrQ,0,0,5,vV0ezcB5Ch1h9OVG6fdcYw

We were initially greeted by the staff who were very nice and answered any questions we had. My friend and I both ordered the turkey & cheese sandwich on an everything bagel and my other friend ordered the tuna fish sandwich on wheat bread. With our sandwiches, it came with a choice of chips, potato salad, macaroni salad, or coleslaw. Everything was made fresh to order and reasonably priced with your choice of toppings including lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayo, and mustard. With everything being extremely delicious, my friend and I couldn't help but order a small assortment of cookies to go. Although you can't go wrong with any of the cookies, my favorite one was the cream cheese cookie. With this place being so close to work, I'll definitely be coming back to try their other sandwiches.",iqvQ-4xBNIoBQbMp5S7_AQ,4,2,5,3gSeSlNT5qKmqH2KeKZVFg

5279996,2018-03-26,2,Sg2AKa2X31UCmc1SmsrNUw,"Making converts of the West Side with Bagels and Italian Cookies now for three months it was a few days after Saint Joseph's Day that a third stop was made at New York Bagel N Bakery, Steve Montesano and his sister both present bright and early with four seasonal Pastries set aside for pre-order plus several additional items available to kick off a pleasant weekend of dining with friends and family.

Now a more polished operation than shortly after taking over the space at 840 South Rancho Drive, new signage and homey touches giving the spacious confines tucked away in a strip-mall off Decatur a lot more personality, it was with friendly service that eight larger items plus just over a pound of Cookies were selected, packaged and paid for, first bites of a puffy round featuring Marzipan and Chocolate continuing to set a high bar though Montesano's Cream Cheese Drop Cookie remains the best one-bite item from a collection that tallies greater than twenty.

Moving next to two prior favorites, the freshly frosted Black & White Cookies even better just out of the oven and unsliced Rainbow ""Cookies"" offered as a dense wedge with Raspberry Jelly in textbook proportion to Almond Cake plus a top and bottom of Dark Chocolate, those investigating the refrigerator case may  find themselves tempted by a variety of Cream Cheese flavors as well as New York Cheesecake, but another option worth consideration is the Boston Cream Cake with layers light as Angelfood sandwiching a center of airy Whipped Cream beneath a dollop of Chocolate. 

At last sampling the impetus for this visit, an Italian tradition made in celebration of March 19th's Feast of San Guiseppe, it came as sort of a surprise that the Cream-filled Ring actually featured Choux instead of the traditional Dough one might associate with Zeppole or Bombolini, the texture not dissimilar to Paris Brest but replacing Hazelnut with Cannoli-filling or, better yet, light Cream studded with Maraschino Cherries.

****1/2: Done no favors by their location or a name that fails to properly shine light on the Montesano's heritage New York Bagel N Bakery remains a place worth seeking out for those looking for Las Vegas' best Italian Pastries while the Bagels are also amongst the best in Sin City.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,5,b5ZMK7SEYmrrS8TK2ejrCw
