Wow. Worst attitude I've ever experienced from an employee at Subway. No greeting, no interest, no eye contact, body language sending clear signals that my very presence was a major inconvenience. My ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"" never garnered a ""you're welcome. ""

2 customer's came in when I was leaving. They said ""good morning! How are you doing ! "" to same employee only to be met with silence. 

Kind of surprised consider how everyone at jersey mikes and urban turban were so nice and had outstanding food. 

Oh well",d06gf3Y9xlYF7169tVJ3Vg,1,0,1,W5AUtixQzCtbVFF29B6M9Q

Gave her the description, the young lady had me sit down and wait then surprises me with ""we don't have tuna"" so I say ""okay I'll settle for a chicken sandwich. She adds all the toppings from the previous order that I clearly said I did not want on this new order. She pretty much half assed everything. Toasted my sandwich for 5 Lucky I had to get back to work, I would have made a friendly phone call while i was there. Terrible service- get it TOGETHER!




12/12/17 : 1:12 pm- same girl Maria- just dropped my coworkers sandwich! Needs to make new one. Lmao!! This is crazy... she isn't fit to work there Im sorry.",8HsRpiymH3Umt9xzzEHDwQ,0,0,1,z7V-e1cLpJfVhVaf-VdfbA
1591265,2017-12-06,0,Ohy6TtDSeJkVAtIHXP7pMw,"Ridiculously slow. Just spent my entire lunch waiting on one sandwich. The lady at the check out was having difficulty ringing people up and needed help from younger girl Maria who would not get off talking on her cell phone to help. Literally called her over 5 separate occasions to get help with ONE customer. Then once they sort of figured it out, they had to start over because it apparently go through. I had to walk out without my food and almost was late to work. THANKS SUBWAY. Not going there ever again",AwFBltmW39HCE3oQdnsUAw,0,0,1,4ZAAWu2Qnl7AcmG4T--wgg

The service is SLOW
One worker should never be working at a 24hour location especially when it's so close to the Vegas Strip
Kai Kala need to slow down and actually take the orders instead of panicking and messing up everything",Z39SmlBQ3EX6gZC6UTAAlA,0,0,3,A0XeKy5HatjP_UG1Yph5bg

4132448,2016-07-08,1,Ohy6TtDSeJkVAtIHXP7pMw,"Seems silly to write a review for a casual dining spot such as Subway - but every experience I have had at this location .. The one across from Del Frisco's .. has always been a great experience. 

The staff is always friendly - the service is quick and I am a fan of their weekly specials menu. That may be at all Subway establishments,but this is literally the only one I go to regularly :) 

I have found myself grabbing sandwiches here as many as 3 times a week. With $3 specials for 6 inch subs - every day of the week - it's a great choice for a quick bite and fast service. 

Happy eating !",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,4,1,5,xXEjNMNP0fztS63zZm6HQQ
4803777,2017-04-09,0,Ohy6TtDSeJkVAtIHXP7pMw,Usually great service by one of the great employees. Our company prefers to go here but we are thinking about Changing due to one of their employees.  Very rude  they forgot part of our order so we had  to go back.  Get there ask for one cookie to compensate  for the mistake and the employee said no!  REALLY?  Unfortunately she doesn't know anything about customer service!  we spend a lot of $ @this location. Maybe another location would appreciate our business.,j0-rx5fj3cymwjTlNavlVw,0,0,3,cWqS4qc2FBOO6YWOWDiW-g

They do charge a bit more for their subs, but only found that out when I went to get the same sub at another location the next day? I wonder why they do that? I thought they all have same prices? I guess not. No biggy, I like this store and will go back again.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,10,10,5,N-c1lf0az5M-1X_kTfRQLA
