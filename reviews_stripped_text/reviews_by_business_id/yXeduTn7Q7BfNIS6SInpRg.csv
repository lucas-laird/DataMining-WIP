2453480,2017-01-21,0,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,The pizza wasn't the best and the cheese just went off w the tinfoil it comes w wrapped around. The mozzarella sticks were really yummy and didn't taste like they just came out of a microwave im just giving two stars because the pizza was not worth it and it killed my appetite.,z7H2fbxyJRYy05dgkxFAtA,2,1,2,a9e1-AlLBery3VI6rISQzA
3054619,2017-06-24,2,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,"The Double cheese burger combo was awful! Thee most processed, obviously frozen, obnoxiously sized, mystery meat patties. They were covered in ketchup on both buns. Very unfair, it is definitely not the burger we saw in the pic.",ZeZR1oBhQwrhcg1nQ8ZHIg,1,0,1,BU2gZFBqFM2u9QLmbzU_Ag
3286300,2016-12-15,1,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,We just ordered from here courtesy of Uber eats & the food is TERRIBLE! I took 1 bite of my crab cakes & it taste like I ate a wad of salt. I ordered their large apple cobbler & it's TINY! My son's steak sandwich was salty as well... heavy handed cook on guess. Never again will we order from them!!!,lqL_vyU6Ar5ol3yEm5VAwA,5,1,1,h_VCNr6sc6fuTYxvZJ7F6Q
3565149,2017-02-14,0,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,Not sure what these other people are talking about. I ordered the breakfast plate and it came with hot food and the smoothie i ordered was delicious. This was perfect for a night in and it was quick from UberEats. I'll be ordering from here again tomorrow night after a few cocktails.,HNyn5YsrX9R_UnW-twFFEA,0,0,5,iFUhTA_ZJIZAHVpe7_qL-A
5049261,2017-03-18,2,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,"Man. I wanted so badly to like this place. The menu looked to have nice variety, and the pictures really sold it. My roommate and I just had this delivered through a third party delivery service. After it taking almost 2 hours to get here (probably the third party delivery services fault, but just extra frustration,) we find that one of the drinks is missing. Ok, whatever. We can get a drink from the fridge. My roommate then opens her shrimp bowl to find that it's all chicken, not a piece of shrimp in all the land. Maybe this wouldn't be such a big deal, we like to try to roll with the punches, except that she can't eat chicken. Not doesn't like it. Can. Not. Eat. It. Of course she is bummed because after all this time we are starving, so she attempts to call the restaurant and is told too bad, some random check box on the the app is checked ""make with chicken"" by default, even though it is clearly a shrimp bowl, with the option for chicken right under it. Third party mistake? Who knows. Look. Even at the end of the day, if she had for some reason wanted some chicken in it, if she had checked ""shrimp"" it's because she wanted, you guessed it, shrimp! So at the very least there could have been some shrimp in the shrimp dish! Meanwhile, my order, other than my missing drink, was all there... but it was astonishingly subpar. The cheese on the grilled cheese might as well have still had the plastic on the processed cheese slices, and the onion rings were burnt. Hard as rocks. Not enjoyable at all. The only decent thing about the whole meal was the fries, they were decidedly ok. The point of all of this is even if the screw up was the delivery services fault, the customer service could have been SOOOOOO much better. I work in a job where I deal with people all day and I know that a huge part of the experience, in ANY field, is the service. Things can go wrong but when you attempt to rectify the situation, those people will return. There were a million different ways to handle that that would have been more correct than a shrug and a ""too bad for you"". Especially for food that, what we did get of it, was not impressive and not cheap. Bummer, I was hoping this would be our new lazy night ordering spot. Hard pass.",IbTKoSbTZyNfE1hup5bpMA,5,2,1,WIW-4TuTGewwdvyZmuUsJQ
5230809,2017-11-19,0,yXeduTn7Q7BfNIS6SInpRg,"WARNING!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! The owner is a joke, just like their food. I ordered food delivery through GrubHub, the food was on time and delivery man was super nice. However, I can't say anything positive about this restaurant. The burger is disgusting and tastes like it was stuck in the freezer for years. The ""fried"" pb&j sandwiches, HA, more like toasted bread with peanut butter and jelly slapped in between. Super buttery and leaves your fingers covered in grease. Owner refused to give me a refund on his disgusting food. 
You, sir, do not know how to be in the restaurant business. 
If you are looking for disappointment, to be unsatisfied, and regret....LOOK NO FURTHER. This owner has it all. ;)",7juOiUHo6IcElYoFrkHsng,0,0,1,C0rcI9_OaaA3P1O_Doiybw
