We started with the charcuterie board. Overall very nice, but we did not get to finish it because our food came out. There was not place on the table for the entrée plates so I had to hold my hot plate while the food runner piled everything on the table on our half finished food. The waiter made us so uncomfortable about wanting to finish the starter that we just let him clear it.

My husband had a steak and fries, he enjoyed the steak, but the fries were not edible. We were able to squeeze grease out of them, and not just a drop. I had the pork, it came highly recommend from our server. It was overcooked, poorly butchered, and lacked flavor. The sauce was disappointing. The horseradish mashed potatoes tasted like raw garlic...which is strange. We only took one bite each, and decided they too would go uneaten. 

The biggest problem came a few hours later, when we had to take turns in the restroom. A horrid end to our otherwise fantastic trip to Vegas.",ISe-3s7NI3EAtn_pV-HkHA,2,2,2,vhcJhcyIF32t70ArZLkWzw

Beef Wellington is amazing. Perfect red core and flaky outer shell. Make sure to order this right away because it takes 40 minutes to reach your table.

We arrived late, an hour before closing so sat at the bar whole waiting for a table without reservations.  They had just began happy hour so instead of $26 glass of pinot noir,received a glass of Acacia pinot  for only $8. Score!
The restaurant was about 1/4 filled but it was a 10 minute wait to set the table...not sure why son e the tables were already all set. 

Service was mediocre,our server took about 10 more minutes to get us waters which was heavily chlorinated. In a restaurant where you serve good food, maybe invest in a ro system for water?

We ordered 4 courses of appetizers : 
1) escargot- too buttery ,nauseatingly rich because the butter was trapped within the pastry
2) king crab crepe- light texture but also too heavy on butter,trumpet mushrooms were a nice touch
3) foie gras parfait- light, fluffy and melted perfectly 
4)prime beef tartare- delicious!! Egg yolk mixed in with grade A beef ,perfect

Our server described it as ""adult PB&J."" The steak tartar has a very delicate flavor, so start with that first if you're going to have it because it didn't quite stand up to the other appetizers. 

For mains, my friend ordered the Parisian gnocchi and it was excellent. I had the pork chop (it was huge and saltier with the bacon). Came with delicious horseradish mashed potatoes. My husband had a steak, which he enjoyed. The wine service was very nice - the server came with 3 recommended wines (one for each of us) and he poured us samples. The only downside was that we were completely unaware of the price (he quoted one glass at $18 and it was actually $25). 

For dessert, don't miss the chocolate macaroon. It's big enough to share.

483374,2016-01-04,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Wife and I had an early dinner at Bardot before seeing Zarkana (The Circus de Soleil show at Aria.). The Zarkana theater is right next door to this restaurant. The food was very good and prices reasonable (OK...I did pay $60 for my petite filet. But it was one of the best steaks I've ever had!) Let's start with the bread-freshly made baguettes. Bardot makes its own baguettes every morning and they're great. We shared a crab crepe for an appetizer. It was very creative with a sunnyside-up fried egg, chunks of crab, spinach and garnished with green apples on a whole wheat tortilla. I had steak frites (a petite filet) and my wife had a cod fish entree. The cod was somewhat bland, but the cut of fish was very good. Here's my basic breakdown of Bardot:

1. Food: B+ (I don't believe in grade inflation; so the food really was quite good eventhough my wife's entree could have been better.

2. Waite Staff: B+  Our waiter was a little cold, but very efficient and professional. We told our waiter that we only had 1 1/2 hours for dinner because of our theater tickets. No problem. We were easily served within that time and got to our theater seats 5 minutes before show time. Perfect.

3. Ambiance: A-  This restaurant has a beautiful bar. It's generally a quiet restaurant with the tables spaced far enough apart so you don't have to be an unwilling listener to the next table's gossip.

4. Presentation of Food: B  Nothing too over-the-top

5. Table Setting: C  This is my biggest complaint of Bardot's. The tables were marble with very little on them. The tableware, china, etc. did not seem on a par with a restaurant of this caliber. The table setting was quite cold. But this is a very minor point and shouldn't stop you from eating at this wonderful restaurant.

Highly recommend this restaurant. We'll be back.",oXig4CgLNjQGwUoP7S-MEA,0,0,4,IRptiEJFq89QpKBvDnyRmQ

I don't remember the cost, but there was a good selection of options for the three courses, but I'd had my heart set on the escargot.  Escargot is one of those things - if it's on the menu, I will get it, and I will choose the rest of my menu around it, so since that was not one of the appetizer options I went a la carte.  Unfortunately, the escargot was not what I expected. I knew it came wrapped in a pastry puff, and I like anything in a pastry puff, but this just didn't do it for me.  Not bad, just not great.  A bit on the dry and chewy side.  The mussels that I had for dinner made up for it.  A huge bowl of plump mussels in a delicious creamy broth that I just soaked up with the warm baguette that came with it.  I wish I had room for dessert but I was stuffed at that point.

From the moment we set foot in the door, we were treated to candlelit lighting and a venture into classic Parisian style. The grandiose bar upon entry was simply stunning and I almost requested a perch just to admire it. 

We were lead to a booth seat which allowed for a view of the kitchen, and granted we enjoyed a late-night (after 10pm) meal, we noticed every member of the staff carried themselves as if it was the dinner rush, with the same hustle and care you might expect. 

Our server Kim, or LIl' Kim as she was labeled by her colleagues treated us with utmost respect, care and offered genuine suggestions to assist in our meal. Cocktails were super yummy and the pace at which the food arrived was seamless. 

In fact, the second round of cocktails my partner ordered was not as good as the first and our server happily exchanged it without billing us for the switch. 

We ordered the chickpea frites, the Chiteaux cheese, the Tarte Flambee and the Croque Madame. The first two options came on wooden and marble slabs, respectively and the portions were perfect for an amuse buche, In all honesty, I was feeling rather full after the appetizers. Our mains were scrumptious and clearly made to please. Savoury and well-orchestrated was the norm for the food we enjoyed here. 

The ambience is lends itself to being both modern & romantic. From the presentation to the portion size to the flavour Bardot's food went over and above our expectations. Their Chef is a wizard and we were delighted with every bite.

Pending review

Made a reservation for a table for 3 for dinner and were seated by the bar area, which was very disappointing. We asked if we could be seated in the main restaurant and were told there were no tables available. Perhaps we should have been told this when the reservation was made? We ordered cocktails and it took 45 minutes just to get our drinks. The waitress kept apologizing that the bar was backed up. Honestly-45 minutes to get drinks?? By the time our drinks came, we finished our appetizers and were ready for our main meal. The manager did comp our drinks but it did not make up for the long wait time. The food was well prepared and very tasty but overall this was not a great experience. There are too many excellent restaurants in Vegas where they appreciate your patronage. I would not recommend spending your money here.",h2qDTuZyHSf7j-5kSQsKKg,0,0,2,YioDR9YkMT0x691CVywumQ

I asked to see the HH food menu to which he replied ""we don't have that right now"". Ok...at the time I thought I must have misread something or got the times mixed up.

Shortly after receiving our meal, my friend wanted ketchup and orange juice. Our waitress was not around, so we asked another passing by. That waiter agreed to help, but never returned. Oscar passed by and was given the same request. Before he could return, our waitress showed up and we told her of the request believing that the others had relayed the information to her. Shortly there after, the waitress returned without the ketchup proclaiming that the restaurant was ""out of orange juice"" and that someone was sent downstairs to get more. However, less than 60 seconds later, Oscar arrived with both ketchup and a full glass of fresh OJ. Our waitress never returned to address this issue. 

While our waitress did a fine job, in general, it was Oscar who seemed to go above and beyond for a table that was not his responsibility. When leaving, we attempted to give him a separate tip, but he refused. He said that he loved his job and that sometimes it's just good to do the right thing. So, for that, Oscar is to be commended!

The roast marrow bones could have used a tad more under the broiler, and they should not have had ketchup or bbq sauce or whatever that was slathered on them.

The lamb rack was delicious, if a little stringy in places. The tarte tatin was difficult to eat, due to the pastry being impervious to every provided utensil.

Short-rib Croissant Benedict: RICH, delicious, savory. I don't know if I'd order this again, but I only regret my stomach wasn't big enough for this to fit comfortably.

French toast with mascapone, almond brittle, and almond syrup: huge, perfectly balanced in sweetness and textures. This is definitely large enough for 2 people to share.

 Heritage Chicken- This was the star of the meal. So juicy, I'm not typically a fan of meat on the bone but this was so tender it literally fell off. Even came with a side of green beans and mushroom bread pudding!

Pork Chop- Yummmmy. If you like pork chops, you will love this one.

Mac & Cheese- This macaroni and cheese had an awesome presentation, the noodles are individually standing up, very impressive. I wanted to take a picture but it looked so good I had to dig in!! 

For Dessert, I had the infamous chocolate macaroon they advertise and it was very, very rich. If you're a chocolate lover, this will be your go to. I wanted to finish it so bad but I was so full I  almost rolled out of this place.

The restaurant is loud like previous reviews said, but I was still able to have conversation without a problem. I loved how I felt like I was in Paris. The service was very attentive but not overbearing. The hostess and manager even asked how we enjoyed our meal on the way out!

1099945,2018-01-05,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"One of higher priced and higher-end restaurants where we'd expect high quality food and service, but haven't found it.
1. Small table squeezed between other seated tables in small area of the room, while half the room was empty until we left. I think they could've at least spread the customers/parties farther away from each other until more customers arrive. I saw another customer complaining about the same issue in a previous Yelp review, but looks like this restaurant doesn't learn or doesn't care much about customer experience. The table also felt too small for 4 people.
2. Very long wait for the soup before the entrée and no waitress around, until we had to ask the water server if we could get the soup soon.
3. I ordered medium-rare wagyu steak, but gotten one of the rarest/uncooked steaks I've ever eaten. I felt like I'm eating raw cow. Also, I didn't see much marbling in the meat, associated with wagyu beef. Although there was some nice crust on the outside that tasted really good, and whatever I could eat was good. I could only imagine that the steak could be really good if cooked a little better.
4. The waitress recommended mac-n-cheese as a side dish, which looked interesting, but tasted ordinary and somewhat too cheesy. At least they should've recommend a better side dish, unless they don't serve anything better...
5. The waitress asked if we like the food and need anything before we started eating, but later never came back to follow up when we actually needed her. We haven't seen her again until finishing the meal. Although this could be the restaurant's fault, as the waitress seemed to be serving a lot of tables, possibly around 10. Although it shouldn't take too much time for her to ask couple more times if we need anything else.
6. The waitress looked and acted like someone who should be cleaning tables at a buffet, without even basic education or food serving skills. She made the whole place feel like a low end country diner. Do they just hire anyone from the street to wait tables here?
7. Overall the rest of the food was good, but the sides somewhat ordinary. Ordinary fries, ordinary tasting mac-n-cheese, ordinary onion soup, undercooked steak. We wanted to be just a little impressed with something.
8. We waited long time for a dessert menu, after finishing the food. It was so long that we've decided to go somewhere else for dessert. While every restaurant should know that the most important time to serve customers is when they arrive, and when they are finishing eating. How can you even run a restaurant not understanding such basics, or not training your staff?
9. A manager came to check on us when finishing our dinner, but it was too late to complain about food, while it didn't feel appropriate to ask him for dessert menu. I also wanted to gather my thoughts to write some notes for this review. Though maybe we should've talked to him.
10. Our bill was $280 and felt overpriced considering the above (we didn't order drinks except couple bottles of water).

We were initially excited and looking forward to visiting this place, but left quite disappointed. We are a family of 4 and initially each of us rated the place between 2 and 4, but agreed on 2 after discussing the above issues.

I so very much want to rate this place 4 stars. The decor and ambiance are top notch, exuding a classy feel of a refined and upscale Parisian bistro. I also love the look and layout of their bar. Beyond this, that's where my disappointment started trickling in. Their house bread was for my preference, too hard. My latté was rather average. Their French omelette I'll have to say boasted great flavors. The cheese inside the omelette was very tasty, and the side salad with the vinaigrette cuts nicely into the heaviness/richness from the omelette. Before my main dish, I started off with their puff pastry escargot, and that I hate to admit was my biggest disappointment. Escargot is my favorite Parisian delicacy (I eat them almost everyday whenever I'm in Paris...probably not the healthiest thing to do). I definitely appreciate the different way they prepare them here, but it was quite honestly rather bland. If you're curious about trying this restaurant, I would still recommend giving it a go.

For starters we did the duck wings à l'orange, escargots bardot, and bone marrow en persillade. All incredible flavors. The sauce for the wings was a perfect sweetness allowing for the wood grilled flavors to still come through combined with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce. Escargots strong as well. Unique dish with each piece wrapped in puff pastry. Bone marrow incredible. Very rich flavors supplemented with grilled bread to balance. 

For entrees we did the king crab crêpe, rack of lamb frites, and loup de mer ah fenouil (sea bass). Very delicious blend of flavors in the crêpe. The crab flavor shines through despite the mix of apple, mushrooms, and egg. Lamb was perfectly tender. Large portions with a perfect mix of flavors. Interesting chickpea fries with spinach and tomato. Sea bass delicious. Light but flavorful. Cooked to perfection.

I'm not much of a 'yelper' but because of my experience here, and the fact that there is so much restaurant 'noise' in Las Vegas, I felt it was warranted. I've been to Vegas a ton of times, and have eaten in most of the high end places. I've eaten in many Michael Mina restaurants around the country as well. This time, I was here for a national sales meeting and had dinner at Bardot with my team of 12 from across the country. When I plan group dinners I prefer a prix fix as it's easier on everyone, and on my budget. Bardot had a great choice of menus in multiple price points that featured main courses that are high on the normal menu. Everything was great and everyone enjoyed their meals. What really set Bardot apart for me was in the service. Of course, we all enjoyed the food but for a 3 month old restaurant in Vegas, where there is so much transient help, I was impressed. I eat a vegan diet and also love to eat. In NY it's easy to eat where there are many inventive chefs and I'm not just getting a salad...in other places, it is hit or miss. At Bardot I got a great meal of multiple courses that followed the rest of the group. My dishes were plentiful in variety of ingredients and prepared quite well. Our entire service team, led by John Paul was great. He was attentive and responsive, timely and traditional in service. Explaining my vegan meal and the point of view of the chef de cuisine, which was greatly appreciated. Even after multiple rounds of champagne, wine and cocktails, managing a group of 12 women after all day meetings in Vegas, was easy for them all.  I will be back at the end of June and will visit again.

Cocktails were standard morning fair- a peach bellini for my girl, mimosa for me. While wonderful, 15 bucks a pop is a little much. All the other food was well worth the price.

Charcuterie board to start and it was divine. The prosciutto was just a touch fatty and hard to cut, but the flavor was excellent. The pate went beautifully with the bread served, and the pork spread even better.

For entrees, steak and eggs for the girlfriend. She growled when I tried for a bite of the steak so I'm assuming it was spot on.

As for me, I would live on my entree if I could. The Hunters Waffle was duck confit on a waffle with over easy egg on top. I really can't describe it, but can say if you're here for brunch, this should be a serious first look. It was beyond amazing. Melted in my mouth, the egg yolk and duck went together so well, and the waffle soaked up the excess. All in all, an experience not to be missed.

Summer melon with cheese (fresh burrata), cantaloupe, honey dew, and a balsamic reduction. The fruit was amazingly sweet and the burrata paired so well with the fruit! It was soft, creamy and delicate.

A play on duck a l'orange, where duck breast was replaced with duck wings. They were tender and perfectly cooked. But! I wanted duck skin and did not get it. It was fine but less preferred. It came with 3 wings. 

Sole meuniere...stop all the clocks.. lol. If you like fish, butter, and artichoke flavors, this dish is a must. I loved it! Little bit of capers, two fillets of sole rolled and placed on top of an artichoke puree... all tied together with butter.. it was tres tres perfect. This is a dish I'll remember for a while!

1289926,2015-01-26,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"I went here on the recommendation of one of my coworkers.  Me and the man friend weren't celebrating anything just a date and a night out.  I really like french food and nicer restaurants, but he hasn't been to a lot of them. The atmosphere and the look of the restaurant is very cook, brassy and mirrors and glass everywhere its very cute and I really enjoyed it. 
We made reservations for 7:30 and arrived a little early, they were able to seat us right away.  We were led by whom I believe to be the maitre d' or perhaps one of the managers, to a table for four people, even though we were only 2, that also had a card on the table.  Once I sat down I realized that the name on the card was not mine nor my man friends.  
I asked the gentleman who had sat us if he needed this, to which he replied and stated to my man friend, ""you're not victor?"", my man friend stated no, and I made a joke about him seating us at the wrong table, (I work in the hospitality industry, and have worked in restaurants before, so I understand that things happen), the gentleman's response was a half laugh and to ask again if he was not Victor.  Still not Victor. The entire encounter was a bit strange but again I understand.
The waiter then came over to take our drink orders, and bring us some menus as we had not been given them when sat.  I asked for a recommendation on a wine that was similar to a Merlot, and the man friend got an old fashioned. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and asked if we had any questions or anything.
We got escargot for a starter which I love and the man friend isn't normally a fan of, but he really liked them as did I. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned very well, and the crescent crust they are surrounded in was amazing.  I have eaten at bouchon and they do something similar there, but this is amazing as well, very impressed for just having opened up.  
I got the gnocchi for my main dish and he got the chicken, we got the macaroni to share for a side.   The waiter complimented our choices and stated that we would indeed enjoy them. He was a very great guy, shame that I never did get his name, he did not tell us, and wasn't wearing a name tag to my  knowledge.  
The mean was amazing, every thing tasted amazing, the chicken was cooked perfectly, my gnocchi was amazing and the macaroni was to die for. 
We then decided to have some desert which was amazing, we got the chocolate macaron, and I am a fan of macarons so that was already a plus.  Its an over sized chocolate macaron, with salted caramel and a chocolate ganoch over the top of it. Melted in my mouth, was so very rich and decadent.  
I also got an after dinner drink that the waiter recommended and stated would taste sort of like a chocolate shake, he was indeed right. Delicious! 

Our overall experience was amazing! I will certainly be coming back again and recommend it to my friends and those who come into the hotel I work for. They have a few bumps that need to be worked out, but I am confident that they will have a wonderful go of it in Las Vegas and a very successful restaurant and bar.",2hrpkc5F4Cjd7wFbg-W-nA,1,0,4,7gJ7pdfMx4lGa_4OAvDZ3Q

Brunch on the weekend is one of my fav times to come in.  I am definitely a Bardot regular so will steer you in the right direction.  

BEST first!  

HUNTER WAFFLES.. waffles w/ Duck Confit is to die for delish w/ the oozing poached egg & sauce maltaise on top.  A must!  

WARM BEET & GOAT CHEESE SALAD!  Toasted hazelnuts, wild arugula & cassis vinaigrette.  Presentation & flavors are an A+ every time chef's.  I compare every beet salad to Bardot's.

The BEST LEMON MERINGUE!  Gorgeous.  All the elements are equally perfect.  My go-to dessert & I'm not a dessert person, if so it's usually chocolate.  

PÂTÉ DE CAMPAGNE .. best I've ever had.  Beautiful traditional housemade pâté w/ heritage pork, veal & pistachios w/ mustard.
CHARCUTERIE comes w/ a nice half of the pâté, Pork rillettes, saucisson sec, Bayonne ham & mustard.   Either one is perfect as an app or whole meal.  I've ordered it to-go for a lunch party at my house, which worked remarkably.  Paired w/ a nice bottle of wine & take your time enjoying.  
ADD the Pastry & Breads as a side!  (See pic) OR 
LE FROMAGE!  The cheese dish is phenomenal!  They change up, but my fav is the one I posted.  Toasted hazelnuts, Crémeux de Bourgogne, Epoisse de Berthaut, & Bleu de Causses, all cow, Secret de Compostelle (sheep) & Valencay Affinó (goat).

MILLE FEUILLE Another amazing DESSERT!  Caramelized puff pastry, vanilla créme patisserie phenomenal.  Best, but first try the Lemon Meringue!

HEARTH BAKED QUICHE ... classic lorraine, bacon, kale, creamy delish!  Large slice & filling!  

CROQUE MADAME pain de mie, Paris ham, gruyère fondue topped w/ the usual organic egg.  Over the weekend I asked if they could do a Salmon Monsieur, which turned out unbelievable!  Thank you chef's!

MAINE LOBSTER THERMIDOR over garlic mashed potatoes, mushrooms duxelles, fine herbs, smothered in sauce béarnaise.  Oh mmm!  A must!

FOIE GRAS PARFAIT thoroughly enjoy every melt-in-your-mouth moment.  Ruby port gelée on grilled country bread.  Savory & sweet for brunch or dinner!  Top 5.

CRÉME BRÛLÉE.. vanilla bean custard, turbinado croquant, all I need to say.  Mmm!

AMERICAN IN PARIS .. a large more traditional breakfast w/ a square Crispy hashbrowns, sausage, scrambled eggs & toast.  Fantastic!

LE STEAKBURGER... if you're in the mood for a tender Prime Rib Patty, soft bun, comté cheese, garlic aïoli, watercress, hand-cut fries, side of bordelaise onions & lettuce.  

SMOKED SALMON BRIOCHE chive mascarpone, traditional garnitures.  Everything to love!  

PRIME STEAK TARTARE ground-to-order, sauce verte, egg yolk & toasted baguette!  

FRENCH TOAST is not only picture worthy, like everything here, but enormous.  Brioche French toast w/ vanilla mascarpone, a crunchy nut brittle & orgeat syrup!  Definitely shareable & my whole fix for the year it's so decadent.  

KING CRAB CRÊPE... mmm the buckwheat crêpe, black Truffle mushroom, sunny side-up egg, cider beurre blanc... disappointing if you don't mix it all together w/ the crab & get the full flavors, even w/ the green apple.

ESCARGOT BARDOT wild burgundy snails, toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse garlic butter in puff pastry shells.  Beautiful if you're a fan.  

LOBSTER BENEDICT W/ KALE... Can't go wrong with Lobster or the Benedict. 

CHICKEN FRENCH DIP.. gruyère cheese, mushroom bread pudding, haricot verts, vin jaune au jus.  Almost taste like Chicken Thanksgiving, but my least favorite.  Tad bit mushy & maybe less of an ingredient.  

If you like fish, I've tried these two, neither was fantastic, just ok.  I think Bardot has better dinner items.  

HERB-CRUSTED ALASKAN COD.. The English peas, sweet corn, saffron beurre blanc give it a nice lite touch.

LOUP DE MER.. roasted Mediterranean Sea bass, caramelized lemon, fennel, steamed potatoes.  

Yes, an extensive review that is a year overdue.  There's also a drink call 'And God Created Woman' that's unique along w/ other & a wonderful wine list.  Michael Mina never fails & the chef's are Food Network stars to me.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,8,7,5,LwW0yWmzrWgJSAEy0IT5Ww

I went here with my boyfriend for a date night on a Wednesday. It was our first time here & the restaurant itself is beautiful. 

The lighting & ambiance is nice, it was just very loud. We were sitting very close in between two other tables & we could hear every word they were saying, & I felt like we were shouting over them to have a conversation. 

The food was amazing! We're both lovers of French food & Bardot did not disappoint. Make sure you eat the bread with the delicious butter- I hardly ever eat bread & it's totally worth it here! 

We had the Foie Gras Parfait for a starter, He had the Heritage Chicken & I had the Scallops Meunière & every bite was absolutely wonderful! The portions I feel are very generous for French cuisine. 

The service was the only thing that was lacking. Thus only four stars (I would give 3 1/2 if I could). Our server was very inattentive. It took forever to just order our drinks. He didn't even come by after we received our entrees to see if we needed anything. Never offered/asked if we wanted another drink when our first ones were gone. Although we were full from our meal I kind of wanted to try dessert but didn't want to wait for the waiter since he was taking so long. Our bus boy was amazing though! It was super busy & he seemed like he may have been new.

Food: Michael Mina is mostly known for his seafood but his French style restaurant really has great flavors. For starters the Foie Gras parfait is definitely a shared appetizer as it is very rich for just one person. The foie gras is topped with a gelle that has a raspberry flavor and paired with perfectly toasted French bread; very rich but the foie gras flavor is suttle. Entrees included a roast chicken which I doubted at first but it was one of the best roasted chickens I ever had and was served with a mushroom bread pudding saute green beans. The salmon had a nice sear on the skin and was definitely pan roasted in butter as the fish was tender throughout. Accompanied with lentils that help balance the flavor. All in all both entrees were very rich as the portions were more than enough to not have room for dessert.

Service: Since it was a quiet week in vegas and our dinner time was early the number of staff was more than the number of diners so the service was great. Timing and recommendations was helpful and perfect.

Ambiance: Its vegas so the décor is classy and high end. Clean, elegant and since it was an early dining time the noise level was pleasantly quiet.",2kVBQ7qTtRoZEY7Z5cFfZg,1,0,4,6erlP4I_WijivBji5JusfA

So we ended up with-
Apps-
Seared Foie Lyonnais - rich beyond belief... foie was perfectly seared... the balance of the dish was perfectly complementary to the foie. 
King Crab Crepe- so good... buerre blanc and sunny side egg combined with the crab was a flavor explosion.  
Entrees-
Lamb Rack Frites- perfectly cooked, well seasoned... the chickpea frites were interesting in a good way.
Sole Meunière- nice and delicate... decent, but the weakest dish of the night.

Our server was great and brought out bread and butter promptly.  It would have been better if the baguette was warm.  Had the bloody mary which was a featured drink, nothing special about it.

We started with the escargots.  Honestly, was a bit disappointed as the order only had 4 escargots and previous pictures on Yelp showed 6.  They were tasty but very small.  For our main course we ordered, the croque madame, nutella sticky bun, and French toast.  The egg on the croque madame was perfect, runny and warm.  The French toast is huge.  It's definitely a dish that can be shared.  Really liked how they were able to keep the inside soft and custardy and the contrast of the almond brittle and vanilla mascarpone was perfect.

We started off with a couple of specialty cocktails - I can't for the life of me remember their names but I think one was called a Great Woman or something along those lines.  It was a pink egg white drink and on top of the egg one they had a B on it in pink...nice touch for sure!  

We started with the escargot and seared foie gras.  Both were really rich dishes for sure!  The seared foie gras was perfectly cooked on a bed of rice and red cabbage.  As it was so rich I actually ate a little baguette with it to cut the flavor a bit.  The escargot wrapped in puff pastry was good but the garlic over powered it a bit.  

For entrees we shared the french onion soup and parisian gnocchi.  We are suckers for amazing french onion soup and this one didn't disappoint.  They have add ons like an egg or short rib but I think it is delicious on its own.  The last dish we had was the Parisian Gnocchi...and wow was that amazing.

Their egg Benedict is amazing and they really stand out because instead of your regular english muffin, they used croissant as the  base where where they topped it off with the egg and ingredients. If you really wanna go ballin, I would say get the lobster(but they have 4 other choices: PARIS HAM,BEEF BOURGIGNON,SMOKED SALMON, SURF AND TURF) because it's just so damn good. However, I have finally tried their hunter's waffle which is amazing and it's pretty much another version of egg benedict but instead they have it w/ duck confit. The duck is so flavorful, tender, and tasty. 
Some other recommendations would be mussels and frites, chicken french dip, french onion soup(make sure you add the périgord truffle, braised short rib & poached egg for a few extra bucks to really elevate the soup. I won't go into the mussels and frites which is self-explanatory but the chicken french dip is really good. Most of the dishes doesn't look like it comes w/ a lot but a lot of their dishes are really hearty and heavy that when you finished it, you would be full. The bread is so good, the chicken is so flavorful, the ""dip"" goes so well w/ it, the mushroom bread budding is lovely. The side of salad really helps with this dish considering it's so heavy.

Anyway, Bardot has become one of my favorite lunch/brunch place at a good price and very filling. I would recommend it to anybody who would ask me what to eat at vegas as a must.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,1,0,5,FE_sV0mXnGCPYZ7sAagIbQ

Let's start with lobster croissant, this dish doesn't keep up with the price I paid,$32. You expect the croissant to be crispy and buttery and when you put lobster on the top, a good chef should consider it might get soggy and try to do something about it. However, it didn't and you even can see watery croissant because of  water from lobster. Don't even mention about hunter's waffle, it tastes exactly like lobster croissant just changed the lobster to duck confit because the sauce they used is the same. It is like playing Lego you put stuffs you need and do nothing to balance the ingredient.

The execution however, was less than ideal I must say.

- Onion Soup Gratinée with Périgord truffle, braised oxtail, soft poached egg -$25
- King Crab Crêpe - buckwheat crêpe, wild mushrooms, normandy beurre blanc $16
- Mussels Marinières - garlic butter, dolin vermouth, warm baguette $26

A small baguette and salted butter were served first, and the baguette was cold - not fresh out of the oven, not even warmed up. A simple way to tell if a restaurant cares about details, if at all serving a hot bread counts as details.

The Onion Soup Gratinée was good, but to enjoy the deluxe version with those ingredients like truffle, oxtail and poached egg, we had to pay double.

King Crab Crêpe was also an interesting concept. As it's aptly categorized as Hors-d'uvre, it was pretty small. The wild mushrooms were a bit too salty, but it's well done overall.

The flavor of Mussels Marinières was good, but the mussels were undercooked - almost raw. Not only that, it was cooked unevenly - one part of the shellfish was cold and another was warm. It struck me as a failure.

And they didn't bring me a bowl for empty shells. Well... how was I supposed to eat them without it?? I was so curious that I decided to see when they would realize if I put those empty shells to a bread plate and... as I almost expected, it was when I finished the plate 99% and the bread plate was about to unleash an avalanche with the mountain of empty shells.

The food was a OK, service was less than average, and payout $85 including tax and tip. Will return? I don't think so - we have better options.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,9,2,2,wWpVid5xyQ67BW370ySdhg

We started with a few items to share like their escargot which is a little different from the traditional plates/skillets with circular dents to hold the snails. These were not drenched in butter/sauce and were still delicious. I should also mention that their complimentary baguettes were delicious with butter.

I decided to order the Chicken French Dip. I'm usually not a fan of french dip sandwiches, but this one stood out to me because it had mushroom bread pudding in it. One bite was like a mouthful of Thanksgiving except the turkey part. When you think about it, it makes sense: the luscious bread pudding texture with mushrooms, and the haricot verts (much like a green bean casserole) and with pieces of chicken that were moist (unlike dry turkey). I was really happy with my choice.

I also had a bite of their Hunter's waffle which is another popular choice with duck confit in it. Think of an eggs benedict but with a waffle and duck confit.

Service was fantastic. Our waitress kept stopping by to warm up my coffee and they were absolutely attentive with picking up plates and even providing us recommendations. It's kind of a hard choice between whether or not I like Bardot more than Bouchon, but if you really want more pastries, go for Bouchon.

In the middle of the meal Matej came by to check in on us and we let him know how delicious everything was. Loved everything from the yummy softened salted butter and baguette to the savory sweet Foie Gras and the French toast was the best my husband has ever had, everything we had was delicious.

Lauren C or Lucky Charm ~ either way L.C. and I have good luck at our dining adventures.  Located on the second floor of Aria, it's a treasure!  When you receive impeccable service with incredible food, I'll be back for more.

Our dining excursion led us to sample several hors d'oeuvres as well as desserts.  Let's start with the hors d'oeuvres.  The Prime Steak Tartare is ground to order and served with a sauce verte, egg yolk on top with gaufrette potatoes.  The steak tartare is presented beautifully.  When you break the yolk to ooze into the tartare, it's perfect.  The Onion Soup Gratinee couldn't be better with the cave-aged gruyere covering the dish.  The winner of our starters for me is the King Crab Crepe.  Perfectly delicate with black trumpet mushrooms, sunny side egg. The normandy cider beurre blanc on the side could've been smothered on everything I ate.  I fell in love with this sauce.  

Onto the fun stuff, Dessert.  We probably went overboard but we that's our thing.  We split 3... yes 3.  The Mille Feuille, Apple tart and Cherry Clafouti.  All had an intense and rich flavor.  Each had their own unique characteristic.  What stood out was the Cherry Clafouti.  It's warm cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream on top.  The cherry pudding was more like a cherry bread pudding.  Very sweet and savory.  The pistachio ice cream complimented the dessert so perfectly.

A moment later Matej came up and handed us waters and said going to be hot out there today,  got to keep hydrated. Next day he remembered us and thanked us for coming back and checked on us personally. Then later sent us some complementary birthday/Father's Day desserts.

Overall I loved the theme this place has going for it. It's kind of tucked away in the Aria. Most foot traffic wouldn't even know it was there unless they were looking for it.


Food:
Our cocktails were delicious.

The bread they serviced was not sliced. I know its a small gripe but it can make a world of difference in an upscale restaurant. It also didn't help that the bread was baked to the point where cutting / breaking it at a table just made a big mess.

We had the gnocchi and filet mignon.

The gnocchi was good but not great. I was expecting more based on reviews.

The filet mignon I ordered medium and came out well. We were short on time so I didn't bother having it corrected. The meat overall was still good for it not being cooked to my liking.


Service:
Service was outstanding. We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. Our waiter was very informative about the menu. I'm not sure if this was apart of the experience but our photos were taken by a worker. She had said she would get us a copy before we were done with dinner but we were gone before she came back.

Overall:
I definitely will give Bardot another chance when I'm in town. I would definitely recommend it. I would also recommend not rushing through dinner here as well.",l5cxtEb38HqqSqXJdG1_lw,0,1,3,x7DRYQz1-32ArFXD2gpK1A

Michael Mina's French Brasserie located in the Aria Hotel is beautifully decorated Parisian style which transports you to a cafe in Paris. The first Brunch item was the Paris Eggs Benedict which was a variation of the traditional Eggs Benedict which is usually served on an English Muffin. Instead the eggs were nestled on top of a buttery flaky croissant. Must I say this was perfection and was Simply divine. We also ordered the French Toast which was made of Brioche and had a caramelized top. It was served with Vanilla Marscapone, candied almonds and instead of maple syrup it was served with orgeat syrup which is a sweet syrup made of almonds. Simply divine. For the side dish I had to try the macaroni gratinee.  This dish was a take on Macaroni and cheese but elevated to new heights. All of the Macaroni are perfectly aligned standing upright. How, you ask, I have no idea, but who cares the taste was amazing. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas.

It better be melt in your mouth orgasmic for that amount of money! And it truly was a very average filet, HOWEVER, after requesting it be redone, they did as I asked, fixed the problem and even took the item off the bill, so they more than compensated for the deficit.  I didn't mind paying for it but it just needed to be a $54 steak.  If you're gonna charge that, make it worth it.

The French toast is also good but MASSIVE so I suggest you share it with at least one other person. My boyfriend loves the fruit plate, hunters waffle, and prime rib sandwich. The quiches here are also to die for, especially the mushroom and goat cheese!

For dinner, we come here less often, but we enjoy the escargot appetizer, and the steaks are decent. They have lots of special tasting/meal menus that change on the regular! 

The reason this restaurant has 4 instead of 5 stars is the service. It is hit or miss. There are times where the service has been average, and bearable, but there have been two times where the service has been absolutely AWFUL (I won't bore you with the details).

My friend made reservations about a month before since it can get pretty busy on weekends. They have an extensive wine list and let us try a sample before we made our selection. We decided on wonderful Vouvray. Service was impeccable. Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  

For appetizers I tried the escargot which was different then how it's traditionally prepared. There are 6 that come on a wood plank served in a puff pastry topped with a pesto sauce. It was very flavorful. My date got the foie gras which was accompanied by a thick, crusty bread. Very tasty! For our main entrees we tried the lamb chops which were cooked and seasoned perfectly.

I ordered the Warm Beet Salad to share with a friend and a French Toast all for myself. Let me say that the French Toast can EASILY be split two ways. It's massive! The fluffy toast was served with crunchy almond brittle, vanilla mascarpone, and orgeat (almond-y) syrup. It's a well thought out dish and the perfect combination of dense, moist, and caramelization. 
The beet salad was pretty good. The vinaigrette was subtle and didn't take flavor away from the beets, goat cheese, or arugula. For an $18 salad, attention to detail was expected and accordingly presented. 
The coffee was pleasant and the servers made sure my cup was never empty. I was impressed with their speed despite a busy Sunday brunch crowd. 

To add icing on the already pleasant experience, Bardot presented each diner with a complimentary cinnamon roll in celebration of their 1 year birthday.

1761162,2015-01-26,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"A beautifully decorated room. Warm colors & festive, instantly transporting you to  Paris, France. 
My friends & I were escorted to a nice comfortable room with a big 4 top table. Thank goodness it wasn't a little table!  That part of a Paris Brasserie was left out of our experience. 
Our first course was the Pate de Champagne, Foie Gras Parfait, & Fruits de Mer. LOVED the Pate de Champagne with the port wine gelee. The perfect combo of sweet & salty. I couldn't get enough of the melt in your mouth love. The Foie Gras Parfait had a textbook European Foie Gras  texture I liked it but I do prefer the Pate creaminess. My friends who are from Europe absolutely loved it. The cornichons that acompanied the Foie Gras balanced the dish with it's salty sour flavor. And of course the Fruits de Mer was lovely in presentation as well as taste. My taste buds were soooo happy!
Our mains were Lobster Thermador & Rack of Lamb. The presentation of the Lobster Thermador was beautiful. 2 huge pieces of Lobster (shared by 2) topped with Brandy cream Bernaise. The Bernaise sauce was whipped to look like a cloud of French heaven. It was lovingly baked on the 
Lobster. I was sad that I didn't order that till my Lamb Crown Roast was put before me. 
Lamb was done perfectly. It was juicy & spiced just right. It was supposed to be for 2 people but the portion was so huge 3 could've been very satisfied with this delectable entree. I was suprised at the vegetable that  accompanied my Lamb. I thought that I hated Eggplant. The Chef & his staff proved me wrong. It was a puree of Eggplant topped with pesto sauce. It was such an amazing balance of flavors, salty & sweet. We also had mushrooms a la grecque & green beans almondine. The mushrooms were soooo delicious I really wished I didn't have to share that dish. It was heavenly & melted in my mouth. Not that they were mushy, but so perfectly cooked. Sadly the green beans were overly salted. So mush that no one ate much of it. 
The last course was our 2 desserts. Coupe de Glacee which was the sorbet of the day, Strawberry topped with merengue. You would think eh, sorbet, so pedestrian. But this presentation was amazing! It was so unusual I actually took a picture of it. I'm not one of those camera foodies, but this desert looked so good. The merengue topping looked like little clouds of heaven. Not overly sweet, perfectly crunchy & yummy. The sorbet under the merengue had little bits of strawberry whipped into it. Aria has perfected the sorbet, what else can I say. We also had the classic Creme Caramel topped with a spun sugar cookie. It was also quite delicate & great with our after dinner espressos.  
The service was exceptional. The Bardot staff was so attentive, patiently explaining our questions. I really appreciate good service which in my town is sadly lacking at most strip venues. These professionals were at the top of their craft. Cudos to them! 
I was so happy that I took my friends to this restaurant. It's a gamble to go to a restaurant in the first weeks of a grand opening. A lot can go wrong as the staff is still working out the kinks.

+ Escargot. 6 individual puff pastures ($18). Each one is packed with butter/garlic flavor! I'm not sure how they did this and still in awe about it because escargot is typically doused in butter and garlic but instead, the butter and garlic flavors are all embedded into the puff pastry. When you take a bite into the puff pastry he the escargot itself is actually pretty hot but the outside (the puff pastry) is warm.

+ Smoked Salmon Croissant Benedict (FTW!). I am SO GLAD I went with this because I was debating between this and the lobster option. I love salmon but was told both were equally as good, just depends on what you're craving. The smoked salmon, hollandaise and croissant are all buttery goodness! They all pair so well together and the quality of the smoked salmon is like nothing I've ever had! The croissant isn't your typical croissant, but made to compliment the fillings (i.e. Egg, kale and of course salmon in this case).

The coffee is good too! I tried a few other things but can't remember since it's been some time since my visit - BUT - the quality of food here is amazing for the price!

We ordered four dishes to share:

Escargot in Puff Pastry: These were incredibly good - just four bite-sized pieces unfortunately.  You would never know you're eating snails, so definitely newbie friendly.

Smoked Salmon: This dish was an assemble-yourself project. Lots of slices of smoked salmon, a small loaf of bread, pre-sliced, avocado, and cream cheese. You basically make your own sandwich.  Pretty good - salmon was fresh, not ""fishy.""  

Hunters Waffle: This savory dish has two perfectly poached eggs and some really good shredded duck confit - almost a play on a conventional Benedict.  

Seasonal Fruit Platter: A surprisingly good appetizer that could double as a healthy  dessert.  Buckwheat sugar-coated beignets, a cake-like side of yogurt parfait with nuts and a sweet crust, and an assortment of fresh fruit including grapes, pineapples, figs, strawberry, and passionfruit!  I liked the yogurt parfait the best - better than cheesecake!

The French onion soup was a special favorite, and might truly be the best version of this soup I've ever had. Even the broth was scrumptious. But the goblet it comes in is HUGE. Share this one!

The tuna tartare was a pleasant surprise! I'm not usually a fish fan, so I was delighted to find this dish so tasty. 

The duck wings with orange sauce are out of this world! Just do yourself a favor and order it, and don't forget to dunk a bite in the yummy hollandaise sauce served in a little orange half. Mmmmm!

The filet mignon was perfection. So tender, so tasty. And the fries served with it (frites) were so rich and delectable -- no doubt thanks to the beef fat they are cooked in. 

For dessert, I tried the rum cake and the creme brûlée. The rum cake was a bit strong for me, but that creme brûlée was fantastic. It hardly lasted a full minute on the table before being gulped up.

We made dinner reservations for our first night in Vegas and we felt like we were taken to Paris with fine ingredients, French decor, and our spectacular and charming server! 

Even though the menu isn't too extensive, we were unsure of what to order at first. Everything sounded so good. We finally decided to share the grilled duck wings a l'orange and bone marrow appetizers, beets salad, and Parisian gnocchi with a side of fois gras. 

We had to add the fois gras after reading several good reviews and my goodness, it was just fatty delicacy! My hubby loved it. The Parisian gnocchi was fluffy and pillowy soft. I thought the gnocchi and fois gras combination made that particular dish a bit on the heavy side, especially with the addition of cream. But it was a small portion size so it wasn't hard to finish. The shaved black truffles was also a nice touch to the dish. 

I loved how the beets salad had huge chunks of red and orange beets. The vinaigrette and baked Brie and goat cheeses were a nice touch. We really liked that dish. 

The bone marrow was also fatty goodness as I try to scoop up every ounce of it with the thick toast. I thought there was little bone marrow for the price and wished for more of it than bread. 

I've never had duck wings before but it was meaty (doesn't look like it in the pictures) and had a nice sweet glaze that combines well with the cream that had a hint of orange flavor.

Standouts include their cheese (duh), charcuterie, fresh oysters, escargot, and any incarnation of terrine or foie gras. I'm sure their entrees are great, but I'd go wild with multiple appetizers instead. My next visit will include the beef tartare and onion soup for sure.

You can't go wrong with their brunch options. Mussels have a great, complex broth and a massive mountain of a portion.

We stopped by earlier to confirm that we wanted to spend our anniversary evening at Bardot and upon inquiring about a particular dish that we love there from past experiences, we discovered that it was served only for brunches, not dinners.   We thought that was that.  But the front hostess actually called out a server to discuss the item with us to confirm that we were speaking about the same item.  We made the reservation.

Upon arrival in the evening, we were promptly seated.   We were properly greeted and taken care of.  I ordered a rib eye steak but it came out overcooked a bit.  But at the luxary price that I paid for it, I returned it to the kitchen and asked for the lamb chops.   The manager, Mr. Anthony Carideo - general manager - came to my table and in one of the most excellent exhibitions of proper customer care, was nice, communicative, not overly drippingly fake, and admitted fault - immediately - ""it was overcooked - I looked at it and it was cooked medium well"" (I ordered medium).   We chatted a bit about life, and he appropriately moved on.  The chops arrived and as the rest of the food, including my wife's and our other dishes, and drinks, they were excellent - fantastic.

What doesn't need to happen is a CHAUVINIST SUPERVISOR WORKING IN VEGAS at the 21st century. RAYMOND came to apologize on behalf of the BARDOT Brasserie, my friend and I were sitting at the bar, I had the soup and I'm also a female, Raymond came to us introduce himself to my friend (the male) shook his hand and then waved at me, I guess to acknowledge my existence and then apologized to my friend (the male) for the soup he never ate, didn't give me a second look and left. 
I was and still am furious, by the way I'm not insecure, I am not a weak woman and I don't consider myself an active feminist but to be treated like I'm a piece of something sitting next to a male by a restaurant's CHAUVINIST SUPERVISOR after I choose to spend my money there (yes, believe it or not I pay for my share) is unacceptable.
 As for the rest, most food was ok, Steak Tartare and Foie Gras Parfait were really good and Jason's service at the bar that was impeccable, if not for that encounter with that idiot (accuse my language) I would probably agree with the 4 stars review but I did meet that supervisor and I'm still furious, they don't deserve our money especially when there are so many other options, maybe even owned by women, here's an idea for you.",-T_bPiPFewmBc7exND1txQ,0,0,1,4YjPWkQ0alCzk68Ux0zvhA
1916420,2017-04-17,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Continuing our endless mission of finding cheese and charcuterie plates, we ended up at Bardot for a nice dinner. 

From the start, the service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. Our server helped us narrow down our cheese selection and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. We live in wine country and wanted to venture out from the familiar California wines of Napa and Sonoma. We were looking for something oaky, buttery, and smooth...with a twist. The sommelier guided us to a nice bottle of 2012 Louis Jadot Meursault, a Chardonnay. 

The wine was just what we were looking for.  It had a smooth buttery taste with a touch oak and a hint of mouthfeel.  

Our cheese and charcuterie plates were excellent. The cheese selections were a tad small, but they tasted great.    The charcuterie plate was sized well and in both cases, the accompaniments provided fun additional flavors. 

Our main dishes were a major let down. We had the salmon with lentils and gnocchi. The fish was cooked well, flakey with crispy skin, but was a touch heavy on the salt.  The lentils were too salty to eat. I liked the flavor profile they were going for but after two bites and a bitter face, I was done. 

The gnocchi was also too salty.  Parmesan dishes are usually salty, but this was over the edge. On the plus side, the gnocchi was very tender. The asparagus was woody and stringy. 

I debated to give this restaurant 3 or 4 stars.  The main dishes were some of the worst I've had at any of the nicer restaurants in Vegas, but the service was excellent and our appetizers were really good.  I would like to hope that my experience was an off night for the chef.

Sharing is caring so I got to sample several appetizers and entrees.  For starters, we tried the charcuterie platter ($27).  It was good; nothing too special.  The escargots bardot ($17 for six) were a bit disappointing because I thought the pastry shell and chartreuse butter overpowered the texture and flavor of the escargots.  The foie gras parfait was one of our favorites!  It was very smooth and delicate.  The port gelee's sweetness helped balance its earthy flavor.

For entrees, I shared the herb crusted Alaskan cod and pork chop with my sister. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. You can tell they brine their chops.  I also tried my cousin's sea bass and immediately understood why it's one of the signature dishes. D#@$% was that fish delicious.  Too bad we didn't offer to split our entrees with her too! Lol.

Oh, if you're a wine enthusiast, you will be happy to know that they offer an impressive collection.  But, it's not uncommon to see bottles of wine being sold in the four to five digit range.  I wonder if they run your credit card before you're allowed to order a $30K bottle?

1988892,2015-04-09,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"We first found out about Bardot Brasserie through Jeannie and a former college dorm mate of mine.  Jeannie had been snatched up from Aria's Five50 to run the Brasserie.  We went the first time on the second day the Brasserie was open.  The interior truly looks like a period Parisian brasserie, from the wood used inside to the wait staff's uniforms.  We started with the oysters on the half shell (to be honest we try to always start with oysters on the half shell), and then split the crown rack of lamb.  We paired each course with a different glass of wine - the by the glass menu is extensive, and reasonably priced.

We came back a few months later, and our second visit confirmed Bardot as our absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The wait staff was beautifully attentive without hovering.  The poured wine portions were generous.  The food was magnificent yet again.  Everything was timed to perfection. Right  as we completed our cocktails, the oysters were brought out to the table, and our empty glasses were replaced with a beautifully flinty chablis.  We had a nice amount of time to eat the oysters, and talk and engage our neighbors at the next table (their daughter was adorable).  Our main course arrived shortly after the oyster remains were whisked away, accompanied by another, different glass of wine.  Again, everything perfectly cooked and absolutely scrumptious.  Jeannie graced us with her presence, and I think we really gushed with how much we enjoyed her restaurant, and how impressively she runs her kitchen.

At the end of dinner, Jeannie sent out her signature dessert - an apple tart.  Oh. My. God.  It was completely fantastic.

This is a pricy option for a late dinner in the Aria area without having to eat at the Aria cafe (slightly less slow) downstairs.

My fiance started the evening with a drink I've only been able to jot down as the ""Blood and Sand Scotch drink"". It was orangey and smooth and finished in a few minutes. 

The beef tartare was a delicious starter. The chips that came with it were super yummy and I was a bit sad we didn't ask for more chips. No matter. I had the pork chop for dinner which was smokey and thick and a lot of meat to put in my mouth. The horseradish mashed potatoes that came with my dish was buttery and creamy and soooo good. My fiance had the flat iron steak which also had a smokiness to it and was nice and tender. 

For a not very busy part of the night, it was difficult flagging down a server for water and drank refills, so I think the wait staff could put in a little more effort in being attentive.

We thought an early happy hour would be a good choice because that would give us the ability to experience some food and drink without it being too busy during peaks hours. 

We sat at the bar and shortly after were approached by a wonderful and polite bartender (I didn't get her name). We ordered a glass of white wine and a French 75, along with the salmon tartare. The drinks tasted fabulous, and when the salmon arrived, we were both impressed. The presentation and the taste were extraordinary. We later ordered the steak tartare and were also impressed! It was a really fun experience, and having been to France several times, a very authentic one.

I had the escargot appetizer. Each piece was like a little pillow of savory flavor.  We had some other shared appetizers at the table but my memory is failing me what they were. 

For my entree I chose the mussels. Delicious, if not a little gritty. A friend had the salmon with lentils and this was amazing. So much flavor from two items typically lacking in any kind of taste. Definitely a stand-out on the menu. 

And oh my god the chocolate macaron. It's definitely for sharing. But do it. Seriously. Save room for it or just take it to go. Vegas creates lots of regrets, and not having this macaron for dessert will be high on that list",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,0,0,4,fyNWFRYrjhVkSQcal1oCsQ

We came in with a group of 16 girls for brunch on a Saturday morning. They had split us into two separate tables- which was fine we didn't complain about that and sat down right away happy to be there. It was all downhill from there. We started off by ordering the bottomless rose. Our waiter walked off and came by later to take our food order, and we nicely asked him if our rose was on the way he told us to relax. Quite a rude comment to say to a paying customer, especially when we are asking a question about our meal. He proceeded to make rude comments throughout the meal. He told us to relax upwards of 10 times, commented on someone ""drinking too fast"", told someone else to ""relax with the wine"". He made condescending comments each time he came to the table. He wouldn't let us edit our order for a salad to not have beets in it (which seems very strange considering people have allergies). Every time we asked for something he told us to relax. When we asked for ketchup he told us to relax. Perhaps his worst comment of the meal was telling my friend she wasn't eating enough food, I don't think it's his place to comment on someone's eating habits. The service got so bad I had to speak with a manager half way through the meal, and while he listened to my concerns, he didn't do anything about it. He didn't have the waiter apologize, and he didn't even give us the option to leave our own tips. Our bill arrived and the tip was already included, which he most definitely didn't deserve that amount after we complained about our poor service.

I convinced my friends to come for weekend brunch after a wedding rehearsal. We had made reservations but had to add some extra people last minute; the hostess was very accommodating and we got our table in 15min.

They started us with complimentary French bread and vveeerrry smooth butter which was yum.  Shortly after, our food came.  Then the meal turned...average.  I had ordered an appie and an entrée - both came at the same time instead of one after the other, which was kind of odd.  So I ended up eating my Fois Gras with the ruby port gelee and country bread alongside my Hunter's Waffle which I was worried would be getting cold while I ate my appie.  Hm... As for the dishes itself, I don't know if I played it too safe with my dish selections as I didn't feel wowed by either dishes.  The Fois Gras was smooth and the ruby port gelee provided a nice jelly texture mixed in, but overall taste was just OK and not memorable.  I've had better, and probably won't get it again if I come back.  The portion was huge though as I needed help finishing this dish!  The Hunter's Waffle was like a duck confit benedict on waffle; it was nice, but I expected better.  Each component tasted good separately but the combination of the parts didn't elevate the dish.  I tried my friend's Beef Bourgignon Croissant Benedict and we both agreed, it was good but also like the Hunter's Waffle, the flavors failed to combine into a memorable dish.

For the price point, we expected more. Also expected more on the service side.  Maybe it was just because I didn't order a drink (?) as I had 1 glass of water the entire meal not refilled.  I hope my friends at the other end of the table who ordered the bottomless Rose had more luck getting refills.",mNYQl3d2wFDWZiZa7VD6og,0,0,3,Ae3XGKyPaOLKTvJK8WVTZg

This place is an extremely romantic place to have dinner! As for my case i went here with friends and it was really amazing. The seafood tower (appetizer) we ordered was amazing. The waitresses explained each seafood's origin and my goodness were they fresh!  The crab, shrimp, lobster, and oysters were just spot on! I personally also got the french onion soup and for me it was a tad salty but the taste was really good. The caramelized onions just melted in my mouth and with the sharp swiss cheese its a perfect bite. 

The main entree that i ordered was the steak and frites. Their steak options are limited which i like because id rather that restaurants be amazing at a few things than mediocre at many. The steak was grilled perfectly and seasoned nicely. The sauce that i chose to pair my steak with was a bearnaise sauce which was quite nice. 

The dessert that i got was the apple tarte tartin which was a good way to finish up a heavy meal *.* I also got a coffee to go with the apple tarte which made it even more divine. Their coffee is amazing so make sure to pair with any of their desserts because they are a bit sweet. 

The price I would say is pretty fair considering the ambiance, quantity, quality, and location. Lucky for me i did not have to pay but had i had to my bill would have been about $100. Nevertheless i would come back! It was really tasty and quality is quite amazing. Also thanks to the amazing staff here for being so friendly and helpful to us!

Stand outs included the escargot (best I ever had), foie gras parfait, the seasonal specials (a salad and a ravioli-type of thing topped with truffle), mac and cheese, the scallops and the wellington. And of course the fresh bread, delicious!

You can't go wrong picking Bardot as one of your vacation restaurant choices or as a place for locals to celebrate on The Strip.",UTc5tce7YnLNYop0Bz24cg,1,0,5,Mb-prO6D-TEpVVcus5de2g
2291701,2017-01-08,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"In all fairness I want to start this off by saying that I really wanted my dining experience to be more positive than it turned out to be, but after my experiences with Bardot (even post visit) I'd be doing a disservice if I rated this any higher.

So on a rare instance the wife and I ventured to Vegas to ring in Christmas and due to the strip being cluttered with people we decided to find something ""local"" as we were staying at Monte Carlo to test our palette with and that lead us to Bardot on a random walk back to the room, but had I known what was in store for us I'd have kept walking.

Earlier in the day I had my heart set on ordering a lobster to sort of spoil myself since it was a holiday and I looked at the 1/2 Maine lobster here which from Yelpers of previous looked to die for. As we ordered, I came to find out they were out of lobster for the night (after the fact) due to their shipment not being up to the manager's (Robert) standard. That believe it or not was a plus for me through this whole ordeal. I do appreciate the fact they want to put out quality dishes bad as I was craving for some lobster. 

What fell horribly flat for me was just about everything from that point on. After hearing of the whole lobster ordeal, as an alternative I just went ahead and ordered the 1/2 dozen wild Mexican shrimp. Call me crazy, but a $22 price tag for only 6 shrimp does seem a bit outlandish to me. To its credit, the shrimp was fresh and tasted pretty good, but in the end I was left desiring more bang for those bucks. I could've found a shrimp cocktail for half the price and possibly double the taste somewhere else, it is Vegas and all right?

My main cause of disapproval was our waiter, Jesus (not good when you remember names). I felt even from the initial point of the meal he was condescending to both myself and especially my wife. All through the meal he made very snarky yet sarcastic comments about various things and we both felt as the meal wrapped up we didn't deserve to even be dining there. We stayed respectful and just focused on each other, but totally inappropriate on all levels!

After the meal we mutually agreed to call back and at the very least make the manager aware of our experience. We weren't looking to be compensated for anything as were just glad it's over, but even a shred of empathy from the manager (Robert) would've given me some shred of hope as I write this. Just his overall approach to our feedback was standoffish and he brushed it off with a very arrogant attitude. Rather than apologize for any of this he ended up simply comping my portion of the meal which I mean was a good gesture, but 100% truth here; all I wanted was an apology for how HIS server spoke to us that night.

Vegas is a city where change is always evident and I do hope Aria makes note of situations like this because as much as Bardot is a reflection of itself, it is in the grand scheme of things a reflection of Aria as well and I actually love it there for gambling purposes and even the rooms, but pardon et moi if the dining experiences have even me saying au revior!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,11,1,1,RMjfCBu2-JXIVRu1hZ8WyQ

It's hard to find good French food/restaurant in LA so I was pretty excited to check out Bardot. The inside is very nice, romantic and dim. It looked very Parisian. As you are seated they give you complimentary baguette, which is amazing! You know it's a darn good bread if when you break it you can hear the crackle, but still be soft in the inside. Very fresh and just what a baguette should be. The butter was standard but even better when you added a pinch of sea salt. We all were in the mood for a bunch of appetizers, rather than big meals per se. 

_Bardot Salad ($14) Gem lettuce, Dijon vinaigrette. Simple, yet very tasteful. The lettuce were huge, fresh and crisp. The vinaigrette was a tad sweet, acidic and tart. I love the lingering taste of the Dijon. A bit pricey for a very simple salad with just some greens, but also very good if you want something to start with.
_Foie Gras Parfait ($18) Chilled mousse of la belle foie gras, ruby port gelée grilled country bread. This was an automatic for all of us. I mean can I get a amen or an amen! The 4 thick slices of baguette were crisp, yet soft in the outside. The parfait was silky, and not gamey. The ruby port on top helped to cut out any gamey flavor that may linger and give it a sweetness and tartness flavor that is always the best when eating a parfait. One of my favorite dishes of the night! A bit rich but worth unbuttoning your pants for :)
_Escargots Bardot ($19) Wild burgundy snails wrapped individually in puff pastry, toasted hazelnuts chartreuse-garlic butter. This was pretty tiny and came in 6 servings. I got to eat one, although I wish I could have had more not only because It tasted so good but I felt one wasn't enough to really capture the flavor as they are so tiny. The puff pastry was nicely fried and a very thin layer at that, a little buttery and flaky. The snail flavor was a tad chewy, but overall cooked perfectly. The texture almost seemed more like mushrooms, if you did not know, you would not guess you were eating snails.
_Black Truffle French Fries ($14) When we first got this our waitress made a mistake and brought us regular fries. My friend and I kept thinking and saying not only do I not taste truffle at all, I don't even smell it. Glad to know we switched it off for actual truffle fries. When it came you can already tell by the color and aroma it was truffle. The aioli was great and paired perfect with the fries, it actually brought out the truffle flavor more. I will say, our tables all agreed the fries were so darn oily! As I ate just one fry I can already see all the oil on my fingertips. 
_Burrata Salad. This was a bit bland. The salad was more of about 4 small lettuces, a few snap peas, a few asparagus and 4 tiny slices of peaches. I will say the peaches were the highlight of the dish. Not even the burrata, but the peaches. They were so fresh and sweet. The burrata itself was a bit small and the texture was a bit disappointing. It did not have that silky and elasticity to it. I felt some balsamic or some type dressing would have made this a bit better. 
_Heritage Chicken Roti ($34)  1/2 free-range chicken, mushroom bread pudding, green beans, sauce vin jaune. Good sized half chicken. The chicken was very moist and well cooked. Not dry whatsoever and the seasoning was pretty spot on. The skin was perfectly crisp, although I found it pretty salty. I can see why the chicken was a bit lighter on seasoning, since the skin itself was more on the salty side, it was a good balance. The mushroom bread pudding did not really do it for me. It was heavy, oily and buttery and did not compliment the chicken whatsoever, it was just random and unnecessary. The green beans were good. 
_Chocolate Macaron ($13) French chocolate cookie, valrhona chocolate mousse. Being a bit chocolate fan, when I saw this on yelp, I had to get it. The dessert was the main reason I wanted to try this restaurant. This was a very huge portion, think of those small ones by Lette, but on steroids. As it came out, our waitress drizzled chocolate sauce all over the plate and macaron. At first bite it was divine, as well as the other few, but then it started to get real rich and heavy. I did like the texture of the macaron, it had a nice bite and the ganache was silky, but I would need to eat small bites of this and with some rest in between. I felt maybe the chocolate sauce was not necessary since it was already so rich, but regardless glad I got to try this. 
_Mille Feuille ($13) Caramelized puff pastry, vanilla crème patisserie. I must say this was pretty good but I expected more. The puff pastry was perfectly thin and crisp, which I think is the most important part of mille feuille. The cream was light and not too rich. It was good to have this with the chocolate macaron since one was way sweeter and richer than the other.

Great experience, I would recommend checking Bardot out.",1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,5,6,4,8LeH9dtJOUN6ZalAsISLMg

Service was slow, which was understandable since it was busy when we got there, but soon we realized half the tables were empty and our server was MIA. We ordered off of the summer prix fixe menu which sounded great. I went straight down the middle, starting with a classic French onion soup. The cheese and bread were the stars here. The soup itself was on the sweet side, under seasoned, and unmemorable. Next up was steak au poivre, and this was the biggest let down. The meat itself was sub par and untrimmed. In the accompanying picture, you can literally see the silver skin and gristle left on the steak. It was tough, over cooked, AND came out lukewarm. What a joke. The mille-feuille was ok, but was made by brutes with heavy hands. This delicate dish translates to thousand leaves was 4 layers of thick puff pasty too hard to cut without a knife layered with thick layers of filling. Flavor was ok, but execution was terrible. 

The winners at Bardot? The French fries and complimentary bread and butter. Everything else was embarrassingly unfortunate, especially considering Michael Mina's name on the door. If it were a more pedestrian establishment, I would have given it 3 stars, but for the $$$$, it doesn't deserve to be in the same category as other fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas.

2408795,2015-04-14,24,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Located on the promenade level of the contemporary Aria resort hotel, this newly reimagined french brasserie has all the flair of a casual street side Parisian bistro sans the French accent, of course. I made reservations for weekend brunch and strolled in at about 12:45pm to a fairly full house bustling with a variety of diners sobering up from the previous evening of debauchery I could imagine. The hostess kindly greeted me at the entrance and escorted me to the back of the restaurant where the dining tables were located. From there, I met the server who was agreeably friendly in a casual way and took my orders in a snap. 
First to arrive was the king crab crepe served with a bechamel sauce. The crepe was rich, flavorful and it was served perfectly thin and not overly bulky like some crepes I've had the displeasure of experiencing in the past. I would have liked to see more lump crab in the crepe but the amount served was sufficient to maintain the integrity of the dish. The addition of the fried egg made for a beautiful marriage of flavors and textures, which had me savoring each wonderful bite. A great start to my brunch and it whet my appetite for the subsequent dishes on my brunch line up. Next up was the lobster benedict on a light and airy puffed pastry. I was mildly disappointed when I spied what appeared to be langoustines and not lobster tail chunks. It's just a matter of preference l but I feel the lump lobster would have been a more impressive accompaniment to this delightful dish but I'm sure cost played a big role in their decision to use langoustine. All in all, it was a tasty dish and I enjoyed the use of the flakey pastry, which was a refreshing departure from the traditional English muffin. The final dish to adorn our table was the duck confit waffle benedict. Served with a citrusy blood orange maltaise, rustic root vegetable hash and perfectly poached egg, this majestic brunch dish was nothing short of stunning. The duck was warm tender and beautifully balanced in flavor. Usually a confit is typically too salty for me but this preparation was just right. The light and fluffy waffle drizzled with the maltaise sauce and the heavenly poached egg added just the right amount of decadent richness to this praiseworthy dish. #eggporn galore! 
Overall, service was agreeable, fairly attentive, and the food was reasonably paced. What Made me a fan was the food! I'd gladly return to enjoy more of that enticing brunch fare when I trek out to SinCity. 
Until then...

Have to say I found my new favorite steak tartare dish here; it was so stupid good....can't really describe how much better it is than other places that offer the same dish. The French onion soup was rather good as well, and I really, absolutely loved the Rack of Lamb. All of the food was really good. 

Our wait staff was definitely good to go. The only real complaint I could say is that the wait time on dishes was rather slow...but it's a French restaurant, so am I really complaining?",IE3BLREAGJ3y5SJLxeVciA,0,0,5,4upNCX8r0tYIDBtF2uu8Eg

As for this establishment it pretty much sucked too.  How in the world do these reviewers give 4 or 5 stars????  Maybe they all had colds and their taste buds were malfunctioning... 

First let me start that 5 stars to the waiter who dealt with our table.  He is the only great experience I had with this establishment.  Otherwise let me begin (or end) my experience with this restaurant.  After ordering our meal, it took 1 hour and a half to receive our meal.  Suffice to say there was absolutely no excuses.  The restaurant was 1/2 full!!!!  That in itself is really bad.  

Now let's not forget the ""forgetful"" appetizers.  The one that most comes to mind is the scallops that is on the tasting menu.  Who in the world serves scallops ""sliced""? Who serves scallops not seared (besides a sushi restaurant which this is not). Also they were quite chewy....

But worst of all was my main course.... A rib eye steak.  There are many ways to ruin a good cut of meat.  Over or under cook or lack of seasoning.  In my case it was lack of seasoning.  But wait.... the other shoe is about to drop.  Who in the world serves a prime piece of meat by cutting it in half and shoving it together and put's garnish to try to cover it up?!?!?!?  This was an all time low for me.

Shame on MM for opening restaurants to just put his name on it and collect a paycheck.  Doesn't he realize this affects his reputation in the long run?

We started out with the ""best butter in the world"" for an extra $5 and it was worth it. The butter was that classic French butter with a side of rock salt. It wasn't hard and easy to spread on the cut bread that was served with the butter. The tables that did not upgrade the butter had small French baguettes that also looked good but our bread was amazing. Perfect spongy texture on the inside with a crunchy crust on the outside. Definitely worth the upgrade if you like bread and butter. 

I wanted to be a little healthy before overindulging the rest of the day so I tried a side salad to start. Amazing. It had a light citrus vinegarette and very fresh lettuce. The lettuce tasted like butter lettuce but had more color to it. Simple salad but packed with flavor. 

I ordered the steak and eggs for my main. Not the most flavorful but cooked exactly medium rare like I asked for. I didn't see my steak knife and ended up using a butter knife the whole time and had no issues cutting it. Eggs were pretty standard but did look like European eggs because the yolk was more orange. 

As sides we got the thick cut bacon. Super thick cut and it was delicious. No burnt taste to it and so flavorful. We would definitely order this side again. 

Overall, great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Lots of flavor in all the food. Typical French menu with a few twists and extras to cater to Americans. Great decor. We will definitely be going back for brunch.",Orma3vjcw1RFGD__82AoQA,0,0,5,JaExymYGHRXElGnCHOnQMA

Food: 
- ""World's Best Butter"": really average; didn't taste like anything; the free butter tasted better

- Escargots Bardot: each escargot was wrapped in puff pastry - it made the snails have more of a savory taste, vs. a seafood taste; the garlic butter wasn't as noticeable as when snails are prepped more traditionally; a very novel take on a traditional dish

- Halibut: the fish pulled apart really easily and the sauce was awesome, but because halibut is a firmer fish, it felt a little under seasoned

We love the bar design, the vibe and the bustling dining room. My only complaint would be the photographer. We noticed her for the first time when we were dining there for my husband's birthday in September. It has always seemed tacky to me that fine dining restaurants in Vegas send around a photographer charging for pictures. We've always declined being photographed at other places, but since it was a special occasion, we agreed to let her take our photos. When she came back later and told us the price was $25 per picture for both print and digital, we said, ""no thanks."" She got really snotty about it and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't like my pictures."" We didn't appreciate her attitude, and I think it's ridiculous that a restaurant would charge that much money and have that customer photo strategy in 2015. We were a table of eight adults in our 30s and 40s. Why would we want 8 x 10 photo prints to carry around when we keep all of our photos on Facebook?

2535528,2017-11-17,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"As a pick for dinner from my Brother, we gathered our hungry appetites and walked through the doors of Bardot for culinary satisfaction.

Dishes tried:
- Duck wings
- Foie Gras
- Frese Salad
- Kobe bone marrow
- Onion Soup
- Escargo
- Mac and Cheese
- Beef Wellington
- Sirloin Steak

I have a healthy appetite, but this was a meal that was shared amongst six hungry adults.

The meal starts with some amazing fresh baked bread, I am a simple guy and bread and butter does not get as simple or delish as this.  The baguette is crisp yet fluffy on the inside.

Standout Apps:
- Escargo
- Frese Salad
- Onion Soup

The least favorite of the apps turned out to be the duck wings, they had too much zest for our taste and not enough flavor.

I felt the jam on top of the foie gras was too sweet and did not contrast well with the foie gras itself.  I had to sprinkle in some salt to offset the sweetness.  

My favorite dish was the Beef Wellington because it was cooked and seasoned to absolute precision by the team at Bardot.  The puff pastry was perfectly crisp and the beef to an even higher echelon of medium rare. Be prepared to pay for this work of culinary art as it took a big chunk of the final receipt.

I can't forget to mention the mac and cheese because of the preparation. If i could have I would have paid to go back to see the chef whose duty it is to align each individual piece of macaroni to stand up for this dish.  

I hate to call this out, but the cheesy restaurant photography and option to buy your photo weighed on me while I dined.  I get this is a good added revenue stream for Bardot, but it does cheapen the fine dining experience in my opinion.

We had perfect Micheladas and split Lobster Benedict with a generous serving of Maine lobster on croissants smothered in what they called a sauce Bernaise, but it had a delicious pinch of nutmeg in it that suited the shellfish. Newburgh? We also had a frisée aux lardons salad. Otherwise the eggs came with no sides. It's a dish best split like we did, like vol au vent with bacon and salad.

The atmosphere is a joy to be in, reminiscent of many bistros and brasseries in France albeit less worn and perfectly new obviously built with a nice budget! 

This was my second visit, last April my wife and I enjoyed their weekend brunch which on the plus side did offer more variety including wonderful fresh baked croissants and bottomless rosé which both were not available on this visit. 

This time around we were with our children and friends mid week. The restaurant wasn't too busy but the menu offering wasn't as grand. 

The sourdough baguette with butter imported from France is worth the extra spend. One thing i especially enjoy when going to France is the silky rich butter with a much higher fat content than we eat. Treat yourself! 

I had the onion soup gratinée which although good is a 7/10 if you've had other great ones. We live in Montréal which enjoys a French culture and there are better soups to compare this with. I will however say that it is the best in recent memory stateside. The quality of gruyere was nice and salty with a perfect crust on top and just the right amount of chew, the broth lacked some richness and there was way too much bread that soaked up a good amount of the broth. 

My wife had the Maine lobster niçoise and was very pleased. The baby gem lettuce was thoughtfully assembled on the plate with a large plump lobster claw front and center. 

Two of our party enjoyed the French herb omelette. It was incredibly cooked without a blemish or burnt spot to be seen and perfectly rolled. A few of us discussed how they prepared it, with butter in the egg or just at very low heat in a non stick pan. The side salad that accompanied the omelette was crisp and delicious and also thoughtfully assembled with all leaves pointing upward. The hash brown, was a little too dense and dry but could not put a damper on what was otherwise perfection. 

There was a croque madame and steak burger all enjoyed as well but what stood out was believe it or not a side dish that my daughter had! The macaroni mimolette gratinée is not to be missed! In essence haute Mac and cheese, it is presented as what looks like a slice of toast but is in fact macaroni noodles perfectly assembled in soldier position with a delicious cheese crust on top. The square of noodles is beautifully placed on a bed of bechamel sauce, and in addition to the presentation, the taste is divine and incredibly rich. 

While not French, chef Michael Mina has in my view made the French proud and that is not easily attainable lol!

My second trip to Bardot Brasserie left me full of humble pie.  We originally had a ""not-so-great"" experience our first time around, so we are usually very hesitant to dining with an establishment where the service and food were not hitting the usual marks.  However, I decided to give this venue another chance due to the outstanding reputation Michael Mina has as well as the fact that the GM, Roberto Liendo, personally reached out to me.   To have a restaurant succeed in Las Vegas, you need not only quality food, but a quality team upholding the standards that you strive to set and keeping such talent is often hard in a competitive market like Las Vegas.  Our meal started w/ a pleasant (and not ordered) surprise as we were sat.  The Sommelier quickly approached and poured a flute with Rose Champagne.  It wasn't overly sweet or dry champagne so it was perfect to wet our appetite for things to come.  Our Server Nicholas, came over right away with menus and seemed like he wrote them himself because of his innate ability to recall every preparation and ingredient in each dish.  Since Nicholas was so in tune with the menu, I went with my go-to methodology and let him decide what I was going to eat.  There are times where your server will push the ""special of the day"" if it's about to turn or priced a certain way to aid the bottom line/gouge the customer, however this was not the case.  He started us off with an order of the King Crab Crepe (buckwheat crepe, wild mushrooms and a Normandy beurre blanc) and a Tarte Flambee (flatbread w/ caramelized onions, gruyere, bacon lardons).  If there were only two dishes you can order at your next dining experience here, make these two the ones you choose.  The Crepe was stuffed w/ just the right amount of crab and the sauce was not too creamy or overpowering.  The pairing was spot on.  The Tarte Flambee can have its own review.  Bacon Lardons, nuff said.  We finished w/ an order of the Loup De Mer (European Seabass) and the Heritage Chicken Roti.  Normally, I don't order Chicken at restaurants since I can cook a mean bird, however I wasn't the one making the order.  So challenge accepted.  This chicken dish was out of this world.  It came with a side of mushroom & leek bread pudding that really needs to be added to the regular menu as a side as they would sell out each night because it's that irresistible.  I was informed by Nicholas that the secret of this dish is that the chicken is brined to keep it so moist prior to cooking.  The Loup de Mer was lightly grilled so the skin was a bit crispy but overall another winning dish.  If this meal taught me one thing, it was that you can't always trust first impressions.  I'm glad we gave this venue another look as the meal from start to finish, along w/ the hospitality shown by Roberto Liendo and his team was what most Restaurants should strive to achieve.

Bone Marrow - Excellent! Marinated very well and just the perfect serving.

Escargot - Tasty little morsels served in a puff pastry. A good gateway for anyone trying escargot for the first time.

French Onion Soup - Very well done. The croutons have a unique flavor that changes up the traditional dish.

My recent trip to Vegas caused me to eat at 3 different French restaruants: Bardot Brassiere, Mon Ami Gabi, and Bouchon. Bardot Brassiere was by far my favorite one.

We went there for brunch at 11AM, had reservations but the restaurant was about 1/4 empty so not sure if it's necessary. The restaurant is located inside the Aria, and is very tastefully decorated with a nice excerpt from Heminingway on the wall. The hostess quickly sat us down, and the waiter quickly came by, got us water and menus. While waiting to place our order, they brought over French bread and butter. Some of the best French bread I had, although I've had better butter (was still tasty).

I got the goat cheese and mushroom quiche, while my friends got the French Toast. The quiche is literally the best quiche I've ever had (Admittedly, I haven't had many quiches). It was rich, flavorful, and the mushrooms were absolutely scrumptious. The small salad (e.g. pieces of lettuce) that came with it were seasoned simply, but also yummy. The French toast was the largest piece of toast you'll ever see (literally it's the size of your face). It comes with some sort of caramelized nut triangle on top, some whipped butter, and an amazing syrup (I don't even know how to describe it). Every bite was delicious and rich, and given that the French toast was probably at least 1 to 2 lbs, we were unable to finish it. 

I would definitely come back here in the future if I have another chance. The Nutella sticky bun looks amazing, and I'm also a sucker for the Prime Rib French Dip.",vutxpF8i9cRJHc6ahOdJ5g,1,0,5,BRAni2V9_poIjIvRBN4H-w

Right off the bat, they serve you bread (baguette) and butter. For some reason, it was the best tasting butter I ever had.

French toast: super massive. Couldn't finish it. Highly addicting. Great texture. Crisp outside, soft middle. Mascarpone highly necessary and really does taste like vanilla bean. Seemed like the syrup had some almond undertones as well.

Croque madame: this wasn't the croque madame that resembled the one I ate in Paris, but still good. It involves a lot of bread and sauce. The salad came in whole leaves, so you have to cut it yourself or eat it like a rabbit would. The salad dressing was delicious.

Side of double cut bacon: I think it came in 4 pieces. You must eat it right away while it's still hot. Once it gets cold, it's harder to cut into. Very smoky and very salty. Good.

Side of hash browns: It's not your normal hashbrowns. They come in rectangles with an added nuance of herbs mixed into the potatoes. Super crispy outside. Soft in the inside. For some reason, this was only thing that I felt like we didn't have to order. It was okay. I eventually asked for ketchup to add some flavor to it.

The only saving grace was the Apple Tart Tantin which took a while because they make it from scratch.  Now that was excellent!  But dessert does not a French restaurant make!

Minutes of waiting for a drink, a bar tender finally asked what we wanted. 10 more minutes and our drinks were ready, but we had to drag them out of the bar since our table was ready at that point.  Got to the table where we were promptly greeted. Unfortunately, when the waiter left, it was another 20-30 minutes before he came back. He took our order and when the food came, the options were tiny and the taste was that of an everyday store bought steak. Very disappointing.   We ordered a number of different wines by the glass, one of which was full of sediment. They took it off the bill, but at $34, it was still a disappointment.

2886474,2015-04-12,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"It's been two weeks since we thoroughly enjoyed a French bistro brunch weekend in Las Vegas and the tastes and sights linger strongly in memory.

Before reviewing our Sunday brunch experience at Aria's Bardot, allow a few words about Saturday's brunch at Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris. We had been looking forward to MAG for quite a while and made reservations through Open Table. 

Three quick Mon Ami Gabi observations...
1) a seat at an open air pavilion table, while not directly overlooking the strip is still a most pleasant repast which didn't require a wait.

2) I've never seen a wait staff hustle through tight aisles so effortlessly, while balancing large trays of dishes high above their heads on extended arms and fingertips. Very impressive.

3) we had an issue with over cooked poached eggs. They were immediately replaced by not only freshly and perfectly poached eggs, but with an entirely new plate of corned beef hash (delicious, moist, well seasoned), along with a replacement of their wonderful hash browns and toast. This was true customer service...correct a mistake with an apology and a smile. Well done and much appreciated MAG!

Now, for the second half of our brunch weekend...Bardot Brasserie

While the newly designed space (formerly American Fish, also from Michael Mina) is elegant and very comfortable, there is no outside dining option as it's located on the Promenade level at Aria.

We started with the most unique Bloody Mary's we have tasted. Apparently, the barkeepers use freshly made vegetable juice and the addition of a cucumber strip in the drink adds a delightful taste and somehow lightens the drink. Delicious!

As I was about to break off a piece of the crusty loaf of French bread which was served in a paper bag, our brunch choices arrived. Previous reviews indicated that the brioche french toast was a must have dish. Have you ever been served a meal that required that you just stare at it as if you're trying to believe what you're seeing? Well, we did that. A huge thick (but light) serving which was crisp on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside. Accompanied by vanilla mascarpone and maple syrup, this, as well as the beautifully presented Swiss chard eggs Benedict made for a totally enjoyable and memorable Sunday morning treat. And there was no way we were not going to finish off that great loaf of French bread and butter.

The kicker, however was the side of bacon. Sourced from Neuske's, this must have been their triple thick bacon. A five dollar order was plenty for us to share and as good as the date glazed bacon was at MAG the previous day, the Bardot bacon was well, even better.

Excellent service...and coffee rounded out this experience.

Our bill was in the $50 range, but well worth it for such a wonderful brunch and quite frankly culinary memory. 

Our only regret was that with plans already for our remaining two evenings, we didn't get a chance to come back for what I assume would be a great happy hour. Next time for sure.",RX2VX3mG9ngyRbldLSzCkA,0,0,5,1_BECmiv8kUGKlcgQAl27g
2888365,2017-04-06,3,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Our first fine dining experience in Vegas!

Bardot came highly recommended, so we made reservations for Monday dinner. It was our anniversary so we were surprised with a signed card at check-in from Bardot staff wishing us a happy anniversary. (No other out-of-the-way gestures pertaining to our celebration though.)

Once settled, BF started off with a smokey old fashioned. He had the seat facing the bar so he was able to see the bartender making his drink. He was impressed with the way the bartender mixed his drink and with the execution of said drink. It was his favorite iteration of all the old fashioneds he has had so far. Bread service was a fresh, hot baguette with salted butter. It blew all other baguettes we've had before out of the water. Right as we finished the bread, our steak tartare starter arrived. Mix the egg yolk in with the steak tartare and use the spoon to scoop the tartare onto the chips -- the chips are too fragile to directly use as a scoop for the tartare. The slightly salty chips balance the taste of the tartare. If you still have some baguette left over, the steak tartare tastes great with it too!

We had watched the Lego Batman movie a while ago and the lobster thermidor left an impression with us. Why does Lego Batman love it so much? What is it? When we saw it on the menu, we just had to order it. Since it was a bit of a gamble, we played it safe by picking a steak for the second entree. So it turns out the lobster thermidor is super creamy -- so much that halfway through, I had to clear off the excess sauce from the lobster pieces in order to eat it. The thermidor came with an excellent side -- mashed potatoes with peas, mushrooms, etc. The flat iron steak, however, was the star of the meal. I'm trying to remember when I had that good a steak and nothing comparable come to mind. It was lean, tender, and flavorful. The meal up to this point was going to be a 3 stars kind of meal, but the flat iron knocked it up to 4 stars. The meat was delicious, but the side (beef fat fries) could've been better. The side felt too greasy and heavy compared to the lean main dish. It would've been better if they married the flat iron with the side from the thermidor. What a knockout dish that would've been! 

We couldn't leave without dessert and with the recommendation of our server, we ordered the 
kouign amann, which was topped with a scoop of ice cream. We were so full, we struggled to finish it. It was good, though it was not replacing any of our all-time fave desserts off our list.

Service was a mixed bag. Right from the get go, the table was set up, but the bench seats were full of food crumbs from the previous patrons. It was obvious they did not dust off food from bench seats while resetting tables. During our meal, it was hard to find someone to flag down to refill drinks, though they were quick to come by to ask BF if he wanted another old fashioned when he finished that drink. When our server was around, he was pretty good with conversation and recommendations. One thing I thought was weird was that if you charge the meal to your room, you don't get a receipt. We sat for quite a bit before we found our server and asked for a receipt.

Aria's concierge advertised this place as a romantic fine dining environment, but it's pretty loud, like a lounge. The noisiness makes it hard to hear each other, detracting from an otherwise excellent fine dining meal. The old fashioned drink, the bread, and the flat iron steak will remain in our memory for years to come when we think of Bardot.",wV4uhvJGok8nOR56Ex5mAg,3,6,4,DWduhCNLomqVjLv8Yp7aFg

The bar back was completely attentive and on top of it with water refills. She actually had to remind the bartender twice that I was waiting for my second cocktail, which never came. After 25 minutes of waiting, I demanded our check, which included the cocktail he never brought. I told him he never brought my drink and then he remembered, he left it sitting on the other end of the bar. He asked, ""Can I give you a to go cup so I don't have to take it off the bill?"" Needless to say, I was furious at this point. He mentioned his bosses interrupted him and he forgot about my drink. Remember, the bar back reminded him twice that I was waiting.

The bar and lounge opens early evening so it was very convenient for us to grab some drinks and bar food. 

During our bar times, we tried a few cocktails, they all tasted so good and strong. They use classic martini glasses, which is very upscale and elegant. Hubby tried French onion soup, it was very delicious and comforting. 

Our dinner was AMAZING, very slow cause it's a French restaurant, but everything came out perfectly, we really enjoyed our Christmas Day dinner! 

Starters:
French bread with butter: fresh and yummy.

Escargots pastry puff: very tender and flavorful escargots, but I never liked pastry puff too much, I always get very nervous if I have to eat carbs. Hubby loved it. 

Entrees:
Filet rare plus with French fries: a beautiful cut of filet cooked to perfection, just the way hubby liked it, housemade sauce was so good, I loved the French fries, the very best I have ever tasted! 

Branzino head and bones off, with onions and fingerling potatoes: FANTASTIC fish, so fresh and tender, flavors were very well balanced, loved it! 

Side of mushrooms: rich flavors, very delicious!

Dessert creme brûlée: it was chilled in stead of warm, very soft and sweet, so yummy. 

Bottle of reserved Perrier was so good, espresso martini was strong and tasty, hubby liked his espresso shots too. 

 It was a great dinner, they had a photographer taking photos of dining people, loved the photos she took, very cute! Definitely one of the best dining experiences we have ever had!

First off this place is gorgeous on the inside with lovely fresh flowers everywhere and a classy European bistro feel. The other yelpers were speaking truth in that this is a noisy place which can feel exciting at night if you have a loud group of friends but maybe not a good place to catch up with older parents constantly yelling 'what?'. While we looked at the menu we realized there was far more than steaks that looked good to us and we decided that the three of us would do a French style tapas and have a bunch of dishes to share that way we could taste a lot without over stuffing ourselves. I had to ask the waitress to describe the fantastic and interesting way they do their macaroni & cheese because the photos from yelp make it look like a grilled slice of honeycomb that is hard to wrap your brain around but she says they use long noodles and bundle them together. It was my goal to order this dish and yet we were too full to.  We really enjoyed the mussels, the oysters, the bone marrow the onion soup with the deluxe options of oxtail and truffle (we decided not to get the egg). We were having trouble navigating the wine list and so our server sent over sommelier who was a very knowledgeable young woman with wine stained mouth I say this NOT to be disparaging but to include the tidbit that she really is doing the work of drinking and talking about wine and she's doing it well. She was cool! She suggested a very nice cinsaut that went quite well with everything and was at a perfect temp just a bit chilly.

- French onion soup: love the top crust. It's beautifully golden, and when u open it with your fork, u feel the cheese underneath.
- prime rib eye: it's good but not the best I had. Perhaps I like it with slightly more fat.
- hunter's waffle: interesting twist from classic egg Benedict. They put duck confit in between a waffle and the runny egg. I wish the chef would consider to put some fresh green like lettuce or arugula with this dish to ""freshen"" up the taste of the whole dish.
- escargots: 4 pcs. Thought it would come in 6 pcs as I saw it from other Yelpers' photos. Regardless that, the whole dish is good.

The three accompanying sauces were amazing. The French fries were pretty darn good too.
Yelpers rave about the macaroni gratinee. It tasted fine though the reason we thought it was fine is because we both liked Kraft Dinner and this was a baked version of that very boxed dish. One would expect to pay a lot for the sides, but $15 for this is crazy.

You have to go up the escalators to the 2nd floor of the Aria and head in the direction of the buffet. The restaurant is before the buffet on the right, next to Jean Georges Steakhouse. They have a few tables outside of the restaurant but since it's inside the Aria, that's the closest to outdoor seating that you're going to get. The dress is business casual. Love the liquor rack over the bar. Simply gorgeous! BTW, HH is daily from 5-7PM in the bar area only. Spacious with very simple but classic decor and very dim lighting. The fancy bathrooms are in the back corner, close to the kitchen on the side of the entrance. 

BF was very skeptical about coming here because he is not a Michael Mina fan (he's been to a few of his other restaurants and wasn't impressed). One of my foodie besties went for Valentine's Day and loved it so I was able to convince him to go here with the group. Initially I had wanted to just come here for HH but we all had evening shows to attend so we had a late dinner reservation.

For appetizers I had the Foie Gras Parfait. While it was good, I would've liked more of the Gelee to go with it to balance it out more. There wasn't enough bread to eat with the foie gras so I used the complimentary bread which was fine. We ordered an order of the Duck a l'orange for the table that everyone devoured because they all really enjoyed it. Our friends who ordered the Onion Soup thought that it was amazing (it looked and smelled really good too!).

I had the Sauteed Skate which I would say it was more fried. I had wanted something fairly light since I had all the foie gras earlier in the meal and was a bit disappointed in the skate. It still tasted pretty good (just a bit on the dry side). Loved the pureed cauliflower. Tried some of the BFs Filet Mignon w/ Foie Gras Butter. He wasn't going to have any sauce but I wanted to try the butter so he asked for it on the side. It was ok but the filet mignon tasted better on its own (which is how it should be). Tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi and thought it was very tender and pretty good. Not the best I've had like in an authentic Italian restaurant though.

Absolutely amazing service! Even though we had a late dinner reservation that was close to their closing time, we never once felt rushed. Our chairs were pulled out for us and when someone left the table, our napkins were still folded when we came back. Plates and drinks constantly refilled. The wine list is long so the waiter had the sommelier come by to assist in picking a bottle. The sommelier tried to sell the table a $2k bottle, even though we wanted a mid-range bottle so that wasn't to helpful initially. Ended up with a really good bottle though (I'm not a wine drinker and thought it was easy to drink).

Apparently this dinner (and one later in the weekend) got me nominated in picking all the Vegas meals in the future. Would definitely come back. Hopefully for HH next time. Want to try the marrow & escargot!",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,7,4,5,4qQLoZCRdHOPm8gR2kwRPg

Between the everyone in the group, I think we ordered just about all of the appetizers and about half the entrees. I loved everything I tried and I didn't hear a single complaint from anyone.  The onion soup is the top 2 or 3 I've ever had, as was the beef tartare. My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. I was able to sample their mac and cheese, which had a look that I've never seen before, and it was excellent. 

I was pleased with how great the service for our group was considering how many people we had.  I think a place deserves to be recognized when they can effortlessly handle a large group.

My only complaint is minor -- I wish they'd add a hard cider or two to their beer menu. I don't like most beers and I don't like wine, so I ended up having to stick to Diet Coke because they didn't have any ciders.

Let me say to those morons this is not In n Out burger where you can order your foie gras 'animal style.'  This is a for real, down to earth, as God is my witness, 5 Star Restaurant. 
We had dinner there on a Thursday night. The Executive Chef was cooking. How can you be sure the Executive Chef is there? Ask. Simple enough. 
We told our server, John Paul, we were in no hurry, and he got it. The first thing he asked was would we like a cocktail THEN he gave us menus. Nice. He got it. No hurry. 
If you, dear reader, are in more of a hurry, tell your server. These guys and gals are pros. They get it IF you tell them. Most people willing to drop a couple hundred on dinner would rather savior the moment. Better yet, if you're in a rush, go to the crappy buffet and complain about that. 
The two of us took 3 hours and spent almost $300. We're not rich, but enjoy a good meal. Yes, that included several drinks and dessert with no comps.  Ask yourself how many times you've walked out of a mediocre restaurant after spending a hundred or more completely disappointed? THIS is worth it. 
What we ate  
Charcuterie Board. A huge app good for three or more. We pigged out with the two of us. In house salami, Pate' and an amazing rillette. It came with grilled French bread, cornichon pickles and a house made Dijon. Fabulous. 
After that we moved onto a wonderful red wine suggested by our somalier. Again. We asked. I told her I didn't want to spend $50 on a glass of wine. She suggested this gem at 12 bucks a glass. A bargain to any wine drinker. (Sorry, I don't  recall what it was)
After we ate that our server return for what we wanted to order next. Get it? Take your time. They're cool with that. 
We had the frisée aux lardon. Bacon, lettuce, and a delicious vinegrette. Light, tasty, wonderful. 
Main course was bouillabaisse for me and a French sea bass for me better half. The fennel on hers was out of this world. My soup was extraordinary worthy of any reward. 
Our server talked us into trying the chocolate macaroon for dessert. Again, superb. 
Ya, this is too wordy, and any editor would chop it up, but I'm hoping you got the point. 
To summerize, just slow down, and enjoy an amazing meal.",xe-NSASzolbpIMdR_PprNw,5,4,5,sLgd2KkXyAPP7Q0IWFcAvA

Some delicious traditional French dishes alongside some fun interesting take on the classics. Start by sharing the prime steak tartare and frisée aux lardons. I'm a big fan of simple dishes that are seasoned and executed well. Both of these dishes are just that. Their variations on Benedicts are deliciously fun but my favorite dish is the hunter's waffle -- a sort of duck à l'orange for breakfast. Sitting atop a waffle is glazed duck confit and perfectly poached eggs that are smothered with sauce maltaise. It's sweet and savory and makes me smile. And don't forget the everlasting rosé. Service is absolutely always on point whether it's at the bar or at a table. Support staff is always helpful. Managers actively on the floor visiting with guests.

3168529,2017-10-15,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"On the way to Zion National Park for our 10th anniversary, my husband and I thought it'd be fun to stay a night at the Aria just to break up the drive from Peoria where we live. We always stay at the Aria, and I've seen so many photos and reviews that I was inspired to try this place for dinner. I'll admit, it was an odd night for a celebration, a Wednesday night at around just after 9pm, when it's close to closing I'm assuming. The restaurant was fairly open, except for a few people grabbing drinks at the bar, and maybe two other couples and one small group. There was no hostess originally at the entrance, so we awkwardly looked around. The friendly bartender assured us someone would soon be with us, and eventually after maybe 10 minutes, we were rescued and finally guided to a table.

Our waitress was super nice. She grabbed my cocktail order, Le Peche Mode. Cute name, so the cocktail just had to be good... It had Hennessy, peach cream, lemon, ginger and mint. I'm not the biggest fan of mint, but luckily it was subtle. I enjoyed it much more than the Lime in Da Abricot, which also had cognac, apricot purée, and mint. While waiting for my cocktail to make its presence, we were given a French bread baguette in a paper bag lightly toasted and served with non melted butter. It wasn't pre sliced so we made a hell of a mess breaking it apart and sharing it. Our bad... 

The Escargots Bardot consisted of wild burgundy snails wrapped in puff pastries, and they were toasted with hazelnuts sprinkled on top and delicately bathed in chartreuse-garlic butter. The pastry was very light and perfect. We really loved this appetizer. 

The Steak Tartare had freshly ground prime filet with egg yolk served with gaufrette potato chips. This was my husband's choice, because he is a sucker for most tartares, and this one did not disappoint. The salty chips fit well with the raw filet meat. 

Since I'm a huge fan of Branzino type fish, it was a no brained for me to try the Loup de Mer Au Fenouil. It had roasted Mediterranean Sea bass, caramel iced lemon, fennel, and fingerling potatoes. It looked exactly like the photo in our hotel room advertisement for Bardot. It was also perfectly done not only in aesthetics but in taste. 

My husband ordered the double cut pork chop. It was oak smoked pork with bacon lardons, root veggies, horseradish potato purée and grain mustard bearer bland. Funny enough, this was also featured on the advertisement for Bardot in our hotel room, but I swear, we ordered these 2 entrees without even seeing the advertisement. I just recognized the 2 entrees' photo when we returned to the room! 

The food is absolutely close to phenomenal especially as far as how the escargot and the Loup de Mer. Our waitress was really good and friendly especially for working late on a Wednesday night, a slower night. I think what got to me was the long waits we encountered. We waited a while to sit down and there seemed like too much time between dishes. If it had been a weekend, then I'd totally understand, but it really didn't seem like that were that many people there. There was a photographer there too with an assistant, nabbing memorable photos of the night. It was just slightly on the pushy side with posing our photos for us, and then they returned at the end of dinner to present us with prints of our photos. It was around $100 or so to get the prints and that's only a select few of the prints. She was right... it was our 10th anniversary so we were suckered into getting some.. It was still awkward though. 

If we return, it'd just be to grab a cocktail and maybe some of the escargot pastries again.",eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,7,2,4,BLByB0ZEj7jyIS82IdjKUA

However this was not the case with Bardot.  I was invited last minute to go to brunch with a few old friends, and although I was hesitant, I was SO happy I went! 

Bardot is located in the Aria, which is already a beautiful (non-smoking, so yay) and pleasant place.  Self-parking *which was not painful* and valet is available for guests and it's a short walk through the casino and up to the second floor for Bardot. 

The ambiance was lovely, although the music didn't go with the vibe of the restaurant.  The menu was pretty, laid out nicely and offered many different selections. We started with the boulange basket, with assorted sweet breads -- made me miss Paris. 

For brunch, my friend and I decided to split both the salmon croissant benedicts and the french toast.  Both were AMAZING -- the french toast was a large puffed (looked like honey toast) piece of toast and sweet, but not too rich.  The almond syrup it came with was over the top.....I thought the toast was perfect on it's own, thank goodness it was on the side. 

The salmon croissant benedict was absolutely mouth-watering. The salmon was cooked perfectly and each bite melted in your mouth.  I was sad when I came down to my last bite.  

Staff was extremely friendly and attentive, my glass of water was never empty, so that deserves a  huge thumbs up.

Along the way, I learned a bunch about Josh's philosophies for food, preparation and creativity. He brought a good deal of his personality to Bardot Brasserie, and I wanted to experience French cuisine at it's finest. A true french bistro is a tough find when in Las Vegas recently, I had the opportunity to escape from my obligations to have dinner at the restaurant. I asked to speak with Josh and a short time later he came over to my table and I invited him to sit with me. I mentioned that I had seen him on Munchies, and we spoke of my longing for traditional french fare. I decided to stick with appetizers this evening (a bunch of them!) because I could indulge my cravings for the more traditional french offerings, but as Josh would say, with a bit of a modern twist. Just what the doctor ordered. Even though I was just having appetizers, the order in which they came to the table was carefully considered. Not all together, but in a measured, comfortable way. The sommelier came over to the table and reviewed what I was having and suggested a glass that would satisfy throughout all the dishes. I believe it was the Patrick Piuze Val De Mer Cremant de Bourgogne Rose - a burgundy from France. Wow. She was spot on. Ok, every single dish that came to the table was inspired and delicious. I mean really good. Seriously. There was escargot with toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter in pastry shells followed by pate de campagne - a traditional housemade pate with heritage pork, veal and pistachios. Next came the bone marrow au piovre - a peppercorn and remy martin vsop crusted bone marrow, burgundy onion jam with cornichons and grilled country bread. Right about then, Chef Josh sent over, as a wonderful surprise, the duck a l'orange - wood-grilled wings, cointreau glaze with sauce maltaise. But I wasn't done yet. I couldn't resist the prime steak tartare. What's fabulous about the steak tartare is that it is ground to order, with sauce verge, egg yolk and gaunter potatoes. Simply delicious.

Bardots portions are big so we shared the following amongst 4 girls:

- escargot bardot: comes in 4 small servings. Not as tasty as expected but still good
- endive and blue cheese salad: simple and delicious, blue cheese wasnt too overpowering
- petit french onion soup: perfect in every way
- french toast: basically half a loaf of high quality bread. Sooo full!

3306579,2016-10-03,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Oh wow. During my most recent three day stop in Vegas that included some of the city's finest - brunch at Bardot was hands down the highlight thanks to some of the best and most unique french toast I've ever had. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

In a city of hour plus waits for brunch and all sorts of other ridiculousness, Bardot has kept the classic model intact, and I was easily able to secure a 10:15 brunch reservation for four the Saturday morning of a music festival weekend. Our party was seated immediately and the service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Bardot isn't cheap, but honestly it was entirely more reasonable than what I was expecting. I ordered the absolutely massive sticky bun for the table as a starter, and while yes $16.00 is absurd when you're of the mindset that you can get something somewhat similar at Cinnabon for 30% of that, the quality here was noteworthy. 

For a better comparison, the Steakburger at Bardot is $19.00. That's above my $15.00 burger threshold but not by much.

My french toast, which could have comfortably fed two, came in at $19.00, which was entirely reasonable given the quality. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

My oh my. I've had some truly out of this world french toast in my day to include what came out of my own household as a child, but I'd never had anything that resembled the French Toast at Bardot.

While the massive block of bread was intimidating at first, I quickly realized that I could cut into it's buttery smooth texture with a quick swipe of the fork, and the airy texture was flawlessly combo'd with a butter-like whipping cream that I could have eaten all by itself and been perfectly happy. I'm not an almond guy, but the almond brittle and orgeat syrup went over well at the table, and all in all this was a truly stellar dish. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I'll take Bardot over a Vegas buffet, or any other alternative, any day of the week. Star Granted.",OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg,2,2,5,K2c5j2u-7SciXmFkJ_MM-w

3356454,2016-11-08,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Our favorites of the night were the king crab crepe and rib eye with the Bordelaise sauce. The oak smoked Duroc pork chop tasted great but was too dry and disappointed a bit. We also had the mille feuille for dessert which was very good.

Our favorite dish of the night was the king crab crepe. My wife really liked the taste of the buckwheat crepe which was pretty good by itself. The crepe was topped with king crab, trumpet mushrooms, a sunny-side egg and a waiter-poured beurre blanc sauce. The dish worked as a whole, was flavorful and was a great way to start the meal.

We ordered the rib eye steak frites since this was a brasserie, and it was mighty tasty. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, paired with a tasty garlic aoli. The fries were good by themselves and apparently cooked in beef fat, but they were also good with the garlic aoli. The rib eye was also pretty tasty, not as good as dry aged rib eye from a steak house like Mastro's, but still pretty good by itself. While the rib eye was great by itself, it was even better with the Bordelaise sauce. 

The oak smoked Duroc pork chop tasted a bit like bacon, given that it was smoked and salty. While the taste was great, unfortunately, it was very dry. This was the most disappointing thing about the dinner. Otherwise, the pork chop was served with bacon, some root vegetables and slices of cornichon. 

Our waiter recommended the mille feuille for dessert, and it was a great way to end the meal. Essentially, the mille feuille is made of layers of thin caramelized puff pastry sheets separated by vanilla pastry cream (creme patisserie). The difference in texture between the delicately crispy puff pastry sheets and the soft pastry cream really worked. The dessert was sweet but not overly so and was surprisingly good.

Overall, everything was flavorful and well-executed for the most part, with the exception of the pork chop. However, even with that slight misstep, we would come back if we were in the mood for French brasserie cuisine.",izLeU7SgRLNA0QLiBEYbYA,0,0,4,aYfCWmqRto6NH4ANtnBPog

Their menu has great selections.  I couldn't decided between the escargots, foie gras, or bone marrow, but after some thinking, I decided to go with the bone marrow.  That was a great choice!

I've had bone marrow elsewhere.  In some places, I've gotten bone that are large but with little marrow.  This one had smaller bones, but generous portions of marrow! The bone marrow comes in two pieces and 3 slices of toasted bread.  You use the marrow to spread on the bread...like butter and yes, better than butter!!  If it's your first time having bone marrow ever, or if you're not a fan of the bone marrow taste itself, I'd recommend using the side of caramelized onions.  The caramelized onions will take over the bone marrow taste.

Got the mussels for the entree.  The light garlic buttery wine sauce was flavorful, and it didn't feel too buttery.  The only disappointment was the size of the mussels.  I'm used to large jumbo mussels almost as big as oysters, but these mussels were just slightly bigger than clams.  Regardless, they tasted excellent.

The peppercorn-crusted bone marrow with burgundy onion jam and a side of grilled country bread was OK. Not as fatty and scrumptious as I would like.
RATING: 3.5/5

and tarragon were juicy and tasty. The warm baguettes came in handy for the broth.

First off, the space is beautiful. A stunning bar greets you as moved towards the dining area. After a long perusal, Shady's gracious companion lusted for the seared foie gras, while Shady himself opted for the Duck wings L'orange. The foie gras was delicious, and was consumed immediately. The Duck was indeed delicious, but far too much work finding meat among the bones. As good as they were, Shady would order something else in the future.
 On to the mains-The Lupe De Mer-Seabass was outstanding. Its hard to say it was better than the perfectly cooked Duroc pork chop, but with both being 4 stars, the nod goes to the seabass. A side of sprouts, some rest, then off to dessert. Another outstanding dish-The frozen Paris brest. Basically the most delicious saucers u can imagine. 
The French fare was the perfect start to the Vegas binge. The service was great, the scene upscale bistro, and the food outstanding. Shady will have to revisit for the much heralded brunch.

We went during brunch on a Sunday, and if you must go, then have their pastry bowl and tartare, which was about the only items that were decent.",yzQNdOMj5Dur06puIP5JHQ,0,0,2,ITd5VqfcySvXYOhcMFPTUw

3455236,2016-06-19,4,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"This review is for their 2016 Las Vegas Restaurant Week $80 menu.

Bardot is both a solid brunch and dinner spot. The food is delectable, and the service is unpretentious. 

The three-course Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu may be more than enough food, but I'd suggest ordering an extra appetizer or two to share.

Appetizer - Escargots Bardot: Can't stand the sight of SNAILS? Well, these are wrapped in a puff pastry. These are savory, buttery, and delicious -- you can't eat just one. 

Appetizer - Seared Foie Gras Lyonnaise: If you've ever tried Filipino-style adobo, the sauce in this dish has a familiar adobo flavor to me. I wasn't a fan of the beluga lentils, but I liked the combination of foie gras and the prune confiture. 

First Course - King Crab Crepe: A crab and black trumpet mixture folded into a buckwheat crepe with a sunny side egg right in the center. Yum.

Second Course - Maine Lobster Thermidor: Truthfully, I'm not a fan of lobster, but I gave this a try any way and it was delicious. This was my first time trying this dish, and it reminded  me of a ""dynamite"" that you can order at some Japanese restaurants. I loved the mixture of the mushrooms, bernaise sauce, and the tender chunks of lobster meat. The creamy mashed potatoes were bomb; I wish I had a bowl of just that on the side. 

Third Course - Chocolate Macaron: Rich and decadent. This is a deluxe version of a regular macaron. Sandwiched in between chocolate cookies were dollops of chocolate mousse. Chocolate sauce and chocolate shavings topped it off. 

For French cuisine on The Strip, Bardot's my top pick. I cannot wait to return.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,7,4,Dz0il1b8WsK3HD7iPfDT6A

We had made the *mistake* of eating at Wicked Spoon for brunch earlier in the day, so we didn't get to try as many menu items at Bardot as we wanted to (glutton problems). We ordered cocktails to start, the Crowd Pleaser for him and Death in the Florida Straights for me. Both were excellent, I wanted to order 5 more of mine, because the spiciness was divine, but we had a show later I needed to be awake for. 

We skipped appetizers, and he got the Heritage Chicken Roti and I had the filet mignon with steak frîtes. Ooooh man. My steak was a perfect rare, and so juicy tender perfect. The fries are cooked in beef fat and are pure decadence with mayonnaise. My husband was in love with his chicken, and we heard our waiter tell another table they were out of it as we were eating, so try not to miss it! 

The restaurant itself is gorgeously decorated, and while we were sitting at a center table, it still felt quite intimate and romantic. Our waiter was great, and struck the perfect balance of attentive and unobtrusive. 

By this point we were stuffed, which was a heartbreak, because I wanted to try their entire dessert menu. Truly, though, it gives us an excuse to come back on our next visit-- not that we really needed one.",R_gLnlQwuVis28CW4Zshsw,1,0,5,AokGHqZqt6kcdGKykhikyQ

Foie Gras with lentils (so good order your own so you don't have to share, trust me)

In a hoity toity hotel and a high end restaurant, this is quite hard to come by. The service was excellent and, for a family of four dressed in casual wear, we were treated no different than the business suits sitting a table next to us.

The highlights include the baguette with salted butter that our family ate with joy. Yes its complimentary but its darn good too.

We ordered the poutine, the beef tartare, and three different tartines. Everything was good, but my favorite was the beef tartine. Reduced in red wine and served on a crispy tartine, they crack a hella fresh egg in top and what you get is pure awesomeness.

Excellent service. I had the la varenne cocktail (cognac, liqueur, lemon juice), bone marrow au poivre appetizer, poulet roti entree with mushroom bread pudding and haricots verts, and frozen paris brest for dessert. My fiance had the pork chop. 

La varenne was a little too sweet and not strong enough. The caramelized onions that came with the bone marrow was a little too salty, but the country bread was perfect. The paris brest should probably be more of the traditional variety, as opposed to with hazelnut ice cream, as the ice cream hardened the choux pastry and made it less enjoyable altogether.

3517576,2015-02-10,5,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"What was once a beautiful, rustic space with American Fish has been transformed into a lavish and elegant interior every bit equal to the $5 million they spent to renovate. They made this new Michael Mina spot more inviting and approachable by moving the bar to the front of the restaurant and added a small patio area. The impressive kitchen remains unchanged. Large windows encasing it allows diners a great view into the heart of the restaurant.

Many of the appetizers we sampled were stellar, particularly the pate de campagne ($13), foie gras parfait ($15), and blue crab crepe ($16). The port gelée topping the parfait was just sweet enough to balance the savoriness of the creamy foie. Less successful dishes included the escargots Bardot ($17), which I found to be too salty and garlic-heavy, and the tarte flambée ($14).

If you dine there for brunch, the Hunter's waffle ($19) and croque madame ($18) are both solid dishes, but French toast ($12) is a must. Despite it's impressive size, the thick cut brioche was surprisingly light and airy, even with the interior retaining much of the custard it was soaked in.

Of the savory dishes we tried the Heritage chicken roti ($29) was a standout with it's crispy skin and well seasoned meat. The Parisian gnocchi ($23) was beautifully presented with it's mix of pillowy soft pasta, mushrooms, and goat cheese.

Despite splitting the dishes with four other people most of us were stuffed. That didn't stop us from getting dessert. The mille feuille ($12) and apple tarte tatin ($12) were both excellent, but the chocolate macaron ($12) was my favorite. The crispy macaron shell, smooth chocolate cream in the center, sprinkling of salt and warm chocolate sauce poured table-side make it a chocoholic's dream come true.

Michael Mina restaurants can be hit or miss, but he's got a winner with this one. His team has taken a rather ho-hum brasserie concept and given it new life. With a mix of traditional and new dishes, it has the potential to attract many to French cuisine for the first time or a return visit.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,18,11,4,pIEDtJoBQixRUNW3PbvQ6w

We started with the Escargot Bardot which was so delicious that you don't want to stop eating!  It's a puff pastry made to perfection! 
Foie Gras Parfait....wow!!! I'm not a huge fan of Foie Gras, but this was so good I seriously could not have enough. I'm sure my dinner partner was not happy since he loves it and I usually let him eat it all... Not this time!  It's a ruby port gelee and grilled country bread.  Another must have !
Duck A L'Orange- ( duck wings)  grilled wings, blood orange , sauce maltaise. cooked perfectly and just enough to keep you happy.  
Charcuterie Board- it's super delicious and definitely a good dish to order if you have kids or picky eaters.  Looks like a flat bread pizza but taste like a million bucks! Very unique taste  housemade pate, heritage pork rillete and ham amazing. 
Onion Soup with all the fixings was very tasty! Nothing to write home about, but if you like onion soup for sure a good choice ! 
 Cocktails..... Well don't mind if I do!  lost Generation is a flavor of the old amazing flavors of what a conga cocktail should be. Great balance !  Also the The Ritz was   Very tasty and  ""And God created  woman"" was a great choice .  This place is a must visit when at Aria !

The bartender was really good about letting my friend sample the different beers and cider on tap and we all wound up with the Ommegang Witte to start while waiting for 5pm.  

Once we were able we ordered the duck wings, shrimp cocktail, bone marrow, fries, both tartes, and the macaroni au gratin to share.  The wings were a big hit and we wound up ordering more of those.  The tartes were also great; so simple but so delicious.  Neither of my friends wanted to try the bone marrow but that was alright because it was wonderful and I was happy to have its deliciousness all to myself.  The drink of the day was the Bee's Knees made with gin, honey syrup, and lemon and it also was delicious.  You may see a theme here.

The fries, macaroni, and shrimp cocktail were all good but nothing out of the ordinary taste wise.  The garlic mayo with the fries was really good, though. 

Our bartender was friendly and the food came in good time frame.  We left full and little tipsy before 7pm and the bar was pretty full with the restaurant starting to get busy on this Saturday night.

She checked in with us multiple times but not excessively. 

Came with a complimentary bread and butter. 

10 OZ FLAT IRON, STRAUSS GRASS-FED - you get to pick your sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection and the fries that came with it was amazing!

BRUSSELS SPROUTS - sides. A good amount that can be shared up to three people. 

We also got a wine and a cocktail (STRAWBERRY BLANC). The strawberry blanc was really good and refreshing. 

Overall, it was a great experience EXCEPT how there is some lady who takes photos of you and tries to get you to spend $70 bucks on three printed photos.

3627982,2017-02-21,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"This has become my ""go to"" spot in Vegas. I usually stay at Aria or Vdara, which makes this restaurant really convenient, and really delicious. I've tried a lot of their menu items, and whats below is only what I can remember. They're also really easy to get a table last minute, which is great when you suck at planning, but still want a good meal. 

The Excellent: 
The wait staff is really friendly and accomodating. I always ask for ice in my water, which they don't do by default, but none the less they make sure to keep my glass full of ice. One of their staff members even turned me onto a place names San Sebastian in spain, and I visited there based purely on his recommendation, and I've been back twice since! Can't think him enough for that. Unfortunately I only saw him once, and when I asked for him on a return visit, they said he didn't work there any more. 
No Dress code - I hate dress codes. 
Beef Tartar - Oh man this is good stuff. Flavored well, and really delicious. They serve it with potato chips which is perfect. 
Bone Marrow - oh man. I've had very few things in life that were this delicious. 
Onion Soup - Get this. Seriously. You don't have a choice. I often get this as my entree, with the added beef, truffles, and egg on top. 
Foie Gras Parfait - delicious stuff. Really rich though, so a little is enough. 
Lamb Shanks - Oh man these unbelievably good. Perfectly cooked. 
Crab Legs - They're good, and normally they'd be in the ""good"" column, but they peel the legs back for you, so they're super easy to eat, which puts them in the excellent column in my book. 
Oysters - Delicious and fresh every time. 
Scallops - Unbelievably tender, and flavorful. Amazing. 
Beet Salad - Nice and refreshing salad, since everything else here is pretty heavy and bold. 
The orange friend chicken - Delicious, and the butter sauce they serve with it is amazing. 

The good: 
The Mac and cheese - I usually order it, and I'm usually a little bit disapointed because EVERYTHING else is so good.. but this mac and cheese, while still good, is not as excellent as it could be. It's a little dry, and needs more cheese sauce. Surprisingly, it might be better reheated the next day. 
Gnocchi - It was good, but not great. Kind of ""rubbery"", and needed more sauce. 
Truffle Fries - They're really good, but I don't really get much ""truffle"" flavor from them. 
Creme Brulet - Good, but not anything I haven't had anywhere else. 
Snails - I found a picture of these on my phone, but I don't remember them, so they must not have been too spectacular, but I don't remember them being bad either. 



The Bad: 
The only bad thing I'd have to say about them is that I tried to get a last minute reservation for 20, and they were only able to accomodate us with a limited menu. hard to blame them, but I hate limited menus... Maybe it's not fair to put this in the ""bad"" column, but I have to have something :)",tjFfSkiSHSxm8uvNRPuXVQ,1,1,4,8FdCURrY9AlK78hAMPCiGw

Started with the cheese plate, all three selections recommend by the waitress were unique, complex and delicious.  We ordered cocktails, which were fresh and strong.  The black truffle fries could use a little more black truffle than the light dusting they get, but it's a good amount for a side order.

For entrees we shared the pork chop and the gnocchi.  While the pork chop, vegetables and mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly, the mustard topping sauce was a bit boring but good.  The gnocchi was the best I've had; the black trumpet mushrooms give the dish a smokey, meaty flavor.

For dessert we had the strawberry pavlova, which was a perfect light finish.  The lavender gelato and strawberries provide plenty of flavor without being too overwhelming.  (Note that the meringue in a pavlova is crispy.)",PGZA3hOiqELIy4eBojO99g,0,1,5,kEkqblamEF6pkUnBubZpgg

My husband had the lobster bisque which was good and then a steak which was not special in anyway and also shared the dessert with me.

We ordered a glass of wine and were really shocked at how small a pour it was..it was below the mid-line of glass and my husband mentioned it to the waiter when he went by him.

We originally went just for some cocktails and to scope out the place:
- And God Created Woman - a subtle drink with a very fancy ""B"" embedded into the foam.  Almost too pretty to drink.  This one was pretty, but not very much flavor to it.
- Le Detroit - again, they make these drinks look like art!  This one has flowers and an ice sphere that almost looks like it glows thanks to the green chartreuse.  The chartreuse is pretty strong on the palate, so if you don't like that liquor, I'd skip this one.
- Notre Dame - by far my favorite.  It had a little bit of everything I like: gin, citrus flavor, and champagne.  It was like a kicked up French 75.
- Man About Town - similar to a Negroni, but not as much spice.

Well, once the liquor started settling in, we got hungry, naturally:
- Charcuterie - this dish is $25 and you do not get a lot of meat.  My husband is obsessed with charcuterie, so we've had it at many a restaurant, and the price is comparable to other restaurants, but the amount of meat is not.  It was delicious pate, prosciutto, salumi, and rillette...but a very small amount.
- French Onion Soup - Oh man, this comes out covered in bubbly cheese and is a bit salty, but in a good way.
- Mac and Cheese Gratinee - it's like a sculpted square of mac and cheese in this yummy, delicate sauce.  I liked it.
- Chocolate Macaron - if you like chocolate, this will be your jam.
- Strawberry Coupe Glacee - it was basically strawberry ice cream with crunchy, melt in your mouth meringue bits.  Pretty tasty.

What was really cool, though, was that Michael Mina himself came out to talk to some people at the bar and asked us how the food and drinks were.  Very cool getting to meet the man in charge of a restaurant empire!

I would definitely come again.  The bar was delightful, but the restaurant itself would make for a fabulous birthday/anniversary/special event dinner.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,2,1,4,1_DokAZ2H5PgmVS0bE8PNw

It's become a bit of a tradition for the boyfriend and I to seek out the buttery, savory delicacy when we're in town and last night was no exception. A Yelp search for foie gras turned up a newcomer since our last trip in Michael Mina's BARDOT. With overwhelmingly high marks we decided to reserve via Open Table.

An after-thought caused Brandon to follow up with a phone call to request a booth and mention that we were celebrating a special occasion (my birthday is in a week).

We arrived and were seated right away at a two-top table centrally located in the dining room, which was most certainly not the more private booth that we'd requested. If you like hearing every word from your neighboring diners this is the place for you! I mean, so loud at times that he had to lean over the table and ask me to repeat myself. If you're expecting a romantic bistro, this isn't it.

Wine drinkers, take heed. Their menu is exorbitantly priced. I generally drink Chardonnay, but their cheapest glass was $17. I opted to order the $38 half bottle of white Bordeaux, knowing I'd likely have two glasses over the course of our meal.

The seared foie gras appetizer over lentils and shallots was stunning. We both agreed that we could have polished off about five more, but at $29 we refrained. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a nice portion to share (between two!)

I'd wanted to try their French Onion soup, but ringing in at $17 (I believe), I just couldn't justify the addition. 

For our entree, Brandon and I decided to share the Surf and Turf combo of 14oz ribeye and king crab. $88 + $29 for the crab. Expecting a true ""surf and turf"" I was surprised when our respective plates came out, ribeye divided with crab meat topping each half. A $117 entree and you cut our steak in half and top each one with about 4 ounces of crab meat? Where I come from that's called a steak served Oscar style. Even in Vegas I wouldn't expect that to cost more than $100 and...You. Cut. My. $88. Steak. *sad face*

All said, the steak was seasoned well and cooked as requested and the crab was delicious though scant. The accompanying French fries weren't anything very special, however the garlic aioli served alongside was fantastic and elevated the side.

Service seemed slow but Jesus was pleasant and kept my wine glass filled throughout the meal.

I just expected more for what we ended up paying. And not a mention of our special occassion was made. *sigh* 

Bardot, I wanted you to romance me in a classic, swooning French kind-of way.

Instead I left feeling like a tourist who'd been pick pocketed while admiring the Eiffel Tower.

For no particular reason I hadn't been back to Vegas in nearly two years. While maybe not the newest, my wife and I had been hearing consistently great things about BARDOT Brasserie so we made a point of getting reservations for her B-day dinner.

Located within Aria, we went with a small group of friends and met up at the restaurant right around our reservation time. It took a few minutes before we got seated, but once inside the first thing one notices is how the place is dimly lit and full or tile, dark wood and brass. Deservingly a brasserie.

While on the pricier side, there are certainly pricier still in Vegas. As one would expect the menu is decidedly French. No need to try and reinvent the wheel here as the majority of menu options are relatively timeless.

While wine would definitely be on the table for dinner, we started things off with cocktails. Preferring alcohol-forward, I ordered the Smoke & Mirrors while my wife got the Snake In The Grass.  Both were excellent. Looking to try a little of everything we also ordered the charcuterie board, which came packed with pate, rillettes and other cured meats.

Main course had to be steak - 8oz Angus Filet Mignon, medium rare. A friend of ours ordered the same thing, medium. As with most fine dining experiences we had some time before the meals came out. Everything looked great and we dug right in. While the meat was what one would expect from a proper filet mignon, for a roughly $50 item, it didn't seem medium rare as we would have liked. 

About halfway through the meal we look over at our friend who'd ordered hers medium and noticed it was far pinker than our own. At that point we realized they had given us the wrong plates. I brought this up with the waiter next time they came by. While our friend who had ordered the medium learned then and there that she preferred medium rare, our server asked as flat out if we'd like another one. I actually felt bad, but yes, the medium wasn't doing the trick and we obliged. 

The new steak came out soon enough, and was indeed, perfectly medium rare. It cut like butter and melted in my mouth. I also then understood why this place gets such high marks to begin with. The food was great. And while they may have slipped up an expensive order, they also fixed it with poise and speed. That's how it's done.",m1KeH5M9tA_9A_1U5_hxwA,3,3,5,q9YuagzkD3ImoEV5RMwXcA
3806130,2016-10-17,2,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Bardot has been a favorite of mine for many years now.  Ever since my first experience in 2015, I kept returning every time I visited Las Vegas.  It's located in the Aria Casino, upstairs by the Buffet and it is great for both Brunch and Dinner.  

My first experience was dinner and they have one of the best Beef Bourguignon I have ever had.  It is a bit salty, probably from all the reduction it goes through, but pair it with their bread which is served warm with soft creamy butter.  If you don't get the bread after you order, politely ask your waiter for warm bread and butter, trust me, you do not want to miss out on the bread and butter. 

I tried their brunch the other day and I was so impressed and I just wish I could eat here everyday to try everything on their menu....one day. haha.  

Dinner Recommendations: 
- ESCARGOTS BARDOT
- ONION SOUP GRATINÉE - if you decide to get the soup....MUST MUST MUST add périgord truffle, braised oxtail & soft poached egg.  Best ""appetizer"" dish but more like an entree with all the additions.  I get so full off of this so best to share with someone.  
- HERITAGE CHICKEN RÔTI - Very tender chicken and flavorful.  
- BLACK TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES - Truffle and fries...do I need to say more? 
- MACARONI & MIMOLETTE GRATINÉE - More for the presentation, delicious but standard. 
- Beef Bourguignon - The best on their menu IMO.  As for extra bread when you order this! 

Dessert
- CHOCOLATE MACARON - Their signature dessert, super chocolaty for those chocoholics and definitely will satisfy your chocolate cravings.  Large so will need to share.  

Brunch
- NUTELLA STICKY BUN - Delicious, warm and comes in a metal pot.  Wish there was more nutella on top. 
- HUNTER'S WAFFLE - HOLY MOLY!  DELICIOUS!  Duck confit on top of a waffle topped with a poached egg and yummy sauce.  If you like duck, you will enjoy this dish.  
- CROISSANT BENEDICTS with MAINE LOBSTER - Fresh lobster, delicious, and a perfect combo to share with your friend who ordered the Hunter's Waffle.  
- TRUFFLE FRIES, GARLI AÏOLI 

Service: 5/5..  Great and attentive.  Knowledgable waiters with great recommendations.  Hostess sat us quickly. 

Ambience: 5/5 - Clean and 1800-1900 Parisian style interior.  

Parking: 3/5 - you have to pay for parking now at the Aria which sucks, but if you gamble and have the M Resort card, I think parking is complimentary.  Other than that, first hour is free, next hour is $7.  =(

Lots of rose centerpieces, soft lighting and gorgeous bar with gold shelves holding their liquor including an impressive selection of chartreuse. We showed up for our 1:30p reservation 10 minutes late as we had a difficult time finding it and the hostess let us know the kitchen would close in 5 minutes so we had to order quickly. We were seated and right away I knew I wanted a Benedict. I tried the short rib Benedict served on croissants and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was wonderful, also came with a hefty $6 price tag. In the Benedict I loved the texture and flavor of the short rib, and would've liked a bit more hollandaise sauce and fresher croissants as they tasted a bit stale. The butter that accomplished the complimentary bread was to die for, the bread was nothing special. I'm glad I ate here though not a place I would return to with so many options in Vegas.",MccuFzWXDbEzW4F6LoMz5Q,2,1,3,o-jiqRhIZO4zKehT1pYTrw

We dined here on a Sunday night so the restaurant was about half empty, but from the moment we stepped up to the hostess stand the service was nothing but exceptional. My wife and I both ordered cocktails, my wife had the moulin rouge and I had the Le pêche mode. Both were fragrant and quite tasty. The food was generally good but I felt that some of the dishes were lacking that certain je ne sais quoi for me to give this restaurant 5 stars. For starters we decided on the escargot, king crab crêpe and the bone marrow. The bone marrow was rich and smoky, and the escargot was good, but not memorable. However, the king crab crêpe was exceptional. The crêpe was delicate and light and the filling was seasoned to perfection. For our entreé we shared the loup de mer which was quite delicious as well.

3836054,2015-03-06,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner last month at Bardot the day after Valentine's for our 5th Anniversary. Not only is the location beautiful, but the food is also not so bad, you can never go wrong at a French Brasserie!
Our reservation was at 8pm, we arrived early and noticed they had Happy Hour from 5-7pm so we sat in the bar and lounge area and enjoyed some small bites and a drink. We enjoyed the Oysters, Tuna TarTare, Steak TarTare, Skate Wing, Bone Marrow, and my favorite small dish was the Duck Wings A' L'Orange, yum!
The hostess was very sweet and took us to our table early and the table was absolutely gorgeous set up with rose pedals. This was such a perfect way to start an anniversary dinner. When this restaurant used to be American Fish we surprisingly had the same server as we did this time at Bardot. It was very nice to see that Michael Mina kept on some of the staff from the previous restaurant. Our server's name is Jamison, he was fantastic; this visit as well as the last visit. He was very kind and knowledgable he gave us a great list of suggestions for our meal:

French Onion Soup Gratinee--make sure to add the truffle, OXTAIL, and soft poached egg.
Salad Course: Frisee salad with bacon and poached egg.
Entrees: I had the Ora King Salmon with lentils and a smoked tomato vinaigrette.
My boyfriend had the Pork Chop that came with a horseradish potato, very strong on the horseradish..
Sides: Green Beans and Macaroni Gratinee (normally I would not order any macaroni dish out at dinner, but I'm glad we got it, because the presentation is so creative, each noodle sits straight up and came as a square block, really impressive. 
Dessert: There is ALWAYS room for dessert! My boyfriend's mother is french and one of his favorite past times is when his mom would prepare her famous Apple Tarte Tatin from scratch.....so of course we tried it. Very tasty and the individual serving size is a great way to present this dessert. Also, we ordered the Coupe Glacee {{fancy words}} which was ice cream and sorbets. Our night ended with a beautiful pink rose handed to me, they were a special take home for Valentine's weekend!

The only thing that really bothered us during our meal was that we were sitting at a booth closer to the kitchen and the chef kept tapping on his bell for the food runners to come back. It was fantastic that the kitchen staff was not loud and we couldn't hear any silverware or plates touching each other, but the bell was reallyyy annoying! How about tapping the bell once? Or perhaps just hiring one or two more runners so the guests do not have to hear the bell and see the chef laughing after hitting it 12 times in a row!
Other than that, great spot, love the remodeling, and ask for Jamison, you will be in good hands!",EoYqz2VeckzbdhDKq06vBw,4,0,5,c6zhJNfaYxlDKcEQsyv2Ow

The food matches the ambiance and the service was impeccable.  We both had the salmon and it was superb. I don't know how they got the skin perfectly grilled but it was.  I started with the goat cheese beet salad and it also was very good with the baked goat cheese being outstanding. 

I used to eat in the same space when it was American Fish which was very beautiful and served great food.  It is amazing how in Las Vegas a place as nice as American Fish can be replaced with another outstanding restaurant.",Lb5a2VJFaH1w48GewaZctw,0,0,5,-wtoS7BCfBC7YNtCASwaYA

Our table shared a variety of appetizers:

- Foie Gras Parfait
- Charcuterie Board (housemade pate, pork rillette, ham)
- Bardot Escargot -hazelnuts, chartreuse butter 

I expected a lot from the escargots because our server touted them to high heaven. But they were just ok. Charcuterie Board was solid--loved the rillette. But I was ALL ABOUT THE FOIE GRAS PARFAIT! So wonderfully smooth and somehow rich and light at the same time. The port gelee added the perfect acidity to it.

For entrees, seester and I split:

-Oak Smoked Duroc Pork Chop with Crispy Lardons
-Alaskan Cod with a Saffron Beurre Blanc

The pork was very juicy and the lardons were decadent. The horseradish was fantastic with it. The cod was light, flaky and I loved the corn. 

But beware....if you love wine--bring your $$$$$$  The cheapest bottle was around $150 and I kid you not, we saw a bottle that was listed for $38K---no joke!

3843077,2018-03-11,2,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Top notch classy place in Aria.

I was here on a weekday for lunch with my husband, as work brought him to Vegas for the week. We had our 13 month old with us, and I instantly was nervous because walking in it was clear that the restaurant is posh and probably not keen on having babies in the dining room.

Luckily, it was pretty empty, and doubly lucky, my son was an angel and didn't throw any food! Our server was super professional and nice, and gave us lots of good recommendations on food and wine pairings. Hubby's coworker was dying to try escargot, and he said they were good, but he was disappointed that they weren't prepared classically. 

French onion soup- I LOVE me a good onion soup covered in that melty cheesy goodness. This soup was good, but not too memorable. 

Lobster bisque- Hubby ordered this, and he's not really a soup guy, or a rich thick food guy either, so I was surprised he ordered it. I thought it was good, it had a strong lobster flavor to it which was nice since usually you can't taste it.

World's best butter- the guy we were with ordered this, as he's never had French food before and wanted to go all out. You spread it on the bread, then sprinkle some sea salt on top. It was pretty tasty, I have to say, but their regular bread and butter was just fine to me too.

Chicken cordon bleu- Delicious! I've never had this dish before but I've always wanted to try it, and it was really yummy. Prepared perfectly, it had a nice crunch but the chicken inside was still juicy and moist. My baby loved it!

Steak frites- the two guys ordered this. The steak was great, prepared nicely, and their fries were delicious.

Overall, we had a very lovely, pleasant lunch here. Yes it's pricey, but the food was really good and I'd say worth the price. The restaurant space is gorgeous, and our service was top notch!",U1e7IE9A_358yG4pNBjmMw,5,8,4,zebOaYmPnojsixaI_h2HVA

AMBIENCE = Great! Beautiful brasserie.

SERVICE = Great, generally attentive.

FOOD REVIEW:

COMPLIMENTARY BAGUETTE & SALTED BUTTER
They give you a baguette loaf for 2 people. Salted butter is nicely whipped and creamy.

ESCARGOTS BARDOT: toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse garlic butter, puff pastry shells
--- Pretty good; wish there was a bit more garlic butter flavor though... but it wasn't greasy at all.

HAND CUT TRUFFLE FRIES (no photo)
--- Could hardly taste the truffle... wasn't worth the price.

KING CRAB CRÊPE: buckwheat crêpe, black trumpet mushrooms, sunny-side egg, normandy cider beurre blanc
--- It was ok. I'm not sure I'm a fan of the taste, but my mom really enjoyed it. 

BARDOT STEAK & EGGS: prime rib eye, two fried eggs, hash browns, sauce verte 
--- I didn't try it but the steak seemed pretty good. Tried a bit of the hash brown and I didn't like it. Tasted like dry cardboard with some herbs.

HUNTER'S WAFFLE: glazed duck confit, poached eggs, sauce maltaise
--- I didn't get to try this, but looks decent.

FRENCH TOAST: brioche french toast, vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, orgeat syrup
--- Wow, epic french toast! Really well done! Even though the toast was really thick, it had a nice bread pudding consistency to it (i.e. not dry at all, not too bready) and when you take a bite with the mascarpone and almond syrup... WOW... Amazing combination! Strongly recommend it and highlight of the meal. 

DOUBLE-CUT BACON (no photo)
--- Didn't try this but brothers were impressed with it. Compared this to smokey brisket.

SMOKED SALMON CROISSANT BENEDICTS: two poached eggs, sautéed kale, béarnaise
--- Looked amazing, but smoked salmon was way too salty. Wish there was a bit more kale to offset the saltiness. But overall I enjoyed this and love that it's on a croissant pastry.

MILLE FEUILLE: caramelized puff pastry, vanilla crème patisserie
--- Mmmm... so good!!! The puff pastry was so crispy and flakey. Really delicious. Highly recommend it.",AOzyzuDtkkEqKz1Cr3ugWQ,0,0,4,Zibs7j3M_W_KSwpJ7zx3ig

3877889,2018-05-31,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Meh.  I've experienced much better is a good way to describe the meal we had here.  We came here for brunch and with no reservation, we sat at the bar, which is fine.  That's what we do a lot of times anyway, but the only seats open were on a corner.  We grabbed them to make sure we had seats and then waited for about 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Mind you, the bartenders (yes, multiple bartenders) took care of the parties to our right and to our left, but did not acknowledged us until after they had taken care of both of those parties.  So finally, we got a couple of waters.  We weren't sure what we wanted yet so we took a few minutes to look at the menu - and moved down a few seats when a couple left.  Much more room which was nice!  A couple of bartenders asked us several different times if we wanted bar drinks, and when we kept saying no, they seemed to be irritated.  Maybe having a bad day?  Maybe upset that we were taking up bar seats but not ordering alcoholic drinks?  I'm not really sure.  We definitely drink but were just not in the mood.

I ended up ordering the French Omelette and my husband ordered the Bardot Breakfast Sandwich.  The dishes came out about 15 or so minutes later which wasn't bad.  They were not like any other French omelette or egg dishes either of us have ever had, though - the eggs were...well done.  Not like done well, I mean cooked well done.  Like very firm.  My omelette was so firm it held it's shape like a Japanese egg omelette would, and it also did not have any fine herbs or Gruyere in it that I could see, and had no seasoning at all.  I added salt & pepper which helped, but it still just tasted like plain egg.  My husband's egg sandwich had these little rectangles of the same, firmly cooked eggs, and they were almost like a styrofoam consistency.  I was expecting softer eggs, like almost runny.  That's how we've had any sort of French eggs before, and really any eggs for that matter.  We really should have sent it all back, but then what?  Have to deal with a crabby bartender and wait another 15 or so minutes for something else that might not be good either?  We just ate what we could, paid and left.  It wasn't inedible but it definitely wasn't worth the price and wasn't a good experience. It's a shame because I love French food, and the place had a great atmosphere.  Maybe the people in the place were just having an off day?  Who knows, but I'm in no hurry to return.",Yl4W33ShuKg0IBOZqZfQcw,0,0,2,MOmhB6XoE1itnIphFxAHUQ

Hunter's Waffle: Lot's of savory duck, perfect poached egg, rich maltaise sauce. The waffle could have been a lot crispier, and I think had it been I would have been in love with this dish had the waffle not been soggy.

Mussels & Frites: These were the largest mussels I have ever seen or eaten, and every single one was huge. The french fries were typical and served with ketchup and a truffle aioli.

The ambience is very loud. We were seated at a table that I could not even hear my husband. We asked to move and were accommodated which we appreciated.
I agree with other postings that it is very expensive for the quality. I do not mind paying if the food and ambience are superior but this restaurant falls short. First, the price for a glass of wine was ridiculous - $20 a glass. Our server didn't even pour our wine until after our appetizer was served. My husband ordered the oysters and said he felt sorry eating the baby oysters. We had to ask where they were from because they were so small ($21 for 6 babies). I ordered the burrata salad with peaches - 4 very small slices of peaches, a small tasteless piece of burrata with some julienned vegetables that were non descriptive ($21).
My entre was the lobster bisque which was very good but my husband's steak ($67) was very salty and inconsistent (some parts good, some not edible). Yes, Las Vegas is expensive but spend your money somewhere else.",07NA2XvMLYWfH0n2K2LaFg,0,0,2,Z8-U05d_glWZIx65rzZCwg

I went here during a work conference trip with some coworkers when we were trying to escape yet another vendor dinner. The decor is absolutely beautiful and definitely makes you feel like you are in the Aria. It's very French classic. That part of it I will say, was a five star. 

For food, I started with the onion soup (as did all three of my coworkers) and it was phenomenal! It was the biggest bowl of onion soup I have ever had in my life and quite possibly the tastiest. There was a ton of bread, a ton of onions, and a ton of cheese - it was everything French onion soup should be. Quite honestly, you can eat this as your meal, it was that much food. Because I had this rich soup, I decided to do a lighter dinner and had the mussels. The mussels were definitely prepared well, they had no grit or sand and they were all steamed open - for me, the miss here was simply the flavor. I also tried my coworkers gnocchi which was heavenly but a very heavy dish as well. I mean for crying out loud this is French food so richness, I guess is something that should be expected.

The service was lackluster and our server was not knowledgeable which for a restaurant of this caliber was extremely disappointing and definitely tainted the experience.

Just walking into Aria is fun and finding Bardot is like a hidden treasure. Show up early and sip a cocktail at the awesome bar! 

We got to sit at a booth and peek into the awesome kitchen. The server was adorable and she explained the menu and even answered my questions. We eat out often and are pretty adventurous and will try mostly anything. 

Let's start with warm french bread that is toasty on the exterior and soft on the inside with house butter.... house butter?  oh man that butter could be eaten buy the spoonful! I had to control myself. 

My highlights...
We had the Steak tartare - it was sooo good and fresh. 
Escargot - Beautifully presented wrapped in a fluffy pastry puff. 
Duck wings... one word...delicious. 

Roasted beet and goat cheese salad-  Whenever I see a beet salad on a menu, I have to order it, I love beet salad. This was perfectly dressed and the goat cheese was to die for. 

Ribeye Steak - Worth every frickin' penny. I always get worried that a chef is going to ruin a good steak that I pay good money for... but in this case it was a wast of time to worry... juicy, perfect and soooo much flavor!! Making my mouth water as I type this. The mashed potatoes were my favorite. I love mashed potatoes and I didn't realize how bad mine suck until I tried these. 

Mac & Cheese-My husband had the Mac and Cheese. Holy cow!! How do they do this? I really wanted to take a photo, but we made a deal to keep our phones off at dinner.  AND... It tased better than it looked and trust me it looks amazing!! I feel bad for the guy that has to prep that plate! Im sure you can find a photo of it somewhere. It probably has its own Instagram account. If not for any other reason... Go to Bardot and get your MAC& CHEESE on!!! FOR REAL

I was full... but hubby always wants dessert.
The Chocolate Macaron was .... Oh so macaron! Melt in your mouth worth every calorie, paired well with the hot and strong coffee. 

We have lots of amazing places to eat here in LV, and its always fun to try something new but I won't passing up the chance to

I have little to no faith in Mina restaurants but this place blew me away. I come to Vegas enough to constantly struggling to try a new place vs visiting an old spot. Finally stayed away from grabbing brunch at Bouchon and ended up here. Located on the second floor, escalator near the taxi drop off. If you're coming from the casino floor, head over to the chocolate decor wall and you'll see the escalator.

The decor of this place is great. I feel like I'm in some 1950 building. Service was great, I forgot his name, but the server we had was very patient with us. He gave a good amount of suggestions, just that we didn't have the stomach to try everything. Ended up ordering the escargots bardot, short rib croissant benedict, and a bellini. Bellini was good, but I just felt like one that day, it's not a MUST HAVE. But the other two.... if you're able to take the disgusting thought of having to engulf a snail down your throat, order it. If you're not afraid of a heavy brunch dish, order that short rib croissant benedict. What this place has done right is the pastry. Both the bardot and the benedict had a good flakey crisp. If I didn't have to share the bardot, that would have been better. Unfortunately I came with 2 others and it was our first time, so sharing is caring. Blah blah blah. I was deciding between the short rib croissant benedict and the hunter's waffle (duck confit waffle, basically a more bougie version of chicken and waffles, I'm bougie so I considered it). I'm too much of a croissant fan so the benedict won me over. Not that it was a bad dish, it was just too heavy for my preference. I loved it, but I didn't want to be THAT full. Hunter's waffle would have left me in the same state. Flavors had been very rich, lots of juice coming from the short rib. Paired with the yolk, there goes the crispy and flakey croissant...

They had a summer tasting menu for $65, and it is so worth it! The entree alone by itself would have been $49. 

The set menu comes with 4 courses, and all of them are on the regular priced menu. I chose the summer melon (cheese was the highlight!), scallops (tender, but also heard great things about the duck wings), seabass (maybe my least favorite, but still very good), and the strawberry pavlova for dessert. Portions were hearty, but lots of attention to delivery. 

We also separately ordered the foie gras parfait, the seared foie gras and the bone marrow to try. So decadent. All were delicious, but my favorite of the three would be the foie gras parfait, light and airy, a refreshing change to the usually dense foie gras pate.

Standouts were the Beef Wellington--a masterpiece of rare beef surrounded by mushroom duxelles and a flaky pasty, the endive and bleu cheese salad (refreshing and plated in a very pleasing fashion), the scallops, and the duck breast.  I have left out some of the other items but the whole meal was outstanding.  

Desserts are a must.  The espresso crème brûlée was so different and having the Baked Alaska once again is a show both for your eyes and your taste buds.

We started off with a bottle of Perrier-Jouet, and ordered a beet salad and cheese plate for the table... a-mazing. The beets were super fresh, well dressed with great oil, and served along an amazing cheese. The cheese plate was to die for--our waiter made some expert selections, and I find myself googling where I can get them locally! 

Dinner was excellent. From the chicken my best friend had (not too moist, but not dry at all..almost sous vide perfection) to the beautiful and generous cut of prime rib I had. Each paired well with the selections from the Somm from the great wine list. Sides were hearty and delicious. 

I wish we would have had time (or stomach space) for dessert, as I'm sure it would have been amazing. 

Truly appreciated the excellent service we received at Bardot as well. I was in the service industry for a while, so I pay attention to the little things--the Sommelier's presentation was perfect, the waiter was an expert with the menu, and the pace of the meal was great. The waiter didn't even flinch when I asked (before the meal, away from the table) about splitting the check 4 ways--extremely accommodating and professional.

This was absolutely one of the better choices made on a recent trip to Vegas, unlike the one where I kept forgetting to collect my winnings and walk away from the table.  Hate when that happens.  

The service for brunch was so comforting, especially when you are recovering from a late night.  We were so hungry and started to order more than we should, so our oh so polite and professional server made a recommendation on how to serve our meal that worked out perfectly.  We started with the king crab crepe.  The crepe was so light and tasty.  I secretly wished I didn't have to share that one because I could have finished it in a minute.  My hunny ordered the filet mignon and eggs and I had the smoked salmon croissant benedict, which I absolutely loved being served on a croissant rather than a english muffin.  The texture and taste was good, though it was a bit salty which I just figure is due to the smoked salmon.  The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium.  I have to say, even the salted butter and bread was spot on for our meal.  

For our finale, we had the nutella sticky bun for dessert, because why not.  Our server recommended this as a dessert rather than a starter and I'm so glad she did.  At first I thought there was no way we could eat it after all we just ate.  But the sticky bun was much lighter than I expected and even with the heavy nutella, it wasn't as sweet as it looked.  It was the perfect amount of sugar to end our lovely meal.

4041024,2017-09-23,2,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"BARDOT Brasserie Review - From the moment we first stepped into Michael Mina's BARDOT Brasserie, a cute French bistro tucked into a corner next door to Jean George Steak House on the second-floor Promenade level of the Aria Hotel, we knew we were going to become regulars.  Was it the beautiful bar? Or the French accordionist serenading the guests? The crusty french bread? Actually, I think it was the ""Everlasting Champagne"" that accompanied an amazing menu.  Who doesn't find themselves three sheets to the wind in Vegas at noon at least once in their lives?

Decor
The entire restaurant is fashioned in a classic but modern French bistro setting. Rustic treatments, artwork, and gold splash the walls tastefully and not overbearingly so. The bar itself is such a showpiece I had to include a picture of it to show the grandeur of the bar. The seating was surprisingly comfortable and after half a dozen visits over the past year, we haven't felt any seat/table was 'bad'.

Food
After several visits to Bardot, and having had many of the menu items, we have yet to find a dish we didn't like, much less love.  Something as simple as a Smoked Salmon Plate is executed so well, that it sets a whole new standard. Here are some of our favorites, albeit not an all-inclusive list:

Foie Gras Parfait
Recently I've discovered a newfound love of Foie Gras, and this parfait was a surprise to me. I usually love a grilled Foie Gras alone or atop a steak. Although Foie Gras parfaits are a classic preparation, I had never really tried, until Bardot. The flavor of the Foie Gras mellowed the sweetness of the port gelee so that spreading atop crusty grilled sliced bread felt so natural.

Smoked Salmon
Bardot executes smoked salmon better- just better. Not only are the ingredients fresh and of high quality, but more importantly, the seasoning and flavors are so well balanced that it just tastes better. There's no other way that I can really describe it any better. The smoked salmon plate is loaded with smoked salmon, sliced brioche, chive mascarpone, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and traditional garnishes. Sipping champagne while noshing on these gems make the day so great!

Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad
The beet and goat cheese salad has made me love beets again. After I first had this salad, I immediately added beets to my grocery list. I already love goat cheese, but the caña de cabra cheese in this salad was like goat brie or bucheron. The creaminess of the cheese and bite of the beets were all carefully balanced with the wild arugula, hazelnuts, and mild vinaigrette. I've also added hazelnuts to my grocery list to throw on my salads!

There are too many other great dishes that can be had at BARDOT that I haven't listed here. Go and try them - whether it be brunch or dinner, you won't go wrong here.

Service

An additional highlight of Bardot is their consistently high level and quality of service. We have been there on weekdays, weekends, brunch, dinner, holidays, and off days. Every visit has been met with just the right amount of attentiveness while maintaining excellent service.",sRllSaD1Evx4Z8doDDgS0g,6,5,5,xvcLuo4YxNzl8v-l_nSDRQ

Service: Exceeded expectations for $$$ restaurant.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and worked with a professional sense of urgency.  The kitchen kept the high end dishes coming on time throughout the evening.

Brasserie cuisine: The ""World's best butter"" with the sea salt was tasty and I kept carb loading because of it.  The Maine Lobster Bisque was a little off for me (little too much brandy or dry sherry?) but had this amazing type of cracker paired with it that I've never seen before. (see pic).  The cheese plate was solid and the charcuterie/meat board was awesome, that prosciutto!  I tried some of my friend's moules frites/mussels and it was tasty, perfect amount of garlic butter.  I went with the Rack of Lamb and it was delicious.  Prepped and cooked perfectly, and something I'd order again.  Every time I see truffle fries, it's an auto order and Bardot's was great.

Ambiance:  Beautiful inside and out, the brasserie lighting and decor makes for a wonderful dining experience.  The Dark wood tables and burgundy leather chairs are comfortable. The rectangular bar by the entrance is designed beautifully, almost chandelier like.

Bardot Brasserie just made my list of great restaurants for a first date.

I have literally been 5 times in the past 6 months, and really enjoy it even more, every time I go. The service is on point, the food quality is FANTASTIC, and I have not ever had anything but great times when dining there. In my experience, it's one of the more understated Michael Mina restaurants, but it is most definitely one of my favorites. I have frequented many others in Las Vegas and San Francisco and this is easily top 5 on my list. 

Additionally, Bardot has a really elegant bar overflowing with tempting libations. All of your classic favorites are available, and a few that may be new for you to check out -  My recent favorite has been the MAN ABOUT TOWN: it's Rittenhouse rye, rooibos infused campari, and carpano antica sweet vermouth.. it's so elegant and satisfying. If that's not your thing, they have a mean wine list, ready to pair with your dining experience. 

On the dinner menu - Like so many others have said, I cannot get away from the FOIE GRAS PARFAIT. It's so good, so decadent, so 'just right'. It is literally one of my favorite things on any menu in Las Vegas. So simple and delicious. It makes me happy every time I get a chance to enjoy it. I have also sampled their selection of very fresh OYSTERS, the crispy and elegant ESCARGOTS BARDOT, their KING CRAB CRÊPE, and their excellent WARM BEETS & CARAMELIZED GOAT CHEESE salad. Most recently, the classic style PÂTÉ de CAMPAGNE made it's way to our table, and was absolutely perfect. I am a fan for sure. 

On one particular visit, my whole meal consisted of just starters and dessert and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Las Vegas!

For the main course, the LAMB RACK ""FRITES"" is probably my favorite dish. It's designed to be shared for two and is a really beautiful and classic presentation of rack of lamb. As well, I have loved the OAK-SMOKED DUROC PORK CHOP, but one of my all-time favorites is a well prepared LOUP DE MER. Also known as a Mediterranean sea bass, Bardot prepares theirs grilled, with caramelized lemon, fennel, and steamed potatoes. Too right!  In every case.. every meal..  perfect. 

Needless to say, if you ever have the opportunity to give Bardot Brasserie a chance.. please do. I haven't even touched on their amazing desserts and after dinner embellishments. This is a place to be savored and enjoyed. Check it out.

We went on the internet and Bardot in the Aria by Michael Mina was recommended. We called and got a reservation for 3PM which was perfect for us and happened to be opening time for the restaurant.  I was a bit skeptical before we arrived because I wanted something more classic Thanksgiving dinner than a chef's wild creation.  We got just enough of both to make it perfect. The food was simply delicious.  Every bite was superb.  It was a fixed price menu and I had no issues with any of the choices.  My wife started with the Lobster salad and I had the chestnut soup. We both liked our selections. The turkey dinner was absolutely delicious.  For dessert I had the apple tart with vanilla ice cream which was super and the perfect ending to this wonderful dinner.

The service was equivalent to the amazing food.  Our waiter, Oscar, was there when needed but not pushy. He made our meal all the more enjoyable.

By far, my favorite was:

FOIE GRAS PARFAIT w/ ruby port gelée, grilled country bread- I want to return just for this (we ordered both this & the SEARED FOIE GRAS). If you are not fond of foie gras w strong liver taste, this is the smoothest foie gras paired perfectly w sweet jam-like gelee, spread on a toasty country bread. If anything, their bread will make everything taste better. One of the best ive ever had. 

ONION SOUP GRATINÉE w/ cave-aged gruyère -
Whatever happens in the cave stays in the c...heese??  I like restaurants that champion in their basics. You cant (or you shouldnt) go wrong w french onion soup in a french restaurant. *drool drool*  big enough to share for two.

I also had BONE MARROW AU POIVRE, but too greasy for my taste.. Maybe the onion jam will make it bearable.

My boyfriend and I came here back in September on sort of a last minute dinner decision, after we napped a bit too late (as one does in Vegas after a Saturday by the pool). We booked the last reservation of the evening at Bardot, somewhere around 10pm. 

Hidden in the beautiful Aria, Bardot is a little Parisian delight! We were seated cordially at a candlelit table in the emptying bistro. The decor was adorable, the bar incredibly beautiful, and the service impeccable!

We started with wine, and found the perfect glasses per the expertise of our waiter. We decided on what I imagine to have been a seasonal appetizer at the time-- burrata with fresh stone fruit and seasonal squash. Positively scrumptious! Very refreshing, light, and an incredible blend of flavors.

We moved on to dinner, and ordered the 14oz ribeye to share and the blistered green beans to pair. Our steak and frites came out split  in advance, a very sweet gesture by the chef as well as our servers! We surely appreciated not having to awkwardly slice and section off a steak, which would surely crowd the table. We had eaten at multiple steakhouses in Vegas on our trip, and it was certain to both of us that Bardot's ribeye was the most flavorful cut with beautiful marbling. They served us the freshest, most raw horseradish per our request-- a rarity to get it so perfectly raw! The green beans with lemon and almonds were a wonderful touch to our meal that was splendid to begin with.

After dinner, the professional photographer (I believe her name was Brittany?) came along to offer us portraits, to which we happily obliged. She was an absolute sweetheart with a creative eye. We left Bardot satiated with a delightful meal with wonderful service as well as beautiful portraits we will surely cherish to remember the evening!",yQn4HAl8Yy4FGYok12motg,0,0,5,nwKwk8K1gNHpYi4v2MpBfQ
4178750,2015-06-02,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Although nothing there reminded me of Brigitte Bardot, the décor was French like many Vegas brasseries. Unlike those other brasseries, the food was better here. We only came for the daily happy hour from 5-7P, but were very impressed by this recently opened Michael Mina restaurant.

The escargot en crout was so good, we ordered another plate of the tasty bites. The mild and soft snail was deliciously encased in a puff pastry shell rather than just topped with dough. The hazelnut ""salt"" and Chartreuse butter condiments and chives and mushroom garnishes were nice complements, but most were hard to eat WITH the escargot because they didn't attach to the pastry crust. To make it easier to eat, maybe a hazelnut and mushroom cream would be fun to dip into and adhere to the pastry.

They were out of skate wings, so we tried the salmon tartare instead. It was a smart combination of both fresh and smoked salmon that avoided the unpleasant tackiness when only fresh is used. I also liked the subtle use of capers and the thickly spreadable consistency of the chive mascarpone. Another smart choice was the sliced brioche which was friendlier to bite than a shattering crostini toast.

The ""HNYB Sour"" was a solid Cognac-based cocktail with a head of egg white and a float of Beaujolais.

My flat iron steak was THE saltiest piece of meat I've ever had in my life. I only ate half because I was starving. My wife tried a piece and could not believe I had eaten so much. 

My sister in law didn't finish her rib eye for similar reasons and she's an Argentinian carnivore. 

The steak tartare was probably the only decent dish. 

If you feel like spending $300-400 on a completely subprime experience around your red meats, this is the place for you!

But I should have known once they sat us at a crummy table and I observed they had two large functions going on on both sides of restaurant (one of which was right near our table) it was going to be a rough one.  Our waiter was so preoccupied prepping the large room across from our table by mere  8 ft that we were a distraction and/or a nuisance. Here are your menus.  Here's your wine list. I'll be back in 15 minutes.  We finally ordered our drinks and they didn't show up for 16 minutes after that.  They were made but the waiter was too busy with preparing for big group to give a damn.  By this time I was starving so I had to wave him down just to order their bread with special French butter ($5).  After that I just observed him setting places in the big room.  10 minutes later I got the attention of another waiter to get us the included bread and house butter (which was better than the $5 dollar one).  We finally ordered.  The food was excellent.  I had the sole and my husband had the scallops.  Perfectly prepared.  We flagged our waiter down as soon as we could for check because the conference group had arrived in the big room with their badges around their necks and drinks in hand.  We could not hear ourselves think.  Why did they sit us their when I reserved through Open Table and marked it was our first visit their?  They knew what group was coming in!  As we waited and waited to get our waiter's attention because he was so busy opening up wine bottles and pouring glasses for people in the big room, I observed the same hostess trying to give another three top the crappy table location next to us.  They were smart enough to observe and see the cluster f that was occurring and asked for one of the booths that were completely empty.  They were denied!  I guess there was a group who reserved those booths already?  So they got slotted almost back into the bar area at a table.  Are you kidding me?  Why on earth they even opened to the public that evening is beyond me.  I see restaurants in Vegas all the time posting ""closed for a private function"".  Ok you want to be open to the public while hosting two big groups?  Then prepare for them with staff accordingly!  Restaurant management 101.  Oh, btw, completely overpriced.  Even the best steak places in Vegas do NOT charge $69 for an 8oz filet!  If you have prices like that please match with stellar service.  Wasn't even asked if we wanted another round of drinks.

Getting a reservation at this place wasn't too hard, looked it up at 7:30 and we were able to get a reservation for 8:45 and we got there right at our reservation time and were seated promptly.

My friend ordered the pork chops and I had the 1/2 chicken which came with a side of mushroom bread pudding and my friend's pork chops came with a side of mashed potatoes.  I also ordered a side of black truffle fries.  The service was amazing and I could not possibly have any complaints about that. 

The portion sizes were also just right in that we weren't left still hungry after finishing our meal nor did we have so much food on our plates that we couldn't finish it.

The food however was only alright.  Based on what we ordered, it seemed to be hit or miss.  The chicken was okay but seemed to be slightly on the saltier side, enough so that I would occasionally have to switch from drinking wine to drinking water just to wash out the salt from my mouth.  The mushroom bread pudding on the other hand was really good and I did not regret having it come as a side with my main dish.  For my friend however, his mashed potatoes weren't too great for him.  He complained that they had a strong taste and that it was so much so that he couldn't even get around to finishing the potatoes.  He had no complaints about the pork chops though.

The black truffle fries were something I highly recommend on this menu though.  They were perfectly cooked, had just the right amount of flavor and unlike my friend's mashed potatoes they were in no way overbearing to eat or taste.

All in all, this place has great service and good portion sizes, a fair sized wine menu, and a decent regular menu.  I would just recommend you ask them to go easy on the salt for the 1/2 chicken and stay away from anything that comes with mashed potatoes as a side.",JXdeAS7k9bKoqylZs16i8g,0,0,4,5GDnvmmfhHl4rhMXMi3lLg
4227059,2015-02-16,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Michael Mina does not disappoint--food had great flavor, presentation was great, and decor & ambiance were on point. Went for lunch on Sunday and was immediately impressed  by the interior of the restaurant when I walked in (esp the gold alcohol rack above the bar).
However, service was not on the same level. The restaurant wasn't very busy, but our waitress was slow and not very personable (i.e. menus weren't given to us until 5 mins after we sat down, sister ordered an Arnold Palmer which wasn't brought to the table for 15 mins, seemed irritated that we asked if she could move closer to my sister who was ordering for the table).

MUST HAVES
- French toast: a thick brick of brioche--super moist and custardy; the mascarpone and syrup was an delicious combination that added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish 
- crab crepe: packed some really good flavor; the combination of the egg, crab meat, mushrooms and the apples = perfection
- salmon benedict: perfectly poached eggs, smoked salmon was not too salty, and the bernaise sauce was the perfect consistency

OKAY TO HAVE 
- Onion soup: just your average French onion soup--price tag is pretty steep for what it is but the portion is fairly large
- escargot borgot: an interesting twist on escargot--inside a puff pastry shell w/ butter and hazelnuts. I did like it but it was cold by the time it came out to our table, which bummed me out
- hunter's waffle: waffle and egg was perfectly done and the meat was tender. 

DONT NEED TO HAVE
- croque madame: nothing special--just ur average prep of a croque madame (bread, ham, cheese, egg). This was the greasiest and heaviest out of everything we got. If u want a croque Madame that'll blow ur mind, try the one at hatfields in LA. ;)",qNqe6efRe5UQoWa_k3eN3Q,6,1,4,Gp99w_cvmCvU2msMNPGmxw

The first time I dined at this restaurant was a 4 only due to long wait to order our first drinks. However, today, I would say it's more like a 1 star-rating. Although our waitress was very nice, she was nowhere to be found. We ordered our appetizer fairly quickly but waited about 30-40 minutes for it to come out. Our order for our entrees were taken after about 30 minutes of looking around for our waitress. We seemed to not be the only ones in search of her. Since we were already frustrated about the wait, my boyfriend cancelled the rest of our order and we left. The manager ended up comping our coffee and appetizer which was nice, but I would have rather paid for a nice meal and a good experience.

I went to Bardot while staying at the Aria hotel/resort.  I honestly didn't think much of the typical fancy places in Vegas, which is maybe why Bardot was such a revelation.  Most of the fancy places are all decor and no real substance.  Bardot was the rare exception.  If I go back to Vegas, I'll be sure to dine there every night.

Bardot has your typical French decor: Beautiful tiled floor, lots of brass at the bar, and elegant seating.  

Along with that decor comes a great bar and great bartenders.  These folks are genuinely happy to see you.  The customer service here is second to none.  Bartenders are experienced and knowledgable on all beers and spirits.  I tried a few beers before deciding that Hors D'age was going to be the one.  I highly recommend it, especially considering that you can only get it at Mina restaurants (or so I was told).

Excellent service, okay food, but not worth the price. Spent $400 ($300 plus tip) since we were there on a special occasion (our 10th anniversary), but everything was so salty I barely had any room for the food because I was downing a cup of water between every bite. Every bite was like a straight sip from a salt shaker: the bread with the fancy butter that cost extra on top of the free bread and butter, the seafood tower, the lamb chops, and the steak with foie gras. It was so depressing because I was so full from water I couldn't finish my half of the foie gras (we shared everything). The giant macaron dessert was fun. I was concerned that it was kind of gimmicky but it was a decent macaron, with crisp, delicate outsides and perfect feet.

Should have stayed in LA and gone to the Arroyo Chop House in Pasadena where they make me a perfectly seasoned blue rare steak every time, and we eat like kings for $150. Too bad Fusion closed down; their steak with foie gras was orgasmic.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,1,0,3,O859xT_1l6ZXI2dovZUyKQ

I would say that the food at Bardot is no exception to that rule.  Unfortunately the service is so bad that you can't rank it any higher than a 1.  I mean I have spent time in France, I am French for crying out loud and I can't recall a time where you were supposed to be whisked away to France only to find out that the Tour Guide or in this case the hostess would be better fit working on a corner somewhere rather than guiding you on your journey. I mean I get it, I made a reservation I show you the confirmation of the reservation and somehow in your mind because it shows something different in YOUR system I am a liar.  Also when there are open tables everywhere and you still feel the need to place my party of 4 in a high traffic area, you FAIL.  

Beyond her incompetence we have the idea of the ""appetizer"".  In my book the appetizer is supposed to come out first. Hmm..apparently it is different in France (Hint: It isn't different).  They decided here at Bardot to just bring EVERYTHING at once. So that of course while you are eating one thing the other items get cold. FAIL.  If it is there policy to bring everything at once they should at least explain that?!  Oh and of course they forgot a side of frites which was to be included (not ordered separately) for a friend but it only took a half hour to get it to him.  Another glorious fail. All in all this Terrible service give this restaurant a 1 in my book and if I were you I would search for other options in this city.

4382548,2017-04-09,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"A decadent experience and meal from start to finish. When my friend suggested this as our next food adventure I was excited. This has been my list to try for awhile.

Located inside of Aria the restaurant was easy to find. Follow the signs from the casino to the restaurant area. The walk from the parking garage wasn't too bad. Bardot is in the same area as Herringbone, The Buffet, and Carbone. The inside of the restaurant feels like a French bistro and has a nice ambiance. 

Enjoying a leisurely meal we started with two appetizers and a soup. Everything sounded so great on the appetizer menu or hors d'oeuvres as it is labeled on the menu. The French bread brought out to begin was perfectly crunchy and tasty. This was a great way to enjoy the butter sauce with the crepe which we did shamelessly. 

The French Onion soup was amazing with a nice amount of bread in the soup and a broth with amazing onion flavor. The layer of cheese on top was thick and the cheese just kept coming with each bite. A decadent soup for sure. The King Crab Crepe was a flavor explosion at first bite. I could not believe how much flavor was in something seemingly so simple. Everything was fresh and the crepe was perfectly prepared. We enjoyed this dish without the sauce served on the side by mistake and still found it incredible. The Steak Tartare was fresh and flavorful. The potatoes to enjoy the tartare on were prepared like a chip were incredibly delicate and delicious.

Sweets are a necessary guilty pleasure and we were getting full so we decided to skip to dessert. Narrowing to three choices wasn't easy, but we selected Cherry Clafouti, Mille Feuille, and an Apple Tart. All three were amazing, but Cherry Clafouti was my favorite. It was a unique dessert that was like a cross between bread pudding and custard. The delicious tart cherries adding plenty of flavor and the pistachio ice cream on top was so delicious. 

The service was attentive and polite. Our waitress checked in on us frequently and accommodated our requests. Since the table was small the staff paid special attention to clearing plates frequently which I appreciated. 

I'm already looking forward to returning to Bardot for another lovely evening. This is a great spot for a nice night with a friend or a date night. The food was outstanding and one of my more notable meals lately!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,3,4,5,Rmg6LwWMtmiCDVo3ZuvR3g

I'm not sure if he heard me complain, but I noticed some improvement when he came back.  I thought he was racist because I noticed how charming he was with the Caucasians at the next table.

It's interesting that his recommendation changed from person to person. My friends who got there earlier asked for recommendations and he told them to get a set of items. Then when I asked, he told me another set of items.  

I was at a French brasserie, so I had felt like I had to get the escargot. Not escargot in butter, but this puffed pastry escargot. Next he mentioned the lobster roll was unlike any other and I can't find it anywhere. He also recommended the Hunter's waffle. I wanted one croissant for $3 and he told me I might as well get the ""bread basket"" for $10. 

I ordered pastis and the server had no idea what I was talking about. I told him, that this is a French restaurant and you must have Ricard at the bar. He checked and they brought me a glass of pastis on the rocks for $15. At that price, I should have instead ordered the $20 bottomless brunch rosé.

Everything I ordered was excellent. My favorite was the bread basket, which is more of heaven in a basket. My first attack was the canelé. I wasn't going to share that with anyone. I inhaled it. Next was the croissant which was crisp just like I've had in France. Then there was a kouign-amann and raisin pastry which I shared with my table. 

This is a Michael Mina restaurant which I've had on my list of places to eat at Vegas and I'm glad I was able to check it out during this trip. Chef Joshua Smith is the chef de cuisine and is taking French classics to another level of refinement. 

The management needs to better train the staff. I didn't feel the service level matched the restaurant quality. It did improve towards the end of my meal, but was not at all memorable. 

The food outshined the service. 3 stars service. 5 stars for the elevated take on French classics.

The architecture of the restaurant is just as gorgeous as I remembered it to be. Both upscale and elegant... Hard not to admire.

We were greeted at the host stand immediately after walking towards the restaurant. We confirmed our reservation and were escorted to a spacious booth near the back end of the restaurant, close by the open kitchen area.

We had Kim as our server who was delightful! She was very knowledgable about the menu and so personable too. She offered some great recommendations, the sea bass being one, which my friend and I decided to split as our main entree.

I would have loved to try their seared foie gras or escargot but my friend isn't the most adventurous eater and wasn't budging. We agreed to start off with the charcuterie board and share a salad. For our entree I (luckily) talked my friend into the sea bass with the help of Kim's recommendation and reassurance.

Everything. Was. So. Delicious. Even the fresh bread they first brought out with us with butter was baked to perfection! 

- Charcuterie board 
My goodness, what a variety. Came with toasted bread and a number of unique cheese and meats. Pickles, diced candied peaches, pear slices, and toasted nuts were also flavorful sides that came with the charcuterie. I'm a huge fan of meats and cheeses and was impressed with BARDOT's choices

- Endive salad 
We had this salad salad before at BARDOT's opening but remembered loving it. Endives, field greens, spinach, green apple slices, walnuts, and bleu cheese tossed in a delicious light vinaigrette. The perfect salad to share as an app

- Sea Bass
The server knew my friend and I were sharing the sea bass so they pre-portioned them separately for us. The sea bass was paired with a small assortment of grilled veggies. Cooked JUST right, the fish was flaky and very tender! My friend isn't the biggest fan of fish but she cleared her entire plate! 

For drinks we had a bottle of sparkling wine and also tried these lemon/ginger cocktails. You can never go wrong with sparkling wine and the cocktails were strong yet tasty. 

Our overall dining experience was excellent. The phenomenal service and cuisine we first experienced a year ago has not changed one bit. There's such quality in Michael Mina's restaurants and BARDOT is one of the finest.

4559501,2017-07-20,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Thank you BARDOT for such an amazing dining experience. You definitely helped make my birthday a memorable one!

I had been wanting to come here for a while, and my bf actually made reservations for us to eat here on my birthday. Everyone was extremely friendly and even wished me a happy birthday. We both had And God Created Woman, which I believe is named after the 50's French film. It was delicious. Just slightly sweet with citrus flavors that went well with the gin. Our server described it perfectly especially with the foam on top. We decided to start off our dinner with a cheese plate and oysters. The oysters were delicious and refreshing and the cheese plate, absolute perfection. We got the Blue cheese, goat cheese and the monks cheese. All of which were delicious!

We then ordered the caramelized goat cheese and beet salad, as well as the French onion soup. My bf wasn't too fond of the beet salad for the specific reason that he isn't too fond of beets (he ordered the salad), I thought it was delicious. I on the other hand bought the onion soup was good, but I felt like the cheese didn't melt properly. 

For our main entrees, my bf got the pork chop, and I the gnocchi. The pork chop was supposedly fantastic, as he described it as really smoky bacon and enjoyed every bite. The gnocchi is not going to be what you expect. It is a very creamy dish with the triple creme wedges, butter soft, and very large gnocchi's. I personally thought it was a little too hearty for me, but it was still delicious

Dessert was finished nicely as my bf surprised me with a macaron with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate. The portions here are quite large for a French restaurant, and you definitely feel like you got the most of your meal. The staff is very friendly, I would recommend coming here at least once if you are able to",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,1,0,5,tRbuHQi9MHpPb33a9MbrbA

Bardot Brasserie is a spacious, elegant restaurant located inside the Aria Hotel. They attracted me with their great brunch menu consisting of appetizing light starters, nice cheese selection and vast choice of breakfast dishes. And wines :). After carefull consideration, my fiance and I decided to share a desk of cheese as a kind of starter. They serve it with fresh bread and house mustard, seasonal jam and candied nuts on the side. The whole selection was very good and the mix of flavours suited us very well. Next, we ordered famous Hunter's waffles and french toast with mascarpone and almonds. The former was good, but not as exceptional as we thought it would, but the later, mmm... tasted heavenly. Not too sweet, crunchy but soft, just enough almond. And it was really big, definitely too much for one small person. The service was very professional and friendly, our waiter gave us some great advice.

We went her for an early dinner last Friday based simply because it was the first result on OpenTable when I was in a pinch to pick a place while on the phone. Boy did we get lucky. Bardot is great.

The bread and salted butter are to die for. I could have these for every meal and die happy (and 400 pounds).

To start i enjoyed the beef tartare which was killer. the potato chips that they provide to put the tartare on were the perfect complement to the nicely seasoned combination of quail egg and beef. Definitely amongst the best raw beef dishes I've ever had, if not the best -- and I love raw beef.

I followed this up with the Loup-de-mare which was fantastic. The fennel combined with the fish made for a perfectly balanced flavor profile and texture with each bite. I loved this so much I finished it in about 5 minutes...well before anyone else finished their meals....I just couldn't control myself.

I highly recommend Bardot and can't wait to come back and try more of the menu...now if Michael Mina would just open a restaurant in Los Angeles proper - Dana Point and Glendale aren't Los Angeles, if they were they wouldn't be in other cities.",4XxQSlRLhECpr9rcOcc6rA,2,1,5,5_7LYU1Ex89OK91M78dJwA

4593223,2015-11-16,2,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"The best brunch in Las Vegas.  

That sounds like hyperbole, since Vegas is a city overrun with brunch spots at all price points and levels of quality.  But Michael Mina's Bardot Brasserie is the real deal.  It forgoes behemoth pancakes and bottom-shelf mimosas for top-quality French gastronomy, and the payoff is amazing.

Another plus: Bardot Brasserie is one of the few brunch spots that accepts reservations, which we were lucky to have when I joined 2 friends here for a 10am Sunday brunch.  The place was totally packed.  The hostess then whisked us past gorgeous displays of breads and pastries to a beautiful table near the back, which was an excellent vantagepoint to soak in the classy decor.

We started off with a round of cappuccinos, followed by ""la boulangerie"" -- an assortment of breads and pastries, along with baguettes and butter.  Absolutely everything was fresh, warm, and packed with flavor.  I would've been happy camper calling it a day after that, but we were hungry, so we kept ordering.

For the mains, we shared a plate of ""pâté de campagne"" of pork, veal and pistachio, served with pickled vegetables, more crusty baguette, and spicy mustard.  The next course was the hunter's waffle with duck confit, poached eggs, and maltaise sauce.  Both of these were outstanding, but the hunter's waffle was truly exceptional -- an elevated and elegant twist on eggs benedict.  Somewhere in the middle of the mains, we had a bottle of ""Patrick Bottex Bugey Cerdon"" rosé, which was a delicate and smooth bubbly that paired excellently with the duck.  (Speaking of which -- service was outstanding.  Our server knew the menu inside and out, and exactly what bottle to pair with what dish.)

To round out the meal, we tasted three different desserts -- chocolate macaron, apple tarte tatin, and orange jelly candy.  All of these were pure heaven, but special props go to that chocolate macaron.   Now I know why it's one of the signature dishes of the house.  The chocolate cookie combined with the dark chocolate mousse is just pure decadence.

I can't say enough good things about Bardot Brasserie.  I hope this place keeps Vegas classy -- and my belly full -- for a long time to come.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,3,4,5,Fpeyd7E-jL6k8nXXLoIDLQ
4607738,2015-03-10,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"I had no idea what I was in for when I made my plans to hit up BARDOT Brasserie for a solo dinner.  I only knew that they were pretty new and that they have a happy hour menu with some terrific sounding selections.  I had absolutely no idea of their pedigree!  That being their association with James Beard Award-winning chef Michael Mina.

Finding this place was step one.  Fortunately I had read that it was in the neighborhood of the Zarkana theater, which turned out to be up a flight of escalators from the casino floor.  But instead of heading towards the theater, I found it to my right when heading towards the buffet, as direct neighbor to the Jean Georges Steakhouse.

I liked the little tables set for two bordering the exterior wall of the restaurant, but I headed in to the bar area to enjoy a meal made up of selections from their Happy Hour menu, available daily from 5-7pm at the bar and lounge area.  These are smaller offerings of some of their regularly priced and portioned appetizers, which is great for a single diner who wants to try a bunch of things.

Tip - eat the Escargots $6 toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter, puff pastry shells while they're hot.  They are less a wonderment once cooled.

The Duck Wings A L'Orange $4 Wood grilled duck wings, seasoned citrus, sauce maltaise were meaty and tender and arrived 3 pieces to an order, as did the escargot.

The Bone Marrow $5 Roasted bone marrow, red wine onion jam, grilled country bread was perfectly portioned for one.

So if snails don't weird you out, definitely get the escargot, but I'd order any of these again.",nl8gWLDo6U6MjqzbBmE_9A,5,1,4,7z2GoLaW30ZaeV1nmX_rBw

The bad... I'm not sure if the kitchen was backed up or lost our ticket multiple times but service, specifically attention to detail was very lacking until we addressed it with the manager.

Arrived at 9 and menus were not distributed until 10 minutes after we were seated. Drinks were ordered immediately but did not arrive until 9:25. Food was delayed until even later, 10:05 and it was only then that our server asked how we were doing.

It would be one thing if the place was packed, I'm in Vegas enough between trade shows, fight nights, and weekend getaways to understand when things get impacted but on a non-major event weekend the delay and lack of communication during the slow roll out was beyond frustrating.

The gf and I appreciated the team's effort to make it right after we addressed it but you dine at Michael Mina establishments to *not* have to think about the quality of service from the moment you walk in.

At the end of the day, mistakes happen, order tickets get misplaced, and bartenders get busy. Judging from the other diners who've been here our experience might have been the exception not the rule, but it doesn't change the fact that as a patron I went from 'This is a place I'd love to bring clients' to 'can I speak with the manager' in 65 minutes.

The house bread was also the yummy, chewy kind with room-temp. butter. Oh, and don't skip the cocktails-- the melon cocktail we had was out of this world.

The hunters waffles and the French toast. Okay, so the hunters waffles were very much new to me. Now I've had the poached egg dish many times, but not like this. I haven't had duck with it. It really was different I think. The duck would've been better if it was shredded a bit more I think, but it was very good. The french toast was MASSIVE. A gigantic brick of french toast that had a nice, somewhat bitter flavor, that leaves you so stuffed, you'll regret attempting to finish it in one sitting.

For the entree we had steak frites and salmon Benedict.... Talk about already full when these came. I had the hardest time deciding which main entree to get and these two were good. I think I would talk more about it if the starters didn't already blow me away. 

Aaaanddd of course we had to have dessert. The chocolate macaron was so good but we could not finish it haha. Definitely good for at least 3-4 unless you want diabetes for one. 

So yes to this place for that nice brunch. You will not be disappointed.",QPbXBYWCSmw6-NhVWteaWA,0,3,5,K14valEDHS18BVNXIUgJMw

Before I give a review, ask to be served by the waiter named Steve from the Ivory Coast.  He is the greatest living waiter on Earth.  When God created the greatest waiter on Earth, he made him of French Lebanese descent and he sprung out from the Cote d'ivoire.

This place replaced the missed American Fish, another Michael Mina spot.  This haunt is Mina's take on French food (greatest in the world).  The bar itself is worth in the millions.  No penny was spared creating this place and Michael's wife can be seen here every so often.

All salads and soups are solid orders.  Many of the apps are near top notch.  But what anyone cares about are the main courses.

The flank steak is ELITE.  The ribeye and all other steaks I have eaten all rate a 8 or more out of 10.  The sides are a bit too small for sharing for more than two people.  The mushrooms side is more of a pastry than a mushroom dish  Asparagus and brussel sprouts sides are really good, totally French style.  Fish dishes all rate a 8 out of 10. I had the cod, salmon and sea bass and to me reverse the order I just stated for taste and quality.

All deserts are high end.  I recommend the banana desert.

All cocktails are of high quality and all have a special flare to them.  Heck, all the dudes behind the bar are friendly, ready to serve, want to talk to you and have no heirs.",JzGXwXXri7KqkiwBP3qUpg,0,0,5,5uk_zfupJIcRkjhp4ABvrg

If you're looking for an elegant and decadent meal for a reduced price, I highly recommend checking out Bardot Brasserie's Happy Hour menu served daily from 5-7 pm. For under $60, my boyfriend and I ordered four things off the menu (and a cocktail!) Everything we ordered tasting amazing and the atmosphere felt super classy. We stopped by at the start of HH still in our day clothes and felt very underdressed compared to some of the patrons at the bar. We still received great service, regardless of how we were dressed, but if you're the type to dress up, definitely bring your A game when you come here! All the guys and gals I saw at the bar were decked out in suits and evening gowns. 

We ordered salmon tartare, steak tartare, a tartine, and a burger. The salmon tartare tasted fresh and light. I especially loved the taste of the chive mascarpone with capers on the top. I'm not normally a fan of the salty, almost fishy-like taste of capers, but the creamy richness of the mascarpone helped to balance everything out. The steak tartare (ground to order!) not only looked super aesthetically appealing, but the richness of the yolk with the perfectly seasoned ground prime steak was simply divine. My boyfriend, however, mentioned that he didn't like the sauce verte drizzled on the top, as it tasted a bit too rich and pungent for his preference. We also ordered a tartine (open-faced sandwich) with grilled shrimp and saffron roullie. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the garlic-y roullie really gave the shrimp the ""oomf"" I was looking for. The bread here is also great. I believe it's baked in house. Also, as a side note - you get free bread and butter as an appetizer. And OMG - the butter here is out of this world. Butter is always awesome, but this butter is something really special. It's so spreadable, creamy, salty, and rich! Best butter I've ever had. Seriously. 

But the true highlight of this already amazing meal? The le steakburger, made with a prime rib patty. Yup, you read that right. Prime rib. So flavorful and so, so juicy. The nuttiness of the comte cheese along with a generous spread of garlic aioli on the top just made this burger seriously next level shiz. If I recall, this was the most expensive thing that we ordered (I believe about $19), but it was so worth it. This was arguably the best burger of my life - and I've had a lot of great burgers.

Thanks to Bardot Brasserie for a dining experience that this foodie will remember forever!",I6mR0j4LsPIOhvOV-nIRSg,5,0,5,-sTCc-8IOzaxwcWHL07Zuw

Apparently, they soak the massively thick cut brioche in their custard mixture overnight to get it so moist and delicious!  It is so creamy yet light in texture and not too sweet.  You may not even need to spread that dollop of vanilla mascarpone but it is loaded with vanilla bean--yum!  It certainly adds more decadent richness to the dish.  The French toast is set off quite nicely with crunchy almond brittle.  It is also paired with an orgeat (almond) syrup, which just adds another flavor layer to the party...but honestly, the French toast on its own is superb!  This is definitely a must have if dining here for brunch.  I also added the double cut bacon (pork belly fans will love this) and poached eggs which were cooked perfectly.  It turned out to be a lot of food so next time I'll just have the French toast with the bacon!  Service and ambiance were great as well.

Bardot was beautifully decorated and very well lighted inside. The bar was very busy especially with bottomless mimosa.

We ordered steak tartare, truffle fries, French toast, and croque madame.

We started with complimentary baguette with salted butter. I know nothing about how to make butter magical, but the butter that came with was really good especially the part had salt on. I tried to use regular table salt and they just didn't taste the same. 

Steak tartare was excellent. The steak was grounded to order mixing with sauce verte and egg yolk. Severed with gaufrette potato chips. It had creamy texture and good flavor. 

Croque madame came with pain de mie, Paris ham, gruyere fondue, and a organic egg on top. It was good but it didn't wow me like the one I had in San Francisco. 

Slave girl told me the French toast was one of the best she ever had. Since I only had a bite, I would say sure, why not. It came with brioche French toast top with vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, and organic syrup. 

Truffle fries was a bit fail in my book. Sure it was done well, but I didn't get too much of truffle flavors which defeated the purpose of ""truffle"" fries. 

The service here was fantastic. It was a full house but my mimosa was never empty. Matter of fact, it was filled before I even finished the glass. On top of that, our server was also training a new server too. Great job for sure. We will go back to try the dinner menu.",YApG_XpSXamn_itlOXQCBw,2,0,4,Uc3LyXxj7zhHZihbpg_eng

I loved Bardot upon entry, we had a minor reservation snafu but the host quickly was able to take care of us. Bardot is sexy, chic with an easy sophistication. My senses were quickly stimulated and I quickly was enraptured in a laissez-faire attitude while thinking of what cocktail to have.

In my group, I had (forgive me for not having the exact names) Salmon with Beluga Lentils, started with an Endive Salad, and Lemon Meringue Tart for dessert. Salmon was robust and rich, and the Endive Salad balanced the strong flavors of the bleu cheese and endive perfectly in it's vinaigrette.

But that Lemon Meringue Tart? I'm still dreaming of it. It was THAT good.

If they offer you bread and butter here, definitely get it. That baguette is served perfectly warm and that butter is creamy.

Michael Mina isn't that everyday occasion, but I'll definitely find a reason to come back here!

We started off with a glass of wine and the steak tartare. Yum! We honestly loved it so much, we almost had a second order.

When it came down to the entrees, I went for the Lobster and my fiancé ordered the Lamb Rack. Beautiful presentation and best of all, it was delicious! I had a bite of the lamb rack and was instantly jealous of my fiancé's order. My lobster was yummy too, however, the next time I am ordering the brandy cream on the side. 

Finally, the server (who was excellent btw), insisted on dessert and coffee. We went straight for the giant chocolate macaroon (one word = HEAVEN) and had some cappuccinos. Absolutely delicious!

Great decor, very brasserie/French feeling. It was bougie and anything but pretentious, the people at the table next to us were in fanny packs (blast from the past much?)

We started by splitting a French onion soup (my first not counting what they serve at Panera) and it was deliciously indulgent. The melted Gruyere was to die for, and overall very flavorful. 

My girlfriend ordered the cod/bass (I forget which one but I'm too lazy to look it up) and I tried hers, it was quite excellent. Me, I'm a fan of a perfectly cooked roast chicken and I was served just that here. My only gripe was that the Au jus/drippings served on the side, the server poured it all over my chicken rather than letting me do it myself. Hence my bird was on the saltier end, more than I would like, but it was not unpleasant in the slightest. 

The biggest surprise was the mushroom bread pudding which came with my chicken. I didn't think two things such as mushrooms and bread pudding could be combined so deliciously but they were. My girlfriend hates Mushrooms but even she was floored by how good it tasted. 

The portions are gigantic btw so just be warned. I didn't think I could ever feel defeated by a meal but my gut was stuffed beyond doubt when I hit the 3/4th mark. My girlfriend threw in the towel much earlier so as such, neither of us could enjoy the dessert menu. However in our food coma states, we were not so secretly staring down the Mille feuille that the fanny pack folks were digging into next to us bc it looked delicious.",v_W7WPlxkvhH7garVqxCwg,0,0,4,1vx8bwD41pD3csBLrJ7EOg

It's a very casual, French restaurant, but their ambiance and bar-like atmosphere makes it quite the experience. We came at around 6pm with a reservation for four, and the table we were seated at was spacious and comfortable. The waiters were very kind, and brought us water and french baguettes to start with. The baguettes were very fresh, warm and soft on the inside while crunchy on the outside. 

We decided to skip out on the appetizers, and order entrees. We ordered a double cut rib eye, the lamb chops, and a pork chop. My brother and dad both ordered the double cut rib eye, but my dad's steak cooked medium had more flavor than my brother's steak cooked medium rare. The steak was very well cooked, and there was a great, smokey flavor. My mom's pork chop was also amazing--it had a deep, smokey bacon flavor from the bacon condiments on top. My lamb chop, unfortunately, was the most disappointing. It lacked flavor and it somewhat tasted like raw sashimi (which was, in my part, my own fault since I had ordered it medium rare). The quality of meat was great, but I wish there was more seasoning and a bit more time on the grill. 

We ended up each ordering a dessert, since everything on the menu looked amazing, and we got two baked Alaska, a macaroon, and a napoleon looking french pastry. My favorite was the macaroon, which had a lot of chocolate, but wasn't sweet at all. They also pour warm chocolate on the macaroon table side. The baked Alaska was a show in it of itself--the waiter poured flaming bourbon onto the cake to toast the marshmallow. The baked Alaska was light, but I wasn't a fan of the strong alcohol taste. 

I would give this place a 4.5/5, but I am rounding up because of the service and the amazing steak, pork chop, and macaroon dessert.

Beet salad with arugula so good-fresh and nutty arugula with hazelnuts to accent the nutty flavor, went perfectly with the goat cheese (I had to have a bite of the cheese).

Service: I've received 5 star attentive services each time I was there. My bottomless rosé was always filled up before I noticed. Huge plus for me. On my recent visit, our waitress did a great job on assisting my friend picking out the menu. 

Environment: it is a casual French place. Sometimes the noise level can be quite high which I don't mind. The decor and atmosphere makes me feel like I'm actually dining in Paris. 

Food: I had more brunch experiences here than dinner. I've enjoyed my brunch items each time. Although I was disappointed that lobster Benedict is no longer on the menu. Since it's been a few years when I had the dinner here, this review is purely based on brunch. Get BOTTOMLESS rosé! For $25, it's so worth it. I also really enjoy the foie gras parfait here. It's not too salty nor it has the gaminess. The steak tartare and Escargot are also good appetizer choices to share among the table. The bread here is so yummy. My croissant Benedicts were delicious.

The menu isn't huge but does offer a pretty decent amount of options. One of my biggest complaints is the prices for what you are getting. I mean I work in fine dining and totally understand having to charge top price for quality ingredients but this place seemed to have just randomly started assigning outrageous prices all over the menu. Not to mention I felt guilt tripped by the server for not wanting to order a bottle of wine, like I'm sorry I wasn't looking for wine tonight I'm just as pleased with my beer and my bfs cocktail stop asking me if I'm sure. And the sommelier was rude, if u are going to ask how a meal was at least pretend to even listen to the response before walking away. Now onto the food cuz as I said I work in the industry and respect quality food at a high price, but even there the food was lacking. We had the oysters, good standard oysters nothing too special. Then we had the escargot which I wanted to love, but honestly wrapping them in the pastry totally took away everything and that's all you could taste, very disappointed. I had the NY Strip which was fine, once again nothing special or stand out about it and mine seemed a little too fatty, a good 1/4 of my steak was all fat which I know creates flavor but when you are getting a 12 Oz steak and at least 3oz of it is straight fat it's disappointing. My bf had the lobster which was good except the fact the bernaisse sauce overwhelmed the dish so much he couldn't even enjoy it. Plus is side of polenta with mushrooms and peas was so under seasoned we each took 1 bite and pushed it to the side to never be touched again. Overall a disappointing experience, neither of us wish to return again and defn will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future. With so many great restaurants in Las Vegas this one defn should be skipped.",fFuRXH7qIjoZdRwKeILwgQ,0,0,2,H_ymn5_noaFaGWCO3vPz5Q

4957515,2015-12-14,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"My bf and I were excited to try Bardot for dinner based on pictures I had seen in IG and review on here.  We were even more thrilled to find out it was by Michael Mina.  

We started with the escargots and foie gras terrine.  The escargots were prepared different from what I am used to and were beautifully presented.  IMO I think the escargot were a tad dry and chewy based on the cooking method.  The foie gras terrine was rich, creamy and just perfect.  It went very well with the crusty bread.  

For our entree, we split the bone-in rib-eye with the horseradish creme, side of mac and cheese and mushrooms.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust.  I love the look of the mac and cheese which tasted like an adult updated version of the blue box from our childhood.  The mac and cheese was extremely salty for my taste which was too bad.  

Our meal was delicious and our server was very nice and sweet.  But as the meal progressed, she was non-existent.  She came back to check on us once and we never saw her again.  When my bf went to the restroom, waitstaff stopped by our table a couple of times but never picked up the empty dishes nor did they fold his napkin.  This is what I would expect.  

Overall, I might come back to Bardot.  With all the competition Las Vegas has to offer, I feel they really need to step it up in the service dept.",w8BXwSifW-NGgpugpTceOw,0,0,3,o2oMrBu-LfHgl1eqY7Tuzg
4958360,2015-05-09,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Had a very good, but not great, dinner at Bardot on a Friday evening.  Bardot has a large dining room, and when it is full (as it was when we dined there) it can be quite noisy.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it creates a good atmosphere.  But, if you are celebrating an anniversary or looking for a place to propose, I probably would look someplace else.  It'd be tough to get a romantic evening with this atmosphere.

We were seated in a large, and very comfortable, booth for our evening.  It made passing items a little tougher, but I liked it overall.  We were approached very quickly by our server and I immediately asked for the sommelier.  I really liked this guy, we told him what we were looking for, price range, and when we wanted them.  He took care of the rest, bringing wine out as we either finished a bottle or finished a course.  It was great, he only brought us fantastic stuff, and it prevented us from having to get the list out every time we needed something new.  Since none of us are knowledgeable about French wines, it was nice to tell him what we liked and have him handle it.  And, he didn't try to upsell us, he stayed within our stated budget.

As this group typically does, we shared a lot of dishes.  To start, we had the:  escargots, the royale shellfish platter, the foie gras parfait, the charcuterie board, and the hearth-fired marrow.  All were fantastic, but my favorites were the charcuterie board and marrow.  The marrow was buttery and rich, just like it should be.  It was fantastic on the toast points provided.  Were I to eat here again, I'd order two of this appetizer.  The charcuterie board had so much stuff on it we had to ask for more toast.  The pate and foie gras were excellent, which is no surprise.  The chilled shellfish was also great, save the oysters.  They were on the small side and weren't very flavorful.  The table agreed that these were the weakest part of all of the appetizers, and they are the reason Bardot doesn't get 5 stars from me.  I expected much better oysters from this place.  The escargots were served in puff pastry, which I'd not had before.  But, they had the traditional buttery rich flavor and were still winners.

For dinner, we shared:  Parisian gnocchi, croque madame, and the lamb crown roast.  The gnocchi was PHENOMENAL, probably the best gnocchi I've eaten.  It was served with wild mushrooms, goat cheese, and roasted garlic (never a bad addition to any dish).  My second favorite was probably the madame.  It was cheesy, hammy, decadence.  It's what grilled ham and cheese sandwiches want to be when they grow up.  My ""least"" favorite was the lamb.  And, it was still fantastic.  Juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and served with a very tasty gravy on the side.  It came with a few frites, which were perfectly fried and seasoned well.  We selected some very solid entrees.  

Service was very good throughout the evening.  The place was crowded, but we never felt like we were waiting for anything.  I'd absolutely eat here again.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,2,4,dI8KbUKytDfI2VobV3AHGQ

For starters, I had the King Crab Crepe, together with Black trumpet mushrooms, sunny-side egg, normandic cider beurre blanc. Where have you ever had a crepe prepared like this? Anywhere? Except maybe in France? All of the ingredients were blended beautifully to perfection! 

My main entree was the King Salmon Aux Lentilles, an organic Scottish salmon, beluga lentils, smoked tomato vinaigrette. Another perfect dish, indeed! The salmon was seared on the outside so the salmon skin was crunchy! After searing the outside, chef baked the salmon just enough, but leaving enough of the inside undercooked, making for another beautifully inspired dish!

For dessert, I had the Frozen Paris Brest, hazelnut ice cream, chocolate cremieux, and salted caramel. Lily, while preparing the utensils for my dessert, provided me not only with a spoon, but also a fork and knife! I jokingly asked, wow, do I really need a knife for my dessert? She laughed! When I got my dessert, yes, I'll need my knife! LOL. The dessert was actually 6 separate ice cream sandwiches craftfully connected together! It was like eating 6 ice cream sandwiches!

Props to my server Lily, who was warm and inviting through my journey through this whole experience! I will never forget her, and be sure to make a return visit here with other friends, if not on this trip, for sure in the future!

The restaurant was very elegant, high end and high class! The dishes are pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for! Right? There are flat screen TVs at the bar to make for more ""casual"" feel! It's a good thing we had an early dinner, 6:30, because by 7:00pm the place started to fill quickly!

4982567,2017-11-29,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Very nice expensive French restaurant at the Aria.  Even the cheapest steak ($49 flat iron) is exquisite -- they clearly make use of sous vide to get a butter texture out of the meat.  I liked the brandy-peppercorn sauce, though it wasn't the best one I've had.  I almost wish I hadn't let the waiter convince me to get that instead of the blue cheese fondue.
 
The frites that accompany the steak were good, but a little salty and a little oily.  I did like the crispness and lack of starchiness.  The lobster bisque was very good as was the bread & butter on the table.  The bread is a french sourdough and the butter is smooth, spreadable, and the right temperature.

Service was good, but not fast even after we told them some members of our party were going to a show.

5022961,2016-11-04,6,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"I'd previously dined at Bardot Brasserie back in March on my last trip to Las Vegas and was unimpressed.  Not one to be deterred, the wife and I went there to see if happy hour on a Monday evening was a better experience.  While we didn't take advantage of the happy hour drink specials (I had a regular priced cocktail, a Vieux Carré instead), we did partake in the food off of the HH menu.  We shared orders of the Prime Steak Tartare and the Braised Short Rib Tartine.  I'll admit without any shame that I'm a cocktail snob.  My drink possessed all of the expected notes of the classic Vieux Carré, however, it didn't seem properly chilled.  Since it didn't taste over-diluted, I can only guess that either my drink wasn't sufficiently stirred or it was served in warm rocks glass.   Either way, it wasn't as cold and as good as it should've been.

Our food was, similarly, hit or miss.  The steak tartare was served on thin, waffle-cut, potato chips.  It was tender, meaty, and flavorful.  It was a hit with us.  The Braised Short Rib Tartine was an unfortunate miss.  The braised short rib on the tartine was rich in flavor, moist and tender.  It was made even richer with the fried egg that also came atop the tartine.  The downfall of the dish was the bread itself, which was overbaked, required sawing through it with a knife to cut it into halves for sharing, tough, and very chewy.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine and it wasn't worth the time and hassle of sending it back.  Still, for whatever reasons, in my experience, Bardot Brasserie continues to be the outlier in an otherwise excellent group of Michael Mina restaurants in Las Vegas.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,7,4,3,mjWOB2pX_n5Uc58Xn65tAA

 Now to the GOOD specifics:

The atmosphere here is lively and fun. It has a great vibe and much energy. Our server, Nelson, was wonderful. He was polite, knowledgeable, and seemed to really care about us. Our main dishes were fantastic. I had the Filet Mignon and my friends both had the Sole Meuniere. They were both top notch. The flavor and quality are worthy of a 5 star rating. 

Now the NOT SO GOOD specifics:

We had ordered an $88 bottle of Katheryn Kennedy Cab. from the Sommelier (sorry I don't have his name). As often happens, I expected him to counter with a similar wine up sell. He did that with a much higher end Katheryn Kennedy selling for $700! I understand sales and up selling very well, but that is a huge jump and bad business. Who knows, maybe an up sell of $20-$30 would have worked but if I'm ordering an $88 bottle of wine I can't be up sold for a bottle more than my round trip flight from New York!

As great as the main dishes were, the side dish and dessert were lacking. We shared the side dish of Blistered green beans (lemon butter & almonds). Well they were shockingly tasteless. We also ordered the chocolate macaroon for dessert and it was average at best. 

The main dishes, atmosphere and Nelson the server were so good I was thinking 5 stars here most of the evening. I had to take 1 star away for the side dish, dessert and suggestion from the Sommelier.

Hey - 4 stars is fantastic and I will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Maybe Bardot can up sell me to a 5 star rating next time :)",qnOkZ1mOfLVCIBPMfyOStg,2,1,4,fG8pAdKuTnW96Jt8ckiJmg

I split the above French toast and a croissant Benedict with the short rib. Adds a little more substance to your breakfast and has some fantastic flavor.

A casual modern brasserie that can challenge the best in Paris. Refinements to the menu and subtle changes to classic dishes have greatly improved the restaurant quality.  Continued innovation from the bar further heighten the experience.

Brunch, offered Saturday and Sunday, is a great way to sample the menu. The classics tartare, excellent. Hand cut prime beef mixed with coarse grain mustard and a farm fresh egg yolk.. Slathered on warm toasted baguette. Ahhhh.  Not to be outdone the escargot, tender wine braised snails surrounded by puff pastry and topped with hazelnuts and a chartreuse garlic butter. Good eats. The king crab crepe, rich goodness as the sweetness of the crab is heightened by a cider beurre blanc.  A sunny side up egg adds a velvety mouth feel and sautéed trumpet mushrooms, the classic earthiness.

The piece de resistance, and ungodly French onion soup. Beefy intensely packed full of deeply caramelized sweet onions, braised short rib, a poached egg, and black truffles, then topped by layer of melted gruyere cheese and more truffle. Mix it up and enjoy the richness of the egg as the flavors blend harmoniously together,  The portion sensibly reduced for brunch. Get this.

A good selection of cheeses, mostly imported, and a very well cooked, chilled seafood tower (king crab, lobster, oysters on the half shell, shrimp) also work with endless pours of rose ($20).

Dinner adds an excellent veal sweet bread starter. Braised turnips and trumpet mushrooms add to the enjoyment of the pillowy texture and creamy taste of the sweetbreads. Standout mains include an excellent bouillabaisse, filled with perfectly cooked sweet scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, cod, calamari, all swimming in a saffron infuse tomato broth. Outstanding. Carnivores, do not pass on the well trimmed, simply seasoned, and perfectly cooked rack of lamb.  Meaty with just a hint of gamey funk.

5119358,2015-06-24,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"This place is hot for a reason, it is amazing!  Out of the many high end restaurants I have been to in Vegas this year, the only one that beats Bardot is Picasso.  I was a little worried because I found the Micheal Mina restaurant at Bellagio to be pretty disappointing.  However, it is obvious there is major passion for this venue from either Mina or the executive chef as every item in every dish was executed with care and attention to detail.  First off, duck wings ""a l'orange"" is absolutely a brilliant idea and were every bit as tasty as you could want.  The accompanying whipped orange sauce was divine, came in a burnt hollowed out half-orange which somehow added extra complexity to the flavor.  Amazing!  The baguette and French butter were very good, up to the quality at Bouchon.  I went with the roast chicken as it's supposed to be the signature dish here, I usually would have ordered the cod but I had to admit this dish was beautifully prepared.  The ""mushroom bread pudding"" will be more like thanksgiving stuffing to us Americans and was delicious when the vin juane sauce was poured over the top.  For dessert an expert apple tarte tatin, a notoriously hard dish to get right and this was the best one I've ever had.  I only wish there had been two scoops of the artisan ice cream, so creamy and tasty.  

Servers were running around like crazy and things are far from polished on that end.  Only the person who brought my wine (a great glass of Sancerre) seemed to have everything under control.  The server who brought my chicken missed the pronunciation for the sauce. This is still a pretty new place but I think they could invest more in training the staff.  Also, although the space is pretty the noise level is pretty high.

Definitely check this place out.  There were many Europeans dining there that night and I can see why.",9R66qSElDudAvga9x91D9Q,0,0,5,4mSCcKQ7YjdsYHT9yibcig
5123684,2016-09-16,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"This place is an amazing gastronomic experience! We were at the Aria for a work conference and spoiled for choice, but this ended up being our favorite as evidenced by repeat visits. When you walk in the first thing that strikes you is the floor with these tiny tiles that I swear shimmer like diamonds. If you've ever done a DIY project, you know how much work goes into laying tiny tiles and that let me know right off the bat that I was in for a fine dining experience.

The hostesses are lovely, it didn't seem to matter whether we had a reservation or was simply walking in - they were gracious both ways. Walking in the bar is immediately to your left and it's set up beautifully. The ambience is so lovely, like an upscale Parisian bistro/cafe. The customer experience is also top notch and they are very much attuned to when to serve and when to interrupt. 

Our dinner included:

French 75s: perfectly bubbly and lemony made! We asked for this drink at Alibi, Lift, Julian Serranos and none of them came close to Bardot's. Seriously, I had 4 in a row and did not pay the price in the morning. 

Classic Shrimp Cocktail: certainly passable, but nothing special - the shrimp is large and the sauce seemed standard. I would liked a bit more horseradish to kick it up. 

Charcuterie Board: this is an exquisite group appetizer with housemade pâté, pork rillettes (similar to pate), saucisson sec (thick, dry cured sausage), and bayonne ham. It was served with crostini type bread and was unbelievably flavorful!

Onion Soup Gratinee: this includes classic beef broth, baguette crostini, cave-aged gruyère. I added the beef bourguignon and black truffle, & omitted the poached egg. This soup was everything onion soup should be: flavorful broth, super cheesy topping, caramelized onions, I could go on. It was spectacular and filling!

Roasted Beets & Caramelized Goat Cheese Salad: this came with roasted red/gold beets, wild arugula, toasted hazelnuts, and tossed in a cassis vinaigrette. The beets were delicious but the goat cheese came in a round block and it wasn't that appetizing once you deconstructed the salad. It was yummy, but I would prefer for them to add the goat cheese in chunks. 

Double Cut Ribeye: oh my god, this cut of ribeye and the beef fat fries were simply unbelievable! I made the mistake of filling up on the onion soup before this and regret that decision to this day. But the half that I was able to consume was incredible. I can't remember what sauce I ordered on the side, but I didn't eat it because the steak needed no doctoring up.",Krgb0K0z9WZs1YaXYJD5vw,2,0,5,JQWOQu-sTvapu-d-CxZatQ

The surprising winner here being an out of this world Creekstone Prime Rib, putting to shame anything that you've yet encountered with the prime rib label. Both flavor, texture and welcomed array of accompanying sauces putting to rest any preconceived perception of the classic dish. Order!

The Smoked Salmon Paris Brest taking same route, with an explosion of flavor and balance of taste, jading every lox and bagel forward. The caviar elevating even further and Chive Mascarpone adding a subtle sweetness and fresh bite.

And last but not least, the new Beef Wellington for Two, a generous portion, arguably enough for Four, with a fair spread of other enjoyables. Delicate beef wrapped in Prosciutto, cooked in a flaky puff pastry and stuffed with Mushroom Duxelles and soaked in Foie Gras-Madeira Veloute. Mouthwatering!

First time I was at the bar and second time (this review) was at main dining room.  Highlight of the food I've ate and highly recommend: stick with their burger and you can't go wrong. 

Lobster thermidor at $76 was over cooked. Also. why such a small lobster tail for that price? This is the reason I knocked down a star too. I think my local grocery has larger lobster tails than this! 

The foie gras appetizer was great, but why on earth did they add the lentils. Not necessary and kind of ruined the delicate piece of foie gras. 

Sea bass was a quite large dish and tasted great. A really good size portion too. 

Service at the bar was way more friendlier than the waiter we got. He was just an order taker and really didn't have any charm or personality.  Thus the other star drop, bringing this to a 3 star review.

5279417,2018-03-29,3,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"If there is one 'problem' with friends and family visits it is mostly deciding which Restaurants to dine at, the balancing act of personal favorites and places that will please a variety of palates not all that tough here in Sin City but trimming a ""best of the best"" list becoming more difficult as everyone continues to raise the bar, though few have gone so far as to reinvent a genre like Josh Smith at Bardot Brasserie.

Now sailing smoothly in year three, a similar space from Celebrity Chef Michael Mina called Margeaux since opened in Chicago, it was alongside five others including four first-timers that seats were taken at a rounded table on Saturday night, familiar servers bustling around a jammed-packed room with music chiming overhead and the scene not dissimilar to what one will find in Paris or Lyon at 9:00pm, but here shifted a few hours earlier.

Recently transitioning from Winter to Spring, a ""seasonal"" change from Chef Smith and his team not merely a shift in set-ups but entailing the invention of several new plates, it was with an opening glass of Champagne that friends new and old exchanged cheers before slathering world-class Butter on Baguettes now served by the basket, a sweet n' salty Endive and Blue Cheese Salad the first new dish of the evening presented alongside ground-to-order Tartare and silky smooth Mousse that even those who claim not to like Liver found irresistible.

Never lacking for quality ingredients or creativity, a second plate of Foie Gras served seared atop Wild Rice with diced Root Vegetables providing a foil to Cabbage Agre-Doux, those looking for a highlight from the new menu would do well to order a plate of charred Octopus served spicy with White Beans while Bardot's Bone Marrow remains another good choice, though the presentation is not quite as eye-widening as Jean Georges Steakhouse next door. 

Moving at a comfortable pace with serviceware replaced and glasses refilled frequently it was with Laguiole Knives in hand that entrees were served in two rounds as the table soon filled, Chef Smith's Beef Wellington once again outperforming any other seen to-date by anyone present while Duck recently added to the menu showed similar to the Foie Gras, a sizable Breast with crisp skin resting earthy ingredients brightened up by the addition of Huckleberries adding just a touch of natural Sugar.

Getting even more Spring-like with Lamb and Scallops, two cases where a change in set-up improved nicely-prepared proteins with a plethora of seasonal Produce that all contributed something novel yet complimentary, it was at the request of Josh that guests next weighed in on a concept dish, the fact that there is no literature on Buckwheat Pate a Choux not as issue for the locally born Chef as each Dumpling was indistinguishable from standard Flour save for a light nuttiness that contributed to the forest-floor  medly of Morels, Cepes, Black Truffles and Asparagus.

Pumping the brakes for Cheese, a good selection highlighted by the same Tete de Moine served atop Gnocchi plus runny Perail de Brebis and housemade Condiments on thick slate, it was with Espresso cleansing the palate that every single one of Bardot's Desserts arrived in a truly Grand Finale, a special request also seeing a block of fluffy Brioche French Toast held over from Brunch and the only ""disappointment"" being that some were already too full to enjoy as much as they'd have liked to while one in particular had given up Chocolate for Lent.

***** Say what you will about Michael Mina, Celebrity Chefs, high-volume Restaurants or Las Vegas in general, the simple fact is that when looking world-wide at ""Brasseries"" from North America to France there are none outperforming Bardot day-in/day-out or plate-for-plate and if Chef Smith were in New York or Los Angeles he'd be getting James Beard nominations while spots like Le Coucou would be forced to step up their game rather than resting on their laurels.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,5,D64HNPL3hk_e9j9AyRPMcg

I was stuck ordering a $30 salad that was just a bunch of lettuce leaves and a boiled chicken. My friends had the duck confit, the French toast and American breakfast and they were not impressed for the price that we paid!

It wasn't on the cocktail menu but the server assured me that they made it very well, and he was right. It was excellent. We then had a cab. for dinner, which was very good as well. 

For appetizers, I was planning on getting the foie gras parfait based on the reviews, but the server explained that this was more of a mousse, and if I was looking for a real piece of foie gras, to get the seared foie gras lyonnaise. OMG, it was amazing. The lentils and the caramelized shallots were a perfect complement. We also got the tuna tartare, it was okay. 

For dinner, I ordered the rack of lamb, medium rare. These were served over creamy polenta. It was amazing. The lamb chops were thick and juicy and cooked perfectly. Some of the best lamb chops I've had. Unfortunately, there really was no room for dessert.

5450039,2015-10-10,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"What a wonderful discovery!  We went to Bardot's for our anniversary and had an amazing experience.  Bardot is located in Aria, but you can easily avoid having to deal with any Strip traffic by coming into City Center from Harmon and parking at the North Valet (we are locals and weekend traffic on the Strip is about as much fun as having your tonsils removed with a grapefruit spoon).  Bardot's is on the 2nd level promenade, so no casino noise or flashing lights, just a nice relaxed restaurant area fronted by a very cool lounge.  From the series of small tables sitting outside, to the interior decor, it feels very authentic...reminded me very much of Brasserie du Louvre and this time I didn't have to sound like Quasimodo trying to speak French.  We were greeted warmly and once seated we were presented with an anniversary greeting card, with a handwritten message welcoming us for our special night, signed by all the wait staff...it was such a nice touch and really kicked the night off perfectly.  The wine list is quite extensive, including the by the glass section and in addition to the expected selection of French wines, it was nice to see some old favorites from California.  We started off with half a dozen oysters...it was our anniversary after all  ;-)   My wife ordered the King Crab crepe as her main (she's little and fills up fast) and since my favorite French meal is still Moule Frites, I sort of created my own dish by ordering Mussels Marinieres and added the pommes salardaises...three words....Stu-Pen-Dous!!!  The oysters were excellent, very fresh, briny and good...I preferred the West coast to the East coast.  My wife's crepe was rich, savory and incredibly flavorful...each element was there, the rich flavor of crab, the nuttiness of the mushroom the amazing creamy sauce all set off in a buckwheat crepe.  My mussels were perfect...yeah, I work out...okay, so my muscles are a bit old and tired compared to what they are serving up at Bardots, but you get the idea.  The mussels were all perfectly cooked, plump and bursting with flavor and the sauce was a little slice of buttery garlic heaven!  There was plenty to soak up my fries before plucking out a mussel to combine for the perfect bite!  The mussels come with one of Bardot's French Baguettes, which honestly could be its own food group, and the sauce that was left over after my french fry dipping was quickly devoured with the amazing bread.  If plate licking were acceptable, it would have been on!
When it came time for dessert, we opted for the ""Frozen Paris Brest""...mainly because I wanted to be able to order a Brest out loud and not get smacked for it!  It came out displayed on a plate which read Happy Anniversary in chocolate writing...a very nice touch!  The dessert, like everything else we had was amazing, flavorful and absolutely irresistible...hazelnut, chocolate and this amazing salted caramel!  
My only suggestion for Bardots would be to give the Sommelier a few assistants, she was very knowledgeable about her craft, but she shouldn't also have to be in charge of pouring every glass of wine...Yes, I'm a lush and it pains me to see an empty wine glass.
All in all a wonderful evening at an amazing restaurant...we will definitely be back!",FPbo46Fc3pKrSMlIn_hv7Q,1,0,5,PYqoDIHgfjdmPEI7wQJbng

The menu is enticing, service absolutely 5 stars, prices are very fair and ambiance is perfection.  The catch is....the food was mehhh 3 stars at best.  Considering this is a restaurant review, I have to base my stars on the quality of the food.  What we ordered:

1. Foie Gras Parfait- 4* delicious and creamy but it was more filler (i.e. cream) than foie gras.  still very yummy though
2. Beef Wellington for 2 people- 3* SO SALTY!! the filet was cooked beautifully and that along with the foie gras sauce would have been perfection together.  But the dry outer crust and the insanely salty duxelle made it unpalatable.  My hubby and I had to scrape the outer parts off and just eat the steak and sauce.  Plus it was $130 for the two portions and it didn't even come with a side.  That's expensive even by Vegas standards.
3. Black truffle french fries- 0* terrible.  The first batch we got was stale and not even warm so we sent it back.  The second batch we got was still stale and the truffle flavor wasn't even detectable.  You could see the black flecks of supposed truffle but there was absolutely no taste of truffle at all.  We didn't want to be a bother and send it back again so just left it untouched.  tragic

We skipped dessert because we didn't want to be disappointed further.  Our bill amount to $230 including a glass of wine.  Not bad- but not worth it.

The king crab crepe was just so so.. flavor or texture did not impress me at all. The foie gras parfait spread was nice and creamy but the toast that came along with it was too thick and it made the whole appetizer unbalanced.

The initial visit had my wife and me tapping out after indulging in 5 appetizers and for the most recent visit, we went with six appetizers and two entrees for a party of 3.  PEI mussels, dayboat scallops and king salmon aren't normally things I turn my nose up to, but French food occasionally tickles my snobby bone, so I said ""Reste loin de moi!"" to all that.  

The wood grilled duck wings a l'orange belong at a tailgate party for millionaires.  That distinct flavor that only duck has went splendidly with the blood orange glaze and the maltaise could challenge many a wing sauce to a duel and win.  This is an excellent starter to share or hog all to yourself.   

Whether it's grilled, torchon, parfait, or rolled up into balls and thrown into my mouth by a circus clown, foie gras is fucking awesome.  Their seared version with beluga lentils, caramelized shallots and prune confiture was everything I was hoped for, everything I need.  Lightly smushing and spreading the prune on top with the back of a spoon ensured a nice tart fruit flavor in each bite.  

Not my choice to order, but I found the filet mignon to be a total snoozefest.  Although I could NOT get enough of the ""beef fat fries"" that it came with.  Can I preorder ""beef fat cake"" for my birthday??  Crunchy, salty, and borderline immoral, I wished more places offered this.  Get the stellar ""Lamb Rack Frites"" for an entrée over steak and ask for a side of fries.  

- Ask for bread with the prime steak tartare.  It's much better than the potato chips.
- The ""onion soup gratinee"" was too sweet for me.

Her immediate response was not ""Thank you for coming to celebrate with us or Happy Birthday"" but instead it was a blunt - ""We do not give free dessert.""  Ummm.... really?!  Did I ask for free?!  I gave her a disgusted look and said, could the kitchen put a candle or something on a creme brulee or cake?!  She didn't even apologized for her tactless comment and simply said, ""We can write Happy Birthday on the plate.""  I replied and told her, ""Yes, will you please ask the chef to do that after our brunch?"" and she smiled (finally!) and said she'll be back to take our order.  After what seems like forever, she came back and took our order.  She recommended the Hunter's Waffle, which I ended up getting.  Sad to say, Michael Mina would have been disappointed at the dried, tasteless meat that was supposed to be ""duck confit"".  I never add salt to my meal, but I had no choice this time to give it some flavor!  I tried to catch our server's attention to let her know but she was no where to be found.  We tried to flag down other servers but all of them seem to have their eyes trained on looking down on the floor or tables -- and not on customers.  Granted -- it was a Saturday and they were busy but seriously, I was NOT impressed by the slow service -- or should I say the lack of service.  The only reason I gave this place a 2 star is because my honey's beef short ribs croissant benedicts was tasty.

The restaurant is alive with energy, the drinks potent, the menu selection is celestial, and the service PERFECT.  I was in with a large party, and our server delivered a mix of seasoned professional with comic relief.  Being a picky pescatarian, I was offered a special plate from Chef, although I declined.  I was so touched that the Chef would make something special for me, and delivered such an amazing epicurean experience, I couldn't stop raving about the food while there that our server arranged to bring out Chef Jeannie.  She was such a great sport and chatted with us for a while.  

We started with assorted appetizers, and all were exceptional.  I had the Salad Bardot, and the Salmon Aux Lentils.  Both were 10's.

If you're familiar with Balthazar in NY, it reminded me very much of that restaurant.  It was busy/buzzing but not pretentious or snobby.  Our server was a rarity - a handsome, 50-something, funny/flirty French guy.  I wish we had him at all the French restaurants we've been to.  Even mom couldn't get over his looks lol.  Between him and the helpers, we wanted for nothing the entire evening. (Although he did try to make me feel bad about getting tap water for the table when I ordered sparkling for myself.)

To start, we went with the special bread and butter to which our server said he wanted our opinion on how it compared to the regular bread service.  The fancy butter was definitely more flavorful.  But both were delicious and we ate a buttload.

We also ordered the beef tartare and foie gras parfait.  Both also very delicious.  I'm a huge fan of both dishes in general and Bardot does them well.  We sure did layer on that foie gras parfait very thickly...yum!  Mom got the French onion soup and she loved it.  She shared a little but otherwise, went to town on the pastry crust and soup.

To be honest, at this point, we were feeling really full already (especially mom) but we still hand our entrees coming.  Mom and hubby both got the 14oz ribeye with fries.  I got the duroc pork chop to be different.

Mom's ribeye was pure decadence.  So much marbling and so well cooked to the medium rare we asked for.  Wow.  My pork chop was also very delicious though I should have gone with my instincts and asked for it to be done at medium instead of well done.

We were so stuff we had to skip dessert.  Our server understood completely.

    BARDOT Brasserie, Las Vegas' debut French concept from James Beard award-winning chef Michael Mina, is now open for dinner and weekend brunch at ARIA Resort & Casino. Paying homage to the skillful culinary techniques, celebrated libations and sexy atmosphere for which The City of Light is renowned, Chef Mina has created a stylish and unforgettable interpretation of a Parisian brasserie in the center of The Strip.

    Created by Bishop Pass Interior Architectural Design Studio, BARDOT's space exudes a dark and sexy, almost enigmatic atmosphere. I couldn't believe this was former American Fish's space, it's lavishly beautiful, chic, and elegant at the same time. 

    BARDOT's main dining room offers a traditional yet luxurious dining space. Walls of black lacquer are paneled with gold pen striping, surrounding a series of Parisian columns. Burgundy leather booths and bistro-style tables spread across a pristine marble floor, where guests can sneak a peek inside the restaurant's show kitchen as they watch their meals come to life.

    Sidewalk Café - A nod to Parisian sidewalk cafes, BARDOT features intimate seating outside of the restaurant for an entertaining dining and people-watching experience. Situated in the courtyard overlooking ARIA's second-floor promenade, the locale's French-inspired storefront and high windows transport guests to a 20th century literary café in Paris.

    Innovative Cocktails by none other than Mina Group's Director of Cocktails Carlo Splendorini and ARIA's Mixologist Craig Schoettler salute French drinking tradition with an inventive beverage menu. The restaurant's cocktail program combines the best of French culture and Las Vegas style. Signature sips include And God Created Women, a satisfying layering of French spirits and egg whites; and the Voltaire, a cider-based cocktail that dazzles the senses with baked apple bitters and housemade ginger syrup. 

    Finest Wines - Wine Director Kim Wood curated one of the most extensive by-the-glass programs, as well as the largest selection of French wines in Las Vegas at BARDOT, highlighting the finest small production and rare vintages from across the globe. 

   Happy Hour at Bar and Lounge 5-7 PM daily, very reasonable at $2-$6. Try these dishes: 

- PRIME STEAK TARTARE $6 sauce verte, slow cooked egg, gaufrette potatoes

- ESCARGOTS $6 toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter, puff pastry shells

- DUCK WINGS À L'ORANGE $4 wood grilled duck wings, seasonal citrus, sauce maltaise

- BONE MARROW $5 roasted bone marrow, red wine onion jam, grilled country bread

   The brunch menu is pricier, of course, but dinner is by far the best. 

- FOIE GRAS PARFAIT ruby port gelée, grilled country bread - delicious

- ONION SOUP GRATINÉE you must add Périgord truffle, braised oxtail & soft poached egg. 

- HEARTH-FIRED MARROW burgundy onion jam, grilled country bread, so tasty!

-  CARLSBAD MUSSELS MARINIÈRES garlic butter, dolin vermouth, warm baguette, this broth was flavorful, well balanced, and the mussels were perfect in size. 

- Les Steak Frites - a must try, with filet mignon and  foie gras butter sauce, ummm it was so tender and melting in your mouth good!

    And don't forget to try the Champagne Cart with my favorite Champagne KRUG GRANDE CUVÉE REIMS is only $38 by the glass! 

    Service by the same GM of American Fish before, a Michael Mina Group veteran Roberto Liendo, always a pleasure to dine here. I'm looking forward to return and try other dishes.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,8,4,5,HAVxY-6vdWfUdapkyHWQow

The service was amazing (we had a group of 11 tucked into a table near the front), the food was fantastic, and decor transportive. I feel like not enough people have mentioned the great deal of the $25 bottomless rose (still or sparkling) special that a bunch of people ordered with brunch. Our server, Latisha, was very accommodating and kind to our group. She even kindly split the checks into about 5 groups!

The french bread served prior to the meal was to die for: super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. As a novice bread baker, it really got my creative juices going. I certainly feel the need to go and try out a variety of french baguettes until I find something that resembles that bread! 

For the two of us: french onion soup $18 was just amazing. You can tell the cheese wasn't crazy heated under a salamander for tons of time prior to serving. The broth was deep and flavorful with the perfect amount of bread inside. I wish I could make something that came even somewhat close to the caliber of that soup! We also split a frisee lardon salad ($19) and prosciutto benedict ($21). While you can skip the frisee (mostly eaten so that we could say we had something green), the benedict on a croissant was delicious. After going to Parma, we are suckers for proscuitto de Parma... Yum. Lastly, a large french press coffee was $9.50. This lasted around half of the table and was worth the cost as well.

The wings were so tender, juicy, and flavorful and if I had been eating these at home by myself I probably would have done a much better job polishing off the wing.
-Sea Bass: very generous serving and delicious, although a smidge on the plain side. My friends ordered the sole for this course and said it was amazing so I would have chosen that instead.
-Strawberry Pavlova: Served with lavender ice cream a la mode and a tiny but fragrant piece of fresh lavender, this dessert was humongous and I could only finish the lavender ice cream before calling it quits.

My friends and I also shared the seared foie gras, foie gras parfait, and bone marrow. All extremely decadent and delicious, but I would have to choose the parfait as my favorite. It was creamy and savory, and I loved the Rose Port gelee that provided a tiny bit of tartness to the dish.

I would definitely come back and try their other dishes! They also have a daily Happy Hour (weekends included!) with some more casual fare like tartines, oysters, and tartares that could definitely be a meal.",Os7XnHJYLsHFhOsiMLQ6mA,0,0,4,KhbnWmN6FaNyikuL75kHjQ

The wait staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I started with the onion soup and it was delicious with so much melted cheese (maybe a bit big for a first course). I then had then scallops for dinner with a side of green beans (hey sue me, I like green beans) and the scallops were seared beautifully and the green beans delicious (maybe a bit to much salt on the green beans-one less shake of the salt shaker would have been okay)

For desert I had the warm cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream. I wasn't sure about the pairing of cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream but it works beautifully together. The cherry pudding was full of cherries!!  This is a very rich dessert and I could not finish it all but it sure was good",_RacHy04W4LBNcbMxPyFjg,1,0,5,TSza9nXnGVFNK1E_5GxM3w

We had the charcuterie ensemble; prosciutto was fresh and delicious but a bit think for the type (I think it was Parma or some sweet Italian). 

Onto roasted octopus salad: the texture was just off; tough and chewy.
I know it's vegas and we don't have octopuses swimming around freely on the strip... but don't put it as a special. 
It turned me off to order anything else. Especially because the rubber octopus didn't come cheap. 
But I was a masochist and ordered dessert. 
Salted caramel something with hazelnut creme. It was ok - it was basically a stale donut with some creme in between. 

Drinks were ok - weak and overtly sweet. I felt like I was drinking syrup out of a glass. 

You might think - why the 4 stars then? If you have complained all the way?

Well, Kim, our server, was really nice and friendly. She made sure we were taken care of. 
The vibe was good. The bread was fresh. The ingredients were fresh.
But it just didn't come together in execution.

I will check it out again in two weeks. We will see!",b8en6OORzlUR1vATZwUK3g,1,1,4,6odvDv9cHkOaJNgcN_LR6A

5745223,2015-11-03,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"I've been here twice for the weekend brunch and this would be one of my favorite French restaurant. Chef Michael Mina did a great job on the variety of menu it has to offer. Let's start with complimentary french bread that is toasty on the exterior and soft on the inside with house butter. 

Appetizers:
french onion soup with truffle, shortrib, poached egg, and gruyere cheese - This is goood $16 bowl of french onion which taste so home -made and delicious. The beef broth was not salty and doesnt taste like it's from the can beef broth. It's not heavily dumped with onions. This is one darn good bowl of french onion soup. 

steak tartare - it was good and fresh, but i've had better. It comes in half or full order. 

escargot - Nicely presented and the escargot is wrapped in pastry puff. 

French toast with vanilla mascarpone and almond brittle - This is a huge brick of bread! Literally, it's probably about 2.5inches thickness and 4x6inches in length/width. I was only able to eat half of the french toast. Outside is toasty, but the inside was soft and quite mushy, but tasty. It's not your typical french toast. 

Burger with aioli fries - Juicy, huge, and tasty! the fries is a must have!

Ham croissant benedict - Interesting combo and the sauce was delish!

Hunter waffle with duck confit - It 's a good plain waffle atop with duck confit. It was just okay. 

Apple tart - Not your typical apple pie or tart, but it's really good. Not soo sweet, but full of apple flavor. 

Vanilla creme brulee - Full of vanilla flavor and creamy! One of the better creme brulees!

I would definitely return to try the happy hour menu in the bar area next time i'm in town!!",9Xc7vla9JStodqfaYdJTow,3,1,5,TNp043eyi8xLS_teQKI2Bw

5767640,2016-05-25,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"I came here last weekend for a small birthday dinner, and was blown away by the experience. Tucked away inside Aria, this place is a true gem. The ambiance is intimate, service warm and friendly, and the food is delicious. Every dish is beautifully presented and reasonably priced. 

+ PRIME STEAK TARTARE: We ordered the small order to share (among 5 people), and it was more than enough, especially if you're looking to order multiple appetizers to share. The beef is delectably tender and is ground to order. 

+ SEARED FOIE GRAS LYONNAISE: The more extravagant of their two foie dishes, this is the one to get if you want the full on texture of foie gras. The foie melts in your mouth, but the star of the dish was the beluga lentils, I could eat a whole plateful of the lentils.

+ KING CRAB CREPE: I loved the simplicity and elegance of this dish. The trumpet mushrooms paired very well with the crab, and the buckwheat crepe was very delicate. Tasty dish and also very Instagrammable

+ BONE MARROW AU POIVRE: Rustic and hearty are the two best words to describe this dish. Aesthetically beautiful, the bone marrow is a golden brown and is served with country bread. Usually I'm tentative about onion jam, but I enjoyed their rendition.

+ ONION SOUP GRATINEE: We got the basic onion soup (definitely will get all the fixin's next time). All I can say is, if you love cheese, get this soup. I'm salivating just thinking about it. The soup was also very flavorful. The dish is a bit heavy, but that's expected of French onion soup.

+ OAK SMOKED DUROC PORK CHOP: I can't resist a good pork chop, especially one that's topped with even more pork (bacon lardons). Loved loved LOVED this entree. The Pork was extremely moist and well -cooked. Topped with the crispiness of the lardons and the crunchiness of the carrots, you have a great balance of flavors as well.",LTFb-ij3TDTo_pDZYmUPxQ,1,0,5,IV_UuZ1jhD6ZbBprHDoJEw

5779351,2017-02-28,1,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Overrated, simple as that. I expected more and during this visit they didn't deliver.

Atmosphere - A negative. The décor is very nice but the sound volume makes this an enjoyable place for a couple. There are large groups, bad acoustics and they pump music in the background that builds it up. The noise level is very loud. Also surprised to see a lady walk in with a bulldog on leash following her across the tile and she sits down at the table next to us so they should advertise being pet friendly. Considering the place sent me a text reminding me of their dress code I was surprised to have a dog sitting two feet from us while we tried to enjoy the dining. Maybe it was a French bulldog so it was allowed.

Service - While I went in with the mindset to not rush through dinner they took it to a new level. We had to order our first drinks from a manager who checked on us and went down from there.

Food - While the dishes were very good they didn't meet up to the hype and pricing (yes, I know it is Vegas). The pricing doesn't bother me it was that the dishes didn't rise to that level.

Overall, I take their stars down for atmosphere, definitely for service, food and the dog.",nYCuT2XuhFvxgg7906-wyg,1,1,2,yD6QcEwr7L-KgCxcVjbpyg

Got attracted to coming to this place by the billboard advertisement of the french toast facing the strip. Was unimpressed when it arrived. Way smaller and it tasted ok. A little over toasted but the sauce was good. The escargot crusted with a flakey bread was delicious. The clams was fresh. Overall a pretty decent place but dont plan to come back soon.

Dino, Tim and Erick are pros and will take good care of you and they serve full menu at the bar.  They have an everlasting Rose option for $30 which is exactly what it says you drink as much as you like.  Rose is not my first choice in wine, but it was summer time and I figured Id give it a try.  It was excellent.  And then there is the food.  All I have to say is bravo to the chefs that are clearly taking their jobs very seriously.  This review is actually referring to 2 different times I went there within 2 weeks. 
Night 1
Drink:  Aperol White Wine Spritzer (if you have been to Italy you know what this is and Dino made it perfectly), Also had a glass of burgandy and a pinot. pretty solid.
Food: Foie Gras Parfait- this was some of the best prepared Foie gras Ive ever had and Ive traveled in multiple parts of France.  
Onion soup with egg and truffle-so good, Im kind of a purest so I wouldn't order it this way every time, but wow the flavors, and broth were outstanding.  
Bread:  They have complimentary baguette and the butter tastes house made, very good.  

Night 2:
I decided to order the 4 course summer menu:
TUNA NIÇOISE TARTINE-very solid and the quail egg was a nice touch
DUCK WINGS À L'ORANGE-I love duck and these wings were cooked to perfection and the maltaise sauce served in a tangerine skin was such a nice touch
LAMB RACK ""FRITES"": Cooked perfectly and the chick pea frites were exquisite, your brain is of course expecting a french fry, which makes for quite a surprise, but in a refined way that is in every way positive.  
CHERRY CLAFOUTI- The cherrys in this are so flavorful and the pistachio cherry flavor combo is slightly reminiscent of home made spumoni ice cream.  

The only constructive criticism I can muster on this place is that one or two lower cost (maybe $10) house red wines would be nice as the red wine starts at $16 per glass, but hey it is Vegas after all.  Otherwise price points are pretty solid.  
Michael Mina delivers with this wonderful place, with stellar food that rivals many places Ive been in Paris, and spectacular service.  I could definitely become a regular at Bardot if I lived in Las Vegas.",qHAn5zBAaj3fDaxapyNPAA,1,0,5,firnARTTg0k0N4GOINVUFw

Truffle fries- 1 star.  The fries were undercooked, meaning touch and hard on the inside, and not crisp on the outside. The flavoring was off with too much salt. 

Oysters- 2 stars. Got 1 dozen oysters, thinking I'd be blown away like last time, but no, I unfortunately wasn't. 

Steak tar tar- 2 stars. This dish was OK as well. It was almost too cold in temperature, as though it had been thawed only a couple hours ago and chopped up. 

Service- 5 stars. They checked on the table multiple times and water was filled constantly.

5822489,2018-01-28,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"The overall experience here was terrible, not because the food was horrible but that the service was atrocious.  Our waiter, Oscar, thought he was in France and was giving attitude like he was a Frenchman to an American tourist.

First off, Oscar just had mad attitude taking our order.  When we didn't order alcoholic drinks nor appetizers, he got all pissy.  We had a nice dinner planned at é by José Andrés (that's a place you should def check out). that night so we wanted a light lunch.  Plus not everyone in Vegas is a degenerate that drinks and gambles at all hours...so what if we didn't order drinks.

When it's my turn to order, I see they have a french dip, which I usually really like.  I turn to him and start to order but I noted that the french dip is a chicken french dip.  I tell him to cross that off since it's not a traditional beef french dip.  He rolls his eyes impatiently.

I quickly switch my order to the French onion soup but I asked him about the option to add short rib, black truffle & a poached egg.  He says its a completely different soup.  So I ask his opinion about the soup and whether or not he likes it.  He replies ""if you need to ask its not for you"" and he just walks away.  WTF?!?!?!  Seriously?  He is in the service business and if he can't provide customer service go do something else.  Have you ever had a waiter just walk away from you in the middle of a discussion?

The food itself was average at best.  The pastry basket was bad as most of the pastries didn't look or taste fresh.  Do yourself a favor and go to Bouchon in the Venetian for pastries.  We just returned from SF were we had awesome KA's at b. patisserie and we also recently tried Dominique Ansel's new bakery in LA where he had the DKA's (his spin).   All of these places blow the pastry basket at Bardot out of the water.  I can't believe they even sell this stuff here.

A couple of us got the French onion soup, which wasn't bad but pretty average.  At least it wasn't overly salty like bad French onion soup.

My wife ordered the burger.  When it arrived it looked like a pretty average burger but she said it was awesome.  So of course I took a bite and I have to admit looks can be deceiving.  It was pretty damn good (and for $20+ it better be).  The meat, caramelized onions, and bread all went really well together.  Easily the best thing we ate there.

But I wouldn't go again for the burger (since the best of the food was average or below par at best) and the service probably one of the worst we've ever experienced (Recommendation to Oscar: if you want to be a waiter do it properly otherwise go do something else).  It's unfortunately because we were just in SF and had dinner at Michael Mina's flagship restaurant (named after himself) and it was an awesome experience from the service level to the food.  If only a small portion of that restaurant rubbed off on Bardot, the experience here would be significantly better.",W-2m0R_ZdMoqQ66XUT-kLg,1,0,1,DKq_11FFm_PcJA8URiKtlA

- Bone Marrow en Persillade $19 - served with 2 different flavor bread I say this is one AMAZING dish.. the only thing I didn't like was the thickness of the bread...maybe a little thin slice wouldn't hurt (Do not plan on getting full with just bread)
- Scallops Meuniere $46 - HUGE I mean HUGE scallops I've ever seen in my life! Perfectly cooked and full of flavor I LOVE!
- Loup de Mer au Fenouil $56 - MY FAV DISH! I enjoyed this plate very much! the buttery sauce with enough lemon...PERFECT. Boneless: easy to eat & the skin peels right off~~ DAMNNN drooool
- Bone in New York Strip , Creekstone $61 - Cooked to perfection and truffle fries.. Perfect match! My love enjoyed this VERY MUCH!
- Roasted Brussel Sprout $14 - GET IT!!!!!!

Overall this place is AMAZING and I give my man 2 thumbs up on choosing this place for our romantic dinner + being wise on making reservation beforehand :) (thats a MUST)",Z8H2jOfwmeDOuU111hcUOQ,18,21,5,4vfHLx6pRWY1ru2nP-eZTw

Whenever I have a poor experience at a restaurant that consistently gets 4 and 5 star reviews I always want to go back and give them a second chance. My second visit to Bardot was extraordinary. 

We decided to try Sunday brunch this time and it was packed full. Service however was excellent from the time we sat down until we left completely stuffed. We started with peach bellini's and that wonderful pastry basket filled with light delicious pastries that will make you think you are in Paris. 

Our table shared the king crab crepe which was presented beautifully. It was served open faced with the perfectly cooked egg in the center of the dark buckwheat crepe. When you mix the egg, crepe, king crab and mushrooms together it is a rich and elegant way to start your brunch. 

We also enjoyed the Le steak burger, hunters waffle and the french toast. The steak burger was excellent, cooked perfectly medium rare and the hunters waffle was an interesting mix of duck confit and poached eggs served on a waffle. Now...for that french toast. 

You have never seen anything like it. It is HUGE. A super thick slice of brioche with a giant scoop of vanilla marscapone and two large pieces of almond brittle. Stunning when placed on the table but even better in your mouth! The almond syrup is a perfect match. The outside of the toast is crispy and the inside soft and warm. This is a must order item. 

The food and service was worthy of all their 4 and 5 star reviews. I am really glad we came back to Bardot and it definitely won't be our last time.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,2,5,uJ3leE6VGttxyC3oNHjf6Q
5921740,2016-11-07,2,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"Blown away. This was the best brunch i've ever had.

Should you start with the bottomless sparking rosé? Yes, you should. My brother and I both got that, and I would venture to guess, that between the two of us, we went through at least two bottles and change. The waitress just kept coming over and topping us off; I don't think we actually ever had completely empty glasses.

Carbs? Yep. If you're jumping on the bottomless train, you best supplement with breads of many varieties. We got the basket of bread/pastries, a basket of sourdough, as well as ""the world's best butter"" - I think between this carb-festival and the rosé, I could have stopped right there.

But did we? Of course not. We also HAD to start with the Nutella cinnamon bun to get that initial fat explosion we needed to really get our metabolisms going. We divided that up between all of us, because only a crazy person (or someone with an iron stomach) could house that whole thing themself.

From there, you can't really go wrong with what you order. Our table had some salmon, some french toast, and steak and eggs floating around, and they were all fantastic. I had the steak and eggs, which was grass fed NY beef (local for me, less so for LV) nice and rare, with perfectly over easy eggs and fat sourdough to soak it all up.

This easily outdoes any NYC/NJ brunch i've ever had - where else can you get bottomless sparking French rosé for $25?

Again, not the cheapest meal you'll eat, but most certainly worth every penny. Next time I am in Vegas, Aria or not, I will be back.",p7OZx3RIeJPxSM4hP6wqEA,12,6,5,D6eHgjSOAcU1uLhqYGI9Jw

5932680,2016-09-05,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,Omg this place is my favorite in Vegas and I've been to many high end French restaurants here in town. Great Forbes 5 star service as expected at the Aria. The food is great. Everything that we ordered was like a piece of art. The mixture of different flavors and textures in the buckwheat crepe was mindblowing. Foie gras brulee = food orgasm. Best advice - go there very hungry.,cPd18otnuwpnLP3fzIKK8g,0,1,5,Hl4ihSoJjlwzG5MiCZLSsw

Aloof, polite service and a trendy French atmosphere. My partner got the loaded French onion soup that had short rib and an egg in it. I chose the smoked salmon plate which was beautifully presented and delicious. Would have been great for sharing. I'd consider coming back and would recommend to pink wine drinkers as they have an unlimited Rose option with brunch.",WwXBQFLYbI4njuu4L4AdMg,0,0,4,tgtwdfQv2pOtIu52hoHOgg

I had escargots Bardot, seared foie gras, octopus a la basquaise for appetizer. 
Escargot is wrapped in pastry with amazing sauce. I LOVE the seared foie gras but I don't like the camargue rice. The octopus is very tasty & cooked perfectly but eating the beans with it seemed to ruined the taste.
I had the scallops & king crab crepe for my entree and both are DELICIOUS!!!",8wnZjmbDHKLFH0zwl2YhcA,0,0,5,zC8SL4QqQFGWpCOEiTDTaw

The food was okay but not knock your socks off great. We love the pork chop because it was juicy and was cooked to perfection. However, the macaroni and cheese is sub par. It was missing the cheese part! For me, the best part was the dessert - a big chocolate macaron.",WBR6c7NhtCMtmpBBEHE7kg,0,0,3,8zDzsjx9JumdOeMiII9FbA

Would absolutely go back when in Vegas again. Foie gras parfait was amazing, olive tapenade with fresh breads the same. Escargot was a let down, but only because I thought I was getting escargot with puff pastry and a garlic butter sauce for dipping. Instead, the escargot was wrapped in puff and had a garlic pesto sauce on top. Still really good, just not what I wanted.",OZvRL1dr5XLKm1P3mFKzZQ,0,0,5,Tf4oXLcymVsIDqg0Dw9frw

5993769,2018-02-18,0,rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,"When we are in the mood to splurge this is our go to spot! Our two favorite things on the menu are the heritage chicken and the diver scallops, which are both very tasty and cooked to perfection. The service is always great no matter how busy they are, which is to be expected at such a nice place. 

My only issue is it can get pretty loud, as they do have a tv at the bar. I'd suggest requesting one of the more secluded areas or at least a table where the television is not in view. To me, it's just not fitting to pay $200 for a meal (for 2) while watching a sporting event on the tele. It just doesn't go, at least not for me. 

Aside from that, everything is ALWAYS amazing which is why we return, but more importantly venture to the strip. If you're a Vegas local, you'll understand that statement.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,0,1,4,_OE2JcpyvzmDtTG13HOY1w
