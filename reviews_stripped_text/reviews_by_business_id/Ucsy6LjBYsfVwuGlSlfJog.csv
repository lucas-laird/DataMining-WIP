1423024,2018-05-15,1,Ucsy6LjBYsfVwuGlSlfJog,"I so wanted to like this place more. The diner feel is cool and the shakes are great. We came by twice in one day. Once for dinner and once after some gambling and a show, for a late night snack and shake. 

During dinner, we ordered unsweetened tea and it came to us sweetened. Our waitress was very gracious and took it back only to say that they notified her in back that was the unsweetened. No offer from ""the back"" to get us unsweetened iced tea and we had lemonade as a substitute. We ordered the frisco burger, chili deluxe (with onions and cheese), cole slaw,and onion rings. Our chili arrived without onions and cheese and we waited about 15 minutes for new chili. The onion rings were about 30 seconds undercooked but good enough. The burger was mediocre. The cole slaw was chunky, with onion and vinegar, and was quite yummy.

For our late night snack, we ordered a small chili cheese fries with onions and a chocolate cookie dough milkshake. We waited about 25 minutes for our food and, again, our order was wrong, as our chili cheese fries arrived without onions. 

The wait staff were pleasant but the missteps were too many. To pay, we waited in a long line with one checkout person taking both payment and to-go orders and pickups. Overall, I will be back as several items were quite yummy. I just hope they work the kinks out and correct easy mistakes.",A1692oPeLY4M1G4ZgTbiJg,0,0,3,9O84tjoUd13JMne4CNMGcw

There was only a few tables seated so there was no excuse!  The food was bad came out room temperature and took too long for fast food.  They got out sides wrong they were out of iced tea the waitress did not know what seltzer/club soda was or if I could order that. I was not expecting much at all especially with the food but at least perk up and make the service decent so people might have a reason to come back.

It took probably 15 minuets to get seated even though half the restaurant was empty.  Ordered a cheeseburger & fries & a shake.  My girlfriend ordered the Frisch melt & fries.  When the order came we were very disappointed to find out that they were not the shoestring fries that you normally get at a Steak 'n Shake.  We also asked that the fries be cooked crispy/well done.  They were not crispy!  The Frisco melt is supposed to come with a toasted sourdough bun.  That bread was barely toasted.  We were told the manager was going to come and talk to us, but they never did.

I wanted to show my girlfriend that Steak 'n Shake is better than In & Out but this Steak 'n Shake was the worst fast food establishment I have ever been to.

The restaurant is just off the casino. Smoke everywhere. Open 24 hours, I arrived around 11:30 pm. The place was messy, very messy. From no one at the host stand where the sign stated wait for seating, to items on the floor, to tables that had not been bussed. Finally got acknowledged and seated. Server breezily came by and said she would be with us in just a moment. The restaurant was not busy.That moment turned into 6 minutes. We left. Also the menu was quite different from the South Point restaurant. I was told by the counter server that ""we are franchised so there are some liberties"".

Service is fast, efficient and friendly. Even offered us 'to go' cups when server noticed we could not finish the humongous shakes. 
Food is very good, what's expected of Steak 'n Shake. 
The Staff  are still ironing some bumps they encounter which is expected as it's still their soft opening. Cashier couldn't take gift cards  yet but stated they will in the future.
