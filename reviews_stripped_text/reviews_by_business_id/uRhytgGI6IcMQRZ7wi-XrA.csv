Hesitantly, I paid the near $70 for this buffet and the expectation of an empty buffet held up. I had just about a little bit of everything to make sure I got my monies worth, and most of the food was just ""eh."" Most of the meats were hard and chewy, the crab legs weren't very warm, most of the chickens were more bone than meat... you get the idea. 

I knew I should've ponied up and gone down to the strip and paid a little more for a better buffet there. But alas, my gut held true and I was right. This particular buffet is not worth the Vegas money.",wFF6t0wvtUkBDzxP3f6fKw,1,0,2,DgmYbrxRZsD5MTgiLMd7AA
1398211,2018-06-03,0,uRhytgGI6IcMQRZ7wi-XrA,"Las Vegas buffets are one of those things you try to do when you're having those beastly cravings and you just want to let loose. The buffet at the Rio once held the crown for being one of those ""gotta go to"" buffets. However, sadly they are from it now.

Although this buffet is huge and offers a wide variety of foods, some of the dishes were mediocre at best. From the melted butter tasting watered down, to some of the seafood lacking freshness, it is evident they seem to be cutting corners now. I was highly disappointed especially for the 30 something plus dollars I spent.",bJjM2yF9dsP6Qte_x6KPnQ,4,1,2,QdZ9NrrKIaRZgXAdIy9gWA

It is decently priced and the food is pretty great, especially that dessert station. I picked up more desserts to try than I could eat, but I have no ragretz. A good amount of it was delicious. Just be careful if you have any allergies. Not everything is labelled properly, some stuff might not be labelled at all, so be sure to ask if it isn't labelled.

But my god, did they make a huge mistake removing the seafood. Absolutely not worth coming here anymore. It went from a 4 star buffet to a 2 star buffet, such a disappointment.

2177005,2018-06-01,1,uRhytgGI6IcMQRZ7wi-XrA,"I really don't care too much about Rio Casino & Resort but this buffet sure has a lot to show for. Me and the family came here during our vacation to Vegas and it is a very good buffet with many choices. It's not cheap but it's definitely worth the price. The service is great and the ambience is casual. This buffet has a wide variety of desserts which is awesome. The ice cream is very soft and creamy. My favorite dish was the Carne Con Chile in the Mexican food section. The seating is comfortable and spacious to the point where I had my kid's stroller next to the table and there was plenty of walk space left.

The sirloin at the meat carving station was rare and juicy so that was awesome. As far as affordable buffets in Las Vegas go, this buffet has to be at the top of the list. Great place to go eat and I recommend you stop by while in town.",CLPFKBpyuhi38cb_O21PnQ,2,1,5,I1ye2bwy1ekdO6I1s2WlKQ

Robert, our server was absolutely fantastic! So friendly and authentic he deserves 5 stars!  An easy conversationalist, he was also great at making guests feel comfortable and anticipating their needs. He really took our brunch to the next level.

Eggs Benedict was freshly made and the bacon and pork sausage were good. Stay away from the turkey sausage, it was really dry.  More variety needed in the dim sum area but what was there was good. Sushi was all rolls probably to keep costs down. 

The dessert area was beautifully stocked with a huge selection of creative and colorful sweets. Unfortunately I always forget to leave room to take advantage of all the treats and can barely finish some vanilla gelato and a macaroon.",EsPErKV3vyeXabGT4kpHIQ,7,4,5,hH7XRWCfi9ihN6F_URReFQ

4059262,2018-06-10,0,uRhytgGI6IcMQRZ7wi-XrA,"For the price, this buffet is a good move if you have a really large group thats on a budget but wants the whole vegas buffet experience. Id give it one step above the default buffet at most hotels. It doesnt touch the top knotch ones like caesers or cosmo, etc. But again, that comes with the price tag with it. This buffet has alot to choose from and quality isnt half bad. I mean, dont expect super unquie blends or beautiful displays, or preshelled shrimps...because thats where the cost savings comes from. Just like all buffets now there is sections for the different type of foods here. Why this is one step up from default is they actually have some make to order items and attempts some small touches to their different food. I had my french toast made with fresh berries and in another station ramen. My friend went nuts at the unlimited bar, that costs extra. The kids went nuts on the desserts and pasta options. And ofc the hubbies got the slabs of prime rib. And they actually cut portions that fill the entire plate. We went for brunch so we had free memosas with the meal so again those small touches helped.

Overall, again if you are wanting a little better than the default and dont mind venturing off the strip and dont want to drop $$$, this is not a bad option.",fFfoJQTA7WJgUHVTa2Wsaw,1,0,3,9Oxs9Msz9hgjuMKI_7Nmjg

Went there last Friday with my players card, NV drivers license, and local discount coupon from Caesar's website, and they told me it wasn't valid until after 8 pm. That isn't stated anywhere on their website nor is that stated on their coupon from their website, that clearly states it's valid until 12/31/2018. I told them we drove 40 min in traffic to get there for my bday, which I pointed to on my ID, they didn't give a crap.

Then the manager made up some BS saying it was a regulatory requirement. Seriously? Nearly 10 years of the local discount being applied no problem, and suddenly the casino regulators say discounts can only be applied between 8-9 pm? I'm pretty sure false advertising is a regulatory problem.

If that's really the case, stop with the false advertising and update your website and coupons you're handing out. They were nice enough to ignore a Facebook post on their page for a week despite responding to others after my inquiry was posted.",HAKM1w86vbPHmOgNUdQWiQ,1,0,1,tKR74kEjQwHvgsB_uuUsiA
