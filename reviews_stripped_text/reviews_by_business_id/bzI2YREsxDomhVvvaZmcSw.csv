He was a very nice man probably in his late 40s. He explained menu options to us and we decided on the truffle fries and margarita pizza. The pizza had an amazing white garlic sauce and was full of flavor as were the fries. We both finished our meal comfortably full. Next thing we know our server is bringing over a monster of a nice cream Sunday. When we told him we hadn't ordered dessert he told us this was compliments of Sammy for our first visit. It was called the sloppy sundae. Oh my goodness it was amazing and we barely put a dent in it. The room was very comfortable and clean as well.

Boy were we glad we did.  I had the Ono tacos with slaws which was very good.
Husband had the Brie & truffle oil pizza (with sautéed mushrooms).  Very popular with everyone and not at all heavy as you might think.  The crust was awesome!
The kids' meals were good also.  Our girl actually finished her pepperoni pizza!  Which is a feat in itself!

It's about the size of a small at most pizza chains.  They have some pretty interesting flavors for their pizzas which come in an original dough and flat bread style.  They also sell other things like pasta and salads but we were focused on the pizza.

My daughter ordered the mini cheeseburgers and fries.  The fries are AMAZING!  They use Old Bay spice and it's outstanding.  I ordered the Pesto pizza and added my wife had the goat cheese one.  Both of us loved our pizzas!  The waiter answered all our questions thoroughly and was very helpful.  He gets 5 stars for sure!

The new menu charges pretty much $3.00 for the majority of happy hour menu food items resulting in a significantly reduced portion compared to the previous happy hour menu. You essentially get two pieces of food with each order (ie- 2 meatballs, 2 duck Tacos, etc.) By the time you order enough food to fill you up, your bill is far more expensive than the previous happy hour menu was. The food and service are still very good but the portions and pricing are not.

445435,2012-04-05,1,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Although this place can be a little pricey, I have a somewhat understanding why. I read over the menu and it's not like they use mediocre ingredients. The menu is chockful of high grade cheeses and pizza toppings. Even the non-pizza stuff sounded wonderful.
Tonight I opted for my favorite Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and the wood fired Sun Dried Tomato pizza with goat cheese, pine nuts and basil.
The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine is wonderful! The spinach pasta is delicious and the chicken is tender. It's tossed with red onions and peppers which adds a nice touch to the yummy dish. The menu shows jalapeno but the dish is not spicy at all (I can't complain since I'm no spice fan). Even though it was take out, I still got a good amount of food.
The Sun Dried Tomato pizza was delicious as well. Between the 2 dishes I preferred the pasta, but the pizza was good too. The sun dried tomatoes gave each bite a tangy twist while the goat cheese gave it a creamy touch. My only gripe was that the pizza was kinda small and it was only offered in one size. So if you're looking for giant pizza slices, this definitely isn't the place for you.
Overall my taste buds enjoyed the food. As for the service, although I stood at the door waiting for service for 3 awkward minutes, when I finally was told to place my order at the bar, the host was super friendly. He even offered me a beverage while I was waiting. I'm definitely coming back to this place, to dine in and/or take out.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,1,1,4,11T_gvPRCDHswtG1mIf0Hw

Which is great as this shows how service is when they're jumping.  Husband had a pizza and liked it. Friends had pizza & salad and like them too.  I, on the other hand had the shrimp salad as an entrée. I was told it was large and saw a few being served.  Sadly, there were only 5 (yes, 5) very, very small shrimp in a virtual jungle of greens.  I was hoping as the salad was an entrée size, the protein would be substantial.  Wrong. I asked the server for a glass of ice and waited about 10 minutes when our meals were served to ask the manager serving if I could get a glass of ice.    Our group was thinking of ordering a kind of sundae to share, but it's served in a large wine glass and wouldn't be easy to share, I mentioned that it would be nice if we could get it in a bowl, but the waitress told us that's the way it was served.  period.  just didn't get it and did not offer to serve any other way. Also after using the facilities, I had to go and tell a manager that the ladies room was in need a check.

Don't get me wrong, I love a place that is environment friendly and staffs are enjoying themselves but I will say it's always nice to walk into a place and everyone is focuses on the customers.

One thing I definitely liked was how clean the staffs were. There was a gentleman there going around and refilling customers glass of water. He was sweating. He went back to the counter and grabbed a piece of paper and whipped his forehead and threw away the paper. Never did he wipe the sweat off with his hand, back of his hand or even his fingers (very commonly done at other places and it drives me nuts!) way to go guy' lol

993059,2012-01-25,0,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"I've been to this Sammy's location a few times now, and every time it's the same mediocre experience.  It takes 10 minutes just to choose something from the monstrous menu, and by the end of the experience, only my hunger is satisfied. I don't know about you, but I usually go to a restaurant for more than just filling my gut.  Let me explain.

The Sammy's menu doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Yes, their main draw is pizza, and they dedicate an entire page to this noble cause.  But then you flip the page, and they have a bunch of tapas dishes.  Okay... I don't get it, but I'll go along.  Then you flip the next page, and there's full-on entree dishes with no clear theme.  I know that variety is good, but I also expect some cohesion among your menu items.  For me, it just makes the decision process difficult.  Nothing stands out among the random dishes.

As for the execution of the food, I've never had a memorable experience here.  I was hungry when I came in, and now I'm not.  Hunger has been quelled, and that's about it.  I've tried the flatbread pizza (bbq chicken, maybe?) and oak roasted chicken with asparagus.  I've tried something else, but I don't remember (and I usually remember what I eat).

My husband got a rye drink that was all whiskey and nothing else, which is better than just getting juice.  The pizza was sub par.  We got the Sicilian.  I thought Sicilian was thick pizza, this was not.  And all of the ingredients were shoved into the middle b/c they were closing in 30 min and just tried to hurry it up apparently.  We ordered our drinks w/ our meal and they came out when we were over halfway done w/ our meal.  They have a nice patio with a good view which we enjoyed.

That quinoa salad (vegan). If you order that be prepared to share or be really hungry, it's huge!

We love the hummus app (vegan) and I always ask for lettuce cups because I don't like bread/pita. Hubby eats the pita I dip with lettuce.

They do a gluten free pizza with cheeze (vegan) but be aware that their regular dough has dairy/egg in it.
It's ok but nothing to blow your socks off. I really think they probably use an Udi's pre made frozen crust for that gluten free base.

The service is always spot on at this location. They don't bug you (ugh I hate it when servers rush or want to ""chat"") and they keep water and iced tea filled!

The pizza was great! Crispy crust and gooey cheese. It's topped with basil and tastes very fresh.
My shrimp angel hair was a little disappointing. It's served with sautéed shrimp, mushrooms, zucchini, carrots and topped with parsley. The sautéed items were delicious and had lots of flavor. The sauce however was very bland and tasted like water to me. Very disappointed by that.
The service is great and everything else tasted great. Maybe their sauce station was just having an off day. Cooks please taste your food before it leaves your station!",CXTd4t5vyP8ez6sUS4BirQ,0,0,3,zs5mG4l0c0XacDXaVs5igQ

And they didn't had it to us.  They put it in the middle for us to grab.  We had to request a refill on the drinks.  We had waited a long time to order our meals, and it wasn't even busy yet.
We had to ask for more napkins,  still didn't get any.
Never ask us if we needed paramesian cheese on our pizzas.  We had to request for it.  NOW the FOOD.   Soup was watery (corn chowder).  The pizza was very plain and not much of a taste.  Our group ordered one of each piazza.  All didn't have much taste to it.

The reason I'm writing this review is that we were charged and extra $2 per pizza because we wanted whole wheat crust. Why should we be charged more money to get a healthier option? I'm quite positive that the process to make the dough whole wheat doesn't involve much. It should be an OPTION. For example, if you go to Panda Express and ask for brown rice instead of white, they give it to you FOR NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Learn from this, Sammy's.

1. Tables were filthy. Ours was sticky and gross. We had to wipe it down with a baby wipe before we even felt comfortable eating off of it. 
2. The ""wood fired pizza"" didn't seem so wood fired to me. I've never had a wood fired pizza like it. Maybe it was frozen and then wood fired. I don't know. There was absolutely no char and it was soggy on the bottom. Both of which are not typical for a real wood fired pizza. 
3. Boyfriends pesto wrap didn't have any pesto in it. Hmmmm. 
4. EXPENSIVE!! $3.00 for iced tea?! Come on! We paid $45 for pizza, a pesto (sans pesto) wrap and two iced teas. Wtf?! 
5. Server had maybe 3 tables (seriously, the place was empty) and we saw him maybe 3 times.

3) truffle fries- super super crispy topped with cilantro and Parmesan and served with a large dollop of ketchup (didn't like it because I'm used to McDonald's fries- crispy outside and mushy inside). The truffle taste wasn't really there and mostly it smelt like truffle oil. Don't get if u like true truffle fries. But my grandma and hubby loved it, so to each their own. Smelt more like truffle than taste like. Didn't really taste like it at all.

2641049,2013-04-02,1,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Happy Easter! Bottomless mimosas!

Belated birthday ""happiest hour""

Home of the ""happiest hour"" from 3-6pm every day! This includes half priced all tapas (appetizers) & $2 off beer and wine. Their service never lets me down. I always let my server know of my gluten allergy and they ensure proper food handling. They offer enough tapas to please just about everyone; from garlic cheesy bread to crispy tofu, and duck tacos. There are about half a dozen options that are gluten free (or can be modified to be gf) and also vegan tapas. Pizza crusts range from gluten-free, whole wheat, thin artisan, or traditional. The salads are ginormous!! And again, many salads (with dressing) is gf. Water, bread and butter are served upon request. They bring water out in a recycled glass water bottle with a rubberized pop top. Looks really classy and they take the time fill those bottles with their filtered water, just goes to show how much they care about presentation and service.

Now for my order:

~Baba Ghanoush- AMAZING! Well, that is if you're a garlic fan. For those of you who are not used to that heavy pungent flavor, start with a small scoop! It is very good and you can (literally) taste the antioxidants working! I get this gf so they serve it with bibb lettuce or gf bread (which is the gf pizza crust).

~Edamame- served warm with toasted sesame seeds. That is what it is. This tapa costs $6, so I would recommend getting during HH when it's half off.

~Hummus- also delicious and garlicky but not nearly as strong as the baba ghanoush. Again, gf style served with bibb lettuce or gf bread. Regular way is with flat bread.

~Oak Roasted Asparagus- Another brilliant tapa! They serve with shaved romano cheese, evoo, balsamic vinegar & prosciutto, but I leave that off. Roasted asparagus and balsamic is bomb! And the spears were nice and fat, very ""meaty"".

~Mini duck tacos- I was told was awesome. The plate had looked like he licked it clean within 10 minutes of receiving the dish! Six mini hard tacos are served with cabbage, tomato, feta, and a cilantro sauce with fresh cilantro.

~Red Quinoa salad- Another fabulous dish! Served as a huge mound that could be eaten as a meal on its own with leftovers to take home, that;s how big it is. The red quinoa is mixed with wild arugula, golden beets, tomatoes, avocado, red onion, parsley, mint, scallions, chopped almonds, and dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. It was so fresh and clean tasting, just a breath of fresh air. Very good and it was hard for me to stop eating. There was a serving leftover that I took home and ate for lunch the next day and it held up just fine. 

~Garlic Shrimp Pizza- First of all, I have not tried a pizza at Sammy's that I disliked. This pizza was served with garlic sauce rather than a tomato based one, sauteed mushrooms, bell peppers & red onion and of course I ordered mine on a gluten free crust. My only gripe would be that the shrimp were scant and the ingredients were strewn about the pizza. 

~Messy Sundae- This is their trademark dessert and literally is messy. They dip a large wine glass into hot fudge, filled half with vanilla ice cream and half with whipped cream. Also topped with caramel sauce and chopped walnuts and of course a maraschino cherry to complete the sundae look. It tasted as good as it looked! HELLO! Worth the extra calories, but it's big so can be shared between 2-4 people. Also, gluten free.

Their service is nothing but exceptional and the wait staff are helpful and genuine. I recommend going during HH so you get some sort of deal. If you sign up for their pizza club, they email you a certificate for a few pizza on your next visit. They also have weekly specials where there is something different on each day. For example, on Sunday's they ""Supper Sunday's"" where you get a tapa, a salad, and a pizza for $25, that's a great deal!!! I believe that special is good all day and not just for supper.",BbnxMn4ysHRqvXULXehwyg,3,3,5,yMyC-yHP981LoMMDXPU5RQ

Went in today for lunch. Ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad and tea. 

The server brought us our drinks but not all together. With very little ice, it was the only tea I drank, never asked about a refill. 

We had to ask for a bread basket, which the flat bread was burnt. I'm surprised it was served to us, I know the guy dishing it out could tell, not sure why he still put it on the plate. 

My salad came - appeared nice. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and there was no spice. The dressing is like a sour viniagrette, no kick there or really that much flavor.. then after digging into the salad, notice a lot of the lettuce had better days earlier that week. 

Finally saw the server again, we asked for the bill.

2721112,2017-07-22,4,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Firstly, I have had many pleasant experiences at this Sammy's Woodfired Pizza location. As a college student, I frequent Sammy's happy hour where tapas are half off. My boyfriend, myself, and my mother have spent many birthdays at Sammy's and are members of the Sammy's Pizza ""vip club"", which is just a program a customer can sign up for to receive special offers on purchases. 

However, today (July 22, 2017 at 4:01 p.m.) I placed an order for two mini duck taco tapas to go. Happy hour is from 4-6 as listed on Sammy's website. Which means half off of each tapas order. I have ordered to go orders during this specific happy hour before and had zero issues with receiving the happy hour discount. Even the Sammy's website DOES NOT indicate DINE IN customers ONLY receive happy hour on tapas or ""shareables"". I will attach a screenshot of this below. 

Nonetheless, this time was trifling in terms of customer service and sticking to the company policy as listed on the website. I was told I could NOT receive the tapas discount on to go orders since that is their policy. I insisted that I had been to this Sammy's pizza location many, many, times and have received the happy hour price. A rude red head woman, (who would not give me her name), insinuated that I was lying and that ""no one here has ever done that"". I was shocked! I would not lie about something like this because, I enjoy eating Sammy's Woodfired food, especially the delicious duck tacos. 

Then I told the red headed woman, that ""it was fine and that I no longer wanted the tacos"". More specifically, I stated that I will ""just call corporate to address my concerns with customer service"". She rolled her eyes and said something under her breath. That really infuriated me, to which I said, ""If you have something to say, say it to my face"". She went on to say, ""your the one who walked in here all apprehensive"". Umm, EXCUSE ME, I walked in HAPPY to HAPPY hour to purchase my duck tacos; until I was not given the USUAL happy hour discount. 

One woman, named Skylar went to the defense of the red headed woman (that again would not give me her name). Again, Skylar insisted that ""they"", NEVER did half off to go happy hour shareables. She asked who had given me the happy hour price before. I explained to her, ""I have come in SO many times for these duck tacos that I cannot remember every single server who gave me the valid happy hour price"". Skylar has seen me come in and rang up my happy hour order before and now wants to act oblivious (management can check the cameras for the past few months and see that I have come in and purchased food both dine in and carry out at happy hour). What a nice way to treat a repeat, paying, customer. 

Then, the manager, Anthony, came out and said ""well maybe they did you a FAVOR, but this is our policy NOW"". What do you mean by NOW? I told him, I was told by Skylar that their policy was ""always no discount on to go orders"". So which is it?! Was I, a paying customer done ""a favor"", or has the policy ALWAYS been the same? He changed his response to ""oh its not new, its always been the same"". So disgustingly unprofessional, to claim I was done ""favors"" in the past. Sammy's Woodfired Pizza desperately needs to educate their employees on customer service. 

After being throughly embarrassed and accused of being a liar, I told the staff to ""enjoy their duck tacos"", and I walked out. So much for happy hour. 

I have contacted corporate and await a response.",9qBfSIplRqBRaH0c8DVV4Q,1,1,1,Er3_RMDdeOjMYbcta6RuHg

This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.

The menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  ""Tapas"" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.

No comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.

For those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci ""you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin"" hahaha.

We only go to Sammy's when we know Casey is working the floor. He is the best server that we have had at any restaurant that we go to. He knows what we want to drink and how we like them even without saying anything. He always makes sure that everything is up to our standards.

It wasn't terrible but I definitely expected more for the price. It reminded me of the little plates you would find at an upscale restaurant.

We then ordered a Hawaiian pizza and were really disappointed as well. It wasn't terrible but it was not what we were expecting for a pizza joint. It came with circular slabs of ham cut in half and sporadically placed on the pizza. The pineapples were whole slices placed on the pizza totally covering the cheese that was thinly placed on it.

We went for dinner. There were three of us. We started with a chopped chicken salad, which we modified slightly. Added pepperoni and put the dressing on the side. You have the option for kalamata olives with this salad or sundried tomatoes. We chose the olives because there is already fresh tomato in it. It was very good. The chicken in it is charred on the grill fresh to order. So be prepared everyone, the chicken on their salads is......wait.....warm! It doesn't bother me at all but I know some people might not like that. We shared the salad and it was great and piled high! Plenty for three people. 

We shared two pizzas. One NY Style and one Hawaiian. The NY Style has sauteed mushrooms on it, finely ground beef, sausage, and pepperoni. But, they don't overwhelm their pizza with meat. The Hawaiian was excellent too. Mainly because they thin slice the pineapple. It's such a small detail but it was nice to not have chunks of pineapple weighing down the pizza.

When we want to eat out and can't decide where to go we usually end up coming here since it has decent food, a diverse menu and is kid-friendly. Here's a rundown of some of the things I've tried:

- Mini duck tacos: good
- Hummus: good, but nothing special
- Thin crust pizzas: I love the Dorthea Sundried tomato pizza, it's probably one of my favorite items; Brie cheese pizza is also very good. Pass on the kobe beef pizza... blah
- Woodfired pizzas: most are solid choices, but not spectacular. The ones I would get again are the Hawaiian, the Thai chicken, garlic chicken, BBQ chicken, or goat cheese.
- Fettuccine alfredo: ehh... pass
- kobe beef burger: not worth it, if you want a burger go someplace else
- grilled shrimp salad: tastes great, the larger order is big enough for 2 people
- risotto: no longer on the menu, which is a good thing because I didn't like it

So, if you come here get a pizza or a salad. Those are your best bets. If you have kids they'll probably find something on the menu that they'll like. The service is usually good, although during peak dining hours expect a wait to get your food.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,4,3,4btCmK_ErTqiTGRbRgz34A

Since I typically wouldn't order pizza, I decided to order a salad & got the Thai Spicy Grilled Chicken Salad ($10.50). It was honestly better than I thought! It could've used more dressing, but that's only because I love my salads drenched in dressing. It surprisingly had sufficient amount of peanuts!

Their prices are somewhat typical for dine-in pizza places, and their service was just okay. It's obviously busy during the lunch hour, so the restaurant was 3/4 full.

I went in thinking I was gonna get a pizza, but I was wrong. Upon sitting down, I was hit with an extensive menu that overwhelmed me in the best way possible: burgers, tacos, pasta, lettuce wraps, they had pizza too but it seems to only account for like 15% of the menu.

My wife got a pepperoni pizza and it was pretty decent, but the real surprise was how good the burgers are. I dropped my initial plans of having pizza and went with the Kobe beef sliders. Such a good choice! The beef is high quality, well seasoned and cooked, soft bun, aged cheddar, fresh veggies with a flavorful chipotle aoli.

I should have stuck with the pizza or salad--what I had initially wanted until I saw a Tequila-Lime Chicken Fettucine. Always looking for inventive dishes, I made up my mind quickly and ordered that. When it arrived it had zero flavor and was sitting in a puddle of oil--usually meaning the sauce had separated because it was not fresh. I cannot stress enough how much this tasted like nothing: not tequila, not lime, not really even the oil it was bathing in. I was really disappointed.

My aunt ordered a Greek salad--slightly more flavorful, but really lacking the true ""Greek-ness"" I would like in a salad. The winner of the afternoon, and what I should have ordered, was the pizza that my cousin ordered. Just a plain cheese and pretty flavorful, though what is going on with the crust? I dunno, it seemed, again, lacking in flavor. 

Having never been to Sammy's and not really even knowing it existed until today, I am really not impressed. I found it truly gross and disappointing. I liked the decor--it was clean and didn't seem like it was in a strip mall. But I will not be back to this or any Sammy's.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,0,0,2,RJGkmF0p86HP98e13jJdnQ

The service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.

Since it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.

They were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.

In any case, the lunch was enjoyable.

3838218,2018-02-07,1,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Came here on a Tuesday around 11:30am. 

Service: I was here for a work meeting. I was greeted right away and seated at one of the booths along the window. When my guest arrived they sat next to me and then we were promptly greeted again. Service was great at first and then quickly dwindled as our time there progressed. At one point we were completely ignored even trying to get their attention. My guest had his glass only 1/4 of the way down and was offered a refill on his soda. I was 1/4 of my glass left (ice included) and I never got a refill on my soda. I even pushed my glass out so it was clearly visible and nothing..... 

Food: 

Appetiser- Chicken Lettuce Cups.  This was a delicious combination of chicken, water chestnuts, scallions, hoisin sauce and sesame seeds. They provided a generous ration of chicken to accompany the butter lettuce. 

Meal- I ordered the Oak Roasted Salmon Filet with the Asian salad, edamame, cucumber & ponzu sauce. I LOVE all of these ingredients. BUT... I did NOT love this dish. There was just something about it lacking flavor and depth. I so badly wanted to like my food but I didn't. I could not even finish it and had to stop eating, push it to the side to and just continued to talk during my meeting.

Service(cont.): After several attempts to get ANY waitresses attention, they finally came by and offered a box. I took one for the lettuce wraps. When she came back with the boxes she also had the check. I had to ask for our dessert. I mean aren't they supposed to be watching you get close to finishing and then ask if you want dessert? There was no line to eat so it could not be that they were rushing to get people in and out. Not sure if that is just how they do it. 

For dessert, I ordered the flourless chocolate cake. The cake tasted great. The banana sauce topped with walnuts might as well have just been taken from a baby food jar (-walnuts). If you like banana baby food then you will LOVE it. (I know adult people that do so I'm not knocking it)

Overall I wish I ordered a pizza and maybe my experience would have been better. Sadly, I doubt I'll ever come back which is unfortunate since this is an area I frequent for work meetings. I left a 15% tip even though service and food was less than desirable only because I know many people in the food industry.",GNfwNpQ13tknD_cGspVgjQ,1,1,2,jmV930aN5HnuqiHd1yfAOQ

A friend ordered the Oak Roasted Chicken ($16.50) I recommended and loved it as well.  She only wished she had more pesto sauce because it was so good.

Our food was great, but the wait time for service knocked this down one star.

One thing I noticed about my food choices lately is that I tend to eat something from a restaurant that they do not specialize in.  I recently gone to seafood restaurants and got a steak.  Cheeseburger joints and got chicken.  Even a Mexican restaurant and got a hamburger.  And now a pizza place and ended up getting a salmon fillet with their lobster bisque.  

I have to say, not too many places can mess up salmon.  This place was no different.  The salmon was made just right, grilled, tasty, and flaky.  The waitress was extra helpful too.  I originally requested for 2 fillets because one is never enough for me.  She told me to just order one and she'll find the largest piece for me.  I guess she knew that I needed at least 8 oz to be satisfied.  I got about 8 oz like she promised.  12 oz would have been perfect though. But beggars can't be choosers.  

My group was a bit rowdy for lunch.  I'm glad that there wasn't too many kids around because we went overboard a couple of time.  Our waitress was very helpful and what I liked the most, she never interrupted our conversation.  When it came to the bill, each of us handed separate cards.  Without even asking, the waitress split the bills for us.  I never got our waitress's name, but she was great.  It's not easily dealing with a rowdy group like us.

This location out in the boonies (according to me and where I am located) is tucked away at the far end of a shopping center. My GPS kept telling me we had made it, when in reality, we were still in front of Lowe's. 

The restaurant itself is on the small side, and when it fills up, gets a bit loud. Not to say you can't hear your dining companions, but loud none the less. I selected this location for a meeting with a client and I am happy to say it delivered with food, service, and ambiance.

For starters we all shared the crab and shrimp dip, which came out piping and steaming hot. Creamy and not overly-salted (a fault I find often with crab/shrimp dip) this dip paired well with a plentiful amount of delicately seasoned pita bread slices. Thank you Sammy's for bringing out plenty of pita bread for three girls to share. We actually did not end up finishing the pita bread and I was able to take it home and pair with my hummus later in the evening.

For my entrée I selected the grilled Hawaiian ONO tacos that come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas and also your choice of a side, of which I chose French fries. The fries were ""eh"" nothing special, but the tacos were nice LARGE portions with plenty of big, flaky white fish. The tomato-avocado salsa was over flowing out of my tacos and all was rounded out with a bit of heat from the creamy Chipotle sauce.

Drinks were consistently refilled, plates were removed quickly, and the bill arrived in a timely manner. If I were to host my client again in this area, I would certainly pick Sammy's to be the place to do it.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,5,vyvvwn6vPuC2dYkY3ZSdPA

They were light with the dressing... I could hardly taste it. I had to ask them for more dressing. The olives were also a bit too salty for me. The chicken could have also been marinated a bit better and could have been less dry. The pizza was decent. It was not anything special. It was thin crusted which I wasn't a big fan of. It was also a bit on the greasy side. But I did like that they added quite a bit of mushrooms.

4918788,2011-10-24,0,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just didn't cut the mustard, twice!

My first trip in memory was about a month ago to this location during late lunch.  The place was fairly empty, but the waitress was abrupt and seemed to be in a hurry.  I was in no hurry, as I was dining and catching up with a dear friend.  I felt rushed to order my food and didn't get a great look at the menu.

We started with the hummus, which was some of the best hummus I've ever had.  It was light though on the flat bread.  A clear uneven match of pita bread to the large hummus dish.  I would normally requested more, but I was too busy chit-chatting and had plenty of my main dish to eat, anyways.

I was torn between a salad and the pizza, and went with the pizza since the place is called wood fired pizza.  I went with the Tuscan and was warned by the waitress that it is topped with arugula.  I normally have no problems with arugula, so I was not deterred.  My friend got one of her known favorites, the chopped chicken salad.

Maybe I should have tried her salad instead of the pizza, since she raved about it and it looked delish.  My pizza came out and was a soggy mess.  The arugula was not chopped or cooked really and overtook the pizza.  Probably wouldn't have been so bad if the entire non-edge part of the pizza wasn't soggy.  It was also a semi-strange flavor.  I won't contribute the flavor to not liking that type of veggie pizza because it is the type I order at many other restaurants.  My husband also got the margarita pizza at another Sammy's a different day and it was also a soggy mess.

On another trip to another Sammy's I decided to try the salad, since my friend's was so wonderful the previous trip.  This time I went with the Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad, and I was, again, unimpressed.

I don't want to say I give up on Sammy's since the menu has soo many other great sounding dishes, but I have thus far been unimpressed.  On my list to try at Sammy's is the Greek salad, the Lobster Bisque, the chopped pepperoni salad, and maybe the grilled shrimp tacos.  I won't be in any hurry to try the pizzas again though.",-lOucBM3OJTb2E-Ndrmw5Q,4,2,2,CIwg0t5wVBRToDTbl71phA

It takes wowing me to get a five start, but when they told me that all first time guests get a free ""Messy Sundae."" I was sold. We had a couple different flavors of the pizza which was fantastic both that night and warmed over as left overs. The sundae was out of this world and well done.

5064445,2016-08-22,0,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"We had 2 thin crust pizzas. The 1st was a baruta n pesto. What I noticed right away was how good the crust was. The thinness and the type of oven must have had something to do with it. The mozzarella and pesto were actually toppings. It was a nice change and I haven't had pizza this way in a while. What's good about this style is that the you can really appreciate the taste of the pesto because it stands out more for some reason. The globs of mozzarella stayed melty for lil bit, which I enjoyed because I really like it that way and it helped contrast against the pesto. The sauce was a light marinara which was a nice non overpowering base for the pizza. There were also whole pine nuts to help bring out all the flavors of the pesto. I still have to have my meat and chix is my preference. Excellent pizza. The 2nd was a sun dried tomato w/goat cheese thin crust. The tomato was very good and overall flavor, but the extreme gaminess of the goat cheese really threw it off for me. I couldn't get over it  and picturing goat fur :(. So, I went back to the pesto pizza :). The service was good but for some reason, maybe because it near the end of the night and everyone was probably tired, it just didn't stand out. The place itself was really nice but it was somewhat confused w/being a sports bar. You just don't hear the game and although the music is light rock, it's kinda loud. This place is good, but I don't need to be at a real sit down and pay more when there's so many good casual places around here.",8oYMqhC5fhqAK_yxRjE7dQ,0,0,3,4pMofFxF8I3t5rGoWuF9uw

5089844,2012-12-05,0,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Meh. We were looking for food out by my grandparent's place in the Vegas outskirts. They wanted Pizza Hut, but the rest of us wanted something ""better"". Wood-fired pizza sounded like it'd hit the spot.

Upon being seated we were presented with our low-contrast menus. The low light--unnecessary for a pizza joint even if it's supposed to be ""fancy""--made them almost impossible to read. The options looked good enough: normal ""meat"" pies, pies with arugula and balsamic, bbq chicken... we got one of each. I got some pot stickers because I had a feeling that ""gourmet"" meant ""small"".

The potstickers were of the previously-frozen variety (I know, what should I expect from potstickers from a pizza joint) and were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have gotten from Trader Joe's. The pizzas were better than previously-frozen quality, but they were like that guy in the bar trying so hard to be cool but just looked like a dick. The crust was fine but did not have much of a ""wood fired"" flavor. The toppings were ok, but nothing really wowed us.

Our server tried to be friendly, but like everything else at this place seemed a bit awkward and out of place. The ambient noise--a feature of the tile floors and solid walls more than anything actually going on--made it difficult for us to hear each other, further frustrating the situation.

I can't believe I'm recommending Chili's, but it *is* across the parking lot from this place and you know what you're getting...",ZC47SpmWYEkThzMbnbBg6g,0,0,2,9rWpz6-wOBBIWLzY9AKUvA

More than just pizza!? Score. Tapas!? Double score! Since neither of us had ever been to a Sammy's & tapas were sounding good at the moment, we decided to check it out. 
We ordered the Thai chicken pizza, the Lebni cheese tapa & the parm crusted artichokes. 
1st, I must give major love & all props to the Parmesan crusted artichokes. Not exactly what I was expecting, since I didn't see the words Deep Fried Artichoke Heart anywhere in the description but eh, I'm not complaining. These made me want to slap my mama. So f'ing good. I'm currently craving them right now & trying to figure out how to convince my hubby to go pick some up. 
Lebni cheese- not my thing. Not bad, not good, just not up my alley, ya feel me? My friend loved it. 
Thai chicken pizza- not as thin crust as the waitress led us to believe it would be. It was just ok. I personally like Thai flavors on my pizza, even peanut sauce, my friend not so much, says she prefers that kinda thing cold. 
The service was just so-so. I asked for water with lemon. Then I had to ask 3 more times for the lemon. I should be used to this by now bc this always happens to me at every restaurant even though I always ask for ""water with lemon please"" when they ask what I want to drink. I think I need to just start bringing my own lemon with me everywhere. Then we also asked what spices were in the Lebni cheese appetizer & she said she really didn't know but would find out. I still don't know what the spices were. 
I don't think I'll ever be back for the pizza unless it's to try one of their supposedly thinner crusted  ""artisan pizzas"" but those artichoke hearts are going to be a hard habit to break!",4dSX2TsK3jF-g8HzIpYGrg,1,2,4,pWSXByKxDz815Te8ETV97A

We really love California Pizza Kitchen but it's a 20 minute drive from us and Sammy's woodfired pizza is just around our neighborhood. We ordered truffle fries w/ chipotle aioli (4/5), thai chicken pizza (4/5), and shrimp angel hair pasta (1/5). CPK's thai chicken pizza is still the best. Truffle fries was great but not excellent. It tasted better when the server paired it with chipotle aioli so make sure you ask for it. The shrimp angel hair pasta was so disappointing. It tasted bland for $19. No flavor at all; I just added lots of parmesan cheese to make it taste good. Their serving is generous! We will be coming back for sure but will explore different food from their menu.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza with dairy free cheese (and extra $2), and my fiance and I decided to share edamame since we were there during happy hour. If it was not happy hour, I probably would not have gotten the edamame, since they were originally $6. That just seems a little too expensive. 

The pizza was absolutely delicious, and it was my first time every having dairy free cheese. My fiance thought it was good, too. When it came time for dessert, we ordered the donuts (which do have powdered milk, but this doesn't seem to effect me like actual dairy does.) Those were okay, but came out lukewarm, instead of hot and fresh. It was a good way to end the night, but I would not go back and buy them again for $6.50.

customer service needs to tighten up... it wasn't even busy. 

Not for me.

Waste of money.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,6,2,1,K06rEU-K6qdxjzozmDSteQ

The menu was simple not too overwhelming like other places, prices mid range but fair. I got the five cheese pizza which I was a little nervous about being too much cheese but it was very very good and hit the spot. They have a nice meat and cheese sampler on the appetizer menu that I liked but a little pricey at  $16 for it. Staff was nice and attentive,  my only question was why was the place so empty at 630 on a weeknight  it's prime dining time. Only about 5 tables of guests out of 30 or so and plenty of outside seating available as well. I'll return again for at least take out..worth a try.",grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,4,Uvk0m1jM-rUOdSiBPBJkkw

we shared the hummas sampler and it was so good we got one to go. The pesto chix wrap was awesome the cole slaw side was so fresh and tasty. My mahi mahi tacos were to great grilled perfectly and just the right amount of spice. And the service was spot on! Manger was so sweet and friendly. You earned my business, we will be back.",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,1,1,5,eHmZtJOrRfq3l_aMgcerPQ
5807804,2015-01-24,1,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"We used to come her about once a month, then they changed their menu.  Food had usually been good, so we thought we would give them another try.  
Waiter never told us it was happy hour, even though it was 5:30.  Service was slow.  Had to ask twice for water.  Near the end of the meal, he finally brought a carafe for the table.
We ordered grilled mahi mahi tacos and a Chinese chicken salad.
The taco shells were greasy and soggy.  The fish was not seasoned and had little flavor.  Tacos were supposed to have avocado on them.  Mine had a pea sized piece of avocado.  I was unable to pick them up, as they were so greasy.  $12.25 and we only received 2 tacos with very little filling.

The salad had good flavor, however there were only 4 or 5 very small pieces of chicken.  I had to search for it.  Salad would have been better had they used fresh oranges instead of canned.

Very disappointed this visit.  There are too many restaurants in the area.  We won't be in a hurry to come back anytime soon.",XqxfND6MnnWCy-4Y3Hf7wg,0,1,2,wXsiUWURyKK_4D8doVpwgQ
5882398,2014-08-22,1,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"First - service was amazing.  The waitress was 'on it' - we were a large group - and the owner (?) manager (?) came over to check on us several times.  I always appreciate that.  We were a bunch of moms with babies/toddlers.  

Second- Caesar salad was FRESH.   Nothing better then a nice crisp salad on a hot summer day.   Would have paired perfect with sparkling wine/champagne.  But I was driving w/ baby... 

Third- Personal pizza size is HUGE and can easily feed 2 folks.   Pizza was good but not great; I do not understand this fascination with adding so much sugar to pizza.  Is this America now?  Are we so addicted to sugar we add it in excessive amounts to our pizzas?  

Finally - the Donut desert was super delish.   

I will go back.",3zczu4YDXk5M27xMQl-Few,1,1,4,DFAg1Ywxk-mxtYjPhvNU-Q
5948044,2017-02-04,0,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Great food, I will give them that but the prices are high and the portions aren't ""generous"". To top it off I waited tables as a student so I'm a big ""tipper"" but I didn't want to leave a tip (I did but it pained me to do it). We felt rushed out when we finally got our meals and the bill was brought to us almost simultaneously. The food came cold and when we spoke up they didn't even offer to warm it. We've gone here before and had much better service and food but for the price we will be going elsewhere next time.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,3,JPw1r57j5cICMVJQYJi1vg

5960022,2010-12-04,4,bzI2YREsxDomhVvvaZmcSw,"Ok I'm kind of a chain snob. That being said, I like this place. The food's ok, but the best thing about this place? Happy Hour!!!

Duck tacos and coconut shrimp. Lettuce wraps and kabobs. It's all good and it's all cheap. 

Ding. Ding. Ding. Everyone's a winner!  Well, maybe not the mixed drink lovers out there. Their happy hour drink menu only includes beer and wine, so keep in mind.

Even being starving the food had a terrible taste.  The best thing was the gluten free pizza - not the whole pizza as the toppings made it almost inedible, just the crust. Prices are crazy for the quality of food. $5 to add few chicken strips to the salad. Service was not very good either",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,1,0,1,drlYJzH1jn5cdppCnfPy7Q
