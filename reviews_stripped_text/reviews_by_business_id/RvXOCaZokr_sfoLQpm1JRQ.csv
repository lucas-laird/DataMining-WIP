I watched for several minutes as other customers who ordered after me receive there orders while I continued to patiently wait.  I saw my order on the screen as the five employees working the orders seemed to have bypassed mines.  After 5 minutes I decided to stand up front at the counter and no one asked me if I've been helped and other customers continued to pickup there orders.  After 10 minutes I asked for a refund and walked 2 stores down to the ice cream shop and spent my money there.  
I think the management team needs to review there procedures.  The system is in place for the employees to use the order screen but obviously there not.  Fail.  I took my business $$$ elsewhere.",plkeYerdE0mqx0WXpGF7xw,0,0,1,hBZ0ZXo-ir6Lz4v_hL16hw

So we decided to come here for a light berry pomegranate smoothie, which tasted very refreshing and great! I loved that they used Splenda sweetener, instead of, the syrup or other sugars. 

I would definitely recommend coming here when you come to this outlet on a hot and humid day!",VDnD3RKPGjIA66cAULW9iQ,1,1,4,E-5BQjAfmSYv22y9GTlXkw
2268747,2014-04-22,0,RvXOCaZokr_sfoLQpm1JRQ,"On those hot Vegas spring and summer days when you're shopping at the outdoor Premium Outlets North, this is the perfect stop to grab a smoothie, ice cream or other cool treats. However I'm usually here because the Starbucks line is out of control and sometimes even out the door. Drink service is fast here and I never have to wait too long which is good since I have to get back to work. They don't really have food options here, so expect to stop by only for drinks or treats/desserts.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,uMTzlQ-qnqUc8OD49ssF0w

After complaining about it she made me an orange julious out of what she was tossing out.   I watched her make it,  no spit....    Haha.   And NO TIP either",-Ak9LVDH8GYyWtIMnNo5Ug,0,0,2,P9Lmr5WlhWYpiWwM_Hh-ow

I got the ""pina colada"" orange Julius and I was totally in Heaven! It was soooo rich and creamy and refreshing! Thats what I needed on that scortcher of a day! It was 5$ and change for a large and worth every penny!!

My son seen the ""triple chocoholic"" blizzard and since he did a great job at the HOT mall I rewarded him! I got the mini which was 3.99$ and it took a few minutes to get. Our order was up and the guy hands me the blizzard... it was over flowing with ice cream. Others may have felt happy for this, but I was pissed! It was like 100 degrees and my son had it in his hands less than 2 minutes and the blizzard was ALL OVER the place! I was like ughhhh! Now normally having extra blizzard woulda been ok! But since it was hot as balls out and we had to walk to the car I woulda thought the dude woulda just filled it to the top and not over load it! 

We ended up throwing it away after both of us got it all over our white clothing! UGH!  Still it was ok, the OJ I mean. DQ you guys suck! JK! I have lurve for ya!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,0,3,JldgU9PVn3nSaK09Fxnsww
4492241,2009-03-29,2,RvXOCaZokr_sfoLQpm1JRQ,"This is strictly a review for their chocolate dipped ice cream cone. I hadn't had one of these since I was little. While shopping last week, my boyfriend ordered one, and after trying a bite, I was basically trying to steal it away from him. Usually I don't eat a big portion of sweets, but damn this treat was yummy. Better than any other chocolate dipped ice cream cone. okay, now I want one. But yeah, this location is great because I tend to stop in whenever it's a hot day and I am shopping at the outlets.",jNsPTMmg9EcqY7q2Q-Rm6A,3,3,4,zYc-SkTZfDZldYfP9Upsjg
4757480,2014-02-23,1,RvXOCaZokr_sfoLQpm1JRQ,"This orange Julius is absolutely terrible.  The service is good but the drinks are just overly sweet sugar water.  I always get the strawberry original Julius, and this time was such a disappointment.  I'll never get a drink here ever again.  It's also more expensive than normal. Don't get anything here unless the management makes some changes.",KvvnyBbD24KkzjfL9jg0Aw,0,0,1,HQ6ydxi7f0f08KyZ7e6R3w
5944822,2017-09-24,0,RvXOCaZokr_sfoLQpm1JRQ,I ordered a turtle blizzard and basically got a watery shake. They could not flip it over because it was so watery. It was so watery they had to leave the mixing cup on it. I didn't bother to have it remade because the wait was so long and the manager wasn't pleasant.,s7Kn9QEVTm0hAJhf4cXfCg,0,0,1,g807FqwIPWGttv6MSYt82w
