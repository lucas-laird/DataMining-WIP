With attitude and back talk they procede to remake my fries again then forget tat im there waiting for my fries. Finally someone asks me what I need. Their reason for the fries not having salt on them is that they dont have the proper tool that puts the salt on the fries so lets just serve the fries with no salt.

This has never been a problem, until today. The manager has decided that this has to be up charged now. I don't have a problem with an extra dollar and some change. What I have a problem with is how McDonald's is discouraging healthful eating now. For many, that dollar up charge could be a big deal for families on a budget, and could discourage them from having their kids eat more heathy items. Chicken nuggets and burgers have enough fat and sodium, so why force fries down everyone's throat?  90% of people will order it ""as is"". They should not discourage the other 10%.

I personally will not set foot in this establishment again, or go through it's drive-through.  I don't know if this is a corporate policy, or the franchises decision. Either way, they need to change this rediculous policy.

To top it off, they got my order wrong. Luckily I always double check my order before I leave, since this place gets it wrong 50% of the time.

Why the employee didn't ask me to make sure if it's hot or cold? Why did they blame me by saying exactly what appears on the menu? Just MOCHA! 
And whoever manager there, how come they have only one employee taking orders? People in line also got pissed because of waiting time.
Now it takes forever to re-make my order. I'm so pissed. I will not come back here again.",sf8w4vCA_ppXUAje04FjOQ,0,0,1,7PqNhXdoScaMB2JG2SD0Rg

McGriddle sausage sandwich, hash brown and coffee. Polite and efficient staff. Problem solved and I'm back on the road in minutes. See you in another 14 years!",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,0,0,3,H2R-Qp7F20DW7CLksTLHhg

The lady who took my ""order"" she was extremely rude. When I pulled up to the first window to pay for my order, I had ask if I could speak to the manger she told me to pull up to the second window. I told her that she had horrible customer service that she needs to work on it, I was trying to explain to her that I understand how stressful this could be because I'm a manger at jack in the box, before I could finish she said "" you could call customer service line "" I ask for her name and her name is Lupe. Well when I pulled up to the second window I ask the lady there if I could speak to the manger she said yeah, well a few minutes the lady came to the window and told me that the manger was busy. I told her that was fine, well as she told me "" are you gonna order anything?"" I told her yes, I already did, she said she didn't see anything on the screen, so I ask her if she could take my order she said no because I was holding up the line, I told her that's not my fault. Well the girl told me to leave her drive thru window and get back in line. I told her are you  serious and she rolled her eyes and said yes. This was far the worst. I understand people have bad days but come on! If I could I would give this location a negative star or rating. This happened on 6:20pm Sunday Jan 29.

To my surprise, this salad was full of fresh romaine lettuce and warm moist strips of pretty tasty chicken. This salad has only 450 calories which is a huge plus. They have two other types of salad for even less calories, but I bet they aren't as tasty as this one. I highly recommend going to McDonald for a last minute salad instead of the Taco Bell's Cantina bowl.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,1,0,4,Fj5K8nih4zU89A-9AXVxtw

Customers are way sketch, the drive thru is a joke, you get better service inside. And the ppl hanging out in the parking lot makes you scared getting out of the car.

They did not get my order correct. I am getting ready to cut McD's off my list, but the Cokes are the bomb! At least at some locations...the stores are tampering with the formula! That sweetness is missing. This one the sweetness was still there!

I hate to open my bag to hold up the people behind me, but doggone it...this is the 2nd time today a McD's has gotten my order wrong. The McD's on Bonanza & Nellis is notorious for getting the orders wrong as is the one on Lamb & Charleston, and they are annoyingly slow!",nWQZkvuWYtFjgw9GxQL8JQ,0,0,1,G9rLxeRDeNtuUghqpCB2qQ

2nd time here, I decided to go inside to order to-go and it's just my luck that the soda machine was down so they only offered sweet tea and iced coffee. The lady who was placing my order spoke in a very low tone that I could barely hear her and I had to repeat myself many times. Waiting for my order, I chose to sit down at a table. I was searching for a clean table and chair to sit in and managed to find one. 

That's twice now that I've had a bad experience with this mcdonalds. I'll definitely be going to a different mcdonalds even though this one is the closest one to where I live.",LWumo_buY-NOmWzXfZhifA,1,0,2,YMXW37KYX0ASgteBIJNhxA
