 When I arrived there was one other table occupied and that should have been a clue. I sat down and after asking for water a gruff man (the owner?)  came back with a water and chips/salsa. The red salsa was the one good part of the night while the green salsa was bland and tasteless. I asked to place my order right away.  I ordered a burrito with green chile(pork) as I usually use this basic dish to judge Mexican restaurants. It was $9.  First I received some starter soup that was was overly salty and plain. Then,  I sat there for about 20 minute in which one additional party arrived and my water ran out. My waiter never came back once during this time. When this other party got their food first(after ordering 10 minutes after me) I began to hope the food would be special to make up for it.

My food finally arrived and that forced the waiter to finally acknowledge the lack of water. My immediate impression was that it looked great, a wet burrito with cheese and green sauce that came with rice/beans. I started on the sides and they were basic and satisfactory. Then I made the mistake of eating the main course. I cut into the burrito and immediately saw it was filled with little cubes of waxy meat. The first taste wasn't any better. It wasn't like any chile verde or green chile I've ever had. There was the hideous meat, overcooked tough chunks of pork. I've never had stewed or marinated pork with this texture/consistency. A few pieces of onion and chiles was also inside but nothing else and there was very little green chile flavor. 

My initial thought was to ask for a refund but I don't like to do that so I literally picked out the meat and ate most of the wet tortilla and cheese only. That's how bad it was, and I still tipped around 15% against my better judgment. I just don't understand how they can serve meat/food this terrible. I've yet to find decent Mexican food in Las Vegas but even this was the bottom of the barrel. The lack of any discernible service was the icing on the fail cake.. Do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant. I'd rate it a zero if I could.",-26Qp2RKz7DQwCEKLUbxCQ,0,0,1,kx-YmBMWzZnPu-AHIU3L9A

I always have ceviche on tostadas, shrimp coctail, and at times a sea food stew. Atmosphere is relaxing, employees are friendly and very attentive. Only major problem I had,  was the drinks. You get no free refills on sodas. Other than that,  its a great place.",33ryU9GU3YUY_SCyTvIeWg,0,0,3,oBQPuuJSqyAz7US4i98aQA

They do the best Huevos Rancheros and carne Asada tacos. Really reasonable prices and their service is decent. I will recommend coming here if you want to have Mexican food and don't want to spend so much money on the strip.",b06_J_7_Kf2YQfkOGDxX4A,1,0,4,H_VD5ko8wZrfjlx7ZR_Ggw
2677853,2013-01-28,1,y6Dih1p0JqNuyfw9dQJ8_g,Checked out the reviews on yelp so decided to give this spot a try since I live close by. Drove into an empty parking lot. That was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway. The restaurant was dark and the service was ok. I ordered camarones rancheros. The shrimp was overcooked... Rice and beans were ok... Overall not impressed. Wont be coming back.,c4nYAUAc8N058A28cHNoMA,1,0,2,k2AdA399xxc5W8O0msRJdA

Surprised that I liked hot, spicy foods.  The food was spicy, but I added a rockin hot habinero sauce.  my only criticism if that there could be a little more flavoring such as cilantro.  This restauraunt is within walking distance to the hotel Rio down Valley View blvd.",1BoibcUC6Rz_jiHM8yrj7w,1,0,4,-XCLDShjbsEywHt3FSVhtg

Music was what's expected for a Mexican restaurant however a bit too loud at times so trying to carry on a conversation was a bit difficult. Overall I'd recommend giving this little family owned restaurant a go.",Nt-z5Ub5xiuIrMchNSNS3w,0,0,4,35X3-DnvG_XG3_q5YIEQGw

The restaurent is quaint & utterly adorable. Its tucked in the middle of no where & is definetly locally owned. Im a practitioner of supporting local business's, I only eat @ corporate restareunts when treatened w/bodily  harm. They also serve that yummy starter soup here. The only reason this endearing little hole in the wall is not getting 5 stars is, im not sure if everything is from scratch. Either way, I could give a flying fluff, the food is great. It put a cat that swallowed a canary grin on my face.",8gDHKlqM8UxUh-iQt0-dwQ,2,0,4,B8X4OZhhyRC54lA9vC9mIg
