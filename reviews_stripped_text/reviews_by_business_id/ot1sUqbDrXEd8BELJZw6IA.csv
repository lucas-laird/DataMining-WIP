Poor mixture of Ingredents, spicy tune was not worth putting in the mouth. 

Please this is not a fair business practice. Everyones money is hard earned. We spend our moeny to eat outside where people love to make food for others and are creative and professional. Need to have some  quality control.

2698445,2017-09-03,3,ot1sUqbDrXEd8BELJZw6IA,"Being next to a college campus, one might consider giving the taste of this restaurant's food a pass.  After all, it is a step up from Top Ramen, a staple in any college dorm pantry.   But is it really better?   Not at all. 

My entire hospital floor ordered a plethora of items off their menu.   Too much of the food we ordered were hit or miss.   In fact, throwing a dart, after being spun around and blindfolded, at a target 50 ft away would still result in hitting the mark more often than you would get something delicious and/or edible here.  

The egg flower soup- no good.   It starts bland, and finishes with a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  This is the opposite of enjoying a good wine tasting.  

Bbq spare ribs- Dry.  What it lacked in flavor it more than made up in the red food coloring it was doused in. 

Shrimp in lobster sauce- sub-average but decent sized shrimp and edible. 

Sesame chicken - Dry.  Hard.  You could not stick a metal fork through them if you tried.  If you manage to bite into one, you might discover a hint of sweetness to the chicken. 

Chow fun-  Not so fun if you ordered this. 

Teriyaki combo plate- I heard from co-workers that it was decent. 

Egg rolls, crab Rangoon-  Meh.  

I give them a star for being friendly over the phone and ordering was easy.   Being open until 4 am is helpful for us late night shift employees.  If only they were worth ordering from.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,2,0,2,C7haD9LqXOHI10TU5JUfdw

Spicy tuna should have some type of kick but no not here. Customer service was good no complaints there being it was my first time. However the woman was prepping a container of 2 or 4 ounce sauces in the dining room when I walked in so that kinda made me wonder how else food may be prepped there. She didn't have gloves on and set the pan full of sauce on top of table in the open to be exposed with the ladle sticking out dripping.

Portions are a little small but not unreasonably so. Delivery time was good, but I ordered through Postmates, so I can't speak for their own delivery service. Sad that the best part was the pot stickers, which were pretty good, but the sauce was way too sweet. Sesame chicken was mostly breading, overcooked, and the sauce was weird and dry, and also way too sweet. Pork fried rice was alright, though it was odd that it had green beans and corn in it.

4219764,2018-06-07,0,ot1sUqbDrXEd8BELJZw6IA,"I was nervous about ordering from here at first because of its 3 star rating, but after reading that most the negative reviews were about the sushi or people's orders taking too long, I went ahead and ordered (it was late and I didn't have many other options). I ordered through Postmates and the food was quick and on time. I got the family dinner A, and since I wanted Hunan Beef as an entree I called ahead to make sure they could do it since it wasnt listed as an option. They said it was ok and to just write ""+$2 and hunan beef"" in the notes, I also asked for extra sweet n sour and crispy wontons for my soup in the notes. Despite always being nervous about restaurants/Postmates missing the notes my order was 100% correct so I was def happy. All the food tasted like your basic Chinese food, the egg drop soup was better than most, but I'm still giving 4 stars because both my entrees were very dry with such a small amount of sauce on them. Had that problem been fixed I would have easily given 5 stars. Just know what you're getting into when you order late night Chinese, if you're expecting something gourmet this isn't the place, but for what I wanted at the time without leaving the house it worked out perfect for me.",zwNwfHBFIwTBFzKQJLK24A,0,0,4,xa-ruqe1l-a6b5nocw7zIw

The food got hear really fast. Less than 45 minutes. But that's about the only good thing I can say about JC Cuisine. 

The General Tso's Chicken was dry and didn't taste fresh. If you've ever ordered a Chinese dish that's battered and fried like this you know the taste goes downhill fast if it sits out. 

This General Tso's Chicken tasted like it was sitting out before being delivered. 

The Beef Chow Mein Noodles were even more tragic...

They were flavorless. Even worse, the noodles were only half cooked. It was like chewing on thin strands of raw dough.

4655106,2017-06-18,6,ot1sUqbDrXEd8BELJZw6IA,"JC Cuisine is a very new Chinese restaurant in the very old shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway and Harmon Avenue across from UNLV. Always up for trying a new Chinese restaurant, being that I was in the area, JC Cuisine would be lunch. 

When I walked inside, I showed the woman at the register the Yelp Check-in offer for a complimentary drink. Going off subject for a sentence, I could create either a Yelp Talk thread or Yelp List on the greatest excuses that businesses give for incompliance with the Yelp Check-in offer. The excuse that the woman representing JC Cuisine gave is that the lunch special excludes the Check-in offer. I'm thinking this is not the end of the world. The bottomless fountain Pepsi is $1.55 or a can is $1. And most of all the Chinese lunch in special is one of the greatest deals around. 

JC Cuisine is a full-service Chinese restaurant that also offers take out. With that said, the woman at the cashier walked me to my table. She was friendly. That is a reason that I passed over a star deduction for Check-in offer incompliance. Wearing a friendly attitude she led me to a table in the back of the house that was away from the window. This was on a June afternoon during a heat advisory. From this point on she was my waitress and I was the sole dining patron. 

Perusing the lunch special menu, I observed that there is a $5.95 and $6.95 list. The later included shrimp based entrees. Proceeding this review, there is a picture of this very lunch menu. I decided on the pepper steak with onions. At $5.95, it included a bowl of egg drop soup followed by the entr√©e with fried rice, and soft chow mein noodles. Complimenting the waitress filled the glass of bottomless Pepsi. 

Now, I will discuss the food. The egg drop soup tasted average. However, there was a tasty touch of corn in the soup. A few minutes later, the waitress delivered the meal. It was a unique presentation. This is the first time that I remember seeing Chinese food presented in a long dish that had three portions. One of the pictures that proceed this review shows the left portion holding fried rice, the center holding pepper steak with onions, and the right portion holding soft chow mein noodles. Working off the fried rice on the left portion, the taste was agreeable. Close by, it was more enjoyable working off the pepper steak with onions. Both of them were tasty and the right temperature. However, when I worked off the soft chow mein noodles on the right side, my taste buds were like, ""This is filler and they've tasted better."" Immediately I asked the waitress for hot sauce. She pointed to the bottle on the next table. I grabbed it then blanketed the soft chow mein noodles with it. This failed to blanket my opinion of the soft chow mein noodles. They were not warm. Considering that the fried rice and entr√©e were warm it was odd that the chow mein noodles weren't. Are they supposed to be not hot? Fortunately two out of the three items on the plate weren't bad. I agree with Meat Loaf's philosophy that two out of three ain't bad. Then again it ain't great. 

  The bill came out to $8.12 before the tip. After paying the bill, I left with the opinion that JC Cuisine is an average Chinese restaurant.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,10,3,n93Om7PgTThZRXTc-IzhiQ
