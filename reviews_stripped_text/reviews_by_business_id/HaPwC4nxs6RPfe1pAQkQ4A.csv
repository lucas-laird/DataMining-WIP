10909,2010-09-22,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Last night, we went to dinner at Mastrioni's Café on Hualipai.  We were in a small group and were seated quickly by a caring and pleasant Hostess.  The ambiance of the restaurant is quite striking with art works displayed on the walls.  The kitchen is open and the smell of roasting garlic was wonderful to behold and hopefully a promise of the meal to come.  Sadly this wasn't what we experienced.

Dishes ordered included Caesars Salad  for 3 couples for sharing.  When they were delivered, the wait staff hadn't a clue as to how to serve each of the 6 plates to the 6 guests who were to receive them.  The salad consisted of limp wilted lettuce (Iceberg not Romaine?) with barely enough dressing to moisten the sad pile of greens below.  The salad was quite tasteless and a big disappointment.    It certainly was not worth the $10 cost. The bread that accompanied the salad was tasteless as well.  It was perhaps white bread toasted.  The server (or was it his assistant) put some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the plates in which to dip the bread.  The bread and the balsamic dip were gone in a few moments and never replenished.

Being a large group the members ordered a variety of entrees and represented a good cross section of menu selections.  I ordered Eggplant Parmagian that was accompanied by ziti in a tomato sauce.  (Or was it tomato water?) The ziti was cool not hot, the individual pieces of pasta were stuck to each other and quite gummy.  The sauce was runny and tasteless.  The Eggplant however was plentiful and tasty.  Unfortunately, the sauce on the eggplant was anything but plentiful and far from tasty.  There was barely enough to cover the food below.  My wife ordered a dish of bowtie pasta with broccoli.  It was warm (not hot) and quite tasteless.  Both of these dishes were, most assuredly, not worth the $18, $16 respectively.  

in this town of plentiful eateries how this restaurant serving mediocre food at grossly inflated prices can survive especially with the current economy is a mystery.  Hopefully they will improve over time",O4OwAQ4HQZ1l8dcW0EaPpg,0,0,2,iKIxrFowYrjJ8KUM1bXjOQ

I really really hope they pay plug on sports radio. 

I had reservation and upon checking in the hostess and the manager seemed annoyed. 15 minutes after my reservation time, I went to host stand to check how much longer. It was as if I asked for their first born child. They were appalled that I even went up there. We ended up waiting half an hour for a table. 
Once the server saw that we were not ordering a bottle of wine, we were ignored the rest of the night. We had to continuously ask the busser for refills and even had to ask him to fix one of our entree orders since they forgot our side of pasta. 

The food tastes like it was frozen. None of the pasta is fresh. The sauce tastes like it comes from a can.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,3,0,1,-XVUZjuCd63Rttfz-S2HBw

I am a foodie. I love everything about the process of prep and the profiles of flavor. If you want a great experience of this just sit at their bar and watch the chef work. You will appreciate your food more.

I had the shrimp app. Very very good. The New York steak was cooked perfectly rare. The tomato garnish was even amazing. That should be a menu option. Very impressive.

So don't think a restaurant can't deliver on quality because it is between a nail salon and a liquor store. This place is outstanding.",vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,0,1,5,3asaG-b0v0vyjcN5O7eTZw

131840,2010-06-04,1,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"I would rate this as a one more in a long line of mediocre (at best) Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. I dined with a medium sized group  and had a chance to sample several appatizers, entrees, and deserts; as well as hear comments and view the reactions to the food quality. 

The evening started on an extremely low note and thankfully went up slightly as dinner progressed. The hostess that greeted us at the door was rude and discouraging, and the first person to greet us at our table was even worse- disheveled, rude, uninformed, and just plain insipid.  Thankfully he was just the assistant waiter or bus boy, and our regular waiter was much better (although in all seriousness, the bar was set VERY low). Our table started off with a variety of mixed drinks and appetizers, as well as the bread that was served  automatically. This was the absolute low point in the evening- the drinks were poorly made at best and took entirely to long to get to the table, two of the 3 loaves of bread brought to the table were stale and had to be replaced (even the second set didn't taste very good) and everything seemed to be a hassle to get. I put 100% of the blame on the assistant waiter. You have to understand this guy left you with the feeling of absolute incompetence.) Once the appetizers came, things picked up only slightly. If garlic and salt  sledge hammer flavors are your thing, this restaurant is for you. Of the several apps that I tasted, only the bruscetta was worth going back for, but I grudgingly give a nod to the steamers (white wine sauce and heavy garlic) and the crab cakes (very meaty but not much flavor... how?). Avloid the overcooked calamari and the absolutely boring ceaser salad (really, even a sports bar can get these right)

Dinner was thankfully better, but again the slovenly assistant waiter and overwhelming flavors marred a good, if basic, Italian meal. Of all the meals I sampled, nothing actually stood out, but nothing actually tasted horrible either-  just mediocre and overwhelmingly seasoned.   The veal chop I ordered was tender and very buttery in texture, and everyone that tried the roasted potatoes was in love. My partner was absolutely disappointed in her dish, unfortunately neither of us remember what it was exactly (a pasta with spinach and chicken) Everyone else seemed satisfied but never wowed by their food, and only two plates went back clean- two plates everyone at the table heavily partook of- the veal chop and a mixed seafood pasta 

Desert and the wines served with dinner were the highlight of the evening. I ordered a house Chianti that was very good for the price, and several  others at the table shared a bottle of Chardonay. The regular wine connoisseurs at the table seemed very pleased w/ the wine selection. 

As for desert I was once again able to sample several thing as well as take note of other peoples reactions. Several deserts were ordered and for the most part passed around. Of important note- the cheesecake (rich, dense and creamy but still light,  w/ a hint of lemon flavor) and espresso ice cream pie (very rich and creamy if slightly freezer brunt, but still one of  the table faves)  were most remarked upon and devoured in their entirety, while the tiramisu was almost completely ignored. I took a small bite and what can I say- flat, dead, dull...pointless? This is desert that every Italian restaurant should ace at, yet along with the several coffees and gelatos ordered, nobody had anything good to say about them (all of the coffee drinkers commented on an ""off"" taste) 

So, to sum up- nothing horrible yet nothing stellar;  the service was OK in some ways but atrocious in others, the food was either serviceable or entirely forgettable, and the bar is a complete failure. Another completely mediocre Vegas Italian restaurant.  Will I go back? Never.",kZXg8y7GVvGGKT4jVeSs8w,4,0,2,6UaB3yjdlUFVAaqxzakP9g

This review is only in reference to three dishes, which are in my opinion are bench marks of simple Italian food and not about the restaurant or wine menu. 

So, I'm half way through eating my spaghetti and meatballs and the first bite I had had high hopes and the hope melted like the meatball in my mouth. The meat was tender and juicy, however their was no flavor or spice. I felt as though I was eating the spaghetti and meatballs from a hospice center. What did help was the scrumptious garlic bread that I used to fill up on. 

After the disappointment, I turned to my friend who got the shrimp linguini and he chowed down on the glorious shrimps first. With a grin on his face he dug into the linguini. Within a few moments I recognized the look on his face, it was the exact look I had when I first took a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The linguini and the sauce had a mild garlic butter flavor and he wasn't a big fan either. 

I gave it two stars because of the garlic bread and the shrimp.",nTJd9YiaA1YkLOdcZZEzRQ,0,0,2,ZgIMX4iKQ6lItmpjxm9zMQ

I mean how hard is it to serve four people at the same time.  The food was very good, from pasta, chicken and veal.  The tilapia picatta was not very tasty.  Fresh fish but way too many capers.  The prices were too high, nearly Strip prices.  $45 for a veal chop is overpriced in my opinion.  Our check was $165 for one appetizer, four entrees, 4 beers, and two sodas.

341312,2012-07-19,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"this honestly deserves 1 star but the entree saved it from being such.....3 of us go to lunch today, we sit down and the server comes and asks if theres going to be 2 more (table was set for 5, we originally were going to have 5 but ended up not), like 5-8 minutes go by before he comes back to offer us drinks, so we get drinks. Then he scurries away before we can even ask him about putting something in while we wait, comes back several minutes later and we ask him to put in the calamari...i heard good things about this place specifically the calamari, i love calamari so was really really looking forward to it. 

We are snacking on bread and the oil/balsamic mix they give you, its OK...bread isnt anything to write home about...the calamari arrives low and behold it looks plain as can be, as in zero seasoning and quickly flash fried but i give it a shot nonetheless....anddddddd im spot on. $15 for AWFUL calamari, unbelievable. We thought about saying something but just let it go.

So we ordered another appetizer to go along with it, the garlic bread for a whopping $7.....what was it? It was the SAME BREAD they give you for free as much as you want, 5 tiny slices with a little garlic on top and baked....haha next time im bringing my own garlic and just eating it. Unreal.

Entrees made up for it, i ordered the salmon and the others ordered some kind of pasta which he raved about but its compared to the dog crap we were eating for the previous 45 minutes, so its hard to not be better than that. The salmon was ok, but again compared to what we were eating it was heavens grace.

Im definitely not planning a trip back any time soon and would not go out of my way for it, the ambiance inside is beautiful and the place is really really nice looking, but the food sucks.

oh and we were going to ask about the canoli but then we saw it was $10....unless that thing is stuffed with gold, im not paying $10 for a canoli",2oF_oHcerMolLL6jlO-aDA,2,0,2,WtY5yC80RUoAWB8kBDKczA

I had the linguine vongole (clams), and it was excellent. Pasta was perfectly al dente, broth had just the right amount of spice and clams were fresh. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs. Even though not a true Italian dish, (you'll never find pasta with meat balls in Italy, unless you're in a tourist spot frequented by American tourists), the meatballs were awesome, and the sauce tasted like it was made at home.

We were then told seating was limited but the counter was available.  

The porter brought water and bread quickly. Pete was our waiter and seemed attentive as we ordered our drinks and apps.  The food came quickly. We ordered fried calamari, Caesar salad, chicken Alfredo and chicken piccata.  The calamari was great, the salad was below average for the $15 charged. Boyfriend was happy with his piccata and my Alfredo was bland and chicken way over cooked.  Pete also disappeared after our food was ordered. We wanted to order desert but didn't as we began to get agitated.  

The bill, however was delivered quickly once Pete was found and we were disappointed to spend over $100 on a very below average meal and service.

Never allowed for us to be without water or have to flag them down. Our meals were the best Italian we've had in Vegas. We ordered classic spaghetti & meatballs and chicken parmigiana (bill $38 + tax and worth EVERY penny). Truly delightful with flavors, and reminiscent of home-cooked Italian food. It was hands down the best experience I've had OFF the strip. Typically, for this level of quality in every aspect I have to travel to the strip and mingle with tourist traffic, loudness, and hassle.

Not bad for a strip mall restaurant.  As for the service, I was not that impressed.  Let me start with the bread, it's plain and not fresh.  I've had better from Smith's grocery.  The seafood appetizer was delicious, something I would order again.  It was the Combo Oreganate, a combination of shrimp, scallop, clams and mussels stuffed with bread crumbs and baked on top of butter and garlic.  That sauce was the only thing that the bread was useful for in dipping with.  The waiter was not very attentive, and when I ordered the entrée and appetizer, he was quick to correct my pronunciation.  Yeah, I get it; I can't pronounce your fricken menu.  Thanks for the lesson.

My husband ordered a steak and asked for it to be medium-well.  I tell my husband to always just order medium, but he's just not a fan of getting red meat.  Upon getting our entrees, we both notice how burnt his steak looks.  I order chicken, so everything seems to be in order.  The waiter drops off our entrees and quickly disappears.  He never once came back to check if everything was ok.  I'm assuming he knew how overcooked the meat was and did not want to address it.  I understand that medium-well means a small amount of pink in the center, not charred and dry.  We had to track down another waiter to send it back.  So the waiter sends it back to the waiter that was helping us and instead of checking the meat, he quickly runs over and says, ""What, medium-well is too medium-well for you?""  My husband was polite to respond, but I wanted to deck the guy for his attitude.  I'm not sure if he's an owner, a manager, or lead waiter, but his attitude was crappy.

He goes back and checks things out.  A few minutes later he comes back to apologize.  Gee, you think if you checked the meat out before you made such a comment it would have made the experience less dreadful?  We did not reorder the steak.  The bill was paid and we left with a bad experience.  I would give this place another shot if it wasn't for the comment the waiter made.  I was offended and have a feeling there was a pre-judgment made by the waiter based on our casual attire, but either way, it was uncalled for.

A picture submitted by a fellow yelper showcasing a beautifully crafted, softball-sized meatball & a picture depicting the interior of the restaurant, Mastrioni's.

And boy am I grateful for YELP and it's users' pics. I admit i wasnt sure what to expect. Mostly positive reviews, a picture that resembled a half way decent restaurant, and a close proximity to home drove my willingness to explore new found culinary options.

Mastrioni's did NOT disappoint. From the moment i walked in, i was impressed. The decor, the lighting, the ambiance, the welcoming faces. It all screamed authentic italian dining experience.

Don't let the lack of curb appeal fool you, this place has some of the best off-the-strip Italian food. The ambiance of the place is great, the service was attentive and quick, and food was tasty!

We were sat and quickly received bread with oil and vinegar. The wine list was great and my wine quickly came out with a generous pour. No complaints here! For an appetizer, I ordered a greek salad and also had the stuffed clams for the table. The greek salad was really great and the clams were sinfully good. I recommend dipping the bread in the clam sauce, just a hint from a fellow foodie ;). 

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree and told them to make it extra saucy. It came out extra saucy for sure! Their red sauce is really tasty with just the right amount of spicy. The meatballs were huge, but could have used a little more salt or flavor. When I cut a meatball open, I like to see herbs and spices and there was only meat in these. But the entree was good and I would order it again. 

My husband got the chicken parm which he orders anytime he sees it on the menu. He said that the chicken parm was really good, but not the best. However, from a chicken parm expert, a ""really good"" is saying something!

We will be back for sure.",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,5,4,4,Xst5f94uGJO21I5gbx7nAg

The grilled veggie plate was perfect, the veggies were all still warm, and the garlic marinated peppers were so good.

The seafood salad was traditional and incredibly well cooked....meaning the squid/prawns/scallops were barely cooked thru so they stayed tender. Dressing was perfect balance of evoo and lemon with lots of micro-greens/celery/capers. It was a very large order enough for 4 to share as an appetizer.

The spaghetti bolognese was excellent, as good as I have had in a long time. I am an Italian chef and make this dish several ways and generally don't think much of most bolognese sauce in most restaurants because it is just not that great....often good but not great. This sauce neared perfection. What was amazing was they split it for us and came out with two large pasta bowls filled. The order was huge, great value for sure.

My family and I initially were set on another Italian place, but we left since the hostess said it would be a 45 to an hour wait without a reservation. Since we already had our hearts set on Italian food, we decided to go to mastrioni's since it seemed to have good reviews. We got there and , to our delight, were seated immediately. Service was prompt and decent, but the food was realllllly blah. 

For starters we had the combo oreganate. It had baked scallops, shrimp, mussels, and clams stuffed with breaking. It was okay at best. The sauce was bland, and the whole thing just lacked flavor. My son and I shared the chicken fettuccini Alfredo, and my husband had the lobster ravioli. The lobster ravioli was quite good-- sauce was light yet creamy, and there was a substantial amount of lobster in the dish (albeit a little overdone). Now the chicken Alfredo was an entirely different story. The pasta tasted like the dried pasta you get from the supermarket, and the sauce was no different. Seriously, it tasted just like canned/jar sauce! The chicken pieces did not have any seasoning and was very rubbery, and overall was just very unpleasant to eat. I normally scarf down my food and very rarely leave left overs, but I even surprised myself with how reluctant I was to take more than 5 bites of this dish. I feel like the taste of the food we ordered did not justify how much we had to pay for our meal. 

Who knows, maybe Alfredo just isn't their specialty, or maybe the chef was a just bit light handed with the seasoning tonight. Since it is an Italian and seafood place, maybe they just specialize more on the seafood, and not so much the pasta. Many thoughts come to mind as to why our experience was less than stellar, but will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.",75ZIgkBYYTvHdeUHcg3tMg,2,1,2,CL-FIv7OTx1ww5kRx8KAvw

Right away, we were given fresh bread and our drink order was taken.  Our waiter came right behind to state the specials, one of which I ordered which was Osso Bucco with lamb.

Our appetizers were excellent, I had a bruchetta with very thick toast while the wife had the 3 tomatoes/mozzarella plate that was so fresh it was like cream. My wife's entree was a shrimp alfredo with very fresh shrimp and perfectly cooked pasta.  My lamb was falling off the bone as it was so tender and juicy.

We were full but I had to try the creme brulee which was outstanding, again just a soft texture.  The atmosphere is light and not stuffy, plenty of staff working to handle the rush and there is a bar with several televisions which had the basketball/hockey playoffs on.

I have since gone back and given this another chance.  It was super and back to the original service I experienced originally.  The owners are from New York and have made this place one of the best Italian places in Vegas.  If you like watching the kitchen and food preparation, sit at the bar and enjoy the show!
Original review 6-3-2015
First off let me say this was my go to Italian place!  Ive gone 6+ times and have no problems with the price as long as the food is great and service is super too. 
That being said...one of my favorites is the seafood over linguini....in the past it was awesome with a nice blend of seafood.  This last time...it was LOADED with calamari and they were as rubbery as hell.  I literally could not eat it.  I was stunned!  Usually the food has been SO GOOD in the past...I wondered if they changed owners or chefs.
I ate what I could...then decided some spumoni pie with coffee would end the meal on a high note....well not so.  The coffee was good..but the ice cream spumoni pie was direct from the deep freeze and was HARD as a rock.  It was not edible until it defrosted for 30 mins....I was so disappointed in Mastrioni's.

I did mention it to the waiter...but he just shrugged it off saying it will get better when thawed...well no duh.

Then to end the evening...the wait staff do not seem to know what one is doing with the others.  The table next to ours....the couple left...and it sat for a few mins before they could clear the dishes.   Then another wait staff came over and removed the table cloths and napkins and placed clean a clean table cloth on.
LOL then the original wait staff came over and  removed the table cloth thinking it was dirty...and proceeded to put another one.  It was comical.  Hopefully they will smooth out the rough edges.",xEtoLeRLkNdXJjTvVNoq8Q,1,0,4,v0fWRMVRLNM8s1kp7EcsiA

My companions were lukewarm about their salmon entrees as the darkness of the underside seemed to be a deterrent, but my main issue was the plating and lack of fullness for the price. The salad was $13 which is firm for what it was, but sea bass at $36 with a side of room temperature vegetables was too much. For $36-there should have been a small amount of roasted potatoes or such  and the presentation would have been better if the included vegetable side had been on the plate so the bass wasn't so lonely looking. Flavor was fine but in competing with the big boys at big boy prices-up the food presentation and include a carb side to fill out the plate as I am home now and snacked a bit after dining out.. and promise I'm not a giant :)",C3-__jJNxwbR5Rvr-CaW1g,0,0,3,c38-JoYqnre_fib_z-a8-g

Interesting dessert options that I did not get to try.  Roasted banana gelato, for example, sounded yummy but we were just too full from the fried food.

Full liquor license but I didn't see an actual bar.  There is a bar that overlooks the kitchen but I couldn't figure out where the alcohol was coming from.

How funny would it be if that was my whole review? But it's not, because I was so blown away by the food and service at Mastrioni's that I have a lot to say! First of all, my server was superb and so was everyone that helped him bring the food to my table. Our drinks were never empty once. I felt so well taken care of as a customer that I literally wrote on the receipt, which is something my mom would do! Garrett was our primary server. He was kind, quick, and attentive. He hit the perfect spot for service between over-bearing and just plain helpful. 

I have to admit that I didn't think this would be such an excellent restaurant. I didn't look up the prices and based on the outside I expected it to be cheaper/faster than Olive Garden! I was certainly confused!! This place was pricey, like $30 a plate pricey. I should have paid more attention to the $$ on Yelp, but I just saw it had good reviews and went for it. Beyond the initial shock of looking at the menu, everything that accompanied was spectacular. It is mich bigger than it seems on the outside, the atmosphere is open and dim and perfect for a romantic date night. My boyfriend was in a T-Shirt so we weren't prepared for the romantic part but we were sure ready to eat.

I hate that I didn't take any pictures but I was so busy enjoying myself that the phone didn't get touched until desert. Those cream puffs, though. Yumm! If cream puffs are an obsession of yours as they are mine, you will be pleased. Working backwards, Eric had a shrimp parmigiana which was probably our least favorite thing. It was good but I wouldn't order it again with all the other delicious options. I had the seafood combo linguini with white sauce and it was amazing. The amount of seafood was everything I ever wanted, it was basically half seafood and half noodles. Normally I feel lucky if my seafood linguini comes with a few muscles - this one had that and scallops and octopus and all manner of seafood galore. We had the fried calamari for an appetizer which was great but not different than any other good calamari. We also split a Summerlin Salad made with arugula which is my favorite green. It came out already split, gotta appreciate that extra effort!

I drank a few glasses of moscato which may be messing with my ability to critique, but as of right now I just can't wait to go back to Mastrioni's! I just wish I knew how to pronounce it.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,2,1,5,VoGn28IdPee-3CAjVyPnNQ

There's really not much in Vegas for a nice sit down meal off the strip and that's why I think it gets all the high marks. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. But for the price I'd wayyyy rather Vitners grill or drive to the strip. I wouldn't avoid it.

2662282,2015-07-23,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"There are 2 reasons why this place is getting 3 Stars from me. Reason number one is that i actually never physically ate inside the restaurant. I usually just order for pick up & eat it at home. So i can't really give it a full rating until i actually sit in and dine. I love their food. Their Ziti, meatballs & raviolis are good. My husband enjoys their steaks also. Now the second reason why they got 3 stars from me is because of customer service over the phone. About 90% of the time when i ordered i get the same girl on the phone. I don't know her name, but she sounds like she does not want to be there. If you ask her a question it seems like you're bothering her and she responds back with a bit of an attitude. She also tries to rush you off the phone. I will try to visit this restaurant in the near future and actually dine in so that i can update the review.

Unusual for a place way off the strip, or for a place not located in Town Square or Boca Park.  We had a young lad serving us that was quite pleasant and efficient.  I ordered the house salad with balsamic dressing that was excellent.  My main dish was just a basic penne with meat sauce.  I thought it was very average.  The restroom was very clean.

I ordered the scampi shrimp and the seafood linguini (it advertises as fresh seafood). Biggest mistake ever. The seafood was not fresh at all. All of it had that fishy taste that old seafood gets. The shrimp was cooked well but it tasted horrible. The calamari and mussels were bad too really fishy taste. I just went there tonight and will not be going back. I get that its vegas and there is no ocean here but this was laughable. The total check was 150 after tip @ 20 percent. The service was good and fast but goodness was the food awful.

2709207,2015-10-02,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Giving this place 3 stars is a lot for the experience that I had. Let me start by saying the food here is excellent! In addition the speed of service is also great. My complaint here is not the food so much as the ambiance and a specific server. I honestly wish I had kept the receipt with the servers name on it bc I couldn't tell you what it is. However I know he is an older man who wears his glasses around his neck. The experience I had with this server was terrible. I will start by saying he is very educated in the specials and the menu and was able to suggest many meals to us before we even opened the menu. However, when myself or anyone at my table asked about how a certain item is he just said it was great and almost seemed like he was annoyed. Now let me say, I am also a server and know sometimes tables can be annoying but obviously I work for tips and know that my guests spend a lot of money to come out to eat and I should show them great customer service. We began the meal by ordering the caprese salad which was on the pricey side it was $17 for about 4 pieces of buffalo cheese and about 5 tomatoes none the less it was delicious. Typically when the food is ordered the server will bring the oil and balsamic vinegar prior to or when the meal is delivered. This server didn't, which is fine everyone forgets things from time to time. What upset me was that when my 15 year old brother asked him for balsamic vinegar he asked for balsamic vinaigrette which he soon corrected himself. The server responded with ""I got it I know what you mean you're food just came out"" with an attitude. Strike one. I didn't like that response again coming from a server my response would've been absolutely I apologize I didn't think your food would come out so fast or something along those lines. Ok, strike one I'll let it go. A little while down the meal an older ""bougie"" woman was sitting behind us with one of the chefs. Now keep in mind, I'm Pacific Islander and have a sleeve of tattoos, typically I get judged by ones who think they are of a higher class. None the less, I can definitely afford to be eating at this restaurant. Anyway, she sat with the chef and continuously stared at my family and myself and was making comments to the chef and our server. Whatever I also let it go, it was my younger brothers birthday and I wasn't going to let some random woman ruin it. But what upset me was when she muttered something to my server he looked back at her laughed and said ""I would respond but I don't want to offend anyone else in this room."" Clearly I knew he was talking about my table, because I know he wasn't talking about the 4 elderly people having a quiet dinner in the corner behind us or the two business people eating beside us. I found it to be rude but again said nothing just thought ok strike two. Now what really tipped me over the edge to where I just had to pay out and leave because again I didn't want to ruin my 15 year old brothers birthday; I asked the busser before asking for the check if the restaurant does anything for birthdays. He said they do bring it out but you have to pay for the dessert. I had a cake at home for him so I didn't want to pay for a dessert my brother is a kid and I know kids like to feel special on their birthday that was all. So again coming from someone who works in the industry I thought let me double check with my server because sometimes the bussers don't know. I checked again and advised the server I asked the busser and this is what he told me. The server annoyingly looked at me and said ""yes you have to pay, did you want something""? I said no it's fine he doesn't need the dessert it was just the matter of if you did do something complimentary it would be a nice touch to the night and make him feel special. My server looked at me and said ""no we don't sooooo the check""? I said ok yeah sure lets close out. After he brings out the tab before running my card he picks up a dinner candle off another table, puts it in my brothers face and shouted ""we have a birthday"" laughed, picked up the check and proceeded to close us out. Aside from wanting to knock him out at this point because he was clearly mocking me i felt extremely bad for my younger brother who was completely embarrassed. Needless to say he did NOT blow it out. The experience was completely rude and I was completely baffled to have been treated the way our server treated us. The food was great and for four of us to eat was $150. Not bad for a nice restaurant but not cheap for shitty service. I didn't ask for a manager and I was going to write a note to the server explaining how humiliating he made us feel. Instead I left him 20% which now I regret due to him making our time there regrettable, however as I stated before the food was impeccable and speed of service was great so I tipped based on that. However I will not be returning to this establishment due to this server and felt the need to share my experience.",YMvqAOUPChnEpIGnUl4geQ,3,0,3,c-ISUrmamSMizvYKF0hynw
2716182,2017-10-01,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,Went there tonight for my birthday dinner and wasn't all that impressed unfortunately. I was really looking forward to trying the lobster ravioli and even though it's not on the regular menu they were still able to make it for me. Maybe they shouldn't have because it was such a let down to be honest. From the pictures from other people's reviews it looks so fresh and yummy with a decent amount of lobster. The tiny bit of lobster that was on mine was dry and tasteless and the portion was way too small for the price. It was also kinda bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Alfredo and his pasta was undercooked and gummy and my mom's grilled chicken was dried out. We did make a reservation since it's a Saturday and they gave us a nice table with no wait even though we were a couple mins early. Our waiter wasn't super friendly...he provided decent service though. For $100 I think we could have had a better meal and experience elsewhere so I probably won't be back.,DL6VlD98ZipLLUkY9iJNVQ,0,0,2,u0uQfFO2lyZS8oZtOQlqSA

We decided to order that and also get an order of spaghetti and meatballs.  Our food came out incredibly fast and we were incredibly happy about that. The crab legs were delicious. When we tried the spaghetti and meatballs the pasta sauce as well as the meatballs were incredibly bland. We decided to return it and get something else. The waiter brought us a bolognaise dish but ultimately it just looked like a smashed up version of the spaghetti and meatballs and practically tasted the same with a little more seasoning. We ate it anyways. We decided to order a creme brûlée for desert which was really good. We had also ordered a $25 bottle of wine with our food. When the check came we had realized our waiter failed to mention the price of the crab legs appetizer before we decided to order it and the cost for about four (not even full legs) crab legs was $65. Despite our waiter being incredibly friendly and welcoming, he still charged us for the meal we returned and did not have the decency to comp the spaghetti and meatballs or at least the desert due to our dissatisfaction. All in all our total was about $140 including a tip. I was very disappointed in the meal and what my boyfriend paid for it. It was absolutely not worth the cost.

Us ""no way we are getting stuff in the corner give us this table""

Chicken Marsala was excellent as was their Chicken Piccata. My wife had a gluten free chicken dish with Penne and said it was terrific.  We ordered wine by the glass and really enjoyed the selections. Our server was the best and made our evening that much more enjoyable. Would definitely come back, but will skip the chopped salad.

Bar for a quick drink of finger food, semi-private area if you want to have a small party, and the normal tables are large enough to handle the portions. We had the shrimp cocktail (super), Palm salad (colorful, not too much dressing, just the right sized heats of palm), and the Chicken Vesuvius. Top that with a Blueberry martini which was not from some pre-mix but made from hand, and you've got yourself a fine fun meal. I'm sure their desserts are great too, but we were way too full to even try.

Great local Italian restaurant. High quality at an affordable price. I wouldn't necessarily say it's neighborhood pricing but the portions and quality match the price and then some. Entrees range from about $17-$25 on average with meats a little pricier. Appetizers are really expensive in the $15-$20 range but are larger, family style offerings. 

We had a chicken Parmesan and a seafood penne with vodka sauce. We also had a bottle of wine for a great price and the caprese. The caprese was enormous and easily shareable - a nice starter. We ordered our entrees extra extra spicy and the chef did not disappoint. The sauces had some type of pepper that really burnt the lips - perfection. The dishes themselves were fantastic for entrees and the spice level was perfect. Props to the chef for delivering on spiciness as we hoped for. 

Mastrioni's has takeout options as well as a nice dining area with a bar and a few tvs. Staff is great and alcohol prices are very fair. Open for lunch and dinner, this place is a great local Italian option in Summerlin for a meal.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,tb6Nc8NI1u9EgwSZy_4Omw

Definitely recommend sharing both of those dishes and if you tell them you're sharing they'll even split it for you ahead of time. For appetizer we had the crab cakes which were delicious. Crab cakes are my favorite appetizer so I order them at almost every restaurant I go to that offers them and these are definitely on the top of my list. I also had a bite of my friend's halibut which was also very delicious and the portion was more reasonable for one person. And last, but definitely not least... the dessert! I am not a big tiramisu person, not that I dislike it's just not my first pick on a dessert menu, but we were told it was a must try and it definitely was! By far the best tiramisu I've ever had!

I got one of their specials, a seafood risotto ($30) full of squid, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. There was rarely a bite without seafood. Unfortunately, it was bland and forced me to do what I rarely do in any restaurant -- reach for the salt shaker. I had to use it several times to liven up the dish. The portion size was huge, but it also lacked the creaminess of a great risotto.

If you're a fan of chicken parmagiana, the one here is bound to please with a zesty and full bodied sauce. I can't remember having a better version anywhere in town. It was accompanied by a huge side of spaghetti, which made for some great left overs the next day.

They do have a kid's menu with a few pasta options.

My Palm salad was over-dressed....drenched....in oil and whatever else was in the salad dressing.  My veal Milanese was pretty good but the side of penne with marinara was terrible. Store bought pasta, for sure, cooked to a gummy, mushy texture that no serious chef would allow out of the kitchen. Awful. 

Another irritation at Mastrioni's is that when you arrive at the appointed time for your reservation...or early...or late, the hostess always, every time, says, ""it will be a few minutes.""  Even when the restaurant has plenty of open tables and waiters standing around looking bored.  The hostess has you wait, maybe two minutes, maybe ten, before you are seated. Why do they do this?....it's NOT something fine restaurants do. The hostess also gives off a distinctly unfriendly aura. 

One other specific complaint: when I sat down at the table on my most recent visit, the bread plate had a half used Tic Tac stuck to the plate. Disgusting, only made worse when the Seater said it looked like a tooth.  

Lots of diners there in shorts and t-shirts.....really diminishes what is positioned to be a fine dining establishment.

One final complaint.  Mastrioni's should allow reservations via Open Table. Calling for reservations in this day and age is old school and annoying.",9VUBm41ZyGrLo4seD7Iqgg,3,1,3,xMnYi_FLktEDtts9Gg-5cA

3625456,2017-02-28,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Went for the first time last night with family after my Italian cousin who recently moved here from Jersey had been a few times and recommended we take our other cousin from Jersey here to enjoy her last meal before flying back east. I am a tough critic of Italian food in Vegas and can not believe I haven't heard of this place sooner. Kurt was our waiter and he was superb! I joined the table after he took everyone else's drink order and he asked what I like and recommended a great wine. Based on his personality, I trusted his judgment. He was super friendly, understood our east coast sense of humor and made great recommendations. This is the type of place where you can tell the servers love what they do, are well trained, know the menu and have experience. Or at least this is the impression Kurt left. I can't really speak for the other servers.We had 4 kids with us and he was super patient as well. 

We ordered calamari and cheese salad as apps which were both delicious. Calamari tasted fresh with a crispy breading and tender inside, not chewy at all. Sauce was really good. For meals our table tried ziti, raviolis, meatballs, scallops, and I had the Linguini and clams in a white sauce. Absolutely delicious with a huge amount of clams. Most places tend to be stingy with the clams. I forced myself to eat every bite, as i did not want to waste any and bringing it home wasn't an option last night. The baked ziti was like what I'm used to back east that most Italian restaurants can't get right in Vegas. This place is the real deal. I tasted the scallops and they also tasted fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try the eggplant parm. I was reluctant to try it on my first visit, as I like a traditional fried, layered and baked and have not found a restaurant in town that does it the way they do in New York and Jersey. Kurt promised I'd like it, so I will be back to try that.  For dessert, we tried the tiramisu, cheesecake and kids had gelato. The tiramisu was on point. Tasted homemade and fresh! I don't really like cheesecake but this was excellent. Again, tasted very fresh and homemade. I failed to mention sooner, it's a very comfortable nice looking restaurant with a good atmosphere. The bar area looks very nice as well. It's a good sized place with enough room for several large tables, but small enough to feel cozy, like a neighborhood family owned restaurant.",hdd74MAafrVX8PHoRponGA,1,0,5,wATN2n5XBPduvnC9DBd35Q

Definitely delicious and we'll worth the cost. We had the shrimp cocktail, beef carpaccio, spaghetti and meatballs and the rigatoni pasta with meat sauce, and cheese cake of course. 
 I tried everything we ordered and loved everything but the beef carpaccio. The shrimp were fresh and huge, loved the horseradish it came with. The beef carpaccio was Ok,  I have had better.

There's always a debate between which appetizer to get, there are so many good ones! On nights likes tonight, when I am not feeling seafood, I order the bruschetta appetizer. The best bruschetta I have ever had. Ever. I usually do the clam oregenate, crab cakes, or seafood salad!

I had the Penne, Chicken, Mushroom, and Sun-dried tomatoes. It is probably my favorite pasta dish, of all time. I also really love their Penne, Shrimp and Scallop Vodka. 

My friend chose the delicious Ribeye, cooked to a perfect medium rare. I kept stealing the parmesan potatoes that came with it. 

For dessert, we shared a scrumptious slice of homemade cheesecake and Creme brûlée. Because who can resist mouth-watering, fluffy, perfect cheesecake?!

Definitely a must try! They get busy on the weekends, but are usually good about quickly seating you. I still recommend making a reservation

Most of the food was delicious. The service was horrendous. It is way overpriced. 

I had pasta fagioli soup. ($8) There was not one single piece of pasta in it. Hmmm...what a misnomer? Regardless, it was hot and flavorful. Hubby had linguini and clams. ($22) I had a shrimp and scallop vodka pasta. ($26) My pasta was cooked perfectly and it was nicely seasoned. Very good. My pet peeve, happens all the time, is that I had to dig my fingers into my pasta with red sauce, while wearing white, to surgically remove the tails from my shrimp. It is not appropriate. The customer should not have to do the food prep on this. Remove tails. My girlfriend ordered sea bass ($35). It was totally mushy and improperly thawed. She did say the spinach was tasty though. 

Our dirty dishes sat on the table for the entire meal. We asked multiple times for bread. We never got more water. Our server never checked on us and our food. Service was poor. 

The price point makes no sense for a neighborhood Italian place. 

Expect tasty food but expect to pay more than it's worth. Maybe service was a fluke. The table next to us was equally as irked. They cancelled their food and were visibly upset with the server.

4019309,2016-03-06,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Mastrionis is without a doubt, one of the best and most hidden gems in all of Las Vegas, especially for Italian food. My wife and I have been coming here for special occasions including wedding anniversaries.

This place is easy to drive by, as its smack dab in the middle of a little row of businesses and could easily be overlooked like a typical deli or subway from the outside, and it's tinted windows make it difficult to see inside.

Once inside however, this place is very classy. It's well lit with a well dressed and well mannered staff.

The first time we went, for appetizers my wife ordered the bruschetta which was incredibly flavorful and obviously prepared fresh.  She insist it's some of the best she has had. I myself took the opportunity to order the crab cakes, which I am always hesitant to do as most places typically delivery small cakes that are not worth it. At mastrionis however, the crab cakes I got were large in size and full of flavor, a must have for any fan of crab cakes.  In addition to this the restaurant also serves bread with olive oil and balsamic which is just a great way to start your meal.

For dinner we again tried something different, I myself ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and added the shrimp to it.  The pasta had a rich creamy flavor with a thick sauce that can never be accused of being watered down. The shrimp were big and fresh and added that seafood taste to my dish that I was craving.  My wife ordered the Parmesan chicken, which was also large in size and fantastic tasting. You could actually taste the seasoning and flavor in the chicken instead of just a mouth full of bread. The dish also came with a side of pasta with a home made marinara sauce that was just outstanding.  

Pros: a very romantic atmosphere for a date but also very family friendly. It's got a darker interior which I personally enjoy. Outstanding food, some of the very best I have had in Vegas or California. After eating here you'll likely never step foot into a chain like Olive Garden again.  This place also has generous portions on the plates and appetizers we have tried here.

Cons: Pricing. A dinner salad will run $10 which despite excellent flavor seems a little steep.  Adding shrimp to my pasta was about $4 I believe which felt a little high considering the amount they give.  This alone was the only thing preventing 5 stars.  When we went the first time we ordered two appetizers, tow salad, two meals and two drinks which ran us $100+. Salads should not be more than $5 and a few of the appetizers should be a couple bucks less.",MonzeL9WteeNAqYZG07cIw,2,0,4,1P-iqRxDR9bcdM6Pff5eRA

There were two large shrimp and 4 clams and 4 mussels in their shell. Then the filler was tiny squid. All of this looked great, but I've never had such a poor dish. Either they forgot the wine in the white sauce or there was too much water in the pasta... I don't know which but the white sauce tasted like buttered water and nothing else. It was quite disappointing. And I was starving so just about everything should have tasted good, but after this dish, I have decided that I'm not trying it again.

Service was awesome...A+.  someone was always available to clear away, refresh drinks, serve, offer condiments or check on us in general.  

The food was also spectacular.  Didn't care for the desserts, so only an A.

My husband said he'd like for the waiter to mention to the manager that we'd really like to speak to her very briefly...less than 2 minutes (to compliment the staff...we decided not to hassle her w/ the large party conversation).

But on the inside the restaurant has high ceilings dedicated only to open air. The tables are nicely spaced apart and set with linens, art on the walls. Super classy. 

I really want to like this place, but the food wasn't so great. I went with a couple friends for lunch. I think out of all of the entrees we ordered, mine was the best. I got the Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Pasta ($17). I am a sucker for a vodka sauce and this dish didn't disappoint. The scallops were cooked perfectly: to a supple tenderness, not overdone. And the scrimps were shelled all the way to the tail. I love that. The dish had a nice balance was nicely portioned. 

My bf got the Veal Marsala ($16). I had a taste of the sauce and - holy crap (in a bad way). It  was way too sweet. My first thought was pancake syrup. 

My mom got the Pork Tenderloin ($15), which she said was not so tender. She said the gravy was very tasty and hearty, but so hearty that she could barely taste the pork. Well, hot damn. 

Both my mom and bf got a side of spinach with their entree. I thought the spinach was pretty salty. I love salt, but I love balance more. 

They played smooth jazz -- Buble and Sinatra -- during our stay.  

They tout a full bar. My mom ordered a Long Island Ice Tea. My bf noticed they only serve three Italian reds by the glass. Seems a bit under par for an Italian joint.

We made reservations and arrived 10 minutes early.  It being Valentines's Day we knew that it would probably be a little bit crazy getting seated.  There was a little confusion and we waited a bit longer than expected but they were very quick to remedy the situation.

The service here is excellent. Our server was Vince and he was awesome. Super attentive and polite, couldn't ask for better :) 

I ordered the chilean sea bass, bruchetta style...holy cow, it was amazing! Husband ordered the surge and turf, which he said was a little more charred than he would have preferred, but it was a ridiculously busy night for them, so we understand. When we brought it to their attention, again they were quick to remedy with a fabulous dessert. We picked the cheesecake (really really good), but since we devoured dinner there's wasn't anymore room and we took it home.  

Very nice dinner for just the two of us or with a group of friends. High ceilings, big open room, small bar that you can order food at in the back. A little pricey, but worth it.  We'll definitely be back soon.",cn4Kvf2hEGkPjkclNJNgmg,1,0,4,5uW5-uNJqpIPwyjoFI3j6Q

We were never rushed, which we are used to so it was shocking when our waiter asked if we were ready to fire our entree- awesome!

The food is amazing, I've worked at high-end Italian and this place is just as good if not better. Very generous with the bread, we got the Key Lime Pie Martini(and a Peach Martini, she preferred the K.L.P) and Very Berry Martini- both were delicious. 

House salads as appetizers, I got the balsamic which I found perfectly balanced. And I got the pasta with red sauce and sausage, my friend went a lil healthier and got pasta and broccoli, though her plate was good, well, mine was heaven. Even though we were stuffed (large portions) we got Cheesecake and the Tiramisu. Well, the tiramisu was light and fluffy- tasted like they had just made it, and the cheesecake was rich and yummy. 

The plates average 15-18 (nicer meals like Veal is higher 25-30), price is fitting for the food, the bill was about $120- worth it!

4413682,2012-04-22,2,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"I had a hard time choosing the rating for this place since I had mixed feelings about the food and service. When I walked in there was no hostess at the stand. A waiter came to greet us and said someone would be right over. No one really came? Finally got seated after a while. The people behind me were irked that no one came to greet them and asked how long I was waiting.

Appetizers: eh
sauteed calamari- thought I'd give this a try since you don't really see sauteed calamari on menus. comes in red or white wine sauce. The calamari was OKAY. wasn't great, wasn't bad, just slightly chewy. We ordered white wine and i SWEAR the waiter said he was going to bring a side of the red wine sauce for us to try but no such sauce appeared. The sauce was so plain and so watery. It literally tasted like they made this great sauce and poured water on it to spread it a little further. When I ordered this dish I imagined I would be able to dip the bread in the sauce. would NOT recommend
caprese- this was good. no place can really mess this up. they also give you oil and balsamic vinegar on the side to top it.

Entrees: ordered all the specials
seafood risotto- i enjoyed this dish it was filled with seafood. It came with about 4 large shrimp, lots of calamari, scallops, mussels, and peas. after eating the sauteed calamari i was calamaried out. this had a lot of calamari in it. there were also a fair amount of peas, if you don't like peas better ask for it to be left out. it was perfect! came piping hot, not TOO creamy and just the right amount of flavor. would order again! eating my leftovers for breakfast!!
lobster ravioli- after all the hype via yelp we had to try the lobster ravioli and boy did it deliver. the ravioli was delish!! it was also sprinkled on top with more lobster chunks. the noodle was made with spinach or mushroom or something (the ravioli was striped) and a little bigger than the traditional square, more like a rectangle.  ate everything and then wiped up the sauce with bread. SLURP.
bone-in veal- i didn't try this but my friend ordered it. He said it was alright and didn't seem impressed. he enjoyed the other two dishes more.

Dessert: 
Cannoli- I loveeeeeeee cannolis and I haven't found a GREAT cannoli to rave about in Vegas. this order came with two, but not that great. would not order again
Sauteed banana gelatto- this was... just banana gelatto. good but i was expecting more from the name. maybe like chunks of banana or something in it?

Overall they did a a good job with the entrees. The desserts and the appetizers are ones to forget. The waiter took our bread basket away to get more and then we had to ask for it 3 times to get it back. We ordered a specific year for our wine and was brought the incorrect one. Also the clientele there that evening were dressed very.... minimal... Not something you'd expect at an off the strip restaurant. Something to consider for those with children.

Our Entrees, on the other hand, were great!

Caesar salad pretty good. The bits of anchovy are optional, and ideally, I like to be entrusted with the whole fish. Still, it's better with than without. 

The tomato basil soup is good and very rich. I like it, though I think it sets the tone for a heavier meal. 
The pasta fagioli wins a less-complicated endorsement. 

Entrees: I tried and loved a mushroom risotto with bay scallops. Crimini and more mushrooms were good, not overwhelming at all. The risotto was perfectly cooked (though not very hot temperature-wise), and the scallops were delicious. Orbs of oceaniac joy are beached atop the risotto.

Desserts: Let's definitely talk cannoli. Hard shell, good crunch with perfect ricotta filling and stuffed with chocolate almost-chips. Better than chips.

Party also had and enjoyed the tiramisu, but I was otherwise engaged, and will simply have to take their word for it.

Hats off to the servers, who do a great job. Loved that the Front Waiter steered me in the direction of a wine I wanted -- not the one he might have necessarily wanted to sell. Cheapest of the Sauvignon Blanc, and it was delicious (Sea Glass from Santa Barbara).

This place is new nice looking restaurant in a plaza with plenty of parking. We arrive around 5:00 PM and the place was pretty empty, but by 5:45 PM it was completely filled, so you might want to make reservations before going. The service at the restaurant is great, the staff is friendly and welcoming and seems like they will do their best to meet you needs, one person in the group tends to be really picky about things and the staff had zero problems with meeting his requests.  Anyways on to the food, we ordered a total of 4 dishes


Osso Buco served on Fettuccine (5/5 stars) - This item was one of the specials and it was one of the most amazing dishes I ever had, the meat was so soft and tender. it just fell off the bone.  They also provided a small fork so that you can get to the bone marrow or the bone.  it was a little pricey ($45), but well worth it! so I would still give this dish 5/5 stars. It is big enough to share, but DON'T! its too yummy.

1/2 Baked Lobster topped with crab meat, served with papperdelle with seafood sauce (4/5 Stars) - This was also one of the specials, it consisted of a a whole Maine lobster that was split in half, topped with crab meat. The pasta it came with was a seafood sauce that contained clams and shrimp.  All of the seafood was top notch and really fresh. This dish was really good, but didn't stand out as amazing to me. but still worth the $42 price tag.

King Crab Legs (4/5 Stars ) - This dish consisted of 6 mersus sections of the crab leg. which is the largest part of it between the body and the first joint. The Kitchen does most of the work and cracks the shell and the correct point so that you can pull the whole section of meat out without much effort.  The meat its self was VERY fresh, the meat was sweet and soft like it should be. Not dry and briny like a lot of places serve. It is hard to find crab of this quality in most places.  Overall though, don't get this dish if you are really hungry, it is not a lot food for most people, I would say split this as an appetizer. (i don't remember the price)

Cioppino (3.5 stars) - I should start by saying that I this is a dish that I always compare to the best cioppino i've ever had which is at Sotto Mare in San Francisco. This dish was good in terms of quantity and seafood quality. The pasta was also cooked perfectly.  But I felt the dish was a little watery over all, I prefer to have it be a little thicker.  The taste also wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped. This dish was just ""ok"" for me, I don't think I would order it in the future. The cost was $34 i think or maybe $32?


Overall, I really like this restaurant.  I have added it to my must eat at again list the next time I am in Vegas.  If you are looking for somewhere to eat away from the strip I strongly recommend this place, and if they have the Osso Buco get that!!!  I am basing my 5/5 rating mostly on the Osso Buco that I ordered as well as the service.

My hubby was jonesing for some pasta, I thought this would be perfect! The pics and reviews on Yelp were favorable, so I thought.. So, I may have had an extensive order, but the hostess repeated everything correctly, so I thought we'd be good. I ordered two appetizers, garlic bread and crab cakes. One fettuccine Alfredo, lobster ravioli, veal Parmesan, and baked ziti.. first of all, we immediately took everything out of the bag upon our return home to find that our $20 crab cake app was missing.. I called the restaurant and the gal (Stephanie) apologized. I'm sorry, but a simple sorry doesn't cut it. I told her we'd be right back to pick it up.. My husband went inside after driving all the way back and she didn't offer anything for her mistake, not even an apology to him. He mentioned having to drive another almost 10 mile round trip back and she said he could get a free crab cake next time we dine in. Hmmmm thanks. My husband tipped this girl to simply place our food in a bag, but that couldn't even be done correctly.. So, 15-20 minutes later we get back to the house... all of the dinners are basically lukewarm by now. The garlic bread was inedible. I tried one piece and practically broke my tooth it was so overdone. The lobster ravioli was ok..it was packed kinda weird...the meat was cold and separate from the ravioli and sauce..it was also very fishy. The veal parm was pretty good, I'll give be them that.. the fettuccine Alfredo was not great..it was basically buttery noodles, not an Alfredo by any means... the baked ziti was probably the most basic yet decent dish we ordered.

4786845,2015-05-05,1,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Excellent meal for our anniversary. I would describe Mastrioni's as an upscale version of your typical family Italian joint. They have typical preparations like piccata and marsala with higher end ingredients like veal, salmon and seabass. They have classics like pasta and meatballs and alfredo so if you want the classics they'll have something you can sink your teeth into.

That said they have a very nice contemporary and comfortable restaurant. The night we were there we saw prom goers dressed in tuxedos and dresses as well as the well healed and well dressed crowd of Summerlin. You would feel comfortable there in slacks and a button down shirt or even nice jeans. You may feel self conscious in golf shorts and a t-shirt.

The food was tasty and there was plenty of it. We shared the crab cakes which came out in a pair and could have been an entree they were so big. They had a nice balance of lump crab and not a lot of filler. 

My wife had the shrimp and scallop penne with vodka sauce. That's a creamy tomato based sauce. She loved the fact that they had taken the tail off of the shrimp. Both of us shake our heads at shrimp tail shells. Take them off restaurant people!

I had a side of fettuccine alfredo and my main course was veal marsala. The veal was tender and came in a nice sauce that wasn't too thick. There were four  large cutlets and the typical mushrooms. The alfredo was creamy and decadent with shards of fresh parmesan on top. It was well seasoned and just what I was craving.

Unlike a lot of casual Italian restaurants, Mastrioni's has a nice wine list. There are plenty of wine by the glass choices and prices are more reasonable then the strip so drink up.

We were so full we passed on desserts, but a few chocolaty gooey things went by that we might need to try on another visit!",Tx9YmzkGh2F-VT_c_Xcm2w,0,0,4,6865hpq4uWD4A6jMKMV_jQ

The service was excellent and so was the food. The restaurant itself is nice with very modern decor. I wasn't crazy thrilled about the music. It was very ""elevator type"". The jazzy kind that puts you right to sleep. 

Other than that, our waiter was super attentive. A bit eccentric, but was very on top of his tables. 

We had:
Caesar salad. It was good, but it was pretty overpriced for how small it was. It was the size of a small side salad for $12. 
The crab cocktail. Again, it was overpriced for how little of crab you get. It's maybe 1-2 full snow crab legs for $21. That's just silliness. 

For the entrees - oddly enough, they're decently priced. 
The Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Penne - very yummy. Would recommend on angel hair pasta. 
Sea Bass Picatta - Mother, this was good. The Seabass just melts in your mouth...better than chocolate. I love any white fish with a good citrus butter sauce. So freaking excellent.

Veal Parmagiana ($16): Baked Breaded Veal Scaloppini, Marinara & Mozzarella.  This was good, with thinly sliced veal and lots of flavor in the baked cheese.  Recommended!

Penne Marinara was my side choice with entree. The pasta was under-cooked, and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. I'd choose the steamed veggies or sauteed spinach next time.  Skip this too.

My favorite dish had to be the lobster ravioli... it was smothered in a delicious white cream sauce and filled with succulent lobster chunks!

I also loved the grilled sea bass... the toasty grilled flavor was slight but what stood out the most was the tender flakiness of the fish.  Perfection.  The accompanying bed of sautéed spinach tasted wonderful with a squeeze of lemon juice.

Clam linguine was alright-- the pasta was al dente, and the sauce was quite light.  The clams were of a generous size, and it was quite convenient having the small seafood fork to remove the meat from the shell.

The crab cakes were a bit dry.  Perhaps they deep fried it for too long?  It wasn't moist.

Also loved the tomato bisque-- it was served very hot, and stayed hot for awhile!  The creaminess of the soup balanced out the acidic tomato taste.  Very good combination.  

Expect the seafood entrees to run around $30-35.  The appetizers run anywhere from $8-15.

We were here for quite awhile... and I noticed that the longer we took to eat, the slower the service got LOL.

Ok, joking aside, I truly believe first impressions are important but don't tell the whole story.  This is one of those times. So here we go.  

Walking up to this small strip mall storefront, I was wondering what I was getting myself into but my daughter insisted we eat close to Golden Spoon Yogurt so we could get a good desert.  So in we go.  The dark room reminded me of the Godfather so I started to get the Italian feel. ""Cenare""

Being from back east, the first lesson I learned about Italian Restaurants is you can tell a good restaurant by the bread they serve you.  I will admit the west coast doesn't always follow that rule, maybe because few restaurants have the old brick ovens but I was disappointed in the bread served. You could get better bread at Vons. 

My next impression, was the menu.  Everything looked good and the standard Italian fare (veal parmagiani, Pastas, etc) was broadened by seafood dishes.  The prices were much higher than I would expect from a strip mall store much to my disappointment.  (see below for part of the reason why).

 I was here with my daughter and she ordered the Kids portion of the Penne Marinara.  I opted for spaghetti and meatballs as I didn't want to break the wallet and was craving comfort foods.  The specials sounded great (Lobster Ravioli and Seafood Risotto) but I went with the standard. After all, if an Italian place can't do Spaghetti and Meatballs right, well the rest of the dishes might as well be frozen dinners. 

The penne was good, The kids sauce not too spicy but, and here is the pricing issue, the kids portion was enough for an adult.  The adult portion was huge.  The meatballs themselves looked like the Bull won. (Old off color joke, you can send me a private message if you don't get it.) Lets just say they were huge.  They were surprisingly light and flavorful if on the spicy side.  When I make meatballs or eat at some other restaurants, the meatballs are often too dense. These were perfect.  The Spaghetti on the other hand tasted a little overcooked and the sauce, although flavored with spiciness, lacked the garlic I hoped for and was a bit watery.  I usually finish my food but I was able to bring home one of the two meatballs and half the spaghetti and my daughter brought home more than 1/2 her meal.

The service here made this place stand out.  Our waiter was polite, informative about the specials, and attentive.  My drink never sat for more than a minute without him offering to refill the Coke or my daughter's lemonade. In fact, the busboy and another waiter also took time to make sure I was fine on the drinks.  I drink fast so that was a plus.  They brought us butter for the bread on request (otherwise you just get olive oil and balsamic). They also told us about deserts without trying to push them on us.

Overall, except for the price and the dichotomy between spicy and watery sauce, I ended up impressed.  If I could change one thing, I would make the portions 1/2 the size and cut the price by $5.00 but hey, they must do ok to maintain those prices in such a low traffic area.

Make sure to get red and highly recommend the hottest they can make it. Its not overly spicy and it does not cancel out the flavors. 

Also make sure to get an order of their cream puffs they are amazing. Great menu, atmosphere, and service. Highly recommend it!",VaLjgsupVctTCm86mfxd0Q,2,1,5,wDVsxIw0oI2wp7xVofkgAA

Decided to go on a whim for my Mother's birthday after she asked for ""hole in the wall"" Italian. Well, there's nothing ""hole in the wall"" about Mastrioni's... it's a classy little joint in a non-descript strip mall on Hualapai. We have a two year old, which is the main reason we haven't been here sooner since it's not really a ""kid-friendly"" spot,  but I figured a Wednesday night would probably be slow and safe. Not so much. By 7 o'clock this place was jam packed! Thankfully, the little criminal behaved wonderfully and we got to enjoy one of the better Italian dinners we've had in a long time. We had calamari and crab cakes for appetizers, calamari was good but the crab cakes were excellent. Mom had the bone in rib-eye, hubs had the seafood linguine and I had linguine and clams. This is your tried and true Italian, better than probably any other I've had in Vegas and would rival any of my favorite spots in California. I'd say it's more like $$$, but they are very generous with the portions/seafood. Dessert was excellent as well and service was on point. We will definitely be back and will probably become our new date night spot.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,1,0,5,b-JvsgnKMjHnDBHEQtdlBg

5802237,2015-01-08,0,HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A,"Meh, not 5-star dining. It's Italian food with a touch of fancy. Nothing on the menu seems to vary off the Italian traditionals. It would have been nice to see a touch of innovation and use of more varied ingredients. 

The service was subpar. Our server was what my wife called ""abrupt"". He seemed to come and go very rapidly without actually seeming to care about our dining experience. I got a beer and the chilled glass that came with it smelled (and made my beer taste) like bleach, so I requested a new one. The server poured a little bit in then basically slammed them on the table as he was already mid-stride to do something else. The second glass was similar so I drank out of the bottle after the initial bleachy-tasting pour was consumed. The waiter saw me sniffing at my glass again and just came by and collected the glass and took it away - not even asking if I had a repeat experience (which I did). 

The wife got the Seabass PIcatta...it was an okay size piece and it was cooked well. The picatta sauce (lemon and capers) was entirely too lemony. Would not recommend the picatta.I wouldn't call it a $36 dollar dish either. 

I heard Osso Bucco was one of the specials and I can never turn that down. It came out looking great atop fettuccini with a good sauce. The Osso Bucco itself was good but could have used a little more braising to make it more tender as the meat was a little firm. Overall it was below average comparatively. I was a bit surprised when I got the bill and it was $42.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,8,1,3,EJhuk68OzyL7fH7KOBvncA

It had been over a couple years since I had ordered pasta, and on this particular day, I was really craving fetucinne alfredo. 

The pasta was underwhelming for me. It lacked flavor, so I had to season it myself. And I guess it is super simple. For the price, I wasn't too stoked. 

I think the salad I had was quite good...loved the dressing. 
I'm not sure I'd be back here though.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,1,3,1NxtucQY1hw18Z3p6zFYig

Service itself was fast and efficient. Almost to the point we felt rushed because they are busy and we aren't ordering a 3+ course meal. They did a great job getting us bread and water refills. 

It is nice enough to do for a special dinner date night where money is no object but if it comes down to tasty expensive food to splurge on, I would go back to Lotus of Siam.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,1,0,2,wZT7ve0yDXA_Huwqz9GZPA

Despite arriving before the crowd we were a little disappointed to get very little attention there at first. Drinks, menus and bread were slow to come.  Once we got the attention of our waiter it was still slow to get appetizers and entrees ordered but we were happy to indulge in bread as we waited.

Our entire table ordered fish dishes. I went with the halibut piccata and we shared the bruschetta as an appetizer. The bruschetta had a huge amount of tomato. It was delicious. The fish was well prepared. I enjoyed everything about my meal.
