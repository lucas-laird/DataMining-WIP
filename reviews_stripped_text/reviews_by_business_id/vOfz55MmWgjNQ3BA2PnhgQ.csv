Servers were fast and efficient, but very busy most of the time so you'd need to catch their attention. Cafe's furnishings are dated but in the middle of the night, you'd wouldn't really care. Menu is huge, i've yet to try anything else. Came here twice in a week to have their steak and eggs. Well cooked steak (medium), sunny side up eggs with potato hash.

They have the $5 deal from 10pm-5am I think, usually seating is always available too! Service is fast and friendly. If you come here and don't get the steak and eggs, you should just stop coming to vegas. I always get the medium rare steaks with over-easy eggs, and sometimes one plate isn't even enough... #drool lol

The few times I've driven here, parking has always been available, but if you come here in a Taxi, getting one to go back to your hotel is harder. Just go to the front desk and have the worker call you a taxi, cause they rarely wait at Tuscany lol

165934,2012-05-25,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"Ok I don't want to get into too much detail, but look up the symptoms for Salmonella poisoning, both my friend and I had all of the symptoms within 36 hours of eating chicken at this place.  More egregious, was the service.

First, we decided to try to expand out lunch options.  There was a $10 off coupon in the local paper and the place is located near UNLV where we both work.  When we got there and were seated, we were optimistic when we saw the variety of options on the menu, we were confident that we had found a new lunch spot.

Sooooo at 12:05 we still hadn't receive my chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potatoes waffle fries or my friend's grilled chicken salad.  Nor had we seen the waitress or bus boy to refresh our drinks, that was until they walked into the room from some obscure place together after a half hour. . .We flagged them both down asked for drink refills twice and to please check on our meals as we were on our lunch hour.

Out came my meal with waffle fries that were not even warm to the touch. I sent them back and ate half of my wrap.  It had kind of an odd taste but I attribute it to strong feta cheese.

My friend asked for no dressing with her salad but asked for vinegar . . . The waitress brought her a bottle with about a quarter inch of brown liquid in it and said this is vinegar.  It wasn't.  It was soy sauce, so that went back. . .

We asked to talk to the manager; we had to ask four people to speak to the manager until he finally begrudgingly came over.  He began with ""You are already unhappy so there is nothing I can say to make it better""  That is it. . .He would not even take care of the worse meal I have ever eaten in my life. . .which lead to 3 days of major illness.

The fact they have breakfast 24 hrs/day earns them 3 stars right off the bat.  The fact that the breakfast was tasty and excellent gives them another star.

I tried their sausage Benedict with grits, it came with a biscuit and gravy and some hash browns.  Firstly, very large portion, you can't leave hungry.  I wasn't too big on the grits but the rest was so tasty I wish I had room for more.

And the coffee?  Well this is the USA....so it was excellent.  Rich, strong and tasty, what a treat from the Canadian brown water we are subjected to.  Maybe this is why I travel the US so frequently, I love the quality of food.

And the prices...unbelievable.  Starting at $3.99 for endless pancakes.

My meal with coffee came to $10.00.

301392,2013-01-08,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"The lady at my hotel gave Marilyn's a good recommendation for dinner. So I checked the reviews at yelp which were also good. Unfortunately it was not good at all.

The restaurant is in the back of the Tuscany Casino. It looks nice, sort of like an upscale coffee shop. The server was a little slow to take my order, which was surprising since there were only two people in his section at the time. I ordered the chicken parmesan, which came with garlic toast and spaghetti; no other sides. The wait for the food seemed a little long; again surprising since the crowd wasn't very big. 

The meal was a huge disappointment. I never thought there could be too much cheese on Chicken Parmesan but boy was I wrong. It was completely smothered in goopy greasy mozz. The chicken was obviously a frozen reheat. The pasta was overcooked and soggy (honestly I'm usually okay with overcooked pasta, but not soggy). The sauce was the worst; it definitely tasted canned, almost Chef Boyardee-ish. Yuck!! The only positive was the dinner rolls that were brought to me half way through the meal. The service throughout the meal remained mediocre.

I was tempted to give them a one star... but to be honest, most of the people around me were ordering the prime rib (which was on special) or breakfast items. The prime rib with the salad and baked potato looked delicious and everyone seemed to be enjoying their breakfasts. And as you can see there is a multitude of positive reviews here at Yelp.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and TWO STARS.

Update: Not sure why, but I went back for breakfast a few days later.  The breakfast wasn't bad.  Again, the place was busy and everybody seemed to be very happy with their meals.  So, maybe I was just unlucky with the Chicken Parm.  However, the two stars still stands.",elqme6NdbZ4XxhuTvkxp5Q,1,0,2,5IwOWs6JNFUY3ekLtD5e5g

The eggs, hash browns, and toast were average noting spectacular on par with a Denny's or Norms.

427787,2014-12-04,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"Okay, this is definitely a hard place to avoid. I went back after 2 weeks since the 'no service' experience and sad face review. This time I made sure to request to be seated in my top choices of servers' area (I know them by name since I go there a lot). What I conclude is that  one time was a fluke but if it was my first experience I would've never gone back.  Anyway, all is good after I make the precaution of where to sit. 

Food: as great as usual so here's a general list of things that I have ordered before.

Coffee: The most important thing during breakfast - awesome. I'm not sure where they get the beans but IMO, it's better than Einstein's Bagels selection and it's better then Egg Works. Not that the other 2 is bad, I just like this coffee more.

Steak and Egg breakfast special: One of the best choice you can ask for if you are a steak fan. Every time I have ordered it it's made to perfection of the medium rare. The steak is lightly seasons so some people may want to add more. I've never been a fan of hash brown but this place makes it good. You get a choice of pancakes or toast.

Marilyn Starter: No way a person can get it wrong. Generic breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon and pancakes. Ordered it a few times but only once that they over did the salt.

Grits - just right consistency. Great with butter and adding a bit of salt. 

Country Fried Steak: First time having CFS. Steak was moist and the batter was good. Would recommend.

Quiche: I had one with ham, pepper and onions and it came with a fruit cup. Probably the only thing I have ever gotten that I didn't really like. I was not a fan of the crust.

Sweet Potato Waffle Fries: A-mazing! Partial bias because by default I love anything with sweet potato. Still awesome to try.

Biscuits and gravy: Was a bit cold when I got the plate. Gravy is not bad but I think it would be better if it had some bits of sausages in there or just something else to add on the mushy texture.

Country Sausage Lovers Bowl: Aside from food coma in the middle of eating i. it's really good. Heaviest meal I've ever gotten from here. For $9 it fed me for 2 meals. 

Grilled Chicken & Eggs: Usually a gamble when it comes to chicken but the chef had chicken breast moist and tender and lightly seasoned.

We said yes, and he brought the bucket, my extra lemon and extra napkins before we even ordered it. Dinner was served promptly and he kept the crab legs coming, even asking if I wanted more just before I was finished with first order so second order would be there right as I was done. (So we wouldn't have to wait, since they were so busy). John is one of the best servers in the bunch. We have been there numerous times at different days and times since we are locals, and John ALWAYS knows what we are drinking and usually has some idea of what we are going to want to eat. He makes sure our drinks are always full, and if the bussers are busy he even clears the table so we don't have a bunch of plates piling up.

I showed her the hair and she did not apologize but asked if I wanted something else (obviously I said no) and she walked away. Me and my friend sat there for 15 mins and decided to just leave. We walked outside and security came after us. I explained what happen and they said I had to speak with the manager. When we asked if the manager could come outside so it wouldn't cause us an embarrassing scene they threaten to call the police repeatedly. We went back inside. The manager was not waiting for us. It was the waitress with our check telling me that we walked out on our bill and I put my own hair into my food.  I told her my plate was barely touched. My hair is very long and black and my friends hair is very curly long and brown. The hair is pretty short, it was found under my steak and it had the root on it. This is why I was sure it was not my own hair. After accusing me the waitress walked away and I had to ASK a manager be called. I ASKED the cashier to call the police since my food was tampered with but he stated they could not call the police we would have to (after we were threaten several times that they would call on us). The manager arrived and wasn't told that a hair was in my food or that I notified two people before we left. He had to go find the waitress and confirm that information. He returned and told me no one in the back has long hair. At that point I asked him to look at the plate with the hair on it. He immediately looked at the hair and the food that was completely untouched and apologized and told us the bill is covered. We demanded security stop following us. It was a horrible experience. The customer service was terrible. If they sent security after us then a manager should have been notified, if a guest complains a hair is in the food a manager should be notified.

I finished off with the turtle cheesecake but they had a whole tray with all different types of things to try. 

The Marilyn's starter breakfast was a great deal and very tasty. I loved the sausage links and the pancakes the most


To finish off on our last night here on a Wednesday they had a Steak and lobster special for 13.99!!! Yes you ready that right 13.99.... the cheapest I've ever seen and it was the perfect amount of food.

Next time you find yourself in Vegas and awake after midnight, be sure to pay Marilyn's a visit solely for this special! This is clearly a blessing to late night partiers and midnight snackers alike. It was so great to enjoy a hearty sit down breakfast at 4 am after not having time to eat a proper meal all day. It's slightly off the beaten path of the Strip, but not too far to be inconvenient.

The food itself was average at best, but it was so cheap that it didn't really matter to me. If you care about the quality, then maybe you're better off going elsewhere. My steak had a lot of gristle on it that I had to cut off. The other elements (eggs, hash browns, toast) are hard to mess up so those were fine. I think the quality is comparable to normal diner food. My friend ordered a basket of calamari and it was not good, but then why would you get calamari at a diner? 

Service was polite and quick given the hour. This is a great spot for late night comfort food, good and simple.

Example: A charcoal-grilled 8oz chopped steak in thick mushroom gravy, side, bread and salad for about $9 out-the-door before tip. This is a Best Of Las Vegas pick for casino coffee shop - and it's well earned !!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Service was somewhat confused and slow, but the six-buck steak & eggs graveyard deal more than made up for it.

I arrived at Tuscany Suites & Marilyn's Coffee Shop around 4:40am, then waited almost ten minutes at the register, staring at a dining venue devoid of any customers or staff. Then I ended up going into the kitchen to find someone. I was told I that Marilyn's was actually next door. That wasn't exactly true. What's next door is the property's 24-hour ""Pub365"" VP bar (and restaurant).

I was told at the Pub that Marilyn's graveyard shift was shuttered due to a monthly deep-clean of the kitchen. I am not buying that either. You are telling me there's a separate kitchen for the pub that shares a wall with the coffee shop? And why are the lights up in the coffee shop with no ""Closed"" sign or rope-off? My bet? The staff just wanted to vacant the coffee shop area (without getting caught) ... to save themselves some work keeping the morning shift set-up in place, since the VP Bar next door is open all-night no-matter.

Anyway, just after my drink was brought to me at my Pub365 table, I was asked to move BACK to Marilyn's because ""the deep-clean"" was done at 5am. Now I am wondering if I'm even going to GET the graveyard deal! When I get to my new booth in Marilyn's, there's some confusion as to whether my order had even been taken. We cleared that up ... and cleared up that my graveyard deal was going to cash in. Then it took well over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Even though there were only two other table-tops working.

Any-who, there's the service. Now about the food. For a $6 steggs deal, this cut of meat was pretty durn good. Now we know this isn't going to be the Golden Steer or Steve Wynn's SW Steakhouse going in. But for this price, it was a pretty nice cut of steak. I've certainly seen far worse graveyard meat ... and at a buck or two or three more. The eggs were done well, the hash browns could have been a bit more crispy. But, again, for six smackers this deal was a real bargain. And the plates heading for the other table-tops looked pretty durn tempting as well.

And my wait comped me the beverage, in consideration of the seating fiasco. Thanks, dude!

OK, it's a mid-market coffee shop, not going with five-stars. And I'll dish out an additional one-star ding, not for the service & seating confusion - the food quality & the gratis beverage balanced that out - but for the ambient music. 'Ambient' is probably not the right word as much as the word 'blaring.' And what was blaring was mostly 1970s hard-grinding metal rock. During my 5:30am dining experience I was enchanted, in no uncertain decibels, by 'Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo' (Rick Derringer, 1973), 'Stay With Me' (Rod Stewart, 1971), 'Black Magic Woman' (Santana, 1970) and Janis Joplin wailing-out 'Me & Bobby McGee' (1970). I am presuming management has concluded this is the ambiance required to properly incentivize its target slot players of-age to drop coin. I totally get that; business-is-business. But let's tamp it down a bit in the restaurant at 5:30am, OK? 

Forgiving the service/seating samba ... and the rowdy head-banger music ... at 3am-5am, this spot is actually a pretty decent graveyard deal option, for sure. I'd would have much rather eaten what Marilyn's dished than what I would have gotten at Blueberry Hill for twice the price. And at The Peppermill, I would have easily dropped a twenty. And while The Peppermill is certainly a great spot for middle-of-the-night people-watching and for over-the-top, retina-numbing décor, it seems to me the quality of product at Peppermill has slipped in recent years, at least when compared to its price-point.

CONCLUSIONS: Tuscany already offers a nicely-appointed, vintage-Vegas-vibe lounge. Now I've discovered its coffee shop. So if I am looking again in this time frame ... and I am looking in this price-point ... and I am in the general area, I'll likely swing through Marilyn's again. 

Especially if I am trolling in the middle of the morning ... still lookin' for that blue jean baby queen. Prettiest girl I ever seen. See her shake on the movie screen. Rock on.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,0,0,5,xi7_k-Ce2uADPeVeXPaXSg

Who cares if the steak is not top cut, it's SIX bucks. Probably the best $6 dollars you will spend in Vegas. It's very close to the strip, I think only one or two blocks away from Las Vegas Blvd. The steak and eggs comes with two eggs, hash browns (ask for extra crispy), and not 1, 2, or 3.. but 4 pieces of toast. Get the sourdough, slab some butter and strawberry jam.. so freaking food. (they put butter on it already, but if you want more butter). The servers are amazing and hospitable, even though they probably see a bajillion drunk people every night. The only thing is that sometime it takes a while for the food to come out.

 I made the regretful choice of picking dinner (I really love breakfast food). I opted for chicken cordon bleu with a side of mac and cheese and broccoli. I had my doubts about ordering the chicken cordon bleu and I really should have stayed away  and stuck with breakfast. I'm 85% sure my entree was fried along side my friend's chicken tenders. I could hold the chicken breast in my hand and it wouldn't fall apart. The mac n cheese wasn't anything special and the broccoli was standard. 

Despite an uneventful dinner, we still ordered dessert. We knew what we were getting into defrosted dessert pies. They were about $5 each and didn't taste the price. The dessert was $3 less than the entree.

As a person with 26 years of management experience in all manner of retail and restaurant, I can tell you that this place is falling apart and has lost its bearings at ALL levels.  The food comes out cold and with the attitude of ""I have been under a heat lamp for 7 hours, dear God please help me!""

Vanilla Milkshake that has all the right ingredients - milk, ice cream - but they aren't mixed up right, so you basically have 2 balls of ice cream floating in milk.  Nice try to deconstruct that dish my friends!  Pancakes were ok.  Hashbrowns were ok - ketchup can cover up all manner of sin.  My son ordered that awesome ""milk float"" and it took over an hour to finally get the thing.  He said, ""Dad it doesn't taste good, but I am SO thirsty!"" and promptly drank it.  I tried it.  Yep, ice cream in milk without being mixed.  We saw our waitress whenever she wasn't helping the other three hundred guests.  The drink guy understood a few words.  He made it with the water a couple of times.  Then we asked for separate checks and the waitress told us we could pay separately at the counter.  Then we were told they don't do that.  That would be ten times were couldn't do something.  The customer is always wrong at Marilyn's.  After a long discussion and working our way up the chain of command the manager, the wonderfully non-delightful Dana gave up arguing with us and told us flatly ""we will not separate your checks, just pay.""

Steak is juicy and a good portion. It's not your fancy steakhouse steak but it'll do at 3 a.m. when you're starving.

Tip: Arrive 15 minutes before 11:00 AM so you can get seated and order their steak and eggs special.

Anyways, as for overall experience it was great. I came with a larger group of 9 people so we expected a long wait but only waited maybe about 10 - 15 minutes before getting seated. No time was wasted and our orders came out relatively quick. It took about 35 - 40 minutes between getting seated til our orders arrived mostly because this place was packed. After finally digging it, I can totally see why. The food definitely is reminiscent of an old school diner, quality frugal eats. 

I, myself, ordered the country fried steak and eggs. First time trying a country fried steak so this was a new experience but impressions were good. The steak was crispy like fried chicken with a mellow steak flavor when you bite in. Not too oily but it was also masked with their house gravy so difficult to tell. The gravy did help to cut the fattiness of the fried oil. Eggs were okay, not overly cooked nor undercooked. Would have hoped it to be a little less cooked. Seemed it was waiting to be served for a while as it was a bit drier. 

All things considered though, the food was good and definitely met my expectations. Almost all their dishes could feed two people. For the price, the food satisfied my needs but if I were to nitpick the food could have been brought out when it was hot. Fried foods aren't as great once they cool down in my opinion. Additionally, their hash browns were not thoroughly cooked. It was watery and made the toast a little soggy. 

All in all, Marilyn's is a solid choice for breakfast. The quality of the food is average and service was above average. The price and quantity makes the meal a solid four stars though.",Mi4YyqTJrElfO0DKaM17YQ,0,0,4,MU2zi6Fue4vuk4bWIS-kBg

I will suggest Sear's Fine Foods in Union Square as an alternative.  I think their breakfast food is comparable - and there's typically no wait.

My whole family is a huge fan of the midnight special.  Steak and eggs, $4.99, and the quality can't be beat!  We stop in every time we come to Vegas.

My kid is a night owl and even if we are dragging on our first night in Vegas, she'll ask us to stay up and go.  And we wind up happy about it every time!  On our last trip, two years ago, the steak was good.  Now it's a dollar more for the special, and the steak is great!

And the rest.  This restaurant can actually deliver an egg over easy.  It's perfect every time.  The toast, buttery and filling.  Hash browns, nice and tasty, well cooked and not overdone.

You need to know what's on at what time when you come in.  The $4.99 special is midnight to 5 AM, but a regular breakfast special for $7.99 is available mornings.  Or fill up on pancakes for...memory is a bit dim but I think it's $3.99 around the clock.

Be sure to tip your waiter on something like what the actual price would be.  Service is good and regular, ours always keep our drinks filled.

Very very impressed with the remodeling of Marilyn's Cafe! 

I only came here for the extremely inexpensive steak and eggs and they were significantly tastier and cheaper than The Steakhouse at Bill's. The steak was cooked well with larger portions compared to Bill's, hash was delicious, and the best part was that Marilyn's had A1 sauce (YESSS!!). A cheaper quality steak without A1 sauce is just not amazing to me. 

I truly believe that Marilyn's renovation did nothing but benefit them. The food quality has improved leaps and bounds and the dining area is spacious enough for late night dining and extremely clean. 

Also, I went here three times in the 9 days I was in Las Vegas during this past summer and I always had the same waiter. I wish I remembered his name because he was such a sweetheart. He was peppy at three in the morning and was extremely polite. He made the experience even better!

I am confident enough to brush off my prior statements of the Steak and Eggs at Bill's being better than Tuscany. Fellow Yelpers, Marilyn's Cafe for Steak and Eggs is the way to go! You wont regret it!",7Pyy2_l6c-Pydske66vjRQ,2,1,4,JnqBEh9sPQF2yEE9LacJCQ

I was in Lost Wages, err Las Vegas for 2016 CES and staying next door at the Fortune Hotel. FYI, don't stay there (I will detail that experience later).

I went to Marilyn's for breakfast the first day of CES, Wednesday, 6 January. I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs with real shredded hash browns and my friend got the pork chop and eggs. We shared and the hostess had recommended the latter as one of her favourites. Good choice! The chicken fried steak was lightly breaded and the chicken so tender; the pork chops were so tender you could cut them with a stick pen. I thought the coffee was excellent but my friend thought it was average. José and Miriam took care of us this meal (one of 4 trips in 4 days). Excellent service with excellent food!

Next trips, my friend and I got the Steak and eggs which are $5.99 after midnight and $8.99 between 0600 and 1100. Great steak! Emilia and German took care of us and again, excellent service.

These meals also come with hash browns AND your choice of toast and jams.

Because of this restaurant, next trip we will be staying at the Tuscany which houses this restaurant.

First of all, you need to walk through a large casino area to get to the cafe. The cigarette smell was not a good way to start breakfast.

The seating area is okay, but pretty run-down. Our booth was comfortable though. The waitress was friendly enough.

Everything on the menu is extremely affordable, especially considering it's Las Vegas. The unlimited pancakes option was pretty great and only $4. The pancakes were perfectly soft and fluffy. The french toast I ordered was not so good: too eggy and not enough flavor. Ended up just sharing the pancakes.

You pay at the register, which was good considering we were in a rush. Total for four people was less than $30.

The steak is definitely no Prime cut Ribeye but what do you expect? I ordered medium-rare. One of the steaks was right on but the second one was well-done.

She made me come and all I remember is the old people with walkers blocking my way and the place looked old and terrible. Since then that's how I knew Tuscany looks like. So with all the good reviews about Marilyn's Cafe I really pictured an old hole in the wall Cafe. 
I was in the area and starving so I thought let's try it here. 
The casino looks great. It's remodeled since I've been here and for a minute I thought I'm at the wrong place. 
Marilyn's Cafe is very nice. I didn't expect servers with ties. Anyways,  I ordered the T-bone dinner ($16.99) and added half a Caesar salad ($2.99). It was pretty good. The meat wasn't bad at all. 
I got tiramisu for dessert and it was excellent.

2462744,2018-04-16,2,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"This is your run of the mill Vegas cafe, but my review today will be based on their Friday offerings. Because of Friday, it's Friyay, and that's because you can get Cr-cr-craaaazy with their all you can eat CRAB!

Currently priced at $23.99 it includes two side dishes (mashed/baked/french fry potatoes, mac n cheese, fruit, veggies, etc). It's actually an impressive list of side items. Frankly, if you're there for the crab, like me, they just get in the way. My absolute favorite thing about their all you can eat crab is that it's served to you. That's right. NO BUFFET LINE!!! How awesome is that? They are steam crab legs, so buyer beware. In my opinion, they are outstanding. Much meatier than the Station Casino offerings, they are served with a little cut in the shell in them making them easy to break via hand. Almost all of them are juicy and not overcooked, which often happens at buffets. They even give you butter with a little candle under it doesn't harden. They must know that guys like me are in it for the long haul.

Oh yeah, and you always get complimentary dinner rolls and corn bread. These are really good too - the dinner rolls are always warm and fresh. The corn bread is surprisingly good, sweet, very much like my Mom's corn bread. Make sure to ask for it!

The one negative is that it can occasionally take a little while to get your crab refills. Because it's not a buffet line you have servers running around like crazy trying to keep up. They do the best they can, but often it' takes a good 4-5 minutes to get some additional crab. On a non-crab night their service is spot on, but I definitely give them some leeway given the demand they have on Friday nights. 

In my opinion, this is up there with the M buffet for best all-care-to-eat Crabbing, if not a slight notch above because of price point. 

Speaking of run-of-the-mill cafe's, they're kind of a thing of the past. I love the feel of older Vegas diners. Sadly they are all starting to disappear. There is something nostalgic about eating from a diner that opened in the 60's or 70's at 2am on a Thursday night.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,1,1,5,9Xqta4xVDdLRY6FGD7vItw

The to-go section was a very short wait and the waiters were really polite and helpful.

We ordered gravy fries which tastes better than it sounds. They gave us way more than what $3 worth of fries should be worth and successfully sent my boyfriend into the food coma he wanted.

This time we had a terribly embarrassing experience. After we finished eating, and while we were collecting cash from everyone(they don't split checks), security was sent by our table and asked if we were enjoying our meal. First off, all the food was gone and table was cleaned. So we thought that was weird. We paid our bill ($256.xx) and proceeded to leave, when Daniel the manager and security stopped my husband and my sis-n-laws and asked who was going to pay the bill?!! When my husband said the bill is paid, he told him ""I don't think it is?"" And proceeded to say my husband fit the description of someone who walked out on the bill. He then lied and said that security must of seen something on surveillance that made them come over. We later found out from the security manager that Daniel called security before we were even done with our meal! When confronted, Daniel was very condescending and rude and just kept saying ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" Anyway, we got our money back and won't be going back there.

Egg white omelette with thinly sliced turkey and an avocado verde sauce. My boyfriend had the Belgium waffle topped with cinnamon apples. My best friend had two chocolate chip/strawberry pancakes with a side of hash browns. My omelette lacked so much flavor and the turkey was painfully dry. The avocado verde sauce was DECENT but, in all honesty, I can do a better job in my own kitchen. My boyfriends waffle wasn't any better. I think he would've been happier with a stack of Eggos. And my best friend described her pancakes as ""no better than iHop."" Not to mention, her hash browns were drenched in oil. Our meal was not worth the price. I would have rather bought groceries and cooked breakfast on my own in my hotel room. 

The ONE upside, (which is why I had to give two stars instead of one), is that they will bring you complimentary bread upon request. The corn bread is to die for and the dinner rolls are delicious as well.

I had the chicken finger dinner because I too indulge in my childish desires from time to time. They were standard: somewhat dry, very fried, and not something you can quite eat without the assistance of sauces to lessen the scratching of the overly brittled flesh scraping at the inside of your esophagus. 
Mac and cheese was dry as well, mushy, and probably has been sitting under the salamander most of today. I suspect it was gingerly microwaved before it brought to us. 
Fries: probably the best thing. Crispy enough, well seasoned (which the mac and cheese cannot equally boast), and quick to disappear off of the surface of my plate.
Finally dessert: I had the oreo creme cake and my lovely companion had a turtle cheesecake. The oreo creme cake had unfortunately long sucked in the very distinct taste of freezer and was likewise quite cloying (especially with the addition of a saccharine chocolate syrup on the plate for 'decoration'). Turtle cheesecake tasted less like freezer. It was the better of the two for sure.

Here's a secret, get your hashbrowns loaded, it's a dollar extra but soooo worth it! They top your hashbrowns with gravy and cheese and onions or something like that...I can never remember since I'm always a little...who are we kidding, I'm DRUNK when I come here!

I love breakfast and there are a million places to eat in Vegas so I looked on yelp for the best breakfast near the strip and this is what I found!

I would compare this to a mom and pop version of Denny's, with better prices. 

I got the ""Big Winner"" which comes with 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast, hash browns AND pancakes..... for $8.99!!!! And this isn't even a special! They have cheaper prices if you come during certain times on weekdays. And the taste was GREAT. We really liked our server John.

The crab legs where delicios and warm/hot, which i love. You get to pick 2 sides. I got green beans and mash potatoes, both were great. 

I'm giving them 4 stars because it took them a little while to bring more crab legs and also for soda refills.

we got into vegas a little after 10pm and before we went too far along into the night of drinks, gambling, and more drinks, we wanted to grab some food. there weren't too many places that were nearby and open late serving decent food, but going to Marilyn's at the Tuscany was a unanimous choice given their steak and eggs special that we ordered right as we got in (which as luck would have it, was right at midnight).

ice tea, medium-well steak, and eggs over-medium, and sourdough toast for $5 and i'm a happy man, ready to burn the midnight oil on our first evening in Sin City.

the service was quick, which i'd imagine is either because a february Vegas trip isn't as crazy and packed as one in the summer, and/or the fact we got there right at 12. the other times when i've decided to stop at Marilyn's at the Tuscany for steak and eggs have been when it was closer to 3am, after a long night out cruising the strip or checking out one of the clubs and the waits (for our parties of 10+) have always been closer to an hour.

satisfying meal for the price. plus you can hit the $5 blackjack tables at the casino when you're done.

We started off with some sweet potato waffle fries. Pretty good. Crispy and plentiful for the 3 of us. But what we came for was what we all ordered. Steak and Eggs for $3.99. Boom! Awesome deal. 2 eggs anyways you want, a petite strip steak that was tender. Not a hockey puck like Bill's Gamblin Hall's Victorian Room's steak and eggs for a $1 more. Oh yeah, it also comes with toast, which I got sourdough, and hash browns. Excellent deal and it hit the spot. 

The German and Starsky got dessert. Looked yummy. Starsky got a huge sundae and the German got some chocolate molten cake.

2861466,2011-12-16,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"I've been here about 3 times, but it seems that each time is less memorable than the previous visit.  It's a good deal for the crab, but in my opinion there are so many options in Vegas that surpass Marilyn's Cafe.

Pros:  
  *  There's an AYCE crab feast for $15.98 per person on Friday nights
  *  the AYCE option comes with 2 side dishes 
  *  Free refills on drinks 
  *  Service was pretty good.  The manager of the restaurant even came by.
  *  Quality of the crab itself was mediocre

Cons:
  *  Outdated ambiance
  *  No refills on your sides
  *  Slow service
  *  Raised the price on the AYCE option (previously $12.99)
  *  It was cold throughout the restaurant.

Overall:
  Since the last time I went here, it seems that they have boosted up the price a bit on the AYCE.  That was the main thing that Marilyn's Cafe had going for them was the crab at a killer price.  Since it's a bit more expensive now (in comparison to before), there are other places throughout the valley that offer AYCE for a little more money (way better quality though and more for your money too).  It also doesn't help that was extremely chilly inside the restaurant.  It made my meal less enjoyable.  I live in the Northwest side of town and it's always a pain to get to Tuscany Suites from home (especially on a Friday night).  I do not think I'll be coming here for their AYCE crab anytime soon.  Perhaps on another night for their regular menu, but I have yet to try that.  I'll definitely update my review once I do though.  From reading other reviews, it seems like they have some other good deals that are worth checking out (such as the Steak and Egss for $3.99... unless they changed the price on that too?)

Tips:
  *  Make sure to check out the menu for all the other days.  Different days = different specials
  *  Bring something warm to wear.  It was very cold in there.
  *  You have to walk out of the restaurant to use the restroom, but its right around the corner.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,1,3,7Piv-08RWbXfKlCEEMzfGQ

What happened? I use to love the AYCE crab dinner here because the crab was so warm and juicy.

First time I got the 12 oz steak with loaded hash browns and potato salad. Potato salad was ok, so were the hash browns. I devoured the steak, I wanted it cooked medium well and it came out just the way I wanted! You can also request bread rolls but they ran out so they gave us corn bread which was delicious. For $12.99 it was a pretty good deal. 

Service was pretty good, the server came by to check on us a few times, refilled our water, gave us extra napkins...

The music and sound of the nearby casino is the major downfall. It's in the ""Tuscany"" and they have pop music on. If that odd mix of genre isn't enough, there is a slot machine that plays western ompa polka music about every 30 seconds and it's louder than the pop music.

PROS:

2.) Big portions perfect for when you have late night drunchies.

3.) They cook your steak just the way you like it & it's perfect every time!

4.) Clean & spacious!

5.) Employees are very friendly! 

6.) Steak & eggs meal comes with toast that's already buttered for you!! 

7.) Hashbrowns comes perfectly brown! You can ask for it to be extra crispy if you like!


CONS:
1.) The service is questionable. The first time I was here the food came really fast but the second time I was here it took a while for the food to come out.

**2016 Yelp 100 LV Challenge #4**

I purely come here for the Steak & Eggs, but time to time we get some biscuits & gravy as well. The place is very old cafe restaraunt style w/ all the condiments layer out on the tables. Every time we have been here.... the service has been pretty damn GOOD. Those who haven't gotten good service based on other reviews.... I don't really see it... or maybe we ALWAYS get lucky w/ an awesome server. On occasion our steaks don't come out the way we want it... but whatever... you get what you pay for. 

They have Steak & Egg special everyday after 12am 

STEAK & EGG SPECIAL $5.99 - for that price I think you get a pretty damn good meal... eggs however you like them.... a big slap of hash browns...  2 pieces of buttered toast, & what I believe may be around a 5oz. Steak that isn't too bad as long as it's not overcooked! 

I would come back all day any day I feel like have a cheap decent meal.... & honestly... wouldn't really care if I got bad service... you are getting McDonald's price for quality food! =]",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,7,4,4,AlcrPiJzVxU8vlmB9dYkqg

I know they're busy but I had to ask three people. 7) overall great price for snow crab legs but the atmosphere had me uncomfortable at times.

The place is clean, well lit, and décor was satisfactory. The service was just right. Only coming back when plates were clearly done or to refill beverages which clearly needed to be filled; and they were friendly about it.

The food was pretty darn good. The $3.95 all day all you can eat pancakes are beyond adequate for that price. The steak and eggs special, while not on the level to make Gordon Ramsay not scream, were very good for the price and you got to pancakes as a side. The steak was a bit thin and had some more fat on it thenI would have liked, but nothing to cry about. The eggs weren't perfect, but having been to Vegas 8 times in 6 years and having 40+ breakfasts, I am yet to find good eggs. So I was not unhappy. I didn't get sick and they looked/tasted like eggs. Little ketchup and Tabassco did wonders (as they usually do).

My group also, took part in the all-you-can eat crab legs on Friday night for $16.95. We took down 100+ legs. None of us were sick or even felt uncomfortable...just full. Again, not the best I have ever had, but really, quality shell fish in Vegas is hard to come-by (I live in CT, good seafood is a staple in my neck of the woods, so I am spoiled...very few places in Vegas come even close to what I experience on the norm).

I will agree with one Yelper down below...BRING YOUR OWN WATER. The water was a bit funky. It may be the local filtration process, I do not know. But after a 'long night in Vegas', water the next morning is clutch. Not from here though.

I would give this 4.5 stars if possible. But I went with 4, because of the Water thing, and the steaks were a 'tad underwhelming' (that may be too harsh, but it is the best I can think of).

No, it is not the most gourmet quality steak you will ever eat, but it's a healthy-sized, juicy cut without tons of fat. The taste is decent, made delicious with lots of BBQ sauce. And when it comes to the drunchies when all you want is a satisfying meal for a low price, it's def a great value. Comes with two eggs cooked as you like, hashbrowns (and they're good!!) and with toast of a bread of your choice - makes for a HUGE meal for the price.

[SERVICE]
I came here around 4AM on a Friday night/Saturday morning with a group of 10 and we were seated immediately. The servers came by to take our drink orders and patiently took our food orders while we tried to figure out what everyone was getting. They also made sure to check on us throughout our meal. Thank you to the servers that were so kind and friendly, it was definitely the best service I've received in a while, and especially at such a weird dining hour.

I ordered the NY strip steak with scrambled eggs, hash brown, and wheat toast. You can't get good steak and eggs at any time of the day for such a great price anywhere else! I ordered my steak medium well and it was cooked perfectly. Very satisfied with my order.

I know many reviewers stated they enjoyed their cheap steak and eggs, but we were neither late enough or early enough for that. So this review is for regular dining.

There is a special every day listed on their board in the front and their website. It was Wednesday, so their special was 4oz of lobster tail with 6 oz of steak and two side items. 

Chicken Parmesan $10.49- My younger cousins both loved it. They each had their own order. No side items but had two slices of garlic bread. They were full from the pasta that the bread was not consumed.

All included two side items.
10oz Prime Rib $13.49-Not bad! I got a coleslaw and hash brown. It came with dipping sauce. Not a bad price at all!
Turkey dinner $8.99- It didn't look appealing to me when I read the description and it wasn't good. The turkey slices were tough.
12oz steak-Dad chose medium rare, didn't try it, but he said it was good.

TIP: Open a membership card to receive their discount booklet. Since 4 of us were able to open a card, we took advantage and did just that. It had a 10% discount of an entree at this cafe (not including specials). No limit per a table.

Good service and food. 18% gratuity was included for our party of 6.

Menu has a lot of different options, but I come here for the steak and eggs deal for breakfast. With an affordable price, well cooked steaks, eggs and hash browns with toast on the side, definitely a great breakfast for anyone. 

They do have other breakfast options to fulfill your cravings, and great daily specials for affordable prices as well. You will definitely find something that suits you. I always enjoy my food when I come here. 

I will say that the wait for your food can be a little while, but I tend to not notice when I'm around really good company. Just keep that in mind if you're not the type to wait for a while when hungry! 

Will definitely be back again!",xBBf0_7eg9Xoq-7EujLyuA,0,0,4,Xp5syfkzGP051sMW-c_81g
3746270,2013-11-20,7,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"After a successful night of clubbing in early October, my friend said he was going to The Tuscany to get $4.99 steak and eggs and offered to bring some back for me. I'd never heard of such a thing and was skeptical about how good a $5 steak would be. I also don't like eating late at night but he told me I'd regret it if I didn't.

I was starving by the time he got back since I stayed up waiting for him to return. My take-out box had steak, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast. The steak, to be honest, was barely edible and had a ton of fat. Another friend, who was also starving, thought it was delicious and ate most of it. The eggs were scrambled, pretty bland, and could've used some salt. So... why 4 stars?

The Loaded Hashbrowns -- it's $1 more to get them loaded, but do it anyway (uh, it's only a $1). I can promise you you won't regret it, because it's the most delightfully delicious concoction of hashbrowns, gravy, cheese, and only God knows what else (crack?); especially when you're starving at 4 AM. I'd pay $5.99 just for these hashbrowns alone.

So, go. Marilyn's steak obviously won't be the best you've ever had, but for $5, who's complaining?",3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg,8,7,4,Fxx5f5T8mRmInOh3xM9jhA

This one is off the Strip inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino on East Flamingo Rd. It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats. 

Marilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: http://www.tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/media/PDF/marilyn_menu/marilynmenu.pdf

However...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs. 

How much? $4.99

That's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price. 

They also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies. 

And I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed. 

So the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it.",8wKZ9gJYJtTdSVWgW7Or6Q,12,10,4,73zrZuJCo2UrRQxA54tAEQ

This is 'THE SPOT' to go for some cheap late night steak and eggs. At $5.99 from 12am-5am you can't really complain. Compared to another Cafe, located at a point somewhere south, the service and food quality is substantially better and it's located closer to the Vegas Strip off of Flamingo @ The Tuscany. Recommended spot to go to after the club.

JuL's Tips
* Dollar extra to add mushrooms or cheese to your eggs.
* Gets busy on weekends (Naturally because of clubs) Don't be shy to wave down a server if you need something they are nice.
* After 5am you'll have to wait til 6am for $8.99 Steak & Egg special which runs til 11am.
* Food taste better when you're drunk.",CSMPQpkIMUmj06_CfMXARw,0,0,3,AAM7q0n2UL4-YL1GsRjCXA

Marilyn's is an unassuming diner found within the Tuscany casino. Open 24 hours a day, this special only runs midnight to 6:00 am and is off menu. 

Looking back at reviews from a few years ago, the price of the steak & eggs special has been steadily increasing by about a dollar a year. It was $3.99 back in 2011-12, $4.99 in 2013, and now currently $5.99. Still, it's a cheap deal for a 6 oz. NY strip (see what they did there?), 2 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast (wheat, rye, or sourdough). Don't expect too much because the steak isn't like Lawry's across the street, but it'll do for late-night eats.

The first morning that we were in LV, we came in for Breakfast. I had the 8oz steak and sunnyside Eggs with hashbrowns. It was DELICIOUS!! The service was friendly, and quick. 

We came on Friday 8/15 for the AYCE Crab Legs. The wait was about 30-45 minutes (which was not a problem being a Friday night in Vegas), and there is so much commotion and noise (OH, but SO worth it for $19.99). 

**** Can I suggest a quick weekly STAFF MEETING to organize the chaos to be expected on a Friday night AYCE Crab legs meal??  It really was sheer chaos. We had several different waiters take our order, bring our order, refill our cups, etc.. I was confused on who the hell to tip @ the end of the night so We ended up leaving the $$ on the table, and let them fend for themselves.

Off the strip so prices are normal for the food that is served. Like Denny's but in a casino.

The hostess tried to sit us at a couple messy tables and then found one that had a Bobby pin on it. Apparently she was puzzled that I found that gross.

My friend always raves about this place, (he usually goes Friday nights for the all you can eat crab legs) so he brought me here for lunch today to try. Friday, around 11am, no wait to get in. Restaurant less than half occupied. They were going to seat us right next to (and almost on top of) a huge, obnoxious group of people, although there were other close tables in that same little section. I wasn't going to ask to sit at a different table, but my friend did. Hostess moved us 3 tables over from where we were going to be originally sat. Menu offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, and had a lot of options!! Also several options for us herbivores! It was a good 10 to 15 minutes before anyone came over. I figured service might be a little slower since we moved to possibly a closed table/section, but this was extreme. Especially since we were located very close to the kitchen walkway and servers were constantly walking past, ignoring us. Eventually a server strolls over and flatly says ""do you know what you want?"". No ""hi, how are you, sorry about the wait"", nothing. She was very unfriendly, borderline rude. He ordered the special, steak and eggs with pancakes and cottage cheese, (huge meal) for $8.99. I ordered a personal size (7 inch, $5.99) veggie pizza. You have the option of thin or regular crust, to which I ordered regular. We both ordered waters at that time also. She brought our waters, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. A good 45 minutes passed. He ordered medium for his steak, so it shouldn't have taken that long. Our food finally arrived. This is the only reason I gave any stars at all. His steak was cooked correctly, and said everything he had tasted good. My pizza (cheese, green pepper, onion, olive, mushroom, and tomato) was great!! They did burn the outside of the crust, but everything else was fresh and full of flavor. Never were offered refills. She did ask at one point how everything was. Took a while for her to drop the check. We were at a 2 top, very small, yet our table was never prebussed. (We had several plates due to his big meal). Cashier at the front wasn't friendly at all, either. All in all, the food was so good, and menu so large, at such cheap prices, I definitely want to come back and try other things and hope for better service.

The first morning we just needed a quick bite before we started the day with some friends so we worked our way down to the café in the hotel l. Luckily I decided to take a look at the menu before we were seated because the prices were way out of line.  A standard 2 egg, toast, bacon and coffee breakfast would have run about $13 each.  I figure that this is Vegas baby and I want a cheap steak and egg breakfast with all the trimmings for under $10. We then stopped by the buffet and found that the Friday morning breakfast buffet cost was over $20 each! What happened to cheap eats at the casinos? Needless to say we walked out and found McDonalds next door and had a quick cheap fast food meal for under $10 for the both of us which was much more to what we really were looking for. The next morning, after a late night out of fun and drinking we wanted a good sit down breakfast but again we didn't want to over pay by double so since I did have a car I figured I would yelp some local breakfast joints.  There were many but for some reason Marilyn's really stood out to us.  It was close, had tons of great reviews and it just sounded like exactly what we were looking for. Marilyn's is located at the Tuscany suites on Flamingo inside the small casino. Parking was a breeze and since the casino was very small we weren't too far from it when we walked in the front door. We got there around 10:30am and found it was perfect timing because we got a booth right away and the place was packed about 30 minutes later and had people waiting for a table by time we left just after 12. The menu was varied and you can choose breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime but we opted for breakfast.  I had the 2 pork chops and eggs any style that was served with has browns and toast which I subbed out for a biscuit. The  pork chops were thick sliced, center cut and cooked to perfection, the hash browns were crispy, the eggs were perfectly cooked to over easy with the whites cooked all the way through and the yolk runny and the biscuit was nice and flakey. My wife had a ham and cheese omelet  that was very tasty and also came with all the standard breakfast trimmings.  I noticed that they do offer a $4.99 steak and egg deal that is served midnight to 5 or 6am and then goes up a couple of bucks after that until I think noon and then goes up a couple of dollars more. We enjoyed our breakfast so much that we took our friends there after midnight on Saturday night and we all had the steak and egg special that is the perfect nightcap to a night of drinking dancing and gambling!

There is place know as ABC Cafe which WAS formerly home to the only $5.99 Steak and Eggs I have known to be in existence... And then they raised their price to $8.99 Which is ludicrous because you know that steak served with frozen veggies and fake instant mashed potatoes ain't worth that damn price... Until LDW '14 my world was about the change.

I've heard many stories of ""The Steak and Eggs of Tuscany Suites""... And finally got to experience th for myself this Labor Day Weekend! After night at the nightclub, this was the brightest of ideas to pop into our semi-sober minds! To my astonishment the fabled Steak and Eggs were located at Marilyn's Cafe inside of Tuscany Suites! Stayed there on several occasions and in retrospect, am ashamed I did not take advantage of this when staying only minutes walk from where we stayed.

We were seated immediately and got straight to business! Majority of us went straight for the meal of stories while others went for the Spaghetti and Meatballs which was advertised on the board when walking in. 

Once the meals were out and it was finally right before my eyes, I was in amazement of the quality cut of beef they used. Cooked medium rare, just the way I liked it. This was hands down wayyyy under priced! Quality was way better than any steak you would get at any Denny's or Applebee's for 1/2 the price. Me being a good friend... I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality late night meal! 

Oh and don't bother trying anything else... That good. The spaghetti and meatballs aren't anything worth mentioning... But until next time! When the 250 miles are no longer between me and my tastebuds. My wallet will miss you in the meantime.",90mR5_v0edA2LmSq2tBdqQ,2,1,4,E8ycOWAYX4y1H21y4_q1og

I've had my crab cravings in the past, and I'd call around the buffets in vegas (Bacchanal, wicked spoon) to ask if they specifically serve snow crabs. Why pay $40-$50 when all i want to do is get my mulah's deal worth on some crab action.

4pm-10p.m. only on Fridays. I came here around 5:00p.m., thinking that there'd be a line, but no, it was a shoe-in. Service was quick, waters were constantly filled, and the crabbies were loaded on my plate. You get two sides included (which isn't AYCE). I highly recommend the SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES. Probably the best I've ever had in my LYFE, SON! 

The french fries, mashed potatoes were average, and the fresh chips were really good. I just ate off of other people's plates, hence I got to try my medley of sides. 

I was stuffed by the end of the night. They also had some cookies that they sell Subway style by the cashier. I like my oatmeal cookies so it was yummy for my dessert. 

I'll definitely be back to fill my snow crab cravings!",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,7,3,4,3hMWn7cOAPwqm6kul3cHlA

The steak and eggs were SOOOOOO good after a night at the club! Definitely worth the $4! They give you a strip of steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and a lot of toast but be careful eating those as you will get full before you eat the rest of the plate! I asked for my steak medium and they did the cooking right! The bbq sauce on the table is so good with it! My eggs sunnyside up and again they did that right. Can't really go wrong with eggs though. The hashbrowns were so good with the crunch on the top. Throw some ketchup and tabasco on those babies and they're perfect!

We also got the gravy fries. Those were amazing as well. We didn't finish them though because we were all full from our steak and eggs.

This will definitely be my early morning spot when I come back to Vegas. I love that they're open 24 hrs. 

Taxis don't frequent this hotel since it's not on the strip. My friends and I didn't really know what to do to get back to our hotel.

I got the Philly cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. The fries were good, but the cheesesteak was pretty abysmal. It would have been OK if it weren't for the fact that the roll was separated (or maybe so soggy it fell apart) on the bottom, and it just made eating it really difficult.

Everytime i hit up sin city I have to have Steak & Eggs. Love Love Love em!!!
By far of all the spots I've tried close to the strip, Marilyn's Cafe is by far the best (aside from Mr. Lucky's 24-7) in terms of cost & quality. It's nothing super duper special but a great place to get your fix. 

Very friendly servers. Service is pretty on spot here except one time they were super super slow and the restaurant was 3/4 empty. By not means is this an upscale, fancy cafe. There is no modern decor nor an ambiance. Just a simple, old-school cafe & serves yummy bfast. There are various tables & booth seatings.

Once they found out there was a slight verbal disagreement as to who would actually serve us. Made for a bit of an awkward experience for us.

The staff was very happy to have us there.  I am certain of this because the waitress said to us in a genuine way, ""We're so happy to see you!"" 

I ordered fried chicken ($8.99 + $1.99 for side salad); the Mrs. ordered chicken fried steak ($10.99), and the kids agreed to share an order of lasagna.

Our waitress brought fresh warm dinner rolls and cornbread.

The only thing I would have changed was the side salad came with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  This is unnecessary when I order blue cheese dressing.

Service was also very attentive.  At one point my son spilled water onto the table, and a staff person was right there to wipe it up.

4506549,2009-04-10,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"Marilyn's is a traditional American restaurant located in the Tuscany Suites and Casino ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tuscany-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:tHx9zD374l4yfy6zp3rLZw ) on Flamingo Street in Las Vegas. It was pretty late in the Evening last week, and we heard about the popularity of the $3.99 Steak & Eggs - there really aren't any more CHEAP Breakfasts around Las Vegas any more - this is one of the remnants from the good ol' days. The inexpensive Steak & Eggs, from what I understand, are especially popular with Students.

Marilyn's is named after one of the original owners of the Tuscany Casino... even though presently, the Tuscany is corporately owned. Decor is laid-back 50s, especially with the dim incandescent tube lamps over each table or booth. Reminded me of a Spanish Hacienda or an Italian Villa themed restaurant with the dark woods and dim lights.... in keeping, I guess, with the Tuscany theme of the Casino.

On the menu...

Prime Rib (**** $10.95) Meat! That's what I like! The only qualification of a good cut of Prime Rib, IMO, is... leave some Fat in my cut of Prime Rib! And that's what the Chefs at Marilyn's accomplish. Quite a bit more than the 10 ounces stated on the menu... that's alright by me! Side of Cauliflower (** 1/2) - way, way over-cooked, though. And a side of Baked Potato (*** 1/2)... pretty hard not to mess this up. Prefaced with some Dinner Rolls with Butter - OK. Also came with a tin of Au Jus - kids were asking why I wasn't dipping - I never mess up a piece of good meat with anything else!

At less than $1.00 per ounce of Beef - a very, very good value, especially with some Fat left on the Prime Rib. Lucky for me tonight, Marilyn's didn't try to get ""Healthy"" on me... Ate the Whole Thing! Nothing left on the plate!

Fried Bananas (****) The low rating for this Dessert was primarily my fault... took a little longer to finish the Prime Rib than I thought it would. Therefore the Fried Bananas just sat for a few minutes longer than it should have. I'm a meat guy... wanted to finish off that Beef before starting on the Sweet Stuff! Don't ""mess"" with the Fried Bananas with a side of Ice Cream... liked it the way if was... just Fried. Really, really good finish to the meal. 

Iced Tea

Value (**** 1/2) As with most restaurants in Casinos, the value factor in a restaurant is usually pretty high because the losses you incur at gambling usually will cover the expenses that most Casino restaurants incur. 

Not crowded on a late weekday evening, just three tables occupied when we dined here... BUT, as with any restaurant associated with a Casino or Hotel in Las Vegas... there WILL be lines and lines of people on the Weekends! This is a basic Casino Coffee Shop, if you don't equate Marilyn's to Fine Dining you'll be OK.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,4,E6Z9RUBjYEbdCXf3jlnQrA

The Tuscany Garden was closed so this was the only place to get food.  I went over and ordered food to go to take to the lounge.  We ordered a Waldorf Salad, some potato skins, mini burgers and a corned beef sandwich.  Everything that came which was cooked in oil tasted LOUSY.  It tasted like the oil was rancid and had not been changed in a while.

The salad had what they call chicken which was not real chicken, it was processed and tasted nasty.  Needless to say, $38 down the drain because other then the mini burgers and the corned beef sandwich, everything else got thrown in the trash.  The sides with the sandwiches, the potato skins, the salad....Maybe the Steak and Eggs people talk about after midnight might be ok unless you are too drunk to notice any better, otherwise this is a place I would NOT recommend.

Now for my experience with the staff. My waitress was great! Very attentive and friendly. However, my experience with the manager on duty did not make a good impression. I was waiting to be seated and a waiter walks up to the hostess and asks her a question in Spanish. So the hostess responds to him in Spanish then the manager walks up. She then proceeds to say ""English only please"". I can't understand what it matters. As I get seated I then hear the manager continue telling the waiter now, ""if your customer speaks Spanish that's fine, other than that I want everyone to speak English"". First of all, this is Vegas, I hear tons of different languages here a few it's awesome to have so many people from all over the world descend here for work and pleasure, a true melting pot and that's part of what makes Vegas so much fun. Second, I wasn't being responded to in Spanish, my entire conversation with the hostess was in English so she was speaking English, the manager just butted her way in on a conversation and made assumptions. I don't understand why a private conversation can't take place between two co workers in a language that they want. I don't need to know what they're talking about and I doubt that they're trying to hide what they're saying from guests, a ton of people speak Spanish. Lastly, what if I was a fair skinned Spanish speaker and I initiated a conversation with the hostess before she arrived? Isn't that kind of dumb to make an assertion that I speak English? I really didn't appreciate how she spoke to the hard working staff.

She was attentive, always nearby and had some great suggestions.  She actually seemed to be happy to do her job, not like some of the soulless eyes that stare back at you in Vegas.  

Jeff got the eggs benedict.  He had ordered them the day before and decided to do them again.  They looked great and the eggs were perfectly cooked.  He got some orange juice.  It was ok, but it had a flavor that we couldn't quite place.  I think there may have been something else in the juice mix, maybe tangerine.  

I got the chili omelet with grits.  The grits were delicious, not too dry and not undercooked.  They added a dollop of butter, which is the way that everyone should eat grits.  (Now, if they had some cheese, I might have added a little of that, too.  I guess I could have asked, but a chili omelet is already enough gut-busting damage as it is.)  The chili was kinda funky and didn't have much flavor.  The omelet was well done, however.  It wasn't too dry nor too runny.  I wasn't going to order toast, but then I changed my mind.  Nedra had toast out to me in less than a minute and it was hot and buttered.  Damn, that is good service.

Jeff got excited and accidentally knocked over his juice, all over the toast.  Within 3 milliseconds, there was a waiter/busboy with a stack of napkins to wipe up the spill.  He was gone and back in a flash with more napkins.  Nedra came over, tsk'd us, offered more juice and brought out more toast.  So impressive. Most places would just ignore you.  
The style of the restaurant reminded me of broken-down Santa Fe style, though I'm sure they were trying to imitate some rustic Italian villa.  (It doesn't work.)

He had ordered glazed carrots which came out of the kitchen brown and carrots are orange so he sent them back and said he'd have corn instead.

That could be because I always arrive at odd hours after clubbing or raving--anywhere from 3-6am. The decor is warm, the furniture placement is spacious, and the whole setting is inviting coupled with some of the best service experience I've had. With the right friends, this place is perfect. I remember a couple years back, after my friends and I drunkenly collected handful of escort cards walking down The Strip, we played our own version of 21 with the cards and the staff didn't bat an eyelash. The waiters and waitresses are very charming and friendly. Once, they even warmed up food I got from Earl's Sandwiches. Ask for something nicely and they'll return in kind. So overall, the staff and environment is really great.

Their menu is so vast--spanning at a whopping 127 total entree choices for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner (~40 each; not including beverages)--yet they don't lose the quality of their food and their portions are very generous. Each entree comes with your choice of bread and butter or jam. They gave me enough (delicious) baked ziti to last me a couple of days. I've also had their vegetarian omelet a few times which was a little more bland than I would have liked but, luckily for me, I like dousing my omelets in spicy sauces or dip it in ketchup so it tasted just perfect. My friends always, always, always order their Steak and Eggs which I would recommend for anyone who loves Vegas' meaty breakfast foods at affordable prices--sometimes they have Daily specials for this at $6.

Whether you're pumping yourself full of food for a hard night out, hungover, or just hungry, this is the place to be. With the friendly environment, great company, delicious cuisine, and college student-friendly prices, it's a perfect dining experience. My friends and I always visit here whenever we're in Vegas and we have some really great memories here. It's a tradition we plan on continuing for as long as we hang out in LV together.",HCiP_9g_eHqpFz65skfzAA,1,1,5,-_S4B7oh4VWZbs-0pTZ-aw

I believe the long waits puts an unnecessary additional amount of pressure on the taste of the food.  We wanted Steak and Eggs and Yelped this place specifically for that reason.  Sadly the steak was REALLY tough and the hash browns were bland and uneventful.

Once I arrive I have to wait 5+ minutes to be sat because the host is off somewhere else. Then I'm sat and NO ONE comes to greet me, ask if I want something to drink or anything for 10 minutes! Finally a server on his way to drop off a guest check at the last remaining occupied table in my section stops and asks if I have been helped. I told him no and he takes my order and brings me back a water using lots of 'here you are beautiful'. He was the only saving grace of my visit but that was short lived because I overheard him telling his last table that his shift was over. 

I order the four piece fried chicken and it is brought out in about 12 minutes by a lady. No one comes back to check on me the entire time I'm eating. When I'm done I ask the food runner who I can get my check from and he says he'll let my server know. I find that interesting because 'I' don't even know who my server is. The lady who dropped off my food but never introduced herself or spoke to me drops off the check and asks if I want a box. I say yes. It then takes a little bit to get the box. As I get up to leave to go to the cashier she then yells out ""Thank you so much, have a nice day!"" as if she just remembered she wants a tip for her non-service.

So then I get to the cashier and it's a whole new barrel of monkeys. I hand the cashier my debit card and she says she needs my id for credit cards. I tell her I didn't bring it in my little wristlet because I didn't want to gamble and just came over for lunch. I say it's debit and I'll put in my pin. She says they don't have the machine and that I would need my ID.  I only left $8.79 in my wristlet and my check is $9.74 and I tell her again I didn't bring my license cause I walked and wasn't planning on gambling and just brought my debit card. I ask for a manager. She goes away, comes back and says the manager is busy but that it's their policy to need ID even for a debit card cause they are going to run it as credit and that I can go use the casino ATM. I tell her there is no way I'm taking out cash at a casino ATM and that there should have been a notice prior to a guest sitting down and eating in the restaurant that I would need id to use my debit card as that is not common practice to need one at restaurants. The large sign by the cash register only says you need id and room key if you are going to make a room charge. Seeing as how I'm at Tuscany eating and staying at The Westin that didn't apply to me. She then walks over to a small notice in small writing on the other side of the other register that says for credit cards you need id. Again I tell her that I brought by DEBIT card, and that little sign won't be seen by anyone, AND it would be seen after the fact. After someone has already eaten. I told her I'm trying to pay but I'm not using using their ATM and I only have $8.74 in cash on me and if the manager is too busy to come speak with a guest (I even showed her the copy of my work id that I have a pic of on my iphone that shows I'm airline crew which has helped many times at hotel front desks when I've locked my room key in my room and I need them to reissue me another one) then thatbis not my problem. Finally, she goes back to wherever she went before, comes back and takes the cash I do have and says next time bring ID, and I tell her there won't be a next time.

Between the horrible service, then the cashier incident, I would not go back to that place. The food was fine, but nothing special.

I made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.

The eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.

And the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.  

And the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.  

I kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.

Top it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.

That being said, Marilyn's Cafe is not that bad. It's on par with IHOP and Blueberry Hill in terms of food. And let's face it--every cheap breakfast place you've stopped at is probably horrifyingly average.

AMBIANCE: 3 - The Cafe, or at least the inside seemed out of place. The Tuscany looks like a classy casino, until you step into the cafe, where it seems a bit worn down and old. However, it was very spacious inside and they try to sit everyone at booths since not a ton of people come visit them!

It certainly isn't the service -- it's absolutely ridiculous how terrible the service has been here.

It was just such a pleasant change for us, we decided to let her know. A lot.

The graveyard breakfast specials aren't bad, and the price is outrageously cheap. Steak 'n eggs, taters, and toast -- $2.99. Pancakes or two eggs 'n toast -- $0.99.

I think it's ridiculous that they have to implement the rules that we can't split checks and on top of that we can't have multiple payments?! It makes it stressful on my group and other customer's groups, and it strongly deters people from dining in here. The cashiers sigh and roll their eyes when a group has difficulty arranging the payment method, and I'm just standing in front of them like you guys are just standing and taking payments, no need to roll your eyes when customers are struggling to pay because of your unnecessary rules/ limitations to big groups. Some servers are sweet and I appreciate that but other employee's just don't know how to hold customer service. When we dined in one time, my cousin put her head down because she had a headache and an employee comes up to our table to let us know that she can't be laying her head on the table... why not?

5240748,2018-06-10,0,vOfz55MmWgjNQ3BA2PnhgQ,"One of the best ""unexpected gem"" secrets that I found out about by a Las Vegas native. I would always come to Marilyn's Cafe after clubs in the AMs for their Steak n Eggs which is like $5.99 I believe?? This cafe is located in Tuscany Hotel which is kinda far from most clubs but worth the uber/lyft over. 

I believe their Steak n Eggs special is usually in the middle of the night which is the perfect drunchies. You can order the steaks however you want (rare, medium rare, medium well, etc.), you can also order the eggs however style you want (poached, scrambled, sunny side up, etc.), and you can order whatever your 2 pieces of bread you want too (wheat or white). It also comes with a big piece of hash brown. DEFINITELY WORTH THE COST. 

Service was pretty quick but the food sadly does take a long time to come out. Sometimes when it's busy, the wait for the food can feel like forever. However, once the food is out, the happiness begins because the food is bomb. I think it's one of the perfect ways to end a night. The steak is definitely worth more than the price you pay. The bread is probably my favorite part because they put butter over it and it tastes so good and toasted.

Definitely a must go to place for people should go to when they're in Vegas!! It's definitely exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to be back here",TJd0EqFv7m9HY3yy3Lv9XA,1,2,4,r7ov8q0mBwdo4Dl8uvivhg

 I liked the touch of the tea light candle to keep your butter warm. They brought us each a second plate of crab legs before I could finish the first plate.

Yawp.  This spot has cheap ass steak and eggs for pennies on what you would probably spend in Vegas.  It's inside Tuscany Casino which isn't such a great spot but it's well worth the trek for after club/drinking grub.  

Now onto the flavor of the meal.  It is $4 steak and eggs.  It's not some prime cut ish you would find in a bitchin steak house.

I have never had any major problems here and I don't foresee any in the future.  Breakfast anytime you want it... cheap eats... and good service, what else do you want?  Here is my review from my last visit:

 - We walk up to the counter and we were seated right away.

 - Our drink order was taken and brought out promptly.

 - The waitress came over and took our order.  

  * Side note: I am not one that is really picky but, I eat Ultra Low Carb throughout the week.  So, I ordered a burger with no bun and instead of fries, I asked for a side of bacon.  Of course my friends gave me a little grief - as good friends do from time to time.  Or, in my case, all of the time.  

Anyhow, she, said it she'll look into it.  It turned out to be no problem and I was charged the regular price.

 - We had ample time between our courses.  So, there was no rushing through the salad / soup because our main meal was on it's way out.

 - Our drinks were always full.

 - We were checked up on periodically.  

 - She gave us the desert pitch before handing us our bill.  

This is the type of service I want and expect when I choose to eat out.  So, with all of that said, it was a pretty good experience to just hang out with a couple of friends and have a pretty decent meal.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,3,3,5,xbfF3y2FSCftgGFOblPWNA

There were 10 of us and the bill came to about $300. Once we went to the counter to pay, there was a sign that said they don't split checks. This sign was so hard to see considering how packed it was and people were almost always standing in front of it. 

We asked for the manager since we all had debit/credit cards to pay with. The manager first said that ""the system"" won't let them split checks on Fridays but any other day it will. We explained to him that were unable to pay unless it was separate. He, then, said he could split the check in two for us and told us to use the atm. This still was not going to work as none of us with credit cards were going to get a cash advance for this. He sighed and mumbled something under his breath with attitude and said he'll split the check in three for us. Since we still couldn't do this the waitress stepped in and said she would void the check and then separate it. The manager told her that the voided check would still come out of her taxes and she said it was ok. So this manager said fine and stormed off.

Twice I went for breakfast. I will say the hash browns were good, but that is the only thing that was good. They use a disgusting version of cheddar cheese that tasted like powder and was almost not edible. The pancakes were obviously sitting in the heat lamp too long and the top of the top pancake was hard as a rock (and the plate was extremely hot which is usually a sign of heat lamp exposure).

The third time we went for dinner. I was between the chicken fried steak, the chicken cordon blue and the ribs. The waiter told me not to get the chicken fried steak (never a good sign when the waiter tells you not to eat something), and another guest told me not to have the chicken cordon blue. So by process of elimination I was stuck with the ribs which were also bad.

The ribs came with two sides. I chose the mashed potatoes which were okay but the mac and cheese was absolutely horrible. Probably because they use the same cheese as I had on my eggs at breakfast. Guess I should have anticipated that. Another person at my table also had the mac and cheese and also hated it.

Food 8/10- The steak and eggs came with hash browns and toast. The steak was a good portion for me. I have a small appetite. The white rice was really hard. Being Asian rice is everything and with that being said I was disappointed that the rice wasn't really ""edible"". Also, I noticed that my other two friends who also ordered rice had a different portion of it. One friend had a nice scoop of it nicely on a plate, while I had mines scattered and half the size of his portion. My other friend had only more than half of my size of rice and it looked like the rice was old and leftover. They tried to trick us is into thinking all the rice was the same by not arranging it into a scoop like my one friend.

That's pretty much all I need to say about this place (joking), but honestly though. Whenever I'm trying to sober up from a night of drinking, this place comes on top of the list next to two others. Besides the actually steak and eggs themselves, I love that this place is located near the Strip. It comes in handy when you've spend a long night drinking whether it be in a club or at a hotel party. 

The ONLY thing that keeps it from becoming a full 5 stars is the fact they have a certain time limit and day when parties aren't able to do split checks which kind of makes it inconvenient when you're sobering up and forgot to carry cash on you and your card limit has been completely maxed out due to heavy drinking.

All in all, definitely a good sober up place.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,1,4,fRgiBUnXN8bEUQLZYQjePQ

I don't remember much from this experience because alcohol and lack of sleep don't mix well and I fell asleep waiting for my food. BUT, when it came, the steak was delicious. And the eggs. And the hashbrowns. I'm surprised I was able to finish everything!!

Service is SLOW SLOW SLOW. We played at the tables while waiting to be seated.

The side salad that came with my meal I enjoyed so much it was like $1.99 seriously crazy prices from the 70's I'm not complaining, the next night I ordered the same salad with a small pizza.

It just goes to show that you sometimes pay a premium for places on the strip that isn't even worth it. Vegas city blocks are long, but this one is a few away from the strip.

While one hostess was helping a customer paying the bill at the register, another one saw us to get us seated at a table. They seem to work well together noticing when refills were needed for beverages. I like that my chicken and waffles were tenders. It's been slightly annoying for me as of late to have to pick apart the chicken from bones. I am pretty sure that if I come back to Vegas again I would definitely stop in here for another meal.

Instead many employees went to the stand and ignored us and others waiting. Like we weren't even there. 
Then after finally seated,  I kid you not... 20 minuttes of awkwardly sitting there before a server came and got our drink order. Prob took another 10 min to get drinks to us. The Orange juice was nasty & server forgot my water I asked for. Tried drinking the OJ anyway but really it wasn't good so I asked for the water again. Water... even worse!

We came on Friday night after XS.  Driving it isn't too far from the strip, about 5 minutes or so and plenty of parking.  It's located in the Tuscany hotel and casino.

PARKING: Free, huge parking lot.

ATMOSPHERE: Has that denny's/ihop feel to it but we got a big booth for 8 of us and were seated right away.

FOOD: Coming at 2:30am they had the steak and eggs special.  I didn't see it on the menu but just ask for it and the waiter will get it for you.  I think it was $4.99 or $5.99 but either way very cheap.  Ask for it more rare than you normally order it because it is pretty thin and they tend to overcook the meat.  I got medium rare and it was only pink.  

The platter comes with steak, 2 eggs, hash browns and 4 pieces of toast (you can choose).  I got the eggs over easy and they were runny but not gross.  I got sourdough toast, where they put the butter on it for you and it was SO GOOD.  The hash browns were tasty, not bland and hard but still hot and crispy.

The steak was OK, as you can imagine for such a cheap price, but the flavoring wasn't bad.  It was just slightly tough.

Overall, definitely a must for your trip to Vegas.",PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg,4,3,4,-xR-mdBE906keEgIML5cbw

At 9:45pm, the line took 5 minutes and they still seemed busy. John, our first server, was close to ending his shift and rushed us through the ordering process. When we got our food it was barely warm and drinks had to be requested twice. We were not impressed. I didn't know what to say to the family as I remember the cafe as being quite good for the price. We ordered a second round of crab plates when John disappeared without a word. No waiter, no crab, no drink refills. 

I was about to approach the manager. And another waiter saw my distress. James saved the day. He has a smile, customer skills, and took responsibility for making the rest of our dining an event and fun. He was there with drinks, hot sides of potato chips, and steaming hot tasty plates of crab. Thanks Marilyn's Cafe. We had a great time. John almost lost the place a few customers.
