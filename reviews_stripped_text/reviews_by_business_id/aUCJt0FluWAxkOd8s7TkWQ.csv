I've been a big fan of this chain for years and was thrilled Vegas had them when I moved here from Cali. Was never lucky enough to have one anywhere near where I lived so this is extra exciting because it's a 5 min drive from my house now! It's so pretty and new now and I hope that lasts for a long time. 

The menu is simple and and I love their cheeseburger with grilled onions and ketchup & mustard instead of the house sauce. Fries are good but eat them quickly because they don't taste great after they've cooled. Also love their strawberry shake! 

You can customize to your liking and everyone is nice about it. Sometimes they're so nice (especially the drive thru girls) that it forces me to perk up after a shitty day. Hands down one of the best fast food chains out there!",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,40,39,5,8NRAt67rYdPwVUMFd8FvcA

2321385,2018-05-26,1,aUCJt0FluWAxkOd8s7TkWQ,I was excited that an in n out opened closer to my home. But I was super disappointed not only did they completely mess up the order the burgers sucked with ungrilled buns barely any grilled onions and wayy too many pickles and barely any cheese. I felt like I was eating a different burger compared to my regular location. GO TO YOUR REGULAR IN N OUT THIS PLACE IS INEXPERIENCED AND SUCKS.,nhUQgQihp2ESGAbK1NX1Eg,0,0,1,BTOHalDP9G_KspaUHbxN8A

4051417,2018-06-06,9,aUCJt0FluWAxkOd8s7TkWQ,"In-N-Out Burger (West Sahara Ave. / Las Vegas, NV)

This location just opened,
it's hot and new.
I reviewed every location out here,
So, this one was due. 

The drive-thru was busy,
but empty inside.
I love me some In-N-Out,
I got nothing to hide.

It's all beef, baby!
you won't find pork.
I took pictures of my food,
and even my fork. 

Consistency they have,
and freshness they got.
I love me some In-N-Out,
I'm at one a lot. 

Tons of employees working,
it was staffed galore.
The restaurant was spotless,
and even the floor. 

As for the price, 
it's discount heaven.
I got three Flying Dutchman's,
for less than seven. 

A combo is hooked up, 
you do get plenty. 
Even a meal for three,
is less than twenty.

So, there you have it,
I'm a man with a plan.
I'm more than just a supporter,
I'm a super fan!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,9,5,4uPREZIavkC_3hhokkLvxA

4418112,2018-06-13,0,aUCJt0FluWAxkOd8s7TkWQ,"Consistency and simplicity are key to a thriving burger joint. Doesn't matter where on the West Coast you go... you can be guaranteed fresh patties no more than from 500 miles away, cheap menu, a secret menu that stays the same, and efficient, college aged customer service.. along with the wait of made to order. Also, you can pretty much count on all of the seating being the exact same. I'm glad they started taking card all those years ago.

Thank you for finally opening the only fast food burger worthy of Summerlin palates. We don't have to drive down to Tropicana for our fix.

In and out has always been a treat for me. It's not the burger I can eat weekly but I do have my cravings and need my quarterly fix. 

I think the drive through is a little faster than inside but expect, as everywhere, for your wait to be at least 5 minutes.

Rookie tip- ask for extra spread. You can never douse your fries in too much thousand island-esque goodness.

P.S. I hear they pay well and have pretty good benefits!

That's what a hamburgers all about!",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,0,5,Y9UjqyUVv6NjR6Y1i-Wybg

Stuck with my usual combination of the awesome signature hamburger with fresh, hot fries and a creamy chocolate shake! 

In N Out is always reliable, consistent and delicious! Whether you are simple like me, enjoy animal style, or a lettuce burger they are here to please with a friendly smile and attitude!

Even thought I'm pretty sure they are still training staff, this place seems to be doing very well.  The staff was friendly, the drive through was quick, and my order was right.  The food was cooked to the quality that you'd expect from in-n-out.  The bonus for me is this place is much closer to my house than any other one, so the food was still hot when I got home.",R4zN9onPSbLqsXtcEySpeg,0,0,5,Nji80l4gXNl_cCG7Z6qVpg
