They did have some pitcher specials on Pyramid.  It was nice to have a good Seattle beer available away from home & the price wasn't bad at all.  I give this place this rating for it's beer selection & pro-Seahawks environment.  Other than that, it was just mediocre.",eipO40vDyfHFXug2ElJ7Yg,2,0,4,ZtWB46mFZ4PQBKZP-WJMUA

I came here for the first game of the NFL season last year to follow the Seahawks. They only had 2 people at the bar and they seemed to hate that is way busy so they were very unhelpful and the only thing the place was stressed out about was not clogging the video poker that nobody was playing at the bar. After spending $40 on beer and food I decided I would just buy the Sunday ticket instead on direct TV. Also the TVs were extremely dated projection Box TV that were super distorted.",hkSiQAfl6w3882JJQzRTlQ,3,0,1,V-OpnyoIgd_gU1nvNifalA
5861722,2010-10-06,2,qYDp5JsCh5ebULZaFCqKiA,Really? $9 pitcher is the happy hour special and it is domestic beer only? Even with no smokers around this place smelled like a Denny's of yesteryear when everyone smoked.  Food was nothing to get excited about yet the prices show that they think they are.   What a dissapointment.  Should have heeded caution of other yelp review.,Q4Qfu-3vYtL1LRm2X1b0Gg,3,1,3,KkulK_KsFYAQiY63zluA5Q
