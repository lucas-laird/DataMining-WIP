BUT the GM Scott has horrible customer service UNLESS you're a personal friend of his, he won't talk to you or try to help you out, I've been coming here for months now and consider my self a regular seeing how everyone else remembers me and not once has he approached me or introduced himself I've literally sat at the bar for over an hour and he never once asked if I needed anything. And I've seen him give so much more attention to his buddy's then everyone else, favoritism is really a factor when it comes to him, only reason I come to this location Still is because of the bartenders they're awesome they make you feel welcomed and do their absolute best to serve you.

I have came to this location for a couple years now and I usually have a good experience. Today, my bartender was Jen and I must say, you'd think if you were in the customer service industry, you'd actually provide good customer service. She did not provide anything but a horrible attitude. First of all, when I came in, my friend and I could barely sit down before she demanded my ID. After she spent a minute or so looking over it, she got my drink and slammed it on the bar. She didn't provide me with a beverage napkin or anything of sorts. It took me ten minutes to ask her for a water because I'm going to assume I'm a female and I'm not gambling. I watched her talk to every GUY at the bar and ignored me. I have been a cocktail waitress and a bartender for over 7 years and I know there is someone who would love to have her job. She needs to be re-trained to accommodate her customers. I'm sick and tired of seeing Waitresses/Bartenders be a complete asshole for no reason. You have one job. Do it right or find another one.

The bar tender here had no problem putting on a hockey game for me on one of the TV's, and discussing his thoughts on a few of the seasonal beers they had on tap.  Since this is close to my house, I come here from time to time to catch a game or grab a pint with a friend.

Unfortunately of all days too pick he choose bite of las vegas going on across the street. It throws this review into loop of sorts. Talk about business being prepared the whole mini shopping mall with mostly restaurants had tow trucks on speed dial if your not going into any one of the establishments. NO JOKE. If they see you walking across the street they might give you warning but more then not going too get towed. I seen at hanging out the bar for hours one lady complaining.  Like putting players card in machine justify that your playing or even at the bar. So if anything that stands out rather then just like most other PTs have been too around town. On bite of las vegas this is one place that takes their customers seriously. I admit enjoyed seeing business take care of its customers. 

The bar like mention its like most others PTs nothing much special although it was my first time at this particular location. I like the fact that they had two separate areas on one side with divider of sorts plants that had three pool tables and then other side lounge type set up with three wide scree televisions all with sports on. The bar is decent size (big rectangle) with lots of machines too play, and television all up at the bar area. We had great service. It wound up being small crowd but notice everyone was getting their drinks and birthday shots ordered got were all tasty. 

I like the way bar set up if get group of friends together for drinks. It has almost three separate area that can mingle with friends.

This was around 6am. We always have a good time here, but they have made our experience really bad now. 
We even left our vapor cigarette inside while we were outside talking and we go back to claim it and they tell us they cant help us. Our vape was gone at the bar where we left it.

My husband and I would frequent this place oh so often, and have spent a lot of money patronizing this establishment. We've never had any issues until recently when Erin the bartender, (shes mostly there at night) accused my husband of throwing up outside in the parking lot on one occasion and unofficially 86'd him and told him he had to leave and never come back. My husband tried to explain to her that she was mistaking him for another gentlemen that was with my husband that evening who had too much to drink and did throw up. She was very rude, my husband was never rude to her, my husband asked her for proof of the incident which she could not provide. I don't know what kind training she's had but it's definitely not customer service friendly. She has singled out my husband as if she has a personal problem with him. And argue every time he has asked for proof and threatens to call Metro if he doesn't leave. She said that he can come when she's not working her shift because and I'm quoting her ""this is HER bar"" ???? What working employee says that? Thats how you know she was lying because ""86"" means your not allowed there period. No matter who is working. It seems like a personal issue or she's discriminating against my husband for being an African American hard working  paying customer.  We've asked for the mangers info and Erin has refused to give it to my husband. You don't treat customers like this. We won't be going to any PT's locations thanks to this horrible experience with this rude bartender Erin. Also don't count on having the music you pay for play because Erin bragged to customers that she's able to control the music tunes from her phone. And if she doesn't like a song she will skip it and play music that she likes, so if you ever wonder why your song that you paid isn't playing.

My friend and I asked one of them (Mike, I think) for a glass of water before we left. Mike replied something to the effect of it not being his particular responsibility at that time. He didn't even tell the other bartender that we had requested it. So we are sitting there another 5 minutes for her to come back around to get us water. Keep in mind, this is a bar. 

This isn't the first time I've received crap service at this location from those two. They even look miserable working together; arguing as they are working, both with resting-""grumpy""-face grimacing. The dude is curt and dismissive, and she just seems fed up.

First off I can understand a shift change, when one Bartender leaves and another one takes over.
Yes there is a delay since one person is leaving and the other is coming on duty, but at least acknowledge the guests that are waiting at the bar to order.
""Be right with you, shift change"", but here around midnight, not a single word or even a glance up to make eye contact.
Then when the change over is completed, the Bartender should take care of business, but not here.
We waited a little longer and since there is no table service, I go up to order again and finally get acknowledged!
I order my beers and when she goes to the tap, the keg is empty! So without saying a word she goes to the back room to change it.
After another delay she comes out and starts to serve some other people, I'm like...What?!
So I go back up to the bar and when she comes over to see me again, I ask what happened to the beers I ordered?
She says, ""we are out of it"".

That AND tight machines will make this my 1st ever NEVER GO BACK WINNER of 2017...NEVER AGAIN,eDdQbUwwkoE_TZeqQ_1NNA,0,0,1,0Y1-pD02mPiL6_PrLR4CkA

My husband and I walked in and sat down at one of the tables. No one greeted us. There was a decent amount of people inside, but the place was not packed. We browsed the menu, waited for about 20 minutes and no one came by to help us. Finally, my husband went to the bar and asked one of the bartenders if we could order drinks and food. She told him that they don't have any servers so everything would have to be ordered at the bar. Wow, it would have been nice if someone greeted us and let us know in the first place! Right!?

The menu is a little different from Sierra Gold's (Sierra's one is better in my opinion). I was looking forward to at least having the bbq pork stuffed potato skins, but they didn't have those here. I ended up ordering the club wrap with NO tomatoes, which of course, came with tomatoes. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sliders that he ordered in the past. This time, they made them way too spicy. So we both didn't enjoy our meals. Also, they did not give us any napkins. 

The bartender gave us the wrong bill at first. She gave us the correct one after we complained. Then, she accidentally charged my card for BOTH bills! Can you believe that? She said that she voided out one of the charges, but wasn't very apologetic. I checked my account a few days later to make sure, and thankfully, I wasn't charged twice. 

They really need to train their employees on customer service!

*Sigh* Never again....",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,0,1,4NGS3WOKp0VHNo6a-b730w
