It might not be as vast or huge as the one in LA. But the offerings isn't too shabby either.,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,3,2,5,ObqgAvqnCEucA4t4WfdZ3g

1170312,2013-12-01,0,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"Ate at Hot Tofu for the second time. #4, tofu soup with pork. Came with a dried fish, three side dishes (bean sprouts, cucumber, cabbage kimchi), and my choice of white or purple rice (purple, duh).

Soup was good, 4/5, lots of meat and the tofu was super creamy. Kimchi and cucumber were not good, I barely touched them. Bean sprouts were okay. Rice was excellent. I didn't eat my fish, just not a fan. Last time I gave it to my boyfriend, but he wasn't with me this time, so I didn't think of telling them to not include it. When the cashier came over to check on me she offered to trade it out for noodles. I declined because I was already full, but I thought out was sweet of her.  :)

For the price and convenience, I would eat here again.",kUQx_wxmHgZ4CvhNeDpPww,0,0,3,j2gQwzfFgOXxbNBDLfQDiw

We went with kids and asked for extra bowl and spoon for sharing. The service lady, older Korean lady with black trimmed glasses who clearly understood me. After asking 3 times she finally, reluctantly gave it to us and said ""I am not your maid"". Are you kidding me!? If you do not want to service English speaking customers, you should post the sign of Korean customers only. There is no room for this type of service anywhere. You ruined our appetite and vacation time. Awful!",VF83LDmpFZyUX-LKlSUuOQ,0,0,1,mSV3scGH8nai6T70oxhoCA
1807506,2013-10-25,1,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"Craving good Korean food, but too far from the usual place, so I stopped in here.  They must be nearing the end of a remodeling effort (the front of the plaza was being painted and the food court looks like it's been through some changes...lot of vacant stalls).  The hot tofu spot in the corner was open, so I ordered the bulgogi special.  The hot pot tofu soup was steaming hot (which I love), spicy (another plus), with creamy chunks of tofu, bits of beef.  The bulgogi was sliced nice and thin and while tasty enough, it just wasn't savory.  At first taste of the banchan, I thought maybe my allergies were affecting the ol' taste buds, but none of the banchan were seasoned or even salted correctly, very bland.  The kimchi was crunchy fresh, but seasoning needed to be adjusted and the kongnamul was fine, of course.  Had the ogok bab, the purplish steamed mixed grain rice, way more personality in the taste department than plain steamed white rice.  Overall, I have to give this place 2 stars because things were unfinished and still under construction, plus the flavor of the food was lacking (come on now, that's what sets Korean food apart)!  I will try again some time, maybe by then the food court will be full and there will be other vendor choices.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,3,1,2,47X1B5VShKhbCzUqZmypuQ
1925940,2013-12-21,2,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"Location:  Inside Greenland's supermarket situated on the NE side of Rainbow and Spring Mtn. Nice exterior decor of distinct Asian elements that can't be missed as you drive north on Rainbow or west on Spring Mtn.

As you walk into the Greenland market, you'll see a nice spread of sweets on the left from a bakery and past it, the food court to the right.  The food court is spacious and presents a great spread and variety of food like Han's Chicken and Pizza with interesting Sweet Potato twist or sushi rolls from other vendors.  There's also the staple Korean BBQ offered by few vendors that is accompanied by side dishes and/or tofu soup with prices that are on average $15 (can be portioned out to 2 meals for me).    

After working in the cold for the last few days, my body was begging for hot soup and notably a spicy one.  So, after previous visits to the food court with no signs of any vendors selling jampong (spicy seafood soup), I was surprise that on this particular shopping visit, I came across a new addition to the food court that served Korean and Chinese dishes.  This was the only food vendor that offered this delectable treat at a great price of $8.95 for a big bowl.  As usual, the bowl contained a generous portion of various seafood ingredients like shrimp and calamari along with side dishes of neon yellow radishes, onions, and black bean paste...and of course the staple kimchi.  However, having tried it at restaurants, I was put off by the fact that they used spaghetti noodle rather than the thick udon like noodles.  For most, it might not have been noticed if they haven't haven't had this frequently, but for me it changed the notion of the soup.  At first taste, it seemed watered down, but after continuous taste of the soup, the heat of the spice started to kick in.  I couldn't complain as much since I was hungry and recovering from a cold and I did happily enjoy the hot & spicy combo of the soup.  I did, however, could care less for the overly fermented kimchi.  

Takeaway: If you want a quick bite of Asian food with great variety this would be the ideal place. Not a very intimidating place to come by yourself, but also more enjoyable with a company of people to be able to eat some of the big family style meals and be apart of the communal spirit of the Asian culture.",EDomjStHED1E59zv3haruA,0,0,5,hByN1yPM42szPhQWagysqQ
1999485,2015-02-06,6,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"I don't know what it is about shopping at Greenland, but every time I get fresh produce and groceries and cool ethnic ingredients to experiment with in the kitchen... I still feel an urge to grab a quick meal at the food court instead of going home to make one myself!

There are a few shops in the ""food court"" area and only a handful of restaurants: my preference is for the sushi counter, with each roll going for a low $7. Please note that dining in gets you larger rolls than takeout.
Red Gate is good for chinese options, Hot Tofu has vegetarian options (but not nearly as good as Mr Tofu IMO), there's also a Korean place whose name escapes me, and Tiffany Coffee- because everyone needs a caffeine fix.

Service in each of these smaller counters is usually good, I've never had ordering issues despite only speaking English. Bus your own tables. On weekends, they can get backed up with dirty dishes toward the back of the dining area.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,3,XDSsuHaJNAjFf2hL9pKE9A
2506213,2016-08-12,0,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"So the selection of vendors is slim pickings but ton's of food on their menus. But if you know what you want to eat well the place won't be a let down. There's Korean food, sushi, Vietanmese and a little coffe shop too. A lot of the places accept cards using a square reader. 

My favorite place there is Pho Thien Huong. The Pho is on point! And the Pork Vermicelli is so delish even my dtr loves it and she never usually eats it.",wyUim9ksQtNF-r-0kZIO0A,1,0,4,NTqvPBw2KXvK2qQw3Y9Dog

3114640,2017-01-05,3,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"If you're craving for some quick Korean food, but not sure what to get, this is the place to go!

Greenland Supermarket in Korea Town became one of the main Asian grocery store my fam and I go to. Having an awesome food court here is a plus! There are quite a few vendors to choose from and each one has their own specialty menu.

Hot Tofu is one of our faves and it's the one we mostly go to. You can choose between meat, seafood, or mushroom tofu soup. They also serve different types of rice dishes. 

Sakura Sushi is good too and is pretty much all in its name. Their menu consists mainly of sushi items, soup, and salad. 

The newest vendor that opened up serves Vietnamese food, such as Pho, the popular noodle soup of Vietnam. Although, I wouldn't recommend coming here for just that.

But whether it's for dining in or taking it to go, K-Town's food court is a great place to stop by for a quick bite!

Pro-tips:
-Some of the vendors may accept cash only while others have a minimum charge when you pay with a credit card",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,9,6,4,AFs8z8mjIKJXEKDFi5KfLg

5333669,2015-11-10,1,LU8lZgIBkocPkrradywauA,"Great food court located inside of Greenland Supermarket at Korea Town. The 7 or so outlets allow for a quick, delicious and affordable dining option. The majority are Korean food but they have a Japanese and Vietnamese outlet as well and a cafe. I really like the Tofu soup w/beef from Hot Tofu but items from the Japanese outlet at Sakura Sushi are noteworthy. The service have been really consistent but at times it can get really busy especially on the weekends.

The best thing about this place your able to buy entree or dish at various outlets to create your own quick service meal.",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,2,2,4,nFNzW9iq81tlfaQgQLbY0g
