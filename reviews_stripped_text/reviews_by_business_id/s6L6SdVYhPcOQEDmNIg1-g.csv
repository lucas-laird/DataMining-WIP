I was in the mood for some Chinese lunch special that day plus it close to my house so been on the radar. It gives me something to review! lol! The first impression is interesting the interior. The counter area that looks more like deli then Chinese restaurant. Outside of the counter area is nice got aquarium, couple artwork along the walls, one wide screen tv, and overall pleasant atmosphere dine in. 

The menu is pretty straight forward I feel with typical Chinese menu nothing really exotic or out of the box. The lunch specials is normal you get egg roll, egg drop soup, drink, and choice of entree. Fried rice or white rice. All for bargain under ten dollars. I ended up going with the Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. I really enjoyed!! There was nice amount of chicken and the best part is tons of vegetables all cooked perfect al dente plus nice mixture. There been times had other Chinese lunch specials that mixed vegetables only one or two different ones. Here you get wide range from bell peppers, carrots, celery, and more. The sauce is solid. Overall nice portion even the rice not small perfect little scoop but full one. Not sure about the rest of the menu if the Chicken with Vegetables is any indication there lot more of the menu on my radar...

The service was excellent. They were very attentive the whole time. Friendly.

I went over to order something from Pizzalicious but they had closed early.  I noticed that the Chinese food place had a new name ""Happy Wok"", did another Yelp search, and it had overall positive reviews so i decided to give it a try. 

Ordered food to go for my boyfriend an I. Prices were very reasonable. Each entree came with the choice of fried rice or while rice. Picked the Mongolian Beef and Tomato Beef plus a large order of the Egg Drop Soup. Took about 15 minutes to complete the order, so not too long of a wait. Went home and had one of the best experiences with Chinese take-out. The Tomato Beef was in a puree of tomato with lots of cut pieces of tomato. As a tomato lover, I was impressed. Mongolian Beef was nothing short of a nice spicy kick! You can tell that the chef really cares about his food, which is something you don't really see in Chinese take-out at all. Oh, and the fried rice portions are off the charts! We still haven't finished a complete box. 

Overall great experience and delicious cheap to go food.

When I came here this past weekend (on Saturday), the old man working (and the only person that I saw working) was very kind and happily took my order.

You basically order at the cash register first, and take a seat and wait for the food to come out.  My girlfriend and I both got the lunch special, which is probably one of their best deals.  For $7.99 you get an entree with rice or chow mein, an egg roll (vegetable), egg drop soup, what seems to be wonton chips and a sweet red dipping sauce, and a drink.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef and the food was delicious.  The beef was tender and carried so much flavor, the chow mein tasted amazing.  I love how the chow mein was all noodles and not a mixture of veggies and noodles. 
 This isn't your typical Chinese restaurant where food is sitting around and you just order and grab the food.  The food comes out fast, and fresh.  Best of all, the portion is large and fills you up rather quickly.

I was looking forward to a nice glutton like meal. I was famished. Unfortunately, as I type this review up, I can still see my un-eatable food just sitting there

First thing I ordered was their BBQ Pork: Pork was tough and flavorless and drenched in some kind of honey sauce. I could only stomach less than half; I gave the rest to my dog who seemed to enjoy it. Hooray for him

Moving onto their Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles: Oversalted, no flavor, and NOTHING like the actual HK style sauce. They vegetables that are traditionally found in the HK style noodles weren't even there. Abhorrent dish, they should be ashamed.

Lastly, I ordered the Beef Chow Fun. Flavorless. Period.

Extremely disappointed. The owners should be ashamed to call this Chinese food and the cooks either need to learn how to cook Chinese food (HINT: It's about the flavors, NOT drenching things in Soy Sauce or Salt) or get their taste buds examined.

Except there was just one other party besides us, who commented on the lack of music (it was weird because it was quiet). It was raining and cold.

Hubby did not like it. The food was lacking flavor. No seasoning. I added some hot sauce on the table and it was fine for me (in the beginning, thought it was ok). Hubby added lots of salt to make it palatable. After we finished, I thought, ""I miss Great Wall."" Life's too short for lackluster food. 

There was a big aquarium, that was nice. There were white planter pedestals. Kind of mish-mash decor, didn't make any sense. Tile floor, I think the drapes were sheer or had some weird print on it, was it polka dot or striping, I can't recall. 

The kicker was that hubby witnessed our server leaving the bathroom, and could clearly hear the flushing (remember, no music, nothing) but was out the door (before the flushing finished). He didn't wash his hands! Gross.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,2,vwi2siefhkrN5_SV-hHbKA

We order delivery from here all the time.

We received a menu in the mail after they changed owners/managers from the last incarnation (Chengs) that included some coupons for free eggrolls, crab rangoons, etc.

All of my roommates and I feel that the quality of the food is really good for Vegas.  Its hard to find decent Chinese food here in town.

Some of my favorites:
The Mongolian Delight:  Shrimp, beef, and chicken with veggies in a delicious brown sauce, with a small bit of heat to it.  Really amazing.
The salted fish and chicken fried rice:  sounds gross, tastes great.  Little tiny bites of a salty fish mixed with chicken fried rice...I don't even need soy sauce on this rice, it is that good. 
The Crab Rangoons:  amazing.  Just as good as when it was Chengs.  Not quite as awesome as Kung Fu Thai, but REALLY good.  Creamy, with noticeable pieces of crab.
Wonton Soup:  YUM.  Rich broth, yummy wontons...this is all I crave when I don't feel well.  
The Beef egg roll:  Strangely better than the chicken egg rolls, and these reheat beautifully. 

Service was very polite, and their delivery is always within the time they quote or earlier for us.

5636419,2017-09-14,0,s6L6SdVYhPcOQEDmNIg1-g,"I've never been here. This review is based on my experience ordering delivery through Yelp Eat24. That said, from the pics posted here, it looks like a typical, can't-throw-a-dead-cat, strip mall Chinese place. The menu is standard, typical and beige.

BUT

Everything I ordered was cooked fresh, seasoned perfectly, with none of those gunky, gooey sauces one usually associates with strip mall Chinese places. I will make tentative judgement that, among the Chinese delivery restaurants available from Eat24, this one comes in first! And the cost is very reasonable, the portions generous.

Out of all that I ordered, I think I enjoyed the wonton soup the most. The wontons were light, not chewy, and the filling was perfectly proportioned and not heavy at all. But it was the broth, a lovely, clear and golden broth that was fragranced rather than flavored. Really a delight!

I enjoyed the lo mein as well. It was the reason I chose this restaurant tonight. I'm not a fan if chow mein or chow fun, for one reason or another, and Happy Wok is the only place I could find it. The lo mein here was a touch greasy, but not annoyingly so, and while it didn't reek of it, the garlic came through very nicely. A tad short on the chicken, perhaps.

Chicken with snow peas, mixed vegetables, and chicken fried rice were also on our buffet table, all executed with skill. I usually find fried rice bland and have to add a ton of soy, but that wasn't the case here (okay, I added a touch, but not, like, a whole package.) the chicken was white meat, generous chunks, tender and not dry. The snow peas were still al dente, and there was a very nice assortment of veggies in the mixed.

I'm sure that there is better, more ""authentic"" Chinese food to be found at the many establishments that line Spring Mountain Ave, and some really good, but pricey, Chinese food on the Strip, but for delivery, I can heartily recommend Happy Wok!
