74738,2011-07-01,0,_Y7090jnL5EezPib1ZVF1A,"I've been going to this Cowboy Western themed Roadrunner Saloon for about 5 years. This is one of those places that I seem to visit in streaks then stay away for awhile. This location is famous, at least from my observation, for very high employee turnover. When I see this then I know that its actually a management problem. In fact, the issues that send me away from here is usually some new management idea change that in my opinion sucks. The one thing that keeps me coming back despite my frustrations is that I do enjoy most of their food. 

So I stopped by here for lunch today around 2:30pm. I'm guessing that who ever is the current manager might be reading some of the reviews here on Yelp. Over the years the service has varied greatly at this location. However on this day, the service was great. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who took us to our table then went to get our waiter. This is in contrast to some of my past experiences. I've been sat at a table in the past then the hostess took off back to her station without ever informing the server that a party has been seated. I tend to pick off beat hours when things are slow so not informing a server can be an issue. I'm glad she took the time to do this because I was actually in somewhat of a hurry today. The server promptly came over took our drink orders. He quickly came back with the drinks then took our lunch order. I ordered the Texas Dip which is made with sliced top sirlion, jack cheese, creamy horseradish sauce served with a side of Au Jus and french fries. The sandwich was delicious! The Au Jus usually comes very salty to me however their version wasn't as salty so I did dip my sandwich into the au jus a few times. The fries to me were terrible. I had 2-3 then left the rest. They were some kind of terrible fancy cut frozen fries. If management does read this then please take a drive over to Whiskey Dick's and order their french fries. That's how french fries are suppose to be made. Homemade, fresh & delicious! I'd gladly pay a little more to have great fries. 


Just a little warning if you go for late night dinner. This happened about 2 years ago. I'm not sure if this is still the rule here. I won't be going back for late dinners to find out either. However in the past they sent their servers home early no matter how many customers may be seated at the tables. I had gone here many times for late night beers and food. So this change was a little surprising and frustrating. This is one of those changes that sent me away from here for awhile. We went in one night around 11:00pm to have some beers and grab some food at a table in the bar section. After about 10 minutes, the manager getting off duty stopped by to let us know they had just sent home the last server and that we would have to go to the bar to order food. I was like really? Why would you do that? There are a lot people sitting at the tables. I counted over 25 customers sitting at the tables at that moment. I asked the manager why? Can't you make money with this many customers sitting at your tables? Heck, I know our bill typically runs $50-60 alone. They did not seem to care that the place was busy. I told the manager that we would rather take our business that night to another establishment that is focused on keeping customers happy rather than saving $20-30 in employee costs. Heck, if I was managing this place I would have stayed myself and served all these tables until it slowed down.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,0,0,4,UhIEHpFFRp_7vNVaYdtQ1A

No reviews yet?  Well, I'll start.  Road Runner's is actually several different restaurant operating under the same roof.  During the day, it's a casual family restaurant, serving western-themed American fare at moderate prices.  During weekends, it's a sports bar.  After 10 pm, it's a lounge populated primarily by twenty-somethings and the occasional video poker player.  Despite its identity crisis, it does all of these things pretty damn well.  The food is very, very good.  The complimentary corn bread muffins that they serve during dinner are so good they could probably charge for them (but I hope they never do).  The BBQ Tri Tips are my personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

The late night menu is more limited.  It's your typical bar food - burgers, nachos, quesidillas, but it also includes breakfast.  Speaking of late night, the crowd can be very unpredictable at Road Runner's after 10 pm.  You never quite know who's going to show up.  It can be hotel employees, slackers, rockers, punkers, emo's, jocks, frat boys, preppies, losers, winners, Jets, Sharks.  I've pretty much seen them all there.  You can go to Roadrunner's for almost any occasion and come out pretty satisfied.

Update: Downgraded from 4 stars to 3 stars.  Not sure what's going on with Road Runner.  The quality of their food has definitely dipped in the past year or two.  It's definitely not as tasty as before.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,1,1,3,ezZwU7zlNp5fOcWRkRlRTg

Turns out, it's a harmless little sports bar with Western flair and enormous t.v. screens.  Very cowboy chic.  Yee haw?

Anyways, the food is okkkaaay.  We ordered the chili, a wedge salad, and a cowboy bbq meal.  The chili was a bit boring.  Not spicy at all.  It did taste homemade, not canned, so they get points for that.  The wedge salad was your typical wedge salad.  They didn't screw it up (which would be difficult).

The bbq was meh.  Our plate came with chicken, beef brisket and ribs ($17.99). The meat was unfortunately dry and not that flavorful.  In fact, it was apparent they just poured bbq sauce on top of everything after plating.  I wouldn't order this again. Bad cowboys!

The fries that came with the pulled pork were still hard & not cooked all the way through. They had some flavor & I think they could have been really good had they been properly fried. My grandfather said the pulled pork didn't have a lot of flavor & the buns were so soggy that they couldn't pick them up to eat the sandwich . The BBQ sauce was too sweet & the pork lacked flavor. The cole slaw was flavorless soggy cabbage. Had someone come to check on us soon after the food was delivered we would have sent the food back. Definitely will not go back nor recommend.

So I trekked all the way to this location only to find out why it wasn't very popular in the first place...

I got the cowboy plate with choice of three meats, so I wouldn't have to come back and sample anything:

1) The beef brisket was awful.  Hard and chewy.  Even though it was sliced thin, it somehow managed to resemble rubber.

2) The pork brisket tasted bad.  I don't know whether it was the sauce or the leftover pork they selected to make this.  Yuck.

3) The pork ribs were of the sparerib variety, which means it was full of meat but kind of tough and dry.  Definitely the star of the show, but I wouldn't call it the best by any stretch of the imagination.

So there we go.  Some of the worst BBQ I've tried in Vegas, and believe me, I've tried it all.  Never again.

We made a meal of fried pickles and nachos. The nachos, while not a complicated dish, were expertly prepared, meaning there was not a dry chip in the pie tin. They were not miserly with the toppings and there was none of that ""bottom of the chips were neglected by the beans/cheese"" syndrome that you often encounter when an amateur is running the chip station. 

My Long Island Iced Teas were quite strong too. Which is why I probably ate fried pickles and nachos before bed. I will probably do it all over again tonight.

I was actually impressed that they had Angry Orchard: Crisp Apple on tap. Don't really see it that often. 

Our waitress made a few recommendations but because i just came from work i wanted to try something that didnt sound like the portion size was going to be pathetically small. Ended up grabbing the Grilled Beef Tips with a cup of chili.

The grilled beef tips were decent. There wasnt that much of a bbq marinated beef taste or even a heavy smokey taste associated with the grilling. Overall everything was subtle in taste. The beef i requested medium-rare and what i received was medium which is understandable as i dont expect a practical way to cook such small chunks to perfection without having to pierce a thermometer in there every minute.

The sides were about average. Broccoli and carrots which were steamed or boiled or even microwaved tossed in some butter. The potatoes were REALLY buttery which in turn made them undeniably good if not fattening.

The chili was actually pretty damn good. Nice chunks of tomatoes and beef, had a really nice flavor that wasnt too bland or overpowering but just right. 

Overall i would come here again because it's out of the norm for what i'm used to in a hang out spot or bar. The bar is nicely stocked with a few times i specifically look out for because it's what i drink and there's activities such as darts and bowling for a more interactive dining/drinking experience.

So we order our drinks (they were out of iced tea, which is what I drink...hot water + teabags + a few mins + ice = iced tea. Easy peasey folks).  Got out ammended drink order along with fried pickles. 

The pickles were nice and hot and crispy but even though I'm a spice addict drowning pickles (already salty since the literally live their entire pickle life swimming in brine) and then giving them a heavy handed seasoned salt blizzard wakes them almost too salty to be edible, yay for the dippin' sauce. 

Once the pickles were delivered I'm pretty sure the staff was being abducted by aliens cause there was no one to be found.  Almost 45 mins later our food arrived. He had the whiskey chili (pretty sure they have to just warm that up if its not already bubbling away in a chili pot.  

I ordered a turkey melt. It was supposed to be turkey, pepper jack cheese,  bacon, and avocado on GRILLED sourdough bread.  As far as restaurant vittles go a sandwich should be a no brainer.  My grilled/toasted sourdough had absolutely no color on it. The bottom was so soggy and the fried so limp and cold I am almost positive that my plate had spent a long time under the heat lamp (remember thay 45 mins we waited for a sandwich and a bowl of chili?) On top of that there were two small super thin pieces of bacon and two thinly sliced avocado.  The pepper jack had no pep. My fries were sad. 

All in all pickles were ok, he liked his chili, my sandwich was a total let down.  The service was great when she was actually talking to us but my boyfriend literally had to hunt her down outside to ask for our check.  And instead of bringing it right away...ten mins later when she was still not there I was sent to the car because the booth was uncomfortable.  All he had to do was get a box and sign his receipt...20 mins later he walked out. 

I love fried pickles but if you cant get a sandwich right and keep it on the heat lamp when the place isn't busy, we will take our money to a place who deserves it from great food and amazing service. 

Guess we will have to get our pickle fix at Hooters now.",BDoSVFfwpGqluwxpIkFtRQ,1,0,2,utopjagO4f4kzi-6QpypMw

It got pretty busy so our server, Jamie, was a little slow.  However, she was super friendly and since we were staying until the end of the game, it wasn't a nuisance that she was behind.  Plus, the manager was constantly walking around and checking on the tables which is a change from other places I've been where the manager just stands and does nothing.

It's has a lower bar area with pool tables and table bowling. Really cool bar stools and tables with huge booths. Upper area has nice size booths and tables for families and good views of the TVs above the bar. Ceilings got an outdoor look with clouds and lighting with very decorative with horses all the way around. 

We started with some house chili and mac n cheese. Both were good but we prefer the mac n cheese.  Oana had wedge salad and they forgot the bacon, took about ten minute to finally get the bacon. Alex had huge nachos and Jacob and I shared a huge full portion of ribs. Which were tender and sauce was good. We finished off with the Apple crisp, but was more apple than crisp. Mostly apples heated on a cast iron pan with tiny bit of crumb on top, very tiny bit, still good but not what you expect. 
 
Over all very happy we found this place. They do show every Denver Broncos game on Denver's local channel. I will be back probably in September to see the opener against Pittsburgh (my other favorite team) another win - win for me.

I was finally able to come here with my boyfriend one day for lunch when we were in the area. We parked, walked inside, walked down the short hallway, and were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us down at a comfy booth in the middle of the restaurant. The place was pretty empty, but I preferred it that way because it made the ambiance perfect for a nice lunch date with my boyfriend. 

I couldn't help but marve at all the awesome decor. They really went all out on the western theme. There were cow skin chairs, stars, cowboy hats, cowboy boots, leather, dark colors, bold patterns, lanterns, and cactus. To be honest, I don't normally like western themes, but they made it very modern, mellow, and cool here. 

We opted for the smoked bee brisket (house-made barbecue sauce, smashed chipotle potatoes and grilled corn on the cob) with a side of spinach and the blackened salmon fillet (rice pilaf, grilled vegetables and sweet corn-black bean succotash). 

While we were waiting for our food, we were brought a basket of mini cornbread muffins and butter. They were soo good! They had a light, crispy outer layer and a soft, warm inside. It was perfect with the butter!

Our food came and it looked very appetizing. My salmon was presented very nicely atop a bed of rice pilaf with succotash poured on top. Both plates were delicious! I loved my boyfriend's brisket. It was so tender and juicy and the housemade sauce was the perfect compliment.  We ended up trading halfway through our meals so we could both enjoy each dish. 

I'd love to come back here again. Either for another lunch date, to try out the bowling lanes, or just for a drink. It's a very chill environment and the staff is friendly.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,1,4,lzVmwWj4ZOXu2yw-H8tDNg

First: This location is a proud establishment rooting for the Denver Broncos.  I'm a Houston Texans fan and I could even look past that flaw for the fact that I love(D) the atmosphere and food.

Second: Don't order a Vodka/Red Bull.  They keep the can open and going for all orders and if you happen to order when the remaining Red Bull is old and flat...oh well, that's what you're getting.

Third: Some of the WORST customer service I have ever encountered in my life.  Specifically from Jennifer (at the bar) and most recently from Collette (also at the bar).  I assume both women are just miserable people or that Jennifer is unable to comprehend simple tasks like splitting an order up between four people rather than complaining to her patrons about it.  

Today, my manager paid for our lunch and called to place an order.  Unfortunately, she called the wrong location.  When we had already been there for fifteen minutes, waiting, and she began to get frustrated, Collette loudly informed my manager, ""look, this is your fault, not ours.""  My manager incredulously informed her that she never said it was her fault before she turned and left while I stayed behind and sarcastically thanked her for the superb custmer service.

3 stars for service: friendly but no hostess for several minutes at 6 pm on a Saturday
1 star for food

Here's what we ordered:
Guacamole: watery, seemed like it was from a can... Definitely not fresh and not tasty.

Fried pickles: the only part of them with any flavor is what comes from the pickles themselves- batter is completely tasteless and way too much per pickle

Carne Asada Quesadilla: spicy and flavorless. Only flavor was from the jalapeños. Really gross looking and greasy.

Chicken Club Salad: the only part of the salad with any flavor was the tomatoes- thank God for that contribution. The chicken was so dry and flavorless, I only had a few bites and decided it wasn't worth the calories to eat something so bland.

Kids chicken fingers and French fries: this was BY FAR the best thing we ordered, despite the fries being soggy and seasoned with herbs but still amazingly bland and I'm quite sure the chicken fingers are your run of the mill frozen, boxed variety that the restaurant orders pre-made and they just warm up.

My husband also got a side salad for the shockingly high price of $6.95. I get it if you're eating at a fancy steak house, but where a lot of entrees are priced at 8.95, 6.95 for a side salad is ridiculous. Anyway, that was also completely uninspiring and really over priced.

Get some decent LCDs and update the cowboy decor, nothing wrong with country but after a while even the cows go out to pasture.

Open patio is solid and the bartenders were friendly and entertaining.  And the beer selection still has a nice variety.  It was also nice to have the premium drafts comped after throwing some money at the machines without limiting it to certain taps.

It was pretty dead for a friday night but it worked out great for a nice time with a friend and grabbing a beer, much more relaxed feel than BJs where we hopped from earlier in the night.",AXToqRIfh_TF8PkZkQkw1g,0,0,2,JrFDBv3fP_ti6BQQWBxGjg

We were brought iced tea quickly and a basket with some corn muffins and butter.  Our server, Desiree, took our order promptly.  I got a cup of baked potato soup with bacon and chive topping.  It had a lot of cheese mixed in and it was excellent.  It didn't help with my cold much but it was worth the try!

For our mains, we each got the 6 ounce filet served with large potato wedges and a ramekin with creamed spinach and some browned cheese on top.  The seasonings on the potato wedges and the steaks were very tasty and the steaks were good like we ordered.  

We had the smaller steaks so there was room for dessert.  We should have shared.  They were very large.  My wife got the brownie with ice cream and I got the pecan and chocolate pie.  Both were very good.

A few things about the service.  Evidently there's only one person serving at the time we were there and we waited several minutes for someone to come to seat us.  Later, Desiree had to take care of all the tables and our wait for things was longer than need be.

I went last night (as I do almost every Wednesday) after kickball - it is the bar everyone goes to after games in my league. They offer a few drink specials for us, like a $5 margarita, a $5 shot, and some beer specials. The drinks are perfectly fine - I've always been satisfied - but they're nothing special. They all come in plastic cups (maybe this is only on Wednesday nights), which adds to the overall frat-party feel of the place.

It's the perfect setup for us on Wednesday nights, because they have a spacious inside where they setup a karaoke machine, and they also have a large outdoor area for playing flipcup and beirut/beer pong. It doesn't seem to have a lot of ambiance, but that could be because of the crowds of kickballers crammed in every time I am there!

Overall, it's a perfectly fine post-kickball bar, but I can't imagine ever wanting to go there on a non-kickball night. (Then again, I'm definitely not in the saloon-going demographic.)",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,0,0,3,eLQHuT4Ouqv9lLNGxQi1gg

I got quotes from a few places, Roadrunner Saloon is who my boss ultimately decided to go with. Since we had to put down a deposit for the party, we decided to eat there for lunch when we dropped off the check. 

Roadrunner Saloon is a western themed cowboy bar.... No big surprise there. I like how divided the space is... there is a nice patio when you walk in, an eating area with both booths and tables, and then a bar area with more seating options and even a couple bowling lanes! We didn't do any bowling on my first visit but perhaps during the party I will?

There was no hostess when we arrived, just a sign that said to seat yourself so we picked a booth in the eating area. Menus were brought out promptly, service slowed down a tad after that but I don't think anyone was working other then our waiter and the manager and it was never an excessive wait. 

When I was looking over the menu the baked potato soup jumped out at me, I wanted to try it but wanted something else as well. Our waiter let me substitute the fries that came with the turkey melt I was ordering for a cup of the soup for a small up-charge... I appreciate his willingness to work with me. 

Our group split the spinach dip to start, it was good but I have had better. The soup was a bit bland and my melt was a little greasier then I'd like but the avocado that came on it was great.

This is a great place to belly up to the bar or relax with some friends.  There is an outdoor fire pit for a more cozy, by the camp fire feeling.

Roadrunner has a generous selection of libations and, my favorite, PBR on TAP!!  Drink prices are right about average and a $20 bill can get your head spinning pretty well. The bar staff is great and has very little turn over.

My only knock on Roadrunner is the food... thus far.  Recently I had the Dr. Pepper Taco's.  Now... this sounds amazing, but from a culinary standpoint, a beast to pull off.  I am not quite sure what I was expecting, but I certainly did not get it.  When the plate came out the presentation was much more a fajita style dish than a taco.  In fact, I tried numerous times to make a taco out of my ingredients and failed.  The meat had a very sweet (I know, Dr. Pepper, but even this was a bit strong) glaze to it and was slightly tough.  There was little to no cheese provided, and I am a firm believer in ""when all else fails, drown it in cheese"".  The rest of my plate was drown in beans and rice.  Not that this is an issue, but it was not expected on a taco plate.  The price was a bit steep as well, right around $14.  If rating off the food alone, I would be compelled to give them 2 stars, but the atmosphere definitely helps their case.

Not to accuse all of their food of failing to meet expectations, I have also had a hamburger from Roadrunner.  While it certainly surpassed the Dr. Pepper Taco's, it is not a reason to come back.  

The only other tip would be to avoid this place around 10pm on Wednesday nights.  The kickball league comes in, and while they are all really cool, it turns into a 3-ring circus with very long wait times.",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,1,1,4,QWs3jNZNStmMss7CZPgLwg

I always see this place exiting Flamingo off 215 and the banner advertising $5.95 lunch everyday also caught my eye.  So my friend and I decided to check this place out because hey, who doesn't love a lunch special?

The lunch specials include: pulled pork sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, BBQ chicken pizza, burger and chicken salad.

Our waiter seated us and gave us menus - we had to ask him for the special lunch menu.  He takes a few minutes to bring that over and my friend and I decided to share the pizza and pulled pork sandwich.  Our waiter was super slow throughout our whole dining experience here.  Slow enough to the point that you and your friend look at each other like, ""Hey, it's been a while since we ordered. Wow, this is slow!""  

So we get our food after ~20 minutes and was it really worth the wait? The BBQ chicken pizza was ~6  inches...4 small slices of tasty, but small pizza.  The pulled pork sandwich at least came with a side of wavy fries.  Both meals were okay, nothing to rave about, nothing special. 

Honestly, don't order the pizza for your lunch, you will be so sad, it's like a kid's meal...if even that.  If you are going for the lunch...I guess the pulled pork sandwich would be okay.  Their sandwiches probably at least come with fries. 

I honesly don't think I would come here again on my own will.  Roadrunner, you will be remembered for your slow service!",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,1,1,3,ZSq9CE3XaB_EVDUXKlrdIw
5199556,2010-09-29,3,_Y7090jnL5EezPib1ZVF1A,"New rule: any establishment that has a nice patio automatically gets 3 stars because you can't really mess up beer, and if you can sit outside and enjoy a frosty bev that is noteworthy in Vegas. Apparently, bars want us inside giant, dark boxes feeding video poker machines, so kudos to those that actually let us escape into the sunshine and fresh air. 

Road Runner does just that, and they do it well. Their patio is quality with open fires, lots of space, and a swing. Yes, a swing. The only bad thing is that there isn't really a view, but given the location, this may be a bonus because the only real view to be had would be of cars zooming down the road.

One other odd attraction is a couple of mini-bowling lanes behind the bar. It isn't cheap, but it is a novelty perhaps worth trying.

As for the food, we stuck with the nachos, and they were ok. The ingredients seemed fresh, but I prefer nachos with cheese sauce or at least a solid effort at equal cheese distribution. These had shredded, melted cheese, which never quite delivers the perfect cheesy nacho bite.

We got a happy hour ad in the mail, so we decided to go.  The advertised happy hour $2 drafts applied only to PBR (NOT stated in the ad).  We ended up getting a pitcher for $8. Not a great deal for Pabst.  To add insult to injury, the beer was also completely flat.  
The advertised happy hour ""premium drinks"" for $4...were just domestic beers!  $4 for a pint of bud light, during happy hour, really!? 
We decided to get some food, because their happy hour apps were listed as half off.  Of course this only included half of the appetizers on the menu, even though no restrictions were stated in the ad.  We got sliders, and chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders used to be amazing here, but these were obviously the kind you buy frozen in bulk, and reheat.  Ew.  The fries that came with them were crinkle cut, pale, soggy, and inexcusable.  The sliders were mediocre.  We paid $4.50 (happy hour half off price) for just 3 of them, and they didn't even come with fries.  I can only imagine how ripped off I would have felt if I paid the full price of $9 for each for these crappy appetizers.  It took the server a full hour to remove our empty glasses, and dirty plates from our table.
I've dealt with slow service here before when it was busy, and I was sitting outside.  When I'm sitting inside, 3 feet from the bar, I generally expect a little more.
Roadrunner used to have awesome service, and great bar food.  I never had any issues paying full price here before.  Unfortunately, since they decided to cut back on service, and quality, I won't be coming back.  Not even at half off.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,3,2,1,K69SKJ6VVKZXEMahiNIGFw

This place is hardly crowded and the drinks are always awesome.  Where else can you do mini-bowling?  Love it!!",705jaiZrlRdSidwGEIGFsA,0,0,3,l28x_-OmZGHK6DDR04vgBg

In my head, I thought this would be more like Stoney's with room to dance, fun upbeat music, and a cool environment. The atmosphere is neat, very country chic, and I liked the pool tables and bowling in the back. However, I wasn't too impressed with the bartender (blonde girl with black framed glasses). She seemed annoyed any time my friends went up to order a drink. We planned on staying for a couple hours to chill and enjoy our girls night, but the music was so depressing after 30 min we had to go. When they played upbeat tunes, we were having a blast by the pool tables singing and dancing, but for 20 min straight it was slow depressing want to go cry in your car during a rainstorm music. We all started yawning and the night started to drag on. At that point we knew it was time to go. Too bad the music sucked because we would have stayed much longer, invited more friends, and probably would have ordered a couple rounds of shots. Oh well.",clfMJXcza4OYBhblR0e2bw,0,0,2,HUF4T15B_Vc2FewvK3MEQA

Very cozy bar, has 2 pool tables, a few game machines like ping pong, mini bowling alley (which I thought was pretty awesome), and the outside patio had 3 fire pits with swigs, it was very nice. We didn't eat but ordered a few drinks and they were a bit pricey and as much as I loved the atmosphere not sure if this will be a regular spot for us.",siyqiHxrf3sedw9vf9vN1A,1,0,4,re7_SLoLWHzgEfd-hQBCig

Sadly, the service is slow (so slow we had to leave our table to go to the bar to get another drink). The bar charged us a different price for our drinks then the server did! We asked our server to get us a manager. Although we were there for a hour after we asked to see a manager..they never came to the table, nor did the server to offer us another drink. The game even went into over time and we sat there with empty cocktails.",DMhQtG7o_yfrXJTFJmz4xQ,0,0,2,BLHd1-W1TKPuX7sgdiokBg
