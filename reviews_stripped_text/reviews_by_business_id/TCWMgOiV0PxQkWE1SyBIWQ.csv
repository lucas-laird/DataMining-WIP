The food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order ""enough"" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch. 

If you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. If you're a 20 or 30-something and want a party atmosphere and don't care about the bill, this could be fun for you.",Te1y5afUMwaTe62ZiB8Igg,2,0,3,Q6RiVtAINLhMIE-7wRST4w
4367,2007-10-06,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"YES! I finally dined at Nobu, considering it was Iron Chef, Masaharu Morimoto's restaurants when he won the challenge. Ok, this is not the original restaurant where he worked (that is in NYC) but this is a branch of it. According to Wikipedia, he left Nobu in 1999, eventually opening his own Morimoto restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001. So I will eventually eat at Morimoto.
Nobu was a good experience, although as other yelpers pointed out, why was this in Hard Rock Cafe (seemed kinda out of place) and the kitchy Hawaiian decor, the decor lost one star in my books.

The miso cod was heavenly and so was the tuna tartare with caviar. The roll we had was good as well. Pricey but definitely quality sushi.",Ud6j2HN40qEhycq2PuwcBA,1,1,4,U8QA_6LKzpkUUbUCguTmDQ

This place should not share the same name with its counterpart in New York. The latter is the real deal. This Vegas place is the real steal. 

My wife and I got the omakase - just as we has in New York. However, there was no progression / logic or thought in the Vegas parade of dishes. It seemed that random servers would simply drop stuff on our table with a quick description. In New York, we had one attentive waiter who would explain the dishes as they were delivered and really seemed to know what he was talking about.

I don't know what it is about the Vegas knock offs...Bouchon was dissapointing as well. Word to the wise, go for the real Nobu deal when you are in NYC. In Vegas, get the lame-ass buffet. You are there to gamble anyway.",m7K-vHOY4qeb_pM3PiZKTg,0,0,1,rIBXpNmuwkPRocS7pIC1IQ

I'm sure everyone else has told you to get the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi and the miso cod.  We also really enjoyed the beef tenderloin, it was so tender it felt like sashimi, but with the deliciousness of steak.  We also got a couple tempura things that were very good.

I was also very impressed with the service.  We were at first confused because of the casual atmosphere and high prices, but I actually think this is great.  The service was still impeccable despite the casual tone, and it made us feel at ease, unlike many other restaurants with such high quality food.  

I was very impressed that the small plates came out in a well thought-out order.  So often at a small plates restaurant your meal will feel harried because a bunch of things arrive at once or things arrive in an order that doesn't suit the meal.

Wow, that is all I can say. Each and every dish tried was to die for. 

Don't get me wrong, it cost us a fortune- we had a large group and they serve small plates. So naturally we ordered a LOT of plates. But I swear, it is worth splurging here.

We had an awesome waiter! He was funny, friendly, and made great recommendations. He advised us on how to use the menu and where to start. 

Our favorite dishes were the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, and one more sashimi dish (I can't remember what it was called!) They were perfectly simple and fresh. They weren't drenched in sauce like many other sushi bars you experience. I'm pretty sure I could have eaten this for the rest of my life.

56976,2011-02-17,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Went here on Valentine's Day for a company function and I am going to say--hands down--the best japanese food/sushi in my entire life! None of the dishes disappointed me and I couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on. 

Supposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. The waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. I went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat. 

This is what we had:

-Edamame
-Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno
-Rock Shrimp Tempura with Cream Spicy Sauce
-Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu
-Black Cod Miso
-Chilean Sea Bass with Dried Miso
-Beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot
-Mushroom soup
-Pickled Sushi Platter  
-Sushi platter
-Ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg)
-Fish egg sushi with quail egg
-Sweet potato and avocado tempura
-Dessert: Chef's Tasting Platter

Alcohol: I had a mango martini--delicious! I don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. Good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!

Some highlights of the meal: 
-The seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality I've had. My top favorite was the black cod miso and the chilean sea bass. Melt in your mouth HEAVEN. 
-Beef tenderloin was perfection--I love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody. 
-I did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. You only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at Nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. Bottoms up!

I'm so glad I went with a company because there is no way I would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. Nobu is great and I would gladly go back if I had the chance!",kg8tWKYrB9I6VThlxTaD-A,1,1,5,I59HCP4-5OvnlHI8vDlWPA

The sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! The inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. The sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. The spicy tuna roll is different from any other place that I've tried. It does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. Also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. The rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. Some things that I recommend are the yellowtail jalapeno... it is to die for. The yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. The black cod miso is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. The rock shrimp tempura is really good as well. They also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. The lychee martini is really good!

Nobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. If you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. It's a hot spot.

Try Nobu and you won't be disappointed but I have to say again, don't be cheap!!! Enjoy the ambiance and the great food.",0vDhTzPuthUI_34EUH6v_Q,0,0,5,WyM1xYg-Dh917V3SzI-YMQ

We started with the yellowtail with jalapenos and cilantro. The jalapenos are an interesting departure from the wasabi we are so familiar with.  I only like a little bit of heat, but I actually wanted more than the thin slices offered.  We each had an order of sunomono (cucumber salad), which were quite large.We ordered the black cod as a hot dish. I would come back in order this again and again and again. We ordered the chef's choice for sushi for two... which was your usual assortment. The tamago was sweet and had the restaurant name seared into the top.  

The food was very good, the ambience was nice, my Asahi was on tap, but you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino to use the restroom, and the prices were quite high.

Also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. Those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. We ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. The following are dishes I had sampled.

Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Tuna & Scallop - The chips were crispy and not oily. The tuna was ok. The scallops were not. Something was off.

Shishito Peppers - I loved these peppers. They are full of flavor yet not spicy. I could snack on them all day. 

Mushroom Soup - This tasted meaty and delicious.

Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion Sushi Roll - I did not like this at all. The texture of the fish seemed off to me.

Sea Urchin Nigiri - The texture and flavor was ok.

Chicken Kushiyaki (Teriyaki & Anticucho) - Ok. A bit dry and overcooked. 

Teriyaki Tenderloin of Beef - Good.",nvST5G7qEvVCf5v64Ll7Ww,1,0,3,yyupaB7SprRbSDpgWtafig
114751,2009-11-02,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"It was a hit-and-miss experience at Nobu in Vegas.

Hits: Mixed seafood ceviche, sweet shrimps - new style sashimi, kumamoto oysters with Nobu sauce, Nobu style lobster tacos, Bluefin tuna tartar with caviar, and tiradito scallops.

Misses: Black cod with miso, house special deluxe roll, fried mai with sweet butter sauce.

Personal favorites are Bluefin tuna tartar and sweet shrimps - new  style sashimi. Presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and I have never had before. You will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.

The reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. To be honest, I strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. If you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. This place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.

118142,2010-11-11,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Skip Nobu if you've been to any other location. The atmosphere was very LA and kind of snobby. It's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. The menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. We decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). We chose the Lobster Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Tempura Roll and the Nobu Style Lobster Tacos to start. The tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. These composed the ""cold"" dishes that Nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included Kobe Beef Tataki style, Black Cod with Miso as well as some Sashimi. The Kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the Cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. Looking at the menu now I'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but I remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like I got real value from our money. The atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. The food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was.

The setting in this place is too loud. 
Food was ok.
We went for the omokase dinner - which starts at $100/person. This was a sponsored dinner, so these comments are void of any financial influence.

Tuna tartare on a lotus root chip. Decent - tuna was ok, not too fatty. The chip had some kick to it.
Back to back sashimi dishes. Boring. Fish was ok, but smothered in ponzu. 
Squid and mushrooms - quite tasty. Squid perfectly cooked. Earthiness to the shrooms.
Lettuce cups with miso cod and grilled scallop. The best dish of the night.
Some kind of spicy rock shrimp with a mayo dressing on top of a bed of greens. It wasn't bad, but not quite what I wanted. The greens were good.
Steak - not Kobe, but damned good. Heavily seasoned.
Finished with Calif roll and spicy tuna roll? Are you kidding me?
Beer and sake flowed; service was good. I ate here many years ago and the service was so bad, but this time they did well. 

We had fun as it was a group that hadn't been together in a long time and as I said I didn't pay, but I would say for the money, there is better food in Vegas and better sushi in many places.

149205,2007-08-04,5,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"In April, we went to Vegas and stayed at the Hard Rock.  I love that place.  That douchebag Simon has a restaurant there, right across the hall from Nobu.  We looked inside the newest entry into the highly competitive arena that is your mother's meatloaf and a chocolate shake for $35, and it reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria.  We were looking over the menu outside the door, which of course was a joke and not the least bit original, at which point the following conversation occurred:

Me:  Jesus what a joke.
Wife:  Yeah, it looks pretty lame.
Me:  I mean, really.  What a stupid ass restaurant.
Wife:  Yeah...  Well, Jon Bon Jovi likes it.
Me:  Yeah, well, Jon Bon Jovi is an asshole.
Wife:  (now in a hushed tone):  I mean, he just walked out the door and right by us....
Me:  Oh shit.
 
Fortunately, it would seem that he was out of earshot by that point.  More fortunately, it appears he left Simon in favor of heading over to Nobu.  Good call, that.
 
We did Nobu twice during our stay.  It was fantastic.  We did mostly just sushi, which was uniformly superior.  However, it is also supremely expensive, and it does have some of the trappings of a touristy restaurant as opposed to a true sushi bar; most notably the fact that it is not necessarily understood that an ""order"" of  ""sushi"" means two pieces.  This can be disconcerting when you get the bill and discover that the toro, which is unbelievably and deliciously oily to the point that it seems suspended between solid and liquid states, cost you $15 PER PIECE.  Not per order, PER PIECE.  

I have NEVER had an order of sushi that expensive, and in my mind, no sushi is worth that price.  And I have been to the now relocated-to-New-York Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills (afka the most expensive restaurant in LA).  There, their equally top-notch toro was a mere $15 per ORDER, a la carte.

In our second visit, we wised up and didn't order the especially pricey items and still had a terrific experience.  I have no complaints about the place, other than the price.  The chefs were very attentive, accommodating, and friendly.  The waitresses were a little hard to flag down at time, however.

Nobu LV is at least as good as its counterpart in New York, as well as Matsuhisa in LA, and I believe better than Nobu Malibu, all of which I highly recommend.

My only issue the level of foodieness that is the norm here; I don't eat any grains, soy, or dairy (yeah I know don't eat sushi right?!?) and at some sushi places they will make rolls with cucumber instead of rice.  Not here - they were very helpful in terms of switching sauces and advising against dishes that could not be 'tampered' with but overall it was a bit of a chore to choose wisely.  That being said the quality of ingredients was awesome; that is why i eat sushi...i like fresh fish.  We had some hot dishes too...totally forgot what but loved every bite.

I want to leave the table full and buzzing and humming about how awesome the food was. This meal was, frankly, lousy.

Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus, which overpowered the fish. Isn't fish supposed to be the showpiece of a good sushi restaurant? And, honestly, that's the only real takeaway I had from this meal. Too much citrus. Everything.

I went to Vegas to eat here... I was expecting to spend alot of money too. 

However... when i walked in, the resturant looks nice and hipp, was pretty busy for a monday night. We made reservation but they tried to sit us in same booth right next to another customer so we decided to sit at sushi bar. 

Server was super friendly, knew his menu well, sushi chiefs were all Japanese and friendly/helpful as well. 
I ordered one of recommendation from the server, and Toro Tara to start with, still excited! 
I got bit suspicious when toro tartar came from kitchen, instead of sushi bar, it looked amazing with ice, caviar, lil bamboo shoot garnish and side of Yama-momo japanese plum. 
When I see the actual Toro... I was more suspicious because of the color of the fish... it just didn't look like toro to me at all...
I took a bite hoping to hop with joy, instead i had to look at my dish again...
to make sure it was BLUE FIN TORO TARTAR....
I swear, its a scam, i had blue fin toro and good toro many times in my life time, but it is not a blue fin toro! It tasted like regular crappy tuna grinded up like a baby food. 
argh... you don't understand the disappointment... coming all the way from phx to eat at THE NOBU... and this is what i get. =/ 

I had Uni sashimi, which was not that fresh, not so bad but for the price they charge, it should been better, Negi-toro was decent, it was real toro at least, not Tartar baby food crap. 
King crab ceviche was just too sour... killed the flavor...
after that, i didn't want to try anything else, but i had kabocha desert... which just tasted like normal pumpkin cake instead of japanese kabocha... 

presentation was well done, its really beautiful, sushi chiefts are nice, and so are staff there but  food...  
just dose not match the price of reputation. come on NOBU-san, you can do little bit better than that =/ 
I wish i ate at yellowtail or Shibuya instead, I will NOT be going back here again...

The Bluefin toro Tartar was really fatty which I love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. With the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food I have had. 

If you go I would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. You can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. Also, the black cod with miso was sooooooo good. The fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when I put a fork to it.

Highlight of my trip to LV last wkend! All I have to say, is ""Wow!"" 
I'm impressed & amazed w/the chef's creation :0 

$100+ per person for Omakase course (we ordered mostly sushi).

Below are some of the stuff I ate: 
Red Snapper w/Shiso + Salt  (Very light & delicious) / 
Halibut w/Green Onion & Ponzu-type sauce (:d) / 
Ootoro (OMG, it melted in my mouth :d) / 
Live Octopus + Octopus Wasabi side dish (not too spicy & light) /
Trout w/ Jalapeño (nice kick of hotness; interesting) /
Tobiuo + Ginger (Flying Fish; Sorta sticky...interesting) / 
Squid w/Tomato Flakes (Chef said, ""The most expensive kind of Squid"" - very concise & easy way to describe the ingredient :p) / 
Negi-Toro Roll (Fatty Tuna & Scallion Roll - Orthodox but good!) /
Uni (Sea Urchin - so-so, actually not too great; this was my least fav) /
Miso Soup (Just Ok) / Abalone + Liver (Pretty Cool) / 
Kinmedai w/Sakura no Ha (Splendid Alfonsino w/a Leaf of Cherry Blossom - Awesome, my fav! Nice aroma) 
Unagi w/Yuzu (Eel w/Citron - Interesting to have it non-kabayaki) /
Anago (Sea Eel -Too Sweet for me :0) / 
Yamaimo w/Shiso & Umeboshi (Yam w/Shiso & Japanese Pickled Plum; very sour & salty - Nice way to finish the meal! Light & Refreshing!) I don't think they used Nama-wasabi, but I didn't mind. 
I know it's catered to non-Japanese, but they definitely can make a better green tea. 

Other pros: Nice Decor & interior Design. No waiting time (although we came here pretty darn early; so, that may be why). I didn't really have that much issue w/ noise (like some other yelpers were saying). Great service (very attentive)!

Long story short, if you're thinking about visiting this place, 
ordering some California Roll, Tuna Roll, or your regular Tuna, Salmon, & Yellowtail Sushi are waist of your money. I felt so sad to see some people next to us eating such thing & paying so much for their dinner. You can get those anywhere for a decent price w/any restaurants, unless you're going to places like Rio's Seafood Buffet (Their sushi taste nasty! Although everything else tasted good :p).

now for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. And when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. 

*the YK50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light
*shishito peppers - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame
*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.
*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.
*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p
*sashimi salad. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix
*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.
*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.
*tempura plate. the vegetables were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)
*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance.

1. New style sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  S.B. and I both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  One suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...
2. Confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  I asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  We settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.
3. The format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete with teriyaki chicken, salad, and tempura!

Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  I guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a Japanese restaurant.  It was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.

I'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  Keep in mind this -is Vegas, people.  After checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels I'd say Nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.

The only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  The clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.

397884,2008-09-18,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Just got back from Nobu. I sat at the sushi bar and ended up a little tipsy-er than expected. Even so, here is the review:

Their specialty dishes are really very good. I got both the Toro & Caviar dish and the Live Scallops. Yes. I really did pay $40 for the Toro and Caviar. Was it worth it? At least once. All of their normal sushi stuff was fresh and good, but to be honest, there are a million other sushi places that offer fresh, raw fish for a lot cheaper. So my suggestion? If you are going to go there, make sure to try at least a couple of the specialty dishes.

Decor seemed fine...I was more interested in the lightning hands with uber sharp knife sushi chef. He was not only super cool to watch, but also offered some superb suggestions, even though he clearly only understood a tiny bit of english. Ultra attentive wait staff...maybe even a little too attentive, but I think that is because chairs are so close together at the sushi bar that you can't have more than 1 plate in front of you at a time. In other words, if you didn't have an ultra-attentive wait staff, you wouldn't be able to order more food.

What keeps this place from 5 stars? PRICE. Wicked expensive. Like super-wicked. I know you expect to pay a bunch for good sushi, but this is pretty high. Drinks run $15, specialty items run $20-$40, and any other nigiri hangs at around $10. Though, you should be scared when you notice the no price dillio on their website.I had a great meal for sure, but I don't know if it would be worth $130 again.

I went alone, and didn't feel odd at all. I'd love to say that I'd be back, but the things that could hold me back are the price tag, and the lack of proximity to the strip. That being said, if you are getting some cost assistance (biznass trip), and are staying somewhere close (say...the Alexis Park Hotel), then I'd go for sure.",Byo0hbnRlg0pRTUpZDYJfQ,0,0,4,pGuszoH_QPJQoM2GRXqB2w

Came here on a Vegas trip with one of the girls and this was our first stop! We dolled up, drove to the Hard Rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.

Service-Great! Everyone was really attentive. I always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. The food came in really good timing as well. I was starving going in and I didn't have to wait. Although coming from a restaurant like this I didn't expect anything less.

The decor is really comfy and not as fancy as I'd originally thought (or the other Nobu restaurants apparently). You can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. While there were only small groups there they had some large tables and some hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.

Now onto the best part of all! Fooood is so worth the price!!
Dessert: lemme start with this one because I cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious HOME MADE ice cream with toasted pecans. Their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means I'm going to have to come here every season :)

Apart from that we enjoyed the black cod miso, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (not spicy and very fresh!), japanese snapper dry miso (the garlic chips added great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake mushroom salad (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)

Hot food: Tried the Sea Bass w/ Miso sauce, Teriyaki Tasmanian Sea Trout Skewers (Very similar to Salmon), and Shrimp Tempura.  All very very good, especially the Bass and Trout. 

Sushi: Fish was the freshest around.  However, I was very disappointed with the lack of creativity.  I asked my Sushi Chef for anything unique that they do with their sushi.  Got a blank stare.  I'm used to the unrelated and not-so-famous Nobu's in Solana Beach, CA where creativity is more common than not, and what a difference it makes.  

Service was incredible.  It felt as if they are standing behind you waiting for your every need.  I suppose you have to order off the specials if you want something creative (non-sushi), but you'll be paying a premium $30 to $75+ per plate.

640456,2011-08-05,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a huge self-admitted sushi addict and my husband is Peruvian, so Nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  Aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. 

We started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and I've had a similar dish at several excellent Bay Area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that I've had. The sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome added bonus (honestly, I've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in Vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. 

Next, we tried the Tiradito Nobu Style with some type of halibut like fish.  Now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  My husband says this is exactly what Tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in Peru.  It was amazing.

We then moved on to the Black Cod Miso next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that I was underwhelmed by.  I know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at Nobu, but I've had a very similar dish at both Morimoto Napa and at Hyakumi at Cesar's Palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that I have come to expect from the dish. The flavor was right on, and if I'd never had black cod before, I would have loved it.  

So, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the New Style Salmon Sashimi (new style because it's served with ginger, and some other amazing deliciousnesss that I can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the Toro Green Onion Maki (Cut).  They were both amazing. 

What shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two desserts we had were.  We tried the bento box, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea ice cream, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger ice cream.  I don't know if anyone else finds some green tea ice cream to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this ice cream was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  The warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger ice cream was a highlight of my whole trip to Vegas.  (And I'm not really a dessert person)

Okay, this review is way too long, and I didn't even mention the impeccable service.  I can't wait to go back and wish there was a Nobu in the Bay Area.",UvAcTvFh8XmzkEHDDCwftw,1,2,5,C6s14_WzG_5aKfEuHmjTiw

The restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  It would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.  

I ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  I made it known to my server that I eat ""Kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, Tuna, white fish, etc, No shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.""   

The hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  They told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. The warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  Stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  It wasn't worth it for the price.   

The fiasco really started when I was given miso soup with shells in it!  That type of error should NOT happen.  It was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that I was not allergic.  While she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  I had to suggest a discount.  I think that it should have been immediately offered.  To the manager's credit she did ask if I had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.

It will start subtly, build up anticipation, then rock you with the chorus, keep you there for a while, and slowly let you down.  This is true of any good thing, a good book, a good time, a good movie, and life if you do it all right.  If you understand this principle, then the same is applicable with a good meal.  I made the mistake ordering the Chef's Choice during my one and last visit to Nobu on one of my many excursions to Vegas.  The anticipation of eating here is enough with all the effort required just to get in the door of this place.  When you do walk in, you will be dazzled.  Everything is beautiful here, the paint on the walls, the sculptures you'll pass on your way to being seated, the kitchen, the staff, and even the patrons.  And when you finally do get your first course, you will feel as if you just might be taken to a place you have never been before.  It is so good.  But then the rest of the meal just doesn't follow the principle mentioned above.  The order of things was wrong.  Some courses didn't build on the last.  By the time you finish the last course, you can't remember the first.  Because taken as a whole the meal is forgettable.  Now my friends that ordered entrees coupled with various sushi plates, their meals were wonderful.  But it is a big disappointment especially since the Chef's Choice is Nobu's flagship dish and most expensive item.  You are ultimately left with an empty experience afterwards.  Which is the case with the whole experience at Nobu.  It ended up being empty which had a lot to do with the content of my stomach after the meal.  As it too was empty.  I can see where Nobu get's its reputation.  You'll be able to see this too when you walk into this place.

The place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  Our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  I ordered the Omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:
1) Toro tartare with caviar - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!
2) 4 different sashimi dishes - Japanese red snapper, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. I left Nobu with a very strong Ponzu aftertaste
3) Black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  The sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  
4) Tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - I really regret asking to have this well done.  Doh!
5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.

The waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  I found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  Nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  You see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  The predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local Cabarets.

Bottom line:  I'm glad I tried Nobu.  But, it'll be a long while before I come back especially when there are so many other options there in Vegas.",rayiYwfbOxiZnXGs8htXvQ,0,0,4,uP-X0hI_vnmV9Ny1RSdZvQ

OK, so first off, I have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was AMAZING!!  Everything you've heard about Nobu is true!  I read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent Vegas trip.
So we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  I ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  But I think the mango was the better of the two!  
So, me being a newbie on the sushi scene I was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be GOOD!!! OMG, even bf, who isn't really down with tuna, was floored.  The tuna had scallions in the middle I believe....whatever it was delish!  And the sauce it had was SOOOO GOOD, I don't even know what it was, I should've asked.  OK, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.
Next, we ordered the soft shell crab roll was again a mystery.  Was a very welcome bite to my mouth, I don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  The crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! 
Also on our table was the shrimp tempura roll, I know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  Never mind that, this roll was a fave!  I also ordered another plate of this little roll because I loved it SO MUCH!  Again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  The amazingness of this is too good to put into words......I AGAIN don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but I honestly feel like going there again, like NOW.  
So for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  It came out and looked like little donut holes!  Was so good!  They were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. Little bites of fried heaven!  
As for service-stellar! She was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when I asked about rolls.  That's OK, I walked out very happy!",oXrcIF_ZyQMQ5EeLCO1L-w,0,1,5,QxSdHODgpBdYWv4aXvOwuA

Thank God, because many Vegas restaurants are infested with smoke from the nearby casino.  lots of bamboo.  Club music.  Loud, people having fun.  No toilet as people have mentioned.


service - excellent, our waiter (Jonathan) was fast and efficient, and the entire staff was fast and efficient.  He did not wait for the 'water boy' to get us water, for example, they all did everything.  One of the faster staffs I have seen in Vegas.

Food - Very good, not out of this world though.  Regular sushi was good, but not better than anything you get in California, NY, or Boston.  You really come here for the fusion ""sushi"", which was very good (but not out of this world).

If you go you must ask for this as it is not on their menu. I also had the tempura fried rock shrimp in the creamy spicy sauce and again it was perfect, yummy, wow. 

For dessert we had the mochi ice cream. And as you can read in my review of Bubbies in Honolulu it probably would've been just as good or better to have gone to Whole Foods afterwards and picked some up. Still is was very good but not Bubbies.

My friend and I arrived earlier than everyone else and decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar. The bartenders were extremely friendly and had great suggestions of what drinks to order. Just the way they explained the ingredients in each drink made us want to try them all. Our favorite was the Cucumber martini (Finlandia Grapefruit Vodka, Fresh Cucumber Puree, Lychee Juice, Lemon Juice). The bartender also recommended the Spicy Acai Martini (Veev Acai Spirit, Acai, Passion Fruit Puree, Serrano Peppers). After making it for another customer he gave us some to sample and it was delicious. We will definitely be back for that drink

On to the food...

Yellowtail jalapeño: fresh yellowtail and just a slight but of heat from the jalapeño. Delicious.

edamame: pretty standard edamame. Nothing to write home about

Sushi: California roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Good fish, but not a stand out course

Rock shrimp: battered shrimp in a creamy spicy sauce. 

Miso black cod: favorite dish of the night. You really can't go wrong with black cod miso and Nobu has really nailed this dish. It was tasty and melted in your mouth. 

Bentobox dessert: this included homemade green tea ice cream, flour less chocolate cake, and Suntory Cappucino (Chocolate crunch, coffee cream, whiskey foam and milk ice cream). The Suntory Cappucino stole the show. There were so many flavors that went together so well and weren't too sweet. I would order this again by itself

Overall, it was worth what we paid because we were able to try out so many different favorite dishes they offered. They offer the full menu at the bar just in case you want to stop in without reservations. Give the Spicy Acai Martini a shot!",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,0,0,4,BJ_SsiO7nAPQdBtLKtSmmQ

You will not get either one at Nobu. I came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner, WHAT A SHAM.
I asked the sushi ""chef"" what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll. We said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok. I was not impressed at all. I was actually quite annoyed. I ordered some Uni and monkfish liver. Now when I order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot, I either get 2 pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi. At Nobu, I got one medallion-sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce. I was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite. I asked the chef what he has that's unusual and off the menu. He said the yellowtail or white tuna, you know, cuz NO other sushi place has that! I told him something a little more unique and he just didn't know what to offer. Finally he said live octopus. I ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me. I imagined it would've been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it.. anything. I have no idea where it came from or how it looked. It was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar-like sauce with green stuff and all I tasted was this crap all over it. 
I got the bill and almost ran the hell out! It was $198. FOR THAT CRAP! We ordered 4 lychee martinis which were good, not worth $56 for 4 of them.  TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS for the crab roll! $25 for the octopuss! $15 for the uni. I payed in absolute anger and disgust, left a 20% tip and got the hell out of there. 
Honestly, I am a harsh critic, I admit that. HOWEVER, I feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it. The food was SO not worth it. Anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn't be caught in this lame over-priced trap. It should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud-overdose sauce!

Good lord the shashimi was fresh and melt in your mouth. Also, I LOVED the fried salmon skin salad. The dressing was perfectly tart and the textures all worked well together. I loved it was all leafy green so I feel like I made a somewhat healthy choice. The fried snapper, the waiters favorite, was good but after a few bites it was just overwhelmingly greasy. My mom makes an Asian version but with sweet and sour sauce rather than miso based sauce. It would only be worth ordering if you had a party of 4 or more otherwise it's too greasy for two to share. The service was great but we were rubbing elbows with a couple on a date. It was a little awkward esp when I'm with mom haha!",TF0Ob0eEAIXtpFDzFBDfvQ,0,0,4,YA97Ocbbo8CsrX4rZdiJ9Q

I've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but I wouldn't know, because Nobu offers up so many unique South-American influenced Japanese dishes that I only order from their special items.  I recommend you do the same; you didn't come to Vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?

The star of the menu is the Broiled Black Cod with Miso.  When you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  Also great are Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, New Style Sashimi, and Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing.

I attended with a good friend of mine who has ALWAYS raved about their cucumber martinis.  Each time I would go out to eat with him at ANY restaurant he would ask for a cucumber martini in hopes of finding a place that could make one half as good as Nobu.  He kept failing at that mission.  I was made to try each time he got one and always ended up chasing the taste with a glass of Rieslings or whatever I was drinking at the time.  I am, by no means, a martini fan.  That was until I FINALLY had a cucumber martini at Nobu.  If a drink could be described as refreshing and light, this would be the one.  I had 3 that night and would've had more if I wasn't in 5"" heels and thought I'd break my ankle if my drunky self tripped.

My friend, smartly left the decision of choosing items up to our waiter, Chris, and am I thankful to Chris's knowledge of the menu and checking in with us on what was to our liking and not.  From what I remember of the evening we had:

Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Big Eye Tuna-Delicious
Black cod with miso in a lettuce wrap-Delightful
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño-Awesome
California Roll-Too full to eat
Some sort of mac & cheese dish with shrimp-Underwhelmed

Not only did I enjoy myself, my food, my company, and my waiter, but it was a great place for people watching.  My friend and I spent half the time chatting about topics pertaining to us and the other half commenting on the people we observed and conversations we overheard.

1337484,2006-11-01,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good Japanese food.  A few quick notes about how to eat there.

1, I've heard the omikase is excellent. It's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.
2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. In general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. I have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when I go, I make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and I've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.
3, the black cod with miso, and hamachi with jalapeno and ponzu are  musts on the menu. I also recommend the squid pasta, rock shrimp tempura, sashimi salad, and spicy tuna rolls.  The spicy tuna roll there is the best version I've ever had.  The black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish I've ever consumed.
4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. I actually sat next to Wayne Brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and Tiffany Amber Thiessen was there a different night. I can't say the same nice things about her that I mentioned about Wayne Brady.

All in all, a great meal.  And get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.",Ik8PLdmfOR7j3WaQzP1PJQ,2,0,5,UYHdxndAATWg6kTHzm5rRw

Cold Dishes: 
Special: Toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  I think this dish was just a little salty. Once, you add all the dressing on top, I like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.)
Kelp Salad 13 (this tasted so fresh, added just a little lemon on top of it.  Also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course) 
Sea Urchin 16 (this is from Santa Barbara, CA which is normally where every Japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  Hmmm..this just tasted like any uni I would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  Oh well, I do love my uni.

Lemme start off with saying that I *did* like my food. But I am really getting sick of this fusion ""new sashimi"" crap. I know a lot of people like it. But a sashimi purist such as myself follows the, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" regime. However, new sashimi I tried and it was far from bad. I think it was a seared tuna something in ponzu sauce. I'm going to round up on my stars because it did force me to step outside my box and try something new. 

Oysters were quite steep. $15 for three kumomoto oysters. My date didn't think that was steep at all; but them Manhattan boys don't love the dollar oyster nights that we love in the Bay Area.

Impressive, but expensive sake list. I didn't partake. And I wouldn't unless date wanted some too. Again, the prices didn't raise his eyebrows. My story about the bottomless sake at Coach in Oakland very much raised his eyebrows.

Of course, if you are spending Nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. But that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list. 

I have been to Nobu Next Door in NYC, so this was a different experience.

Onto the food; We jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced for sashimi. We ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the Nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off). 

From there we also had the Yellowtail with Jalapeno, as always. Then we had the lobster ceviche, and a couple lobster tacos as well. Both good and the lobster was great.

The service was outstanding! more attentive than NOBU in Japan which I had a pleasure of experiencing on a work trip last month. Thank you (??? ??? ?????) so much Adrienne. The Ambiance is great, dim lighting lighting makes for a very romantic evening for diners. You might get louder or more obnoxious dining group sitting perhaps close by which can negatively impact the atmosphere, but no way to really control that and after all we are in VEGAS!
We could not decide what we wanted to eat and decided to just set a budget per person and let the server bring us whatever her wonderful self thought would wow us.(Adrienne DID AMAZING!!!)

1. Edamame / Shishito Peppers: I rarely eat shishito peppers but these were fantastic! not hot ( guess I got lucky since I can't deal with HOT ) and a little sweet with the sauce. Edamame? its Edamame.......

2. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño and Cilantro
The Cilantro on with each piece was interesting but complimented the flavors greatly. I really enjoyed this and would order this again next time.

3.Live Scallop:
Thinly sliced scallop served in the tiradito-style with peruvian flavors of cilantro, spice and Japanese fusion elements. The abductor is also thinly sliced on the plate, giving contrasting flavor and texture. Although good I enjoyed the Yellowtail more than this dish. On a side note... Did someone spill the Yuzu on this dish? little overwhelming....

4. Black Cod Miso in Lettuce Butter Cups: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night ( Dessert got the number one spot sorry). This is a must eat dish and I will return to experience this one again! mmm my mouth is watering for this one right now. I would suggest to tone down the sugar.

5. Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers and Chicken wings:
 The pork was also one of my favorite things the whole night but at that time I haven't had any dessert yet. Amazing Kurobuta Pork Belly that was braised to absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection, although a little fatty, but people tend to enjoy the fat so I can't complain. 

6. Toro Blue Fin and Salmon which was actually two dishes. I really enjoyed the Toro more than the salmon maybe due to the fact I dislike salmon in raw form. I believe both of these dishes were so so, I rather eat the fish plain. Although to give it justice each piece had amazing flavor with different textures from the fish, capers,wasabi and garlic chips.

7: King Crab with brown sugar? and cherry tomatoes and shiso leaf:
 Truthfully I would not order this dish If I were to come back due to the fact I can go to many Vegas buffets and devour crab legs for hours. This was nothing to write home about. 

8. Sushi Platter with California Roll, Uni that was so fresh I could eat it everyday, Yakitori Unagi, And Salmon. Everything was great except the rice... this was a let down... it was hard and dry. I am surprised at the sushi chef for making nigiri with this rice.

9. Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki:
This dish was great but after eating a ton of wagyu in Japan your palette gets you and you end up craving that melt in your mouth amazingness you just don't have with any other type of beef. Maybe just stick with the Uni! haha......

10. Beef Carpaccio:
What can I say? this is as good as it gets people! eat it! enjoy it!
Although if you are looking for good Beef Carpaccio District One on Spring Mountain and Jones has some killer Carpaccio.

11. Fried Rock Shrimp something something something:
Well it was shrimp... it was very well presented and came to the table in a rock pot still sizzling. Lets just go to Hot N' Juicy Crawfish. 

12. Assortment of Desserts: 
 The desserts just kept coming, honestly this was what I came here for and If it wasn't for my brother and friend I would of just ordered every single dessert item on the menu and that would of been it. 4 courses of desserts after all the entrees had finished. The highlights included a cucumber shaved ice to die for with Yuzu syrup which they pour on the ice at your table with fresh berries, young coconut and cantaloupe sorbet did I mention it had STAR FRUIT ON TOP!!! I haven't had starfruit since I was a child living in Hawaii. Second was a Special New Years Eve only Sizzle in your mouth palette zapping of amazingness dessert it was Fuji Apple and champagne semifreddo (what word was that?) with apple cake crumble with POP ROCKS, yes I fucking said that right!!!! It had pop rocks in the cake crumble what dessert have you ever had with pop rocks plain genius! that's not it! It also had freeze dried kiwi and pineapples with dulce glaze finished with champagne foam and apple chips. They really should keep that one on the menu. Third was Pear Toban w/ gingerbread stout cake w/ poached pears in orange syrup w/ toasted cinnamon ice cream and candied black walnuts, this one was a warm ""homey"" dessert but not the highlight it was presented very well on a clay looking pot wit",8PoDBWpKjOSC-0XE0W_D1A,1,1,5,NZ-uPyuBU92ZupGBMqFD6g

The dim lighting was adequate, but there was something about this place that was intimidating. Yes the tables and the space just didn't make sense, everyone is to close to each other! I mean they charge an arm and a leg for the food but they can't provide space and a little more privacy. I fell for the hype. This is why I can't give Nobu the badass seal of approval. Moneywise for Peruvian Japanese fusion look elsewhere, you won't be disappointed. Will I be back to retry the experience? Eh Maybe.",4iKbzdOGYiOOxQmZ5n4kEA,0,0,3,p_oHbRs9hLvz8bp__ksSWg

I'm from So Cal, so logically, I want to eat at one of my favorite places when I'm visiting in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the experience in Vegas was completely different then SD. My friend and I went down to the sushi bar around 10:00 pm to eat some fresh rolls and my favorite, rock dynamite shrimp. I was amazed that everything came out in less the 5 mins. Afterwards, I felt like I was chewing on sand. My stomach started to hurt and I felt violently ill. My friend ended up with the same symptoms. I called Nobu to tell them about what happened and our ""ill"" experience and no one ever called me back or even acknowledged the issue. I would not recommend this restaurant or location when you are visiting in Vegas. 

An update to this review... My friend spent three days in the Desert Springs Hospital due to food poisoning. I tried calling the manager George Lypton as well as going into the restaurant to update him on my friend's condition. I was supposed to be on a plane and return to Cali, instead I had to extend my stay resulting in more hotel fees and airfare loss. I received a very unsympathetic voicemail that George turned the incident over to his insurance. He doesn't know my friend's name, her number, etc. she was taken by ambulance via a 911 call and he couldn't even follow up on her health or mine?

Our waitress was Adrian and I think when the food is spectacular and service goes above n beyond it just makes the whole experience that much better.  My favorite fish I think was yellowtail.  All of the raw fish there that I was served was very thin and delicate.  Nothing I ate was fishy or slimy.  I even had the uni.  If you're a sushi rookie then Nobu is the place to start.  Keep in mind too, you get what you pay for.  This is not a cheap restaurant.  Be ready to drop some money.

1515831,2011-10-17,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Can we say PRETENTIOUS? 

First impression: reservation was confirmed via OpenTable, but somehow the hostess said that our reservation was not there. She looked around (the restaurant was about 10% filled) and hesitated, then said something along the lines of ""I suppose we can seat you anyway""

Waiter: talked out of his ass. SERIOUSLY. This guy had no idea what he was saying!!! He tried to sound extremely educated in food once I told him I was a huge fan of Nobu and that I had all his cookbooks and loved them all. When describing the lobster risotto, he said ""and the way the chef prepares the risotto with the wakame and the seaweed...."" HI. wakame IS seaweed. ""the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck..."" HI. can you be any more redundant? Don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like I have no clue what you're saying. I flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. He had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to add in japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.

PROs: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. We never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. The food was good, albiet pretentious... (I would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), The menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. The wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.

CONs: again, extremely frou frou Japnese food. The price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... PLEASE. The black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... The ceviche hurt my masseters. I probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. I'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, Nobu was a let down. If it's tiny portions, at least make them SPECTACULAR tiny portions. Spectacular it was not.

We left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. Sorry, Nobu. Maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not Las Vegas.",0BypTx7HWe0beJHHXMr9Bw,6,3,2,W4LpyPlUyaWlh3vaS0Cw1Q

While the food is good, it is not great.  Plating is pretty, but food is sparse.  Here is where I went wrong.
No menu ordering.  The waiter gave us the option to set our price point per meal and he would pick the courses.  Feeling adventuresome and wanting to be cool I said yes, opting for middle of the line $100-$125 per person pricing.  Yes you read that right.  The first course shows up in 2 minutes and 3 minutes later the next course shows up.  I ask the waiter to slow down and he acknowledged my request.  Yet in 5 minutes, another course shows up.  It would not all fit on our table.  The barracuda was just ok (who serves barracuda?).  Finally the 5th course shows up.  It was a Cod piece on butter lettuce.  It was fishy and just not good.  I sent it back, and when the waitress asked why she laughed.  I looked at my better half and we could not believe that she did that.  She did tell our waiter who fairly promptly came over to inquire.  I explained our dissatisfaction and his response was ""some people feel it does tastes fishy, but it is fish"".
I pondered talking to the manager but felt it better to discuss it with our waiter.  He did apologize and told us he was absolutely going to take the dish off the bill.  Should not have had to ask, but he needed to  to be much more proactive, considering each course was about $50.  I am glad we took the approach we did because he was a nice guy who really just forgot how much money we were spending.  And we were spending an average amount in this place.  Total bill for 2, which included a couple of glasses of wine each was $345 plus tip.  Ouchy, even in Vegas.",51_737cfyM5EyfKs5PPsEw,4,0,3,HfWBMO4HO0ihPG42-LRm7g

Make sure to ask the server for the more popular items. You honestly cannot go wrong with any of them. The sake is also good and worth  the few extra dollars on your bill.

I went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  When we arrived we were told by our waiter that ""we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and I'll customize the menu for you"".   Odd...  This should have raised a red flag right there.  

""Well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  That's why we're here.""
""Any non-sushi eaters?""
A couple of guys raise their hands...
""Yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.""
""Okay, I'll get you guys started.""

Some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 HUGE platters of sushi!!   When all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  Our ""customized"" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food PLUS 3 complete steak dinners.

When we questioned our waiter, his response was ""Well that's what you said you wanted.""  We certainly did NOT want enough food for 12 people.  By the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  Of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  The bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  I don't think I would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that I had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.

We were told that we could only sit at our table for an hour (WTF?) and could not order the chef's tasting menu, which was basically the only thing we wanted to get , mostly because the menu was so large and complicated it made us all tired and confused to read it!

Well, several courses, 4 beers and 2 bottles of wine later, I guess we had spent enough money to keep the table since it was waaaayyyyy past our allotted hour. 

The food was pretty incredible - kumamoto oysters with caviar, wonderful fresh sashimi, tempura, rock shrimp with some type of amazing sauce.  I think my favorite dish was also the most pretentious - duck that was cooked over hot river stones and then finished off at the table with a splash of courvoseour that was then set aflame!

I will just leave you with some advice:

1. Don't come here drunk. You will leave with a bill that is closer to a G. You may not enjoy it as much either.
2. Order the Black Cod Miso. Hands down the best dish that I've ever tasted.
3. You can come in a large group, but groups of 4 are best. They serve small plates. Intimate dining at it's best.
4. Service is solid, be sure to tip well. This isn't the Outback or Chili's. Don't treat it like your typical Vegas fare.
5. Yes, it's a chain now. It never used to be. But the quality hasn't skipped a beat.
6. Go to Nobu in every city you visit (if there is one).

Apparently it's Hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the Kona coast of the Big Island. The trout was also very good. It looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. Served with a nice miso-based sauce (I think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.

4) Black Cod w/ Miso - This dish really did live up to the hype. I was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the Omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 Omakase since it's a very popular dish. OMG so good. Such delicate flavors and texture. Amazing. I normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. The cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. Wow, this is a must try if you come to Nobu.

5) Beef Tenderloin w/ Shiitake mushroom and asparagus - I didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. It was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. It is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.

6) Nigiri Sushi Platter - Delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces I normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. Tuna (best I've had in awhile), Japanese snapper, Aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. Mmm

7) Miso Soup w/ Clams - Pretty standard miso soup with a few clams inside. The clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. I cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;P

8) Flourless Chocolate Cake w/ Green Tea Ice Cream - A generous portion served in a cute bento box. Nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. The cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. Yum!

A pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. I thought it was good value to try many dishes, but I haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. Many tables around us also ordered the Omakase, as I heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. I over heard a table of French tourists behind us ordering California rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. Sigh, what a waste.

I would recommend not to order anything not on the ""hot"" of ""cold"" specialty pages of the menu. The rest is basically traditional Japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at Nobu. Service was good, polite, and attentive. It was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. Weird.

The decor is basic, but nothing too special. The sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. My parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. When we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. Ten minutes later, they were ready. Better to come early though, or your Omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. Ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.

I think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. Otherwise, nearly flawless.

If I ever return for a special occasion, I will definitely need to try the $150 Omakase. With the economy in shambles, I kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. Fortunately, my parents picked up the tab tonight as I had paid last night at the Painted Pony. Maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like Gray's Papaya. ;P",50W6VKW498OCuH2itdEbfw,2,1,5,-DinwLvTBJElmbNXS18O5w

Nobu stands out from the rest of the sushi chains because of their creative entrees. Based off their Chilean Sea Bass and Black Cod dishes, I'm quite impressed and have confidence that any of their dishes would be a good pick. These dishes were well prepared and were not drenched in sauce. Their raw fish tastes as if it's fresh from the ocean; definitely close to what you can get in Japan. However, the quality of their fish is what closely resembles Japan not the restaurant itself as their menu, interior decor and waitstaff is like any other American restaurant.",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,1,1,4,oE_TGQM4_rwR7rjCMTLMVA

- black cod with miso - mmm mmm!! knock out! highlight of our meal

- toro and scallion hand rolls - meh, nori wrapper was a little chewy, had to tug a bit with each bite.  for an establishment of this caliber (supposedly michelin 1 star rating 2009), I thought this was a major no no.  the best establishments make sure the nori are well kept in a wooden box to maintain the right moisture level.

(tough life) There is some special draw about the food and the execution that get friends or coworkers to want to eat at a Nobu. The atmosphere is always special, encouraging a good conversation, people watching and banter with the staff.  The food used to be extremely special when it first started in LA. But as the years have past other restaurants have caught up and copied Nobu's menu.  The food in Vegas is still top notch, with fresh fish, inventive sauces that accentuate the food and great sake.  The price is very expensive for what you get but at the end of the night it is about the whole experience.

My favorite dishes are: toro tartare, hamachi sashimi with jalapenos, and the fried rock shrimp with cream sauce.

Inside scoop: do not get the free for all omakase where the waiter pretends to customize the menu for you.  This is not like the places in Tokyo where the chef stares deep into your soul and magically delivers the menu of a lifetime.

we had shrimp and scallop new style sashimi, and it was
sweet, succulent, yet unctuous with the oil drizzled on top.
i can't really do it justice with my description, but the peruvian
influence i think is what shines through and takes it over the top.
it's just something you have to taste and savor to grasp the profoundness of it, especially if you appreciate the pureness of sashimi like i do.
the omakase is spectacular, serving portions are not generous, but
you get to experience delicate and exotic ingredients and flavors in
a nice intimate setting.
sea urchin and abalone are also to die for, but they do run out of the abalone rather quickly, so you may want to inquire at reservation.

1675978,2013-08-12,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Truly disappointing on several levels.  The quality of the fish was simply not that good.  I'm not even comparing it to Sugarfish (highly recommended), but merely to local LA places like Brothers Sushi in Woodland HIlls.  When I'm paying Nobu prices, I expect better than Woodland Hills sushi, know what I mean?

The portion sizes were, frankly, skimpy.  I will credit them for serving a real Salmon Roll, whereas many sushi places use pieces of meat that has been broiled/burnt, this was real salmon skin, just like the good places do it.

The prices are really astronomical...and given that they all buy their fish from the same place(s), pretty ridiculous.  Hey, I've had sushi in Japan with businesses, and even paid for it one time -- a vertiginous buying experience that will affirm to you that Amex truly does have no credit limit on your card -- so I do know good and even great sushi.  This is not it.

The service was, and I'm not sure if this makes sense, but obsessively and (worse) aggressively obsequious.  This guy would continually hover over us explaining to us how (and exactly) whatever we wanted would be taken care of by him of the sushi chef.  Very intrusive, and I realize now it was the exact opposite of the very non-intrusive servile style found in sushi places world wide.",oF09vjtmz1iWp30QRCPfeA,1,0,2,q1axJ4nH3CSYSRCBrZl8AQ

We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  Upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    The atmosphere at Nobu is much different than Morimoto...Nobu is more lively and trendy.  

They have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  We started with the oysters and the lobster ceviche which is served in lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. 

For our second course we chose the creamy spicy crab and the rock shrimp tempura in butter ponzu.  The creamy spicy crab may be one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  At the end of our weekend I asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about Vegas and he responded without hesitation ""Eating creamy spicy crab at Nobu.""  Not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the creamy spicy crab.  

We chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) and yellowtail scallion.  Each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.

For dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  Our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   All were amazing.

The service was outstanding throughout the night.  The meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at Morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  In the end I felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  Including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  I do have to add that it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  When I made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.

You're in Vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money. 

It is glaringly obvious that the chefs at Nobu approach sushi and food like art. From the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. I tasted unique creations at Nobu that I have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will I probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. Every time a new plate arrived at our table, I felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). I can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. There was hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). Each was an explosive fusion of the Far East and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. They also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.

The food: The Groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. The meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. A very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. The first course was yellowtail tuna with jalapeno and cilantro. The tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. It was very tasty and different than yellowtail that I have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. Things got even better after that. The next dish was rock shrimp tempura with a creamy spicy sauce. Wow, was that good! Not like any tempura I have eaten before. Very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. And the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. A great dish. And a huge portion. By its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. This was followed by the Alaskan Black Cod with Miso. Another outstanding dish. The fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a California roll. This was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. Last course, dessert. I photographed the plate. A beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). The food rates 5 stars plus.
The service: As soon as we were seated, our server, Albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. Throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. They made us feel very welcome. Our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. The table was cleared promptly. The food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. The service was 5 stars plus.
The ambiance: The restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. However, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. We were there on a Monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  But our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. If the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. Not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. At best, 3 stars for ambiance.
Value: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. I would do it again in a heartbeat. But I would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or I would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,0,4,WaFpukie2qusJKFy8HJcEA

1770993,2007-06-27,11,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I wish all of my meals in Vegas were this good.  I don't even know where to begin.  The Yellow Tail sashimi with jalapeno that I was allowed to taste was delicious.  I could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  Thankfully being with the group I was with that wasn't allowed to happen and I enjoyed several other items from the menu.

For myself I ordered the Chilean sea bass with a dry miso rub, the lobster ceviche, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  The sea bass had a very mild flavor although the dry miso was tasty.  I think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  The lobster ceviche was great and I could have had a couple more but I held off so I could enjoy my entire meal.  The uni was good, although I don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  I'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  At least I hope so.  The surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. It was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  With a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  I really should have gotten at least one more order.

I was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  All were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time I eat at Nobu.

For dessert I had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  The popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the Yelp events I've been to.",0gEDwhSUIWIBz23MbLYMig,13,15,4,3Ph5vaGzxrpZOKNZUnCYsQ

 There are two high end sushi joints here in Vegas. This location not as swanky as the one in Caesars Palace  nevertheless is a signature restaurant for the Hard Rock Hotel and a little more casual than 35 Steaks next door.
The elegant dining room with Bamboo thrown in the ceiling and minimal décor in a Zen sort of way it's warm and inviting. 
To start the yellowtail sashimi was superb, delicate sensuous .The crispy tempura rock shrimp drenched in a yuzu spicy sauce over salad greens was tangibly addicting. The picture of the Black Cod in miso should be posted as the Wikipedia definition of umami simple, savory and sweet accented by a pickled ginger shoot. The sushi was ordinary but respectable fresh. A nice little green tea ice cream for dessert to complete the Nobu experience. The staff were friendly professional rock stars.
If you want to feel like a baller the groupon deal is the way to go and you be treated to a nice multi-course adventure by one of Japan's best chef.

1772988,2011-03-14,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"My buddy and I went to Nobu this past Friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. We had very few disappointments. They sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  Lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of Japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  We split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant Nigori Sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. The small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. 

The first course came out quick and cold. A chilled patty of Toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped with caviar, served with a baby silver spoon.  It was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  The caviar was not memorable.  An A+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. Next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  Pretty good.  Next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  My buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the shrimp head and the dressing.  I will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. 

Then started the hot plates.  First was the ever famous Black Miso Cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  A small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  Flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  My friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  Next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. Beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as I would like.  My buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  The dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  Try not to get the grease on you. 

Next was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam miso soup. We got a piece of red snapper (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and sea eel which was the most tender fall apart sea eel I have ever tasted.  The sushi rice and soup fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea ice cream.   This just put the nail in the coffin.  We were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  

The restaurant closed at 11pm on a Friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  Next time I'm in vegas I plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  This was the $100 omasake.  The $150 would have added some kobe beef and lobster here and there.  We were very happy with our choice.  I think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.",s06IMX1XdPgzgflWh7qbaA,2,1,4,czeBwvPVIzb1ne1CFW5rGw

started off with salmon nigiri (salmon was buttery and excellent) and pomegranate martinis (too weak; tasted more like koolaid). we shared the black cod with miso and the baked creamy crab. the cod was rich and buttery but the sauce was just a tad too sweet so i had to scrape it off the skin. if we had rice, i wouldn't mind at all. the crab was delicious and there was huge meaty chunks of it. however, the creamy baked sauce was a little on the salty side--again, a bowl of rice would've fixed that problem. the service was alright and the decor was fab.",_l-iAhD0N_GVIvFJqq0brA,0,0,4,0mhzoiJgy4_7SLwFRl5ZFA

1830108,2011-06-09,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Hands down my favorite place to dine anywhere on earth. I make sure I dine at Nobu everytime I visit Vegas (which is quite often). They have lots of ""signiture"" dishes and they always have a ""new"" or ""special"" item or two on their menu. here's a little secret, they have quite a few other ""signiture"" items that they do not even place on their menu, be sure to ask your server about a few of the great items not listed such as the black miso glazed lettuce cups. The place has an up-beat vibe, modern decor and great music playing, also some of the best people watching in town. It's also VERY common to run into celebs dining there as well. It's a little bit pricy, expect to pay at least $100 per person with a couple of cocktails each(that's prob on the low side to be honest), my last visit cost me over $700 for 3 people but worth every penny, I have paid more at other places in the past for FAR FAR less. As with most any place Fri and Sat evening are their busiest, reservations at peak dining hours 8:00-10:00pm on these nights usually book up 3 weeks in advance so make sure you plan ahead.

Side note; I have eaten at both the Nobu in LA and Miami and neither of them compare to the one in Vegas, I'm really not sure why??? I would give LA 4 Stars and Miami 3 Stars.

Service was attentive and friendly, and the interior design is evocative of the old Tribeca location.

However, the restaurant location/setting was disappointing and poorly representative of the brand, to say the least. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to open up a Nobu at the Hard Rock Hotel; it would seem that their target demographics do not intersect at all. This is the only Nobu I have been to that has deemed it necessary to post a dress code at the entrance, which only helped minimally.

And the food lived up to all the hype as every dish was an orchestra of flavors and perfectly cooked/sliced proteins. 

For instance when biting into the barracuda sashimi you first taste the tartness of the yuzu which is then overcome by the fattiness of the fish and the bread crumbs and finally you are hit by the small crunchy garlic chips. 

The wait staff is very attentive and they ask that you simply answer a couple of questions about preferences and price points and they then come up with a tasting menu. We gave them no restrictions and what came out of the kitchen for about $120 per person was amazing. 

Our impromptu tasting menu included two of Nobu's iconic dishes -- miso-glazed black cod and the jalapeno yellowtail. Like the barracuda, both of these dishes also had several flavor profiles developing on the taste buds. There were also several other dishes and a full plate of sushi, each of which would be the best in almost any city.

Our server, I believe she said her name was Ti, was also a highlight as she showed an honest exuberance and pride in the food that she was serving, which made us even more excited to try it.

For drinks, my wife had a respectable cucumber martini and I had an interesting version of the Sidecar -- an Old School drink but with yuzu being used to create the tartness.

Part of a vacation, a good friend (a meat-eater and self-denied foodie) found this place as our go to for a serious Las Vegas food experience.  He had lived in NYC and eaten at that location - and knew that the Hard Rock location had a lot to live up to.  It didn't let either of us down.

In fact, it was so good, that even at $100 per person we seriously considered going back the next night.

It's been some time, so in all fairness I'm having trouble remembering the specific ingredients in the dishes, but know that each course was a sensory experience.  Some were for touch, some for smell, most for sight, some for sound, and ALL for taste.  The flavors were incredible - hitting many of the core flavors in every single bite.  Sweet, salt, spice, hot, cold, acidic, creamy - just writing this makes me want to jump on a plane tonight to try to catch the last seating.  And the sake!  Oh, the sake :)

If I were to knock off even 1 star, it'd be because it's a little ways off the strip - at the Hard Rock.  So if you're totally strip-centric, maybe not your best bet.

So, I ordered the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, the Salmon Tataki with Cilantro Dressing, Lobster Ceviche, and my FAVORITE THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD= the Black Cod with Miso lettuce wraps!

Night one of my three-day Vegas Michelin dining binge brought me to Nobu.  The occasion:  friend's birthday.  

Upon arrival, we were led through a crowded dining room full of boisterous patrons drinking sake and beer to a table at which we were rubbing elbows with the parties around us.  First things first:  this place is not where you want to go for an elegant Japanese meal, but it is perfect for bigger groups.  

When our waiter arrived, he took our drink orders, then instead of announcing any specials, he told us that for a group of our size, he ""strongly recommended"" that we do family style.  He said it in a tone that left no other option.  Of course family style makes sense, but it seems to me that an establishment with Nobu's reputation (and Michelin star!) should be far more accommodating to its patrons.  But I do understand that it is likely difficult to navigate one's way through such a crowded restaurant with the myriad of plates that accompany most Japanese meals.

My group opted for the omakase.  We were brought a nice variety of both hot and cold dishes, raw and cooked.  The highlight of the meal was the miso black cod.  The dish was placed in the center of the table, and following this was an unanimous chorus of approval as we each tasted this delectable morsel;  definitely umami.  I also enjoyed the nicely seasoned yellowtail sashimi a great deal, but it wasn't the best yellowtail I've had by far.  The rest of the dishes were less memorable, but still well executed.  The final few courses consisted of rolls whose fish to rice ratio was unreasonably high - yeah, I could tell they were trying to fill me up.  

Were I to rate the food alone, Nobu would be a solid four star establishment.  But Nobu is a Michelin rated restaurant, and I'd like to rate it by Michelin standards.  These places, in my experience, don't pack their diners in like sardines, and especially don't have patronizing waiters.  I enjoyed my experience at Nobu, but the enjoyment was more about the company than the restaurant itself.  

I've been told that Nobu's other locations are much classier than the one on the Vegas strip.  If that's the case, then shame on those Michelin guys for giving this particular location a star.",V82pSScoeQ9vddeZQWxPeQ,5,4,2,Dhk91BVhBodL57Jrh4HvtQ

Very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. Now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  Melt in your mouth!  Next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  Chilean Seabass is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  Black Cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. It's done right!  And believe me, I make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.

2150546,2014-07-24,2,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"This is a review of the groupon deal dinner.

The Skinny: fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the Groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. So you can imagine what I have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).

So here's the deal. We spotted the Nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought ""how can we pass this up?"".

We went and were seated prompty. Our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. We ended up getting in addition to the prix fixe an order of their vegetable tempura to round out the menu. The specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so I passed on those.

Starting with some simple edamame with Maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.

Course 1) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. Although I have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. My only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.

Course 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. I was despondent when I realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.

Course 3) rock shrimp tempura: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. I think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. Flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.

Course 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! Overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. I have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.

Course 5) vegetable tempura (added to the Groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. The batter was slightly spongier than what I like. I think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could add as much/little we wanted.

Course 6) normally this would be mochi ice cream except it was my birthday so I got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea ice cream. All of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.

Perhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. However time has made his dishes appear quite dated. The signature dishes of rock shrimp tempura/yellowtail jalapeño sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. Given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, I cannot recommend this place given the Groupon price let alone full price. Although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,9,4,3,X6dROWg18ZfP4K2Mjyavlg

We were a group of 4 and quite hungry. Kind of a bad mix as you're walking into a notoriously expensive japanese/sushi resto. Now if you're going to dine here this is how you do it.

Don't waste your time ordering a la carte. Give your knowledgeable server a maximum $ amount per head and let him design the menu for you. We were ready to shell out a bit and spend about $100 each excluding alcohol which in the end was the perfect amount to leave completely satisfied. You can tell him a few things for direction (like we had to have the miso cod!) but let him bring out dish after mind blowing dish and you just sit back and enjoy your company. They carefully explain everything that is brought out and whats great is because you are eating the exact same things you get to share in the same experience. 

We also ordered a 60 ounce bottle of Sake and ordering drinks was also something we didn't have to think about for the rest of the night.

Situated in the Hard Rock Hotel, on a night there were more industry people here from a convention drinking up beers and having what I deem fusion food. 

One of the dishes that stood out, tempura uni, as it was definitely interesting on the menu, and the price was about right, until it came to the table as one piece, and the rest was vegetable bits. I know you are supposed to be high end, but don't tease that way. And uni should only be eaten raw and fresh, as it was a waste to deep fry this sucker, and practically turn it to goo.

I felt like I was at a bar & grill then I was in a high end restaurant the day I was here, as it felt like an ""industry night"". The dishes that came to our table were nicely presented, for the price your paying, I guess some art work must be done to the plate to be able to charge you.

Restaurant decor and ambiance were beautiful.  The drunk guy passed out on the table next to us provided some decent entertainment until he was escorted out. 

The first two courses were delicious...simple sashimi and sushi samples.  Excellent quality fish.

The much raved-about rock shrimp and black cod courses were pretty disappointing.  The shrimp was slathered in a mayonnaise-y sauce that probably should've been a side dipping sauce.  So creamy.  Too creamy.  Took all the finesse out of what could've been a delicated, beautiful shrimp dish.  However, if you love mayonnaise.  Then you'll like it.   The miso cod was good for a bite or two...but then was just too sweet.  Almost sweeter than the dessert that followed...which was pretty yummy.

2276760,2007-06-16,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Hubby's review is 2 stars.  Here's what he has to say....

Food was slightly better than ok.  
Prices were too fucking expensive!  
Would never go back.   

Here's what I have to say....3.5 stars

I'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....

Our waiter was snooty.  The prices are beyond outrageous.  The menu was extremely complicated.  I am no Japanese dining expert, but I've eaten at my fair share of Japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me I could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  It didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like Japanese food...don't ask.  I digress.  

The food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  The rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.  

But the 2 best parts about Nobu for me were the Belini Martini's (I had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the Bento Box dessert.  The dessert was absolutely heavenly.  A flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea ice cream, it was one of the best desserts I have ever had!  

It's too bad hubby says he won't go back. I think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars.",aKDe5qvoYT_1jdMOalehmQ,1,1,3,VU1UU1RkncshhbOmLvXRBA

2287311,2015-08-18,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"There's a Groupon for Nobu?!! Whaaaat!?! Yes, believe it! I had purchased a Groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. And my BF was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. It was actually perfect timing that this Groupon became available because I was going to be in Vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* Anyways, I made reservations for 2 at 6PM online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. The Groupon can only be used at the Nobu inside the Hard Rock hotel. There's also a Nobu inside Caeser's Palace. Once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in Japanese! The decor inside was really nice and elegant. I really liked the bamboo wall they had. I also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. 

Ok onto the food! So we started off with some edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. Next came the best sashimi I had ever had in my life! Its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. The flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. Yumm!!! I can probably eat like five more of that dish. :P The next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the shrimp tempura. I was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at Japanese restaurants. The dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. It was rich and creamy. And the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. Next came their black cod dish. My BF absolutely loved this one and I can see why. It was so flakey and cooked to perfection. The fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. Next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. This dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. But it was still tasty. And lastly we got our dessert! It was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. OMG...so good!!! The green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. The cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 desserts because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. The chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. Overall, everything we tried was excellent! The reason why I subtracted 1 star was because both my BF and I felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. Otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. I'm so happy to get to try Nobu for the first time! =) So go get your Groupon, while it's still available peeps!!",QqcWKvwLBzXKLqdJnbbgAg,0,0,4,pbxyG6-W_cSo41IrHtj5ew

Servers standing outside staring at me eat, constantly people walking behind me, can hear conversations of servers standing inside. No bueno.

Next, the price. Oh wow. Triple the price of the place I went just the other day in marina del Rey and I guarantee it's more fresh. This fish tasted frozen and thawed. Absolutely unacceptable if you are charging 25-30 for a single roll. 

I guess I had my personall chef but the guy could hardly speak and I'm sorry, I'm the customer. I'm not going to force myself to speak Spanish. The chef and the server were disagreeing on ingredients, too. That's a bad sign. 

No one seemed to have any personality. Everyone is so rushed to get things out, I would rather them take their time and get it right then to rush a 60 dollar meal. But, for some reason there's 9 chefs right in front of me with time to look and stare at me when I eat. Ugh ugh ugh.

My seafood toban yaki was disappointing though, my favorite dish at Morimoto just didn't live up to expectation at Nobu.

Do not expect to have a cheap meal here. The prices are high, but you are paying for the highest quality - in everything. So know that you are going to shell out more than normal for an amazing experience.

The decor and ambiance are great. Nicely lit. Easy to carry on a conversation. Place is great for big groups too. 

Service:
Impeccable. Our server was named Marcus. He is the best out there. The group I was with always request him and I now know why. We didn't have to pickup a menu, he did all the ordering for us. He knew if someone had an allergy to something and made accommodations for them. Complete stud. The other waiters and staff were also very attentive. Drinks and waters were refilled constantly. Plates were replaced after each course.

Amazing!!
Small tapas style portions for sharing. Quality and flavor were out of this world.

2449518,2009-11-04,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I love Nobu, although I shouldn't.  The food is just SO good that you have to forgive rude service and ridiculous prices.  Truthfully, the service hasn't always been rude, but I have had two experiences that were less that desirable during the last five times I went.

Let's knock out the negatives really quickly.  Once, they lost my reservation.  No big deal, but they acted like they were doing me a favor by providing a table 45 minutes later.  Whatever.  

The other thing was pretty funny actually.  Some people would be bothered by this, but I laughed.  Once, I took a client who had a bit too much to drink, I guess.  When we were seated, he was looking at the chopsticks that were balancing against a rock and asked the waitress if the rock was intended as a tool to get her attention.  She didn't laugh.  Instead, she chose to tell our entire table, ""Not unless you want me to spit in your food.""  Not too professional for such a highly regarded restaurant, but then again he was being a dumbass.

On to the food.  Yes, it is amazing.  No, I cannot tell you why.  Everything I have ever tasted here was exceptional.  The price is the only negative.  The toro nigiri is to die for even at $20 a piece, or whatever it was.  I once ordered three Kobe beef appetizers for a group.  I guess I should have asked the price first because they were $180 each!  Good news is that they were delicious and expensed.  I also recall having some tasty sea bass here.  Nothing has ever disapponted.

The location is inside of the Hard Rock Hotel.  It isn't very large, so be sure to have a reservation in advance.  Sitting at the sushi bar is also a fun experience, which I definitely recommend at least once.",xoZvMJPDW6Q9pDAXI0e_Ww,0,0,4,AWkFQHAcMgljB-sc9lKuHA

Their black cod was buttery and delicious but again, too much sauce on the outside. If you're serving good fish, don't ruin the flavor!!!

2514556,2011-01-07,3,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Travelling is incomplete unless met with great sushi, in my case at least. 

I arrived in Las Vegas, jet lagged after partying my tail feathers off in Hong Kong for two weeks. And since I had Nobu while I was in Hong Kong(which by the way, was amazing like always) - I thought I'd skip the visit to Nobu in Las Vegas and save some money. 

But my boyfriend was very sweet and surprised me with a RSVP to Nobu the night we arrived, so I dragged myself out of bed, dressed up and headed up Nobu. 

I've been to Vegas twice before, many years ago, but never had the chance to try Nobu. It was about a $15 cab ride from Mandalay Bay to Hard Rock, and when we arrived - we found the restaurant well hidden in the back of the entrance. The ambiance was nice, but nothing compared to the decor in Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong. Venue was small in comparison as well. 

The food was great, check out pictures of the sushi/appetizers from that night. 

If you are new to Nobu, here are a few recommendations from that night.
Otoro Nigiri - $38
Sea Urchin - $15
Barracuda - $40
Monkfish Liver(Ankimo) - $30
Squid Pasta - $20

and pair them with the Nobu beer! By the way, Nobu beer costs $15 each in San Diego, but costs only $8 in Las Vegas - don't know why, maybe the higher demand for beer allows them to lower their price?

All and all, Nobu Las Vegas was great....but...

I wish I didn't have to say this, especially since I have such a bias for Nobu - but the staff did not treat us the way a $250 bill deserves. It was probably due to the fact that we were a young couple, and didn't look like we had hundred dollar bills in hand to ""rain"" on the waiters. But either they were blind, or the fact that I was carrying an exclusive limited edition Louis Vuitton bag from Japan meant nothing to them. 

Waiter made no effort to create a conversation, rushed us from start to end, took five years to refill my hot green tea, yet five seconds to take the American Express off my boyfriend's hand. The waiter also talked to me as if I had never heard of Nobu in my entire life, he even questioned how I had known about the Nobu beer(since I ordered it without advertisement). At that moment I wanted to whip out the photo I took with Chef Nobu himself in Tokyo Nobu on my phone, but I thought, even if I did that, what does it proof besides the fact that I am dying for everyone to know that I met Chef Nobu, and that the waiter is an asshole? 

Maybe I was being a little harsh, but I have certain expectations from a restaurant who plans to charge me $250 minimum for dinner. Since those expectations weren't met, I am ranting on Yelp.

My major complaint - we let the server order.  It's great if you don't know what you want, but the guy ripped us off so badly we wanted to cry.  He saw a party of 6, instant gratuity on a check, and ordered us pretty much the most expensive things on the menu.  When we got the tab, we almost died out of shock, surprise, and instant regret.  I understand that the servers need to make money, but seriously - don't purposely rip your customers off.  I could hardly enjoy such a delicious meal after paying the bill.

Such delicious food can be expensive, it's high quality and reputation can warrant high prices, so my complaint isn't in the cost of the food, it is instead of the ethics of this particular situation.

And when we found out there was a Nobu here (see my NYC review since I had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! I was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. 

The decor is similar to New York's Nobu, but not as big and not as nice. The service is not as good but it's Vegas so oh well.

We ordered:

Peach Martini and Lychee martini - very good but strong.

Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce - This was fucking good. One of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (See below for Kristine N's review). They prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! It was GREAT!

Lobster salad - Of course I had to order this! I love the salad dressing. 

Miso black cod - The cool thing about Nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. This was fantastic and sweet.

Chilean Sea bass w/ mushrooms - The bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not Chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. It was still very good though. YUMMM.

Squid pasta - I love the squid pasta here. Complimented w/ asparagus. I love asparagus!

Rock shrimp tempura - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. Yummy.

Bento box - flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. This was better than I remembered from NYC. It's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. It was great, and gooey in the middle. 

Mango caramel ice-cream dessert - A light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.

One of the girls and I are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (See below for Kristine N.'s review!) That tells ya something! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because I hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)

It was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. By the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.

Sooo totally there.

It was worth it! $145 value (I manually calculated it...lol) Amazing 5 course tasting menu that caters to 2 and they are all standard sized portions. Not to mention, everything was insanely scrumptious! I would buy this exact groupon over-and-over again if the opportunity arises.

I've been burned by groupon before, where the restaurant would shamefully treat us like second-class citizens. Nope, not at Nobu - they treated us like VIP from start to finish. We were also celebrating our anniversary that evening and our server and all of the top-notch staff, made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We felt extremely taken care of (plus it was a busy night for them.)

Complimentary to start the unforgettable evening: 
+ Sparking voss water - bossy! 
+ Extra plump and sweet, steamed edamame with delicious crunchy maldon salt - savor every morsel

Accompaniments: 
+ Freshly brewed soy sauce. The flavor was smooth and refined
+ Fresh wasabi paste - talk about a head kick! Also smooth, bold and wonderful flavor
+ Crisp pickled ginger - perfect palate cleanser. Not overly sweet or sour, just right

5 courses: 
//Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and cilantro// $25
You better believe it's better than butter. Enjoy a little piece of cilantro in every bite, to brighten up all of the flavors. 

//California roll & chefs selection nigiri// $44
Tuna, fluke, salmon. Flip them, enjoy fish-side-down and let the fish just melt on your tongue. Each fish was extremely fresh, sweet, and delectable. Also, I never thought I would say this, but even the simple CA roll was scrumptious! The sushi rice was cooked to mouthwatering perfection. I was so upset when it was all gone.

//Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce// $24
Extra crispy and battered to extreme perfection. The addicting crunch makes it so wonderful. Subtle spices and perfectly creamy. Make sure to eat it with the spicy arugula and sweet baby greens underneath - they really add in another dimension of flavor! 

//Black Cod Miso// $37
The dish that put Nobu on the map - Black Cod Miso with pickled ginger root. Sweet, luscious, and sensational. The fish was prepared with extreme precision. 

//Bento Box// $15
Happy anniversary written in beautiful script using white chocolate sauce, with a warm molten chocolate fondant cake garnished with berries, shiso syrup, scrumptious green tea ice cream and a surprising, rich expresso soaked tiramisu topped with a Nobu emblem cracker. They were all beyond perfection. I can firmly state that Nobu also has desserts down to a delicious science.

1. Cause everyone needs to go to Nobu once in their life...why not Vegas
2. The calamari pasta is outta this world. A must have. BUT, don't let me set your expectations too high.
3. Overall experience is  warm, satisfying and sorta exciting - hey, it's Nobu.

Why you should not go to Nobu LV:
1. If you're going to Nobu, you're either a foodie, looking for a trendy spot or from Japan and need your rice (like the table next to us). Well, while the food is pretty darn good, I heard the other spots - Honolulu, NYC etc have a hipper vibe.
2. You want to save money to eat during the rest of your trip. We gorged out and ended up spending at least $150 each. 
3. You want to stick on the strip. While the Hard Rock isn't very far, it'd be cool if Nobu was in the midst of the chaos. On the other hand, maybe it's off-strip locale protects it...not sure on that one.

Since this was my first time at Nobu I opted for the waiter to choose my 7 course meal for 125 dollars per person. I was not disappointed, all the courses of sushi were very unique and super fresh.

I want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). The service was phenomenal! 

Our theme of the weekend turned out to be LMFAO's 'Sorry for Party Rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? Rocking! Aw, good times.

Must haves:
- Black Cod with Miso 
- Toro Sashimi (Shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty Bluefin tuna belly. He told them it was compliments of the chef. After they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.)
- Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno
- Spicy Tuna Rolls 
- Dessert: The chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. They even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.

I would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. Their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. I want to give a special thanks to the server who served Jessica H.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.

At this point I must admit that our two large Daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. I can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. I cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the NYC location.

Side Bar:

Bathroom situation: I hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of Rehab Day Club. At least Hard Rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal. 

On the bright side we also found out that Nobu will be opening a location at Cesar's Palace, which I think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.

The table next to us was doing Omakase style. So jelly, it looked amazing! When I go to the Cesar's location I will be doing Omakase.",b6_gR3caZcaf3PIein5ktA,9,8,5,CcR1f_x1f2RfiRfjHp0CxA

My BF too me here (my first trip) for our Saturday Night Dinner. We knew when we walked in that we were having the Omakase. I truly cannot pick out one single dish that I liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. Our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. Though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. My only sadness with the sake is that I can't buy it anywhere since it is made for Nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???) 

Course 1: Kumomoto Oysters, wrapped in smoked salmon with osetra caviar, served with endive and asparagus in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet AND spicy? Oysters? What is not to love?) 

Course 2: Shima Aji Sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (I'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) 

Course 3: Bluefin tuna sashimi topped with garlic puree and sliced jalapeno, served with jalapeno emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! You know I like spice in my life!) 

Course 4: Tasmanian trout trout and seared sweet shrimp sashimi salad served with mache, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only I could find this in DC) 

Course 5: Pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in yuzu soy sauce 

Course 6: Grilled washu beef with eared foie gras, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction 

Course 7: Soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - HUGE); Loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! 

Course 8: Sushi: One standout for me - salt water eel with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil and lemon together. Wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). Not that the other offerings weren't good. 

Course 9: Dessert. Panna Cotta (I think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was AWESOME! 

Final: Three types of fruit sake. My favorite was the ginger.

The good news is that you can still come to Nobu and get a great meal.  If you want to feel satisfied you will still drop a lot of $$$.  Perhaps stop by the convenience store on your way over and fill up on a candy bar before eating here to avoid the full financial exposure.  

My friend and I ate here before seeing Guns N Roses play at The Joint on a Friday night.  Most weekend nights will see Nobu booked up at least until 9PM.  It is open seating in the bar area but this area is tiny.  Nobu strictly enforces their dress policy so no swimming trunks.  It is dinner only so if you are hankering for Nobu at lunch sorry Charlie.

My favorite things were their pop rock shrimp, sea bass and fresh salmon sashimi.  Their hand rolls are pretty awesome too.

The servers went into great detail of each dish that we asked about, how the fish is cut/prepared, cooked, marinated, blah blah blah. My favorite dishes here were the chilean sea bass over buttered lettuce, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. A table next to us ordered rock shrimp tempura in a spicy sauce, so being the food envious kind of guy I am, I ordered one for our table...unfortunately it was the worst dish we've had here as the sauce used was too overbearing and salty. it was a creamy spicy red sauce similar to a dynamite sauce used in other sushi joints.

with that said.................. nobu not only met but exceeded any expectations that i had! every plate that i had was DELICIOUS. everything was fresh, no dirty fishy smell. i even had sashimi for the first time! the way that they pair their foods, whether its the sashimi with a small piece of jalapeno on top and light drips of soy sauce, or the black cod miso (the waiter warned us that no soy sauce was necessary... he was right! the cod looked plain but was marinated with SO MUCH flavor) wrapped in lettuce... or the tempura shrimp with a dash of seaweed sprinkled on top.. AMAZING. i just LOVED the food, the decor, and the presentation of the plates in general.

now, nobu has definitely changed my view and taste (or distaste, at least before!) for japanese food. of course, nobu has also made me a friggin japanese food SNOB, but that just shows that even though their food is pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.

OK, so we're in Las Vegas again for our daughter's 12th birthday.  It's me, my wife, and our two girls.  These are girls whose preferred snack is sushi.  These are kids who grew up eating at places like Chez Panisse, Lalime's -- kids who the people at the Cheese Board know not only by sight but are on a first-name basis with.

These are Berkeley kids.  We go to Nobu.

We have reservations for a 9:00 show, so we make 6:00 pm dnner reservations.  If they had their way, they would have had us out of there by 6:15!

There were actually six of us for dinner, lined up with dozens of other people waiting for the front door to be unlocked promptly at 6:00.  We inched inside as part of the reservation conga, only to be shunted aside while they seated others who were in line behind us.  What?  Our table not ready?  THE PLACE WAS EMPTY UNTIL THEY LET US IN!  It's not like they had to wait for someone to leave before they could seat us.

We listened to the waiter's suggestions in terms of how he thought (the restaurant thought?) we should proceed through the menu.  The three adults order sake; the three kids ordered whatever it was that they ordered; and we all ordered food.

O.K., I do NOT believe that a place with the reputation of Nobu makes their sushi in advance.  I DO believe their sushi is made-to-order.  Honest, I do.  But the sushi, the soup, the soba, the hot plates -- it all came at warp speed, and plates were whisked away before I finished swallowing the last bite!  Instead of a relaxed meal where we could talk, drink, and savor some extraordinary dishes, we were given our check (not cheap) and practically rushed out the door!

The sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  It's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  Then again, it's hard to mess up miso soup and theirs was the worst I've ever had (way too salty).  Service was good.  

Our bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  So if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, Nobu is the place to go.  Or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  That's when you go to Nobu.  

There are many reasons to go to Nobu, but edible food is not among them.  If you want good food, there are some great French options in the area, such as Le Cirque.",m41uXbtCgGrJvSaULy0ojQ,3,0,1,-kwbX2bYG4EcsWVWe7A5QA
2821014,2008-08-14,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"We got the the top level Omakase ($150/person Chef's Choice) and I will never forget it. It was the best dining experience I've ever had. First of all the waiter was very helpful, attentive, and delightful through all 10 or so dishes - they're happy to explain what everything is. The portions are small, so it's enough food that you can still eat it all. They will alter your dishes to your dietary needs (example: I can't eat shrimp - not a problem). It was extremely fun to see what dish was coming next from an assortment of cold, hot, sushi, and desserts. My favorites were the Nobu ale, the black snapper (yes black, not red), the Japanese mountain peach fruit, the green tea fudge, and the foie gras that just melts in your mouth.",6CoMpwA8D2s00RfzpKDuOg,2,0,5,aTED2QmrJYM4IgzaeFgyAQ

2825138,2012-11-13,4,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I have been to Nobu probably 5 times over the last 12 years,,, for business meetings and such,,,. Even though I don't like it, no choice - but at least i don't have to pay...

OK, maybe the first time was fine. I didn't know much about Japanese food back then. So, sashimi with jalapeño/sesame oil, fish with some sort of Chinese sauce, and edamame were just fine. 

However, as I get to know more about Japanese food, this place seems to be just so-so,,, especially for me,, i have spent a lot of time visiting Japan lately and now I think I know what is good and what is bad. (All my Japanese friends say Nobu is FAKE and it is all about Hollywood celeb and media who tries to hype this place up. I heard it is out of Michelin rating in Tokyo this year. And Tokyo store is the best of all Nobu,,, so, you know what this means).

I mean, sashimi is ok. Sushi is not that special - sumeshi (sushi rice ball) isn't that good. Good sushi rice ball is a little sticky outside and super soft inside with mild, almost fruity vinegar flavor. Good sushi never fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. It requires experience and technique. Or maybe they use cheap rice from California.

But for sure, sushi chef here isn't there yet. Maybe they aren't trained in Japan. Fake. 

Anyway, this place is waaaaaaay overrated and overpriced. I give their food probably 3.5 stars,,, but the price!! WAAAY TOOOOO EXPENSIVE!

Is it romantic? Maybe yes for those who talk loud and keep spitting rice out of your mouth. Not for me. This place is LOUD.

I guess people go there to show off. Have you talked to your friends how much $$$$ you spent at Nobu? Listen to your mind. I am sure you have. 

This restaurant makes you feel you are celebrity - and this is pretty much it is all about.

If you like to eat good sushi - get a cab and go to Kabuto. If you like these rolls and wired sashimi, go to Sen of Japan to save a lot of money. If you like to eat sea bass with black bean sauce, go to Chinese restaurants.

I recommend ordering the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. It's very refreshing and deliciously fresh. I even ordered it as a sushi roll. As for the hot dish, the chicken skewers were okay.

We always start with the shrimp app that is deep fried and covered in deliciousness. I compare it to the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish, but Nobu's is better. 

We had the miso cod again, and it was even better this time. We also had several roles. I wasn't blown away with the yellow tail and jalapeno, but found the tempura shrimp very good.

I have been to one in NY before, and this was as good or probably better, but maybe its just a more recent and therefore more vivid memory.

Well I went for the upper tier Omakase, and did not regret it.  All of it was great, and I highly recommend the Omakase particularly if you upgrade to the tier 2 dinner.  Wow.  The sushi was great too - one really stole the show and needed an encore performance for my table - that was the Barracuda.  Never had anything like it.  Sometimes I have dreams about those pieces of Barracuda.

The dinner was complemented with a Kirin Zero (alcohol free beer), and a ginger beer.  The drinks were outstanding. I have never had a Kirin Zero before, but will seek it out in the future.

2841096,2009-04-18,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Wow. I was seriously impressed with this place. This place ranks second to French Laundry on my list of favorites. 

First- if you are a first time visitor there, I would recommend just ordering off of the menu. I am sure the Omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the Omakase. 

Second- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. It's okay- but the other items are so much better. We saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! 

Third- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. Just a FYI if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. I also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. I would pass on these- IMO the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. 

We started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. Pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. The sheshito peppers were really good. They taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. My husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. My only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! 

So we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: 

1. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - definitely get this- it was awesome! 

2. The blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening 

3. Chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce 

4. Kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great 

5. Lobster Ceviche- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming 

6. Red snapper with dry miso - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming 

7. Then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (CA rolls and Ama Ebi)- all which were fine. 

8. We ordered the bento box dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. 

Overall- the meal was great. The black miso cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). 

We had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. The whole meal with tip was just over $300. I highly recommend this place. It was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of Vegas that was great.",gBxIhdBw-NLcjV3XNUTxUw,2,1,5,DTwrViTVD96XXC06lLOLKA

I went with a couple of girl friends, and we took our time, ordered several different things, and even had a birthday dessert brought to us. I remember our waitress being EXCELLENT and I don't recall it being crowded or noisy. 

This past weekend, I went again, and things were a bit different. The sushi we ordered was not much better than cheaper places I've been and definitely not my favorite. I don't see where it was worth all the hype. If you're looking to try something new and out of the box, I think this is a good place to do it but if you're a fan of the traditional sushi that you can find anywhere, this is probably not the place. 

This will most likely be the last time I go to Nobu...not because I HATED the food, but because I really dislike the clientele. Too many snooty drunk people, talking way too loudly. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends. The waiter had a very heavy accent which made it near impossible to understand what he was saying. Not really his fault, but because of the loud groups of people nearby, it was pretty unbearable.

I am completely floored at the utterly disgusting meal I tried to ingest last night with my husband. I am a person who likes to consider myself a huge food critic and fanatic, and was repulsed by my meal at Nobu in Vegas.

First, we tried the restaurants ""most popular cold dish"" the yellow tail with jalapeno.  It was saturated in soy sauce with a splash of rice vinegar. How is that in any way shape or form a dish worthy of being proclaimed a restaurant favorite. My 2 year old niece could have whooped up that concoction in her plastic kitchen.  As someone who is considered a culinary marvel by many of her friends, that was such an insult to my palate and my wallet.

Next, the toban yaki was so repulsive, I couldn't honestly finish my meal. There were two shiitake mushrooms, 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 scallop, and 2 pieces of calamari  in a hot pot drenched in sake with a pinch of brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. WOW it tasted like the essence of Lysol. There were no complicated flavors and the presentation was so amateur, I felt utterly pissed that we trekked down to the Hard Rock for a meal unworthy of Benihanas...yes please note the sarcasm.

Finally, they brought out the beef tenderloin...my God it was at that point that we asked him to forget about our sushi and the rest of the meal, paid for the check, and walked out. They took a delicious, beautiful piece of tenderloin and threw it into a hot pot with the same horrid sake, soy sauce concoction as the seafood travesty.

Take it from someone who LOVES and ENJOYS fine dining to the highest degree - this place was horrendous! I give it 1 star because I have to actually rate it with something.

Nobu, you did NOT wow me.

Here's the bad:
You are far too loud for fine dining.  ""Am I having a fine meal or am I in a club?""  Because I don't know - and I'm really pissed off about that!
I could barely hear the waitress with all her training explain the food to me. (and since you did not provide a printed menu for the Chef's Tasting Menu) - I had no clue what some of the things I was eating even were.

You gave me disposable chopsticks...and not the nice kind... FOR F's SAKE NOBU, ARE YOU JOKING? $350+ Dinner?  Pathetic. (said with Disgust, and Distain)  I even asked for better chopsticks and was told you don't have them. (You are a JAPANESE RESTRAUNT - I am stunned...F@%ing stunned)

It melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - I am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just added to the silky flavor.  I would go back there just for that!   The desert was a rhubarb molten love with ice cream over it, talk about yummy!

Decor was a little drab to me, I dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but I think they could use some LIVE FISH Tank in the place, maybe I missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  I think a splash of color would have been nice.   Anyway, I am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    Quality stuff, Incredible food, great dining room, great location at Hard Rock.

At 9:45 the waiter let us know that  ""we apologize but we really need your table back.""  I thought this was a joke.  I ordered dessert, and when it was served the waiter said, ""please take a minute or two and then we really do need the table back.""

Awesome team. 

Now, food. Personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. The rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. DO go for the Chilean Sea Bass with dry miso. It's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the dry miso on top adds texture and will make your mouth water. A dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. Also, the uni shooter was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. I had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while!! Yum.

I quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and I am happy to say that I am ecstatic I did this, because had i not, I would have missed out on the Black cod with miso.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that I have ever tasted.

Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno - DELICIOUS!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. I couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)

Lobster Ceviche - I have no clue why they are calling this ""ceviche"" but I wish we would have ordered something else instead. It was merely OK,  It just kind of tasted like cold lobster in lettuce - but hey, i love lobster so  its all good :)

Black Cod with Miso - OMG - I just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. It is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. I like how crunchy and  soft it is..  delicioso~

Bento Box dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with Green tea ice cream) YUM YUM YUM YUM - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared with someone special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.

2983418,2018-06-27,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu participated in Restaurant Week, and this was what got me in the door.  I knew it was a pricey Sushi place, so I always hesitated in going since there are so many off-strip Sushi joints near my home that are great and less expensive.

But the pricey-ness will deter me no more!
I was very impressed with the service, quality of food and the Sake selection.  

Some of the food items we ordered from the RW tasting menu were better than others.  Our clear, hands-down favorites were the Black Cod lettuce wraps, Scallop rolls, Beef tenderloin and the 2 desserts - Suntory Cappuccino and the White Chocolate Pot de Crème.

I'd go back for the Black Cod lettuce wraps alone.  
They were sublime... absolutely melted in your mouth with a nice crunch and freshness from the baby butter lettuce that it was served in.  Mind you, you have to like fish because Black Cod does have a noticeable but pleasant fish oiliness to it... but it's so delicate and lovely that you just want more, more, more!

The most surprising dish was the Scallop roll.  I've had Scallop rolls in the past at other restaurants... but this was by far better than anything I've ever had.  This too melted in your mouth. It wasn't squishy but it wasn't chewy either.  It was the perfect, bite-size, morsel of yumminess.

The tenderloin... was tender and perfectly prepared... juicy with a slight sear.

We were not expected to be blown away by the desserts... in fact, I'm usually underwhelmed and don't normally order desserts at restaurants, but they were part of the RW menu so obviously we indulged.  I'm REALLY glad it was include in the RW menu!  They were desserts... so Yea... they were sweet, but they were not sugary-syrupy-sweet.  The ""cappuccino"" was not a drink... it was like a tiramisu but not.  I mean... it had layers like a tiramisu... where the bottom was a rich (but not too intense) dark chocolate cookie crust and then a layer of milk chocolate crème that was topped with a heavenly layer of whipped / airy whiskey foam.  And the White Chocolate Pot de Crème ... don't read the description as it really doesn't do it justice. Just trust me and the Amazing chefs at Nobu... this dessert is worth all the calories!  Light and Summery!  It's a complex white chocolate mousse with fresh citrus bits.  I know... that's not a great description but seriously... this is something to experience and savor each small spoonful slowly so that it lasts as long as possible until you are licking the dish. (I may or may not have done that. ha!)
Troy (our server) was Fantastic! And helped us pick out a Sake to accompany our dinner. It was flavorful on its own, yet complimented our entire meal.  
The food runners who present your dishes.... and YES, they present them to you... were wonderful and polite.  They position them before you and explain it before departing.  It's so nice to have your various courses presented to you and an explanation of how it was prepared and what's in it.
And I'm so happy to learn that they will continue operating under the new Virgin hotel that will be taking over the Hard Rock.

3014164,2010-02-18,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Before the concert started at the Hard Rock, I had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. At first I thought that steak might be a good idea, but I love Asian food and wanted a great experience. My boyfriend and I walked into Nobu, a Japanese restaurant. For our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.

Their menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. We decided to go with a little bit of everything.

Our favorite was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. Their tempura shrimp and vegetables were great also.

Overall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. I can't say much about their food because I have to say that I've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, Well Being in the Box.

Although their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the Guam experience as we could get. It was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.

I honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. That was majority of our bill. I do believe that their signature bento box dessert was worth 14 dollars. It was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea ice cream was just like home.

If you want something other than tempura for your experience at Nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. For myself, a good Japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way I've had it in Japan and on Guam from top Japanese chefs. However, this was not the case, unfortunately.

I give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,2,xmKLoYqgIlOgXc6Tq0mb-Q

3021402,2009-01-28,5,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I don't even know why I'm writing this stupid review.  You're gonna go to Nobu regardless of what I write so why the heck am I even bothering?

Why are you going to go?  I'll give you 3 reasons:

1)  REASONABLY WELL PREPARED DISHES
The fish is usually reasonably fresh because they crank out so much sushi nightly that every day new fish really has to be brought in.  The sauces used for any fish or meat dish are well balanced, savory, & time-tested - no need to worry about overly salty ponzu sauces or overbearingly sweet plum sauces.  A couple of key dishes to try, to experience what I'm talking about include:
-- Toro Tartar in Ponzu:  The ponzu the toro floats in is deliciously well made & is practically sipable after finishing the fish & the accompanying American Sturgeon caviar.  The ponzu doesn't utterly overshadow the delectable saltiness of the caviar which is surprising.
-- Kumamoto Oysters:  If you're one of those ""these shells are so small"" types, skip this dish.  This is for those that appreciate truly flavorful & tasty oysters - not beefy, characterless ones.  With these oysters, you can also appreciate the different sauce pairings the chef provides 

2)  THE ""IN"" or ""COOL PLACE"" TO GO
Guys - there's a lot of talent here so wear the good jeans.  Not that you're gonna hook up during your meal, but I'm just sayin' - it's doesn't hurt having legs-&-heels all around you.  Additionally, if you've got the coin & you come with your boys, passing plates around to try different dishes is cool.  As long as, again, you've got the coin because per person, this place is a good $100 easy so a group of 4 with sake can eclipse $500 after tip.   
Ladies- you're gonna get a lot of looks here & that's even before the sake goggles go on so if you're at ease with yourself enough to admit being the attention whore that you are, you're gonna love every minute of it.  Men constantly trot over from one table to another to ""say hi"" & guys without both style & money rarely bother going to Nobu.

3)  CONVENIENT
Goin' to a concert at the Joint?  Nobu's.  Goin' to Body English at 11PM?  Nobu's.  Gonna hang out at the Circle Bar?  Nobu's.  Gonna hit the tables later?  Nobu's.  Nobu's is the defacto restaurant to go to now that AJ's has shut down, Ago is kinda 'meh', & Pink Taco is better if you're just leisurely screwin' around.

WARNING #1:  NOBU'S SAKE LABEL
For sake rookies, please read:  Unlike most sushi restaurants, Nobu only has available his own sake label.  The sake behind Nobu's is actually the product of the Hokusetsu brewery in Niigata prefecture Japan, a cold but famous region of Honshu known for making ultra-refined but sometimes 'water-ish' & unpronounced sake.  If you want to get the most value from your sake purchase, DO NOT purchase the ""YK35"" or even the ""YK50"" for consuming while eating your other dishes, unless you plan on having just straight nigiri & none of those 'hot dishes'.  The fact is that the sake is so light & minimal in character that you won't taste any of it over your ""ponzu-laden tuna tataki"" & you might as well get something with a more earthy nuance like the Hokusetsu Onigoroshi which is much cheaper & something you can appreciate the taste of with a flavorful meal.

WARNING #2:  TOURISTY BAMBOO SAKE DECANTERS
For sake snobs:  They're gonna serve the sake in one of those novelty bamboo tokkuri by default.  Have them serve it in something else that's glass or ceramic.  Due to the porous/fiberous nature of the bamboo material, I don't believe these tokkuri get washed adequately & I've experienced very high variance - particularly in the nose - between YK35 served in the bamboo versus ceramic, for example.

WARNING #3:  GET RESERVATIONS
Tips to the hostesses won't matter.  If they don't have room, they don't have room.  Not even your host is gonna be able to squeeze you & your boys in if there's no tables available.

WARNING #4:  OMAKASE DOESN'T MATTER
If you actually know something about sushi, you'll agree:  The $150 Omakase at Nobu is really not that interesting or creative, nor is it that radically different from ordering  straight off the menu.  I've been going to Nobu for business dinners since before Simon was built across from it (which is now Ago) & contrary to what some other reviewers are raving about, there's VERY LITTLE that's innovative about Nobu's sushi or sashimi.  They might change up the fish in their sashimi tataki dishes or add some caviar here & there but at the end of the day, it's all the same - because the chef's don't have much time to care, & some of them actually aren't all that experienced.

CONCLUSION:
As sushi-on/near-the-strip goes, this is about as good as it gets.  Other restaurants may try to clone Nobu's dishes (like the toro tartar) but very consistently, the quality of fish/balance in preparation is what shines through @ the original & you'll only learn this with experience so go ahead & try others.  You'll be back.

I've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   After my recent visit I realized I have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  Here are some of my favorites:

Toro Tartare with Caviar - This dish makes me want to commit a felony.  If I were on death row it would be my last meal, I would definitely die happy.  As one of my favorite sayings on Howard Stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.

Yellowtail with Jalapenos - Always fresh and delicious!  I believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. 

Sashimi Salad - BAM!  The dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  

Kobe Beef Toban Yaki - I'm not a religious person by any means but I'm certain the heeled hands of Jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.

Nobu est une chaîne de restaurants japonais fondée à l'origine à New York et qu'on retrouve maintenant sur les 5 continents (quoique pas en France). Celui-ci est situé à l'intérieur du Hard Rock Hotel, un peu à l'écart du Strip : attention quand vous faites votre réservation car il y a 2 Nobu à Vegas, l'autre étant dans le Caesars, ne vous pointez pas au mauvais endroit...
La cuisine nippo-fusion du chef Nobu Matsuhisa est remarquable, les sensations gustatives surprenantes, raffinées, exotiques ! Vous pouvez vous laisser conseiller par le serveur ou aller à l'aventure dans la carte. Comme d'habitude dans un resto japonais, une ligne du menu n'est pas un plat suffisant en quantité pour votre repas : commandez plusieurs plats, d'un coup ou au fur et à mesure (le service est rapide), pour varier les plaisirs.
Parlant de service, il est aux petits soins, sympathique mais curieusement familier, même au standard américain : pas du tout gênant, mais je m'attendais à un tout petit peu plus de formalisme. Bon c'est Vegas, peut-être qu'à New York il en va autrement.
L'addition vient vous rappeler qu'on est dans un resto de stars (Robert de Niro est co-propriétaire) : comptez 200 dollars par personne tout compris (ouch) si vous voulez vous faire plaisir, ce qui est quand même le but de l'opération !

Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.

We bought the $95 Groupon ($150 value) which included a five-course tasting menu for two. My favorite was the first dish, their signature yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. I do agree with other reviewers who said the sashimi was a bit thin, but wow did it taste great. The dessert dish was a close second favorite. It included a molten chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, and a whiskey-infused cappuccino-like dessert. My least favorite was the assorted sushi dish that included a california roll and six pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon, and snapper). Every other dish was unique and full of flavor, while this assorted sushi dish was average at best.

Aside from the five-course meal, we also ordered their popular cucumber martini. It was a strong little drink with a fantastically fresh aroma. I don't often love the scent of alcohol but this drink was a definite exception.

We had a very satisfying experience overall. Although slow at times, the service was great and every dish was thoroughly explained. The manager was also quite nice and stopped to speak with us for a moment.

We weren't entirely stuffed by the end of our five courses, but we were full enough. Overall, the food-tasting was a true experience and definitely worth a try, but this isn't a place I would frequent due to their notably high prices.

The Rock Shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. Our server offered a variation of my favorite black miso cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much I ordered a second. 

For our special adventure we opted for the Hearts of Palm pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet Clarence loved it! Last and should have been first was their Miso soup- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and I enjoy it as a finish. 

The Wagyu Beef was so tempting but I passed. It is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... Honestly we have never been disappointed in a Nobu splurge.

As for the food it's 40-50% the quality of their NYC counterpart - and that's generous.

3233398,2007-12-06,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I've heard various friends praise Los Angeles's Nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the Las Vegas Marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate with some first-class sushi.

We had reservations at 9:00 PM, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). My first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a Tuesday night), and its location in the Hard Rock Hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place I want to poke around).

Our waiter, Justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get miso soup.

Our first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). The servers apologized and took it away. At the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. Fortunately, it was corrected quickly.

When our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the spicy scallops had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of spicy tuna. Again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.

Service got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. We were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. She seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.

Still, however, Justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (I think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.

Regarding the food, it was OK. The miso soup was great. The spicy tuna and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. It was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, ""Is this supposed to be this way and I'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?"" Judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. Either way, I wasn't really in love with it.

For the price I [would have] paid, I can't say that the Las Vegas Nobu is really worth it for me again. I've had much better sushi in Oakland, for much less.",1GOUBrDAdrLddoxUbrQbrQ,0,0,2,8c7Ol7_n4GhTUuBC4ebFWg

3250574,2007-01-04,5,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Matsuhisa Nobu, I salute you! Your food is divine. I am jealous of your restaurant's decor. I envy your river stone wall. I wish I was a celebrity so I wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! I simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...

Nobu (in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've also been to Matsuhisa's in Los Angeles, but there's nothing like the Nobu experience. It's Vegas baby!!

Anyway, I've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at Nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). One of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...SCORE! It also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. Never worked for me...kept dropping the money...

Back to the food: pricey? Abso-friggin'-lutely! Take one look at the place. Nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. The Hard Rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. They need some way to pay the rent, right?

But is the food tasty? Hells to the yeah, it is! Every single dish I've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that I'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). The sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only I could be there right now... Their desserts are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. The last time I was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now I've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).

As I mentioned before, this place can get pricey. But, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). Tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (I'm not a big fan of uni (sea urchin), so I let 'em know that...thanks Nobu!). I believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time I visited. But, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of Nobu's offerings. It's all up to you.

Since Nobu's in a Vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. The first time I ate there, my wife and I were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) C'mon! Who wears a cowboy hat in a Japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! Porn stars! That's who! I also walked past ex-San Francisco 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, Enrique Iglesias, and Enrique Iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).

It was not hot, the miso wasn't cooked through (hard to explain), and the skin of the fish was soggy.  I also ordered the Las Vegas special Salmon Nashi which raved about a Japanese pear, truffle salts, and unforgettable other ingredients.  While the concept seems interesting, the execution was flawed.  The pear portion size to the salmon sashimi doesn't work.  Its far too big and takes away from the salmon leaving a confusing fruit and raw fish situation.  Also, the cuts of pear and salmon were inconsistent - just bad.  I spoke with the server and the man behind the sushi bar.  To sum it up they shrugged their shoulders.  They did not offer a better replacement or any other dish to maybe turn my experience around.

My sister and took turns trying to con each other out of it...only a fish this delicious could spark chopstick violence between two loving siblings.

The creamy spicy crab was actually both creamy and spicy...and well spicy at that.  If you are used to things being under-spiced, then you would be pleased with this dish.  Tasty but not dangerous.

Maybe it's because I didn't order the Omakase menu like most people who like this place, but I would think that when you're spending the kind of money you do at this place, even their regular dishes should be a cut above the rest, but they were not.

This is also the first place where I ever sent anything back.  The staff recommended a drink (some apple concoction) that turned out to be just terrible.  I'm not at all discriminating when it comes to alcoholic beverages (if it has alcohol and I can keep it down, fine by me!), but this drink was just so horrible that I couldn't take more than a couple of sips.

Two of us went and tried the following:
1) Salmon Belly - $30. meh - had a wierd honey mustard sauce on them.
2) Uni tempura - $15-20 (i forget) - it was okay but nothing special.
3) Black cod Miso - $20ish - fine, but this is a cliche at japanese restaurants at this point.  They tried to offer it in ""lettuce wrap"" form which should have been a huge red flag.
4) Live Scallop - the best dish we tried - simple, spicy. i forget the price.
5) BIG MISTAKE - Kobe beef tacos. $42. Three tacos, half the size of our palm, and tasted like street meat. 

It was difficult to avoid fried, saucy, overwrought dishes.  If I were to characterize this restaurant in one sentence it would be:

Japanese Cheesecake Factory.

We ordered a couple bottles of Sake which pushed up the final price, but we wound up spending about $180 per person for a very mediocre meal that left us still kind of hungry. 

Atmosphere (in the Hard Rock Hotel) was also subpar - could have been any vegas restaurant and the service was not particularly good either.

The two bartenders that were working were vastly different. One (younger guy, I think his name was Rob) was upbeat and very nice. The other guy made us feel beyond unwelcomed and like we were more of a bother to him then anything. 
We chose the chef platter. This came with 10 pieces of fish,  5 different types. It also came with a Himalayan salt block which was amazing! Everything was so fresh and amazing quality.

- lobster tempura - 5 stars - so flavorful meaty chunks of fresh lobster tail deep fried with a thin layer of tempura along with 4 different delicious sauces
- black cod with miso sauce served in lettuce shells - 5 stars - fantastic
- yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - 5 stars - fantastic and yummy pieces of yellowtail with jalapeno and also soaking in a delicious light sauce (no need to add own soy sauce)
- ahi tuna in special light sauce - 5 stars fantastic too
- chucks of ahi tuna in little mini taco shells - 3 stars - the flavor of the tuna was lost among the deep fried taste of the taco shells
- beef tenderloin - 3 stars - was nice but nothing too special

The atmosphere is elegant but cool with a nice Vegas buzz and liveliness. This elegant Japanese place seemed a bit oddly located in the crazy and informal confines of the Hard Rock Casino.

We ordered a gamut of different dishes: shishito peppers, edamame, wagyu beef, jalapeño yellowtail, rock shrimp tempura, lamp chop, otoro and salmon sashimi, miso black cod. 

I thought I was assembling a Nobu all-star meal; what we ended up with was a mediocre and extremely overpriced meal.  For every dish that we  ordered, I could list a superior counterpart at Japonais or Sunda in Chicago for a fraction of the cost.

Also of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  The wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.

Yellowtail Jalapeno -I'm not a fan of spicy but this does add a nice kick to the yellowtail.
Black Cod Miso - This was surprisingly really good. The fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it. 
Assorted sushi -This is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price.
Miso Soup -I'm only commenting about this because I love how they call it ""sipping soup"" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's miso soup.
Mochi was pretty delicious but I'm sure this was purchased at your local Trader Joes or Mitsuwa.

Anyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the décor and if it's restaurant week. I would consider this place Asian fusion more than Japanese but eh, if you're craving Asian food and you're staying at the Hard Rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,2,0,3,G5gvNduct5QFzGP7j18AWg

3549439,2012-07-23,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu was my first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant (one star).

Omakase is the Japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic European cuisine.  It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.

If your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.

One really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.

Having lived in the Seattle area most of my life, I've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  However, I was astounded by how good the dishes are at Nobu.  Insanely good flavors and worth the price jump.",iUDzpMHEEM9p6TAtFqZe_w,0,0,5,lMpvNIfaL7UCf9xyrpYxiQ

The music is loud for a Japanese restaurant which makes it hard to communicate. The menu needs to explain a bit more about main ingredients than just categorizing food as cold and hot. I had spicy edamame which was not complementary as in some Japanese places. The edamame had peanut soy sauce on it and it was yum. Then I had two orders of rainbow roll since the rolls are much smaller. Plus points for staff attentiveness but be ware of the mystery hand coming from behind and removing unfinished drinks. Prices are steep and portions are small but there's quality and freshness in every bite. Taste profile is subtle and authentic.

For those who want a simple yes/no - YES, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than I think Nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it. 

Our party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. At $100 a person, he said he could give us the Grand Prix. We had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod, 
creamy spicy crab, etc. Other people have mentioned the Black Cod - I would just add that my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good. 

One person in our group was vegetarian, and I have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! SO MANY OPTIONS FOR VEGETARIANS!

The food was great to say the least. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. There was honestly nothing to complain about.

3565966,2008-11-25,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I agree with Ming-Jou in the fact that I was totally disappointed at this place. I should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being Japanese, I wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  We had reservations at 9 PM and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  It was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  Also, the crowd was much older than I anticipated.  The interior had a nice Asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.

For starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar with caviar, and tempura.  The menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  I wish the menu would have included more details.  We got to order individual tempura items, which was a ""first"" for me.  We ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  The order came with 2 pieces each.  I liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  Also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  Most places give you barely enough sauce.  For dinner, we shared the sushi dinner which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (tuna roll).  The sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  Also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  Fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  That ruined my dinner.

We decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an Asian restaurant.  We tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  It came with soy caramel glaze and edamame ice cream.  The cake was yummier than I expected.  

Overall, it was not as good as I expected but I'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.",RdGgH2C655oklnPT3oZJ0A,0,0,3,c9mZcntU-L-fFET4BELMyg

The three of us shared a bamboo sake order, many many appetizers, one main course, and a green tea ice cream.  I was surprised that it was under $300, and we were stuffed AND satisfied.

The lobster salad was great; you really do get an entire lobster!  The only thing we didn't love was the squid pasta salad, but it was still decent.  I was a little disappointed that for the prices we're paying, we still weren't getting real wasabi.

The service was great despite how busy it was.  I had reserved 9 days in advance but still could only get a 10pm reservation.  I was concerned that the service, selection, and quality wouldn't be up to par since the kitchen supposedly closed at 11pm, but this was not the case.

We get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  Our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.

First course- Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll- it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!

Second course- Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze.  Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. 

Third Course- Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu- AMAZING!  So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce- Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man.

Cons:  Hard to get a table the same day, somewhat over-priced.
The server recommended the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi, which was great.  The other sushi rolls we ordered were average.  We also ordered toro, but when it came out, it didn't look or taste like toro. Strange...

Staff was attentive and fish was really fresh.  We were actually quite surprised when we went through the front and was led to our table: the place looks like a cafeteria with tables very close to each other.  Luckily there were no one next to us so we didn't ask to change a location.  And the disposable chopsticks make it feel more like a cafeteria...it's just like eating with plastic forks and spoons...

We had the tasting menu and there were 5 courses.  They served us some soba fritters to start with, and it was quite disappointing.  It was way too greasy and strong tasting food to start the dinner, and I needed to wash it down with lots of water.  It should be paired with Chinese tea...lol

The first 2 courses were a Shiromi Usuzukuri with ponzu and assorted nigiri sushi, the white fish was really fresh and the tuna was really good too.  

The next 2 courses were hot dishes, and for the first hot dish we got to pick between shrimp tempura and pan seared scallops.  We picked the scallops because we were never a big fan of deep fried food.  But the server made a mistake and served us the tempura, we told them that was not what we ordered, and they brought the scallops without taking away the shrimp, so we had both dishes to try out! (YAY!) The shrimp was very similar to the walnut shrimp you can find in Chinese restaurants, only without the walnuts..I find this dish quite another bummer.  But then the pan seared scallops with edamame hummus came to the rescue and it was so so GOOD!! The scallops were fresh and huge, and the hummus really complements the scallops!

Then the second hot dish was the Black cod miso: very very delicious, love it!!!

The last course was dessert and we got the SUNTORY CAPPUCCINO which had many layers 
including Coffee Cream, Whisky Foam & Milk Ice Cream. It tasted like tiramisu in some ways, but a lot more tasty. Very light and not too sweet.

I mean, it's great, but I think the sashimi plate is a better deal with more flavor. Like Blair B. said, get the unique plates here.

As a side note, Nobu participated in the Taste of the Nation, Las Vegas, which is a fundraiser to end childhood hunger in Nevada. Nobu cares about our community. I really appreciate that!

Service at Nobu is really out of this world.

Nobu's bento box is my favorite dessert of all time, so much so that I replicate it at home with success--flour-less chocolate cake with green tea ice cream and hot fudge. Lord have mercy I am in heaven!

We were greeted by the host and she took us to our table. I do know it is Vegas so there were other large parties there which were ready to party so it was a bit loud. It was a little hard to talk without having a lot of background noise. 

But let's talk about the food. I tried the wagyu tacos which were ant sized but it was nice to try them. The scallops were very tasty but it was such a strong flavor that the more you keep eating it, you grow a little tired and need something else to balance it out. We also tried the yellowtail sashimi which was also good. My favorite dish hands down were the uni scoops in a spoon. Our waiter recommended it and it was to die for!

3703547,2010-08-09,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Finally - the meal to kill all meals.  This is when I regret NOT taking a picture of every dish and writing down the name and ingredients. I forgot I even had a food blog until  of the way into my dinner. That is definitely a compliment!

Nobu is famous for a reason. If you are going to eat here, prepare to drop some money. $100 pp minimum, $150 pp is more like it and that's without drinks.  Interestingly, even though you feel like you ate a ton of food, it really isn't that much. If you have a big eater in your group, have him/her eat something first. This is a place to savor each bite, not to eat like pigs at a trough. (That's what the Planet Hollywood buffet is for.)  And when they ask if you want edamame, they are $7 a bowl, not free. 

The restaurant is gorgeous. We had reservations at 7:00 on a Saturday, and even though we arrived at 6:20, we were seated immediately.  Dress was anywhere from casual to dressy, even jeans (which leads me to the old adage - just because you can, doesn't mean you should.)

I had ordered a blueberry mojito ($15) but only took a small sip when I realized it was WAY too strong. The waiter took it off the bill without me having to complain about it. That's ok - the food was so good, I was fine with water.

Instead of ordering off the menu, we went Omakase style - the chef makes the selections. Actually, it seems like your waiter makes the selections but that's close enough. The waiter asked us our likes and dislikes so he could tailor our food to our tastes. We said we didn't eat mussels, clams, oysters and that sort of thing. Other than that, it was going to be a free for all. (In listening to the other servers describe dishes to the other customers, I suspect there is a standard Omakase menu.)

The menu was chosen to give a different sensation with each dish. We started with the cold dishes, had two hot dishes and then continued with more cold dishes (which don't seem to fill you up for some reason.)

The first selection was yellowtail sashimi with miso with a shaved bit of jalapeno and a cilantro leaf for each bite. I don't like spicy foods so I was hesitant about the jalepeno. But I'm glad I tried it. YOWZA - the jalapeno was small enough to give you that kick without making you scream for water. And the cilantro cooled down the fire. The yellowtail was so fresh, you wouldn't even know it was fish. I've never ordered sashimi before and I'm hooked. Wow, wow, wow.

The next choice was whitefish sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips. I wish I could have poured the sauce in a cup and drank it, it was THAT flavorful. 

We had salmon sashimi with caviar and dill, blue fin toro sashimi, Japanese red snapper with dried miso and seared tuna with ponzu. Every dish kept getting better and better and had its own unique flavor and special quality to it. 

Our hot dishes consisted of beef tenderloin with a butternut squash base and topped with cooked purple onions. The beef was so tender, it fell apart with the chopsticks.  Our second hot dish was 2 pieces of cod and 2 pieces of scallops baked in phyllo - both in butter lettuce cups.  I preferred the scallops over the cod which surprised me because I've never eaten scallops before and I generally like cod. 

My least favorite dish was the hearts of palm salad. It was a nice change to the other fish items but probably not worth $20. 
The servers were so attentive - both in bringing the food and the clean up afterward.

My recommendations to enjoying Nobo (1) realize that you're going to spend a ton of money so quit whining about the price or eat at HomeTown Buffet (2) don't order off the menu - the point is to try something new that you would never otherwise see at your favorite sushi place (ie - don't order friggin' tempura or California rolls at Nobu and then complain that it tastes better at your local strip mall) (3) come here with 4 or less people. People tend to be greedier when they are in big groups so you may pay $150 and eat 4 bites of sashimi which would be a total rip off. (4) you're not there to stuff yourself (see #1), you're there to appreciate the art of food.  So sit back, let someone else do the ordering and savor every bite.",waN2C2BTxbZdSjp09FgjFg,2,1,5,kcDl-maRYG93G5VrzA8Lkw

3713546,2013-06-05,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Oh Nobu, how fun it is to say your name :)

Soooo ... I'm not a frequenter of the Hard Rock (because either you stay there or you have to cab it from the strip - and I ain't made o' money people), but last time I was there I had to stop in and try the (in)famous Nobu!

Now ... to be fair I had no idea this place was famous (the rock I live under doesn't get the food channel), and I thought it was mostly a sushi place (which it isn't - according to the waiter), but I had a great time anyway. 

As soon as you sit down the waiter comes and tells you about the place and what they do. Apparently they cater the menu to the group on the table etc. I wouldn't know that because we actually never got a menu. The waiter told us about the famous Omakase (where the chef's send you what they want for ridiculous amounts of money) and we were sold!! 

We got three different tears of Omakase - $110, $125 & $150 - so that we could try a little bit of everything. It's an 8 course array of hot and cold dishes. If you get this, prepare to wait ... it took us a solid 2 hours to get through the 8 courses - which gets you full and drunk if you're drinking like we were (the sake comes in cute tea pots and the plum wine is amazing). 

I will say that the best bang for your buck is definitely the $125 dollar option. It's worth the $15 upgrade. The $150 option is when you can tell they're trying a little too hard to be different (food doesn't have to be unpronounceable, it just has to be good). 

Most of the dishes were actually pretty good - but there were a few that were underwhelming (the hot dishes in particular were not great - and those were the ones the waiter said they were known for). I did enjoy the pallet cleansers a lot though. 

The great thing about a place like Nobu is that no matter how fancy it is, it's still in the hard rock, and you'll still find a group of bachelors blowing up penis balloons and sending them flying around the restaurant (one even hit  me on the back of the head - war wounds are sexy!).",-RApyq06DMBii7ovXtQnfw,1,0,4,nfXK9ZBp5B4GhixgDVVxcw

We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish.
Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.
Blue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.

And the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. It makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.

3809107,2008-09-13,5,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu Vegas, much like other Vegas Strip satellite restaurants = meh.

I can't give it 2 stars, because the food is too good for that. Not great, like a real Nobu, but good. When you factor in the cost (2 of us spent over $400), it comes nowhere near what its name would imply.


DECOR
The decor is trying too hard, pulling in all directions. There are individually cool elements, like the river rock wall, or the exploded hashi ceiling. But there are at least 5 different themes like this all smashed together. Complete contrast to japanese design principles of linear minimalism. Must be the Vegas factor.


FOOD
Started out pretty good, with a Toro-Caviar dish. Great mix of flavors and a unique sauce. Everything after that, including the sushi, was was just good. A beef tenderloin dish came out steaming hot, but with little flavor and essentially raw asparagus and enoki still clumped together on top, like it just got unwrapped from the plastic pkg. I've eaten better in strip mall Japanese (many of these are surprisingly good!). I'm not a Japanese food expert/snob, but I've lived in Japan, worked in Japanese restaurants and cook a lot of Japanese dishes at home. Then again, so do millions of Japanese people, and they're not all snobs or experts. But I know how to compare Japanese-inspired food experiences. I also realize there is a fusion element going on at Nobu, but that is done much better at places like Sea Saw in Scottsdale. Overall = disappointing.


OTHER FACTORS I'M NOT COUNTING IN MY EVALUATION
(but worth noting for lols)

THOR
Our waiter was absolutely unintelligible. We nicknamed him Thor. He looked like a Norwegian model from a 1976 Playgirl. Very nice guy, but we just pretended to understand what he said. Every time he walked away, we both said: ""You catch any of that??? Me neither!"" No complaints on the service, just glad the menu was available to point at.

BLIND DATE VEGAS
The table next to us was fookin hilarious. It was the most awkward blind date I've ever witnessed, not on TV. We kept looking around for cameras, because we swore this was a setup for a show. It is a crime that this was not captured on video. This middle-aged blowhard had this girl,  who had to be 20 years younger (NTTAWWT), held captive while he ranted about his boat and his travels and his companies (plural!) that he coudln't talk about because of his work with the NSA. He'd have to kill the whole restaurant if he told us. And he WAS talking to the whole restaurant. He insisted on feeding her from his chopsticks, for every bite. He kept asking for her review of the date, during the date. EPIC DEFEAT. He let us all know that he had to ask the universe for the right person to meet. The girl seemed to politely disagree with the universe. Bless her heart. She was a trooper.

Also, his chopstick skills were so good because he was ""raised in Japan"", but when she wanted him to speak Japanese, somehow that got by his experience of being raised there.


so...

Nobu, meh.

Thor, enjoy Valhalla.

3871298,2011-08-05,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"When I criticized Morimoto Napa for being like a ""Vegas restaurant,"" I now realize I was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  Chef Nobu has a signature, Peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.

Uni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money ladder.

The tataki plates of Kobe-""style"" beef are great and totally worth the price.  They're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.

King crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.

The same goes for the lobster salad; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the lobster was lost.  But the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.

The black cod with miso is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  Miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  That's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  And I *love* miso.

Maki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  That's a first for me.  I'm not sure I get the logic behind it.  The special house rolls e.g. with jalapeño are tasty enough, but generally the additional flavors don't complement the fish very well.

The sushi itself is perfectly made.  The knife work and rice preparation and rolling are impeccable.

Nobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  It's also to be expected from Las Vegas.  

I'd certainly recommend Nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  I don't think I'd recommend much beyond that.  Japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  Nor does it need an additional side of ponzu sauce.",3e-BITbm264Cq4pS_kF8rw,0,1,3,owAi7-P2b1bNEbXa6sibQg

I found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. We are in Vegas, I know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, I expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.

Our waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common Japanese dishes.

We tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to spicy scallops, freshwater eel, albacore, and yellowtail with jalapenos. Everything was... good. Not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.

The interior of this location was bland. One of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. The main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.

When we found out we had a table waiting for us at Nobu, I was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  We ordered: The miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a soft shell crab roll, the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer, the mushroom salad, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  To drink I had the cucumber martini.  It was seriously one of the best drinks I have ever had.  It tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  Unfortunately our positive experience ended there.  After waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  We sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  I glanced at the menus, waited.  Our waiter came by and I asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  We had no water, and no menus.  Finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying ""We're a little short on menus.""  We shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  We asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  We finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.  Before I could order anything else, he rushes off.  The next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.  Pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  I can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.  The vegetable cut roll was pretty good, I mean, steamed vegetables, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  The mushroom salad was pretty gross.  The mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  The sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  Everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  Everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  Mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  When the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  His response?  ""No you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.""  I secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in San Francisco for a quarter of the price.  Overall verdict:  Skip it.  The atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.

As food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of Nobu.  This chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  While some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  

My sushi-fanatic friend and I recently booked a trip to Vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try Nobu.  I knew that my friend was focused on it, so I went along with the recommendation, though I knew better.  We wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.

Our reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  My friend ordered a glass of sangria, while I opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that I needed to exchange it for a basic glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  The wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.

In terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  A tiny mound of cool, fresh Salmon Tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty Caviar.  I am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  This particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  We also sampled one of my favorites - the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Sauce.  The succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce added a creamy kick. 

My friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style House Special Roll and the Spicy Scallop Roll.  The spicy scallop one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  We actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.

Unfortunately, I think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  I would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.",oCYxjlqjpnW5WJAo6HNR0A,1,0,3,gWJb2cvzUbGZwTd66iSWtA

Decor was upscale, modern, clean and interesting. Cocktails were properly made and amazing. True mixologist behind their bar. The only reason for 3 stars was the service. Specifically the waitress. The most unaccomadating server I have ever experienced. I was truly shocked to be treated that way in fine dining. Disappointed that their management would be employing a waitress that would fit a Denny's or Ihop better. Somewhere you expect mediocre service. Usually upscale restaurants will make your experience perfect, or at least try. She made us feel unwelcome and that we were majorly inconveniencing her. She gave us attitude for not choosing a set menu, when our party was only 11 people. She seemed so irritated that she had to do her job and ask for all our orders individually instead of us saying yes we will take a $100 per person set menu with no idea what was going to be served, when a few in our party had allergies. I have been in the service industry for 15 years, I would never treat a table in such a lazy-I don't give a crap about you manner. She refused to spilt our bill.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the exceptional staff and the green tea ice cream. 

The chef's sushi dinner was third rate.  The fish was the ordinary fare:  tuna, yellow tail, sea urchin, sweet shrimp and unagi nigiri.  Plus tiny spicy tuna rolls.  I wish I could say that at least the fish cuts were exceptional quality.  They were not.  They tasted worse than cheap sushi from a sacramento discount sushi bar.

When our new baby turned 2 months old, my husband and I decided it was time for a real, baby-free date. Seeing as how I had not eaten sushi for the preceding 9 months, it had been on my mind for a long time. And when I want some serious sushi, there's only one place to go - NOBU!

In all actuality, you shouldn't really order off the sushi menu at Nobu - it's good and all, but it's about twice as much as comparable sushi at, say, Osaka. What you really want is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, the black cod with miso, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends. 

Not sure what else I can add that hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, Nobu is awesome. 

Side note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu). Otherwise, MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Our party of five were here back in late September, but the yellowtail sashimi + jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura, mixed seafood ceviche, and tiradito still bring very happy memories.

It has a hint of that SNL-Jeffrey's vibe that makes me a little queasy.  Nonetheless, after several small dishes with a round of alcohol shared among five friends, it was actually a very reasonable price for fine dining on the Strip.

I live in the SF Bay Area where we have a million sushi joints and I have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as Nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because I crave yummy sashimi. The spicy miso lotus chips with big eye tuna is delish too! Actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried. 

Nobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. We are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! Our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). The other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned.

The decor is very nice, the dudes behind the counter making sushi and other Japanese dishes is cool to watch, and the huge bottle of saki is fun ( a bottle of house saki is around $150).  For around $150-300 (not including bar tab) per person you get family style eating of fresh Japanese food. There are approximately 7 courses brought out, one at a time, a delicious and fresh array.  The raw ahi with a dash of caviar, lettuce wraps, steak on the mini hibachi, etc., was fun to see what would arrive next. The service was impeccable, the place is clean (although I don't like that you have to exit the restaurant to use the restroom) and food quality excellent.

Only three stars for me because it cost me $150 after one beer and splitting some sake four ways. The food was kinda heavy, so I felt very bloated after.

4165132,2016-06-06,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Overall, the original Nobu (Hard Rock Hotel) is a great experience, both from an ambiance perspective and naturally, quality of food. (As an aside, the Caesar's Palace location is newer and busier but given that this is the original Vegas location, it appears more logical to start here if you have never experience Nobu before.) 

Given that we were not famished, we asked the waitress to help us craft a light menu that still allowed us to experience Chef Matsuhisa. We started off with mocktails followed by Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño (which had just the right kick and freshness). Then we had the New Style Sashimi (Salmon), followed by Black Cod, and finally two sushi rolls, the soft shell crab and shrimp tempura. Overall, the dishes were varied, flavorful, and yet light. 

We ended the night with recommended dessert - Sata Andagi - which I was admittedly unsure about upfront - however, after experiencing it, I was surprised I had never tried such an amazing dessert combination before. The Apricot Doughnut was one of the best desserts I've had and was perfectly complimented by white chocolate crumbs and the black tea ice cream.

Now to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended I try their specialty dishes. Which I did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with Jalapeño, to the black cod miso. Now I did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the Chef's sashimi which was ehh. Next time I will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. What made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, I ended up going with the Vanilla Tapioca. Sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.

The sushi portions were tiny.  The rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so I had to inform them).  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  The yellowtail jalapeno sashimi was beautiful but boring.  Same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  Miso cod was still excellent.

4211274,2006-11-21,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. My wife and I aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...I understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, IMO.

We went on a Sunday night at 7:30p. We were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. My wife had the Passion Mojito, and I stuck with a Sapporo because I'm not a huge fan of sake. The drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the Omakase.

There are two basic ""levels"" of Omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. The lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more ""exotic"". We both opted for the latter. I was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so I likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. 

- Kumamoto Oyster, on the half-shell, with Nobu Salsa
- Sweet Shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)
- Some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, I'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)
All three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, I think, ponzu sauce. The oyster was pretty large, such that I didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. The sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what I'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than I would expect, but still very good.

- Kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom 
Kampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. The kelp and mushroom, I think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. 

- New-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side
They have a really good sauce for the uni, because I don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) The unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.

- Toro salad with vegetable spring roll
I wasn't crazy about the spring roll...I thought it was bland. The toro salad, however, was very good.

- Green tea & Ume sorbet
I guess this was a palate cleanser? I wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. After the server brought it out, I told my wife, ""Thank you for dining at Nobu, please come back soon."" Anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.

- Broiled snapper over risotto with snow crab meat, topped with a white truffle chip 
The hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. The risotto was OK, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.

- Small, sliced, grilled ""Kobe"" beef tenderloin with Okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled Japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled foie gras.
I'm going to commit heresy in a bit...I put Kobe in quotes, because I hear a bunch of stories about whether or not Kobe is Kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. Great dish. I don't really like eggplant, but this was OK, so they did something right. I'd never had foie gras before, and, well, meh? There, I said it.

- Miso soup with clam
Another break, like the sorbet. It wasn't bad or anything, but I was getting kinda full, so I almost skipped it. (almost).

- Nigiri sampler: Oh Toro, pink snapper, sardine, snow crab, jumbo clam
The clam was fresh and crunchy, but the snow crab was pretty ordinary. This was only the second time I've had sardine nigiri. I like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, I think it's just too oily? I couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. My wife told me the Oh Toro was awful and that I should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. I love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) Try the Oh Toro.

- Blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.
Full. I almost had to pass on dessert (almost). Again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. 

The service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. Our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.

We also had yellowtail shashimi with jalapenos which was very good as well. However, nothing touches the Black Cod Miso. Cons - The place is very loud. Hard Rock Hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of Vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. The staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. The staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. Just stand your ground and go for what you want. Also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of Fiji water right off the bat. Smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead.
Pros - have I mentioned the Black Cod Miso? The best thing I have ever had pass my lips. The people watching is top notch really every meal on a Vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. The show at Nobu is one of the best. With the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) I was laughing a majority of the time.

4250176,2009-09-11,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.

there were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.

there's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  So use your imagination..

course 1 - a bonito sashimi.
course 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.
course 3 - toro sashimi with ponzu ginger sauce and jalapeno sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.
course 4 - seared scallops on a bed of sea beans.
course 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried foie gras.
course 6 - sushi set (nigiri) with lobster broth and lobster chunks.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (red snapper) and tamago.
course 7 - an array of sweets including mochi ice cream, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.

..

all in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  

i was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like LA, SF, NY, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.

i truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am TOTALLY infatuated with bone marrow.

The reason why I am giving it a 3 star instead of 5 is because I've been to the Malibu location for Nobu and it is a lot better. Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. I would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside. 

Other than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too!

Food: Overall pretty good, but not worth the price. 
Sushi is quite good, but in my opinion isn't worth the price. Nothing is wrong with it, but they charge several dollars for each piece as opposed to roll. You can go to other places and have similar quality sushi at a fraction of cost.
Unfortunately I can't recommend the rock shrimp tempura with creamy sauce. It looks better than the actual taste. It lacked flavor. 

Drinks:
There was an old fashioned here that was incredible! It wasn't the one I can't remember the full name, but it was like ""Applewood..."". 
- It wasn't the  barrel aged kikori old fashion. 
I typically don't drink old fashions but I definitely asked for another.

While Kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :P), Nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. From tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and desserts.

The sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag. 

Also we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!

Great and memorable is how I would describe it. I HATE cherries. HATE. No cherry flavor. Instead, the way he does it creates body and more subtle flavor, enhancing the drink.

I'd been wanting to try out one of the LA locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. Overall, the experience was pretty great. The service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)

The meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. Standard at any Japanese place you'd go to. The first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. This was so good!! I'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night.

Next up was the Rock Shrimp Tempura. This was alright. I liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... My friend and I agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express. 

Third entree up was the Black Cod Miso. This was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. The fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great. 

The fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was California Roll and assorted Nigiri. Maybe it's just because I live in LA and I'm spoiled by great sushi, but I wasn't impressed. The fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, Sugarfish. And at the heart of it all, Nobu is a Japanese restaurant, so I expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. Sadly, not the case.

The meal ended with the Bento Box dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and some cappuccino thing. I'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. I've never disliked any green tea ice cream I've had and the cappuccino thing was unique. 

Overall, it was a great meal and good experience. Without a doubt, it was worth the price of the Groupon. Not sure about full price though. I think only the Yellowtail sashimi and black cod miso would be worth it.",_bTB9W3jDWdDcsJuv111Hg,0,0,4,IdK_j3KLrYVXoQRn8pZSng

The decor was nothing to write home about. I think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were Ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out. 

First of all, I couldn't understand the cutesy English the waitress was speaking. Each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. Then it'd be followed by, ""I'm sorry, what?""

We ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the crab ceviche, and some grilled beef thing. The ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. I think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. There was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. We next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. Again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. Finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as I expected.

For being ""Nobu,"" I did have high expectations. But DK and I evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good.

For me, what sets Nobu apart is the freshness of the fish, and the perfect cut of fish paired with the perfect amount of rice. It's all about getting that balance right.

Although I frequent Japanese and Sushi restaurants this menu contained many things I had never had before. Most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). We chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. 
The yellowtail tartar was great, the lobster ceviche was not so. The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size).

Now, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, I was expecting to be WOWED. I've eaten some amazing food in Vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. But this was not to be unfortunately. Now, I don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. Either way, I was just not impressed. We ordered red snapper sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. Next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. This too was bland & boring. Then I ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. This was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! Fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? I discovered the answer when I noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. Boo!! This caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. Finished off with rock shrimp tempura because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it! 

Rock shrimp tempura was good, I can't lie. But it was also nothing special. Oh!! And something that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! It fell apart the second you touched it. :( 

So to sum up...

4443426,2008-04-25,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"This is a difficult review for me to write - I have regarded Nobu Matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in Japanese cuisine. Maybe time is passing by and his 'new style' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? 

I've had sushi at the London, Dallas, and NYC locations of Nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original Matsuhisa restaurant in LA. My visit to Nobu in Las Vegas did not seem to compare with the others. It was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. The service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. Perhaps the global expansion of Nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a Nobu menu in years. Sad.

Anyway, enough hatin'. I had a great creamy spicy crab (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of Nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. It was all good. But I'm not sure I'll seek out the LV branch of Nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in Vegas). 

Given Nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (Morimoto, Tyson Cole's Uchi), I can only give Nobu-LV 3 stars.",a7Gve8KjkWC_1vPIEtOAKw,2,1,3,CVL7sn24kNw09C9zuCLgRw

First off, the server was great. He did an excellent job explaining all the drinks, dishes, and dinner style to us, and he was a great sport joking around with us, as we were there for a bachelorette. We looked at the menu to decide if we wanted to order our own dishes or do their family style / chef-chosen dishes. He told us he could get us full / satisfied for ~$50-60, so we decided to go with their shared style dishes. 

About the family style: he asked a few questions about dishes we liked, our taste, and whether we liked fish / red meat, and they came out with a bunch of dishes for us to try. Overall, we had 6 dishes, and they were all really great.
1) Yellowtail jalapeno. We specifically asked for this dish, but it was already on their list for us. This dish was so delicious; the fish was so good and the flavor was amazing.
2) Salmon sashimi. This was very good too (but I did like the previous one more).
3) Popcorn shrimp. This dish was okay; some of the girls really liked it, and it was good, but it didn't stand out to me.
4) Yellowtail collar. One of the girls asked for this dish, and it was amazing. The meat was very tender and flavored very well.
5) Steak. We all got one piece of this steak, and it was very delicious. Extremely tender and so yummy.
6) Cod in lettuce wrap. The cod was so good, and I wish there were more in that little lettuce wrap.

Overall, we weren't stuffed, but satisfied. The food was all really great, and we all liked our drinks too. Try their special martinis! I had the elderflower and lychee and it was great.

Must haves (I don't know if it's always on the menu) are the black cod entree which tastes like nothing I've ever had before. Uni spoons, the fish carpaccio with the famous Yuzu vinaigrette and we had a matcha flavored cronut (tm) for dessert.

My menu recommendations -- ie get these three things or don't bother going at all -- are the Miso Eggplant, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and Cilantro in Yuzu Sauce, and the Thinly Sliced White Fish in Ponzu Sauce.  Though I have extensive experience with the NOBU menu, in my opinion these three dishes are the most outstanding options on the menu.  Now when I go to NOBU, I gorge myself by ordering multiples of just these three dishes.

I had high hopes for this place after dining at the one in Hawaii.  Total change of scenery here.  Very Loud and casual.

Had to knock off a star just for ambiance, & price (i dont mind paying high prices, but I expect a total experience for the price I pay)  

Had to knock off a star for the food.  The Black cod with Miso was good but my was a little slimy and quite a couple of bones I had to pick out. For the price and caliber Nobu touts to be there should be no bones.

We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including ""new-style sashimi."" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.

Then, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. 

When our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.

Too bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.",INrsIl9Mw6DDY4yaYRxDlg,0,0,3,b8wlo-ODZQN_JtSn12QB0Q
4694454,2013-01-28,5,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I'm shocked at the high reviews for this place. Did I have a one-off terrible experience? Went here in December with my father and husband for a celebratory dinner. Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later). 

Our 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.

The other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.

My husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.

Overall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special. I hope for the sake of other diners my experience is not typical, but it was enough to burn this frequent Vegas traveler. I will not be back.",T95SwoZvq0kzlj8Fhoh_Lw,12,1,2,fhMKyvLRvXcRtTtokysoRg

Las Vegas Nobu did not disappoint. 


The blue fin toro tartare with ossetra caviar ( my favorite caviar ) was SO bomb that I admit, I ordered it twice in the same meal. At 50 bucks a serving it wasn't cheap but it was so worth it for the amount of ossetra and toro in the dish. 

I also had two uni shooters, omg so good.

Monkfish pate with caviar--YUM!!! Would probably skip next time for more uni.

Nobu crispy rice with tuna ( at this point in the meal I secretly unbuttoned my pants, stealth mode). 

And of course the rock shrimp with jalepeno sauce.

Next we ( I was eating with one other person so you can't blame me for being a glutton), had the japanese wagyu tataki, which I have been craving since a recent trip to Japan. Melt-in-your-mouth good.

We both had the chef's daily omakase, which was outstanding, and finished with a light deconstructed cheesecake thing that I couldn't eat.

&& THEN  I didn't eat for a day.

SO GOOD, expensive, yes but you get what you pay for! No regrets.

Our group had 9 courses including mouthwatering sushi towards the end of the meal.  What I enjoyed the most was how frequently the food arrived at the table.  Literally, we would finish a dish and about 2 minutes later another would arrive.  It was amazingly choreographed and simply delightful.  Every bite was amazing.  

Keep in mind though, the price is significant for 4 people it ran me $800+ including tip and very little alcohol...  Some sake and a few beers were included.

Special mention should be given to the wagyu, which arrived raw with hot stones and salt on the side.  Dip the raw beef in salt, place on stone to cook for a second or two, and eat.

My cousin and I have heard so much about the place we HAD to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to Vegas.  Here is what we ordered

Yellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=DwKr-LhPVr9kFIVr4Q7PtQ: Very Delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. After the dinner when I asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. It is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. I think I've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but I think b/c its from Nobu it just makes it that much better. 

Sashimi Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=12QbNH80NCNJdBy_mZVnOg): The dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. It comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. I wish it had a couple of different types of Sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good. 

Scallops with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=NK22wem6XYcmO21jvgPJVQ): This was probably my favorite dish. The scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. I think the scallops were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. Whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.

Whole deep fried cod or snapper I don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=vefN4PoI2zsBDZNyHZaAXQ): This was another special. The waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. It came out and we were all in awe. It was pretty big. The table was in WOW when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. WOW, didn't realize that when we ordered it. I think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  Needless to say the fish was delicious! You can eat almost every single piece of it. The fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. The sauce was sweet with a little spicy. The sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. We picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish. 

Sushi and the Tempura Dinner: Nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. I don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. I would definitely skip both if you are coming here. Get these at some other restaurant. 

The service was good but not spectacular. They have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience.

Since then, I'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or Nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. Either way, it was still a great meal overall. 

Hubs and I made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas. We put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. Our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. Maybe he was having a rough night. Regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...

Jalapeño hamachi: 5/5: Bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. Exactly what I remember about Nobu! 

Ehu: 4/5: Per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail red snapper. I've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. Taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. 

Rock Shrimp: 3/5: Last time I was at Nobu, hubs and I ordered two servings of this. Not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. This go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. 

Black Cod: 3/5: Another dish that I used to love. This visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. 

Spicy Tuna Roll: 4/5: Standard spicy tuna. Fresh, delicious and on the mark. 

This visit was a good one but not a great one overall. I'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping I came on an off-ish night!",qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q,2,1,4,EYXbZyBBlGQyCUhmbwXaPg

Nobu isn't a Japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. They may have borrowed their name from New York, but that's about where the similarities end. 

Service was friendly, but brisk. They clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar. 

We ordered miso soup, the four kelp salad (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the Chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. The miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what I'm used to, but both were good. Kelp salad was a little too fishy for me, but then again, I had my heart set on seaweed salad. Both the Chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.

We showed up with 11 people for an 8 person reservation and were accommodated immediately.  Drinks were brought out fast, as were a fee of the appetizers.

Once we all ordered our dinners though, thinks went a little downhill.  I had two full plates of sushi in front of me for almost 10 minutes before anyone else got what they ordered.  The delivery of food was so sporadic, we basically just took turns watching each other eat.

-1 point for the most ""memorable"" part of the dinner; the cheap, takeout quality, give-your-tongue-splinters, chopsticks!  How do you cheap out on these disposable splinters of firewood?  Such a cheap item to upgrade, instead it totally ruined the dinner for the table...it was like going to a good steak house and being given a plastic knife to cut your filet.

Two at the table were somehow offered dessert while the rest of us never even saw the menu or heard the offerings, -1 again for lack of service.

I am not a huge sashimi fan and usually play it safe with the rolls but this restaurant is truly a divine pallet experience!!  We had the chef's recommendations as well as sweet shrimp and my husband likes Uni. I have tried Uni one time before at another sushi restaurant and I was totally repulsed by it. The server urged me to try it at this restaurant and it was amazing! Everything we had was absolutely perfect. Very flavorful and fresh! The only down fall was we could have eaten more!

4830661,2013-12-31,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"So, as many of these reviews state, ""Nobu is expensive."" Yes, but it is exactly what an expensive restaurant should be. High quality, professional service and top of the line food. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino in Vegas 3 times now and I find it excellent. 

My average bill per person has been about $150. This is including a $60 bottle of saki and a couple of $15 martini's. Without drinks, my wife and I probably would have spend about $100-$120 each. This is also without trying to go cheap. If you wanted to eat here on a budget, it would be completely possible to order a couple of $12-$15 Sushi rolls and a couple of $12-$15 skewers and get out of there with a tab that runs about $60 or $70. However, in my opinion that would be defeating the purpose because while you can budget yourself into turning this place into a typical sushi bar, the real goods and their signature dishes that separate them from the rest are the more expensive plates. 

Their main signature dish is their yellowtail- jalepeno sashimi. Definitely an appetizer portion, but very tasty if you like sashimi. My personal favorite is their blackened cod in a butter-lettuce wrap. The last time I was there it was not listed on the menu but when I mentioned it they knew exactly what I was talking about and whipped it up for us. Also an appetizer portion, but very different and very good. The fish literally melts in your mouth. Another recommendation is the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. It's sort of a beef filled pot-sticker that is cooked to perfection. The beef is imported either from Japan or from Australia, depending on which one you decide to go with, and comes with an incredible dipping sauce. A little more filling of an order as well. Their sushi rolls are good, but nothing you can't get at another place that makes good sushi. However, I recommend getting a couple rolls to get yourself filled up then get a couple of their specials in order to keep your cost reasonable. 

The service is great. Then waiters and waitresses have a good attitude and they know the menu like the back of their hand. If you just tell them what you're feeling they can put together a meal that works for you. There is someone coming by to fill up your water or bring you another drink every time you need it and they all have been well trained in how to communicate at a high end table. 

As much as I like to branch out and try new restaurants, this place is always going to be hard for me to pass up when I am in town.",K3GerpEel8xg6g6zh-b_lg,2,0,5,t-iXcXtT4E9-o_sNHaUtIA
4841435,2008-11-17,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"This was the first time ever I've dined with three other Yelpers so I'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. Personally, four stars is a little high but I really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so I'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (I don't think I've ever typed a longer word than ""unenthusiastically"").

The black cod with miso was the highlight. The Kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 I'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing I've ever eaten. The scallops topped with jalapeno were the third great dish. The sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.

The ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for Vegas. It looks the way a Japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. And the service, though efficient, was humorless. Any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based desserts off the menu is not winning any points with me.

Still, the price minus the Kobe was totally reasonable, especially for Vegas. And the Matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward adding up to a pretty good meal.",9Wrg-nTHQtM7KFn_legxow,2,2,4,gdSO-zQkK72RmMTiou8vfQ
4858077,2015-03-16,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"So, in Vegas, and looking for somewhere to eat that isn't named after a TV show chef?!? Or a place where the food is fresh and not all fried? This would be a great place to start- 

Had dinner here while in town for a conference at the beginning of the month with some business acquaintances from out of town- all three of us are pretty familiar with Vegas and what it has to offer- in multiple aspects ! We didn't have to wait- big plus! The server was super knowledgeable of the fish served - and of the menu including the pricing. 

The other two that I had the pleasure of dining with asked our server to recommend a few choices and he did- we all agreed to allow his expertise guide us in our meal. He ordered a few dishes - they were great - and then we requested just one more and he complied. The texture, flavor and presentation were amazing. I have had sushi all over the country and this will be rated in the top 5. The flavors made my palate go insane !! 5 stars on the food ! 

So, a total of 5 dishes for the bargain price of over $250 and that wasn't including a tip. Upon review of the receipt. One dish was charged three times for a mere $18/charge - I questioned the server who politely explained that he took the liberty of ordering three orders of so each of us at the table could have two pieces... I'm sure he did. The other three dishes were on average of $60 ish each- hmm.... One would have thought that he would have had the courtesy to pick a variety of dishes price point speaking - not the highest on the menu OR have the courtesy to ask if our group was on a budget or what our price point was verses assuming. Our tip alone paid for his internet bill for the month in addition to half of his cell phone bill. 

Out of courtesy- we all reached for our cards (me slightly cringing at what my accounting people were going to say when they saw this horrifically high dinner for three) and one of the other two decided they would take the heat on the cost... Not sure how he are going to explain that one. 

Moral of this story is- always order your own food in Vegas unless you have an unlimited budget! Thus the 4 star rating- minus one star for common courtesy and respecting the client/customer.",4iSlE7UibbevPCZnKHeXsA,2,0,4,hRq5hYd-EOdWrRzN0DWtyA

The kobe beef was amazing, but the price was a little outrageous.

Pros: Food was very high quality and the service was very fast. That's about it.

Cons: There were no frills. It was almost boring. Decor was nice, but it was just kind of boring. Mostly because the service was TOO fast. That may sound strange but they were at the table every 2 minutes with another dish or to ask us to order more. It just seemed very rushed. We tried to take our time and talk but we were done with our dinner in under an hour. That was the pace they set. Which is great for turning tables but it wasn't the most pleasant experience. The cost of many of the dishes were insanely over-priced.

Service: 2/5 we had never been here before and it wasn't explained to us why nobody was giving us a food menu. They gave us an alcohol menu only.

I just needed to tell him what I like. Ok... so I told him what I normally order at Japanese restaurants. He then gave me a menu and never returned to our table. 
FINALLY, another server came by and we told him that we were put-off by the previous server. This server was MUCH better, explains their cuisine, process, and answered questions. 
Ambiance: 2/5 it's crazy loud in here. They have music blasting and there was a big party nearby. Tables are close together and it's a fairly small establishment. Imagine a diner with mood lighting, the waiters wear black, and the price of tempura is $40. That's Nobu. 
Food: 2/5 blah at best. I've had better California rolls at Safeway. The vegetable tempura was bland. The $90 wine was just ok. The seafood wasn't fresh.

I went with the omakase, consisting of 8 dishes including dessert.  Some of the stand-outs included the Hamachi Tartare, the Barracuda Salad, and the dessert notably named ""Bento Box"".  

The Bento Box consisted of white chocolate sauce in a flourless chocolate cake, with green tea gelato and berries on the side.  A little excessive yes, but it was effective.  The first couple of rounds of the omakase were the cold dishes, which were acceptable, as I expected small portions of dishes to come out.  However, I was surprised (and almost annoyed with the second half of the omakase, which consisted of warm dishes that basically over-powering and excessive.  They could pretty much act as their own entree.

tl;dr  The cold dishes are tiny, the warm dishes are a whole lot.

4987813,2016-01-08,4,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu, a name that echos throughout las vegas when it comes to sushi. I have always heard rave reviews about and was excited to dine here.

Reservations were @ 8pm. The place was filled but was almost dead when it hit 9pmish. I don't think it's hard to dine here without reservation depending on time.

As a person who is a sushi addict, the sushi bar is where we preferred to sit. The chef was very accommodating and all smiles. All cold dish is ordered thru the chef, hot dishes are ordered with the waiter.

Rice: thicker grain compared to regular sushi rice w/ very very minimal vinegar.

Top Recommendations:
*Yellowtail with jalapeno! The mini jalapeno was not spicy, but gave a nice crunch with the yellowtail texture.

*Cod with miso! The miso is delicately sweet which enhances the melt in your mouth cod. The recommendation of this dish is not to be downplayed!

*Uni shooter WITH sake. It's a pretty large shot glass and worth it. I hate the taste of alcohol but even tho this shooter has sake, it was sweet.

*Barracuda with miso and vinaigrette  (off the menu). The chef was actually preparing this for another table when we asked what it was. And behold, he said it's not on the menu!! (This is why sitting at the bar is awesome!) Glad we tried this. The sweet miso flavor and tang really made this fish stand out.

Other nigiri tried: mackerel, kohada, uni (sea urchin), sweet ebi (shrimp), octopus, tuna, tamago (egg), toro. These were pretty good and some above average, but not enough for me to order again if I ever visit again (except maybe if they still have otoro).

Dessert: mochi ice cream. Kinda worth it if you're in the mood, but it tastes just like the mochi ice cream sold in supermarkets.

I was iffy between 3 or 4 stars. I'll be nice and keep it at 4 because service was nice. My gripe is the price!! Ugh almost paid just as much here vs a michelin star sushi restaurant in SF which was superb quality compared to Nobu. I felt ripped off when i found out their uni (sea urchin) came from Cali and not Japan. C'mon Nobu! It's not hard to get sushi from Japan, esp for the price you're charging. 

Verdict: eat here if you want above average sushi with creative dishes-- and just because you're in vegas!! But if you are a die hard sushi fan like I am, you know you can get better top knotch quality sushi at a way cheaper price.",GNd8F2nczSrsyj0P4uifyA,8,7,4,hALHirWO7DCJRShOzCid2g

I had the house roll (I don't remember if thats  the exact name) which had four or five different types of sushi.  The sushi was fresh, but I've definitely had better sushi.

Now before I utilize Yelp to complain about sub-par service I must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.

The Black Cod Miso was a life changer. You owe it to yourself to have this dish.
Also the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, I can't find words to do it justice.

Now as to why Nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. Our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. Why did you bring us (2) Rock Shrimp Tempura? It's delicious don't get me wrong, but two? 

Maybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those additional tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? I don't know. But when I'm spending $60-70 per person, I expect a little more.",55lpuhNQmcoy2QlFOqZzbw,1,0,3,ZiTWTmw0389T8bCJdJ3dhQ

We got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. Our Waiter Jeffrey was on point. Best service. He recommended we start with the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno. It was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. LOL. It was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. We also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. A lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but It was still good. We also had a sear salmon sashimi which I do not remember the name that was excellent. We got spicy edamame, Beef Kushiyaki, the Black Cod with Miso and the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The Cod was really good and highly recommended. The Wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. We literally could have kept ordering food. We had a couple of nice cocktails as well. 

After dinner they brought us out a plate with Happy Birthday with a choc cake and green icecream. We also ordered the Whiskey Moose. Both desserts were to die for and I was in Heaven.

I would recommend the Omosake menu.  Let the chefs give you the best things from the kitchen.  Just tell them what you can't have and then will make you a happy person. Our favorites our the black cod miso.  I saw someone say it was too sweet but I disagree.  it's perfect.  The yellowtail sashimi is my wifes favorite.  One of their options last fall was a shaved asparagus and crab salad.  I still have dreams about it.

5015510,2010-09-08,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I can't believe it took so long for a foodie like me to eat at Nobu!  
With plans to spend Labor Day in Vegas, I was thrilled with how easy it was to secure an 8pm reservation on the Saturday of a long weekend.  Economy or Vegas?  

Boyfriend is a Nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  Every single thing I put in my mouth was outstanding.
As noted by the legions of yelpers, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.  
Next out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  Similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile.
The third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  I was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because I love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  This dish induced giggles, it was so good (see Mastro's review for further discussion).  It also induced an epiphany: I dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but I LOVE fresh truffles.  They have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  I know, I know: TOTAL white people problem.  

Finally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  Fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  Lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the Japanese seven spice.  Our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  At $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.

We rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and I definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.

5021929,2008-01-17,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"The wife and I have eaten at lots of sushi restaurants, including Morimoto in NYC, and we had high expectations for this place. The service was good to great, but you would expect that from a restaurant of this price, but what's the deal with all the caucasian waiters who can't even pronounce omakase?! (For the record, it's oh-ma-ka-say, not oma-case)

The atmosphere was pretty lacking. It was dark, loud, and looked almost like someone sort of gave up on the decoration. It was just so-so nice and didn't really give off any particular vibe. And I've never been to any kind of restaurant other than a hole-in-the-wall where they give you the bill on a freaking round white plate. Then after you give them a credit card, they bring back the receipt and a pen. Yes, just the receipt and a pen. No plate, no folio, nothing. They just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen. Does that scream 4-star restaurant to you?

When trying out new sushi restaurants, we always like to order some of the basics, to get a foundation to compare against other places. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plates. Both had decent to very good fish (but not *great*) except for two big disappointments: the tuna was really mediocre, and hello! take it easy on the wasabi, chef! Sushi chefs that use too much wasabi are either trying to cover up not-so-fresh fish, or they're just not really good at making sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, so I don't think they were trying to cover anything up, which leaves......

Maybe we should've had lower expectations when we came in, or maybe Nobu is only good with the fancier dishes. But for the prices they charge for ""regular"" sushi and sashimi, it's just not worth it.

The service gets a 4. The decor/vibe gets a 2.5, and 
if the prices were maybe 30-40% lower, I could easily have given them 3 or maybe even 4 stars. But for what you get, I'd give them a 2.5. But since yelp doesn't let you give half stars, I'd round off this overpriced place to a 2.",iABZRbYx8EX6w7-yj1afyA,6,2,2,QxHoP4tOR902c8iJFX-tnQ
5022879,2011-05-18,4,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"BLUF...The dining highlight of my trip to Vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at Nobu.  This was my third trip to Nobu, each time having had the Chef's Omakase Tasting Menu.  Nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  Since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the Chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  We both received 9 courses with sake pairing. 

First course:  We started with a Kumamoto Oyster wrapped in smoked salmon topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus ""boat"" with accompanied by sweet and sour miso sauces.  A masterful start!  The 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! 

Second course:  Shima-aji Sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gelée with micro celery and ""sea grapes"" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  A great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!

Third course:  Bluefin Tuna Sashimi topped with garlic purée and sliced serrano chilies with jalapeño emulsion over brown rice salsa.  I love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  The brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!

Fourth course:  Ocean Trout and Seared Sweet Shrimp Sashimi salad served with mâche, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing.   Another success!  The peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.

Intermezzo:  A Yuzu Sorbet...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.

Fifth course:  Pan-seared Seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a yuzu soy sauce.  As much as I loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!

Sixth course:  Grilled Wagyu Beef with Seared Foie Gras served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction.  The oh-so-tender Australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared foie gras.  

Seventh course:  Dashi with Lobster and Enoki Mushroom with Japanese greens.  So simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  They didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  In many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.

Eighth course:  A selection of sushi...Otoro (fatty tuna), Tasmanian Sea Trout, Sea Eel, a fish I can't recall, Mirugai (geoduck), and Tamago (egg omelet).  I love sushi.  I LOVED all of these nigiri!

Ninth course:  Shiso (?) Panna Cotta with Strawberry ""Caviar"", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  The ""caviar"" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.

As for our sake, Chris (I think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that Nobu imports its sake from Japan and that it's made especially for Nobu.  I'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  Suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  Chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  We had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  The timing was impeccable!

I'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals I've ever had...at least since I've started yelping!  Each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  It takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if I had to pick one, it was the wagyu and foie gras course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  If you're in Vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to Nobu and have the Omakase Tasting Menu!

5062070,2012-04-06,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"I was skeptical, but Nobu delivered. I just finished dinner with a friend of mine and I had to write a review before I forgot the details. Let's just get to the chase.

My friend and I walked in and I asked our server what the best three dishes were. He then recommend these three. I felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. But I often do this for restaurants that I've never been to. After dinner, I find myself recommending the same. Here's the pro and cons:

1) Toro Carpaccio- Okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, I had to know what it was about. Now I know and here's the scoop. The toro is incredibly delicious. It is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro I've ever had. The fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. Capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil and soy dressing over greens really hit the mark. I will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (That's right, I'm Chinese and I'm saying it). I would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.

2)Yellowtail Jalapeno- This was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. The Yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. The jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. I would actually recommend this as a first dish. 

3) Black Cod Miso- I thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. Cooked to near perfection, the Cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. The miso glaze wasn't much to look at. For me, it resembled gravy. I've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. Nevertheless, the dish was great. I actually prefer Black Cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. Sweet Miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. 

4)Sea Urchin sashimi or sushi!!! Just order it. 

My friend and I were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but I must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. Overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. Here's the list:

-Salmon skin hand roll- thin slices of salmon skin with gobo, rice and seasoning. Nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the salmon skin.

-Baracuda Dry Miso- $40 for six slices of barracuda. Very interesting texture as I haven't had barracuda before. The lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. Again, I see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so I simply eat and keep my comments to myself. 

Live Scallop- again, great cut of scallops, but nothing special to write home about. It was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. 

New Style Oyster- Four pieces of Kumamoto Oysters served ready to enjoy. So you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.

Crispy rice w/ Big Eye Tuna- For lack of a better term, it's Japanese tatter tots. Square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. Well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. 

All in all, it was a great experience. My general assessment is that Nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. Not exactly my cup of tea. Maybe I'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. However, I can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. So I eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. Hope this helps.",mFyhkvcn2Lhs3V4yCDqUDw,4,1,4,cVANfWhoVhVRbE5voy3P9Q

The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light.

Again, if dining as a couple, expect to be at least  $200 poorer when you leave this joint, but your tummy will thank you :)",WD9Qzbtt8k1n32p9PcrzBg,0,0,5,d66YCS6cmPxlByWRnhtyTg

Okay, I'm a self admitted sushi snob.  I can't help it.  No matter where I go it always comes back to Nobu--Bahamas, New York, Malibu, Las Vegas...  Every single location I've been to has provided a first-class sushi experience.

The Las Vegas folks were especially nice - particularly since I was playing those Wheel of Fortune machines again and much to my husband's dismay we missed our reservation and they gave our table away.  As soon as we arrived, they moved us to the top of the list for the sushi bar - on one of their busiest nights.  Thank you Nobu Las Vegas team.

PROS:
- Incredible selection of sushi, dinners, etc.
- A great place to meet up at the sushi bar or to have the full first class dinner experience
- The best fresh fish, most unique combinations (my fav - yellow tail sashimi with japlapeno...  yum, I have dreams about this)

CONS:
- Pricey
- Maybe a bit pretentious (according to my husband), but I disagree",3fsgq1AlECv9YneXv8Z-Pg,0,0,5,9ZEtJeB-9Vrx9EqpHtuZ5A
5083638,2018-04-06,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Amazing sushi. Sure for three people it was $300 dollars including tip but my son swears he's never had anything better. The drinks are top of the line and very reasonably priced. Mention a birthday and they bring out a nice little cake for the celebrant 

They are not open for lunch and I recommend dinner reservations on weekends but midweek you probably won't have a long wait. I made reservations to be safe but they didn't look crowded enough for them to be warranted. 
(I'm in a back brace so even a short wait feels like an eternity to me now.)

If you're adventurous I'd suggest letting them design your meal. My son chose this option and was not disappointed. My pictures are of his plates. The miso was the best I've ever tasted. Granted it's hard to mess up broth but whatever they put in it made it significantly above par. 

It's one of those places where you can't just read the menu rather you have to ""discuss it."" I feel terrible that I cannot remember our servers name but he was great. If management reads this and would like to figure out who it was they can ask the staff which young man had this conversation on March 26th around 730p....

Server: I'm very gullible. 
Me: Did you know that's not in the dictionary. 
Server: What's not?
Me: Gullible, it's not in the dictionary. 
Server: WOW I'm always learning something new. 
Pause for dramatic effect while he realizes. 
My mother: She's teasing you, of course it's in the dictionary. 
Server: See, I told you I was gullible. 

This down to earth interaction was the best part of our visit to Vegas that didn't involve murder or magic. (CSI Experience and Masters of Illusion).

Also, if they still can't remember us mention the lady with the cool walker that folds in half because they stored it for us while we ate. I made a joke that they were holding me hostage until our bill was paid because I couldn't get away without my walker. 

My comparison is based off of many dinners at high end places like Top of the Hub in Boston and Gordon Ramsey's London to give you an idea of my base line for excellent food. You will drop a pretty penny if you go all out here but this is one place that is well worth it. We visit Vegas annually, usually hitting new places each year but Nobu and HRH are definitely worth coming back to.

I particularly recommend the tuna and jalapeno sashimi (and I don't normally eat raw fish, but I wasn't going to pass it up this time) and the cod that comes on a lettuce leaf with a little shredded, toasted phyllo on top. 

Our waiter was patient with us, and helped us decide even though we were a bit clueless. The service is fast once you make up your mind about what to eat; and we ordered in waves, which the kitchen was fine with. 

The only reason this wasn't a 5-star experience is that the room is small, crowded, dark, and noisy. We were literally reading the menus with the lights from our cellphones. The price of everything probably also weighs into my decision not to give the place 5 stars. For five of us to eat enough not to be starving but not to be totally full either was more than $300, and that includes one drink apiece.",T8mpq1i3uoPUty5yOz8m4Q,0,0,4,CDxZ2kVPcX-it2c5KqEeMg

As with its LA and Honolulu counter parts, Nobu Las Vegas uses only the freshest ingredients.  As with all other locations, the nigiri sushi is very skillfully prepared but as with all other locations, why fill up on simple sushi when there are so many great, mouthwatering, fusion dishes to try.

On recent visits, the king crab and avocado ceviche was excellent and so was the lobster and fresh shitake salad.  The broiled yellowtail collar is a must try.  Perfectly cooked.  The sweetness of the fish just explodes in your mouth.  Although its not sustainable seafood, the Chilean sea bass with dried miso.... ahhhhh heaven.  Finally, you cannot go wrong with the king crab tempura.

Prices are in line with restaurants of this caliber.  Special note, if you are from Hawaii, you will find the prices at this location 30-50 percent higher than in Honolulu for similar dishes.

Service is excellent.

The wine list is OK and in line with Vegas pricing.   As with all Nobu restaurants, I prefer to drink extra vodka or gin martinis with their food.  It pairs well and cleans the palate between bites and courses.

First, the taste and quality: Nobu chef imbue their creations with a South American touch, using unique spices and pairings. I would consider it Japanese-South American creative tapas. Delicious and intriguing creations which had me closing my eyes and savoring the novel tastes. I hoped to prolong the moment as long as possible before the inevitable gulp and swallow. The meal felt like a 10 act performance, although I was a bit disappointed that the first half completely outshined the closing half.

Service: waitstaff was like a ninja, darting from the shadows behind me to assist at every opportune moment (in the first half of the performance). Halfway through, the chef no longer personally created my dishes and they arrived straight from the baxk of the kitchen. At this point, waitstaff became slightly disinterested and less ninjalike.

Ambiance: modern, dimly lit, but nothing extraordinary. It could pass for any old sushi joint in the bay area, CA.

Value: at $250, sooo not worth it. I think I have had superior omakase from small lesserknown restaurants in the OC for 1/4 the price. Omakase in Tsukiji Japan is superior in quality and freshness for 1/4 the price, too. Omakase from the world-famous Jiro in Tokyo is about $200 more, but worth it for bragging rights and last meal on earth status.

Verdict: unless you are very bored, skip this place, save your money and spend it where it will go a heckuv a lot further. I am curious about the Nobu hotel at Caesars, though...",_OxJWBGahpuliC4HlzXlSQ,0,0,3,FLsnJof1VMTbZkZ0_2K83Q

I really wanted to go to the Ceasar's Palace one, as it seems to be the more popular one, but they didn't have any open reservations. It really wasn't too busy, but we sat at the bar. The bar tender was really helpful and talked me through a lot of the menu items. 

I started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. Perfect start to the meal! The fish was so fresh. Next I had the Lobster ceviche. It's served on a bed of lettuce. I was debating between that or the crab and the bar tender really pushed the lobster, but it was just ok to me. I feel like there was almost too much going on. My friend ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and I ended up eating a good amount of that. It's way better than my second dish.

I closed with a soft shell crab roll. The roll was delicious!!! However, I feel like next time, I might get it as a hand roll instead of a cut roll.

We initially came in wanting to get the omakase (nobu signature) but our server made a recommendation to pick our dishes based on what we like, what we don't like and our dietary restrictions. We opted for this option because it sounded like something that we would actually enjoy. (At this point, we haven't even received a menu to look at). This is probably where I went wrong and regretted not getting the nobu signature. 

The dishes didn't really feel like they were tailored towards what I liked/preferred. There was really nothing special with the recommended dishes because many others around received the exact same dishes/courses. 

There's usually seven courses, but we had to skip out on the last course and dessert. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But for the price point, I thought I would've enjoyed my food so much more. I just didn't really care for the crispy rice and the rock shrimp tempura - it was just filler food.

The black cod with miso - 5/5 stars. Definitely a must-have if you're coming here for the first time.

The creamy spicy crab - 3/5 stars. It was very oily, salty, and didn't impress us. Felt like it should've been served with some kind of carb (maybe bread or rice or noodles).

The bento box - 4/5 stars. Ordinary dessert, nothing special and small portion size (the chocolate lava cake at Max Brenner is 100x better).


Now back to my bad service experience. First, Roye mistakenly gave me the alcoholic lychee martini, when I distinctly ordered the lychee/pomegranate juice. The difference: juice is $7 and the martini is $14. He was nice enough to change my drink without much hassles, however, when we received the bill after our meal, he forgot to take the martini off. I politely asked him to change it and he agreed, however, he disappeared - we were left sitting there wondering what happened to him, then finally we noticed him chatting w/the folks at a nearby table and didn't acknowledge me when I tried to get his attention regarding the bill. FINALLY after 20 minutes of waiting, I flagged down another waiter and he was able to get the revised bill to me in less than a minute!

Roye totally left us waiting - if he was super busy, he SHOULD have asked someone to fix our bill - no excuse, especially after spending ~$200 at this place. I don't think it's wrong to expect better service and treatment.

5195176,2016-12-28,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"First off...service is awesome!! That's the best thing about this place. The food is so medium. It's super Americanized Japanese food that has some modern cooking elements added to it, but nothing that elevates the food enough for the price. We went on a Travelzoo special deal, $95 for 7 courses for two people. If we had to spend the normal price, I would've been angry for sure. At least I get to cross this off of my restaurant bucket list. 

The courses...
- Edamame: regular cold edamame with chunky kosher salt. Nothing special! I make yuzu citrus salt edamame that would give this place a run for it's money. 
- Salmon carpaccio and vegetable spring rolls: the salmon is covered in some mustard sauce that takes away from the salmon taste, and frankly, the salmon quality is not that great. It's the same quality as any run of the mill sushi joint that serves American rolls in OC. The vegetable spring roll in the center was kinda nice for the freshness and crunchy aspects. 
- Sushi course: comes with a caterpillar roll and 3 fish types of sushi. C'MON!!! A CATERPILLAR ROLL? You can't even tell it's a caterpillar roll because the eel taste is too absent. Tastes like a rice roll covered in eel sauce. The quality of the fish for the Nigiris was again not as fresh as I would expect for this caliber of a restaurant. I don't know who picks the fish or the fish monger, but they need to do better. I forget the 3 types of fish now, but one did come with a perilla leaf nestled between the rice and fish. I liked that element added, the fish itself was covered in a citrus and salt, which is my favorite flavor profile for sushi. The others were covered in a sweet soy or something. I can't remember very well, because it was all very unmemorable. 
- Miso black cod: the quality of the fish is spectacular in some parts and super dried in others. This fish dish is good, but I would say a bit too overly sweet. This was my fav dish of all the courses, but it's not enough to make me wanna come back ever. This dish wasn't executed 100% perfectly. 
- Ribeye course: the meat is cooked to a super tender texture since it's braised for a while, but the sauce it's braised in is again sweet. There was a weird lemongrass taste somewhere in the dish that didn't belong. The heart of palm done two ways - pureed and fried - both did nothing for me. The fried ones tasted just like oil and no distinct flavor. The puree was mush and added no value to the dish either. I guess it's a rice substitute, but it's a poor sub for it. 
- Mushroom soup: tastes like mushroom water with smoke added. The mushrooms in it are the stem of king oyster mushroom, maitake mushroom which is also called hen-of-the-wood, and one shiitake. I recognize all the mushrooms immediately since I cook with all these myself often. I'm not sure how they get the smoke taste, I'm guessing they cold smoke the mushrooms before adding it to simmering water. Could use salt or dashi or something else to take it to the next level. 
- Dessert: 3 fried bland balls. The black sesame ice cream is good though! 

Don't waste your time, money, or stomach space for this place. Would've put one star except for the service that night was really nice. I think Nobu needs to let me cook him or take him around for some real Japanese dishes with soul.",CvzUNX0aUtHLN8WzMnoi7Q,0,0,2,nUbFD_n7b40ieMhgKyCuDQ

Then I moved to the Yellow Tail with jalapeño and I can tell you it was far and away the best sushi I have ever eaten. 
Last I had the Bento Box Dessert and it was just as excellent as my first two courses.

5231591,2010-05-12,7,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"So I've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. For those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best Japanese in Las Vegas. When I read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so I'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at Nobu 101:

First My DONT'S:
*Do NOT come here with a low budget in mind . You will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. I've come in here and tried to do it ""cheap"" and walked away angry and disappointed. Wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. 
*Do not order off the main menu . It's boring. The food isn't that great. Steak is blah. Tempura is blah. Seriously avoid avoid avoid.
*Don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! 
*Don't blindly get the chef's omakase. You'll likely end up disappointed.
*Don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. Order EXOTIC cool things you can't get at home.

Now for what to do!:
*Peruse the ""special"" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. Literally all my great meals here have been 100% OFF the main menu. The off the menu items are by far the best
*Be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. It will really blow you away. I've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. Tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! 

Lastly, I'll leave you with my favorites. Most are off the menu. Most are seasonal. Yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly I've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! 

Cold:
*Barracuda. OMG. Best sashimi I've had in my life. Who knew!
*Tazmanian Ocean Trout. My next favorite. Basically like a mild buttery salmon. 
*Japanese snapper with pineapples
*Kampachi. I do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalapeño way instead of the yellow tail. Once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! 

Hot:
*Black miso cod lettuce wraps... WITH FOIE GRAS. Insanely good.
*The huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. Definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. Get 1 of these if you have a huge group. It's big and heavy
*Quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)

Cliffsnotes: Avoid ordering from the main menu. It's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. Be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. Enjoy!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,11,7,5,OAINF0LLoZe2VSTmzddk0g

I made the reservation before arriving to ensure a table and time. I am looking at the menu and trying to make sense of it, and the waiter walks up, ""We want to ensure your experience at Nobu is a food adventure and we are able to create a custom menu for you if you give me a price point"".... *speechless* and then gave him a number, ordered my Yamazaki (Japanese whiskey) cocktail and sat back.

The FOOD ADVENTURE was absolutely delicious.  I cannot even name everything because I am pretty sure they were not all on the menu, but i took some pictures of stuff.  Some of the stuff was:

+Tofu and tuna tartare on a crisp cracker
+Hearts of palm with jalapeno soy and mirin sauce
+Palate cleaner which was a spoon with a grapefruit granita, lemon sorbet and fresh blueberry
+Hot tofu in a spicy oil and asian broccoli
+Veggie sushi and California rolls

5310010,2016-12-15,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Excellent service.  Very attentive.  But I went for the sushi.  The chef was friendly and tried hard.  But he wasn't totally responsible for the quality of the fish. I had a moderately sized dinner,  $75 including tip, and, seriously,  I have had far better sushi in Little Tokyo for half the price. 

The shoyu was unbelievably overpowering. The red snapper was not the highest quality,  served with no garnish or little brush of sauce, and almost tasteless. Unfortunate, as this is a favorite fish of mine.  

The sweet shrimp was just passable, but whatever they fried the head in was not.  What passed for a tempura batter was heavy and salty.  When dipped into the extremely salty shoyu you got a saline bomb. 

Their signature yellowtail and jalapeño was Ok, but certainly nothing you'd go out of your way to return for.

They do have an extensive sake and Japanese whisky menu,  and a couple of Japanese beers on draft. 

So,  go for the beer and edamame. Skip the radically overpriced sushi. If you need to spend some serious coin, scrape together $600 and go to Masa..",2eJybE7tj5BeDwuehB3kCQ,1,0,2,B1TOouUiSO4BNFMbDCQdog

Sashimi and Sashimi Salad:
The fish here is generously cut.  They're fresh and the sauces they come with accent the fish. 5/5

Shrimp with Spicy Garlic Sauce:
If you like garlic and a little bit of spiciness - this is the dish for you.  The garlic sauce was amazing. The dish comes with some mushrooms. 5/5

Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki:
Came in a sizzling plate. A piece of very tender and juicy steak with enoki mushrooms and asparagus. Simple but delightful dish. 5/5

Nobu's House Special:
Salmon, tuna, hamachi, avocado and crab meat  wrapped in nori and daikon, sprinkled with masago. Each of the 6 pieces are not-so-bite-sized. 4/5

Salmon Skin Handroll:
Salmon skin with just a very thin layer of salmon meat making each piece so crispy and delicious. That's all that matters in a salmon skin handroll. 5/5

Kulfi:
Chocolate pistachio frozen custard, Nobu cabernet cherries, candied pistachios, chocolate feulletine.  Great textures: crispy and creamy. 5/5

Bento Box:
Flourless chocolate cake, white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. I'm not sure why it's called a bento box since it definitely doesn't come in one. It was free and yummy. 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,1,1,5,zkGubesg2lwU3xhFKVxg8A

The food was at best, mediocre and the fish was nothing special...my local sushi joints in Brooklyn serve far fresher fare. The cod was not bad (I've had it before in NYC) but not up to par.

I saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. So did my boyfriend. We decided we had to make it to Nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.

I did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, I did. Ahhh, I love when upscale Japanese restaurants live up to the hype.

Yellowtail with jalapeño: Tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. Most perfect dish ever.

Beef tenderloin tabu yaki: Not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.

Spicy scallop roll: Fresh and tasty. The boyfriend was blown away by it, I thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. I think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.

Black cod with miso: Their signature dish. It's really hard to find fault with it. Tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. It should be heavy, but it's not. That's the miracle of Japanese cooking.

Spicy seafood soup: My favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. Oh, and as an added bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. I have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. Get it!

Now on to the Nobu Dessert Platter:

Bento Box: Flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. Like a Japanese molten cake. Did I mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? Well, it is. So get this. Just don't go all Matrix Reloaded in the restaurant.

Trio of mochi: Lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, and some flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour Japanese mountain peaches. Mmm...

Bananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: Original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). It's crispy, fried bananas. Need I say more?

Haromajis in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato purée: I totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, I have no menu to look at. Already tried googling and found nothing. Anyway, this was incredible. I hate sweet potato and I thought this was da bomb. Yeah, I'm channeling 2001 lingo.

Waiter service was good, nice and quick so two stars go here.

We got the black cod saikyo miso, salmon spinach, otoro handroll, oyster shots, otoro, signature hamachi kama with jalapeño. And to kick it off, we ended it with a Nobu shaved ice. Our waiter also gave us a complimentary birthday brownie w/ a candle and he also compted the Nobu Shaved Ice. By far, the best dessert I had at any restaurant was the Nobu Shaved ice. Definitely recommend. It's a watermelon type of dessert with a hint of honey dew and with that, you get a cereal like topping you can add!

Also, if nothing else, you must try the black cod miso. It has to be the best tasting fish I've ever had.  It was one of those entrees that leaving you yearning for more, and so of course we got more. Money well spent.

Just about every great chef/restaurateur in the US and some from elsewhere have set up shop in Las Vegas.  It is too cool, and is what is going to bring me back to Vegas before too long.  

Which brings me to Nobu, the worldwide chain of really great Japanese restaurants.    It was way too loud and way too crowded, but I had some of the most amazing food there Friday night.

For Valentine's Day we were deciding between Craftsteak at MGM or Nobu. We called both locations and both said the earliest open spot for us would be 10:30 pm. I asked both places to take my number down in case of cancellations, and Nobu did- for 8:30. Yes, it was ultra modern, and a bit too dimly lit, and we WERE sitting behind an obnoxiously loud newlewed couple (she was still in her white wedding dress, spilling drinks, and talking loudly to her neighbors!) there were no restrooms (had to leave the restaurant) but all in all- this was a five star meal (in blinging bright Vegas styled neon lights-flashing!!) if there ever was one. And I am changed, as a result of this.

We decided to throw caution (and ugly thoughts of the recession) out the window and opted for the 150/head omakase. I kid you not, better, smoother, fresher, more buttery, more beautifully presented than I've had in Japan! Now, I don't remember all the individual dishes but I recalled that we were transformed into two little kids in a candy store, sitting there smiling in awe at what just went into our mouths and rubbing our hands together in astonished anticipation of just WHAT could top what we had just tasted? On and on... the dishes came. Beautiful and perfect, each shining in it's own vibrant manner, beautifully crafted and thought-provoking. Perfectly portioned... perfectly perfect.  The yellowtail with a slim sliver of jalepeno was awesome- my bf's pick of the night. The chilean sea bass divine. The trout with that sweet citrus.. the hamachi w/garganzola and balsamic- so unreal. The fois gras was smoother than butter. Everything just melted.

Our waiter was unfriendly and his manner was short to the point of rudeness. One example: we ordered a sashimi dinner and instead of  indicating the various fish that the chef chose, he dumped the plate on our table and left immediately. I felt like I was being served by a brooding, bitter member of a failing rock band that had taken this job because he had to pay the bills. I would had some sympathy if the restaurant was busy, but half the tables were empty because our reservations were towards the end of the night. Maybe he was pissed because of that, but for $400, I'm inclined to not give a shit about that and want some proper service.

One thing that raised our eyebrows was the inclusion of the Australian Beef dish...only because when we got the itimised receipt it was by far the most expensive thing on there... and as a table of seven traveling Aussies it was odd paying that much for something so common to us back home. Note to myself to remember next time to ask at the start for them just to stick to the fish dishes as they are far superior to the beef in my opinion, and much better bang for your buck.

Don't think of Nobu as a typical Japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  Think of it as a clever Japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.

You have to remember that emotional strength is required when presented with a meal like this. Like any great art it'll reach in and pluck your heart strings when you least expect it. I nearly teared up at several dishes - the sashimi preparations are insane, the black cod lettuce wraps are amazing, scallops are incredible, and we were presented with the most savory high-end pork skewer I have ever tasted. There aren't enough superlatives in the English language to describe how this meal was; you really must go there to try it for yourself. 

I admit when I walked in the decor looked a little dated by current vegas standards (and has not changed in years.). The tables and chairs are pretty minimalist.

Drinks:
Jyunmai Sake - ""masu"" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink
YK 35 - ""masu"" size.  This was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.
Note: Masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  You finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.

Food:
Monkfish Liver - honestly, not my thing.  I tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  It had caviar on top which I ate.  But my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  He enjoyed having the dish to himself.
Tiradito, Nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  One of my faves but not for hubby
White fish New Style Sashimi - sashimi doused with soy sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. Also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. 
Sweet Shrimp New Style Sashimi - even better than the above.  YUM.  Hubby let me have most of this one and for that, I'm forever grateful.
Uni Tempura - this was the one thing I wanted to try the most.  The shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and I greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  More for me!  The accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.
Miso Black Cod - I didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The serving size was reasonable.  Four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  Very enjoyable.
Scallops with Wasabi Pepper Sauce - Again, a pretty good-sized serving. The sauce was phenomenal although I do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  I'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  

Dessert:
Caramel Chocolate Mouse - I thought this sounded rather ordinary until I looked at the ingredient list.  Globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped with shiso citrus granite, topped with caramel ""caviar""; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy Japanese rice.  BEST dish we had all night.  Loved it.  I could have had 3 more.

Service was great with several lapses here and there.  The busboys were impeccable.  Our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.

As a waiter, if another table that is not yours asks for something as simple as a menu, why don't you help out your fellow coworker and bring some over??

Close to 9:00pm now - food begins to come out...

Ceviche - way too fishy
Black cod with miso - Good, but I would rather it cut off a bit of the sweetness
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - délicieux
Edamame - the usual

Then 7 rolls came out - nothing special...was told ""This is all, did you want anything else?"" No.

Very dissatisfied to the point where there were still plenty of rolls left on the plate.  Finally, one of the guys remembered we ordered a Kobe Beef Teriyaki...It never came.  We notified two guys and finally when we wanted to pay for the bill and just go home. They brought it out.  

Sorry to say, a bit of my distaste came out.  It's my cousin/best friend's birthday dinner and it was a disaster.  We sent back the teriyaki and wanted to leave ASAP after the bill came.  

The 3rd star is for the waiter's apology and help with the bill.  It was nice that they made an effort after the shortcomings.  The place wasn't packed, maybe it was an off day.  

Hopefully, if I return, my next experience will be much better.",VWfo_HiNWYxejIBfvkFeqg,3,1,3,6WIwowHEnR9-LmHeT4Vzig

Well, what can I say?  I've wanted to go to Nobu for a really, really long time.  Being in Vegas for the weekend, I decided this would be the time to do it. 

We started with an assortment of sashimi.  Tuna, Mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  Then a large platter of raw Chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  A warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  MMMMMMM.
Next came tempura King Crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  It was amazing.  My husbands eyes rolled back into his head- I thought that he was having a seizure.  Then came the spicy tuna roll and eel and cucumber roll.  Both good.  But the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  And I mean in a bad way.  So I've never had uni.  I know that is super lame.  But I've been waiting until I was at a really good establishment because I wanted to be sure that I was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   My fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     EEEEEEWWWW.
So it came pureed and then wrapped and tempura 'd.  Wow.  Well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater I dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  Big mistake!  I take a bite.  The exterior is nice and crisp.  Within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  Maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.
-Abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.
Thank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the ""uni incident"".  Super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw Kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  So we got to cook our own slices of Kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  Can we say FUN?  I've always wanted to do that.
Dessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  I did like the Shiso sorbet though.

The reason why I have given Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that I had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is Vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  Even as I am writing this I cannot believe what I am about to say.  I am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  In this instance I was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  But for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  Ouch!  Gees- I have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  Am I just a cheap ol' broad?  Or have I gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  Something just felt really wrong about that.    I just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  But, then again, I guess that pretty much sums up Vegas.",2cIdR5891_TF9nEqQw-I-w,3,2,4,lzFUhUzPpYgVgzORyh26PA

5657395,2008-02-28,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Nobu is my favorite Japanese restaurant.  Ever.  So far I've been to three- this one, Nobu Malibu and Nobu 57 in NY.  Out of the three, I'd have to say NY was the best and this one the least-best.  I say ""least best"" because ""worst"" and Nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  You cant go wrong with Nobu- but I did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.

So, of course of course you have to get the Miso Cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. In addition to the cod, I also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the hearts of palm salad with ""jalapeno"" dressing and a miso soup.  If you've read my Nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini I had was perfect (which is why I had 3), so understandably I was excited to have it again.  However, the one I received at Nobu Vegas was waaaaay to strong, and I had to request additional lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  My other major gripe was the hearts of palm salad.  I specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same hearts of palm salad with jalapeno dressing they serve at Nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  WRONG.  That salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  It tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at Nobu 57.  And, they should call it ""blast of garlic dressing"" because after one bite I swear I smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  Oh, and not to mention the fact that it was TWENTY DOLLARS.  Um, yea...skip that one.  The miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.

So, even with my complaints I still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  Maybe not as good as Nobu 57, but still the best Japanese restaraunt in Vegas, definitely.",4k9-LoufKfGflVzQfmkrdw,4,2,4,MhlQie8iD2QKPMzSkEur0Q

Debated going here since we're vegans... thought I MIGHT have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. But then the night we stayed IN the Hard Rock Hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:

We stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. The hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... We told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'No Problem!! Come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'Well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'Let me check with the chef, I'll be right back.' 

Apparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!

Sat down and decided to order the omakase meal. Usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got EIGHT and TWO desserts (one each, two different desserts)... Can I say AMAZING?! The food that the kitchen came up with was AMAZING. We actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but TWO more came. By the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. But we ""managed"" :)

Food, service, everything was impeccable. Def would highly recommend a visit. Worth every penny!! Very impressed with what they came up with for us as well.",JW_742Kc_BeN-tvACR88ew,3,2,5,-39EhgOU69Xe_4KL55kSPA

5674038,2009-08-14,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Yikes, what happened?

Consistency isn't one of Nobu's strengths, apparently, which I believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  I ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which I do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.

The signature hamachi with jalapeno?  Devoid of all velvety tenderness.  The salmon sashimi?  Like chewing a rug.  The maguro nigiri?  Stringy and tough.

On top of it all, I ventured out and tried the hamachi kama.  Not bad, but terrible for $20.  In San Diego, you can get the same size hamachi kama with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  There is no excuse, honestly.  If you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  Half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.

Nobu isn't a complete loss, though.  Like I stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  It comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than I remembered it being last time.  We also tried the miso almond cake and edamame ice cream, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea ice cream that is the bento.  Never be tempted to order a different dessert here at Nobu.  Ever.

Same goes with the black cod.  Yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  It should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).

One item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  Perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but I could taste that warm sweet flavor that I know is associated with high quality freshness.  Gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  The set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  Still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!

I also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  Can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  Wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  I highly recommend that you get it served hot.

While I maintain an A-OK for Nobu, I doubt I'll be coming back.  There are other places to get better Japanese food--and for better prices.",3CVT71cTx_fLbLr9JFr-Cw,2,1,3,Gc2vdvsnLG4aO3ktJPKnzw

Hummm.....where do I start. This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...

Standard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.

Writing this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.  
Think we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall.
The second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity.
Soup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.

Not only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it.

After scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on Nobu. Sometimes I have to be in the mood for sushi, I don't always crave it like other people I know, so I was worrying about committing to a reservation. I was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (True story, I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the Flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for Manischewitz.)

OK - Back to the matter at hand: Nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all Japanese food all the time. Not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, BUT THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I DIE. We had a smattering of everything from each ""category"" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. 

We dined on:

-edamame
-miso soup
-tempura fried rock shrimp with some type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce
-yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (OUT OF THIS WORLD)
-red snapper with dry miso (also, amazing)
-salmon new style sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious
-soft shell crab roll
-spicy tuna roll (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)

The dessert was good but unremarkable. I'm more about the main event.

Cap that with some amazing gin cocktail that I now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals I have had in my little life thus far...

5786834,2014-08-19,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Went in with high expectations, but was deeply disappointed.

Let me preface this review by saying that we went in with a Groupon.  Yes, Nobu is offering a Groupon haha!  For $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi with jalapenos, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.  

OK, I get that we're Groupon customers, I understand sometimes we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my Groupon expectations.  First of all the portions were way too small.  There were only five thin slices of Hamachi to share between two people.  The rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  There was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  I would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.  

I also must say I'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  Nobu did not change my mind.  These are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  Perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  The rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in Chinese restaurants these days.  The cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.

5806897,2007-06-11,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"When Nobu opened in New York City, it created a sensation.  Reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional Japanese food was widely praised.  This led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; Nobu can be found all over the globe.

Meal #1: I found Las Vegas Nobu's sushi highly variable.  The overall quality was OK, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  Orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.


Meal #2:  Since my first meal, I went to Nobu in Miami Beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  I enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the Vegas location another shot.

The restaurant looks OK, but nothing great.  It's very noisy, in keeping with the Hard Rock atmosphere.  The crowd is mostly young, but I think anyone would feel comfortable here; I did.  Service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.

Now, on to the meal:

    * I chose Jyunmai Daiginjyo sake.  It wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.
    * Small Japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  Good.
    * Trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  All served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  Good.
    * Seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, with garlic chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  A good combination.  Very good.
    * Uni (sea urchin) and some white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  The uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  There was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  Very good.
    * O toro and a spring roll with Jalapeno sauce and radish.  The o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  Good to very good.
    * Palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.
    * Service lapse.  Up to this point, courses had been timed well.  At this point, I waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  This was a little annoying.
    * Grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  Very good.
    * Foie gras and Kobe beef.  A large hunk of foie gras; good flavor.  Kobe beef very good.  Overall, very good to excellent.
    * Service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by miso soup.  They reversed the order, and apologized later.  A minor matter.
    * Miso soup.  Better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  Very good.
    * Sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), shima aji (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  Very good.
    * Fruit papillote.  Like a crepe.  The raspberry seeds were very distracting.  Fair.
    * Honey ice cream.  Very strong honey flavor.  Strange, but I liked it.  Very good.

Overall, the meal was good, but not as good as Nobu in Miami, and not nearly as good as Okada.  At the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.


Meal #3: Based on past meals, I hadn't planned to return. However, I found myself at The Hard Rock Hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. I decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. This worked out better. My selections:

    * Ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Standard but still very good.
    * Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). This is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. It may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. I was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. If you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at Okada.
    * Live shrimp. These Santa Barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so I guess that means they're fresh. They were big and rather chewy; I'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. The heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.
    * Live octopus. I'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. Pretty good.

This was the most satisfying of my meals at Nobu. Nothing was stellar, but everything was good.



Nobu's strength is its new take on Japanese foods.  Its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in Las Vegas, and suspect service.  Given such high prices, I'd look elsewhere.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,3,0,3,XkkOA2WPI9O7e2_vtsOIuA

We ended up here when our Sushi-place-of-choice was no longer in business. We really didn't know what to expect, but this dining experience is very different from the ""norm"". There was no menu, so our ""waiter"" (seems like a very inadequate title for him) spent a few minutes asking probing questions about our food likes and dislikes at the table in order to build a customized food experience for us.
We were a little uneasy when he said, ""we're a bit different here, but trust me, we'll create a meal that will thoroughly please you"".   Well, he was entirely right.
Various Sashimi and other Oriental-style dishes were brought out one at a time, ""family style"" for us to enjoy.  The choices were spot on and the flavors were absolutely amazing.  Each plate seemed to raise the bar over the last dish.
Even though we were completely satisfied with everything they served to us, we never quite felt like we over ate.  
The meal was complimented by a more-than-adequate saki, wine, and beer menu, including a ""craft beer"" from Japan (who knew?).

Not only was the staff exceptional but the chef catered to my pregnant food restrictions and that really added to the wow factor. We started off with the Shishito peppers and our server explained that good luck falls upon the person who bites into a hot one as most of them are mild in comparison. That was when I knew that this dining experience was different. I dined with my mother in law and fiancé and this starter really opened up our conversation; we laughed and joked and felt lucky at the start of our meal and unlike most dinners, hunching over a plate and ignoring each other, we shared a plate and opened up. Next, we had the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and my fiancé described it as the best sashimi he has ever had, truly melt in your mouth. The chef also prepared bamboo shoots for me done in the style of a sashimi plate with excellent flavor and texture and made me feel included in the experience (my fiancé and mother in law ate some of my bamboo shoots too!) Then came the salmon sashimi for them and the fritters with wasabi aioli for me, presentation as beautiful as ever. The taste excelling on every level with crunchy and creamy to tender and rich. The hits kept coming with the mini tacos. These were not your average tacos! Filled with wagyu beef, lobster and king crab, each taco was a two bite masterpiece. A zest of lime over each taco added a bit of zest to the richness of flavor in an amazing way. The rock shrimp tempura came out and dazzled all 3 of us. The shrimp tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce complemented the tempura crunch so well, we considered it addictive. We enjoyed squid pasta and I had never had squid so delicate and delicious. We were taught the story behind this dish and the presentation was truly phenomenal. The beef tenderloin was probably one of my favorites. We each had our own, cooked to the appropriate temperature (a bit more medium well for me, still considering my pregnancy throughout the meal) and again, melt in your mouth flavor. We finished up with the black cod with miso which I can understand now is one of their most famous dishes as the fish was expertly prepared and the miso flavor complemented the richness so well. Lastly my fiancé and mother in law indulged in a full plate of sushi in many varieties and the chef sent out vegetable sushi for me so as to feel included again and it was absolutely delicious and thoughtful. Throughout the dinner we enjoyed education on the dishes and conversation amongst each other. It was an incredible experience that ended with the bento box dessert with a cantaloupe sorbet that my fiancé and I still rave about today. We can't wait to go back after I have the baby! Thank you so much, Nobu. Thank you, John Laverde for a fantastic dining experience, it was truly magical and unforgettable.",9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ,1,1,5,yeQq3vZ7fh2Dod2VukMk9A

My colleagues and I went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...

I will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)

The first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  The fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - I guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.

There was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  This was unique and the fish was melty

there was a miso soup type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this

kobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular

scallops in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there

kanpachi with ponzu sauce and jalapeno was good too but trendy

in the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark ""Nobu"" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  The fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and I really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note

and the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...

I probably will not go back to Nobu again unless it's free.  I was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.

We arrived at Nobu during a bustling dinner hour but were promptly seated at a table sans reservations, btw, Shirley was looking hot as was our server whom we advised to surprise us with the sushi and to keep it coming.

It's a 5 course meal where they start you off with appetizers, entrees , then dessert. The appetizers given to us (Edemame and peppers) were alright. Nothing special, as you can get them from any restaurant or store. However, what really impressed me greatly at Nobu was the Yellow Fin Tuna Sashimi! I love sashimi, and eat it all the time. However, after eating this, it simply couldn't compare to any sashimi I've had anywheres. The servers were kind enough to recommend us that we don't use Ginger and Wasabi, for this could ruin the taste that the chef wanted in the first palace. I was glad I didn't use ginger/wasabi for this sashimi, since it was simply so tasteful and great! Afterwards, they served us Black Cod and rock shrimp which were great, but nothing crazy. I was sort of disappointed in the last entree they served us, a plate of sushi. It was simply slices of Tuna and Salmon on balls of rice. Nothing special. They also served spicy tuna roll and California roll on the entree. These sushis were simple, nothing great or special. It seemed that Nobu really lacked in that dish. It was just.. Plain.

Our waiter even had the kitchen do a special birthday dessert with perfect hand written suprise message for her! Great service and great food!",Fm0aDXdgc6HCbAW4toPogQ,0,0,5,5paGQR6jaZEtpvWbs-xpqQ
5923867,2016-04-24,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,Seriously - best food I have EVER HAD - and I have had a LOT of great food. Every course was perfectly balanced and the overall combination was out of this world. Word of advice - if you are going to do it just go for the full Monty chefs tasting menu and don't look back. Leave yourself at least 2 hrs to savor all the flavors. We had to dash out before dessert to make our 9pm show. Still a meal I will rave about for a long time to come!,JZU0wlwOv23V0WXAWuHgaA,0,0,5,MFHrWNXBgRk6p0DEdunwDg
5924081,2015-05-10,1,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Based on its reputation, I had high hopes of a phenomenal dining experience.  What I received was mediocre-to-good food delivered through horrible service.  A genuinely disappointing dinner.

The dishes showcased an exotic selection of fish.  However, the portions were exeptionally small.  And while I truly appreciate the fine-dining approach of quality over quantity, I feel that I shouldn't leave a $200 omakase meal feeling genuinely hungry.  The dishes themselves ranged in quality, but nothing was truly memorable - a shame for a place as esteemed as Nobu.

Service-wise, my impression was that our waiter was anxious to get off work and we inconvenienced him by trying to enjoy our meal.  He waiter made a point of repeatedly recommending items that ""came to the table quickly"".  His disappointment was evident when we ordered the long omakase menu and he said ""are you sure - that meal typically takes 2-hours?"".  His poor attitude continued throughout the night as he tossed the dishes on the table without explanation, served our paired flights well after the dishes were presented, and cleared our plates before we had finished chewinng.",PYg9q8jKd2JNz1wTBcUjAQ,5,1,2,U7AbFYT24VuG5Pc6xrDckQ

We got the chef's special menu, which was a sampling of their most popular dishes, and it was well over $100 a head.  I had to stop at In-N-Out on the way home because I was still starving.  

None of the food was bad, it was just tiny and costs about 5 times what it should have.  

I take back my first sentence.  If you want to go somewhere to brag about, skip Nobu and head to Tao.  At least I was full after that over-priced meal.",4U6ERqlxOzo7AGCLHfymtQ,2,0,2,qOcFxpaJQ6B9yy_HaUwrDw
5939319,2013-10-09,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"Whatever god you believe in, thank them for the creation of Nobu, because dear lord it is by far and away The BEST SUSHI I've ever laid my taste buds on! It may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny! 

I would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the Spicy Scallop Roll. Now one of the cool things about Nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported Kobe/Wagyu beef dishes as well. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...I'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! My drink of choice was a very refreshing Pineapple Martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, I highly recommend it!

The atmosphere is what I would call ""high class-zen"" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! Vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in Sin City, do yourself a favor and rush on over to Nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!",6VqQXNF4bl3O7PJzAmPO9g,0,0,5,99Rg1X9slaBpldzm9125kQ
5947354,2016-07-28,0,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,"5 stars all-around for this awesome establishment. We had a Groupon, which we paid $100 bucks for the Signature Five-Course Tasting Menu for Two People. Every single piece of fish was fresh and delicious. You could tell this wasn't your average sushi restaurant. 

1st course: tai sashimi dry miso (FAVORITE DISH!!!!)
2nd course: yellowtail jalapeño roll, two-piece salmon with wasabi salsa sushi, two-piece scallop tiradito sushi, and two-piece tuna sushi
3rd course: rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce
4th course: black cod with miso 
5th course: dessert (chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and mixed berries)

I have zero to no complaints about the courses offered. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the quality sushi at this place. This is a fancy restaurant, so the portions were expected to be small. If you walk in expecting huge servings, you definitely picked the wrong restaurant, lol.

We went on a weeknight with a reservation, so service was super quick and attentive. I ordered the Peruvian Caipirinha cocktail too, which had an awesome kick with the ginger beer.

Overall, this was a steal of a deal. We paid an additional $20 bucks + 20% tip (~$20) for the course. All in all, we paid about $140 for a delicious five-course tasting menu. The service was also great. We were treated really well even with our Groupon and was checked upon multiple times throughout the night. I was really impressed and left feeling satisfied with the entire experience. I'd highly reccomend this place for any date night!",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,4,2,5,_nIgRgiIOaEOXxD_6Z5wBQ

Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck.",dX9nbKetvW1nprtH1ih_rg,0,0,2,aaMZyTyJwUe1AL8hfD3D9w
