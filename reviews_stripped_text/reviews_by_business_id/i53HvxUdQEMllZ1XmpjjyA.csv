Pros: two italian guys cooking, prices good, food generally good

Cons: Bought the groupon, but only had online to go off of to order, online site messed up and prices/offerings are very different than the actual menu. Example: quoted $14 for a large pizza, but found out I could have got one for $7 if I had an actual menu. Prices online are more expensive than the actual cost. Pricing very sketchy.  Mushrooms on pizza clearly from a can??? Not sure.  

Overall, not bad, but not good.  Especially given the 500 other pizza places to eat at in the city.",8tAEDBGPDI7boehWrTngiw,0,0,3,mvkZCKygbEJu8mWqoYdJhQ

Their website doesn't work. They offer ""%20 off for ordering online"" and then when you get to checkout you can't chose their location.

Also, they've managed to MISSPELL the web address on their huge banner hanging outside the store, sending readers to a non existent site -- (this is only the beginning)

So I called the number instead and asked how much a large pizza was, I heard fumbling and then was put on hold for about 90 seconds before I received an answer. Do they not get a lot of LARGE PIZZAS ordered out of the establishment?

Without wanting to wait for another answer I just ordered the XL and was given a price. Upon arrival I handed the man a coupon, knowing full well the bewildered expression and extended fumblings this was going to result in, but that wasn't the worst part.

Also knowing that the business takes credit cards I took out my card and asked if the man would take it... ""I don't know how to work the machine.""

long pause

""You no have cash?""

After borrowing the money I ate the pizza, which was fine. If you go with their cheap specials and pay cash, you'll do well, ""make it easy for them."" You can get an inexpensive pizza at this place that's decent but due to truly absolute incompetence, get ready to work for it.",dR37LYi4joqhuRZBVNpJyw,1,0,2,-CkoxwjioIZXoclfuwMGcQ

203342,2016-09-28,1,i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA,"Avoid!! I ignored the reviews and ordered anyway off of the Eat24 app mostly because it's was after 1am and was only one of very few open places that delivered. 
We ordered: bread sticks plus mozzarella, Athenian  (Greek) fries, a turkey sub sandwich, and chicken tenders. We received our order in a moderately acceptable time frame. I say moderately because we would have our food around 15 min earlier had our delivery driver actually brought the food to our door or understood our directions to get to our place from the front gate. Instead, we had to leave in our pj's and meet him to get our food. We order delivery often and have never had anyone unable to find our door before. 

Now to the biggest issue- the food. 

YUCK! The fries were soggy with burnt edges and sprinkled with feta cheese. That's it. No flavor and terrible texture. The chicken tenders were baked, bland, and not crispy. The breadsticks were sadly the best of everything and that's not saying much; incredibly greasy and hard. The turkey sandwich was in fact a calzone with ham in it! After all of that we called for a refund or at least to get the sandwich we ordered. 

We spoke to one person and explained the issue twice, we were put on hold and a different person answered. We explained the situation for a third time and he asked ""so what's the problem?"" Really? We explained we ordered through the app and he asked what we wanted. We wanted the sandwich! He tried to tell us the calzone IS IN FACT the sandwich and that's how they make it. So you make turkey sandwiches as ham calzones?? We had to stress several times this was no sandwich and in fact ham. He wanted to send the same driver (that we had to meet) to pick it up since apparently they have to bring it back for the owner to see the next day in order to do anything for us. We requested our money back instead since none of the food was satifisfactory and apparently just giving us a sandwich was too difficult. He explained in a tired tone that he would have to call the Eat24 service team to refund us and that it would take a while blah blah blah. It was obvious this guy was unwilling to help us or try to make it better since apparently it was all too much hassle for him, so we gave up and threw all the food away.  

If you can't be bothered to do something minimal like give a customer a freaking sandwich they paid for when they weren't even making a big deal out of the other awful food, you don't deserve to be in business or to get any of money ever again. Listen to the reviews and don't order here!!",gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,5,0,1,IpGGd-UU99m9TcLHjdw3CQ
208520,2014-03-08,0,i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA,"Truly one of the most amazing pizza places in the city, especially for the price. But I would honestly pay double for the quality they provide. Their consistency keeps me coming back. I LOVE that they are open 24 hours, which fits with my crazy schedule, and they're nowhere near the strip where most great 24 hour places are! 

The serve pizza, sandwiches, calzones, Italian desserts, etc. Pretty much the expected items at a pizza place. When you call, you do not reach the store but a call-center, that takes your order and forwards it to the store. I have had a couple experiences with a rude girl/woman on the other end while ordering, but this is the only mishap.

The pizza itself is always perfectly cooked, top and bottom, with a level of freshness that you can taste in the dough, sauce, and toppings. They even have a medium 1-topping for $5.00 carryout. Their specialty pizzas may seem expensive (one X-large is 15.99) but being creative with the deals (two X-large any way you want them) let me get two X-large specialty pizzas for $20 plus tax, making each $10.

There are only a couple chairs to wait for pizza, so don't plan a date at this place. There is nowhere to eat. Simply great pizza for carry out or delivery 24 hours.

This place needs to be reported to the better business bureau.
I ordered through Grubhub and was told that my estimated wait would be two hours. I wasn't willing to wait that long for something that was only 2 miles away.
I called to cancel and the first employee said they didn't have my order.
He transferred me to the ""manager"" and she hung up on me.
I called back and the ""manager"" a lady, I told her that I need to cancel my order as I would not wait two hours for my order. She asked my address and then said it was already delivered. I told her that was impossible as I only ordered it literally 2 minutes ago. She kept asking why I would want to cancel if it was already on its way. I repeated myself, I asked her to check again, gave her my information again. Then she proclaimed that I told her the wrong address. And I responded with ""of course I didn't give you the wrong address, it is my address I know it."" She insisted I was wrong (so much for the customer is always right). She again kept asking why I was canceling, I repeated myself and then she told me to call Grubhub.
I called Grubhub.
A few minutes later the ""owner"" called me and asked why I canceled. I told him 1. The wait time. 2. The manager I spoke to was very rude.
He harassed me with repeated questions on why I would cancel. Then said that he was an online store. Then said he was the owner of the restaurant. He was very confusing.
I told him this was all too much to have food delivered, I thanked him. And again he just kept asking why I would cancel.

My sister called back to complain and get her money back and the lady said she would send the delivery guy back to return the money but they would need to take back.  Like are you fucking serious!?!  I kid you not, and hour and a half later the driver comes back with our money and to shamelessly take the food back.  This place deserves NO STARS!!!

Calzone - canned mushrooms??? That is never okay!

We order from them at least twice a week - kids, post-soccer game gatherings, fund raisers, office staff catering.. they will make sure the order is correct, hot, delicious, and delivered fast. they are open 24/7. it is owned by Mr. Alban and his family of experienced pizza aficionados. the 2 chefs really know how to bring out that rich, mouth watering Italian flavor in all the dishes. our favorite is daytime Masterchef Mr. Joey. He is 100% Italian and speaks fluent French.He perfected his cooking techniques from a long line of chefs in his native country. He grew tired of being overworked and under paid at other restaurants and settled down at Sicily's because he feels a kinship to the locals. He has a real passion for food and aims to serve up only the best. The families across the street at the park can smell the rich aromas of made-to-order pizza and chicken wings. The meat is soft, juicy, and tender. It is Divine!  I have read other Yelpers reviews regarding unsatisfactory experiences. I urge you to read the online menu carefully so you know what the order will include. if you are calling in an order after midnight, be patient; staffers are humans too- they are exhausted after a long night. lastly, kindly understand that delivering hot foods at 1-4am to hard-to-find locations is tough; be more specific in giving helpful directions by adding in the online 'comment' or call the store yourself. WE have all worked in service industry at one time in our lives; it is not easy..

Got excited about a 24/7 pizza place that delivers and ordered without thinking about checking reviews. We ordered a two medium special for 14.99, bill was 20 and change with delivery not including tip.

We ordered a four topping pizza and a specialty pizza with two items removed and one added.  Pizza arrived quickly, but when we opened the boxes one pizza was correct and the other was a plain cheese pizza.  Called the driver back (had the number from him calling about the gate code), he said the order was for a cheese pizza and the four topping, so not like he switched boxes and the order could be quickly corrected. We settled for what we got.

The pizza quality was terrible. I was starved going in and could only eat a little before giving up. The toppings were ok, but very scarce, sauce tasted like canned tomato paste.  The worst part was the crust, which might be the worst crust I've had on a pizza; it was thick, hard, and similar to cardboard.

There was a consensus on the time it took to deliver the food which was exceedingly long. I called back and the woman stated the food was on its way. I also read the food was lousy and seemed as if it had been reheated. Here is my opinion:

Delivery time was terrible. I was told 45 mins to an hour and it took 1.5 hours. I was not compensated for this extended delivery time. As I read in other reviews, I don't believe it was the drivers fault so I still gave him a tip. 

Food quality, contrary to the majority of other reviews was good. I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich, fettuccine Alfredo, side salad, fries, and the cinnamon sticks. My sandwich came in the form of a calzone and was tasty. It was warm when it arrived. The fries, like other reviewers have stated, were warm but soggy. They were the steak fry type and sometimes those are soggy no matter what. The side salad was great and I was told by my wife the ranch dressing was very good and not too bitter. The cinnamon sticks I have to say we're extremely good.  They gave me a strawberry jam type of topping to put on the sticks and it was excellent. 

Overall I gave this place 3 stars. The delivery service I received is the main reason I gave it an average review. I ordered from this place because they placed a flyer in my hotel door. In the future I will check reviews before I blindly order from a flyer, but if you are aware of the extended delivery time, it's worth a try.",SLD0GGPL82lNI_YVilBUYw,1,0,3,aB2e70azsEi3QRDhVvI6ow

I ordered my usuals but one with stuffed crust (no extra charge because of the coupon) & one regular. If I had to choose only one word to describe the pizzas, it would be: alright. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese but it was the type that's all in one piece so it's prone to doing the pizza landslide where everything falls off in one bite. 

The toppings were quality, and as Susan I. said, the ham is savory and delicious, unfortunately, the crusts didn't match up. I'm a sucker for stuffed crust from Pizza Hut where it has cheese oozing out and you can't see the other end, but this one clearly had a disappointing light at the end of it's tunnel. This crust also seemed to be thinner on the rest of the pizza so it got soggy before I even took my first bite. On the original crust, the center of the pizza was good but the crust was almost like a pizza from the freezer aisle. 

The people who worked there were really welcoming and their promotions are a great bargain if you're just looking for something to fill you up.

The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries.

She continued to argue with us and... The breadsticks were never brought. How disappointing in their service considering they said if their services weren't up to par, we should let them know within 24 hours and they will get us a full refund or a new order. We received neither.

I should have known, but I was drawn by what I thought was an awesome coupon deal. You know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? That's not the case here. It reeked of onions.

The pizza was undercooked and bare. I had the Supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. Also, I never thought anyone could screw up Buffalo wings. It's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. The wings looked unsauced and when I asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. After a closer inspection I understood, and it was right then and there that I realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. Besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. The wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. That was most likely the case. I tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

I am hoping I can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. I wish I could get a refund, but I don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one.

After acknowledging this wasnt getting us anywhere & letting it go of course they realized fault was THEIRS they left a VM saying the delivery guy will be on the elevator in 5mins and we should go meet him...

We drive by this place every day when we head to Dunkin Donuts.  We live close by Spring Mountain Rd and Grand Canyon Dr, so I've wanted to give their pizza a review.

My boyfriend was getting out of work and wanted to try something nearby.  He stopped in and ordered a carry out special $7.99.  The crust was cooked, perfectly crispy, ingredients were good but not as greasy as I'd like ( New York style). This is definitely a European style pizza baked with love. There's a slight taste of yeast which I liked. Very flavorful pizza and would probably return again when we need a late night carry out.

I was disappointed with the weird lingering aftertaste the Ricotta cheese had in the Tiramisu. Also used to Tiramisu having more soaked rum in the lady's fingers (cookie). I'm a really tough customer since I grew up eating Italian food my whole life. My boyfriend chose a Cheesecake and I did sneak a smell inside the take-out box, I think I'd go with that next time.

Overall my boyfriend said he liked the service and the gentlemen working was a good guy so he tipped him.  Excellent late night, cheap eats, munchie pizza.  I would like to try the Garlic chicken pizza next time.  

SOME (not all) of the reviews should add pictures to prove how ""horrible"" it is.  How can readers tell it's bad when you don't show proof?",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,1,1,4,r2b3mXm2uzY4pWk_xfbwEQ

I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi. The food was at my door quicker than any delivery I've ever had!

I'm very picky about wings. Most places seem way under cooked for my taste. These wings were great. My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them. I'd probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off. But they were really tasty!

The pizza was great! So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order from.

Only negative thing I have to say is usually the girl who answers the phone isn't very friendly and sometimes acts like it's an inconvenience to her...only reason I didn't give them a five star,Y8Sl5rn2CFCI2KvGzCEWJw,0,0,4,k7wXeJBBAWXG4ncDS8f1Xg

The biggest pros for Sicily's is that it is 24 hours (I'm not 100% sure, they claim it, and I have ordered something 3am in the morning), they're a small business (yay), they deliver, and.. they always have some promotion where you can snag something from them for cheap. 

Today I recall seeing two cheese slices and a soda for $4.99 which is great if you're looking for a quick meal during your lunch break. I recall a few times I've ordered a XL pizza for something around $6.99, thats crazy cheap. They pizza is also decent, medium crust, crispy,  they do not skimp out on the toppings, but you gotta eat it quick or else you'll face the dreaded soggy pizza (probably from having too many toppings). Their meat calzone is tasty, but also suffers from soggy syndrome if you wait too long.

My man and I got 2 calzones, which was the prefect amount for the LS deal. He got the meat and I got the veggie calzone. I finished two of those deliciously cheesy and veggie stuffed pies and I was spent. 

Just to be clear, this isn't a restaurant or sit down restaurant. You come, you order and you leave happy, because you just got pizza or a yummy calzone.

I call back and they tell me the order never made it out of the kitchen and they would have to remake it. They told me they would take 30% off if I was ok with waiting another 45 mins. I told them no thanks and they then offered me 40% off. Again, I said no thanks, and then they proceeded to hang up on me like I was the one that messed up.

I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. There was barely any sauce whatsoever on the pizza, and also barely any toppings. It was basically just bread/crust mostly.

If you're a ""stoner"", and it's the ""wee hours"" of the morning, and you don't want to be bothered to make a Frozen Pizza, and just have to have Pizza, this is the only reason you go, or call this place.

On the positive side, they are open 24/7 and deliver. So, if you are unable to drive, this beats a DUI. That's about it.

First, if you look at the pictures, you will note that you can certainly taste the cheese in the Pizza. That's because they are very stingy with the toppings. I dare you to find the Italian Sausage on a Sausage Pizza. Good luck.

Very inconsistent taste, and not that good.

I get my Pedicures next door to this place and was curious. So, one day I had to feed the workers at my house, and thought, ""I can feed a group, and get off cheap.""

I also bought a medium, only $5, for my pet groomers.

I paid the price. The next day, my workers boycotted my house, and the pet groomer mysteriously canceled my regular appoinment to have my Pug bathed and groomed.

My image for being generous with my help, took a big hit.

Lesson, if you are stoned and really have a bad case of the ""munchies"", don't spoil the exerience with this Pizza. Find someone who is sober, and make the journey to Jack In The Box.

The store front says open 24 hours, as well as a sign inside stating open 365 days a year. I assumed that they need to be open that much in order to keep their business running. 

I ordered the margarita pizza, as well as meat lovers special. Let's start with the margarita pizza. It was literally a cheese pizza, with basil and tomatoes on it.. Mind you, the tomatoes were just thrown on there; not cooked or anything. As a matter of fact, when you bite into the pizza, the tomatoes are still cold.

The meat lovers pizza was nothing to love. It was a cheese pizza, with ham & sausage. I've had better pizza at Chuck E. Cheese. Of both pizzas, there was nothing worth remembering.. Even the marinara sauce was just tomato paste. No seasoning, nothing! I've had better pizza at Little Cesar's.

I could only eat about 2 slices before I was completely over it. The medium was really a small compared to other comparable places, and definitely not worth the money. 

I also ordered a Caesar salad with my order. Again, nothing special. The dressing that came with it literally seems like they went to Costco or Sam's club and bought the packets in bulk. With the price of everything along with the quality of their product, it's no wonder why everything is sold so cheap. You're literally getting what you pay for! 

Word to the wise, don't come here. You're better off going to Little Cesar's or Chuck E. Cheese. Same price, but better pizza. I wouldn't even serve this pizza to people I hate, and that's saying something!",qlfcirJBeXRWhRfKYWMohg,1,0,1,VaDjVhj-XPywU0ZT1LE1ow

I love Pizza Hut and ceasers soo I thought it was awesome. Deff amazing drunk food I would imagine too. The meatballs were ok and the sauce it was in was kinda sour not bad just I prefer sweet. The icing bread thing tho I didn't like it much. 
Butttt besides what I thought was good Pizza ,
Open 24 hours which is awesome. 
Delivery only took 25-30 mins 
Nothing was burnt 
The delivery guy was really nice and professional 
Very cheap prices as well. I order online and got 20% off. The medium pizza was only 8$ !!! 
My whole entire order plus delivery charge and tax was only 16$! CHEAP and it was pretty damn good for how dirt cheap it was. You want gourmet ? You gotta pay for that. But to me this was just fine.

Side note - today is my day off and normally would always go for some pizza or something so decided to try it. 

White Garlic pizza - First off I am a huge fan of white garlic pizza if its done right like. either with a oil garlic blend on it. This one well not so much. The crust was super buttery I mean like if you like butter then this is your pizza for you.. I think I should of copied Philip T advise and got hammered then came in here then ordered. The cheese is ok and not sure on the dough I can't make out if its homemade or not to me it has a weird taste to it either being a PHO- Dough or real I still can't figure out. 

I ordered chicken wings there more lollipop style witch I guess is the rage here.. to me its over played. Give me a high quality jumbo chicken wing over these any day. They where ok however no sauce and asked for sauce. 

Also for to go or delivery you get these blue cheese and guessing ranch packets they say artificially flavored -- Its not a good practice to have these I recommend going with some other company that does not word this -- due to the fact I trashed them Its not that hard to make blue cheese or buy in -- actually Kerns blue cheese is really good and if you get that I would recommend getting some more blue cheese crumbles and combining the 2 it killer good. 

Overall -- If your not drunk, high .. on life that is then this place might not be for you

Eating should be about exceptions and overcoming them especially in Vegas.
