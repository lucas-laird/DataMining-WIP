Decent looking room, all though it was lit wrong.

The service was friendly but the food was simply awful.  I understand that it can be hard to put out a dinner for 50 people, but this crossed the line.   We waited an hour between the third and fourth courses and then didn't want to eat our lamb.

Our other courses consisted of a ""short rib"" that was basically beef jerky, a steak salad that was swimming in dressing while managing to have most of the lettuce dry, and a store bought brownie in watery vanilla sauce.

The highlight of our night was when a waiter came over and took our picture and told me that I looked like I wanted to punch someone.   My response: ""He's probably wearing a chef's jacket""",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,5,1,2,WOrNKRx2oGHEKmLw42GZkQ

1040686,2013-10-10,0,YAiHkQAQ9sm23V1CyNT2zQ,"DO NOT eat here but more importantly DO NOT drink here! Omgosh the service is awful. My boyfriend and I attended a wine and canvas event here and that was fun but the bartendar in the room was terrible. I think her name was christy or crissy. She would loudly throw around glass containers and they made a loud crashing clinking sound that startled everyone. She didn't care. We asked her for some whiskey and she said, ""well that bottle has been up there for years and I'm not going up there to get it"". It was displayed on a shelf, God forbid she have to do her job! When we approached her about ordering food she looked at us like we were bothering her. Not friendly or customer-service oriented at all! When she handed the food the people she just put the plates in their face and didn't even look at them, there was no eye contact, it was like ""here take your food"". I would never go there again. We also heard her complaining about some nachos. I guess someone ordered nachos but they were in the restroom and she kept yelling ""nachos, whoever ordered nachos, your food is ready!"" She just left them on the counter and said, ""well she paid for them already so ..."" I feel that customer service is really important, there are plenty of other places people can go where they'll get better service. I do not recommend this place.",El4ASqeULxEUgPYfzJbbBQ,3,0,1,5essejBuM92o9gXI4oPc6Q
1482529,2014-06-09,0,YAiHkQAQ9sm23V1CyNT2zQ,"For those Las Vegans who may remember the great food from North Beach Cafe, well Ozzie is back, running the restaurant of the same name inside Bogey's Bar. We've been twice now, and all our favorites on on the menu: we have tried caprese, house salad, chicken Marsala, fish of the day (Basa), salmon, and a fettuccini pizza, all were really good. Wine was very reasonably priced, and the cool bar seating is still there. 

The gaming bar is on the other side, so the dining area was nice and quiet and relaxed, good for conversation with family. Great neighborhood gem.",lH88RlfNZP4V9S-I0FCbhQ,2,0,4,Vu_sUJ2DRtl_0jtT5YB4cQ

Talking about prices I would say they have the best prices for draft beers and taquilla shots were fair priced.
And then the peperoni pizza was great hot and delicious.
Very recommended you guys should go and try out the place.",d8yKZSq4zneeHT2DXpJotQ,0,0,5,m-NIMv3aLheoCkJ1EM0EQA
2309080,2014-09-20,0,YAiHkQAQ9sm23V1CyNT2zQ,Went once and it will be my last. There were two ladies working there and a group of 5 playing poker to the side of the bar. I sat at the bar for AT LEAST 15 minutes (mind you no one else but the poker players were there) until I was greeted. It took ANOTHER 10 minutes to get a drink. Service is horrible.,tijY6q1RKwXi3yG8ckF2EA,1,0,1,_nnU5AcStJlVHalsy9xzkQ
2411924,2017-03-28,0,YAiHkQAQ9sm23V1CyNT2zQ,"I had dinner with about 14 friends at Bogey's Bar and Grill in North Las Vegas, NV on Saturday, 3-25-17.  The place has a very welcoming atmosphere.  The service is very good.  The food was really good.  (I was unable to order a full meal as I was still quite full from lunch; however, I had a really yummy half-salad and a grilled Italian sausage, and they were delicious.)  Fresh, ciabatta type bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and/or lots of butter was served throughout the meal.  I had a taste of the meals of the people on either side of me--eggplant parm (which was the best I've ever had) and a seafood angel hair pasta dish (excellent).  Although the grilled Italian sausage is not on the menu (it's ordinarily served in sauce) they grilled it for me and served it to me that way--exactly as I requested--which is good service in my book.  It was a side order and served w/sauce on the side--very nice.  The tiramisu dessert was much better than average and beautifully presented.",KtsA89oWfXWKyNtmH4sh7g,0,0,4,Ozoetpq_KV0RvtvmTbjE3Q
2492295,2012-03-18,6,YAiHkQAQ9sm23V1CyNT2zQ,"Ive always wanted to visit bc it doesnt look like your average bar. However the service was horrible. It seems like its a place that only caters to their older regular crowd. There were a number of things that were rude:

1. The hostess looked like a deer caught in the headlights. She provided no info about the establishment and was not at all warm and welcoming

2. The older male bartender advised me and my two friends to sit at the part of the bar with no machine games, JUST IN CASE the other patrons wanted to hop games

3. He was very persistent that we needed to order our drinks before we can order our food

4. In an effort to be nice, my friend asked ""what drinks do you make best"" he looked at her in acknowledgment and pointed to me for my order , thus ignoring her

5. As i cash out from playing black jack for 5.50. He ask me to play again so i could lose and he only has to give me an even 5. He proceeds to start pressing the buttons for me.

This place may he lovely its regulars, but it cant be good for business to treat new comers like this. 

Not to mentions the spinach dip was like white nacho dip with green clumps in it",JyA-y8z7UKJVOaIY9L6_aA,12,0,1,lkNSvQT4sdeXYIiTO4PIuw

No biggie, we figured we'd try the bar. We stood and waited for several minutes before the bartender acknowledged our presence. My Mom asked if they were open for lunch and she said ""Yeah but there are no minors allowed here"" in reference to me. Highly unprofessional, in my opinion. I may not look my age but I can certainly pass for 21. I was offended and we left. If you're unsure of somebody's age, ask to see their ID.

The bar tender is an asshole. Was all worried about how much we where playing and wouldn't comp our shots because we did play enough. Between the two of us we played $40 and we where only there for an hour. 

If your over 60 this might be a decent place for you. If you are under 60 STAY AWAY!

The restaurant rock tho...",pFROGfAQppS4DjESN5q16A,1,0,1,3nhnvntK5q3cQwveQzDwdQ

Vic is our go to guy because he's classy, yet he clearly takes an ""I don't take any sh$t demeanor"".  That's NOT to discount his class and top notch treatment but simply to say the man can handle the clowns that may decide to venture in. He speaks with sophistication yet not in a way that demeans anyone.
