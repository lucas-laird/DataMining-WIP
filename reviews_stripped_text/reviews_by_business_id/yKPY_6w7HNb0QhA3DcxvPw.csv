This place should be ashamed of even pretending to be a Brazilian BBQ.  The food is horrendous and the service was rude.  One of ladies in our party ordered a steak medium and it was brought well done.  When she asked that it be taken back, the waitress was quite rude and returned about 30 minutes later with a rare steak.  When our friend once again brought the error to the waitresses attention, she said ""The steak is done to whatever you want to say it is done to"".   The maanegr eventually intervened and we had no waitress for the rest of the meal.

The beans were horrible, the creamed spinach was like soup, and the plantains were cold.  Save your money!",0e2-_ZANhDMa1Q-sUADp-A,2,0,1,qdCt_2l1Hk0gqsgw0aYg6A

The only things we liked were:  
1) Bacon Wrapped Turkey
2) Sirloin 

And they honestly were not amazing... just better than the other options.

The meal started out slow, where we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the starting salad (iceburg lettuce with some beets).  The sides were also subpar, just tiny bowls of plantains, beans, rice, and stir-fried green beans/carrots.

What really annoyed me was that the first skewer of ""meats"" to come around were garlic bread and chicken legs.  Really?!  My husband was so hungry that he tried one of each, which I guess is Samba's strategy.  They were both kind of gross.

The other meats were okay, but for the price I expected a lot better quality of meat.  Finally, the dessert comes, and I was hoping that it would save the meal.  But sadly they were literally little shot glasses of flavored pudding...  A big disappointment!

So if you are dining at the Mirage, do not make the same mistake we did!  Eat at the Cravings buffet instead!",gVaFXfqESHZ651BBvvltMA,2,1,1,1Rv1jxdSOARdpBOk2gQbcQ

Went here because I wanted all you can eat Brazilian BBQ before going to see a show here.

All the appetizers and side dishes have NO flavor except the plantains. They're ok but nothing worth visiting for.

The meat was all dry & flavorless as well. Their only slightly good meat was their signature sirloin & apparently that's the only meat they flavor. I'm a meat eater, I'm not an amateur at these places, & let me tell you, this place isn't worth it.

1/  Service is prompt and courteous, which I like.  They did a great job of explaining what everything was, etc.  With their bread, they passed out this amazing olive oil / garlic / something awesome mixture that my boyfriend gobbled up - literally.

2/  The meat was really tasty.  I liked the ginger soy flak steak the best.  I also liked something else, that was basically salted and peppered steak.  I had an outside piece, tho, whihc got to be a little salty.

3/  What kind of stinks is once you figure out you like something, it's hard to get it back again.

4/  I pretty much did not like anything with a bone, mostly 'cause it was hard to eat.  They did have salmon, however, which was tasty but a tiny bit dry.

5/  The fried plantains were my favorite part of the whole meal, though I have a natural fondness of fried plantains and that might be why.

Overall, great experience.  It is a trifle loud because it is open to the whole casino - however, we were tucked in the back corner and away from the majority of the noise, which was nice.",PV0WD7-Dx83W14mWaWraZw,2,0,4,j_rPQRX0Gh-F_8e01lxjlA

Lately it had been going downhill but we decided to go there again this trip as we are Brazilian steakhouse regulars and there is only one other choice (Pampas at Planet Hollywood) on the strip. We made a reservation and requested a booth. We showed up and they didn't honor the request for a booth. Granted, it's a request, but they kept telling us they had 4 parties reserved for those booths and they sat the first group about 10 minutes before we left. The other booths were open. That ticked me off, but we still wanted to make the most of it. Our waiter was horrible - I think it was Peter. He only came to our table twice after the initial time and both times we had yelled out to catch him walking by-once for a drink and once when we had been waiting over 15 minutes for the check. He was rude, rude, rude. The meat comes by very rarely, which I'm assuming is how these restaurants make more money. Sure, it's all you can eat, but only when they bring you the mediocre meat to accept. Sides were good, but that's about it. Will NEVER go again.We left NO tip, which we had NEVER done - not even in bad experiences at other places. He didn't deserve a penny for being so rude and avoiding us.

With two young ones in tow (7 & 11) and on a BUDGET, we wanted to make sure the venue was conducive to a family environment where we would all feel comfortable.  The restaurant opened at 5:30pm which was the time of our reservation.

We were pleasantly surprised our table was ready and waiting for us as soon as they opened. Situated in the back, a few tables pushed together against comfy bench seating, we were the only ones in that area for most of the dinner.  We were quickly given water, drinks, bread, and tasty dippings to start the evening off.

As soon as the drinks were served, the side dishes were served, which was great since we were concerned about my mom's 9pm flight that same night.  This can truly be a ""no-carb"" lovers dream dinner with the amount of meat that was served.

(Taken from Anthony C.)
-Slow cooked Sausage and Sweet Peppers
-Honey Brushed Turkey Breast Roulade Wrapped in Bacon  **YUMM**
-Huli Huli Chicken Hawaiian Style  **Good**
-Churrasco Sirloin ""Picanha"" Style   **YUMM**
-Fresh Fish of the Day   **Salmon - YUMM**
-Brazilian Style Baby Back Pork Ribs  **OK***
-""Alho"" Style Chicken Legs  **Ok**
-Ginger Soy Flank Steak  **Good** 
-Slow Roasted Pork and Pineapple  **YUMM**

Aside from the initial dips served with bread, the side dishes weren't that great.  I love fried plantains, but these were fried and drenched in some rummy honey sauce that I didn't feel complimented much. The creamed spinach was bland, and the carrots were, just carrots.  The black beans and rice were probably best, but not much too remember.  

The kiddies were happy as they had lots of meat to choose from and they brought out plain white rice. 

We opted to have the dinner on one CC and the beverages on another, of which they were very accommodating.

**Important - If you'd like to have cake with dinner - and you bring from outside - they will assess a $5/pc cake cutting charge. ($60 for our group - outrageous!!).  If you order the cake from within the Mirage Food & Beverage, the fee will be waived. My schedule was hectic last week and wasn't able to make the cake reservation until Sun 07/15 for dinner the next evening.  If time permits, I HIGHLY recommend you take care of this at least a week prior, otherwise you will run into some difficulty as I did.  
**The cake for 15 persons was $55, chocolate cake w/ chocolate custard. Quite tasty.  Because I called with such short notice they advised the cake would only be covered with white fondant and they wouldn't be able to do decorations.  However, the cake arrived to the restaurant, on time, beautifully decorated and tasted great.  Just call the reservation # for the restaurant and ask for the ""Mirage Food & Beverage"".  They will try to get you to someone who can help take the cake order.

I would definitely recommend this dinner.  At $34.95/per person for the Rodizio Experience, this fit into our family budget of $600 for the night. We went a bit over on drinks, but for the most part this worked out well.  Enjoy!!",yg04mIl82nD84gYy3AReBQ,0,1,5,zDfKY6Ua6vk7T-gKlVxueA

The WORST rodizio steakhouse we have EVER been to. To start with, the manager was, well, to be honest,  an a$$. 

They charge a $50 corkage fee per bottle of wine.  With a few bottles of wine eith us, we asked if there was any way to cap the corkage fee. His response was a very nasty NO, if you don't like it, well too bad.  Ok, forget the wine. Not a big deal. 

After our dealings with the manager, our server basically ignored us. Thank goodness for another server who was happy to help. One waiter actual apologized to us, letting us know the manager is just an a$$ (his words). 

Onto the food....every meat served was tough, overcooked and improperly cut. Not a single person in our party ate more than one taste of each cut served. One person in our party was vegetarian.  They charged  $25 for a salad. 
The sides were awful.  The plantains were more acidic and sour than sweet. The vegetables boring. The beans and rice were pretty good. As was the cheese bread.

Moving on...we paid our bill and left, tipping only the server who was helpful. 
One person in our party left his cell phone. Another had grabbed it. The person whose phone it was went back to look for his phone, and when he walked back into the restaurant and explained that he left his phone was told by the original server ""too bad. Nothing we can do. Get out"". He said he needed to look for his phone and was again told to ""get out"".

Maybe I'm spoiled, but my first Brazilian steakhouse restaurant experience years ago had a veritable parade of delicious meats, and the places I've been to since then, including Samba, have *not* lived up to that standard. I believe there were about 8 choices total. I understand that with certain commodities concerns right now that beef is pricey, but there were only two kinds of beef that came by, which was disappointing. I like pork and chicken just fine, but for $45 I want a better spread. And the pao de queijo might as well have just been pao de nada for all the flavor it had. I took one bite and set it aside, not worth the stomach space and calories.

The frequency of the selections coming by was just fine, so I have no issue with that aspect of the service, but we were frequently annoyed by the waitstaff who kept trying to clear our table when we were clearly still trying to enjoy ourselves. We had flipped over the marker to signal we didn't need any more attendants coming by, which then started our server and some bussing staff coming by every few minutes to clear things from the table, including the sides and bread that we were still eating. Here's an idea: when a table still has half a pitcher of sangria left, maybe don't try to rush them out the door by clearing everything off the table like you're ready to boot them out the door even when the restaurant is half-empty. When our waiter brought by to-go cups it was just another sign of ""you're not gone yet?"" and we promptly took our drinks on the road.

The biggest part of dining Brazilian is the experience, and it's always a long one at that. Meals take hours, and most of them are not spent eating but enjoying the ambiance and the company. I can see wanting us to move along if the restaurant was packed and people were waiting on the table, but to hover over us while we were trying to enjoy our drinks and conversation does not make for an inviting atmosphere. Makes me wish we had just gone to one of the buffets, where the selection would have been better and no one would be taking away the food before we were done with it.",oX7FclnXbnrp0mt4mNNIAw,1,1,2,SK21oo2GD778lraTTVwPzg

The steak (filet mignon, I think) was very good too. The service was attentive yet not intrusive, just the way I like it - but I also had a chance to observe our server helping the party next to us who were completely baffled by the Rodizio option, and he did a great job helping them navigate the experience.

If you're into that, they have cute, colorful cocktails; the wine list is not really impressive, but it's a Brazilian grill, so... I thought it was cute that they pronounce the name of the dishes as if they were in Spanish, but it's probably a wise choice on their part, too :) - the restaurant is in the middle of the casino, so the noise level probably calls for simplifying the experience for the guests, not complicating it (though the noise level never interfered with our conversation).

I can't get over the reviews on this post. I'm sorry but this place should not be considered a Brazilian Restaurant by any means.  I have been to Brazil and had excellent Rodizio experiences. I have been to New York, Philadelphia and actually Charlotte and had great Rodizio experiences but this one is for the birds. 

Where do I start? 

oh, the pre-buffet with Fish...oh right, they don't have that so I can't tell you how that was....
The meat. Very very so-so in my Book. The best meat being that last to come out, the Picanta (sp) Flank Steak. It was the ONLY choice of meat to taste Brazilian in nature with obvious sea salt and garlic added. The chicken was very bland without ANY hit of lime or garlic. and the Ribs were also lacking in taste - usually my favorite part of this experience. I could find the taste of the grill on only about 2 choices of meats. The sausage was very dry as well. And they didn't serve any brisket or chicken hearts. Again....how is this place considered 'Brazilian?'

The experience? 
Usually, Brazilian eating is like a celebration but the waiters looked hurried and one selection of meat was extreeemly rare and another was cold. I didn't want to object with my 7 guests when I was there but this place really really bothered me. At least the drinks were strong but even they were screwed up. We ordered larges and the drinks came out in a very strange fishing bowl type of glass which you couldn't even pick up. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this place!!!

On top of that, they were playing mexican music in Spanish. Words to the wise...Brazilians speak Portuguese and they have very limited horns in their samba music. If i wanted to hear mexican music, I would go to a mexican restaurant. The name of the place is Samba....how about a little Samba music instead??

Ok. enough of my bitch'in....if you're familiar with any kind of Brazilian Steakhouses, this place will leave you very disappointed. If you're a tourist looking to fill up with meat and drinks - enjoy.... I'm going to try Pompas (sp) next in Planet Hollywood...hopefully, they're are better.",SbnWPVIMrIAkyEN-aj459A,1,1,1,lE-LfTkOtyq21gJ0WAzbqA

Seeing as how I lived in Rio de Janeiro for 4 years I feel like I know good churrasco when I see it, and Samba is good churrasco! The product is to die for, the meats are perfectly cooked and seasoned, the fresh mozzarella is fab, and the little golden secret is their green garlic sauce... GOLD! I put that stuff on everything! Granted I love love love garlic, so if you're not a garlic fan you may not be as nuts about it as I am but it was literally to die for. The sides are delicious also, beans and rice, creamed spinach, etc. My only complaint about Samba are the pao de queijos or cheese breads don't taste authentic, the center should be soft and buttery and it was hard and somewhat grainy. Only because I think they were trying to make a 
""gourmet"" version of the cheese breads but really you just have to go with tradition! Also, the capirinhas which are a traditional Brazilian mixed drink were delicious and very large, even for big drinkers one will give you serious bang for your buck.

When I made Reservations , the person was so kind, seemed to have all our concerns and requests down. We would have 4 kids 1 Autistic, she is not a problem but cannot eat anything there but maybe bread. We had a birthday. there would be 4 adults 4 kids. 
There were only 4 tables with customers at the  time we arrived , it never got busy. 
1. we arrive and were sat next to the kitchen , I mean almost in it. 3 of us  up against a wall , waited over! 20 minutes to be acknowledge. Had to beg for some water , guy came back splashed water all over us reallllyyyy fast went around , missed 2 of us. He ran so fast off , we had to wait until someone walked by , begged again, never came back.
2 . 45 minutes later starving , thirsty, a guy came by asked if we (did not introduce in anyway himself) wanted a drink from the bar , we said at this point we needed water and were ready to order. OK he said and ran off.
3. can back went around took order , let him know about our Autistic girl and please don't put anything on her plate . OK and he went off, STILL NO WATER. WE now find out there is NO SALAD BAR! FALSE ADVERTISING!!
4. Now over an hour , we catch a guy with water walking past, we beg for some. Now a guy brings 5 tiny rolls and plops them in the middle of the table and  runs off. WE all jump on them like we have not eaten in 9 hours, and fight over them. Then beg someone again walking by for some more explaining there are 9 of us and 5 rolls. NOTHING.
5. Here comes the salad from the guy who took our order, looks like its been sitting around for a while SOAKY gross, he goes around plopping it on the plates , we see him going toward are 6 year old we told him NOT  to put anything on her plate, we all start yelling NO ,NO,Poor thing she starts yelling  NO THANK YOU! NO THANK YOU! HE PLOPS IT ON HER PLATE, AND SAYS TOO LATE! . We could not believe it.
6. We finally had a few people stop by with some meat, not very many or much because we were in a corner and hard to get to. All but one of the meats were REALLY BAD, TUFF AND UN EATABLE. 
7. The sides were awful except for the Plantains , black beans watery from a can, white rice that was crispy, gross zucchini. The rolls were great buy we only got 9 , so I didn't get any, there was not enough.
8. Now we had not seen the guy, who apparently was our waiter, in over an hour, I had to ask a guy walking by again for some water , he said I would have to ask my waiter WHAT? WE HAVE A WAITER?  HE WAS LIKE AHHHH I THINK SO AND LEFT. 
9 . THEN he got us water. We sat for another 40 minutes finally I got up and said we needed our bill, here comes our waiter drops it off and runs , no how is everything or any words. I look at it and they charged us for all the kids for the over 10 price INCLUDING THE 6 YEAR OLD THAT ATE NOTHING AND HAD A MELT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE WAITER!! 
10 WAITED AGAIN ANOTHER 15 MINUTES. i GOT up went to the manager said we have a 1,4, 6 and 8 year old, oh oh he said , he came back and took off 1 of them, 
11. we had a birthday, no mention of that, but at this point we wanted out of there.

HERE.S THE KICKER I WAS CHANGED OVER 50 BUCKS FOR AT TIP!! BECAUSE THERE WAS  9 OF US , BUT 5 WERE KIDS. This was bad but made worse. and I tried to talke to them they were so rude!! 
I have tried to call 7 times, no call back WE have a child with a disability and witnesses .

The only annoyance with our meal was that the wait staff was somewhat sluggish in attending to the table for non-meat-related things, such as refilling our water glasses or giving us the check. However, this is understandable due to the high number of customers (it was, after all, New Year's Eve).

Beef Empenadas - 

Grisly, greasy bits of beef hide away in a decent pastry pocket.  The pastry was very good, having a nice crispy bite to it.  The problem was the horrific gruel that poured out.  

Chicken Skewers - 

Similar to chinese chicken samples given away in a mall, this fatty and flavorless skewer was awful.  We left most of it untouched.

Crab Cakes - 

Tons of mayonnaise and dry cakes made this equally unpleasant.  

We opted not to order anything else.  When our waiter finally arrived, we paid our bill and left.

The price was right for rodízio since I am Brazilian myself, that's usually the price most places charge such as Fogo de Chão and Texas de Brazil.

The food itself was VERY VERY GOOD. But In a rodízio, I just miss having a buffet bar for you to go to and pick out foods, they serve you with Rice, Beans, Salad and Vegetables. But you have to keep asking for ""refills"" which I'm not a fan of. 

We sampled I believe 7-9 types of meats during our stay (Sirloin, Top Round, Lamb, Turkey Sausage, Pork Sausage, Chicken Breast, Pork and pinneaple....and i can't remember if there were others, maybe this was it) 

The food itself was GREAT, the meats were incredibly well seasoned,juicy and tender. So no complaints there. 

THE DESERTS -- You MUST have the Doce de Leite (I dont know if they call it that, was a 3 layer thing, but ask for this)  I am NOT a fan of sweets at all, i simply don't like them, they're usually way too sweet for me and all I taste is sugar. But this one was incredible. So no complaints at all to me this is their signature right here.

Lets just break it down-  Some of the meats were good, some were not so good.  They started with an assortment of bread and crackers, then continued with salad and then brought out the good stuff- the meat!

They started out with two types of chicken both of which were too dry for my taste- lacked flavor too, then brought out a turkey wrapped in bacon which was really just excellent!  next they brought out a roasted pork, which again was too dried out for me. then there was sausage which was decent, then there was a flank steak which was good, but the best dish they brougth out was the sirloin!  perfectly cook, melting in your mouth sirloin!  all that wait was made better JUST for that dish!  My sis had requested a more rare piece, and the attentive waiter quickly went and found a piece just perfect for her.  Their sides were average, didnt care for the cream of spinach or the glazed carrots, although the black beans were good.. I honestly could have done without the sides and head straight for the meat!  

the salad served was great- didnt want to fill up too much on the bread though - saving room for the meat.  

ordered two drinks a mojito and a samba punch.. mojito $10, punch $11.75.  The punch was nearly four times the size of the mojito!  worth it?  YES!

service was really outstanding- they were very very friendly, casual and not too overbearing in your face about eating.  great service, not bad food either!  dont know if i will return there as most the meat dishes were dry, so thats why the 3-star rating; however, if it were for the sirloin.. a full five stars!",BCF9zJkbGukrl9DldTbtRA,0,0,3,IB_mhdMN0OcLE946yTjUww

Loved the plantains.  Cream Spinach was okay but seemed out of place.  Seemed like it should have been served with artichokes and tortilla chips...and perhaps in CPK and not Samba Brazilian Steakhouse.  Anyhoo....

As someone who eats chicken .002/10 times, I must say their chicken was very tasty, meaty and cooked unlike any other chicken I've had before!  Maybe this is why I enjoyed it here and not in general.  I rarely eat steak, but if I ever do, I prefer mine well done, so the steak was not my favorite as it was still moo-ing a bit.  :/  I tried to eat around it, but it was very fatty, so that didn't work very well.  Passed up on the poor lamb.... all I could think of was Mary's little lamb.  (Not the restaurants fault....)  The turkey was really good!  I'm not much of a pork person, but I tried it.  It was good but I only ate it to taste it.

The bread and the chimichurri sauce (?) was so yummy!!  The salad was also really good!  I ate that all!  One of the best salads I've ever had.  Also, the flan was one of the best I've ever had as well.  Not too eggy.  

This place is definitely a man's restaurant, as I think of men as being heavy meat eaters.  I'm sure any meat lover would really love this place.  For me, it was okay.  But it was free for us, so why not? :)

One thing that was a downside for us was the green/red circle on the table.   Red means to stop bringing meats, that you want to just relax for a bit and eat what you have.  Green means keep it coming.  However, even when we had it on red, the food just kept on coming.  Our waiter told us about it twice, so we thought maybe we weren't understanding it.

1. The cuts of meats are poor

1603492,2013-01-16,2,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"To start, this review almost didn't happen, because we almost walked out of the restaurant.  This review might be long, but worth reading if you want to know what you are getting yourself into.

We came by Samba around 5:30 to ask about a later reservation.  We were asked to return at 8:15.

8:15 comes, and our table was not ready yet.  That's fine.  We play some slots, kill some time, then check in again about 15 minutes later.  Still not ready.  We are eventually led to a back room in the restaurant.

We grab seats and are given menus.  We already had chosen what we had wanted, due to the waiting out front to be seated.  20 minutes later, no one has come to even give us water.  It's now a full hour after our reservation time.  Only difference is, we are now an hour hungrier!  Husband sets a timer on his iPhone.  He says, ""when this hits two minutes, we're walking.""

At one minute and 50 seconds, a bus boy walks by, and circles back to talk to us.  Maybe he sensed our hungry anger?  He asked if we had been helped, and immediately brought us water.  He told us our server was Roxanne/Roxanna, and she'd be right over.

Not long after, the same bus boy comes back to our table, bringing a waiter with him.  

James would be our waiter for the remainder of the meal, and he really saved the evening for us.  He was pleasant, sweet, and apologetic about us getting lost in the shuffle.  I'm big on when stores/restaurants/whatever can step up and admit they messed up, so that helped.

We placed our order.  Husband (who is also Brasilian from Brasil) and my brother order the rodizio for $40 each.  I don't eat meat, so I went with the lobster tail.

First thing to come out was our pão de queijo, otherwise known as ""cheese bread"", and some sort of crackers.  Pão de queijo is pretty amazing, but the one here had some garlic going on inside?  It wasn't quite right.  It was good, but wahhh I wished it was more traditional.  If that makes me sound like a brat, so be it.  It's a Brasilian BBQ restaurant.

Along with the bread came some vinaigrettes/sauces.  One was a pico de gallo, the other was a phenomenal garlic vinaigrette.  

For appetizers, we ordered the beef empanadas and the coconut shrimp.  Both were delicious.  The shrimps were HUGE!!  

Before the meat came out, you are given a plate of salad.  A lot of time actually passes before you get to have your meat.  I'd suggest skipping appetizers to speed up the process.  It's almost like they're trying to fill you before the meat comes, but since you pay so much, you feel some sort of obligation to eat a ton of meat anyway, and walk out feeling like a fat tick about to pop.  

The salad is okay, but it is already mixed and has a heavy dressing on it.  Most Brasilian BBQ places have astounding salad bars, but not here.

After the salad, all of the sides came out.  Rice and black beans, plantains, creamed spinach...  All really delicious.  

The meats started rotating, and my lobster tail came out.

Again, all was good.

So other than the weird pão de queijo (round cheese breads), all of the food was great.  The service in the beginning was wretched.  For the price we paid, we could think of at least a dozen other places we'd have rather spent our money.

So while the food WAS good, we'd still not return.",QKbq76KuUHLRZjWXDtbwWQ,6,0,3,RNebupK6-QLL3fPW6yv7GQ

Between the Cravings and Samba, I would rate them the same - as it is primarily your choice of foods and how tired you are (if you want to be served or not), since quality of food seems to be similar as well.

I've had farmer's market Brazilian grill at WeHo and enjoyed it a lot more - as the price was decent and the meat was juicer. Samba had great service, and great ambience/decor, however I felt that the selection of foods on the AYCE menu was a bit disappointing - maybe I was expecting more varieties and juicier meats. Some of the varieties that I enjoyed: the top sirloin (very juicy and tasty), the bacon wrapped turkey, and lamb. The chicken was  hard to chew since it was over-grilled, with lots of charcoal around the edges - so did not like the two chicken varieties. 

The sides that we enjoyed - the bean and rice (they also had pesto sauce in it, which was really nice), the salad (loved the olives and the baby palm tree hearts - pretty exotic?), and the grilled vegetables with brussels sprouts. The fried plantain (bananas) were a bit hard, and tasted sour. 

even though we used a BOGO offer, it still came out around $70 for some reason - so I think there was a bit miscellaneous charges that put me off. Overall, I think it was a good, one time experience.",m5heP-HiotiMxmbdI0CmDg,1,0,3,67DWSa9Ae0mdWghq-xbobg

Also our waitress was not the friendliest girl around. She kept telling us about stuff and with the loud music playing it was hard to understand her. She had that look on her face like ""Don't you know what that is?""

The truth is NO we didn't know all the ins and outs about sushi.

I want you to keep in mind I am a girl, and if I had to list my favorite foods, meat in general does not really top the list.  Ok with that in mind here goes.  The food is 39.95 a plate (per person) and this amount does not take into account drinks or tax.

So this is one of those experiences that you really should try at least once.  The wait staff was very attentive and the atmosphere is dark, but nice.  It is inside the Mirage and there is a Casino and Nightclub right by, so if you are looking for a quiet place, you just might want to go elsewhere.  So when you get seated the waiter of course takes your drink orders and then describes how the process works.  For people who have no idea this is a necessary step.  So though I cannot explain the entire experience I will try to sum it up.  We ordered the All you can eat Rodizio Experience, and experience it is! The main course is meat, which is served on the skewer, and this is like no skewer you have ever seen!  The guy serving our group was almost the same size as the skewer..lol.  There is a huge variety of meat to choose from, they have the following (that I can remember):  sausage, turkey, pork, chicken, lamb, chicken with pineapple, top sirloin, rib eye, and flank steak.  I think I am missing something because honestly by the end of it all you are in a ""meat coma"" LoL.

Rodizio is the ultimate all you can eat barbecue, offering unlimited portions of marinated meats and poultry. Rodizio is a uniquely Brazilian style of barbecue offering a wide variety of flavors. Each course is skewered and slowly roasted over coals in a special Brazilian rotisserie. These items are served in random order along with traditional side dishes of black beans and rice, sweet fried plantains, creamed spinach, farofa carrots, and a bottomless bowl of ""Samba Salad"" tossed tableside.

They do have grilled veggies as well on the skewers, which are amazing as well.  The flavors are all very unique, and I am VERY glad we ate here.  The boys ate LOTS of meat, but I swear I don't think I even tried it all...it was just crazy amounts of food.

We had M-Life 2 for 1 credits, so the four of us ate for half price. Although, drinks are crazy expensive ($16 for a glass of house red wine) which bumps the total up quite a bit.

The restaurant itself is not large, and is open to the casino, so it lacks that intimate, restaurant feel. The decor is bright and colorful and the light fixtures (a bunch of bananas!) are inventive and pretty. A mixed salad with Greek olives, feta cheese, chickpeas, and a zesty dressing is brought out and served; no sumptuous salad bar you berate yourself for filling up on! The bread is little round pillows of cheesy goodness. A chimichurri sauce on the table was outstanding. Then come the meats, served to you on long sabers from which your portions are cut....The Rodizio dinner includes all the meats except filet, and no seafood. We had lamb (delicious!), sirloin (yum!), pork with grilled pineapple (kind of dry), bacon-wrapped turkey roulades (also dry), marinated chicken drumsticks (a little hard). But all you need are two or three you find delicious and they'll keep them coming. The meat server remembered how each of us liked our meats and that my daughter did not want red meat, she was great. There is also garlic bread chunks on a saber, large bread squares slathered in chimichurri and grilled.....amazing.

Our service was good until it we had clearly finished our meal, said no to dessert, and then our server disappeared.He was nowhere to be found for almost 30 minutes. Then it was another 20 after he took our credit cards, so it ended up taking us almost as long to pay as it did to eat!

It's apparently brought to you on a skewer and put on a platter (I was at the bar so I got a platter of meat). 

I order some ginormous drink called a Caipirinha (actually I had 2) and it kicked my butt pretty good. I went on to gamble away 50 bucks in the casino without hesitation and called it a night. 

Anyway, the food was good, got a bit loud because of a group of frat boys, good selection of meats from chicken to lamb to marinated steak and some sides of veges (creamed spinach, carrots, rice & beans).

I would imagine, being next to the Beatles Lounge in the middle of a casino doesn't create the best environment for gauchos and REALLY large knives.  

The food was more or less what I expected it to be with a bunch of non brazillian influences on their skewers. Last time I checked Hawaiian Style has NO place with Brazillian steakhouses.  Where are the Chicken Hearts?  Ginger Soy flank steak?  Really?

2361221,2012-10-20,1,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"This place wasn't terrible, but I certainly think of it as the poor man's Texas de Brazil/Via Brasil/Fogo de Chao. It's at least $10 cheaper for the rodizio dinner than the other three churrascarias I've been to and you definitely get what you pay for.

My boyfriend and I were originally going to go to The Steak House at Circus Circus, but they were completely booked for the next few hours (this was around 7) and we wanted to check out Fright Dome, which was open from 7 - midnight. We felt like steak, though, and I did a quick search on yelp and this place came up nearby. We decided we'd check out this Brazilian steakhouse, since we been to a few others and liked what they offered.

The first thing we noticed was that there was no salad bar. When you're seated, they give you the usual Brazilian cheese bread (not as good as the others, imo), which I just found out is called pão de queijo, and some other crackers; with them came chimichurri and pico de gallo. A busser came by with a bowl of salad a few moments later and plopped it down on our plates. Unlike what the menu says, it is not tossed tableside. I think it was prepared prior to our arrival, maybe extra salad that was prepared for some another table, because the greens were a little soggy with dressing. It wasn't terrible, but it looked like it wasn't made for us. Well, actually, the lettuce also looked a little old, so it just might've been wilted because of that rather than soggy. Either way, I wasn't impressed.

Next, they came by with side dishes. We were given a bowl of rice and black beans with a dollop of pesto on top, creamed spinach, cooked carrots, and fried plantains. At Texas de Brazil and Via Brasil, they don't give you side dishes unless you order them. At Fogo de Chao, they gave them to us. We were confused at first and thought they accidentally mixed up tables, but I don't know for sure. Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that Samba doesn't give you the choice because 1) they come around very little to offer you meat and 2) they have a short menu for their rodizio dinner, so they let you pick at the side dishes while you wait 10+ minutes between servers with skewers.

The service left something to be desired. Our original waiter didn't come back for like an hour and even then, he didn't even come back because he felt the need to check on us. The busser had been serving us and taking care of our drinks; he wasn't very attentive with refilling drinks (we were there for an hour and he refilled my water once and my boyfriend managed to order a second beer). I don't really blame him, though, because it seemed like, besides the servers carrying around skewers, there seemed to be only three other people on the waitstaff. I saw him a lot (Ramiro I think his name was), but our original waiter was rarely seen.

My boyfriend (let's just call him J) made several unsuccessful attempts to flag Ramiro and other servers down to ask for the check. When he finally got his attention, he said he would let our waiter know, which was funny because J actually made eye contact earlier and raised his hand to get our waiter's attention, but he still walked away from us. He was only standing at the next table over. After the busboy walked away, our waiter gave us the check and it took another 10 minutes for him to come back and take it. J was complaining that he probably could've walked to an ATM to get cash and just left it on the table. I said we probably could've dined and dashed and they wouldn't have noticed.

J was surprised that for a place on the Strip, this place was lacking in every area. The only perk, he said, was that it was the cheapest place we'd been to, but I pointed out that you get what you pay for. I would gladly pay another $10 to have service. SERVICE. Not better or more service -- just to have anyone come by at all would be great. Samba is considerably smaller than the other churrascarias yet as busy as the other places get, their servers are on top of everything. I've seen meats cycle around at least twice during the meal. I rarely saw Samba's servers and only one came by twice, though at that point, we were already full of side dishes and drinks to have anything else. It isn't so much ""all you can eat"" as it is ""eat as much as we give you... whenever we feel like showing up."" Or maybe ""here, have some side dishes.""

I don't know if they were down a few people tonight or what, but they could certainly use more people on their staff and their current staff needs to up their game.

Toward the end of our visit, while waiting for someone to pick up our check, I looked at J and said, ""Never again."" He wholeheartedly agreed.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,1,1,2,X_hxQIqyaW42Y6JODcZ-uA

2434687,2012-10-15,2,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"Ok, I was back in Vegas again last week for business.  Samba is always the first place I start craving to eat at whenever I'm in Vegas, so as usual, went there again on my first night in town.  Although the Rodizio (meat served continuously from servers carrying skewers of it around) is the most popular thing to order (and really very good in terms of variety, taste and portion)...but I always eat too much when I do the all-u-can eat thing.  

So, I did my ""plan b"" for when I'm not totally ravenous...I ordered the Mahogany Glazed Salmon.  Their salmon is AWESOME, prepared in a different way than I've ever had Salmon anywhere else.  Not exactly sure what's in the Mahogany glaze, but it sure makes Salmon dee-licious!  It still comes with their amazing bread (I love the little cheese rolls with the dipping sauces they bring), their fresh-tossed salad which is great, and their rice/beans, creamed spinach, candied carrots & plantains.  I can't decide if I like their side dishes or their entrees better, I literally eat everything on my plate there.  

Oh, and this last time, I bumped it up a notch and tried their key lime pie for dessert.  I grew up eating the key lime pie at Joe's Stonecrabs (in Miami Beach, and more recently Chicago and Vegas).  Joe's key lime pie is the ""benchmark standard"" of key lime pie.  However, I have to say, I think Samba's gives Joe's a run for their money, it was about the best pie I've ever tasted...definately will be having it again next time I'm in Vegas!  

I'm almost afraid to post this review, and I hope all of y'all don't decide to go to Samba's and make it impossible for me to get a table!

2445050,2014-08-18,0,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"Wow, just wow. I had the Rodizio All-You-Can-Eat Experience and I can say that my dining experience was ruined. 

First off, most of the meats were bland and dry. Now I  finally understand why Gordon Ramsay would take a bite out of a terrible meal and not really eat anymore after that.  He was not being a jerk like some people make him out to be. I too, would be upset if I was fed an injustice done to food. I would rather starve instead of continuing eating terrible food. I just lost my appetite. It was like a punch to the face and I dislocated my jaw. I couldn't stand chewing through their meats. All the meats were basically bunched up in the same spot and seems as if it was cooked on a timer. No attention or care for the meats at all. It does not make sense to me that different meats would be cooked in the same way.

I would say the service is between terrible to mediocre. What confused me during my dining experience though is that one of the servers denied my group a slice of meat because it seems that these servers are assigned tables and that table only. I just wanted my meat! Not only that, but the wait between getting the meats were long. If the meat were decent enough, then I would be staring at an empty plate most of the time. Of course, this wasn't the case since I just couldn't stomach most of the meats after a bite so I just left it to sit on my plate. I feel bad for wasting meat, but it was just that bad.

I had mostly the flank steak and there was no consistency. The first few cuts were medium rare and then towards the end it was extremely rare. The only consistency though was the dryness of the meat. It was so dry that there were no signs of blood anywhere even though the piece was extremely rare. What kind of technique would you have to use to be able to obtain this result? I also had the pineapple, which I was hoping to be a saving grace to add some flavor to the meats, but it was too sweet for my palate and the charred parts tasted like burned marshmallows.

In terms of the Bazilian experience, it was so so. They start you off with pao de quijo and chips. The pao de quijo was absolutely wrong. it was more like a piece of bread if anything. Next was the rice, beans, and sweet plantain, then the salad. I didn't really go for the appetizers since I wanted the meat experience, but my companion did say he enjoyed the beans.

Overall, I spent almost $60 for the meal, tax, and tip (even with a discount!) and I felt I did not get the experience that I paid for. I do not recommend Samba at all, especially if you are a meat eater.

All the meats are skewered and are rotisserie style....oh my yum! You get a variety of meats, all of which are coal roasted right in the middle of the restaurant. I absolutely love the fact that you can watch them cook up the meat, in my eyes, it means they aren't hiding anything in the kitchen. You get a red/green little object (not sure what to call it) so your server knows when you want more or need a break. Pretty sure we kept ours at green for the most part, we couldn't get enough. The staff was very accommodating, I am picky with my meats and do not like them rare, at all. Most of the carvings they were coming around with were too pink for my liking and they had no problem brining mine back to the kitchen to make it a little more well done. Out of all the meats we had, I really enjoyed the pork with pineapple, my mouth is watering right now as I write about it. Of course you must like pineapple to enjoy it but if you do, no doubt this will be a favorite of yours as well.

As for the restaurant itself, its right in the middle of the Mirage. It is very exposed as the layout is extremely opened. Its almost like you're having Brazilian BBQ right on the casino floor. I would  have preferred if the restaurant was more sectioned off from the casino, so you didn't feel like you were right next to a slot machine....but this doesn't change the fact that I had an awesome time here.

First two cuts of meat came out cold. Followed by cold garlic bread on a stick?? Definitely not your typical Brazilian steak house. The top sirloin came out a total of three times. Every time, cold! The best part of the meal was the bread.  Which even that was sub par for a Brazilian steak house. If you've ever been to Texas De Brazil then this place is guaranteed to disappoint you. 
Service was okay I guess.... If Themis was chilis or Applebee's. But for a Brazilian steakhouse I was totally unimpressed all around. They kept my glass mostly topped off. So for that, I'll leave two stars. But even that is mostly out of pity because I feel bad leaving just one star. 
Halfway through our meal they decided to stop bringing us the same three or four meats they had been bringing us. Instead they ignored not just our table, but our whole section until it got to the point that everyone was tired of sitting. And just wanted to leave. Definitely would not recommend to a friend! Luckily there are a lot of other restaurants around. So you won't be stuck with this as your only option. If it wouldn't have made a scene I would have just left without paying the bill, or demanded a refund. But I'm not a fan of making a scene so we just payed the bill and went on our way.

The side dishes were ok.  The beans ok, the carrots too sweet, the spinach pretty good.  The bread at the beginning was good too, round little puffs with cheese in the middle and a garlicky olive oil dipping sauce.  We did ask for more plantains, I will give them that.

My only real knock against Samba is the pace at which the food was delivered. The place wasn't super busy, but it felt as though they were in a hurry to rush us out the door.

I had made a reservation, but upon arriving I could see I didn't need one. That made me question my choice for dinner when we were seated as were we one of just three other tables in the restaurant. 

When seated we were instructed that to have the waiters come over to serve needed by turning this short wooden dowel with the green side up. When we do not want any more or would like a break we are to turn the dowel red side up. Simple enough. We turn it with the green on top and here we go.. Not long after a server came around with a long skewer of steak. Nothing fancy. It was cook just right and seasoned. 

As we were being served our first round of steak our waitress had returned with salad and a few sides. The sides were fried plantains, beans, and dirty rice. Those were ok. She also gave a garlic dipping sauce that I loved. It composed of fresh minced garlic with oil and some sort of vinegar and other spices. Very garlicky with a bit of tang. It went great with the steak. 

The next rounds of meats were two different chickens, sausage, another steak with some sort of sweet seasoning on it. One of the chickens was quite dry. The sausage was not appealing to me at all. It was a texture thing. It was grainy. Of all the meats I liked the sweet steak the most. It was very tender and something about the hint of sweetness with the tangy garlic herb sauce capitivated my tastebuds. 

I've been to other Brazilian buffets. They were better than this one. I was teetering between two or three stars given the food was really hit or miss. The service eas good and I did like some items so I gave them a 3, but I doubt I would be coming back.

We were never without a full glass of water and as soon as we could finish one beer they were asking if we wanted another.  The meat servers were also friendly and explained what each item was.  They listened when you asked for a small piece, or more of this, less of that.  The service was great.

My boyfriend, an extremely picky eater, only had one complaint and that was that the steak was too pink for him.

My family has visited many Brazilian steakhouses in the past and this one was definitely right on par.  I have not eaten at the other places mentioned in previous reviews so I cannot compare, but I thought this place was good.",Iy-NYLMmvGNPdLqUNEZihA,1,0,4,u--uR8Y6bZp0XVXfTxOoOg
3415373,2012-06-05,0,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"This was very unique/different dining experience I had ever had. Depending what you order the all you can eat is the most popular item on the menu. It really means all you can eat meat, but not all you can eat side dishes it includes. 

  The bread they gave us was different. It looked like small mini biscuits topped with cheese, even though it was small it's pretty satisfying. Also came with round thick crackers, which I wasn't so crazy about. It came with two different sauces. First one looked like salsa, but tasting it had a entirely different flavor with a kick of black pepper that made it really good. I liked the 2nd sauce that contained a lot of oil, spices and garlic especially. As for the salad part, I was told that a traditional Brazilian steakhouse usually comes with an all you can eat salad bar. Apparently I was disappointed that they only had pre tossed salad, and was really looking forward to the all you can eat salad buffet. Pre tossed salad was alright, it was creamy but a little bit bland to my taste. 

For the all-you-can-eat-meat part this is what I tried:
Sausages- this was the highlight out of all the meats I tried. Inside wasn't so packed,
                     but it was so flavorful and ended up getting 2nds afterwards.
Top Sirloin- It had a great flavor to it and was cooked to medium rare. I thought it 
                      could've been a little bit more rare, but the seasoning on the top made
                      up for it.
Turkey Wrapped Bacon- It was alright, turkey was lean and tasted well with the 
                                             bacon.
Chicken drumstick- I really liked how well marinated it was, not only from the outside
                                    of the chicken but the inside as well. For every bite you tasted,
                                    it always had so much flavor. It is really tender as well.
Garlic Bread- yes  grilled garlic bread! this was my 2nd favorite! the bread was soft
                        not hard at all.

As for the side dishes it included, out of all I loved the plantains! it was sweet and glazed with some syrupy sauce. Creamy spinach reminded me a lot like spinach souffle, but it tastes entirely different and much creamier. Glazed carrots was new for me, it was sweet and almost tasted like candied yams. Black beans and Rice was so-so, and a little bland. 

Service I have to agree with everyone on here, it's really SLOW. You have to sorta plan ahead if you want faster service. The waitress however is really nice, she really took care of us. Only bummer is that this restaurant is an open area, a few steps away from the slots so don't bother with having a quiet conversation here.",N7_pqBgMqV5IPZk0018vIQ,0,0,4,6aPP6RzrUFWY2bRKUUXSeg

We started out with a steak that we were assured was cooked medium to medium-rare which was chewy and dry. We moved onto another steak which was in the same state as the former.
When offered the lamb we each took a piece, but when my wife informed me that it was gamey, I opted not to even try it. The follow pork and pineapple was unsatisfactory as the pineapple was devoid of flavor and the pork was unbelievably dry. At this point our wine, guess how THAT was, that we ordered at the beginning of the meal arrived. By now I had had enough. My wife held out hope that the sausage that they were serving would meet our expectations. It did not. We asked to see a manager regarding our situation and she had the gall to offer us MORE meats. When we declined, she offered to take 30% off our meal, which they did, thankfully. However, we both agree that the only way I could afford Samba more than a single star would've been to take off one of the $45 meals.

We were sat down around 7:45 or so, so not bad. Now, I am a HUGE Ipanema fan in the downtown Seattle area, so I figured I would LOVE this place as well. Anytime Rodizio is offered with high quality meats and sides makes me salivate in thought.

We sat down and told the waiter we were going to do the rodizio option. They left but didn't fill our waters for about 10 minutes. Now walking around in the Vegas sun we were really thirsty so this was rather annoying. Once they came back we started our first course which was a salad. This salad was pretty good as it contained garbanzo beans, olives, and many more different types of veggies. So far, we had been impressed. Now they brought our sides out which was different than Ipanema. The sides are served family style at your table so you don't have to get up to get them (we probably needed the walking). 

Now our first meats were very tasty but one thing really screwed this up. Our waitor/host didn't tell us about the red/green ""salt-shaker"" kind of thing that tells the meat deliverers whether we are done or not. Now I am a Rodizio veteran and normally know how this works but never had seen it in this form/didn't notice it on the table by the other tools. So basically, we hadn't had any meats for about 10-15 minutes and all of our sides had gotten cold. This was pretty dissapointing, as the waiter did not tell us about this.

Now if we had done this right I probably would give another star or so, but the experience wasn't as enjoyable as it should have been.

My favorites were the turkey and the pork (I forgot what they were called but that what I can remember off hand).  It was only $31 back then, not sure how much it costs now but I can imagine it costing a whole lot more.  At that price though, for the large amount of meat we consumed, it was worth every dollar.

Who thinks that walking into a steakhouse between two large bananas........ located just off the casino floor .......
is going to provide a gourmet brazilian experience????
It is the typical Vegas ""over the top""  - ""over blown"" dining experience.

Comparing the Samba to a traditional Churrascaria experience -
is like comparing ""Phantom of the Opera"" on Broadway to the Vegas production. 
The Vegas production is great - but it is a ""VEGAS production."" 
The Samba is fun but it is not really Churrascaria either ........
it is the Vegasized version ......

I love meat 
and this place provides you all the meat you can handle.

The side dishes are ""interesting"" - but they should not take you away from the real reason you are here - the meat.

The drink selections are supurb ..... second only to the meat ! !

Andrew says ""sure"" and immediately pulls out his drivers license clearly stating he is not twenty one........
Waiter says thanks and brings him the drink .....

The price seems right for an evening of dining enjoyment.
The one thing that does surprise me is how you seem to be removed from the casino atmosphere when you are dining ....... even though the gaming is taking place only a short distance away.

The bananas at the door should give you a clue

For those of you not aware, it's all you can eat 'steak' house where they bring the entrees to your table. Basically you get a couple of sides (rice & beans, I think) and a little colored indicator. When you want them to bring more meat, you turn the indicator to green, to stop, red. Anyway, there were lots of types of meats that they bring by. Some examples were: steak, bacon wrapped chicken, ribs, and sausage. There are many more, and the variety varies each trip. All meats were cooked properly and hot. As with most Vegas restaurants: the place was empty but we were told to make reservations. Anyway, the staff were excellent and explained the style very well to us, being our first trip. We had a pitcher of caipirinha, which is similar to a margarita or mojita (sans mint.) It's made with cachaca, which tastes like a cross between rum and tequila. Anyway, the food was good. It's a bit pricey, around $40 a person, just for the rodizio style meal, no drinks. I personally find it to be an exceptional value, because of the quality and quantity of food. However, if you are not a big eater, this is probably not the place for you. Also, remember that alcohol has a filling feeling effect on your stomach too.

Convenient since I was staying at the Mirage, but next time we'll venture out a bit.  When you go to Fogo De Chao they have a lot more selection of meats.  Samba has about 7 or 8 different items and they're all kind of ""warmed up"" tasting, meaning they have been cooked, brought out....reheated and served again which fine as long as it doesn't taste that way, if that makes sense.  The meat for the most part was unseasoned and needed something to kick it up a notch on the flavor.
The salad was terrible, and the creamed spinach again, was not seasoned at all.  We're in Las Vegas and there's a great restaurant within 100 feet of wherever you are, most likely.  Go somewhere else.",-rlIN1BFK65MyHWt_HhPJg,1,0,2,hvevxbOkIKf4ugFDc5Tknw

Samba is a nice place to go, but in my opinion, simply not worth the price of admission. 
My wife and I ordered the all you can eat. The food is okay, but after a while everything seems to taste the same.. when the chicken tasted like the sausage and the sausage tasted like the chicken it just seemed weird, but when the bacon wrapped turkey tasted nothing like bacon I knew I was not a fan of all of the meats. The dinner comes with bread which had great dipping sauces, but the side dishes were not that great. regular white rice and beans, veggies, and plantanes (which for some reason tasted like they were cherry glazed)... then the waiters keep coming to your table and bringing meat after meat... and then stop. There is no continued service, the waiter actually comes to your table and asks... ""So there is something else you'd like.. some meat I can bring""... then you tell him which one you'd like... instead of the guys continuing to come. I thought that was kind of weird, I've been to two of these places before. The greenfield in West Covina CA, and another one in Cancun Mexico which was part of an all inclusive resort... and both were way better than this place. I would have liked to have a salad bar or something to mix in with the meats... its kind of forced having to ask for more veggies... and the part where they stopped bringing meats was a little strange. If I pay for an all you can eat, and you made a little speech about keep this on green and we will continue to bring meat after meat... but then you stop even if its on green... just seems weird. The meat all tasted similar except for the sirloin, which was very tasty... then came the dessert. 
My wife ordered two ice cream shots and I ordered one, when the waiter brought them he brought them on a tray, and asked which we would like... we did not see they were 2.99 each... until the bill came. Very pricy for half filled shot glasses with ice cream.

Total was about 120. Two dinners, one soda, 3 ice cream shots.
The meat was not great, not plentyfil, and took a while to arrive.
The sides were very plain...

Seems like there are sooooo many other options on how to spend 120 bucks in Vegas on dinner. We were looking for a nice experience, but feel like this was the low point of our whole weekend. Simply not worth it.",4GfN4puozS4LddBNErwbAg,1,0,1,upMErq21eaHhkXFnDSrmvw

My dad and I had originally wanted to go to the Italian place that's also in the Mirage, but it was closed in Sunday, which is totally legit ANYWHERE ELSE, so we picked Samba instead. It seems like most restaurants within resorts have the same kind of design and structure as if they were truly street side, but not this place. It's kind of plunked down on a slightly raised level on the casino floor, which really can go either way. You hear and feel the energy and excitement of your surroundings, but sometimes you just want to focus on your dinner. 

The decor is kind of like a Cirque Du Soleil meets Denny's. A little cheesy and tacky, but not in a way that distracts you.

We all ordered the all-you-can-eat (of course..., that should really be the only option for anybody). As they walked around with the food, there were only 1 or 2 options that I didn't really care for because it was a bit dry for my tasting or too salty; however, the rest were fantastic! The lamb was my favorite, and I loved how their medium-rare steak was actually medium-rare! Melts right in your mouth (:  The side dishes are also key factors: the rice and beans, sweet potato, etc... reminds me of Korean-style dining where the side dishes can be constantly refilled and they certainly add a great variety to dinner. 

Overall, I recommend this place. I will be trying more Brazilian steakhouses throughout the city that are perhaps more reasonably priced... but I can't bash on Samba for being a tad on the $$ side because it's located in a casino on the strip.

Luis was never around to be found, and our requests took so long in coming to us.  The restaurant itself was about a quarter full so it wasn't like they were smashed with people.

A few people on our table had a pitcher of the Brazilian Punch ($55), and said it was ""ok.""  

I'm not sure if the unfortunate thing was that the group had dinner at Heritage Steakhouse the night before, and was thoroughly impressed with the food and service there, but this experience was lacking.  The manager came around once, not very concerned.

After looking at the menu I decided to order the meat dinner. 

The meat came out cold numerous times. After trying over 7 different meats, all of them came out cold. As I asked the server do you have any warm meat? The server said I will make sure you get warm meat. Sure enough the meat came out cold every single time. Then the salad comes out with several appetizers that where okay.

Not one time did the manager ever come over and ask if I wanted to try something else. The service was the only positive outcome for the hole meal. I got to the point that I walked out. As I was not able to eat any meats. Would I come back again. The answer is no. I was very disappointed.",fRJpK_b0rrjpBgRZjvfvgA,57,49,2,9oF9uVeuLti5nc9BtB_XVA

It's a wonderful place to dine, especially before or after a show (the LOVE theater is right around the corner from the restaurant) and even if you're not going to the show if you like to people watch it's great too because it's open to the casino floor.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (well, two connected reasons) is that it is, in fact, open to the casino floor, which means that smoke can drift in on occasion. The air filter system in the casino is pretty good as far as those go and there is of course no smoking in the restaurant itself but if you're hyper allergic like I am, and want to enjoy eating here, sit away from the edges.

First of the all, the service was excellent, water and ice tea consistently filled, food came in an orderly fashion and promptly.  My waiter, Juan explained the dishes in menu and was very helpful.

After looking the menu, I didn't choose the Rodizio buffet, after a closer look reveals to be the source of the bad reviews.  Instead, I opted for the Brazilian version of seafood stew, the Moqueca ($36).

I was extremely surprised the amount of high quality seafood that comes with this dish.  You get generous portions of Chilean Sea Bass filet, large 16/20 shrimp, along with clams, mussels, snow crab legs, and scallops.  The coconut broth is very tasty which absorbs all of the seafood flavor.  This stew also includes tomatoes and kale.  The seafood was cooked right.

This price special did not include their seafood and filet mignon option.  Came with all their other cuts of meat and sides, which were black beans, rice, veggies, and plantains.

What's Hot
- Quality of food.  My group and I liked their bacon wrapped meat the best.  I think it's turkey?  Their sausage option is good, too.  My group liked their grilled pineapple the best!  If we could just get a whole grilled pineapple, that would've been awesome.  All their meats are tender.  The thing that sucks is that their meats are not all the same inside.  For example, some are lil more pink on the inside, which we preferred.
- Portions.  Good portions.  Their staff are attentive and ensure that you get to taste all their meats.  

What's Not
- Don't get their pork, which goes with their grilled pineapple.  It's dry.  Everyone in my group thought the pork was too dry.
- Their chicken still has the bone.  None of us at the table knew their chicken still had the bone.  It made it difficult to cut into and then eat.  It's not very user friendly, especially when you don't know it's in there.
- Their side options.  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouse restaurants where their sides were open in a salad bar layout.  Samba does specific side dishes and that's it.  You don't have additional options.  I don't like that.  I like having options.

As I looked to the right, I saw a half circle  with a bar top facing me.  A cook was standing behind it and there was two grills behind him, where all of the bbq is cooked.  Above the grills were metal vented racks, where the large skewers of meat were resting/keeping warm.  This was the first sign that the meat could be dried out and have been sitting for awhile.

Most of us at the table ordered the Rodizio, which is the all you can eat bbq that comes out on the large skewers.  This meal came with rice, beans, fried plantains and cooked carrots.  The beans and rice were not flavorfull, but cooked well.  The meat started coming out and we sampled all of them (chicken, turkey, ham, steaks and so on).

This third time around in Vegas I was expecting to eat well. However I've been disappointed with the restaurants with a lot of hype, Mesa Grill and Bellagio Buffet, that weren't that great. On my final night, which was last night, I ate here for dinner before the Cirque du Soleil Beatles' Love. Since the World Cup this year is in Brazil why not have my final dinner at a Brazilian steakhouse. I ordered the rodizio menu, which is all you can eat meat that is served in a spit rod. My rating is solely based on the rodizio menu. The first time I went to a Brazilian steakhouse and ordered the rodizio menu was at Pampas in Palo Alto. So I have some comparison to make. The highlights were the tender flank steak, moist lamb leg, and juicy sirloin. I also like the condiments of rice and beans and chimichurri sauce, which is a sauce originated in Argentina. The chimichurri sauce is great with the sirloin, flank steak, and lamb. The only dish I didn't like was the pork as I was it was dry and stringy. I won't say it as regret, but since I ate at the Bellagio Buffet the night before I didn't eat as much as I did at Samba. The value of ordering the rodizio menu is better than ordering just a steak as you get different varieties of meat. 

However the rodizio menu at Samba isn't up to par to Pampas in Palo Alto. That might not be fair to make a comparison however a trip to Vegas is already expensive enough. With the amount of money you're going to spend while at Vegas I think the comparison is fair. There were more steak varieties at Pampas while at Samba there were only two kinds - sirloin and flank. In addition the flank steak at Pampas just melts in your mouth. Also one exotic item that was served at Pampas chicken hearts was not available at Samba. Overall even though I gave the same rating Samba like I did for Mesa Grill and Bellagio Buffet, the rodizio menu at Samba was the best meal I had during this Vegas trip.",4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,1,2,3,MeFNA4OHGZvGtPVIZtH_Cw

Samba's dining room half moons into the end of the casino near the Beatles bar, right near the poker table games, near the guest elevators. It's elevated a bit and not smokey if that is a concern. 

We all ordered the Rodizio and house salad. The salad was delightfully chilled to perfection, with an amazing house dressing. Perfectly dressed, I became excited. I mean, the salad is really incredible. 

The selection of meats presented to us were fantastic, everything super tasty and perfectly cooked.  The turkey shined, but I kept going back for the steak. The sides are the basic moves for a brasil inspired steakhouse on the Las Vegas strip, but you know what? They were all awesome. Nothing looked plopped into a last minute steamer or microwave, and they certainly didn't taste like that.

When Samba opened it was a trendy hard to get into joint, and I wasn't really into the menu. But I not only gave it a whirl, I loved it. And it's a fantastic bargain.  Super friendly, but attentive service. Extremely clean environ as well. If you get a table near the half moon, some pretty good people watching as well.

You'll leave stuffed here if you give it a chance. For those that imbibe, the raves about the drinks were endless.  

The food just keeps coming here, it's like a great summer bbq where a master is cooking all sorts of different things to try, fresh off the charcoal grill. 

It's really a 3 star destination, but I want to throw in the extra star for the overwhelming value. The ingredients from the salad to the plantains and the quality of steak (choice) plus whatever goes into that creamed spinach left all of us feeling like we found a modern day Vegas Bargain. The ingredients and execution were ON-- what more can you ask for??

Us foodie snobs loved this place. I can't wait to be back! 

Reservations: Not usually necessary.  If you have a tram pass, take it to Harrah's and cross the street. Dress is casual, but you won't feel out of place if you do it business casual.  Shorts and hats are okay, but they may make you take off that baseball cap.  Service: Warm, and fun, but not over the top (no ""flare"" worn by the staff)  Very clean.   Probably a fun place for teenagers early in the evening. Got a bit rowdy (in a good way) later in the evening when we ate, with everyone clamoring for the hustling meat runners.   Tee hee

Samba is a little more traditional Brazilian than RJ with their style of serving.  The meats quality amazingly is better and service was completely night and day.  

Quality of their meats were just so so as far as Brazilian goes, I am disappointed in the fact that there were not as many variety as other places.  Although more Brazilian places tries to offer a little more healthier meats like chicken, turkey, and even fish.  Samba only offered two chicken dish and they were not all that great.

While the hostesses were rude and the waitress was no where to be seen majority of the time, the lovely servers with their sticks of grilled meats were always out and about between tables.  They kindly gave us these red-and-green colored things to let them know when they can bother us with more meat and when to give us a break.  They seemed pretty oblivious to this though and just kept wandering by.  I really don't mind since they're really just showing off all they had to offer and there was a pretty good variety but everything was so ridiculously dry.

5837843,2014-08-28,4,yKPY_6w7HNb0QhA3DcxvPw,"For an an unusual experience during Restaurant Week, I, my wife, and two friends ventured out to the Mirage for a Brazilian rodizio churrasco dinner at Samba.  I walked inside the restaurant with an open mind, not knowing whether or not this would be a memorable meal.

The beginning was auspicious.  We were seated in a beautiful reserved booth with a view of the entire dining room and part of the outlying casino floor that the hostess called ""the best seats"" in the place.  Soon afterward, our server introduced himself and described the churrasco experience and ""green light, red light"" system by which to indicate if more cuts of  various meats were desired to be brought to the table, or to be held in abeyance for a time.  We then each informed our server that we were all interested in ordering the special Restaurant Week rodizio offering, and the presentations began.

Samba Salad was a very tasty complex salad including Garbanzo Beans, Beets, Hearts of Palm, Kalamata Olives, tomatoes, Feta Cheese, and of course field greens.  After being asked to indicate how much salad we wanted ladled on our plates, our wishes were honored to the letter.  But the rolls and other bread products set on the table were bland and not very flavorful.

Then we were brought side dishes of hard vegetables like Brussels Sprouts & Carrots,  good Black Beans, and very good sweet Plantains, along with some Pico de Gallo and a kicky sauce of minced garlic in an oily foundation for spicing up the meats to come.  In fact, because various cuts of beef were mostly bland, the garlic sauce did improve the taste of these entrees.  

In no particular order, we were brought two types of Top Sirloin and Flank Steak, Garlic Toast, Chicken Legs, Roasted Pork & Pineapple, slices of lamb, sausage & Sweet Peppers, and well-received hunks of Brushed Turkey Breast Roulade wrapped in tangy bacon, which was Diane's and my personal favorite.         

Included dessert consisted of a selection of small but rich and interesting parfaits, including Mocha Cinnamon with Chocolate Mousse.  After I often forgot to put on the brakes with a red light, the skewered meats kept coming, and we hardly needed these refreshing meal enders.  

This restaurant without walls reflected a very nice colorful South American ambiance, with very comfortable seating.  And service was very good: both proactive in refilling water glasses, and responsive to diners' requests for more specific food items.

Other Brazilian steak houses have an AMAZING salad bar. This place doesn't even have one. You have the option of getting the all-you-can-eat meat or a regular meal (for about the same price). Get get the same sides no matter which one you choose (it's a lot of food). We didn't go with the all-you-can-eat surprisingly...because it didn't look that good from what we saw.
