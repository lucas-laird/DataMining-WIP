50449,2016-05-16,0,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. DECEIVING PRICES and less than mediocre food! The menu board in the store and online CLEARLY states that the platters are ""Served with pita bread and one of our amazing sauces"" along with 2 sides, however after we ordered and sat down we realized we had been charged .25 cent for each of our sauces (the sauces that were supposed to be ""included""). When I asked the lady running the register why she had charged me the extra .25 for sauces, she told me it was MY fault for choosing a sauce (after she asked me which of the 3 sauces I would like). She told me ""I could have said no to a sauce...""(BUT WHY WOULD I IF IT'S INCLUDED IN THE PLATTER?) I told her it was very deceiving to her customers to include an item in a ""platter price"" and then charge extra for it. She then blamed the old owners for designing the menu board the wrong way. I told her she should then at least cover the ""and one of our amazing sauces"" part with tape OR inform the customers that they no longer offer the sauce in the platter price and those customers who want a sauce should be informed that there's an additional charge for it. Our meal for 2 came to $22.07 and over .50 cents worth of deception, a blame game, and gross food, we will never go back.",lHneAbejqAVPZKrMMaLUnw,5,1,1,zhzwTedVGcv6aKjQ4hS4-g

I got two skewers of chicken kabobs on top of a large portion of rice. The rice looked plain but when you add the lemon that they include to it, it is fire! The hummus was ok and the two pita rounds that they give you are plenty. 90% of the skewers were chicken. I like veggies so I was a little disappointed with the amount of them on the kabobs. I do wish the chicken and the hummus had more flavor but the rice made up for that. The service was great and they were fairly quick with my order. They even bring it out and hand it to you while you're seated.

The only thing truly Persian here is the attitude.

I wish this was a friendlier place. The food is ok. Not bad, not great. Has a clean Plebeian atmosphere.

The food is overpriced and they wont give you half rice and half salad with your meal, a standard in Los Angeles. No, you must eat 3 pounds of rice with your meal.

They are also super slow. If there is a line, you will wait!

The Kabob is a little undercooked. No caramelized meat here.

The staff does not know a lick of Farsi. So dont ask for ghormeh sabzi.

They dont have  most home made Persian dishes. 

Why cant they open up an authentic Persian restaurant here?

One more thing, they give you a pat of butter for your rice with the to-go dinner. However, they put it in the same box so if you have to go more then 100 feet before you eat, its melted all over your food. And the close very early.",3hVyRkXdi4eMHtUCz7XXLQ,0,0,2,iL9C05V-cagG8FJ3HD7pag

Their salad is made with cheap lettuce and a disgusting dressing. They can't do it because ""it's a free small salad"", well then why can't you exchange it for free small fries? The cheap fries from a bag you serve can't cost more than the salad. I'm not asking much, throw 6 fries on my plate and make a customer happy. 

The food is pretty good which keeps me coming back for more and is pretty reasonable. Don't go there expecting quick service though. Considering you order at a counter it shouldn't take as long as it does. 

The falafel is a little greasy and I am not even sure if they are homemade. Their hummus is good though. 

I can't account for any of the meat dishes as I am a vegetarian. I also have gotten great service from people who work there who are not the owners. Don't go in expecting to be treated nicely though, go for the cheap mediocre food.",zd1EpwQAHSW9hs-7TVN03A,2,0,3,w7kkWzddtZHcxZ7Bix3_qA

Everything tasted good, including the new cilantro sauce that I was encouraged to try at the register. Dolmas were served warm, the way I like them. Creamy house dressing on the salad is delish.

Suggestions for management: rice is in a cooker, salads and sides should be assembled and ready to go so that only the chicken needs to be made to order.

I tried the regular gyro with wheat pita bread.  On the side I chose hummus which also came with more of their pita bread. The gyro was smaller than other Greek/Mediterranean places but it was good.  They put the tzatziki sauce on the side which was good because I usually take most of it off. Their bread around the gyro and served with the hummus was a little thicker than usual.

It was obviously my first time, and the cashier was happy to answer my questions and tried his best to describe the rice to me. I should have asked for a sample but I digress.

I ordered the Gyro combo plate, which comes with fries and a fountain drink. I should have ordered an extra side of salad (which comes with the regular gyro wrap, but is replaced by fries in the combo), because the wrap was brimming with delicious meat but could have used more onion and tomato (I like a little more crunch in my gyros). I was also happy that the pita bread was as good as other Yelpers described. You can tell it's fresh. I would have tried the hummus or babaganoush, but was afraid the portion would have been too big for one when followed by a gyro.

Overall, solid place, but definitely wouldn't drive past Yassou! to get here.

Friendly Staff
Good Gyros

I've had this place quite a bit..and I enjoy it every time.  I especially love the tzatziki sauce.  

I actually had my first gyro experience unbeknownst to me that it was in fact lamb.  I forgot that I wanted a beef gyro instead... and ended up with the lamb.   Though I don't want to knock it, it was delicious... but lamb texture is not what I'm used to.  For some reason I was a little queasy, which I'd like to say now that I'm sure it was just me... and not the food.  I enjoyed it!  But there was just something unsettling about eating lamb.  ... but that's just me.  

Second time around I had the single ground beef kabob and it was delicious!  I had it with rice, pita bread, & grilled onion and tomato... Love this and had  it a couple other times following...

I've also had a beef wrap which I very much enjoy... but not as much as the ground beef kabob with the rice.. 

Again, I love the tzatziki sauce... with EVERYTHING and not just the salad.

We had been there probably 45 mins eating (we also got desert/baklava), and were just getting up to leave, and a man from the back came and took our plates and we thanked him for the great food. He said something like ""thank you and since you're a little loud, maybe it's time for you to go, since we have other customers that may be bothered."" He said this without making eye contact, then basically faded into the back again. We all looked at each other like ""did he really just say that?""

Bright side is, I crave delicious Greek eats often so there will be future opportunities for me to try and capture the tastiness in a photograph.

Our first visit was when they had just opened and so it's been a while now.  I had the falafel wrap ($6.99) and the eggplant dip ($5.99) with a side of rice ($3.99).  My hubby had the falafel wrap ($6.99) and a grilled chicken wrap ($6.99).  Our order came up to about $30 after we received 10% off from checking in on Yelp.  When we walked in there was a group of 4 ladies eating dinner.  We overheard them talking about their food saying how good it was so we were very excited to get our food in hopes that it is better the second time around.  We ordered for take out.  The order took longer then the normal wait for the place to be empty but we were in no rush.  

After we received our order, we rushed home to eat.  The eggplant dip (Grilled seasoned eggplants blended with roasted tomatoes, eggs, and garlic sauce.) was served with warm pita bread was out of this world!  From what I remember of their baba ganoush...this is certainly much better as I didn't care much for the other (and I love just about every eggplant dish there is!).  I ate the dip with the pita and also on top of my side of rice.  The rice was also amazingly nice and fluffy; however very greasy from the looks of the bottom of the to go box.  It didn't stop me from inhaling all of the rice.  My wrap was filled with 3 good portions of falafel.  It was served with a side of salad (nothing special as it was just some ice berg lettuce thrown in the to go box).  There was also a side of Tahini sauce which went well on top of the wrap.  Will definitely be back!",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,3,0,3,_PanJMHC46-KpURih8ooiA

Your food is made or grilled fresh to order like home cooked meal!  I like this place alot because the food freshness, taste and consistency is always great and dependable. Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and the best bang for your buck. For apetizer try their Eggplant Salad which is a combination of grilled eggplant, tomato and a hint of garlic mashed together like baba ganoush or homus dips. You can enjoy it with Pita bread!  By the way, this dish is a special dish from the Caspian region and is called ""Mirza Gasemi"".  It tastes much better than homus and baba ganoush.

I had a gyro combo (there's a picture here somewhere!) to go. I'm pretty sure there were angels singing somewhere when I opened the box. There was a pile of fries, a small cup of ketchup (how thoughtful!), a big cup of tzatziki sauce (literally, about a cup of sauce) and the foil wrapped gyro. The gyro itself had tomato and onion slices, a bit of parsley and a heap of meat so big it didn't quite fit in the pita. That meat...mmmm. Perfectly spiced and sliced! The whole thing was huge and I snarfed it down with gusto!

Plenty of delicious food at the right price. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu. There are some very Mediterranean items on it, but this restaurant makes them seem completely accessible, rather than intimidating.",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,5,1,5,tBoKzqAVww1Q7IsgKWKZRg

The inside is VERY small, and there was nowhere to sit, we ended up having to share a table with another group of people we didn't know. Very tight/small arrangement. The inside was very clean though and well kept. Very bright and lively colors. 

The young lady at the check-in counter was friendly. And they bus your dishes for you, which is always an extra nice touch at these ""semi-fast"" type restaurants. 

The food...was overall just bland. The kabob was decently cooked but had no seasoning. Even the tzatziki sauce was super bland and underwhelming (something I normally inhale and smother all over everything). The falafels were probably the best part of the meal as they were still pretty moist on the inside. 

There are so many places in this area to get kabobs, and I just can't justify returning for the bland flavors.",xFSLb_pxXta5G4oaRB1ylQ,7,6,3,MHxX6EkYKUHwV6aTrF0m4g

 I asked about the long wait and at that point the manager had just then told me about the mix-up so he offered to comp my meal which I thought was a good way to handle the situation. He was very apologetic and sincere in the way he handled this. That's about all one can ask for when something like that happens. 

I got a beef tenderloin wrap and their chicken wings and rice. The meat in the wrap is tender and cooked right with good flavor. The chicken wings I liked they had flavor all the way through from whatever they marinate them in. Both dishes I got I would order again. I also tried the hummus and pita bread which was really good as well. Great meal overall I was very pleased. Without the comp it would have cost about $23 for this meal.

I questioned the guy behind the counter, he confirmed it, I asked if the salads were from a pre mix bag, because that's what I'm thinking now, he said no they make them, then the dressing is a creamy house dressing? Huh? He saw the disappointment on my face. How can you call it a Greek salad? So I went with the beef tenderloin kabob, it was ok, saffron rice was good, that's how they got bumped from 2 stars to 3.

The family that owns it is amazing and so friendly. Not to mention they keep the dining area clean as can be. I love Persian food, Mediterranean food of all kinds, but this place is top knotch.

I saw a free appetizer with yelp check in (obviously with a purchase of an entree). My friend and I decided since we were getting a free appetizer, we might as well share the entree. We opted for the hummus and the chicken kabob plate. The hummus was smooth, rich and tasty. I added their flavorful olive oil to it, which made it even more amazing. The pita bread that it was served with was warm, thick and soft. I could have made that a meal in itself, but alas I ran out of pita bread :( The chicken kabob plate arrived and I'm glad we decided to split it. The meat was tender. The rice cooked perfectly. And it came with tomatoes and onions!!!! I was freaking ecstatic over the onions. I'm glad we picked this place.

My wife and I just went there after not having been there for quite a few months and we were very disappointed. The kabobs that we loved so much were now very bland. As far as we could tell, they were completely unseasoned. 

Also when I asked for a soft drink, the woman (who I believe to be an owner) didn't bother mentioning that every flavor except for a couple were out of order. Of course things happen and things breakdown. But you should at least warn your clients that you have very limited drink options when they order a drink.

The tzatziki sauce was also bland and not what it used to be. Neither of us liked the new salad dressing either.

While we were there another customer had to ask them to cook the chicken more thoroughly.

3391551,2014-08-30,1,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"Well it's friday before labor day and we tried out The Kabob Grill for the first time. I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a table, but to our surprise we were the only ones in the place at 6:30 on a friday night! We placed our order and as we waited for our dinner, there was plenty of phone orders and people coming in for take out (some taking out 4 to 5 bags full of food!). The place is nice and clean, with nice mellow music playing in the background. There is one TV with a college football game on, so if you need to watch something important, they can probably change the channel for you. I was glad to get a seat in there and I keep comparing the place to another Greek place that we always go to and that place is near impossible to get a table unless you are lucky, but enough of that because this is some place else. The good thing is the food is really good and fresh! I had the chicken kabob dinner and Lana had the beef, since each comes with two each, we got to trade so we could try a taste of both. Greek salad was good, french fries were perfectly cooked and the rice pilaf was very nice and light. Pita bread is excellent and in small half circles that I have never seen before. Hummus and Babaganosh was just like Mama used to make (ha ha!). Dine in food is served on attractive red plates and presentation was a step up from the norm which is refreshing for a simple place. Do a ""check-in"" and they will comp you your soft drinks. The price per person is about $10 each and the portions of meat a just a tiny bit smaller than we are used to, but if you are not a huge appetite person the entrees are just right. The sides and pita bread rounds out the meal very nicely so there is plenty to keep you satisfied. Hmmm? this was our first time and we hardly ever have dessert, but I don't remember seeing that offered on the menu, but I could have overlooked it.
One word of caution though, if you order fries there is a area where you get your utensils, salt and pepper and such; well the red plastic squeeze bottles are not ketchup, it's tabasco sauce! No big deal though, I didn't put that much on my french fries before I figured out the watery ketchup is hot sauce. South Eastern Ave sure has alot of restaurants and it seems this area close to Big-5 sporting goods is one of our favorite spots. Good Indian food, Great Crepes and now Greek!",rn2DB_YX0BvToYe50RNr_Q,2,1,5,6na06KZd1k9fIiSPj1aiyA

3502226,2016-04-21,0,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"Eat here while you can.

Signs are pointing to imminent closure -- which is unfortunate. I'd love to give a 5-star review, but with some of the changes going on, I just can't. 

1- Closed on Sundays now. 
2- Sauces with entrees are no longer free. What used to be included with a plate meal, is now $0.25.
3- Portion sizes have been reduced. The kabobs are smaller, the protein portions are smaller, even the TWO DOLLAR soft drink has been reduced. It was probably 24 oz before. It's half. 

The food is great. It's fresh and the flavor is a bit on the mild side for my liking, but it really is a smart decision after going to the gym. However, with these changes I'm afraid quality is the next thing to be sacrificed. 

First rule of business -- when you need to save money, don't do it in a way that affects your customers. Cut your operating expenses elsewhere. Closing on Sunday was probably a smart move if it's not a profitable day. But charging for a small cup of a sauce and reducing fountain drink cups is irritating -- especially since you're not doing anything to increase the value of my meal elsewhere. But cutting down the portion sizes is where I have to draw the line. This decision is directly impacting the value of what I'm getting for my money. The cuts that have been made here have caused me to stop coming entirely. I'm writing this review waiting for my last meal to be served.

I'm sorry it has to end like this. But we just have to part ways. So really, your cost saving measures are backfiring on you. You're losing customers. 

So let's take a look around and see what we can come up with?

Napkins -- I just watched a guy take an entire fistful. He doesn't need all of those and there's a lot of waste there. Pull a subway and give 2 when you bring the food -- more if I ask. 

Lemons and peppers by the water -- How much of that are you throwing out every day because they go unused? You seriously don't need that many lemons. 

Plates -- They look great, but how much does it cost you to wash these? You could probably find disposable plates that look elegant enough to be under your food at a lower cost. 

POS -- Fancy credit card terminal you've got there. Do you know how much you're paying for processing though? Might want to shop around. You can always find a better deal. 

TV -- Cut the cable. It's always on mute anyway. I barely notice it. Get an appletv box and stream entertainment if it is that important to your staff and customers.

ADVERTISE -- For the love of everything, you need to advertise more. Take samples and coupons to the local gyms. You're sandwiched between 2 EoS Fitness gyms and the guys and gals that lift there would love to know about you and your food. 

Loyalty Programs -- Find a way to reward your customers and entice new ones. RewardsNetwork and Epoxy are two of my favorites. RewardsNetwork pays me in airline miles for dining with participating restaurants. It's the first place I check when I'm hungry and want something new. Epoxy is a mobile app where you can provide customized loyalty cards and rewards. 

Hope this helps you return to the glory you once had. Good luck to you. If you're still around in a few months, I might check back in.",EJ_DLpMFMlvXMQ2KGgMYIQ,6,0,1,57pHL_3CjE2V3LPC-T6iMg

I use to love coming here for a quick meal, but the last 3 times I came I definitely noticed the changes immediately.

2. Charges for sauce

4. Food is not as tasty 
- spicy chicken is now just being served as I would assume is their normal chicken kabobs .
- they changed the rice & I hate it 
- sauce has become bland

Counter service was friendly, but the food was extremely slow. Despite the restaurant being less than half-full, it took nearly 20 minutes for us to receive our food. Felt weird for a place with counter service. Good thing we had the TV.

Food was also rather expensive relative to portion size. Shish kebab was mostly peppers/onions and then just four thin slices of meat, and the accompanying salad and pita were very small. At least the food itself was well-prepared and tasty.

Ultimately this feels like a place that wants to cut costs by offering limited service and small portions like a budget spot, but wants to price items and have slow service as if it's a nicer sit-down place.

My steak was dry, the saffron rice recipe has changed and tastes nothing like it use to. Different salad dressing, which was the only change that I sort of enjoyed as it was refreshing and light but I still would have liked the old Iranian style yogurt/ketchup recipe they would give me. They forgot my hummus, which would have never happened with the old owners. Now they are skimping by not putting bell peppers and onions in between each piece of chicken, really? Peppers and onions are so cheap! The pita bread was not as soft either and hard on the edges like it sat out too long. The chicken flavor and the fries seemed to be the only thing that remained the same.

This place will not last since all the regulars that come here expect the SAME EXACT FOOD they have been eating forever. I personally have been there dozens of times and I have always received the best service and food and they were always so consistent.

The gyro wrap I got was generously loaded with seasoned meat with fresh tomatoes, onions, and lettuce, all wrapped up in pita bread that was soft and warm. The tzaziki had such an awesome flavor, I'm glad I ordered extra since I ended up dipping everything in it. I ordered the fries well done and they came out extra crispy with some flavorful seasoning on it.

We also split a chicken kabob plate. The chicken was moist, tender, and had good flavor. The onions and peppers were grilled perfectly while still being crisp. The accompanying salad was filled with fresh and crisp vegetables. 

We had to wait a little bit to receive our food, but I didn't care. I'm willing to wait a little more for freshly made and awesome tasting food. Everything came out correct, hot, and fresh.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,4,Db-fa7RMgTHSko4BGeUBpw

5390384,2012-08-06,1,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"I've ordered Kabob Grill from Eat24Hours.com a few times on Sundays when I was feeling exceptionally lazy (if laziness was an Olympic event, on any given Sunday I'd be the Usain Bolt of it).   I love that it provides a delivery option in my area that isn't pizza or chinese/thai, though I have mad love for both of those options.   Respect due to pizza hut.   Anyway, the thought of hot and fresh gyro meat and falafel balls being delivered to my doorstep as I sit on my bed unshowered watching reruns of No Reservations sends me into euphoria.  

On this day I had a $5 off coupon emailed to me from Eat24Hours which made it all even more appealing, and I ordered some falafel appetizers, a gyro salad, and chicken soltani, which consists of a chicken kabob along with a piece of kabob koobideh, which is a skewered minced meat kabob, all on top of a heaping of basmati rice.  Delivery was estimated to happen between 45 and 60 minutes, and I was happy when a delivery driver from Kabob Grill rang my doorbell 30 minutes later.  The first item I tried was the falafel.   I found it to be a nice version of one of my favorite foods, though texture-wise it was a little different than I'm used to as I could still make out little pieces of chopped up carrots within the fried outer shell.  It wasn't off-putting in the least, but I do slightly prefer a uniform texture throughout that I'm used to.  Next I tried the Gyro Salad, and while the gyro meat was plentiful and tasty, I was a little disappointed that there was no feta cheese.  Now I must say the menu doesn't mention feta so there shouldn't be any expectation of feta from me in that sense... no, I take it back, I WANT FETA!   The veggies seemed fresh and crisp and overall I was pleased otherwise.   Lastly to the Chicken Soltani.  The pieces of chicken skewer were large, moist and flavorful, which is about all you can ask for from chicken in my opinion.   The koobideh kabob also had a great flavor to it, and I enjoyed stuffing a piece of pita with rice and one meat or the other and some veggies.   This actually brings me to my biggest disappointment of the entire order (feta notwithstanding).   There were only 2 pieces of pita provided with this meal!  I don't mean two large pieces either, I'm talking two small triangles that would normally last 20 seconds in any given mediterranean restaurant I might dine in.  Instead I found myself rationing them out like I was stranded on a desert island.  Maybe I'm used to being spoiled with Pita from Hedary's, but  I felt like there should be some extra considering the amount of food ordered.

When it's all said and done, I can highly recommend Kabob Grill to satisfy your delivery (and probably take out/dine-in) cravings, though you might want to have some feta in the fridge and order an extra side of pitas to make yours a 5 star experience.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,1,4,cmlu0EoA3bLE3C1HVufXJA

The good parts about the food:
The HUMMUS is amazing, and so is the pitas they give with it.
The yogurt dip is fantastic, I could just eat that and be happy.

Stuff I didn't like:
-The falafel was just ok. Kinda too thick and soggy in side, I like mine a little more crisp.
-My dad hated the grape leaves, he couldn't not figure out what was inside. Some kinda of quinoa  grain. Idk. He didn't eat it, I felt bad, I didn't think it was bad.
-So I got the falafel gyro, and instead of their wonderful pita , they serve this horrible over cooked, too thick weird cracker crust thing... I was like wtf is this? I want pita bread not dry cracker. It ruined everything. Had a ton of left over cracker bread, cause I picked it off... Makes the meal dry and over carbed.

They're RUDE, especially the lady. They want to pass their cheap ingredients off as authentic. They use *fake* basmati rice and they use FOOD COLORING in place of saffron! They're not fooling anybody. Today, I was served RAW, BLOODY chicken. I decided to just leave it alone, walk out, and never go back. 

Such a shame. The food used to be SO delicious here and made from the heart. Then the owner sold it to these inexperienced people and this place went to hell. Don't waste your money.",FNT65-MXWQIAuh7vzuwKWQ,10,1,1,XB-LUD2gXbpUwUxNfoNPAA

5878430,2015-11-26,1,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"When we think of Mediterranean, we automatically think of Kabob Grill.  They have pretty standard prices, but when they have their deal via text, we usually make it point to patron there during the deal days.  .

The large platter- comes with 2 skewers and 3 sides of your choice.  My favorite are the hummus, dolmas (grape leaves), the falafels (come out hot and super flavorful and packs a punch), house salad, and babaganoush.  Their yellow rice is the house favorite and I usually opt-out for healthier options.  

Their gyros are pretty standard, a little on salty side, but always the same flavoring.  They're not lightly pan fried after being off the spit, which might give it crispy edges.
The shrimp is cooked well over open flame, buttery flavor and I love dipping it in their tzaziki sauce.  
The cubed steak is cooked medium, which seals in the flavor.  It's good tender meat and sure to satisfy the meat craving.
The chicken is always tender here and they never overcook it.  This is probably the healthier option compared to the gyro and buttered shrimp.  

It's a casual atmosphere, clean place to dine and we always come back here for Mediterranean food.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,5,3,4,7QkVgKaAlCovHvpludFsAA

I always make sure to be clear that I want tzatziki with my food. Once in a while they'll forget to put it in the bag, so my husband and I always check to make sure it's actually there. Tonight, for some reason, my husband decided to ask if the sauce was in the bag, rather than check. They said yes, but of course it wasn't. My husband was kind enough to drive back and get it for me. When he told the man at the counter that there wasn't any tzatziki in the bag, the guy got really defensive and started throwing a bunch of it in a bag. So why the two star rating? The guy made a mistake and, when confronted about it, got a bad attitude and acted like my husband was out of line asking for the sauce. In addition, the food quality has gone down. I'm really not enjoying the food as much as I used to.

On the plus side, I now have 10 things of tzatziki.",-3JFfPTQ4uk2wZuCKWVbNg,3,0,2,g-Tt8_O9fsZ8dVu5rVMpew

5918493,2010-08-26,0,BwuyBsShSQwO3_-SvW6fRA,"I was heading to Henderson for an appointment and in an adventurous mood while driving down S. Eastern Ave.  Along the way I looked around for cool places to check out, when the traffic has stopped at traffic lights and it was safe to do of course, for things to do and kind of planning my lunch for the day.

So my first stop was this tiny Asian market that also serves breakfast and boba drinks (it is just next door) and it didn't look too appealing to me.  So I walked next door to Kabob Grill, and reminiscing about the handful of great Persian restaurants I have been referred to try or been taken to in California.  The menu looks simple enough, and they have the basic kabob varieties you expect from a decent Persian restaurant, not to mention one that specializes in kabobs.  And they even have the ground beef kabob (Kabaabe Koobideh) that I prefer over most other items on the menu.  Lunch is already off to a good start!

So after debating if I should get their lunch special or just ordering the same Ground Beef in the Main Dishes section, I went with the Large Main Dishes version of Ground Beef (which is served with rice, onions, pita bread, butter and optional grilled tomato and two skewers of ground beef) at $9.99.  The lunch special version comes with just 1 skewer of meat (except the ""Soltani"" items, which serves two combinations of skewer meats), rice, salad, onions, pita bread and fountain drink with price ranging from $8.49 to $13.49. In general the Main Dishes items are a $1 more than their equivalent in the lunch specials.

I didn't bother to take pictures of the exterior or interior, thinking that other Yelpers surely have reviewed this place already.  So no photos, except the food I ordered.  But I will say that their display case is beautifully stocked with various canned and bottled beverages and some homemade pastries. The menu and the paint scheme on the wall matches, and utilizes the vibrant green, yellow and white colors.  The décor is simple, with black marbled-top tables and matching black cushion chairs arranged around the average size dining area of the restaurant.

Anyway, service is okay. It is just another ""step up to the counter and order your food, wait for it to be prepared and pick it up at the counter when your number is called"" kind of fast casual food service operation. They greet you when you walk in, but not when you have finished your meal and walking out the door.

Food-wise, it looks good. And if you can drool and imagine just how wonderful it tastes just looking at pictures, then they would get 4-5 stars for ""food styling"".  But based on just trying one item out of the 13 they have available in their Main DIshes section of the menu, I would say this is a 3 stars (A-OK) at best.  My ground beef kabob was juicy (always a plus), but flavor and seasoning-wise it was just okay. Just like a McDonald's burger is okay, but not potentially awesome like the much more expensive gourmet burger from Burger Bar, and you are not paying all that much.

BUT I was disappointed that they did not served the ""optional"" grilled tomato, which is clearly shown in the sample photos for the items. I am not sure if you have to specify you want the ""optional"" grilled tomato, or they simply just don't have it (not likely, since they served sliced tomatoes in the salads I see others ordering) or forgot to put it on my plate.  And I have to say the juiciness and sweetness of the tomato really adds to the flavor profile of the dish, and helps cut the feeling of fattiness mouthfeel after consuming some of the kabob.

Value for the money -  2 stars compared to most restaurants in the fast casual category.  But Persian foods have always cost a little more at restaurants, so I guess 3 stars compared to other Persian kabob fast casual restaurants.

Interesting stuff (at least I think it is) - Kabob Burgers. Kabobs served with the onions, sliced tomato and a lettuce stuffed between burger buns.

They also have an interesting Appetizers and Salad menus. Babaganoush looks good in the picture.  And I want to try their inexpensive but still interesting Shirazy Salad (chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, parsley topped with lemon juice and olive oil for $3.99).
 
This is my first Yelp review of a Persian ""restaurant"" in Las Vegas, so I will give it a 3 stars. Par for the course to compare others to, otherwise it would be a 2 stars for not going above and beyond the bare minimal in service, food preparation and omitting item (I want that grilled tomato gosh darn it!) that should come with the food you order.
