We were all from the east coast, mostly new yorkers.  The food was off the charts.  We started with a few orders of apps and plates to share which were all delicious.  The place combined a southwest feel with some food that we could all relate to home - from mama's meatballs to the flat breads and everything in between.  The ambiance of the place was great - very mellow which was great for us to kick back and grab a meal, we were out there on a bachelor party and the place was great to just chill and enjoy some great food - not to mention the selection of booze is off the charts, which was good for our party and the place was crawling with tail.  Definitely a good experience and I would and will go back - as a tourist it was a great spot that was off the strip, away from the mayhem yet still in a classy good looking establishment that isn't going to pick your pockets.

We agreed we were all going to down the first drinks so we can get the next ones before they doubled in price. Only to be told that when she asked the bar manager Jessica , she said "" no"". We were still well within the time period. When the waitress came back it was two minutes after happy hour. We ordered $160.00 in food, it was fabulous. The service was undeniably outstanding. However, we will not be back because of Jessica. When I find someplace I like I am always loyal and would have return time and time again with my friends and family.

I asked if they could accommodate 20 to 30 people and seeing how the place was empty I didn't see why not. The hostess asked of we could sit outside which wasn't ideal since it was over 100 degrees and we were all dressed up. But we did anyways since we weren't given other options. At first We received great service and the drinks were great. Then as everyone came trickling in from the wedding our waitress seemed irritable. We ordered a round of drinks for everyone. 45 minutes later no drinks. So my sister (The Bride ) saw our drink order sitting at the bar getting warm so she kindly asked the waitress if she could grab the drinks for everyone. The Waitress then snapped at the Bride telling her "" No you may not, clearly I'm the only waitress here so you can wait."" needless to say many of our party left after the poor service and lack of their orders. Finally an hour later we got our bottled beers and mimosas. Paid and left. I will never be going back there again.

I first came in last month and I've been back five times since.

Either Jess or Jenna is always there, and when they are you can be assured you're in great hands.

I think I've tried every item on the happy hour menu, and been to brunch here twice.  Also sampled several of the cheese plates.  It's the best brunch I've ever had in Vegas.  You MUST try the french toast.  It is incredible.

I love the decor and the ambiance here. I've been to this place in every type of attire you can think of...work uniform, dressy dress, yoga pants and a hoodie, jeans and a club shirt...every time they make you feel super comfortable and really take the time to show that they're happy you're there.  So come one, come all...try this place out.  I hope you love it as much as I do.

247488,2012-03-05,0,hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ,I feel like every time I come to Town Square lately I must make a stop here. I enjoy their happy hour and friendly bartenders. I have tried their small plates and for the happy hour price it is a tasty deal. I also really like their whiskey of the month. Although it has been Famous Grouse for over a month now it is still a fun way to try new whiskies. If you like wine they have a very nice selection without being too pretentious or snooty about their selection and pricing. If you like cigars the patio is a great spot to relax and have a cigar while sitting by the fire pit. I'll be back sooner than later.,Y9u9hcRGWzPC4yQ5nRHgtA,2,1,4,x08KXdQ8-QUitf-wc5a1ww
291786,2011-12-11,1,hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ,"So, Double Helix has popped up at Town Square after the demise of The Grape.  We recently ended up here for a night cap after a night out.

Pros: the decor is nice and upscale.  They also have a decent selection of whiskey and scotch, and offer various cocktails made with whiskey and scotch.  There's also a nice outside patio area with fire pits, or something to that effect.  While some crazy bastards were sitting out there at night, it's just a mite too chilly for me at 40-45 degrees right now.  I imagine, however, that it will be pleasant to hang out at in the spring/beginning of summer.  

Cons: it's expensive!  I can understand more expensive pricing for drinks containing premium whiskey or scotch.  But I ordered Irish coffee and it was $10.  Ten dollars for small cup of coffee with Bailey's in it? Give me a break!  There wasn't even a dollop of cream or anything fancy in it.

Adding insult to injury, once the bill came, I signed the receipt and placed it in the wallet in front of me on the table.  It's something I typically (and absentmindedly) do while my party and I wrap up and get ready to leave.  Well, our particular waitress came over, and without saying one peep, reached over me and my coffee, and grabbed the wallet.  (We were sitting at a bistro table and thus, were higher off the ground.)  

I've NEVER, EVER have had anyone do that to me before at a restaurant or bar -- big, small, fancy or shady.  Who does that???  I understand that it was late, and they may have needed to close the register.  But, it would have been proper to ask first before physically reaching over me.  Nope, not here.  Not even an ""excuse me"" or anything.  Nor were we the only or last people inside; in fact, there was still a good amount of patrons inside and out.  

I'm not a snob about service, nor do I have wildly unrealistic expectations.  I understand that people working in the service industry get busy, may be tired, have bad days, etc.  But this was simply discourteous and poor form.  Not cool, chick.       

I like the place itself and *may* give it another try.  But sadly, it was disappointing the first go around.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,5,1,2,yvs_D2i75ZdT3L2URbRrqQ

I come here occasionally when I'm looking for some awesome whiskey. I'm a big whiskey enthusiast and this is the only place in Vegas that i've found with such a great selection. They have over 50 different types of whiskey and the categorize it by region. If you ask about the different regions the bartenders are able to tell you the differences. 

The best thing about this place is they have a whiskey of the month that is half off during happy hour. This isn't like half off Jack Daniels, its high quality whiskey at a great price. They also have excellent food and a great happy hour (3:30-7!). It's more fine american dining type food and atmosphere. I highly recommend the Pork Sliders. The sauce is amazing!

The staff is great as well. I have been multiple times and never had any issues and they've always been very friendly.

538926,2012-03-29,0,hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ,"I had a VERY Jekyll and Hyde experience here in the same day. I was waiting for a friend and saw that their happy hour started at 3:30p, so I went inside. It was a Tuesday, so only a few people were there. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice glass of wine and had a very pleasant conversation with the bartender. She recommended that I stop back by later since happy hour ran till 7:30p, and advised that the food was really good. 

Around 7p, we were ready for dinner, so decided to swing back around to Double Helix. There was nobody at the hostess desk, nor a sign about whether to wait or seat yourself, so being a nice night, we ventured out to the patio. We sat there for HALF AN HOUR without a single acknowledgement from the server or busboy. No silverware, no drinks, no menus. And not for lack of trying on our parts. Short of tackling the server, she simply had no interest in waiting on our table. It's clear that this place has more interest in hiring hot girls than quality servers. 

Upon leaving, there was a petite gal at the hostess desk who thanked us for coming in, but I corrected her and told her that we were leaving because we were ignored for 30 minutes. She just said, ""sorry"". No mention of calling over a manager, or anything to try to change our minds to stay.

I give 2 generous stars because the happy hour at the bar with the delightful bartender was a nice experience. But that's the only thing I can say about this place. If you're hungry, seriously go someplace else.",pHp0UVnYiRZWm1mSqPiS5g,0,0,2,2p4M4PKE1cEhsSlsK3BnPw

The staff running this joint seems like they just stepped out of high school. Gossiping at the register, cliques at the hotess stand. Getting off work and hanging at the bar in your work clothes...

Upon entering the lounge, it smelled like a bathroom. I could've left at that point, but we decided to stay & give it a chance. 

We were sipping our drinks inside at the bar, and the music started playing ""N'Sync""...then a song by ""New Kids on The Block"" and I said aloud, ""what's up with the boyband music?"" One woman at the bar said it was from an app on your smartphone where you can control the music. I asked her if the customers are controlling it? Because for a wine & whiskey lounge, it doesn't seem like a fitting dynamic. She semi-explained that you get to pick one song for free then you have to pay for the service. The next song that came on was Brittney spears. We paid quickly and were ready to leave. 

The bartender came running out with a big smile and explained that one of their coworkers was controlling the music from home as a joke. It's not funny when it's running business out of your front door. 

Here's an idea; don't play child's music at a wine and whiskey lounge. Try that. Then maybe everyone won't be standing around and gossiping because you'll actually have some business.",Q5-7-hw4Y1bRHuxAFDa1RA,2,0,2,zLJYzo6uYcXGCP-wJDqWug

As far as scotch goes, they break down the whiskys by regions, e.g., Islay, Speyside, Highland, etc..., which is nice. They also have a good rye and irish selection, if that's your thing. They also have a pretty good happy hour, and a whisky of the month that they'll offer at half the price. 

One of the things I really enjoy about this place is their outdoor sitting area where they also offer cigars for you to enjoy with your drink. Coupled with the amazing Las Vegas weather, it makes for a very nice experience with your friends and/or loved ones.",NtgSJaUmcoBRxHMbRQtDgA,0,1,4,3gmwdGPvW7oUF6MqdFUE2A

Croque Madame - Delicious.

They have a good happy hour menu, but I will say that the menu isn't too extensive or versatile. Don't get me wrong, there are great items to snack on, but if you come here often, I imagine the options get old. Lots of fried things for the happy hour menu. Options aren't too fulfilling if you're hungry.

I got the steak frites, which I loved.  My medium came out perfect & the fries were delicious.  I hated having to share this dish with my boyfriend ;p

FOOD:
""Arancini"" -Fried risotto balls with mushrooms & cheese served with a truffle aioli

DRINKS:
Whiskey of the month (don't remember the name, but it was quite smooth.)

TASTE: *** [The Arancini was deelish! ...the rice balls were fried crispy outside, soft & tasty inside, and the truffle sauce.] 
CONVENIENCE: **** [located in the center of the Town Square Mall.]
AMBIANCE: *** [Small bar, small lounge area, one large round table... lowly lit.]
SERVICE: ** [Friendly, but NOT accommodating to large groups.]
PRICE:  $ [$3-6 for small plates, paid $5 for the 1/2 off whiskey of the month]
OVERALL: ** [2-stars...  For our group of 10, they somehow added an additional $7 for a drink we didn't order AND after fixing their mistake then adding a 20% tip on top of our bill... each person still ended up paying an additional $2-3 MORE than what each person ordered.

Off the beaten path (for the most part), Double Helix offers happy hour every day from 3:30-7:30! There are wonderful wine selections including wine flights and unique things on the happy hour menu, not just what ever they need to get rid of. 

The owner / manager, has a great pallet and the pairings are fantastic! We ordered mostly munchies, but they were all good! The bartender, Kyle, makes a MEAN Manhattan! Their whiskey selection is extensive and among the best I've seen in one restaurant. There are also whisky flights available so you can try a few different ones. 

They have an outdoor patio and smoking area so that you can partake in the cigar selection they have inside. While it isn't the most expansive selection I've come across, it is descent and was perfect for a casual evening out on the patio. 

The atmosphere inside and out is perfect! Outside chairs are comfortable, the fires are nice in the winter. The patio lights are well distributed and provide for that perfect ambiance. Inside the lights are dim and the décor is chic and trendy, but casual and inviting.

We also tried the bbq pork sliders, very good as well, American fries, and the heirloom tomato salad.  The salad was another hit!  Fresh burrata, arugala pesto and a sweet, rich balsamic.  Very refreshing.  The fries were a really nice surprise!  They are served in a cone and seasoned with shallots and herbs, and then served with two sauces:  a sherry aioli & a spice ketchup.  Yowza!

And the drinks, you might ask?  That's why I've been wanting to try this place.  I started with a pear winetini, a refreshing, slightly sweet (not cloying sweet) mix of prosecco, pear vodka, and st. germaine.  I also tried a flight of red wines from Italy - very nice assortment.

The decor is definite high stature.  A lot of plush leather seating, clean tables, and the outside patio has a beautiful fire fixture that keeps you warm on nights when straight whiskey just isn't warming enough.

The drinks menu is well designed, offering explanations of the whiskey and their locations of origin.  This is perfect for those, like myself, that are interested in trying new types and want to learn more about what they're drinking.  There's even a map so you can visualize the area you're drinking from.

The food here was surprising.  During their happy hour, offerings are decently cheap and yet don't take away from the quality.  I often order the prosciutto and cheese platters, and so far its only ever been disappointing once.  Every other time I've ordered it, save the last time, the prosciutto has been high quality and a perfect item option to pair with the high quality liquor.  

Minus one star for the last visits food quality, and a small lapse in service where I caught the waitress texting for ten minutes rather than serving the few customers in the place for lunch, I've always been pleased with the service and food quality.

I stopped by with a group of colleagues  for some drinks after a long day at work, and everything was going great until we were all about to leave.  That's when Vicki the waitress comes over looks at me and loudly says in front of everyone ""Are you ok? I just wanted to make sure my service was good enough for you, because YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME A TIP"" I was baffled that she had said that I didn't know what to say, how dare she ask me why I didn't leave her a tip on my debit card? I told her ""yes, I am ok you are ok"" she then walked away and hid away at one end of the restaurant.  This upset our group as not one of us could believe she had just said that, how embarrassing and rude of her.  One of my coworkers gets up and speaks to Kyle one of the bar tenders and begins to explain to him what had just occurred.  And from the other end of the restaurant Vicki screams to us ""THAT'S HOW I PAY MY BILLS"" once again we were baffled with the way she was acting.  I stepped over to Kyle and explained how regardless of Vicki's day she had no right to treat me or anyone  in such a rude outrageous way.  
I had planned on leaving her a cash tip, that of which she never received, nor deserved.  I can't even begin to explain how upset I was, this sort of behavior is TERMS FOR TERMINATION.  Kyle passed us his business card and apologized and we left, Vicki was nowhere to be seen.   I will never return here, which is upsetting because I love town square's, atmosphere.  Vicki was not attentive to our table at all, and provided terrible customer service from the very beginning, so she had never genuinely deserved a tip.

A few friends and I met here for Sunday brunch and sat inside. They do have a patio, but it was as bit chilly to sit outside. I will be sitting out there when the weather gets warmer though. 

So they have a small brunch menu, which has a few appetizers and a couple entrees. For an appetizer I went with the crispy olives stuffed with chorizo and honey goat cheese. Sounds delicious right? Well these things were TINY. I guess I expected a larger olive to hold all of the filling. I couldn't taste any chorizo and could faintly taste the goat cheese. I wouldn't order these again. For my meal I ordered the veggie omelet which was delicious! It had seasonal veg, although I don't remember what exactly, and fontina cheese, and it came with a side of potatoes. It wasn't too much food, but it was just enough.

Upon entry the hostesses greeted us. We chose to sit at the bar. Our bartendar welcomed us and took our drink order. 

They have a huge selection of whiskeys and wine from all over the world. It was great to have such a variety. They offered flights as well, Yay!!!! I started with a cucumber garden martini, very refreshing and light. Then moved on to the around world red wine flight. Loved the Bordeaux it was a blend so it was easy to drink. 

They have happy hour everyday till 7:30. Longest happy hour I've seen, especially on a Friday and Saturday. The happy hour menue isn't very big but we opted to try a few of the items. 

Arancini, vegan hummus and yellowfin tuna were my favorites.  We tried the olive poppers which were a bit odd, different however. The stuffed jalapeño was quite large and filling. Smoked Duck charcuterie wasn't our favorite, tasted a bit processed.

The staff:  It's a wine bar.  I'm not asking for experienced Somms but you know an inexperienced one when you see one.  I wouldn't suggest die hard wine lovers come to this place...I think it's for a more relaxed sipper.  The hostess/sommelier/waitress/eye candy girl was very nice.  I think the rule is though, you don't pour your own wine, but the guys I was with were really left with no choice.  She didn't come back for a while.  It wasn't a busy night...maybe she could tell we were bored..

The goods:  Their water was fantastic!  Seriously that's all I ordered.  My friends seemed to enjoy the bottle of Riesling they ordered (shame I didn't share it with them, Riesling is my favorite), and I had a sip of some Desert Blood thing.  Not too bad.

The atmosphere:  I was really confused.  I expected a modern almost futuristic design but it seemed like it was a cross between a hookah lounge complete with Indian lanterns and a pub, squishy leather loveseats included.

2580868,2013-04-14,0,hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ,"So last night a friend and I were looking for a place to eat. We were playing it by ear. So upon walking around town square we came upon Double Helix.  IT was pretty crowded at 830 and were greeted by several hostesses which were extremely polite. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. SO we went to the bar to grab beer, as we were at the bar one one of the Hostess (Manager baybe) came over to the bar and asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar why we waited for the table. 
The bartender was extremely friendly  She then came over and told us our table was ready.. I thought this was a nice touch for them being so busy.  They did take my number to text me when the table was ready, however the personal communication was outstanding.  

Upon sitting at our table our server came over and greeted us. We still had our beers so she said she would be back in a few to take our order. We then ordered a few things. The Arrenchini and Lobster mac and cheese were outstanding. As we were eating the server checked on us and even the Owner came to our table a few times. We had a quick conversation with him.... Upon finishing our beers the server came back over to ask if we wanted another drink. we asked her opinion on their cocktails.  She suggested one for each of us.  As we were done eating they removed the plates and the owner came back over and talked to us again about our drinks. My friend likes Irish whiskey so the owner and him talked about a couple and he even brought him a small sip of a Irish whiskey.  Great touch... 
As we were about to leave we checked in on Facebook and a couple of our friends were in the area  and commented to meet them. We payed our check and left the restaurant.

We then met our friends and we decided to come back and have another cocktail. We got our same table back and same waitress. The owner came back over and mentioned he was trying to say bye the first time but we left so quick. He came and chatted with us again.  GREAT TOUCH. made us feel at home and this was our first time there. 

I do not live here in Vegas but my friends do.. We will be back for sure..

Thanks for a great night.. The service at Helix made our night.  THANKS AGAIN!


GREAT JOB.... Keep it up.",J9LYbG5nH2pw_F_0kyUVZg,0,0,5,L00RkRo7QAflP22ga3fapA

We went for Happy Hour Thursday, and the wine pour is like half of a normal pour, so you really aren't saving money. $6.00 a glass, so your getting probably 6 glasses out of one bottle equaling $36.00 so your making a killing.  My husband drinks IPA beer, and the happy hour IPA was out, so did they substitute?  No. We had to pay full price which was 21.00 for 3 small glasses.  That's not good service...My girlfriend ordered asaid I  well scotch and water, and they charged full price~~~and had to argue with the waitress over why isn't Happy Hour, she was oh we don't have Happy Hour price for Scotch ,What???
  Really, let your customers no this.  Just crazy ...
Your local customers  aren't coming back with that.  Lord Flemings gives a better pour.
The charcuterie was very very thin sliced, and the cheese portion was smaller then what Delta serves on the plane.

The ambiance was really fun. Kinda dark. Kinda mysterious. Enough excitement happening around to sit back and really enjoy the food and drinks. It is definitely a drinks and apps type place and not as great for a sit down meal.

What we got:

The Red Sangria (4 stars): great fresh fruit chunks and refreshing flavor
The hummus app (2-3 stars): Very basic hummus plate with pita and some carrots. Hate to say it, but I enjoy Trader Joe's hummus better.
The grown up grilled cheese (4 stars): 4 pieces of tasty melted cheese with some extra grown up flavors. Very good!
The BBQ Pork Sliders (5 stars): Seriously, these sliders were amazing! So good that we ordered another round of them after all the other food! Great flavor, nice balance of elements, simply delicious.

""Adulting"" - Definition: Sipping one or two drinks, staying within your cocktail budget, and using all of your Uber credits for your inebriated friends. 

The Double Helix is a great lounge for both snackers and whiskey lovers alike. This spot is located in the main hub of Town Square and they feature over one hundred whiskeys and an entire vineyard's worth of wines, both red and white.  

Instead of just staring at their vast drink menu, I suggest going with a ""drink flight"", this is the best way to find out exactly what you do and don't like and yes, they offer whiskey and wine flights for the indecisive person. They also have great happy hour deals that usually highlight a specialty whiskey or wine. If you really want to get educated on whiskey ask for Kyle, one of the bartenders, he's the hunky guy in the Kilt. The dude is legit when it comes to drink suggestions and whiskey anecdotes. 

Hummus, quesadillas, and fried cheese is just a small sample of the snacks they offer here, they also have excellent charcuterie plates to go with that bold red in your hand.

DH has an extensive drink menu, mostly (you guessed it!) wine & whiskey. However their happy hour left my friends and I feeling pretty hungry still. 

Happy hour food prices here are a bit high compared to the portion size, but then again DH does serve mainly tapas. We ordered the tacos, 2 for $7. They came out hot with a super soft tortilla and well seasoned pork. I'd definitely order this again if I come back. Most of the food on the happy hour menu is only a dollar or two off their regular menu price so I'm not sure if its worth it. Like other reviewers said, if you come hungry, you'll probably leave hungry unless you spend a lot. 

Wine & sangria are about $5. I was hoping that they would have white sangria, but its made with red wine so I passed. Their apple fizz $6, was pretty tasty. The first few sips didn't taste like alcohol at all but towards the end it was pretty strong. The Whisky mule is made with lemon juice. I wish they added some mint to it. Also, I could hardly taste the whisky in the drink... not sure if that's good or bad!

Double Helix is the kind of bar that a lot of other cities take for granted, and Las Vegas' equivalent is a PTs. It's a great place to go for an early evening cocktail and light dinner. Since it's in a shopping center it's also a great place for a light lunch on a shopping trip. The main downside to Double Helix is that it is in a shopping center so I hardly ever come here as a local (even if it is a ""locals"" shopping center). 

DRINKS:
My mom ordered the ABC wine flight and I ordered The Last Samurai cocktail. The Last Samurai was $16 which is pretty damn expensive. However, when I realized the cheapest Japanese whisky on the menu is $12, I figured fine I may as well have a cocktail. Can't be ordering a cheap Japanese whisky for fear of getting judged by the bartender. The bartender informed me that the cocktail is different now than the menu's description and he sort of alluded that it's a ""dessert cocktail."" That almost made me not order it but I did anyways. It wasn't overly sweet, sort of similar to a Manhattan. It actually reminded me of those chocolate oranges in foil that come in slices. I guess they got rid of the grapefruit part of it, which is what caught my eye in the first place. I would probably order this again if I knew I only wanted one drink all night. 

FOOD:
Since we went on a Thursday we got a free Arancini with the flight my mom ordered. The Arancini is basically 6 fried risotto balls. It tasted like truffle mac and cheese inside so.. very good and even better free. We also ordered the Shortie tacos and the Blazin' sliders to share. The Shortie tacos' short ribs were AMAZING. I want all my tacos to have this meat. My only complaint was the tacos ended up looking pretty empty, they could have put more filling in them for sure. The Blazin' sliders were surprisingly really spicy, but I like that. It's the perfect amount for two people. The fried yucca sticks were basically tortilla strips. I think they could have given us a little more of these too, or just left them off altogether. 

If you can get here for Happy Hour, that's the way to go because the prices are borderline too high for what you get. Keep in mind you can order tacos for a few dollars cheaper and burgers for a few dollars more (with fries) next door at Yardhouse. I like Double Helix because it's an upscale bar with better-than-average bar food and it's not smoky and doesn't have video poker all over the bar. Sure, it's in a shopping center, but it allows you to escape Vegas for a bit and pretend you're in San Diego or somewhere chic-er than here. It's still a great option for first dates, girl's night pregames, happy hours, or light dinners with cocktails.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,0,4,zJqrkBvGUGr5Xb25_KWnWA

Mimi X. and I were supposed to have a girl's night out at Yardhouse but because of the UFC fight and St. Patty's Day weekend, the wait times at Yardhouse were atrocious. Mimi X. suggested that we make our way to Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge instead. 

What I love about this place is its ambiance and how swanky it is. The restaurant itself is not very big, but there's ample seating and plenty of room at the bar. The lights are dimmed which adds to the relaxing feel of the place. Basically, this place is perfect for a date night or a night out with a couple gal pals. 

Mimi X. got a couple glasses of whiskey on the rocks and I ordered a glass of the Monchoff Riesling. I was quite satisfied with my wine. We also ordered two plates to share.  The Olive poppers (deep fried olives stuffed with chorizo and goat cheese) were delicious! I wish there were more on the plate. The saltiness of the olives sort of hid the taste of the chorizo and goat cheese but nonetheless, it was a tasty appetizer! We also ordered the BBQ Pork Sliders. The apricot sauce, sweet pickle and chipotle saw with the pork was the perfect balance between salty and sweet. Two small sliders come in one order. Again, I wish there was more of it!

Original plans completely changed last minute.  Even so, not knowing exactly how many attendees would show, we were able to get a table which accomodated our group - no reservation; and were seated almost immediately.  Great regards to our lovely couple friends (my new daughters - inside joke).

Indoor and outdoor seating is available.  There are bar height tables, regular tables, lounge couch seating, and bar seating.  The decor is super cute.  I love the lamps in this place.  

The happy hour menu is really cool.  HH includes wines, whiskeys, and pretty good appetizer options.  The tacos get my vote!  The truffle risotto balls are good too.  I tried the whiskey mule... smackering sourness... get me a drool bib!  I'd say I'll just stick to an original or a raspberry ginger beer with J.D.  

Leaving out the cons in this review, as overall the experience here was good.  And I'd return for happy hour hangouts with fun friends.  I'm not a smoker, but this is also a cigar bar.

Michael, the General Manager was extremely generous to acknowledge Lavi's birthday and introduced a new wine that just came out on their menu October 1st.  Much gratitude sir; you made her night extra special.  

Also, the pinot noir that was introduced to us was definitely thumbs up.  I had only tasted a French wine at a thanksgiving dinner once; didn't capture me.  This Bourgogne, changed my thoughts.  It's really pleasant; not heavy - especially the after taste.  Wonderful introduction, thanks to you!

I don't like Town Square that much as I typically find it overpriced, but they do have some solid HH deals.  Double Helix has a great HH in terms of timing (from open until 7:30pm).  A HH ending at 7:30pm is almost unheard of in Vegas.  They have a couple of beer and cocktail deals for under $6 and then about 6 appetizers to choose from for around $6-8 a piece.  The drink selection was fine - nothing amazing.  I had the apple cocktail and enjoyed it but wouldn't pay sticker price of $12.  The food was actually pretty average.  Portion sizes were very small so coming here outside HH would probably require at least 3 dishes to suitably get full.  They have a nice whiskey selection and a few tvs to watch the game, but I think Double Helix is a little classed-up; a bar to the tune of Yard House or McFadden's next door is more in my wheel house.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,1,3,wsORt26Crbl0LyaJWzKyDg

It was actually pretty decent. The jalapeno was undercooked but it didnt really ruin the dish. I moved on to a pesto grilled cheese sandwich. This was actually pretty good as well. The cheese was really the star of the whole sandwich. After the grilled cheese I ordered some Italiano sliders. I ordered them medium rare but they got to the table and they were more on the medium side. I did enjoy them none the less. 

I did notice that a few whiskeys they had on their bar were not listed in their menu. I went to the bartender to ask how much they were but he was a bit too interested in talking to some pretty girls sitting at the bar so I just waited till he was done with the short conversation he was having. When I inquired about their whiskey of the month my waitress informed me it was a scotch from northern Scotland. While not wrong I felt like if you are going to work at a whiskey bar you should at the least know the regions of Scotland and what region certain scotches come from especially if its your whiskey of the month. I ended up having some beer that was on special during happy hour as the prices for their whiskey are a bit high for what you get in return compared to almost any bar Ive been to in Las Vegas yet. After the beer I had a couple ""whiskey mules"". These were actually pretty nice. I would definitely order them again.

All in all it was an alright experience. They do have some decent happy hour specials but the prices on their whiskey are just a bit too high for my tastes.",LCvRa_NJNYFy-pdd_Fe6VQ,0,0,2,5nlFTXaH73LfneKegOTkRA

The only criticism is of the term ""wine and whiskey lounge.""

I tried to be good and ordered the gluten free appetizer, Seared Yellowfin Tuna. It was really good and at happy hour prices, it was a steal. But then I got weak.... And had to order the Grown Up Grilled cheese. It was adorable. I ordered it sans pork (allergy) and it was really good. 

My friend ordered the Olive poppers, but I couldn't try them (also had pork) this place is very pork friendly. I don't think she expected them to be breaded & deep fried. She also ordered the Salmon Caesar salad. It was very big & looked delicious! She said she liked it.

The reservation was confirmed during that call.  When I arrived on Saturday, I was told that they did not have a reservation for us and was told they don't make reservations for Friday and Saturdays.  I was told that ""when some tables leave, we will try to get you a table"".  I promptly texted all the guests that were not there yet and told them not to come (as I was not sure those of us there would get a table).  It made me feel like a jackass.

We waited quite a while and finally got a table; in the meantime, a staff member spilt a drink on me. 

They tried to make things right: birthday shot for me and a round of shots for the table.  However, when you planned to have a party of 18-20 for dinner and end up celebrating a milestone birthday with 7, it's a bummer.

Anyway, I was very excited to finally try this place out.  The ambiance was great, it was a big more upscale than the other bars around that area.  Music was tolerable - you can still have a decent conversation.  This is what we had:

Helix (house brand, I assume): Merlot and Pinot Noir ... it was very decent wines that we ordered 3 glasses each!

The food (let me see if I remember)

Pulled pork sliders: Sauce was not overwhelming (ie: messy) BUT they could have put more on the side just so we can add more to our liking.  

Fried Olives: breaded perfectly (not oily and totally crispy).  If not mistaken it as kalamata olives.

Compot ACO (I think I got that right): The jams were tasty, wished they added more fruits and the cheese was great compliment to the Pinot I was drinking)

Skirt Steak: YUMMM!  Perfectly cooked for a thin strip of meat - it was still red in the middle - good job!

Hummus: Really liked this one.  Flavorful, not overwhelming and the added fruits (?) in the hummus sweetened up the bite.  The bread was thin and not overwhelming.

Margherita Flatbread: Crust was thin (brunt to a crisp on the sides).  Might want to watch it while in the oven.  The basil was very fresh (last minute addition) which brightened it up really nicely.  Would love more mozzarella. 

a Chocolate Cake (I forgot the name): very rich, you can really taste the cocoa and coffee.  It was a great ending to the meal.

During our recent trip back to town, we decided to stop by here for a couple of drinks before we went to The Act Nightclub.

First of all, we were happy to see that it was still in business.  Half of us ordered a glass of Wine and the other half ordered a chalice of Stella.  We hung out for about an hour and enjoyed the people watching.  Since it's located in one of the main intersections of the mall, you can see people walking around in all directions.  There were also several characters hanging out at the bar, which were fun to watch.

If you're looking for a place to have a nice glass of Wine and Beer, give this place a shot.  They also deliver to all hotels on the Strip, so take a look at their Wine menu and if there's a bottle you like, they'll take it to you.

When we arrived, it was early evening well before a dinner rush & we were seated right away. The food was awesome, service was knowledgeable & friendly. 

Here's the rub. It was a Sunday, once football kicked off the music went down & the TV sound went up full blast. We asked if the football commentary was going to but audible for the whole game, our server has to go ask & returned to tell us that yes, on ""this night"" the game would be on. 

Here's my gripe. If we wanted to have a football game blasting over the speakers, we would have gone to a sports bar. Unfortunately, it prompted us to get our check & leave.

And you can get bloody Mary's too! They have a nice comfy patio which I super cool but they do allow smoking as this is a cigar bar so if you have a small child sit inside because smokers will be out there (had this issue before).

I've frequented this place over the years, but this is my first time leaving a review. Kyle, the bartender, is one of the best in Vegas! There needs to be a better title, because to call him a bartender is a disservice to what he does because he is not only a magician with the cocktails, he also eloquently lays out what goes into each drink and what kind of taste to expect in such a way that both pleases the veteran drinker and informs the novice. He does this without ever sounding condescending, which is an attitude you see far too often in Las Vegas. My girl and I were pleased to have his expertise and humour, and he's definitely what we'd consider an irreplaceable asset to this particular location! Seeing as how he's been a fixture there for at least the few years I've been going there, the ownership probably agrees with that sentiment. I've honestly never had the food here, so I cannot comment on that. The environment is pleasant and the crowd is pretty good. Never seen any dramas or problems.

I was, as usual, running late so by the time I arrive it was the last few minutes of happy hour (which is from 3:30-7:30pm) and the other ladies already had drinks and placed a food order. 

I didn't like that the happy hour specials were not more clearly indicated. The waitress rattled off what my options were and waited for me to select. When I go to a new place for the first time, I like to check out all my options before deciding on something but I suppose that's what I get for being late.  

I ended up getting a Stella since it was the happy hour beer. I know, ordering a beer at a wine bar? Not really my style but the wines that were on special didn't appeal to me. I was disappointed when the waitress brought back a bottle of Stella and said the tap had just run out. Bottled beer is not the same as beer from the tap, but at least it was half price.

I didn't bother ordering food because again, the items that were half price simply did not appeal to me and the items that did appeal to me seemed pricey. Service was ok, our waitress seemed a bit spacey when it came time to split our bill but it could have been a lot worse. 

Will I be back? That I am really not sure of, Town Square has places I have enjoyed drinking at more then Double Helix. .. Maybe if I am already there and craving a glass of Merlot....",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,1,3,zNgH9zhBptXJU2J2NyoPIw

This is my 1st review hammered, but regardless, I'm always honest af..so let's do this....

Service: Our server Kristin was so sweet..  She was totally cool with explaining the wine flights order a 2nd time as my buddy snapped it.  she just started watching game of thrones and we made sure we didn't mess up her show by talking about the recent seasn.  All I know is that Khaleesi's army is super extra....as was Kristin taking care of us.

Drinky Drinks I sampled tonight, was feeling whisky then moved to gin...
1) Last Samurai = Suntory Whisky Toki + amaro + scrappy's grapefruit bitters + topped with lemon juice 
2) New York Sour = Wine-Spiked Whiskey Sour
3) Last Word = DH Barrel aged In + green chartreuse + maraschino liquor + fresh lime juice

The Last Samurai & NY Sour were tasty af and got me hammered quickly.  The Last mf Samurai was my favorite, by far.  I like their style.  For whatever reason, I switched to the Last Word with Gin for my last drink, word.  Little too sweet and overwhelming for me, kinda like my last couple of relationships but like this drink, got my last one in, said goodbye and we both moved on amicably.   Just let it go, so something new can enter your life..ijs..

Value: $16, $15, $11 were the prices of the 3 drinks I had.  Tasty and less than a bad lap dance/decision in vegas. So I've heard...

Ambiance: Intimate, couches and conversation.  This is where you can find all 3.  Chilling on the couch + booze = stimulates good conversation with good peeps.  

Summary: Although blitzed, I know good service and drinks when I experience it.  Thanks to the staff for hosting a great night as we entertained our close friend from out of town. Double Helix's casting couch is a great place for conversation and to catch up for drinks.  Time to hit up some food and update this review in the near future. Respect...

I met a friend for drinks and loved the extensive and creative cocktail bible (it was huge) that I was presented with.  My one complaint (that I have with most places) is the reaction I get to my request for modifications. I do not like drinks that are super sweet and am perfectly satisfied with the sugar that is found in the fruit that comes in cocktails. I ordered the 'Repo Man' - tequila, sour, agave nectar ('healthy' simple syrup), ginger syrup and muddled strawberries, apples and lemons. That's a WHOLE lotta sweet in one 8 oz glass. When I asked the bartender to keep the agave nectar out she flat out wouldn't do it, insisting I wouldn't like it. No, I'm pretty sure I know what muddled fruit and tequila will taste like, thank you.  She instead cut the amount in half and SHOCKER it was still far too sweet for me.  For my second drink, I went with the 'Nutty Mojito' - coconut vodka, coconut cream, muddled lime, mint and soda.  It was decent, definitely better than my cup o' sugar I had previously.  My friend had 2 glasses of Shiraz that were pretty fantastic so I ended up rounding my night out with a glass as well.

The prices were outrageous and the staff was not accommodating.  I was ashamed of bringing my family there.  I will not be recommending this place to any of my friends and family.  The manager, Michael, tried to sell us a 1 ounce shot of Jack Daniels Sinatra for $25.  The 2 ounce shot they sell is priced at $40.  The manager made up his own price of $25 for the 1 ounce shot which should have been no more than $20.  We were getting ready to spend over $200 but when the manager tried to over charge us $5 we made our way out.  When I confronted him about it he acted like he didn't care, was rude, and decided to change his mind  to $20 instead of $25.  I told him it was too late because my family was already upset and walking out the door.  He didn't even try to apologize and sarcastically told me to have a nice day.  These guys make over $500 off a $165 bottle (25 ounces) and you're telling me there was no way he could be generous or hospital to us for a 1ounce pour of fire water!?!?  We didn't want a discount, we just didn't want to get ripped off and pay more for less! 

We had just finished dining at Ri Ra Irish Pub inside Mandalay Bay shops, and got a flight of single malt scotch for $18 and amazing service.  We even tried more whiskey after the manager came over and engaged in conversation with us and pointed out some single malts he wanted us to taste!  So we were stunned when Michael at Double Helix tried to rip us off right away. 

If you want reasonably priced whiskey and hospitable service stay away from this place.  Worst experience I have EVER had in Las Vegas by far.  I have been living here for 8 years and used to work in the Food/Beverage Industry as a bartender/manager.

This is their mission statement online too:
Double Helix strives to achieve and maintain such distinction in food and wine service and knowledge, delivered professionally in welcoming atmosphere, that the restaurant gains a first class reputation for unique gastronomy, gracious hospitality, comfort and beauty which draws new and repeat customers year after year.",-HcirMcpUDd3GvexCOCCzg,1,0,1,n7OTHuv0R-EI2_PpUSQJEg

It was a great choice for the 1st stop. We had a round of cocktails. then ordered the Chef's Selection of Charcuterie & cheese plus 2 orders of sliders along with a carafe of Sangria. More than enough for 6 people. 

Or so we thought. 

The Chef's selection was perfect for a little nosh - but we are BIG folks & so we ordered a second one of the top 3 choices from both cheese & meats. 

The smoked duck & the chorizo were the star attractions from the meat side while the Moody Bleu & the truffle bruschetto were the big cheese. 

I want the homemade onion jam on everything. 

The ""boys"" of the group wanted cigars - so while they were having around of maker's mark cigars, we ordered another carafe of the sangria. I'm a sangria purest. fruit, juice & wine. But why stick to boring fruit when you can have blackberry brandy, orange vodka & apple schnapps coupled with a very full bodied red wine. 
Luckily there was some nice crusty bread to soak up all the liquor. 

But if you follow my yelp, you'll know i'm in this for the 'fatability"" 
So yes they have nice hip friendly seating. without having to ask for it. 

Food: tasty & fresh
Ambiance:  pleasant but a bit loud with the tv's going. 
Service: attentive but not overly so. 

total bill was $176.00 including tip & cigars. Appx 60.00 per couple. Not bad.

Ordered the Prosciutto platter (I think it was), and the Bri (if I remember correctly), and the fries. Our server warned us the Bri would take 15min or so to make, which we were fine with. We actually got that first before our basic fries. In fact, we finished it first before receiving our fries. Our server was missing at this point, so I had to ask some random server about our fries. Within minutes they showed up. 

We then asked to be seated out on the patio so we can smoke our cigar for the first time. It was nice seating near the fire pit. Our server was attentive now, and showed us how to properly smoke a cigar. 

I took off a star because according to our server they were a bit understaffed. Apparently another server was able to leave earlier in the night. My suggestion is DO NOT cut anyone on a Saturday night especially when there is an event going on in Town Square. Aka Wine Walk.

The interior decoration for this location is very dark, but light and chill.  I like how the set up is made, and the mood of the music can be quite interesting if you come on a good day.  Sometimes it would be indie, other times it would be house. Regardless of that I did wish that the music was a little lower than it should be, I don't think we're at a night club guys.  

Well onto other important factors, the people at the bar a nice.  Sometimes you might even have intriguing conversations with them.  I'd like to add that there is happy hour, but only on selected items and it varies on certain days.  The food here has been the number one attention grabber for me so far, I've tried almost everything on the menu and I can say I'm quite impressed for a bar that's well known for their wine.  For those who complain about the prices of the drinks, they're not selling the cheap stuff. You can't get a glass of merlot and expect it to be $2.00, you're not paying for a glass full of crap.  So excuse my language, but this isn't your typical bar where you just order cocktails and shots.  They do serve wine and the expensive stuff by the glass, hence the name ""WINE and WHISKEY.""

The food's served as tapas, somewhat like a Firefly experience.  What I did get to try were the:
- Aracini: It was delicious and oozing hot fresh when I first bit into it.  The taste of the truffle oil was dominant, and I loved it.

- BBQ Pork sliders - I love the taste of coleslaw in any burger, and I was happy to have it incorporated.  

- Quesidilla - MMmmmMM, what a well incorporated dish. Everything just oozed together, I was merely impressed. And the addition of guacamole just made my day.

- Heriloom Burrata - all I know that the prosciutto and cheese with basil leaf anything, is always good. 

- Chipotle Slider - Guacamole in any slider with bacon in my book, is worth trying.  

- French Fries - Ahh the crispiness of their fries, and the two sauces on the side.  I love fries, so you can never go wrong with that.  
 

Aside from the food, I hope they do continue to improve with their kinks and do well because there food is amazingly delicious. That with a glass of Moscato, and I'm good. Tipsy even. ^_^",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,5,4,4,K-zZc1rJxJGf6Mu-0QKoFQ

Olive poppers: Not a fan of olives, and these were just alright. Salty & tasted like a tortino's pizza roll. Would skip next time.
BBQ Sliders: Meat was well seasoned, but with the slaw, tasted oddly burnt.. wasn't horrible.
We also ordered the Whisky Mule and Southern Sipping (more on the sweet side, but less fruity than we had hoped). 
Not from the HH, we had the Grown up Grilled Cheese which was good. Soft and cheesy on the inside and out. Prosciutto plate was overly salty as well.. the meat is salty to begin with but with the sauce added, was too much.

Vegan tacos - lettuce wrap style with couscous, baked chic peas, and slice of avocado. Very tasteless. Almost broke a tooth on the chic peas. They were way way too hard for consumption. I ended up pawning mine off on a hungry co-worker. I don't need the dental bill the next day. I imagine these are better on another day!

Our waitress was a little slow last night. She was super nice and friendly, but the place was packed. I don't want to blame her for this, I'm chalking it up to the management staff to put more boots on the ground. I think I only saw about two girls taking orders, the rest were food runners.

Double Helix is a small but very welcoming bar. There's couch, table, and bar seating available inside. There's also seating outdoors and a rectangular fire pit.

Their happy hour is from 3:30p-7:30p with discounted wine, beer, whiskey and appetizers. I love going on Mondays rather than during happy hour because they have 1/2 off bottles of wine all day. I go and enjoy my favorite Pinot Noir Meoimi for $20! Tuesdays they have 20% off the final bill for all industry locals and Wednesdays it's 1/2 off featured whiskey and wine of the month. I also like going on Wednesdays to broaden my whiskey horizon. Having great daily specials makes Double Helix that much better. 

I don't care for their menu items but I do like their custom charcuterie tray which pairs perfectly with wine. It can get a little pricy adding in all the different meats and cheeses you want.

I met up with a couple friends here last night for happy hour. Overall the place hasn't changed much, it's still the romantic ambiance and sexily dressed waitresses. Their happy hour prices for alcohol were great. I chose to get a Stella, my friends opted for wine. Our waitress was upbeat and attended to our needs very well.

As for the food, I'm just going to have to say... 3.5 stars. So, a little bump for their happy hour and food, mostly because the quesadilla had really good flavor and was very different from any quesadilla I've had. Unfortunately the quesadilla is not on the happy hour menu, to which I implore management - please put it on there! During the course of the night I also had the olives (meh), and the BBQ Pork Sliders (also meh, but kudos for the sweet pickles!). The bun was soft though, but overall I've definitely had better pork sammies. 

Will I return? Perhaps, when I'm in Town Square or if my friends happen to want to do happy hour here again. I am also interested in the Pre Fixe breakfast on Saturday and Sunday! So maybe I'll have to go back and try that out.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,3,3,Fv-5aMukFGfA4H-sUdTWGg

Our server Susan was amazing, she worked her heart out keeping everyone happy and served.

On this visit they had $2 tacos but we decided to order items off the menu and everything was really good.  The little burgers were ok, the pesto was amazing on it and the fried cheese was good as well, the burgers were just ok.

We also had fried risotto balls and they were AMAZING.

The only complaint was the bartender.  I ordered a mojito and she forgot to put the grenadine in the drink.  First off, the bar was not that busy and if she would have focused on her job instead of wanting to chat with another lady sitting at the bar, maybe she would do her job better.  She seemed more interested in chatting and acting like a customer instead of a bartender.  

What was even worse is that instead of telling me they forgot an ingredient, both the server and the bartender hoped I would not notice.  REALLY???

This girl needs a new career and anything with drinks is NOT it.  The second drink I ordered supposedly had all the ingredients, but it just did not taste the same.  

I like this place however if I come in again and see this girl bartending, I will not order anything from the bar.  IF there is no way to get a drink without going through the bar, I will go somewhere else.

The General Manager, Michael Pierotti, mocked my friend and I and accused us of lying about our experience - an experience in which we ordered a dessert, paid for it in advance, and did not receive it. 

My friend and I were attending an event at the AMC theatre on a Wednesday evening. We were supposed to be at the event by 6:30. We arrived early and decided to grab a quick bite. So at 5:40p, we stopped by Double Helix for the first time and sat on the patio. We ordered 3 tapas to share. Between 5:45 and 6:05, the food came out pretty quickly, about 5 minutes apart. So at 6:10, we figured we had time to order dessert, the beignets. I asked a male server if the dessert would come out quickly since we had to go soon, and he said yes. So we ordered it. 6:10 is also the last time we were able to get any service or easily get a server's attention.

Between 6:10 and 6:35, the next 25 minutes, no one asked if we needed anything. I had to flag the male server and our original female server a couple times to ask about the dessert. My friend paid ahead of time so we could eat and leave quickly. We paid for our meal about 10 min before we were to leave.

Finally, at 6:30 and no dessert in sight, we got up and stood inside waiting for our server to reappear. We told her we had to leave but we would return for the dessert after the event. She confirmed that with the manager and then we left. When the event concluded, we returned to the Double Helix around 9:30. About 6 min later, we received our dessert, brought to us by the GM (I didn't know who he was at the time. He never introduced himself). As he set down the plate, he said, ""Thank you for coming back,"" with a definite attitude.

We were caught off guard by the tone since a.) we had already paid for this so of course we would come back, and b.) we expected more of an apology for the inconvenience.

We ate and again for about 20 min, no one came by to see if we wanted anything else. All we had was water and our already-purchased dessert. We weren't even provided menus. When the server finally came by, I asked if there was anything they could offer because of the inconvenience. Then the GM returned. He asked how our beignets were and we responded that they were good. Then my friend asked, ""Do you know what happened?"" The GM responded to the effect of ""you put in a rush order and then decided to go"" indicating this was our fault. My friend said, ""Well it wasn't a rush order which is why we thought it odd you just thanked us for coming back.""

Then the GM responded, ""Yes, I was thanking you for enabling my staff to enjoy some free delicious beignets."" He went on to say that we chose to leave behind the beignets which were ready to go out. In a sarcastic and mocking tone. We were stunned.

I went on to explain to him the situation: a.) that we ordered the dessert with time to spare and were assured twice by the male server that we would receive it quickly, b.) 25 minutes passed and it never arrived, c.) we had no service during that time and had to seek out and flag servers to get updates and info, and d.) we had to go, and since we had already paid, we came back.

He immediately went on the defensive. No apology. He started with an explanation of how busy it was during happy hour. I certainly understand that. That doesn't mean you ignore patrons for the duration of their stay. Happy hour ends at 7:30. It was 6:10 when they stopped providing us with any service until we stood up to leave. Also, the service was still poor at 9:30.

Pierotti also went on to dispute my factual account of how long things took. The GM claimed our order was a rush and it was ready in 3 min and by the time we were leaving it was ready to go out. We ordered it 25 min before we left. So that math doesn't compute. He didn't agree, implying we were lying. He argued that 25 min would be ridiculously long, that the only thing that takes a long time is the brie. I said yes, that is a long time and that's why we had to finally leave to make our event in time. We also paid for it 10 min in advance. So even then, that math doesn't compute. How could the kitchen have only first heard about the order three minutes before we left when we paid for it 10 min prior? If someone dropped the ball and forgot to put the order in, then that is a simple mistake. Which brings us back to the original issue - this was a great inconvenience and all he had to do was offer an apology and ask what he could do to make the situation better. Standard customer service. Instead, he was defensive, rude, condescending, sarcastic, and accusing us, Customers!, of lying to him about our experience.

The food was fine. But I won't return. I have never encountered a GM who would treat anybody this way. He is abusing his power, and it is a shame there is no one overseeing him to hold him accountable.",ADNLYx9DMGoGPhZvnviTag,0,0,1,Etl2wKr1aEvParA4pFtUSQ

Waitresses dressed trashy as did the hostesses.  I can see how this might have allure in some contexts, but it just seemed out of place here.

The music was loud and really bass heavy, which would have seemed appropriate if they had a dance floor - but this is just a tiny little bar.

Last night I my bf I decided to meet here for drinks and some food, we've been here before and really loved it. Everything is great as the evening goes on.
At some point, I'm not sure if it was the bar tender or the bar back, but one of them manages to knock over an entire glass of ice water that completely soaks my jeans and jacket. (We are sitting at the bar) they make a fuss with napkins and wipe the counter but water is already spilled whatever. 

I'm annoyed but what can you do. My bf on the other hand is really upset at the situation. It's not until 10 min later the 2nd bartender comes with a napkin saying ""hey I heard water was spilled!"" Uhh ok, thanks but you're a little late. My bf is clearly upset kind of just tells the guys ""it's already spilled there's nothing you can do."" The bartender doesn't say another word. Not a word about ""hey let's get you another drink."" I understand they don't have to offer us a round of drinks on the house. But they spilled a whole glass of ice water on my & clearly the customer is upset, and yet, in the moment they do or say nothing to repair this whatsoever. 

About half an hour goes by and we decide to leave. We get the check and everything is paid for. I offer to leave a cash tip, which my bf takes because he is so upset at the situation at this point. I get that too. But I'm also the person that always leaves 20% even when it's horrible service, I can't help it. SO WE LEAVE.

The bartender then follows us as we're OUT OF THE DOORS ALREADY, and starts asking my BF what the problems is, how he doesn't want him to leave ""UPSET."" Ok, at this point now I AM THE ONE GETTING MAD. It feels like the bartender is now just antagonizing him KNOWING damn well he was upset, before we left. The only reason he stops him is what, because he didn't get his tip???? WE PAID THE BILL. And you have every opportunity to repair this customer relationship, we sat long enough AFTER the water spilled, that there was ample time for it to dry by the time we left. SO NO, do not now decide to follow is out because you don't want him to be ""upset."" That's absurd! You could have done something sooner and you chose not to.

My bf is angry at this point he doesn't talk to the guy and instead walks away from the situation. 

And to my disbelief, as we walk off towards our car, THE BARBACK has now followed us and is trying to FIGHT MY BF. This guy left his JOB to follow PAYING CUSTOMERS, so that he could threaten and attempt PHYSICAL ALTERCATION! That is absolutely INSANE!!!!!

My girlfriends and I came just after happy hour and had to wait for a table, not because they were all sat, but because they were understaffed. In a situation like this, it's not the fault of the guest; perhaps a manager should step in and help run drinks or whatnot? 

Due to the fact that they were understaffed, service was slow. When I am sitting with an empty glass of wine I shouldn't have to ""beg"" you to take my money. It kind of ruined the vibe of our night...do you stay and have another drink because the company is great or go find another bar? We  ultimately decided to have a second glass of wine.

The food was great and came out fast. We ordered the ever-so-popular Arancini and a cheese/charcuterie platter. The smoked duck was delicious and the cheese selection was nice. I would maybe suggest combining the cheese/charcuterie on one plate, or serving the cheese on a smaller plate as it not only made the dish appear smaller, but there was barely enough room for 3 of us to eat at our hightop. We each had a small share plate, glass of wine and glass of water...nothing too crazy. 

When it came time to pay the bill the server, along with most of the guests, disappeared. Had it still been packed I would have been a little more understanding. It's almost common sense that after you drop off a check you should check back within a few minutes...

UPDATE: Tried this place again on a Thursday evening and took 10 minutes to be acknowledged/same slow service. They do have great happy hour deals so it's hard to resist coming every once in a while.",Ru3XlA1NeRAYgtE0KUK7tg,5,0,3,Ja8AGy3SfE8OHClmR1agCA

- An elegant, comfortable, cozy place for happy hour (3:30-7:30, DAILY), either at its classy bar or in the attractive patio by the courtyard. It has an EXTENSIVE menu for drinks ($3-7 for beer, wine; 1/2 price cocktails, whiskey) and bar dishes ($3-6)!

- See menu on this link:
http://www.lvhhtime.com/double-helix-wine-and-whiskey-lounge-happy-hour.html
 
DETAILS:
- There are several nice places in Town Square that I like to relax in over happy hour, and Double-Helix is among the top on my list, for its quiet ambience, great selection of drinks and bar food at very reasonable prices, as well as excellent, friendly service! It's the place of choice, when I prefer a quieter ambience; and/or when I'd like to try its whiskey special, also. Yes, they have flights of 4 different whisky combos on the menu.

- Its horseshoe-shaped bar counter is small,  but comfortable and inviting. Its beautiful display shelves showcase a great variety of whiskeys! From the bar, one can see the cozy, nicely furnished patio by the busy courtyard. The tiny dining area around the bar counter has an intimate ambience. Other than the courtyard, there is no view, however.

MY HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE:
- I enjoyed my happy hour here a couple of weeks ago. I had Stuffed Olives ($3); Arancini ($6), a Stella ($3.5); a glass of Sauvignon Blanc ($4). The olive dish came with six stuffed olives, which looked cute and were bursting with flavor! Arancini tasted a bit bland, but ok with djon muster dip.  

- A couple of gentlemen at the bar had a flight of 4 whiskey brands. I forgot the name of the flight, but remembered they said 3 of the four were absolutely superb! According to them our bartender, Jessica is an expert on whiskey. She was very friendly, efficient, and attentive to all customers. All serving staff was friendly, and helping each other out - good training and practice.

- Wish it'd have reverse happy hour, too, for the after movie crowd!

Straight to the libations.  There is a short list of outstanding, highly rated, old world and cult wines offered by the bottle at dirt cheap prices (ie the impossible to get '09 Mollydooker Velvet Glove $225.  It's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy)  There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting.

Unfortunately whiskey, scotch and bourbon drinkers are left out.  For a place named Wine and WHISKEY, you expect more than just the most common names behind the bar

The simple food is wine centric.  It all pairs well.  Props to the ""Grown-ups grilled cheese"" with its gooey, melted gruyere and smoked ham core; olive poppers (goat cheese and chorizo studded olives); and the rich mushroom arancini with a white truffle scented aioli.  The cheese and charcuterie selection is very good (thanks to a misunderstanding, I tried them all.  No one thought it was funny to serve a dish for 5-7 to ONE me huh?)

They do offer salads, sandwiches and pastas for those wanting something heavier.  Don't be surprised to find the same items at their other location, Bottles and Burgers.

Everything was just perfect.  I am a big fan of this place just because it's cozy and comfortable.  The noise level isn't drastic and annoying.  We can actually talk to the people around us.  

The bartender who served us was very knowledgeable with what we should eat and just brought out drinks that she thought we would like based on how we described our personalities.  The food she suggested since we weren't all that hungry was:

ARTISANAL CHEESE SELECTIONS
accompanied by seasonal fruits + homemade onion jam + quince paste + gourmet bread
BOUCHERON goat milk . ivory colored paste surrounded by a bloomy white rind . creamy gooey middle + claylike toward the rind  5
CHEDDAR two-year aged handcrafted with premium cow milk from small Vermont family farms + creamy mouth feel + unforgettable individuality  5
MOODY BLEU made in small batches from fresh local Wisconsin milk . delicately smoked over fruit wood to create subtle smoky undertones with hints of roasted nuts + coffee . rich + sultry + seductive  5
COMTE AOC fruity + nutty French gruyere . from the Jura Mountains in Switzerland 6
TRUFFLE BRUSCHETTO cow + sheep milk blend for extra flavor + dimension . folded with pieces of black + white truffle . sweet + tender + plenty of earthy truffle flavor 8


CHARCUTERIE SELECTIONS
accompanied by mustard + homemade pickles + artisanal bread
SPANISH CHORIZO  spicy + dry with touch of smokiness from Spanish smoked pimento 4
SALAMI TOSCANO  black pepper + touch of salt + fresh garlic + fennel 4
PROSCIUTTO  cured on the bone + aged over nine months . sliced paper thin 5
SMOKED DUCK  enjoy the layer of crudo + fat + skin on this naturally smoked Magret 5
SPICY SOPPRESSATA  rich flavors of garlic + peppercorn + paprika + fennel + red wine 6   This was awesome and definitely worth having.

Most of our drinks were beer and wine.  However, there were a few shots our bartender made us to keep the night going.  I just don't remember what they were.

Town Square is a bit of a hodge-podge. Since it's not too far away from the glitz of The Strip, one side of the street may cater more to tourists -- higher end name brands -- along with a price tag to match. The other side will have eateries, local businesses, neat-o nick-nack shops, and things like parks and splash pads; clearly geared towards the locals. 

Double Helix harmonizes the same melody as it's host: there are plenty of items, specials, and pure, unadulterated goodness to please everyone's tastes -- along with a tremendous HH menu. Locals need not be afraid of entering ""The Vortex"" that Las Vegas Boulevard can be -- the prices are always fair. 

The best way to approach a visit would be to grab some of the apps and libations during Happy Hour. Held from 3:30PM - 7:30PM, it includes some solid small plates, such as the wonderfully delicate arancini. This is a MUST for me, literally every single visit. The fried risotto fritters boast a smooth marscapone & roasted mushrooms, which are great on their own. The moment they take a slide through the truffle aioili, they transcend to another level. The crisp outside gives way to the creaminess on the inside. Dragonballs for the appetite!

The Happy Hour menu also offers half priced specials on select wines, whiskeys, and cocktails. The $4 Reisling is quite good -- a nice balance of flavors; not too sweet. The reds are also surprisingly good for the prices. These aren't bottles of Barefoot or a box under the bar.

As if this wasn't enough, they also offer some very nice beer flights with varying degrees of price and quality, and even a three course prix-fixe brunch on the weekends.

Only a few tables were full, along with some folks outside on the patio, but the crowd grew as it got later.  We didn't order food, but loved the cocktail selections.  We settled on a coconut mojito and a Sipping Southern.  Both were sweet, flavorful, and worth a second round.  As a Southern sweet-tea connoisseur, the Sipping Southern would have been better with fresh, homemade sweet tea, but good for a Las Vegas whiskey bar!

The red sangria is great and you can get it in carafes. Also, the Happy Hour food was surprisingly filling and had some pretty swanky options. Those ahi taco things are killer.

After a while more and more people started showing up and by the time we left it was pretty crowded. Our server was really nice and always on top of refills and additional orders.

5586779,2011-09-13,2,hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ,"We popped in here for Girls' Night on a Friday night because we heard about $5.00 wine tasting and various food specials. Yay! A new place, new tastes, and deals to boot. How can you go wrong?

Let's start with that part, shall we?

The service was mediocre at first, and that's being a bit generous. It was about 15 minutes before HH/tasting specials were to start and the place was not busy by any stretch. Three or four servers and two bartenders seems like plenty of staff to get this party started with some recommendations and indivualized attention and service.

Um... *flags someone down, gets acknowledged, waits a bit longer*

Let's try that again. ""wave/flag/air horn*

Hmmm...

""Oh! Hi, didn't see you (after making eye contact a few times)."" 

*sigh*

Once we began ordering it wasn't that bad. It's still a cumulative experience, however, and it was a tad slow throughout the night.

The other WTF moment came when the specials were explained. Two specific dishes and only the house wine were offered as specials. The server even admitted that the tasting was almost always the house wine. So it's not a tasting, but a special on house wine. Got it.

We ordered a couple glasses of wine to taste something new (and help us decide on a bottle) and then ordered a bottle of the collective favorite. The wine selection isn't bad. I found some new things to consider and some solid restaurant favorites. Still, for a place that is part wine bar, I have seen better lists in lesser places. Just a thought. 

We also decided on food and ordered the steak (one of the specials) and a charcuterie plate.

*This* is where it all picks up. The steak was generously portioned for a tapas/appetizer selection, had a fantastic flavor, and was perfectly tender. The charcuterie plate was fantastic. I wish there were more (quantity of each versus quantity of choice - there were lots of different flavors already represented) cheese to go with the copious amounts of meat. That is my only hangup, however, as everything was paired creatively and the small additions (gelees, fruits, nuts, etc.) were unquestionably complementary... and seasonal to boot, always a plus!

We also shared a death-by-chocolate sampler that, aside from being a diabetic coma on a beautiful plate, was done well. Various takes on sweetness, richness, and textures made it all work together and offered something for every type of sweet tooth.

Service improved a bit, as I said, as the night went on... but it was still a little too inattentive (including forgotten water, twice).

Parts of the evening were 4-4.5 stars, some were 2. Overall, a solid 3-star (maybe even 3.5), A-OK kind of place that, even if just for the charcuterie, is most likely worth a return visit.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,2,3,9vLM_g4cA_tmv8kx4TB5gQ

Starting with the horrible attitude of the hostess (shorter, dark hair, glasses) and finishing with the waitress (taller, dark hair, glasses), who completely ignored our party while chomping on her gum, it was a huge disappointment.  

After sitting for 15 minutes with no contact from her we flagged her down and asked her if we could order food.  She shook her head yes (didn't even have enough respect to speak to us).  We waited 30 minutes and she never returned to take an order.  We flagged her down again and asked for our check but she never brought it.  We had to ask another employee to bring us our check and then we went to Yard House to eat.

In a town built on hospitality it is a shame that there are people who still don't understand that they are in the ""service"" industry.  If you don't like taking care of guests then this is the wrong business for you.  The guest is the reason for your work, they are not an interruption of your work.

Service: Everyone was very attentive. Our bartender Kyle was very knowledgeable about the drinks and dishes that he suggested, and my friend and I really enjoyed talking to him.

Food: My friend and I shared 7 dishes that were all delicious. We had the aracini, lobster tacos, seared yellowfin, prosciutto, smoked duck (twice), crime brûlée cheesecake, and triple chocolate mousse. They were all very delicious, however the prosciutto was definitely on the overly salty side; wished there was at least some fruit or mild cheese to balance it out.

I stopped in here randomly because I've been meaning to check it out for awhile.  The bartender was friendly....maybe a little TOO friendly, if that is possible.  I don't like people I don't know (who are providing me with service) to address me by ""baby"" and things like that.  She was just kind of weird.

The food looked pretty wine bar standard....flat breads, charcuteries, cheeses, etc.  I didn't eat, but it looked good.

I had 2 glasses of red wine, and when I received my check, it was a bit more than I was expecting.  The bartender explained that the price I was expecting was for 1/2 glasses and I was getting full glasses (I didn't realize this was an option, and would have MUCH rather had the 1/2 glass).  It was, of course, on the menu, so it was my mistake.  However, it would have been nice if she would have clarifyed this with me when I ordered.  She was more interested in other patrons, who she apparently knew and were ordering shots.

Also, they didn't have a closing time listed on the door, and there was a pretty good sized crowd in the place....but they just decided to close at Midnight.  Suddenly they were telling everyone it was last call.  Again, weird.

I think that the food is a little pricey for the portion sizes you receive and it's hard to convince myself the $12 is worth it for the martinis with Blue Martini being right up the stairs where I can get 1/2 off just for being in the industry.

I had a GREAT happy hour experience here with a girlfriend on a Friday afternoon.  I ordered the whiskey of the month, Collingwood, a maple wood Canadian whiskey.  I got to sample some first and it was exceptionally smooth with a minimal nose burning alcohol scent common to many whiskeys. I was a fan! 

Foodwise, we ordered the chickpea hummus and the BBQ pork sliders.  The hummus was delicious and had a perfect consistency.  The BBQ pork sliders were so good!  The buns were soft but toasted on the inside.  The pork was moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  There was a wonderful apricot sauce and the chipotle slaw had a lovely tame flavor to it as well. All the flavors worked together really well. Both dishes were excellent for bar food.

The bar is sized well and the entire lounge had an adequate amount of tables and bar seats.  They also have a few large tables available to support bigger groups.  They also have outdoor seating available.  Double Helix offers a comfortably warm ambiance.  There are only two single stalls bathrooms though, so I found myself waiting for the restroom a couple times.

They use Rockbot, an app that lets patrons select music in the bar.  They had an awesome playlist that night with Florence, Imagine Dragons, and some of my other favs.

Our server was Kelly and she provided wonderful service.  Our water glasses were always full and we had drink orders in before our drinks were empty. 

All in all, great happy hour and great price.  For 3 glasses of whiskey, 1 glass of pinot noir, and the BBQ pork sliders, I paid $32.  Not bad at all.  I'll definitely go back with some girlfriends or go here on date night.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,4,2,5,ovHmt-_1UFohcVsRBGkUNQ

Just sit at a table because the cocktail waitresses give better service than the bartendenders. The guy who wears a kilt is rude, and one of the girl bartenders (blonde, there for a long time, knowledgeable but ehh) is so fake that it almost ruins your evening. They need to work on caring for their guest because everything else in the restaurant is great. I would recommend this place though.",57pxt-GiqJwqXLpho1wEHw,0,0,2,vamUdCMiCswLnUvTbOs0RQ
