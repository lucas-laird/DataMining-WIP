My boyfriend and I sat at the counter waiting for our food while she goes to the back and we constantly hear laughing and little squeals like she is obviously messing around. She comes flying out of the back like someone is trying to throw something at her and she is running from it, in fact screwing around. She goes back and gets a bucket of water and stands on a step stool to clean the top of a machine. She is taking her sweet time yet constantly complaining how the manager or owner wants the employees to clean a ton of stuff to the cook (Richard which was the only name I got because she constantly kept saying his name). An older lady was already running around doing a ton of things including taking orders since the younger lady stopped doing so. While complaining about all the cleaning they have to do, she says out loud to where customers can hear, ""Well she's not doing anything"" which was very obviously untrue since we were listening and watching. The only person not doing anything was in fact herself. 
The older lady gets us our food, gives us straws and is very polite about it. She even checks up on us after awhile to asks how everything is. Very hard worker. A good 25-30 minutes later, when we are almost done eating, this younger girl is still cleaning the same machine. Not even different parts, just still wiping down the top of the machine and talking to the cook.Now she is complaining, ""I just want to go home. Can I go home Richard?"" over and over. Finally I guess he tells her to leave and she VERY LOUDLY says, ""Shut the f*** up Richard!"" then realizes how loud she said it and starts laughing about it then just over and over again is saying ""Shut up"" and laughing. Doing absolutely nothing but getting paid for screwing around.
The food was very good, the customer service from the older lady was amazing, but I absolutely wouldn't recommend this Johnny Rockets in Mandalay Bay if the younger lady is there while constantly screwing around and cursing very loudly to where many different customers can hear then complaining about other people doing nothing when she did absolutely nothing except take one order.",ccHJ_felEwnJEW9w4jwYpw,0,0,3,jeLYPTu2i56O9a0AXI9evg

The cashier was not friendly. After 15 minutes, I saw my order come up. It sat there, and sat there, until a girl placed it in a bag and then punched in my buzzer number. I was already at the counter before she activated my buzzer. As I handed her the blinking buzzer, she promptly turned around and busied herself with other matters for about 3 more minutes. Then she finally brought the bag to me without so much as a thank you, sorry for the wait, nothing. A convention was getting out for lunch. By the time I got my food, the line was 50 deep behind me.
