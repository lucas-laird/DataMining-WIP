Other choices in the food court would almost costing you as much as just walking over to Monte Carlo and getting the brunch buffet there.

The prices are just slightly higher than normal McDonalds you would find outside of the strip.     They have a 20 piece Chicken McNuggets for only $6  (normally $4.99 at other McDonalds).

The dollar menu is pared down - but you still get a chicken sandwich for $1.  

The best deal, as stated by P.T., is the 2 apple pies for $1 -- this is the exact same price you would pay at any normal McDonalds and is great for a light snack should you become very hungry and your dinner reservation is still hours away at any of the restaurants there.",FQAR1kfRl0SSqrUQ_mYTdQ,1,0,4,ReVh4fr-k2O2VrnKxIjngw

The service was fast and friendly. I felt sorry for the guy at the register as person after person, including myself, came up and ordered a lunch item and he had to explain it was breakfast only at this time. Well, he did so, very patiently. Kudos for being at work at that hour and having an awesome attitude! Note the only people in line at that time of the morning have been partying all night in the club and, like myself at the time, are a bit delirious and be all appreciated his patience with us.

The place has a huge line at all hours and is in the hyper trendy new food court. Great vibe, abundant people watching and good lighting. CLEAN!

Enjoyed a loaded crispy yard bird sandwich, medium pomme frittes and diet pop. Delicious!

Bonus was making a frisky friend!",8v3aEuuHEJU_8h0OgmsfDA,13,10,5,8o4mYnqfoAErujNQdVBVZA
3656388,2014-08-03,1,V9eIbZwaOJ7YeMy5bPVm6w,"If you are at MGM food court, this is the most reasonably priced option. They still have their usual dollar menu items, which is far and away cheaper than any other restaurant in the food court. I mean, I live Nathan's hotdogs, but $10 bucks for a dog is ridiculous!! 

I remember when Vegas used to be known for their inexpensive buffets as a way to draw gamblers to their establishments. But, those days are long gone and the consumers are the ones who suffer. Kudos for McDonalds to maintain their everyday pricing and not gouging us!! 

Food is typical, but you always know what your in for when you eat at the Golden Arches.",9b5V1QRwySzqOPlXIGipTA,2,1,4,XtUE_Hb4E9_mTbVvt_eB7A
5183333,2014-08-18,1,V9eIbZwaOJ7YeMy5bPVm6w,"I came at 2:30am after the club- and no I wasn't drunk. I got excited seeing they had breakfast items on their menu ""til 4"". When I went to order, the cashier lady RUDELY told me they didn't have breakfast. I pointed to the menu that clearly read ""til 4"" and she RUDELY said it was a generic menu and they were not a participating location. 

This is unacceptable. Getting so many people's hopes up that they can order McDonalds breakfast in the middle of the night. 

It took a long time to receive my small meal. When I got it I asked for certain dipping sauces and the lady RUDELY answered they were out of every one I asked for. I asked for ketchup she told me to go down in front of Nathan's to get ketchup. But right before I saw her give a man ketchup packets. I get to the ketchup stand and there's no ""to go cups"". I saw a girl w to go cups and she said the lady at McDonald's gave them to her. I was completely outraged and irritated w mcdonalds. 

I understand employees deal with a lot of drunk people but that's doesn't allow room for rude customer service behaviors to paying customers. 

They got 2 stars bc the food was good.",D_xYNiL2c1G-gVzRmKY5yw,1,0,2,dCygf8ZV8X2JCRp9fwYuEw
5398366,2014-01-22,0,V9eIbZwaOJ7YeMy5bPVm6w,"The usual McDonald's food and prices with fast and friendly service. Go here in the morning for coffee rather than the nearby Starbucks and it's faster and cheaper. $1 for a hot coffee or around $2 for an iced coffee. This leaves you with a few more $ in your pocket you can lose, er, use at the casino.",j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw,2,0,3,VU9PAo7nGcmnkBY0aQ-fQA
5675471,2014-01-17,0,V9eIbZwaOJ7YeMy5bPVm6w,"Typical McDonald's, located in the food court at the MGM Grand.  

Prices are reasonable and no higher than any free standing location and they are open 24 hours.

Cashiers are reasonably friendly, considering what they have to deal with most times (crazy, out of control drunk people).  They offer an employee discount the MGM employees - it's not a lot, but it's better than nothing.

The only thing of note is that breakfast is not available 24 hours (like most McDonald's locations) - but starts at 4am.

It always seems like the food is ready quicker than anywhere else I've been.  Not sure if that is good or bad!

Basically, if you are too cheap to dine at the other late night option (Wolfgang Puck's), this is a good choice.  Especially if you are just getting back from the club.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,0,3,S9_Ya3A8VaIdmiG0x0Oj9A
5962872,2014-02-04,3,V9eIbZwaOJ7YeMy5bPVm6w,"Much lower than the competition.   Friendly customer service.

We had the sweet chili chicken wrap for $3.99 (without the meal) and 2 apple pies which were on sale for $1.

This is the best option at this food court.  Everything else is so overpriced.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,4,1,3,eGNj_4dZPvz5RJRKnu27dg
