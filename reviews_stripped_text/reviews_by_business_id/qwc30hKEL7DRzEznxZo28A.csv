The the place was full to capacity and yet as busy as the wait staff was they got the food out fast and stay cool calm and collected the whole time. My table was checked on several wait staff while I was dining. They were all extremely friendly and hospitable. I wish there was a way to give the more than five stars however they get all five stars in this rating system. This is a method of feasting that I am so happy we have on this planet. It was like being in the Garden of Eating.,0a3W1FqShPPf2lrjkXUT6A,0,0,5,56znYc43JUM1VcJxiKfKcw

3405504,2018-04-14,3,qwc30hKEL7DRzEznxZo28A,"This place definitely AYCE the sushi! 

Pricing: It's pretty similar to all the other AYCE sushi places. 

Location: It is hidden. Not in the greatest area since it is being covered by a bar, i believe? Asides from that, they are pretty much against Gorilla Sushi since it is down the street. 

Service: They were welcoming and nice. They checked up on us often for any additional orders. Refilled our waters. Overall, very attentive with our table. 

Food: PROBABLY THE BEST AYCE SUSHI PLACE EVER. I loved every bite of what i ordered. They tasted great and different. Their appetizers were amazing. The list is long. Try the oyster shooter, calamari, monkey ball, mushroom cap and miso soup. You won't be disappointed. The oyster shooters was bomb! It was citrusy and refreshing. 
The calamari was crispy af. Dip it with the sauce it comes and it brings you heaven. Now the monkey ball and mushroom cap were similar. Monkey ball is just spicy and fried. I loved both! Then the miso soup wasn't so salty like the others. 
Asides from the appetizers, I definitely enjoyed their Golden Philly and their Baked Lobsters. 
They were both rich with flavor. I feel like their sauces are different. I've never tasted a few of the sauces that were topped with my sushi at other sushi places. 


Dessert wise: Try their fried ice cream. It was good. Crispy and fruity pebble liked. Some fried ice cream taste like canola oil. Not this one.

Last but not least: VISIT ON APRIL 20th for 9.95 AYCE sushi. How could you not attend that special day deal!?",hPoyOGAnbjJ6IKbJQ1UABQ,4,2,5,wsjw5GVC9mHEIt5Hza1cEA

As it was slow the service was pretty on point, but once a few more people came in our server seemed all over the place. We had put in an order for 4 different half rolls, 2 came out in about 5 minutes.  And after waiting for about 15 minutes I had asked our server about the other 2 rolls, she said it should be coming out, but apparently they lost our paper with the order on it.  Also some of our order was being served to the wrong table.  With that being said, since they've only been open for a month I guess they are still trying to get a hang of things.  In time, hopefully their service and organization will improve.

Otherwise the food was good. Prices were comparable to other AYCE sushi places.

I'm not crazy about their garlic sauce/ponzu, but the fish was delicious, and very fresh. I usually order very traditional sushi so not having a roll with ponzu sauce doesnt bother me.

When I saw the menu it looked familiar. They have another store call Sushi 21 or something... This is when I had the ""oh crap"" moment..

Didn't have good memory from Sushi 21 and Sushi Cruise is the same. Fish on the nigiri is like frozen, defros,  frozen and defrost again. Soft, soggy fishes....

5354855,2018-06-06,3,qwc30hKEL7DRzEznxZo28A,"I wish I could go in the negative. Seriously it was catastrophically horrendous. I've tried oh, 30-40 sushi places across the valley. I've even eaten at this location multiple times before when it was under the previous 2 owners. Sushi on Trop was a 3/5 Tomo was a 4/5. This place is maybe a -16/5. Where to begin. First off admittedly, I am embarrassed to have brought my mother and girlfriend here. Utterly humiliated. We walk in, and are met by a waitress who I am going to assume had never waited tables before in her life. Tripped over her own feet showing us to the table (nervous I can understand) She stuttered through their specials (I saw her eyes dart to the menu board she hadn't even memorized them) and when she was taking our orders, anything more than 2 items was met with, ""hold on please, I'm still writing"" My mother took this as rude but I am banking on inexperience. The waitress multiple times had to pause, take the paper to the chef, and get a second piece of paper to continue taking orders. We ordered maybe 4-5 things at a time, over 3 people I don't think that's too much. Seriously, get a real notepad and learn shorthand. I won't rag on her all day, just hope she is a quick study. On to the food, besides the fish having a poor smell (anyone who knows fish knows if there's any smell at all the fish is bad) We ordered a scallop nigiri, we were delivered a nigiri with a scoop of imitation crab and maybe 2 scallops thrown on top as if to hide it. Like oh don't worry we're only eating it, we won't know what's inside.... They also drenched (read flooded) everything in far too much vinegar. If you've made sushi before, you know that to make sushi rice the right stickiness you need a special sushi vinegar. The correct amount is approximately 1/2 cup of vinegar per 3 cups of uncooked rice. I think someone was a bit dyslexic and used 3 cups of vinegar for 1/2 cup of rice. I wish I was joking, but it was that bad. 2 things I noticed that had nothing to do with the food that I despised. First, while we were there, someone had apparently ordered for delivery via ubereats. now I will say 1 thing about the waitress, when we arrived, 2 white people and 1 asian person, she was  very polite and all smiles, ""Hi! How many? Can I get you a table?"". The uber driver walks in, happens to be black, and before he can say anything is met with, ""Uh, can we help you??"" in a FAR from polite tone. I found that to be incredibly unprofessional and downright BS. As if that wasn't enough, another gentleman came in and sat at the bar, and while he was treated nicely(as he was asian) there were two men outside whom we saw going from car to car trying to open people's doors. We notified the staff, made sure our door was locked, and nobody cared. Then when the guy at the bar noticed his car alarm going off, we heard the chef directly tell him oh, sometimes people drive by with loud music, the speakers probably set off your alarm. WTF?!? I had to go tell the guy flat out it wasn't some speaker bs, people are out there trying doors and you better make sure your car is locked and windows are up. I don't know if the staff were in on it or just plain didn't give a sh$%^ about what happened to anyone there. Not only will I never return, but I absolutely recommend keeping many miles between you and this place. -16/5 might be too generous!",3a8JVsABTdbJ8pLVX-Dcsw,3,2,1,IgJ8rGwAawQYrDU6uc-bLQ
5386273,2018-04-26,3,qwc30hKEL7DRzEznxZo28A,"Went in for their grand opening special of $9.95 AYCE on 4/21/18. Arrived opening time, got seated promptly. Started with appetizers crab pockets (crab rangoon) and shrimp tempura. Taste as usual. 

Next onto our main course of AYCE sushi. Ordered 4 different types of nigiri and 5 different half orders of sushi. Waited 30 mins to an hour and we only got one sushi order out if all that we ordered. Other people who came in minutes after us were getting there order nonstop and we had nothing at all but one plate. 

I made a complaint and asked another waiter what the heck was going on, we haven't received nothing. Our waiter did not even bother to check up on us at all. Multiple waiters were taking orders and so confused as to what table those orders be delivered. Guests next to us were also waiting, so ridiculous! A different waiter went ahead to retake our order and we lost total patience, waited and waited more. So we decided to not support a penny and we took our business elsewhere. Never have I experienced such horrible, and unorganized Japanese AYCE sushi in Vegas. Sushi cruise was overhyped with their grand opening special. I have decided to continue eating at my fave AYCE sushi over on Spring Mtn. as they are better with their prompt customer service, and presentable quality of food.  

This same day I also shared this special they had going on to friends and fam but immediately told them not to come after our horrible experience. 

To further a successful outcome with your business, you must get organized and be professional with your guests. I've been a waitress before and matter of fact we all are customers... who wants to wait almost an hour for AYCE sushi order? Menu specifies 90 min eating limit also. Does not make sense. You will not get your money's worth here at all folks! Be advised to go elsewhere! It is not at all possible to rate with no stars so the 1 star rating ain't true.

I find with most sushi places it's about the nigri, the cut and preparation in which Sushi Cruise was good but not outstanding or close to the best I've ever had.

The service is not why I plan on visiting Sushi Cruise again. I understand a marketing and grand opening can be used as a stress test and exposure but what we saw were definite areas for improvement.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,2,0,2,HoK8fZkMwMGV-nYmbM5zBg
