I grabbed a carne asada burrito without beans and it came out a little hot but was freshly cooked. The meat was amazing and had good flavor. The owner lols like she is by herself and I could imagine a longer wait during a lunch rush.

It's cash only or they have an ATM next door.",gqUiphY0G0ZAujZzbA6HWw,1,0,5,mDhSgy773TPy2nE-Ea4-SA

This place is very similar to other Mexican fast food spots. The first time I came I had the carne asada burrito which has meat, rice, beans and cheese. My burrito also came with fresh tortilla chips. The burrito was a decent size, tasty and filling. They were just opened for a couple days so they did not have a salsa bar, but the owner brought me out a couple bottles of homemade salsa for me to use. It was very good.

My last visit, I came back and ordered the sopes, which is a type of flat gordita. It has meat, lettuce, pico and sour cream. I wanted to try the al pastor this time. I was enjoying one of the sopes when I pulled a long black hair out my mouth! I immediately lost my appetite after that. I noticed that the owner does not wear a hairnet. I brought the hair to her attention and she offered to remake the food, but I declined. I really didn't care for the pastor anyway, it was not very good. I am sad to say I probably will not be returning. The food is good though and this is a locally owned shop, which I love to support, but I can't get past the hair.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,1,2,39kYdxXAXOpI5rj_Uh10mA

The price is good too considering how large the portions were (definitely one of the biggest tortas I have ever had). This taqueria is definitely one of the best in town!,vicuUt89svl20s-qm7G3hA,0,1,5,_MGj5u72DBm-OVurH5U4eQ
