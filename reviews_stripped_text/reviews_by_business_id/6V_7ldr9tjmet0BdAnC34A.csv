If you're a horse person you will be amazed at what they do. The horses are around explosions, and have people jumping on and off them, and gallop at full speed at other horses while jousting and they don't even blink. Whoever trained them is very talented.
Our server Bernie was nice and the dinner was tomato soup, a cornish hen, broccoli, potato wedges, a roll, and an apple turnover that looked like a Mcdonalds pie. It was just okay.

You're obviously not going for the food so I'm not going to bother repeating what everyone has already said about the game  hen, lack of utensils, etc.

The show, on the other hand, was entertainingly cheesy.  They very smartly divide the crowd into countries (and Dragon) so that everyone has a 'king' or 'czar' to cheer on.  I was 'Irish' that night and fortunately the Irish king was pretty hot so it wasn't hard to cheer him on.

I was surprised at how caught up I and everyone else got caught up in the whole show.  It's not like you can't figure out how it's going to end, but it really was very well done.  I was particularly impressed with the choreography, they clearly spent a lot of time practicing to make it look as realistic as they could.  

It's a little pricey, but if someone were to treat me (again), I'd go back.  Huzzah!

The food was just ok, the hen was too dry, the broccoli had no flavor. the soup was pretty good as was the pastry.

The chicken had alright flavor, although it was a little dry, and the other food on the plate was cooked properly but lacked seasoning.

Also, children 2 and under can be ""lap babies,"" which is awesome because they don't cost anything, but toddlers do eat food. It would be nice if they would offer the opportunity to purchase an extra meal so the little ones can have food, too. Luckily for us, my 8 year old doesn't eat much, so our 2 year old was able to finish hers off.

The theater felt both large and small, and I felt that any seat would provide a good view of the whole show regardless of location.  A big plus!  We had front row seats, and it was worth the extra money (which wasn't very much either).  

The performers were entertaining, the  stunts impressive and the pyrotechnics were very fun and a definite highlight.  This is a show I would recommend to people of all ages.  I can see children being absolutely delighted by the entire show and environment, and even as an adult it is an absolute riot.  Also, know that the show is just over an hour long.  Depending on your tastes that may be a tad short, but for the price I feel it is not a real issue.  I would have liked a bit of a longer show personally, but that was mostly because I was having such a good time I didn't want it to end.  

The only complainant I have is that my chair was slightly broken and didn't sit at the proper angle.  It wouldn't stay up fully and slumped downed, making sitting difficult.  I was able to adjust the chair on my large calves and sit alright, but not everyone could have managed that.   Perhaps a bit of slight maintenance is in order.

The food consists of a tomato and basle soup as a starter, a roasted chicken served with potatoes  broccoli, and a biscuit, then last a small apple pie, a good meal to go with a good show.

The show it's self was a funny take on a medieval, 16 century festivals showcasing several different European countries section off by the audiences seating. Each country has a knight that participates in a collection of games. in these games the plot develops by the introduction of the villain a sorta dragon knight. The show its self can get corny with the jokes and bedazzled costumes. but like i mentioned your not here to take this serious and there are a good few laughs and action moments, not to mention some good looking male actors.

The food was pretty darn tasty. The tomato soup they start you with was excellent and the main course was just as good. The cornish game hen was perfectly seasoned and very moist. As were the potatoes and the broccoli (which had parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. Mmmmm). It also comes with a biscuit, which is, well... a biscuit. You've had one, you've had them all. Dessert consists of an apple strudel type pastry that was surprisingly good.  Of course the whole schtick of eating without utensils just adds to the fun. Don't worry though, they include a napkin and a large wet nap with your meal.

The show was excellent and while obviously heavily choreographed, the fighting and jousting was fun to watch. We sat in the Dragon section and therefore rooted for the bad guy which was fun too! The special effects and pyrotechnics were great, especially the evil wizards flame throwing staff. You could feel the heat from that thing  sitting in the stands!

I'm giving this show 5 stars. Its well worth seeing at least once and a great choice if you want to take the kids.

One word of advice though: PARTICIPATE!!!  Don't be shy! Slap the table with your hands, cheer for your sections knight and boo the opposing knights as they ride by on a horse (they'll point at you and give you the neck slice gesture!)

I attended this with a couple of friends who were on holiday the same time we were, and it was totally worth it! You just have to forget that it's kind of lame for adults and be a kid again. 

When we sat down, we were given a choice between Sprite or Dragon Juice (which apparently tastes like Pepsi)...who knows why they didn't give Sprite some sort of magical name, haha. Then was a tasty warm bowl of tomato soup, which was kind of like Campbell's soup, but it was surprisingly good & satisfying! I wish I had a spoon though, because I was wearing white & I was afraid I'd spill it all over myself.

The show began with Merlin coming out to introduce the show & warm up the audience with getting us to cheer (""huzzah!""), and the main course of cornish game hen, broccoli, potato & biscuit was served. I don't know about you, but I prefer to eat birds with my hands. Then I can get all the little pieces of meat! Mmm! It was a bit big for me though, so I didn't finish, but it was tender and juicy, & I loved the seasoning.

The show was loud and showy, complete with pyrotechnics, jousting & songs. I had a ton of fun cheering wildly for our country's king (Russia), as he fought dirty & was great eye candy, haha.  Oh yeah, most of the actors are good looking! :D

Then at the end, we had apple turnover (I just ate the apple inside, but not the pastry part). It was kind of like toaster strudel, which doesn't sound that great, but it was alright, heh. Kids will like it. Hey, I admit I eat pop tarts sometimes. Who doesn't like sugar?

Anyway, I might go again if I return to Vegas, but I hear they're knocking down Excalibur one of these years, so maybe they won't have it anymore. :(  Sad!",8E70bp8UyHzcVbqW8z3t3g,2,2,4,NEUtHujO1CJ0gNs6xGupzA

The show: The acting was cheesy, but so much fun. The sword play was surprisingly fast and exciting. The tournament games were fun. The wenches dancing around and acting as cheerleaders for the kings were a particularly good touch. 
Seating everyone in different sections for different countries is awesome. Giving them someone to root for makes for a much more enjoyable time. 

The food: The first course, tomato soup, was easily the best tomato soup I've ever had. The second course, a game hen and some veggies, was decent. The meat was good and the biscuit was delicious. I didn't eat much of the desert.

Soprano's Last Supper had it as part of their show; now you have to splurge at the overpriced italian restaurant at the Riveria to have the dinner & show combination.

Tournament of Kings is a great show that had the added benefit of a meal while you are entertained.  I know there are many other places like this throughout the United States, but this is the only one I have ever seen.  The food is usually a cornish game hen, potato wedges, broccoli and a roll.  You can get a free water or soda, but for a few dollars more you can get a mixed drink with a souvenier mug (see pictures).

The show itself is fairly entertaining in a campy Knights of the Round Table kind of way.  Kings from around the globe compete to serve King Arthur against Mordred and his dragon knights.  Merlin entertains the crowd at first, getting everyone excited for the show.  Mordred's entrance is intense as is the entrance of his knights on horseback.

Not expecting much more than knights fighting and decent food (not spectacular, but you'll leave with a full stomach), you can enjoy this show as a good time for not a lot of money.  The cost is around $54.00 per person...for dinner & a show, you can't really beat that price.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,1,1,4,uyMVMG1UGUV_j07-DNVrYw

I just don't see how the receipts for the show could work out with the massive overhead they must have with horses, trainers, performers, servers, food prep, etc.  The sword fights are amazing, and the acrobats at the end steal the show!  Two men put a long board, maybe 12 feet, on their shoulders and then this lady gets on it and they THROW her in the air, she does a flip or two and then lands back on the board like a balance beam.  Seriously, Olympic gymnasts don't hit their marks as consistently as this lady did.  AMAZING and from the crowds applause, you could tell they were appreciated.  

My husband took me here August of 2009 to celebrate my 31st birthday (part of a multiple day extravaganza of dates).  The food was the tomato soup, chicken, broccoli, roll, potato wedges, and apple fritter as previously described.  The soup is wondermous, the rest was better than my low expectations.  What do you expect for eating with your hands?  My chicken was not dry, and I ate a lot of it!  The portions were huge...so you don't get shorted there!  Yes, you could get better food elsewhere, but this is dinner and a show for $40 in Vegas. (Military Discount)  I'm not sure on kids prices.

The children and bachelor/bachelorette parties in the crowd were obviously having a whale of a time.  We passed on the $20 official photo, and also the light up swords and merlin hats, but the kids and bachelors were eating them up.

Let me say: I tried really hard to have a good time and appreciate the effort it took to perform the show...and so I did have a good time.  The food service blocked my view occasionally, but I rolled with it.  The horses are amazing, and I say this as someone who grew up around the horse show/rodeo scene.  The plot line of the story is of course extremely cheesy and you are watching a choreographed show...entirely scripted.  Kids will have the best time, and adults will enjoy watching the kids having a great time.  Groups, especially large family groups with Grandparents all the way down to kids will also have a great time.  

Kid tip:  Disney World makes a better vacation for children...Excalibur is not Disney despite the castle.  You can make it work...but this is still an adult playground.   If you do happen to be in Vegas with children...cover their eyes (or yours!) past the Excaliber Party Pit because they have go-go dancers performing now on the betting tables.  Fun for adults; but I saw a 4 yr old with eyes like saucers.  Go directly downstairs to the Arcade and take your kids to Tournament of Kings.  The cast of the show greets you as you exit the show, and they take their time to thank you and pose for photos.  Then take your kids to the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, and check out some gold mining experiences...come back another time for yourself.",Cni3J27qztOoyGZRt_0SPQ,0,1,3,CXk09FYqsYl8z7uoJAQFEA

One star off because I wouldn't watch this again.

I feel that this is a show you would only watch once. No need to watch it again. But this doesn't mean I wasn't a fan of the show. The kings/horsemens and horses were pretty awesome. I wasn't actually more fascinated by the horses than the knights/kings.

My boyfriend & I bought two tix from the tix4tonight stand. $40 per ticket including dinner. Not bad. 

We got there a little bit late. I think 5 minutes after the show started. We were sitting at section A in Austria. I was pretty stoked bc we were sitting at the front. The show is fairly long and entertaining. They try to get the audience involved as much as they can. They got be kazaaa-ing and boo-ing with the entertainers. It only part that sucked was that even though we were sitting close to the stage, the king was facing us so sometimes we weren't able to see what was going on.

The food was much better than I expected. I agree with everyone - the tomato soup was probably the better part of the meal. I don't even LIKE tomato soup and I actually finished mine off. Also, you will eat with your hands. So WASH your hands prior to the show. I was kind of surprised they didn't give you wash cloths before you ate since there weren't any utensils. The entree wasn't bad, you get full small sized chicken with broccoli and potatoes.  Desert was an apple pie. And full pitcher of water. Hah. I think it's like $5 bucks for a mug of beer or something.

I have to give it to the performers. Their performances were flawless and the jousting looked surreal. But seriously - the horses were intelligent as hell. They were trained on point for every move. Also, the horsemens were very nice at the end because they made sure we were clapping for the horses too! :P

I've been to Medieval Times a couple times and I didn't enjoy that very much. However, my fiance loves this sort of stuff and has never seen anything like it so we decided to go.

I had a great time. The show was so much fun to watch, and the audience is small enough so that you don't feel lost in the crowd, but large enough so you really feel a positive presence when everyone's cheering.

The actors were very charismatic and very good at bringing the audience into it. The servers were incredibly friendly and delightful to talk to. The food was fantastic. I'm a vegetarian so at first I was afraid that I would get some disgusting eggplant dish like they offer at Medieval Times, but I got a delicious plate of pasta (fork and all!), fresh vegetables, delicious potatoes, a biscuit, and a bowl of godly tomato soup. Oh man that soup was good. My fiance said his cornish game hen was excellent as well.

They have free soda or diet soda, as well as a menu of alcoholic drinks you can purchase. On the menu was a souvenir mug for $18 but for some reason we were only charged $14. That was fine with us. You can get it filled with beer, daiquiris, margaritas, etc. It was a pretty big mug; almost everyone in France purchased one.

Some people said they were worried about dirt getting in their food. We sat in the second row, maybe the first row is much different but I felt no fear of that.

There were a few very large booms that scared the bejeezus out of us. It was hilarious.

The only complaint that I have is this: Before the show someone goes around with a camera taking your picture, then they bring it to you blown up on a small cardboard frame and leave it at your station. They did this without saying anything. I was silly enough to assume that was ours to keep. I was utterly devastated when, at the end of the show, they came back around and told us it would be $20 to keep this picture pasted onto a piece of cardboard. I know we paid half price, but people pay as much as $70 a ticket and they want $20 more for something they're going to throw out anyway? I think that should have been worked into the price of the ticket, or at least have been considerably cheaper. Or, at the VERY least, we should be told beforehand that we can't just keep it so as not to get our hopes up. I can't tell you how disappointed I was about that.

I probably wouldn't go out of my way to see the show again - like others have said, once you've seen it once, you've seen it a thousand times - and I don't know if I'd have gone if I'd have had to pay $70, but if you can get tickets on the cheap then I recommend it, definitely, especially if you have kids.",R4kzxO9q31DmW1Ib63Jsnw,2,0,4,kjW9LBCjdV_mtLtXlwxMpg

Dinner consisted of:
Tomato soup - (Dragon's Blood, ha had to give my server a notch for trying to further add to the festivities). Soup had a great flavor, great consistency. 
Main entree - Cornish hen, potatoes, broccoli, and a biscuit. Everything was well cooked and seasoned. 
Desert - Apple turnover (small nothing to brag about), was good. 
Drinks - Soda/Water (unlimited) Alcohol is extra, go for the beer bucket, get more for your money (4 for the price of 3) 

The show gets the crowd involved, cheering for the country you are seated in. Got IRELAND this run (front row), land of liquid goodness, great music, and beautiful sights (ha maybe I'm biased eh?).

Glad to have watched The Tournament of Kings here! It's cheesy and entertaining! It was well worth about $145 for two. I love the special effects, the crowd interaction, and the plot, it sure made me smile the whole way through! 

Keep this in mind: There are no bad views. So pick a side, or ""country"" to your liking.

Food was good and plentiful. I didn't get to finish my food but it was probably because I ate prior. You're served a full hen, broccoli, two mini potatoes, and an apple crisp for dessert.

I would have to say, we wouldn't have chose to come to this show, if we didn't have our child with us.  It is one of the only family oriented shows in Vegas.  I have seen plenty of other adult shows that are much better for the price.  The tickets were a little steep at $67/each, but our son enjoyed it and it was a nice evening out.  The food was better than expected.  Yes, everyone raved on yelp about the ""Dragon's Blood"" soup, and I have to agree, it was pretty tasty.  Even my picky 6 year old, who has never tried tomato soup, ate his entire bowl.  The next course was the cornish hen, and it had pretty good flavor too.  My husband and I were joking that it was one of the healthiest meals we had during our stay, very lean and high protein.  The little purple potatoes on the plate were not very tasty, I didn't touch my scary looking broccoli, and the dinner roll was edible.  
The show itself was non-stop, and I was afraid I would miss something while picking the meat off my hen.  Yes, there is some pretty bad lip syncing going on, but it didn't really take away from anything.  Here is what irritated me the most...the photographer.  They have a photographer come around and take pictures of your group.  She took 3 different pictures of our family and we actually liked one of the pictures, but it looks like any other generic picture.  It has nothing on it about where it was taken, just a picture of the 3 of us sitting in our theater chairs.  So, for $35 a picture, we passed.  Well, this made the photographer mad.  She snatched up the pictures like she was having a hissy-fit and stormed off; very poor behavior.  I'm sure she works on commission, but she shouldn't act like that.  
There are no photographs allowed to be taken during the show, but afterward your ""King"" comes and will pose for pictures. You better have your patience during this, because there were people pushing through, not waiting their turn. 
Overall, I would say, if you do not have children, skip the show.  If you choose to go, sit in the Dragon section, if you like the bad guys. Otherwise pick any section in the middle for the best view. There was one section at the end, I think it was Austria (?), there was hardly  anyone sitting in it, and it really wasn't prime real estate.",yiE8adW26B-4cQwUKRD6ug,1,0,4,rcuSpTODnYS9hG3Bk6dogg

Water and soda are free. A bar menu is also available. 

I will upload a pic of the food. The chicken was very moist. It would have been nice to have some sort of sauce to tie the whole dish together (however I do realize that may or may not be compliant with the medieval (sans silverware) theme) so I ended up dipping my broccoli into the tomato soup, which tasted delicious.

Anyways, I ended up paying $109.25 per ticket for 2 shows, upgrade fee, service fee, & tax.  I guess it's good because it's for 2 shows and hey...it's Vegas.  

I thought the show was good.  We sat in Team France which we ended up winning.  Whoo Hoo!  Oh FYI: if u end up getting seated at Dragon...you're the bad guys! Boooooooo!

They have these sexy ladies cheering u on for your team.

There was a part in the show during the Coronation ceremony when a girl comes out in all red on a fancy horse.  Maybe she's the Princess or Queen or something idk.  She didn't say a word.  All she was doing was looking pretty on this horse that was prancing around for what it seemed like an hour over and over and over again.  I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty to look at but after 5 minutes you want to take a fork and poke your eyes out except there's no silverware because u have to eat with your hands.  Idky that part was so long.

Food was decent.  It was a huge serving!  Not the best but it's worth the price with entertainment.  They serve u coke or sprite which was way watered down but I get it, they have tons of people to serve so they have to prepare everything in advance even if it means the soda sits there for 20 minutes with ice.

There were some fireworks that kept going off throughout the show.  It kept scaring my 5 year old cuz it was so loud.

I could care less about the roasted chicken, which is, by the way, a waste of food considering I could only finish less than half. They should make this an option, ""Half or whole chicken?"" I'm an Asian woman for goodness sakes. But I don't mind another bowl or two or three of your creamy tomato soup. Mmmmm... mmmm... good. 

Anywho, we got the show tickets for 2 tickets at $80.00 from the buy 1 get 1 deal on MyVegas game app (trust me, it's easier to win on Blackjack). 

We walked into to the long ovalur (eclipse-shaped?) arena, which was surrounded by sections of seats divided by the countries/evils. (GO NORWAY!)

We went to the 8:30pm show and some ppl reviewed that it's best to go to an earlier show because it's cleaner but I disagree. When we went, it was clean and neat. 
1.) The best place to sit is either Ireland, Russia, France or dragon (to watch the show) they do a lot of dancing and sword fighting towards the opening so these seats you'll see everything. 
2.) The best place to sit that's near the exit where the bathroom and exits are is Ireland and Russia. The seats are long rows and you'll have to get up behind you if you need to leave. 
3.) The food was delicious. They give you soup, a whole roast chicken, broccoli, potatoes and a biscuit. (All eaten with your hands). They also had a good selection of alcohol. 
4.) The actors did a great job performing and keep you interacting most of the time. 
5.) Our waiter was very nice and did an awesome job keeping our drinks filled and cleaning our tables off. 
6.) Some ppl complained on here that the seats were hard and uncomfortable, however, not sure if they just have hard butts but the seats were cushioned and just fine.

FOOD/DRINK: $20/beer bucket (4 domestic beers) but they no longer allow you to bring your own beverages inside. Food was good, but dry on some parts of the chicken. I overheard the waitress tell someone to save the soup to dip things in. So I doused my chicken and biscuit in the soup so that the chicken would be less dry. I saw some other people bring hot sauce... really envious that I didn't sneak in some sriracha.

SHOW: Pretty entertaining show! The actors do some pretty neat stunts and are definitely competent at horse riding. However, I got very upset at a weird plot twist (spoiler below, please stop reading if you don't want to see).

SPOILER
My king died. But he's alive at the end. I'm highly confused and disturbed. I saw his throat get slit open. Then I had to cheer for my king at the end. He's a zombie king. I did not want to bow or cheer for my undead king. Also, how is my king alive? Does Merlin selectively revive people? Is he the one behind it all? T

CONCLUSION
For the price of the actors and horses and food, I think it was definitely worth the money! Better than losing it at the casinos in a matter of minutes.

The show is simply fun and very kid friendly.  And as an adult, you can't help but feel like a kid again when you see King Arthur and his Knights fighting and jousting.  Audience participation is a must and you can't help but cheer when 'your knight' is winning.

Food 3 stars, the show 5.

My first thought was this was like ""Medieval Times"".

Actually there is more to it than just knights jousting, there is a decent amount of stunts and pyrotechnics and magic with the Dragon army, so it's a bigger budget version of the Medieval Times show you see in other cities.

Food was ok, you get a tomato soup in a cup/bowl thing, a big ""bottomless"" mug for your soda/water. Your main course consists of a Cornish game hen [small whole chicken] with a few small baked potatoes, broccoli, a bun and something else I'm forgetting. For desert you get an apple turnover or a fruit bowl dish.

Service was pretty good, but there is no cutlery, you eat with your hands. Seating is arena style with servers walking between each row on a walkway bring food and drink.

The show as ...pretty typical until the half way point when things moved from jousting to some pretty good stunt choreography with hand to hand and sword/mace fighting.

The evil dragon guy shows up with a wand (flame thrower), you got fog machines, big fireballs, guys swinging from ropes, etc. 

Not bad. 

If you got kids, stick around after the show is over, the knights come out and you can take pictures with them while people are leaving.",IWyLfneOLl37s1cW0Y85jg,5,1,5,boL8cxplr6LwYm3teEDh8Q

1884920,2014-01-12,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"I am giving this 2 stars because this wasn't my choice to see this show.  Our friends were taking their kids and wanted us to join them.  I will see any show once just for the experience as a Vegas local so I can steer friends and family in the right direction.  This is a great show for kids.  All of the kids I saw really seemed to enjoy the show and got into the cheering and rooting for their country.  I thought it was way to loud.  There are fireworks and pyrotechnics so if you have a sensitivity to loud things (lots of big bangs and booms) you may not like this show.  It's very dusty so if you have allergies you may want to think twice about visiting this arena.

Go downstairs through the arcade to enter the arena.  

Service: This is a no muss, no fuss meal--This is what we have, take it or leave it kind of meal.  It's a Game Hen Chicken, Potato, Broccoli, Biscuit OR you can say ""Vegetarian"" and they will give you some sort of pasta.  I opted for the ""Vegetarian"" which was cheese ravioli, broccoli, and a biscuit the night I went.  With the ""Vegetarian"" option you do get a fork.  They don't provide any utensils with the meals and you have to drink your tomato soup from the bowl.  No spoons.  The servers have a lot of people to serve so it's a really rushed atmosphere.  I read a review that said you can request silverware but they really want you to eat with your hands.  I actually took a new plastic set of utensils I had leftover from a take-out order which probably made me the only one to have a spoon for my soup and a knife to cut my broccoli in the whole place.  

Tipping: The one thing I wondered about was tipping the food runners.  Our gal was really nice and has worked at the show for over 20 years.  We asked her about tips because we were curious what people usually do in this type of setting?  She said some people forget about them after the show or just don't leave anything.  She said that most people do leave something for them.  She pulled a $20 bill out of her pocket and said someone had given her a $20 already and dessert wasn't even out yet.  She was so delighted with her twenty dollar bill.  She was a very sweet lady.  We handed her $40..she said thanks, never looked at it, and tucked it into her pocket.  When she came back around to remove more dishes she took the time to say thank you again for the tip and that she really really really appreciated it.  They do work hard so make sure to bring some tip money with you so you can leave your server something.  

The food was surprisingly good and better than expected.  Our group all enjoyed the soup, potatoes and the chicken.  The beverages offered: Sprite, Pepsi, or Diet Pepsi served in a large plastic mug.

The best things for me were: The horse that marches, our server, and the end of the show.  Just not a show for me but still glad that we went.",5fZk-aijjsRehb_jZJRXag,3,0,2,buTumBcIXmPzhtmOyihuuA

Show:
Loved the show. The fighting from the kings were really good and it didn't seem fake as some shows would make it. But it's definitely not good enough for me to go watch it again. 

There is a photographer that comes in the beginning that takes your picture. They then put the picture in front of you for you to decide if you want to buy it for $20 or not. The thing that really annoyed me was that the photographer came in the middle of the show to ask us if we wanted the picture. I was really annoyed because the fighting was getting intense and I wanted to watch it. I really thought they would came near the end of the show to ask. Eh.

I sat in the first row and the waiter warned us that the horses might kick dirt into our food. But he would replaced it at no extra cost, which was a good thing to know. Although dirt never really got to us.

Then there is the arch villian that has a band of ""dragon soldiers"" that nearly kills off all of the kings until the hero emerges victorious.

2032464,2017-03-29,5,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"This is the story of King Arthur in his advanced years, holding a tournament where Kings from all over Europe get together to show off their various combat skills. All is well until the evil Dragon Knights come to crash the party. The fate of England now rests in the hands of Arthur's son, Prince Christopher, to defeat the Dragon Knights and thus prove himself worthy to wield the legendary sword 'Excalibur'. 
The show is hosted by the comical wizard 'Merlin' who also has a court jester running around.
All in all, we had a great time at the show. It's not sophisticated, or deep, or anything like that, but it's just simple fun. Adults can have just as much fun as the children. I went with my cousin who was visiting me from out of town, and we both claim to be adults. (haha) We both had a blast cheering for our King of Spain, although I think she had the hots for the King of Russia. Traitor. You get seated in a country's section and you cheer for your King, while you heckle the Dragon Knights. Of course, you eat with your hands and make lots of noise every time you take a swig of your grog, or bite into your food. 
Your dinner will consist of a small whole chicken, tomato soup, bread, broccoli, and a dessert pastry. Also included is a basic beverage, which is water, and soda. Anything else is extra. Even juices for kids. The food is not the greatest, but what do you want for a meal that is to be eaten with your bare hands? 
The only complaint that I had is that the wenches are kind of cold. Not into character at all. They remind me of Janeane Garofalo's character in 'The Cable Guy'. Everyone else was fantastic.
There's lots of eye candy for both men and women, so enjoy all the visuals. There are some pyrotechnics, and loud banging noises to wake your asses up, and some decent choreography (in case you are wondering if these guys are really battling to the death). You can take pics with the cast after the show is over as well.
There is always some sort of discount floating around, so don't pay full price for these tickets. Tix4tonight.com has them, mlife offers a discount, there is always somebody that has some kind of discount.

I agree with many others that this is it. In a city with billboards touting kinds of indecent puppetry its nice this show still can exist. I had read a review before going that stated the show was like a high school musical with a bigger budget.  That I think was very harsh and unjustified. I admit this is not to be confused with Cirque de Soleil; however, Cirque shows run more like twice this and do not include a meal, also viewing is much closer here and much more family friendly. The horses we're beautiful and of the entertainers were good. The costumes very nice and the show was very entertaining. Servers were very friendly and attentive.

2107898,2016-04-18,2,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"The Tournament of Kings dinner show was the highlight of our short trip to Vegas.  I am a 39 year old single dad with two teenage kids, one boy and one girl, and all three of us had the time of our lives.  I opted for the 6pm show and arrived shortly before 5:30.  Doors opened promptly, and let me tell you folks, there's really not a bad seat in the house. Even the back row isn't far from the action at all.  We were in row D in the middle section, and truly felt like kings with a perfect view of everything.

Are you expecting a lousy dinner? Prepare to be disappointed!  The food was AWESOME!  Tomato soup in a bowl was sweet and perfect temperature, eat it before it gets cold!  Everything on the main dish was perfect, right down to the buttered broccoli.  Yes, friends, you REALLY DO eat with your hands.  I wouldn't have had done it any other way.  One of the funniest things was tearing the drumsticks from the cornish game hens for my (Teenaged!) kids!  I suppose that once I got it started, they were able to fend for themselves.  Don't drink your soft drinks too quickly, you get one refill - So time your empty goblet for right after dinner.

The show - wow.  Look friends, you are going to get out of it what you put into it.  I personally was the loudest lord in the arena and gathered the acclaim of many of the royal participants. Although I have lost my voice, I have won the admiration of my prince and princess for they ave never seen their father behave in such a way.

Seating to finish, the Tournament of Kings is a 90 minute event.  

Suggestions - See the 6pm show if you can.  When we arrived the arena was perfectly clean and cool and had no trace of a previous show.  Also, make sure everyone uses the bathroom before being seated...  There is no bathroom in the arena, you have to exit into the fun dungeon and then return.  Seating suggestion; I would recommend anywhere in the middle, but if you sit at a corner you will not be disappointed either.  Participation; Get into the whole program.  Find your inner king/warrior/knight.  Cheer and applaud.  Eat, drink, and be merry!",ju26i16k5nJuKqR4G5ia6A,4,0,5,IMCr67gKq2ahzXVioelSLg

I went to the 8:30pm show since I went to another show earlier in the evening. There just so happened to be a wedding party in attendance and they were all dressed in medieval garb as maidens and knights.

Just so you know, there are no utensils given/used for the meal. They do give you a wet nap to use to clean your fingers though.

For dinner there was a tomato bisque, which was just delicious! The main course consisted of a cornish game hen, potato wedges, broccoli and a bread roll. I am a dark meat person, and the meat on the legs and thighs were fall of the bone delicious, but the breast was a bit dry. For dessert you get an apple pastry.

So when you buy your tickets you are assigned to a section in the arena, which happens to be labeled by country. I was in Russia, which just so happened to be the largest and loudest section that evening. Each country is represented by a King, or Czar in my case,  whom you cheer for during the show. The place was not packed, hence some countries had fewer people in them, but my guess is that's because I went to the later show.

There was jousting, dancing, sword fighting, an acrobatic troupe and even some pyrotechnics. It was all very entertaining and I really liked the audience participation aspect of the show.",ItgAvMKDuOODW-rvCMLp9Q,1,1,5,xblfk-MbNgKmXyLZDXH5-A

There are different sections with seating that determine which country's side you're on.  My fiancé and I got Russia.  The best seats are the ones closest to the equivalent of a 50 yard line at a football game (as a non-sports oriented individual, I just surprised myself when I typed this).

The show comes with a filling dinner as shown in other reviewer's photos.  For variety, I got the vegetarian option (ravioli) while my fiancé got the normal whole chicken.  The biscuits are delicious!  They start bringing the dinners out shortly after being seated, however if you get the ravioli it will take much longer to come out.

It says no outside food but we bought a vegan sandwich just in case.  We figured if we paid for the food and the child didn't eat it we had to have something.

It's an interesting experience as they seat you in sections that have been divided into ""countries"" and you cheer for your ""king"" as they joust and fight.

I would totally go back again so I can cheer for my king. About the only place you can shout ""CUT OFF HIS HEAD!!!"" at the top of your lungs without people giving you weird looks.",xa7kmJoYo8UTscofeBVUGg,1,1,4,PTqqczf85OXT6ldN1hm_rg

Everyone has seen those medieval dinner shows in the movies (The Cable Guy had one). They look a little corny in the movies but, you know what? They're a lot of fun in person!

I attended the Tournament of Kings a few years ago on a family vacation, and it was quite a hoot. Everyone is seated around a large pit, so it's sort of like a miniature medieval colosseum. Servers dressed as maids bring you your meal which is a small chicken (an entire chicken for one person!), broccoli, and a bun. You also get a large drink in an authentic medieval stein. 

As you eat, a tournament is enacted in the pit for the 100 or so people to watch. It depicts kings of various medieval kingdoms fighting each other in a tournament. Different seating areas are designated as kingdoms and you have to cheer on your assigned king during to meal to make him perform better. The ultimate victor is basically determined by which crowd cheers on their king the loudest. When we attended, our king was the winner, which was cool! I won't spoil what happens after that because it was pretty unexpected, but it very cool.

The show has great costumes, live horses, fantastic sound, and impressive effects. Highly recommended for anyone in Vegas, it must be experienced at least once.",2Wuo0OosaIf1bvybBRRtyA,0,0,5,ZRjRmoCdhr0dxS3j18h00w

The show is HIGHLY choreography. The actors are lip syncing to an audio track that is playing which makes it kinda of cheesy, but fun for kids. There is a lot of audience participation in terms of cheering and raising glasses. The fight scenes are choreography with added sound effects. There is a lot of smoke and flames which can make it fun for the families.

I originally bought six tickets, but had an addition to our party, and they were able to switch our tickets to a different row and add another ticket on without any issue. We sat in the second row of the Ireland section and it was great. The venue is quite small, so there really isn't a bad seat in the house.

Dinner was good. Wash your hands beforehand, since they don't have any utensils and they only give you one wet wipe to clean up with. You can request a special kids meal with chicken tenders and french fries. The default meal they serve you consists of a whole cornish game hen, tomato bisque soup, two small potatoes, a broccoli stem/floret, a biscuit, and an apple tart. You can have unlimited Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, iced tea, or water.

My kids (5, 10, 12 and 15) loved the show. My younger son went nuts for all the jousting and swordfighting. He was captivated by the fireworks and fire effects. Every time our knight walked or rode by, my son was throwing his hands in the air and yelling, ""Huzzah!"" It was an awesome experience for him to be able to scream and be as loud as he wanted during dinner. Toward the end of the show, the King of Ireland was ""killed"" in battle, and his biggest fan promptly burst into tears. We reassured him that it wasn't real, and after the show was over, he clamored to meet the King of Ireland and take a picture...only to freeze up in the presence of his hero. It was downright hilarious. I think he will remember the Tournament of Kings for years to come.

It's fun, it's cheesy, it's touristy. 
Since there's over 400+ reviews, I'll spare you the details. Just a couple of things to consider:

-Ireland (green) and France (blue) sections are right by the entrance/exit of the stage. These are also known as the cheapest Category 3 tickets. If you're sensitive to loud gunshot noises, fire, fireworks etc...I suggest you sit in a different section. Not recommended for young children to sit in these sections either.
-Spain (red) and Austria (yellow) are considered the front of the stage. But these seats are the most expensive (Category 1).
-Vegan, vegetarian, kosher, gluten free, kids menu are available. Let the box office agent know in advance when you're purchasing or picking up your tickets and they'll make the call for you.
-Show is 1 hour and 15 minutes. No intermission. No restroom in the arena. You have to completely exit and use the bathroom in the arcade. 
-With the Cornish hen entrée...boyfriend said the chicken was kind of dry. With the food, it is what it is. Keep your expectations average.

Surprisingly, people of all walks of life gets really into it! That's what I love about this the most. Leave your normal lifestyle at the door, come eat with your hands and cheer at the top of your lungs for your knight! =)",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,5,1,5,XJM3uptHj1Ns29RAdsK1iA

And I literally asked our bar waitress FIVE TIMES for plain orange juice for my son.  He finally got it 45 minutes into the show!  By that time he was trying to choke down the super dry chicken and overcooked potatoes and a liquid beverage would have come in handy.  He finally resorted to drinking some of my soda (which he HATES) just to have something!

I had been to this show once before as a teenager, with my family. It was fun back then and since then my family and I had gone to two other versions throughout the years. A meal plus cheesy entertainment is great on lazy nights. 

Then during 4th of July week this past week, my friends and I decided to have a cheesy night of jousting and eating with our hands.

The website makes it very clear that there are vegan, vegetarian, allergy friendly and gluten free meal options. Woohoo! I would be able to eat everything served to me without worry. We informed the box office chick that I needed gluten free (as advised by the website) and then once our server greeted us, I told him I needed gluten free and he said that it wouldn't be a problem.

Note: The gluten free option basically means they don't give you a biscuit and instead of the pastry for dessert they give you fresh fruit. The tomato soup, cornish hen, broccoli and potatoes are all totally fine.

The soup arrived and was freakin' delicious. I could have drank a gallon of the soup and I would have been a happy camper. I made sure they filled my bowl to the top. Soooo yummy! I even poured a little of my cabernet into it and that just made it even better. 

When our actual dinners arrived (via another server person), I was served the same platter of food as everyone else. The biscuit was just chillin' on the plate. Since the biscuit wasn't touching the other food, I simply gave it to my friend and figured it was a slight oversight. I devoured my hen, potatoes and broccoli as the show progressed and it was still very enjoyable at this point.

Then dessert was served (again by a rando helper server). Again, I was served the same thing as everyone else. A pastry. Not fresh fruit. When our server FINALLY made an appearance, I asked him if I could have ""the gluten free dessert... the fresh fruit... I can't eat this."" He nodded and ran off. When he returned, he returned with ANOTHER DINNER. A whole freakin' dinner plate but this time without the biscuit. He laid it down and then ran away again. 

Now, had he brought me a dinner with a biscuit I would have assumed he didn't hear me when I said gluten free (despite this being the third time I had mentioned it) and would have asked for the gluten free dessert again. But he OBVIOUSLY heard the gluten free part and/or remembered that's what I needed. The lack of biscuit on my second dinner plate proved this.

We all laughed about the fail and I sat there debating whether to go look for him or to just give up and assume he had no clue what the gluten free dessert actually was. Also, I was trying to enjoy the show so I didn't really want to get up and go looking for fruit. So instead, I ate more cornish hen and more potatoes because it was there and I knew that if I didn't eat any of it then that bird was killed in vain since they would have to toss it. Plus, it was really good the first time around so I figured why not.

Let me say this... if there hadn't been a gluten free menu option and it wasn't made so very clear on the website that gluten free was an option, I wouldn't have cared about any of this. I would have treated it like any other restaurant and ordered the normal food with my best judgements about what it contained and I would have just planned on skipping dessert. 

But if a restaurant is going to make a point of offering options for those with dietary restrictions then they need to make sure their servers are trained better and more knowledgeable.  

Thank god I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. Can you imagine what would have happened if they plopped a dead bird in front of a vegan who was expecting an eggplant based meal? Haha. 

Side note to those who think any of the performers are hot: The guys and gals that perform ALSO do the photo booth thing at the front of the hotel when they aren't working at the show... so there's that.",FpTuy9U92NKcr9YI__TT1g,4,1,2,Zvzkk3D2ccYrtEOsCIduYg

What terrible seating. Not only is it uncomfortable, but if you think you have a good seat by being in the front row, you are horribly mistaken. The horses, which come flying right past you, kick dirt up onto your table and possibly your food.
The script is what it is. It's funny for kids, and probably kicks the pride out of the actors every night. The jousting, stage fighting, dancing and pyrotechnics are good enough, but it doesn't excuse the fact that it's just a bunch of cheese.

2929062,2009-10-10,1,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"Prior to seeing the Tournament of Kings, I'd only watched a touring company of jousters at a local Renaissance Faire, so I didn't come in with the highest of expectations. 

That being said, I was proven delightfully wrong. 

Let's start with the food. I came in absolutely starving and was served a ridiculous amount of food. First came the tomato soup (delish), then the main course: potato wedges, broccoli, and a full gaming hen. The chicken was definitely the standout item: fresh, hot, and exceedingly moist. For dessert, we were served these apple-filled pastries (also tasty).

Now, on to the entertainment! The horse-mounted performers were incredible! I loved watching them fly around the arena and engage each other in battle. The dancing peasant girls were perfectly in unison, and they made me want to get up and dance with them. (The fact that I'm a dancer shouldn't taint my review; they were great!)

 I also enjoyed the participatory nature of the show, how each part of the crowd was encouraged to scream for its reigning champion (ours was the King of Norway). My husband also warned me (spoiler) that Russia always cheats:) 

I'd definitely recommend the show, whether you love watching jousting, hand to hand combat, dancing, etc. There's even an acrobatic act thrown in for good measure.",Yn8jvkbGnwiTy02j-Cf_TA,2,2,4,6z1YFvF82_foBJtxB5As4Q
2929066,2010-08-29,4,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"I just saw this tonight and I have to say it was SO much fun!  

First the food:  The tomato soup was beyond awesome.  I ate mine and most of my husband's.  The lady beside me was slow to try hers and I almost asked for it but then she tried it and saw how awesome it was. Then her kid wasn't eating his so I was like hmmm....but then he tried it and loved it.  Dinner was potatoes, broccoli (yuck), a biscuit and Cornish hen.  All was really good!  Dessert was an apple pie thingie but apple pie isn't my thing.  Ice cream would be better.  Alcochol is extra but there's all the pepsi you can drink which made this pepsi girl quite happy.  Food=5 stars. 

Merlin starts you off then he's joined by Jester and they teach you some cheers and what not.  Then the show really starts.  The dancers were very good, all in sync.  The dancers come out to your section and get you cheering and screaming for your country. GO AUSTRIA!  BOOOO DRAGON!   The kings were not only good looking but quite talented and amusing.  The lady beside me boo'd on country and he turned around and made a face at her and both of us cracked up laughing.   Show=5 stars!

The only improvement I can say is that there should be a bathroom inside because of the all you can drink pepsi.  The closest bathroom is out in the arcade and who wants to miss any of the action? 

Fun was had by all and I'd be more than happy to go back again tomorrow if we already didn't have dinner reservations with the in-laws.",gS3RApdvXTYNlad9Kra7IA,5,2,5,kq-BSWZchI2K2VavCM13OQ

The hubby and I had a great time trying to determine which dancing ""maiden"" (ie the belly baring booty shaking dancers) were strippers and which were ballerinas gone rotten. I found the shirtless men of the show a nice distraction initially, but up close they're just dudes not as hot as the Thunder Down Under bunch. The script is absurd, and the enforced ""huzzah"" and cheering got a tad dull. But all in all good cheesy fun. 

The food was awful. The soup was edible, or slurpable I suppose, but I've never had such a dry nasty chicken in my life. Couldn't touch the floppy broccoli. That apple thing was just nasty. My strawberry daiquiri was quite strong though! And I like my souvenir cup very much, along with our $35 souvenir pictures. 

After the show some of the actors came out to meet guests and take pictures with the kids. Our ""king"" was incredibly sweet when the kids wandered up to him. I wonder how much tail the performers pull on the Strip, being ""knights of Excalibur"".

What makes it unique is that you aren't just watching the show, you are participating in it and that makes all the difference since most shows in LV you just watch and leave.

Even though the menu is Cornish game hen, you can request a veggie lasagna so if you are avoiding it because you are vegetarian or prefer something else, have no fear!

One last thing. The food gave me and the kids EXPLOSIVE diarrhea. A few minutes after eating I felt like I had an upset stomach.

The arena is fairly small so no matter where you sit you will have a good seat.  We actually sat dead center in the front row and we were so close that we were almost hit by dirt thrown up by the horses as they galloped by!

One great aspect of this show is the Feast!  Our waiter was so good we couldn't take more than a couple drinks from our glasses before he zipped by and refilled them!  Dinner included: tomato soup, Cornish game hen, roasted potatoes, broccoli, a dinner roll and a pop tart shaped apple crisp for desert.  Dinner did not include eating utensils as you are forced to drink your soup from a bowl and eat with your hands like the good ole days!  The food was surprisingly good!  The cornish game hen basically tasted like a small broiled chicken, hot, juicy, tender and seasoned perfectly.

The show is basically a bunch of josting knights, dancing gypsies and the classic good vs evil battle with a slight twist.

Bought tickets like 2 hours before the show at one of the Excalibur box offices. The person made it sound like it was completely booked because he told us that we only had the choice of the Dragon or Russia section. Choose the Dragon section. When we got there only the Dragon and Russia sections were full, there was barely anyone in Austria.

The show started a little late which I think slightly threw off the servers because some servers started serving the food while our server stood in the back with the food and a confused look on his face. But once the food was out it just kept coming. Got the soup (which was good) before the show began. The cornish hen came right before the show began which made it slightly difficult to eat and participate with the ""huzzahs"" and ""here heres"" at the same time. And the apple tart arrived while I was still eating the cornish hen. Even though everything seemed a little off with timing, the servers were great and my drink was always filled.

The food itself was eh. The tomato basil soup was good. The cornish hen was a little dry. And the apple tart was cold by the time I tried it so it wasn't that great.

The show itself was eh. Nothing too special. Half of it probably had to do with the atmosphere -- just not a lot of people there. And the storyline was very predictable. It would be more interesting if the storyline changed based on audience participation but I guess that would put a lot more work on the cast members to have to come up with a different scenario for each one.

The performance by the actors is a blast. It's truly very, very entertaining. The actors are all very handsome, a lot of them come out after the performance to interact with the patrons, and it's just super fun. The menu hasn't changed since I was there 10 years ago, but had to leave early because the smoke they pipe in made the person I was with sick. So I'd planned to come back so I could finish the show. Different actors this time but still great. 

The food the first time was cooked so much better though. This time (in February 2017) the game hen was the main problem, it was way over cooked and dry. The potatoes were dry as well, unfortunately. The soup was WONDERFUL (I need that recipe!) and the dessert was lovely. The broccoli stalk I can't eat because of digestion issues (and who really likes broccoli?) maybe a change there would benefit. I get this food is mass-produced, just maybe a little more attention to the cook on it and it could be INCREDIBLE, and y'all could even charge more.

It was a lot of fun. They really get the crowd involved and pumped up. I love that you cheer on a king depending on where you are seated. That was fun. I have three boys and they were very involved in the show--even the 18 month old. He cheered right along with the rest of us. The food was good. Okay, it wasn't gourmet. But seeing as they have to serve things that you can eat with your hands, I think it was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was that the food was not appealing to the kids. For this reason I think they should offer lower priced tickets for kids. But the tickets were $58/person regardless of age. The only exception was for children 3 and under who were allowed to enter for free if they were to sit on a parent's lap and eat off that parent's plate. But $58 is a lot for an 8 and 5 yr. old who---even if they had liked it--would not have been able to eat even half of the food that was served.

3260901,2016-03-15,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"Let me start by saying...this is a fun way to spend an evening.

I started looking for something fun to do while my friend was in town. I bought tickets at a location on the strip for a good price last minute.
Once there, was seated in France ( all sections are different countries) and the drinks arrived. I had soda.
Merlin started the show by giving birthday shout outs, nice for those with birthdays. Ask ahead for this.
The food consists of potatoes, Cornish game hen and broccoli (all eaten with your hands, no utensils) there is dessert also that changes.
The show is fun and you are expected to cheer for your section alot. There are knights, horses and evil characters battling in the arena. ( be aware there are smoke effects and sometimes strong odors from the horse's)

If you are looking to eat good and escape for a bit, this is a good way to go.

I took off a star due to, depending on where you sit, it is a long way back to the arcade to use the restroom. Also difficult to get out of your row due to the way it is set up with little room for legs to squeeze past others.
Also, the game hen is a bit hard to eat as it is cooked whole and you must tear it apart with your hands or just gnaw it from the bones.

No - but you aren't going to see Celine Dion or dine at Guy Savoy, right?! The show itself is terrible. Terrible music, acting, lights, effects, ""story line,"" dancing, singing, etc. At one point they make the audience sing along with a song where the lyrics are ""Is it good? Yes, yes, yes. Is it bad? No, no, no."" At some points the scene drags on for way too long where I got bored and looked at my watch to check the time. I felt like the show was two hours at least, but it's less than 90 minutes. Felt like WAY longer than that. The food was not great either. The appetizer is something called ""Dragons Blood"" aka Campbell's tomato soup. The chicken was dry and it was difficult to eat without utensils, as were the vegetables.

About a show that features a wizard. Honestly, though, we loved this show. We managed to get buy one get one tickets via MyVegas so it only cost $73.88 for the both of us after fees. Redemption was mostly painless, we had to grab the Mresort rewards card, or whatever it's called, and pick up our tickets by 4:00. Going into the theater, we had to of course buy a light up viking helmet for $12. Dinner and pepsi products (sad face) were included. 

Dinner consisted of an average tasting Cornish hen (not too dry, but not that tender either), a nicely seasoned and fresh piece of broccoli, two new potatoes, and surprisingly tasty biscuit. 

As a starter, we received a bowl of tomato soup, which was served from a water pitcher. I imagine that's the easiest way. The soup was really good. We also received a strawberry filled tart at the end. Also really tasty. The service was really friendly, and checked on us several times during the show. 

So dinner was definitely filling, and satisfying, but not particularly amazing. Note: No utensils are provided. I didn't see this in the other reviews. Food is all easily eaten with the fingers, and wet napkins are provided for cleanup. 

The show itself was good, mostly not dirty fun, with fireworks, singing dancing, and of course jousting. The combat was fun to watch. Since seating was stadiumish style around the theater, there was truly no bad seat in the house. 

The only real negative I have about the theater is the seating. The chairs are extremely low to the ground, even for this 5 foot tall girl. Oh, and they are as hard as ROCKS.

Though I came here with a group of like minded youngins, I couldn't help but think if this was the type of place Ralph Macchio (AKA Daniel-san in Karate Kid) would bring Elizabeth Shue for a date.  I determined at the end of the show that it was not only karate kid worthy but totally not worth my $40 ticket.

The show takes place in an arena like venue, with cascading stadium style seats that surround a dusty pit made for folks on a horse.  Once the show begins, the characters that eventually joust each other to death while speaking in Medieval dialects are in character from start to finish.  Yes, this means cheesy lines, plenty of fake violence, and forced laughs / gasps from the audience for a good 90 minutes.  The waitresses are dressed like skimpy maids and while most of them were hot, something tells me they hate working there.  The chicken dinner that was served like it was in the middle ages, roasted and with little flavor and no utensils.  I suppose a pizza would've been asking for too much.

Allergy sufferers beware, if the seats are near the dusty arena floor, then watch out for the horse dust that will eventually cloud up and rise.   I was coughing and gasping by the end of the show, no meds would've been strong enough to prevent all of the hacking.

We did the dinner and show package.

The dinner:
So many reviews I have read say the ""Dragon's Blood"" tomato bisque is amazing. Even the bartender at Dick's said it was exceptional. I was expecting something soooo good but what I got was typical tomato soup from a can that was served piping hot. Ok. The main course, Cornish game hen, whole chicken or whatever it was, was ok as well. It was served so friggin hot, I could barely pull off the legs and eat them without burning myself. I mean I get the whole ""no utensils in medieval times thing"" and while it added to the immersion of the event, it also took away from what could have been a good meal. The downside to eating a fresh hot chicken without utensils is by the time I could split the breast open and eat it without burning my hands, it was starting to get cold, and by then it was just meh. The broccoli and potatoes were good and easy to eat as they were not as hot to the touch, as was the dinner roll. The piece of strudel for desset was tasty as well. Our server was quick to refill our tankards during our meal.

The show:
Merlin did a great job of instructing us how to cheer. Huzzah! How to drink, ahhh! and how to bang our palms on the table. Gotta be careful with that, almost ended up with Dragons Blood soup on my lap! They say if you cheer your knight on loud enough, he will win whatever event he is participating in. I find this hard to believe and I think it is all predetermined ahead of time but we cheered our heads off anyway. We were seated in the Russia section and our knight was a bit of a cheater but it made it fun to watch and we cheered him on anyway. The whole event had a cool storyline too if you follow it. I won't give away any other details as it may spoil the show for some, but it had everything we expected. Singing, dancing, jousting, fancy horse riding, dazzling sword fighting, plus some nifty special effects. There were even cute wenches for the guys to look at, and bare chested muscled guys for the women to whistle at.

Even though we did not find the meal to be as amazing as some others claim, we will probably do this again, just because we found it to be so entertaining.",ChRpi0qtrDHAY95LA3Zmhw,3,1,5,b6J7A5VTHdTDnKMIXqfVTQ

Save your hot ass soup to dip for when your plate comes out so you can dip your biscuit inside. You also receive apple fritters. They taste just like McDonalds apple pies.

Although this is a similar show to Medieval Times, the entertainment factor and level of professionalism from the performers far exceeded that of Medieval Times. It made for a great show and well worth the price paid which you can get tickets along the strip cheaper than face value. I purchased my tickets at the mall directly across from the Wynn for $34.99. I'm sure there are cheaper rates available but that is the best I could find without doing any deep research.

One of my complaints is that the food was very poor. I didn't exactly expect a perfect meal for the price and cost of entertainment but it seemed like the some of the items were cooked the day before and then reheated. However, the chicken and tomato soup were both very good and at least edible compared to some of the other items.

Word of warning also is that alcohol is not free and is very expensive for what is provided. You can get a 12-16 oz collectors mug of Bud Light or Budweiser for $12 or any other mixed drink. Wine is also available at a high price and I am not sure of the quality of what you will get. If you are planning to come to this show to drink then I would have to advise against it.

It never gets old. I have seen in probably a dozen plus times.
It has changed a bit over the years. When I was younger it was called ""King Arthur's Tournament"".
Also the ""gruel"" you drink used to be cream of chicken soup but now it is tomato.
The Cornish game hen is tasty and who doesn't like eating with your hands? I love the feel of actually being allowed to eat with my hands and not have that vision on my head of my Mom giving me an awkward eye for having bad manners.
It can be very loud so keep that in mind.

A few things to note:
-Kids 3 and under can get in free but must sit on their parents lap and share their parents food.
-Tickets are $59 per person plus tax.
-Tickets for those who want to skip the dinner but enjoy the show are $44.35 plus tax.
-If you purchase your tickets online they add a $5 handling fee versus if you buy the tickets in person there isn't one.
-They offer group rates for parties of 15 or more
-Tickets are good for 120 days from date of purchase.
-With local ID you can get 20% off for up to 8 tickets and you must purchase these in person to show your valid NV ID.

3520987,2013-06-18,1,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"After hearing about the menu my main question was if there was something for a vegetarian -  the answer is yes.   You get the soup, you are served ravioli (you get a fork though) and you get the same toaster strudel everyone else gets.  You just have to tell your server once you're seated you're a vegetarian to get this meal and it took a bit longer than the others getting hens to come out.

We booked our tickets early (we were booking Cirque for the same trip and for those shows it's needed) and I'm sure we were the first to book because we could have sat anywhere.  We choose front row in the middle of Dragon.  I was worried about eating so close to horses but that wasn't a problem at all.  Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much.  I'd recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena (unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area)

Over all the show was pretty cool.   I didn't understand when booking dragon doesn't do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist.   That means you're sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on (even in the start).  As an adult that is ok...  I took a while to figure out we didn't have a king at all. I'm not sure how ideal that section is for the kids.   You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics who's pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids. 

I like the show. It's light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz.  It's interactive and you can be a bit silly.  It's not my favorite show but it's pretty good.  Likely the best family show I've seen in Vegas. 

My food sucked though... the soup was ok as was the dessert but the vegetarian ravioli was gross.  VERY over cooked, soggy, and bland.   I didn't finish my small serving because I almost threw up in my mouth due to texture issues.   They serve you pop that's been sitting in pitchers for I don't know how long so it's completely flat by the time it gets poured into your glass.  For that reason I wish I had ordered from the expensive bar over drinking flat soda waiting for the water that was never to arrive.   My fiance barely got through his hen saying it was just ok.   Dessert was alright and helped alleviate the left over ravioli in my mouth that was driving me crazy. 

Service was acceptable.  Our server was mostly a bus boy in reverse - don't talk to him because he's not interest.  At least the food arrived and the dishes disappeared.  The section was served faster than many of the others to at least he had a system.  

For mom and dad there are some cute kings and saucy wenches that like to dance and sing.   The horses are gorgeous and the games are fun to watch.   I'm sure much of that is theatrical tricks due to just how dangerous some of those actions they were taking really were back in the day but I couldn't figure it out myself.

If there is an option to skip food i'd do that... but I'd recommend the show to people thinking it might be their kind of thing to do in Vegas.",5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,2,0,3,kCBkeKrHyK6moFPn5sM6jA

This was the second time for me seeing this show and this time with my younger kids. They LOVED it. The ""cheesy"" factor was really high, but well worth the money if you are willing to get into it. If you don't feel like getting a little out of your comfort zone and eating with your fingers, banging on the tables and yelling, then this show is not for you.

The Tournament of Kings requires 36 staff members and uses 10 horses in each show. Since 1990 they have served more cornish hens than anyone else in the US close to 6.7 Million since 1990. 

Parking is no longer free unless you are staying as a guest at the Excalibur. If you are attending the show it is $8 for 2-4 hours which was more than enough time. This is a change in the last few years. 

Once you get in the casino follow the signs. You then have to check in at the box office for your tickets if you bought them online. We found some discount tickets on the excalibur website. I think it is a little cheaper if you go M-TH. You can also get them the day of the show at 30% off if you go to one of the booths on the strip Tickets4less (assuming its not sold out already). There are no shows on Tuesdays and you can choose a show times of either 6 or 8.

Then you take the elevator downstairs and walk through a bunch of carnival games that it is almost impossible to pull your children off of. Seriously, well played Excalibur to get you to spend more money. 

The food was really good. You start with tomato soup and can choose a soda you like. Alcohol is extra. Then you get the main course of a Cornish hen, broccoli, a biscuit and some potatoes.  Ok seriously they have been doing this show for years so they are really good cooking the hens. They have a kids meal too you can order. It comes with chicken strips and fries. I wish I had known that beforehand... For dessert they have an apple pastry which was just ok, but I am not really into apple pastries. 

In the show, they use titanium swords so it actually creates sparks and the jousting is actually real. The wood breaks off on their shields which makes it fun. There are even a few fireworks thrown in there for effect. The show is pretty loud so we ended up giving one of our kids ear plugs. They also have booster seats if your kids can't see well. 

Overall, I recommend this show especially if you bring the kids!",sNd0Rkqezl8C5mWKdpVQ9A,3,1,5,VuFClYAnOWGP114HMzUnKA

The show itself was corny at best, and completely nonsensical at worst. Although the 15 seconds of the dozen man melee at the end was pretty cool. The rest of the performance is filled with odd songs and dancing, poor horsemanship, and very strange choices of 'games'. 

The fighting was the only positive. It's clear that part is well rehearsed. Oh. And the fire. There's shitloads of fire. 

Food was mediocre. Soup was flavorful, chicken was dry, biscuit was a hockey puck.  Potatoes and broccoli were an unnecessary afterthought.

Better shows available for the value. The fighting was decent, but almost every other part of the show came off as very weird and out of place.

""Use your fork, use your inside voice, don't talk when you're eating, slow down and chew your food."" - Parents

At the Tournament of Kings , there are no forks (or spoons or knives), they ask you to (frequently) yell at the top of your lungs and pound the table, and you better eat quick because, like microwavable popcorn, if nothing happens for 2-3 seconds they'll take your food whether you're finished or not. 

Once inside, keep your wallet out, because there are plenty of extras to pay for: alcohol (around $6 for a beer), light up swords for the kids ($12), and the woman who takes photos of everyone while they're eating ($35 for two pics).

Just before the show was about to begin, she came along with a pitcher of hot tomato soup that she poured into everyone's bowl warning each of us as she went along that it was hot.  Indeed it was--and tasty.  Next came our dinner, a plate with a Cornish hen, a stalk of broccoli, and two red skinned small potatoes.  There was also a biscuit. After dinner, the server brought around an apple tart, something like a Pop Tart but much better.  The dinner was quite enjoyable and there were two napkins and a wet cloth in a sealed holder for cleaning your hands because there are no utensils.

In a ""contest"" that is a fight between nations such as Spain, France, Denmark and Ireland... the moniker we were given lent itself to being the bad guy, which was confirmed by the lovely lady who was serving us our grog for the night.

This was my second trip (the first being almost 20 years ago) and the girlfriend's first. We were both pretty excited.

Entering the theatre, you are immediately hit with the ""fresh"" scent of horse manure and dirt.. so I might imagine that could ruin the appetite of a few city dwellers.. but nonetheless we forged on to our seats.

The girlfriends was a little broken, with a slight lean forward to no doubt ensure she would be on the edge of her seat for the entire show.

We were offered a selection of pop (or Soda for the American readers) and were told that our drink orders (the keeper cups struck our souvenir fancy) would be taken a bit later. 

We did each order a special challice with beer for me and a frozen treat for my girlfriend. Came out to be over 30 dollars for the two... *cringe* .. but it's.. about.. the experience... right?

Anyways.. onwards and forwards.

We were served a meal (sans the cutlery because in the Medievil times, they didn't have it!) consisting of first ""soup"" which is just, and I swear it to be true.. the tomato broth from Alphagetti. Still delicious to me.. but high class it is not.

Then came the main course of the night.. a cornish game hen, a baked potato and a broccoli tree.

All very well done, and was completely devoured. 

One small risk for people seated in Row A is the dirt kicked up from the horses passing by that start about half way through your main meal. It didn't happen to us but it did happen to folks just down the way from us.. and I can't imagine wanting to finish the food after that myself.

The meal is caped off with a apple pastry of some sort. Kind of gets away from the theme if you ask me.. but not terrible.

I know, I know, you're all clamoring for my opinion of the show.. well it was fun. A lot of fun. I won't go into detail so as to ruin the show.. but crowd participation just makes this show what it is.. If you are a curmudgeon, or a grumpy pants.. stay home! Let loose and just join in.. remember it's for the kids and make it fun for them.

A little disappointing to only have had a small role for our team in the show.. but otherwise a great time all around.

The ONLY reason I knocked it down a star is based sheerly on price. To have charged so much for the show.. only have half filled stands.. and then to charge so much for drinks is just too much for this frugal laddies liking.",2qTCiejiaPcHD2vawRrWZg,2,2,4,tGkUgE8ZAgqzZGtULNS49Q

4062977,2015-09-01,2,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"Always wondered about this show, so my boyfriend & I thought we'd check it out. Reading the other Yelp reviews, we went to the show with a few expectations: the tomato soup would be good, the Cornish hen would be bland, the actors would be hot, & the show would be entertaining. Yelpers were right.

The setup was like a stadium. Each section was a country & that would be the country you cheered for. We sat in France, go France! Seemed like most seats filled the Dark side.. the crowd cheered very loud for evil. It was fun cheering along because it had everyone participate. Very lively audience.

It was an entertaining show.. a lot of fireworks & fire effects that I wasn't expecting. The horses were so good. They knew when to run off stage, knew tricks. The actors were all nice to look at. They chose the cast well! Each knight had distinct features according to their country, the gladiators were buff, the maidens were so pretty. The costumes & set-up weren't near as extravagant as watching a Cirque show.. It was more like watching a theater play. But being that this show was family-oriented, I'm sure the costumes worked well for the kids watching. This is definitely a fun show to take your kids too. They would love it.

As for the food, the only thing I finished was the tomato soup. It was very flavorful. The Cornish hen was bland, seasoned on the skin, but the flavor wasn't in the meat. The potatoes & broccoli were okay, lightly seasoned. The biscuit was not bad. The dessert was an apple square.. it was dry. I could only eat one bite. The gluten-free option has fresh fruit as the dessert, so if you can request fruit instead from the waiter, do so. The waiters are very nice too, good quick service.

There is a dinnerless option. If you don't eat much, I'd suggest to go for this. I could barely eat half of the Cornish hen & only ate pieces from the entree. Like I mentioned earlier, the only thing I finished was the tomato soup.

I've never been to Medieval times and my gf convinced me to give this place a try. This  show is mainly geared towards kids with the audience participation and how each section that you're sitting in has a different knight from a different country. Countries range from Russia, Hungary, France, Spain to... Dragon? Yes, if you get dragon, you're rooting for the bad guys. XD

It's basically a dining show. The food consists of tomato soup as an appetizer, cornish hen, broccoli, 2 potato wedges and a biscuit for the main dish and apple strudel for dessert. Pepsi and sierra mist are complimentary but everything else costs extra. The food here is decent enough and the portion sizes will fill you up.

 As for the show itself, it was an entertaining hour of jousting, sword fencing, horse back riding, dancing and mediocre acting. Basically, the story of consists of a bunch of knights competing for... not really sure... and the tournament gets interrupted by an evil wizard who unleashes his dragon knights. blah, blah, the good guys win.

We got out tickets at Tix 4 Tonight, so we only paid $40. $40 for a three course dinner and a dinner show? I think so! 

We went to the ""late"" show at 8:30pm and missed what I think could have been a lot of kids. This was the drunk older crowd and that was perfect. Some guy who must eat entire fowl carcasses all the time told us the portions were small and to eat before. I'm glad we didn't believe the big man because there was too much food to eat! The tomato soup was just fantastic, and then they serve you an entire chicken, half a crown of broccoli, and giant delicious fries with a dinner bun, and then you get a strudel for dessert. I ate as much of my chicken as I could but it was a little dry. I suppose that is to be expected when you're cooking a few hundred chickens a night though, I can't blame the chef. 

They really make you participate which is great to get shy people (ie. not me) out of their shells so they can enjoy the show. I was so happy to be in an energetic section. We cheered Hungary on as far as he could go and it was all amazing. 

In addition to the knights and jousting etc, they had acrobats come out and more of a show around the knights then I remember. It was totally worth it. 

One thing I didn't like is they hand you a framed picture and then come around a half a hour later asking if you want to pay for it. Maybe its the fact that they already printed it or that they already gave it to you, it just rubbed me the wrong way, like a meat shop next to a race track. 

Regardless, it's a great time and totally worth it. If almost 20 years of anticipation can't ruin it, you know it's cool. Bring a group and get rowdy with it!",oKwmwvlhMskTpnFA5CT_Lw,0,0,4,Ogu2-OeQXo6eQ8d363FS1Q

The show has been in town for years and has always been fun.  I have seen this show several times over the years and have always had a blast! You can go in and leave adulthood at the doors and let your inner child run free!

When you walk in to the theater, you are transported to a medieval castle.  You are seated in a King's section, whom you will root for during the tournament. Merlin is out and about during this time and is entertaining the crowd.  He also teaches you how to act during the show.  Hazzah! The show starts and you will just have so much fun from there on out.  I don't want to say too much and spoil the show for you!

Dinner is decent as well.  You get a bowl of soup, a Cornish hen, some veggies, and a dessert.  The fun part is that there aren't any utensils.  Embrace your inner caveman and eat with your hands.  Yummy!

The price is also a good point.  The tickets are usually about $50 and you can find coupons if you look around.  It is a fun show that you can do without breaking the bank.  It is also a must see if you have kids.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,6,4,qGR1OV62i8jFVQz-oCEwGQ

I was blown away and so very happy with the purchase.

First of all, the theatre is small so no matter where you sit you get a great view!!

Secondly, I didn't realize it was a dinner theatre type event. However, what I love about this, you get to eat while watching the show before you. As oppose to eat. Part 1 starts. Main course comes out during intermission... and so on so forth. 

Thirdly, you get to eat without using utensils and it's awesome. I thought I would be a little grossed out at this part but I quite enjoyed it.

Fourth, the food is pretty good! You get your own little chicken (not slices of meat) with potatoes ""veggies"" (which is actually just a broccoli stem), tomato soup, coffee/tea/soda/water, a biscuit and an apple turnover. I liked the food =)

Lastly, the show was entertaining! Not overly long, funny... and you get to cheer for your county's ""king"". No it's not real fighting but that what makes it fun. They're ARE real horses though so there's a little bit of a smell. But honestly, they keep the arena super clean so really all you're smelling is the dirt in the arena court. 

So, all in all a great experience and I'd like to say again that....

4333133,2018-03-18,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"I'm somewhere in between a 3 and a 4 so I'm giving a 3 as I had second thoughts after writing this reviews. I originally gave it a 4 but after thinking of how expensive it was and the overall value I'll give it a 3. I've never been to anything like this. I always wanted to go to medieval times but never had a chance to go. We decided to come here for my kids birthday since she loves horses and I like sword fighting and such. 

The show is somewhat short. About an hour and 15 minutes from start to finish and that's with a whole bunch of slow walking and talking. We sat in the French section angled area literally next to the castle and it's doors. If I had another chance I would have chose one of the other angled countries on the opposite side of the arena. I think one of them is Austria. 

Anyway, things you should be prepared for : No bathrooms anywhere in the mini arena. You have to leave the entire arena go back up the stairs and go find the bathrooms in between arcade games. Drain the lizard before you sit down. I did but I was drinking beer the whole show ($9 a pop. Yikes) and by the time the show was over I needed to use the restroom really really bad. A side note. If you're in the French section there is no shortcut to leave. You have to go all the way around the arena so when the  show is over you have to wait for everyone in other sections. 

The food is whatever. I purposely didn't eat for most of the day so I had an appetite for the included meal. No utensils. I didn't know and nothing was mentioned so you have to drink soup out of bowls and hope they're cleaned. Everyone gets a chicken or game hen or whatever they want to call it as well as 2 potatoes , broccoli, and a biscuit (mine didn't include one. Didn't realize until halfway into dinner service and didn't care to ask for one). I didn't finish it all and my kid didn't even touch any of it. I don't blame her. A poor hen died for nothing since they didn't have a kids menu. If I did they never mentioned it. The waiters just came and started setting down food without talking. Since dinner is included you might as well eat it. I would rather have saved $10 each ticket and ate prior. 


It gets LOUD and hot. One of the performers (the bad guy) has a real flame glove on and shoots a huge fireball that stays lit for a few seconds. In our section we could all feel it and it was incredibly hot. Sure it's only a few seconds but it was uncomfortable. They have a bunch of LOUD fireworks going off so if you have a hearing aid in or are sensitive to loud noises be prepared for it or just go to a different show. 

Overall it was an okay show. I wouldn't go to another one even for free and I think it's overpriced. 3 tickets over $200. I'm an extended local (don't live in Vegas anymore but I'm there often) and it's a show more for people that just want a kid friendly thing to do while in Vegas.

My husband and I were on our honeymoon and he decided to treat me to Tournament of Kings because I have never been to a dinner show like this. I have always wanted to go to Medieval Times in Anaheim, CA but never had the chance so this was my big moment!

I was impressed with the soup like every other yelp review states. The chicken was mediocre and not memorable. However, the show was what made it over-the-top for me! I loved the storyline and the dancing and the fireworks at the end! We sat in Ireland and was glad that the box office girl picked those seats for us because we were right in front of almost all the action and the firework explosion at the end!

My husband said that the storyline was nice because Medieval Times does not have a storyline or dancing like that.

We bought our show tickets on www.vegas.com, and somehow got seats that were front row and center in the middle section of the audience. But honestly, no matter where you sit, you'll still get a good view. The actors and performers travel all around the arena, so you'll never miss a good moment.

Although we arrived 15 minutes late (due to uncontrollable circumstances), they still let us in and we got our food shortly after. I wasn't too fond of eating with my hands but the food they served wasn't too greasy or messy. Honestly? I thought the food was delicious for the price they charged for the show tickets. The serving staff isn't great with their customer service, as my boyfriend tried to order a beer and had no luck. Be careful if you're a slow eater, as they will whisk away your plates if you don't make it clear that you're still eating. They're constantly moving back and forth...and don't do much talking with the people they're serving.

The majority of Yelpers wrote exactly what I was thinking when I was watching the show. It is cheesy...but you have to remember that it's a medieval-themed performance. OF COURSE it's going to be cheesy! Everything is staged and rehearsed many times by the actors. I think it's steered a little bit more towards children but still entertaining for adults, nonetheless. My favorite part about the show were the outfits of all of the knights and dancers.

The show IS a little bit shorter than other shows in Vegas. But still a good time if you're into rowdy environments and cheering for the king that belongs to the section you're sitting in.

This review is for the service.  Not the show, not the food.

We ordered a bucket of beer and glass of wine.  Took the lady like 15 minutes to bring the drinks.  We were served the food before the drinks came out which sucked.

If you buy tickets for this show, all I can recommend is to not get Robert as a server.  He was serving Hungary when we had the misfortune of experiencing his disastrous service. 

First, he literally poured 1/6 of the tomato soup in our bowl.  I was lucky to find the pitcher at the end of the table so I simply poured my sister and myself a bit more to fill maybe half the bowl.  As soon as Robert noticed my clever trick  he says ""Oh you want more? well here you go"" and filled the bowl to the top to the point it spilled.  My sister was like... hey not so much.. He said ""well now it's too late so drink it!""  WTF dude, chill out.

Second, we're not to fans of eating with our hands when you only get one napkin so we asked for eating utensils.  Robert simply threw (yes, he actually threw it) a bunch of silverware out of his pocket and said: ""here, this is all I have, so share it!"" 

This dude was simply lucky I was with my parents before I threw back the hot soup and stabbed him with a butter knife.  He ruined my whole experience.  For this reason you get one star Tournament of Kings... The show was great and the food was pretty decent but one person can change that experience just by giving customers a bad attitude.

She then, finding out we were there celebrating a birthday, put my daughters name on the list to be announced at the beginning of the show and wished a happy birthday. How fun! We then played in the arcade for an hour or so. (we hit jackpot after jackpot, bringing in over 3,000 tickets.) The show was great, we are with our hands, we cheered, we boo-ed and all of us enjoyed our medieval experience at the tournament of kings.",PKhNTl32IRMXFOK1cUuOPQ,2,2,5,ZpyG7UVTQu3VMagDELcOQA

No drink options for children and we won't let our daughter have soda, so it was water for her, but she was adaptable. The big drawback for us was that we sat in the Dragon section and that meant we didn't have anyone to cheer for during most of the show, I was getting bored as the rest of the crowd was able to interact with their Kings. Then we had to cheer for the Evil Rider and, of course, I knew he was going to lose. My daughter has a high sense of morality so this really bothered her, so much she keeps mentioning it. Had I known that I would have chosen a different section. I prefer the Medieval Times shows I've seen in the past. The plot and song that were added into this one didn't really warrant the extra cost or enhance the experience. Although the special effects were fun.

4746234,2016-11-27,5,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"I'm not overly fond of Vegas.

I don't like to gamble, I find many of the themed hotels lamely garish, and, as much as I like crowds, I hate traffic.  Still, I used to come to Vegas all the time as a kid, my mother and her parents enjoyed a good slot machine and we would come a few times a year to various hotels.  When, one summer, we stayed at the Excalibur, I had the chance to enjoy the Tournament of Kings ... and a time or two after, actually...

And it was fun!  As a kid who loved a good sword fight alongside some musical theater (don't judge me), this show offers quite a bit of excitement and entertainment.  I remember looking forward to going, not just for the show, but the food as well.  Now, a few decades later and with a son of my own, I find I want to share those same experiences I enjoyed so much with him.

After all this time, I have to say, the Tournament of Kings holds up pretty well.  The show itself is extensive, including light comedy, stunt work, song and dance, and horse riding tricks.  We caught the Christmas themed version, so there may have been a bit of extra stuff added in this time around.  Regardless, all of the actors seem to really enjoy what they were doing, no one looking bored or just 'going through the motions' as they ran through the script.  The theatrics were impressive, nice pyrotechnics and with loud fireworks that were not overused.  And the level of action we were graced with was high, there are sword fights between combatants that has real weight and malice behind the swing of their weapons, there's an impressive degree of difficulty in riding their horses in such a small arena, and then there's the quick, frenetic chaos of an actual jousting match.  Finally, on top of all that, the actors give good personality to their roles; my son and I were in Russia, and our Czar was a cheating asshole that we loved rooting for from start to finish.

Huzzah!

Seriously, Czar of Russia, you rocked.

But, this is more than just a good show.  On the dinner side of things, you start with a bowl of Tomato Bisque.  You're not given a spoon (""There were no utensils IN Medieval Times, hence there are no utensils AT Medieval Times ... would you like a refill on your Pepsi?"") meaning that you pick up your bowl and slurp away at a slightly salty, but not too bad version of this soup.

Soon after, they serve you a full platter with Roasted Potatoes, a stalk of Steamed Broccoli, a Muffin of Stuffing, a Buttermilk Biscuit, and a whole Cornish Game Hen.  The chicken itself is well roasted, cooked the whole way through, with a nice crisp to the fatty skin, and extremely juicy and flavorful considering they must be mass flaming them a few hundred at a stretch.  The potatoes shared the same flavor, sprinkled with the same herbs and spice before cooking, making them soft and very tasty.  The biscuits are biscuits, tough to go wrong with those unless they're overcooked, which ours were not.  The same goes for the stuffing, likely out of a box, but they at least sprang for a name brand that came with its own seasoning.  And the broccoli wasn't steamed to the point of falling apart, holding its shape well, while sprinkled with a fair amount of seasoning to make even those who dislike their vegetables find something to enjoy.  All around, an impressive feast for even the hungriest of jousting enthusiasts.

And to top it all off, a nice, big Christmas cookie, frosted with holiday spirit and something my son enjoyed a great deal.

All in all, this was a lot of fun.  It reminded me why I enjoyed it so much i my youth, it allows my three year old a night out with his dad to watch some explosions, fire, and violence (again ... HUZZAH!) performed by good actors with great energy, and with a delicious banquet to boot.  I doubt it will be anytime soon, but I'm sure I'll bring him back here again in the future.",lN7NysaTcbI2VCRub7kYOw,11,9,4,oDUn6PfmGzI_KKk_JO_4KQ

Watching a show with knights on their horses, girls prancing around, eating with only your hands, drinking out of a chalice... All that while shouting and cheering on your ""country""! Fun times :]

When you buy your tickets, they give you a choice as to what country you want to sit in. Because we got our tickets last minute, we chose to sit in ""Dragon"", which we found out when we got there was the bad guy :p It is arena seating, I believe it was 3 or 4 rows high.

When you sit, you get to choose between Sprite and Dragon Juice (which is Pepsi), or you can purchase an alcoholic beverage. Soon after, they bring you a delicious warm bowl of tomato soup (no spoon of course!). Some wizzard looking man plays the host, and he mingles during dinner with the crowd. He teaches the audience some olden day lingo, like ""hazzah!"" and ""here, here!"" to cheer throughout the night.

The main course was an entire hen, some broccoli and potatos, and a biscuit. It was a lot of food... My friends and I all couldnt finish. The hen was surprisingly good--juicy and flavorful. The dessert was an apple turnover, nothing fancy.

The show was the knights jousting, and one-on-one battles, singing and dancing. Although it's an entertaining show, I would say it aimed more toward older children and adults.

Other waiters left the drink mugs, but this guy had to take them all before the show was over.

While I enjoyed the show (and the food far surpassed my expectations), I felt there was too much emphasis on the plot and storyline, and not enough on the fighting.  The fighting is what makes the event fun and exciting.  I like to see the amazing tricks they can do, but it really felt like they were holding back somehow.

The show also didn't seem very long to me.  Another review on here states that the show was 1 1/2 hours, but I can hardly believe that.  It seemed to last an hour, at most, to me...which was part of the reason I ended up being so let down.

We were sucked into this place because it was a must-do on the Vegas list and we had kids with us... upon reading up on it more, I found that you ate with your hands while watching the show.  I also was lead to believe we'd all get crowns, but I mistook that for Medieval Madness elsewhere... so no crowns.  Boo.

The food was fantastic although we had to eat it with our hands and nothing else.  The tomato soup was similar to a bisque, and the cornish hen had a crispy outer skin and tender meaty bits on the inside.  I was happy to consume the steamed broccoli, but surprisingly the most difficult thing for me the grasp eating with my hands was the potato...?  I'm going to say that's just me... and not the potato's fault.  I usually HATE eating anything that requires my working with my hands [ie: peeling shrimp/crawfish] but I amazed myself with how efficiently I was able to consume my meal and finish before the beastly ogre I call my boyfriend.  Goes to show how well prepared the dish is...

Nothing for options though.  It's a pre-fixe menu with your choice of coke or some other soft drink liquid.  Servers run by and refill without disrupting too much of the show, and are quick to accomodate date when asking for extras like ketchup/condiments.

I was dressed to impress because I thought we might be going out afterward, but save it for later people.  NO reason to dress up for this place at all, since you're sitting in the dark and the focus is on the show.  It is also laid out like stadium seating, so make sure you line up for your seats next to those you are most comfortable with seeing you elbow deep in your medieval meal.

It was very fun, and entertaining as well to see everyone get so rowdy and pounding their fists on the wooden table in front of them.  

Moments later, we are served food, which consists of chicken, broccoli, potatoes, and a biscuit.  The meat was very moist, and can easily be ripped from the bone.  The potatoes were hearty and filling, but soft, and delicate.  The broccoli was a bit under-cooked.   As for the biscuit, it tasted like the ones served at KFC.

The show is great for:
- Drinking as many beers as you can and yelling at dudes riding around on horses.
- Becoming immediately and inexplicably nationalistic about the ""country"" they sit you in. We were in ""France"" and instantly wanted nothing more than French victory in battle. Screw Spain!
- Vegetarians. Just tell the waiter when they first come by, and they'll bring out pasta for you instead of a whole chicken.
- Giving the finger to typical ""take yourself seriously"" Vegas and just having a good time.
- People who don't care about historical accuracy in the slightest. The ""Czar of Russia"" pledging allegiance to ""King Arthur's son, Chris""? Ouch! Good thing they have a full bar.

Be aware that there is a loud cannon going off often throughout the show.  The main cannons were located near the gates, closest to Ireland and France. If you're easily startled or have a heart condition, I'd highly recommend asking for a seat in either Austria or Spain.  I sat in Ireland and despite our section being the second loudest (to Dragon), our knight was killed off relatively early.

*  Establishment
-  Encouraging

 It's a fun theater!  Stadium style seating broken into sections.  You're on a bench with a table in front of you.  Smart walkways allow servers to get to your spot unconstructed.  Lots of AC kept it cool.

*  Service
-  Outstanding

For what these servers have to contend with, I think they do a great job!  Their job is tough!  Was waited on by three different people during the show.  Not one of them let our drinks run out.  Excellent job!  I wish others in environments a fraction as challenging would do as good!

*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
-  Outstanding

For a ""gimmick"" meal, this was good!  (Pic)

First, hot tomato soup!  It was GREAT!  And I'm not a fan of tomato soup!  

Then a hot plate gets delivered to everyone at the same time with a Cornish game hen, two red potatoes, a tree of broccoli and a biscuit.  A bit later you get an apple pastry.  It was very well cooked for this simple rustic meal.  There's no flatware (although you can request it) but it's all easy (and fun) to eat with your hands.  If you choose to participate you'll be yelling and cheering along with the crowd!

*  What I'll remember

It was more fun than I expected!  I didn't pay for my tickets though so I'm not sure how I would have felt paying $75 per person.

I purchased tickets for my boyfriend for Christmas. Last night we went for the 6:00 show. Our waiter was Robert. He was very polite and funny. He answered questions I had about where the horses were kept as he was taking our drink order (drinks aren't included). 
We just had water but someone beside us got a tube of jello shots. I've never had them but was tempted. 
Our seats were Awesome! Front row in the France section. We were seated right where all the Knights and horses enter. Every seat is a good seat. They move around and don't do all the show in one spot. 
Our food came fairly quick. Everyone gets a whole Cornish hen, couple of whole potatoes, broccoli, and a biscuit. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Oh yeah no silverware be ready to eat with your hands. LoL! Once you start to eat the huge round table comes down in the middle and the Knights eat as well. Dessert is served later. An apple turn over. My boyfriend said it was good. I'm allergic to cinnamon so I couldn't eat it. :(
The show is nonstop sword fights, dancers, hunks, etc. 
If your in town with kids take them. Very kid friendly!
No photography aloud. Sad face! I did sneak a couple at the end of the show. 
Awesome experience. Would have been a perfect 5 star review but I had one problem. They took photos of everyone before dinner. Lady Taking photos skipped us and went to the next couple. I informed our server. He told the lady and she looked at us and then went on about her day. We never got our photo taken. Since they don't allow photography it would have been a nice keepsake.

It's a smaller arena than Medieval Times, and the food was better, in my opinion.  It's tomato soup, cornish game hen, potato wedges, broccoli, a dinner roll, and apple streusel for dessert.  I usually don't like tomato soup, but this stuff was so good we asked for seconds (and surprisingly, they gave it to us!).  The game hen was actually quite good, although the potato wedges left something to be desired.  The streusel was awesome.

We sat in the Russian section, which was handicap accessible for my mom.  We went on a Sunday, so it wasn't full (the poor Austrian king only had one row rooting for him).  I couldn't hear the beginning part with Merlin and the jester - I know they were talking, but the sound system made them sound garbled, so I have no idea what they were saying.  I understood the rest of the show though.  The show itself was entertaining, and our guy was a bit of a bully, so we had fun cheering him on.  When he didn't win, I cheered for the king of Spain because he was cute ;)

Overall, it was an entertaining show, and we felt we got our money's worth.  I'd probably go again if I were back in Vegas :)",B1CvITVmO9aD6NFk0U_Y1A,1,1,4,-HbROVoPcF9mV3LIVWTxdg

Last nights experience wasn't as good as the first couple times but it was still good. My fiancés chicken was very moist but mine was pretty dried out. All else was good except that my waiter didn't refill my drink until the show was almost over (it had been empty for 15 minutes and he walked by it 4 times but never stopped) he did fill my fiancé's cup but she was drinking something different and I guess he couldn't be bothered to bring the sprite to me.

Had we not gotten the tickets on the 2 for $75 deal I would definitely be giving this show 3 stars. I had been to Vegas many times, and brought my husband for the first time, this was something that I had always been interested in seeing so when I saw the deal we got the tickets. The show is very lively! We left high spirited and ready for a fun night. It is also a really good deal with the dinner included. We were full the rest of the night! 

What I disliked about the show: I thought that it was WAY to short! It could have had a few more scenes in it, maybe a comedy scene, or a bit more to the tournament. The show definitely needs a bit more bulking up, even if only 15 minutes longer. Also, I found the waiters and waitresses very distracting, while watching the show at an already blocked view because the person to my left would not sit back in his chair, the servers would also come around and block views which I found really annoying. I felt like they rushed the service a bit and could have easily not bused the tables until after the show was over. They came to give the food, to bus the food, bring the desert, bus the desert, bring ordered drinks which took forever to get, and then the bill and back for change. it was very distracting!

I was like ""oh come on guys, What are we 8th grade medieval larper nerds, the good looking people going to the MGM clubs are going to come over here and pick on us just for being outside the door."" - Just like high school all over again. 

With that said I am so happy I went. I had so much fun!!!!! Now..... disclaimer this is only fun if you get into it, if you don't then you will just be a bummer. The food is not that bad, my friend devoured his entire tiny chicken bird in under 3 minutes. For vegetarians they give you ravioli which I don't think is as good as the tiny bird they serve the regulars. 

During the performance you get to see knights and some pretty good choreographed sward scenes, Merlin, dancing medieval chicks, fireworks, fire and best of all horses. 

At the end of the show some of the knights will come out and take picture with you and answer you questions. During the time I had to drag my friend away after she started to ask the knight if he liked his job and the horse he was riding during the show, i think she was hitting on the knight, she begs to differ.

The show is very interactive, and they want you to participate and cheer in their ways.

The chicken has more bones than meat, but everything including veggies was seasoned well, and very filling. If the chicken had more meat, it would have been too much food.

Once 6:00 PM comes, the waiters come around with what they call ""Dragon Blood Soup"" which actually tastes exactly like spaghetti sauce watered down. It was pretty good.

If you go to their website you can get them to text you for an extra two dollars off each ticket and wait in VIP line. Make sure to get your tickets before 5pm because you have to then go over to Excalibur to pick up your tickets and choose your seats and team. I think it is their ploy to get you into their casino early. Last time we went to the early show and this time the late show. So after we got our tickets we went back to our hotel to get ready and then went back to Excalibur. Show is downstairs by the kids gaming area. They make you wait outside until they are ready. You go in and get your seats. Our waiter tried to serve our kids Coke. We asked don't you have anything else and he didn't seem to happy about that. He offered Sprite. I asked if he had anything non carbonated for my toddler but he said no. So we all got Sprite. And it had tons of ice in it. Next he brought tomato soup.  Then the meal, which was a giant undercooked broccoli, a hen, a biscuit and some potatoes. The chicken was pretty dry so my husband used his soup refill to dip it in. At the end was dessert which was some sort of pastry.

The main reason we went to this show again because last time the food and service was better and most shows you have to be a minimum of 5 years old. Here my 2 year old was free.

As far as the show...we liked it better last time too. This time it was more scary for the little one. Most of the show was the same though. Horses, fighting, jousting, fireworks, explosions, etc. Me and my son also got allergic this time too.  Towards the end of the show I had to take a Benedryl and was wheezing by the end. Once I left the arena it went away. They do warn you of this, but last time it didn't bother me. Not sure if it was because there seemed to be more smoke effects this time.",DAyxABaN6tiSxxo_50v8KQ,1,0,3,OHriYPzb9TEsCNJx1Sqy4w

The show (plus the extras) can be a bit pricey, but here are some tips to save a bit of $$$:

Do the show without the meal.  The novelty of eating without utensils isn't worth the extra $15.  With the abundance of restaurant and buffet options the city has to offer, your $15 can buy you much more than a dried chicken, a sprig of broccoli and tomato soup.  We took the family to the Buca de Beppo upstairs after the show.  The cost was about the same, the food tastier and we got to take home our leftovers.

Buy your show tickets directly from the box office to save on surcharges.

Skip the drinks and cocktails.  A souvenir Tournament of Kings cup/chalice isn't worth the $14 price tag.",o--zHBo8ihFUeqBhbx7Qag,8,4,4,Yxq2JUFyxOA1HqEINAz-Iw
5428667,2014-09-07,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"This is why I stay at Excalibur.  For the price, you get a great show with great food.  There is audience participation, comedy, and a lot of action.  Some buffets in Vegas cost as much as this show.  So why not treat yourself and see a show while you eat?

You can see how the actors and actresses actually enjoy what they are doing.  They do a good job in each of their parts and don't ham it up at all.  Even the waiters and waitresses get involved with the songs, actions, etc.  In previous shows they didn't, so I am glad to see this happening.

The food you eat with your hands - no utensils.  So expected to get your hands messy.  But you can clean up afterwards.  The food is filling, so you won't eat for the rest of the night.  After the show some of the performers come out to talk, have your picture taken with them, etc.

5481345,2017-08-16,1,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"On our most recent Las Vegas vacation, we attended the Tournament of Kings at Excalibur.  I've always wanted to do this, so we finally got a group of 7 to go!  We bought our tickets ahead of time, as we heard many performances are sold out.  

The show started at 6:00 PM, but we got in line around 5:30 PM.  We were pretty far back in line at that time, as folks must have started lining up an hour before the show.  We winded pretty far back into the ""Fun Dungeon"" (the downstairs arcade area of the hotel).  Eventually, we made it to the front, where we were escorted to our seats.  

Each section of the area is named for a country, which in turn is represented by one of the knights in the tournament.  We were in the Spain section; everytime Spain's Knight came out to perform our section cheered, while booing all the other knights.  

The performance was really cool.  The Knights rode horses into the arena, sometime in very tight formation.  The story was kitschy, but it was to be expected. We enjoyed the show for what it was, just a fun 2 hours.  It was difficult to hear some of the speeches, as the sound system seemed a little old and outdated.

The food was good, too. It started with tomato soup, followed by the main course of an entire(!) cornish game hen, roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli and a biscuit, with a pastry dessert.  In keeping with the theme, no utensil were given, just some napkins and a wet-wipe at the end.  Soda and water were included with the meal, though servers also offered alcohol.  If you are not used to eating with your hands, don't think about it too much and dive in!

Much of modern Las Vegas tries to bill itself as very sophisticated and upscale.  But sometimes, you just want a fun and exciting show, no matter how quaint or dated it may seem.  The Tournament of Kings doesn't try to pretend it's something other than it is:  just a fun time for the entire family.",yv9jvt_58q9ZQzl9i8xUmw,3,1,5,TlzGh4lCwTx_ZyewS3wR1w

The theater is located downstairs, in the same area as the arcade/kids area. The arena isn't very big, but by the time the show started the theater was only half full. 
The show itself was very good. The actors/actresses did a great job in getting the crowd involved. Be prepared to cheer and shout, the more involved you are the more fun the show will be. The show was entertaining but seemed very rushed, it only lasted about an hour and half. I think there were some parts that they could have expanded on.
The food was only ok. We started out with a tomato soup that reminded me of chef boyardee. Very soon after the soup the main entrees were brought out, which consisted of a cornish game hen, potatoes, and a biscuit....which you are to eat without any utensils...overall tasted average. Dessert was a strawberry strudel. The food was nothing to really talk about, but again was very rushed.  There was very little time between each course, and it felt like we were being rushed to eat faster.  Our plates were being cleared very quickly, so if you watch the show too much you may miss out on dinner. Near the end of the show, when it was getting really good, it was hard to see the performance since the waiters were so busy clearing off all the plates.

it's a show that comes with food.  the show is pretty interactive and very family friendly (if you have kids, i'd suggest this show).  The food was actually pretty decent...but bland if there wasn't salt.

CONS:
can be kind of cheesy (but not that bad).  

WHY DID I GO??:
I was a newbie to vegas, so I pretty much said i'm down to everything my friends wanted to do.  My friend suggested the dinner/show which i was hesitant to say yes to to begin with, mainly because for $70 (with taxes & fees included) i rather spend a little more money for a super good show...which kind of turned out to be true.  granted, i showed up a little tipsy, and LITERALLY fell asleep during the show, but from what my friends said, our king (the section you sit in) Norway was pokin fun at that drunk girl passed out in the second row...so i was glad to provide entertainment for everyone.  but for dinner AND a show, it was ok.  probably wouldn't go see it again, just because it's not my type of thing...unless i had kids, then i'd take them to see this cause it was fun.",-YXR32cxurtDwq2AnsIh4w,0,0,2,cSl3ISXJz7AGX4TVAN-uYw

Great eye candy lol. Team Ireland was hot! You can also take pix with the cast after the show. My issue was the wait staff. We got a beer at the start of the show and did not receive it till the end. Every seat has a meal. The standard meal is chicken. But if you are a vegetarian you can switch it out. The man at the door said the wait staff will come around prior to the show beginning to ask for food orders. Well they never did. So when the meal came they gave me chicken dish. I nicely told the lady that I in fact was a vegetarian and to pls switch it out with something else. I did not touch the dish that was served to me once. She then replies that she can't change it once it was served and gave me a rude response and pushed the dish back in my fave like I had to eat it.

The dessert seemed very similar to an apple pop tart and was not amazing.  Their selection of sodas left a lot to be desired.  I inquired about soda flavors and it turned out they had I think two flavors and you get served Pepsi unless you specify otherwise.

The show was a lot of fun even if it was a bit cheesy.  The attacks looked like they were aimed for the opponents shield 75% of the time and I'm sure they were pulling punches...  I saw one attack which was pulled so much that it didn't make contact.  There was a lot more fire than I'd expected and the theatrics were entertaining even if the fighting didn't seem even remotely real.

The story seems like it is probably the same every time: The russian guy is a jerk and cheats at the games somehow, Mordred comes in, etc. etc.

We sat in the ""Dragon"" section and from what I can tell that was probably the best section to have been sitting in even though we were rooting for evil and thus were sure to lose.

The food was not great, but for $55 for two tickets(military discount), you canont beat it. I am not going to spend much time breaking down the entire show dynamics because they were great. I am only going to touch on what caused this show to NOT get 5 stars.

1. During the show a photographer goes around and takes a picture of your group and every other group in the show. The come around and give you the picture in a cheap plastic frame....we were under the impression it was part of the shows package. Later in the show they come around and ask you if you want to buy it for $20. The picture probably cost them about $1 at most, and for $55 a ticket, would be a great addition to make the show a 5 star rating.

2. The servers could be more dressed up and ""act"" a little bit more. The one thing the server said to us was, as he brough my wife some water ""I got this water from the moat, and cleaned all the green stuff out of it for you ma'am"". Cool, but more would be better.

Other than that....the show was amazing and cheaply priced.

Our only complaint is the service. We only saw our server once, after our soup was poured we never saw him again. The preshow had begun, the toasting took.place amd we still had empty glasses. The kings were introduced and our cups were still empty. We waived down a server from another section to get our glasses filled. 

Other sections received their food and even their dessert and our row still didn't have food. The jousting had started and two of us in our row still didn't have food. Again we waived down the server in the next section to come to the rescue. He was apologetic, he even filled most our glasses however he didn't have enough to fill everyone's glass.

Overall we left very disappointed in our experience, 4 @ $90 and to receive such poor service is inexcusable. 

There needs to be an overall supervisor or manager checking on the overall  guest ezperience.

Now, don't get me wrong, it was fun.  I am glad that I can now say that I've been.  However, the smell that hits you once you enter the Excalibur is enough to make me never want to return.

The arena is located in the ""Fun Dungeon,"" which is (of course) on the far side of the casino and downstairs, where the kids carnival games are.  So, if you are one of the many who brings their youngsters to this show, bring extra money for games or be prepared for unhappy children.

We sat in ""Austria.""  The rows are pretty wide and offer quite a bit of leg room, which was a surprise.  The price of your ticket includes soda and dinner, along with the show.  I overheard the girl next to me complaining that there were no other options, like iced tea - which I agree is kind of annoying. The waitress told her she could purchase juice from the bar, because they had it to make mixed drinks.  Kind of a rip off.

I am really on the fence as to whether this is truly kid friendly.  They don't provide silverware, so you have to eat everything with your hands.  Now, that's great for adults, but do you really want to hand a child a bowl of steaming hot tomato soup and say ""have at it?!"" Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  Also, I wonder if they provide any vegetarian friendly options, or if you would just be out of luck?

I know the show is about medieval times, but they need to update to the current year with some things!

Also, it's violent.  I wouldn't see it as a big deal, but I could see how some wouldn't want to take their kids to that.

It's a small theater/arena with 8 sections (7 countries & the villain). You get served your drinks first (i.e. sprite, pepsi, water) and you can also order alcoholic drinks (extra $$). Food wise, you get the tomato soup (and it's good!), a whole chicken, big piece of broccoli, & potatoes. I am never able to finish it, lol. But it's so good :]. NO UTENSILS so make sure you're willing to get down and dirty with your whole chicken (uncut in any shape or form).

The show itself is mediocre but not too shabby. Since I've sat through the show 3 times already, it's good enough for that, at least.

You have the knights and King Arthur and they're all having a tournament of kings. Dragon is your villain and there's a battle and all that jazz. Of course, Arthur's son is the one that stops him and you get a happily ever after scene after the defeat.

You'll also have Merlin the Wizard opening up the show. Him and a midget will show you how to properly cheer with your drinks & table slapping!

The show itself is always entertaining, no matter how many times you've seen it. The horsemanship these people show is outstanding.

Horses, jousting, wenches, dancing maidens, medieval garb, and delicious food how can you go wrong? 

Three course meal which is really good, juicy cornish game hen! 

This is a small scale version of ""Medieval Times"" 

By far the best dinner show in Las Vegas.

Now for my review.

Me, my wife, mom, dad and uncle all went to see this show. We sat in Norway which is pretty darn good seating. Russia and Dragon I think have the best seating. The food is really good. you get soup which is to die for, chicken, brocoli, roll, and some other stuff. The show is very entertaining and will keep you involved from start to finish. the production of the actors is awesome! They get very involved with the crowd and keep you drawn in. This show has been around for roughly 20 years but you would never know that by how everyone acts during the performance.

the soup was the highlight- good flavorful.
the cornish hen, dry, too lightly seasoned, etc
the broccoli, undercooked, hard, flavorless
the apple desert, bad. dry, flavorless not enough apple

and on top of that, the man serving the dessert was rushing and practically throwing the plates in front of people.... the put mine down so far that it flew off the plate and onto the table... whats he do??? pick it up put it back on my plate and continue on???!!!! 

luckily my friend was nice enough to give me his :) but seriously.... what the...?

the show itself was alright. nothing to write home about but something to see with the kids. i wouldnt ever purchase the tickets to it again though after this experience.

5918958,2012-08-24,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"The Tournament of Kings is a King Authur's Camelot themed dinner show performed at the ""Dungeon"" level of Excalibur.  It is a show geared towards families, younger audiences, and fans of the Renaissance Festival.

As it is a dinner show, you will be served a whole roasted cornish game hen (you are living large eating this presumably back in the knight in shinning armor fighting for the honor of your lady, hunting down the mystical dragon days... Ahhh, 'ye good olde days when life was so much more simpler), big old stalk of steamed broccoli, some red bliss potatos, and the magical never-emptied mug of brew or sweet carbonated elixir.  But the food is not the reason to go experience this, especially if you have never been to it.

The magic of Camalot, as told by knight kings from across the land, performing featsof knightly skills on horseback and sword play, is the reason to go.  Plus the ladies all love a picture (or three) with the knights after the show. 

Service is good.  The staff have years of banquet experience serving the guests of the Tournament of Kings, and you are usually too engrossed in what is happening in the arena than to notice that your nearly emptied mug of sweet fizzy elixir magically replenished itself.

Definitely go take your kids to enjoy this while they are young, and the magic to be awe and amused by the spectacles is high.  Although this show is also rather popular with the high school kids, as I have been told.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,2,4,gh8lp7EvuMUwyFTj3z98Jg

5931866,2013-01-20,0,6V_7ldr9tjmet0BdAnC34A,"I enjoyed the Tournament - it's a really good deal for its price.

Pepsi is the drink that comes complimentary - alcoholic beverages are extra. You can ask for water instead but refills are sporadic ( you need to ask the server when he passes by for it specifically). 

The food is more than filling - you get a whole Cornish hen, broccoli, potatoes, and biscuit. All delicious! Sadly, I couldn't finish it. Dessert was a toaster streudal (after eating a whole hen, I can't really complain).

Be careful - the whole meal you have to eat with your hand. And you will need to really contact your server to refill the water, or else they'll just forget about refilling your cup while they fill the others' cup full of Pepsi. 

The tournament itself was really good - some shirtless guys (yey!), plenty of comedy,sword fighting, lances, etc. Live horses.
They use pyrotechnics and a lot of lights.
