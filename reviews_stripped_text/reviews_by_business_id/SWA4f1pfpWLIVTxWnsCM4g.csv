Rude, lazy delivery chick.  She couldn't come up to my hotel room despite the 20% tip included in the online order.  I was resting in my undies and had to put clothes on to go downstairs.  Pizza is good and I would order again.",bFhSzTb92O5_K-j1vPIQvg,2,0,2,TodR0IYqsgVM9UxsEtNUtw

We ordered buffalo chicken pizza, which I would recommend if you reallllllllly like Gorgonzola ( blue cheese). Not spicy, but drizzled hot sauce on top and the chicken was good. We also had regular hot wings: good but could've used more sauce, however I prefer really wet wings. The mozzarella sticks were also pretty yummy! Can't wait to try the other pizza.",Ulu30-Gz32RBggy_x8b-dA,0,0,4,FoEaJOQcPw01kdk9PxV1_g
