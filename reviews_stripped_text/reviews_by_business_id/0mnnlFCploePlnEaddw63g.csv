The breading was good, not too much and the right amount of crunch. We also ordered a medium ""the works"" on thin crust. The crust seems to melt in your mouth. The marinara has a good balance of sweetness and spice and ties in the fresh ingredients wonderfully. We had leftover pizza which was amazing cold and even better reheated by using an air fryer. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The atmosphere was great and the place was clean. It's a little expensive, but totally worth it!!

None of us wanted the fries (but it comes with it anyway) which is why I would guess that it's so pricey?

1606590,2017-10-19,9,0mnnlFCploePlnEaddw63g,When Aurelio's Pizza relocated to this spot I was hoping that it would be better. Inside there was a funky ass smell and the girl at the register was nice but she didn't speak English very well so it wasn't easy to understand what she was saying. The food is way overpriced in my honest opinion. I shelled out $20 for a medium pizza which isn't what I would assume most people would expect to pay at a pizza chain..... I mean it doesn't say Wolfgang Puck on the building so come on! The cheese on my pizza tasted rotten and when I took a bite all the cheese and pepperoni pulled off together leaving just the crust. I'm not sure if the funky smell inside the restaurant was from the funky tasting cheese or not but all around this wasn't a great experience.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,16,11,1,ujOo57czYVSLe9k0uBEJyg

Our server was friendly and she did a good job of taking care of us that evening, but again- there was only one other table of customers. 
I ordered the dinner house salad which was huge. He ordered a medium stuffed pizza w/ sauce on the side. 
I just not a fan of the stuffed pizza idea, but I tried it anyway. It was just ok- it had a lot of dough. I'd rather fill up on the toppings. The sauce was very sweet to me. Not a thumbs up in my book. 
Was shocked to see that the pizza alone was 24$ ouch!

Same high priced pizza with many misses in the flavor department. I called to order a medium 1 topping pizza and the girl who answered was friendly and let me know the order would be ready in 15 minutes. Walking inside the tables all looked clean, but the floor was filthy and there was a smell that wasn't appetizing in the air. I walked to the counter and let them know I was picking up an order and then I was rung up. The total shocked me because I only ordered a medium 1 topping how could this be almost $20??? 

Thin Crust Pepperoni ($17.75 for a medium) - With tax my total was $19.21 which is outrageous for 1 pizza of this size and toppings. The sauce was sweet and actually, I liked it. The sauce was the only thing I liked. The cheese tasted spoiled which completely ruined the pizza. The pepperoni couldn't even be picked off, it stuck with the spoiled tasting cheese that wouldn't even stick to the crust. With each first bite the cheese and pepperoni just slid right off in all stuck together in one piece. I somehow made it through a square and a half (it's cut in squares) and then had to throw the rest on my plate out. The taste of that spoiled cheese was just too much. Aurelio's Pizza might be a long loved pizza chain, but for me there was nothing to love and it wasn't worth the money at all.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,56,51,1,oJASnGjSqrDi00cdV8_vTQ

3544315,2018-01-25,0,0mnnlFCploePlnEaddw63g,"Being from Chicago, I grew up eating Aurelio's. It was always my favorite thin crust pizza in the area! When our family went back to Chicago last summer for a visit, we made sure to have Aurelio's. It was delicious, as usual.

My parents retired in Las Vegas so we were all thrilled when Aurelio's opened there. We would always pick up a pizza on our way to visit them from the various Aurelio's locations. We even picked up one over Thanksgiving from this sole surviving location. Last week was the first time we sat in the restaurant to eat the pizza rather than having take-out.

The best part about our experience last week was the very friendly and attentive staff. We also enjoyed looking at the Chicago memorabilia displayed on the walls. And, the antipasto salad seemed much more generous when served on site rather than taking it to-go.

But, the taste of the pizza was somewhat disappointing. It did not taste like the pizza we have at the Aurelio's in Chicago. It really was just ok. However, I imagine we will still stop by here again when coming through town for nostalgia's sake.",c_ppawQYg_bXodROGWQlyQ,3,0,3,7_G9uaffwHJLCrcd4dxu6Q

The staff was very friendly and courteous. It was 4:30pm and we were the only ones there. 
We ordered a medium thin crust pizza with mushrooms olives and onions with a side of calamari. 
The calamari was pre-manufactured frozen variety with a freezer burned batter.
Hoping the pizza was better- well after one bite we preferred the calamari.
I can't really explain the flavor- but it was one of the worst we had ever have. First it was cut Chuck Cheese style, square cut, and served on a wire grate which is possibly the only way you shouldn't serve gooey pizza. 
The cheese was a bizarre blend of a grainy texture even melted. The sauce was a very thin tomato sauce. The mushrooms were good ! 
We eat  two square pieces and boxed it up for the kids to try. They looked at it and didn't try it- so no review.
