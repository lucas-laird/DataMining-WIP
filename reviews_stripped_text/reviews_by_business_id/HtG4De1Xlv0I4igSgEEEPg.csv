Let me start by saying that my order took over an hour to get to my house, and everyone knows the pit of bad delivery is the time. My 12 buffalo wings arrived so soggy that it was not a pleasure to eat at all, and last but not least instead of giving me the 2 liter Sprite that I asked for, I got 6 cans of Sprite which basically topped this horrible dinner off. How are they not even going to call and ask if we would like a different soda?! 6 cans though! I would have much rather ate Pizza Hut, and I probably will from now on.

I had to wash my doggie beds at the laundromat next door so went there for the Big Mama slice combo with salad and drink. Probably the best pepperoni pizza slice I've had in a long time! The crust was super thin, which I truly love! Liked the crispy burnt ends as well. I ordered Italian dressing with my salad but got ranch I think, no worries. The toppings were fresh for a generic salad. The dude (owner?) was very friendly - he took what cash I had so I didn't have to use my credit card. I was about $2 short. So I went back yesterday and ordered the same thing, and tipped this time. Don't know the guy's name who runs the place, but he's a friendly guy and I will be going there more often!

He is the type that just orders from Pizza Hut or Domino's, and my bf and I were trying to look for something that is better. We went for this place, because it was close in proximity to his house with online ordering. 

After leaving our hotel and getting gas, we go here and our order is ready 15 minutes before the fulfillment time! We had ordered the Suro Pizza (cheddar cheese added) in the X-Large size along with an order of mozzarella sticks. The order also came along with a free 2-liter soda, which made it even better. We paid a bit under $35 for all of it, but it is definitely worth every penny.

As we head to our friends house, the scent of the pizza keeps permeating our senses. It smelled wonderful, and as we got into his house we devoured it really quickly. All of that was the perfect size for 3 extremely hungry people. The ingredients all tasted fresh, and there was a lot of care that was put into the pizza.

visit 1: I ordered takeout by phone.  They said 30-40 minutes.  Got there after 35 minutes and they had not even started my order. 

visit 2: Woman behind the counter was taking orders.  After completing the orders, she went back to the kitchen (which is open) and did not wash her hands.  I'm not paranoid about this, but she had been handling money and credit cards and then sticking her hands in food!

visit 3: A man (most likely the manager) and a male employee (seemed new) got into an argument over incorrect orders.  This was caused by a patron returning to the store 5 minutes before that upset because a large portion of his order was missing.  

All I can say is poor management.  They always seem understaffed when it is busy and they lack any sort of professionalism.  The pizza is mediocre.  Kind of like cheap, college town pizza.

Our office is located about 4 blocks away from this place.  The web coupon special I used also came with two 2 liter bottles of soda, and the price, with delivery, was $35.88.  The pizza came within 5 minutes of the scheduled time, however arrived completely cold and the cheese already hardened and solidified, and instead of the Coke I requested, I received Dr. Pepper.  To say the pizza was nasty is an understatement.  I immediately called and asked for the manager, and a person who said his name was Dion said he was the manager.  He was rude, nasty, and insulting.  At first, he said he would send another pizza, but by this time, all my staff were gathered and hungry.  Because of our work schedule, there was no way to wait another hour or so to get another one, so I said ""no thanks"" and said I wanted to register my compliant.  After I got off the phone, one of my staff convinced me that I should let them deliver another, since I paid good money for the junk that I received.  I called back, got Dion again, and when I said that I changed my mind and wanted the new pizza delivered, he refused, saying ""why should I send you another pizza?""  He virtually screamed at me, told me to get over my anger issues (huh, really???), to the extent I had to hang up the phone.  

I should mention this is the second time in just about two months that I received a pizza from them in this condition.  The beginning of November I ordered a pizza to be delivered to a friend's new house in the early evening after we helped her move...it was also delivered on time, but was also cold and hardened.

Things that Big Mama's has failed massively on include:

1) Making me wait 20 minutes before taking my order because the owner wanted to fuck around with a soda display. I was the only person in the restaurant. I could understand a wait because my food was cooking etc, but to make me wait simply because you want to load soda on a shelf that's not even meant for that? Seriously?

2) Same visit: A customer comes in and attempts to order a special that's advertised outside. The owner says ""Sorry. It's not a special anymore."" Customer says ""But, it's advertised outside right now."" Owner says ""Too bad. I say it's not a special anymore.""

3) Sent my roommate in to pick up an order, and they would not let him have a copy of the receipt. I had to watch my bank statement for quite a while to ensure they didn't charge more.

4) Brought in a Restaurant.com coupon. Suddenly the prices for my food increased. How am I paying more for food when I DON'T have a coupon than when I do? Just because I'm using a coupon doesn't mean my $8.99 pizza suddenly becomes $16. Had Rebel's been open I'd have left right there. 

5) Jacked their price from $8.99 for a large 2 item to $10.99. Oh, and those are only ""walk-in prices"". If you try ordering that online or delivery, expect to pay $20ish. 

For those of you considering getting the Groupon for this place? Don't. Seriously, it's not worth it. Go to Whazz Up Pizza or Enzo's and spend less money for better food. You'll thank me later.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,2,0,1,IZf0Uu_lEERFm1Qho8Cs8w

That being said, everything we ordered yesterday was done not only with extremely prompt service, but with a smile.  The manager of this branch of Big Mama's was a real nice guy; takes care of his customers and made sure everything they ordered was done to their requests. 
My Wife and I ordered a few things more than just the pie because we had one of those coupon's that you could use if you ordered up to a certain amount. Personally I'm really glad we had the coupon: not for the reason that we were saving money, but that it had me try a few different things other than the Pizza. We started with the Antipasto salad: This actually exceeded my expectations of a walk in pizza joint salad: It had all the normal things that a antipasto salad would have, and a sliced pickle. Now personally I've never had one with a sliced pickle in it, but it actually added a a really nice surprise to a fairly common recipe of this salad. Would definitely eat this again. One of my gripes that I have for most pizza joints is their wings: If they don't cook it to my specifications or have a really bland sauce, then it just fails my taste-buds. I'm happy to report that again, they exceeded my expectations. The wings were cooked extra crispy like I prefer, and the sauce that was used was something I can't say I've had before. Not sure if this is a homemade sauce or an altered common sauce, but it was pretty darn tasty. Had a nice spice to it, without being overpowering.  The pizza arrived at just the right time: just after having a few wings to wet our appetite for more. The pizza was very delicious and reminded me of some of the shops back east in NY. All fresh ingredients and the crust was pretty decent to boot. 
Normally I don't write too much of a review for food places, but this one really put me in a different mindset: This place deserves credit for the food they serve and the service they provide.  Albeit not the best location in the valley for me personally, I still foresee myself making trips down to this joint in the future, and recommending this to all of my friends.",XiUV-1CH3xzHIkPCa_aF5Q,1,1,5,SL6kdz2cK_uB3HCv6GW3wQ

I have been to Big Mama's & Papa's in southern California before, so was familiar with their pizza when I saw the Groupon pop up, I was happy to purchase. 

We ordered the extra-large pizza with Pepperoni and pineapple (my fella's idea). Their pizza is pretty good, not the best but solid. The pizza's are HUGE! Great for large parties. It's thin crust and definitely a good value for what you get. 

If it was closer, I would definitely make this a regular place for deliver or take out for get togethers at my house for a big group.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,1,3,ixbbujo_sWUe--Es3ktr2g
