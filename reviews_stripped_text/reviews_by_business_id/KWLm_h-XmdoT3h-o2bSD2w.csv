BF has been hanging out at the AC sports book lately, so we had dinner here last night. Specials include a $10 prime rib and shrimp, $5 steak and eggs or ham and eggs, and a few others- BF preferred the prime rib dinner, which did not have shrimp but came in a larger size with soup or salad, rolls, vegetable of the day, and choice of potato. I tried his meat and it was actually surprisingly good, as was the au jus, which I usually find too salty.

I opted for the Wednesday dinner special of roasted pork loin with mashed potatoes and pan gravy with the same sides as above- meat was actually surprisingly good, but could have used a smidge more gravy. I liked the potatoes and I'm usually a little picky about them- slightly salty, seemed to me bad with smashed baby reds which are my favorite. Vegetable of the day was canned corn, which was lackluster and mostly flavorless. 

FInal note about the side salads that we started with: in addition to being rather large, they're drenched in dressing- so if you're counting calories you really should ask for it on the side. That being said, lettuce and other vegetables were crisp and fresh.

Service was a little less than impressive: took our server a good 10 minutes to approach us for the first time, he was a bit short with us, and when I asked for a cup of chili he snapped at me and said it only came in a bowl portion. Kind of annoyed about that, kind of annoyed about how he pointed it out. Either way, apparently you have to go with a bowl for chili- duly noted.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,3,zVGo6cDgcEHFd7zgZ5V9ww

Last month my wife and I went to the Sourdough Cafe at Arizona Charlies Boulder Hwy location. The service was so bad we walked out after waiting more than 30 minutes just for our water and coffee. Yesterday we took a chance and went back to Sourdough Cafe with my elderly father thinking this couldn't happen again... 
Silly me, turns out we had the same server, a middle aged caucasion woman blondish hair and she was the only server and no runners to help. She also had no sense of urgency whatsoever and her job was to do everything. We ordered coffee for the 3 of us andplace our order. 30 minutes later, coffee pot empty and no servers in sight my dad walked out, went downstairs and got a hot dog.

2229597,2011-02-13,0,KWLm_h-XmdoT3h-o2bSD2w,"We went around 11 pm on a weekend. We were seated quickly, had our beverage orders taken (1 coffee, 1 beer) and were ID'd for the beer we ordered, then recieved only the coffee. Turns out the busser couldn't serve beer or something despite being of age. When our server made his way over, we had to reorder the beer and show ID again. 

After placing our orders, we quickly recieved the soup; a thick, processed-ham flavoured ordeal that had probably been simmering since early that day as it had thickened into a mud-like consistency. 

Then we waited. And waited. We watched several tables finish. Our waiter ran about doing his rounds until we had to flag him down to ask for another beer. After about twenty, thirty minutes our food arrived. We had ordered chicken 'tenders' (whatever that means) as an appetizer but they came out with the entrees. The boy had a steak while I had the cobb salad. His steak was flavorless and tasted like poor quality meat cooked without any love. He ate several bites and sent it back. The tenders were moist but on par with frozen grocery store offerings. The salad was the alone stand out as it was a MASSIVE bowl full of salad. I usually feel silly ordering a salad out when I can make one exactly to my likings for about the same amount of dough, but this thing was big enough to split between 3 people easily and be satisfied. 

Our server was a lot more expedient and attentive after the steak was sent back, and the hostess came by to inquire as to what was wrong. She seemed genuinely concerned that we enjoy our meal and told us how to avoid being re-carded for beer (go to the security cage, prove your age and get a wrist band) so the star is for her.

It's cheap food and if you're staying there it's a nice late night option if you're not in the mood for Sbarro. We'll probably be headed to Ellis island next time, though, as the environment is a bit nicer and the beer is cheap, generously served and the food is about the same if not a little better.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,2,1,1,li2aw5ENFfoqjTQ4WclhHg

2963856,2008-01-12,6,KWLm_h-XmdoT3h-o2bSD2w,"If Delmonico's was the highlight of my trip, this was the lowlight.

I have some repressed memories stored up when I stepped in here, but I never quite remembered why. I did remembered staying at Arizona's Charlie a few times when I was much younger. 

Long ago when there was a convention called COMDEX, a computer geek convention that is much bigger than CES or Comic Con would be here in Vegas. The rooms would jumped up to ridicious high prices and yet we couldn't get any rooms on the strip or near the convention center. Arizona Charlie would be the one that bailed us out with cheap and yet reasonable prices.

I did remembered coming to Sourdough Cafe a few times, but I still can't remembered why I am having eerie feeling about this place.

When my buddy and I was wounding down our trip and getting ready to go home, I suggested this place only because I remembered there was a breakfast special that is less than $3. It's a good price and awesome way to end the trip.

Here's why my memories started to flood when the menu was presented...

In order to get the discount for the $2.99 special of Steaks and Eggs and that $2.79 special for the ham and eggs......... you will need to present a PLAYER'S CLUB CARD. That was a fine print you have to read in the menu to find that out. 

In essence, they wanted you to fill out some form like CVS Pharmacy or Ralph's and enroll in some honky dink program that their casino is having. Frankly, I could not understand on why they don't just offered it if it's PRINTED on the menu. Yes, there is an asterisk and a fine print in the menu, but it's just tacky and a little inconvenient just so you can go to some info booth and enroll into that Player's club, so in turn to get a discount at the breakfast joint.

Then I started to remember again... it was that my pals from many years ago would be searching the lobby, casino, and the hotel's hallways just so they can find a place to enroll in that program. When we couldn't find it, we had to stand again in the long line (Yes, this is a popular joint for the locals who love these specials, apparently I found out they enroll in another program to get the shorter line that is next to the line for the regular folks). 

So the long ordeal to find the place to enroll in that Player's club was not worth it in the first place, then to stand back in the long line for it was a big slap in the face. It hit me right in the gut when I remembered about that from a decade ago.

We're not talking about the menu printing up regular price and you would have to present a coupon to get the meal lower. No, we are talking about a blatant hook just to entice you to come here and then wham!...you can't get that special without a string attached. I know they make that fine print, but it's border lined on false advertising (not quite, but to me it was almost). By having different advertising around the web pages and having other web sites to promote that special grates me at times only because it's not that special.

Let's be frank, it's only about $4 more if you didn't join the Player's Club. Not a big whoop, but left a sour taste in my mouth when we left. I did wound up ordering the ham and eggs that was not bad, but not worth the full price. Even it was a discounted, I'm still hesitant to decide if I would come back for here regularly on my Vegas trips.

The service was OK and the waiter did his best to sympathize with us. I think he get that a lot from people who wondered why the price had a string attached. The meal was ordinary to say the least and I just can't see why this place was be popular for a 24 hour joint that never closes. The locals probably kept the place alive.

Just be aware that there will be a wait in the morning before 11am, a long wait in fact. Then realized in that the Steak and Eggs or the Ham and Eggs are not worth the hassle for the special. 

Order something else to avoid the frustration.

Also, the ""grill marks"" looked like they were drawn on with a sharpie. The only thing that was good was the salad I had with no dressing or add-ons (croutons, etc.). My mother who had Italian dressing on her salad said it was incredibly salty. She ordered the Porterhouse Steak and had the same result as me. The staff was respectful, but due to the poor quality I experienced I will never return to this restaurant.",oYE7N1PT5aMPPZ1MAEm1vg,1,1,1,j-XKkFYbO8nZM5d2Nfpp1Q

Ellis Island used to hold that distinction until they raised their prices by a dollar but I never really liked Ellis  anyway on account of their charred brick of steak they gave you.

This place, while way off the strip, has even better steak and eggs than Ellis and is cheaper. And the piece they give you isn't 50% fat! Not only that, instead of those dull string beans and potatoes Ellis gives you, you get hasbrowns. Nom nom nom.",enNgSlVFfjDtegqVsVUYKw,1,0,4,fLd347st4K6tPCh1JzYrmA

Family loves the wings! I am tried a few things on the menu, the Sombrero skillet for breakfast was good. A quesadilla appetizer, the chicken tenders, and the sandwiches are good. Some of the people i went with did not like their food but really you cant expect to have a good spaghetti with meatballs at a place this cheap, like i said, you get what you pay for. It is just okay if you dont wish to spend a lot and just want something quick and easy, the best part is the ladies that serve you. So nice!",PN8DeWon7ytlT9dVKBLuKA,1,1,3,LvlnDbB2Q0ElcUnPCr_8gQ

I went with a friend around 12:45 am & we were seated promptly. Tony our waiter was such a sweetheart! Super friendly & checked on us periodically. The food is decent for the price. You pay for what you get basically. The only downside is we were rushed to pay because the manager had to drop her bank for the night or else we would've had to wait until 2:30am. Which I completely understand, but it was kind of an inconvenience. I'll probably be back if I'm on this side of town again & want to eat for cheap :) oh & their $2.50 margaritas are good too.",T7wGe2rsUtDfUrLYwU3d4w,2,2,3,7nJIjBRZgoq3h6g32iL5Aw

This is a typical casino eatery. It is right next to the stuff-yourself buffet where you can eat your fill to overflowing. Here, at the Sourdough Cafe, you will leave with money in your pocket and without spending an arm and a leg.

I had the hamburger and fries for 4.99 less 10% for the club card. Draft beer is only $2.00.

The hamburger was cooked to order and was just right. You can add cheese or fried onions for a little added extra cost.

Across the casino (you are upstairs by the way) is a bar with a number of TV screens that will entertain you while you eat if you are alone. Between you and the TVs is a floor of hopeful gamblers pushing buttons and waiting for the reels to match up and the bells to ring. Jackpot!

5513349,2013-04-08,2,KWLm_h-XmdoT3h-o2bSD2w,"Over the past few years I have had many meals here at Sourdough Cafe.  Some hits and some misses.  But, that is the human factor of eating out.  You never know if you are there on an off day for the restaurant or if they are on the ball.  But, the quality of Sourdough remains the same.  The food is pretty good.  Everything from the players card specials to the desserts.  Nothing mind blowing but you leave satisfied.  With all of that said, here is my review from my last visit.

For best access to Sourdough Cafe, park on the top floor of the parking lot.  It is on the right hand side as you walk through the doors.  

We stood in line to wait to be seated.  It wasn't that busy but it seems like you always have to wait for a couple of minutes before they seat you.  No big deal...

We were led to our table and given our menus.  But, there was no need as we only had one thing on our minds... The huge Banana Splits.  Yum - a - dum - dum!  

It took a few minutes for our drink order to be taken and a couple of minutes more for the server to get to us.  Again, no big deal.  It's a good time to catch up and hangout with friends.  So we order our boat of ice cream.  Vanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate ice cream, banana, various sauces, mountain of whipped cream, sprinkle of nuts and a cherry.  In the past I have made the mistake of ordering one just for myself only to claim defeat.  Not this time.  There were four of us and we bought two to split.  We were gluttonous and before we hit sweet overload; we ordered some fries to counter it.  Smart thinking!!!

And, so the night ends with the check.  I don't remember how much it was exactly but I believe the Banana Splits were only $6 a pop.  What a great deal.  

*on a side note: we found out that the server has to make the banana splits themselves.  And we were told that if we wanted / needed more nuts or whipped cream to let them know.

We made sure to tip well after we heard that... So good job!!!

*another side note:  I would have taken pictures but I was given a ration of crap from my friends for trying to do so earlier.  And, being insecure because of it, I didn't take any.  I'll man up next time.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,0,0,4,RMxDSvBXHJppvAaz3BRRHA

A lot of locals come here for the cheap specials.
They have some good ones different nights.And if you have a players card you can also get mailings with specials.

Sometimes there is a line to get in I have to say because it seems service is never too great! But the line can go pretty fast depending on how fast the tables get cleared or if someone is near the area to seat you.
Be prepared most of the time to sit  and wait a bit before the waiter comes to your table,
I have never figured out why it is so bad here. Once in a great while you may hit it lucky,

Its good for breakfast as well as most of the food we have tried is not bad here at all. If it wasn't so cheap I am sure no one would go here because it is always the same way with service.
Otherwise we suggest if your hungry and your at the casino why not eat here.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,2,2,3,WpZtZfDX2_z72_E70HhGSg

Tried the signature sandwich Reuben, it was good and a decent portion. The potato salad was the standout, however. It was ""loaded"" potato salad, with bacon & green onions. Very tasty, could've eaten a ton of it. They should do more with it, like a special dish that features it.
