Business was slow but this place has potential especially with Borinka salsa group playing on Saturdays which is something not offered at other Peruvian restaurants. Being an American-born Peruvian, I've always had high expectations of Peruvian food comparing it to my mother's. We started off with Choros a la Chalaca (mussels on shell w lime juice) that were rich in flavor. Food came out with a great appearance and in a timely manner. Boyfriend had Parihuela (seafood chowder w shrimp, clams, fish, mussels and squid) and I ordered Lomo Saltado (tender beef strips w onions and tomotoes rice and french fries). Both choices were really filling and enough to share with each other. Server didn't drop the check off after he bussed our table. We had to go up to the register to pay which is no problem but we weren't informed. We would definitely return. Giving it 4 stars because of it's priceyness.

1893111,2018-03-21,2,bY5f0CV5u3L1b7bGuNUA8A,"As I plan a trip to Peru, I'm craving the foods I hope to eat when I get there later this year. We don't have too many Peruvian options in town but I decided to take a pescatarian foodie friend for a dinner date here to check it out. We shared a trio of dishes and left full and happy. 

CAUSA DEL SABOR: A layered appetizer of mashed potato and tuna (or chicken), in the shape of a heart. Flavors and textures we typically wouldn't mix in the US but they harmonized well in this dish. 
CEVICHE MIXTO: Served on a decorative, fish-shaped platter, this dish is well portioned for the $20 price. The mix of fish, octopus, shrimp, and crab was fresh and accented with sides of sweet potato, corn, and cancha (corn nuts). Get at least one of their ceviches when you come!
CAUCHA DEL MARISCOS: In the fusion section of the menu as a ""seafood fried rice"", similar to arroz con mariscos but with slightly different seasonings and preparation. This was good and paired well with our other dishes. Again, large portion for the ~$20 price.

Due to the pricing and portion sizes, I'd recommend this more for a group than for a date night. They do also have breakfast specials and weekend-only specialties. I'm in the area for work occasionally and look forward to coming back for the lomo saltado. 

NOTE: They have live music and salsa dancing on Saturdays, and our server said they book up in advance. I like to be able to have conversation when I dine, so this is a deterrent for me but YMMV.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,6,4,SK2bxRY2nJfXoLnihC1VgA

Also had an appetizer that was called tri color. It was 3 separate potato dishes in 3 different sauces. Huacaty, huancaina, and rocoto. Sauces were ok and potatos were dry. They were definitely not cooked that morning. They also had the taste of the refrigerator. My wife is Peruvian and we have eaten at all the Peruvian restaurants in Las Vegas.

2748214,2016-01-13,0,bY5f0CV5u3L1b7bGuNUA8A,"I wanted to try out a Peruvian restaurant with my family while I was in town and we wanted it to be close to the airport since my sister was getting in around dinner time and this was one of the two options we looked at. We decided on this option compared to the one down the street because this looked a lot more spacious. I noticed this place was brand new (it had only been open for a few weeks when we went) so I expected them to still be getting into the swing of things (and they were).

We were seated at a table that was clearly too small for the size of our party, as there was no way it could fit all of our food at once. We were eventually moved to a bigger table. It was pretty slow the night we went so there wasn't really any reason to have seated us as such, but I'm assuming it was a lack of experience is all.

For appetizers, we ordered Papa a la Huancaina, Causa de Pollo, and Salchipapas for appetizers. I was against ordering the Salchipapas (hot dogs and fries), but my dad insisted. The Huancaina sauce was great and the Causa was good too.

We ordered a few pitchers of chicha morada (purple corn drink) because you have to be drinking this if you're eating peruvian food. It just seems natural. The drink was tasty, but it hadn't been chilled and we weren't given ice with it. Back in Peru I was used to not having chilled drinks all the time, but it's a different story when I'm back in 'Murica.

For entrees we collectively ordered Lomo Saltado x3, Aji de Gallina x2, and Carapulcra x1. Most of my family had tried lomo before so I think the big hit this time was the Aji de Gallina because the creamy sauce was just delicious. The other dishes were also very good. When I asked for some aji to go with my rice I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out quite the large dipping dish of it. So good!

I give this restaurant a 4/5 because I know a new restaurant will have to work out the kinks and it wasn't much of a hassle for those things that were ""wrong"" anyway. The food was great!",2uXgAglORO1fB05ez0kflA,4,0,4,vFuZGCvuBqsMkrl0iLGyRw

They have lunch specials from 11 am to 2 pm for $8.99 including a glass of chica morada drink which is a great deal.

ATMOSPHERE:
Small Peruvian restaurant located in a shopping center, there's nothing special about the decor, what makes this restaurant fun is the live music. Don't go here if you want a quiet dinner. The music works both in and against the restaurants favor, you'd think that they'd have the setup down to perfection 5by now, it can get quite annoying. But if the music system is working its a very festive atmosphere. 

 FOOD:
Pretty damn delicious. I've had the arroz con marisco (rice with seafood), ceviche, and lomo saltado (beef with fries). Each time I've gone with family and I've also sampled their dishes, all of which taste great. The best thing about El Toque is that there is so much variety in the menu itself and everything I've tried thus far has had great flavor and was cooked just right. Definitely recommend the ceviche if your in the mood for something zesty. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Very friendly and approachable staff, I've always been seated promptly and never have an issue with a request or dish. The reason I'm giving this establishment 3 stars because I do feel some of the dishes are over priced and at times the atmosphere can really be a buzz kill. 

I'd definitely go back to have a bite once awhile just not a staple.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,2,2,3,ZEjCHf-mebbOmE2nhWoICg

Lunch time specials are like eating back home and the rest of the food in the menu covers a wide range of dishes of authentic Peruvian flavor from ceviche to lomo saltado and chupe de camaron to aji de gallina.  Add drinks like chicha morada, maracuya or Inka Kola and helado de lucuma or alfajores for dessert and you get a full experience like you will if you're in Peru.  The restaurant is relatively new and they work hard to provide a good service but I never had any issues with it.  The decoration is nice and warm for a strip mall restaurant and they have weekends with live music (a salsa band that play my favorite songs from Niche) on Friday nights, karaoke on Saturday nights and Peruvian music on Sunday afternoons.",Fukg644eAHO6fLGHQBXoGg,0,0,5,iAt_32GF9J7s3ZC3Ilje_A

The food was bland and not too much flavor. Tee asked for split checks and the sever messed up our receipts and charges the wrong amounts on our card! If I could give it a 0 stars I would!!!,uJ-EwwKIwex-fTWDQXdmCg,0,0,1,SjxjDePwKC3LCSswDz2pZA

My son and I ordered the arroz con mariscos, my and daughter husband ordered lomo saltado, my other son ordered bisté a lo pobre, my other daughter ordered pollo a la brasa con papas fritas and her boyfriend ordered pollo saltado! For dessert we ordered Lucuma ice cream and alfajores. We all loved our food!! Everything was so delish, that the next day I ordered arroz con pollo to go. Then, two days later. I ordered more food to go seco de carne, ají de gallina and ají verde. I highly recommend this restaurant to Peruvians and non Peruvians because the food is superb!!!",2_rX1siwicF8JMfoFIjpMw,0,0,5,7yYgue9cz-ZGZWbeeF2kiA

Slow service and although it was okay, it was not close to original like aji de gallina should have been shredded not chopped chicken letting me know it wasn't cooked in the sauce but added to a sauce. The sauce also did not have that distinct flavor but only reminded me of Mac and cheese.",_M5lzGsBcTsM3mPfmf52Uw,0,0,3,vr4dtoNFjerdusQFa55QAg

Excellent service by a really cute and friendly waitress.  Restrooms were very clean as was the restaurant throughout. Try this little gem for something different and tasty. My only complaint was that my Arroz de Marisco dish could have used more squid and was mostly rice.  Other than that; you must try their ceviches-they are really good!,wQKXTHEjLcm6kg531S1zjA,2,0,4,KED-cHnImm0dun1TKovhFA
