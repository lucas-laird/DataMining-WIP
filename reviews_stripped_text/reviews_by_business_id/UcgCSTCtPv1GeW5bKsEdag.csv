The burgers are great and definitely better than Create. However, that quality does cost. This is why they lost a star. I don't mind paying for good, quality food, but there's other burger places I prefer over Grind (e.g. Bachi Burger, Slidin Thru, Smashburger).

I also got a side of Onion Strings and I'm so glad I got it to share with the rest of my table. Because it was HUGE. It was piled up on a entree sized plate.

It's a good restaurant but my taste buds prefer a Banh Mi Burger over the ones I can find at Grind.",Ar2XtQ7X_oBfbC8LCSnyiA,1,2,3,3T2Z6Tam3X_DtoWfIwhXwQ

124312,2011-08-30,0,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"First a little bit about the location. The restaurant is in a desolate part of town nestled between the airport, the Thomas and Mack Center, and a huge field of dirt behind the MGM Grand. There is an Einstein's and a couple other things in this parking lot, but I don't think I ever would have thought to stop at this strip mall until now. The interior is modern-ish, kind of a more industrial version of Chipotle with exposed brick and mechanical ducts. The bar area in the back seemed fairly cool, with a big funky light fixture draped from the ceiling, bar-top machines and a fairly stocked liquor selection. The restaurant is entirely hard surfaces; I imagine it gets pretty loud in there when it's packed. Which it wasn't when I was there...

As for the 2 for 1 offer, I brought a coupon of my own even though I was going to eat alone. I figured that instead of looking like a pig I could eat one burger at the restaurant, and then get a totally different one to go and sample it back at my office. There were absolutely no expiration dates, rules or stipulations on this coupon, it just stated 'buy one get one free' and had a little blurb about their happy hour. So I was quite surprised when the waitress told me that it wasn't valid for takeout, and didn't hide my reaction. Instead of arguing she took the coupon and went into the kitchen to speak to someone about it. After a few minutes she came back out and told me they would grant my request even though normally this wasn't allowed. Apparently it was her manager's last day and this lady 'didn't care.' Lucky for me, because I do.

Now to the food. The menu is set up as a do-it-yourself burger; there are absolutely no pre-designed burgers to choose from. While I love the freedom, you are probably starting to notice that I hate the laziness of all burger joints by not giving the customer a few creative items of their own. Also for a 'burger bar', there are a lot of odd choices on the menu like Thai calamari, edamame and pizza. But I guess not everyone that goes into a place called Grind Burger Bar wants to eat a burger. The burger choices are fairly standard, amount of meat, how you want it cooked, cheeses, toppings... not much in the way of bun selection, just regular, whole wheat or lettuce. They offer quite a few sauces, and I had a hard time selecting just one. I did have my second burger which I was taking with me so it made my choice a bit easier.

For my first burger I went with lettuce, tomato, marinated mushrooms and the chipotle ketchup. I chose 'rare', but wasn't quite expecting what actually came out, a burger that was grilled just right on the outside, but completely raw in the middle! To some this might be gross, but I was very excited by this. The meat had good flavor, and there was actually a bit more meat than bun which I always like. The regular bun was good, but the flavor of it was so strong compared to the slight lack in flavor of the meat and toppings that it almost took over the flavor of the entire meal. The lettuce was shredded, which I think is useless on anything but a taco. Still overall the burger was quite good. Another rarity for me was ordering the fat fries instead of skinny, which had great flavor to them as well surprisingly. The chipotle ketchup had great flavor, and a nice bite to it. I used it on my burger as well as for all my fries.

The second burger that I got to go was a similar setup so I could compare apples to apples, or burgers to burgers in this case, but went with the cayenne pepper ranch dressing per a recommendation from my waitress as their best sauce. By the time I got back to my office, settled in and had any sort of motivation to take a bite out of it was a little while later, but it still had great flavor and I actually liked the bun a bit more now that it was slightly soggy. The sauce was very disappointing, but I wasn't upset because the burger still tasted good. And before you judge me any further, I literally had only two bites of this one about an hour after that first one, and never went back to it. I'm on a diet after all.

And now for my obligatory negativity to the article: the price. Ignoring my second burger because it was free, $16.70 is far too much for a sit down, but fairly casual burger joint meal. The burger was $8.95 which isn't bad for the quality of the meat and everything, but another $4(!!!) for fries, and $2 for an iced tea push this to the point of being a bit too overpriced. I suppose if you're eating with a friend and using the abundant 2 for 1 coupon it's suddenly not so bad, but for the average person that might not know these offers exist, this ends up being about double of what I would expect it to cost. Hence the coupon.

I definitely wouldn't write this place off. If you can get past the odd location and find yourself a coupon I would absolutely recommend it.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,mPb0UDEn5CE2KyupoL9xHQ

218312,2010-10-06,0,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"2-1 burgers right now if you mention yelp.  That was enough to get me in the door.

Speaking of the door...  We entered by the restaurant door and no one was around.  I wasn't sure if it was even open, the dining room was empty. We went around to the bar entrance and asked if we could get to the restaurant from there. We were given somewhat of a yes...wandered back and still, no one was around. Eventually some one came out and seated us.

I thoughtfully placed my order by filling out their scantron-esque menu, $9 to build your own basic burger and $.79-$1.50 for extras or premium toppings. If you want fries or an appetizer and a drink with your burger, you can expect to spend about $20-$25 per person without the yelp discount.  

I had a meatless burger on wheat with marinated mushrooms and peppers, crispy fried onions, bbq sauce and roasted garlic mayo (if it had been roasted garlic veganaise or if i knew if the entire burger was vegan, it may have brought this up to 5 stars). When they brought it out, I was pleasantly surprised. 

This combination may be of the best veggie burgers I've had outside of my own kitchen.

The regular fries aren't worth getting again, but i will go back just for the sweet potato fries. 

My friend had a new castle and it came in a can, has anyone ever gotten beer in a can at a restaurant? Also, the bartender was skipping or dancing or something through the dining area to get to the kitchen for no apparent reason, which i found odd and distracting. The staff was nice and fairly attentive. 

They have very nice napkins, sharp pencils and our check came on a mini clipboard...these small details made me a fan.",013oZ9i6NUQ_Rh6139QjsA,1,2,4,Y0hmG0B7uu5DXgN3FRd1Xw

I have been here a few times, courtesy of a couple of Groupons ;) I really like this place. The decor is pretty cool & the vibe isn't too bad. I just wish I lived closer, because I would definitely come here more often.

The burgers are very good & you get quite a few choices of accoutrements to go on your burger. I like the ordering setup they have. I appreciate being able to go down a list & check off all of the things I would like on my burger, as well as side items. I have ordered the the turkey burger both times I've been here. However, I have tasted the beef burgers, courtesy of the people I have come with. Not bad.

Sadly, I had a WTF! moment the last time I was here. I ordered an egg over easy on my burger & the very first bite I took, somehow, someway, due to forces beyond my control & reasoning beyond my comprehension, the hot, molten egg yolk burst & magically shot into my eye. I immediately realized how a Porn Star must feel. I literally & figuratively had egg on my face. Lol, nevertheless it did make for a good story & a few laughs.

The adult's only milkshakes here are pretty good. I have had the After Dinner Mint & The Nutty Professor. Yum! The service here is also very good & they are friendly & very attentive.

My only beef I have with this place (pun intended) is that they use shredded lettuce on their burgers. And for that reason, I always opt for no lettuce. Makes an already messy burger even messier. I agree with Nikki H. about Grind being a little pricey. But, I guess the location dictates that.

The sweet potato fries were very interesting. They are served w/ honey mustard sauce, which sounds strange, but complimented the fries very well.

We ordered drinks and my husband got the house special the ""Juicy Lucy"" and I got chicken tenders. 

The chicken tenders weren't crispy but they were yummy and the ranch sauce was a perfect complement

The Juicy Lucy is a huge burger, the Patti is stuffed with cheese and truly is juicy and delicious,they give you so many options to customize your burger and they all sounded great, it makes choosing your toppings hard lol.

I loved the decor, the interesting light fixture over the bar and the pub like styling, and the individual menu cards for ordering were interesting and fun.

Over-all this is a great relaxed place to grab a bite and chill away from the strip, it isn't as crowded or rushed as many of the places on the strip.

587631,2013-11-16,0,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"I went for lunch on a weekday and arrived as they were opening so it wasn't busy which was nice. I decided to sit at the bar instead of making the bartender walk around and serve me at a table.  In retrospect the bartender was relatively cold and indifferent so I wish I had chosen the more comfortable seating arrangement for myself.

The menu was different than anything I've experienced as you fill in circles next to the foods you want (think SAT test style).  It took me a while to go over the whole menu and decide what I was going to get.  I eventually decided on a rare burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, swiss cheese, garlic infused mayo, and dijon mustard on a wheat bun.

The burger came in a timely manner and looked great.  I was, however, disappointed with the array of toppings.  There was a plethora of onion (I love onion, but it was a bit much) and lots of shredded lettuce (really, shredded?) while only a meager slice of tomato and less bacon than I've ever received on a bacon burger.

The garlic mayo was delicious and the meat on the burger was excellent.  The burger itself was difficult to eat.  It just kept falling apart and I had a huge mess on my hands.

I was disappointed in the barely there selection of draft beers.  I had been interested in trying the fries but chose not to since they were a la carte and too much of an addition to my already large and expensive meal.

Which brings me to my main point.  The burger itself was satisfactory, but the price was not!  I ended up spending $17 on just a burger and $20 after tip.  That is ridiculous, it just wasn't that good.  The ambiance, service, lack of beer selection and cheap menu style all lead you to believe you are in johnny rockets. I will never go back.

Side note: I guess I could be spoiled as Charlotte (where I'm from) has a great selection of quality modern burger places with fantastic local beer choices where you can eat and drink like a king for half the price (and better service).

This is a really clean eating area that is lit during the day with bright sunlight from the huge windowed area. There is also a bar separated by a glass wall.

There are low regular tables and some bar type high stools. Everyone can see the TV's all around that are usually carrying some sports game or show. The atmosphere is quite friendly. The Staff is super friendly, knowledgeable, and just plain good people.

When you get seated you are given a clipboard with the menu and a pencil. There so many combinations of things to check off your head will spin. 

To me the 7oz. Burgers are the best. Pick what kind of roll you want and then just start stacking stuff on it until it looks like something only Dagwood could get his mouth around. If you like onions raw, grill, or otherwise try the Marinated Onions on your burger. I've never had quite this flavor before. Fries in different sizes plus sweet potato fries. I like skinny fries. There are enough to share with your partner. Get the Chipolte Catsup it has a nice ""zip"" to it. There is regular Catsup and Mustard on each table so, if you are not a sauce person the regular American ""normal"" stuff is there for you.

The price isn't bad especially if you have a coupon. YELP has one for here 2 for 1. Just print it out and take it along,

BTW: Water, Soda, Beer, and Wine are nice and cold. Mixed drinks are available too.

We like it and keep going back. Best Time= late afternoon.

The menu is ""build your own"" burger, with offerings from the standard, lettuce, onion, tomato, to selections of gourmet mayonnaise, onion strings, fried eggs and more. They also have a pizza menu, chopped salads and appetizers. beverages include a full bar and ""adult milkshakes"" with your favorite booze whizzed in. Mmmm!

I ordered their signature burger the ""Juicy Lucy'--an 8oz patty stuffed AND topped with the cheese of your choice. I went pretty standard with my toppings:  Bacon, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and 1000 Island. It was HUGE and delicious. I finished what I could and have a healthy portion leftover in my fridge. 

My partner had a 7oz burger with onion strings, bacon, cheddar, and blue cheese. It was equally impressive, although he was able to finish his. Champ! They do offer a 4oz burger for the lighter eaters. 

We shared an order of steak fries that were PERFECTLY crisp on the outside and tender potato-squishy on the inside. Although we are ketchup dippers, we were automatically offered ranch for our fries. That's always nice.

We ate in the bar area. As our hostess pointed out, the stools in there have comfy cushioning for your toosh. She was correct. The bar was less busy than the dining area at 12pm. It offers video poker, big screens for the sports fans, and smoking.  Our server, Nicole, was sweet, but not ""goopy."" I dislike the script-reading chirpers that assault you with the their fake toothy smiles. Nicole was genuinely pleasant.

Especially since they had the ""juicy lucy"" on their menu and after watching plenty of food network, I just had to try it. For those who don't know, a juicy lucy is a burger with ooey gooey cheese that oozes out of the middle of the burger patty.

The one good thing about Grind burger is you can completely build your burger to your liking. With all the choices from the buns, to the way your patty is cooked, to the numerous toppings you can choose from (roasted garlic mayo, chipotle mayo, different cheeses, green chiles, etc.), I really thought I'd like this place, but unfortunately, it was a big no-no!

Here's my biggest gripe, it was so greasy! When I say greasy, I mean it was as if they dipped my entire burger in oil and put it on the plate before they brought it out. The bun was shiny and oily, the cheese in the burger oozed out for the first bite and then solidified and this greasy cheese oil kept dripping out and covered all the veggies and the plate. It was just a mess. The worst part is with all that grease, there wasn't even any flavor to the burger itself. I think I took about 3 bites and I was done. Took it to go because we felt bad, but we ended up just throwing it away later.

1099077,2012-01-23,2,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"Fair warning: this is STAUNCHLY a UNLV Rebels place. DO NOT go in there wearing any other college. You will get maddogged. Fortunately I had a sweatshirt to throw on over my UCSB shirt (go Gauchos!).

So I've driven by this place a lot, and along with Elite Emily and Hec went to try it out last night. I was well pleased, I must admit. The 45-minute wait I was threatened with was a bit daunting, but we actually got seated much closer to 15 minutes. I like how it's almost all build-your-own style... they have some pizzas and salads, but the crux of the restaurant comes from building your own ground beef temple of amazing. I went with a 7 oz medium patty on wheat buns with lettuce, tomato, and barbecue sauce. Simple, yet tasty, although the meat was looking a little more pink than I might have liked. Elite Emily and Hec went for the Juicy Lucy, Grind Burger's signature. It's a meat patty stuffed with cheese. It's like a jelly donut, except made of meat and cheese. They seemed to like it.

Health-conscious people will enjoy the fact that there's turkey and veggie patties and whole wheat buns or bunless. Health-unconscious people will enjoy the fact that they have regular and spiked milkshakes.

I guess the only real dislike I have of this place is its location. It's at the Bluegreen resort, off of Tropicana by the airport. It seems to me like this area of Tropicana between the Strip and UNLV was in line to be a bustling area, touristy enough to be appealing to tourists, but non-Strip enough to make the locals deal with it. Well, that idea must have fallen through, because it's the ONLY thing in between UNLV and the strip. Which means if you're going eastbound on Tropicana, and you're like, ""Oooh, Grind Burger, let's check that place out,"" Grind Burger says, ""HAHA! You have been THWARTED!! You drive on down until you're allowed to make a legal U-turn, then maybe, JUST MAYBE, I can let you feast on my meaty, beefy goodness!"" And when you're leaving, you are forced to go westbound on Tropicana. Wanna go east? Tough titties! You're going west, and you'll like it!

I feel like 3.5 start would be most appropriate here, but in lieu of that, I'll favor the food the extra half-star.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,2,1,4,9jGU_ByHv1wtqkGQ_ZOJgA

The interior is really neat.  They have some cool lamp bulbs, lol.

My parents and I were looking for a new burger place and discovered this on yelp.

We started off with their strawberry shakes.  Delicious!! My mom and I wanted to split one.  They put it in two glasses without even asking, which was nice of them.

You are given a piece of paper where you create your own burger by checking which toppings you want.  You get 4 of the basic toppings for free, then each extra is 75 cents.  The good stuff like the eggs, avocoado, bacon, etc are $1.50 per item.  I got a 4 oz bacon, egg, and cheddar cheese burger.  (It sucks that the 4 oz's were only available well-done, but I guess it's because the patty is so small).  On the side I got grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers, and a sundried tomato mayo.  My parents created their own 7 oz burgers and we got one pair of long and thin fries.  It was more than enough.

My burger was average.  I mean, I can tell that the ingredients were fresh, but I didn't find the meat to be anything special... The fries weren't that great either.  The sundried tomato mayo was delicious though.  We used it as the dipping sauce for our fries.

And to be honest, none of us felt that great after eating here.  All of our stomachs hurt a bit.  Not that super sick feeling, but that uncomfortable stomach ache.

Service was nice & friendly.

The host asked us if we wanted to sit at a table or at the bar. I wanted a pint, so I opted for the bar. I asked the bartender what they had on tap. His reply was, ""nothing."" Ok...fine no tap...so I ask for a Stella. Bartender says, ""we don't have that...we only have cans."" Wtf?!! What bar only serves beer in cans? I settled for an Amstel Light. Later I noticed on the bill that each can of Amstel Light was $5. I had 2 cans. A can of Amstel Light should not be $5. I should've just had a milkshake.

What I ordered:

-Premium Fresh Ground Chuck, Hand Pressed $9.00
-Regular Bun
-Pepper Jack Cheese $0.75
-Toppings (2 included) $0.75 each:
  Lettuce
  Tomatoes 
  Marinated Mushrooms
-Sauce (2 included) $0.75 each:
  Roasted Garlic Mayo

I asked the bartender if I could pick 3 toppings since I only wanted 1 sauce. He replied in a rude tone, ""that's not how it works!"" 

I don't understand why he couldn't give me the 3rd topping for free. I only picked 1 sauce and extra toppings are the same price as extra sauces. 

The burger tasted ok for a $10.50 burger. The bill for the 2 of us was $46.48. If I'm spending this much at a burger place...I should at least be getting my beer in a bottle.

We all ordered a bunch of different things off the menu, starting with the Thai Calamari.  Not only is the calamari amazing, they also have dried grilled lemon slices.  AWESOME.  The salad (kinda like tasty coleslaw - but not the gross KFC/picnic kind) underneath the calamari went so well with it... mmm!

We also ate a bunch of different burgers, from the 4oz burger (which is definitely enough for small-stomach eaters), to the 7oz, as well as the Juicy Lucy - which you should get.  NOTE: They even can cut the burger in half for you if you're splitting, AND ask nicely.  The Juicy Lucy is a fattty burger patty which has the cheese within the patty itself.  It, along with the other burgers, are completely customizable.  Not too shabby (:  The burgers are piled high, so take care in making sure you don't make a mess.  Their patties are juicy, the ingredients/veggies,etc. are fresh... what more could you ask for?

I've tried their steak fries (fat and thick) and their sweet potato fries (sweet and neat) and wow.  Order their Sweet & Neats. Worth it.  They're clean, not oily, and just taste fresh!  Another thing to try is their special drink - The Juicy Lucy.  It's a bit on the sweeter side, so if you don't like that... maybe just grab a beer.

there were 3 of us,  service was not so good,  although it is the first week,  the menu is so confusing, that the server had to spend 5 minutes walking us through how to order and what some of the items were.  
we started with onion straws and calamari,   both were terrible.  onion string were very greasy,  flour dredge had no seasoning,  the calamari was a cheap frozen product as it was super chewy and again no flavor.  they tossed the calamari in some sweeit thai chili sauce,  bad move  made it soggy and even worse then it already was.
the burger catergory is nuts!!  not in a good way,  you choose everything you want on it,  but you only get 2 toppings included???  so if i wanted lettuce, tomato and onion you would have to pay for the 1 addition items,  so the cost builds up quickly.
the sauces are interesting they offer,  all are served on the side.  got the avajar and garlic mayo's,  neither had any salt or vinegar to make them taste good,  rather bland and un-inspiring.  nice idea poor execution.  so after filling out the card and handing it to the server,  we were asked if we wanted fries??  so the 14 burger i just built with only a few toppings doesnt even come with fries????   so we ordered one of each fry to see what it was about,  sweet potatoes, steak cut and shoestring,  but it couldnt be that easy,  the menu had code names that no guest would know,  again the server had to explain.
so out comes the food!!!  fries,  all cheap frozen products,  for 4 and 5 bucks you gotta be kidding me,  they werent even large portions!!
the ciabatta bread, again appeared to be a frozen product,  not that that frozen is always bad, but again poor execution,  it wasnt even warmed up or toasted,  was cold and dry....blahhhhhh
cheddar cheese was crappy, and not even melted,  lettuce was shredded and barely any on the burger,  tomato was thinly sliced, again almost non-existent.  they label the menu having nueske bacon,  not a chance!!!!  this was a super thin and over cooked run of the mill smoked bacon,  definetly not nueske!!!!!    now they dont even take a cook temperature for your burger, they all come out near welldone??? i want my burger RARE!!!!!!!!!!  especially if it quality meat,  but i guess its not here....the patty appeared to be hand formed,  not seasoned at all and unfortunetly overcooked,  as were everyones at the table.

so in summation....bad apps, run o the mill cheap frozen fries, noone knows how to use salt and pepper, confusing menu, uncomfortable chairs and its not cheap!!!  out tab was 75 bucks,  ok we had more then the normal group would  (we sure didnt eat it all,  wasnt worth eating)  i would say for a burger fries and soda and splitting an app  would run 25 bucks.  NO THANKS

decor...lot of the things look real similar to another burger joint in town,  but nowhere as nice.

We got a chance to hit this place up.  It was about a 10 minute walk from the MGM where we were staying.  We happened to go around lunch hour on a Monday.  Our waitress was very nice and very attentive.  The burgers were super fresh.  Honestly was not too far off from some of my favorite burgers of all time. There was a good array of options to choose from.  Some were a little pricy.  I'm a bacon guy, but I even stayed away from paying an extra $1.50 for bacon.  I did get onion strings on my burger.  The amount that they put on my burger was so many, that I took 75% of them off and ate them with my fries later (I say this in a good way), so I got good value for adding that on my burger.  I didn't have a ""jucy lucy"" style burger, only because I've had the real deal in Minnesota, so I didn't want to taint my experience although I am sure it probably would have been good.

It is a bit pricey though for what I would want to pay for the meal.  We had a groupon so it was quite worth it.  I know everything in vegas is pricey, so it terms of comparing it to other pricing in vegas it was fine.  Just a few dollars more than I like to pay for a burger for my wife and I.

The location is relatively easy to get to and parking is good.  Inside is much smaller than it looks though and the tables are parked real close together so I was glad we came at an off time and could spread out a little.  It's got an industrial feel, but it fits and I liked it.  Hostess and waitress were both awesome - lots of smiles and weren't over-attentive.

Calamari - Enough for the 4 of us to share and the Thai dressing was A-mazing!!  Came with both rings and tentacles, which was fine with me but turned one friend off a bit.  It's personal choice - I'll eat anything.

Burgers all the way around - guys had Juicy Lucy's and us girls had regular 4 oz burgers.  Cooked perfectly and the meat was well seasoned - not OVER seasoned.  Generous toppings and the cheese was nicely melted.  The buns were delish - I saw reviews that they were greasy, but I felt they were lightly buttered not overly greasy.  These burgers are messy - but that's just the way a good burger should be!

We ordered one each of the ""short and thick"" and ""tall and thin"" fries - definitely recommend the short and thick, they were much better and tasted freshly cut.  And with the burgers, I think one order would have been plenty for all 4 of us!

The sauces were excellent - my favorites were the chipotle ketchup (will definitely order extra next time), and the roasted garlic mayo.  

The hubs and I shared a vanilla milkshake (well, I use ""share"" loosely but I did get a taste or two).  It really was nothing special, but a shake just completes a good burger and since we had a groupon, I didn't worry about the ridiculous price tag of the shake.

Burgers- you make your own.  They give you a clip board with all your choices and you mark what burger with what toppings.

My husband had a burger with blue cheese and onion strings (we ordered our app, after we placed our burger order and I didn't know my husband got onion strings on his burger!)

I got the meatless burger, which is made out of chickpeas and seasonings, with lettuce, tomato, sauteed mushrooms.

We ordered a side of fries (which is DEFINITELY enough to share!) 

We both liked everything.  (although for a blue cheese burger, he said that he would go back to Stripburger, since that was their speciality!)

First, you're the boss. The menu is extensive and varied. You can have pretty much anything you want on your burger AND LOVE IT. 

I had a medium rare burger, 7 oz., with tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, ketchup, bacon (mmmmm..tasty bacon - RECOMMEND) and avocado! It was so good I almost ran and got my sleeping bag and set up homestead right IN that place. We also got the french fried onions. Taste meltdown. Have them, you will not be disappointed.

Also, Diet Coke. Did not get left empty at all, not once. The service was pretty, pretty good. Aside from asking for napkins and not getting them AND the place being ice box cold, I'm just planning my next trip there. I'll bring my own napkins and just wear a coat next time!

My friend and I decided to check this place out since it was advertised at UNLV.  Once inside, my friend and I were impressed by how many TV's they had.  Great place to catch a game.  Our host seated us quick since it was lunch and the crowd wasn't so bad.  Our server was very friendly, gave us tips and preferences (The Lucy).  I read about it before I came in and was already committed on getting it.

Ordering was pretty simple, but takes quite long since it was our first time here. We had hard time figuring out what the sauces were.  Place reminds me of another place that also lets us choose what was going to be on our burger (Just less additional options).  I ended up with the lucy on wheat with pepper jack, grilled onions and mushrooms with a side buffalo style hot sauce and cayenne pepper ranch sauce.  To top it off, I added the egg (over medium).  When it came out, wOw.  The patty looked impressive because of the cheese being inside of it.  Fair warning, cheese maybe hot inside.  First bite, ouch.  My burger was quite messy given the over easy egg.  i ended up pouring the sauces over the dripped yolk on my plate and just smiring my burger all over before each bite.  I like the taste of the sauce, spicy with ranch.  There was another gentlemen supporting our server.  He made sure that our drinks were always refilled constantly.  We also got wedges on the side, nothing too spectacular so you should give the swt potatoes a try instead.  

Side note: my server was extra nice, she offered my drink in a togo cup since was signing check when I asked for a refill.  I believe that the manager on staff also came around to ask how our meal was. Parking is extra spacious and a plenty.",yobIvoK2taIhooUPSrjuiQ,2,2,5,UGAQv1roJy21bmpXAqemjQ

Of course when you come to Grind Burger Bar and Lounge you have to try their burgers at least once.  The Juicy Lucy a 1/2 lbs burger patty stuffed with cheese and your choice of 4 toppings a sauces all for over $10. You can add more toppings for extra.

Last time I went with the Juicy Lucy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grind-burger-bar-and-lounge-las-vegas?select=Vh6NkmWgRwz4c5y5zaDKYw#Vh6NkmWgRwz4c5y5zaDKYw took advantage of their various selection of sauces and dressings you can throw on the burger and I have to add a fried egg. It was a good tasting burger but it was just very soggy. When I picked it up and was ready to bite into it the bottom bun just opened up and nearly spilled everything out.  I ended up eating the burger in sections.  There weren't a lot of people there at the time so I didn't really mind diving in making a mess but it was a little annoying.  Who ever made my burger could've shaken off some of the liquid of the lettuce, they could've made sure my buns wasn't going to be soggy maybe toasted it, I don't know.

They make milkshakes, pizzas, and apps. A OK menu and OK prices for being close to the strip.

The person that came with me ordered the same burger and also said that it lacked enough flavor to justify it's cost. He even mentioned of visiting a fast food company afterwards.

The burgers were juicy, but when it comes to flavor and because of the higher cost, I would suggest finding another location to get one. Minus two stars for lack of flavor and one star off for the server not checking to see how my meal was going.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,1,1,2,X8jokrIz-QdpHjDyOTrjAg

The menu had lots of delicious choices. My only complaint is the number of appealing toppings and sauces made it difficult to choose. I ended up ordering a 4 oz. burger with green chiles, marinated mushrooms and onions, salsa cruda, and provolone on a toasted bun.

For some people, the above statement sends chills down their spine. For me, it puts a smile on my face. Not to say I like my meat still moving, but given the right cut of meat, there's nothing better than a mid-rare grill. 

Grind Burger Bar is a one trick pony, but that pony is a friggin stallion. They do burgers, and they do them well. From the bun quality (amazing) to the meat, to the special ""extras"" available, they know how to put together a spectacular burger. The onion straws & avocado are two favorites of mine to add. They give you enough onion straws for 2 or 3 burgers (hint hint, you don't need to order a side of onion straws - your welcome). I generally don't order the fries because the burger is 'uge. But I've had the fries, definitely good, but I'm not a french fry connoisseur to be honest. So if you're ever in the area, give Grind Burger a try. Good burger, good service, good atmosphere. 

You can almost always find a coupon or groupon for Grind Burger, which makes the value that much better. I'd pay full price, but as they say at Payless, why pay more when you can pay less?",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,2,3,5,J2e5PRA0BbcDpcPy0ZbaVw

You get to choose your toppings - two toppings and two sauces included for the $9.  I chose the burger without the bun and they provided plenty of lettuce under the lovely burger.  All cooked medium well, unless you specify.  Good thing I had an extra sauce (the spicy ranch) as I put in on the lettuce and pretended I had a salad with my burger!  

For me, I could live on sauces to dip my food into.  The food is a means to the sauce!  I chose the chipotle ketchup and garlic mayo - yummy!!  Sauce heaven!!  I cut my burger (oh so sophisticated, eh?) and dipped into the sauces.  Great tasting burger - no salt or pepper needed.

Also, had the sweet potato fries - that is, what was left after the bf dug into them.  Served with an almost-honey-mustard - very nice!

But the bartender was rather pleasant and I did walk away with 40 bucks from black jack, and the bartender also gave me free ""The Jucy Lucy"" postcards :)

To sum it all up, The Grinde is definitely worth checking out. The outdoor seating looked kindda nice, but they had this song blasting from the speakers up top, so not sure about that.

I felt like I was back in college with my scantron right in front with me. I say that because of the way you place your order. You have to bubble in your orders and then hand your menu/order to your waiter. 

In my opinion, the burgers are overpriced and so are the condiments. I probably could have gone to McDonald's and gotten more for my money, but then again, I wanted to give this place a shot. Especially since my cousin was raving about the place. 

I may give the place another shot, but due to the overpriced food, I may end up just starving myself and hitting up a buffet instead.",3zFuRgirTo1HVCMFbACl9w,2,0,3,vogOsDzXdr85-mlmsKOfAA

It was packed with people watching games and they offer quite a few specials when UNLV is playing. It's a lot smaller inside than it appears and can get really busy. That's my biggest complaint for this spot. It got friggin LOUD in there, to the point where we felt like we were screaming at each other to talk. 

This was my first Juicy Lucy burger experience and dang it was good! There's a good amount of toppings to pick from...I got lettuce, bacon, grilled onions and green chiles. The patty itself was delicious, great seasoning and really juicy. It was a tad overcooked for me but didn't take away from the flavor at all. If you love cheese like I do, you won't be disappointed with the Juicy Lucy. The cheese inside the patty just oozes out and it's hot, gooey and delicious! I really liked their buns too. They have a slight crisp on the bottom then super soft on the top. 

They also have a bunch of sauces that you can choose which they bring on the side and I love that. I hate when places douse a burger with condiments. Best part is there's plenty to dip your fries in too. The fries were alright and they have a decent edamame appetizer but both were a little expensive. All in all this is a solid burger joint!

Between the four in my party we had a nice selection including a 1/2 pound burger with marinated onions and grilled peppers on a wheat bun with cayenne pepper ranch...so delicious and it blows ""The Counter"" out of the water for those familiar. They don't over do the toppings and the meat is very moist. 

Next is a turkey buger with jalepenos, bacon and chipotle ketchup. My buddy said it was the best turkey burger he ever had. 

Next up my wife ordered the ""bump and grind"" chicken sandwich. It came with olive tapenade which she thought was really yummy. It also came with ""hot cappy"" which was very flavorful as well.

Firstly, the ambiance is ok, very modern, lots of metallic and dark colors.  There's only one bathroom per gender, and the door is frosted glass, which is a little unnerving for me.  

You receive a paper menu and you ""build-your-own-burger"" or select one of their specialty items like the Juicy Lucy, which according to my friend, was fantastic.

I got a meatless, bunless burger, with mushrooms, asparagus (special topping, costs more), provolone, onions, and the vinaigrette dressing.  So I guess I essentially got a salad LOL.  The meatless burger was hands-down the best veggie burger I've ever had.  Don't know what was in it, but it was dense, and full of flavor.

The onion strings were pretty good, except they're super greasy.  My fingers were soaked with oil after every bite :-/  The fries were not so greasy, and just as delicious.

Overall, not a bad place to go as a vegetarian :)",Xk-xfZ0MPKynaA2XRQ1_GA,0,0,4,OmSn17udJ3fDIVazDkEKYg

Once you get inside, the place is cute. I like the setup, of course we opted to sit at a table in the bar. We felt bad when we realized the bartender had to come out to serve us, rather than a waitress.  But even though the bar was quite busy she was very attentive. 

First I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was very good.  Garnished with lime and olives (olives were the small regular green olives) 
My friend ordered a kettle and soda, both drinks were $7.50 each

I ordered a regular 7oz burger with avocado. The burger was great, good quality The avocado was a little ripe. It wasn't terrible just a little harder than I like. I think a perfect side of avocado will mush down a little if you push a fork into it. This was not the case. I also ordered a side of honey mustard  and buffalo sauce and both were pretty good
.
My friend got the Juicy Lucy. He loved the burger but probably wouldn't order Juicy Lucy style next time. You don't really get cheese in every bite... More like some bites have a ton of cheese and others have no cheese. Also a fair amount of cheese came out of the side and although it was tasty to eat, I think it would have been better on the burger. It seems like a waste to order it this way. Maybe trying the Juicy Lucy with an additional slice of cheese on top. 

Pro Tip: I would definitely recommend ordering onion strings on one of the burgers. There was more than enough for both of us to share.
We opted for the short and thick fries and they were also pretty good.

The first time we opted for the standard burgers and shared a side of the chicken tenders, which at happy hour prices, were fairly priced. This place is, like some of the others have pointed out, a one trick pony. They are for all intents and purposes, a burger joint. Obviously. It's in the name. 

The model for serving burgers here is a little different. They do sliders, regulars, and ""juicy lucy's"" if you're feeling adventurous. Unlike some of the high end burger restaurants in town, these guys do not have pre-determined burger recipes. They leave most of the customization up to, well, the customer. Depending on your eating habits, this may be a good or a bad thing.

The burger they make isn't half bad. I went with the chipotle ketchup as the sauce of choice. They cooked 'em just right, and they did come out very juicy. The chicken tenders are just the right amount of greasy and the dipping sauce is pretty tasty too. On another occasion, we had their sliders and onion fries. It's undeniably good food, and I had no problem finishing the burger because it was a pretty solid burger after all. At the end of the day however, all I can say is that they make a solid burger. I don't think their menu style really brings anything substantial to the table.

First time I experience a good burger was Burger Bar.  However, after trying this burger at Grind Burger, It was comparable, if not, of even greater quality.

The sauce that blew me away was the Ajvar.  So creamy and unforgettable.    If you like burgers, you should definitely try.  

I was so full after 3/4 of my burger that I had to skip out on the dessert that my friend was trying to describe to me.  I will definitely come back real soon and share a burger with someone so that I can try out the creative 'burger' dessert!

The Juicy Lucy is two Burger patties cooked together with the Cheese in the middle between the patties.  I've seen Burgers like this on the Food Network and was anxious to give this a try.

The Burger was good, but not great....I thought the toppings and Bun were the highlight of the Burger....the Meat was OK, but wasn't great.....I don't know, it was missing ""something"".  The BBQ Sauce was excellent and added some much needed flavor to the Burger.  I liked the Marinated Onions....would like to know how they are prepared.

The Fries were very good and it's enough to serve 2 people.

Mom enjoyed her Turkey Burger, but said she's not sure it was worth $8.  I would agree with her....for the price of our Burgers, I was hoping they would be mind-blowing.....they were good, but not great.  I will probably come back and give it another shot.....maybe I picked the wrong combo of toppings.

You order the burger from the bottom up any way you like with 20 different sauces. I got a Bleu cheese style that was equal to or better than a  Stripburger but not quite as expensive, indoors and better flavors due to different sauces. My wife loved the turkey burger also. 
We got a pizza to go that is made with the same ingredients of the old Due's that is now closed next door sans the brick oven. Little longer to make but the great taste is still there.

This place is a lot like The Counter (in bay area CA). You make your own burgers. Different from the Counter, you can specify how you want the patty cooked. Overall, my burger was ok. It was very huge though and I had a hard time putting it in my mouth (that's what she said). Lots of mushrooms! The sweet potato fries are served with honey mustard and they're great.

You know it's pricey on the strip and they don't have many ""healthy"", non-artery clogging/normal portion fare out there. It's hard out here for a pimp, er, vegetarian, so I wanted the bf to have some options too. It's nice that there is something on the menu for everyone. Customization - the wave of the future.

Great place, great find - next time we'll take a car though. I thought it was walkable, and it sort of was from the MGM, but i would not want to make that trek in 100 degree heat. We earned our belly busting burgers that day walking to and fro.

I ordered a turkey burger without the bun, bed of lettuce and sauteed mushrooms, avocado and onions with jack cheese. SO good. Just enough spice, flavor, toppings and not overwhelming and heavy. He had the veggie burger adorned with a million sides, including the black beans. I was jealous. We shared a small fries and the dipping sauces were great. Addicting...

I love that I ordered a beer AND a diet coke AND a water. I needed to hydrate and no one looked at me funny. Fun atmosphere, near UNLV and wonderfully sweet staff. I love playing a role in building my own food sometimes, so I can choose what I put into my body. I may have drank myself into a stupor in Vegas, but that doesn't mean I have to bust a gut too.

4053634,2013-01-29,4,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"Awkward. Everything about our dinner here was awkward. 

We were not drinking so we decided to sit in the restaurant area... We were the only people seated there at the time. The table we were put at at was awkward, with a pole in the middle of it that seemed to make it difficult for staff to serve and clear plates. The chairs were uncomfortable. 

Ordering was awkward. The menu is a sheet of paper you mark your order on. Our waitress thought my husband only wanted an appetizer,  despite the fact that his standardized-test type ordering form was clearly completed to indicate he wanted a burger with specific toppings. Prices were high too, over $10 for a burger that didn't come with fries ($4 if you want to add a side of fries)... $10 for 3 smaller-than-typical sliders. 

Speaking of our waitress, not only was she rather poor at reading the ordering form but she also lacked in the personality department. Her entire vibe was a buzz kill. 

Most of this would be forgiven if the food was good... We started with fried mozzarella, served with the blandest marinara ever.  My husband had the Juicy Lucy which comes stuffed with cheese. I had the sliders which came with cheese and a side of thousand island dressing (pickles would have been nice). I found the meat under seasoned and overcooked. My husband didn't complain about his burger but he did have a ton of toppings added... 

Even the bathroom was awkward... There is no separation between the toilet and sink and a rather gross, messy floor. 

It took ages to get our check, we had to ask the busser to find our waitress to finally get the hell out of there...  There are a lot of places to overpay for a burger and fries on the Strip, which means there is no reason for me to ever come back here.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,9,1,2,z4T6c_qhKNnkOlgTYOWWhw

My friend wanted to go here one afternoon, so she, my BF and I ended up here around 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  Naturally, it wasn't very crowded, as it was too late for lunch and too early for dinner.  I really like the decor of the place, very plain, an almost industrial feel  to the place.  Our burgers were good, not the best burger I've ever had, but good.  The fries were good also.  We tried both the sweet potato and regular fries.

My very big issue is the price.  They nickel and dime you on everything.  Every topping you add is 75 cents and that is ridiculous to me.  For the three of us with a couple of drinks, our check was over $90 before tip.  Dang!

So...my hubby and I recently saw a repeat of How I Met Your Mother where they were on the search to find the best burger ever. Well, a week later I was still thinking about the show and more so about getting an amazing burger. This led us to trying Grind. And well, no disappointments here! Totally satisfied my burger craving! 

I had a 7 oz medium ( had to go for it!) on whole wheat with the basic toppings plus garlic mayo and chipotle ketchup. It was the perfect amount of grease. Not too much, but there, and just yum. 
Hubs got the Juicy Lucy and it was a bit much for him on the liquid grease factor. Overall, the food was delish. 
Also had pretty good service. My issue would be how high the ceilings were and what an open space it is translated to sound travel and there was a loud party thus one less star. It was also pretty expensive - about $60 for two burgers, an order a fries and a few beers.

The food was very tasty! We both had the Juicy Lucy, which is a cheese stuffed burger with your choice of cheese. The meat had good flavor, was juicy and the cheese tasted like real cheese, not the processed yellow stuff other places use. They weren't shy with the toppings and their bacon had a great flavor and was cooked perfectly. I had a side of their chipotle ranch sauce which was surprisingly good. 
Hands down, the BEST sweet potato fries we've had. They have happy hour which is something I don't normally see in Vegas, thumbs up on that too for $2 shock tops.
We were really wanting to try GR Burgr and SOOO glad we came here instead!! No waiting for 2hrs to get food like our friends did that went there.

There was a Groupon for them so we decided to try it out. It's a cool design inside but pretty small. 

I called ahead inquiring about their veggie burger. They make it on premise and it doesn't have soy products in it so the GF could have some too!  I asked about it one more time just to be sure and unfortunately they put flour in it to bind it. I guess I should have asked if it was gluten free.  The manager came by and offered the GF something gluten free which was a salad. 

They did however have sweet potato fries which is one of her favorite things so I was off the hook at least for a little while 

 Kudos to the manager.

The server was very nice.  The menu is build your own burger style which is pretty cool. They don't have a kids menu but they do have smaller burgers that kids would enjoy. 

I ordered the juicy Lucy. It was really good and messy!  The kids loved their burgers too. 

My only complaint and a few places do this. It just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth; no pun intended...The burgers don't come with fries. If you pay $8 to $10 for a burger, you should include fries with it! Potatoes aren't that expensive...

Nevertheless the burger was OK and it didn't quite live up to what the others were saying.,PArJ2C1z2BFMdFV3gkyciQ,1,0,3,GTSdpIpihvPIiTge2pO7OA

My first thought after eating here is the food tastes better than the Burger Bar located between Mandalay and Luxor. Besides the food tasting better, here is why I like the Grind better than Burger Bar:
1. Separate dining area from the bar (you don't have to deal with obnoxious drunks spilling their beer everywhere).
2. Not as busy as Burger Bar (didn't have to wait an hour for a cramped table).
3.You don't have to yell across the table to have a conversation.
4. Parking is waaaaaaay more convenient.
5. Our waitress (I think she is of Japanese descent) was very patient and appreciative and took time to explain the menu (the menu looks like a test).
My only objection was an unnecessary piece of artwork on the wall of a naked chick showing her cuts (like on a cow).",mD1-2v7uoM6Y3rgKg9jqOA,0,0,5,N5jEXE9rKgTkTFxcRKz8xg

1.  Decor - very nice. Very pleasant, clean and a welcoming. The design is simple, yet it is very, very cool and hip at the same time.

2.  Service - Very efficient, they explain all details and help you order from their check list menu, since you pretty much have to order from a list of things to make your burger.

3.  Burgers - Had the ground chuck burger which is the beef choice. Very nice, cooked perfect and at least an inch thick, so it must have been a really huge patty before it was cooked.

4.  Buns - You get to choose your bun and be careful here. It does make a huge difference. I had the ciabatta bun and it was a bit dry. I would go for the regular bun. My kids had it and they loved it.

5.  Shakes - Chocolate and Strawberry Shakes are freakin awesome. Fresh and really refreshing.

6.  Fries - Got the tall and skinny.  Liked these a lot.

7.  Kids - My 16 and 10 year old loved this and said it was the best.

8.  Price - A bit expensive. Burgers for 5, French Fries for 2, Shakes for 3 and Diet Coke 1 - 85.00 without tip.  But, you get what you pay for. This is a really good place and an experience.

For appetizers my friends and I got the buffalo wings and the mozzarella sticks. The buffalo wings were good. The mozzarella sticks were ah-mahhhzing! They use fresh mozzarella with a light yet super crispy batter (that was not super greasy either). The marinara sauce was also tasty and very fresh! It was like a salsa-like marinara sauce. Just delicious!

I love the fact that you can customize your burger just the way you want it. I ordered a turkey burger with the regular stuff (lettuce, tomatoes, and onion) and added grilled onions (girl loves her onions!), grilled mushrooms, grilled peppers (apparently I love grilled things too!) and a fried egg. I was told the burgers here are huge, but dannnng it was HUGE...like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Well, maybe a mini-mini version, in the form of a burger. It was huge! The turkey patty was super lean, juicy and just plain right good. Possibly the best I've had. And I've had my share of turkey burgers (and burgers). I also ordered a side of the fries (short thick fries) that were really good too.

I was cravin a little spice in my life, so I went with a custom burger with a little bit of goodies :

The ""Juicy Lucy"" ($10.99): 8oz Ground Chuck stuffed with Pepper Jack Cheese, Fried Egg ($1.50add), Green Chiles, Jalapenos, Roasted Garlic Mayo, and Chipotle Ketchup. Very juicy burger, even when cooked a little too long. Loved the Garlic Mayo and Chipotle Ketchup, and the portions are large enough to dip the fries in afterwards! 

""Tall and Thin"" fries ($3.99). Fries are a little basic here...not very seasoned. Get some Garlic Mayo and Chipotle Ketchup to dip the fries into! Their sauces have a TON of flavor!  Mmmmm good!

Service was a little slow at first, but when the order was taken, the food came out very fast.

- They won't cut the burger for you. No extra knives. Henry's Burger's is way better and they give you 2 patties. But with honesty,  overall the burger was good. It was cooked well done. I was hoping for a bit red, especially for gourmet style.
- I don't even know why we tipped. the watiress didn't help us for nothin. we took our own order. All she did was hand us our food and gave a check. The bus boy was the one that refilled our drinks.

OK, don't answer that.  But we wanted something for lunch today and we were in the area so we gave Grind a shot.  It made me glad that I didn't take a hiatus from burger restaurants.

Immediately after being seated I practically smacked myself in the head... ""Crap, we have one of those coupons at home from the coupon book.""  I'm one of those people who can't, in good conscience, pay full price for something I know I can get a deal on.  Then, reading through the reviews, I was reminded there was a Groupon ($12 for $25) for this place.  Quickly bought it on my phone and we were in business.  

I love the menu/order sheet.  It felt like I was taking a test I couldn't fail.  My husband tried Juicy Lucy and I had the Grind Sliders.  Both were fantastic.  Loved the burgers and buns!  My sliders came with onion straws, which were delicious!  And we had tall & thin fries - nothing special.  Also had a chocolate milkshake and, while it was good, I wasn't overly impressed and wished I had saved the calories for dessert tonight.

5361303,2012-08-06,0,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"**Summary**
       - The Juicy Lucy - They stuff cheese inside a burger patty and cook it. It's pretty different and delicious if done right. You have cheese oozing out of every bite. The downside is sometimes they screw up and all the cheese is on one side so the other side is just dry. Or, there's a huge hole on one side of the burger and all the cheese oozes out after the first bite.
       - Quality - The burgers are pretty good, but not leaps and bounds above any other decent burger joint.
       - Price - At around $10 for a burger with $0.75 to $1.50 up charge for cheeses and ""premium toppings,"" your burger can run to $15 easy. Add $4 fries and a $3 coke, and it's over $20 a person pre-tax/tip.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd wouldn't really recommend the place. However, if you do go, try the Juicy Lucy. Overall, it just seems like overpriced burgers.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,5,1,2,3mlinewqh2qkb3kcw1apkA

With so many options, it is easy to get lost and rack up the bill. The selection of condiments is astounding. The aiolis alone make up half the list. Besides all of those, they offer a large variety of regular and premium options. I opted for the ""Juicy Lucy"" since it was touted as the specialty of the house. It is an 8oz. burger stuffed with a cheese of choice. Each burger comes with an option of four toppings or sauces. I went with pepper jack cheese, peppercinis,  marinaded mushrooms, peppers, and onions. The last three items did not taste like they were marinaded in anything. The burger was still delicious since the cheese and the pickled peppers added some flavor. The burger itself was ""juicy"" and cooked to a nice medium. Fries do not come with any of the sandwiches. If you want, they are an addition and tend to be enough for two people. We skipped on the fries and added an order of buffalo wings and were set.

Things I liked:  
-Lots of different burger options that you make yourself
-wheat buns
-fast , good service
-food seemed fresh
-green chilis 

Things that really bothered me:
-Did not ask for temperature on burger, and insisted that all burgers were cooked the same way.  Mine was too well done for my liking and I didn't finish it because I was not happy about the flavor.
-No good crust on the outside of the burger
-chairs were stupidly uncomfortable
-skinny fries were quite ordinary 
-charging .75 cents for fucking veggie toppings if you wanted more than two, including pickle chips, lettuce, tomato, and raw onion that normally come with burgers.

I had better burgers at LBS and Burger Bar, which I recommend highly over this place.  Actually, I recommend the slider truck which much better than all of these.

with toppings: ranch, lettuce, and 2 others which I can't remember.
Said it was good.

Onion strings were excellent, Fat steak cut fries were excellent. 
[Good for dipping into the sauces since they're served on the side.]
We shared and took some of both home for later, too.

We cut the burgers in half and each of us took 1/2 home for later

a bit Pricey ... about $34 after tax before tip; we had no alcohol, only 1 soda and water ... Will definitely be back but not too often

Servers were excellent!!

And there's an ABC market in the same center!!",wIH9huA5PCkvoOSycvK5oQ,0,0,4,OhGhg7UWdsgTpcsP94uFig

I ordered the 4oz with swiss, tomatoes, onions and jalapenos...
The waitress told us that the fries were large enough for two people, and she was right, no need to order two orders of fries!
Ill definitely be back...
Highly recommended as Im a lover of a good juicy burger!!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,4,3,5,gDQ_hNtCLHDla2RJk81obg
5795014,2010-10-06,0,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"I say 3.5 stars... I would really give 3, but mentioning Yelp got us a buy 1 burger get one for free:]!!!! Soooooo that properly justifies the 0.5 jump!

I have been dying to try this place since an English professor offered extra credit about the ""controversial"" Juicy Lucy, who I must say, is quite ravishing. Juicy Lucy also has a drink named after her, which I must say again, is quite ravishing! Raspberry vodka, triple sec,  and red bull.. yumm. 

The burger menu is completely create-your-own style. There are no premade or suggested combinations, so prepare to be creative. I did a regular beef patty (you get the choice of turkey or veggie) and it was definitely a big hunk of hamburger meat deliciously oozing with all it's animal goodness. 

For toppings I had the reg's of tomato, lettuce, and onion. I got provolone cheese, and I would have like to seen the cheese melted on the patty a little better.  For my sauce, I got basil pesto mayo which was exactly as I had expected, very yummy for a pesto freak like me. The bun I got for my burger was just the regular burger bun. I didn't  like this at all because it was too fluffy and dough-y to me. I think burger buns should be different than dinner rolls served at Thanksgiving, and this bun wasn't far from that, so next time, I may just go with the ""bed of greens"" they offer as an alternative to a bun.

Fries do not come with your burger, and I suggest sharing because my friend and I put a lot of potato to waste that day:[. She got skinny fries and I got steak fries, it's a personal preference for how you like your fries, I am not going to make an argument of which were better. I will say that the fries were not anything special... they do have sweet potato fries.. if that's more your style. The burgers are just SO BIG that there isn't much room for any fries!

Overall, amidst my long review (which I appreciate you taking the time to read) I feel that for their pricing at around $10 a burger, the burgers are just OK. To me, nothing really gets my attention (aside from the pesto mayo). Service is good, food is alright, and the check is eyebrow raising.. so mention Yelp, and make your visit worthwhile.",xvtBlzl5ZPgrGiWLA97bGQ,0,0,3,JMabIslHe8lxhdxNF2qwOQ
5837894,2013-11-12,1,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"My, what consistency!  Diane and I came here again--this time for lunch, and each of us enjoyed an exquisitely juicy and delicious burger made spot on to order.  I even selected a Whole Wheat Bun to turn the experience into some semblance of healthy eating, and didn't really notice the difference from the regular soft white bun that is served here.  While the hot Tall & Thin Fries were as good as ever, for a change of pace I ordered Onion Strings, never surmising that a veritable volcano of thin, tender, and lightly battered Onion Rings that were almost as high as my head would be presented before me.  They tasted as great as they looked, with or without the Cayenne Pepper Ranch Dressing that accompanied them, and are highly addictive.  But with good discipline I was able to leave three-quarters of the pile uneaten.  

Then to my right I saw a neighboring diner lapping up one of the best Hot Fudge Sundaes I have ever seen; it was just oozing with large drips of Chocolate Fudge Sauce beneath a high undulating layer of Whipped Cream.  We headed out soon afterward, before temptation overtook us.  This was just lunch after all!

As long as the Grind's kitchen keeps turning out delicious hamburgers and  accompaniments, this will continue to be one of my main go-to burger haunts.  I don't mind paying more for this quality of fresh food, and like my burgers to be memorable.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,5,RoHnRKwxzYqGN4jqn4z2ZA
5848955,2012-11-05,4,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"Finally have had a chance to try a burger here since my boyfriend has been telling me about it for the longest time. We just happen to have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger from the 2013 Entertainment book so here we went for dinner! I have no idea how the College kids can afford to eat here with these prices.

They give you a product requisition form (menu) and you check off what you would like such as the size patty and the toppings you want. This is creative, cute and perhaps fun however it just really delayed the time in getting our order in. Myself being a Grind Burger virgin it just seemed to take forever to go over the complete menu, mark off what I wanted just to have the Server repeat it back to us. Save the paper and printing fees and just create a more reasonable menu.

Every item is Ala carte which is fine however when it is like that I expect the side items, such as fries to be really good not just ordinary. I was disappointed with the fries they were lacking flavor and the portion for what they charge was very little. We ordered the short & thick fries which are potato wedge style and nothing special.

I decided on a 4oz burger 7.49 with cheddar .75 additional and free toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and garlic mayo. How is it free, who wants a plain burger seriously and those are standard cheeseburger toppings to specify them as free is absurd. Anyhow, my boyfriend got the infamous ""Juicy Lucy"" a patty with cheese on the inside 10.99 he opted for Pepper Jack. He truly enjoyed his burger that he had consumed in less than 4 bites, yikes and that is an 8oz patty!

I was joking with my boyfriend that this is not a place that I would come on a first date,  as it was so damn messy! The burgers taste good and are really juicy as my meat juice and toppings were just oozing all over the place! I had a damn hamburger salad left on my plate after I finished my burger. 

The hamburger buns are the star player as they were so fresh and tasty almost a hint of sweetness like Hawaiian sweet bread.

The Service was good, maybe too attentive. We went on a Sunday night and asked to sit in the bar so that we could watch the football game while eating. Unfortunately we were the only ones there dining at the time which I usually like when we eat out rather than huge crowds! The bartender gal had nothing to do but focus on us. She was nice but way too in our mix, we just want to relax and eat and if you are coming over every second or talking to us from across the room every moment it is rather annoying! I know who complains about an attentive staff however this was beyond ridiculous and avoiding eye contact was not working either. When I am busy stuffing my face with a big fat juicy burger the last thing i want to do is have to respond to a conversation I never wanted to join in the first place!  

This is one of those burger joints I only need to try once, I am one and done. Next!


I posted pictures of our meals as well, enjoy :)

5910307,2013-05-27,1,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"Grind Burger is located off the strip in a hotel/shopping center area close to UNLV. 

It's ""sort of"" within walking distance of strip hotels, but only if you don't mind getting your exercise and sweating a bit in the Vegas heat. We initially chose this place for dinner because it isn't a crowded tourist trap, and it was dead on a Tuesday night. Our server and the bartender were friendly and helpful, but it took awhile to get the check at the end of our meal

They have a good happy hour, with $2 beer and specials on apps. However, the cheese sticks and marinara sauce were underwhelming and bland. The build-your-own-burger concept has been done better elsewhere (I live in California and like The Counter better than Grind Burger) but they do have some unique toppings here. 

Unfortunately, the burger was underseasoned and overcooked, and for the price, was a disappointment. Not bad, but not worth the expense, either.",uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,2,1,3,4lpdLIRE2gwRw27slDZtxQ

5945436,2011-06-28,1,UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag,"I came here twice during our stay at the Bluegreen Club 36 right next door. The hotel gave us 2 complimentary drinks with purchase of 2 entrees tickets. So we thought we might as well put the free drinks to use.

I tried the Turkey Burger (8.95) and the Juicy Lucy (9.95). They were both really good. I couldn't finish both burgers the 2 times i ordered a burger. They were on the bigger portion side. But I liked how you can customize up to 4 toppings, cheese, sauce, bun, extra sides for extra charge, and your type of meat. They gave you a check list to fill out what you want. I liked bubbling the circles in haha.

I also tried one of their salads called Grind Chop Chop for $8.95. It had a good variety of veggies in it. 

I choose a glass of sauvignon blanc for my complimentary drink and it was good.

Service was normal. It was enough attention and friendliness. 

This place had a regular dining place and a bar in the other room. 

Prices were decent for the amount of food you get. I would definitely come back to eat and drink again if I'm in vegas or stayed at a place near here.",Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,2,3,4,eeL9s6dWzS7MREFdBir96w

I also notice that there is a coupon in the Entertainment coupon book that I look forward to redeeming as well. On top of the Yelp check-in offer, make sure you take advantage of one of these offers.

The food is still on par and I enjoy the ambiance for the most part. Still not a great fan of building my own burger, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. I wish they would add pineapple as one of the topping options so I could build a proper teriyaki burger.

There were also many different toppings to choose from from your regular lettuce and tomatoes to their special toppings, different mayo and dressings. My wife had the chicken breast sandwich and she loved hers too. We will definitely come back for a third time the next time we visit Vegas.",uBtvSCFjrxItSmvqBNvRUg,0,0,5,d_s0OCodTIiBYaEE7_ZU9A
