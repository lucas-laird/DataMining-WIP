The restaurant is pretty quiet because it is upstairs and there isn't a lot of foot traffic.

Since moving to Summerlin I have ordered from countless Thai restaurants and often found the food to be bland or down right terrible. I was on the verge of giving up on Thai delivery when i happened across Baan Thai. The pad Thai was delish, the yellow curry though ...was seriously amazing... so good that I just ordered it for lunch after having it for dinner last night. Whoever they have in the kitchen deserves an extra star because the food is flavorful and nuanced.

The main entree was grilled salmon with a mango salad which was very delicious. Each bite made me feel so happy! The combination went together so well.

2464663,2017-03-11,0,NnV0LkIs5YjUSPzAP1nWXQ,"Want to check out this place since there's a Thai food place in Chinatown and since my love for Thai food is never ending. It's located on the second floor in SF supermarket building next to the Veggie house. (Map quest place the location in the middle of the street for some reason..) 

Because we didn't had time to eat there we ordered Duck curry, Pad See Ew w/ chicken, Pineapple fried rice and Garlic lover w/ fried tofu, all to go. And OHMYGOD the food is soooo good! I saw couple of reviews were they said pas see ew was lacking veggies actually it was fine for me. They had so much meat in all the dishes as well.  Their spicy level rate from 1-5 and everything we ordered were spicy no#3 except for garlic lover w/ tofu, which was none spicy. But I think I'm going spicy no#4 or 5 next time because spicy no#3 level was not spicy for me. Then again I eat spicy food every day so it's nothing for me, so I suggest if you are new to Thai food or first time going to eat at Baan go with a lower spicy level so that way you know what level it is that you are comfortable with. (Because every Thai food place differ in spicy level) 

My sister was the one who went to pick the food and the first thing she told me was ""this place is so clean you can eat off the floor so I think this is an awesome restaurant."" She also said the hostess was super nice and was all smile the entire time she was there. Which is a plus in my book! Plus they offer Vegan food too!!! 

Overall super glad there's a Thai food place in Chinatown where there's easy access to park, get the food and not pricy. Also the fact the food is really good! So going back there... a lot!!!!",DrwsGLbdfo4fit83gZ_XAQ,5,0,5,cXkQjIlhF9zDLECh-5ZEww

Family lunch at Baan Thai today. Nice experience, kind of hard to seat 6 people but they accommodated quickly. We ordered family style and enjoyed a wide variety of appetizers and entree's. We ordered waters all around a Thai coffee, which was exceptionally good.

For appetizers we tried the chicken satay 5/5, fish cakes 5/5, papaya salad spicy 2, was very spicy for a 2 out of 5 but still quite enjoyable 4/5 and lastly he Tom kha soup with shrimp 4/5. Over the appetizers were very good and plenty for a large party.

Entree's came out quickly which was nice.

With the wide variety even though some entree's weren't great we all enjoyed the variety and different flavors.

For dessert we tried the sticky rice with mango 5/5 and the sweet roti 4/5. I would have given the roti a better rating but after having authentic roti at the Thai temple in Las Vegas its hard to beat.

I swore off yellow curries, as I either couldn't guarantee their vegan-ness (see my review on Weera  after ~5yrs of eating there!) or I just was disappointed. It has been so long since I could enjoy one.
Well, tonight's yellow curry was ridiculously above & beyond amazing....We also got red curry, which was decidedly amazing. They both had a lovely presentation. And they actually were spicy, as we  requested. I hate when places judge.

The orange tofu was unique & excellent, really fresh tasting. It didn't taste too sweet or too breaded or too processed. I've never had another like it. It wasn't just fried cubes or frozen fake chicken.

Not sure if Dine in experience is better or not but I'm unwilling to take the chance. Beware the delivery fee is $9. I ordered the Pad Thai, Spring rolls and Mango & Sticky Rice. The Pad Thai had absolutely no flavor. I opened the foil and to my surprise the food was still hot (Pad Thai only, I had to reheat spring rolls). The delivery was over an hour so I'm assuming that's why my spring rolls were barely lukewarm once I received them. Back to the Pad Thai, no flavor. I had to add salt to even tolerate it. I didn't even finish half the dish before tossing it. The spring rolls are not authentic Thai spring rolls. They were mushy lacking in flavor and vegetables. They clearly weren't fried long enough as there was no crunch to the rolls. They were just plain disgusting, a compete waste of $5. The only barely tolerable part of my overpriced $40+ meal was the mango and sticky rice. The sauce wasn't what I was used to but it was decent. Not sure why they put cherries on top, it's not the right garnishing or flavor. Nothing should outshine the mango, and the cherry just made everything taste weird, so I tried to eat around them. Again not something that Thai restaurants do with this dish. The food is probably better at the restaurant but even still, delivery shouldn't be this bad. Huge disappointment.

I decided on giving Baan Thai Restaurant a try when I was invited out to lunch with one of my business clients. Prior to yesterday's experience it had been a while since I had went out for a good Thai lunch.

When we arrived, it was a bit confusing to find this place as they are located in a shopping center with several other businesses. If you are counting on a GPS to get you here, it will tell you that you have arrived as soon as you get into the parking lot which yeah in a sense you have but not all the way. After looking all around and up and down standing from the bottom of the parking lot. We spotted Baan Thai on the 2nd level. Basically right in the middle of the shops at the top.

Once we walked In, there was nobody in the place. I thought for a moment maybe they were closed and forgot to lock the door? I don't know.. Anyways finally this man comes from the back and greets us and welcomes us to sit wherever we would like. I began to wonder though slightly to myself why it was lunch time and nobody was there. In the faith of the number of star ratings I had previously seen that they have earned I still decided to stay. Now lunch time was over at 3:00 PM so we had plenty of time to still take advantage of the lunch hour prices on the menu.

After browsing the condensed version of the regular menu (lunch). I actually ended up ordering off of the regular menu because there really wasn't anything that peaked any interest for my taste buds. The food ordered for this visit was as followed:

Baan Thai Fish Cakes: Deep fried mini fish cake squares. Served with sweet chili, cucumber crushed peanuts.

Teriyaki Chicken

Combination(Chicken/Shrimp/Beef) Pad Thai: Rice noodle pan-fried with eggs, bean sprouts, green onions, tamarind sauce, and ground peanut.

Thai Iced Tea with Boba

Overall, everything was just okay. Service was good. I mean maybe I visited on a day where things were just OK because I'm seeing all these 5-star rating and kind of got my hopes up... Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible however it wasn't great. I've had better..

Also the beef was very tough and tasted as though the meat were boiled. We also got Kung Pao Chicken and Basil chicken. The kung pao chicken was full of liquid, they put cabbage in it and it was swimming with veggies in liquid with a few pieces of chicken. It also had a fishy taste to it. The Basil chicken had a very weird flavor I couldn't put my finger on and had a very overwhelming scent to it. I spent $50 at this place and was not satisfied with the flavor, quantity or quality. For their prices the meat should be a nice cut, fresh flavors and not swimming in a bowl or sauce. I do not recommend this restaurant.

We came in for dinner after searching on yelp. The place is very clean and the decorations on the walls and inside the place are neat, including the flower vase and the placemats on each table. There are tv screens as well.

We had egg rolls, tom yum soup with seafood, pad thai with chicken, pad kee mao with pork, and basil fried rice with shrimp. We chose the medium 2~3 spice level.

The eggrolls were golden, crispy, and served with sweet and sour sauce. 
The tom yum soup was very good. 
Pad thai was one of the best I've had. 
Pad kee mao had good flavor.
I could taste the strong flavor of the basil, house special sauce in the basil fried rice.

4730274,2018-02-15,0,NnV0LkIs5YjUSPzAP1nWXQ,"I felt adventurous today so I fired up Yelp to look for a new place to try for lunch. 

What caught my attention with Baan Thai was that it was under the category of ""vegetarian, vegan"". 

The reviews from my fellow Yelpers along with the close proximity to work made this an easy pick. 

We got in around 1130am. There were about 4 other parties already seated. It took a minute or so to get greeted and to get a table. 

I ordered from the lunch menu. I ordered the only vegetarian choice which was stir fried vegetables. The lunch came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. 

My impressions on the food. The egg drop soup was rather salty. The stir fried vegetables were good. It was served in a light brown sauce paired with white rice. There was definitely good flavor to the stir fry dish. The egg roll was mediocre. 

The service there could have been better. There was only one server working. The server worked as quickly as she could, tending to the tables, taking orders, brining out food etc. With the lunch crowd arriving I would have thought there would have been at least a few servers. The server did the best that she could. However, with only one server running the entire restaurant, service was a bit slow. 

I didn't dive deep into the menu but from what I read there didn't appear to be many vegan or vegetarian options. Under the vegetarian section there were about 5 different dishes to pick from. 

The establishment was clean. Located in the shopping plaza on the second floor it took me a minute to find it. I used the Yelp application to navigate to the shopping plaza. Once getting to the plaza we walked around to find it.
