The fries were awesome!  The hubby had the sin city burger which tasted equally amazing!

Too late I had already swallowed two bites.  I took it back the restaurant and the manager put his initials on my receipt for a free burger another day.  Not worth it because I am not going back.  Today I woke up with a churning gut and had to run to a doctor to get a prescription for anti-biotics.  Better than days on the toilet.

1516273,2014-09-09,0,TUrQG_XfJA_kCOSN0oUbTQ,"Hubby and I tried this Smashburger on a Sunday afternoon for the first time. We were both disappointed slightly. I ordered the Sin City burger which comes with a fried egg, bacon American cheese, grilled onions and onion strings as well as their smash sauce. The burger was served hot. Very hot. So hot that it never cooled off. I have no idea how it stayed so hot that I was still burning my tongue on the last bite. I wish that the egg had been slightly runny but with the sandwich that hot it didn't stand a chance. Even if it had been runny when put on the burger the yolk would have cooked in the time it took me to get to it. So while tasty the burger was a bit dry. My hubby ordered the new Mushroom Swiss burger in a big size. He loved the egg bun. His burger was not hot. He enjoyed the tasted, but said it wasn't anything special.  He also thinks that "" big "" means they simply smash the burger so much that it hangs over the side of the bun more because my burger was thicker than his. Our sides were both served cold. Hubby asked for the Smashed fries which are supposed to have olive oil, garlic and rosemary. The flavor fell flat. I ordered onion strings. They were okay but the ranch I requested tasted like it came out of a bottle and I hate bottled ranch. Its so easy to make that companies that cheap out this way always piss me off. We both agreed to try a different location of SmashBurger and hope for better results. The staff was pleasant but didn't go out if their way to help obvious new customers. The men's restroom did not have soap so I hope they had some in the kitchen for the staff to use after they visited. The ladies room was fine.

I love those fries so much they are my favorite. But I have been to this location a few times and this last time I went was the worst customer service I have experienced so far. I work in the food industry and I don't expect people to go above and beyond but this was just crap. The girl who works there with the red/orange hair and the glasses had to be doped up on something. I ordered my food online for pick up and I arrived and I saw one bag on the counter under the heat lamp and I assumed it was mine but I wasn't gonna just grab it because I wasn't sure. She was helping these two guys and I'm pretty sure they were flirting and she was taking her sweet time and she knew I was waiting I had to be standing there for at least 4 minutes and then my boyfriend said ""Is that to go order #79? We just want to get our food so it isn't sitting there getting cold."" And she's all ""OHHHHH YEAH OKAAAAYYY"" kind of sounding like a bimbo like she had no idea what he said and he spoke to her in another language or something. And she grabs other people's food and walks away to put it on the tables. We just stood there shocked like... Is she on something? Could she not comprehend what we said?

1902898,2014-01-13,0,TUrQG_XfJA_kCOSN0oUbTQ,"This place is very similar to Five Guys Burgers and In and Out burger.  I think one of things I like compared to those mentioned, is the garlic oil fries.  Some people don't like the thinner fries, but I love them and especially with the garlic flavor.  The burgers are pretty big, and can be ordered as a single or double.  They have a good number of extras you can get on the burgers.  There are plenty of pre-configured burger selections, as well as an option to build your own.  Many of the standard toppings are free no matter how many of them you want, while the more elite toppings will cost you such as bacon, avacado etc.  I think the one negative is that the price is a little bit high.  For the single with garlic oil fries and a drink was just shy of $9.00.  I personally don't think that is super expensive, but I know I can get burgers from other places that are just as good for a few bucks cheaper.  The price at In and Out is usually less than $7.00 for me.  So all in all the food has been good, but the extra few dollars I have to spend makes me rate this a bit lower.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,0,0,3,ia0-IwAu6yBUNH5QlLeDJQ

Myburger was done by the time it took me to put down my napkins and return with a drink. And though it is a little formulaic at times, it was what I was hoping for. 

I alos have to say that the employees were quite pleasant and efficient. This was on a recent Wednesday and we timed it just right between the lunch crowd and the dinner set. The employees were downright chipper and engaging. Which, this being fast food, was a pleasant delight. And not neccesarily what I'm used to. So give props to the peeps behind the counter at this location.

I mentioned formulaic. Which defines fast food. You are disappointed when it falls flat and comes up short of the pictures that are emblazoned on the walls.

Been to many other Smash locations in the valley and haven't been disappointed with one until now. First off, the employees are kind of clueless here which drags out the ordering process.

The salad looked the same as usual at first glance but after I left the store and later tried to eat my salad, I realized they hadn't included any dressing. Really? I'm sure they just forgot but I'm now left with a salad that can't be eaten. If I had gone home that would be a different story but I didn't and was still out, which means there is nowhere to find salad dressing.

Once my afternoon was sufficiently wasted standing in line while the inexplicably solo girl behind the counter feverishly tried to make shakes, take orders, and deliver food, I managed to place an order. Sin city, buffalo fries. 
The Buffalo fries are interesting, I probably would have enjoyed them had they not been salted like they were being prepared for jerky. My assumption is that the tears that fell on them from the poor girl who was lamenting not doing better in school had a great deal to do with this. 
The burger was good. Not bad. Not great. Good, if a lil flavorless. I think the assault of salt from my initial dive into the fries might have desensitized my buds. 
Save yourself the frustration.  There's a 5 guys a couple of doors down. Their fries aren't as flashy but you won't feel like committing arson either.",E_ajMGs3ncNs_Gq0hTKvUw,0,1,1,dtgpf5G6kiAgRHNQ49c0yg

The kids weren't even eating there, the parents or whoever just dropped them off to beg for money!! Oh wait, there is more!  The icing on the cake was when three women (one of them passed out on the table) were getting up to leave.  And the one woman left, and the other woman tried waking her friend.

However, this place I can taste the difference.  They claim that they use a ball of angus beef and then beat it into a patties.

I believe it. 

I ordered the regular truffle mushroom Swiss burger.  It was tasty.  The bun is a soft egg bread.  The beef tastes like small pieces of beef--not hamburger meats.

Thumb up!

The haystack onions was a disappointment.  I like my onion thick and juicy.  This one is cut to super thin and string like.  The coating is very like and spicy like, so the onion has flavors.  However, the onion is simply cut too thin. After deep frying there is a roasted taste to them--not good, a bitterness from over burn.  

The Texas petal sauce is just like a dressing with a hint of mustard taste--ok.

Therefore, all the stars are for the quality of the beef.  Everything else is average or below average.",0kZ_WFf52u52ksqfnP20ig,0,0,4,jcqO3zr3lRFPEd-RV1GhZw

By 11:52, I was still standing there waiting for my order.  I had been acknowledged pretty much right when I arrived, and the young lady fulfilling the orders kept asking the kitchen about where my food was, but still i waited, and waited and waited and at this point, a significant amount of time that I should have spent eating was instead spent standing around.  I get that there was a HUGE take-out order in front of me, but isn't there a way to adjust the way that the online system assigns pick up times for that?  I've used plenty of other online ordering systems that adjust wait times based on traffic in the store.  Oh, also, my fries were pretty cold because I think they'd just been hanging out for 20 minutes while my burger was being prepped...so....that was like the icing on the cake.

Most everything is a la carte, and the prices range from anywhere between $5.99 to $6.99+ depending on what kind of burger you'd like. The fries average $1.99 for a medium and up to $3.49 depending on the type of fries you pick. Oh, and of course, you should order a beverage with your meal that will also cost a minimum of $1.99. Bottom line, you can easily spend a hefty chunk of change for a burger, fries, and a drink. Is it worth it?... Sure, depending on what you order. 

I ordered the Sin City burger, which I would assume is their most popular selection, as it is conveniently placed at the very top of the menu. It has bacon and a fried egg on it. All in all, it's pretty tasty. 

I give the place a 3 star outta 5 because I was disappointed with their Smash Fries which come topped with garlic and rosemary. The fries are shoe-string style, and they're isn't too much flavor because the chef wasn't too giving with the garlic and rosemary. Also, I had one of their HaagenDaz milkshakes; the chocolate Oreo flavor. I was disappointed about how thin the shake was. The advertisement on the wall stated that their milkshakes were thick, but alas, they're thin and easy to drink throw a straw.

When I dropped off my mom and auntie at the Las Vegas South Outlet, I was overwhelmed with lunch options. There is a long line of eateries parallel to the outlet.  Smashburger seemed the most interesting of the bunch,  so that's where this adventure started. 

The front door is wide open with the air conditioner on. Lighting is on the subdued side with windows only at the front. The convenient restroom is along the wall on the left.  Seating is on lower tables with bench sofas or high tables with bar stools. Service was adequate and satisfactory. Parking is free and there are even reserved stalls for Smashburger! 

I started with the Classic Smash - the original with cheese,  onion, tomato, pickles, lettuce, Smash sauce and ketchup on an egg bun. The onion and pickles were flavorful enough so I didn't taste the special sauce. Overall, the burger seemed average, and I really appreciated the toasted bun.

Next, I had the Signature ""Sin City"" burger with fried egg, special sauce, grilled onions, haystack onions, cheese and Applewood smoked bacon.  As good as it sounds, it was a bit rich so I wasn't able to finish it.

Many people may be wondering why it's called ""smash"" burger. ..it's because the patty is smashed on the grill when it's being cooked to sear the outside and seal the juices in. It apparently works because the patty was moist! 

I had a good experience and I wouldn't mind returning and having an Avocado Club burger or Truffle Mushroom Swiss.  Create your own burger is another option.   ... or should I go shopping?  Hahaha!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,26,22,4,OBm_IGlC1TG5QAE73hp67w

Luckily my friend ordered the veggie frites  (carrots and green beans, flash fried) so I snagged a few of those.  When an employee came to take our plates, she asked if I wanted a box.  I advised that the chicken did not look or taste right.  She said she had heard that a couple of times today but offered nothing.

At first bite, the burger was good - maybe I was really hungry.  Anyhow, towards the end of the meal I felt like I was shovelling mounds of salt into my mouth - between the burger patty and the fries, there was just way too much salt.  Not sure if this is the taste they are going for - it's not my preference.  It was good to try, but I probably won't be back when I need a burger fix.  Two burgers and two fries w/ one drink totaled a little over $20 for me and hubby.  For the price, it is not worth it - for that price, red robin quality is what's more on par to fit that bill.

4074277,2013-08-22,0,TUrQG_XfJA_kCOSN0oUbTQ,"A new Smashburger on my side of town? Yay, I'm happy! Smashburger has some pretty high quality burgers as far as fast casual restaurants go. I was excited to finally get over there to try the place. 

First off, the space is way too small for a Smashburger. I don't know why they thought they could cram one into this teeny tiny space. I would avoid coming here during popular meal times because there would be nowhere to sit. They are severely lacking in seating space and tables. Another problem is their huge windows mean more than half of the seating is made unusable when the sun is hitting them just right. You will be blinded or roasting from the solar rays. They have pull down shades but they do a poor job of blocking out the sun. The layout of the place is funky as well, with their fountain drink machine located in this weird corner, causing big bottlenecks when customers are trying to fill their drinks. (Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though). 

The girl taking our orders was very slow and confused but I'm guessing this is just because the place recently opened. As always, I'll go back in a few weeks to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks. The kitchen was FAST, much faster than any other Smashburger I've ever been to. This sort of worried me and I expected my burger to taste crappy or my order to be incorrect -- but it wasn't!

My burger was exactly how I ordered it and it was good! It didn't look that tasty but it tasted great. I was very happy. Most of you know I'm a low carb eater so I love when a place doesn't blink twice when I ask for ""no bread or bun."" Sometimes it's too difficult for people to understand and my burger comes out on a bun anyway. Here it was SUPER EASY. In fact, the kitchen even served my burger on two slices of lettuce so I could make them into a ""bun"" if I wished (see my photo). I LOVED THIS! THEY EARNED AN EXTRA STAR JUST FOR THIS!

Premium add-ons like bacon and avocado will cost you $1 each. I'm totally bummed that they have removed the chili from their menu. I loved adding chili to my burger. Now it's kind of boring without it.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,0,0,4,MugGFGyDFEZfjYtIJPff8A

I've only had Smashburger once before. My coworkers picked me up a Sin City burger from one of the earlier Vegas locations. I remember it being a well-balanced burger and I enjoyed the experience.

Fast forward to now. They finally opened a location closer to work. I again ordered a Sin City burger. This time, I asked for the multi-grain bun. I added a side of Smash Fries. They are the same price as regular fries, but add rosemary, olive oil, and garlic to the mix.

The short of it? The fries were salty and the burger was good but not great. The bacon on the burger overwhelmed the overall flavor. It may have been compounded by the salty fries. By the end, I was thankful to be done eating.

I'm handing out the good old 3-star treatment for now. I'll definitely return to try a different burger and probably skip the fries. On the positive side, they just opened and were handling the lunch rush quite well.

It's not hard to make sweet potato smash fries but this location has found a great way to mess them up. On my last visit the fries that were brought to the table were swimming in grease. And when I say swimming, we're talking a pool of oil and grease that was almost 3 stacked fries deep in the bottom, and let me tell you the few fries that I found that were not coated with their soggy oil were nasty enough that I spit them out. 

When I go somewhere and end up spitting out my food, that warrants an immediate Star drop. While the Spicy Jalapeno Chicken was just as good as ever...the fries were an absolute disgrace and should have never left the back to be served to a customer. 

2 Stars. I will go back...but I hope I never see a pile of fries swimming in that much oil and grease ever again. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Bleech. I hope someone in corporate sees this and takes the time to ask what in the heck happened as this is NOT the Smashburger experience that I've come to expect.

Walking in this place you can see there's a good vibe and layout. Just order at the counter and pick a table. The cashier was pretty knowledgeable about the food choices. And the food came out quickly. Pretty smooth so far.

As far as the taste of the food I got the avocada club it had Fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, ranch dressing and mayo. This probably the only burger where I could actually taste the avocado! The bacon wasn't some silly paper thin bacon too, it was bacon only gods would eat. Burger was definitely a 5/5.
The smash fries on the other hand....taste super bland. Just a whole bunch of unnecessary oil that give no flavoring at all.
