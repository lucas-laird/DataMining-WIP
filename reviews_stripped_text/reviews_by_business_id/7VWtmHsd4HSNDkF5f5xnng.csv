There is free WiFi, but I wasn't able to get it to work on several devices. Hopefully, that's a minor issue that will be fixed soon. The most exciting part of the visit was the, ""make it your way"" Coke machine. There are 100's of possible drink combinations with this device. Everyone had a great time making mixed drinks.

However, the current manager here is EXTREMELY RUDE. Treats ""his employees"" like poorly abused worker bees. After speaking to him kindly and nicely requesting service he got really rude and irate with me like I was some poor criminal trying to steal his hamburgers. I mean I can go to other local establishments to get good and better service but a small suggestion to this manager would be to provide better service and get an attitude check because with all the high competition of local businesses all they really have to show for is their service.

The store was clean, but all the doors were open when I came up to the restaurant. I inquired with the cashier why this was happening and she informed me that there air conditioning is on the Frits. I feel for the staff here at the King. They all have such great attitudes and a friendly smile to greet the guest though. 

They have fans blowing but with out hot desert air it is not the same as air, but at least they are trying to keep the atmosphere of the dining experience all good and well. Acts of god are not counted against anyone. This could happen to anyone. It is how they are working together as a collective and ensuring that the guests are comfortable and happy. So thanks to this Burger King crew I hope that your air gets fixed soon. 

I ordered the food to go and decided on two orders of 10 pieces nuggets. That way the twins each have their own. Even at 15 they still fight. I also got them plain cheeseburgers too. Plus the puppy will need something from here too. One cannot bring cheeseburgers home without one for the furry baby.

   I am also a cola fan. The star of the newest Las Vegas Burger King is the computerized Coke machine. Normally I am impressed if a restaurant has strawberry soda. There are 105 flavors. What is also impressive is the amount of diet colas.
   The restaurant itself is on the small side. The interior is modern. And it is clean.
   The employees were friendly.
    Despite its location on Las Vegas Boulevard, a couple of miles south of the Strip proper, it is difficult to find. It is just south of the outlet center, between Windmill and Warm Springs on the east side of the road.
