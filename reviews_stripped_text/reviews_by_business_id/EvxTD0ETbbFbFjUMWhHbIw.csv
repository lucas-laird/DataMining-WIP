I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.

Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!",0M5eh7SDDq8sXQE3GpKGdA,0,0,5,O16km1usO6K52QKxZ48wIQ

Sadly there's not a lot of place that sell good curry in Vegas but with some research we found this place and I convinced my boyfriend to go try it even if it's quite far away from our home. It was a really good decision ! The owner gave us a warm welcome and was really friendly and talkative with us. The curry is amazing ! The gravy is thick and give this warm feeling that curry should have. And I like how we can add the topping of our choice (I was really glad they have cheese as topping option, as a cheese lover, haha.)

Their curry recipe is very good,  It has a darker, tangy, savory, gravy-like flavor- and it is less sweet than most Japanese curry that I have had. I've dined at many Japanese curry restaurants, and Oh Curry ranks among the best. Definitely a must-try if you are looking for something different, or just a simple, affordable, good-tasting meal.

Other thoughts: their menu is simple and straightforward by design. I suggested to the host that they might want to consider adding tofu as an option for vegetarian diners, and I got the sense they might possibly be open to it if there seemed to be demand for it from their customers.",cpCi_CM1v7tu2i4u5mWJAQ,0,0,5,FAFmvPwvIAwh7w4JcOLOZQ

I usually get the hot tonkatsu curry, and it is the BEST! The thickness and the crispy-ness is just right. I recommend it if you're good with spicy food. My mom says the hot curry is too spicy for her, so she gets the regular curry. 

The waiting time could vary depending on the number of orders in front, so I like to call ahead and order for my whole family and pick it up. The owner and the employee is always FRIENDLY.

The tonkatsu curry is most often recommended in the reviews, so I opted for that with a medium heat level and the coffee jello dessert. Started with the sweets because that's just how I roll, and was surprised at the quality. Not something I'd usually like, but solid and unique.
The curry though? Good-size portion for a good price. But the curry sauce that makes the dish was bland and almost flavorless. I guess I should have upped the spice, but the sauce itself should have had flavor aside from just heat, and I didn't find this to be the case.

2245793,2015-07-25,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"Oh! Curry is a pleasant surprise: Japanese Curry dishes that are tasty and affordable. 

We were visiting Las Vegas + drove around looking for somewhere affordable to eat, off the Vegas Strip. We ended up at Oh! Curry located in a small strip mall. Most, if not all, entrees were $6.99 My daughters and I each had chicken curry (with grilled chicken) and my husband had the vegetable curry. Each plate was simple: steamed white rice, a generous serving of thick, savory curry sauce + cut up chicken (or sautéed vegetables). The portions were good: we don't have large appetites so each plate was enough, however it might not be enough for larger appetites. 

The restaurant had coupons for free items so we chose the free kid's meal, which was rice, 2 chicken nuggets, a serving of curry sauce and French fries. 

There was only one guy manning the register. He brought the food out to us and later took back the dirty dishes. The food was brought out as it became ready, so 2 of us got our meals, then the next 2 and a little later, the rest of the meals came out. We didn't mind this, but I know some people like all the meals brought out at the same time. 

The meals were served on regular plates, with silverware. Paper napkins were available at the counter. We got fountain sodas, so nothing fancy. The decor is very simple + plain.  

There are information leaflets on the history of curry in Japan. It's a nice read while you're waiting for your food and it was pretty informative. It's clear that the owners know what they're doing and they're proud of what they do. 

The restroom was clean and tidy. The ladies room was a single stall, large enough to be accessible for those with disabilities. 

So in conclusion, Oh! Curry offers delicious food at a reasonable price. Service is friendly, decor is plain. Great choice if you're hungry.",ZlMOsCT9T8TON1TtkIWzvg,2,0,5,SCvsPfUb1d9hhG1V9nhRHw

After we all ordered 2 chicken katsu curries one regular and mild with a side of the potato croquettes and 1 spicy pork cutlet. We were all amazed how delicious the curry was. There pickled radish was the best in town especially with my rice and curry. The katsu was the bomb cooked just right not to tough like a lot of these places serving katsu here in  Vegas.

Living on the other side of town, there's another Japanese curry place that is more convenient to get to, but is definitely not as authentic.  I ordered the hot curry and it was just like I was back in Japan, wandering around Tokyo Station when I was a kid. Curry rice was a staple for me when I was there, as when I was younger I didn't really care for grilled fish and sushi which seemed to be everywhere. While there are other places which sell Japanese curry here in town, none of them have the flavor that this one does.

The owner is very friendly, and says he is from Tokyo.  It shows in his curry, as it tastes just like it should. 

If you're close by and have never tried Japanese curry, definitely stop in and have some. The prices are good for the portion size and the service is great. Even if you're nowhere close, and you want to know what REAL Japanese curry tastes like, it's definitely worth the drive. They also have delivery with BiteLV & Uber Eats.

As for the food, I felt it had good flavor but, the sizes were extremely to large. After a few bites it was to much of the same flavor and texture. Loved the potato cakes and thought they were the best part of the meal. 
I gave a lower score as well due to the soft drink fountain not being fully operational. All they offered to drink were canned green tea, another soda, and bottle water. Not to mention they were out of beef by 3 pm. If you have a business I feel that you need to be 100% all the time in a competitive town such as this.

2563310,2014-02-06,3,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"WHY: WOOHOOO!! There is finally a Japanese curry place on the East Side!! THAT'S WHY! =D

WHO: Bring your entire family!! I believe they do a free meal for kids if you eat there (check me on how many kids though, lol).

WHEN: Monday through Saturday they are open from noon-9pm, Sundays from noon to 8pm.

WHERE: In the small plaza on the corner of Nellis & Stewart (right beside Shell gas station).

WHAT: First and foremost... Can I get a HALLELUJAH?! 
I am so thankful that this Cute Curry Cafe (you like that alliteration, don't you? Lol) opened right down the street from my house!! (because I randomly have curry cravings). 

Japanese curry is a fusion of different spices from Asia, and is certainly delicious and Tasty! It comes in three levels of spiciness: Mild, Regular, & Hot. There are different combos such as Tonkatsu (Pork cutlet) curry, Vegetable with curry, chicken with curry, and you can even request their fried chicken with curry. Whatever you choose is a good choice, but I personally recommend the Tonkatsu curry! It is just worth your TIME AND MONEY!

On the dessert end, they have an Orange jello called the ""Orange Dream"" topped with whipped cream. NOTE** If you're curious and willing to try, they have this BOMB.ORG coffee jello topped with whipped cream. It's not on the menu yet, but ASK FOR IT! It is absolutely REFRESHING!

& If the curry, rice & your choice combo doesn't seem to suffice your TUMMY, try the french fries with curry, or the fried chicken with curry, where the curry acts as a dipping sauce. 

Decor-wise walking in, it is bright orange and definitely brightens my mood! It is a peaceful place to eat, and the employees are absolute darlings! It will definitely become my second home soon. =X hahaha.

Random: A few days ago I chose to bring one of my friends here, and it was the perfect timing because the owner happened to be there! =) He is such a friendly Japanese man who is all SMILES! I got to chat with him a bit and SECRET... he is going to start serving CURRY UDON! That I am freaking excited for! CURRY ON NOODLES?! WHO COULD REFUSE?! - I CAN'T!

So come down to the East, and take a look-see, you will definitely enjoy it! Try the coffee jello, and I will fill you all in when Curry Udon is up on the menu!

If you know Japanese curry and you like it, then you have to give this place a try. They have three levels of spice... Mild, medium and hot. If you are not familiar with their level of spice, you can ask them for a sample to see what level would be good for you.  I got the hot and in the beginning it was just fine but after a couple of spoonfuls,the heat kicked in and sweat started to bead on my lip and I knew I should of got the medium instead. Haha but I enjoyed every last scoop of the curry.  The chicken katsu was a little on the thin side but it was breaded nice and golden brown with  nice white pieces of chicken. 

If you need more rice, you can ask for more (no charge). 

Still hungry?  You can try one of their desserts. They have a coffee twist and orange dream along with green tea or red bean ice cream ($1.39). 

All in all this place rocks and the curry is authentic. The owner Hide is from Tokyo and brings down the Tokyo style to Las Vegas. Thank you Hide San!",ETt5294q4Xm1ZB8EX28Ejw,6,4,5,nCGGDs7VxUvt1AOW0Voe2A

2881147,2014-06-30,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"I visited Oh! Curry today while visiting my grandparents. They live in the east side of town that is heavily Hispanic so food choices tend to be limited to taquerias, fast food, diners and occasional Chinese food, so this curry house was a refreshing surprise.

We walked in and found the restaurant to be spacious and exceedingly clean. The cashier/server was immediately helpful in assisting us and wanted to help us if this had been out first curry experience. She answered all our questions (this being my grandparents first curry experience) and promptly rang is up. 

We got our soft drinks from the dispenser and sat down. We observed and commented on the giant sign on the wall that explained what Japanese curry is to the customer in Spanish, which I think was a smart move on the owners part considering the location of the restaurant.

The food was served quickly on cafeteria trays. The portions are very large so expect to leave very full or take home leftovers. This is usually the case though because rice is essentially half the dish. Dude note, extra rice is free for dine-in. 

We ordered tonkatsu curry, beef curry, fried chicken and French fries. The curry itself is very reminiscent of Golden Curry that you can buy out of a box, but more flavorful with different spices. I'm not usually an avid curry fan, but I really enjoyed this curry. We all got mild because we don't like spicy food. 

The tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) was a little bland as in it needed salt, but otherwise moist and crunchy. The beef was sort of like roast meat, not like stew meat, but it was very tender and flavorful. I didn't try the fried chicken, but was told it was good. The breading is a thicker Japanese style, so don't expect KFC. The fries were amazing! Fresh and crunchy with great flavor. I would go back just for the fries. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and the curry. It's not quite as expensive as sit down restaurant curry (this is fast food curry). It's delicious at the right price (about $7 per dish). They have a rewards card where you buy 8 curry dishes and get one free. They offer delivery within 3 miles for $2 and a minimum $15 purchase (which is very reasonable).

2898855,2014-10-12,4,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"I wonder if this place is named after Sadaharu Oh, because this place knocked it out of the ball park for their Japanese style curry.   Who would have thought that a East side Las Vegas strip center would have a hidden Japanese owned treasure.

If you didn't already know, I love my Japanese style curry, and even was awarded a ROTD for another curry house review in Las Vegas, but for some reason...I kind of like this place a little better.

Even though the past week, I made a pot of Japanese style curry at home, and hammered it, I still had a craving for it this weekend.  So I followed my bookmark, then ventured out this part of town.   Okay, I know what a few of you are thinking, East Las Vegas, and who the heck would come out here?   This is what I believe, some of the best places are located in the hood, for example, Honey Kettle fried chicken in Compton, and some of best tacos in the valley are just up the street from Oh! Curry. 

Walking into Oh! Curry is unlike most of the area, because I was very impressed on how clean this restaurant was, and how friendly the staff made you feel.  The prices was very inexpensive compared to the other curry house in the valley, and their serving size was much larger than the competitors.   My order of the Tonkatsu curry was very good, and Oh! curry had a bolder, but sweeter flavor, and had a smoother milky consistency than Zen.  At $6.99, it was more than enough to make the me happy, and if I wanted more rice it would have been no extra charge for it.   Too bad, I didn't take picture of this dish, because it didn't stand a chance, and there wasn't a grain of rice on the plate.  Good stuff.

I thought of about the Orange dream while first ordering my meal, and why not...I was in bliss with the last dish.  So what the heck, how much calories can jello dessert really have!   Some how, the young lady got me thinking about their other flavor, Coffee!   As soon as the spoon hit this dessert, I was smiling because I haven't had Kanten in ages.  It was good!

Thinking about Oh! Curry, I'm stunned that this place is located so far from most Japanese folks in the Las Vegas valley, but on the other hand, Oh! Curry venturing out of their comfort zone will make anyone a fan of Japan's comfort dishes,  Oh! well, like what the famous saying in the movie, Field of Dream...Build it and they will come!   I have a feeling they will.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,11,4,5,HRfDDRgXXjlaZ0uFM6fXAg
2991825,2014-03-02,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"Oh Curry is a little place across the alley from the Nellis and Stewart Walmart and across Stewart from Ci Ci's Pizza buffet. You can drive by it if you aren't looking for it, which is a pity because it's worth finding, which is why I'm spending so much time telling you where it's at. They are new so don't let the small number of reviews fool you, they're really good! 

First of all the restaurant was spotless. The lady at the counter asked me  if I'd had Japanese curry before and let me try some. She was very friendly and helpful. Japanese curry is a little different from Indian and Asian curries, more like a rich brown gravy.  If you're sensitive to the coconut milk in the other curries try Japanese curry.

I chose the pork tonkatsu which is a breaded and fried pork cutlet with rice and gravy. It was as good as tonkatsu that I've had at other Japanese restaurants for twice the price. I also got a side order of fried chicken. It's small pieces of crispy fried chicken thighs. I paid a little over $10.00 for all of it. In fact, everything at Oh Curry was very reasonable. I look forward to trying other things at the restaurant. I hope that they make  it.",VHNFsnAvK9WGK1qkmm-9jQ,6,1,4,tGZ1yjb5UGLl9xhUo8q1iA

I had never eaten curry before and did not know what to expect.  The place was clean, spacious and the person that took my order was friendly.

No Color whatsoever, but I thought it might  be an advertising mistake that the owner just had to deal with.  I ordered Curry with pork and what came out was 1/2 a plate of white rice on one side,  with the ugliest brown sauce  covering the other half and a fried pork patty (sliced into about 8 slices)  laying on top.

In this sense it sticks out for better or worse among other curries around town but honestly, I love it. The spice levels all are distinguishable even with the texture. The owner, Hide, is such a sweet caring man and you can probably find him working when you go and will go out of his way to make sure you are happy because he cares deeply about his restaurant :) also he gives free rice if you finish it all and I appreciate that!
My recommendation is the chicken cutlet curry with any spice level tbh. Even though it's close to my home I would go out of my way to come here if it were further. I mean I come here like every week along with my best friend since it's also really affordable and we're always broke lol.

Katherine O. was right, this is a diamond in the rough considering it's mainly taquerias and mainstream fast food joints in the area. So I've been wanting to try them since I was assigned to work a location in this area for 3 months. My 3 months was over so I finally decided to have lunch here on my last day. I called ahead of time so it would be ready by the time I got there. When I arrived I still had to wait a minute or two which was fine with me. When it was ready it was in a to-go container and the cashier/expediter explained that the curry sauce gets thick and to add a little bit water after an hour. However, little did she know I was going to eat it right then and there. I had the combination which is half tonkatsu and chicken katsu. The texture was great and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the pork or chicken, so I would get the chicken since it's supposed to be better for you anyway vs. pork. I had the mild curry because I am weak sauce, but it was a good almost thick consistency. I absolutely love it on the rice more so than the chicken/pork because the breading gets a tad bit soggy. I tried the radish on the side, which is a nice crunch but I didn't really taste anything. The inside of this place is very clean and the menu is pretty big with pictures. On the side of the menu there's a explanation of what curry is in Japan, the funny part is there was also a Spanish translation- that's how you know you're on the east side is when there's a Spanish translation even for something Asian. Overall great experience, I probably won't be back because I am never on the side of town, but for all you curry lovers who live here you won't have to travel all the way to China town anymore for your curry fix.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,7,1,4,4GE1__OJ8FfCMi837LjVKw

I can't exactly comment on the ambiance of the restaurant because I ordered my food to go through Eat24 so I just came in and out. From what I saw, it looked like the restaurant was pretty big and spacious. 

The ordering process on Eat24 was pretty simple and when I arrived, I literally just walked in and out because everything was already ready. 

I was going to give it 4 stars because they were going to charge me extra for the pickled radish (and no other curry place in town charges me for it), but the cashier just gave it to me without charge so I am content! 

I ordered the pork Katsu and asked for my curry sauce to be hot. I will say that their curry sauce has a different flavor from the curry houses on spring mountain, but regardless, I still really enjoyed the taste.

After my first visit today is definitely go back. The price is right, the food quality was good, and the place was clean with a nice staff.

You basically pick a meat to go with your curry sauce and rice.

I'm accustomed to eating Japanese curry at home. It's simple and cheap to make. I'd definitely say I know a thing or two about food curry.

They have beef, grilled or fried chicken, veggie, or plain. 

Comes with the meat and comes with white rice and the sauce. You can order sides also.

I believe they all come with the same sauce which has a bit of a spice to it.

First of all the counter girl was awesome. She asked if I was a first timer and also checked with the kitchen for wait times on the orders. I thought that was really cool of her.



Anyways my order was Tonkatsu pork to go.

The girl have me instructions on reheating which I thought was awesome.

The amount of sauce they gave me seemed excessive but when I ate it all with the rice is say it was a food amount. It was served with some pickled ginger on top which was nice.

The sauce itself was good. It had a lot of heat. The heat might even have been a bit much IMO. I would have liked it to have more depth of flavor and less heat but it was still good.

The rice they used was really good. I'd say it is about 1.5-2 cups of white rice. 

The Tonkatsu was perfectly fried and juicy. I'd say it was lacking in the flavor department. It could have used some salt. Again the lightly breaded pork was fried perfectly. Also this isn't pounded like Hawaiian Katsu chicken.

Overall I'd definitely go back.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,11,0,4,m7r57kLAPh-CyxSS77XaGA
4048097,2015-02-06,1,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"Play by play of the restaurant here at Stewart and nellis for oh! Curry.

The person taking our order was very pleasant and cordial. Though, she really doesn't know much about japanese curry, her hospitality and customer service makes up for it.

Ordering the curry, there's only 3 choices for the curry sauce. Regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry powder/blocks. Which in turn, makes me think that their curry sauce aren't homemade recipe unlike cocos ichibanya, or the local contenders, zen curry or kaba curry. But even if that's the case, the curry sauce was pretty good. I opted for hot only because I know the mild is almost like the regular...she let me taste the difference. I would have preferred it between mild and hot, but since that's not a choice, I have to go for hot. The scale for the choices of what they have would be regular (no spice which is 0 on the scale), mild (little spice which would have been a 2 on the scale), and hot (lots of spice which would be a 8.5 on a scale of 1 - 10). I prefer my curry to be right around 5, which would be a medium, so it's spicy but I can still taste the base stock of the curry.

As for the chicken cutlet curry that I ordered, it was nice and good. It was cooked just right. Not too dry but the breading is still nice and crispy. 

Being a newly opened restaurant, relatively, they are doing a card promotion where if you have visited and ordered a curry meal, the tenth meal is free. This would drive some word of mouth, but if they want to have more presence, they need to actively promote the place. 

The only reasons I'm giving oh! Curry a four star are these: 
-Location. I wouldn't have known this place existed if I didn't use the walmart pass through way to get to Stewart...I really don't go to that specific walmart for obvious reasons.
-Menu. They don't have a full japanese curry restaurant menu. 
-Curry sauce options. There's only three choices which I have covered; regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry...which I do cook myself...but instead I use panku breading.

Other than that, this place is a great alternative if you want japanese curry when you're in the east side of town and don't feel like driving all the way to spring mountain for Zen Curry or Kaba Curry...or all the way to California for Coco's Ichibanya.",aLsqrrHPvfJcLIgmf72rfA,3,0,4,fkfXJTz7addgND6pYnKsfw

The chicken cutlet was cut to the perfect thickness and was still very juicy for deep fried.  The batter used was light, NOT greasy and surprisingly still CRISPY (after a 20 minute car ride in a Styrofoam plate).  The curry was phenomenal.  I would say it was flavorful and not overwhelmed with spices (like Indian curry).  Great food! Low Price! Perfect Portion!

Curry"" stood out to me compared to other restaurants in Vegas, not only is it the only of its kind in this area but I've never even heard of Japanese curry until the first day that my boyfriend and I walked in to give it a try. I've tried Thai and Indian curry before, but to be honest I didn't like it so much so of course I was skeptical at first. 
    Believe me when I tell you, I wish I have heard of Japanese curry before because it's absolutely delicious, flavorful, and satisfying; in my eyes it's the perfect comfort food. Not only is the food amazing, so is the service, cleanliness, and the overall quality of the restaurant. I always feel welcomed when I walk in and leave with a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face. The food is authentic Japanese food and I feel like im in a small part of Japan when I eat there, and I can't go a week without eating there because its so good!
     I've also found that on their facebook page they're ALWAYS doing facebook promotions so you can get a discount off of your meal, this is amazing considering how inexpensive it is to dine here in the first place.

Oh! Curry is a restaurant that is new and pretty clean, with a large bench of tables that you could hella throw birthday parties in and a pretty straightforward menu! We visited this location because my friend adores Japanese curry and I just love curry in general; and I was not disappointed. 

Their curry was extremely cheap and pretty good! (I do wish the regular had more spice though lol) The price is legit; they give you a lot of rice, a lot of curry, and a good amount of meat!! They also have some sides: fried chicken, fries, and tonkatsu. These you can buy separately and dip in curry--YUM! 

Also, that jelly dessert is just delicious. I don't even like orange flavored things, but it was great!! And the owner told us that he was adding coffee jelly to the menu and let us taste it--IT WAS BOMB. The man is gonna be known for that coffee jelly, guys. They should really add more jelly flavors to their menu because it's just too good to pass up! 

We didn't order a drink, but soda is 1.29 and bottled water is --under a dollar--. Even at gas stations, that can be rare lol.

5364039,2015-02-06,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,Best authentic Japanese curry I've tasted yet!! No bottle powder canned sauce here. Made from scratch homemade taste. The chicken cutlet and tonkatsu was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right....lightly crispy and moist inside. It may look plain but once you savor the sauce...omg yummy!!,UrQwpHXMWa5dcpUXLIK3cA,4,1,5,-GGKuHGlxy3o-innyc7amg
5367380,2017-06-07,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"So good I forgot to take a photo before devouring my entire plate. Ordered the tonkatsu, chicken cutlet, BBQ pork nuggets, Japanese salad, and the kids meal. The curry!! The curry was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. They also give you a huge serving of the curry so be prepared to eat! I could've just eaten the curry with rice which, by the way, is an option. They will also give you extra rice at no charge so you can soak up all that amazing curry. 

The pork nuggets are covered in a sweet and savory Japanese BBQ sauce and are nice and juicy. It's a must order. Seriously. The Japanese salad was a simple salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and corn but the sesame dressing on it was amazing. Wish they sold bottles of it because I would eat a salad everyday...maybe.  

The folks behind the counter were super friendly and attentive. Made dining here really pleasant. They also have stamp cards so after 8 stamps you get the 9th free. Will be back soon!",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,2,0,5,kKn_olCMqru8xhrxCTKoZQ
5394092,2014-09-08,1,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,Came in at 8:30 PM the service was quick.  ordered ordered two combo curries (half tonkatsu and half katsu) and we got a kids meal free and a coffee gelatin dessert. One of the curries was hot and the other one was mild. In my opinion the hot had more flavor to it plus it was spicier. The curry was very aromatic and flavorful altogether and if you live on the east side and want to try Japanese-style curry or just love curry then this is the spot to go to,SsSSRAiOktBGbF4wWeFe_w,5,1,5,ZcGRcT9IzDY2WdsoGzTm-w

5476690,2018-02-22,0,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"I have had to think about this, I love curries, but this was my first Japanese version. I had the chicken cutlet version with regular sauce.

I'm still thinking as I'm typing, the sauce itself is an interesting flavor combination, I actually think I will end up buying the sauce by itself and add my own proteins. That is not a put down on Oh Curry, but let's face realities, for $6,99 you get a good sized portion, but it's still only $6,99 at that price point it is excellent value, but my first thought after eating it was this sauce would be great as the base for a shrimp curry, but at $6,99 there is no way they could do it..

Anyways, if you are a curry fan swing over and give it a try, it's worth the drive, the food is good and that's what counts in the end.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,0,0,4,9oN1YuAHC0ATuOQLOdr8MA

Over time the curry seems to be water down with what seems to taste like sand. 
The spice levels are inconsistent.
But the service that I have receive has always been flawless.
Until today I guess?
Passive aggressive service. Haha 

The menu up until recently has been out of date with the beef curry still hanging on the back wall though it has been discontinued.
And for the soda machine that only has one to two options available at all times. The cup size has gotten smaller but the price has still stayed the same. 
Although the quality has seem to gone down the price has seem to gone up a bit.",EEroldbqNNjuSf2pZw5kYg,3,2,1,Jkc7Qxp4yrypX3LPeqyO6g

5992317,2016-12-22,13,EvxTD0ETbbFbFjUMWhHbIw,"Yummmmmmmy.  This was the first curry place I tried when I moved to Vegas a few months ago!  You order at the counter and they serve you the food!  It was good and portions were HUGE!  The curry is definitely on the more aromatic and savory side over which really compliments the katsu well.  I ordered the combo with both pork and chicken katsu and that was definitely the way to go for first timers.  I preferred the chicken because of moisture, taste, and texture--in case you're determined to only go with one.  Also add the cheese for an extra 50 cents.  It makes the curry so much creamier.

I've never been to Japan, so I can't vouch for how ""authentic"" it is, but growing up in so-cal, I've been exposed to several curry spots, including chains from Japan.  I wouldn't quite rate it up there with my favorite places (Mitsuwa food court), but it's still good and I'd come back.  Also, when coming here, you guys have to try the coffee jello...such a refreshing, stimulating dessert to help wake you up after such a carbo-loaded food coma inducing meal.

Also, the owner was super nice.  He's helpful and sweet--he even told about what restaurants I should try around the area since there's so limited options in north Vegas.  Definitely coming back again.",p2qFjnQKIZVi7qdj-B31iw,32,23,4,fFNsb2J6OE0KNgyA62gDZg
