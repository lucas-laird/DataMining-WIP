also, the menus are gross, laminated and filthy",vSAKq54eXJ3tJb7iw16uBg,5,0,1,BTRd4ldD8fEZ6AohCkXKyw

Heading out of Las Vegas, I wanted to pick up a pie so my friend and I could munch on it on the way home.  In an effort to save time, we called in the order for a large pie.  The man on the phone said that he would only take the order if we gave a credit card, paying for it on pickup wasn't sufficient.  He was extremely rude but fine, I can understand a business has it's own unique policies. I decided to put in the order and pay cash when I got there.

We were greeted by what was without a doubt the meanest, rudest woman working behind the counter.  We told her we'd like to place an order for a large pie to which she replied that she wouldn't place it until we paid her right there.  WTF?  

I asked her where she thought we would be going - she said, and I quote ""I don't care where you go but you pay me now"".  I told her I don't need to give her any of my money and we left.

The lack of common decency that these people have for another human being is so disappointing.  I will never, NEVER patronize this establishment.  Even if it were the last kosher place to eat in Las Vegas.",iSDU3zaOAXUCZve8KrPGVA,5,0,1,0CTOAro0eUrcxZhPthV6Tw
379153,2014-08-18,1,SRUHJIKqhvKu2BFDTSoPww,"My main complaint here are the prices. The food is nothing special. Walk down to the nearest nondescript Pizza & Wings joint and you can taste the food of Adar Kosher, though not kosher, maybe.

Seeing the bill gave me high blood pressure (not literally, don't really think that!) and a roused the antisemitism Israel is accusing the rest of the world of having. I felt like a real schlemiel paying for this food. Please reconsider the prices and disservice you do to fellow Jewish brethren by charging them an arm and a leg.

I had the unfortunate experience of having their pizza and fries. The food is covered with an unexplainable thick layer of gook that was the cause of painful and dangerous food poisoning. 

The result of eating at that miserable excuse of a pizza joint was a ruined vacation and and a serious case of the runs.

540138,2015-02-02,0,SRUHJIKqhvKu2BFDTSoPww,"I have very few regrets in life, coming here was one of them.  First off, I blame myself for not turning around the moment I walked in but I got caught off guard by the witchy looking waitress.  This place is a dump, and I really mean it when I say a ""dump"".  You would think you're somewhere in the middle east but you're NOT! First thing you'll notice is the ceiling, it looks like a mechanic shop, I was afraid to eat but I said what the hell, it's a Kosher place, they gotta be clean.  Then I noticed the condiments on the table and how discolored they were and seemed like they haven't been refilled in ages.  I started to worry once again but then I looked around and there were other customers so I said what the hell, if they have jewish customers, it has to be safe.  I went ahead and ordered, the pizza arrived quite fast and it tasted OK, but definitely not worth the price.  I was in absolute shock when I saw the bill.  30 dollars for a large pizza with 1.5 toppings and 2 cans of soda!  I couldn't believe it at first, I had to take another look at the menu and realized where I made the mistake.  The way the menu is laid out gives off the impression that the toppings are 99 cents but NO! they're 99 cents for the ""individual"" pizza (whatever that means), the large pizza toppings are 2 dollars each! Oh and the cans of soda, they're 2.50, 2 dollars and 50 cents for a can of soda (WOW!!!!!!!!!).  Oh yeah, there are no meats except for Tuna so don't go in here thinking you're going to get Kosher meats on your pizza, no, just tuna. All in all, 1 star for the decent pizza and -4 stars for the greedy owners.",2XOqkw-8O0ldzXp7ta_Y6g,2,0,1,zgeVixirL8qre6KC4MGUXw
629929,2013-09-02,1,SRUHJIKqhvKu2BFDTSoPww,"If you like horrible service with a frown then why not give this place a try?

Bluntly speaking, this place is a pathetic excuse for a kosher pizza place. The food is ridiculously overpriced and their portions are small. You pay over 30 dollars for a extra large pizza the size of a medium, 9 dollars for garlic bread with a horrid bitter after taste, and the problems don't end there. With the food comes a mean server that gives you horrible service accompanied with a nasty attitude. 

Me and my friends are vacationing in Las Vegas, it's a hot summer day and we're parched and hungry, so we decide to come in. We pay an absurd amount for the food (see above), and when we asked the lady in charge if she could give us some garlic powder she replied with ""I'll do it if I have time."" She didn't seem busy at all and we never got the garlic powder. 

I really don't like to say this but I feel as if the people running this place are racist. It's like if you're not Israeli they don't treat you well. Those that were Israeli got service with a smile while those who weren't faced mean face from a short old lady. 

The restaurant is dirty  (Dusty, oily, and cracked tables) and stinky as well. (Pungent, musky odor)  


When in Vegas come to the little hellhole that's off the strip: Adar's Pizza, a rip-off pizza at a rip-off price!",aiZ2VYm3bMXAAwzkD_Z59A,6,0,1,r2080A2JyNXdkEnGbaCsmQ

I am in Las Vegas from time to time and I have been going to this restaurant for years spanning several owners.  My last trip, I stopped in expecting the usual avergae - good pizza ""joint"" fare -didn't happen.  

Although the proprietress was... homey and friendly, she was more interested in talking on the phone than waiting on me even though I said I was in a rush.  The place was empty and tables dirty and piled with dishes from lunch rush I guess.  The Air conditioning was NOT ON (Vegas can be quite hot) and in general the place was not impressive.  I asked for slices (in a hurry) no slices, I asked what was fast ""everything takes the same time"" so I ordered a fallafel figuring how long could that take...  I watched as the guy in the kitchen made the Israeli salad veg by veg thinking that couldn't possibly be for me... after all I was in a hurry -yeah right.  I had to eat quick (and in the car) on my way to my next customer so I asked for no techina sauce -again, yeah right.  So hurrying to my customer eating at red lights the thing became a soggy mess.

It was WAY overpriced (IMHO) and the place is NOT suitable for a business lunch.

Also, the coup de grace, was ill the rest of the day -yes from the food but decorum prohibits me from relating the details here...

I will not be going back....",CRAL-KHn9Vf4GQUo_gtk9g,4,0,2,JD4EBCN76mAlwtqQg0MHeA

To be completely honest the food doesnt taste like crap.  Its average, and edible.  But the portions are tiny and WAY over priced ($18 for a kids portion size of ""baked ziti!!"") and dealing with the owner is nearly always a nightmare in some capacity or other.

If she got someone else to handle the customers I would upgrade this to three stars and deal with the overcharging (shes near the strip so her rent might be high)...

The kosher competition has stepped up in vegas as there is plenty of competition just a couple minutes further from the strip, and she needs to be down with the times.

4853166,2009-04-22,0,SRUHJIKqhvKu2BFDTSoPww,"I only had soup... I was sick and needed something easy/filling. Bean soup and Falafel. Really tasty. I am not a huge Kosher food (only) fan but, this stuff was really good. Nice attentive friendly staff. 

The atmosphere is pretty sweet, everything and everyone at ease/peace and absolutely content with their orders. The three star review pops up because I only tried two things and it was the only place that I ate ""real"" food while in Vegas. 

Only one problem with this place... the fish is pretty steep. When I go out to eat at a tiny and homey place I am expecting the prices to match. The fish here was like twenty sum-odd bills and they only had three different choices. If I am going to pay $20 on my current budget for Salmon it better be fresh caught and served with something better than french fries. 

This place is called Adar Kosher Pizza and sadly I did not get to try the pizza. Our server (shia pronounced shy) was awesome and has been serving here for years really nice guy and a friend. If you do keep Kosher this place is great and they make everything fresh everyday, ingredients are separated and no meat is featured on the menu.

Oh yea, its also the ONLY kosher pizza in Las Vegas!

Every time my friends and I go to Vegas we stop at Adar on our way home to eat some lunch and pick up food for the road. I have to say the service sucks! My friends and I were the ONLY ones in the restaurant and it still took over 20 minutes for the food to bake. Did they have to churn the milk into cheese?

The people are very friendly though. On my way out I asked to put on tefillin and the guy behind the counter had a pair which he keeps just for customers to use. Thank you!",Gi3EMMfq2PiIYYXKQ79a-Q,1,0,3,wuDUKrzheXPPtasS4_G4hg
