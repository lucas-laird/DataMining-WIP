I had high expectation and felt like this was going to be a great find.  It just went downhill from there.  Slow service, inattentivness.  The dumplings were tasty, nothing else was.  We complained about the hot/sour soup tasting really gross because there was way too much vinegar. The lady was trying to push back saying it's supposed to be sour.  Well yeah we know that, but not disgustingly sour and bad overall taste.  She then tasted it herself, then just said she'd have them fix it for us.  It never tasted really fixed to us.  There was no mention of just comping that item off.

Just back from Shanghai, the name of the restaurant jumped out us. We've driven past several times, but tonight we decided to give it a try, and, wow, what a treat! The service was extremely friendly and attentive and the suggestions turned out to be exquisite. Each dish was better than the last.

We ordered the shanghai dumplings, shanghai pan fried buns, salty rice clay pot, shanghai style stir fry noodle, and ja jeurng meen. Don't order the curry beef stew, it wasn't that good. This place (I'm going out on a limb here) is comparable to food from SF or LA, and may even be cheaper now. Be prepared to wait for food sometimes, especially any type of bun/pastry related food. It's hit or miss, sometimes we had to wait 30 mins for the pan fried buns, one time it was only 5-10 mins. They say they are making it ""fresh"".

Ambience: For a chinese restaurant, this place is nicely decorative and spacious. It has the traditional grand Chinese restaurant feel, like you could hold a banquet here. The furniture is nice and doesn't look like they got jt from a cheap furniture store. The have high ceilings so that's an added plus.

Service: They are friendly and speak English, so what's more to ask for? They also seem to be very attentive and polite, despite how understaffed it looks sometimes.

Parking: It sucks. The restaurant is in an awkward cubby hole. More parking in the back, but requires walking.

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this place as much as I thought I would. The decor itself is very nice, and the hostess was very pleasant. The service once we were seated though, was quite abysmal. I understand that places like this that serve authentic ethnic cuisine might have servers that do not speak English, and I am TOTALLY fine with this. However, there are certain times when it's quite important to have someone on hand who can answer questions, like when we have dietary restrictions for health or other reasons. Unfortunately, this was not the case at this place. Secondly, the dish we ordered (chicken and vegetable hot-pot) while quite tasty was submerged in oil.  No, not coated. Submerged. To the point where we had to wade through the oil to get to the pieces of chicken. Also, the bite-sized chicken pieces had little pieces of bone fragments in them. Perhaps this was how this dish was meant to be cooked, and I could tell it was authentic, but I will frequent the other authentic Shangai restaurants on Spring Mountain in lieu of this place.",ipRSbIX43AbLMKz-SL98Qw,0,0,3,5ZuAMmmoZNDxmjOtWoETXg

I ordered the duck in brown sauce, Soup dumplings, spicy stirfry eggplant, and kung pao shrimp.

The duck in brown sauce was beyond gross. It came out with a ton of fat on it in a black disgusting sauce. One bite was all it took for me to gag and spit it out.

On to the eggplant drenched in chili oil. The half cooked eggplant was drenched in chili oil. Don't order this unless you want to drink oil.

The soup dumpling had a strong oder flavor stuffed inside a broken up dumpling wrapper. The meat wasn't fresh since all I tasted was bad smelly meat. 

As for the kung pao shrimp that they charge $20 bucks for was served with a ton of veggies. More than 90% of the dish was full of green pepper and onions. This dish litteraly had 5shrimp in it. Wtf who serves kung pao shrimp with a total of 5 shrimp in it.

They charge $2 for a bowl of dried up hard rice. All together this came out $80 something bucks. $30 bucks for that dish of cold tar looking duck. Once again yuck! Run!!!",rhXZfgmNjO7ITTcxq9n_5A,3,0,1,vkZFAR7xPSSakM6EhzAcEA

Very quiet at lunch time - only 3 tables.  But Chinese customers were loud - their chit chat sounded like yelling across the Grand Canyon.

Typical old style interior decorations.  Menu is thick and full of colorful pictures but the food we ordered is TOTALLY DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

1.  Wine chicken is blend;  it tastes like wine was put in after you ordered.

2.  Shanghai style smoked fish is horrible.  It is simply roasted to char.  100% not authentic Shanghai style smoked fish; and 100% different look than on the menu.

3.  Stir fry Shanghai noodles is blend and oily;  no stir fry taste at all.  It seems like they just mix the noodles, veggies and meat together.

4.  Eel in the noodles soup is absolutely tasteless!

On a recent trip to LV (Feb.23) we wanted to get out of the busy tourist area and decided to visit Chinatown for lunch. Had no idea where to stop, just drove looking for the right place to pop up. We pulled over to gas up and behind the station noticed Bund Shanghai and decided to try it.
What a nice surprise. Don't let the meek outside entrance hold you back. You will say Wow when you get in and are greeted so friendly. A very nice interior, amazing menu, excellent service, very clean and the food is prepared to order fresh and hot.
We ordered the Shredded Pork and Salted Fish. Each item is served with delicious soup and steamed rice. $6.99. The fish was so good and the pork was stir fried to perfection.
Our server was so attentive and I shared with him upon the arrival of our check that I will definitely write a review. He was so gracious and kind.

We missed our old buddy Restaurant, 1900 on Spring Mountain Rd which was closed and decided to venture out for a new Shanghainese restaurant. There are 6 of us, 4 adults are all familiar with Shanghainese food like XLB, drunken chicken etc..We are not looking for the delicious Shanghainese cuisine in Shanghai or Taipei, we just want to have a decent meal of Shanghai style.

I was quite impressed by the ambience and all the elaborate and appetising pictures on the manual, but unfortunately that were all they are good at.

The XLB has strong porky odor to it and there was no soup inside the wrapping. All the cold appetizers like jelly fish, drunk chicken, 3-yellow chicken, bean with Tofu paper are completely different in their look compared to that of the pictures, they must have been in the fridge for days. The chicken were chewy, not tender as one would expect. The jelly fish was very salty.

Of the 4 entries, the fish belly in soy sauce was barely deserve a passing score. But it was not belly at all, it was entire fish without the head. All the others were just put together by an amateurish hands. Shanghainese food are known for their harmonious blending of the soy sauce, wine,oil,sugar together with various food content in hot temperature the bring out distinctive flavor and taste, here in our mouths they are completely disintegrated, let alone taste good.

The service was slow and disorganized. One can easily notice the short staff help. And I wondered what might happen in the kitchen. The last dish, the eggplant stew was waited for 15 min after we finished all the food before it appeared on our table. Waiting for the bill to be calculated was another 15 min wait.

All the glasswares pile up on their bar table to be distributed for take out or for serving drinks. That table is supposed for sitting and for show since they do have liquor licence. The bathroom ran out of soap liquid and the hand dryer broke...

I hope they just had a bad day with the chief chef on leave and we just happened to be there on the occasion. I sincerely hope they can improve in the future.",CFuXI-XECP6U-tNMYmFIbQ,0,0,1,dKa7tVCRCPYcGiUlsp0BXQ

1) If your price is higher than the average chinese restaurant then you need to make it in bigger portion. I realized that they have been cutting down on the portion recently and they are not consistent every time we order.
2) If you want to be competitive, you got to offer free soup either for lunch and/or for dinner. I am not talking about egg drop or sweet and sour soup, I am talking about the authentic chinese soup and they should be different everyday like what other restaurants do.
3) We are seriously tired of the green bean dessert. It has no taste at all. Desserts are supposed to be different everyday. Please learn from other restaurants. 

Unless you welcome only people from Shanghai, you need to change the way you do business so you get more customers. If you consider yourself a premium restaurant, please act like one. Don't be stingy on the portion and little stuff like soups and desserts. Those raw foods are cheap! You need to come up with new ideas!

My first visit was for dinner with some family. 

Golden Sesame Cake - its like a baked sesame bread, slightly sweet. It was a great pairing with the braised pork shank :D picked up the sauce well and nice to put meat in between the cake too ! 

Braised Pork Shank - large pork shank braised to a fork tenderness. A bit salty to eat alone but as i had mentioned previously, it was delicious to be eaten with either the golden sesame cake, or white rice. Comes out whole on a large plate. Great ""huge"" presentation. meat was super tender. great for family dinners. 

Beef Pan Fried Bun - completely different from what i expected. Thought it was going to be the same, in terms of flavor and seasoning as the pork version but the beef version, its seasoned much differently. more of a black pepper seasoning?

Then my most recent second visit for lunch, because we've heard quite a few good things about this place. There seemed to be a huge party going on in the main dining room so we were seated in the room towards the front. Slight lack of air circulation. 

Sweet Hot Soy Milk - First item to arrive. Normally a fresh soy milk is a nice white color, maybe a very slight beige. For some odd reason, this was a grey-ish color. Didn't seem like it was a bad batch. Not sure the reason for the color. I've made plenty fresh soy milk and never been that color. Didn't taste bad? It was a bit sweet, for me, but for my friend... she said it was good. 

Chinese Donut - hot, fresh out of the fryer. Crispy and light. Not the best ive had but pretty good. Lighter than the better versions ive had but pretty good. Easily the best thing of the meal.... surprisingly/unfortunately D: 

Green Onion Pancake - THIS... WAS WEIRD... why is the pancake SUPER CRISPY and FRIED?! ALL the other versions ive had, were all lightly heated and soft. This... had no soft spots... it was crispy all the way through ! ! what the heck ... yeah this was only partially eaten.. didnt even take it to go because i didn't know how to re-heat it, esp since its already so hard... it will get harder (lol...) 

Xiao Long Bao - THIS... was disappointing. We came here for lunch. There was a lunch special for it. 5.95 per order. So we had two orders. Each order has 8 dumplings. First order? ALL had a hole in it. No soup. Second order? All but 2 were popped. From the texture of the dumplings, it seemed like they were OVER-steamed to the point where they popped. The meat, lack of ""bite"". Too soft/mushy? The ONLY good side to this, was the waiter said our orders were come one after another. to stay hot. that was a good gesture. but thats about it for this. 

Service in the beginning was decent. Then after we had gotten our foods, the servers were no where to be found. I had to walk out to the main room to find someone to bring us our check. After that, i just gave up and took the check to the front to pay. Customer attention, not their strong suit. But apparently, not their food either. Super sad.

The glutinous new year noodle and house style noodle were ok but again at family cooking level. Their green onion pancakes were made without repeated kneading to achieve the multilayered effect. They were baked bread with green onions in it. Their pan fried steamed buns were not steamed. Just fried baked buns with little taste. Last but not least the other reviews stating their management's mishandling of bills were sadly true. We ordered soy milk to go with the crullers but it never came after we finished ALL our foods.

You'll miss this spot if you don't pay attention. It seems more like a business office being located right next to a gas station. Inside though is entirely a different story. It has a grwat atmosphere for a chinese restaurant. Seems to be more classy than a typical chinese restaurant. Great furniture and several large TVs set around with chinese decorations. This is what a chinese restaurant should look like, which reminds me of family when I went here. This place most likely is set for large groups or family as there are many large tables. The menu comes with many pictures that go along what the dishes look like. They have some high end dishes that you can order as well. The food here is good. Though, the 'Hot and Sour Soup' did not suit my taste. I felt that this soup consists of too much black pepper or something was wrong as I did not find it to be any good. Then, the bean soup dessert at the end was not any good either. Usually at other chinese restaurants they serve it as hot, but this restaurant serves it cold which I felt it was not fresh or spectacular.

The food was lovely to look at and really well done. Unlike many restaurants in town which have ""cooks"", it is clear this kitchen has ""chefs"" trained to deliver food piping hot and absolutely delicious. 

All the dishes we tried were really good and I am excited to go back and try more of their menu items. I have had better soup dumplings elsewhere but they rank highly as better than normal soup dumplings. The nice thing was that the dumplings actually had the soup in them rather than leaking out while they were cooked. The crab soup dumpling I thought was better than their pork soup dumplings.

So, in my honest, shanghainese opinion, this is the best place to get sheng jian bao in Las Vegas. Most places don't fry the bao long enough or quite right so the dough is still raw. This place fries the outside perfectly and you can see the burnt yumminess on the bottom of the bao. The top is glistening with a few sesame seeds. These baos won't explode in your face once you bite into them, but they will ooze out delicious soup. The texture and the taste of the pork is done quite well and the ratio of meat to doughy skin is good too. 

Other stuff I recommend are the shanghainese small won tons, drink chicken, lamb chops, and pork thigh.

The place is a little pricey but honestly, this place is authentic or as close to authentic as you can get to Shanghainese food in Vegas. Service was very attentive for us (maybe because we're shanghainese?) lol. Oh, and park is a hassle. Gotta get lucky with that!",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,4,4,5,0Q7T3c_tgm_0J6IvIdA7og

Didn't stop us from going.  Noodles and dumplings are a major weakness of mine, so upon finding out that this new place served juicy pork dumplings/xiao long bao, we were there.  Service was friendly for even American standards, and they even checked in on us a few times and asked why didn't finish our onion pancakes (more on that later).

I was jonesing for some fresh soy milk, but they had ran out of it.  Oh well, stick with good ol' cleansing hot tea.  On to the food!

1.  Thick Fried Noodles - Chewy noodles, essence of wok hei and savory flavors of soy sauce.  This seemed more like a Ameri-nese (a la Panda Express), but adding in some vinegar and hot sauce, we were happily slurping all the noodles.
2.  Onion Pancakes - We enjoyed the overall crispiness, but what was lacking was more flaky layers.  Concerned, they asked us why we did not finish the pancakes, we had to lie that we were too full to eat it, but truly, even if we were full, our gluttonous selves would have made room had it been more flaky.
3.  Xiao Long Bao/Juicy Pork Dumplings - Clear, flavorful juice, thin chewy skin.  Impressive for the Las Vegas area.  As always, we must compare to famous Din Tai Fung, the skin wasn't as thin an membranous and the volume of broth was less voluminous.

Conclusion:  For the Las Vegas area, it's certainly not the best, but this will do for my XLB cravings.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,7,3,3,1tuvEZyYFAuOez33zTXEvw

On the good side,  they tout no MSG on their menu (3) service: very good and nice ambience ; the servers speak fluent English and they feature nicely laminated picture menus (4) value: a bit pricey some items,  this place is okay in my book (3).

We stopped by to check out their pan-fried pork buns. 

I was impressed by their extensive picture menus and we ordered a little more than what we thought we were going to because of it. No MSG is a major plus. We tried their hot and sour soup, veggie goose, stir-fried green beans and pan-fried pork buns. 

We started off with the veggie goose. The marinated flavors of the ""old"" soy sauce (sweet soy sauce steeped with star anise,  peppercorns and usually a bit of dried mandarin peel) came through. The only thing was it lacked sufficient fillings (usually bamboo shoot carrot and mushrooms) to provide sufficient textural complexity. Still a decent dish and one I would order again. 

The pan-fried pork buns were alright in my books. Honestly,  the pork inside had a bit too much filler (corn starch) as the texture of the meat was slightly too mushy. The flavor was okay but the bun to meat ratio was off (too much bun,  not enough meat). 

Hot and sour soup is a pass for me.  There was no meat in the soup which rendered it rather bland.  Top it off with not enough white pepper and vinegar,  the soup was not really hot or sour at all. 

Stir-fried green beans were okay. The brown sauce (tasted like chu-hou sauce) was overly sweet for this dish. Although the skins of the beans were nicely blistered,  it needed a bit more wok-hai to really sear in the flavor. 

Service for a Chinese restaurant was great. Our water glasses were always filled and we got chili oil, extra vinegar without too much fuss. The server spoke fluent English which is good for those who do not speak Mandarin. 

Overall,  despite the flaws in the cuisine, the extensive menu and excellent service is enough to lure me back to try some of their other dishes.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,3,vloFW80qVxzw6e59_ojZMQ

The fish tasted like 1000 years old and had no favor in it. We complained about that and the waitress said because we didn't order the expensive live fish. So that's how it tastes like. But the fish dish already cost 20 dollar and that's how it taste like?

Peking Duck-

Hot and Sour Soup-

Fried XLB-
These are my favorite, but there are times that it's filled with soup and other times the soup gets soaked up by the bread. So it's not always consistent.
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs-
These little candied rib bits were delisious, they're lacquered in this sugary sweet candy coating and flavored with tangy black vinegar. 
Honey walnut shrimp-
It's tastes similar to everyone's recipe, nothing really stand out.
Corn pancakes- 
It tastes like crispy canned cream corn. So you decided if you like that flavor then you're more than welcome to order it. Lol

Dim sum isn't really our thing, but I personally can never pass up pork dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) or Pan Fried Dumplings (Shen Jian Man Tou).

On this night we thought we would try it again, we found out they have only been open for 2 weeks!  So the night we stopped by they were still training.  He was so excited he could barely contain himself, we walk in to a large 2 story room filled with Asians always a good sign for a shanghais style restaurant!  I was as usual the only white person and we were probably the only one language couple in the place and that one language not being Mandarin or Shanghainese.  We were really looking forward to this!

1.  Cabbage in Chefs special sauce $8.50 cooked cabbage in a thick broth of sorts.  Was my favorite of the night the sauce was so good I did add the cabbage with a healthy portion of sauce to my rice and enjoyed over and over again.  5stars
2.  Xiao Long Bao $7.50 Oh boy were we excited to see this one if you have read my earlier reviews you will know I am a critic after having the real thing in Shanghai.  These are homemade however the dumpling wrapper is to thick and over powers the actually goodness inside (not much soup) but with that said if you're new to them you will not break them but eat them right away.  2 stars

4.  Waitress recommendation Curry Sirloin in clay pot $12.50.  The meat was nice well done but the sauce was watered down and nill to none as far as the sauce goes it was filled however with boiled radish that took on the flavor of the curry but just didn't cut it for me.  I felt for that price more meat should have been added.  2 stars 
We did add sides of rice they do not have brown rice.

2 of the 4 items ordered were our choice the other 2 were the waitresses.  We felt her choices were a watered down version of other places we have been to in town nothing to come back for.

If you don't believe me, go ahead and do a taste test - order a XLB here and immediately walk over to 3 Villages (same plaza as Veggie House and Island Malaysia - upstairs)",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,7,1,3,iSpUnYjKMqFAnQTVQqSi1A

The food is still the same from my previous review, still good. However, I'm not coming here again due to service. 

I believe their staff changed or something. We came on Christmas day to have lunch and only half the tables were filled. Plenty of tables on Christmas day suspicious yes? 

I had a bad feeling once I had to ask for a table away from the door twice, it was a cold afternoon. (I believe it was the boss sitting us too). 

When we decided to order, we wanted to order first for my family as they were running a tad late. The server had the nerve to tell us that the orders will get all messed up if we order now and then add more later. You've been an established business for how long now and you're still having problems with kitchen organization?

We ordered the pan fried wontons. My mom wanted to add another order of that so she asked for that but the server added the wrong item and it came out with steamed wontons which isn't what we ordered. We did get one order of the fried wontons. However, the server came and told my mom that's what she ordered and we know that's not what she ordered. 

My mom being a server herself didn't want to cause trouble and just said its fine we'll keep it. Regardless, I didn't like how that guy treated my mom by pointing at her and saying she ordered when we know she didn't. The other server thought it was funny too. Absolutely rude.

Don't come here. Get your XLB at other Chinese establishments that taste the same if not better and better service.",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,3,2,1,ZmIVK9997sHp0Nq7FEeqkA

Ah, the great adventures in dining! I have to say the thing I didn't quite appreciate was the service. We are not Asian, and it felt like we were being treated like the red headed step children. After we placed our orders, we got our food and that was it. We didn't even have anyone come by to refill our drinks, nor ask if we needed anything else. We had to go out of our way to wave down waiters. I hate to say this but I did notice that others that were dining...who were Asian getting lots of attention. Maybe it was just our waitress that sucked. I don't know...but it was annoying. Bad service lowers the rating of this place for me. The food as I stated earlier was great quality and very tasteful.

They have a beautiful menu with some quality dishes that WAS good but, quality just deteriorated drastically.  I used to come here a lot but when it got worse I stopped coming here. After about 4 months of absence, I decided to give it another chance. My experience today was a 1 star quality. They hired inexperienced waiter who is old and very slow in his work. He would ignore me when I wanted to ask for more water. He is just overwhelmed with about only three tables to serve. When the dishes come out, he would ask me to make room for him. I might as well go to the kitchen and get my own dishes. 
Now, about the food, prices went up and quality and quantity went down. I always get the pan fried buns when I am here. I know the size of the buns are half the size of what it was a year ago.  Also I ordered fried chicken that is $15.99 for part of a pigeon sized chicken. It is refried and not fresh. No meat on the bird for that price. That really upsets me. How can a decent restaurant serve such quality of food?

The food:
-sweet and sour spare ribs. Seriously where were the meat in this? All you got was bone and fat...and the sauce was way too vinegary. 
-fried yellow fish: mini pan fried fishes... crispy yes, salty? yes...way too salty. Any other flavors that redeemed the dish? NO, not at all. For like $12 you got 6 pieces of fish.. really not worth it
-stir fried veggies assortment: There were celery, carrots, bamboo sprouts, button mushrooms, and this one root vegetable. This was good..but you really can't mess up a stir fry. Nothing spectacular though. Definitely some I can recreate for a lot less at home.
-Stir Fry noodles: Specialty! according to the staff.. umm yea no. Basically thick udon noodles cooked with cabbage and dressed with LOTS of soy sauce.. common people
-pan friend veggie rice cake: This dish was good. Lots of shanghainese food includes some assortment of rice cakes.. This was actually good, that is until we found a big long piece of hair in it. YEA....

All in all the experience was quite horrible. Upon telling the waitress that we found hair in our food she just stood there looking confused. Took our credit card and said nothing else... REALLY??????? No apologies nothing? Give me a break. My mother was so furious that she didn't even want to stay to complain. We just walked out.

Really would NEVER visit this place again. The funny thing is upon us leaving the restaurant another party was complaining about how bad their experience were as well. Apparently they were served RAW pork and chicken. That is a big no no no no. Also, they received very bad service and had to get up and ask just to have their tea kettle refilled with water. 

I give them props for having such a nice decor and making their menu look very appetizing, but really, this place is a disgrace to Shanghai style food. I would not recommend it to anyone.

3876011,2016-11-30,2,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"I've always groaned at the prospect of any good authentic Chinese food in Vegas. One of the nurses at work recommended this place for decent xiao long baos (soup dumplings). To my knowledge, there's only a few places that you can get these in town (excluding casinos), the other being China Mama. I must say that the xiao long baos here are probably the best in Las Vegas (albeit, that's not saying much). The soup was pipping hot, the meat was juicy, and the dumpling skin was great. Strangely, I'm not sure if the mentions have changed, but they no longer offered the daily lunch special menu.

Other dim sum items we tried were the pan fried pork buns, the hot and sour soup, and the Shanghai chow mein. I actually did not like the sesame seeds on the bottom of the pan fried buns. I didn't like the texture of the buns, and they were more chewy than crispy on the bottom. My girlfriend really did not like the hot and sour soup. She described the aftertaste as ""cardboard."" They used way too much white pepper, which over powered the rice vinegar aspect of the soup. Too much hot, not enough sour. Although there were plenty of bamboo shoots and mushrooms, I could not get past the lingering bitter aftertaste. The chow mein is one of their more popular dishes and I would tend to agree. I enjoyed the stir-fry flavor and the chewiness of the noodle. I wish there was more meat thrown in instead of all that cabbage. 

Overall, if you're looking for some authentic Shanghainese food, this might be one of the only places in town to get it. While it's located in a very sketchy and small plaza, they decorated the interior quite nicely. It looks like it could fit huge groups of people, but it was very empty on Sunday. The rest of the menu would cater well to large family-style dinners.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,3,3,3,OesoZh_QtEUEudZUEJcxcQ

One of our group had been here and she liked it very much.  She arranged the lunch ahead of time.  Since she's from Taiwan, there is never a language problem when we're with her in Chinatown.

For lunch, the 10 of us shared these Shanghai style dim sum selections: soup dumplings (XLB),  crab and pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef fried buns, pot stickers, spicy won ton, rice cake stir fry with pork and cabbage, Shanghai fried thin noodles, red bean pan cake, and eight treasure rice pudding.

All of us liked the food very much.  I found the XLB to be a bit bland.  My favorite was the Shanghai fried noodles.  I'd go back just for that.

Service was excellent.  Shirley spoke with the staff for the most part, but the hostess and one of the servers had great English so we'd be OK if we went without Shirley.

The restaurant is very nicely appointed.  It's not very large but can hold several large parties like ours at their large round tables.  The parking lot is very, very small!

I have to come back and try this for a regular dinner, not just dim sum, to get a better feel for the dishes.  But, this was a very good lunch!

I don't understand the Chinese music that's playing in the background, but it appease and adds to the ambience they are going for. 

The service is great, very attentive without being too suffocating.

The food, it's great. I've only have soup dumplings over at China Mama, and I have to say, the soup dumplings here and Bund Shanghai is better. Better tasting soup, filled with a little bit more meat...and the wrap does not break easily when you pick it up, but it does when you need it to let off the steam.

Also ordered the beef noodle soup long with the soup dumplings,  the beef is so tender that it just melted as soon as it touched my tongue. The soup base itself is great. Not too strong,  but strong enough to go perfectly with the noodles. 

Only downside was the drinks....wasn't enough. I love Thai tea and I know already that they don't do refills. What sucks is the glass container they put the Thai tea in is a little small. Thing is, I always ask if they would do refills....and one restaurant here in vegas does do refills on Thai tea.

4365617,2016-02-11,0,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"Misleading name. This place, although it is called Bund _Shanghai_, has an extensive menu that is far more Cantonese banquet style, so maybe this was the wrong place to try Shanghainese dumplings. When it's the two of us, though, I am always hesitant to get Canto seafood dishes because I know we won't be able to finish them by ourselves, especially while traveling and we can't keep or reheat leftovers in our hotel room, or even at home because seafood does not reheat well.

Anyway, we tried the xiao long bao and the san jin bao and both were waaay too sweet, and not enough meat, especially in the san jin bao, which were way too thick, even for me. The meat was concave because the bao was so thick it rose up into the interior cavity and made little bready mounds inside. I also found it strange how fully half of the bao was rolled in white sesame seeds. They were then fried to a crisp on that side, making them too hard and crunchy for me. I cut the roof of my mouth trying to bite into this.

The potstickers were slightly better but had a weird flavor profile, not bad, but not what I was expecting. Okay but wouldn't bother getting again.

We should have tried the traditional Shanghai style chow nin go (stir fried rice cakes) to see how they measured up since we're probably never going to go back, but the DH was intrigued by the pork loin rice cakes. These were probably the best thing we had, but still a bit on the sweeter side. The rice cakes themselves were nicely chewy.

The owner(?) was very friendly and he and the staff were probably the highlight of our visit, wishing us a happy new year, asking us to come back soon, and complimenting my hat and chicken purse (aka henbag). (The service was good by authentic Asian restaurant standards; don't get your hopes up - we still had to flag someone down every time we wanted something.)

For the guy claiming reverse racism: was it possible the crab dish you ordered was dungeness crab? That is a very expensive, seasonal ingredient that needs to be flown in. A similar dish in San Francisco would be $60 as well. If money is an issue, the price needs to be inquired after before ordering any ""market price"" dish, and prices on the rest of the menu can't be used as a litmus test for how expensive anything labeled MP might be.

For the girl complaining about not being able to put in staggered orders, that is common at a lot of even high end restaurants and doesn't indicate a disorganized kitchen or inexperienced staff. I think it would have been reasonable to order for the whole table before the rest of your party arrived, if they weren't going to order anything else, and I also think it would have been reasonable for the restaurant to ask that the whole party be present before being seated, so I think it was a fair compromise and could have been much worse.

Why do so many people kick a restaurant they are regulars at to the curb after a _single_ bad experience? One bad experience in ten visits is still a 90% positive track record.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,1,0,2,YlqYH5HP6mGVgezOl9vpLw

My first impression of BS was how nice and clean this establishment is...no funky odors or dirty smells from unsanitary conditions found in some Chinese restaurants. The decor was very nice and we sat at one of the cute booths. The place settings are very pristine and made me excited to enjoy a meal here.
We ordered some pan fried dumplings which S recommended, stir fried noodles and some har gow shrimp dumplings.

I don't remember the name of the stir fried noodles we had and I don't see them on the online menu here, but they were very good. I posted a picture that looks exactly like it does on their current menu. The noodles had the right chew (like al dente spaghetti) with a very light brown sauce and what seemed like minced mushrooms, maybe a little pork mixed in with julienned cucumbers. It was light and delicious.
The har gow was ok...not much flavor but ok.

The deep fried dumplings had a unique texture combination of steamed doughy dumpling and lightly pan fried bottoms, accented with black sesame seeds and minced green onions on top. The filling wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, and even S agreed they weren't as good as usual...possibly attributed to the recent change in chefs. But they were fun to eat with a little chili sauce to enhance it.

The owners seems to know the regulars and S was treated well as one of them. We got to enjoy a special complimentary jelly-like dessert with pieces of squash that S called the ""inexpensive version of bird's nest soup"", and the owner claimed to be ""good for our skin"".

4460196,2016-11-28,0,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"My immediate and extended family were here 3 nights ago.  We were a party of 14, consisting of 4 smaller families.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food of this place.  My immediate family and I love Shanghai food, but it's really hard to find good Shanghai food in the Phoenix area where we live, so we were looking forward to this food, which we call a fat noodle place.

I called earlier in the day (this was Thanksgiving Day) for a reservation of 18, but one of my brothers and his family chose not to attend, so it was just the 14 of us.  We were in a more private area, which was great, away from noise.  This restaurant wasn't super busy.  And it's in the Asian district.  The locale was a bit on the seedy side and I was hoping that as we parked our car behind the restaurant that they wouldn't be broken into or messed with.  Their sign needs some maintenance outside as I believe some of it was burned out.

Let's see if I can remember all the things we ordered.  We had 2 large tables for our party.  The table I was at ordered 2 Shanghai Thick Noodles, Beef Soup, Rice Noodles with Pork & Veggies, Sizzling Beef, Pepper Beef Short Ribs with Onions, Steamed Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Spicy Green Beans, Dry Pan Fried Dumplings.

All the food tasted pretty good.  My favorite were the Shanghai Thick Noodles, Spicy Green Beans and Rice Noodles.  

Why did I rate it a 4 star instead of 5 star?  It's because the plates were not consistent in what they served.  Our other table ordered some of the same things we did and they got different portions.  The Xiao Long Bao was good, but it could have been juicier and there was too much of the skin, but if you've never had this before, then it should be fine.

I didn't really care for the Dried, Pan Fried version of the Dumpling only because it didn't appeal to me as much, but it still tasted alright.  We also wanted to order Onion Cake, but they were out and it was too late in the day to make this as this is a time intensive dish.

The service was really good and the waiter/server was incredibly nice, friendly, accommodating and had a sense of humor.  This does not seem typical Chinese, at least from my experience.  So I give him a 5 star for service.  4 star is for inconsistent portions, maybe safety issues with parking your vehicles, and the food is good but not over the top.

I am happy to say that the food was NOT overly greasy, so that is a HUGE plus.  When we are back in Vegas, we'll be back.",53JHz4dbMg9JfuzakOZK4A,0,0,4,n31-29KbVmsDPoklVKLjAg

4750694,2016-04-25,1,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"I've known about this place when it opened but did not go try it out. My cousin said it was average and my friend said it had good xiao long bao. My friend is from Shanghai and travels around Asia eating. Why he doesn't weigh a ton I have no idea. So I took his advice. I think the XLB is about the same as Dumpling King. The place is very clean and has a nice modern yet classic Chinese look to it. It looks like it is 2 stories from the outside but it isn't. Parking is limited to 5 cars in the front as the beauty shop marked the rest, literally. Maybe he was a beauty school dropout who decided to be the supplier if he couldn't cut and so zealously guards his parking spots with a lawn chair and hair blower. Whatever the reason, the parking is very limited. There's a few spaces next to the alley and in the back.

The menus are really big and perfect for people like me. It has pictures of every dish. The restroom is really clean too. It's probably the nicest one in C-town.

Even though the restaurant is named Shanghai and their cuisine is supposed to be based off there, I heard Cantonese in the background so I assume it's Cantonese owners. I was pretty sure after I noticed I could understand the Cantonese music in the background. Cantonese making Shanghai cuisine? Abomination you say. Not really, the best Louisiana shrimp/crayfish is by Vietnamese owners around the corner.

We ordered the Shanghai noodles and it was made fresh. It was chewy and had a nice texture and flavor to it. Small bits of Napa cabbage and shredded pork complete the dish. It is tasty but it has quite a bit of oil. Chinese cuisine usually begins with a flaming hot wok and hot oil.

While XLB were complete and were not torn or leaky, it's not as plump as the standard, Joe's in Manhattan Chinatown. Those puppies there are bursting with soup inside. They gave us clean little porcelain bowls to eat the XLB with which was a nice touch. It was not necessary as the soup was not overflowing from the little baos. Likewise, the vinegar dipping sauce is not needed either. We ordered the pork and crab ones. I could not tell the crab was in the bao but my better half said she tasted the Dungeness crab. I'd go with the better half's palate :I 

To top off the meal we ordered the sticky rice dessert which was a ""Jung"" composed of white sticky rice with a red bean paste filling, all drizzled in a bed of sugary syrup composed of pieces of dates, wolf berry (goji), and other odds and ends. Dates and gojiberry are basic ingredients in any ""health"" dish, prescribed by the local Chinese apothecary. Have infertility? Dates and gojiberry. Weak stomach? Dates and gojiberry. Hair loss? Dates and gojiberry. Too short? Timberland hiking boots. :) Basically, dates and gojiberry are to Chinese what ginkgo biloba and echinacea are to naturopathy. The dish was made with a connection to authentic Chinese ingredients.

The words coming out of my mouth as much as they did in any Jackie Chan movie, incongruous, is that the sticky rice was good but it is a meal on itself almost. Actually, it is a meal in itself because my mom makes them and gives them to me for lunch or snacks. They usually come wrapped in bamboo leaves and stuffed with pork, salted egg yolk, sausage, mushrooms, and dried shrimp. The sweet version is dark colored green, less dense, and has a rich red bean paste filling, which I normally pass on since I am not fond of sweets. So, Would I get this dessert again? Probably not but you should try it if you have never had it before. I think they should have made the sticky rice more gelatinous to make it more dessert like.

The rest of the menu had items like jelly fish, 
Peking duck, soy sauce roasted chicken, and the fancy sea cucumber...Chinese delicacies sure to leave any American with a Charlie Brown grimace. Sounds worse then they are, I used to hate them as a kid but now I like them.

The place is very nice. The servers friendly and checked up on us. On the way out I took a closer look at the pics of local ""celebrities"" who had eaten here. Mike Tyson came (probably because he had a cameo in the latest Ip Man 3 movie, check it out if you want to see Mike speak Chinese) along with some other celebs?",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,1,2,4,mChlfrLM2lOU669r7vaStA

You know, I really should be ashamed of myself.

You see, I go out to restaurants a lot. Way too much for my limited ""income"" bracket. I end up spending virtually every penny I have doing stuff, like dining out. But one of the perks of dining out a lot is that I get, I think, a fairly good perspective of the quality of the restaurants where I live or (now very rarely) travel.

The past months, since my last Yelp review, there have been some really great ones in my life, and a few so-so's. Las Vegas rarely presents me a ""bad"" one, thankfully. (But why do I always end up reviewing those? A desire to help others?) Sometimes I take pictures, sometimes I take notes, but I never seem to make enough time to post my reviews on Yelp. (Most of the time they end up on the Facebook of my spouse.)

Shame on me. And I apologize.

Well, this time it was a very good one.

We arrived at Bund Shanghai to a HUGE room, virtually empty. There was a 10-top, complete with lazy susan, filled with folks, and a couple sitting off to the side in a booth. That was it. And all were Asians. And then there was us. The waitress handed us three menus, but one was obviously for ""non-Asians"", as it had very typical Chinese items, such as kung pao shrimp (and did I actually see egg foo yung?), on a small summarized quickly-put-together menu. We thought it was rather amusing. We set that menu aside immediately, noticing that it was a redundant subset of the other two menus anyway, and started on the regular menus. 

There's a section within the larger, very graphic and beautiful main menu in which the dishes are very, very expensive (hundreds of dollars, I kid not) and no English is used to describe them, but we could tell from experience they were things such as shark fin and abalone. We were there with our cheap-o Groupon coupon, so those were obviously out for us. (We've had shark fin before, a very long time ago, we didn't think it was ""all that"", and would never order it now, considering the damage the harvesting of fins has caused to the shark population.) Perusing, we got very excited to see the Shanghai dishes, because, idiots that we are, we never tried to seek out the various regional cuisines of China while in Los Angeles, where we lived most of our lives. So that's where we focused, when ordering.

We ordered 4 dishes all at once, a mistake we invariably make every time in restaurants such as these. I suggest you order 1 or 2 at a time, as they come almost instantly, and in our case out of sequence. (The dumplings came out second, but that was fine.)

Soup dumplings: Eight in all. I've had soup dumplings in Las Vegas once before, at China Ma Ma, and those were light. These were heavier and more earthy, so I'd have to say I liked these maybe a little more.

Shanghai Style Fried Shrimp: Simply shrimps, no shell or heads, no veges, nothing else, stirred until translucent white (not red or pink) in some sort of white sauce. Nothing much to it, I tasted no garlic or ginger, some would say ""bland"", but not really, as the restaurant provides a vinegar sauce for dipping, and when you do, it changes the entire flavor of the shrimps. The waitress got all excited when we ordered this specific dish, because it was ""typical Shanghai"", in her words. And, she said, ""some people (we guessed she meant non-Asian) don't care for the vinegar"". We loved it. And a very light dish, considering what came next.

Grandma's Pork in Soy Sauce: Basically chunks of pork belly with twisted ""ribbons"" of tofu in a very dark sauce, surrounded with steamed pieces of bok choy. Heavy duty, more a winter than summer dish, the pork was a little tough, but tasty, and the fat side on each pork piece was nice. But the tofu soaked up all of the good flavors of the sauce, and I actually quite liked those more so than the pork! Overall, a very good dish.

Eggplant with Soy Beans and Scrambled Eggs: This was a fave of the night. We were expecting ""heavy"", but it wasn't at all. It wasn't greasy or flabby, as some Chinese eggplant dishes can be. Quite lovely.

We were stuffed, as usual. And quite happy.

Next time we wanna try the Braised Pork Shank (it is said you need 3-4 people to order that dish, looking at it, it's pretty impressive!) and perhaps the sea cucumber (something we've eaten only twice, first time at a terrible place, but the second time a glorious black concoction, at a restaurant in Arcadia CA personally recommended for that specific dish by Jonathan Gold).

I interpret that as most of what we call ""Chinese"" here is not only food restyled for the tastes of us gaijin (foreigners) but the typical Cantonese style food that has been the usual ""Chinese"" here for decades.

On a drive through Las Vegas Chinatown, one of our ""adopted daughters"" noticed a sign in Chinese that said, ""Shanghai Restaurant"" and asked if we could try it. Well, that was a good suggestion. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the interior is quite pleasant. All the other customers were speaking Chinese, so that's a good sign. 

The staff was friendly and even gregarious, the service spot-on. When I dropped my knife on the floor, I was handed a replacement in about the time you could say ""I dropped my knife.""

Our students ordered Shanghai chicken, rice soup, fish soup, noodles, dim sum dumplings, shrimp, fried eggplant and I don't know what else. My wife wanted pork potstickers, I thought the sizzling beef sounded good, and for our daily vegetable we got the green beans with potato. 

OK, the potstickers were good; the beef was indeed sizzling, with onions and chunks of bell peppers - think of Chinese fajitas. Yummy! The vegetable dish was like fresh string beans with French fries in a Hoisin sauce or similar. I thought it was exceptional. In fact, the students insisted we come back for lunch the next day. 

Prices can add up if you are ordering individual dishes in the Chinese way of doing things, but they have an American-style $6,99 lunch special that is very much a bargain. This is truly delicious and authentic Shanghai-style food and I would give them six stars if I could.",2BCuFxAkQD9PFobJOKhcLQ,1,1,5,44caSt-wZSDOLIxMXT8mpA

The chicken soup too, taste like ""dish water"" according to my mother. And I agree. I am no chef but I can certainly do better than that.

We then politely spoke to the manager, she straight up said that she didn't see anything wrong with any of our orders. We feel terrible for the servers, to have to work for a manager like this woman.

Overall - 4/5

One of the few Shanghai food locations remaining in Las Vegas.
Went here with a friend for dinner after we saw it a while back while coming out of the shopping plaza across the street. We were originally coming here for the buns and noodles but realize that those items are more prominent on the lunch menu. They still serve the xiao long bao, or friend bao for dinner but they focus more toward the ""family"" style food for dinner time. We were surprise that they had such a big location and would be a great location for big parties for family dinners or any special events. 

The menu was quite big with professional like pictures, it took sometime looking through the menu because of the size. When I mean big, not in length but in picture sizes. Each picture took up a half a page which made it quite difficult to look through the whole menu fast.  Not much of a negative, but just thought it was interesting and I probably could have look through the whole menu a lot faster if the items were all condense onto a 1/4 of the pages.

--------------------------------------------Food - 5/5-----------------------------------------------­­----
Lunch time they focus mainly on the Bao / dumpling and noodle related food. We went for dinner and order a Pan Fried Dumplings, a beef, tofu vegetable soup and the beef hotpot bowl.

Pan Fried Dumplings  - Shen jian bao

It was pretty good, it wasn't the best in town but its not the worse either. I'm not too particularly picky with this item menu but the presentation was appealing. This traditional dish cannot compare to those served in LA but for Vegas and not having many places that serve this type of food, it was quite delicious. 

Beef Tofu and Vegetable Soup - $8 ish

This is one of my favorite soups on any menu. The soup was good and the quantity was more than enough for 2 people. We each had about 5 bowls of this and finished it. Nothing very special, this was just a personal favorite. 

Beef Hotpot Bowl - $12 ish

We were trying to figure out a third item to order and the manager / owner recommend this. It was quite delicious. It wasn't the soup based hotpot but cook in a pot with dried spices and vegetables. We had this with rice and it was delicious. The spicy kick in the beef made this go down well with a bowl of rice. 

----------------------------------------------­­Service 3/5-----------------------------------------------­­--
The service was mixed. The first manager / owner who came and took our order was great. She was professional and was able to take our order and make recommendations in a timely manner. The server who served our food was not professional. We asked for some pepper and vinegar for the beef soup and he bought us a small dish of both combined. We asked if we can have them separate and more vinegar but before we were able to ask for the next thing, he ran off. When the server came back, we had to ask for the next thing and he replied ""Why didn't you ask for everything all at once, there are other tables here"". The real question should be ""Why didn't you stay and listen rather than run off""

--------------------------------------------­­Cleanliness - 4/5---------------------------------------------
The restaurant was very clean. The decor was nice and you can see a lot of time and resources was put into the design and build out of the restaurant. The material they use for bowls, dishes, chopstick were more unique and better quality. The restaurant was going for more of a fine dining feel and it work out well. 

Overall
Great experience and pretty good food. We would like to go back and try out their lunch menu for sure. We originally wanted to eat more noodle related menu items but since we went for dinner, we had a mix menu.

Of course we enjoyed the delicious Shanghai dumplings with the embedded meatball and ""broth"". Newcomers are advised to permit the broth to seep out a bit before devouring or your tongue will pay a burning price. Not spicy, just temperature hot.

But seriously, if I could, I'd hit up DTF in LA at least once a week to veg out on many XLB, Shanghai Rice Cakes, String Beans, and Hot & Sour Soup ;D But really, ain't nobody got time for that. I barely have time to do laundry. So it's a good thing I live, literally, right down the street from Bund Shanghai. I venture East for all these different dishes about 10 minutes from the pad. Bund Shanghai is probably the best Shanghainese style restaurant in Vegas which is overtaken by Canto/HK style places. Venture onward!

XLB: So... maybe it's just me. But I think their XLB menu got smaller? They used to have a Crab & Pork but now they just sell generic XLB. Anywho, whatever is in there it's delicious and soupy. I've been fortunate enough to never have a dry one. If you're familiar with soup dumplings, you know there are few disappointments as disappointing as dry soup dumplings. T__T sadder words have never been spoken. Kidding...  But really though, Bund Shanghai has been mighty consistent with their XLB since I started eating here.

String Beans / Eggplant: Depending on the day, these dishes are sometimes oversauced. Some days, the string beans are dry and delicious. Other days, they're swimming in brown sauce. The overall flavor is quite good so the heavy-saucing isn't exactly a deterrent. Order at least one of these every time I go.

Hot & Sour Soup: Nothing can compare to the Hot & Sour soup of LA restaurants. I can't tell you what is different over there but I have major cravings for it sometimes. The soup here is an adequate replacement just to kick the craving.  I also order this most times I come here.

Shanghai Rice Cake: Stir-fried rice cakes w/ vegetables & a savory soy-based sauce. It's a nice alternative to say... Shanghai Pan-fried Noodle. Less saucy and a pleasantly chewy texture. 

Side note: Best to eat here in groups so you can #1. Use the Lazy Susan and #2. Try more things on the menu. No small plates here so you'll need a buddy to share with. Preferably 3 or 4 buddies.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,7,6,4,3-UrmXYb1Bjv41pG0431kg

(I was craving XLB all dayyyy and I typically go to 1900 Asian Cuisine for XLB but they were closed the day I went so I resorted to this place). 

The meat filling and soup was way too salty for my liking. Although the dough/dumpling wrapping was not too thick, its texture seemed to be a bit old and not too fresh. Most authentic Shanghai restaurants typically provide the fresh ginger along with the soy sauce, so it was a bit of a surprise to me when I had to order the fresh ginger on the side. In addition to the XLB, I ordered the hot and sour soup-- ya, no go. It was surprisingly bland and needed a bit more flavor. 

Overall customer service was good, but food was eh.",QmMYR3-h_XffYHLEfMMKVg,0,0,2,F3wFli8jtSPzv0xcfI8sAg

Located in a tall building on Decatur Boulevard, just a stone's throw from the sprawl of Spring Mountain, Bund Shanghai is considered by some to be one of the city's best places for authentic regional Chinese cuisine, and although prices trend a touch higher than several competitors, so too did quality of the experience as a party of three sat down to sample a mere fragment of the extensive picture-menu.

Admittedly a bit tucked away, and as such perhaps not as popular as it could be with more prominent placement and a menu more attuned to the ""cheap eats"" crowd, it was just after 6 o'clock on a Saturday that the dining room sat 95% empty and although both front of house and kitchen proved quite leisurely  the light IheartRadio soundtrack and conversation help pass the time until plates began to arrive, a menu in three courses just as requested with the total bill just shy of $150 after tax and gratuity.

Passing up novelties like bullfrog, duck heads, and items described only in Chinese characters from the menu's final page, it was with a quartet of appetizers that the meal kicked off, and although a personal favorite of fried pumpkin in egg yolk was a bit bland despite the pudding-soft texture beneath crisp tempura, the 'buttered corn pancake' was definitely something worth seeking out, the texture somewhat akin to a funnel cake with a sprinkling of sugar acting to enhance each kernel's intrinsic sweetness.

Not one to pass on XLB, especially in a city where good soup dumplings prove quite a challenge to find, Bund certainly ups the game by offering hand-made versions as opposed to the frozen ones offered elsewhere, but varying quality none the less presents a bit of a conundrum, some skins too thick while others are dainty and delicate, the more expensive crab and pork version a bit more meat than was anticipated while the traditional style was briny and bursting with broth.

Acknowledging that higher prices are mostly justified by ingredients, an MSG-Free kitchen, and portion sizes intended to be shared it was with a trio of entrees that the meal marched on and although the chopped ""flavor chicken"" was a bit too bony to be enjoyed fully both the (misspelled) braised pork and tail-on jumbo shrimp were textbook renditions of classics, the former tender without tasting ""fatty"" while the later was thankfully more creamy than sweet with the exception of candied walnuts.

Assuredly stuffed, but at least wanting to taste one of Bund's more esoteric desserts, a large bowl of Shanghai Rice Pudding was selected with oyster forks proving a rather unique utensil with which to indulge and with the sticky rice forming a dome over pureed taro in a generous pool of honey the flavors of coconut and chrysanthemum rose high on the palate while texture was added by red beans and almonds,

Assuredly 'finer' dining than many spots on Spring Mountain, with large portions helping to justify the menu's higher prices, Bund Shanghai proves a good choice for competent Chinese classics with plenty of intrigue remaining in items better suited to those possessing more adventurous palates.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,6,3,Mj1C2k9PgJjIm83kswO7Ig
5319064,2013-07-14,3,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"I had a great foodie experience when I went to Shanghai and I wanted to relive that experience so I went here with a group. The restaurant was almost empty but the parking lot was full. Clean, bright and enough room.

We ordered crispy fried salty pork shank, pan-fried dumplings, crab and pork xiao long bao, yang chow fried rice, mushroom with vegetable and Chongqing chicken. The crispy fried pork was everything the name implies: really salty and crispy. I recommend dipping it in vinegar to tone down the salt. The pan-fried dumplings were a bit doughy and not as good as the ones I had at Yang's Fry Dumplings in Shanghai (the best ones you'll ever have). The xiao long bao wasn't soupy at all. The filling was good though.

We saw ""Gold Marijuana Cake"" on the menu. Really? Marijuana??? We were going to order it for dessert but when we were putting an order for it our server turned red from embarrassment. She said it's supposed to say ""gold sesame cake"" not marijuana! Lost in translation!

They gave us free dessert: cold mung bean soup. It wasn't good and I'm glad it was free. They have soy milk so I ordered it. They serve it cold but they gave me hot soy milk because that's what I had for breakfast in China. Yay! It was hot, sweet and simple. I did my happy dance.

I know I seem to be comparing the food here with what I had in China, however, to have these offerings here in Vegas is good enough reason to come here. Better than the Panda place. Will I come back? Maybe, for the pan-fried dumplings and soy milk. And no, they don't give you fortune cookies after your meal.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,2,4,_UPoqF7KkKweT_rjYzpFag
5349077,2014-05-17,4,Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g,"Came to Bund Shanghai on Thursday for a semi-late lunch. My friend and I originally was going to try A&K but A&K told us they didn't have any xiao long bao so we decided to come to Bund Shanghai. I was in the mood for some XLB! Or pork soup dumplings. 

This was my first time at Bund Shanghai so I was pleasantly surprised that they had Chinese donut on the menu. And after having some amazing green onion pancake during my SoCal trip... I was also craving that. Then I saw soy milk! Needless to say this is what we ordered:

2 orders of XLB
1 order of Chinese donut
1 order of sweet soy milk
1 order of green onion pancake

The Chinese donut came first and I must say, it's pretty good. It was fresh when it came out but I have to also say that I've had better. But I don't see these too often in Vegas so I'll let it pass! :P But eat it when it's fresh or it'll taste really yucky with the amount of oil they used.

Sweet soy milk came out shortly after...but why is it slightly gray in color? I thought it was supposed to be white. I'm also not really used to how they served it here. Normally. I'm used to places serving you plain hot soy milk and if you want it sweet, you get to add the sugar yourself but here at Bund Shanghai, you choose either sweet or salty. They already have it prepped for you.

And then the XLB! I was excited and really wanted to try it since I've heard pretty good things about this place. However, all of the XLB were popped. What does that mean? It means none of the dumplings had soup in them. They had all leaked out. The MAIN point of why this type of dumpling is so good is because it has broth inside them. Our 2nd order of it wasn't any better. It had maybe 1-2 that wasn't popped but the rest were popped. 

Another thing about the XLBs were that... the meat was slightly sweet. That got me so confused. When I ate it, the whole thing tasted really really really weird. So when I ate the meat on its own, I find that the meat is a little sweetened. That is just odd to me. And the meat was also mushy ... T_T so so so weird.

Our green onion pancake came in last. Soooooooooooo, this doesn't look normal. The green onion pancakes I usually have are really thin but Bund Shanghai gave me green onion pancake Americano style. It was literally as thick as a pancake. I tried a bite or two, all the while muttering, ""What the hell am I eating?"" Needless to say, we didn't finish this dish.

Overall, really average. The service was pretty slow. On top of that, it was a huge disappointment. How do you pop ALL of my xiao long baos?!?! I'm not sure if I'll come back .. but if I do, I'm definitely trying something else maybe noodles or something.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,2,3,55JSwaKVSNVbYJgxHZPRlg

Their XLB was pretty good, but not the best we've tried.  The best things we tried were the stir fried lamb and the rice cake with pork, absolutely delicious!  We also tried the crispy fried salt pork shank, which I wouldn't order again.  It was pretty tough and at the $20 price tag I expected much better.

Unfortunately my phone self destructed the photos folder, so I have no pics to upload as the backup function also decided to self destruct. Wonderful!

Ardie ordered because I had never been here and he and Sho are regulars.

2 orders Xiaolongbao - I've never had xiaolongbao prior to this lunch. I did not like the dipping sauce that accompanied them because it had a strong white vinegar flavor. I have nothing to compare these to but I'd say they were okay.

1 order of pan fried pork buns - I definitely prefer the crispy, crunchy bread bao. Not much soup in them, but I preferred these to the steamed bao.

1 order stir fried string beans - I'm not much of a green bean person (I hate all beans, including jelly beans - always have) but these were pretty decent. It probably had more to do with the meat sprinkles. Mmm meat sprinkles. 

1 order Chinese broccoli - Also okay, no strong flavors either way. I'd say this was a neutral dish.

While everything I tried was staunchly ""A-OK"" I definitely want to come back to try the lamb. If a place has good lamb, I'll be a repeat for sure.

Also, this restaurant seemed super clean which is always a big big plus after all of the dirty dining footage of restaurants on Spring Mountain.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,3,3,o8EDzX34rSut3_q6fzOZfA

And according to my Shanghainese in-laws, the restaurant is quite authentic.  Just as there are many types of ""asian"" cuisine, China also has different styles of Chinese food, and Shanghai Cuisine is what is highlighted at Bund Shanghai.  This style of cooking is more on the sweet side, and is often braised in soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, or wine.  

Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are very typical Shanghai cuisine.  An order comes with 8 delicate dumplings. They were very flavorful, however not filled with as much ""soup"" as I prefer.  This may be due to the fact that the wrapper they use is a bit thicker and may have absorbed it.  When this order is placed at your table, you want to eat it right away, before it cools. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Buns and the Pork Pot Stickers.  They were also flavorful, but they don't compare to my favorite, Din Tai Fung in SoCal.  

We also ordered Grandma's Made Braised Pork in Soy Sauce.  This is a winning dish.  Be warned that there are thick pieces of pork fat on each piece, that I usually discard, but the actual meat is tender and delicious.  If you prefer spicy food, there are also Szechuan dishes offered such as Kung Pao Shrimp and Mongolian Beef, where the bright red spicy chiles are infused in every bite.  

This restaurant is probably one of the most elegantly decorated authentic Chinese restaurants that I have ever eaten at.  Also the cleanest! The service was very friendly, however my in-laws communicated in their native dialect of Shanghainese to the servers the entire time.  Thus, I do not know if their will be a language barrier if I attempt to dine on my own.  This is obviously a very popular spot for the Chinese community in Las Vegas as the restaurant was quite busy the entire time we were there.  The owner of the restaurant also stopped by the table to check on us, she doted on my kids, conversed with my in-laws where we learned that her sister owns the Bund Shanghai Restaurant in San Francisco.
