Our only  issue was the choice of dinnerware.  The coffee cups have small round  handle high on the cup making them difficult to  hold  when full of hot beverage.  Also, the square ceramic plates have  a  tendency slip and turn on the marble table tops, especially when cutting food.  Will go there again.",j32gm52dzbZ2H9flwR2rvA,0,0,4,ieRUYFRvQ9ECjlA6_i3n1w

I got the Eggs Benedict and it was just okay, especially considering it was $16. English muffins tasted a bit funny & it could've used more Hollandaise. My husband's omelette looked like it was made in a production line. Over cooked eggs that they just slapped some cheese & bacon in the middle, folded it in half and called it done. Good omelettes are fluffy and have ingredients mixed in. The sourdough toast was too thick and came out cold, so the butter didn't melt at all. Butter came from small packets & coffee creamer too. I prefer a butter dish and small pourable creamer. 

Server was very nice and took my husband's feedback on the omelette. He promised it would be better if we came back again.",7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg,4,0,3,S81kL7GomSaZzkXiyA0ClA

More than that, the management team is extremely attentive to your needs (Stanley and Billy). Our party was checked on throughout our visit and was assured that customer service was a priority.

What made our experience truly amazing was our server, Andrea. She epitomizes what you want from a server. She was warm, personable, and polite. She took the time to get to know each of us and made a our visit memorable.

Some familiar with a healthy twist. I personally love the asian section because of the ramen and Singapore noodles. The aps are all great here, fresh and clean tasting.

2089882,2017-12-08,0,P2dFr-Jg1OUoNMikaCmLEQ,"Prior to seeing a show at Planet Hollywood, my husband and I decided to grab a quick bite. With NFR in town, we knew finding a quieter place would lead us to the quickest service in the casino. Cafe Hollywood delivered both on quickly, friendly service and good food. I was pleasantly surprised with our choice to eat here. 

Cafe Hollywood is located close to the escalators up to the Mezz level on the casino floor, tucked between a Starbucks and a bar. We were greeted by the hostess who was able to seat us immediately. She offered our choice of table or booth in a number of locations, which was lovely. We opted for a corner booth tucked in the back which gave us a big separation between the hustle and bustle of the casino. This was much appreciated. The walls were decorated with pictures of celebrities and they had TVs mounted on the wall. There is even a dessert bar in the center and an actual bar in the back left corner of the restaurant (full service of course). 

Our server arrived promptly to our table and took our drink orders. We received both our waters and beer/wine in a timely fashion. From there, the server continued to be very attentive, bringing out plenty of condiments before our meal arrived. In grand total, I think we waited 10 minutes for our food to make it to the table after ordering. The restaurant was pretty slow, so I appreciated that they still served us quickly! I enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which was quite good. It was paired with fries that really stole the show (the batter was perfect, without being too greasy). The whole time they even played a great mix of current music and fun throw backs. Overall this is a great little quick bite place to have a nice dinner prior to catching a show.",KjMt33U4VCs84CQAEn3XUg,0,1,4,RUDuK616SbFb0Xkw9S0tDA

Anthony the server was great, attentive, and apologetic. It wasn't his fault. The manager Eddie came over and asked if I wanted something else. I was afraid to try any other disappointments from them so I said no and he walked away! He never introduced himself as the manager, I had to ask someone else. And HE NEVER APOLOGIZED!

3928878,2017-12-07,6,P2dFr-Jg1OUoNMikaCmLEQ,"Sometimes the criteria for hotel restaurant in Las Vegas are suitable convenience and relative affordability. Recently renovated, and now opened for 24 hours, this brightly blue and spacious cafe serves up a decent variety of food that should satiate your palate in the midst of late night. This modern take of a diner hosts a plentiful number of tables, so your dominating worry would be the wait on the food. 

While the service is slow, presumably still fresh from its recent opening and training, the decor is wonderfully new, with walls swamped with nostalgic photos from the days of the Planet Hollywood restaurant fad. But of course, you're not here for the ambiance.The simple menu is mostly comprised of the typical menu from your American dining restaurant, but with small section for Asian fares. 

-Fried Calamari: Simple and enough for 3 or 4 people, the dish could benefit from more scallions and toppings.
-Citrus Kale: Decent amount of cheese and nuts, this salad has a brings a tart balance with crunchy texture every bite.
-Singapore Noodles: The best dish ordered, this bowl of noodles combines thinly sliced vegetables with dry curry powder, aromatic and stimulating.
-Pork Belly Ramen: The dish does not look like picture, and carries a slightly salty taste with a soup based seemingly flooded with a soy sauce bottle. There are definitely better dishes on the menu. 
-Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: Blend and slightly dry, this dish definitely should include more pasta, as you would feel hungry after devouring this dish. The placement of the herb might look enticing, but would be more flavourful if chopped and sprinkled over the dish.
-Thai Basil Chicken: Though slightly chewy, the chicken is certainly filling, but could be more flavourful with more basil, which isn't even sliced. 
-BBQ Ribs: Quite filling with soft and tender texture that easily falls apart with a bite. This is the second best dish ordered, more than expected that my table of 8 couldn't even finish! 

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Environment: 4/5

If you're like me, instead of nitpicking over the acceptable variety of food here, you'll probably be more bothered by the useless lamps hanging, over every table, that provides practically no luminosity (hence the poor lightning and focus for my photos). But be prepared, the food won't look the same as the photos on the menu.",qL_g6EHINjnePuQid1FmoA,7,4,4,4mYDBHQVespFB0z9DrLSXw

The wonderful desserts that they are selling are such great eye candy. Although this trip to the cafe I am taking in the breathtaking deserts from afar. These desserts although are probably heaven would destroy all the hard work that I have done thus far. I had bacon and eggs instead; this is at least good for you.

The service was great and so was the team work between the employees. I decided to take my order to go. After I placed my order in real life I had a little wait.

It also had 2 deep fried jalapeño slices, cheese, pico de Gallo and this delicious slaw.. The slaw had a distinctive citrus flavor and it really set the burger off, This burger scores high in originality, concerning its taste. Interestingly, this burger was wayyy better that the burger I once had at Gordon Ramsey's. Go figure! 

Diner is cute & filled with celebrity photos on the wall. My Caesars salad wasn't too good. I didn't eat it because I was full from my burger.. but even if I wasn't I probably wouldn't have eaten it all. It was edible but greens could have been a little more fresh and should have included romaine lettuce-and the dressing could have used some work too.

Service was good, but kinda slow. May have seemed that way because I was super hungry.

For a cafe, this place is somewhat pricey. (Like most are on the 50 yard line of the strip) However, I don't mind paying for the burger that I had because it was just that good. 

So glad that I found yet another great restaurant in Vegas to frequent. I absolutely loved that burger and will go out of the way to have it again in Vegas. The burger is definitely worthy of 5 stars!",FQHdS67O9x0pXZBtAk39tQ,1,1,4,QC_Yt0I_AREk68juHnj8YA

One of the best specials at the previous establishment was the steak and eggs. I think Cafe Hollywood needs to bring that back. 
I had the chicken and waffles, I should say the tender and waffles. True chicken and waffles should be actual chicken and not tenders. However, I will admit it was good all things considered. My wife had the omelet with toast. Again nothing spectacular but decent overall.

My only complaint was on the slowness of the waiters. It took about 10 minutes to order, around 20 minutes to get our food, and about another 20 minutes after our plates were taken away to get our check. THEN...another 15 minutes until (and asking 3 different people) to take our check! Not sure why our waiter kept skipping out on our table, I saw him talking to his other tables.
