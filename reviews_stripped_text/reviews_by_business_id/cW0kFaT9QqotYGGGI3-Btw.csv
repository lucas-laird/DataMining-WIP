Can't beat that, it was definitely worth the couple dollars. If I'm ever walking near and have a couple dollars to spare I'll make a quick stop.",KdaDwKAZtdudgojVf9rB0A,0,0,3,hz-_d6bwPpMwzRB4rpt4Ug
888168,2017-09-02,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,Super chill spot in the middle of strip. Cheap hot dogs that taste great and the bartenders were even better. Steven and Warren made our night. Will come back!,0ZhJwcbmUXumhGez5L-F9w,0,0,5,vsbG3P-S4IEvsMspcOoJxQ
1390202,2017-03-30,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,I personally like the veggie dogs from here. They are probably the same as from the grocery store. They are small. Snack size. Good if I'm starving after work or b4 the gym. Not good for a meal unless you eat several. I ordered one like the picture and of course it barely had a topping. (Toppings are .75 extra) The coconut drink I had was good but tasted like 100% sugar. I wouldn't go out of my way for this. It's not like Pinks. Then again.. Pinks is usually $25 a meal and this place is about $6.,5Bs1BZcD6_wo_sUiAGe7FA,2,0,3,ERKciLmYokXTGRQaFh9ZEw
1500749,2017-06-24,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,"This place was horrible.  The employee was super sweet but the chili cheese dog was the worst I have ever had. My chili had the consistency and taste of refried beans and my weiner was beyond cooked. It was old, hard and has the consistency of cardboard. $8 wasted.",tqipQWR-SRJ_b00Dox9g6Q,0,0,1,3hzR3ZYY30kiKSzuZLS1kg
2145706,2017-09-10,2,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,"They ran out of ""yard cups"" so the guy making drinks gave me a large cup plus a little side car for $10. Not a bad deal, especially because they use real fruit. It tasted a little light on the alcohol, so we added some of our own after. But I really did like that it was a real fruit smoothie with tequila. 

Papaya King is located next to the Marco Polo, in the ""Hawaiian marketplace"". I find the name a little offensive as nothing resembles hawaii. I'm 100% sure papaya king doesn't use Hawaiian papaya if they use papaya at all in their drinks. 

The guy making drinks was nice enough and it's nice that it's a little bar where you can sit to enjoy your cocktail. You can also watch them blend up your cocktail right there at the bar, which is different from all the other fake tasting dispenser slushee places on the strip. 

I'd come back to try other concoctions! And it's very centrally located!",Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,2,2,4,MRSZ6vXIlTXzlvTu_xSc3g
2218903,2017-05-27,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,Dry small hotdogs. Fries are good. Place was empty. Not going back to this place. I was dissapointed. I dont understand the hype of my newyorker friends about this. I dont know if its just this place. But with the hotdog that tiny and dry.. who wants to eat there again??? Not me.,KYGqNb0JSKkQSJfaWiyJCg,0,0,1,t9hH_FJs0RgIF7VZl-C3dg
2421236,2017-07-20,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,lol literally how does this place exist. Drinks are super good and cheaper than back in Toledo Ohio anyways our bartender is playing jenga with us and keeps giving us shots is this review long enough now just come here,SmkXxaoZ4_nxvmBO4dKAFA,0,0,5,RP6bE4BMHfo6xKdIZFw2Pw
2709445,2017-05-12,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,"I'm sorry to even write this review it was so bad. I lived on the west side of manhattan for almost four years and Papaya King was my lunch and dinner many times over. This Location is horrendous to say the least. The red onion and sauerkraut used on my hot dogs were extremely salty, dry, and overcooked. Employees had no idea what was going on even though there were only 3 people in the entire restaurant. Some things just need to stay in NYC and need not to be franchised out. These franchisee's apparently do not care about the amazing tradition that is Papaya King and are defiantly not upholding the standards set by the original. If you're a New Yorker on Vacation..stay away!!",kfKdpGst8x_u6baXsP1G5A,2,0,1,c0-Ve5ZGW-9eOtw_D644Vw
2730067,2017-06-09,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,We stopped her for a quick bite when heading black to our hotel. It was a very good hot dog for a $1 and since we checked in on a yelp we received a free topping. The waiter didn't even know that when you check in you get a free topping and was in shock when we requested it although there was a sign hanging in front of him that specifically said.. if you check in on yelp you get a free topping.. these waiters need to be updated with what promos their company is having .. but again the hotdog was good and definitely great for $1,RrUN2N_uk2rcFNTN4TW9mg,0,0,3,SGEIJIoovpK3h_c_8Qv0sw
3462714,2017-09-27,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,"This is a new place. Saw the $1 hot dog sign, was craving one so I tried it. Waited 10 minutes for bartender to make on drink. Ten minutes to get my hot dog. Twenty minutes? That's not right. A tiny hot dog with a cold bun. Served on a napkin at the bar. Never again.
These new places need to learn SERVICE & QUALITY matters.

I wrote the above review back in May 2017. I was walking by lay Friday 9/22 they are ""Out of Business "". I am always correct.",Wamin4k5s07vLbx_jq4qcQ,0,0,1,ho_MTR-JR9fXbf3LcgUvuA

4458465,2017-07-07,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,Great drinks great customer service and not to mention the cool zone is right there. My favorite place to grab a few drinks during the day. Try the spiked grape is amazing.,f9mKtEN9UeBFadp3sw0nsg,0,0,5,ndAS6mWmI4Z3490syQZ4ug
5039752,2017-04-29,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,"There are some things that don't translate well, there has to be something in the water, or in the scenery or something in the air. This Papaya King was rotten. 

Full disclosure I have not tried the NY locations, but was eager to try the Las Vegas offerings. We swung by and they were not busy, but for some reason the guy already had hot dogs cooked and ready to go on the griddle. Not sure if you have ever done this, but the hot dogs shrink, the casing looses it's crunch and overall it just leads to a poor experience. Not to mention the bun was cold and not in the steamer or anywhere. So it was a bit of a difficult swallow. 

The Papaya drink tasted like a taffy that was lightly papaya flavor. I wouldn't call it refreshing, but it was tasty. I would drink it again, if I was drunk.",UJu9I_pKdrjHmiwR164K-w,1,0,1,SJoiGTO7Z_gPyFwNXcUZ3A

5815207,2017-05-16,0,cW0kFaT9QqotYGGGI3-Btw,Good dogs! A bit expensive for hot dogs and fries but the food was good. The poor guy behind the counter was all by himself when we got there and it was pretty busy so service was slow. He was on his cell phone trying to get someone to come in and help him but I can't fault him for that.,2vfC2TmTuw2_AXjx4fehZw,1,0,4,z8Y9K3gE2R36-oUeILCs6g
