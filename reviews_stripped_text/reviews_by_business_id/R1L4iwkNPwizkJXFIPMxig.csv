955072,2017-02-22,0,R1L4iwkNPwizkJXFIPMxig,"So, because I don't really have a life, I really enjoy spending time browsing Yelp reviews (seriously, like hours and hours!).  I'm very particular about my food and l like to learn all I can about a restaurant/food chain before visiting. That's how I discovered Five Guys. The reviews looked good enough (many 4 & 5 star ratings) to warrant a visit from me. The food pictures were enticing as well. However, I don't live near a Five Guys, so although I've known about the establishment for quite some time, I've never made it in to try it. That changed today!

I had to run an errand where there happens to be a Five Guys in the shopping center.(Maryland PKWY) I told my daughter I wanted to try it because I knew this was probably going to be my only chance. So, it was like now or never.

My daughter and I walked in and I took notice of the number of patrons dining in/purchasing food. The place was not super full, but there was a good amount of people sitting in eating and there were a lot of people coming in to take out their orders. This is something I am super huge on. If there is not anyone there I wonder why. The place was spacious, not overly crowded, and it was clean. No dirty tables in sight and the floor was shiny. Anyways, my daughter and I made our way to the front of the order line where we were immediately greeted by a smiling cashier. Remember, this was my first time visiting so it was comforting to be acknowledged. I ordered two Bacon Cheeseburgers. I was unaware that none of the burgers come with basic condiments (lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion,etc) however the cashier informed me that I just need to let them know what I want and they would add it (no charge). The condiments menu, I thought, offered a good variety of choices. I opted for the basics mentioned above, in addition to extra mayo and mustard. The total for the two bacon cheeseburgers came to about $16 (including tax). I've never in my life paid this much for just two burgers unless I was at a sit down restaurant. However, after going over the reviews on yelp I figured it was worth it. I don't mind paying a little more for quality food and a peaceful dining experience. 

So, we were given a receipt and told our order would be up shortly. My daughter and I moved to the waiting area where we were able to view up close our food being prepared. I loved this because as I stated previously I am very particular about my food and that includes how it's being prepared. The cooks wore gloves, ingredients looked fresh, and just knowing that our burgers were made to order right before our eyes (and not sitting under a warmer for who knows how long) made my anticipation grow. But...when they were done making the burgers and began wrapping them I became worried. I'd had in my mind that since I was paying roughly $8 for a burger, that they would be, well huge, especially since the bacon cheeseburger comes with a double patty. However, from a short distance, the burger appeared to be just average in size. Fine. Whatever. At this point I was expecting the worst (in terms of taste) but hoping for the best (I've had some huge let downs lately dining at new food establishments). And now to the taste test and the ultimate reason for my five star review:

BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!!!!! I unwrapped my burger, my daughter did the same and upon first glance presentation was up to par. Nice. Looked good. Next, we both took our first bite. DELICIOUS. JUICY. Flavored well. I loved it and so did my daughter. It was at that moment that I was like yes! I'm gonna love this place and I really don't mind the price because hey it's quality and for me that's something that has been hard to come by in Vegas. We wanted to eat half of our burgers there and take the other half home to have for later but we couldn't. We each devoured ours within minutes. To us it was that good!. I'll be back one day for sure.

Also, I wanted to add that the restrooms seem to be well kept; very clean, but no seat covers. 

Overall, our experience was great! Definitely what I expect when I dine anywhere - cleanliness, good customer service from workers, and food that's worth the money you pay. This place met all of the marks, hands down! Would recommend. Five stars from me!",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,1,0,5,o5Srnh3ddtQZOE8ZeILflA

2104303,2016-04-30,2,R1L4iwkNPwizkJXFIPMxig,"I like that Five Guys french fries are simply potatoes fried in peanut oil, and that their website makes it clear that they're suitable for a vegan diet. 

My vibrations change a little as I enter. Slurping on a soda and pulling food out of a brown bag, I feel no different than the average fast food user. It's a cruel world, and you have to eat, so I'm nothing but gracious that Five Guys gives me the opportunity. But I try not to do this often.

Wifi would be an improvement. I'm not sure if any Five Guys have it, so it's not a knock against this particular location.

When I ordered a drink they tried to up-sell me to a large, for 30 cents more. Nice try kid. You should be happy I didn't ask for a water cup and drink for free. There's no benefit to a larger cup when it's free refills and I'm eating there (and if I was taking it to go, I wouldn't carry a fountain soda with me).

I'm torn between 3 stars and 4. There's nothing remarkable about it relative to what I'd imagine other Five Guys locations are like, so I'm pretty comfortable calling it a 3. 

Plus, they have weird neighbors: 

When I was done eating, the grease and soda were having a party in my mouth, and I happened to have my toothbrush on me, so I brushed my teeth over to the side of the strip mall building. The MetroPCS security guard came out and was bothered that I had spit on the parking lot which could vaguely be considered in front of their store. (I mostly laughed, and it seems like a totally petty thing to worry about, but I didn't really have any problem respecting his wishes for their parking lot. One could also argue that it's a shared lot with Five Guys, so even a principled respect for whoever owns it would still mean a customer should feel free to brush their teeth there-- If I did it inside, I'd clog up the restroom for 3 minutes and someone may need it, so doing it outside seems like the conscientious move, once you get over the emotional hurdle of what you're ""supposed"" to do where.)

In a classic case of a dimwit falling head over heals for authority, some other guy piled on afterwards, ""cmon man, you know you can't be doing that"", which was especially silly since it's not even his parking lot and I had stopped at this point. ""Why?"" I lol'd. I guess the theory of when it's appropriate to spit in parking lots is very important to him, but he spinelessly slid away when I challenged him, so we'll never know.

Incidentally I had seen the security guard eating at Five Guys when I was in there. I even yielded to him when we approached the trash can at an intersecting path. I'd like to live in a world where killing sentient animals because you like the way they taste (and raping them so you can add cheese) would be more egregious than someone brushing their teeth outside.

Until then I'll use this to break the tie, to hold Five Guys a little bit responsible for the seedy area they're in, and settle on the 3-star rating.",Xk6eltDay-oOPeVWwFy34w,0,1,3,I2S_UmCvdi7kChV7JCKcxQ

Burger, burger with cheese, burger with bacon, burger with bacon and cheese...junior or regular size and that's it. Fries are great steak fries with that crispy outside and soft inside. They also come in Cajun which is a perfect amount of spice and flavor. The toppings are the only real variations you can get. There is one list that is the basics which amount to about 9, I think. Stuff like ketchup, mustard, tomato, etc. You can automatically get all of these with asking for going 'all the way'. Then there's another set of toppings that is a little more unique like a1 sauce, jalapenos, bar bq sauce, etc. That really sums it all up. They have one of those super soda dispensers that have every variation of every brand of soda, juice, non carbonated, etc. Can't really go wrong here but the only reason it's not 5 stars for its genre in my book is the burgers themselves are actually kind of pathetic. Very skimpy and I'm thinking ""where's the beef"" when I see them. They are just small and weak looking but because of everything else, it kind of makes up for it but if you are really looking for a juicy burger dripping with meat, this is not three place for that.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,1,4,YDnTnrf8IEC8gagqaWnhAQ

It was my first time ever at Five Guys and some things really impressed me like the complimentary peanuts, insane soda machine and the sheer dazzling amount of choices to customize your hamburger. I had the regular with a side of fries. I wasn't really blown away by the fries, mainly because they were a pitch too salty. The fries are sliced large and fried with that crispy brown finish that resonates home-made style fries. I personally prefer thin fries with the yellow finish with a slight crisp, like the ones at In-and-Out or Smashburger. The hamburger is satisfying and savoring with every bite. However towards the end it can get very messy and almost laborious to finish it. I thought it lacked a certain ""wow"" factor and the fries are mediocre. My friend said that the burger is way better with customizations such as the A1 sauce and etc but I was expecting the regular one to pull through and blow the competition away.

I *really* wanted to like the place since the chain has been widely successful and my friends never stop raving about it. Keeping in mind that the joint just opened a FEW days ago, all the flies made my first (and last) experience a bit uneasy. I'm pretty ""meh"" about burgers - I can get pretty satisfied with a dollar menu McDouble.

The fries were extremely hot AND just as soggy. Not good. The burger was so huge that I had no idea how to even eat it. It was pretty good even though it just fell apart after taking my first fail bite. Haha.

Why I don't want to return anymore is because I was eating a burger with my gf and we heard employees talking about their work. Don't get me wrong I worked with food for several years and there is always a time and place for backstage conversation which by the way is AT THE BACK! AWAY FROM PEOPLE! I just felt so uncomfortable after hearing the employees LOUDLY say ""Just do it the customers will never know the difference"" and ""They will never find out"" ..Uhh.. You literally JUST opened the joint  a few days ago and are already doing something shady? *shivers* This mystery could be anything from major unsanitary issues or simply be a tomato being sliced too thick or thin on accident. Who knows? Whatever. For all I care it's probaby something that would explain all the flies hopping around all over the place.",7lXJ1xfcuVNk-i1B48oGvA,5,2,3,niT2c4XGSwmm1fYHPVn6Iw

The place was clean and service was friendly and fine. I just didn't like the food or the vibe. I ordered a burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, ketchup and mustard plus a side of fries and a drink. I ordered it to eat in. The wait was not long at all. My food came in a bag. I said I wanted it to eat in and I guess the bag is how it's served. I open the bag and the sandwich is underneath a pile of fries with a cup for the fries next to the sandwich in the bottom of the bag. It's a generous order of fries, but an annoying delivery method. The menu states they serve the burgers well done and juicy. They are well done. They are not juicy. The burger had a poor crumbly bun and all I could taste was the pickles, tomatoes, condiments etc. The skinny well done patty was overwhelmed by the toppings. The fries were cut to perfect dimensions and cooked nicely but horribly under salted. The burger was nothing I would ever return for. A little about the ambience. The kitchen has this loud interaction with the customer thing going on that I find very annoying. When you enter they yell something like ""man in the door"" and they yell what they are cooking back and forth to each other. Makes me feel like I'm eating in a pet store specializing in parrots. It was slow when I was there, only a few tables. I'd hate to hear that on a busy day. While I was eating one of the employees in the kitchen asked me, from the kitchen while I was seated, how the burger was. I shrugged and grimaced. She asked if there was a problem and if I needed more fries. I just said all I tasted was the veggies, that I just didn't care for it.

They have peanuts....like a ton of it and you can have as much as you desire.

Now what's really to die for is their fries, I'm always up for delicious fries over anything else really. And their fries with cajun seasoning is DELICIOUS, my first time ever and I fell in love with it. I'd totally just come back for fries and skip the burger.

The price is pretty decent, it's not too expensive but still it can all add up when you're adding fries, drinks, etc to your order.

This location is really close to my house (flamingo/maryland pkwy), inside and outside of restaurant was CLEAN.  A dirty location will have me turn around and walk back to my car.  The staff was on point, and the manager made sure of it.  While I was there I witness the manager address his employee for not following proper dress code for work.  That is how you run a TIGHT operation.

Quality of food: AWESOME, hot, exactly what I ordered, no complaints

The 5 star rating is not based on food but more so on the appearance, cleanliness and operation of the restaurant.  Places near the university sometimes do not have the most clean locations, employees are not friendly and quality of food sub-par.

Service was nice enough, they greet you as you enter and say goodbye as you leave. I like how one of the guys kept shouting things like ""good job team, keep it up, etc."" as they went through making the orders.

About a year ago I swore off Five Guys. They had appeared on the Vegas scene in all their glory and they have since multiplied. I visited 5 Guys in Henderson, and 5 Guys in North Vegas. Each time I just was not completely impressed. The burger, to me, was too loaded with stuff, it was too compacted in the foil, the mustard and ketchup and mayo was all over the place. The fries, although good, were too many, too much, ridiculous. I don't want a bag of fries - I wanted a little cup of fries, why is that so hard to do 5 Guys? I get it. It's their thing, but I guess I just don't like it.

Compare this with Inn N Out, clean, fresh, nicely wrapped burgers. Crispy lettuce, not too many condiments. French fries - perfect, crispy, lightly salted, and served in a nice clean-looking white tray. The fries are not spilling all over your burger in the bag. No. They are just as they should be - contained.

I tried 5 Guys again. I happened to be shopping at Target. I happened to be hungry. It had been awhile so I thought maybe, just maybe I would give 5 Guys another shot. And it all came back to me...

It's just not my cup of tea.

Only cool thing - New-Age Coke Machines. BUT. Firehouse Subs have these popular machines as well. I will go to Firehouse Subs next time, or Inn N Out... anywhere but 5 Guys.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,2,EjB3dnu3kJF-TzVziv1DMw

And sometimes a juicy hamburger is the perfect comfort food. And after having a horrible experience with the Five Guys out South on Eastern I felt they were due for a second chance. 

Ordering was fast, service was friendly, and I like all the various options you can choose to load up your burger with. I ordered the spicy fries and was handed a drink cup. After paying I turn and...whoa, what's this? Do I see the new Super Coke machines? Why yes I do and there's two of them. At this point even if the food sucks, I get vanilla cherry Coke and life is good. 

I pick up my food and I'm like dang these fries are good. Too good as I'm through half of them before I remember I got a burger to try. Unlike my first experience, this one was what I expected it to be, and my faith in Yelp and other sources in saying Five Guys really was all that had been restored. 

Overall I wish the fries had been a bit crispier, but the bacon cheeseburger was perfect, and the vanilla cherry Coke was awesome. (I'm not supposed to have any Coke these days so this was a treat for me).

Their hamburgers are WAY too messy... they need to provide forks and knives to the customers and they need to have a salad option. This is what I love about The Habit.

The fries are quite good, but PLEASE crinkle cut them!
The burgers are good but... I'm not sure there is something about them that while it tastes ""burger-ey"" it doesn't make me crave them like I might something more substantial like the burger at The Capital Grill or STACK which is the best burger I've ever had.

I love the fancy coke machines, but that isn't a reason to go to Five Guys.

I've been three times now... twice on my own and once to take people who have never been and wanted to try it.

My feeling is this:

I don't crave it, and it's not bad.

PS the hawt dog is better than the burger


Me gusta mucho Five Guys hamburguesas. Sin embargo no me gusta lo suficiente como para ir todo el tiempo. Creo hamburguesa Smash y más crítica ""The Habit"" es mucho más sabroso. Ahora no voy a gastar tiempo llamando a estos tipos. Aquí está mi BEEF (ha ha) con el Five Guys:

Sus hamburguesas son demasiado desordenado ... que necesitan para proporcionar tenedores y cuchillos a los clientes y que necesitan para tener una opción de ensalada. Esto es lo que me gusta de The Habit.

Las patatas fritas son bastante buenos, pero POR FAVOR, corte ondulado de ellos!
Las hamburguesas son buenos, pero ... No estoy seguro de que hay algo en ellos que, si bien su sabor ""burger-ey"" no me hace anhelar ellos como si yo pudiera algo más sustancial como la hamburguesa en The Capital Grill o pila, que es la mejor hamburguesa que he tenido.

Me encantan las máquinas de fantasía coque, pero eso no es una razón para ir a Five Guys.

He estado ya tres veces ... dos veces por mi cuenta y una vez para llevar a las personas que nunca han estado y quería probarlo.

Mi opinión es la siguiente:

No me antoja, y no es malo.

Why oh why take a good basic foundation and ruin it with a slice of processed cheese, then charge $6.99 for it ?

Our fries were good, not great but good and I really do think chains such as this and In-N-Out set themselves apart by using freshly cut fries.

So in the end, a semi good meal, not something I would rave about, when it comes down to it, a double double is better in my book and half the price.
