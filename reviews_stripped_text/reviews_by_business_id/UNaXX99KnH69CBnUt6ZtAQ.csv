255069,2013-09-08,3,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,"24hr Subway w/ no Drive Thru.
You should eat no where else Late at night

Workers are great (including me haha). Come by, I'll be glad to make your sandwich.

We have quick sandwich makers. If you come in when it's slow, you'll be on your way in no time.
**This location does get a steady amount of customers, wait time depends on how fast the customer orders their sandwich ahead of you** (some ppl take FOREVER)

I would not even go to McDonald's that's nearby.",p4cgdndi_MI4DU509Clwsg,1,0,5,otLS62b73nlCKTL6rwkWwA

Even when i come late at night after 11pm. So thats always a plus. Other than that. Its just another subway that happens to be 24hr and on the way home. Always great to ""Eat Fresh"".

The bread was fresh which is awesome considering they are open 24 hrs you never know what you're going to get.

I figured breakfast was over due to it ending at 11am so halfway thru my order they were happy to make me bfast!!

2526966,2016-09-22,0,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,I've never had the greatest experience while visiting this subway but it's close and not terrible. My boyfriend loves the tuna sub but he always asks if it's fresh (prepared that day) and half the time they say no. This is not ok especially when it comes to tuna.

2946332,2014-02-07,0,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,"So I am now realizing I'm spoiled with sandwiches. This is one of the better subways I've been too but still not great! The guy behind the counter was really cool. I believe his name was Kevin. He seemed like he was having a long day and we helped each other out with laughs. 

On the the food. Tonight I got what I like to call a fireball. It's meatball with hot sauce. So AMAZING. I got it on Italian herb and cheese bread with pepper jack cheese. The bread was just sucky. I got it toasted to get a crunch in it. It was too soft it just didn't hold up. However the meatballs were perfect, also go some green peppers and they tasted really good and fresh. 

They have a lot of options for chips and drinks. The have milk!!! Which is were but awesome! I didn't have it tonight I have the XXX vitamin water. Place was clean and empty when I went. 24 hours which is a huge plus.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,1,1,4,Cv6nZBisyDkGOvWW1ZO_Og
3473903,2017-12-03,0,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,I will never eat here again. I felt so uncomfortable when I first walked in. The girl that was working there didnt even say hi to me and wasn't very friendly. She took her sweet ass time to put some gloves on and get started on my sandwich. And by the time she was done making my food another girl that works there was standing by her taking a cookie out and eating it right in front of me like it wasn't an issue to do that in front of customers when it is VERY unprofessional. This place was terrible never eating here again.,Wv8WH9YyJQbj_HHmMtJaWg,1,0,1,smTNtjqch5AfvNR_f0mg4Q
3613821,2016-01-28,0,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,"Not impressed with this location! The smallest meat balls I've ever seen, about the size of a 50 cent piece that they put 6...yes 6 of those tiny things on a full sub! The look I got when I asked for some marinara sauce.... Excuse me! I don't want a dry ""meatball marinara"" sandwhich. Then you'd think the kid behind the counter had to milk the cow and make the cheese! Barely a sprinkle of the shredded Mozzarella on the sandwich. Really? Then the tuna sandwich....4 tiny scoops for a foot long? Really?? WTF!  No, not impressed. Wasted my time and money! Worst experience ever for a Subway. Never seen this B.S. At any other location ever. I'm pissed.",cXxNjGI70ZBVqzLtGWyesA,1,0,1,ZPJ-8Q4eE3GEG8G6AieVmQ

4967673,2014-03-26,0,UNaXX99KnH69CBnUt6ZtAQ,"so i'm kind of a subway snob. so with that in mind.....

the high school aged staff kinda drives me nuts. there is just a complete lack of organization in there. and not exactly the cleanest establishment. i walked out last time i was there because the kid made my salad without putting on gloves....

handling meats, veggies etc with out gloves. no thank you.

the manager just lets her staff run roughshot all over that place. 

thanks but no thanks.
I really think its the gloves thing that got me. everything else i could deal with but thats just tooo much for me.",pXKT_UKT2JCgTGuw0OBhbw,0,0,2,TmfNsu4BrlMr3S-IeGP3BQ
