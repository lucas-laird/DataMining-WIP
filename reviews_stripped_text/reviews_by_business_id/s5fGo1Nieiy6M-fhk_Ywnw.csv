My family and I used to come here when we wanted a quick fix for Chinese food and it tastes so much better than Panda express.

I have been around trying other Chinese food joints and restaurants but nothing truly compares to what they have here. Its even remotely close to a Bank Of America, a food for less, stop and shop and not too far from trader joes so if you're grocery shopping in the area or need a bank those would also be the places to hit up.

The food is definitely worth the money that you pay for it. Its cheap but the food is AMAZING for the price its at.",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,0,0,5,FNs9mZcIo19D0lP--sZ5Bg

A true mom-and-pop style spot with both Hawaiian and Chinese dishes- it's rare to find anything over $10 here, and if you do, it's more than one meal's worth of food.

The garlic chicken and garlic shrimp are my go-tos, either as a plate (with rice and mac) or bowl (rice and veg), sometimes I'll add on a spam musubi. The lemon chicken is just okay, and I found the saimin super greasy. I hear great things about the malasadas but haven't yet tried them.

The ambiance may be nonexistent, but it's a solid emergency lunch spot- any time I call, they can have an order ready in 10 minutes or less, and $10 or under. Service is polite but very quiet.

""When would you like it?""

That's the FIRST thing that comes to mind when I think about my review for Gourmet Wok.  I found this place through some searching around my immediate work area and, being the diligent Yelper I am, wanted to try something new.

I haven't been so excited to try a new place in awhile!  I get excited when I find diamonds in the rough, and I think that's a fair assessment of this place.

Their prices are great and it's insanely fast.  I ordered, drove over there (~4 minutes) and my food was already bagged and ready for me.

I've tried the veggie egg foo yung and kung pao chicken here.  They are both different styles than what I'm used to, but good nonetheless.  Portions are a good size, and $4.25 for a lunch special?  Come on, bro - why even bother with McDonald's?  Cheap, fast, healthy.  Sold.

The lady at the counter is always really nice too.  One time I called in and she asked for my name and she laughed and said, ""You have a very expensive name.""

ALSO: They have boba tea!  Yay!  Close boba tea!  Not great for my low-sugar diet, but that's ok.  =)",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,4,4,5,eW2lO3Ec7a8_0jLyg3o3hw

I like their food and they're so close to home. Looks like we've tried a few things so far. Today's chicken BBQ lunch plate prompted me to tell about them. Good variety in their menu. Of course I haven't tried everything. But my regards to what I have thus far.

They have malasadas here! I recall some of my Hawaiian friends craving that stuff. It's served hot and delicious, full of sweet tooth amore. I'm soooooo glad they serve saimin noodles. I gotta thing for comfy soup. They're gonna help me out with that on those days I'm needy. I don't believe in cheat days guys. But FYI spam and eggs with rice is found here too! Spam is such a childhood icon for me. And lastly, very moist BBQ chicken with just right sweetness and not overly charred.

Lunch specials are just under $5 bucks, and they're pretty good. You get an eggroll, that actually tastes fresh, instead of that premade stuff everyone serves, a big pile of fried rice, and your entree. Portions are huge, like at some places, but it's certainly filling, and for the price, you just can't beat it.

This was not that place.

My husband and I ordered chicken fried rice, chicken wings, garlic chicken, beef and broccoli, and spicy pepper pork chops. I think each item was about $5. We just drove up and placed a take out order. The staff was nice. Everything seemed made to order. And, it was ready in about 10 minutes or so.

The positives pretty much end there.

Chicken wings were OK. Usually places deep fry the wings. This place coats them in a batter and then deep fries them. The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without. The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage. My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good, but not really garlicky. And, the beef and broccoli was just...gross. It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items. Neither one of us could even look at it. I didn't try it. It went directly into the trash.

Bottom line, the prices are average, the food very far below average.  The family combos are the best deal. The dinner combo for 2 at $22.95 was enough for 3, maybe 4 if one person doesn't try all of the items.

We tried:
- Egg rolls
- fried wonton
- shrimp puff
- egg flower soup
- combination fried rice
- orange chicken
- teriyaki chicken

The egg rolls were just ok... too greasy and the filling was a bit on the mushy side, not enough textural contrast since the wrapper wasn't as crispy as I'd like.

Fried wontons are insignificant filler

Shrimp puff was surprisingly good, though over-fried.  I wasn't expecting the filling to be curry, but it was pleasant.  If they could fry it less so it's not so painful to eat that would be my favorite appetizer.

The egg flower soup was your standard egg drop soup, too gelatinous for my taste.  I added some chicken stock and it was better

The combination fried rice was our favorite.  It's very well seasoned and has a pleasant texture.  I have to say it's the best fried rice I've had in this town yet.

The orange chicken was overcooked, dry and the sauce was too mild.

The chicken teriyaki was almost good... but the chicken was too dry.  Extremely dry.  The sauce was tasty but gelatinous.  It was served on a bed of broccoli which I wasn't expecting, and oddly enough was the best part of the meal!  It was steamed well but had enough bite to not be mushy and tasted fantastic with the teriyaki sauce.

Overall, very poorly executed food.  The sauces that could have saved the meal instead added nothing to it, and what they do to chicken is criminal.

If I ever order from here again it will be the fried rice.",-9RHYKu7u8eXrL1oTu36_w,0,0,1,Z5pPQAqGQQGNaMz4pIRukw
