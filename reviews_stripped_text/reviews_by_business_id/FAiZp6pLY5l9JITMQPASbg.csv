246080,2017-08-30,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"We enjoyed our drinks and dinner on a busy Saturday night.  There were four of us so we tried a bunch of items (tapas style).  The biggest winners were the beet salad, chicken wings and sliders.  The steak was good but a little chewy.  GF pizza was way to salty (egg pizza).  Pork belly was just ok. 2 of us loved the truffle fries and 2 did not care for them, they were very soggy.  And the meat and cheese plate was nice, but cheeses were a bit boring.  

Drinks were good.  I do wish they had a better/bigger beer list.  Cocktails that were ordered were nicely made.

Service was good, even on a busy night.  Manager was sure to stop by each table to be sure everything was fine. 

Great addition to the downtown area!",8vvPh09ifKPiq-RKlwSHxg,2,3,4,Tql1DHQRC8FJbSTRTohmxA
253483,2017-11-26,0,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I want to love this place, but just like it. First, the positives. Many dishes are delicious. The cabbage is insanely good, for example.  Service is usually good. Drinks are good. Owner is nice. Second, the negatives. During one visit, the chefs were all touching their faces, hair, noses, etc. and eating while cooking. Just gross.  Then today, I ordered the ""king crab"" benedict. Disaster. 1. It doesn't mention ham on menu and I never expected they'd add meat (so didn't ask, my bad), but it came out with some ham. For some, maybe a positive? But I don't eat ham (ovo-lacto-pescatarian). 2. They made it again but the egg was see-through raw. 3. When they re-did it (again), egg was still undercooked (no, poached does not equal raw). This issue was  made worse by the mayonnaise-y slop they used for ""crab."" I get that crab is expensive but one small egg dish for $19 should come with real crab - or at least a crab cake to vary the texture (mayonnaise/ raw egg / hollandaise = redundant and nasty, even though the hollandaise itself was delicious).",CuE-FeQ_3BMGdfxG2ViuqA,1,0,3,MdbfEkrMw7ZPxBeSOJ7ygA

Some people in our party ordered the ""Oscar"" which is when the mixologist comes to your table and creates a a handcrafted drink tailored to your liking. Oscar created a beautiful drink complete with an oregano garnish held up with a small close-pin. When he delivered the drink to our table, he explained what hue used to create it. He also brought a blow torch and toasted the oregano garnish right in front of is. Everything that we ordered from the menu was amazing. Everything from the roasted carrots to the B.T.L.A toast. The service was amazing. All of the staff were very nice and accommodating. I ordered iced tea which was not technically on the menu. Our server made hot tea and the put ice into just for me. I have never had such an amazing experience as this one. This is the place to go for amazing food, drinks, and service.

There was hair/fuzz on my food I didn't even bother bringing it up because at that point I was at capacity. We were literally the only party in the restaurant. Just us. Still took 45 mins to get food. Except for one of us who got to eat promptly but alone. The backup waitress thought she was funny when she asked if we wanted to leave when she brought the check- but we did want to leave. I did not even wait to leave the restaurant to write a review. We were waiting on the check- forever. And ever. Unfortunately the food was pretty great but not great enough to ever come back to this disaster.,3rPCqSkn2Mzuhr6LWaDRpQ,0,0,1,SHd5Hu8-aEaTAHfgL3XF0g

1030481,2017-11-11,5,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I am blown away by everything here. I think I found my new favorite spot downtown!

FOOD: I swear you can't order a bad dish at this restaurant. The duck pot pie (although a little salty) is deliciously made. It has the perfect amount of duck to flakey crust ratio. The Lemonfish ceviche was a very light option and I loved it. The white truffle toast is to die for. It is super hot so be careful when taking that first bite. If you ask for extra toast, they will certainly bring you some.

DRINK: Their bar is so cute and I love trying their specialty drinks.

ATMOSPHERE: The tables are a little small, but it is super cute. All of the decor creates this certain ambiance that makes it feel like you're not in Las Vegas. The staff is super friendly. They kindly will explain the menu to you and frequently check up on you to make sure you like your food.

The manager checked in constantly to ensure we were treated right.  We got the Margarita pizza for kids, the oxtail toast was killer, the octopus with prosciutto was good but a bit salty.  The beet salad was good, though goat cheese softened down a bit too much for my taste bhds.  The duck confit was memorable, I'd get two of those, just like the oxtail toast.

On another note...

This place could simply be so much better than the ""trying to be cool"" younger brother to other big league restaurants. Just be authentic (owner), and not just another Glutton wasting space in an otherwise desirable location.

This last weekend we finally got our date night and decided to try. 1st let me say that our waiter was very nice and paid attention to our needs and for that I give 3 stars. I am all about the service. The food: all I can say is that we were both disappointed. I ordered the burger med rare, and it was pretty much raw, however, I can overlook that, but what I can not overlook is the tastelessness and t  greediness of the burger. There were no seasonings used while preparing this portion of the meal and maybe that is because they used all of the salt on my husbands entree, the chicken wings. My husband offered to switch meals after I couldn't bare to eat my burger and that was a mistake. The saltiness of the wings was so overpowering that I could eat even one. We both tried the parmesan fries and I can honestly say that they were the best part of the meal, however very garlicky, but I like garlic. 
So will we ever return, probably not. To me, it's not worth the money spent.",rGTigI4JKsS7zdcvmjtjWA,0,1,3,tPWIowk36ZKURFO-yq8oJw

Food:  Definitely fusion as they ceviches and Pizza vis a vis Tapas with a flair, they do have a full bar and they serve cocktails as well. Great after work hang out.

Overall : Great place to socialize and to unwind with friends and co workers, unfortunately not really for kids as the food is more geared towards tapas and drinks.

1568965,2017-11-19,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"We arrived at 12:30 expecting a wait -- and was surprised by how slow it was for brunch on a Saturday. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and ambience. The outdoor seating was delightful and the restaurant was definitely bigger than expected. 

When we first arrived we were greeted with friendly smiles. After being walked to our table -- we noticed that all four chairs were dirty... full of cheese or crumbs of some sort. The busser cleaned and wiped them dried for us and apologized. No big deal, then I open my roll of silverware and my fork was dirty....  This was a bad first impression. However, my impression was quickly turned around as soon as our server came. 

He was extremely helpful and explained everything on the menu. I mean, EVERYTHING. Every item was unclear as to what is being served, or how it's prepared. So the server definitely knew his stuff. 

He recommended the the peach salad - which was very tasty and delicious. The honey drizzle and pesto made the dish a savory one. The combinations just worked for us. Really light and a great starter. 

Next came the avocado toast - nothing extraordinary. It's a big piece of sourdough, with avocados, an egg, and lemon dressing. Tasted like any other avocado toast. Topped with a 63 degree egg. 

The entrees came shortly after: Fried chicken wings and breakfast pizza. The wings were twice battered/fried, Making them extra crispy. The ""house dust"" has a little bit of spice to it, and was super tasty! It's served with some honey sauce -- which again tied together the entire dish well. A side of habanero hot sauce is served with it if the ""house dust"" didn't have enough kick to it. 

The pizza was surprisingly soft. The Bacon was tasty and the eggs were scrambled. The crust was delicate yet still holds the items without fail. 

All and all, I would definitely come back and try their dinner menu. It looks like there's more of a selection available for dinner.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,1,1,4,xqO0DqXbRMmxRx7ExFQnPg
1573817,2018-01-03,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"Came here for date night with my boyfriend one Sunday evening. We were immediately helped by a very welcoming server named Kwani (or Kwami? sp?). He was very accommodating and friendly. My boyfriend had a few questions about the place and he was great at responding and happy to answer all the questions, we felt very comfortable! The dinner menu we were handed felt limited, but Kwani was great at recommending choices for us. It is a bit on the pricier side, and since it is tapas style it is smaller portions. But if you don't mind that and just want quality food & service you will appreciate this place. We ended up ordering the Braised Oxtail Toast and Lamb Sausage Pizetta. The Oxtail Toast was so damn good, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Considering going back and just getting 5 orders of the Oxtail Toast, I honestly think I would be good with just that.

As for drinks, we noticed on the menu the ""Oscar"", which was actually a consultation with the bartender/mixologist Oscar. Since I'm always indecisive, I decided to try it out and Oscar came over to our table and asked me a few personal questions to understand my preference. He asked me questions like: what kind of food I like to eat, if I preferred sweet over savory, etc. I told him I love fruity & herbal flavors and he told me he had the perfect drink for me! It fit my expectations perfectly and I loved it. 

The owner also came to our table to check up on us and chat with us for a little. Overall, food was great, experience was great, and customer service was 5/5. I have yet to try their brunch, but I would definitely recommend for night hangs/dates!",sCoNxq3c42lA3hRBSFav7g,1,1,5,97N7C1NUiyA_CSyU54eLoA

Its their opening week, so everything screamed new, clean, and shiny. Impressed for sure. The owner or chef came to visit us and checked up on us, as well as opening suggestions and feedback. 

Food is served tapas style, so everything is portioned smaller but pretty satisfying. The white truffle toast is to die for, it was delicious! Beet salad was tangy but distinct. Cfc chicken was great, I love spicy and the spice on this chicken is perfect. They do add a smal side of honey to dip, so it balances the spice with sweet. Last but not least, the duck pot pie!!

BRUNCH REVIEW

Drinks:
I'am Smashed
-Very easy drinking, smooth cocktail
Blood Orange Bubbles
-The OJ overpowers any flavors of blood orange which was disappointing, but it was served in a wine glass so I was happy with the pour!

Food:
C.F.C. Wings
-So good! They are served with a mini bottle of hot sauce and honey, which complements the wings perfectly. 

DINNER REVIEW

Drinks:
Poema Cava 
Sculpin IPA 
Dirty Titos Martini
-It came out looking pink which really threw me off, but it's just the olives they use. It tasted just as it should.

Food:
Grilled Pear + Burrata 
Braised Oxtail Toast
Duckling Pot Pies
Charred Octopus

All of the food was delicious, but the star of the night was the duckling pot pies. They would work great as an entree for one or appetizer to share with the table. The only bummer was that they only offer one dessert at this time, that didn't sound all that interesting, but our server told us they are working on a partnership with Donut Bar which would be so cool!

1694606,2017-08-12,4,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"If a restaurant experience were rated on food alone, 7th&C would be an easy 3or4 stars. Let's be clear--the chefs are on point. While not a religious experience, certainly of quality. 
That service, though? Abysmal. Let's begin...

$30+ markup on their wine, we ordered a bottle of market value $11 wine, a Zinfandel. Price point is mean, vengeful, there's no better explanation. If you're going to list a bargain bin wine, then at least price it at a respectable, modest mark-up. 

False advertising: we ordered the prawn ceviche and were given a sea bass something or other, without explanation. What in the WORLD?!  Example: if I order a hot dog, you do not give me a veggie burger and tell me, ""the burger's better!"" as was done with the sea bass. No sir. And then, after this was brought to their attention and they said sea bass is better so suck it up, did they remove it from the bill? NO. Service and hospitality fail. 

Your business model cannot be: order from the menu, but enjoy whatever we decide to bring you. Excuse me, but **** that noise. And speaking of noise, it's almost impossibly loud in there. A table of six had difficulty hearing one another speak, and might explain for why the waiter(s) had as many screw-ups as they did. 

Again on that bottle of wine, we told the woman who brought us the bottle that only four would be drinking. She proceeds to place 6 glasses and begins pouring. You nodded yes, but were you not listening? You are pouring wine. PAY ATTENTION. 

Finally, that bill. I explained to the woman who took our cash and cards: subtract the cash from the total, put $100 on this red card, and divide the remainder between these two cards. She wrote it down. What came back was double the amount on the remaining two cards, which means they charged at least $40 over the total, including tip. 
Did they pocket the cash?? That included tip! Literally half an hour later, it was somewhat sorted out. A half hour! Where we were also challenged as to whether we had mathed right. This was the simplest bill ever. Before launching, or before putting new people on the floor, was there any training? The owner, who was the epitome of graciousness upon arrival, conveniently disappeared once things got hairy. Funny that. 

Last but certainly not least, the food. We did enjoy. We had the CFC Wings, and the braised oxtail which was the winner for most of us, just excellent. The sliders, which while the fried onion added respectable flare (killed it really), these were still just sliders. Difficult to do that well, but certainly good, nonetheless. The hearth oven bread stole the visual scene as it dominated its own plate, and the dippings were ALL aces. Good show, there. The grilled peach and burrata salad was also a favorite, plate-scraping good. Several of us hadn't experienced burrata before, but now we're married to it. Just a delightful combination on that arrangement. 

So there it is. Good food, but ruinous service. Who needs that hassle, and to be charged for something they didn't even order, and to wait 30 minutes to pay and get out? 
I won't be back. 7th&C will either square itself away, or go the way of its locational predecessor.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,8,3,2,KoYg-RjUjKxf-GmToLScmA

Wings are very good and crunchy. Had the ceviche, good kick and chips. You have to try the burger bites, very good side sauce. Sat in the patio in very nice evening, great ambience. Off menu desert was delicious. I would give this place 4 of 5 stars but their water was not good. Obviously using tap water, was very disappointing from that end.

I'm excited to go back and try the other things I didn't get to this time. The wine list could use a little bump, but the cocktail menu was on point. The food menu is great because there is something for everyone. American Fusion if you will. We sat at the kitchen bar, so we could see all the action, which was nice and warm since it was super cold outside. I was able to try the pair and burrata salad, the bread with dips, and the wings. By far the Shining Star of my night was the bread. The yogurt dip is more like lebneh  then tzatziki, the baba ganoush and hummus were awesome! It's the wood fired flatbread that made it such a treat. I could eat that all day everyday. The service was outstanding everyone was super nice and knowledgeable, and I know I'll be back soon.

1772326,2017-08-14,4,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"The only reason I increased my rating to two stars rather than one is the actions of the manager, Liam, who came to the table as we were finishing our meal to find out how everything was. When we described our experience, he immediately offered to comp the meal and invited us to come back another time to try and make things right. He gets mensch points for that and an increase from one star to two.
But that is being really very generous on our part. We made a reservation for 4 people. We got there about 5 minutes early for our reservation. Instead of getting a table, they offered us four chairs at a communal high top that was occupied by several other people already. That was a non-starter for us. They then offered us a table by the window where the sun was baking in and making the table really unusable. They had no shade to cover the window and make the seating at that table not even close to reasonable. Next they moved two small tables from a long setup and offered to seat us there. That was acceptable until they told us that we would have to eat in under 20 minutes because they needed that table for someone else. Not a great start to the evening. We did finally get them to jerry-rig a table for 4 that was acceptable although less than good.
After a few minutes, our server came by to explain that about one third of the items on the menu were no longer available and they were out of several other items. They were busier than expected and they don't get food deliveries on a Sunday. Not sure why that should be my problem but they were not many items to choose from on an already limited menu.  She left  to allow us to look over  the few remaining items that were left on the menu. She next came back to the table about 20 minutes later. We would take a couple of the pizettas and the hearth oven bread with dip. Those were theoretically still on the menu. But not for us. We were in a bit of time crunch because we had theater tickets. Our server explained that the oven is incredibly small and the food couldn't possibly come out in a timely fashion. About the only thing left on the menu that we could order was the flat iron steak and the salmon. The steak came out first when we had about 10 minutes left before we had to leave. It was room temperature at best. And the quality of the meat could only be described as heimlich material. Despite the fact that it was an incredibly small portion for a $21 entree portion, the four of us couldn't finish it. It really was not edible. It came with a side of fries. The fries were also room temperature and soggy. Despite the fact that by this time we were really hungry, we couldn't finish those either. The salmon made an appearance about 5 minutes before we had to leave. The salmon was room temperature, overcooked and dried out. 
Bottom line: failure to honor a reservation, absolutely terrible service, and food that could not be eaten, even with being comped I feel I overpaid for the meal. I will not be returning.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,9,2,2,oUSL2RyJ3yzyaGFMgJgUBg

1893076,2017-08-13,11,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I've been looking forward to dining at 7th & Carson for literally weeks- everything on the menu sounds like it was made for my particular taste buds! I planned a date night here, then scrapped it because a duo wouldn't be enough to try all the dishes I wanted. So an evening was planned for a group of six.

The highlight for me was the Oxtail Toast, a generous portion of thick, crusty bread topped with a mix of stewed meat in an rich beer-based gravy with curds- comfort food to the max! This pairs well with the Grilled Peach and Burrata salad, which ranks competitively against other versions I've tried due to the addition of fresh pesto, which pops vibrantly against the sweet peaches and creamy cheese. The simple-sounding sliders were also a hit, with perfectly-fried onions that made me think of what my imaginary private chef would make if I were craving White Castle. These three dishes alone would make for a satisfying, summery meal.

The Hearth Oven Bread with 4 dips is a huge, charred bread round with a slight zatar-like seasoning. Ours was soggy on bottom from a bit too much oil, which was unnecessary given the accompanying dips, all solid on their own. Our only foray into the seafood offerings was the Prawn Ceviche, which we were only later informed was actually sea bass- not that we didn't notice but that this was not disclosed until we inquired, which is odd considering the chef's seafood background. The dish itself was lackluster and a larger portion (sans an awkward tablespoon-sized side of unseasoned mashed avocado) would have been more appropriate for the price given the protein downgrade. The bread I'd get again if dining as a group but the seafood situation left a bad taste in my mouth.

I can overlook a few missteps at a new restaurant, but service comes down to training and experience. Kevin L's review details these issues further but my major takeaway is to bring cash when splitting the bill. It was a comedy of errors that took three staff members and literally half an hour to resolve- and that time cost me additional fees in the form of the parking ticket I got for being late to my meter! This was after requesting the staff to expedite the solution given my schedule. I'm all for teachable moments but a manager really should have stepped in after this situation exceeded the fifteen-minute mark.

The food is thoughtful and beautiful, and I really do like having a modern tapas concept downtown even if I don't often venture down that area. I'll eventually be back to check out the duckling pot pies and fried chicken wings on their garden patio, but I'm going to have to find a few new friends to take... and an ATM to hit on the way over.

1896152,2017-11-04,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"Don't waste your time or money by going to 7th & Carson. During our meal we experienced nothing special or worth ever going back for. The prices averaged around $2.50/bite (too expensive) and then most dishes were very poorly executed (cooking technique was lacking). 

ITEMS ORDERED:
The grilled peach and burrata salad was a huge miss (1 out of 10). The peaches were hard and bitter making the dish inedible. Uncooked butternut squash would've been an upgrade, it was that bad. The wings were okay (4 out of 10), nothing that's hardly cravable. The spice blend that's dusted on the wings tasted exactly like a Pork Butt rub I bought at Costco and put on my ribs that I smoke at home, literally, exactly like it. The smoked pork belly was the best dish we ordered still nothing special (5 out 10), 3 pieces of pork belly sitting on top of blue cheese and a pork chicharron; could've greatly benefited from some sweetness and acid to counter the richness and saltiness of the pork and blue cheese. Our bill total was $57.63 (w/o tip) for 3 pieces of pork belly, soggy fries, 4 wings doused in pork butt rub, and bitter hard peaches. That also included 2 diet cokes, 2 ginger beers and ZERO alcoholic drinks. 

Other notes: one person in our party ordered the flat iron steak. I shit you not, there's more meat in a Big Mac than there was on her plate. When it was brought out I honestly thought the kitchen split the steak onto two plates. I'd be shocked it the serving size was over 4oz. Even more shocking was the $21 they charged for it. 

7th & Carson - You're tenure will resemble that of a Pop-up if changes (prices, food quality, technique) aren't made soon . I don't see this place making it to or through the summer.

Glutton was way better than 7th & Carson and anyone wanting to try this place, please do yourself a favor and call/make a reservation at Carson's Kitchen. You're welcome!

1961996,2018-01-15,0,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"Three and a half stars. Excellent food, but a tad overpriced for ""tapas-style"" eating. Had the sliders, gnocchi, charred octopus, braised oxtail toast and flank steak. Everything was superb - my favorite was the gnocchi. I would recommend ordering everything EXCEPT for the steak. Not that it wasn't good - it was - but you will definitely feel cheated the moment they set the plate on your table - as you realize you are paying $22 for 4 small (approx 1.5"" x 1.5"" x .5""inch) pieces of steak and a handful of fries, on the side. Not even L'Atelier serves their steak that small. Sheesh. I realize it was pricey because of the ""truffle butter,"" but I think the addition of this butter is gilding the lily. They could've just gone with an herbed butter or something. For a small downtown place, they are charging Strip prices.  

Everything on the menu looked interesting - but am wary of the portioning - as it's neither here nor there. The oxtail toast, for example was fairly substantial. The gnocchi was a tad on the small side, and so was the charred octopus. The table beside us ordered the bread with dip - and that was huge - and seemed like it was providing some bang for your buck. 

Our server (lucky us) was a bit of a space cadet - not only did she get our order wrong - twice - she mistakenly billed us for something that never came. Sigh. 

Also, don't make the mistake of thinking that just because it's ""tapas-style"" that you'll get your order fairly quickly - as the steak we ordered was an afterthought and that took, no kidding, about 20 minutes. 

I would recommend the servers asking ahead what the hunger levels are, as well as perhaps explaining the size per order. In a traditional ""tapas"" place - there's usually just one plate size, or at the very least two - and the problem with this place is that order sizes are a crapshoot - some, like the bread and dip or the oxtail toast are fairly substantial; while others - like the flank steak - is ridiculously small. 

It's ""heart"" is in the right place, though - they just need to work out the kinks and rethink the portions in relation to the $$ charged. This is, after all, not the first complaint about how small the plates/serving portions are in relation to its price.",QnUNIVyaCPx0wBgrWftsDw,0,0,3,I-R6rlW6L-5c_wQ_oLFmHg

I put my taste buds in his hand and ordered an Oscar, which is essentially him making you a unique cocktail.  He asked what I just ate, looked at what I was wearing, asked about what I like and what I was in to.  From that he walked me through what he was making me.  He took a bit of this and a bit of that, most of which I had never heard of before and mixed it all together, tasting and commenting on it and deciding if it needed something more or not.  After about 7 or 8 ingredients it was ready but not quite.  Earlier on he asked me if I liked cinnamon to which I responded, ""yes but not so much in drinks"".  He set some cinnamon bark on fire, put a cup over it, and let it fill with smoke.  He told me to smell it before each sip.  It worked perfectly.

Had high expectations for 7th & Carson based on the reviews.  We usually enjoy tapas style menus.  We arrived on time for our 8 PM Friday night reservation, and were promptly seated - outside.  That was not our request on this cool desert evening.  It could've worked if they'd had heaters or blankets, but inexplicably, for a popular restaurant in the desert in January - no.  

Ok, my wife ordered hot water and put on her shawl, and we perused the menu.  House specialties were heirloom tomato salad, braised oxtail toast, and smoked pork belly. A tasty sounding flatiron steak was also on the menu.  We tried ordering each of these, and were told they were out of every one.  Friday night, Las Vegas, prime dining time - their out of these specialty and routinely popular items.  Once our server deigned to visit our table, about 10 minutes after being seated, we ordered the ceviche, the duck wing pot pie, the pear burrata salad, and the salmon with squid-ink infused quinoa.  The ceviche was very good, with a guacamole spread, but the house-made chips were soggy and chewy.  The salad was tasty, as was the salmon, although the seasoning on the quinoa was rather bland.  The filling in the small, pizza-roll sized pot pies was excellent, with tasty seasoning and a good balance of carrots and peas.  However, the puff pastry was undercooked and doughy, ruining the taste and mouth feel of the dish.

The manager or owner was quite visible all evening, scurrying around the patio and in and out of the interior, but never once stopping at a guest table to inquire about perceptions of the food or service.  He might as well have been managing a McDonalds.

For our salad, we had pear with burrata salad, followed by Legs and eggs, a tiny tempura crab bit topped with caviar and wasabi aioli and microgreens.

We arrived and easily got a table. Everything on the menu looked mouth watering.  When the waitress came to our table she informed us that everything was tapas style. That was fine, we are regulars at several tapas places around town. 
We ordered the Arugula, Grilled Pear and Burrata Salad - fresh taste with a great honey citrus dressing. 
The sliders, which were so good I never got a bite. 
The tuna tartare - delicious, but a small portion, the Lemonfish ceviche.... probably my favorite but again a small portion. We also tried the truffle cheese, another small serving and the Gnocchi, nice size for all 4 of us to try. Drinks were good and the service was great. 
The one drawback, for the prices charged, you would have expected the portions to be a bit bigger. Not a typical oversized portion that most restaurants serve these days, but enough for four people sharing to all enjoy more than one or two bites.

I was promptly greeted and sat in the corner even though my name isn't Baby.  The best part of the corner table is that there was a TV right on the wall perfectly positioned in the corner so I was able to enjoy catching glimpses of plays of the weekend's wildcard football game when our conversation got boring.  Upon looking at the menu my stomach made my decision for me and I selected the Downtown Dubliner Burger.  The description said something about ""whiskey something something bacon something something dark side"" so I knew what I was having.  The burger came out shortly thereafter and the combination of the onion jam and gooey dubliner cheese was terrific.  Very filling and quite tasty.  During our meal, the manager came by and introduced himself and made us feel like the most important people in the place.  It's this type of table side manner that impresses me most during my visits to establishments.

It's all small plates so we had variety sharing plates. I didn't know what the heck a 'pizetta' was...turns out it's just a small thin crust pizza! Anyhoo, the lamb sausage pizetta was super tasty with a perfectly crispy base. I found out the sausage was a little garlicky on my breath later on. The fried chicken is the best I've had ever! With the spicy sauce and honey, amazing. And you just have to try the duckling pot pies. You won't be sorry.

Cocktails were very good but inconsistent. The spicy watermelon cocktail was a little too tangy but still good the first time. I assumed that it was supposed to be that way. The second one was perfect with more subtle watermelon flavour - much more natural tasting and peppery notes. They have a short but well selected wine list.

For a dining experience like this, and the head count at our table, this place pulled off a miracle.

2821846,2018-04-22,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"This review is about the service.
So i came here on a saturday night with a reservation and sat at the bar in front of the chefs/cooks where they prepare the food. Not the drink bar but the bar in front of the oven and food prep. I was a single woman and the only person sitting at that bar for most of my time there.
After i was sat by the hostess and given a menu, not one person of the three men from behind the bar spoke to me. Zero acknowledgement. No greeting. Radio silence. I was actually going to get up and leave until the waitress came by FINALLY.
Aside from being butt-hurt and left to fend for myself, the food is good but the reception for a single woman sitting at the bar leaves much to be desired. 
And during my solitary meal, not one of the people behind the bar asked how my food was or any normal interaction. I get that they are perhaps focused on the food and can't multitask but really? 
It is always a tad daunting to be female and dining solo but i did not expect the silent treatment. I dine alone often and i eat out even more frequently. So I have a LOT of experience with service as a single female at the bar. Not once have i ever been treated, rather IGNORED at a restaurant. 
I will only comment on one dessert that everyone raves about. The rest of my food was ok. 
The panna cotta dessert. It was tasty but prepared too much like a creme brulee with the crackly carmelized sugar on top but minus the eggs. And whipped cream upon cream? I would prefer to break up the flavors and textures more. 
Anyways, i wish i had nicer things to say because the food i had was legit good but my experience was notably marked by the above service and frankly unacceptable.",ZusxSEWQy2HgE0mgf4EsbQ,2,2,1,UBNz3vNHRiO1PCBLgwD1-g

You have to enter thru the garden for the entrance. They seated us at the bar where the cooks are. And it took a little while to get service even waters but the place was filled, we came in during A busy time I guess. 

Items we got;
Braised Oxtail Toast- wow uhmaaazing! The toast was crispy and the oxtail was tender. There was a good amount of meat on top of the toast. It had great flavors.
CFC wings- the chicken was extra crispy and it comes with habanero sauce and honey. The best way to eat it is put a bit of sauce and dip it in the honey so it's not so spicy. 
Duckling Pot Pies- who would've thought that duck pot pies would be delicious. Very tender, wanted more instantly after I finished it. 
Lemonfish ceviche- a very small dish. Comes with sweet potato chips. It was so good but not enough to satisfy my craving. 
Legs and Eggs- tempura crab legs with caviar. This is actually the first time I ever tried caviar and it went perfectly with the dish. It came with some sort of sauce that complimented the dish so well. 

For dessert we got the salted butterscotch panna cotta, that was the best part of the meal! It tasted so good, not so sweet. The perfect way to end the meal!",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,9,8,5,6W6P5VdQ-tBcsF-lgMWBhQ

First issue we ran into was that they didn't have any of the beers they listed on the menu that I had asked for.  It was a bit disappointing but after three tries I settled on a bottled beer our waitress recommended.  We ordered the oxtail toast and duck pot pie.  We had intended to stay here for our entire meal but, after the oxtail toast came out, we were just so completely underwhelmed.  The toast is a wonderful sounding concept and we were excited to try it.  When it arrived, it looked as delicious as it had sounded on paper but, after the first bite, it just did not live up to the hype- or its $15 price tag.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay,  the ingredients were there, but I don't know if there was an issue with seasoning or what, but there was just nothing to make the flavors pop.  We were hoping the duck pot pies would be different but it too fell flat.

Service was a little weird too.  I got this feeling that, after the snafu with the beer, we were being avoided a bit.  The manager also approached us and seemed a little over eager as well, especially in his (unsolicited) descriptions of the food we ordered, which was especially odd because he painted a picture and set an expectation that was just not delivered.

We ended up spending most of our time there searching for the next place to go to downtown, paying our bill and then moving on to somewhere else.",0fKmCIvKlkXwBZU44D0umg,2,0,3,crWVksc9SQjPSvRqZbsUdQ

Seating arrangement was cramped near the window. Waitress seemed like this was her first time, but tried to play the part. The one item that I found unique was the duck pot pie, but unfortunately, they were ""sold out"". Waitress proceeds to explain how it always sells out. In my mind I'm thinking, well doesn't that mean you should start preparing more so customers are not disappointed? My date orders two tapas dishes and I order some dish that was suggested by the waitress since I didn't get my duck pot pie. My dates two meals come out and we share. They were just ok. Nothing to report on the food. Just being honest. The waitress disappears for some time while we are wanting condiments and wondering where my dish is. She finally shows back up and I inquire about my meal and she says, ""oh I thought you didn't want it"". I blank stare because I was hungry and speachless. She then offered to put the order in now as it was about time for us to leave and catch a show. My mind was blown. I'll never return here.

Last night after the Zappo's ABFAN art show we sauntered on over. The restaurant was pretty full so we sat at the bar. Justin, the bartender, regaled us with pretty picturesque drink creations. He then made the perfect Moscow Mule with candied ginger garnish and bitters. My husband drank the signature ""I'm smashed"" drink, and a person next to us had charred cinnamon in his tequila mixture. Justin is so warm and accommodating with customers- what a gift he is!!

We had tried so much before but this time we has our oxtail toast and margherita pizza but decided to try Legs and Eggs- crab legs, caviar, and multiple seasonings. Oh it was better than anything!! This dish is a tapas plate and I could have gone for four more.

So just get over here and be part of this glorious restaurant!! 


We were already huge fans of the artistry of Chef Gregg Fortunato when he wowed us with his superior delicacies at the former Inyo in Chinatown. Gregg's gifts are now in plain view at the new restaurant, 7th and Carson.
The setting is perfect for illustrating his magical creations. We invited friends to join us, and we were thrilled by the Hot Melons cocktail ( tequila, habanero syrup, watermelon, lemon and cracked pepper), oxtail toast, duck pot pies, grilled peach with arugala and burrata, white truffle toast, Dubliner burger, prosciutto pizzetta, and wines.
There was an amazing panacotta for dessert. 
We all four left, bowing to Gregg and the wonderful staff, dazed by the fabulous experience.
As we were finishing, a group of about 25 LipSmackingTours' progressive diners descended on the restaurant and appeared to be as mesmerized as we had been.
If Inyo had previously been our favorite place to bring new diners, now 7th and Carson is the top of our list.

Since their concept (like every other new restaurant) is shared social plates, the four of us ordered a few things to split. The lavender French toast was really good, and so was the peach salad with poached egg. The other two plates we had I can remember so I don't think they were mind-blowing. They were out of the Benedict and that was a little disappointing since that's one of the main reasons we wanted to come. Also disappointed that their OJ isn't freshly squeezed because I had a giant hankering for that too. 

The service was a little off. The server had no support staff, and she wasn't able to handle her 4 tables easily. After eating the dish with a runny egg, I asked if we could have fresh plates, and it didn't happen until our last dish had come out.

Another nice addition to downtown Las Vegas. Situated adjacent to Container Park,, the location is perfect so that you get the feel of Fremont but you're not overwhelmed by it. They have a nice interior with seating, bar, and TVs as well as an outdoor, dog-friendly patio with about a dozen tables. Considerably large for the area. 

The menu is a tapas menu for the most part with items typically in the $11-13 range. I would say 2 plates/person is optimal. Drinks are on the more expensive side with beers running $8 and wines beginning at $11 they also have a few cocktails but a considerably small menu on that portion. 

Of the courses I had, I would say the oxtail toast was the best. It had a short rib consistency which was very nice on a sharp toast. Service was good but honestly considering the patio area where I sat was almost empty, I think he could have been more attentive. 

Overall, a nice addition to the area. Unfortunately there was no Happy Hour from 5-6pm as advertised which is unfortunate as that was one of the main reasons I came for an early meal. But still the menu is cost effective enough that it wasn't too much of an issue. I always like to see drink specials but I guess that's not the sell here.

The second time coming here involved me and thirteen others. We embraced the menu recs of our awesome server, Manuel, and went family-style. You will definitely get a lot of bang for your buck by bringing your groups here. 

I will say that if you are watching your figure, this is not the best choice, as many of the dishes are terrifically carb-heavy. That said, if you are gluten free, this is a great place to have a filling and flavorful night out-- they have many gf options, and can make their pizzas on gluten free crust.

On my hour lunch walk last Friday, I decided to take a walk to this place.  I asked to do a take out order.  I asked if I could order the Chicken n' Waffles seeing that I didn't see it on the lunch menu that was given to me.  I mentioned I saw it on their Brunch Menu (11-3p).  Server said that they only served Brunch on Saturday.  I was kind of disappointed so I ordered the C.F.C Wings (Carson Fried Chicken - $13).  For that price, you would hope it's good right?  

The server comes out with my order and before he closes the box I get a quick glance of what was inside. He points out the chicken, and the 2 sauces in this ""little"" box.  I didn't question anything.  I ended up leaving a tip.

I get back to my office, I open the box and there's only 4 chicken wings.  Puzzled, I'm asking myself is this normal.  I don't think I've been to a place where I was charged $13 for 4 pieces of wings.  For that price at HoOters, I get 10 pieces!  So first I did the calculation.  I paid over $4 and some change for just 1 wing!   Never again!  Extremely disappointed.   This isn't even a fine dining restaurant. 

The wings over all were just okay.  The House Dust rub was just ok.  It didn't seem like it was distributed evenly.  It seemed like it was over powered by breading.  It was thick and crunchy.  The hot sauce was just okay as well.  It was super spicy which left my lips burning.  Mixing in the honey sauce does help a little bit to off set the heat.  I didn't have the ""amazing/awesome"" factor like some others have.  It was different, but not anything satisfying.  

It sucks that my first experience was this way, but I still want to come back for their dinner menu.  Hopefully it does this place justice. 

With that being said, Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,0,3,_wGM3KLxw-q4nYjZ8swgHg

3617409,2017-11-26,10,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I'm such a diva, I'm very temperature sensitive and don't do well in heat so when we got there and had the option to sit out on the patio or inside in the ac, I whined a bit about how hot the patio was so we sat inside in the very cold ac, nice (for me.)  Everyone else was pretty much freezing, though. sorry everyone. ;-)

7th & Carson is the restaurant that took over the space that was the restaurant, ""Glutton"".  It's a tapas menu serving new american style food.  Our server recommended ordering 2 things per person and eat family style,  there were four of us so we ended up with eight plates.

Here are the ones I thought were the standouts:

Braised Oxtail Toast
Fantastic slow beer braised oxtail on a fairly thick piece of toast, topped with curds and smoked sea salt.  This was my favorite I think. Very hearty and flavorful.

Hearth Bread with dips (four)
This was good, too.  The flat bread was lightly crispy on the outside and soft inside.  It was nice having the assortment of dips for the bread for the different people's tastes.  The four dips were Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Red Pepper, and Cucumber Yogurt.

Duckling Pot Pie
Another hearty dish.  Stewed leg meat with peas and carrots in a flaky puff pastry in pinwheel shapes.  Rich and really delicious.

Margherita Pizzetta
I thought this was going to be a small flatbread but it was probably a 12"" pie.  With a chewy slightly charred crust and simple toppings, the flavors defnitely stood out.

Smoked Pork Belly
Rich fatty pork that's smoked, what's not to love.  It came with crumbled blue cheese, chicharrones, and drizzled with a truffle honey.  Very tasty, but a fairly small portion, esp for three seasoned eaters and one picky eater.

The other dishes ordered were also good but not as good as the others:  
Wood Roasted Beets (red and golden beets with whipped goat cheese)  Dubliner Burger (with whiskey onion jam and dubliner cheese)  
Tuna Tartare (with rice crackers and mashed avocado.)

Of these I thought the Tuna tartare was ok, the tuna portion was a bit small compared to the amount of crackers.  I thought the tuna was also on that border between fresh and not fresh.  The burger looked good but the guy that ordered it ate it all himself, he did say it was really good, though.

We did consider dessert but our server told us the Panna cotta hadn't set, this was their only dessert so dessert wasn't an option that evening.  I did suggest serving a panna cotta soup but that was a no-go..hehe.

We did get here early so it wasn't very crowded but from some of the other reviews I've read, it sounds like 7th & Carson hasn't caught on yet.  Hopefully they do because it's very worthy of another visit to try some of the other dishes.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,14,9,4,R5rZ_rLK7G5y_JzXoF8k-g

3636390,2017-11-05,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"My wife and I decided we'd have dinner at one of the restaurants on Carson after an event. We were invited as Founding Members of the Southern Nevada RTC Bike Share program to their 1 Year Anniversary event at Container Park last Friday. We listened to music, saw some friends and neighbors, and had a good time at the party.  Then, we decided to have dinner at either 7th&Carson or Carson Street Kitchen.  We'd been to Carson Street before and enjoyed it greatly.  Tonight, Carson Street appeared to be busy so we decided to try something new to us, 7th&Carson. After all, the place appeared to have plenty of availability.  And, we'd heard really good things about the food from a Yelper friend of ours who is a regular there.  We walked in through the front door.  We were semi-regulars at Glutton (the restaurant in the space before it). We'd celebrated our anniversary there with fabulous meals and drinks.  We knew the space.  Except, this time at 7th&Carson, NOBODY greeted us at all.  In fact, we walked in and looked around the restaurant which seemed empty.  We walked to the back of the restaurant where a woman was standing.  She asked us if we had a reservation.  We told her we didn't and there were only two of us.  Without a beat, she tells us she has no tables available and they were ""very busy tonight.""  She offered us a table in the patio (freezing cold that night) or at the counter.  My wife and I were dumbfounded by this.  The hostess stood there staring at us blankly (the plague of zombie hostesses in this town, I swear. PLEASE HIRE PEOPLE WITH A WELCOMING PERSONALITY).  We weren't sure if this was a practical joke or if she expected a ""honey handshake"" (not happening, honey!) or if she was simply clueless as to the actual reality of what we could visibly see with our very own eyes.  We told her, ""no, thanks!"" and left out the back entrance (which is apparently now the pretentious unmarked front entrance even though the door has a sign that says EXIT clearly marked on it).  Absurd.  Once we left, we talked about how we'd expect this kind of thing from busy, popular restaurants in Los Angeles or NYC.  We know what busy restaurants look like with crowds and lines wrapped around the block, people chain-smoking, or having drinks before a table opens up,  That was NOT the case here. As we walked to have dinner elsewhere, my wife opened up the Open Table app to see there were 6 open tables available in just 9 minutes at 6:30 P.M.  So, either the hostess has no grasp on her tables if she didn't know she had 6 tables available in less than 10 minutes or has been trained to project a non-existent air of exclusivity at a place that doesn't warrant it.  In any case, the food and drinks MAY be good but we won't know as we were refused a table for no apparent reason.  :(",geQNS__22w8hgN6PXgd5WQ,2,1,1,Z8e5e0rDMIQ1evzYO-RFOA

You must order the Oscar cocktail!!

We enjoyed our first drinks so much, we even asked him to make us a dessert cocktail!

For food, we had the peach burrata, tuna tartare, oxtail, and flatiron steak. They were all deliciously prepared by Chef Gregg and his staff while he waves at you from the kitchen. We had a hard time deciding what we wanted to order, and I really don't think you could go wrong!

Chef Gregg, the one and only, the Chef behind the restaurant.  He prepared us for our main entrees, an open face oxtail sandwich and a plate of oven seared octopus; both of which were to die for.

Items we ordered and shared:

Breakfast pizetta
Crustless quiche
Chicken and waffles
Brioche French toast
Irish breakfast
Fish and chips
Tandoori heirloom carrots
7th Street ham and cheese toast

Chef Fortunato is turning out some very good dishes.  I have not had an Irish breakfast before and this was quite good with an assortment of items from beans to 68º eggs to rashers and other items.  Truly something new for me and very enjoyable with the thin toast served with the dish.

The crustless quiche would be another standout.  The quiche was fluffy and the salad with apple and almond served with it was a perfect compliment.  My favorite item of the meal was the heirloom carrots served with yogurt in a spiral and with lightly fried carrot tops dressing the plate.

After recently being disappointed with fish and chips I was served at another restaurant, I was very pleased to have these tasty cubes of fried cod served with fries, house made tartar sauce, and malt vinegar.  A really good dish.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,4,9r5FE9m8iPdcXQj3OhdSeQ

Service: It was a nice evening, so we sat outside with the cool lighting in the patio area.  Our server was friendly when he was with us, but he was preoccupied with taking care of the tables in the building. We ordered 3 food items: Margherita Flatbread, C.F.C. Wings, and the smoked pork belly and asked for the Flatbread to come out first.  40 Minutes later, the Wings and the smoked pork belly came out but we were still missing the flatbread. The table that sat down after us had their Margherita Flatbread at their table.  We inquired with our server and he said ""they didn't bring it out?"" he went inside and came back out with our flatbread.  Drinks came out about 12-15 minutes after we ordered them and were delivered from bar personnel.  We would have gotten another round of drinks in if they came out faster.  No worries.  Our server apologized for the overall service and mentioned how busy he was inside.

Food & Drinky Drinks: Smoked Pork Belly was a dish I went through quickly.  The four C.F.C Wings were fantastic.  They were very tasty inside and out and I can see why it's a fan favorite.  When we got the Margherita Flatbread, it was tasty and made with high quality ingredients which was evident in the taste.  The Hot Melons drink was great!  Tequila Blanco based with the Habanero syrup, pepper and watermelon juice made it a sweet but hot (not spicy) drink.  Great creativity for a great drink.

Ambiance: Very hip warehouse industrial look with bricks, metal and contemporary lighting.  You can see the kitchen from the dining area which personalizes the dining experience.  The patio seating was pleasant with the trees lighted and good tables and chairs for dining.  It's definitely an attractive dining venue and a cool place to be seen.

The service was disappointing on this visit. I think our server tried his best but either they are understaffed or the service synergies between for the kitchen and the bar to the patio for dinner is off. I love Tapas dining and I asked to keep a menu at the table to sample more dishes after our first order.  Unfortunately, because the first order of dishes took so long we didn't get a chance.

4492058,2017-07-28,3,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I was really missing a great restaurant on this corner. And, 7th & Carson swooped in to save the day! They've only been open for a couple of weeks, but they are already killing it. I have already been in several times, and each time the food and service have been outstanding!! The chef here is making really thoughtful dishes that are also beautiful. It has quickly become my new favorite place Downtown and I've been telling everyone to check it out.

Initially I went in for cocktails. My favorite is the Downtown Buzz which is their version of a Bees' Knees. It is delicious. They, also, have beers, wines, and a full bar. And, occasionally, live entertainment. It was a great place to sit and sip cocktails with friends.

Since I've been in several times, I've had a chance to try many of the chef's dishes. Honestly, there's been nothing I haven't loved, but some standouts are the Heirloom Tomato Salad, the sliders, the Braised Oxtail Toast, the Hearthstone Baked Bread with dips, & the CFC Wings. Read on!

The Grilled Peach & Burrata salad was awesome with a basil pesto drizzle, black pepper honey, and the crisp peaches were a lovely vehicle for the creamy burrata. However, the Heirloom Tomato salad with marinated feta was a rock star! The tomatoes were SO fresh and flavorful...some of the best tomatoes I've ever had.

The Hearthstone Baked Bread with Dips 4 Ways was similar to a pita bread, but cooked crisp and puffed up. I enjoyed all of the dips, especially the hummus, but the roasted red pepper was a close 2nd. The other 2 dips were a baba ganoush and a tzatziki.

The sliders are a definite favorite. juicy meat, melty cheese, and warm buttery buns! Get them. Not really anything unique, but each time I've had them they are just flawlessly executed.

The C.F.C. wings are extra crispy and spicy and amazing! Also, they're much larger than you expect an order of wings to be. I'm a bit of a spicy wimp so for me they were exactly perfect amount of spicy that I could take. If you actually enjoy spicy, you'll want to add the habanero honey sauce they come with. I heard it was great, but I wasn't brave enough to try it for myself.

The Charcuterie was nice. It comes with 3 meats, 3 cheeses, olives, honey, fig jam, and toast. A very nice presentation, I only wish it has heavier on the cheese portions.

The Duckling Pot Pies were a huge hit with my group! Piping hot, tender meat, crisp and flaky puff pastry. 

Lamb Sausage Pizzetta is about a 10"" pizza. The crust was thin and crispy. A fair amount of toppings. This is a good dish to share as an app for a group. They have 4 different pizzettas to choose from.

Braised Oxtail Toast. This went so fast! The meat was tender. The toast was crispy, but not too hard. Extremely tasty appetizer.

Green Eggs & Ham came with a flawlessly poached egg. I, personally, don't do runny yolks but I still appreciated the dish.

The Bone-In Half Chicken with Caraway Stuffing and Mustard Jus. Loved this one. It was a pretty simple dish, but again just executed to perfection. I am really picky about stuffing. I usually only like my own. But, I love Caraway and it's a spice I don't come across often in restaurants so I had to try it. It was delicious. I made everyone with me try it. So buttery. Great flavor. Not too dry or too wet. If you're a stuffing snob, you know.

Finally, the Legs & Eggs. Tempura friend crab legs with a dollop of caviar and ponzu dipping sauce. This was my 1st attempt at caviar, so I don't have any comparison there, but I am a huge crab fan. Overall, this dish was delicious.

As much as I love the food here, the service is really what makes this place shine. The servers are on top everything. They truly make you feel welcomed and cared for while you are there, and they do it with a smile. Everyone really seems to enjoy what they're doing and it shows.

We had the pear and burrata salad to start and it was divine! What a magical combination of grilled pear, fresh burrata cheese, arugula, black pepper honey and basil pesto. Delicious! 
My next dish was equally as tasty. The lemon fish ceviche is served with sweet potato chips and I will get this every time I come to 7th and Carson! 
Braised Oxtail Toast was super good and the Flat Iron steak was cooked perfectly! 
The legs and eggs was good... tempura king crab legs with caviar. A bit pricy for those couple of small bites, but super good anyway!!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,3,5,4,NeENHUQ83pJPkudb1voO7Q

Went here with a couple of coworkers for lunch (lunch menu is 11am-3pm) because we've read that it was good and one of my coworkers is a vegan. I enjoy meat, but ended up ordering the Chickpea Burger ($15) and added a side of Parmesan Truffle Fries. The side of fries was in a 3-4oz bowl and seemed enough to share for 2 people. My coworkers ordered the Carson Bisque & Toast ($13) which looked enough for someone who wasn't too hungry and the 7th St. Ham + Cheese Toast. ($11) which looked like a unique take on a much more rich ham & cheese sandwich and looked filling.

The service was great and the owner spoke with us a bit about his spot. The restaurant had a flag from Ireland so I'm assuming if it isn't pride, that maybe some of the food is inspired from there. I could be totally wrong, but what does that matter?! The food was delicious!!!

The owner said happy hour is from 5-6pm for $5 cocktails and beer. So we'll be back one day after work for that. They have a different menu for brunch and dinner, which I'll have to try another day. 

There's street parking you pay for and I believe a parking lot behind the building. It is on the corner across the street from Container Park.

Update: went again on February 28. Sat on the patio for lunch with two people from work and it was cute and beautiful setting.  The service and owner served us and were fantastic. The mushrooms from the pizza were fresh, the pear arugula salad's honey was the perfect touch, and the 4 large crispy wings were great with honey and the habanero sauce. We also ordered the cheese bread tomato soup dip and it was perfect for sharing. I recommend the patio when of course the sun is out.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,2,2,5,M0fSi2ha8bSQw0Y65tvGmA

Once we got there the place was pretty dead, there was maybe only one other table with people. We were helped right away and were told that bottomless bloodys and mimosas were available if we wanted. I passed on the bottomless, but did go with one Bloody which was very good. It was quite spicy so for non spice lovers, be cautious. 

As for food I had the Crab Benedict. The flavor was super good and unique, but I just wish the portion was a bit larger. I think my only complaint about this place is the small amount of food for the price, but it's farm to table so I get it.

Our family was sat promptly on a Sunday evening, and the hostess asked if we had reservations (we didn't). 

Service was perfect; attentive and relaxed. 

Amongst our family, here we're a few reviews on our dishes. 

Smoked Pork Belly was very tasty but a small portion. 

The Oscar Craft C is a perfect way to try a new drink and pair it with your dish. My husband LOVED this unique option. 

The Pink Dragon was yummy, but didn't pair well with the pizza. It's definitely a dessert beverage. Frothy and creamy. 

The Parmesan fries were great. 

The Prosciutto Pizza was a crowd fav, it's about 10 inches in diameter. The egg is the best part!

CFC wings were a little spicy but more of a pepper hot, not jalepeno hot. It comes with hot sauce and honey on the side. 

Our experience overall was amazing, but I'd like to note a few of the portions were small and our food came out as it was prepared. The server did let us know that the food would be staggered, but it made eating dinner together a bit awkward.

My favorite unfiltered dame and I decided to indulge in this nice little drink spot because Yelp suggested really great tapas style food! 

The restaurant itself is intimate with an open kitchen which is pretty unique. The cocktails are well crafted. I ordered a spicy yet yummy melon cocktail.

Service: The ticket time for our food was a lot slower than I anticipated!

Food
Sea: Tuna Tartare $13 great presentation but the portion is so small for the amount of rice crackers provided and cost. I devoured the little jar, I mean the tuna so quickly I barely remember the taste. If I had to take a guess I'm sure it was exceptional like the remainder plates ordered!
Land: Duckling Pot Pies $12 My bestie is a well traveled and an experienced carnivore who raved about the duck pot pie! I have to take her word for it because I don't consume meat. She highly recommends this shared plate so order it and thank me later! 5/5
Oven: White Truffle Toast $9 The truffle was executed very well and I did enjoy the toast but not worth the carbs (don't tell my trainer)!
Oven: Spinach + Mushroom Pizzetta $11 Larger than expected and equally delicious.
Dessert: Panna Cotta This Crème Brulee like dessert was the only dessert of the day and it was delicious and sweet. The whip creme had hints of whisky and the consistency of the whip topping was perfect!

5428904,2017-12-18,2,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"Currently one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas....there was a large group of us so we ordered:

Hearth Oven Bread + Dip - Comes with a nice size pita bread but not pita bread and 4 different dips. Hummus was cool..Baba Ganoush was good...Red Pepper was ok...and Cucumber Yogurt was everyone's favorite

Grilled Pear + Burrata - Very light and very savory 

Braised Oxtail Toast - The oxtail was really good with flavor and was a comfort food at its finest

Margherita Pizza - Nothing special just done well

CFC Wings - Basically a slightly different Blue Ribbon Chicken but with a little more kick. Fire! just the portions are smaller

7th + Carson Sliders - Nothing special just done well

Duckling Pot Pies - Not a fan of duck but it was rich and heavy...only downside is that it charred on the bottom....

Downtown Dubliner Burger - Fire and done excellent

Legs & Eggs - Favorite (official) dish of the night...something about this mixture while its a small dish it is worth it. From the texture of tempura and caviar, to the bite of the wasabi, the saltiness of the caviar, the sweetness of the crab, and the acidity of the ponzu sauce this dish was umami as fuck.

(Bone Marrow) - A special request of mine done by the chef....they really need to put this on the menu...Hands down always one of the best bone marrow ive had with the sauce, bread, and truffles...

This restaurant is exciting and a great addition to the emerging dining scene coming out of DTLV.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,4,2,5,2YG3orn7OCjdtJSByMUO_g

Taking the place of Glutton, it boasts outdoor drinking and eating along with a menu with fresh eats. My husband tried their Shamrock drink, which the bartender lovingly made. She was great and very friendly. It was a delicious mix of sweet and sour on a warm afternoon. I tried their grilled peach and buratta salad that knocked my socks off with the honey drizzle on the side. We are hopeful that their menu and presence will Grow in his area so we can come back and try more!",ihTu74HkXnKGuY5v_Z8b0g,1,1,4,2s63EPS4k3x03g_3JE0mNQ

The menu is so much fun, and difficult to decide what I want to order because I want to try everything on the menu. So..... we each order a dish and then.....share!
The people who work there are more than just friendly....... they really 'connect' with their customers. 

The food - the food is sooooo tasty and delicious. Amazing!

Love the patio seating. (Dog friendly too)

So convenient to entertain our guest(s) for dinner, then walk to Container Park across the street.",-sby2p3gq-Ou0kBv6FsoXA,2,1,5,DPRA9Wiiffudi1x_8mzSVg

While staying in Downtown, we used our trusty Yelp app and saw that 7th & Carson was still open and decided to give them a try after seeing so much praise over their Oxtail Toast.
Our starving hangry asses high-kneed it down there from Fremont and was seated within 10 mins. Our server was the sweetest as can be and didn't make us feel rushed at all while perusing the menu. 

They had only been open for a couple months at the time of our visit months ago but everything from service to food expediting was great.

CHARRED OCTOPUS ($13): 
http://bit.ly/2C1qvOn
Visually stunning plate of food, almost too pretty to eat. 
The grilled octopus tentacle had a nice crispy bite to it, while the inside was still perfectly cooked and tender.
Served on a splash of tasty white bean stew and finished off with crispy fried serrano ham. The smoky paprika vinaigrette and light dusting of additional paprika was a nice touch and didn't take away from the delicate taste of the octopus at all. 
A good dish overall. Only wished the portion was bigger than just a single tentacle. 

BRAISED OXTAIL TOAST ($15):
http://bit.ly/2DMmTA3
A piece of toast topped off with tender braised oxtail meat sounds satisfying enough, right? 
7th & Carson went even further by adding a tasty ""beer gravy"" (seemed more like a light thin au jus) and melted cheese curds to elevate this dish to a whole 'nother level. Unctuous and tasty, but would've been even better if it were 2 pieces of toast on that plate for $15.

C.F.C. WINGS ($13 for 4 wings/drummettes):
http://bit.ly/2l6V2SM
When did you ever see me turn down fried chicken??
The crunchy, sweet and spicy wings were flavorful. 
What I didn't like was being charged $13 for only 4 pieces. There wasn't any fries or anything else to accompany it.
Not sure what was in that spicy ""house dust"", it was tasty but I'd probably never order it again because I just can't seem to justify paying that much for 4 wings.

7TH & CARSON SLIDERS ($13 for 3 sliders):
http://bit.ly/2DFXp7n
Nothing spectacular, just a tasty well-cooked trio of mini burgers with American cheese, 3 cornichons and thousand island dressing on the side for....the burgers? $13 for sliders without fries is a bit steep. 

We didn't try any of their cocktails, just stuck to simple gin and vodka sodas since we were mainly there for the food. Drinks were around $11-$12. 

Was the food good, hell yes. 
But for a restaurant that advertises about being an American tapas type of bar serving up ""shareable plates"", it was rather overpriced for what little we got, hence the 3.5 stars",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,29,25,3,QeCtVOXMK0LC1EA_ObWAcQ
5524263,2018-03-05,0,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,Was not impressed with the chicken and waffles. The chicken was 3 extremely small wings with a negligible amount of meat on there. The waffles were small and didn't appear to be cooked as much as I would have like  didn't really like the apple on the waffles..i didn't know chicken  waffles could be so mediocre/disappointing. Wish I had gotten the breakfast pizza instead. Everyone else's food looked good though so just stay away from this  dish and you should be fine.,Hb3qHNxz10VY7Awyts44SA,2,1,2,L3MwvtM0l3612TOssOBk5A
5529377,2017-08-14,62,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"One bite into the ""CFC Wings"" made me forget all about ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Glutton"" with their delicious, crispy exterior and juicy insides.  It totally gives Blue Ribbon a run for their money and will be a gottaget on future visits.  After all, the chef definitely knows chicken if anyone remembers Gregg Fortunato's wings from Inyo.

""Legs+Eggs"" featured luscious pieces of crab leg fried tempura style topped with caviar; a pretty freakin fancy dish for DTLV.  Some could knock the fact that each piece averages more than $3, but these were beautiful morsels of tastiness that I was very down with.  

It feels like they omitted something from the description of their ""7th + Carson Sliders"" (American Cheese, Fried Onions, Thousand Island).  While it all sounds so simple and dare I say skippable, that awesome char grilled beef flavor made me want to put on an American flag onesy and chant ""USA! USA!"" at the top of my lungs.  The ""Braised Oxtail Toast"" kept the beefy train rolling in a completely different way with cheese curds, beer gravy and smoked sea salt. 

The Chef stopped at the table for a bit at the end and did note that the menu would evolve.  I eagerly look forward to what's in store!  This is definitely another solid choice for Downtown dining.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,88,82,4,oiqZ63IrjCqtHHn6v210EA

Great atmosphere and yummy unique dishes!

The burger was fantastic especially paired with the truffle fries.

My friend had the tuna tartar and an order of wings which she raves about.

We also tried two desserts- the butterscotch one and the cherry fruit roll ups..... YUM!!

Definitely a place I'll go back to!",GkYbcZpZe541yW296kFOrw,1,1,5,JKDheqxFAAaw0PQhsSQ39A
5653802,2017-08-13,1,FAiZp6pLY5l9JITMQPASbg,"I had been interested in dining at this new downtown place as I noticed the attention it was getting. I received an invitation to dine with some fellow Yelpers and decided to join them. I took a look at the menu during the day and had my eye on a few choices. I was also intrigued by the wine list as I noticed some wines I had tasted before.

Upon arrival, we were sat comfortably and a couple of us decided to try the Oxtail, ""Prawn""ceviche which I will discuss further and the Peach/Burrata salad. Although we ordered a bottle of Malbec, our server returned with the sad news they were out. There goes one star. You are a new dining establishment and you aren't monitoring your wine inventory? We then decided on a red Zinfandel from Paso Robles. It was tasty and seemed to be a good choice to accompany the tapas we selected. 

Here is where the evening went downhill for me. The ceviche was served and I noticed right away there was not a ""prawn"" in sight. I served my self a small portion and as I tasted there was still no ""prawns"". Two other servers approached our table to greet one of our friends as she seems to be a regular here. We inquired about the ceviche and were casually informed that they had changed it to sea bass! What??? Why does the menu state ""prawn""? She explained that prawns are hard to keep in the desert and sea bass is a little easier to manage with the heat.....ok I guess I understand (utterly mystified at that explanation). In all the times I have eaten ceviche, I have never had sea bass as the fish. Anyway, not impressed.

I did enjoy the peach/burrata salad as it was refreshing but not the best I have ever had. The oxtail was good as this was the first time I had tried this particular dish. Our other table mates shared the sliders, chicken wings and the bread. All tapas were just ok for me. Nothing really dazzled me. We decided to split the bill and I paid with cash thank goodness as my friends ran into issues when using their debit cards. I left before all this took place as my parking meter was running out of time. I felt bad that Stephany V. received a ticket when she had been trying to leave for a while. 

Overall, I was not dazzled by this place but have hopes they will get it together especially with telling the truth on the menu. I must confess, I love the concept of sharIng food with friends, but I need more than a few bites to sustain myself. I found myself stopping at another dining establishment to complete my dinner on the way home.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,10,1,3,uS6YMapHQyWJHVkB11KLvQ

We were early so we sat at the bar where Oscar the mixologist (he was more than just a regular bartender so I had to say that) mixed us some delicious cocktails! He even stopped by our table for a ""consultation"" after we sat down with my friends. my friends got some unique drinks & he'll make stuff that's not on the menu. for food my boyfriend & I shared the oxtail toast which tastes like a nice, richly flavored roast beef. The pear burrata salad & the Margarita pizza. Our fave was the pear & burrata but they were all yummy!

The service was slightly slow but the chef noticed and took our order for us which I greatly appreciated.  We did get plentiful water refills and occasional checks by the manager.  Such great service!

Every dish we ordered was great.  The flavor and the combinations were just spot on.  I would never think to try blue cheese with pork belly but it works!  The only thing I didn't care for all the way was the duck pot pie and that's only because it was a little oversalted.  

In fact I liked this place so much I came back for brunch Sunday morning.  Again I had a great experience with great food, service and atmosphere.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,1,1,5,3b9gcL_gdAi3V6Pe_2p4ZA
