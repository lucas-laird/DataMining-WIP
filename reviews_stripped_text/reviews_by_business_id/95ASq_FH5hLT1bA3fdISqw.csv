150946,2013-01-03,0,95ASq_FH5hLT1bA3fdISqw,Just down the street. Not much to be expected cause it's fast food. Mostly go through the drive thru. Gotta say I do like the Cinnabons they sell there now.,rafmR5depZVP9lPYI8Rn4w,0,0,3,otmz9GUx7GKNXnOD_ytbOA

So guys BEWARE! they have a horrible rude crew name LEONARDO. a f******g rude mexican guy. He doesnt listen thats why we got our order wrong. He wont apologize. he seems to hate his job. this kind of employee should not be working here!! disgrace to the company's name. And when we return to tell him they got our order wrong, he didnt apologize, just grabbed the burger in my hand together with the receipt and talked shit in spanish and called us ""pinche puta"". he thought we didnt understand what he said and when my partner confronted him and tell him how rude he is and that we'll gonna report him to the manager and corporate office, again he's rude attitude bursted out and what he did instead of apologizing, he showed he's badge and telling us his name is leonardo and said ""here's my name! what are you gonna do about it!"" and the supervisor named Fatima just stood there and did nothing too. (another mexican) wow! worst worst worst! 
We did reported him to the store manager (which is, thank god! a white old lady) and listened to us and apologized to us. and we also reported him to the corporate office and filed a complaint. hopefully they'll do something about it.",wvheIIhSs4hwPcM5vEEsrw,0,0,1,fFwBeJ_qROg7vnK5Qi3NKg
435825,2016-12-02,0,95ASq_FH5hLT1bA3fdISqw,This place is on my travel path almost every day.  A while ago i gave up on their tired worn out appearance and employees.  About a month ago i noticed that they did a refit and the place i was going to nearby was having a long line.  So i gave them another chance.  They did a little better than most fast food places.  I see a bunch of complaints here but maybe only people who are aggravated complain here.  So I rate it a buy.  I gave it 3 stars because it is just normal fast food.  that was what i expected and what i got.,89hwJjA6gfzqZewycuGm7w,0,0,3,onWGd3JraSbWU6Pu56wOkQ
666711,2014-08-26,0,95ASq_FH5hLT1bA3fdISqw,"I've been going to this BK since 2008 off and on. From 2008-2010, it used to be really good the food and customer service was great. Over the years, I noticed as a chain they have gone downhill. Because of the fact, that the food is no longer good, I come here maybe like once a year. Well, when I went in there at the end of July, I order the original chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and burnt. It was not worth eating it because the lettuce was brown as well. I took it back and the manager gave me an attitude and said I was wasting food. How am I wasting food when I paid for it? She did not want to give me my money back and after arguing, they made me a new sandwich. it was still gross and with brown rotten lettuce and a nasty burnt chicken patty. DO not ever go to this Bk as well as any location in general. BK just plainly sucks and this location turned me into not wanting to go there anymore.",IC85N5N_qqdQa4fPG_EmPg,1,0,1,4Fs9MsPIhjKBJLxuD4easQ

1216127,2016-10-31,0,95ASq_FH5hLT1bA3fdISqw,Tonight we got fresh hot fries and a freshly made Wopper.  This is typical.  I don't know if BK can manage making anything else as they are struggling with the basics.  Food is typically the same as any BK.  Over many years this BK has redecorated and switched things like the restrooms around to no avail.  They just redecorated again and the inside looks pretty good for a BK.  Points for that.  The place is pretty badly run.  They used to be pretty busy at lunch with a line around noon.  I have not seen that for a long time.  I haven't seen a manager actually managing ever.  The people who man the counter are typically satisfactory and get the food out. Tonight for a change the music played was for adults and not teens or strange. So good for that.  They put up a nice TV as part of the remodel and I give that a point too.  There are frequently beggars outside and this is unattractive for customers. Unfortunately there was a beggar at the exit door again tonight.  Cleanliness was ok for fast food. We almost always get the Wopper and fries and never had any problems with that.  Part of their management problem was no wifi for years.  Now they got wifi but tonight it was not functioning.  I didn't complain about it. But you would think that part of managing is noticing when its down.  I also didn't notice a sign about it.  One sad thing is that this place is a fixture in the neighborhood and slowly but surely bad management has killed the business little by little.  Failure to adapt to changes in food taste and general management... I think that the  only reason why they survived this long is because Wendy's and some others gave up during the recession.,x0cbvislTvwFrzbYMXM3Gw,1,0,3,cN2nwXPCrdPWZChJo1NELg

I did the drive through and when I pulled up I noticed the girl who was taking money was preparing my food. Who knows how much money she touched before touching my fries!!  I very politely asked for a new order of fries, they had a girl put gloves on and give them to me with a smartass grin on her face...  So inappropriate!!  I am entitled to be served clean food!!  A call will be made to management!",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,1,1,2,pruUPW2SQT-qj_L9y_m_PA

Never coming here again. Food quality has really gone downhill. Train your workers to label food and not cross contaminate . Thank you,jTytPKgXADG9O880PEkQ7Q,1,0,1,KXyDsQoS_lTa4Yz4W_7CAA

I stood in line and when it was my turned I ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though I was crazy. She did not know what I was talking about, I told her tacos, you know like in jack in the box and she responded "" we don't have tacos, try a Mexican restaurant"". I couldn't believe she was so rude. However, I notice that las Vegas restaurants don't carry alto of the stuff restaurants in California do.",zuXsPa0HQcvOhPAFbP8qDw,1,1,1,_BV6DSQGtmV-SlXFrL8cIw

The attitudes of fast food workers can sometimes be questioned. Anyways I came here because a little birdy told me that the French toast sticks are only a dollar?! Say what?? Fat kid at heart I really do try to stay away from all fast food however I am a sucker for breakfast items smh. The French toast sticks here are very good! The morning I came I lucked out and had nobody ahead of me in the drive thru! Score! Pulled on through and got my hot and fresh French Toast. The fact that I didn't get any kind of warm greeting or thank you for your business was expected, and in return you get 3 whole stars :-)",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,3,5,3,jn3ct569vXIMAjILdO5OMw

Since they had at this time just stopped serving breakfast, I opted for a burger instead. They then tried to charge me the difference, and then hand me a burger with uncooked bacon and so cold the cheese didn't melt one bit!!! I brought the burger back, didn't ask for a penny back, left.... I refuse to ever visit this burger king again, and if this is a representation of the value the corporation has in its customers, I will definitely be advising my stock broker to sell my shares!!!!!!!!!!!",SS6OwC-34Zl2Fh06UuTPOw,0,0,1,Ttw8U6oSkH3gbarQ1Unp2w

Got home and realized that one of my sandwiches were missing and our hash browns were a size smaller than what we ordered, also no sauce and the food was cold. We live two minutes from there so I know for a fact they didn't warm the food. I understand customer service and how people make mistakes but the fact that we were the only people there and was still missing part of our order makes me feel like they don't care much for their customers. Definitely won't be going back there again.",XoO9vpqp6z9-Ek7kirFa6A,0,0,1,f0QooBzd3iMHQF_niU-Ziw
