I don't know if they do something differently here, but the food was very bland. I shouldn't have to put a bunch of pepper and/or dressing on my food to make it taste better.

The buffalo chicken wrap had a very minimal amount of chicken, and had an absurd amount of lettuce, cucumbers, and buffalo sauce. The first bite was just dripping with sauce that made it messy until I was finished. The side of mac and cheese was very bland and had almost no distinct cheesy flavor, despite it being drowned in cheese.

I get that this restaurant is inside of a casino, and generally anything sold in a casino can be expensive. But $45 for two sandwich meals is a complete rip off even being inside of a casino. The portions aren't even that big either. Getting two sets of chips and sodas costed $20 alone! The Earl of Sandwich in the Palms casino is way cheaper and it's the same damn restaurant! So it being inside a casino is no excuse. I'm not sure why it's more expensive here. We could of ordered a nice dinner at Cheesecake Factory instead of this mediocre ""fast"" food. Only reason we ate here is cause we were nearby and starving.

Also for how outrageous the prices are, you would think they could hire more employees to give better and faster service. There were only two people working. Just one person making the food and one working the register. The poor workers looked so overwhelmed with the amount of orders coming in. There were about 10 people behind us when we ordering. It took about 25 minutes to get our food and we were first in line! Everyone that ordered after us even wondered what the hell was going on. And here's the freaking tipoff. After paying $45 for some basic bland sandwiches and waiting that long, of course they got our order wrong! They made us the wrong sandwiches... They offered to remake our food but at that point I was so pissed off from waiting so long I said forget it and just took what they gave us because I'm not going to wait another 25 minutes. No apology or compensation from them either.

Do yourself a favor and save your time and money and don't eat here. I don't even see what the hype is. Capriotti's is way better. Go eat there if you want good sandwiches or take your money and eat at a nicer restaurant instead of paying such a high price at a ""FAST"" FOOD place.

Located in the Caesars Palace food court, right around the corner when you get off of the parking structure elevator, you'll find this sandwich joint. This is the second one that I've been to. My main one, although far, is the one in Downtown Disney. I haven't had the chance to try the one in Planet Hollywood, which I've heard so much about it, so I'll compare it to the one at Disney.

It's part of the food court, so it's just a walk through window, and you can sit wherever you want. The fountain drinks are communal, but luckily, one of the locations is right next to the restaurant window. Bottled drinks, salads, and pastries are near the counter if you want to order them as well.

I pretty much only know and love the Chicken Chipotle Avocado, so i tried that. It's a sub sandwich with strips of chicken, bacon, avocado slices, and chipotle sauce. I love this at the Disney location, but here, for some reason, it just didn't taste as good. I also had the Montague, didn't like it much either. 

Maybe try this if you haven't before, but if you can make it to Planet Hollywood, or Downtown Disney, try those instead.",eKj_OQcWVFWkDQH8LUYKNw,2,1,3,SKW56Us7BU9zWoMsoggsBg

I had read previously that the new Earl that opened in Caesar's Palace was just the same minus the 40 people line, you can expect how pleased I was to find this out.

However, that content went down the drain quickly after ordering my food. There was a line, it just wasn't a line of people. Their counter was lined with people's orders as the single cashier struggled to keep up with the amount of business. It was the 4th of July weekend and they thought it would be a good idea to only staff one cashier for the lunch time rush? Someone either had the largest brain fart in history or isn't very good at scheduling.

Eventually, someone came out to help give out the food to us, he appeared to be a manager or supervisor given his different attire and his name tag said Frank. Some 10-15 minutes later after I had ordered, as I was waiting to receive my food I over heard him talking to the lady in front of me. ""Sorry you're food is taking so long, the cooks aren't handing it out because they said it isn't their job."" Definitely loud of enough that the workers who were busy in the back could hear him.

Regardless of who's fault it might be, but as a food worker myself, that was appalling. A manager is supposed to support his team and inspire his team and if his cooks were reacting like that to him, anyone can tell that he was anything but inspiring with those remarks.

Silver lining to all this, the food was great as usual at least. I had the classic Earl's Club. The taste never lets me down, but I'll be returning to the Planet Hollywood location from now on.",HWFI1BMd7Hu5yc-1okpRzg,1,0,2,OBxopNjQqnGppId5rlGAKQ

I personally felt that the selection of sandwiches was quite disappointing; only the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, the Turkey Holiday and the Hawaiian BBQ looked appealing to me. Also, the prices for these sandwiches are overpriced. 

~ Turkey Holiday
The sandwich comes with slices of turkey topped with cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy and cranberry sauce. It is reminiscent of a thanksgiving dinner.

~ Chipotle Chicken Avocado
Grilled chicken topped with bacon, lettuce, avocado, cheddar and chipotle sauce makes for a good sandwich. There's a nice crunch from the bacon and a nice tang from the chipotle sauce. The ingredients make for a good sandwich. 

Earl's makes tasty sandwiches, but for the price you have to pay, I personally don't think it's worth it.",3fpLB4PADEQQb73FCGseeQ,1,1,3,ptv_YiYe0JsF8Z4mZRRdbg

So you'll find this one in Caesar's Palace on the way to the Forum Mall (left side in the food court).  It's a bit of a weird sight as you wouldn't exactly expect an Earl of Sandwich to be just a food stand next to a fast food pizza/pasta place but there it is.  The line can vary from my observation but when I was there, it was pretty short.  

Service-wise, it was confusing from where to order to pick-up.  Drinks were intermingled in the middle with all the other restaurants and servers weren't exactly the kindest that night (and neither were the customers for that matter).  

Food-wise, you'll get the same menu as any Earl of Sandwich.  Yes, it's just a sandwich and it's not going to be the price of your 'Subway' sandwiches but you get a pretty meaty/solid creation that is usually pretty good for a higher end sandwich price (think about $8-$15 depending on what you get).  I got the original 1762 for the first time which is just a really meaty sandwich with little else (which is exactly what I needed).  Salads, chips, basic drinks are all available too.  

My two cents, if you have time and aren't in a rush, go to Planet Hollywood and try out the original Earl of Sandwich - there may be a line but it's usually quick, staff is super friendly and the eating area is spacious and easy to figure out.  This Earl of Sandwich Jr. restaurant is the same food without much of the personality behind it.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,1,3,9JgZOxXRvG5JwN07sw5HQQ

So bad I thought this was the norm for the chain that I wasn't really interested in coming back. Then after discussion with a work colleague he mentioned it was one of his favourite American sandwich chain shops. So I decided to give it another go. 

This location was in Caesars just before the Forum Shops in the Forum casino area food court. Probably the cheapest food options in Caesars Palace. 
Outside the restaurant order and receipt area was some of the most comfortable booth seats I've ever sat in ever! 

I decided to order a soup Broccoli-cheddar with a 1492 sandy on brown bread. The soup was very think, cheesy and had very small bits of broccoli. It was on the average side of okay but nothing stellar 2.75/5. The sandwich (not huge) was actually decently good with a healthy serving of roast beef with a creamy horseradish sauce. Expectations were lowered so I'd say I was adequately content but wouldn't consider it a memorable meal. Overall it was a solid 3/5

4604755,2016-11-21,0,fE7x3Ui2mzdwdfJnd7r_1g,"Light fare in the ""mall food court"" of Caesar's Palace.  Earl of Sandwich serves medium sized sandwiches for the gambler who wants lunch but put too much money into the slot machines that day.  Bread is heated before sandwich assembly.  The sandwich preparation takes a similar amount of time as your typical Panera, not as fast as Jimmy John's.  In the Caesar's Palace location, my sandwich was a little over $10 after tax.

Highlights: You get a choice between white or wheat bread, which is heated as your sandwich is prepared and is soft.  Better than other fast food chain bread, not as satisfying as bread for a sandwich made from a bakery.  I ordered the Full Montagu, which is a sandwich with roast beef, turkey, Swiss, and cheddar.  The meats were of good quality.

Critiques: For $10, the sandwiches are small.  I'm accustomed to getting large subs that are longer, have twice as much meat, and filled with twice the vegetables at the supermarket.  These supermarket subs will usually cost less than $8.  While the bread at Earl of Sandwich is decent, I like the bread from my favorite supermarket better.  In short, I thought I got an okay, underwhelming small sandwich for the price I paid.

Overall: If you're too lazy to leave Caesar's Palace for lunch and want to buy a meal that's less than $15, then this may be an okay choice.  If you're looking for a high value cheap meal, I'd suggest getting food elsewhere.",ITSnuLOu81doC5GGT5NMSQ,3,1,3,JZYRkgCLrjNmuNA10JNnNA

Cons: The prices are a bit on the high side for sandwiches but if you get the full montague, it's worth it. The sizes are also on the smaller end as well but the taste makes up for it.

Earls is definitely my favorite sandwich place! I usually get the Chipotle Chicken and my boyfriend usually gets the Full Montagu.

The sandwiches are way smaller and half the amount of meat. I will never go back to the Caesars palace earl of sandwich",33HXZ_UajN4WGxCc7fY6EA,0,0,1,YEx4YjHmvi3jwf4c8_MUtw

This one is literally like a sandwich place you would find in any mall food court only way more expensive. The Italian sandwich we ordered was super overly salty, the chicken noodle soup had 4 noodles and 3 tiny pieces of canned chicken, and the tuna melt was decent but nothing spectacular. All that and a drink came out to $30 and that's with a players card discount. A medium sized fountain soda here is almost $5!!! This ain't the movie theater for godsakes. The Planet Hollywood Earl's used to be a true sandwich gem, haven't been in awhile but this Earl's at Caesar's is seriously nothing more than an overpriced Quizno's.",w-fkht6rk_MszTx6g9zqXg,0,0,2,UYPFObzKKy90thHZ3OKWKg

The quest to find this place (not to mention it causing me to be delayed in returning my rental then almost missing my flight) was worth all of the trouble. My brother and his wife recommended I try this place out, and I have to agree that it was a great find! Great service, the sammiches came out hella fast. I got the Hawaiian BBQ and it was super bomb.",PO35eUKYCf1kAoVctJ4H1g,0,0,5,HeTAgMJ5eawIKsLb6z9E4Q

Anyways, I don't think the sandwiches live up to the name.pretty basic and mediocre. We got the tomato soup and the chicken chipotle sandwich. The tomato soup was way too sweet and had giant chucks of  soggy bread in it. Absolutely disgusting. The sandwich wasnt anything spectacular. I can probably make a better sandwich using my week old vegetables and chicken rotting away in my fridge...",nHwyTmUWPLuFLVak8Gf2Jg,0,0,2,EqZiduXA9Ljj5nJxz8XH9w

It's a personal must for every time I go to Las Vegas, and it's worth the walk from whatever hotel I'm staying at on that trip. There is also another location in Planet Hollywood, so make sure you try one. The employees are always super friendly and this spot is conveniently in the middle of the food court, very causal and surrounded by other restaurants. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu, but the sandwiches are definitely the part of Earl of Sandwich that help them live up to their claim to fame. The bread is toasted perfectly and there is a hot or cold sandwich for whatever your current craving is. My personal favorite is the Thanksgiving turkey special, literally consisting of the holiday meal off carved turkey slices, stuffing, and cranberry sauce topped with light mayonnaise. Honorable mentions also to The Montagu (roast beef and turkey) and Chipotle Chicken Avocado. The tomato soup, mac and cheese, and cookies are great sides, as well!",N2h_tu44NenrJSSiWJ6Yhw,1,0,5,-Zpnv3cSpgCiPfBqSGR30g

Next time I will go to Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood.  The reviews there are outstanding overall.  

To sum it up.  The sandwich was okay.  For the expensive price, the sandwich did not make the grade.  Money is best spent elsewhere.  Sorry.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,6,4,2,HPMoF6p2fvJf5iroFq5P_Q
