We finally got a call back about it yesterday. The manager offered to 'take care of us' the next time we come in. So we went today. The manager met us at the host desk, shook our hands and led us to our table. I was confused, was it a free meal? discounted? I had no idea. I got a burger and my bf had a steak dinner. The food was much better than last time but nothing to get excited about. The service was better too. But the waitress never said 'you're welcome' after I thanked her for refilling drinks.  It's a pet peeve. then the check came and my bf said 'the manager will take care of it' she seemed to know the situation and took the check away. We continued to sit at the table waiting for the manager to come by and discuss the bill or at least say something. But he never came by. So we started to leave. As we were walking out, the manager stopped us, shook our hands and said have a nice day. that was it. He was not rude but the whole thing was confusing and awkward.",o9egV9T264-gU0LLUrjPLw,0,0,1,PXXE6Js5TybflpRnc985wg

532836,2012-01-07,0,X6DR-xr0rQKnxl9jeZWFzw,"I had been to the Grand Cafe a couple of times before writing this review.  I didn't want to seem unfair after just one visit since it has reopened. I had been several times in the past and loved it, for inexpensive food. But they closed and the location became a Coco's. A little while back the Coco's closed down and the Grand Cafe reopened. My wife and I were so excited. We gave it a try expecting the good food at low prices we had gone back again and again for. We went back again a few nights ago to have dinner with some friends. I am sorry to say that both my wife and I are very disappointed.

The Grand Cafe is clean; as a matter of fact it is very clean. I give them a lot of credit for that. But the restaurant itself is just kinda drab. It looks OK, but nothing jumps out at you.

The service is spotty. Sometime they are very attentive, and other times they are not. This was the same when the Grand Cafe was there before the Coco's and seems to be the same now. The other night I finished my beverage 3/4 of the way through dinner and was not asked if I wanted a refill until I was being handed the check; well after we had all finished and were ready to depart.

The taste of the food seems not to be very good any more. I have had the meatloaf & the Prime Rib. The veggies with both dishes were pretty good. The potatoes with each dish were OK as well, but nothing to write about. The meatloaf was very, very bad. The meat had been highly over mixed and had a almost slimy texture to it. There was no flavor to it at all. I had to add massive amounts of salt just to make it palatable. My wife had gotten the spaghetti and meatballs that night. They were awful. The sauce was sickly sweet and the meatballs were just like my meatloaf; disgusting. The other night I had ordered my Prime Rib medium rare. It came out medium well. And after it was cut, they had thrown on the grill. There was no pink to it at all. It was charred in some places and looked more like a stark that a Prime Rib. The flavor was acceptable, but just. All in all I am going to try my best to avoid going back. If friends want to go I will go again, but I will try to talk them out of it.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,1,Z1wHyeQWt_Q5Kwvj2rxldw

861271,2014-08-30,0,X6DR-xr0rQKnxl9jeZWFzw,"What sets this restaurant apart from other local casino ""café"" style eateries is the top quality of the beef. It's amazingly tender with the perfect balance of fat to meat. I've probably eaten here dozens of times and I keep coming back  - mostly for their $6.99 burger special (with fries, huge pickle slices, tomato and onion)  - that would literally cost up to $50 at snazzier places on the strip. 

Their huge roast beef dinner special ($11.99 with veggies, & choice of baked, mashed or fries)  melts in your mouth, and so does the grilled New York strip steak, with crispy onion strings, potatoes and vegetables $14.49) Note: avoid the $9.99 steak special as the meat is not as tender.

I've also had their meatloaf, the roast lemon and herb chicken (both $9.99 served with the same sides as the NY steak). These were just OK. Their club sandwich is gigantic, perfectly cooked bacon, tasty thinly sliced turkey, tomato, lettuce & mayo, totally yummy - $8.49.

Other reviewers complain about the service , I'm at a loss to understand this- I can only think of one time I had a real issue with a rude and incompetent server. My food has always been served hot, and only once did I send a steak back to be cooked as ordered.

Many of my friends love this place too, and they've ordered various sandwiches, soups and dinners and almost always enjoyed everything. Haven't done breakfast here.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,0,0,4,swcgC64tC7GJB0cmJiCHmg

I'm a few miles away from Boulder Station and came to have something to eat right quick. I didn't feel like anything else that was open in the area or cooking. Metro Pizza sounded great but they were already closed, so I went next door. 

The place looks much more nice than the Coco's that use to occupy this space. All the tables were set nicely, new paintings on the wall, and smiles on the employees faces. The service was very good. My drink was constantly full and I got my appetizer soup promptly after ordering. 

The menu had reasonable prices and the food looked great. The Prime Rib Special looked very good, but that is until 11pm and it was already after midnight. Instead I went with a Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries. The burger was a very good size and filling, I didn't even finish it! It came with thick cut bacon, slice of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The fries were hot and good. 

Overall, the food was basic and good. What stood out most was the service they provided. They are really putting in a good effort to make this place more customer friendly with excellent service. I will revisit and try the Prime Rib next time.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,0,0,4,JCn40n41Rspr8JRLLb38KQ

My friend ordered NY steak and eggs for breakfast and there was a lot of fat on the steak but she didn't complain because fat is normal on steaks and the server saw it and comped her steak. They really didn't have to do that but it was very nice and great customer service. 

For dinner I ordered chicken tenders and asked for lettuce under it. They gladly said ""we can definitely do that for you"".  The staff is great and there to serve you however you want. I will definitely be back here.",t1RlgjxBrRiSqz2fR3A1PA,0,0,5,TovknebC__XXyXkOToeBSQ

The good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out.

3896836,2013-01-04,2,X6DR-xr0rQKnxl9jeZWFzw,"Here's the lowdown: 

Grand Café is a comfortable place to grab good eats at a decent price.  (4 stars) 

Unfortunately, the service isn't so good.  It's unreliable--on the average, your server will be polite at a minimum, but nothing to rave about.  For instance, one kid has a tendency to take your table's order without writing anything down; not bad for simple orders, but I haven't had the opportunity to test him with a particularly picky order yet.  It's admirable that he has the ability to remember the table's order, but it definitely doesn't leave you with the feeling that he cares.  (2 stars)

Thus, I have to leave this place with an average, 3-star rating.  If service improved, I would have no problem rating Grand Café 4 stars, especially since their food warrants it.  

On a side note, the hostess & several waitresses (different visits) have informed my family & me that the Boarding Pass specials are only valid with the purchase of a beverage.  They directed me to the ""fine print"" on their specials sign/advertisement, but thanks to my ability to read, I was able to discern that the sign/advertisement DOES NOT indicate any such requirement.  Nonetheless, upon my last visit my waitress informed me that ""the system needs a beverage on the check for each special in order for the special price to be honored.""  I'd give this place 2 stars, but the food is worth the crappy service.  Just thank the wait staff with a smaller tip accordingly and enjoy your cheaper, delicious meal!",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,4,2,3,AZRG3a8mRgxmIAKUmn1Wkw

They cater to seniors and the service and food has always reflected that IMO. I think that demographic can be hard to please but the staff does a good job. I've never had a long wait and I've also never had the same server more than a couple of times. I've also always had consistently good service with minimal wait time for food and prompt refills. When I want ""American"" comfort food I come here.

I usually get nachos, wings, chili cheese fries, or one of their soups to start. Their cream of mushroom and clam chowder are surprisingly good.

I usually get prime rib 11.99 or the chicken fried steak for an entree. The dinner 9.99 or breakfast 7.99/8.99 version are both delicious. One comes with eggs and hash browns and the other comes with a veggie and a starch. Depending on when you go the prime rib can not be so good. I mean if it is late don't count on getting a medium when you want a medium. I think it's a great value if you go early.

Their sandwiches are all good also!

I love the prices and how consistent it is. 

I recommend this place to everyone for a go to solid place when you aren't trying to spend a lot of money. 

I recommend their mashed potatoes as a side with country gravy.

4239472,2011-04-16,0,X6DR-xr0rQKnxl9jeZWFzw,"It looks like Stations Casinos brought back the Grand Cafe. I didn't have high expectations upon entering this place, since I remember the old Grand Cafe being pretty terrible.

First thing that I noticed was that they're really trying to emphasize better service. Staff is much more friendly and accommodating this time around, which is already an improvement. I never really expected to be greeted with smiling faces and a friendly welcome when I'm in the Boulder Station. I mean, c'mon, it's the Boulder Station. The Boulder Strip doesn't exactly scream with class. 

The menu did go through some minor tweaks, but it still contains the standard cafe fare, with $7.99 daily specials that come with soup or salad. They also  have some off-menu specials like a $3.99 skillet breakfast, $5.99 burger special, or $7.99 for a mountain of Rocky Road pancakes.  

For starters, we ordered some spinach & artichoke dip, served with pita bread. Wasn't too bad, seemed a little lighter than most spinach dips that I have had.

For the entrée, I ordered the potato crusted trout special, one of the Friday specials. It practically looked like a two rectangular hash browns with trout hiding inside. It wasn't too bad actually, especially for a $8 seafood dish.

They tout that their Kona coffee is freshly brewed and ground every 90-minutes, which got me interested in trying it out. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but it tasted good enough for me.

All in all, a decent experience. This is somewhere I'd go for lazy and cheap eating, when I'm not willing to make a drive anywhere to break the bank. It's decent food, but nothing to go out of the way for. It's a definite improvement over the old Grand Cafe, that's for sure.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,1,0,3,omDuBe2o15DEqkK-oArCNw

Look, Boulder Station is basically 5 minutes from where I live, so if I feel the need for a quick, cheap dinner on the fly - Boulder Station it is. Since BS brought back the old Grand Cafe I figured I might as well give it a go, along with my parents.

First off, the menu is basically the same old cafe menu you'll see anywhere. Breakfast (served 24-hours), main dishes, sandwiches, and desserts. Not a whole lot going on here, but hey, it's just a normal little cafe.

The service is far improved from Coco's. Whenever I went here in the past the hostess was rude, the waiters were mediocre, and you had to wave down people constantly to get refills or anything for that matter. Our waiter was a very nice guy, but he did not refill drinks and he did not come back to ask us how our meal was. He showed up at the beginning and he showed up at the end. It's just a good thing I wasn't super thirsty and only drank one glass of tea... speaking of the tea...

It was bland and it needs work. If you're going to serve tea, at least get it right. Mine and my mother's were too watery, too much ice. On to the food, my father ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet. It came out looking EXACTLY like the picture in the menu and my dad said it was really good. My mother and I ordered the $8.99 Prime Rib Special. My mom got french fries, I got mashed potatoes (mmm the gravy on the potatoes was delish!). The prime rib was cooked perfectly and it was BIIIIG. No skimping on their prime ribs here. It was served with veggies (meh) and au jus, as well as horseradish. 

So overall I'm pleased with the Grand Cafe and will return many times because it is so close, convenient, and hey, if my parents are going to pay the bill for a meal - I am down.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,3,nXEChXoWi7HJqQztJhugyQ

The Station Cafes have seen good days and bad days. Heck, at one point they changed them all to Cocos (that was the worst of days), and I'm happy to report they have steadily been going back up hill.

They have added some new things to the menu like Loco Moco and a killer chicken cordon blue sandwich. They have one of the best Cobb Salads I know of (they make their own creamy French dressing for it), and their prime rib is relatively low priced and consistently good. They are running specials now at all times, like Steak and Shrimp for $10, Cheeseburger and fries for $6, etc. The specials also now come with a soft drink so they are a pretty good deal. If you are a later night or early morning person they usually have some very low priced graveyard specials that run from midnight to 6am.

One thing that this place has always has is very good service. Their servers have always been very friendly and I have family members that come here mainly for that reason. They also have very reasonable prices.

My fiance and I stood at the hostess' stand for nearly five minutes before the hostess decided to seat us.  Then we waited ten minutes for someone to take our drink order.  I ordered the roasted lemon herb chicken.  When it came, it was visibly incorrect - it had clearly been grilled and smelled like chemicals.  When I peeled the skin away, it seemed okay... so I ate a little bit.  Then I dug deeper.  To my absolute horror, the chicken gushed blood and the looked like jell-o.  It was RAW.  Of course, my waitress was nowhere to be found, so I found someone else to take it back to the kitchen and grab the manager.  Meanwhile, my fiance had a chicken fried steak.  It was cold and tough.  

Ten minutes went by and the manager still hadn't visited the table.  Worse yet, our waitress decided it was time to go home... and we weren't assigned another waitress.  We had to go find someone ourselves to get the check and have my meal taken off.  

I hunted down the manager, who was apologetic about the situation, but didn't offer any practical solutions to the situation.  She didn't seem to think it was a problem that the waitress had left work without reassigning the table, and she tried to defend the chef who made the chicken.  I couldn't believe it.

After we placed our order, our food came out fairly quickly, and it was pretty good.  We both ordered breakfast items (eggs benedict, etc.).  What was odd is our waiter said his shift was over and another person would tend to us.  I tried to find him a minute later to tip him, but he ran out the door very swiftly.  And, no other waiter came to our table to ask if we wanted anything more, or to even pick up the money to pay for our meal.  There was 2 other waiters there but they didn't even pass our table once, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I left money on the table and left.  Not recommended.  Won't be returning.",QGuxKc1SSyL0I9HgFUZOmw,0,0,3,Gma0lwcnEY7_aM-tQqcnGQ

The biscuits and gravy were pasty and very flavorless.  The hash browns were perfectly golden on one side and white and oily on the other.  The eggs were done well, but they could not save the meal.

For was tasty, hot, and plenty of it. The party ordered the Shrimp Cocktail and the Mac & Cheese, and a order of Oriental Chicken Salad. All was good. The only draw back was the service was a little slow, but for 3 am, not to bad. Place was packed.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,0,0,4,2wZILrLoP-pP7Fa44w0Iig

All the things that's great but I have to especially brag on the cheesecake... It was extremely rich with fresh strawberries and three times bigger than anywhere else.",fUgvMW-UOAKbB1pt6y9G8g,0,0,4,a66tdqaNj0rMIJactniLmQ

Went there last night because we drove by and saw a huge sign on the outside of the casino that says ""$11.99 Prime Rib Special"" but the menu said $12.99 prime rib special.  After consulting the manager we were given the lower price. Hey, a dollar's a dollar, bro.  The prime rib was pretty darn good.  Came with a huge baked potato and green beans. 

It took about 10 minutes to get seated and about 10 minutes to have someone take our drink orders.  When someone doesn't come by the table for 10 minutes I get a little antsy but the Hungarian waitress we had was very nice. 

Minus one star cuz' my coffee cup had lipstick on it.  (I don't wear lipstick)",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,2,1,4,xVjmx7glF5La_X5JXr5MaA
5811611,2015-12-16,7,X6DR-xr0rQKnxl9jeZWFzw,"Anytime we have been to Boulder Station we usually end up staying long enough to eat here since they are open 24 hours a day. Especially when you get carried away on the machines.

The food is pretty good at this cafe. Not bad at all.

I really like the boneless chicken strips with the buffalo sauce. They are so good. My husband always get breakfast here as well as different dinners, And everything is usually really good when it comes out. Cooked just right and always good flavor 

It is very rare there is a wait especially later hours but if a concert they had gets out then it does get busy. They are always friendly from the time being seated till you pay.  Service at times has been slow depending on business of course. A lot of locals come in since it is so far from the strip.

We have found this location to always be consistent with the food and service. Never had any problems and would recommend if your near boulder looking for some inexpensive food check this Cafe out!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,9,6,4,9CDGmM_MJpP8BtpvA9BSHA

Our server Chris was Awesome, he was sweet and friendly as well as attentive.

I had the fish, shrimp and chips (fries) platter. It was delicious, cod with a really good batter and tarter sauce.

My husband had a breakfast combo and those two big fluffy pancakes served with it were delicious!

The food is really tasty, hot, fresh and generous!

My side salad with ranch dressing was even extra good.

We will be back if ever visiting the east side of las vegas again. We live on the west side so it won't be often however we can always try the closer Grand Cafe's located in the other related properties.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,4,4,KxBT7KHKrbr9PQiIvOsmXA

Maybe if they made there own sauce or something but the steak was good. It was just hard to cut , wish my steak would cut itself. Overall customer service was great, food was good not great but not sure if I would come back here.",9Dd1fLx93JRGypYC_3i9Zw,0,0,3,lpBYR4jUaXcJcIH7eFufxQ
