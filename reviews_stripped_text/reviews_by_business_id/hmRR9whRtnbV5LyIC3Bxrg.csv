I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  The spaghetti & meatballs were really good.  The marinara sauce was made from scratch, with fresh garlic and basil.  It's hard to describe, but it was subtle, more like something you would expect in a high end Italian restaurant.  It perfectly complemented the delicious and generous meatballs.  The garlic bread was perfectly toasted.  The chocolate mousse pie was just average.  My only complaint is that I asked for parmesan cheese specifically in my online order and didn't receive it with the delivery.  Oh well.   The prices are really good, especially considering the quality of the food.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.",SwHs6Vh3pX83-6DKLNV4Rw,3,0,5,HmI7UxgdtyVvo5C9CO5ENA

My husband ran into him at a gas station. We were wondering what had happened to him. His food was too good for him to not be cooking. 

The food is as always delicous.  I had the chicken Angello which is my favorite. The pasta  has the best sauce I have ever had. The chicken perfectly seasoned with a magical lemony sauce. 
The DH had a philly cheesestake. He stated it was one  of the best he has had. 

The family is so welcoming. They make you feel welcome and want to be there. 

The prices affordable. 

We will be back!",xWk0I0S9KWMB06wKUEDYxg,3,0,5,Z6aLgGTrR2k17hIXg6sjSA

I called requesting delivery, this lady was really rude on the phone then the she told me its minimum $15 for delivery...so I said no problem. She then tries to overcharge me on taxes and delivery fees. So when I asked her about it she felt a little guilty so then she gets little loud on the phone and everything so I basically just cancelled my order. Becareful! Hidden fees!",UMHRfTUaQ_jqPvAxuhqhDw,0,0,1,jIEirxOSGJKjZ5C7T8dUCQ
