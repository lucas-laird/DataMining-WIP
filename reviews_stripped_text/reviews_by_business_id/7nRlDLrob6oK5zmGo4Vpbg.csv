298810,2017-01-17,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"I am very disappointed in the service here and especially with the customer service. We went on Saturday January 15 and we had a party of 5. From the time we walked in, we felt an unwelcoming feeling.  Plenty of the waiters and persons working in that late morning/ afternoon shift were very unpleasant. Our waiter was Tammy and she was by far the worst waiter I ever came across in my life. She wasn't welcoming. Her attitude came off as she didn't even want to be there at work. We were very polite and she still was cold and mean. She was very aggressive with her responses. We ordered a omelette and it came half cooked. When I mentioned it to Tammy she rudely said "" What do you want me to do with it?""  and rolled her eyes.I was startled with that response. I felt very insulted and I had to tell her three times to take it back. I told her to please take it back and bring me a menu. Grabbed the plate and ran off with it. She never brought back the menu. Since she never brought the menu I requested to just make eggs and some bacon. She comes back with it and slams it on the table and walks off. She never came back and asked if the food was okay and if there was something else we needed. We were low on water, juices and she never came back. Then she comes with the checks and slams it on the table in between the  menus and said ""Here you go, Bye."" There were five separate checks and we couldn't even read who's bill was what. She didn't even have the courtesy to hand out our separate checks. We had to ask another waiter what was the process of paying because she never came back. We then saw her and told her if we can have boxes. My friend was trying to ask  her something as well and she just walked away. We had to ask another waiter to bring what we needed.  Tammy was very disappointing and I will never recommend anyone to this location and to deal with the horrible customer service that we went through. At this point we felt enough was enough and told Tammy to bring her manger to speak with us. The manager then comes and she was very nice and was able to help with the situation.",gKzTK5uuHWzLDUyVSyLlIw,0,0,1,pgKaI-uxYjT2PMtoQcfq_A

333155,2016-05-14,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"Came here with high hopes.  My pregnant wife was craving pork chops. After reading reviews of best pork chops in Las Vegas it was decided blueberry hill was the place to go. 
It's a nice family restaurant with the expected atmosphere. The wait staff was very nice. Back to the pork chops, they are offered two different ways. You get two when you order and since my wife didn't know Erich way would taste best she asked if she could get one of both. We were told they normally don't do that, but since it was slow she would ask. The waitress didn't come back so we assumed it was ok. Our food came out and there we two of the breaded pork chops. That's when we were told that they wouldn't do one of each. That's understandable, but it would have been nice if she would have asked my wife which way she preferred them. The pork chops were bland and unevenly cooked. She had to douse the potatoes and gravy on top of the chops just to get them down. Sad to say they didn't hit the spot. 
I ordered the Oreo chocolate pancakes that were VERY rich and sweet. I enjoyed what I could. 
There were other service issues, however, the waitress seemed to know we weren't satisfied and tried to make up for it the best she could.

479820,2017-07-19,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"Hello.

Thank you for letting me write an review for this restraunt. Here is how I judge my reviews off of each restaruant I visit.
Example Layout:
 Cleanness Of the Restruant
 Quality Of the food
 Pricing
 Service
 Speed

Now, at my visit, I ordered the double trouble cheeseburger.
Rating: 
Reason: The things I like about this restaruant are how comfortable the seating is as it is relaxing and has some leather back cushions. Both the Cleanness of the restaruant and service I like because once you have been seated, they offer you drinks and the menu has the pricing. Now the pricing is not a star because the sandwiches are at least 9.00 to 12.00 which doesn't include tax and as for this is why I  give it a .5 star. Now for the speed, it all depends on how much people are currently in the restaruant. I am currently in the restaruant and have gotten my meal within 15 mins of waiting. So for that I rate a full star for the speed. The Quality of the food is amazing, not burnt and ready to eat. So overall this restaurant 4.5 review, but since the site woulsnt let me do a half star, ill jsut bump this to a 5 star review!Thanks for having me!",JiNujBNBWidRh0Yhfstojw,0,0,5,hwHoLD2Qk6wkxbwjDACyTw

Particularly the Flamingo and Decatur location. Not all of the staff is great, but we can name a few that definitely make the experience way better! The bussers work their tails off, Martin you are awesome! And Norma, Chelsea, and Marvi, you are the few waitresses that place cannot do without! The food is good, but the people can really make or break the business. We love their homemade soups, chicken noodle and the meatball soup are the best! Their chicken parmesan is a classic, but I enjoy the crispy chicken without the sauce, the sauce can be a bit bland to those who eat without salt, but im sure if you add a dash it might be better. Regardless, I always enjoy the dish. Their honey coconut chicken is a must! And so are their pancakes!!! And their french toast too! You must try them with a side of ice cream! Yum!!!

Service was a big plus here, they  will actually speak to you and wait you unlike the service you receive on the strip. Will definitely make a stop here everytime I am in Vegas.",V9i-YzDe2PcPsasNUoM7uw,1,0,4,Mwrl4YOxDLodpS2ETjSjog

The food preparation has taken a hit recently; it's not as good as it used to be (seems like the cook staff is getting lazy), and the management is just plain apathetic.

The last three times the Orchid and I were in this place, there was one or more annoying, abrasive or just plain rude party making everyone else's lives miserable.  Now, we are aware that the trend in service management these days is to ignore the jerks and make the polite people bear it or leave.  We have in the past made comment to the management staff concerning the screeching children, the loud-to-the-point-of-pain raucous laughter, and the foul language of certain parties.  My mother, the most honorable Mama Hawk, and the politest person I know, attempted to light-heeartedly bring to the attention of the mother of the screeching child that he was causing the patrons around them to not enjoy their meal; this woman started screaming at my 88-year-old mother, complete with a litany of her ""right"" to eat wherever she pleased, and threats to my mother's health and well-being.  When management was notified of this incident, it was suggested that WE leave, as if we had been the offending party.

Jessica, Josh and Cesar - you've always been great, and we will miss you.
Sylvia (management staff) - your attmept to insert yourself into the conversation I had with the other member of staff was unwelcome.  You don't know our family's history with the Blueberry Hill organization, nor do you know what really transpired the last three times we patronized your restaurant.  (For that matter, you don't know anything about the eight years we've done business with the Hill.)  You are not entitled to an opinion, and anything you attempted to say was unwelcome, unqualified, and, frankly, irrelevant.
Male member of management staff (I think your name is ""Steve:""  I thank you for listening to our complaint this time, but your droopy, three-quarters-asleep eyes gave me the impressuion that you were either too tired to be on duty or that you really didn't care what we thought.

So ... this will be the last time we patronize Blueberry Hill.  One star because Yelp says I can't give a zero but that's how I count it), and one for the three memebers of wait staff who do a wonderful job in spite of the environment they are forced to work in.

When my order came the pancakes look like hash brown. I knew I was going to like it because I love anything made with potato. But these pancakes where amazing. I tried it with Apple sauce and cream cheese. But I enjoyed it with maple syrup. It's like hash brown but sweeter. I will order only this from now on.

TVs hanging everywhere as well. 

This spot was like denny's on steroids. The popular dishes are the waffles with chicken tenders in top. I went with the chicken apple compote waffle. For $11, it was definitely a lot of food. The apple compote is house made. Not too sweet. Chicken was okay with it. I felt it could have used a bit more seasoning. The waffle was good. It did get a little soggy but it was expected with the compote. I ordered one biscuit and gravy a la carte, $4. I thought it was good. They take a large biscuit and slightly toast it and slather it with their gravy. 

Kids were happy with their pancakes. No complaints there. Plenty of food and drinks to go around at the table. Coffee was regularly served.

I've been to this location 3 times, and I always order either the Classic Eggs Benedict or the Alaskan Waffle. Both are absolutely delicious and this new location carry out same great flavors. 

The reason I gave this location 2-star is due to their customer service. All three times I've been here, I've had to wait at least couple minutes for someone to greet me when I walk in the door. During my most recent visit, I was with a party of 5 and we got seated at a booth with no menus, no servers in sight, and no busser to serve us water. We waited about 15 minutes to get our iced waters. And then waited approximately another 5-10 minutes for a server to come and take our order.

The food is always delicious and the pancakes and crepes have never failed me. They have a bakery in the store too and bake their desserts fresh every day. We normally come in the mornings, service can be a little slow at times but never horrible. The staff is fun and quirky, I always hear a waitress laughing with their tables. Nix is one of my favorites, she is always upbeat and cheerful and makes me leave in a good mood after a big breakfast.

     We decided to stop by for dinner this week for the first time to check it out. It was extremely busy and I was a little dissapointed we couldn't sit in our normal spot. Our server was Josh, he was very attentive and informative on their massive 16 page menu. He knew the prices on everything we asked off the top of his head , and let us know how we could save on some money by deluxing our pancakes and meals(we added it up and we saved $13.78!!). Our side salads came out quickly and we were offered dinner rolls AND corn bread (I had no idea they had these?!). The food took almost 40mins to arrive after placing our order but it came out pipin hot and everything was delicious. Our server checked in on us twice after we started eating but I noticed the poor boy(looked 18) was practically jogging taking orders, serving food, making salads, seating people, working the register, and carrying plates of food all over the store. I got the feeling the store was under staffed... I only saw 4 employees with the store fully packed.

1628260,2015-02-23,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"After having so-so experiences at two other Blueberry Hill locations, I decided to give this new one a try, mainly because it's conveniently only a few blocks from home. I was impressed by the new style of the interior, much more modern than the other ones. Unfortunately that's where my being impressed stopped.

We seated ourselves and were attended to quickly enough. Our server, whose name escapes me now, wasn't really rude, just kinda snippy with us when we asked questions, like if I could have my burger with no onions. She said it doesn't come with onions and they had to be requested, and I pointed out the top of the burger page where it very clearly says that the burgers come ""dressed with lettuce, tomato, grilled or raw onions and pickle"", and she insisted I was reading it wrong and seemed to speak to me like I was a dummy. Whatever, I worked all night and I'm not looking for a debate for my breakfast/dinner, I just want to eat. We settled on the breakfast of champions: two orders of bacon cheeseburger & fries. As I sat waiting for my food, I noticed that my fork was pretty dirty. I really didn't want to be ""that guy"" and gripe about a dirty fork, especially because I wasn't going to use it anyway, so I cleaned it with a napkin and put it back. The server brought out our drinks and two glasses of water. 

When the meals came out, I was really expecting more. For $9.59 I got a medium size burger on a slightly hard bun, and what seemed to be a handful of fries. On the side were 3 sad-looking pickle chips - I guess a whole pickle, or at least a lengthwise slice, would be too extravagant. Having dealt with BH before, I knew better than to ask for some cole slaw, because that's going on the bill. The food tasted good enough, but I really cannot justify paying almost $10 for a skimpy plate of mediocre food.

What really ruined the experience for me was when I finished my iced tea, and went to drink the glass of water. My glass, which I hadn't really paid any mind to until then, was filthy. Hopefully it wasn't dirt, just residue from their dish detergent, but I still wouldn't want to drink from it, even with a straw. By this time I was truly over BH, and still wasn't feeling like arguing, so we paid the tab and left. I mentioned to the cashier about the glass while we paid and she went in the kitchen and scolded someone as we were walking out the door.

Like the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, so I can now say that I'm truly done with Blueberry Hill - if you need me, I'll be at the Black Bear stuffing myself on huge, worth-the-price portions and dealing with friendly people.",w5p02wAC5NXh0iwV2zHvSQ,5,0,2,WyAC04rkXykQJvqZCQx7Lg

1710575,2016-07-13,2,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"Just a few minutes off the main drag lies a hidden gem of a restaurant known as Blueberry Hill. And it's damn delicious. I love the cozy vibe inside this place. It's like a diner ate another diner and created this place. Loads of seating. We got in for brunch on a Saturday with no wait at around noon. WINNER.

The menu is ridiculous. And by that I mean ridiculously GOOD. I love options, especially when they're all within the same style of cooking (i.e. they don't overreach). This place delivers a ton of variations of classic American diner dishes that make my mouth water. 

POTATO PANCAKE EGGS BENEDICT. If you are in any way a lover of poached eggs in hollandaise sauce, this is it, man. I misread the description and assumed that the English muffin was replaced by the potato pancake, but you get BOTH. Carbs upon carbs upon carbs to wash away my bad decisions. Or maybe yours. I don't really drink. But this is the ultimate hangover cure. That hollandaise sauce is bomb. Perfectly poached eggs. Potato pancake that makes my Jewy heart sing. English muffin lost in all the madness, but swimming in yolk and sauce and deliciousness. Oh yeah, and there was fruit somewhere on the side. I left a very clean plate that would make my grandmother proud. 

And of course I tried all my friends' plates; isn't that normal? 

Fries and ranch: what the fuck is in this crack ranch?! IT'S SO GOOD. I didn't even need the fries so much as my finger, but let's face it, I'm a somewhat classy lady. I couldn't do that. Not with so many occupied tables nearby. -_-

Biscuits and Gravy: ENORMOUS portion! Enough to feed a linebacker. Biscuits so fluffy, I could sleep on them. Gravy so divine, I felt like I was in the south. 

Chocolate chip pancakes: one of the lesser indulgences on their sweet menu, but my friend didn't leave a bite on that plate. Plus points for serving sugar-free maple syrup so he could pretend like he wasn't one step closer to full-blown Diabetes for polishing off that meal. 

Service was so excellent. Our server, whose name I have now forgotten since it's been a few weeks, was on top of his game. Super friendly. Chatted with us about lots of random stuff. The meal was very reasonably-priced and I left feeling like I had made the best decision of our whole trip by coming here. What  can I say? I love food.

My only thought once we drove away was: ""WHY DIDN'T WE GET PIE?!?!""",n4usc2DF4pd9fdi2wLDloQ,3,2,5,AUalN1ACQwBzY6VCNM8RFg

Sunday's can be really busy but as of yet when this review is written  and while this location is rather new, the weekdays are not that busy.
This place reminded me of diners and family restaurants up in the Chicagoland area where I used to live.  It really had that big city vibe on that Sunday I went.  The countertop  seating  not facing the kitchen was a nice touch and is good for a solo dining experience and to do some B.S ing with the staff.

Had the vegetarian omelette which was fluffy, big and and tasty with 3 homemade pancakes as a side which were also fluffy and good.  The waitress was on top of it and often offered refills for the coffee.  
Here what their site says:

""All our Beef is U.S.D.A. Certified Choice Beef
Our Coffee is 100% Columbian, not a blend
Our Eggs are Certified by the U.S.D.A as Grade AA, the highest in the industry for quality and safety, and are size extra-large.
Fresh Blueberries
Our Bacon and Sausage are 100% Oscar Mayer.
Our orange juice is 100% pure juice, no water, no preservatives, never frozen, not from concentrate.
All our fruit compotes are homemade in our kitchens, not from the can. Every fruit compote will be served with slices of fresh fruit on top. Strawberries when out of season will be frozen"".

I have never once had a server talk to me during my whole meal. I think I just felt too hungry to give a shit about telling him off. I literally kept nodding my head the whole time as I'm stuffing huge bites in my mouth.

It had been bused but the seats had crumbs in them and the table had syrup and water dripped all over it. She saw us talking about the dirty table and came back by and asked what was wrong. We showed her the drips and she said ""oh, that's just water"". We had to show her that it was sticky and she said ""ok I'll wipe it down"". Granted, she did come back and wipe the table down, but I still ate my breakfast with someone else's crumbs in my seat. Call me old fashioned, but if a customer points out the table being dirty, it shouldn't matter if it's water or not.

Blueberry Hill has one of the LARGEST menu's I have ever seen. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and are open 24/7. The breakfast menu alone is around 4 pages long. I am the most indecisive person, so it took me some time to figure out what I wanted. I finally decided to get the chicken fried steak which comes with hash browns, eggs and toast. My friend got the Irish eggs benedict. Our server was nice but I didn't even get her name. She just kinda wandered by and took our order. Someone else brought us our coffee and water. I am not complaining, just saying that it felt a lot more informal than I am used to at most restaurants.

The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. I really enjoyed the chicken fried steak, and the gravy that came on top was really good. This place is also a bakery, and they have delicious cakes and pies for sale.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,4,3,wFfWzrpP3h_yCkyN0HdgtA

Some of the other locations are old and run down, but this ""new-ish"" location is well kept and modern while keeping its warm diner-esque feel. Late night specials for $5.99 are offered from 11pm-7am, daily specials are affordable at $7.99 a plate. 

We were two of four customers early this morning, waitress Nix took care of all of us. Great customer service! Very attentive and friendly. She seemed to get along really well with the other patrons. That small-town restaurant banter is hard to find in this city.

But now the Food!!!

I ordered the combo with steak, eggs and pancakes and a piece of apple pie from the best waitress this side of Heaven! If she hadn't been married and me being marriage adverse...I would of proposed on the spot and gone to visit Elvis downtown. She knew how to make a Man happy!

I really enjoyed the Steak, it was covered with grilled onions it was tender easy to cut and chew and packed with flavor. I had the scrambled Eggs they were fine as well...I didn't have any more room for the Pancakes and they did look dead sexy at the time.

The waitress said they are the best pancakes in Vegas, I will have to take her word on that because heating them up 24 hours later in the Microwave they were well...not so great.

The Dutch Apple Pie slice, she recommended to me as I was paying my bill was fanlickentastic. I want to go back an order a full pie ASAP!

We were seated in a booth almost immediately, and had a really nice waitress who had the diner customer service (sassy :D)attitude down.

I got a blueberry muffin, still warm out of the oven, and a bacon salsa omelette thing that I can't remember the name of. Both were delicious. My mom got pancakes, and definitely bit off more than she could chew as the portions here are huge. The coffee was also quite good.

To get to the minimum delivery amount, I also ordered meatloaf, which came with a side; I chose chili. The order arrived. I got back to my room and there is no cake, the only thing I wanted. 

I called the restaurant and Autumn tells me that she's absolutely sure that she packed the cake. I call the driver who says the woman didn't go over the order with her the way she usually does to ensure everything is there. I do the live chat with @Grubhub and they offered $3 for the cake. 

After talking to the driver, I called the restaurant again. Autumn answers the phone and, lo and behold, her story has changed. Somehow, there were TWO orders at the same time of meatloaf with a side of chili and chocolate cake. What are the odds?! And because the restaurant was so busy, she put the chocolate cake in with the other order. Never an apology, never a ""we'll get this right,"" just a ""we were really busy and I put the cake in the other bag."" 

Interestingly, when GrubHub called me, the guy said Autumn told him that SHE wasn't the one who packed my order. It was now ""the new girl"" who doesn't know the difference between one container and two. The solution offered by the restaurant is that I could come in and get the cake THEY forgot to pack. Now... if I had wanted to go to a restaurant, why would I have used GrubHub in the first place? I'd spend more on a cab than the cake was worth.

I tried one bite of the meatloaf and it was dry and flavorless. Had I been in the restaurant, I would have sent it back. It was inedible. There are hundreds of restaurant in Las Vegas. Avoid this one.",fE5BP3_CiVpSdnUiybSjzw,2,0,1,DdyDmu-XdkiKOXdyk5crMw

I feel like I would be doing a disservice to Blueberry Hill and it's possible patrons if I don't post a review on my recent visit.  First and foremost....PLEASE REMOVE the turkey dinner from your menu!  I've only been to your restaurant a couple of times and ordered breakfast both times.  In addition in both cases I visited the Decatur/W Charleston location.  I wouldn't have anything negative to say about my two previous visits.  On my most recent visit my husband and I stopped for a quick dinner on our way to a concert.  I love to have a traditional turkey dinner and have ordered that item at other restaurants with great enjoyment.  However on this occasion it was a colossal mistake.  Let me start with the gravy that covered every inch of my plate, first of all it was clear!  It had a weird gelatinous consistency and absolutely no flavor, matter of fact the entire dish had no flavor at all, I had to add salt and pepper to everything.  The stuffing, if you can call it that, was basically soggy bread crumbs.  The turkey was piled high but I'd prefer quality over quantity, although very dry it was at least edible once I scraped the gravy off.  The mashed potatoes were also edible without the gravy.  The corn was definitely straight out of a can but it was really the only item on the plate that I ate almost entirely.  I only wish I had taken a picture for further proof of just how horrible this menu item was.  If there were such thing as zero stars that what I would have given.  I implore Blueberry Hill to either remove or revamp this menu item.  On a positive note the Oreo cookie cake was very good.  But Being that my husbands meal, although edible wasn't much better than mine we've both vowed to NEVER eat at Blueberry Hill again.",QdD89rmrkdqrt1H2DLX4iQ,0,0,1,2eAXdYkGaQc0-r6MubuZvA

I ordered thier Giant Baked Ham Sandwich and it was huge! The menu says a quarter pound but I honestly think there's more in this one. Comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo and your choice of bread. You can also have curly fries or regular fries with it. 

This sandwich was definitly satisfying, more than enough and very reasonable at $9.99, thier menu is huge! So much to choose from, definitly no shortage of options. I'm not much for breakfast so I'll eat lunch food in the morning if I'm out, and there is a ton of options if you don't want to just be limited to lunch food.

So, after hanging out chillin in our room talking b.s. and drinking. We went out for a little walk around the new strip. After working up an appetite my sisters friend suggested for us to go here.

Now I'm the type of guy who couldn't pass up on a locals recommendation. I did the chorizo skillet which was definitely pretty good. It's too bad I had that nasty flu that was going around. You know the one that screwed with your taste buds, made you have no appetite what so ever.

Anyways, the service here was definitely pretty good. I think our server was one of two women who was doing the whole floor and she definitely kept up. Our waters and coffee were refilled and never did we ever have a long wait. Would definitely eat here again.

One horrible experience with him was, he had the nerve to write my order down incorrectly, so when I got home and realized I did not have my liquid crack, I had to drive all the way back.

2799017,2015-02-15,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"So,  the first time we dined at this Blueberry Hill our experience was OK. It was a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quickly,  service was OK, the restaurant was clean, food came out in a decent amount of time.  My daughter was happy with her chocolate chip pancakes,  boyfriend was satisfied with his steak and eggs, my ""little boy blue"" was meh. Portions were large,  prices are reasonably cheap,  flavor/seasoning was meh (my blueberry pancakes, while tasty on their own,  were smothered with an ample amount of blueberry goo... firm, almost hard, blueberries in a heavily corn starched ""sauce"").




The second time....

Again,  it was a Sunday. The lobby was full so we were expecting a half hour to 45 minute wait,  so imagine or surprise when the host informed us it was only going to be 10-15 minutes.  Score! We were seated in the allotted time,  however it took about 15 additional minutes for our server to greet us and another half hour for our order to reach the table.  

My daughter's medium steak came out very well done (dry with no pink). My over medium eggs came out sunny side up (I'm pregnant and ""shouldn't"" have eaten them but was starving at that point). Boyfriend's medium burger and over easy egg also came out disappointingly over done. Our friend's biscuits and gravy came out burnt? But as mentioned earlier,  we were super hungry/over it and didn't want to wait another hour for a refire... our server was nowhere to be found.  


To be fair,  we'll probably give this place another shot in a few months.   Until then,  we'll stick to our go-to weekend brunch spots with consistently awesome food,  consistently long wait times and consistent service (Mr. Mama's, Babystacks, and Eggworks).",ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ,0,0,2,VDFTGWsZ_tSMO_XTQ-6K5w

He proceeded to lie to me about the chips being freshly cut and pulled out a thermostat to prove to me that he checks the temperature of the chips that were served to me. I was taught the customer is always right; Donald proved to me that he is more concern  with being right then a repeat customer. On a good note my boyfriend loves his food.

I asked her why it's not on the menu and she said that it used to be but got removed at some point. She suggested I write a Yelp review to make the owners aware. So owners, you are now aware :)

3067582,2017-12-20,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"Overall just okay. I have been here dozens of times because I live close. This location is on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur not to mistake for the other location on Decatur across from Wal-Mart. The menu is just silly, way to big and full of food I know they dont sell everyday. Why sell food items you hardly get orders for. They should refine the menu and throw out 75% and just fix the items that are okay. Everything is so bland, they do not flavor the vegetables at all and other things really lack flavor. Only things okay are breakfast items, waffles are good, biscuit and gravy okay. I never really get everything I want though because they are not very flexible, if you wanna make adjustments it might cost $3 when they shouldn't. Service is funny, most servers are just okay and no one works together. They should help each other, refill drinks, ask if everything's okay because your server might not come around. I have literally never got an egg order right though, they always under cook eggs even if told how the yoke is preferred so don't be picky. They hand write receipts and use a hand calculator so confusing what you paid. The menu is confusing, a lady expected hash browns at the other table but was basically told sorry learn to read, no attempt to make them happy.

Today a friend and I came here for breakfast.  We waited about 15 minutes to be sat and were greeted right away with water and coffee from the ""busser"" I believe.

We even flagged down someone else who worked there and asked for our server.  We finally ordered which included a beverage.. 

We then received our food, still no drink, and there were breakfast potatoes instead of hashbrowns.  Rather than just apologizing and getting me what I ordered she showed me she had written down breakfast potatoes.. I work in F&B.. I don't really care what you write down.  I continued to wait for my drink until after the hashbrowns I ordered came out.  It was as if my drink was the dessert at the end.

Ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a ""hometown"" type diner. The staff is friendly and casual, the furniture and fixtures aren't the newest, nor are they the nicest, but they give off a warm atmosphere and it is very easy to feel comfortable here.

The service is always friendly and attentive. I couldn't ask for more from a five star restaurant, let alone a little family style diner. We always get smiles from our servers and our food is prepared quickly and correctly. Interacting with the staff here is always great.

The food is the highlight, undoubtedly. Blueberry Hill has an incredible menu and we've gotten a different item every single time we've been. It would take a long time to work your way through the entire offering. My personal recommendation is the four cheese French toast. Out of this world.

Blueberry Hill is a great place to get filled up for cheap and enjoy delicious food and gracious service. This is a ""comfort food"" place first and foremost. Nothing fancy, no glitz or glamour, just warmth and heartiness.",OBHDevxxNK5sYA_EDCASaQ,0,0,5,tPwNtOvklknTlPdWQoyJtA

Shortly must have ment 15 minutes because the busser with the coffee came by several times before we our water showed up.

Now our waiter, Josh, was a young kid. But boy did his face read disdain when he arrived at our table. We ordered right away. My mother ordered a piece of blueberry pie, I ordered the Bonanza, and my 5 year old ordered the kids mac'n'cheese with fries. 

Then we played the waiting game. Which actually didn't take long at all. My mom received her pie right away. Somewhat to our disappointment because we figured all our found would arrive together. Then came the other meals. I really wish we had taken pictures of the food. My ""scrambled eggs"" were a little on the runny side. and two pieces of bacon were somewhat burnt. (my daughter actually ate those) Her mac'n'cheese though had burnt noodles, or cheese or whatever it was. She took one bite and almost threw up on the table. Now she's a picky kid so I tried it.... She wasn't lying. It was thick and not creamy and tasted of the burnt whatever. So what does she do? Go to town on the fries.I really don't blame her for not eating it.

So here comes Josh, oh Josh, he asks how everything is and my daughter immediately replies ""It's gross!"" to which I then in turn tell him it was, when he reached for the plate I asked him to leave it because she was eating the fries.

The building was renovated a couple years back and the interior looks great -- reminiscent of bakeries/cafes out east with dark wood accents and floral cushions. The place is spacious with comfortable booths found throughout and TVs scattered around the dining room. It's not just a breakfast spot either, their extensive menu spans breakfast, lunch and dinner with a decidedly American bent, but plenty of options like Mexican and Italian fare. 

Their version of chicken and waffles ($9.79) consists of four small and breaded, coconut chicken tenders with just enough coconut flavor to taste without dominating the flavor. The waffle was pretty basic, but after pouring syrup on everything, it was delicious. Potato pancakes ($8.79) were pretty much giant hash browns. Three of them nicely fried and crispy. An order of kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.69) was massive. Much larger than any kid should eat and definitely large enough for 3 kids to share. The pancakes have chocolate in the batter and are topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. Clearly this isn't a healthy choice, but fuck it... I have a sweet tooth and so does my kid.

Service was less than stellar with a grumpy older lady taking our orders and occasionally checking back on us. For those who don't want to sit at a table or booth, there's a bar area just inside the main dining room.

Blueberry Hill on Flamingo is in an old Marie Calendar's so the booths are big and comfortable.  Their menu is huge and has a dish to suit any craving.  They have a full bar which is a lot of fun too.  So, now the bad stuff. First and foremost, I DON'T WANT TO EAT TEFLON. Their skillets are served in the scratched up teflon egg pans that are no longer useful for quick-flipping eggs.  When teflon is scratched it chips and gradually comes off the pan.  Teflon is toxic.  It would quit easily get into your food.  The fact that they are using these for table service is UNBELIEVABLE.  Either strip all of the teflon off or throw them in the trash.  Those pans are not meant for table service.  They look cheap and the chipped teflon freaks me out.  The other problem I have is the over abundance of offensive noise.  The music is often too loud and the playlists are alternately depressing or irritating.  The volume on the television sets are often turned up as well so you are forced to listen to a mix of commercials on the TV and bad music from the PA.  I like that the staff is high-energy and has a lot of hustle but sometimes they make quite a racket slamming down silverware and shouting across the room.  The patrons are forced to raise their voices above all of this to hear each other with the overall effect being a constant assault on the senses.

I went years ago and had a hair in my honey coconut chicken so I stopped going.  Recently a friend suggested going there so I thought I'd give it a try. Basically in two weeks I have been here 3 times. All three times I asked if the carrot cake has buttercream or cream cheese frosting, NO ONE KNOWS! I get varying answers so last night the hostess offered me a very small slice, paper thin so I could find out, because carrot cake can only have cream cheese frosting or I won't eat it. But in this paper thin slice what did I find? A BLACK HAIR. A fairly decent sized one. Luckily I saw it first thing, I pointed it out and said hopefully the rest of the cake isn't like that. At this point I simply don't care what kind of frosting it is because I will sadly NEVER go again.  The cook I saw behind the line wasn't wearing a hair net or a hat either.

- waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated despite only one party in front of us and tons of empty tables
- waited more than 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order (we were ready to order food, but he told us he couldn't take food orders and would get someone)
- waited another 10 minutes before we were able to flag down someone else to take our food order
- waited nearly 40 minutes more for our food to arrive

To top it off, our order was messed up in multiple ways (wrong type of toast, eggs cooked wrong, missing hash browns), and when we asked to complain to a manager, we were left waiting long enough that we just decided to pay the bill and leave.

The Blueberries are not fresh- they are frozen and tasteless, even the cup of blueberries they gave me on the side (which were thawed, cold and nasty) - the chefs should pop one in their mouth and see what they're serving people. People must be fooled by the blueberry compote they pile on of these pancakes. I opt out of the canned blueberry filling on top of blueberry pancakes so the ""real"" flavors can come through. This was very disappointing. Blueberry pancakes should never be made with old, unthawed blueberries.

The eggs and bacon were great though and so was the omelette my husband had, so I'm sure other breakfast items might be delish- will try something different if I come back again which I probably won't because there are sooo many other places to eat in Las Vegas.

The muffins are awesome.  You can also order them grilled which added an extra dimension to their already delicious muffins.  The topping on the muffin tops are so good.

Apple pancakes also very good and you get A LOT of them!  Light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweet.  The only weird thing I found was that they serve the cooked and raw apples with the rinds on.  It didn't really add any value to the apple taste.

The cheese burger was very good too.  They boast never frozen, 100% angus beef.  Whatever it was, it was juicy and flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I do wish they seasoned it more, however, I guess they need to cater to a broad spectrum of tastes.

When we left, I noticed their display for ribs.  THEY SERVE IT ON A BAKING SHEET!!! Whoa!  Going to have to try it!  Lol and split it among 2-3 people!",7ZSjntRADa_sV8vbTk_j5g,0,0,5,HS-xHRtHYsOALJuDbxES8g

I love BlueBerry Hill. I've brought my mom, family and Fiance here a couple times. And we have family visiting next month and plan to bring them here. ...BUT...NOW we might not come. 

June 14, 2017 approximately 8:30pm. We came for a late dinner. I called ahead of time to see if there was a wait. I was told no. When we got there we had the wait like 5 minutes for them to clear off tables. ...restaurant wasn't even a 1/4 full. And many tables were already set up. Then the Hostess seats us all by ours ourselves in another section of the restaurant.  Tell us our waitress will be right with us....nope....after like 10-12 minutes we had to send my son to ask for our waitress. ..then she came over.. didn't greet or even apologize for I ur wait.. just asked if we know what we want.

We order a Monte Cristo Sandwich and I Double Chesse burger. She asked if I wanted the one with Chili. I said Definitely not. Just the cheese burger. She said okay left.   

After a few she brought over our food. My son order was right expect for no extra sauce on the side as requested.  And she handed me a Chili Chesse Burger.  I said oh no, I didn't order that.  I said I can't have Chili, I have intense heartburn. That would be a bad thing for me to have. She said oh, I thought you order it. She didn't apologize nor say she would handle it, instead she said can we just scrape off the Chili? She said I have a group of 18 over there.

 What?!?!?!!!!

I was offended that she ask to scrape off the chili off my burger and give me the same sandwich back. She didn't offer to make me a new one. I told her it's already late and if she not able to just get me a new one soon. Go ahead, I couldn't have the Chili.  She ended up taking it back to the kitchen then brought it back to me. 

As habit I took the top patty off to ear and noticed there was still chili on the burger. They just swapped the bottom for the top patty. I wasn't happy at all but it was coming on the 9:30 now she came back and ask if we were okay. We pointed out the problem and I said I don't feel like I should have to pay for a this kind this. She said no, I'm going to waive the charge for it. She said she just wants to make it right. I said it will be fine. I WAS through the roof, upset at this point. 

I started eating one of the patties, then a few minutes later she brings me a new burger. I said okay, I didn't ask her to do that. I Ended up eat like half and boxed the rest up due to me losing my appetite.  

After she brought me the second hamburger,  we were completely ignored by all staff members.  Until the Hostess came over to bring me the ticket.  So obviously wasn't ask if everything was okay, do we want dessert,  is there anything else like drink refills .. 

When we went up to pay the tickets was showing full price. I told to the hostess that our server said she would to comp the burger due to a mix up. She asked the waitress she said no, she ended up getting the right one. I said excuse me, you said you would take care of her. She mumbled something and the Hostess changed my total. 

I was completely disturbed how the situation was taken care of and the to do it.

I am going to reach out to management in the morning.

4225462,2018-06-16,0,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"When I first came to Las Vegas seven years ago I ate at the BH on Decatur at Charleston. It was disastrous. Another year or two went by and I figured that it was a fluke. No, no, I had an almost identical experience and said, ""Never again!"" 

Now, years later, I was talked into going to a different BH on West Flamingo. 

This is what happened: The table staff started to pour coffee into a cup that was clearly dirty. The staff was looking directly into the cup and beginning to pour when I pointed out how dirty the cup was. 

Back with a new cup, he filled it and left. I looked around the table for some Half and Half and there wasn't any. Lots of chemical choices but I don't like the aftertaste. I had to wait a considerable time to get H&H and by then my coffee was cold. 

The restroom: Only one toilet (!) and it was filthy. I haven't felt the need to use a tissue toilet seat cover for probably 30 years but I had to at BH.

Then the hand dryer just made a little rattling noise and put out no air.

I ordered the Oreo pancakes & my two friends ordered a simple breakfast platter & fried chicken.

We waited almost an hour for our food. The old guy who got seated after us (he looked like a regular) got his food almost immediately along with a few more tables surrounding us.

The bar was empty so they were not that busy.

When we tried to ask for our waitress, the man we tried to flag down just ignored us thinking ""you are not my table....""

All our food came out one at a time in about 5 minute increments.

My pancakes were still soggy/wet/uncooked in the middle.

The waitress asked us if there was anything else we needed to which I replied, ""sugar-free syrup."" I had to repeat myself because she did not listen the first time.

First my experience here was pretty good we were seated by a host in less than 5 mins (lunchtime) very friendly staff

Server arrived fairly quick and was friendly greeted with smiles...served us beverages we ordered apple juice (which was cold some places neglect serving cold apple juice for whatever reason) but the water tasted like tap some people like myself are fairly anal about that but I couldn't bare drinking it 

Next server took our order which was a basic four , four , four breakfast with eggs , bacons and pancakes and also I ordered the speciality cinnamon pancakes 

After that the speed in which we received our food was legendary, however as most know that's not always a good thing could mean cold food or just bad quality HOWEVER that was not the case the pancakes were extremely delicious, bacon was average as well as eggs but i stand firm these our the best pancakes in town by far...

One thing I did not like at all was we were served our checked with our food basically.. it made me feel like I was rushed this was a family trip so we weren't at the bar we were at the table.. I suggest future reference that they present the check when they are 100% for certain the customer is satisfied. It can give off a bad vibe if you present the check with the dinner.

As you walk in you are greeted with a waiting area in the lobby and a specials board (mimosas & bloody marys were on that board today) as well as a grand display of cakes and pies See my photos to see what was in todays case! Mmmmm. Carrot cake!!!!

The dining room has lots of seatings for small or large groups as well as an old school diner style seating at the counter.

Everything came out quick along with my coffee and OJand my little was satisfied with her chocolate milk ($3.09 and no refills) dang!!! Thats okay she was pleased especially with that whipped cream for her waffles

Like it's really too big its way past the point of diversity and just takes way too much time to go through just to see all your options (I like small and simple). Anyway we ordered the pancakes all around (buttermilk, fresh apple, and smiley face) while we waited I took the kids to the bathroom to wash their hands and the men's bathroom smelled terrible and was pretty unclean I cringed thinking my toes might touch the floor in my flip flops. Came back and food was there quickly but the portions were MASSIVE which is usually nice but I wouldve rather paid less and gotten half since pancakes don't really reheat the best. Gf sent back her pancakes because they were too tough and the server was very nice and insistent that we did so and took it off our bill hastily which was really nice. My fresh apple pancakes were pretty good but I'm a big guy and I could only finish half of them. 
Overall this place seems to be really popular but it's just not my piece of cake. Really think they should have smaller portions and not just serve and charge for your breakfast and reheated lunch. Probably won't come back since I feel iHop is better. 
3 stars because of the bathrooms and the all the food besides mine wasn't really that good.",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,0,0,3,7GoYTzh12xCU_bKHwSrg4Q

The eggs Benedict came out looking super tasteful! The diced potatoes were so delicious, I wish I ordered some to-go! 

The kids menu is so full of many choices, I was surprised my daughter took a VERY long time to decide. Her pancakes came out looking so appealing to her, she chowed it down so fast.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all the Strip Buffet's and fine dinning but sometimes your just not in the mood for all the ""extra"" aka waiting, driving, etc.. so having a place like Blueberry Hill off the strip and near our hotel (walking distance) was ideal. 

Its a traditional breakfast restaurant with a lot of options (can be good or can be bad) but you know it will carry the staples from Pancakes, French Toast, Waffles, Omelettes, sandwiches, soups,.... you get the point. Excellent food and breakfast was consistent with what we expected. Our selections of food varied from the Waffle w/coconut Chicken, Chocolate chip pancakes (lots of chocolate chips), spaghetti, and Tender Pork Loins with a few sides. Again, we were all over the place but everyone was happy. 

When ordering, ask questions and don't expect it to be the same thing you got back in you home town at the local breakfast spot. For example, it comes with sausage... is it a link or a patty, is it port or beef... is it fried or panko covered, what's in the salad, can i get it on the side... you get the point. 

Over server was cool and kept the refills of water and soda's coming. They have a great selection of desserts to choose from when your getting ready to leave (mainly cakes).

We decided to start the New Year off right, with a delicious breakfast with friends.  
We arrived at about 10am, right before the big rush.  There was no wait. 

The restaurant has a huge waiting area right up front.  Probably the biggest waiting area I've seen since Mimi's Café.  
Its well lit, and very clean.  

Our server was phenomenal.  I really wish I'd jotted down her name.  She was friendly.  Prompt. Super nice.  She double checked our orders, and kept our coffee cups full.  
Shall I mention the PLETHORA of flavored creamers she brought out for us?  I've never had a place bring so many before, and I use a lot, so this was perfect.

I know its odd, but I love the mugs that they served the coffee in.  I have a thing for mugs, and there's just something comforting about a big, thick, sturdy mug.  They have them for sale here, and I just might have to come back and buy one.

The Eggs Benedict Florentine (Eggs Benedict with no Canadian bacon, with mushrooms and spinach) with a side of potato pancakes instead of regular potatoes or fruit. (Small upcharge.  Totally worth it.)
The Waitress Special:  an 8 oz ham steak with 2 eggs (over medium for hubby) and a Belgian waffle.  

I didn't try my husband's eggs and ham, as I REALLY dislike ham.  He loved it though.  I did, however, steal a bite of his waffle, and it was absolute perfection.  

MY meal was delicious.  I absolutely adore eggs benedict, and I only get to eat it maybe twice a year.  The eggs were poached perfectly.  The hollandaise was creamy and delightful, and everything was seasoned well.   
My potato pancakes were delightful.  Served with sour cream and applesauce, they were light and delicate.  A touch underseasoned, but I'd rather they be underseasoned than over.  They were spectacular.  

I definitely plan to go back again.  And this time, I won't wait for 8 years.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,6,4,zZikPgF46KwEZO1s1MNd8Q

Newly opened in a renovated Marie Callender's on West Flamingo near Yonaka, it was in forgoing one last stop at The Griddle Café that I entered the newest location of family owned local favorite Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant, and with service as friendly and efficient as ever it was a five-part order that constituted breakfast as well as later-day snacks - some items absolutely delicious, while others decidedly lacked.

Located on a busy corner, with a parking lot nearly filled to capacity by 9:00am though the enormous restaurant was only perhaps 2/3 full, it was with the first of several cups of 100% Arabica coffee that the meal began and with bold flavor and a smooth finish one must say this is an area where Blueberry Hill excels, a statement no less justified in describing the 'limited' run of Blueberry Muffins, baked fresh each day and served warm with a streusel top and sidecar of butter, quick to sell out and ""gone when they're gone.""

Having sampled the Monte Cristo and Oreo Pancakes on a prior visit to the Decatur location it was once again in two entrees that appetite was invested and with a rich buttermilk recipe handed down since 1966 the supple texture of a 3-stack of pancakes was only improved by smooth whipped cream and a handful of melting chocolate chips, a chocolate fudge drizzle requested in place of the included syrup making things all the more decadent at absolutely no additional charge.

Moving next to something somewhat savory, suffice it to say that Blueberry Hill's Chicken and Waffles is nothing like that which one will find down South, yet having watched a young line-cook hand batter each strip in the kitchen, roll it in coconuts, and then toss it in a fryer the attention to detail was appreciated as each piping hot piece paired nicely to a pliable golden waffle well suited to soak up a drizzle of honey and plenty of butter soaked in the same.

At this point happily sated, but with a long wait at the car dealership ahead, it was with two slices of cake made in the on-site bakery that I took my leave and although the carrot cake was dry, spongy, and almost entirely devoid of flavor aside from sweetness from the cream cheese icing the Blueberry Crumb cake was a masterful composition with moist yellow cake, buttery crumbles, and bursting blueberries beneath bright blue frosting that tasted surprisingly natural, and not overly sweet.

A bit more expensive than chains such as IHOP, but obviously committed to using better ingredients and taking extra steps to assure customer satisfaction, Blueberry Hill remains one of Las Vegas' best 24/7 locally owned stops - the sort of place I'd probably never eat dinner, but one where breakfast is never a bad choice.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,4,4,bfQuA7uA-EeD9dZ_hic43w

My husband got the dealers special, eggs scrambled, choice of meat, he gets the ham steak, hash browns and toast. The ham steak is a generous portion, grilled and smoked. 

Because we both love pancakes, we added the cinnamon pancakes! The are so good. The cakes are light and fluffy, sprinkled in cinnamon and drizzled with a powder sugar icing. Just enough sugar to put you in a coma for the rest of the day!

Well after sitting in a dirty dusty booth I immediately regretted my decision but my kid said mom come on don't be like that. 

Anyhow we ordered cheese stuff French toast with fruit and the Triple 4.  

First off their sausage links for charging more then a Denny's or IHOP which I never go to , are disgusting.  There is no meaty quality they are soft , mushy and a slight grayish color.  The bacon thin crispy salty of low quality and he eggs were just whatever.

Well my spikey red haired waitress I called her over to show her my pancake was pure batter in the middle and she takes my whole plate with eggs and all on it back to the kitchen I was absolutely shocked , disgusted and puzzled.  Wtf you see the pancake is messed up ! Wtf why did you take my whole plate with my food to the back then bring it back out had me scrape my food and take the batter pancake back? Made absolutely zero sense 

So she has two more pancakes made without even asking me what I wanted to do. The biting of the battery pancake was revolting and left me feeling putrid all night  

She then says ""O honey I understand I'm not mad at you"" are you freakin kidding me ? Mad at me ? For what for being victim for your over priced horrid food.  I have half the mind to call the health department because I guarantee things need to be cleaned up back there 


I quickly threw cash on the table and bolted out taking the two freshly made pancakes with us.  We have them to a homeless guy closer towards Decatur. 

Seriously Denny or iHop has much better quality food and service.  How about next time your client goes chomping unknowingly on a uncooked pancake leaving a batter disgusting mess in their mouth you don't make them pay for that crap. I'm still upset this morning and I feel sick now.  

That French toast thing the cream cheese on the inside was lumpy and tasteless and the whole toast was covered in powdered sugar   Icing I ate it just to get the damn moment of the pancake out of my mouth and I'm regretting it over and over now. 

You will get better quality meat and eggs anywhere  se McDonald's Burger King anywhere.  You tourists who want breakfast and don't go here go to a casino where the food is good quality and the servers actually know how to treat customers and amped situations and have customer service not just thirsty for a higher tip.

Both times we were greeted by the lovely staff members and sat in the seats that we requested (once at the bar and once at a table with access to a power outlet).

The food is great and has that 'home cooked' feel to it.  Portions are HUGE so bear that in mind.  Both times we ordered different dishes and we said, we should have split everything.

Overall I am a fan and would recommend to anyone who wants a decent meal in a 'familiar' environment.  Get here early on the weekends though.  When we left on Saturday around 10am there were a number of groups waiting to be seated.",UBmnISiLKFQNdqD8_FsgMw,1,0,4,QQ2y13hW1OzAZ4o5j68JGQ

I ordered the classic turkey dinner which was $12.99 for a complete turkey dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert! The sage stuffing was delicious and the gravy was so tasty! They really packed on the turkey which was tender along with stuffing, mashed taters and corn.

My guest ordered the cherry glazed Ham dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert for $12.99.

This was a lot of food and both of our meals were delicious! This was a Holiday special keep in mind however I would make a visit even if not a holiday to have a turkey dinner which is always on their menu!

I really enjoyed this new location as it was clean, bright and comfortable.

The dessert counter looks Amazing as you walk in the front door. The hardest part was deciding on what dessert to order at the end which we asked them to pack up to go.

We will be back for sure to enjoy a nice restaurant meal and experience!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,3,4,q5bSguxEwR-cR1xKY5Tq2Q

The prices are a bit high, IMO, but considering the quality of the food and the amount of food, the prices are not too unreasonable.

I went with my mom and my two year old.  The 3 of us shared a Spinach and Mushroom Omelette and we didn't even finish all of our breakfast.  Omelettes are made with 4 eggs and come with your choice of side (3 homemade buttermilk pancakes, 2 wedges of french toast, or hashbrowns and toast).  We opted for the 3 buttermilk pancakes.  They were delicious,  thick, fluffy, and great flavor.  I was impressed that they were served with real butter and it was whipped.  Nice!  Also, the syrup comes to the table warm in a syrup dispenser (no cold syrup from a single serve pack).  

The omelette was good, nothing too special, but good.

We told our waitress we were sharing and she was very accommodating and brought us extra plates.  We asked for more butter and she brought us a large portions of that glorious whipped real butter.

Went again with the husband and baby and I ordered the Ham and Cheese Omelette with pancakes.  Omelette was cheesy and tasty.  Pancakes were still delicious.  Again, asked for more butter and got a huge dollop of real butter (the pancakes probably come with plenty of butter but I like A LOT of butter, especially when it is real and whipped).  

My husband ordered the Blueberry's Meat Lover's Skillet.  He loved it (and he is not afraid to let me know when he thinks something is not so bueno).  He said it had tons of meat, but not too much, and the pieces of meat were large and great quality.  He had plenty to bring home and had it the next day from breakfast and still did not finish it!

Both times our servers were extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive.  The ambience is nice and they had sports on the tv's through out the restaurant.  It reminds me a bit of a Mimi's Cafe or Marie Calendar's, as far as style, but a small step up and much better food.  

Menu is huge with tons of variety.  There is something for everyone, anytime of day.  Oh, and the cakes in the front look amazing.",IEfrWahq335dd6vol7pgog,0,0,4,4DG8n5Vh3hiBvnkS5lUt5w

5959360,2014-11-10,3,7nRlDLrob6oK5zmGo4Vpbg,"This is the newest Blueberry Hill. It opened up a little over a week ago on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur and replaced what used to be a Marie Callender's. 

They didn't change much as far as interior decor goes, but I am glad after quote a while of this location being vacant that there is a new restaurant in the area. Even better to have a new breakfast spot. 

On this occasion, my mom and I stuck to the dinner menu and they have several grand opening specials going on now. We opted for dinner entrees and received a free dessert. The menu is huge and after a long time of perusing I decided on the honey coconut chicken with a side of fries and green beans. I do not like canned veggies, so I avoided the green beans, but enjoyed the rest of my meal. The chicken was moist and not overly sweet like I was expecting. My mom enjoyed her pork chops and for dessert I ordered the carrot cake and my mom went with the blueberry pie. She enjoyed her, but I felt mine was a little dry for my taste. I took it home and my fella enjoyed it quite a bit, so it's more of a acquired taste.

I'm usually a fan of this chain's breakfasts, so I'll be back for that. They also have an enormous assortment of desserts to choose from that are all made in house. 

The food is nothing amazing, but it's solid and this location is a lot nicer than others in town.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,RMI7jXa7fYjcJPco0fL4Cg
