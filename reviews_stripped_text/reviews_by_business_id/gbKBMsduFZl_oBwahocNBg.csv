303447,2012-08-07,3,gbKBMsduFZl_oBwahocNBg,"There's a new truck in town!  And they serve.... Snowballs?

WTF are snowballs?

Sorry, I'm an east coast girl and I've never heard that term before.  But from what I gather (based on the two snowballs we ordered), they are pretty much snow cones with a cuter name.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Anyway, they were parked outside of Bass Pro on a painfully hot Saturday.  Lured by the promise of a frozen treat I made a beeline straight for the truck and met an incredibly friendly owner.  I went with the recommendation of the root beer float flavor (one I was already considering) and added a scoop of ice cream for an extra $1.  I was leery of the idea of ice cream, but what fun is life if you don't take any risks?  Risks that involve ice cream?

I have to say that the ice cream made it for me.  As odd as it sounds it turned out to be a delicious frozen root beer float with sweet vanilla ice cream, chunks of ice, and root beer.  Trust me, it works.

My only complaint is that I wish the ice was shaved finer.  It's pretty coarse in texture and has a lot of crunch.  But maybe that's the way snowballs are supposed to be?

My husband ordered some special that was named after Spiderman (the nerd couldn't resist- he didn't even look at the ingredients in it).  It had a flavor similar to a snow cone you would get from the ice cream man when you were little, except this one has some chocolate too.  I didn't care for the chocolate in it, but my husband did it and that's all that mattered.

An inexpensive way to cool off in this terrible, awful heat plus it's owned by some really sweet people.  Make a stop if you see their truck!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,4,4,4,0BgAtmWe0cSKfMTFAHJmxg

My favorite is the ""Super Awesome"" this is a blend of Root Beer, Coke and Vanilla Ice Cream with snow cone ice throughout. It is the best cold drink for summer. Not too sweet, cold, a bit creamy and completely delicious. You can find Sin City Snoballs around town at Bass Pro Shops at the Silverton, Las Vegas STreats and the Farmer's Market in Summerlin on Vegas and Rampart.

3467212,2013-02-02,1,gbKBMsduFZl_oBwahocNBg,"Sin City Snoballs and Snacks deserve all of the Yelp love in the world and I'm going to be the man for the job. As the unofficial marketing rep for SCS&S(wow that's a mouthful) I'll fill you in on why this food truck is here to stay. At first I was greeted with warm smiles and an explanation of everything offered on the truck. I was then given a sample of their warm apple cider, Belgian hot chocolate, and a donut. This Jew was head over heels at this point because free food is the way directly to my heart.

After experiencing just a taste of what this truck had to offer I had to splurge for the Maple and Bacon glazed donuts. That's right, you heard correctly, MAPLE AND BACON. The donuts themselves were perfectly fried and crisp yet deliciously moist inside. They use real maple syrup and crispy bacon for a combination that is sure to make you the life of any party you show up to. I passed some off to fellow Yelpers and they seem officially hooked. 

I ended off my experience with a full hot apple cider with a scoop of ice cream on the bottom and on a cold night this can only be described as blissful. The combination makes it feel like you are drinking grandma's apple pie(unless of course your grandma can't bake). 

If you are looking for something sweet and filling, or you just want to be warmed up on a cold Las Vegas night, look no further than Sin City Snoballs & Snacks. Don't forget to tell them Jonathan S. sent you. Oh wait, I'm just the unofficial marketing rep. Damnit!",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,1,1,5,X6P2coJ1qlZ-twJIcJvGEA

4012332,2013-05-28,17,gbKBMsduFZl_oBwahocNBg,"The snoballs were alright, not the best but Summer is coming up.  The owner is where this goes downhill.

First words out of my mouth, ""Hey I'm just taking a picture of your food truck because I'm a foodie and I love how you guys are out at Bruce Trent on Wednesdays at farmers market.""  

The response I got would make you say ""Really?""  No matter what circumstances you're in, if you're the owner you just can't be rude.  And I dealt with a rude owner.  I feel bad for the angry troll though, if it was anyone other than me I'm guessing they would apologize to the owner and move on.  I guess it's all fake smiles and thank you's when they're taking your money because when business is not in service I got treated and verbally attacked by the male half of the owners for wanting to take a photo of his food truck.  

With the garage door open, owner standing outside, food truck parked on the street, I figure I can go and take a picture of the chameleon cartoon on the truck with the electrical flap down.  If you look at the picture I posted, the electrical outlet gets plugged into the Gecko's groin area, really?  I wasn't trying to be sneaky about it.  And that's where he blew up in my face.

You own a polarizing food truck, the fuck you didn't think it was going to bring a little bit of attention?  Pictures go snap snap, he acted like his shit was about to get pushed in by the snap snap.  I take good photos, snap snap.  If this review goes down say hi to code enforcement or parking enforcement for me.

I've stopped by maybe five times at their food truck during farmers market on Wednesday's at Bruce Trent and held back on giving the appropriate 3 star review so it wouldn't hurt their ratings but this encounter last night was unbelievable.  Having had Snow Ono in the past and in their absent having to settle for Sin City Snoballs wasn't too bad.  For those of you out there reading, there's a difference between shaved ice and snowballs.  I prefer shaved ice, especially with Oso Ono out there now whose ice is always covered with syrup.

I recently stopped by again on 05/22/13 before the Arepas food truck.

Would I ever buy from them again?  No, because that smile and greeting is fake.  Angry little trolls lol.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,11,4,1,eyyl1h3A3JDic0LSdZrBDQ
4089983,2013-07-26,0,gbKBMsduFZl_oBwahocNBg,"As luck would have it, we spotted this fun & colorful truck right outside ""Outdoor World"" in Silverton. There was a tiny crowd surrounding it, so as human nature would have it, we were curious as to what it was all about. Oooooh, shaved ice. Awesome! Root beer, shaved ice? Whoa, even better! The customer service is great! Everything is explained...I can't remember any of it, but I felt assured that if I had any questions, she would be more than happy to answer them. My youngest son had a banana split shaved ice which weirded him out because it wasn't really a banana split--it's shaved ice! What? He took his first bite & nodded his head & all was well. ;-) My 10 year old loves sorbet so he went for the fruity shaved ice & enjoyed it. The husby & I shared...wait for it...yup! The root beer shaved ice. Really good, but after awhile, it got too sweet for me so the husby had the rest (he not-so-secretly loved that I basically gave up). The ice cream sandwich was delicious too. My only complaint is that it was fairly pricey...almost $30.00 for 2 medium shaved icees, 1 large one & an ice cream sandwich. Phew! But it's a special treat & we're not from the area (not even from the State)...so despite the burn on the wallet, we had to give it a try.",PPIbnhlP_OQF8bdrm_9CmA,1,0,4,lP4_ko94EdstMvd_Pi-bsg

4979524,2014-07-19,0,gbKBMsduFZl_oBwahocNBg,"109 degrees and hours of outlet mall shopping calls for a nice, cold, sweet treat - so my friends and I decided to stop by Sin City for a snowball or two (more like 7, but don't judge). 

I'm going to jump right in. The short tatted woman taking orders will be the reason why I won't be trying this place out again. Here's why - 

So.....prior to taking our order, there were a group of young girls ahead of us that this woman (for the sake of this review I will refer to her as Jane. I didn't get her name and I don't want to keep referring to her as ""this woman"") was completely enamored with. While we were waiting, she flirted with them for about 5 minutes. Hey, I'm all about getting it in when you can, but hell, it's 109 degrees and I want a damn snowball. After about 7 minutes of endless macking, she noticed my agitation and finally asked what we would like to order. As she's writing down our orders, Jane receives a call on her cell. She stops taking our order so she can answer her phone. We were not asked to wait nor were there any apologies for the interruption.  

After the call ended she began taking our orders again. There were a total of 5 of us in the group. She took two of our orders, then turned her back and began having a side conversation about how those ""fine ass girls"" had her completely confused and disoriented. We had to tell her several times that there were more orders that needed to be taken before she finally turned her attention back to us. 

One of my friends asked for a recommendation. Jane recommended a tigers blood/cherry/strawberry concoction. My friend decided to go with that one. In all, it took her about 10 minutes to place orders for five folks - did I mention it was 109 degrees outside? It took another 10 minutes for everyone to get their order, and here's why - she mixed up all the red snowballs, so everyone ended up with someone else's. For some reason, they don't write the flavors on the cup, so Jane had no idea what snowball belonged to whom. Remember that tigers blood/cherry/strawberry concoction she recommended? Well Jane wrote the order incorrectly (did I mention that she's the one that recommended it?) so we had to wait while they made another one.  

While we were trying to get this whole thing sorted out, Jane receives another call, and she, yep you guessed it, answered it. Are you kidding me??? We've been standing here over 20 minutes due to your complete incompetence and you take another phone call??? Did I mention it was 109 degrees outside? At this point, a woman I believe to be the owner finally stepped in. She was very nice, patient and polite. She fixed the orders and even gave us two free snowballs, but unfortunately the damage had been done. 

In terms of the actual snowballs - to paraphrase the great Dennis Green, they were what we thought they were - in this case, crushed ice and flavored syrup. They were good - not great and definitely not worth waiting for in 109 degree weather. 

In conclusion, Jane needs to go. Poor customer service + F-ing up my snowball + 109 degree weather = one pissed off customer. Maybe I'll try this place again in a year or so in hopes that Jane would have been fired by then, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",n63FlQCZZrP9063mmneAxg,0,0,2,85n7_XwuR6bES3nbH6ebxQ
