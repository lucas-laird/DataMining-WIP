Really huge with a really great all beef wiener.  The wiener is high quality with the perfect mix of spices and garlic. It is juicy as well.  The crust is perfectly crunchy, flavorful, and not greasy.  Considering the size, taste, and quality, this is a really good value.  This is a corn dog that you will remember for years!",rUCs3RXx860yY95TmL-0-g,0,0,5,5diwZY9Xja0SzR2st5_zTQ

I really enjoyed the corn dog and cheese bomb with honey.  They are light, fluffy and fresh.  They didn't make my stomach hurt from grease.  I would recommend the corn dog company over worlds best corn dog any day!  Prices are great hope to see them around town more.",RLE5ACJiCY95Qi71LOgtYA,0,0,5,O3oW5OkO-2cvL7b35CDnFg

Only problem can not ever find them to give repeat business.  We found them at RC Wiley in Henderson.
It's to bad because they are really good. They do have competition in Vegas with another corn dig truck.  That has were they are every day on there website, Facebook, yelp so hopefully they will also so we can find them.  Corndog if you can find them over 5 stars. Finding them 1 star so I guess 4 stars.",V0eycUQ4LkwoHSUJKqR-_A,0,0,4,9t7zcbmr-RoqZcmRIU3LtQ

I have been a long time customer of their St George truck and now I can get my corndog fix right here in town. They have been posting up all over but recently I found them at the Food Truck Party near Total Wine in Centennial. The corndogs are huge and fried to perfection and don't forget to tell them to add honey. Ketchup and mustard are usually near the sodas in a cooler by the ordering window. People working the truck are friendly. If you are able to track down this truck then I suggest you give it a try it's worth every penny.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,15,13,5,-iyOLcx4Wy3MVhGjDNuGAQ

Luckily, the Corndog Company actually makes really good corndogs, available in half and quarter pound sizes. They recommend getting this with a honey drizzle, which I've never heard of but actually offsets the saltiness of the dog nicely without adding to the heaviness of the fried outer shell. Add mustard for some extra contrast. I haven't had a corn dog in ages but the one I had here was not only tasty but surprisingly  light on the oil. Looking forward to seeing them at another community event soon!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,12,4,8V27RXLVtUimuMe1LdcuGw

The dog itself is juicy and flavorful. What I also like it that the corn dog batter does not over power the taste of the dog itself. It all goes together so well.

I would have never thought to put honey on a corn dog; What Have I Been Missing!?

The menu is simple so, there's not much to think about besides the size of your dog and how good it's going to taste. 

Next I'll be trying the cheese dog because my co workers are raving about it saying the cheese is delicious.

Thanks for stopping by!

1. Will recommend
2. Will order again",Mu5-XuedcXU8P7ecoTuUdA,2,1,5,vworun9CNiKm_45JsWY6Dw

I hired The Corndog Company food truck to provide corndogs and cheese sticks.  I thought that there would be no way these could compare to the State Fair's corndogs.  Was I WRONG!!  These were so much BETTER!!!!  Our 30+ guests agreed that the Corndog Company's corndogs were crisp and tasty.  Even the neighbors came by and later thanked us. The service was beyond terrific and the prices were (don't tell them) way to low.  5 stars plus several more.  My only regret is that they can't come back next week so I can have more.
Hire this food truck!!",66gXjNvxFn_g_v8kJQDHVw,0,0,5,rPn7qkVdp5NcrtIBzlOK4w

When we are in St George, UT we always look to see where the truck will be. Now we can check their schedule to see where it will be here in Vegas! The Corndog Company LV makes its way all around town. I have been going to the Food Truck Party near Total Wine on Centennial Center and when I noticed on social media that this truck would be there I had to stop by. They had a long line and you need to be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes after ordering because each corndog is hand-dipped to order and fried to perfection. The corndogs come in a couple sizes and range in price from $4-$6. Not every time, but sometimes the truck does have fried cheese sticks and you'll want to try these if they have them when you visit. The fried cheese sticks have the same delicious crispy batter as the regular corndogs, but are filled with either pepper jack or american cheeses. The corndogs themselves are really tasty. I always order mine with honey and suggest you do also. The honey is drizzled on after the corndog comes out of the fryer. I also add ketchup and mustard that's usually in coolers right outside the truck and you can add as much as you want. The people working the truck are very friendly. This truck is worth checking out and you can see their schedule on social media and sometimes they have daily specials posted there also.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,71,78,5,CjP8CnbNlFAu0iIVRfPudw

4107247,2018-03-24,4,MXpCVzm1V5OH05KO6n7ntA,"Finally tried them. Not bad.

The Corndog Company is a food truck originally from Utah. They appear to have migrated to / launched in the Las Vegas area two separate trucks, judging by overlapping schedules which I've seen on social media. I tried to visit them unsuccessfully a few months back when they posted up at a master plan community in Henderson but reported an imprecise location and then proceeded to close up shop early by at least an hour. This put me off so much that I waited until they were so close to my place of work that I couldn't ignore them.

That opportunity was at the grand opening of Fiiz Drinks in Henderson. They reportedly parked their truck right outside there from noon-8pm, and I caught them in the second half of that shift.

The menu was very simple: classic size corn dogs for $4, and a larger variety which I think they called ""epic"" for $6. I went for the waist-friendly option and agreed to the honey drizzle, which Christie L had mentioned as a must. The honey is a surprisingly novel concept that adds a touch of sweetness without going overboard. The sausage is probably premade, but they fried the freshly dipped batter to crispy, golden-brown perfection. Ketchup and mustard are on hand too in typical squeeze bottles, and the mustard will help more.

I liked the gimmick and the execution a lot, but couldn't find myself enchanted enough to get anywhere near the 5th star. There needs to be a little more pizzazz or variation than just adding one more ingredient to something that's inherently such a simple concept.

That said, I'll likely grab more corn dogs - pardon me, honey dogs - from The Corndog Company if they keep setting up shop at ultra-convenient spots. They're worth a try if you like corn dogs or if you're still into the food truck hunt thing.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,4,4,Al4ZzIP4X45rC7x5gbHVuA

It seems that they are a regular at this event because every time I go, they are there. It is worth noting that one corndog feeds one person or more....they are big! I really liked it with the honey drizzle...it pairs very well with the saltines. I even put some ketchup and mustard on mine...yum. 

I also appreciated that even though there was a long line, the wait was very short. They are very good at preparing and handling the food quickly. 

This is a place that if I see again at a food truck event I would stop by and get some. I prefer to have someone else to share the goodness with because of the size, but I don't mind eating it alone.",e1z9K45idYRUBn7Sps6T1w,2,2,5,PHoBTSfVJHTaczItscR8xw
