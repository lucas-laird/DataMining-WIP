Dieses Hotel gehört mit seinen 3770 Zimmer eher zu den ganz alten Hotels am Strip. Eröffnet wurde es 1968 und befasst sich mit dem Thema Zirkus. Stündlich gibt es Zirkusaufführungen, überall dudelt es Musik und es laufen verkleidete Menschen durch das Hotel. Ich frage mich, wie man dort Arbeiten kann. Bekommen die Angestellten eine Geräuschzulage? Unzumutbar!


 In diesem Hotel gibt es auch den grössten Indoor Freizeitpark der Welt. Unter einer riesigen roten Kuppel befindet sich auf engstem Raum Fahrgeschäfte, Schiessbuden, Essensstände, eine Looping Achterbahn, eine Wildwasserbahn, ein Karussel und und und...und man kann sich auch hier vorstellen, welche Geräuschkulisse sich in dieser Kugel entwickelt!

Der Preis allerdings ist der Hammer. Ich habe im Sommer 2011 dort genächtigt und im Schnitt unter 40 Dollar pro Nacht bezahlt.
Darin enthalten: Das wirklich große Zimmer mit zwei großen Betten, ein alter aber funktionstüchtiger und großer Fernseher, einige gratis-Fahrten im hoteleigenen Vergnügungspark und  und das ist leider nicht in allen Hotels in Vegas so  GRATIS WLAN! Sogar recht schnell, Skype etc. hat super geklappt.

My husband had some comped cash from playing slot machines so that was really the only reason we went since I had seen bad reviews for the place. We paid $13.99 ea. for the breakfast buffet which consisted of pan cakes, mini-waffles, sausage, eggs. I guess what you would expect but not for the price. There was no variety and it really lacked choices. 15 minutes after getting there they began to switch to the lunch foods. There were probably about 10 -15 items to choose from, of which I only was tempted to try the fried shrimp(best thing they had) and the maniccoti(sp).

160842,2016-12-30,1,lZZLmG1ANLq2Yb3KuVA4NA,"My wife, son and I went to their lunch buffet mid week December 2016. We'd been before several years ago and enjoyed it, so were expecting the same. After a long wait I paid for us, and my first surprise was over $60 for the three of us (no extras such as beer). Ok I thought, for that price the food must be very special (steaks, prime rib etc.). We went to our table, and noticed many other empty tables. Why the long wait to be seated? 

Anyway, at least the food must be good to make up for the unnecessary wait. No it wasn't. None of us could believe the appalling selection. The carvery only offered ham. Not a steak, roast beef or prime rib in sight. Apart from, it was basic breakfast food (eggs, greasy sausages, bacon), tacos, cereals, deep fried battered shrimp. The desserts were also poor.

For over $20 each I felt robbed. The worst buffet experience we've had, ever. To think we could've had a decent buffet at our hotel (Palace Station, $7 each). Instead I forked over $60 for a glorified greasy breakfast selection (at 1:30 pm!). 

You may be making money short term, but word will get around and in the long term you will lose many customers. Nobody likes to be ripped off.",ZY3b38nQSiVaC37ETVkPaw,3,1,1,bjxBHFmmPgcp7qQdSnjwzg

165815,2010-10-02,8,lZZLmG1ANLq2Yb3KuVA4NA,"This is hands down one of the worst buffets on the Strip. The only redeeming qualities of this buffet are the cheap price and the small miracle that neither of us suffered food poisoning afterwards. Oftentimes you get what you pay for, but this is still an abysmal value when the food is this bad. Both my wife and I agree that we wouldn't come back even if it was completely free. In fact, you couldn't even pay us to eat here again.

The astute reader may ask that as LV locals we should have known better. Yes, we certainly did, BUT my cousin was visiting and insisted on going here, at least in part because her 18 month old is a picky eater. She was certain that this buffet would have kid-friendly foods that her child would be willing to eat. Having read the lousy reviews about this place but not actually experienced it for ourselves, with great trepidation, we agreed to meet them there, hoping it wouldn't be quite as bad as reported. Unfortunate for us, our hopeful optimism turned to despair when the reality unfolded before our eyes and tastebuds.

For about 45 minutes, we endured the throngs of adults and screaming children waiting to get in. This many people can't be wrong, right? Oh yes, they certainly can and so very, very wrong at that. We were seated close to one of the three buffet lines, but it was all downhill from there. For a buffet that caters to families with small children, you would not believe the near Herculean effort it took to obtain a simple high chair! Finally we get in the first buffet line and are presented with a VERY limited selection of unappetizing items. Please refer to my wife's (Candace C) or others' reviews if you really need the gory details. I am having PTSD just thinking about it. Hey, maybe we'll have better luck with the other two buffet lines. Our collective jaws drop when we realize that all three lines are serving the same food! Maybe the salad and dessert lines will be half decent. No such luck. To add insult to injury, our used plates of barely eaten food continued to accumulate and remain uncleared on our table. With service like that, it's a good thing that the soft drinks were self-serve. But enough of the horror, it's time to wrap things up.

Now typically when I visit a buffet, self-restraint takes a back seat and like most customers, I like to get my money's worth. This is one of the few buffets where I actually left still hungry. That in a nutshell is the take home message. Sorry coz, I love you, but if you insist on coming here next time, you will be dining without us!",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,6,4,1,zGrMIJO6V67VdJalc3j8RA

The food choice was extremely limited despite the fact that it was nearly 7:00 p.m. What food there was had obviously been sitting out for a long time. The ""Prime Rib"" was dry and over cooked and the ""Chicken Parmigiana"" was like rubber topped with ketchup. Even the desserts were soggy from sitting in their sauces for too long. I also want to call out the ""Beverage Oasis"" section.

They had several different set ups-a fried chicken and fixings, a turkey and fixings, one kids foods-pizza type stuff, a carving station with roast beef, turkey and pork roast I think, a fish/seafood section nothing to get too excited about, and a taco area.  

We ate here the night after a rather disappointing dinner at the Garden Grill. The buffet was actually an improvement.

198384,2010-08-18,1,lZZLmG1ANLq2Yb3KuVA4NA,"I ate at this buffet twice while staying at the hotel.  They have a pay per meal option, as well as an all day option with a wristband where one can eat there as much as they want for the whole day.  The first time I went was for breakfast.  The breakfast was not bad, there was a line of scrambled eggs, ham, sausage, and traditional breakfast favorites.  There is a beverage station and diners have to get their own beverages.  The orange juice was horrible.  However, there was a good selection of fresh fruit.  

The second time I went was for lunch on a Saturday, and that was a disturbing experience.  It was the type of buffet where people are staggering around like farm animals with glazed eyes as they belly up to the trough.  It was quite crowded, with lines at most of the stations, and the food was mediocre.  There was a lot of chicken, some fried shrimp, and other traditional offerings such as barbeque and enchiladas.  However, again the salad bar was fresh and had some healthy choices.  

The scariest item was probably the hot, glutinous, neon yellow cheese at the baked potato station.

Ich habe es gebucht, weil es nicht weit vom ConventionCenter liegt. Einchecken am Fließband, auschecken ebenso. Selbst Nachts um 3 Uhr, reger Betrieb, wie man es sich bei uns nur tagsüber vorstellen würde. Man bekommt einen Hoteplan mit um sich orientieren zu können und damit man die Aufzüge nicht verwechselt.

Das Hotel ist schön älter, für Las Vegas eigentlich schon zu alt. Dennoch war es sauber und ruhig, und das war für mich ausschlaggebend. Kommt natürlich darauf an WO das Zimmer ist :-)

KRASS: Innerhalb vom Hotel befindet sich neben dem Casino ein kleiner Europapark mit Achterbahn etc. Völlig abgefahren, wers mag :-)

Ich würde sagen für Las Vegas Fans (ich bin definitiv keiner) ein günstiges Hotel nicht weit vom Strip. Beim reservieren darauf achten daß man ein ""ruhiges"" Zimmer bucht.... dann denke ich wird Vegas für die Familie ein tolles Erlebnis.

 Will man von dort auf den Strip (so wird landläufig der Las Vegas Boulevard genannt) - und wer will das in Las Vegas nicht - muss man jedes mal durch das Hotel Circus Circus ziehen, es gibt keinen anderen vernünftigen Weg.


 Was man dort zwangsläufig zu sehen bekommt fällt im Vergleich zu all den anderen Glamour-Hotels am Strip völlig ab: Ziemlich verplüscht, angestaubt, im Vergleich billig. Entsprechend wirkt auch das meiste Publikum - low budget tourists. Aber sicherlich kann man zum Übernachten hier Geld sparen gegenüber den wirklichen Topp-Strip-Adressen. Der Casino-Bereich - ja auch durch den muss man gehen, das ist überall so gewollt - ist schriller, bunter und lauter als vergleichbare andere. Wenn schon gambeln, dann empfehle ich wegen des Spaßfaktors den Besuch der Casinos in den besseren Hotels. Gewinnchancen oder besser die Verlustchancen sind überall eh gleich.


 Circus Circus liegt zusätzlich leider am Ende des Strips, also fast eine Meile vom Zentrum des Geschehens. Drum herum derzeit viele Baustellen, die ziemlich stören, aber möglicherweise besseres für die Zukunft versprechen.",j0rsg8j7TnLjO6pH2jA64w,0,0,1,O4_V6iNuMKQs0ckvQWYf5Q

When we came in the staff were nice they clean your table all the time. But the food was disappointing its like there was barely any seasoning. So you try to eat other things that you dont normally eat just to satisfy your hunger but nope. The only thing that really had a taste was the fried chicken a bit salty but atleast it has a taste the corn taste like water like literally. They didnt have much of a selection either so if you didnt like most of the food you just wasted your money.

The price was low.

We get seated and do the standard walk through to see what was available.  Wow this place looked just like a Country Buffet or Royal Fork.

Fried chicken was really salty and greasy.  Greasy meaning that it had more oil than the normal fried chicken. More than KFC.

The meat cutter at the beef station was really stingy and would only give me one, super thin slice.  I had to go back three more times to get enough to eat.

Did I say he price was low?

The other stuff was very uninspiring. The pasta dishes were mediocre at best.  Salad bar kind of sucked.

For the desserts they seemed like the pies were store bought.  The crusts on the pies were definitely not flakely, more mealy.

In regards to cleanliness, this place needs a good douche. It looks really weathered and needs to update the look to get it out of the '70s.

The Circus Circus Buffett is by far the worst I've ever been to.  I get that every buffett restaurant won't have high quality food, but you'd expect things to at least be edible.

At any buffett place, the first thing you'd try is fried chicken, because it's probably the safest thing to eat, right?  Wrong.  Circus Circus fried chicken is as dry as my grandpa's elbow, and it's as tough as biting a crocodile--not that I've done that before.  I don't even need to talk about how bland it was.

I've said it in other reviews, but I spent more time filling myself with fluids than eating actual food.  The best food this place served was waffles, and come on--that's a breakfast item.

I thought some stuff tasted really good but some tasted like it's gone bad or I just didn't like the taste.

Fried shrimp, sweet & hot salmon, shell lasagna (name?) and clams were delicious!! The beef was ok, horseradish tasted very spicy and very fresh! I thought egg roll tasted very good as well. String beans were good too, and oh yea the salad was VERY FRESH! Btw I only had cold water here (which I usually do at restaurants), and the water tasted very good. I'm a picky water drinker btw lol (I can't believe I just wrote that lol). Hubby said there was no diet coke (that's what we usually drink for soda) and they have only regular sodas.  

Mac & cheese tasted old, but hubby liked it. I didn't get any Mexican food, but hubby got some, and Mexican rice I had a bite of  tasted like it's gone bad or just didn't taste good to me. Maybe it was the butter I didn't like. Hubby enjoyed everything tho. But after he was done with everything he couldn't wait to get out of here and said he can't believe he ate such crappy food. Oh really? That's not what I heard when he was eating! 

Soft cream tasted good. I guess you're not supposed to take food to go (there was a sign on the door lol) but I took that to go anyway and hubby said ""You're not supposed to!!"" and I was like ""Who cares! It's Vegas! Don't be so serious!"" Hehe 

Hubby said that we might get sick from eating this crappy buffet, as he saw me eat a whole bunch of clams, but I felt just fine last night and still feel fine this morning. He said he felt kinda sick last night, and went to the bathroom...I think he was just doing #2 tho lol. I'm sure he was just exaggerating and the nausea was from the cigarette smell at casinos, because he was being pretty negative about pretty much everything last night saying he hates Vegas (this is my first time and second time for him).

Upon checking out their selection i was extremely dissapointed everything looked like it had been sitting out there all day, Their fried chicken was actually worst than Banquet boxed microwaveable chicken; the Enchiladas were horrible and tasted nothing like an enchilada, pineapple BBQ chicken was tough and overcooked, the egg rolls had an frozen/microwaved taste to them and the desserts pies/cakes etc. tasted stale. 

What really bothered and infuriated me about todays visit is that the food attendant on the other-side of the buffet bar is wiping/cleaning the spilled food around the corners of the pan, She must've thought no one was there or watching and i seen as the dirty dish rag she was wiping counters with fell right into the mash-potatoes along with the nasty bits she had picked up with the rag. Upon seeing this i just froze, me and her locked eyes and was speechless as she just continued to wipe away like nothing had ever happened - DISGUSTING and unacceptable. I bailed losing $86 needless to say i will NEVER again be visiting Circus Buffet, I will be requesting an refund and if i don't get it i'll be forced to contact my credit card provider.

Something else i should point out, During the few minutes i spent here i watched 2 couples and a family of 3 people come-in, look at the food and leave. For this being Vegas and being a tourism based city, to have things like these happen in full spectrum - its disappointing to say the least.

The variety of food available was horrible, and it tasted even worse!  I had some turkey and stuffing, but the turkey was paper dry and the stuffing was mush.  It seemed to be about as wet as a good bowl of porridge.  Oh, and it was about as bland as could be.

As other reviewers have mentioned, much of the other food had the consistency of cardboard and seemed as though it had just been microwaved.  Even the food in the ""kids"" section was gross, but at least they had (cardboard) pizza.  The salads seemed okay, but I cannot eat that much salad!  I guess the best part was the dessert, but even that was weak in comparison to many other buffets I've been to before.

Even if you have kids, I would strongly recommend going somewhere else.  The only reason these guys are still in business is because of the cheap prices ($15 for dinner).  People need to start taking their families elsewhere in order for the message to get through to management.  Even then I doubt it would be improved much.

My hubby's cousin was in town and really wanted to eat at Circus Circus because their 18 month old was with them. Trust me, if it was up to us, we would never venture into this place especially on a Memorial Day Weekend. We went in line and waited 1/2 hour.

Went in thinking - well how badly can they mess up hamburgers/hot dogs/french fries. Oh, you should be so lucky to have those things at the buffet!

They had a very limited selection of food items - if you could qualify what they're serving to be food. French beans cooked until brown, mashed potatoes you make from a box, ""burritos"" that taste worse than frozen ones,  poached fish that probably was sitting in the same liquid for days (yes, it started to have that bad fishy smell)... I could go on and on but I'm not. Needless to say that when I saw this, hamburgers and french fries from McDonalds sounded like ambrosia.

And get this... their buffet line is three lines of the exact same thing. How this mediocrity could be repeated 3 times over is really beyond me. 

Usually I have something good to say when it comes down to dessert. Tried their lemon meringue pie and it was awful. Texturally, the crust was soggy, the lemon curd was like really bad fake jello and the meringue tasted like plastic. Eww-eww-eww.

Honestly, I feel very lucky for my husband and I to have endured this ordeal without a bout of gastro afterwards.

There are so many places better than this - really. I never believed I would say this, but the food at Mickey D's is better than this and has better value.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,1,1,1uJxx_tANEbAopJDtqxymw

My niece had her birthday party at the adventure dome with friends. Instead of driving around after hours of fun just decided easier eat at the hotel. It was the first time been to the Circus Buffet. Trust me outside of the fact the price is cheap no reason would come back to this buffet. 

The selection not much to choose from the buffet. It is small buffet compare to the current buffets. The hot section theme like the norm with italian section of pastas (nothing wow cheese raviolis with tomato sauce, couple other basic pasta dishes), mexican section (build your own tacos, meat done you just put your favorite toppings on your way), and american fare food. They have build your own pasta station. The kids enjoy that seeing cook do little show in front of you. The selection straight forward plan choice of three sauces white, tomato, or pesto and the pasta spaghetti, penne, and one more forget. The thing is all of the sauces and pasta pre made just gets reheated for show. The craving station was the best part of the buffet for me. The turkey or steamship round of beef. The guy working the craving station had great personality and friendly. The dessert section talk about blah. It was so outdated kind of sad. Most part all of the desserts were on plates. No really glass display with wider variety of desserts. Nothing fancy just your slices of pies, cakes, cookies, and self service yogurt machine for cones. I found positive/negative is drinks they have couple fountain drink stations just need get it yourself. Rare since most places you get it from your server.

We went around 12:30 but 75% of the buffet was still breakfast/brunch items, I'm guessing because they didn't want to waste any food, meaning that everything out was al old and crusty. 
The food quality here was lower than any other buffet I have ever been to. even the salad bar was questionable, they only had one choice of lettuce, and the selection of toppings was just sad and basic. 
I thought that it would be safe to go with the fresh cut meats from the filet station but those were dry and bland like everything else. The advertised attraction: endless fried shrimp was rubbery and just tasted like chap grocery store frozen shrimp. 
as mentioned before most of the buffet and the stations were breakfast based, while only about a 20ft long section of buffet was lunch items, so it was slim pickings, and what was there was questionable at best. the one thing that was okay in flavor and quality were the chicken fingers, but I'm sure they were just cheap food supply ones.

Why would I even step foot close to this place? Long, long story, but a free room, a night of drinking and late-morning hunger pangs will lead you to the oddest of places and this happens to be one of them. 

I made my way through the line and decided to start with some scrambled eggs. I mean, how bad can someone screw these up? Pretty bad actually. They tasted of boxed eggs that had been dressed up a tad. The other breakfast fare was equally as bad as I sampled the bacon and sausage to round out my plate. Soggy, greasy and packed together as they'd most likely been cooked without separating them out into individual strips or links. 

Maybe a salad can save me? Honestly, the WORST salad I've ever had. There wasn't much to work with in the first place as far as ingredients go and maybe my choice of oil and vinegar for a dressing wasn't the most creative, but nailing a simple salad has never been a problem... here it was.

Okay, back to the junk food and back to more of the same. Bad, bad, bad! The fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy would make Ol' Colonel Sanders toss and turn in his grave. It was much more breading than meat and the potatoes also had the consistency of a boxed product. The gravy... from a can/jar. Lose, lose, lose...

It's a toss up between here and the buffet at South Point. Circus Circus might win out for the worst buffet because their employees weren't very friendly and did a terrible job of cleaning plates off tables.

First of all, let me address the food. I've been spoiled by going to the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and M Resort where the selections are endless and quality is top notch. But, here... dios mio... it's abysmal. They have four different stations: breakfast, lunch, salad, dessert.

Breakfast
- waffles: soggy
- pancakes: dry and hard
- bacon: burnt 
- cheese blintzes: ok
- sausage: you can get better quality in the frozen food section of any grocery store

Lunch
- mashed potatoes: good
- taquitos: dry, hard to swallow
- fried shrimp: decent
- pizza: reminded me of cafeteria food at my high school
- chicken fingers: limp, the breading was a little soggy
- penne pasta: average
- green beans and mixed veggies: average
- They also had burgers and fried chicken which i didn't try

Salad Bar
- pasta salad: decent

Desserts
- cookies: the best this buffet has to offer.
- brownie: dry and crumbly.
- carrot cake: dry and crumbly.
- raspberry cheesecake: mushy but decent

There just wasn't much to choose from in this buffet and the stuff they did have was poor quality. We tried most of what they had, but nothing was above average. When your best items are mashed potatoes and cookies you know you're in trouble. The service was just plain bad. We had a pile of dishes sitting on the edge of our table that wasn't picked up until we were ready to leave.

Food from the breakfast or even leftover food from yesterday. You'll find fossils of fried shrimp, fried chicken or anything fried. The demand is so high that you should consider yourself lucky for getting half boiled rice. I was surprised to see that they got seawater in the middle of the desert to make most of their soups or other items. They finally figured out how to use perfect amount of food color to look rubber to look like beef at the curving station. I wish, they'd find a way to taste that just a bit close to beef. Most amazing is the dessert section! They already know, you won't be able to taste anything after eating those msg & salt infested, bland, dry, hard, chewy & flavorless food, that's why they have the tiniest, most unappealing & unattractive selection of pies & cakes.

Und nicht nur Beleuchtung, sondern dazu ein elektrisches Summen störte unsere 1. Nacht.


 Am nächsten Tag sind wir dann in den 46. floor umgezogen. Das war ein ganz modernes Zimmer mit Flachbildschirm, Klimaanlage, tollem Bad und vor allem toller Aussicht. Wenn man bedenkt, dass die Zimmerpreise alle gleich sind, egal, wo man in diesem Hotel wohnt, dann hat sich unsere Beschwerde gelohnt.


 Das Hotel ist absolut schrill. Das Frühstücksbuffet war wirklich super. Von den Casinos und dem AdventureDome haben hier schon viele geschrieben, diese Eindrücke kann ich bestätigen.


 Als Ausgangspunkt zur Erkundung von Las Vegas kann man dieses günstige Hotel empfehlen, daher gebe 3 Sterne. Zum Spielen und Staunen geht man besser in die anderen Hotels: Venetian, Paris, Ceasars Palace etc.",BRw-WuGZefrxlnlWujkeaQ,0,0,3,aViP5Rg-FixIfRBnQEZGJQ

This buffet is not elegant like the Billagio or Wynn buffets down the street but for the price there is more than enough to please. With an omelet bar and breakfast meats, biscuits, waffles and other international foods you cannot go wrong. There were also cereals and fruits available along with coffee, fruit drinks and other beverages.

Not too sure why people complain soo much about this buffet. In Hawaii you could get a below par buffet for one at sizzler's for what we paid at the Circus Circus Buffet for two people.

The only reason why this place didn't get a 5 star was the employees that tended to our table were either yelling over us in Spanish or Filipino to other workers and they seemed a bit rude to us after we were seated. 

But all in all it was not disappointing. It was appealing and I had a good 3-4 plates. It sure beats the McDonalds next door that gives small portions for 1/3 of the price, and if you are staying in the circus circus hotel it is definitely worth it if you don't want to walk to find food in what was at the time 20degree weather.",BCIFekTy41tkj9ZigzSiug,9,3,4,RubgqNiHt2bEk_hC4q0HyQ

Well, there were a large number of choices period. If you've ever gone to a Sunday brunch buffet at Marie Callendars, where you pay over $15 per person, (about $10.50 at Circus Circus,) you won't find even half the variety or quantity of food that you can find here.

Tons of muffins, desserts, bagels, cereal, eggs, cheese omelets, sausage, bacon, stuffed pancakes, french toast, waffles, biscuits with gravy, grits, donuts, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc... You get the idea. There's tons of stuff.

I don't understand other yelper complaints - it's a buffet, so each food item isn't going to be hand-crafted to perfection with tons of ingredients. You pay the buffet price for a single item to get that kind of quality. Here, again, it's about quantity and variety.

Few choices of food, compare to how much some other hotels offer.  $20.99/adult is relatively inexpensive here, but we felt this buffet actually had a lot less than a half of the variety that other hotels offer for $40/person.  I personally did not see anything I wanted to eat, and barely ate a plate of salad and two small bowls of chicken noodle soup.

The wall in the booth was crusted with layers  of food spots and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. When we got to the food line there was a decent selection only none of it looked to have been made with any care and didn't look appetizing, but I chose to get ribs mashed potatoes, green beans and chicken noodle soup. The chicken noodle soup was the only good item. The potatoes we're not mashed potatoes they were more like lumpy, dry potatoes, the green beans were kind of tough and the ribs tasted like frostbite. Needless to say I only took one bite of each. After the couple of bites I decided to just eat the soup and take a small break maybe try something else. When done with the soup I sat there talking with my girlfriend and when I lifted my right arm from my lap I felt something. When I look down I saw a TWO 1/2 INCH ORANGE-ISH RED COCROACH on my arm. I yelled and jumped up in pure disgust. When I told the manager he said,  and I quote "" Really,? I'm sorry but I do believe you"" he than gave me a refund. At this point I'm still disgusted and feel like my skin is crawling. Looking back at it now I'm not too surprised considering the quality and cleanliness  and smell cigarette smoke (in a non smoking room) and mildew smelling air conditioning in our room. Not to mention two out of the three ice machines I tried that did not even work! As far as the cockroach goes I've learned that they feed on scrap food, fungus and smaller insects. They can grow up to 3 inches which only tells me it has been living and probably breeding  there for a while.  This review is just about the Circus Circus buffet, if you're curious on how the rest of the process went check out my review in the Circus Circus hotel section. In a nutshell let's just say CARRIE (HEAD NIGHT CLERK) at the check in desk didn't  care about making their customers feel comfortable after such a disgusting experience!

This place is 27 shades of nasty.  I knew going in that it would not be the best place ever, and my husband and I came here for the lulz.  But ohhhhh nooooo....

I don't even know where to begin. The breakfast is damn abysmal.  The pancakes are like rubber pothole covers.  The french toast is soggy and tasteless (I know there is not even a speck of damn nutmeg in the batter).  The eggs are jello-like.  The bacon is floppy and see-through.

So...how about the lunch?  The taco meat tastes like crumbled newspaper mixed with doo-doo.  I spit out the first bite, it was that bad.  The New England style clam chowder was edible with salt and pepper, however, there were hardly any clams or even potatoes to be seen.  So it was basically cream of cream soup.  The hot dogs were surprisingly okay.  They taste like the hot dogs at Costco, however, all they had for toppings were ketchup, mustard, sriracha, mayo, and A-1.  Relish would have been great, just saying. There were no raw onions, either, but that's okay with me, since raw onions are the food of the devil and taste like the root of the fart tree.

The dessert was disappointing.  Their soft-serve ice cream was all ice and no cream.  Well, not literally, but it tasted like unflavored ice milk.  I guess if it's good enough for Maude Flanders, it's good enough for the rest of us.  The cream puffs were messy and not sweet.  The eclairs had no cream in them at all.  And the cakes were dry.  At that point, I'd had enough.  

For $20, I guess I shouldn't have expected much.  But I didn't expect to leave hungry from a buffet.  This is the WORST buffet I have ever had, and I do mean the WORST.

The last time I came here was the summer of 2011, I was 13 at the time. Memories were spawned when I walked past here and I decided to eat there. The staff was rather disgruntled due to the fact it is late and I came in with my family. I even heard them quietly say ""UGH, another group?!"" well I am SO sorry that the dining area is a quarter filled and it is 8 in the night. It's Vegas, expect some people to come at night. I couldn't wait to eat the food, but as soon I sunk my teeth in the fried chicken, it was kinda chewier than i remembered it to be and the batter coating is pretty hard. I ended up getting cuts in my mouth from the chicken. It was pretty greasy too. I remember grease flowing from my fingers to my arms.  The sliced lamb was rather lean... None of the food didn't feel special enough to the point of getting seconds.

I went to get dessert instead and got some chocolate eclairs and brownie cake. It tasted rather fake. What I mean by that is that it tasted like you would find it in the freezer section in the supermarket due to its dry and crumbly texture. For the rest of the time, I filled up on sprite and went home to my room to eat cup noodle because apparently, cup noodles tasted a whole lot better. I usually don't rate bad places with one star since I'm pretty lenient with rating, but this place downgraded ever since i was 8 and clearly deserves the one star.",J1KCaKqw-1qcERELeTJEBA,2,0,1,rDouzsM4XIVWKBVTzhemJw

I love that we can get our own drinks because we have been to other Las Vegas buffets and it could be so busy at times that we are left with empty cups!

The food was delicious! We tried a little bit of everything and can't say a bad thing about the place.

There was no seafood and it wasn't as good as some of the more expensive buffets but its definitely worth the $18 bucks !!!

4826412,2017-11-27,6,lZZLmG1ANLq2Yb3KuVA4NA,"When you're a kid, all the stories of gambling, strippers and debauchery you hear about in Vegas don't have as much appeal to you as the sound of a buffet; ice cream, doughnuts, spaghetti, meatloaf, sausage and waffles all on one plate?!?!? To a kid, that sounds like an awesome breakfast!

Unfortunately, they don't do ""breakfast"" here....they only do ""brunch"".  After coming here, I've learned brunch is defined as: we're going to call breakfast something different so we can charge you $20.00 per person to eat here, $12.00 per little person, oh, and if you're child is over 3 years old, despite the fact they can only fit a fistful of food in their tummy, you're paying $12.00 too. 

Also, they automatically add a $3.00 tip to your bill, so you SHOULD know that (though Circus Circus doesn't think you should, because they won't display that anywhere, or tell you).  

Ugh......

The kids weren't impressed.  Not only was the buffet not ""circus themed"" (other than a few abstract paintings on the wall), the food wasn't good at all.  The eggs were overly runny, the spaghetti was about as good as the canned stuff (my kids are used to homemade), the menudo was all tripe....the kids didn't like anything except for their bowl of yogurt.  No joke. 

I thought everything I ate was ""OK"" at best.  Nothing incredible.  Nothing to be excited for. NOTHING to pay $20.00 for. 

The staff here are all very rude as well.  After reading an (apparently old Vegas blog post, despite being written in July of this year), I asked why my four year old was charged for entry, when I thought 4 and younger were free.  The cashier said, ""Not any more. It's over 3, so she's paying"". I don't know why she thought my daughter would pay, being that she's currently of non-working or wage earning age, but, whatever.  When I asked one of the cooks if they had mac n' cheese today (again, blog post said kids love it), the cook said, ""No"" and walked away.

Maybe if the casino left the tipping up to the individual, rather than sticking you for $3.00 upon entry, the staff would be friendlier, trying to earn tips??? Just a thought.

My fiancee and I, having never been to Las Vegas before, booked a long weekend at the Circus Circus hotel (which was a mistake).  After a long day of relaxing by the pool, we decided we'd eat at the buffet for dinner and then hit the town.  Walking into the buffet area we were greeted by a cast of very unenthusiastic employees.  After paying a cashier who could barely crack a smile, we stood in line probably a good 5 minutes waiting to be seated.  This seemed bizarre because the place was half empty.  It didn't help that the woman letting people in the buffet to be seated didn't communicate with us at all and acted as if getting us to a table was a military operation.

Once we sat down, we were let loose to get what we wanted.  Everything was self serve.  They were serving tacos, rubbery fried shrimp, really lame ""orange chicken"", some greasy pizza, and a whole host of other really mediocre stuff.  The salad bar was ok, but the ""bacon bits"" they had out were swimming in a pool of fat.  Even dessert table was a disgrace.

Dinner on a weekday is $21 and totally not worth it. Like a lot of people mentioned, all the food were once frozen and then heated up. They do have a variety - fried chicken, ribs, mashed potatoes, mac & cheese on one side, tacos and refried beans, egg rolls, shu mai, kung pao chicken adjacent to that side. It is easy to miss but they have a little window for pasta near the hall to the restroom. You can choose the sauce and type of spaghetti. There is a separate section for dessert. Dessert includes whipped cream puff, carrot cake, chocolate almond cake, etc. Next to the dessert area is salad and soup. Finally, there is a separate section for beverages. They have soda, juice, and coffee. Essentially, everything is quite basic and meh tasting. The fried chicken was cold and the shu mai tasted stale and bland.

The fried chicken was dry (after they had just put more chicken).  Pasta seemed old too... but they had just brought out a new batch.

I did have an unlimited supply of soda and coffee and my banana tasted pretty normal, but other than that I was sad to have spent the money. I had debated getting a subway sandwhich instead and wished I had stuck to that idea. I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but there are many similar priced buffets that are higher quality.

I came here hoping to recalibrate my Vegas buffet meter and I was looking for something that was a 1 or a zero.  Not to say that there still aren't elements that put them in the running for the worst buffet I have been to - including totally dried out food items, and rude staff.

Long gone are the days when you could eat here for 5 bucks and get the worst case of heartburn in your life. Anything that incorporated a meat mixture tasted like they were using offal in their food long before it became trendy.  But sadly, the price has gone up to just under $20 for dinner and so has the quality.  Now, instead of being horrendous, they have climbed the rank to reach the status of dorm food - just palatable and recognizable enough. (any place that has milk dispensers is guaranteed to be like dorm food)

To summarize my findings and some of the items

Corn dogs - dried out and grey wieners just like you find at AM/PM

Sliced beef - I needed two gulps of water to get this baby down.  Dry dry dry

Fried chicken - greasy and dried out like the Hungry-Man frozen dinners

Taco meat - amazing reproduction of the beef filling used in Taco Bell

Burritos - an exact replica of Tina's 25 cent frozen burritos

Lasagna - Can we say Stouffer's?

Mac n Cheese - Kraft Mac n Cheese is cheesier

and my favorite... there is a station that has some stuff just labeled as ""meat"" - Awesome!!!",4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q,15,8,2,e_cj6SxU4HzFAzrXbjzoOQ
