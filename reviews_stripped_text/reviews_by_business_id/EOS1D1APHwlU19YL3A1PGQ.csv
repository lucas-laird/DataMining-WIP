148795,2014-07-20,0,EOS1D1APHwlU19YL3A1PGQ,"My fianc√©e and I stopped in on a whim, enticed by the appealing exterior of the restaurant: who wouldn't love a 50's looking diner that served Hawaiian BBQ? 
As soon as we walked in, we realised that the 50's diner had gone bust a while ago, and L&L had just moved in.  A large section of seating is roped off and vacant, and the walls are covered in posters for various dishes, which makes it look cheap and gross inside.  But the staff was very friendly! We ordered a spam sushi roll-thingy, which was surprisingly delicious, and then each had Kalua pork entrees. The food was fresh, tasty, and made to order.  The only downside was that everything is served in styrofoam, and then you're handed plastic forks and knives.  It's tragic that the restaurant is a better steward of the environment!
Overall, if the restaurant was tastefully decorated (for crying out loud, get some cool Hawaiian stuff tacked up instead of these posters!), and more importantly, if the food was served in a more sustainable manner, we'd have given this place a higher rating.  Unfortunately, because of the styrofoam we won't be eating here anymore.",gDJAZ9rR8DSAlnEC_Fqgiw,0,0,3,BImmNAKp9D-Wf3CeFNAk7w

Apparently this place had been under construction and is now RE-OPEN. The restaurant is huge and roomy with the old American diner look. You have the option of sitting by the counter on stools or in the little booths with the cushion chairs! There was AC too so I felt supeeer comfy. 

The menu they have offer a lot of things that typical hawaiian bbq places do, from the BBQ combination platter, spam musubi, BBQ burger, etc. They also offer a ""Atkins"" menu for low carb eaters, and a section if you would like to switch out for brown rice instead. They have 2 sizes in which you can order, the ""mini"" or the ""regular"". The mini comes with only one scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad, the regular comes with 2 scoops of rice and 2 scoops of macaroni salad. *this is what the cashier told me so correct me if I'm wrong!*

I ordered the BBQ combination plate which has the BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, and short ribs, the bf ordered the BBQ burger and spam musubi. We decided to eat at the restaurant so we could enjoy the AC and comfy chairs.

The tables have sriracha, and aloha brand Hawaiian soy sauce, yum! Our order came and I was surprised that the food still came in a styrofoam box even though we ordered to dine in, but oh well, it will be easier to take home leftovers. My food was delicious, so much meat and my macaroni salad was good also. I think my favorite was the BBQ beef, they were yummy and thin and flavorful, reminds me of the steak or brisket you get from pho haha.

My bf enjoyed his BBQ burger but enjoyed his spam musubi way more, he enjoyed it so much he tells me to make some so he can take to work now. Great, now I need to find a musubi mold and Hawaiian soy sauce. 

Service was good, though the cashier girl could smile a bit more or be a bit more cheerful? The gentleman was nice enough to give me a free refill, so woop woop! This place is going in my bookmarks so I can definitely come back here again. :)",unDnZob7OUe3pHZSmds3QQ,2,0,4,ApOeX9GlEPdPmsiIbgt24w

The chicken katsu looked great however when I took it in my car and opened it, I found that there wasn't any rice. It was green salad. Took it back inside and told them that I didn't order green salad, I ordered the rice. They told me they ran out. Yet instead of giving me an option to get something else or to choose, the took it upon themselves to give me the salad. After the discussion, I didn't make a stink of it. I just took my food and vowed to never eat there again. I just hope they get it together, or it'll hurt the brand.",5WIJnQFfP0zbKJd4BYXVGQ,1,0,1,iHrBiI876MoOtKYHm8_XBg

This L&L was constructed from a former 70's Diner, so there's a old-school feeling upon entering the establishment. My last visit here was definitely not the best visit I have had.

I order the chicken katsu, which is my usual pick, my other being the loco moco. The wait was not too long and my party and I were served by the waitress/cashier. My chicken katsu came with no cabbage on the bottom and was quite dry and tasteless. It was as if there was more care put into the breading than the chicken itself. If it weren't for the sauce that accompanied the chicken katsu as well as the Sriracha, I do not think I would have been able to finish.

4014586,2014-01-28,4,EOS1D1APHwlU19YL3A1PGQ,"I don't know about you, but I'm a bit tired of just about ANYBODY being able to buy an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue franchise...then sending it to $h!+.  Seriously, a lot of you L&L owners are doing it WRONG.  If you're not Hawaiian or a resident from Hawaii, fine.  But dammit, some of you HAOLE (foreigner) owners are ruining the Hawaii restaurant's name!  Please, please, PLEASE learn about Hawaiian culture and Hawaiian ways!  Read a book.  Hire at least a Hawaii resident or two for good measure.  Why are just about NONE of the L&L Hawaiian Barbecues here in the mainland nothing like the ones back in Hawaii?  I'll tell you:

1) Food
2) Service

Simple but means so much.  I love how the owners of the original L&L Drive-Inn back in Honolulu came from humble beginnings to now being some of the richest people in all of Hawaii.  Hard work, perseverance, and the spirit of entrepreneurship paid off for them in spades.  For them they deserve great props.  But something just comes off as not inspiring when you branch out too much from your roots.  I wish there was more scrutiny when selecting new franchisees!  They can affect a brand name so much!  I get concerned because back in my island days of Maui I used to eat L&L quite a bit, it's like fast-food comfort for locals.  The food then was simple, uncomplicated, plentiful, affordable, and made with some form of integrity.  Most times you knew the cook, the cashier, the help staff.  Eating at L&L was one heck of a pleasure and a treat back home when I was younger.  Why?  Because livin' in Hawaii is HAHD.  Yes HAHD.  Most of us locals 'no can' eat out that often since food so expensive...restaurant dining was something you looked forward to.  

So I care a lot when places like this become a bit 'bastardized' and start to lose the love.  Where is the love?  Sorry Black Eyed Peas, it ain't here.  I hate to say it, but the recent incarnations of L&L Hawaiian Barbecue are lacking authenticity.  Lacking punch.  NO MO' LOVE!  I am happy but at the same time I am sad.  While the original owners surely get lots of kickback for each L&L franchise started, a little piece of my childhood dies inside.  It cries, then dies.  Then dies again for dramatic effect.  

We went here because this is the closest L&L by our house.  Tucked in a former diner, this L&L is just a fa√ßade of what lies inside.  A mess.

I'll start with the service.  Seems this L&L (like many of them) is owned by yet another Chinese family.  All of the employees that day were Chinese, which I mean no disrespect (I myself am 1/8 Chinese), but many of them were just not very welcoming.  Our cashier wasn't rude, but she wasn't exactly inviting either.  The cooks were hastily shouting out orders in Chinese, and food was constantly just being slopped into containers.  I suppose since it was busy all of us were being hurried along so our cashier could get orders in.  Not even a real ""Hello"" or ""Welcome to L&L"" when we entered.  Where is the local girl with the flower in her hair at the register that was always happy to see us when I was little?  Nani?  Lani?  Puanani?  No where in sight I'm afraid.  Like a candle in the wind goes my fond memories.

Even looking at the menu it's just not the same.  My nostalgia is kicking in but the prices for the food at L&L are kinda getting out of hand.  Really, like $8-$9 for a regular plate?  Even more if you like beef?  Whoa, brah!  Thought L&L was supposed to be a deal for families?  Expensive for what you get.

Next we'll go with the food.  I ended up getting my staple of a Chicken Katsu regular plate.  The wifey got the L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix with teri chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The kid got a cheeseburger and fries combo with a drink.  

Overall?  Really below average.  Thankfully the rice was Calrose and it was made decently.  The macaroni salad was CRAP, too much on the watery side and not enough flavor.  I added extra shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco to liven it up.  The entrees?  Not so great.  Chicken katsu looked golden brown on the outside but was pretty flavorless.  Would it kill you guys to season the chicken before you fry it?  The katsu sauce was thumbs down, another mixture of ketchup with who knows what.  This is why I often carry a bottle of decent katsu sauce (like Bulldog) if I know I want katsu.  Wife's BBQ Mix plate?  She didn't like it.  Too little food, and not flavored correctly.  What is up with the SUPER thin slices of beef, chicken, and short rib?  Small serving that left her hungry.  The kid's cheeseburger?  MEH, just a cheeseburger.  Not even a hand made patty like we used to have back at L&L (or just about any Mom & Pop eatery) in Hawaii.  Bun wasn't even toasted!  Fries were just plain crinkle cut.

I wasn't gonna even bother with authentic Hawaiian eats like a bowl of saimin or a Spam Musubi.

This L&L is just all kinds of depressing for me.  Mr. Kam & Mr. Flores, if you guys are still around please visit your stores and bring back the Aloha Spirit!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,7,2,2,Un13-OUuciIYZ1IpyEj67A

And I didn't even think to check it until I got home. I called them and told them what had happened, the person on the phone told me that he would give me a brand new plate when I go back since I have to drive back there. I sent my husband to pick up the plate and he came back with just the curry sauce. He informed me that the guy that told me that he was going to give me the plate went to the back and went back on his words. And in addition to that they were rude enough to speak in their language pointing at my husband. 

A Business should not make promises that they cannot keep. I did not have to send my husband back just to pick up some sauce!!!",3CXksu1uwMt-IXMoZESZew,1,0,1,SSG-7HRroxb9GEw0jYiG8w

I know they are individually ran but chicken should taste the same as all the others. Service was not great. Wasn't greeted. When she brought the food to the table she didn't say a word, didn't ask if we needed anything, nothing, silent. I would recommend any other L&L besides this one.

I had the Bento combination plate, which is BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, mahi mahi, and chicken katsu. The food was good, but I've had much better in Vegas. The portion size was generous, but again, I've had much larger portions in Vegas.

I'd come here again, but mainly because it's the closest Hawaiian restaurant to the office. It's a serviceable, convenient option when I'm craving Hawaiian for lunch. Outside of that scenario, I'm going somewhere else.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,2,0,3,gm-3eRwzVgGs1NMA6zEYxw

The restaurant lost its consumer base and closed in Las Vegas. In its place L&L Hawaiian Barbecue opened. They decided to keep the left-over booths, chairs, and d√©cor when they opened. L&L says they are a fusion of Asian and American serving a classic plate lunch style meal. 

My first thought of the restaurant was poor, because of the dirty and tacky appearance. Before I ordered I used the restroom and to my surprise it was unkept and filthy. I decided to stay and try to food there. The food was below average and on the dry side.

Sometimes I have found other locations to cook their BBQ beef too long and kinda burn it but so far not a single issue with the cooking at this location. Only thing as to why I don't give 5 stars is sometimes the portions are different. Today the regular portion had a lot of food, and well last time the portion seemed a little less.

Service was normal for any Chinese like restaurant, it's more like fast food style but you can dine in. We got good service nonetheless but in a very rushed fashion.

I enjoyed the random fruit juices they had on offer, but nothing could make up for my disappointment of the food. For a whopping 30 bucks, I got a chicken katsu and short rib meal with white rice and a small macaroni salad. My friend got the mini BBQ combo plate with chicken ribs and beef with white rice and macaroni salad, we both got a soda and gravy fries. To start the ribs were all fat. I hate that so I was grossed out and didn't eat them. The BBQ beef was okay, less fatty but still not great quality meat. The chicken katsu was okay but the chicken is white and greyish brown inside...not sure if the means it's chicken or not?? Also not enough gravy on the fries. 

My overall opinion it was alright but I'm not paying 30 bucks for two people to come eat here ever again...I'll go elsewhere, even fast food places have better quality meat then this place.",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,6,2,2,Am_EAD3CkmAWRsPE0EHU7g

They're no 808 but they do the trick. I stick with the Kalbi/Katsu plate. I've been getting their lumpia lately and it's hit or miss. The garlic shrimp was overdone the one time I got it.

I always get their chicken katsu, and I love getting it here because they put a lot of chicken! Other places don't even put as much katsu as they do. 

However, I will complain that they don't add enough of the sauce in the little plastic cups :( They're always 1/3 full, and that isn't even enough for all the katsu they give.

First time I came...tried the BBQ meat which was pretty good but the rice was super hard with not much stickiness to it.  Just seemed like it was a few days old.  Mac salad is good and they serve it in a separate container.  I tried the kim chee fried rice and was not impressed at all.  It was a lot of rice but not much else.  Kim chee had no taste and was soggy like it was old..so they used it for the fried rice.  My friend had a side of kim chee.. big difference.
