153792,2013-11-23,0,sHFGkdx1ARhPT0efU70urA,First time here. I ate lomo saltado and fried rice. Food was not that bad compared to other Peruvian places. One bad thing was the fact of the manager having to open all exit doors in order to vent out all the cooking smoke. They should have vents to that. As a Latina I understand having the soap operas on but not to the point were the neighbor could hear it.  Service was pleasant overall.,f57_H92i4Oqqz6aScOB1Wg,1,0,3,BPeDfa2RPG7E2xnfA8Jq5Q

A little on the high side of things, and (when i went) Pollo a la brasa wasn't available at all!. I went there with my family the other day and ordered ""bistec a lo pobre"", some ""Arroz chaufa"" and some inca kola.  I loved the way the steak tasted, almost as it had been marinated for days. The arroz chaufa was pretty good as well. if it hadn't been for the bill i would have returned. Both entrees were about 15$ plus the drink. so we ended up paying more than 35-40$. Again food is exellent, but if you got a light wallet you might want to try the other peruvian alternatives.",HJHTuWqLLpjsPcgJhtGInA,1,1,3,XFRM1lWnDlF10d6K3JYopQ

It's Peruvian (as am I), it's close to my house, and it's close to my mom's house, too. So why, if I'm so predisposed to loving this place, is it only three stars? Read on, friend.

First of all, this place is tucked away in the Marketon shopping center. It's near the Dotty's, in the back corner of the shopping center. The location isn't really an issue, except that parking in this shopping center is a pain. Again, it's in the Marketon shopping center, so there are tons of families and kids and stuff. I park near the burnt-down Jack in the Box because there are less cars there. Plus egress onto Decatur is easier. 

The food servings are generous, but they're also expensive. the Ceviche Don Beto, which is a regular fish ceviche plus fried seafood stuffs, was delicious and a large portion, but $18 for that dish still seemed too high. I also ordered a lomo saltado (stir fried steak plus fries and rice) for my brother, and that was $12. That price seemed to more accurately match the meal: the food was good and the portion was good, and it wasn't too expensive!

The service at this place isn't the best, and I take issue with that. See, I expect that most low-budget restaurants are going to have poor decor and such, but providing good service is free. It costs nothing to ask me how my food is, refill my drink, or to more carefully wipe down the tables. Seriously. 

Again, the prices aren't cheap. For two ceviches like mine, plus an appetizer and drinks, you're looking at like a $65 dinner for two. I would expect more for that price.

Ultimately, I can recommend this place based on the food. It's good and the portions are hearty, too. But the lack of service and high prices really bring this place down. I'll come here again, but now I know what to expect. So do you.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,16,2,3,1Nk2jibxbZ6lIS_hd7y-OA
