The 6' half was more than enough, though so damned tasty! I'm actually missing the sandwich.. 
Their French dip is also pretty reasonable, it was my first so I can't really compare it to much, hot dogs weren't too shabby either.

I ordered the large chicken salad sandwich combo with a side of macaroni salad and my friend ordered the french dip.  The chicken salad sandwich was huge, over a foot long with thick bread and stuffed with lettuce , tomato, onion and the chunky chicken salad. I thought I could eat the whole thing but given my state my eyes were bigger than my stomach and struggled to eat half. I'm not saying that is was bad, just average. The macaroni salad was bad with rock hard noodles. My friend enjoyed her french dip and ate her whole small sandwich. She got chips for her side and you can't screw that up. My total came out to around $13 but you really get a lot for your money.

They have a lot of things to choose from, but the smoked salmon on a bagel sounded the best.

The capers added a nice touch with the red onion and cream cheese. 

We also got a yogurt parfait to share and it was fine. Actually a really good deal and a nice ending to a great breakfast.

The hot dogs were dried and the clam chowder was too salty.
When I told the cashier that it was very salty and she goes ""SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? What kind of attitude is that? I was very upset with her attitude and asked for the refund and she goes "" I can't do that!"" I was like "" Then please replace it with the chicken soup."" And the other cashier gave me the dirty look and dipped the clam chowder to taste it. After she tasted the clam chowder, she knew that it was too salty to serve, she put the hot water into the pot. WHAT THE HECK?
And she gave me the chicken soup and it was $1.00 cheaper than the clam chowder. I asked for the refund of it since they both had the nasty attitude.
They refused it and told me to grab a cookie or the snack.
I had the worst clam chowder in my whole life as the service.
I will not stay at Bally's nor will go to this place ever.
My company stays at Bally's all the time for the trade shows and my coworkers spend a lot of money there. But tell them 'Bye Bye""
Can't forget their names. Worst cashiers with bad attitudes

The level of attitude is mind-boggling but I put up with it bc I have always wanted a bagel more than I cared. This last visit, however, the bagel lady made my order wrong and was argumentative with me (even though it was her mistake) and started like slopping my bagel around in an unappealing way with her (at least gloved) fingers and refused to re-make her error. It was a weird back and forth bc she obviously made an error. I pay for a $12 bagel, I tip, and keep returning even though all of you are excessively bitchy, but thank god I don't have to anymore bc I found better spots without the unnecessary attitude. Hate this place. Ultimately she did ""offer"" to remake it LOL but she like grabbed my bagel all aggressively and at that point I didn't want her to Touch my food at all.

A sandwich is rather simple, but this was notable enough for me to review - and to have twice.

Let's just say this is a good spot for drunks who are way too lazy to find a decent restaurant to dine at and even for those who are just in a hurry and need some sustenance so they don't go hangry. 

I had a Veggie Wrap here.
I had a Croissant Breakfast Sandwich here.
I also had a hot dog here one night with my Vegas roomie, Cindy C.
Oh, and I also ordered myself many, many water bottles here (Aquafina and expensive as shizz).

Let's just say the food kept me alive and more importantly, the water kept me even MORE alive.

Thank you Nosh for being our emergency go-to spot for a quick bite & hydration stop.

Especially after a day of partying, gambling, and drinking. Or if you just want a quick start in the morning so you can commence to partying for the rest of the day.

We took our sandwich back to the pool and avoided the steep service fees, plus delivery charges.

Tucked away in a far corner of Bally's...it was inexpensive and we both ate well...with leftovers...for $12 (total...not apiece)!  Can't do that at home!  Being that it was 2a.m. vegas time, we decided to split a French Dip sandwich with chips and tea...12 inches...$12!  

We had a choice of bread and for this sandwich selected the French baguette.  Delish and expertly toasted.  Plenty of beef, horseradish sauce on the side and LOTS of au jus!

Highly recommend this place!",nwKpMRqgU6djZZafWRs8Ng,1,0,4,S90TRnLjbKVjUlP8aYkpGQ

My husband ordered a hot dog and LOVED it, said it was probably the best hot dog he's ever eaten.  Not sure how a hot dog could be so impressive but ok :) 

I ordered the margarita pizza on focaccia bread - it was just ok.  Big, pretty garlicky and nothing to rave about.  I only ate the top of it, too bready/thick and the bottom didn't have anything on it.  A side came with the pizza so I selected the pasta salad.  Unfortunately that wasn't good either, my husband didn't like it at all and he normally loves pasta salad.

For the price I was definitely not impressed with this place.",BKgdO57nfbUWyrrh47VGoQ,1,2,3,7TLt7DrdP_nAe5ykaDjknA
