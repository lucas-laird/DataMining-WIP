I know this because the Nellis and Stewart location goes by the book on their ingredients.  After a very frustrating conversation with a person who speaks perfect English about wanting my burrito spicy, which it comes that way, I instantly hated the place.  The table area smelled like the bathrooms. The sides and sauce area was filthy along with the floors, tables and chairs.  When we brought our food home my kids couldn't eat the shrimp burrito because they made it so spicy it was inedible.  My boyfriend loves heat and it was too much for him.   This was done out of spite. The other food was bland and gross. We've had better at other locations.

I opened up the crunchy taco thinking that was the culprit and took another bite and still hard as rocks! The 99 cent chicken was overcooked to a crisp! I brought it up to the front to have them remake properly because it was too crunchy. 

The cashier looked at me and then called the cook over.

My lady just had one and it was jus right not even crispy! So she looked at me and rolled her eyes and preceded to make another with a fit. Over some 99 cent tacos though!?

I'm really not the person to do this...but after a point, you have to say something, and unfortunately Roberto's is gonna bear the grunt of it.  I come in, on my lunch break, because normally it's quick and easy and tastes fairly good.  There's usually one woman cashier who's really friendly and speaks English pretty well.  Today there was a new cashier, shorter girl with glasses.  Judging by her demeanor and general aloofness, she seemed very confused,  I thought there might be an issue.  Lo and behold.  I order my usual,  a #1 Wet Burrito combo deal, and asked for Potatos to be added.  This was apparently a very difficult request.  After a few minutes of looking confused, asking her co-workers in Spanish if it was ok to do that (I'm half hispanic, I understand it better then I speak it, a thing to bear in mind with customers),  she said it would cost extra.  I said of course, still want it.  I order a bean and rice burrito for my co worker per his request.  She charges me $11.75, normally its a little over $10.00, convenient how the receipt manages not to say any of the pricing.  I wait for my order, and receive it.  I ask for my soda cup that COMES WITH THE DEAL #1.  I didn't make it up.  I wasnt trying to get free stuff.  It was part of YOUR ESTABLISHMENTS DEAL.  Any other restaurant or business would have said, Oh no problem, and hand you a cup.  Customer is always right.  She says a soda doesnt come with my order, so I ask what did you press for my order then, because I ordered a #1, and it says right there it comes with it.  She says my order was different so it doesnt come with it, because of the potatos.  She turns around to converse with her co-workers again, they shrug it off, and she turns around to the next customer and just ignores me.  I sat there for 3 minutes just staring, looking around.  Had anyone else possibly witnessed this?  Am I being ridiculous?  Did I ask something crazy?  This is BLATANT RACISM, she turned right back around to speak spanish to the other customers.  I'm sorry, this country speaks predominantly English.  I wouldnt dare to go to Spain or Mexico and not bother to learn some of the language.  Unfortunately, some members of the Hispanic community think its funny to mess with the Gringo, and generally screw us over.  All of this over a stupid $10 meal.  Thank you for your continued effort to diminish my faith in humanity.  You had one job, to press a green button, and you failed.  I'm tired of seeing people get away with terrible customer service, if I were to act like that I'd be fired immediately.  All of this, because she didnt understand to simply ADD POTATOS to an order.

The only reason there is a star is because Yelp won't let anyone post a review with ZERO STARS.

I cannot even begin to tell you how horrible the service was when I walked in tonight at nearly 10:40pm. I walk into this establishment with the intent of ordering some tacos as I have yet to have any dinner today and was greeted by a woman who was preparing to take trash outside and her counterpart who was on the phone speaking in hush tones.  I give it a few minutes and wait but, obviously the story or whatever was being said over the phone was more important than actually serving customers as it went on.... And continued in fact even when the woman intervened to take my order.  And then.... Wait for it... Still on the phone...moments later as I waited while staring at this man, two other customers had walked in and the man then I suppose thought it may be a good time to end his personal phone call to actually make some food. 

I watch him construct the tacos I had ordered but I did not see him cook any meat, instead scooping some meat out of a tin container and handing me my tacos.  When I asked when he had cooked the meat the woman answered for him saying he had cooked it as I got there.  I THINK NOT. When I had arrived there and sat in my car a few moments, I could already see him on the phone. So how the hell can you tell me that he had just made the meat when he had clearly been on the phone even before I had gotten there. When I asked her to ask him to make it fresh she had translated for him (even though he knew damn well what I had said) and he flat out refused to make it.  Yes. I said REFUSED.  

Angrily I then asked to speak to the manager on duty, however, apparently no managers work Saturday Nights. I then ask for the contact information for the manager and was directed to a sign on the wall with a phone number and an email, so I took a photo of it. I then asked for their names and the woman refused to give me any information other than I should say ""it was Saturday night"" and ""they will know who was working.""  

This place is garbage. The service is garbage. I will definitely make sure that this is not the end of this complaint. I hope that he enjoys that smug arrogance he displayed tonight. I definitely enjoyed taking my business elsewhere. 

I like Roberto's, don't get me wrong. All of the other ones that I have been to I have had no issues. But this one... WASTE OF SPACE.",rQi9YMJQbXCEOeI7sauVBw,0,1,1,MS64_Q3-fEtEYbG4awmfTQ

What is really upsetting is that the intention of the cook was to fill my container with large bones and not menudo. How could I tell? Their is no ladle around that could hold such a bone. The cook clearly can see exactly what he is doing...trying to get the most dollar out of his stock pot. Since it was a to go order, their hoping their customer doesn't know any better, or its too much hassle to return back to the restaurant to complain. Not this Menudo Connoisseur. When I returned to complain and demand for an exchange, the clerk who was working the register and pick up window played the ignorant role that they can't tell what is being poured in the ladles. BS!

It's one of those hole in the walls where you feel really bad about yourself after. 1) The food reminds you how fat you are and 2) the flies in the restaurant has probably touched your food already and you know that it's a fact that flies like to touch poop too. 

I tried the chicken torta at this site and it was edible. The sandwich consisted of boiled chicken and a lot of creamy stuff sandwiched between two loaves of Mexican (?) bread. It's one of those things I probably won't recommend to my friends but I'd secretly eat it when I'm alone.

The additional 0.5 stars is for their spicy pickled carrots. Because of its crispy and crunchy nature, it seemed like a fresh batch. These pickles definitely made the chicken torta more edible.

3482040,2015-05-30,1,leXt81sCi1dyH1RF7nT3ig,My husband loves the breakfast burritos here. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there isn't any vegan menu items and when busy there isn't much of a place to wait. There needs to be a number system displayed because you can't hear the description of your order spoken.  You wait longer than you should and when you do get your order the individual working the counter mentions that he called your order several times.,fT2yry9VgSa3EY-mpSahlA,0,0,3,r8YO8Tt2LOUDOocAxUUmPg

4014499,2013-04-09,0,leXt81sCi1dyH1RF7nT3ig,"Whoa Nellie...really...a 1st to review!  Been forever since I seen one these for me!

Roberto's Taco Shop was one of the very first places I tried Mexican food when I arrived at UNLV in 1996.  Prior to that, on Maui many of us locals thought Taco Bell was as authentic as we were ever gonna get.  Boy were my taste buds surprised!  And now, many years later I still keep Roberto's Taco Shop in mind when I want some cheap, hearty Mexican eats.

I'm guessing this Roberto's is fairly new because it hasn't been reviewed yet!  And I can't really find this location on their website yet either.  It's located in the same shopping center on N. Decatur where Walmart is.  It's also very close to where the Goldilocks bakery used to reside, which is sadly now closed.  Bring back the pandesal!  Now I gotta drive my A$$ all the way over to Maryland Parkway for my Filipino pastry fix!

If you're a fan of Roberto's, you know the standard Mexican fare.  Yes, I realize many of you especially those of you who are really Mexican, think Roberto's is like the McDonald's of Mexican food.  And yes, I realize there is much better Mexican food out there.  But damn, it's so easy to find a Roberto's near me!  Almost no matter where I am in town I am able to easily find a Roberto's nearby.  When Chipotle is not an option, and Taco Bell and Del Taco constantly give me random cramping, and I still have the urge for some carne asada?  I will hit up Roberto's no doubt.

This Roberto's is particularly clean (I'm guessing because it's new) and bright in color.  Somehow the color of orange mixed with lime green always reminds me of papayas.  I guess it just works for them.  I also read somewhere that bright colors invite feelings of hunger.  Nice psychological marketing ploy for Roberto's!  The menu at this Roberto's is also no different than the other ones in town, which is welcoming for me because I am pretty familiar with their menu.  

I know I shouldn't but I usually stick with the fattiest things I can find on their menu.  Those are the things I first fell in love with when I at Roberto's back in the day.  Beware, eating this stuff on a daily basis can raise cholesterol levels, and turn you into a Fatty McFat Fat!  So please handle with some restraint.  The family and I shared:

-Carne Asada Nachos - covered in marinated steak, tons of fresh shredded cheese, sour cream, and guacamole
-Carne Asada Quesadilla - burrito sized tortilla folded, loaded with marinated steak, and more of that shredded cheese

Mind you, this was supposed to be a snack!  These two items easily filled up the four of us.  As usual, the Carne Asada Nachos were on point, tasty!  It always makes me laugh that these nachos come with a small layer of nacho chips, and loaded with meat, cheese, and toppings.  You usually have to grab a fork to eat the rest of the delicious carne asada.  Or get an extra order of chips.  The quesadilla was good as well.  Oily for sure, but damn good.  Meat - Cheese - Tortilla - Repeat.  Fat = Flavor is the notion at Roberto's, and it sticks!

I am also a fan of Roberto's rolled tacos, and their tortas.  Try their lengua in a burrito, some of the best damn tongue you've ever had!  Well, relatively speaking.  Yes, their tongue is very good indeed.

What I also love about Roberto's is their complimentary salsa bar.  Load up on red and green sauces, but don't forget helpings of fresh cut cucumbers, radishes, green onion, and pickled carrots!  All to cleanse the palette and cool down the senses.  Or grab a cup of Horchata to go with your Mexican meal.  Refreshing!

Service here is friendly, and super fast.  Prices are very nice and cheap, definitely on par with other fast food joints you go to.  Ole!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,1,4,cLM3tdyCkiMCPvMr410Ijg

It's gross and makes my food not worth paying for. I always have I ask for fresh meat or else they don't do it right.
