We waited 30-45 minutes just to get a glass of water. I then thought well maybe it was a bad day. I went there for Mother's Day and I swear I wouldn't feed a dog what we were served. First they didn't have a vegetarian option. And there excuse was ""well we have a set menu."" Second the chicken my mother ate was so grey and disgusting, it made her actually throw up. Never again would I come to this place. Their lack of customer service and their sad pathetic attempt at food is not worth the wait or money",oGdNmmv6RhuccRAmGNBm1g,0,0,1,PptL4Kz2ekc07ecj8EUZ_A

I had reservation for Mother's Day to sit outside on the patio. We went there and were prepared to pay the 38 dollars preset menu per person. When we arrived the place wast packed and it wasn't like there was a line out the door. The server said that a bigger group showed up and took our table outside even though we specifically had reservation for outside. She didn't apologize or anything. Just said they were more people and wanted to sit outside. Then she seated another couple that came after us even though she told us there was no room outside. I was so excite to try this place bit I am not coming back. They need to learn about customer service. And it's not so much that we were not seated outside rather  the fact she told us the more people was better for them as bigger bill so they would take precedence in being seated despot reservation?!,1LZi6CMsXQNJxINe54eTzg,2,0,1,z9PrO-VF0hj0nPdO0T-pZQ

1231964,2015-09-06,0,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"One of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas was happy hour at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba. $3 tapas and half-price sangria! The only bad side was that it was at the Fashion Show Mall. But despite its location, we would gladly trek down to the Strip occasionally for our Spanish-food fix, and we were sad when it closed up shop a few years back.

Now we've discovered Isabela's. The location is perfect: a quaint group of dining rooms overlooking the water at Desert Shores. The prices were reasonable, especially at happy hour ($5 wines and sangria, and a few $7 tapas). And the food was tasty, although nothing could compare to the meatballs at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba!

We each had a few glasses of sangria (delicious!) and split orders of the garlic chicken, carnitas mofongo, lobster roll sliders, and jamon sliders. As I said, the food was good but nothing really stood out, although I did enjoy the fried plantain chips our server brought out as a starter. The sangria was refreshing and not overly boozy. And our server was prompt and pleasant throughout. The menu was huge, but there were surprisingly few items listed on the happy hour menu. (We ordered the sliders off the regular menu, at $15 and $13, respectively, each.)

The best part of Isabela's is the location. This lovely setting would be great for a birthday party or wedding reception. It's also a great place to meet friends for happy hour, and we saw a few groups of young ladies doing just that.

I plan on returning to Isabela's to sample more of their dishes; maybe there's something great on the menu that we just didn't try. (Paella? Tostones? They have them both.) And I hope more people take advantage of this hidden gem at Desert Shores. You don't have to trek down to the Strip for a restaurant with a water view; for many of us, it's right in our own backyard!

A fun and tasty item from the drink menu was the Madhatter Cuban Teapot. Our server was a delight and I look forward to checking out Republic, the coffee shop side for brunch very soon.

When you walk in the right door it's SOHO pizza - huh. You have to walk thru one restaurant to get to Isabela's - in my opinion that's a no go... I would have walked out but my parents wanted to try the Tapas. Thought they would have tapas at lunch well they don't. Only one waiter for the whole restaurant... Guy did his best but I think he didn't know the whole menu. Decor was all over the place. Ordered 2 fish and chips but no malt vinegar whaaaat?

1661706,2015-06-14,1,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"Not happy with this place at all and after learning that it is not the first restaurant that Chef Beni has owned, it makes it even more disappointing.  I may have been more forgiving if this was his first.  Jason, the waiter was pleasant and took our orders.  Our meals came out before my husband's soup.  The bus boy that served the meals blamed Jason for the soup not being out yet.  The clam chowder was little more than potatoes and milk.  Very bland.  He ordered the paella which he said tasted good, but struggled to get the prawns out of the shell and had unopened clams and muscles.  Being an ocean person, I know well never to eat unopened clams and muscles.  Not good.  I ordered the lobster tail.  Again, the meat was not removed from the shell and it was a horrible time trying to extract my food.  Not fun.  Once I got it out, it was ok, but after the struggle, it was cold.  Not great, but for $29 is was ok.  I am accumstomed to fine dining and lobster is always removed from the shell for the convenience of the diner.  Jason, the waiter blamed the kitchen for the lobster being in the shell.  Does everyone here throw each other under the bus??  The roasted veggies and mashed potatoes were good. The outdoor seating was great, but the food was poor and the service not great.  With so very many fine restaurants in our town, I would leave this one out.

1673229,2015-04-30,10,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"An unexpected spot nestled in a residential area, Isabela's is Chef Beni Vasquez's seafood and tapas restaurant located right on Lake Jacqueline! Open for dinner only, HH is offered Tues-Sun 4:30-7:30, featuring half off select tapas and 20% off drinks.

PLAINTAIN CHIPS: Complimentary during HH and generously seasoned with sea salt, these are just as tasty as the ones I had in the Caribbean. 
GRILLED FISH TACOS: Three mini tacos to an order, topped with Mahi, jicama slaw and a tomatillo sauce. The half-off HH price is much more comfortable for the portion than the usual $11 rate. Not their best dish.
GARLIC POLLO: Generous portion tossed in a sherry-butter-garlic sauce, served with two slices of baguette for mopping up the extra sauce. Tasty, but not as garlicky as I was expecting given the name of the dish.
CALAMARI LATINO: Calamari rings sautéed with chorizo, peppers, and white beans. Favorite dish, again served with bread. Seafood was tender, sauce was flavorful. Wish these last two dishes were served with a spoon for the sauces.

Service from Jason and Jasmine was personable but I was charged full price instead of HH prices for my dishes- a minor oversight, but one that appears to be a pattern based on Dominique's review. Location patio is covered like a greenhouse, with a variety of comfortable seating options and of course- that great lake view!

1676049,2015-05-19,2,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"I think this place has a long way to go, but with that said I wouldn't completely write it off. The wait staff is still green and it shows. We came here on a Thursday night and due to high winds we were seated inside. All of the seats by the windows were already claimed, but I enjoyed the atmosphere nonetheless. 

We opted for a bottle of wine. They have a versatile list in variety and price. We picked Cambria red $30. The server was apologetic when we he reappeared to inform us they were out of that particular wine. He brought two similar alternatives. I asked if they were in the same price range and he responded that indeed they were. We settled on one and off he went. But he came back again, apologizing that the bottle we selected was actually $75 dollars. That's a bit more than I am willing to spend on a random evening out with my husband. We paid $75 for a bottle of wine at CUT, but did not intend on doing so here. The server was apologetic and kept repeating that he had only been there several weeks. No big deal. We were not super fussed.

My husband is kind of a snob when it comes to tapas and Spanish style food as he studied in Spain and also did an exchange student program while in high school, so he was used to authentic Spanish home cooking. I think he was much more harsh on the food than I was. I will let him voice his thoughts in his review.
We had the Spanish paella (BLAND), lamb chops, scallops, and Jamón ibérico. The server made a comment that he didn't even know how to pronounce ""Jamón ibérico "" and it was ""good to know"". I thought it was charming. None of the food truly stood out. Everything was ""fine"" but not praise worthy, and the prices were too high for the tapas portion and quality that you did get. Once again, the ultimate disappointment was the paella, and if you choose to put it on your menu while calling yourself a Spanish inspired tapas joint, you should get the paella right. 
Overall, the food although not mind blowing is decent with room for improvement. Same sentiments on the service as well. I think the location and the ambiance are on point I want them to stick around!",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,5,6,3,mFq43Uebu67j-Qp92oqkUA
1745827,2015-05-10,2,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"SOOOO DISAPPOINTED WITH SERVICE AND PORTIONS for mothers day brunch $38.00.

We had reservation for 10:00AM...got seated at 10:08AM....waited for 30 minutes until this tiny waitress came to our table and said she is new and to be patient with her.

We put in our order and drinks right away since I can sense that she will be very very slow....ALAS!  I WAS RIGHT!!!  It took her another 45 minutes, plus the clam chowder that my husband ordered came in late(r)....he had to ask for the clam chowder 5X....until another waiter brought it in the middle of our entree.

The appetizers were ""alright"", no big deal, caesar salad was so little and did not have any taste at all....i could have done a better job....it looked as it they took a few leaf and scattered them around a tiny little plate with one tiny melted parmesan cheese and the dressing sucked!!!!

The Paella is the good, but not the greatest, either.  The portion was pretty small compared to the other paella portion that my neighboring table had.  He's paella was full plate, mine was half of my plate....extremely disappointed!

When the desserts came out, i asked for a spoon or fork....waited another 15 minutes so i ended up standing and walking to the bar to ask for utensils so that we can eat our dessert.

Bloody Mary was so bad, i took a sip and left it on the table.  My husband ordered coffee and never had refills.

The waitress who served us was so incompetent and we see her wandering around like she's lost.

I would suggest not to throw a new waitress into a busy day such as Mothers Day since it gives a bad reputation to the establishment.  They need to be trained well, before throwing them out in public like that.

All in all, with a bill of $82.23, my mothers day brunch was a very big disappointment.  Money is no object.  We eat out 6X a week and try new restaurants all over Las Vegas.  We don't mind paying lots of money for good food, good ambience and good service.  

This place DID NOT cut it.   Most especially the service.  However, the chef did alright  with the Paella and the Sea Bass, but through my observation, the waitress/waiters seemed very disorganized and clueless to everything.

His new venue -- Isabela's  http://isabelasvegas.com/ -- is located about 10 miles west of The Las Vegas Strip. 

Tourists certainly are not merely going to pass by Isabela's because the location is in a residential area in the northwestern part of Las Vegas. And locals may not yet have an awareness of the Lakeside Center of the Desert Shores community between Buffalo and Rainbow where Isabela's is located. But, once you find Isabela's, you will be very happy and you will want to tell others.    

Chef Beni is one of the most talented and energetic individuals I have ever met. His intense wisdom and passion about food defines the dining experience at Isabela's.

1944944,2015-05-12,1,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"When searching for a place to enjoy Mother's Day brunch a lot of places came to mind. We frequent many different restaurants in town but we wanted to try something different. Then Isabela's came to mind. We had eaten at Marche Bacchus the week before and noticed there was a new restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Garfields. We looked it up on Yelp and the reviews  were mixed (just as many one star reviews as 5 star reviews) so we rolled the dice and decided to give it a try. We arrived at 1:15pm for our reservation and were seated within a couple of minutes. Once we sat down we looked over the menu and my wife immediately noticed that it was not the same brunch menu that was shown online. With it being Mother's Day we understood but were disappointed as well. As we sat at the table and waited to be greeted by someone we noticed the food coming out. It reminded us of our Carnival Cruise we took and did not look appealing to say the least. We sat there and sat there, and then sat there some more and not a single person came to our table. After 25 minutes of sitting at the table we decided to walk out. I work in the service industry so I'm much more understanding when it comes to this stuff. It would be one thing if the place was busy but it was not at this point. A simple ""we'll be with you in a moment"" would have gone a long way but not one person that worked there even looked at our table. We left and decided to go to Made in Tivoli. The food was great and the service was amazing as well. I don't like to write bad reviews but when I just got a email from open table saying ""Tell us what you thought of Isabela's"" I figured I would let everyone know what my experience was.

I had a specific cocktail and ingredients that I wanted and they delivered.  A+ for the scenery.  On the water!  Ducks quacking, just lovely for the desert.  But DANG, D- on the food!  So disappointed.  I thought for sure this place, in Summerlin, would be 5 star.  I like to dress up a bit (not shorts or sneaks!) when I go out but there were people in T-shirts and shorts.  I feel the place SHOULD be semi-dressy (no jackets or formal), keep the shorts down on the strip where the tourists roam.  We got the spicy sea bass and it wasn't spicy at all.  The sauce that came with the sea bass was great and did add some flavor to the dish.  Side of mashed potatoes, no flavor and cold, and came with asparagus - which was tasty.  My friend ordered the fish and chips and the fish was undercooked.  She was going to send it back just so they would ""nuke"" it for a minute but was told an entire new dish would be made?  That's a waste of time, especially when everyone has their dinner already.  I wouldn't go back for the dinner.  I would go back for cocktails and maybe try some appys?  Or perhaps, at happy hour.  But not for dinner.  This place is too big to be so empty.  If they figure out a plan to get people in  - whether it be food specials or whatever, it will be a success.

I am always on the hunt for the best crab cakes and these were amazing especially the sweet lime chili sauce on the side.  Our server was Zachary and his enthusiasm, professionalism, and joie de vivre made this a real dining experience.  Our only suggestions would be to serve the water with a choice of lemon or lime wedges and to bring the plantains when the cocktails are ordered.  Overall, a great experience and we look forward to another amazing dinner there.",5LBcJCzEzlDxjAPgIc68sw,0,0,5,8jMcXKCyTHn-87OaJQk10Q

2477768,2015-08-23,1,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I have kind of a 'history' with the owner/operator of Isabela's, Chef Beni Velazquez.  Some time before we even moved to Vegas (the first time), one of the first episodes of a show I saw on the Food Network called MYSTERY DINERS, featured a now-defunct establishment called BAR + BISTRO, located near the Arts District, where Beni was the head chef. (As it turned out on the program, the biggest problems with the place were in reference to the staffing and the management, NOT the food.) 

It was enough to persuade me to visit the place and to meet Chef Beni.  You will never find a guy more about making sure his customers receive the best experience when it comes to food and hospitality, and that first visit kept us coming back for more!

I kept up with Chef Beni's career, going from BAR + BISTRO, to his new place, ""Latin Fish"", which eventually morphed into Isabela's.  My partner and I wanted to make it a point to come to his new digs to check them out, see what he was up to, and compare the quality of the food to what we had experienced before in his previous establishments. 

If we were disappointed about ANY aspect of Isabela's, it's the sad realization of knowing that as soon as people discover the wonders of Chef Velazquez's Latin-forward cuisine, this will no longer be one of our exclusive ""best-kept secrets.""

Located at Lakeview Center in the Desert Shores neighborhood, Isabela's shares real estate with several other exclusive establishments, including Marchez Bacchus (another MYSTERY DINERS subject). The dining room overlooks the lake, which offers breathtaking views. On one of Vegas's rare 'cooler' days or evenings, dining out on the restaurant's patio area would be delightful, (some like the heat, but I'm not particularly a fan.)

The main thing to come here for, though, is the food. Chef Beni pours his passion, obsessiveness and creativity into the fare here, and it shows among the rich seafood dishes, delightful tapas and meat offerings. 

Not one of the several appetizers we started off with wasn't flavorful and enticing. The opener was the Red Crab Sweet Corn Bisque, thick and delicious with bits of sweet crab meat, garlic, spices and a 'tomato-ey' base.  The ""Little Pollo"" chicken bites, light, delicately breaded and well-seasoned made a perfect accompaniment to the ""Cuban teapot"" drinks-for-two that we had with it.  And the ""Garlic Pollo"" was one of those rich, comforting plates, served with slices of fresh baguette, that made you wish you had a gallon of it to take home.  The savory, sofrito-based sauce begged to be sopped up, which made me glad that Chef had the foresight to include that extra bread!

The signature Crab Cakes might be small and delicate, unlike the larger, breadier cousins offered in towns like Baltimore.  But each morsel, lightly coated with panko and fried just as lightly, packed in the fresh flavor of the crabmeat.  You know you're getting the crab you're looking for here - no imitation substitute, and no sad chicken-nugget like frozen crap masquerading as the real thing. 

It all made me anticipate the Main Course, which for me was the Fish and Chips. This is one of the make-or-break dishes for me with  any restaurant that offers it, and if you lose me with that, you've pretty much lost me with everything else as well.  Here, it was a home run. The fries, thin, crispy, golden-brown, were the perfect backup for the generous portions of beer-battered, fresh and flaky cod, served with spicy ketchup and mojo sauces for dipping. The jicama slaw puts regular cole slaw to shame.  I ate it all, and next time I may even ask for an extra side of it!

My partner had the Seared Argentinian Shrimp, served piping hot and whole, the shells completely intact, which prohibited me from trying them, (I don't like any food that stares back at me while I'm eating it.) His third course was the Bone-In Dry-Aged Ribeye, served with Romesco butter, mashed potatoes and veggies, cooked to perfection just the way he loves it (medium rare).  It looked good, but I couldn't be torn away from my Fish and Chips to try it. 

Plus, room HAD to be saved for the 'piece de resistance': the scrumptious desserts. So often, the desserts turn out to be a letdown, usually something not even prepared in-house.  There was no doubt in my mind that my Warm Chocolate Ganache cake, served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, was made right there, (the menu even requests that you order it thirty minutes in advance.)  Thick and gooey in the molten center where the warm ganache called 'home', this is very similar to your average ""chocolate molten lava cake"", but a more elevated version - for adults.

The Ricotta Cheesecake came with crispy, sugary little bits of candied citrus that were sprinkled over it, each tangy pop of freshness enhancing every bite of cake.  It was so damn good, in fact, THAT is what I'll be having the next time we turn up here.",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,3,1,5,L2RLH3Loimhlh6G26EyYNw

A simple kind of guy so I expected a nice evening near the water. We were a table of five people on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty slow. A young server came to serve us. I ordered a nice J. Lohr Pinot Noir bottle. The red wine came chilled (weird...). After asking the server about replacing it he offered us a different type of wine which we didn't like so we stocked to the chilled one. Oh well we are no wine snobs by all means. We ordered food. The food is good. Nothing crazy to impress but decent good with options for everyone. In the end of the evening, we asked to split the bill and 3 credit cards were wrongly charged for $54 instead of $34 each. Handling of correcting the situation was very slow and the supervisor had to be on the phone because she did not know how to fix it. From start to end it was an average night. Too bad!

3031861,2015-04-30,5,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"I knew i should of waited to visit this place, but i just couldn't do it. I love the concept and the area. The view is beautiful... It's got an old boat house in Maine kind of feel... Chef Benny is pretty notorious for creating great menus and amazing food so we came as soon as we found out it was open. 

It was happy hour when we arrived. Half off select tapas, 5$ sangria and a few discounted cocktails. Not a bad deal. They have a few vegan and veggie options on the menu so I was super excited to eat. 

Our friends ordered the pig pork
Cow sandwich and fries. They loved the ketchup. They also got the fire and ice lobster soup and a few sangria and happy hour cherry old fashioned cocktails. *They didn't give us happy hour prices on anything we ordered. * watch your checks:)

My boyfriend ordered the seared shrimp and the garlic polo. He wasn't overly impressed but said for Vegas seafood... It was good. He also ordered the ciapirianha cocktail and blood orange margarita. Both were priced a little high and not that awesome... But they were okay. They overcharged us for the ciapirianha... Well they actually charged us for two instead of one...

I ordered two glasses of cab. They were out of the $11 glass  that I ordered... So I went for the 9 dollar version. They charged me for the 11 dollar one twice. I ordered the quinoa soffritto, vegan. They brought out a house salad with quinoa on top. There was no soffritto... The tomatoes weren't roasted.. There was no plantains... No shallots... There were olives and purple onions... And regular tomatoes...it was a salad with quinoa on top... I was pretty upset... I didn't want something I could of prepared at home... I complained... Which I never do... But I had to... There was just too much wrong with it. It was taken Off our bill. 

For dessert we ordered the vegan chocolate cake with a chocolate glaze and the ice cold rice milk. Wound up sending it back... No Chocolate glaze and the server said it didn't come with rice milk. It was written In the description. 

The bill was padded up to 157 dollars without my meal. Needless to say... I was pissed. Not only did they mess up my meal and bring out half of the dessert... They messed up the bill really bad. I was brought out the wrong drinks and we had to send them back... But we were charged for them.. The garlic pollo was suppose to be half off... They charged us full price... The sangrias were 5 dollars each, they charged us full price, the wine I ordered what cheaper because they didn't have the 11 dollar one... They charged me 11 dollars for the more expensive wine they were out of. They charged us for two ciapirianha, we only ordered and received one.... They should of deducted one more happy hour drink and happy hour app... They weren't discounted. At that point I was so fed up, we paid the 130 dollar tab, tipped well... And left. I have copies of the receipts just in case I get back lash for the review... 

I will be returning soon... Giving them a chance... I was so sad about my food... It was almost insulting to be presented what I was presented as my dish. Pictures posted below... Be patient and let them work out their kinks before dining.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,14,7,1,RiIrsRrXwUh6ogd7_-mYcw

Food is decent, however their bar service is the worst I have ever seen.  EVERY time I try to get a glass of wine that they list by the glass, they are out of at least 1 if not 2 or 3 of my top choices, and the choices aren't great to begin with.  The final straw came on Tuesday night when I ordered the Freemark Abbey cab, which they amazingly had in stock.  Later ordered another one which brought out by the bartender.  Took a couple of sips and it tasted ""off"" so had our server check to make sure it was the Freemark Abbey. We were sitting in the back bar and I heard the bartender say it was Mondavi, they were out of the FA, of course, could have predicted that one!! WTF, he charged me for the most expensive wine by the glass and tried to pass off the crap as the ""good"" stuff without even saying anything.  I told the server to bring me the Arrowood instead...out, of course.  Rather than intentionally deceiving me with crap wine the bartender could have just told me, I would have been happy to get a martini...anything but crappy wine.  That guy should be fired, I absolutely cannot believe that he did that.  The server was great by the way and was completely embarrassed by the whole thing.  I predict this restaurant will be closed by the end of the summer...at least it should be.

She only cleaned 1/2, and then gave us the same paper place mats that had been previously used. The floors were dirty.  When she refilled our water glasses she took then away and then placed them with the wrong person.  Her attitude was not pleasant and she had an unsightly nose ring.

Only two negatives, while the flavors in the tempura calamari  and my paella were great, the texture left something to be desired.

This review is for Isabella's Vegas (The new Latin Fish)

- Had high expectations, based on the rave reviews I read on Yelp
- Restaurant itself was hard to find. I saw a sign on the building but couldn't figure out if the restaurant was upstairs or downstairs. Needs better signage.
- Received friendly, prompt service on a Saturday night.
- The complimentary plantain chips were delicious! Just salty and crispy enough.
- Half off select tapas during happy hour- but the prices are hidden by a green dot. It was odd. This should be changed, as you should always know prices up front, without a surprise when the bill arrives.  We ordered calamari and ""little pollo"" tapas plates. They were just ok.
- We were given a menu that had the Salmon Salad priced at $8.95 BUT we were charged $15.00 for it. The salad was delicious, and although we should have brought it up to the server's attention, we chose not to because we were in a hurry to get to our next destination. At the end of the day though, prices charged should be the advertised (menu) prices.
- $5 sangria was one of the best I've ever had. I would go back just for sangrias.
- The view is stunning.  I hope to return sometime for Sunday Brunch, as that menu looks delicious. I'll wait a few months though for Isabella's to iron out the kinks before returning.",J84vJg20-hJVTuuqJxzBmA,2,1,3,wpFlheo4uRj7oveUHhso2w

Brunch is normally served on Sunday but we came on a Saturday to try the dishes he serves at brunch.  He also brought out some dishes that are on the daily menu.

Items served:

Cornbread with sweet butter, strawberry jam, and local honey
Crab cake Benedict Mofongo
Flan French toast
Carne omelette
Garlic pollo
Latin lobster salad roll
Red crab sweet corn bisque
Latin clam chowder
Garlic shrimp Mofongo
Cubano panini

Sweet potato fries with bleu cheese
Regular French fries
Chopped chicken salad
Five cheese crab and mac
Paella Velazquez
White chocolate brioche bread pudding
Flan with cake
Churros with liquid chocolate
Crema Catalan

There's a lot going on at Isabela's.  Chef Beni has put together a rather large brunch menu.  The dishes that stood out for me were the brioche flan French toast, the garlic pollo, the red crab sweet corn bisque, the Cubano panini, the sweet potato fries with bleu cheese, the chopped chicken salad, the white chocolate brioche bread pudding, and the churros.

For the savories, the standouts were the chicken which had lots of garlic taste in the rich sauce.  The brioche flan French toast was delicious with nicely browned brioche pieces with maple syrup. The crab bisque had a rich flavor with a good amount of crab.  The panini was oozing cheese.  The chopped chicken salad was a large   brunch item in itself with thin, fried plantain in the salad for design.  The combination of bleu cheese with the sweet potato fries was superb!  I generally do not get sweet potato fries, but if they were all served this way, I'd change my ways.

For the sweets--reason enough to come here--my two standouts were the white chocolate brioche bread pudding and the churros.  Both were very good takes on two dishes generally served in a different manner.  The churros were more like doughnut holes but had a much richer flavor and the dipping/pouring over liquid chocolate was a perfect accompaniment.  The bread pudding was unlike most bread pudding in that it was soft bread pudding triangles much like pieces of waffle but of totally different texture.

The menu is almost overwhelming.  I'm not sure if I'd have known what to pick if I had come here out of the blue.  Having Chef Beni pick our menu was a good start.  Perhaps the menu needs to be tightened up some.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,4,_lpN0kmRN3-RD94W1XiBUg

We ordered two different salads. The chicken and salmon. both were very fresh and very well cooked. My friends salmon was cooked to perfection with the perfect seasonings and the perfect moistness. They get 4 stars for quality of food. The loose one star due to the fact that they kept coming to our table and trying to take our plates away as in trying to get us out. When we finally agreed to get the check the server forgot about us and kept my credit card for about 30 mins before finally remembering that he had it.

Some of the dishes were hit or miss. The service was slow and the prices did not match the dishes. We ordered the crab cakes which were good, but they were the smallest crab cakes ever. I was very disappointed with the size, they were literally one bite. We also had the latin clam chowder which lacked of clams and was very tick. For our main dishes I got the pork chops which was a pretty good size dish. The pork was stuffed with blue cheese which was a good complement. The problem is that the pork was a bit dry. We also got the fish and chips which was a complete disappointment too. Before we ordered the server told us that they were having problems with the batter, but they had fixed the issue. I wished we could have gotten the tip. The dish was mainly batter.  The fish were small pieces but tons of batter. The flavor was just ok. 
I liked the fact that they had live music Friday night which made the atmosphere a lot more fun. I just wished the food was good enough to come back.  I probably won't be coming back to this restaurant.",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,5,4,2,TVUGM-9hxha6HvNGM5famA

1. Took about 15 minutes to get our food ordered - then another another 20-25 minutes to receive our food (and it wasn't that busy ).
2. We asked if the breakfast items included toast - the answer was yes, but did not receive it until plates were cleared. The server arrived with it, just said ""oh you're done"" and left with the toast
3. Server spilled a beverage on one of our party - apologized but really made no effort to clean it and the manager never came over - we had to clean the table ourselves and get new silverware off another table
4. Restocked the paper towels in the restroom myself 
5. Love the concept of bottomless beverages - their portion control is to just not ask if you want refills and only refill once glasses have been empty for 10 minutes (same with water). 
6.  They advertise Peet's coffee so I ordered a cup - but it never came.
7.  Server dropped off bill to be signed - no comment at all, no thank you or apology for the poor service. 
8.  Quiche was flat and not worthy of being quiche - other breakfast items were mediocre at best. Hard muffins for the Benedict. 
9.  Dean was the only redeeming factor for brunch - he was pleasant and tried to take care of us - kept apologizing - and he wasn't even our server
10.  Server indicated our check would be discounted but wasn't.
11.  Bartender texted and scowled the entire time - polishing glasses without ever stepping out of the bar area to help. 

The sad part is we were scouting them out to have a group of friends later this month for a celebration. I MIGHT consider coming back in a year or too - but still would rather go to Marche Bacchus.",MH9WjTAwXbd3S89fivtoDA,5,1,1,qC8MJc-M9kYwJgYUinQfFQ

Thanks chef!,qsmtLoOaZeWi3hc8lJR1kA,1,1,5,H8CfGUTCBTjpzHpgypXoKQ

5279067,2015-08-26,5,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"Originally opened in the old Garfield's space under the name Latin Fish, but quickly rebranded as Isabela's by Chef Beni Velazquez of Downtown's Bar + Bistro fame, it has been a slow start for the beautiful restaurant set beside a man-made lake off Regatta Drive, and yet sitting down with four friends who know a thing (or ten) about dining around Sin City the results of a chef-selected tasting menu showed plenty of bold flavors and an adept hand for balance, though the run-amok menu and awkward servers remain in desperate need of some tweaks.

Selected as a meeting place in part due to location, but also to see if low marks amongst Yelpers and local 'critics' were anywhere near the truth, it was at prix-fixe with arrangements made directly through Chef Beni that the menu was set, and given plenty of room to spread out amidst a square table in large private room it was with long discussion of the city's dining scene that the twenty-plate lunch unfolded, the opening bites of warm cornbread with three spreads followed by a crabcake atop mashed plantains each highlighting flavors sweet as well as savory, a hallmark of Velazquez culinary roots and good sign of what would come next.

Having specially requested a handful of plates from Sunday brunch, a menu that might be well served to be offered on Saturday as well considering the large restaurant sat less than 10% full at noon, plate three featured Isabela's highly acclaimed flan French Toast, and with a caramelized exterior overlying a center wet with custard the results were every bit as decadent as might be expected, the follow-up omelet largely lost in the wake of such a delicious concept while the subsequent chicken was awash in butter and garlic, the sherry and herbs unfortunately muddled  in the mix.

Regaining footing quickly, though servers tilting plates saw the first of three spills as a duo of soups were served on the heels of lobster salad stuffed inside toasty golden rolls, suffice it to say that although neither the bisque nor chowder was remotely 'typical' in the least, both bowls were invariably excellent as the former came across sweet and silky while the latter upgraded the New England classic by several notches through the addition of smoky paprika and spicy pork sausage, each bite compelling another until the deceptively deep vessel was completely wiped clean.

Returning to mofongo for plate nine before presenting a pressed panini alongside three styles of fries as the halfway point of our stay, Velazquez's take on his native sandwich was on par with several of those tasted in Miami, a few more pickles potentially placing it above all but the very best, while the funky sliced sweet potatos and Jenga-style fried yucca were each locally beyond compare.

Refreshing palates with the tender chicken salad served atop chopped cabbage and jicama as plaintain chips added texture alongside creamy avocado and sliced Spanish cheese, it was to a small crock of macaroni tinged with red crab that each of us were next treated, the savories coming to a conclusion with two large skillets of paella, the notable lack of socarrat admittedly a bit of a disappointment, though the quality of the prawns and clams amidst rich wafts of saffron certainly did their best to somewhat soften the blow.

At this point verging on stuffed, the meal having stretched over two-hundred minutes as desserts were presented family style for all to share, it was with a quartet of options that the table was topped, and setting aside more service mispronunciations the question of where to invest limited stomach capacity proved quite the conundrum, the Catalan cream no doubt the lightest option though personal proclivities tilted more towards the steamy white chocolate bread pudding and delicate flan served atop a lightly toothsome base, each creamy bite slightly reminiscent of St. Louis style buttercake.

Still an evolving concept, and one with plenty of room to grow in terms of service while a scaling back of the menu's scope would allow the kitchen an opportunity to really dial-in flavors and textures both, one hopes that Isabela's will soon find its audience because with a beautiful room and a truly passionate Chef it'd be a real shame to see another failure for a restaurant attempting to challenge the Summerlin status quo.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,8,4,7U_kzK383_AZ1WoPq2DkXg
5326776,2015-09-04,0,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"So disappointing. Too bad the setting is the only thing to recommend.  To say the service was slow would be an understatement. I ordered a glass of wine off the menu and was told several minutes later that they had a new wine list, which I then ordered from. After 20 minutes and no wine I was told that they were looking for it in the cellar. Then I saw our waiter take a bottle from a wine fridge, open it, pour a glass and serve it to me. I had order a white and this wine, now 30 minutes later, was red. I suggested they might want to comp the wine, something, after the hassle, the server should have offered. We ordered the lobster sliders which had less than a teaspoon of lobster salad on mini dinner rolls and not the advertised brioche. The cubano paninni was average. The unapologetic slow service ( the restaurant was about at 1/10 of capacity) coupled with the below to average food and the above average pricing will keep me from recommending this place. Unfortunate given the beautiful setting.",nMUgKPKG46ghYEj9wfA22Q,1,0,1,UyfyJHEo-QwteEQecTEndQ
5387726,2016-01-02,1,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,Very disappointed ! We made reservations for this restaurant for New Years Eve dinner with my daughter and her friend ...they did not update their menu and when we got there the place was practically empty!! The childrens menu was no longer available and the things I saw on their menu like lobster tails and stuffed pork chops with chorizo were off the menu...we walked out very let down!!,zdoaF43ovPf67ShdWunzQA,2,0,2,36hZLx7Dqpt-ZluVK42SqQ

Went to one with tequila pairings and it was one of the most divine things I've even had and I've eaten at Daniel's in NYC.  He is next level.

5603013,2015-07-25,2,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"My friend and I went with reservations at 6:30, when we went in the music was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other, we asked to be seated as far away as possible, the accoutics are horrible there, to have a three piece band in a little room didn't make sense.  We ordered the Fish & Chips, it was so heavely battered we had to dig to find the small pieces of fish.  We asked for some malt vinegar which they don't carry and brought us wine vinegar which shouldn't have been brought to us. They said it was malt vinegar.  We talked to the Chef and he won't bring in malt vinegar even though many people ask for it with fish and chips. The sauce they serve with it we didn't like.  The cole slaw was in a tiny little cup (one bite and it was gone)  We couldn't eat the plaintains slices as they were way to salty. We asked for bread and they brought out two little pieces ( half a tsp size) we just looked at each other and laughed.  (Bread rationing?) We won't be back!",Amj4kt0ABOdmbjDxaIiSmQ,2,0,1,Dke60EWKJAPn13NnAwUFnw

Love the scallops and red crab bisque.  Need to   improve tapas but seafood is good.  Service needs to be faster.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,1,4,Liq0esbgtbmiQBIKaiByMQ
5754964,2015-05-23,0,Yv2hfGhK4-6tkwpmMCOgSw,"April 26, 2015 Isabella's served it's first Sunday Brunch.  The ambiance will invite you in, the service and food will keep you coming back. Key words on menu: organic, fresh preserves, gluten free.  Overall, the food is delicious. The staff is kind. The environment is kid-friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating. The menu items are foods I feel good about for my family.

Isabella's is CLOSED Mondays. May 22, we returned for a 5:00 PM meal on a Friday. Plantains to start instead of a filling loaf of bread. Organic Mary's chicken, baby squash, and crisp oven potatoes. Tapas including Vegan Sliders and a paella sampler. I do not think you can wrong with any item on the menu",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,2,1,5,jx40iXZd7Lw_KQZa7r5qhg

I would head for the seating area with a view of the lake and go from there! Plan to visit during sunset. 
The red sangria was a treat and really hit the spot on this 105 degree day!
The menu looks great and there are plenty of appetizers to pair with the red or white sangria!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,2,3,C5o1cGsEaO3q2HTwqPxgPg
