This weekend I orders 6 tacos de asada and 4 al pastor and also a taco California supreme de Asada! This one has a bigger tortilla, meat, cheese, crema and avocado. They have a verity of salsas and also frijoles de la olla to add to your tacos. Al next to the taco stand they have a hot dog stand! Best $3 hot dog you'll ever have! Highly recommend them. I also ordered 3 hot dogs. I have a picture of the hot dogs but not tacos.",BD6wfWTT--CGMzfOJPv1cg,1,0,5,dc8uxZfLiL1MZKj5coauEg

They take cash only which was not an issue as there is a circle K in the same shopping area, I went there bought a 40 cent jerky and asked for 20 dollars cash back. Once I got to the taco stand and explained I just wanted 1 taco ($2) the guy turned and said just one. I explained I wanted to try it and decided if I wanted more- the man behind the truck explained he didnt have change for a 20 and I would need to order more. 

In the time I had gone to circle K and back initially after realizing they were cash only there were about 5-6 people who had ordered because there was a line- so I knew he had the change but just wanted me to order more. 

I went to the taco truck down the street due to their lack of customer service. I spent 25 dollars there and they broke my 20 when I asked for 1 taco. 

Also this place looked dirty- their prices were more expensive- the place down the street charged 6 dollars for a burrito, and 2 for a taco and hot dogs were 2 dollars. vs 7 dollars here, 2 for a taco and 3.5 for a hot dog. I will not be back",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,0,0,1,HBfcogA1uSXKuLX9U6VROw

Worth every peso!!! Have been eating there for awhile and have never been disappointed. if you've never experienced truly authentic home style Mexican food then this is a must stop aboard the taste bud express",F73EFNCWSArhulVogbG0Tg,0,0,5,oWjaVkb82FEJWKTvsAC86Q

There is a hot dog stand right next to it, which we decided to try one since we are never on the side of town (live in Henderson area) the hot dog was delicious as well!! Highly recommended! It was busy when we got there but the service was good and we got our food fast ( from taco truck and hot dog stand). Will go back to both places if we are ever are on this side of town again. :)",JZkgINdB793HS48PO-M4Lg,0,0,4,4Q6oqVo9Q1YLkWREVc667Q
2843125,2017-11-09,0,GdpiEeG8oe8BnpMaENJLfg,"We came here over the weekend while in Vegas for a softball tournament.  My daughter had the asada burrito, which was delicious by the way and I had the asada quesadilla, really good but burritos was way better in my opinion.  Tripas were very good too.  The best part was the sonoran hot dog stand right next to it, delicious bacon wrapped dog with all the fixings for $3 next time I'm getting 2.  If in the area I will definitely be back, it isn't close to the strip where we usually stay but I will make the drive to eat here again.  if you're in the area I recommend it.",jlpWznm2iHPef70JDKC26g,0,0,5,MqKMIaukuB-ZlDrguUiEVA

3579788,2013-05-25,0,GdpiEeG8oe8BnpMaENJLfg,"These are the best tacos I have had here in Las Vegas!!!!  I have been going here for the past 2 years or so.  When ever we have family here from out of town we have to bring them here to eat.  My husband and I come here to eat even when it's super hot, and super cold outside.  During the summer months I enjoy my tacos with horchata water, which is a sweet rice drink, and during the winter I always order champurrado.  My husband always orders the tacos al pastor, and I always order tacos de tripa(tripe tacos), taco de lengua(tongue), and I order these with cheese.  You can see the ladies making the tortillas right in front of you( if you are tall enough lol).  They have a salsa bar with all the toppings.  If you try this place out please try their purple onions which they soak in lime juice.  Also, prepare to eat standing.  To me, the food is worth standing while you eat. They also have quesadillas, burritos, and tortas but I have never had these.",s03Hbpkhb2uklGs9y6k9DQ,2,1,5,MtoMuBXmrpF0rVSUzUve2g

I could cry lol and not to mention i am a picky eater when it comes to meat but i have never had a complaint here and I've been coming since 2014. I get a queso taco de carne asada, I add beans, salsas & lime. I also get a hot dog with everything on it. I will never eat tacos anywhere else ! :)",eR4Xqd9P4BRX09Z8m1gA7g,0,0,5,xUM1ZQub_rdn9pOJILMmaw

If you're into L.A. Style roach coaches this is one of the top one's minus the roach part!!

This food truck serves authentic Mexican tacos just like you would pick up on Florence, Broadway or Pico!! 

This food truck has been setting up shop at this location for a good 2 years now. It sits in front of a llantera for those who don't know that's Spanish for tire shop. I personally love these type of spots it always brings great memories to mind.

The tortillas here are hand made and are extremely fulfilling. The meat is good quality meat and is always seasoned just right. 

They offer a salsa bar which has an assortment of items and not just the normal salsa. You are able to pick up green and red salsa along with cilantro and onions that are already minced to sprinkle on your tacos as they come plain when you get them to go. They also offer guacamole, limes, and these onions that are soaked in lime juice they taste awesome! Now at the end of the salsa bar there's a pot that has beans in it. You are able to freely serve yourself these beans you can either ask for a small cup or you can simply put them on your taco.",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,2,1,5,2M2LWgV7jKySA9zWm0cQRA
