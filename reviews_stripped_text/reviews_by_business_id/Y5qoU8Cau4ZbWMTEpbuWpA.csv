Simba was our courteous server throughout the event.  Actually another lady was helping too but didn't catch her name.  Apologies there... But Simba gave us a quick tutorial on the equipment, explained food items before taking our order, and checked on us frequently throughout the night.  

For our friend Clarise's new job, he gifted her a watermelon paradise.  Really cool of them!  It was prepared so pretty and artisticly, the display is like a centerpiece (see pic).

I'd say we had a good 4 hours or less to eat, drink, and sing.  Pricing is per room by the hour; and not per person.  I think that's better.  Since this place also serves drinks, bar items, appetizers and food plates.  I like the idea that they offer it this way.  The establishment is also available for dining without karaoke and bar hangouts.

One thing I do question, as one of my yelpette friends pointed out, was whether the shells and rocks in the restroom sink were sanitary.  Similar thought I had while washing my hands was eeuuuw all the germs that wash down it - don't touch them - although stylish.  My friend is right... Looks like it needed to be bleached washed cuz around the edges inside of the sink looked a little filthy.

Anywhobees, new management here so the name is now a18.  Still recommending a chance for your few minutes of celebrity vocalist status behind closed doors here.  It IS really fun! Book a bunch of people.  Have some drinks to clear your throat and belt out those octaves! 4.5****",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,26,29,4,Ca-vOn-pT2AaWvihrdMmdA

The service is friendly enough. There is a buzzer in the room, so customers can get food, drinks, or technological assistance whenever they need it. Else than that, the staff are usually at the bar.

Both the Yogurt Soju and the Peach Soju are my top flavors above all. Be sure to sample those before trying the other flavors but BEWARE- For a drink so sweet and easy to shoot, be sure to keep yourself hydrated since you're more than likely going to feel it later (LOL).

The food definitely complements your palate after a couple hours of drinking, ranging from soups to rice dishes with everything in between- A pretty standard late-night Korean menu. I loved everything that I've tried so if you're eyeing that one item, order it! Chances are you'll be satisfied with your decision.

The karaoke rooms are clean and spacious while the song selections are quite up to date. The larger your group, the better.

The only thing I've eaten at Bazic is their sampler appetizer platter (fries, tots, etc) that they comped for us during one night of drinking. I think they gave it to us as an apology for not having anything we wanted (drinks wise). HAHA. 

The owners & staff is really nice here. We sat at the bar one night and had an awesome conversation with the owner. We were planning a trip to Korea and he had some really good advice for us for when we go. He also told my Korean boyfriend that his Korean sounded foreign so we will probably get ripped off. Thanks boyfriend! HAHA. 

I always tend to order some cocktail soju because it is yummier than regular soju. Also, cocktail soju can't be found in Korea. So I'm guess it's a very Americanized thing. We LOVE the yogurt soju, which is pretty much soju mixed in with yakult (those tiny yogurt drinks.) The lychee and peace soju are equally good as well. I did NOT like the watermelon soju at ALL! I've also tried their mixed drinks .. and a lot of them are really sweet so I would probably just stick with the soju. 

He also lets you sample the soju so if you don't like the flavor, you don't have to take it! But it's okay. It's alcohol. Just chug it!
