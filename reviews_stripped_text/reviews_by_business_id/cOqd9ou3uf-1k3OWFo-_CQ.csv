This was not overly saucy (and I love sauce), but full of flavor with perfect options. Love the toppings like fried garlic, jalapeños, avocado, pickled cucumbers, and tons more I cannot list with dying iPad. I. Glad I made the drive from Henderson.

As a current/long time food server in fine dining I haven't always cared for the advent of customer reviews via social platforms however, a place like Poke Heaven is much deserved for a terrific review. 

Staff/service: Family like and very accommodating with very fast service. 

Dining setting: Clean, simple... most restaurants are covered with ""bells and whistles""... too much visual stimulation to distract you from your cuisine, that is not necessary here.

Menu/Cuisine: Simplified approach for a menu/ordering presentation that is not intimidating. The flavors, while they are very authentic and approachable they are still complex and modern at the same time.

1811479,2017-07-17,5,cOqd9ou3uf-1k3OWFo-_CQ,"If you've ever gone to Aloha Kitchen in vegas, you'll know the little strip that it's located. Adjacent to Aloha kitchen is Poke Heaven, which is new to me. Being that the last I was in vegas was exactly a year ago, I don't remember this being here. Know me to remember if there's was a poke place there. I think everytime we go to vegas, we get poke somewhere. 

*Poke Burrrito- This place is a fresh spot. The protein option can get more if you were to ask me. Poke spots now have cooked shrimp, crawfish, and scallop. I think this place only had 5 or 6 options. That's ok. It really is on the flavor and freshness of the fish, which this place had. Every bite had fish and flavor, and the flavor here is good. Don't sleep on this place, I think this place might get bigger and start evolving. I hope they look over the competition and see what others are doing on instagram to spice the menu up, because they have a good base down, they just need the traffic. 

The sauce are available from a low medium high type of spicy. This is early pokinometry like style of place. If this place came before pokinometry, this place would be leading in the trend race. 

Overall, I am impressed. I love the local shop trying to get poke out there to the masses. I would recommend them putting more variety, but they have something good going for them. I hope they are there the next time I pass by. Thank you for the meal.",a6QeTGJz-hsZWltIvOQTPQ,6,6,4,044cXKWOx-xy79sUZJhLmA

2010565,2017-11-27,6,cOqd9ou3uf-1k3OWFo-_CQ,"Poke has come for the UNLV crew! This place has a slightly more traditional vibe: they hand mix your fish with sauce, have less frou-frou toppings to add on, and offer specials like garlic shrimp for those who aren't fond of raw fish. Pricing is comparable to other similar spots, with a slightly larger portion size than is typical.

My large bowl (3 proteins, $12) was a large and filling lunch. The fish was fresh, and their house spicy sauce was tasty but not spicy. I like that they include crab in the bowls without counting it as a protein. As a major plus, they have fried garlic, which is one of my favorite toppings.

Greeted upon entering and felt welcome. Definitely can see the mom/pop feel as the owners very friendly and down to earth hard working ppl. Really delicious bowls. Don't be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Deconstructed ingredients, pick your proteins, toppings and sauces. I'm not going to say I'm a poke expert but I'm a purest. I like really good fish. It wldn't be fair to Poke Heaven to list their competition but they are my new favorite. 

My bowl was spicy ahi, kimchee tako, imitation crab, white rice, cucumber, avocado, wonton strips, furikake sprinkled on top. With unagi sauce drizzle. 

Pros: veg crisp/fresh, fish fresh/ good consistency, flavorful - poke is tossed in a metal bowl made to order your specifications. Kimchee tako was tender and cut nice thin strips. 

Cons: the rice was warm in the poke bowl. Just a preference really for me to have neutral rice so as not to cook/sweat my fish in the container. Luckily I ate this so fast.. no chance of that!",ie6bdQuBibWwnypu55kysw,0,1,5,cxJYJs-vE5_R9M2p-0gwKQ

This place is located on Maryland Parkway right behind the university. It was very clean and the girls behind the counter were very nice and helpful.

Luckily, when we passed by, we saw this new restaurant, Poke Heaven!! Being from Hawaii, I was happy to see a little store pop up offering more choices in the 9th island.

First of all, the restaurant is CLEAN and the people are nice. I love that they have a glass cover that keeps all the food cool and clean when there are no customers around. There are a lot of choices, and I'll upload the pictures after I write the review. 

WHAT I GOT:
I chose two proteins (regular size) and opted for two servings of tuna over a base of sushi rice. I added green onion to my poke and chose the spicy sauce and sesame oil. I added seaweed salad on the side, along with jalapeno, ginger, edamame, fried garlic, fried wontons, furikake, sesame seeds, and masago. 

VERDICT:
As far as poke bowls go, this place is the best I've had in Vegas. Everything was fresh, and the seaweed salad was some of the best period. The portion size is huge and I like that they don't charge extra for edamame (one of my loves since childhood). The fried garlic adds a surprising twist and I will definitely do that again next time. For $9, it's a great deal and the large being only $10.50 (for three proteins) is an even better deal (if you can eat that much!). I am happy to find this place and I will gladly walk the extra distance from Soho in the Student Union. I can't wait to try the garlic shrimp, ramen, and Korean chicken. You can get your meal as a sushi burrito, too. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed!",JX664wf6R8G-VfA4NhrePA,2,0,5,mU3wtc59SUzQxWvDCc2bkw

The tuna and salmon is so fresh. Everything tastes so good. And the staff is so incredibly friendly! The lady came to my table to ask if I needed anything and was so sweet. Try this place out.

The people are so nice & helpful, I always feel so welcome here! The price is pretty good too (since I'm a college student at UNLV who struggles with finding decent price food)!

If it's your first time, they're very patient with you deciding on what's good for you! More people need to know about this place!",uVTnKPPidPnpKq6IpcchvA,0,0,5,qP95RMsz7SPM1V97kTFkOg

5291012,2017-09-13,1,cOqd9ou3uf-1k3OWFo-_CQ,Wow great place for local Hawaiian food. We had their poke bowl ($9) and Korean fried chicken (I don't remember the price but it was cheap). Really good flavor on the Korean chicken it was like I was back home in Hawaii. The portions are huge. The ahi wasn't super fresh but it's vegas and we're by unlv so I'm not expecting fresh out of the sea stuff. The sauces were great. Service was great. Try it out.,nc0Tz2DEKEcbuNnwre_igA,2,1,5,CbD5bzP4Kn-4koVTk996ug
5392750,2018-05-08,0,cOqd9ou3uf-1k3OWFo-_CQ,"This is my favorite poke bowl place in town.  This isn't pre-marinated/flavored Hawaiian poke. This is make your own, mix ingredients, sauces, etc.

They have 4 steps.  Choose your base or mix (white rice, sushi rice, brown rice, and/or greens)
Choose your mix ins, (white onion, green onion, cucumber) if you choose the imitation crab salad, it is served as a scoop on the side.
Choose your protein (salmon, tuna, taco, shrimp, tofu)
Choose your sauce (not a lot of choice here but the house sauce is very tasty and comes in mild, regular, and spicy as well as a siracha mayo, and sesame oil) 
Then choose your toppings.  Some cost extra.  Shrimp tempura (cooked to order so not greasy), salmon, seaweed salad, furikake, fried garlic, corn, edamame, etc.

I have only tried the salmon and tuna but both tasted very fresh.  I liked the shrimp tempura as it was light and not greasy.

I've also tried both the miso and tonkatsu ramen.  Both are yummy with good size portions for the price.  It isn't Fukimimi or Ramen Sora but they had good flavor.  

I wanted to love the Korean Fried Chicken Fries and while they tasted good they were VERY heavy. 

They have a Rebel Special that is a regular size bowl (two scoops of protein) and a 1/2 ramen for $12.49  They also have a stamp card for frequent purchases.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,1,0,5,AkHLA40rvwQ8PcCqgve_RQ

5578584,2018-04-08,0,cOqd9ou3uf-1k3OWFo-_CQ,"This place I give a 4.5/5! Such a cute mom and pop owned poke shop. There was such a cute little kid in the front doing cashier lol but the service here is really great, they are attentive and they work efficiently. It's clean here and the ingredients are fresh. We got a regular poke bowl (2 proteins) and a  large poke bowl (3 proteins). Total came out to be around 22$ which is usual price for poke! 

Tuna and salmon is fresh here, I always recommend that. The kimchi take (sliced octopus) was so flavorful, I recommend this if you like spicy and octopus! Their imitation crab reallyyyyyyy packs on the mayo though which for me is was a lil heavy but it was still yummy. I got half salad and half brown rice and I don't recommend their brown rice. It was kind of hard and really chewy like it wasn't fresh so I recommend their white or sushi rice. They really pack it with the rice so it's pretty filling! 

Their sauces are good, we got the chipotle aioli and house special spicy. I recommend Adding some sesame oil and your bowl will be soooo flavorful. 

Overall this is a great quality poke shop. Fish is fresh and the sides add so much flavor. Avocado and seaweed salad are both a 1$ extra each. They have a special going on for a regular poke bowl and half tonkatsu or miso ramen for 12.95$! Such a steal. Next time I'm going to get the Korean chicken fries! They were only 8$ and they give a really generous amount. This is the place to go if you want some fresh poke and some yummy fries! They also have rice bowls and ramen if you're not into poke! I always love supporting small businesses like these, they environment is always so homey and welcoming. I will be back for sure.",6S0q9lA6UU7suTf0alhlog,2,0,4,l31xUgoVZ1KTlrhtJ7D-sg
