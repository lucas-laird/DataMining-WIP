561626,2016-07-07,0,1u7fJVL82JEznv76noobVQ,I guess I'm not the only person to have money stollen in the drive thru at this McDonald's. I tried to do a split payment of cash and card for a transaction. I gave the attendant mostly cash and just needed some change taken off my card. He took the money off the card and pocketed the cash. He was acting strange so I checked my receipt to see what he did. I then checked my account to be sure. Just be aware!,L3Iecga01UnFXnDhta-o4g,2,0,1,vBb6nhf2v18DbdbjOqBA3w

And didn't tell me anything until I looked at my account and went back, they said my money will be returned to my account within hours. Now 3 days later my money is still not in my account. Also. I've been to other McDonald's with long drive thru lines but they are moving at an okay pace. This McDonald's drive thru lines are the slowest I've been in.",_oxgoLO0NeQeOK1eGftPFQ,0,0,1,w-B6HE46eT1ar_gaUFWACw

Service was fast, professional, but.......that's it.  So, I'll support those that support me, and drive a few miles to the McD's that does offer ""a break today!""",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,0,0,2,40t0J_uozcpSrdGlxP0ZvA

 At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here. This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for  a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin.
  On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied.
  Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,0,0,3,JNPfpELsEEppSQyyGWjmrg
