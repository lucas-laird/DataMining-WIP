I came here on a recommendation from a buddy that grew up in Brooklyn and said this place got it right. Well, my boy was correct, this place is damn tasty! They sell Boylans soda which had me from the start. Their pizza by the slice was pretty awesome and they had several options including a lasagna pizza. I had a slice of combo, a cucumber and tomato salad and a Boylans Black Cherry. It hit the spot! Meet some friends for lunch, hung out comfortably for about an hour, then partook of the complementary baked goods that they had before we left. I think they're called zeppoli, but don't quote me or my spelling. They had authentic Italian goods to purchase and it was all reasonably priced. Great staff, very attentive and courteous, proud of their product and it's quality, which speaks volumes.  Like I said before, NY style isn't my favorite, but I'll definitely be back here to get some more. Happy eating!!",-gQZ1BfxbXEN8XuoYBJd2g,0,0,5,xt7PhQcXDHmb-A2jHeraEQ

I called to order one large pepperoni pizza and was quoted a time of 45 minutes. I thought it was a little long for one pizza but whatever, I've had it before and it's good pizza.

An hour later I call back and she said that delivery driver had to come back and pick up my pizza and then go out again. I asked how long that would take because i don't want my food sitting under heat lamps for a long time. I heard the lady on the phone whispering to someone else and she told this girl that she told me 45 to an hour. If I was going to have wait that long I would have called someplace else.  She said it would take an extra 15-25 minutes for it to arrive. So now my original quote time has doubled and the lady on the phone just seemed inconvenienced. 

When my pizza finally arrived, about an hour and a half later, it was cold and cost me $20 bucks. I don't think I'll be coming back again after this shitty experience.",iQGbN4C2K9O4fvTfnNWLuQ,3,0,2,tBguITGR8Y2T1AEUu_SvYw

Everything was as good as it gets. Every Vegas Pizzaria can finally learn what a Stromboli is now!

I hope every neighborhood fortunate enough to have a Rocco's shows up to support this place because it would be a true shame if it fell off due to lack of business. You won't find a better pie west of the Mississippi, let alone Clark County. The Cheese Calzone is another item that displays what a true Cheese Calzone is and how it should taste. This place is not ""Good as far as Vegas Pizzaria's go"" this place holds it's own with anyone anywhere. All these fake Napoli, award winning casino pizza nonsense is put to shame because this IS the best in town and for the same prices as every other local pizza joint.

Pizza is generally loved by everyone and shared easily.  We asked for suggestions and Rocco's was immediately mentioned.  It was a new place for me so I was 100% on board.  

NY style translated means huge slices you fold in half.  Rumor is they fly in their water from NY to make their dough.  I'm not sure if it makes a huge difference but their crust is definitely flavorful, crisp and perfect.  The toppings are abundant and fresh.  I love the white pizza ricotta.  I immediately found a favorite.  

Of course I have to mention the garlic knots. Buttery, tasty and more dense than other knots I've tried. Their pizza sauce is unique and nicely compliments the bread as well as any pizza.  

My only gripe would be service.  I don't expect pizza places to be held to a specific time.

First, let me say that I know that this place is not your super high end pizza joint, you can quite possibly find better pizza elsewhere; however for the price and quality of the food I don't think there are many better options.  The pizza slice deals are really good.  They also have several daily specials on different pastas and other items throughout the week.  I have tried 5-6 different pasta dishes, ALL of which were fantastic.  I've tried some of the deserts which I enjoyed tremendously as well.  With every desert and pasta dish that I have ordered, the portions were very large and well worth the price.  Hands down the #1 reason I would recommend this place, and the main reason I keep returning is the customer service.  So many places you go nowadays, nobody talks to you, nobody really cares; however I feel welcomed here by many members of the staff.  The young ladies who often take my order at the counter know me by name, and are very friendly.  The guy who I think is the owner/manager is awesome, always asks me how I am doing and strikes up a quick conversation.  It's not necessary that they do this, but brings a level of customer service to this place that I don't see in others.  Just recently he asked me how my new years went, and talked to me about how he relaxed with his family and whatnot.  It's friendly here which makes me feel like a valued customer.  One last thing...They usually have samples of their deserts called Zeppoles out on the counter; try them, they are delicious.

Veal Parm-I think it was veal? Reminded me of the processed meat we would get in school when we were kids. Definitely not one piece in the veal cutlet,won't order it again.
 
Eggplant Stromboli-HORRIBLE! Two bites and in the trash. Rubbery & tasteless eggplant which was way over powered by the peppers & the smoked mozzarella was not good either. The sauce that came with the Stromboli was like tomato water,not the same sauce as the pizza.

How they get the pizza right and the others so wrong is beyond me. I'll still enjoy the pizza but will stay away from the rest of the menu which is kinda depressing because I had high hopes for this place after trying the pizza the first time.",6FoyjMD7A7ln2iSw6uQ84g,0,0,2,ugJo9oyl1MZVd-mGx2WKZQ

Maybe it is, except the woman, Raina, behind the counter is the rudest worker I have ever encountered. I've never been in an establishment that doesn't tell you where to order or who asks if you want to add a topping to a calzone. Vegas, a calzone is a cheese filled pastry. We don't add toppings to it. We dip it in sauce. We don't push people out of the way while they wait for their order. Get a clue. No matter how good or bad this product is I would never return due to this woman.  

Edit:
My calzone and white slice were put in two separate brown paper bags making them impossible to carry along with two sodas. They also tasted like warm cheesey cardboard. No.",cuibvcjSjFjdx-fBF19H1w,3,1,1,DoBkQMBVZ-D9lsz6PDH-Zg

I used to work in a pizzeria in NY when I was in college so I can appreciate a solid cheese pie and these guys cut it close...  Better than most in vegas.  The white slice is definitely next on my list.

Zeppoles were great and they definitely didn't hold back on the portions or powdered sugar. 

Wife got the spaghetti and meatballs...  Sauce was clearly homemade :)

Love love the Italian cookies, pizzelles and black & white cookies...  Don't see these too often

Service is consistently good. Only reason I didn't give them a 5 star is their calzones are little off. Such a staple in any pizzeria.  It's slightly prepared different from what I'm used to (almost too much dough and folded different) and when I asked for sausage they added such a sparingly amount.

2509091,2018-04-04,0,me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ,"Big fan of Rocco's whether it's for Pizza, Pasta, or a little Spumoni. 

I'm not an Italian food aficionado. I dig a Mama Celeste frozen pizza almost as much as a bowl of Fettuccine Alfredo from the dearly missed Don Antonio's. So, don't quote me on authenticity, I like what tastes good, and sometimes it's flash frozen mozzarella cheese.

I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten at Rocco's. I'd say that hands down, my favorite item on the menu is the Vodka pasta with rigatoni. Mama mia it's so freaking good. The sauce is creamy, but not too thick. You get a massively generous portion size - probably enough for 2 hungry people to split. They always give you a really good hunk of italian bread, which is critical for dipping purposes. 

They also offer pizza by the slice all the time. Pretty rare outside of a food court Sbarro at the mall (do they even have those anymore?). Pizza is thin, toppings are typically generous. Really good pizza.

If you have a little bit of a sweet tooth they have a slew of gelato options, including one of my fav's Spumoni. Not the easiest flavor to find, and it's only good once in a blue moon, but I really liked it when I had it here. I'm not sure if this is something Rocco's does themselves or if they use another company. Nonetheless, it was good. They also had several traditional flavors. 

Rocco's is pretty close to my house, and when I'm in the mood for a pasta dish it's always the first place I think of. I always call in my order and it's ready when I get there, so I'm in and out inside 2 minutes.

This chicken looked like chicken tenders that got fried then dumped into my dish with no taste either ! They definitely either have to fix this recipe or get some pointers from the summerlin location! The only plus is that the portion is big but it doesn't help when the food doesn't taste good.

Italian restaurant chains in Las Vegas - who insult my heritage with the food they serve, routinely embarrass themselves when they attempt an eggplant dish. This is not the case with Rocco's and I am very happy to announce that if you are of Italian heritage and come from the New York/North Jersey area - you will want to eat here. 

The Rocco's staff challenged me by claiming their cannoli was the best. My reaction was: the best cannoli I have eaten is found in Little Italy - Bronx, NY at Gino's. They make the shells using the traditional method of wood pins - and their filling is the best.  It's been 14 years since I have been to Gino's and I will say this to Rocco's - you guys did a really great job and I will be back.

My family did try several other dishes - the fettuccine, the penne vodka, and a meatball sandwich and everyone was very, very happy. Rocco's came recommended to me from two different people. I ordered for pickup and next time I will dine in.  The place has an east coast pizza place feel that I grew up and worked in as a young guy - except they did it right and have a nice big space for the dining room. 

The last thing I need to mention is the tomato sauce, because as an Italian/American it would be a mistake not to talk about it.  Every Italian has their preference and it is usually their grandmother's. I like my sauce very salty and thin. However, Rocco's was really good, not too sweet - which drives me crazy and my family enjoyed it very much.

A little pricey considering the decor of the place. They didn't have enough tables and chairs. There were no spoons which made eating the pasta and sharing the pasta really difficult. The parking outside is a bit limited because the shopping center is so busy. I came with my family and we ordered several dishes to share. The calmari was great. The garlic knots had WAY too much oil. I might have enjoyed the pasta dishes we had a bit more if there were a way to eat the dishes better. Initially, they gave us really thin paper plates which soaked all the way through with our pasta sauce. Did I mention, they don't have any spoons? This place was super busy due to take out.

I miss NY after living there for a while (in Queens). Everytime I went into the city, I got a slice of pizza. After eating here, my memories of NY pizza came running back to me.

Hands down best NY pizza I've eaten outside of NY so far. I loved the lasagna pizza they just came out with. Had sausage, cottage cheese and red peppers on it. The red peppers was new on the pizza and it makes such a difference. It is sooo good. I think the proportion of cheese, sauce and toppings is what made the pizza taste excellent. I also got a combo pizza, but wasn't as good as the lasagna pizza.

Not only did I wait soooooo long, but the pizza was colder than Marylyn Manson's soul. Wrong toppings, wrong dinner choice. Delivery guy was cool. I tipped him well, but the fact that I had to throw the pie in the oven really blows. I love supporting small businesses but when they are ran poorly, it makes me say F it and just go the corporate way and order Pizza Hut. 

To top it off after I heat my pizza via 400° oven, 20 minutes later, I get to the cheesecake. Much to my dismay, it's frozen solid. Almost 2 hours after placing my order, I force a metal fork into a frozen piece of cheesecake. I really love cheesecake. 

I'd like to make readers aware that I am not an avid 'yelper' and truly am not writing a horrible review just because... this place actually deserves it. I called to talk to a manager, and was answered by a woman, who responded to my situation without apologizing. She blatantly told me  that all the cheesecake is delivered frozen to all customers. 

I work in a restaurant and understand that some foods need to be frozen, so they don't turn. But come on now. Thaw it a little.  All I'm saying is if you want success as a small business owner, then run it right. Also, packaged ranch for wings???? GTFOH.

3rd - Noticed the cooks apron covered in hands prints of flour. He is supposed to be washing his hands in stead of wiping it on his apron.

4th - Watched a fly land on the pizza that is out in the open (with no covering or heat lamps) and told the cashier about it. She grabs the pizza looking for the critter as it zip's toward her face causing her to jump back.

They have a stacked menu full of pizzas, pastas, sandwiches & desserts which is nice. I had a craving for deep fried ravioli, it was good but i felt it couldve been better with a thicker sauce. I also tried a slice of the pizza (sausage & ricotta), it tasted like a day old pizza from the fridge that was warmed up by an oven. I can only suspect that it may taste better if i ordered a whole pie but the variance of quality is too big.

What I got was a soggy pizza, excuses, and attitude.  First the girl said it was because of the rush, they were busy, and the cook had so many tickets.  I wasn't rushing them.  If I want fast, I'll go elsewhere. Then I was told the pizza was crispy, like I ordered, even though it was limp like Hugh Hefner without his Viagra.  Then I'm told in the future, I should order it well done, but ask them to cook it longer when it doesn't arrive as ordered.  I said extra crispy, she said the ticket said crispy,   Then she returned to tell me my pizza was crispy, although it looked exactly like the pizza at the next table.  Not crispy. Either someone here doesn't understand English, or how to listen effectively.  Anyone can make a mistake, but just admit it was wrong, and apologize.  My friend finally had to tell the girl who delivered the pizza to just go away.  They didn't get the order right, yet she tells me I'm wrong?  No thank you.

I've been patronizing Rocco's for years at the West Charleston location.  This store is obviously too big for their britches, makes too much money, and doesn't care about doing the right thing by their customers. 

Sorry neighbors.  You've lost my trust, and my business.  I'll go to Blaze where the understand what the words ""extra crispy.""  Rocco's can keep their doughy pizza, bad attitude, and bad service.",c8kNzhsoB2_YEn4gMWNyFw,0,0,2,IEvsyYtj9yPzP7m0h1jOYQ

The second I opened the door, my nose recognized that so familiar scent and when I got to the counter and saw the color, I instantly knew my search was over.

The color was exactly as I remembered, a very light red with the melted cheese surfacing lightly like spots on a Dalmatian so to speak. The sauce, not over bearing with the correct sweetness and finally the crust, the perfect texture and crispness on the rim. For the crust, it must be New York City water. Who knows there may still be miles of aqua ducts built from oak planks which makes the crust so unique. Everything about this place shouts Manhattan!

They've been consistent all of the years, I used to go to the original location on Buffalo (I believe that was the first one) their pasta dishes are quick to go meals and a generous portion. Also their pizza is pretty good as well, I normally opt for pasta. Sandwiches are good, especially the grilled one on garlic bread I think it's the Manhattan. Their baked ziti is a close second to my moms. But, after our recent takeout order it left me second guessing my favorite to go Italian restaurant. I ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and there was no lettuce or tomato and only half of the sandwich had mayo. The chicken was extremely dry and seemed like it had probably been sitting for hours or from the previous day and was microwaved, though the chicken was like warm, totally bummed me out. A sandwich with dry breaded chicken and half mayo, come on now.. that's not a sandwich you want to eat. I barely ate any. My fiancé got a chicken parm sandwich which is normally quite good, and again the chicken was dry and chewy. Very disappointing trip to Rocco's and will have me second guessing a return next time. Though let me state this is the only bad experience I've had at this location but it was very disappointing, a waste of a 20 dollar bill. If you try this place out, try the pastas it's always been great. I may update my review in the future but 3 stars for now, because I can't believe they messed up a simple sandwich.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,0,0,3,swclhtalK5SXHPVTPI2Qug

I happened to be in the area waiting on my dance class, and did a quick stop by for dinner. I was soooo skeptical of pizza here and had one slice, which BLEW ME AWAY. I went back and got another slice. Yeah, it was THAT good.

The crust is delicious! I give this place a solid 9.5/10 for pizza ranking. The dough is good. Awesome service, too!

We've been here a few times and have tried multiple items on the menu:  Zeppoles are great.  Wings are ok.  I didn't really care too much for my Calzone - I thought the ricotta was under-seasoned and their was too much extra bread on the ends, but I'm pretty particular about my calzones.  The garlic knots are good but a little too large and bready for my taste.

They also have 2 options for subs, 7"" and 15"".  I ordered a 15"" steak sandwich and when I picked it up, I saw it was in 2 separate packages.  Ok, I thought they'd cut it in half and that was just how they packaged it.  To my surprise, they had actually just made 2 separate 7"" subs.  I don't know if they were out of the 15"" sub bread or what, but I thought that was a little ridiculous.  The sub itself was ok.

Once in a while when I've called to place an order a younger male answers the phone and he's always pretty rude - just has no manners at all and can't wait to get you off the phone.  I'm used to pizza guys being short and rushed on the phone because they're busy or doing other things, but this kid for some reason always manages to be rude (ESPECIALLY when they're not busy).",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,4,y2gQsYnI5u2zdJWmrdPdvA

But.... The taste was never the problem.. And still isn't the problem

It was the service..... I paid for the 5 for two slices and drink deal the first time and my son loved it so much that I had to get another two slices(which he didn't finish dammit) and when I asked for the second drink he pointed at the cup I already had and said that I already had one.  

Then I asked for marinara sauce for the pizza and he said it was 85 cents... Which is fine but I just got four slices of pizza.  Throw a bitch a bone.  Damn.  

And then when it came time to leave I asked for a box and he gave me a bag and a plate. 

Unfortunately.  I still want pizza.... So I'll end up going back but not as much as I used to.",UnZeu9L1oHKbp-pmDbNkqg,0,0,3,kw81DPT1r-QqcOCk11zxZg
