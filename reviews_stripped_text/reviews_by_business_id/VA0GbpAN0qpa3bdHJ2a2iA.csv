289125,2012-05-07,3,VA0GbpAN0qpa3bdHJ2a2iA,"In futile attempt to support a spirit of Cinco de Mayo me and my dear kitteh eneded up at the friendly corner of Bonanza and Eastern.  I've been to this fine establishment a couple years ago and I didn't recall having any unforeseen consequences so I thought that it shouldn't be bad this time either. 

I'm not going to talk much about food which is a solid OK for a mexican (or in this case mexican-salvadorean) restaurant except the fact that shrimp in my fajitas was a little overcooked... What I'm going to talk is about the ""dining experience"" itself. 

Sometime between our sitting down and first appearance of the waitress we got to witness enterprising individual dressed in saggy pants (and colorfully displayed underwear) peddling fake perfumes. He avoided our table probably thinking that we are not likely to be his customers... however, next businessmen was not as intimidated and proudly offered to purchase screen copy of Avengers for mere $3. I had to politely decline because we already planned to part with $30 same night for 3D IMAX Dolby Surround bone rattling experience at the movie theater. 

So I thought... wrapping my shrimp fajitas in a hand-made tortilla, how good does it get? Can I possibly get a hair cut with my meal here? And right at this moment another vendor showed up in front of my face offering (I assume hand-made too) rosaries and bracelets. Great! It was already like a flea market that comes to you.

What I really needed was a wireless router so I really started thinking that I can save a trip to Fry's and just get it while snacking on chips and salsa but no luck... all we got on a way out is another smiling individual with half a head of cheese ""Queso, queso?"". Uhmm... I'll think about it next time.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,2,1,3,vTbKdkgn1G8ltplyP7SUxw

She did say sorry and quickly took the plate and never returned.  Not even to offer  a discount. 
Just horrible service. 

Yelpers, read my other reviews.  I am not hard to please and I try to be very very fare with my reviews. 

Please STAY AWAY. DONT SAY U DIDN'T WARN YOU",hYan1ohCp1Vg58cNwPhV5g,1,0,1,xOJY5zu2PuvZ4npG3pFAzA

I have tried other food there and it was not appetizing so I just stuck to the Menudo which was actually not bad. Then this weekend I went in and there was a bug in my soup, so I called over the waitress who then sent over The owner who was nothing short of rude obnoxious and hostile. She had the nerve to insinuate that somehow the bug got into my soup while it was on the table, nonetheless I asked for the check with the expectation that I was going to be paying for my drink yet surprise they brought me the check for the soup that had the bug in it as well as my drink. At that point I told the owner she can eat the soup with the bug and she can charge me for the drink.after going back-and-forth with this rude and obnoxious  lady I ended up paying for the soup and a drink and left, will never be going back to this dirty nasty restaurant again. Plus I never really did like the way the owner treats the employees, she's aggressive loud and just a plain mean bully to them I guess it's because she's employing illegals but I don't really care if they are illegal aliens they still deserve to be treated respectfully.",_t2D0Cf9gI8bIY3JeuwxJA,0,0,1,7JLab5u5x3HbUxWbeL984A

Good music and the lady making hand made tortillas made me think this was going to be a great little find. Customer service was OK, not great. The lady was nice but not very attentive. The chips were stale and flavorless. We ordered pupusas my cheese pupusas were good, but how can you really mess that up. The chicharon pupusas were disgusting,salty and texture was horrible. We didn't eat those. We also ordered a chicken tamal. The tamal was burnt and was also salty. The food here was very dissapoonting. Never coming back.",Zy6C2JzgEFKPQZlf-SleEw,0,0,1,ds2TPmmka59ddWv9kK5OWw
3029580,2015-12-13,0,VA0GbpAN0qpa3bdHJ2a2iA,"I really loved this place and the whole atmosphere. From the food, to the women making tortillas, to the old relics inside. I ordered a breakfast dish. It was huevos rancheros. They were so good! I cleaned the plate. I enjoyed my meal. The waitress was nice and charismatic. The thing that makes this place come alive is the decor and the hand made tortillas. 
Whatever the hell they put in the salsas were good. Both were red sauce and spicy. One was made pure with chile de arbol, the other one was a mixture of I don't know what.

  The eggs had a real good sauce to them that tasted like it had some type of spaghetti sauce but in Mexican salsa form, if that makes sense. I absolutely loved that the eggs were on top of a tortilla. The little potatoes looking tater tots were good. For what its worth they are nice. The beans take like everywhere, nothing special there. 

   The only complaint are the people selling good to you. If you aren't a patient person it will piss you off. First you get the people selling cheese, then the people (supposedly deaf) selling little packs of goods. They leave it by your table and then come back for them. You don't say anything if you dont want to buy it. Just leave it alone. Then at the end you get a Filipino guy selling god knows what. It's like let me eat in peace. I wish the owners would realize they are disturbing their customers. 

  I do think that the uniforms need an update and maybe some type later on the decor can use a face lift. The parking sucks somewhat, but tolerable. The prices are good for what you get. Weird thing was that the place had American football on tv lol.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,0,0,4,eCCVtFAUQqgEna7iXbvAJA

They have karaoke  on the weekends which would be ok but they overdue it, there's just too much noise, the restaurant itself is not that big so the music volume should not be on full blast! I end up leaving with a headache.
Other than that I recommend the caldo 7 mares & cóctel de camarón",D4E0oydp4DkuZur_Pc9kAg,1,0,4,UK6TqELUvlphSFXfLuzzsA

4155148,2016-09-30,0,VA0GbpAN0qpa3bdHJ2a2iA,Horrible customer service!  The older lady that worked at night avoided us like the plague. I understand there was a larger group and larger group equals larger pay but I waited 20 min trying to get her attention to refill my water. There where only three groups there and we were all close together. I finally walked up to her at the desk and asked for water and the check. Still didn't seem to noticed me or want to notice me. The food was okay too but the rice was dry. Don't go at night or the old lady might ignore you.,svep2qfDXqpZPa1AHy5Nrw,0,0,2,aQMmqdWmUf00_Wq2Wu8sBw

The poor waitress seemed so depressed or moody better yet said. 
I didn't want to ask for anything, I didn't want her to go all psycho ninja on my ass.
I didn't receive 1 smile from this lady. The whole time I was there I just wanted to leave.

On with the food. I had a Caldo de albondiga, honestly though it tasted like it was from a can. It wasn't all that great. Even I could make this soup better. 
The cheesy salsa was bomb.com  It was a spicy salsa with cheese melted inside.

$2.00 for a canned soda because they don't have fountain drinks. 

Speedy service is a fact at this joint

Solicitors are welcome

Beer is served cold

Overall this place is clean

For now this places doesn't meet the standards for Mexican, perhaps Salvadorian.
I wouldn't recommend this places at all.",65qB0ibVi_6mMu87ioZR3w,5,2,2,2anHeMKDJY9wuj5IeM5_-A

We attend this being one of our favorite restaurants in town tonight for Mother's Day dinner with both our Mom's and children. The server we got was in patient and rude. She had no problem hiding it especially on her face. She never smiled once. She toss our tortillas on the table and my beverage almost spilt on me. She's lucky my husband left her a tip.
