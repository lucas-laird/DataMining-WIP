When everything is closed on your only night off, its Wednesday night, 4 or 5am Thursday morning, and you and your friends are not ready to go to bed, where better to go?  Really, where else is there?

  Once inside the 24hr bar you will be happy to know that you can have whatever drinks you want for free so long as you stick some money in the computerized betting machines and slowly play some bonus poker or black jack.  You can seriously milk this situation if you play slow, and all you'll have to do for your drinks is throw the bartender a tip (and sometimes go find him and flag him down even if there are no other customers).

  Also, at this time in the morning there are only so many places to eat, but two of those places are ""Pho Kim Long"" and ""Lee's Sandwiches"", which are both located in the same shopping center, are both open 24 hrs, and will both deliver to the bar.  The bar tender will provide you with menus, and the food will be delivered to you at the bar in no time.

  This place is a bit of a hidden gem, and you will never find more than a few other people in there, which is part of what makes it so cool!  Beware though, there are no clear windows, and before you know it, it will be 6 or 7am and you will be walking to your car in bright daylight dreading the drive home.

4131596,2012-05-10,0,LLCB372xpKhdISrLKU4Vkw,"I started coming here about 5 months ago, it has quickly become one of my go to places for pre dinner drinks.  I spend a lot of time in China town so it only makes sense to come here have a couple of drinks then go off for dinner.  I was always a little scared to go in because it has double tinted windows and thought I was going to run into some of the Las Vegas Triads in there.  ;) Nope a cool place with a cool vibe and very nice decor!  Think strip lounge ish off the strip with locals prices.

There are all kinds of people in the bar Asian decent, Tattoo guys, business men and women, dealers from the casinos like I said a little of everything.  The type of music they play depends on the crowd there at the time.  Quite a few Tv's so you can watch your games.  There is a ton of good food within stumbling, walking and driving distance.  A lot of the food places in china town are 24 hrs as is this bar. They do have Lee's sandwich and Pho Kim Long that deliver food here for them.  I haven't been there late night but I have heard it gets pretty busy.  They have a full bar with gaming, couches with tables for lounging and a back room off the main bar a bit for parties with couches curtains and a VIP feel.

It is under new management so they do have drawings for four of a kinds and wheel spins for full houses for happy hours.  They have 3 happy hours for the 3 different shifts in this town and I do seem to win here quite a bit!  A big bonus in my book!

Some of the downfalls of this place is because it is such a diverse crowd you never know the environment you will be coming into.  Sometimes they have parties and the music is extra loud.  The free wi-fi is moody and sometimes does not work ( if you now me that is a big gripe of mine ) But I am willing to put up with the downfalls for good drinks with good people.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,1,0,4,hMOSxxodSZDaTcZ9gFkFag
4238527,2012-09-08,1,LLCB372xpKhdISrLKU4Vkw,"So I get a text from my girl Shay ""Karaoke TONIGHT @ Little Macau in Chinatown""  I jump on YELP to read the reviews for this place.  Reviews were ok, 3STARS mainly, if you looking for the MEGAstrip vibe then you might as well just go down to the strip.

A very low-key type of establishment, dark and cheap drinks, my personal opinion nothing fancy but a place to have fun with friends.  

NO FOOD, eat before you get here or just go to one of the many restaurants that are opened 'til the wee hours. 

Super selection for karaoke....HELLOOOO, where can you do a BAD rendition of Salt 'n Pepa's PUSH IT"" i'm just saying.  I don't know if it's the same DJ every weekend but the DJ that was there tonight was awesome.  He played all popular line dance songs: THE WOOBLE, CUPID SHUFFLE and I LOOK GOOD. That's a workout in itself, who needs a Zumba DVD when you can go to the bar and sweat.  

NO COVER, once again I have to repeat CHEAP DRINKS: $4 mixed drinks, heavy pour I LOVE IT.  Towards the back of the bar there are couches to sit with a big group, kind of like a VIP area w/o having to pay the VIP FEE.
 
Here's the reason why I'm giving this place a rating of: 4STARS
Giving my drink order to the bartender, she starts coughing and SNEEZED.  In my head (and it probably was written all over my face) I was saying ""she better was her hands before she makes my drink...

and that's what she did, she stepped away went to the bar sink and washed her hands with soap and water.  On top of that, got out the HAND SANITIZER and sanitized her hands.  Came back to complete my drink order, prior to asking me what my drink was she apologized and said ""I had to wash my hands, I was coughing my badd""  Not only did I give a her a nice tip for the polite courtesy but it also up'd my star rating from 3STARS to 4STARS for Little Macau.

If you're looking for flashy, overpriced drinks, scantily clad women and  outrageous cover charge this is not the place.  Ok, maybe the scantily clad women but that's it.

If you're looking to kickback, crack jokes and hang with friends, have a good time then this is the place for you.  Throw on some shorts, a tank top and some sandals and go have a good time.  Sing a song or two...

OMG, how can I forget they have THE BEASTIE BOYS in the karaoke book. C'mon who doesn't like the BEASTIE BOYS? girl or guy, ijs

4287108,2008-06-25,0,LLCB372xpKhdISrLKU4Vkw,"I'm always in Chinatown and last night was the first time I've checked out Little Macau. 

I don't know how this place would fit into my social life. I've never seen it a full house, so its not good for people-watching. Its alright for an overpriced cocktail, but its too far away from home to be my corner bar. I paid $14 for two Tanqueray and tonics. Its a nice low key place to have a drink if you're in the neighborhood. 

I think they had happy hour from 10p to 1a. We ordered our first round at 950p and later ordered two more rounds and an appetizer. We didn't get any discount. 

They have a small menu with dumplings ($7-8) and fried rice and a lot of Portugese-influenced dishes, like Carne de Porco with Green Beans ($13), as Macau was colonized by the Portugese. 

I think the bartender was saying something about the joint being built right around the time the whole no smoking in establishments that serve food law was being passed, so they came up with an agreement to outsource food from the ""Korean restaurant next door"" (I believe he was referring to Dae Jang Keum or DJK). Its convenient for them because they don't have to worry about kitchen health codes and pay for all of the equipment and worry about taking up precious bar stool space with a kitchen. But it took longer then it should've for my friend to get her steamed pork dumplings. And the bartender didn't seem that knowledgeable about the foods. ""Everything that I've tried is good."" But its friggin' bar food, who cares how good it is? 

The decor was nice. My friend loved the gold wall with velvet elaborations. The lounge in the back is really laid back. But there was no bar wench, so you have to order your drinks at the bar every round.

Also, the entrance is very unassuming. It's a simple door that I've probably passed a few times without thinking twice. The reason I mention all of that is because the interior is deceptively huge! It's got a pretty large bar area and even a nice lounge area in the back. You'd never know it from the outside.

But in the end, it's just a bar. It provides a decent option if you want a drink after eating at a nearby restaurant (Mr Tofu, Hot n Juicy, Fukuburger across the street, etc). When we were in there, they had a Jäger shot menu, from which we all ordered a Surfer On Acid. After that, a few of us had some Gin and Tonics.

We came here to watch the Superbowl this year and the crowd gave the place an exciting feeling.  During that day, they were giving away raffle tickets to win bottles of alcohol.  Luckily, my friend and I won a bottle of wine.  Service was exceptional as the bartender tended to us as soon as she saw us sit down.  I was very happy with her.

A couple of years ago, I gave my boyfriend a surprise birthday party here.  I chose Little Macau for the price of their beverages and because of the private back area they have.  We had a successful night with 30 of friends with us.  There was no charge for using the back room, and we were permitted to bring food from outside in to their establishment.

Heard about the place in the past and came by for a friend's birthday party.  I felt like I was at a ghetto Waipahu graduation party though, #nostalgia.  

Its a decent sized place and decorated with that Macau look.  There are really cool accent chairs up front and a more lounge area at back.  The bar separates the two and noticed that they added a little arcade game that gauges your punching power.  The bartender has a running tally on the high score.  Anyone that tops the high score is honored with a  shot of their choice.  Pretty cool.

However, the bar is loaded, it lacks on its beer variety and serves up the regular domestic selection.  The wildest thing they have is Lagunitas IPA, but, they did have some Japanese whiskey that I must say was a pleasant surprise.  Got a little tipsy that I failed to get the name of it though.

There was a creepy DJ guy though that spun old school 90's hip-pop and sang along with them.  He had a lame Karaoke shirt that read, karaoke ninja...or something to that effect.  Can you say weirdo??  My buddy Reno was offered an opportunity to spin there with a few of his friends a few weeks later and was more my speed.

Also another downside is that they do not serve any food here.  What they do is order from Pho Kim Long or other nearby diners and bring it in.  It's a bit tacky, but guess its better than nothing.
