89724,2011-09-27,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"I went to Tverskaya for the first time last Sunday.  We had a party of six and we tried several appetizers, salads and entrees.  I was impressed with all of the food.  

We started with the Herring, Herring garnished with dill and served with butter and boiled potatoes, the Boyarsky Platter, Roast beef, tongue and buzhenina (roast ham) served with horseradish, the Stolichniy/Olivier, Chopped chicken and cooked vegetables mixed with mayonnaise and spices, the Borsch, Red beets, cabbage, potatoes, meat and a dollop of sour cream garnished with dill, the cucumber salad, Sliced cucumbers tossed in house dressing and chopped dill and the tomato salad, Sliced tomatoes tossed in house dressing, parsley and garnished with crumbled feta cheese.  All of which were well cooked with good quality ingredients and very tasty.  

For entrees we had, Chicken Kiev, Beef Stroganoff, Shasklik, Viennese Schnitzel, Hungarian Goulash, & the Langyet Steak.  All of which were fresh and flavorful.  The Stroganoff was a particular favorite of mine.  We'll definitely be back!",aJvNNSBbbaZYAlKGnOXiSQ,1,0,4,XfqvkgCqGu4uYsOi_IlHhw
91506,2011-06-29,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"My spouse and I tried this place on our last trip to Las Vegas since we had never had Russian food before. While I have no idea if this place is authentic or not, boy is it delicious!

We ordered the blinchiki and the golubtsy as appetizers, and split the shashlik entree. Everything was extremely yummy! I was particularly impressed by the golubtsy (cabbage rolls stuffed with meat...I have never had cabbage that tasted this good!) and the sauce that comes with the shashlik. Also, there is a delicious herb butter that comes with the bread. My spouse ordered the kvass to drink, which he describes as a bread cola. Although it was interesting, it really wasn't my thing, but he liked it and would order it again.

We topped off the meal with the crepes, which were amazing! They were filled with all different kinds of fruit and topped with ice cream! The dish was huge and could easily have been split between four people.

Finally, the servers were very friendly and talkative. One of them even gave us show recommendations.

Overall, I was extremely impressed! I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant the next time I visit Las Vegas!",6SCoSQHRQr-7xdGZJUaqGg,1,0,5,6g0sQoTwcqgYtKIFePjjMg
264732,2012-04-14,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"OK, I've never had Russian food before, even though I grew up in a multi-ethnic (slum) in the New York City area.  I didn't know what to expect, but according to the other reviews, this was good in Vegas.  We had early reservations on a Friday night, but until halfway through our meal, we were the only customers.  One waitress on, very pleasant and helpful.  I agree it was both hard to find and tacky inside.  Our group eats out together quite often, so we had the opportunity to try many of the dishes on the menu.  In the appetizer section we had the tongue (tender but bland), the Pickled Platter (Ok, but nothing to write home about), and the Blinchiki (filled with ground beef-OK, but a bit bland).  Entrees included Chicken Kiev (tough and dry chicken, but the potatoes were good), Hungarian Goulash (tender pork, but light on the spices), Viennese Schnitzel
(never had it with pork, but pretty darn good), and the Chicken Tabaka (Hands down the best dish we shared-chicken tender and well seasoned, not at all overdone).

I may have been too kind with the three stars, but since I know little about Russian food, and some here who know Russian food have reviewed this place highly, I decided to go with it. For me, I doubt I'll return, but for those of you who want to samplae a culture you are unfamiliar with, it's a good, easy way to ease in.",Ger_Ldj0G5sUwXc9-AVB3g,0,0,3,R0BJ8ukTAn5WZk2Pr7tRqw

The food was simply awesome - a culinary delight! My wife and I love to try international food and this was our first Russian experience. I highly suggest the Borsch and Golubtsy!

They hope to have alcohol in the next 6 months, but in the meantime, it is BYOB. The service was a bit slow, but the staff was very pleasant. They seemed surprised to see tourists since the restaurant seems to cater more to locals.",AmNDsjSgMwmxk041ENimaQ,0,0,4,dYlHpMWbuJdH6E4UInIXaQ

847591,2011-06-21,4,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"Tverskaya is, hands down, the pinkest restaurant in Las Vegas. Holy shit, it is pink.  Pink curtains, hot pink walls. Pink.

I also suspect they have a Russian grandmother chained up in the kitchen, forced to endlessly chop cabbage, stew various meats and make borscht.  As a former Eastern European resident, I am very familiar with borscht, i.e. beet soup, and Tverskaya's wonderful version is packed with cabbage, potatoes, and chunks of beets. Great for a cold, Las Vegas day (hypothetical).  They also serve some tasty Vareniki, similar to pierogi. My boyfriend ordered some with cottage cheese (which is more like a sweet, smooth farmer's cheese) and he scarfed them all down.

My Hungarian Goulash entree included all the Slavic classics: mashed potatoes (amazingly not dry), tangy red cabbage salad, and slow-cooked chunks of pork topped in a brown gravy.  It was all tender, delicious, and very homestyle.  I washed it all down with Kvas, a yeasty drink that tastes like really, really yeasty beer mixed with apple juice.  The menu advertised it as non-alcoholic but I've always known Kvas as low-alcohol.  So, any recovering alcoholics or seven-year-olds may want to steer clear.

Which leads me to my biggest criticism of Tverskaya: they don't serve alcohol.  Now, I'm not a lush or anything, but I thought that was really strange.  Russian food without beer or vodka?  Unfathomable.  

They do, however, let you bring in your own alcohol, so, grab a six pack, a Restaurant.com coupon (it's expensive) and check out Tverskaya!",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,3,2,4,ZkScRWY7_DmlzDw_LubEOg

1216383,2011-12-05,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"This was my first taste of Russian food and with nightmare visions of hamburger helper beef stroganoff influencing me, I was nervous about about what I might taste. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised by Tverskaya. I was thrilled. 24 hours later, I am still thrilled. In fact, I'm in love and can't wait to go back. 

For appetizers, we had Beef Blinchiki, which are perfect crepes filled with flavorful beef and drizzled with sour cream. We also had the Vereniki, magic dumplings filled with magic potatoes and magic onions that made the world seem like a much nicer place.

My husband had the Chicken Kiev, and it was delicious and buttery with a hint of dill. The ""home style"" potatoes and onions were crispy, salty, sweet, and tangy all at the same time. I had the Mushroom Blinchiki as an entree, and the chef gave me a side of buckwheat. The mushrooms were amazing and the buckwheat surprised me because it was so fragrant and almost floral. It tasted almost like a slightly hoppy beer. I also sampled the beef stroganoff, which was at least one million times better than any American style stroganoff I've ever had. 

Dessert was decadent. We had Praga cake, which was a dense and moist chocolate layer cake with a rich ganache. The Napoleon, a flaky and nutty pastry, was also very good and a bit like a non-sticky baklava. The dessert crepes were highly addictive and each one had a different mix of fillings - apples, berries, raspberries, pears, peaches, nutella. Oh, and on the side of the crepes, a dollop of pretty pink homemade cherry ice cream. 

Our service was great. The waiter was attentive and funny. We were also able to bring our own beer without any corkage fee. The level of food we had did not match the low cost. The chef paid attention to every detail and each dish felt like a present. The food has seemingly simple ingredients, but the flavors are complex, and layered, and all-around awesome. It was so much fun to eat here. I will definitely be back, probably before the month is out.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,1,0,5,9E-hc-iBb_jNQGwM4HDgtQ
1543808,2012-03-10,2,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"Hubby and I were in the neighborhood, so it was time to finally try Russian cuisine... errr... food.  This place is hard to find, since the writing on the door doesn't stand out from the picture behind it.  Just go to the corner of the shopping center, where the overhang is, and look on the right wall for their door.

The interior decor is.. well... tacky.  Cutouts adorn the walls, the tv was on AMC but muted, and there was modern Russian music playing from a radio somewhere.  The booths have huge backs but they're otherwise quite open, and the color scheme is a mix of red and hot pink. 

Our waitress was fine.. our sodas arrived and she got them wrong, but we didn't make an issue of it - $2.50 for a can of pop.  If I paid $30 for a 12-pack, I'd be furious.. but apparently they have a bad restaurant buyer ;)

We started with Golubtsy, cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and spices, and those were good.  You get 3, which is difficult to share between two people, but once again.. we made it work for us.  We ordered the cucumber and tomato salads, which are actually large quantities of cold side dishes rather than actual salads.  The cucumber salad was covered in dill and an oil that was rather off-tasting.  It definitely helped when we added salt to it.  The tomato salad was rather bland, more flavor came from the feta cheese than from the actual tomatoes, but I won't hold that one against them.

Hubby ordered Borsch, because he's always wanted to try it, and I sampled it also.  He liked it a bit more than I did, same as with the Golubtsy, which is good because you get a huge bowl of the soup.

Our entrees arrived.. he had the pork Shashlik and I got the Chicken Kiev.. they forgot the sauce for his entree and we had to wait a while to get that, but the meat was tasty on its own.  The Chicken Kiev, however, was... boring.  Overbreaded, it was slicing into a rock (and they don't give you a serrated knife, which would be helpful - instead they warn you about possible burns from spurting hot butter).  It was bland, with virtually no flavor whatsoever.  The best part of the meal was the ""fries"" that came with it - julienne strips of potato with dill and an addictive oily sauce.  Hubby tasted his mashed potatoes that came with his Shashlik and that was the only bite he ate of them.. but he kept stealing potatoes from my plate.

With tip, we paid about $85 for a meal for two that wasn't worth half that.

Overall description.. tacky, boring, bland.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,2,0,2,f8iALXZdidNxH_VK8Jw_rA
1813902,2012-01-16,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"I just had my birthday dinner here and it was great.  I ordered the vareniki (dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and covered in caramelized onions, garlic butter and sour cream) and the chicken tabaka (marinated cornish gamehen - spatchcocked grilled, juicy and delicious).  Everything was very authentic. 

The service was great too.  My friends had never tried Russian food before and the waiter explained the entrees and made some recommendations.  At the end of the meal, everyone's plates were clean so obviously they liked it too.

This place is a hard to find, hole in the wall but worth the search.  It's easier to see the sign for the Jerusalem Grill next door.",JXyk_ZMDAIn3SxX7Z3Wnig,0,0,5,UHrxQ33A8rMwwoH3pysqaw

It's the kind of place you KNOW each dish is prepared with the utmost detail in mind--every vegetable fresh as can be, everything cooked with utmost care, and then carefully arranged like a beautiful display on the plate. If this place was on the strip, they could outshine half the restaurants. And their prices would be TOTALLY reasonable. As it is, being tucked away in a shopping center, their prices are a little high.

As I am the youngest (a blessing and a curse in any family) I was volunteered to sprawl across my sister, brother's girlfriend and my boyfriend in the back. I emerged mildly achy and incredibly sweaty. For as you see, the boyfriend in question was Irish and was not doing well with the Las Vegas heat. For in Ireland summer is lovely, but only lasts about two weeks. I proclaimed this had better be freakin' delicious or I was going to wipe my sweat off on everyone who had not yet been graced with it.   

EVERYTHING WAS INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS. 

And I DO mean delicious.  My brother-in-law had a coupon so we got a bunch of everything. Can't remember what we got, but everything was wonderful. I remember the Kebob type things were terribly tasty and the berry drink was light and fruity. I'd never had any Russian food before, and, not going to lie, kinda expected it to be potatoes and vodka. I was fantastically incorrect.

2323322,2011-10-14,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"As others have said, this place is tough to find unless you are looking.  It is indeed in the back corner of a strip mall at Flamingo/Decatur (SE corner).  There is a big sign in front that says ""European Russian Restaurant.""

Upon entering, we were greeted by our host, who asked if we had ever had Russian before.  We told him no and he explained some of the items on the menu and what was most ""Russian"" and essential to have.  I must say, our host/waiter was awesome.  He was super friendly and attentive, and we later discussed the restaurant, cuisine, travel, culture and more with him.  

We had the beef stroganoff and the hungarian goulash, as well as some cabbage stuffed rolls (golubsty I believe).  My goulash was excellent.  Large pieces of tender pork along with some mashed potatoes and a delicious side of cabbage with vinegar and other stuff.  I am not sure what all was in the cabbage but it was great.  I enjoyed the goulash immensely.  My wife had the stroganoff which was unlike your normal americanized stroganoff.  It had a thick texture and a wheaty taste to it, which was delicious.  It had a side of pickled vegetable of some sort as well.  There were a few other menu items we definitely wanted to try on another visit as well.

For dessert we had a 'napoleon' cake, which is like a multilayered pastry filled with condensed milk and cream between the layers, as well as a 'praga' cake, which is a super moist soaked chocolate cake with a hint of citrus.  They make the desserts in house.  The praga was good, but the napoleon was delicious.  The napoleon was also very nicely plated with some swirls of red and green fruit sauces on the plate.

We also had a glass of mors, which is a dliuted berry juice drink they make there.  It was neat but it tasted just like it sounds.  We used a $25 restaurant.com cert, which really helped also. 

The decor is very pink inside, and our host explained that he was still working on adding some other colors and explained the significance of the color scheme.  He also mentioned he is working on getting a liquor license as well.  There was only 1 other table in there when we arrived, but one other showed up as we were leaving and one more had just left when we arrived.  Overall the service was awesome and very friendly, as the food was excellent.  We had an appetizer, a glass of Mors, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and the total with 18% tip and tax was $45 with the restaurant.com certificate.

We ate so many wonderful things, left so satisfied, prices were reasonable, and we even returned once again before leaving Vegas.

Highly reccomended is the Golubtsy - cabbage rolls, so creamy and full of flavor, absolutely delicious! Also the Beef Stroganoff was amazing. The bread (buckwheat I think?) they served at the table was unique and delicious. To blance the heavier dishes was lovely cabbage salad and very pretty garnish, it was a class act all the way, and a delight for all of the senses.

First of all the place is hard to find because there is really bad signage in the shopping center as a whole.  it is tucked away in the corner of the strip mall.

Once inside the service was friendly and attentive for the most part.  The place was not crowded, we were only 1 of four tables that were occupied the entire evening.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers and each had a good flavor and were unique.  The breads they served were I assume traditionally russian and offered us something new but not memorable.

I enjoyed the entree's the most with the goulash and cornish game hen being done well.

What distracted us the most was at 8pm the entertainment began, a lovely woman singing to recorded music.  She has a nice voice but in a small place with few patrons the signing was too loud and obtrusive.  We were there to visit with our table and when the singing started we could not hear each other.  We asked our waitress if the sound could be softened and we saw her go the singer but if she made any change it was not apparent.  The relief came when she took her break.

Overall it was a fair experience and I guess if you now authentic russian cuisine maybe you would have appreciated it more.

We started with the steamed beef tongue.  It was cold, so be brave... it's worth it.  The meat was so soft and delicate, and thinly sliced.  It came with a horseradish that was just amazing.  We also tried the Golubtsy, which is a cabbage roll with pork and beef.  The cabbage was perfectly prepared, and even as someone who doesn't really like cabbage, it was delicious!

Other members of our group ordered the pork, which was kind of dry.  The steak was good.  I had the mashed potatoes with my dinner instead of fries but I wish I would have ordered the fries.  They were home made, flavorful and delicious.

The Food:
Vareniki - dumplings stuffed with potatoes - very tasty
Crepes with mushrooms - if you're not a fan of crepes then this may be an odd combination but its actually quite good.
Borscht - i dont ever remember it being this good in russia so i don't know if they took some artistic liberties here or if its really just been that long for me. This soup rocks. Comes out in a perfect sized bowl. The vegetarian gf loved it too till she bit into a chunk of meat. ^_^

Beef Shashlik (tried the pork too but beef is better) - cooked perfectly and not overseasoned. The pork shashlik was a bit chewy and more fatty so I liked the beef better. The plate doesn't come with potatoes or starch so if you just want to get your serving of protein, the beef shashlik may be the best choice.

We got a piece of the napoleon cake which apparently they make on the premises which is putting way more effort into it than I thought they needed to. Its a nice touch regardless. It was good. Not really my cup of tea but the dessert lovers would probably enjoy it.

Thats it for the actual food. Their menu is only 2 pages long but its actually full of russian dishes. There are maybe 10 different entrees and tons of appetizers. They don't serve alcohol but will let you bring your own so keep that in mind in case you're driving around with a six pack in the trunk and need some booze with your meal.

Also, somethign unusual for russian restaurants - they actually plate their food well and it comes out looking nice. Not just slopped on the plate into a big mountain of stuff. Definitely above average in that department. 

The service was friendly and to the point. Typical for a russian restaurat..maybe moe friendly than average but we don't really come in to chat up the staff so thats just fine with us.

Otherwise it was all good. Oh and the place was empty other than our table which is very very odd because the food is much better than you would think judging by the number of customers. Hopefully their business picks up.",HwmTzORmEfa9HgSfmA0RQw,4,2,5,hzLPQc1xSD82SteLV0Vz6g

The waiter told us that the goulash, the beef stroganoff and the chicken kiev we ordered wouldn't be like any we'd ever had, because this restaurant was authentic. He was very right. They were all different than what I expected, but they were all delicious and memorable. The goulash was particulary stunning.

I was able to talk a old high school buddy into coming here with me.  The experience for me would be to try something as close to a Russian authentic meal as possible or at least more authentic than FPSRussia (Youtube his videos).

We came here on a Tuesday at around 5pm and the place wasn't crowded yet, score 1-0 for Kevin versus dinner rush.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.  I asked for a menu to pre-plan while waiting for my buddy to arrive and I looked for the most Russian looking names on the menu.  I couldn't help but notice the wooden walls, almost as if I ran into a Russian home or cabin because of a winter storm and was welcomed by some friendly family to stay warm or until the storm passes.

Where is the Russian beers??  Score 0-1 Kevin vs Zangief the Russian wrestler from Street fighter that drinks while he bodyslams you in the game.

So we shared a Tverskaya shrimp as an appetizer and it was good.  Portions small but it's an appetizer, the spice and oil mixed really well together with the shrimp.  I was hoping it would dethrone my other favorite shrimp appetizer (Shrimp Guadalajara from and Guad restaraunt) but it didn't.  3/5.  btw, Anything and eerrrthing pink 5/5.

My entree was the Sashlik, pork w/onions and other veggies.  My friend had a chicken dish that came with fruits.  My impression from just these two dishes alone is that they put a lot of care and thought into their dishes.  I don't know if these two dishes represent the deep Russian food culture but the love is there.  No ingredient is ignored if it requires one.  If your restaurant was in a casino and you didn't have a particular fruit or veggie then you could always run to the next kitchen to see if they have it.  If your establishment is a stand alone then you have only yourself to rely on.  My pork was cooked perfectly, there was a bit too much sides for me but the sauce that came with the pork was Russian like.  4/5.  The meals were pricey for what they were and could go down a notch, but I am glad to support any non-commercial restaurant.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,4,1,4,4kT0Jc41sRaX6F6KPXumgg
4147005,2012-10-10,0,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"Oh, where to begin on this? How about I break it down by the good and the bad.

The Good:
The food I had was mostly delicious. The Stroganoff was so full of flavor. Very heavy on the garlic with tender beef and mashed potatoes. No noodles here. There was even a side of tomato slices and cucumber slices. I was brought a basket of crusty bread and butter. Very good also. Also on the side of good was the service. Excellent is actually a better word to describe the service. The hostess/waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was asking me about my experience (or lack of) with Russian food. She took the time to explain and describe the food to me. She asked me how I liked the Stroganoff compared to traditional American style. Dessert was insane. I ordered a Napolean. It was so rich and sweet, and made in house. It was refreshing how I was treated here. 

The Bad:
I ordered iced tea and received something different. I'm not really sure what it was. It was sweet and taste a little bit like old beer. I was told it was a classic Russian drink.  The mistake was corrected when realized it was made. The borscht was unremarkable. It was not bad but it taste much like a soup I made at home not long ago. I expected something a little more stand out.

The Other:
So neither good or bad, the decor. It is a small and simple place that feels much like a cafe. It is dimmly lit with a disco ball in the middle and a small stage up front. It looks like they have an open mic night or some kind of Russian entertainment. In fact, there was Russian pop music playing from an unseen speaker.

Overall, I am impressed and pleasently surprised. If it wasn't for the higher price tag I would like to go back. Luckily for this night I had a great deal from Groupon ;)",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,4,YazRELjwl2ySpm797glSQQ

I just completed an MA degree in International Relations--my coursework focused  mostly on Russia and Ukraine--so what better way to celebrate this honor than to go to a Russian restaurant? I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either if like Russian/Eastern European food.

The service was extraordinary, first of all.  Yes, I read some of the comments about the decor, and I can see why some posted some comments on it.  However, to me, it was very Russian and appropriate, so it wasn't that odd for me.  You come to a restaurant to eat, don't you?

And, they will feed you. The portion sizes are generous.  We had the following for appetizers: the summer platter (lots of fresh veggies, feta cheese and olives) and borscht (beet soup). The borscht was awesome!

My husband had the Hungarian goulash and I had the beef stroganoff.  The stroganoff was nice, tender and creamy.  Yum.  My husband reported the goulash was good as well.  We finished the meal with a shared made-in-the restaurant-daily Neapolitan dessert and Turkish coffee.  For two iced teas, two appetizers, two entrees, a dessert and 2 Turkish coffees, we did not break more than $65.  And, we were stuffed too!

4290814,2011-12-06,1,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"I'm mad now.

We've been to Tverskaya three times now, and the food has been excellent each time. The prices are reasonable. On our most recent visit, my fiance and i treated our friends to dinner (see Crystal V.'s review). However, we used a restaurant.com gift certificate, and apparently this was a mistake.

Near the end of our meal, our waiter informed us that the mandatory 18% gratuity specified on the gift certificate went directly to restaurant.com instead of the waiter's pocket. In fact, he further explained that this was how restaurant.com was able to offer such steep discounts on their certificates. I conferred with my fiancee, and we both understood this statement to mean that the waiter would be receiving no gratuity unless we left extra. Naturally, we left extra - another $25 on top of the 18%. We received good service and had a lovely meal, so why not?

Everything was fine until we got home and my fiancee sent off an email to restaurant.com, who promptly informed us that the waiter receives every penny of the 18% mandatory gratuity. 

In other words, we just left our waiter a 38% tip because he lied to us.

Frankly, I feel a little violated. We have never been shy about tipping, and we were already intending to leave a few extra bucks to make up the difference (we normally calculate 20% and then round up). It is a shame, because I truly enjoy their food and I had a wonderful evening dining with friends. But I can't shake the feeling of being lied to, of being scammed. If you do go to Tverskaya, don't bring a restaurant.com certificate. If you do bring a certificate, be aware that the 18% is going to the waiter, not the website.

After this, I'm not sure I'll be going back. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that value my business enough not to try and scam me.",DjsS89nD3eaoUuFhrkc5Ig,14,0,1,Rp8DNZINfgVPeS_OMigmeg

4484538,2012-05-27,1,O9J0XoJR16wWbSZpXs9Uwg,"Saturday night, 8:30 p.m.  One couple is seated at one of the banquettes.  That's it.  But that's what I read in the Yelp reviews, and it's a damned shame.  I just don't understand why there aren't more people eating at this restaurant, and how they've managed to stay open so long with so few diners and no liquor license.

This was our first visit, and it was good.  Oh, sure, there's a disco ball in the middle of the ceiling, and a stage covered up with black, gauzy fabric, with Christmas tinsel and icicle lights dangling.  The piped-in music was a bit tinny, and the TV was on, albeit with the sound off, but just above our heads, so I could see for certain that Cynthia McFadden is indeed the daughter of Kathryn Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  And the big cardboard cutouts of maybe tango dancers? decorating the walls, along with unintelligible Russian signs - well, intelligible to Russians, but this is a Ukrainian restaurant.

The room is ringed with comfortable banquettes upholstered in a slightly Southwest pattern (Southwest Ukraine?), and the floor is beautiful - large tiles in an inlaid wood pattern that almost had me fooled.  There's a bit too much light for it to be romantic - the room could benefit from less of it, with sine candles on the tables for ambience sake.  

But all this is secondary to the main reason for being here:  the food.  It's delicious.  We took the advice of one reviewer and shared two hot entrees, the Pelmeni and the potato Vareniki, and both were tasty.  The sauteed, caramelized onions were spectacular with the potato filling of the Vareniki.  Then we shared the Beef Stroganoff, which was garnished with a cabbage and carrot slaw (no mayo), sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, and seasoned fried potatoes (they were a bit too salty, and I'd ask for them to leave the extra salt off next time, but that's just me).

The waitress was a young woman who's been here since the age of 12, so her English was flawless, and the service was excellent.  She brought us each a taste of the  unusual Kvas, the Russian drink made from fermented bread.  It's non-alcoholic and is sort of beer-like, but doesn't taste like beer.  It was okay, but this is the rare Vegas restaurant that has no liquor license, and we were forewarned from the other reviews, so we'd brought a bottle of wine with us. The wine was more enticing than the Kvas, so we didn't feel the need to order it.

All three dishes exceeded our yearly quota of sour cream, so we were too full and too over-cholesteroled to think of ordering dessert, so we quit after the Stroganoff.

I cut my teeth on Russian cuisine in the many Russian Night Clubs in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where the tables groan under the weight of the appetizers alone, and a bottle of vodka graces each table.  Tverskaya couldn't be further from that scene.  But a great meal at a great price is waiting to be discovered by Las Vegas, and I hope they do.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,2,4,4ZgO_XM3ghirL203Iil9qA

The fact that they don't offer alcohol was not a big deal to us since we seldom ever order acohol in a restaurant. I feel guilty paying sometimes 4 times the cost of a bottle of wine and often nix the idea with the thought that I will just open a bottle when we get home.  I do believe though that if you do want wine with your dinner and you bring in your own bottle that is ok.

We ordered the Julien to start, I had the Stroganoff and my husband had the Langyet Steak. The service was friendly, but very slow.

The bread and garlic butter kept up satisfied while we waited and was so delicious I had to restrain myself when the waitress offered to get us some more.

I came here with a friend on a Saturday night and found the place empty as others have mentioned. However, we were quickly attended to and service was excellent. 

Between the two uf us, we had: 
kvas (fermented bread drink) - Homemade, legit, 5 stars
mors (fruit/berry non-alc coctail) - Very refreshing, not too sweet, 5 stars
olivier (potato+chicken salad extraordinaire) - Done the right way with chicken, 5 stars 
pelmeni (beef dumplings) - Solid specimen, 4 stars
borcht (beat based soup) - Excellent specimen, 5 stars
chicken tabaka (Cornish game hen) - Great seasoning, 4.5 stars 
Slice of napoleon cake to go - Ate the next day, 4 stars
The bill was $59 pre-tip. This is pretty good for a Russian restaurant. 

The food was all homemade, so were the drinks and napoleon. Overall this is a solid Russian place with, yes, a tacky decor and not enough patrons (which is unfortunate). I suggest sharing a few appetizers and main dish (family style) to make the most of a ""true"" russian culinary experience.

If you have never tried Russian cuisine, I highly recommend that you do. But, understand that it is not supposed to have tons of spices, it is more ingredient based.
