700321,2014-06-05,0,w_A1qFeQ3vOl7o4kdBxPXA,"I did not like this place as they did not honor their yelp check in deal. They said we had to be outside a karaoke room to get the deal when we ordered the food. The beef stew noodles were sticky and weird tasting. The chicken wings tasted a bit burnt. 

They had tons of Chinese song selections. So if you just want to sing that's perfect. Their English song selections was a bit lacking. I couldn't find many songs that they have at Que.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,2,bKBFaTgYMoLzHPLXHKsPQQ

So we were trying to decide where to go and found in the same shopping area was MUZE. We were surprised on the place and how much room for us to Karaoke. The staff was friendly and gave us suggestions on what to try. 

Ever since then my group has been down to karaoke there.",JDk5siWzJkY_rOmBdjgAlQ,0,0,5,ahYsoIhX8ADR283KD2DnBQ

I called them & someone answered the phone so I asked him when this place open then he told me that they close most of days.  Whaaaattt?",xEVzArJnvg8w0F77SmLF5w,0,0,1,9SYzg1JDMxEWU-PbBGY3ww

Awesome food...check
Awesome service...check.

Currently serving Japanese food and they have the freshest and softest steam rice!

The decor is dim and romantic. There is a dining area which you can tell every detail was well thought out and custom made. Which includes karaoke!

If karaoke is your poison, they offer 3 private rooms which vary in size and each room is decorated with its own theme.

They serve everything on the menu in these private rooms. So bring your friends, sit down, sing and enjoy yourself!

FYI , they have high chairs!",9b9oHv4ZUsBDrRkQ68jmjQ,5,3,5,2_Pf5sNF6vVmyG3abGbc7g
3456040,2015-05-21,1,w_A1qFeQ3vOl7o4kdBxPXA,"Under new management and they are officially open for lunch! I ordered the basil eggplant, some noodles, pork balls, and soup. I wish I knew the exact names for each, but unfortunately I forgot to write them down. Anyways, everything was good, but I didn't try the pork balls, since I don't eat pork, but my friend said they were good. The prices are good and you can get legit entrees from 5.95! The portions are huge! My favorite was the soup that had greens and tofu. Will be back to try other things.",Tjuwm4XdQjlmGdKVgEHx-A,1,1,5,1zE0k6IKttyxlCFmVFkTkg

The karaoke machine was nice with good sound and great song availability in both Japanese and English.  The room was very clean.

Beware the pricing system though.  When I walked in I asked for a room for an hour.  It took 5-10 minutes to boot up the machine and I glanced at the clock when the first song began - 8:40p.  I set the alarm on my phone and at 9:40p we promptly exited.  We were charged for 1.5 hours.  Apparently, they charge by 30 minute blocks so we were charged from 8:30 to 10:00.  Gratuity is automatically included.  I recommended they prominently post or explain the pricing system and perhaps should notify you when you hit the duration you requested.

Again, decent karaoke setup but clarify pricing or you will be surprised when you get the bill.",52-MOicUS1NU3h7etVRbPQ,0,0,2,8N53wRq3KW--bOBwUo_UMA

Will be back !
Update - returned to find out the HOTPOTS are off the menu - nooooooo. 
They recommended BOOMING POT around the corner. Also good !!!!",3MsVCw9-oXPeyrA3d422vA,0,0,4,RFBvgANewDn-tYtA1x9wDA

My friend and I ordered home style spicy  braised beef  noodle, when it came out the noodles were way over cooked it was so soft. It was like eating a cup of noodle that has been sitting there for a while and soaked up all the water because it was bland. 
Maybe I will try this place again hopefully it will be better. I know it is still new",lgh7a1Qey0bbmv5JIQ1beQ,2,0,2,jmD1NqrslKq_HkMYxBNKhg

We had the braised pork foot and man, the meat is so tender just falls apart! We also had the scallion whole fish, which is good. The Shanghai three colored chicken was also decent. Overall, plenty of authentic Chinese dishes. 

Cool place if you want to bring a group of friends for karaokey.",pLk7GPpRVHxl4Rch8z5r_w,2,1,4,shKjP_ucx3dOtkC2ECZ-3w

I also thought it was very cool, how they had the karaoke there, showing the Chinese videos and the music, made me feel like I was in a different world. I think it would of been nice also, if they had more English music to, so everyone can feel welcome, not just one culture mostly. The waitress was friendly but she seem like she was more focus on my friend, cause he spoke Chinese and so I didn't feel that equal attention. I think normally in certain cultural places like this, some do seem more focus on their people or the person who knows the Chinese culture or speaks it very well. My buddy like Chinese females and Asian, so he enjoys the culture and knows how to speak their language. The thing that caught me off guard to, is that the waitress seem a little pushy on what we order. I wanted the rice but she felt that the rice wasn't the right choice, she kept saying to try the beef noodles, she felt the bowl of rice was to small and also that if we have beef noodles, we don't need the rice to. I wanted to have rice dammit ha ha and so I gave in and just order the beef noodles. I also order the plate of egg rolls, lamb chops, Chicken wings- Me and my buddy split those dishes. Then we had our own bowl of beef noodles, and our own strawberry banana smoothie.  The chicken wings was good, the egg rolls are great. I didn't like the lamb chops, the seasoning was off and to spicy. I noticed though, all the dishes seem small, I was in hopes that the plates will have lots of food, for the prices. Each plate was a small size.There was 4 lamb chops on the plate, 4 or 5 egg rolls on the plate, also the same with the chicken, 4 or 5 wings. I noticed the prices was almost ten bucks each, for these dishes. I felt there should of been more food in each dish, it wasn't a lot. The beef noodles, was a huge bowl, had lots of noodles. I like the beef noodles, great taste, lots of meat. I also thought the smoothies was good to, great size. I don't think I will be back at this place but I'm glad I checked it out.",sQb3cL26qaDgaXEQQTIUNQ,0,0,3,aQPE5LGIu-nD6T8FwlWA0g
