1332702,2018-05-19,0,6Tq13q3Ib17gSgP0zki3EA,If you want a good authentic Mexican gordita this is the place to go.  I had the two gordita plate ( it comes with rice and beans and cabbage salad) one Chile relleno gordita and one bean and cheese gordita.   Both were very good.  My daughter had the crane asada gordita and she thought the meat was good. My husband had a picadillo gordita and he loved it.  They also had the carne asada nachos which were huge and they enjoyed them as well.   They have horchata!  Me and my son always order horchata to drink  when we find a place that offers it.  The young lady was very nice and welcoming too.  So that's always a plus.    The place is a little small but it didn't feel crowded it still felt comfortable the way they set up the tables and seating.  We were planning our next visit before we left.  It is a little far from us but it is worth the drive every now and then for a good gordita.,JNBCCsPLEwiyR13xbIviIQ,1,1,4,bbLKsiotIUXsjHXXjv3Xlw

1503506,2017-09-21,9,6Tq13q3Ib17gSgP0zki3EA,"Credit where credit is due: I wouldn't even know about this place if not for Stephanie S.'s review. I've driven by a lot and ended up at other Mexican food restos in the area because the location signage is limited. It's in the corner of the Marketon plaza, and the interior is nice and homey.

But I came here for gorditas, which are way more popular in Texas than in Vegas, and they've been hard to find. In addition to the namesake stuffed pockets, the menu also offers plates as well as a variety of street snacks and raspados. 

I've tried three gorditas and an elote and I'll be back for more. The gorditas don't look huge but their appearance is deceptive and they're actually quite filling. The asada and chile relleno flavors have a premium charge, and were the two I tried first. The asada I found dry but the relleno was overflowing with cheese- I combined all the fillings into one pocket and it was perfection!  Adding a side of guac is another option. The chicken tinga was just okay; solid flavor on the sauce but the pocket got soggy and fell apart fast.  Plates come with rice and some amazing refried beans, or you can order a la carte and get their awesome elote en vaso with the works.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,18,4,OYXtggmLNVJajdeq6IMDMw

But it'll be the last time. Some people lack the common sense every human being has enough of or so I thought. This family comes in nothing out of the ordinary but then their child walks in with a dog. Again nothing out of the ordinary if this place was out on the street or out in the open and the kitchen was closed but its exactly the opposite they sit the dog next to the table I'm a dog lover and owner myself but I wouldnt take my dog to a place where I know serves food. COMMON FUCKEN SENSE! To make matters worst the people that worked there didn't say or do anything to correct they actually looked straight at the dog next to the table. Will be my second and last time me or any of my family comes to this place the food is delicious but if they allow a animal into the place what else do they allow in here to make them it's ok to do this type of thing??,Em22JzTGXbMOkuXyM1P4RA,0,0,1,HsYRV1u8G9eDICL3krHDCA
1779818,2018-04-24,1,6Tq13q3Ib17gSgP0zki3EA,"We've been wanting to try this place so decided to stop by today.  I got the carne asada gordita and it was a lot smaller than I thought. Also was served plain, just filled with meat, which was dry and not seasoned.  My daughter got the chicken burrito which she said was fatty. My husband got the pork & green sauce gordita and the pork skin with green sauce gordita.  Both were poorly flavored, he did not like them. We won't be back. Food was not worth it.",ltyYc01GxxJIML5EZ8cWcQ,0,0,1,h5hmfphWIpOnMRgQ21wxdA

I tried some of the pineapple one and it was ok. My girlfriend says she has had better in Vegas cheaper.

The service is fast, people are nice, establishment is clean, prices are affordable and the food is consistently delicious.   I always get the 2 gordita plate.  It comes with rice and beans.  The servings are generous.  I usually have to bring some home with me.  Be sure to go all out and get the horchata or jamica.  Both are made from scratch.",SAbYJqksHxWboFWqPZwDSQ,0,1,5,_0SUNALS9mG0pz-smbvRZg

Took it back to the hotel and turned it into an adult beverage. (If you catch my drift) ;)

Would have liked to try the churros!",8IL12NBMgRnUc69Y5t65QQ,0,0,5,5-hXtguVQohplJ3ndSeFyA

The flavor I picked was ciruela ""plum"" with some ""lechera"" condensed milk. It tasted really good when I drank it from the straw but when I wanted to actually eat the ice was when I was met with a challenge... the snow was more like crushed ice. See the picture... I gave them 3 stars because the service was great and the length of time that it took to make it was fast but the actually snow was not really what I was expecting. 

I am willing to give them a better chance at getting a better review from me if they upgrade their snow machine and make snow cones not crushed ice raspados. If you have dentures or sensitive teeth like me, this place is not recommended at all.",dDPPXBv2o8dWeRwzJeemVA,0,0,3,0w8OVRt0Klhig_GQxwJyrw

The gorditas here are super delicious and filling! I ordered the 3 plate and was filled with just one! I ordered the carne asada (.25 upcharge) and tinga. Your meal includes rice and beans that were so so delicious!!! The gorditas only come with whatever is on the item, so the gordita pocket and carne asada, nothing else. If you want a side of guac, it's 2.50 more, but they have some delicious green guacamole sauce and crema, SO BOMB!

The inside is clean and spacious, and there's only 3 workers, so calm your titties if you have to wait.

The food here is priced right and the portions are the traditional Mexican kind, LARGE. My friend ordered 2 sopes place, and the entire plate was full!!! She said they were so delicious as well!

I would definitely recommend this place, EAT MEXICAN AND EAT LOCAL!!! 

AJUA PINCHES PUTOS!

No ""food poisoning"" over here, either. Plus, they got our food right the first time, but that could be because we don't look like a bunch of salty, putas perras. We have class and are nice to those taking our order. IF YOU'RE RUDE TO THOSE WHO TAKE YOUR ORDER AND SERVE YOUR FOOD, GO FUCK YOURSELF AND CHOKE ON AN ELOTE.
