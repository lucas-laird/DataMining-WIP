42858,2014-09-22,0,9YiQ3o0EGmtojzjXdEfgeQ,"I love their vegan protein shakes! Chocolate Thunder is amazing. I'm not vegan but whey protein gives me an upset stomach. Their vegan protein is a five plant-source blend so the amino acid spectrum is excellent unlike just using brown rice or yellow pea. Their protein powder is also powerfully detoxifying. I know all of this because this place is right inside Partell Pharmacy and staffed by knowledgeable health coaches. They know a lot about supplements and helped me find a couple of awesome products that I really like. They have the protein powders and the greens powders, chocolate is my favorite, right there at the store. The health coaches will even give you their protein shake recipes. They also have metabolic assessments they can do and have health, wellness, and nutritional programs. I have also tried their Clean Green. It's a great way to get a lot of healthy greens with very little sugar. This is a truly healthy drink without all of the super sweetness and sugar overload found in most fruit-based smoothies. I don't eat nearly enough greens so having a Clean Green often keeps me feeling healthy and detoxified. Enjoy!",tdygTnmH033ny65XOsRudQ,1,0,5,lffSfbI1mD3Zx8gvQcqaxA

It's so clean and quiet. Just like every other juice bar, it's healthy. They don't have many choices, but honestly they have just enough choices. They have one with berries, they have one with non-berry fruits, they have just vegetables, they have a chocolate and a vanilla drink. 
I can't really comment on other things about this establishment. There isn't much to it. It has a purpose and definitely serves their purpose well. It's a simple juice bar/cafe. What else do you really expect? There aren't many in the area to begin with. So if you're in the area, just go; especially if you don't already juice at home.

The lady behind the counter was surly and grumpy, like she has a pebble in her shoe and blames the customers for it. I ordered a juice and a sandwich and it came to $20+. That would be expensive but ok if both were stellar. However, the sandwich was made with GOOD ingredients and a terrific sauce BUT ungenerous in portions--absolute bare minimum amount that could cover the bread.  For $9 you should get a BIG generous sandwich. It felt like a lady with a stone in her shoe made it--not a happy sandwich. The juice...just bizarre. I got a large in a cup around 8"" tall. Of that, literally 7 inches is frothy pulp with less than 1"" of actual juice. I commented on it and the woman growled ""I don't do cold pressed juice."" I juice at home, and know it does NOT require a cold-press to make juice that doesn't end up as sludge and pulp. You need good harp blades and screens to strain most of that out---a little bit is to be expected but not 95% pulp and sludge. 
Anyway, I threw away more than 1/2 the juice...I mean if a lame chain like Jamba Juice can make juice that's 3x better than what seemed to be a locally owned little joint, that's just sad.
Someone needs to tell the owners that the lady (manager?) they have serving customers needs either antidepressants or another job....and to strain their juice better...and add some more meat and cheese to their sandwiches.

I went in 1 hour and 10 minutes before closing. Nobody was there. After 3-4 minutes, a head appeared from the kitchen. The woman told us that she couldn't make any food because she 'just turned the grill off'. She was adamant that because she was closing soon, she couldn't do any food.

Apparently, a wrap requires a grill (news to me!) or at least, a wrap requires more than 1 hour and 10 minutes to make? I hope not!

We all left. If somebody cannot be bothered to work within the last HOUR of their shift, they obviously cannot put that effort into doing their job. Who knows what food or drink items we would end up with... Probably would have skimped on ingredients so that she could go home early.

If you want a pricely smoothie inside a pharmacy, sure, go here.

The Green Regime has been a staple to my nutrition goals for a couple of years now and I am grateful that there is a local small business where I can stop in and grab something quick and nutritious on the go M-Sat. Give it a try. I love the Chocolate Thunder and the Beach Body and my son and husband love the PB & Chocolate Thunder. Plus, I am obsessed with the greens they use here. Call ahead if you're in a big hurry.",XNTuT_gfOsRm6V5NqRWSxA,1,1,5,IVU7UP1Wo90xNqQzvL2yag

The BBQ wrap is amazing!  I ordered one yesterday!  Big chunks of chicken & avocado and I never would have put peppercinis in there but they were delicious & perfectly spicy!  Here's the best part - it was so large I put half away for today's lunch!  Be sure to stop by and let her know your tastes & dietary needs, you won't be disappointed!",tI2Z3Onpf8BurgEYhM5UEw,0,0,5,cWymPWapEQ3UpbR_jqZPJQ

Both of the employees are so friendly and energetic. It was fun to hang out with them while enjoying the smoothie. :),WxJg54qgeRuEy0omPgEcGA,1,0,5,LQoh2kivvwMbtU7R1TuwoA

From start to finish Wendy was a ton of help and had everything setup and ready to go for after the fitness class. 

I personally ordered the Vanilla smoothie and thought it was fabulous. I also tried the Tropical and the Clean Green, both were really great healthy options. What I like most about these drinks is that the sugar content is low compared to other chain smoothie shops. These drinks were FRESH and good for you. 

All of the residents gave very positive feedback about the drinks they received and were very excited to have them onsite. Will definitely use them again in the future.",EIq2M12rT7o8U2FfAXUuuQ,0,0,5,ju2E7DuubFJos6m508sAFQ

Located inside the Partell Pharmacy, the place was very clean and modern.  The service was very nice and the food was exceptional.  Our juice orders were great and the wraps and sandwiches were excellent. My buddy said the egg salad sandwich was the best he had ever had.

4913535,2018-02-16,2,9YiQ3o0EGmtojzjXdEfgeQ,"I was going on my lunch break and wanted something on the healthier side. So I figured I try the Green Regime. 
It is a little weird it is in a pharmacy place but it is quite and clean.
I ordered the Totally Tropical Fruit Blend. I'm not a big fan of oranges but it also had mangoes, bananas, flax seeds and coconut shreds and coconut water. So I thought. Why not? It is so light and refreshing! And you can barely taste the Orange! Owner said it has been a popular one. And I can see why 
For lunch I got the Chipotle Chicken Wrap. She gave me a side of a honey lime cilantro sauce. And OMG!! The wrap alone is great but add the sauce!!! Lord have mercy!! 
Definitely will be back and glad I can order in advance and then swing by and pick it up. 
They do have delivery service through grubhub and other delivery service's.",fEcLSgQkmFyy61xBYkvAhw,3,2,5,oGJAZ7fo2Mt7RVNCUBvruQ

She went above and beyond to offer me options to get my juice order just perfect, letting me sample it, & even straining the extra pulp. They use Organic Produce whenever possible. I will be back!

Not only is the person behind the counter knowledgeable and aware of the benefits from the food they offer, they also have really really great healthy options. 

From wraps to sandwiches the paired with healthy juices and smoothies - this place put together some awesome combinations of options

Eating plant based is hard sometimes, especially where not everyone have truly embraced it. The Green Regime is a great solution to that as well as I feel a heavy contender with the surrounding options. Definitely recommend this establishment for the healthier side of things in your life! 

Will be frequenting this restaurant as well it is just minutes from the business area near the airport which already is complicated if you're looking for a great lunch!",xQdMNaLHMEZEFLRM10TtIQ,2,2,5,IohrMDwpU-MMylZl6iQkkA
