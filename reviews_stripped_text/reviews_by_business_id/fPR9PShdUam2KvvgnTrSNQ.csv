191945,2016-01-05,3,fPR9PShdUam2KvvgnTrSNQ,"Starbucks has completely fallen off. I stopped going to the one on Maryland, and I was hopeful when this one was built, but this one is terrible too. I will never go to Starbucks again unless someone else is paying, and I will still complain. Because it's terrible.

Here's what pisses me off every time:
1. Tips mean absolutely nothing to anyone working there. Whether you tip $0 or tip $5 dollars the people will give you a ""THEEEENNKS,"" but never make sure they get your order right or remember that you're the guy that tips.
2. If you go through the drive-thru, they WILL forget SOMETHING. They won't ever offer a drink carrier, a drink stopper, or they will make a drink completely wrong OR they will just forget to give it to you and disappear into the store.
3. They can't get your order right...ever. I get two very simple drinks: A short vanilla latte or a treinta Green Tea Lemonade with no sweetener. The latte's shot frequently is burnt, and the green tea lemonade will have sweetener 90% of the time, or it will have tea that has been steeped way too long or will be 90% lemonade with way too much ice. Is it seriously that hard to put two ingredients in a cup for $5??????
4. They value being ""cute"" and ""friendly"" over ""just do your actual job first."" I don't need you to pretend to care about my shirt or my glasses if, after I gave a generous tip, you're just going to screw up the overpriced drink you made me.
5. If you call to make a complaint, the person will pretend to give a shit but then there will be absolutely no improvement and no one will recognize you as the incorrigible asshole that simple wants what he paid for.

Today I ordered a Trenta they gave me a Ventilator. Then to fix it they poured it in a Trenta cup and added more water. Tasted horrible. They remade it but it still doesn't taste right.

My friends & I are on holiday in Vegas for a couple weeks. We are avid Starbucks customers no matter where we travel to. Went inside about 15mins before closing hour. First off 3 people were on the clock but they all ignored us for about a minute, probably to see if we would just leave so they can close shop. A gal took our order, we purchased 3 drinks. It took all 3 employees, 15mins to make these & they made 1 drink incorrectly. During the process the 2 female employees were talking trash over the headsets while making stink faces at us.

I held up the Frappuccino so that they would see I was the one they had just helped moments before, but they continued to ignore me. 

Went in 2 days later and discussed this issue with the manager who was very professional & apologetic, especially that I had to come back to the store to have this dealt with. She made me the drink I had ordered and said she would discuss this issue with her staff.

The drink was great and I appreciated the way this was handled.",h2oX0GmQBMwwiW6oQ9dbWw,0,0,3,XSnLz__uqEXCI5gq5CFdfA

And another farther down Eastern on Desert Inn, but the drive thru configuration is a little awkward and the baristas haven't always been that friendly or helpful. BUT, this Starbucks was perfect. The barista offered different options and actually told me he would make it any way I liked. I don't think I've ever heard that at a Starbucks. I always get that feeling I'm twisting their arms. Lol I still don't like paying $6 for a grande frap, but as an occasional treat it's ok... especially if they are willing to make it just the way I like it. The drive thru was super fast and an added plus is the spacious parking lot to maneuver in.

4655201,2015-09-19,5,fPR9PShdUam2KvvgnTrSNQ,"NEWEST VEGAS STARBUCK'S OFF THE STRIP 

  My brother knows that I am a Starbuck's fan. A couple days ago he texted me that they opened a new Starbuck's at Eastern and Tropicana. Fast forward a couple of days when pumpkin spice season is kicking in the cooler weather at Starbuck's, and I was up for checking out the newest Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip.

  The newest Starbuck's off the Vegas Strip is located in the Burlington Coat Factory Shopping center. It is so new that it has that new scent you associate with a new car. The asphalt overlays a sundry of parking spaces and drive thru lane. The lobby is commodious with the airport hangar layout. Tables and seats are plentiful and include three plush chairs. Because there are zero west facing windows the annoying sundown glare ought to be nonexistent here.

  I ordered my beloved drip with pumpkin spice syrup. In my opinion, Starbuck's shines with its pumpkin spice beverage line. I don't know why they pass over offering it all year long.

  Word of mouth hasn't spread on the newest Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip. The upshot is that it is sparsely populated. The barista was friendly as she answered my questions:

Me: ""How knew is this Starbuck's? ""
Barista: ""We've only been open for a couple of weeks.""

Me: ""Are they opening any other new Starbuck's? ""
Barista: ""We are pretty saturated in this area. They just opened the Starbuck's in the Grand Bazaar Shops.""

Me: They just opened the new Starbuck's in the Grand Bazaar Shops (kind of excited)......""

  What better way to kick in a Holiday's season of drinks with a brand sparkling new Starbuck's. Holding up my cup of drip coffee with pumpkin spice coffee, I am sending an Internet  toast hoping for years of prosperity for the newest Las Vegas Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,5,5,3,kR-VsDNL_5t9-iI0SpEZ7w

The baristas that I have interacted with are friendly and efficient; however, be on the alert because they're human and can make mistakes too. Today I went to get my half off frappe for Starbucks members and almost had to pay full price until I clarified; another time I almost got the wrong order when going through the drive through but luckily noticed in time.

Love their drinks, food, merchandise, etc. we were so happy when this Starbucks opened, as its right by our church/school. The building is very pretty inside and out, and everything is working and available unlike the Starbucks on Eastern, south of this location. This alone gets three stars.

But let me now write about what gets ZERO stars. The customer service. For the first month or so, it was GREAT! Then, it was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Fast forward to last week. I got two vanilla frapachinos for my kids, one with caramel. I get this every time and have never had an issue. I pull up to the window, and I'm waiting, and waiting, and then the barista starts to make my drinks. I'm the only car in the drive-thru, so it's not busy.

As he's making them, I'm watching, and see that he makes them both without caramel. I stated caramel, and I was charged for caramel, but no biggie, it's a mistake! He eventually opens the window and starts to take my card. I say ""I'm sorry, I tried to get your attention to tell you, but one of those should have caramel."" He looks at me, slams my card on the counter, then rolls his eyes at me and sighs! REALLY??? He then slams the window shut, and angrily fixes the issue. Opens the window back up, gives me my drinks, my card, and no straws. He then realizes he didn't give me straws, hands then to me, and closes the window.  No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for the mix up"", nothing. Terrible customer service.

I tried to get his name, but we was wearing a blank name tag. So barista with the grating goatee, thanks for the less than stellar service! If I happen to be ""helped"" by you again, I'll make sure to get your name.",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,0,0,3,SxR0Js2xVts3FL6yygcbvw
