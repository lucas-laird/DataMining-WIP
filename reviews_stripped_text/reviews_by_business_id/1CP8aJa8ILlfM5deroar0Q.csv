On a visit to Las Vegas I stopped here for 10 lemon pepper wings, fries and beans.  Later that night I started feeling the chills and ended up vomiting 9 times and had multiple rounds of diarrhoea throughout the night. Was bed ridden and severely dehydrated the next day.  I hadn't eaten anything else prior to arriving at Wingstop other than some fruit. A friend I was with had also come down sick too.  I have a strong stomach but this experience really left me not wanting to come back. Buffalo Wild Wings it is!  I won't be coming back.

J'ai une excellente recette, et c'est rare que je vais en trouver des aussi bonnes ailleurs dans un restaurant.

Je n'aime pas les ailes de poussin trop cuites des Cages aux Sports; trop petites, trop cuites et les sauces ne sont pas assez goûteuses. 

Je n'aime pas plus les ailes des Buffalo Bill. 

Mais ici, chez Wingstop, les ailes sont EXCELLENTES. La qualité de la cuisson, la grosseur des ailes, le goût des sauces, j'ai ADORÉ! Tellement que s'il y en avait un proche de chez moi, je ne m'en ferais plus, j'irais chez Wingstop.

I wouldn't have had a problem with paying a nominal fee for a water cup but that wasn't even an option.  

Regarding the wings, the boneless ones had a little too much breading but were otherwise fine.  The regular wings were ok but many of them were over fried so that some areas of the chicken were rock hard.  The sauces were good - we ordered the original hot and the bbq.

The staff wasn't rude or anything but wouldn't let my 2 young boys (ages 4 and 8) share a drink.  We were told they each had to get their own.

1380591,2017-03-08,1,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"We had recently did an online order in advance to Wing Stop for the superbowl party at my friends house. Our order consisted of the 100 piece wing with 3 sides. We had varied quantities of wings for 5 different flavors, 1 seasoned fries, 1 parmesan fries, 2 veggie sticksand 1 potato salad side. 

We put in our order to be picked up at 0300P. I had arrived a bit early (maybe 0240P) and there was a line out the door. To the side, there was a rack with orders all done. Seeing another person asking for their order on the side for pick up, I did as well. I was told my order was being cooked and I needed the ID and credit (at least a picture) of the one it was ordered with. Easily accomplished as my friend sent it to me within a few minutes, before the order was complete. Showed the worker the ID and the last 4 digits of the credit card and off I went with 3 full bags of food. 

We had at least 6-8 boxes of wings with 3 trays of sides and 1 container of potato salad. Quite a lot of food. We had 8 people. Had about 20ish wings left at the end with some sides. To give an idea on how much it feeds. 

Flavors we got was mango habanero, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, original hot, Louisiana rub. Garlic parmesan and lemon pepper are two that are usually ordered. Original hot reminded me of tobacco/buffalo sauce. Louisiana had a Cajun flavor to it. Mango habanero was probably most disappointing. I don't recall it being much spicy at all. Wonder if we got the wrong one in the order... LOL o well... wings were good overall as per usual. 

The fries were soft by the time I got the order. Not sure if they were sitting in the bag sealed closed before wings were finished. They were not crispy even when I was snacking them in the car as soon as I got the order. I tried to open the bags to keep it crispy too but I guess damage was done before I even got the order. Was a bit disappointment as I usually really like the fries

Not bad overall considering it was before Superbowl. They were pretty on top of their orders. At least they weren't behind, which was good.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,3,vL5MzMevnkc_OvqlnPCUIA

1973283,2012-05-16,0,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"The fries - its all about the fries mostly. Fresh cut and still in their skin, these are long and tasty pieces of potatoes. It clearly brought me back to an East Coast boardwalk or any boardwalk where you find those fries that they stuff into a cup at like $6 for a cup, but nobody cares because they are just so darned tasty. Ok, back to the wings, I ordered a 6 piece combo deal of boneless wings in Hickory smoked BBQ sauce. These were solid white meat and crunchy on the outside which was perfect to dip into my blue cheese that surprised me with some actual chunks of the cheese floating in the dressing. Also, like that wacky soda fountain where you just push a button and you can have like 100 different choices. Fanta Orange Zero was new to me.
   Well, the reason I got those fries was because I didn't notice the giant stand up poster advertising Boneless Wings for 50 cents on Monday and Tuesday and the nice young girl at the counter never mentioned the deal either. I would have skipped those fries if I was in the know, so it turned out decent. Also, minus a star for the dude (manager?) who was wearing his hat backwards in the store and then decides to smoke his cigarette semi-close to where I was eating at 10pm at their outside tables. Although, I didn't really catch too much of the cig smell, this dude clearly shoulodn't be smoking right outside in the front. If I had seen that before I entered, it would have been a quick U-Turn.

2012470,2010-11-23,1,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"Wing Stop really is probably the best place for wings in Vegas. In fact, some of the best wings anywhere. And if I know anything, I know wings.

Wing Stop is quick, easy, and delicious. And I really have no complaints about this location.

The boneless wings seem to leave something to be desired. Same with the newer additions to their menu. Just stick to the basics. Go with the standard wings and fries.  

The original hot and cajun are my favorite flavors. Sometimes I'm feeling frisky and opt for the atomic. Even better, I order half original hot, half cajun, and get a side of the atomic sauce (yep, they will do that).

Be sure to order the wings wet. The star of the show here is the sauce. Go extra wet.

And don't forget the cheese sauce for the fries.

For me, it takes 4 things to be a great wing place:

1) The wings themselves must be of good quality. White and meaty.  *check*

2) The sauce covering the wings must be exceptionally delicious and spicy.  *check*

3) The dipping sauces must be excellent. All too often, great wings are ruined by horrible blue cheese sauce. But not here. Wing Stop has some of the best blue cheese sauce I have ever had. And the ranch is pretty good too.  *check*

4) There has to be a good side to go with the wings. And the fries at Wing Stop, especially with the cheese sauce, are well above average.  *check*

So yeah, go get some wings from here.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,6,2,4,sPeIEeIiMpmwOkXICJE73g

This location is pretty close to work, so when I am in the mood for wings I always order online and my food is ready by the time I get there. I always order at least an hour or two in advance, and just choose a 12:15 pickup time. They are usually busy, more so around lunchtime, so be prepared for a 20 minute wait if you walk in. I love the fact that you can get all drums or all flats (my choice) for a small up charge, this alone is worthy of an extra star. I hate those damn drumettes. 

I usually order the 6 piece traditional wing combo, flats only, with lemon pepper and garlic parmesan flavors. I like that you can pick up to 2 flavors, even for only 6 wings at no additional charge. The combo comes with 1 side (go with the fries), 1 dip, either ranch (bomb) or blue cheese for you mold lovers, as well as a drink for around $10.

They have less fewer flavors for the wings than BWW but the choices they offer are really great - I always go for the Orginal Hot...they are not too hot but not too mild, very flavorful and this is sauce that is finger-looking good!

Soo as I said.... be vigilant with their pricing. This is my first time ever eating from here. Wings and sauces were amazing!! Would have gotten 4 stars had first impressions been way better.

I additionally love that  Wing Stop has different flavors, although I tend to stick with the normal plain extra crispy wings with Hot Sauce on the side. My favorite thing to do as if I was making love in a very non-sexual way, but metaphorically speaking of my passion in the love of wings...is when dipping the wings in the hot sauce, then blue cheese dressing, soon after flying the wing into my mouth with every scrumptious tasteful bite and eating every meat, skin and cartilage leaving the bone spotless as if it has been hand washed with Palmolive! So orgasmic!! 

Snap! Back to earth.....the only downfall is that wings can get pricey especially when I can eat as much as Man VS. Food and devour 30 wings with no problem!!

But for some reason I just....ugh. I just don't like wings sometimes unless they're boneless (yes, that makes it worse). I'm a fraud.

Anyway...I was actually craving some last night, haha, so I went to Wingstop because Buffalo Wild Wings is too far and I'm lazy. I'll have you know that we got half bone-in, half boneless and I loved both equally. If you're into spice but don't want to die, I recommend the original hot and if you're like me and need to feel that sting in your eyes where you're trying not to cry or that sudden burn on your tongue that makes you feel like you're free-falling, then try the Mango Habanero; it's the second-hottest flavor they have. :)

Aside from the great wings - they have the most amazing fries. What's weird is that I've had the fries before but I don't remember them ever being this good. They were cooked just right, had the perfect amount of seasoning, and - correct me if I'm wrong - I'm pretty sure I tasted sugar. Sugar and salt?! Marry me, Fries.

Last but not least - did you know that the food is BROUGHT to your table rather than you having to go get it yourself when it's ready? We sat outside and I was worried we wouldn't hear when our order was up and suddenly this magical creature came bearing the gifts that were my wings and fries.

We ordered delivery tonight from the Wingstop App. After it arrived and we began eating, we realized half our order was missing. An order of fries, veggie sticks, and two brownies were missing! I first text the driver from the delivery service they used. He said he gave us everything he was given. So I proceed to call Wingstop about the issue. They said they would send the rest of the order back out. A minute later we get a call from Josie saying our options are 1) credit for future use, 2) we can come in for the rest of our order (since they used a third party delivery service they couldn't send another driver), 3) if we wanted a refund for what we didn't receive we would also have to drive there for it (since the transaction was done on the app). 

So a customer who orders delivery from the Wingstop app, doesn't receive half the order and has to either wait until the next time they want Wingstop or drive all the way there for the rest of the order, or even for just a refund. What exactly is the convenience of using the app? In my opinion the manager should have covered the delivery service fee, as it was their mistake, to keep the customer happy.

When it comes to getting wings in our area, there are a few options so we originally started out trying a few different places. Wingstop at Trop and Decatur is the first corporate owned stor to open in Vegas and is obviously the most seasoned when it comes to food quality. Because there is a franchisor in Las Vegas, I always make it a point to ask whenever I go if the store I'm visiting is a corporate store or a franchise store. This is what ive gotten:

Trop and Decatur is 5 star!
Rainbow and Srping Mtn is also bomb.
Craig and Simmons is Bomb..
Nellis and Stuart is Bomb..
Maryland and Flamingo is also.. you guessed it. Bomb. 

The thing these all have in common is that they are all Corporate stores.

So Joseline walks slowly over to me and hands them over in a rude way.. doesnt even acknowledge me.. shes looking the other way and doesnt say anything like ""hey sorry about that"" or ""here you go"" I work in the food industry and i try not to give out bad reviews, i also try not to be ""that customer"" but cmon.

3212164,2010-11-03,3,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"I need to start by saying I eat boneless wings almost every chance I get because in my head I justify them as being healthy and ""low carb"" with complete disregard for the breading. Wing Stop is stellar for several different reasons. Especially this specific location.

For one thing, they get your name when u are ordering and they actually use it again for personal touch. LOVE this. Secondly the wings.......served hot, cripsy and fast! The flavor of the BBQ sauce is a love affair in my mouth of sweet, brown sugar and smokey mesquite goodness. I cannot recomment the BBQ with ranch dipping sauce enough. Now, the Pamesan Garlic didn't do it for me. This still did not stop me from stuffing them in my face, but just not as sexy as the BBQ.

The food is delicious and the staff is on point with the service by making me feel welcomed from the moment I walked in until I left. The only reason why they are not getting a five star is because I still think Wingstop is a bit pricey. Here's a tip though. On Monday and Tuesday they do offer .50 cent boneless wings.......

I ordered to go and my fiancé picked it up. He said the woman was very polite and the transaction was easy. Our order was correct, so far winning on all fronts as last time I went to Buffalo Wild Wings we waited forever for our to go order and it was wrong TWICE. Anyway-
I ordered 8 wings, half mango habanero, half Louisiana dry rub, an a side of coleslaw. My fiancé ordered the tenders with atomic sauce, fries, and cheese sauce. 
The wings I had were AMAZING! Just crispy enough. The dry rub was so tasty, wjayeb spice combo was used scratched my itch perfectly. The mango habanero was sweet and had a great heat to it. Much better than BWW mango habanero. The coleslaw was dry (in a good way! I hate coleslaw drowning in sauce). It was refreshing and a great way to cool down my mouth after the habanero. 
I ate some of my fiancé's cheese fries and the cheese sauce was delicious as well. The fries are fresh cut and soft, the way I like them.

Whatever it is, I dig.

The good thing about Wing Stop is that they all make the same delicious wings, from taste to texture.  I have not found a soggy wing yet...and hopefully will never!!!

So after my first let down I told Vanessa that they need to make me the best wings to make up for it and boy did they deliver.

I went with the 10 piece combo, boneless. I was allowed to choose 2 wing flavors, I went with Original and BBQ. The combo also came with fries, which I decided to swap out for potato salad. I also got a side of ranch dressing and a soda for $6.99.

The order was ready when the employee said it would be, that is a plus. When we got the food back to the office, the first thing I noticed was the lack of any kind of marking on the outside of the containers. All three had to be opened to see which was which. 

I've had better wings. And potato salad for that matter. Maybe I would have been happier with other flavors? The original was fine, had a kick to it but not too hot. The BBQ is also fine, a little sweet, but I personally prefer a bit more tang to my BBQ sauce. I tried some of the fries my co-worker got and definitely regretted making the swap for potato salad.

They have a new soda machine which is amazing.  It's one of those coke machines with the touchscreen and hundreds of combinations of drinks.  Gotta love that.  Except when the old people who don't like technology take their sweet time trying to figure it all out.

The fries are amazing, though I should admit they aren't most peoples style.  They are quite limp (but not soggy).  They have a good thickness which allows you to actually taste the potato.  They salt the hell out of them so make sure you order without salt though.

The ranch dressing here is also awesome.  It's thin without being watery.  Normally I like a thick ranch, but wingstop manages to make a thin sauce that's really perfect for dipping.

The wings (boneless and strips) themselves are about average.  They do have some good sauces though (If doing boneless, I recommend ordering the sauce on the side for dipping).

I had both the Hawaiian and the Lemon Pepper options and they were both seriously so good. The Hawaiian was a sweet and sour sauce that was of notable quality, while the lemon pepper was a dry rub over butter and it tasted amazing in a whole different kind of way. I seriously got away with 10 wings for $6. Can't beat that.

We then proceeded to wait 15 minutes, before my boyfriend went up to the counter to see how much longer it would be...the employees were so busy chatting amongst themselves that they didn't care to check that our order had been ready to go, next to multiple to go bags. We saw many people getting their food before ours that came in way after us.

4814670,2012-11-25,0,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"Heard about Wing Stop from my sister due to the special on Monday and Tuesday.

If you are looking for take-out, be sure to call in 15-20 minutes in advance or you may have to wait.
Though the advertisement said it was 50 cent boneless, the store has upped the price to 60 cents per wing for some time which is still cheaper than normal price. 

Tried the bone-in classic and I personally found them better than the boneless wings at Wing Stop due to the salty-ness. When the wings were boneless, the seasoning was a little too salty for me compared to the bone-in classic.

Tried the atomic, and it isn't as spicy as I thought. Both the atomic (spiciest at Wing Stop) and Cajun (their main flavor) were both spicy to the tongue, however, tolerable if you are into spicy foods. Do not try if you are not into spicy food. However, if you are, these are definitely ones to try. Both to me seemed to taste fairly similar except for that Atomic had cracked pepper in the spicy rub. 

If you are not into spicy, tried some of the classic bone-in wing with Lemon Pepper, and those were addicting. It is something to try, recommend it.

Wing size compared to other places I've been to, are bigger, which is good if you like it with a little more meat. 

Overall, good place, near where I live, and though they do get busy on special days, so be sure to call in beforehand!",UX80mE44b-ObNif3cXRtGg,1,1,4,suH4L08gNMANuwdcMoWTlQ

Hmm Wing stop... I wonder if they have good wings?

You bet your wing loving ass they do!

I really like spicy but my significant other doesn't, ugh if they don't have something for her/him this isn't going to work.

Of course they do Dumbo... You just throw down some Cajun or Atomic Wings and let your less spicy less interesting other half toss down some garlic Parmesan or lemon pepper wings.

The question is.... Ranch or Blue Cheese?

Sorry, I never said I would answer all of your questions, I truly despise blue cheese so your on your own here.

Boneless or bone in??

Considering a boneless wing is really not a wing at all I personally stick to the true wings and go for bone in. But for all you, "" Oh i really want wings/Chicken Nuggets"" People out there, I would assume the boneless would do the trick.

Lets just stop playing this 50 Questions game, stop being a sissy and go pick up a 20 count 1/2 Cajun 1/2 Atomic bone in wings and fries. Ready GO!!!

5918641,2014-11-26,7,1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q,"I went to bed late the night before, and still woke up at 6:30am. I don't even actively day trade stocks right now, so that was annoying.  

In spite of the less than stellar start to the day, my favorite Asian agreed to meet me for lunch and I offered her a choice between wings or ramen.  Deep down I knew she was gonna pick chicken wings, but nearly every fiber of my being was hoping she would surprise me again and go for ramen.  It was barely in the mid 50s at the time we were exchanging texts, negotiating my term of unconditional something or other.  While she casually mentioned that she wasn't at home but was at one of the mid-tier Strip hotel.  Okay, maybe the guy spent all his budget on 12 Blue Moon and 8 Red Bull (sugar free), plus the room and there was nothing left for brunch. Whatever the case, he is off to ride back to his crib on the West side or Cali or wherever.  A lot of weeds to whack to get the girl, that's just the reality and the struggle.

Anyway, I will skip the tangential details and get straight down to the business of reviewing my very first ever Wingstop experience.  As you are probably already aware, there are multiple Wingstop locations dotted throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Most locations open at 11am, but this location on Tropicana wins the early bird prize by opening at 9am.  

The simple menu is the same, as far as I can tell, across all locations.  You basically have wings (classic bone-in and boneless) and crispy chicken tenders to select from, with 11 wing flavors and whatever limited time promo they are offering.  The dipping sauces (ranch, honey mustard, blue cheese and spicy chipotle) are extra, unless you order their combos or family packs. Their fries are actually not bad, and a large is really more than enough.

Service is swift and professional. But your order will still take up to 18 minutes, which the cashier will inform you as you place your order.  So call ahead or be prepared to wait.

The wings was just okay, because my wings were on the overcooked side, and not really moist and juicy.  The Cajun sauce was spicy, but tolerable, but eat a lot and the heat will build up and surely burn you later.  Lemon Pepper was good, but damn was it salty.  Hawaiian was decent, with mild sweetness and no heat.  You also have the option to ask for your wings to be served ""wet"".

Overall, the food was okay (3 stars).  Spending time catching up over a bunch of fried chicken wings with my fav Asian, talking about random stuff made the Wingstop excursion well worth the price of a 24 piece family pack (which was surprisingly heavy - pretty sure it is enough to split with 4 people with normal appetite).  I would do it again if she still wants wings.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,6,3,LwpaBwOZQaC43LA0qG3Cbw

Go on Tuesdays or Wednesdays and they have 50 cent wings. Why do I always end up there on a Thursday or Monday, though. Grrr.

They don't have nearly the variety of a Buffalo Wild Wings, but they are pretty inexpensive so that's a plus.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,3,O1WMJ07XnUwORu3toSqNZA
