I was worried about how fast the food got to me, usually would mean that it was prepared earlier and just reheated. If it was I would not be able to tell the difference. price to portion ratio is good as well. The only issue I came across had to do with the environment. I think it's warmer outside than in. It's December 30th! Also their music that plays overhead is not censored, some foul language is not favorable especially if I had my children with me. Good news is they deliver, I can control that at my house.",hM1fZDBLLmDm5xELTOnoMA,1,0,4,dNcJBDAuCu7vj2hbRTzVTQ

Ordered Pork LoMein (chow mein as they call it) Pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, Szechuan chicken, egg drop soup and egg rolls. EVERYTHING tastes like fish. It's super greasy and my family of 5 won't eat it. $75 In the trash.  Took forever to be delivered and so not worth the 70 mins it took. Granted Busy Saturday night, but still...

352200,2016-07-31,0,lUSAupdaVSoEaUO63RdPZA,"Most of my Chinese food experiences in Vegas have been ""just ok,"" so I wanted to try something new.  After reading several on-line reviews, I ordered food from Yummy China (ordered to-go), and was pleasantly surprised.  The server was friendly and efficient; the food was ready when I arrived; the food was packed so it remained hot for awhile after bringing it home; and most importantly, the food was good.

The order consisted of the Pu Pu Platter (I didn't care for the wrapped chicken), but everything else was very tasty; Mongolian Beef (which had more slices of bell pepper than I'm use to); Shrimp fried rice (with very large shrimps).  Everything tasted good, even the leftovers the next day (which I just finished).  Based on my first experience, I will definitely return, but would like to dine in next time to try their Hot and Sour soup, and other delectables.  

The restaurant is a bit tucked away in the strip mall, so if you're not familiar with the area, just look for the Albertson's off of W. Ann Rd and 95 and you'll find it.",lz1L9P6FBejDM8lN2Q-ENA,0,0,4,9Q8jB7y-05JmqdIAtvu59A
439165,2017-02-07,1,lUSAupdaVSoEaUO63RdPZA,"Let's just start this review off by saying when my boyfriend said he wanted Chinese food for dinner I WAS NOT THRILLED I have not found any Chinese restaurants In the immediate centennial area with food I would even consider edible. Dreading a stomach ache I started looking online and came across this gem

Came here a little over a week ago. Placed a order online and was given a 10 min pickup window. I arrived promptly at the beginning of the 10 min pickup window expecting a short wait. 

Service was astonishing. I have not been to a Asian restaurant with such friendly staff In a very long time. They girl working the counter was super nice and apologized profusely that my order was not ready when I arrived. 

We ordered BBQ ribs, cashew chicken and honey walnut shrimp. Everything was amazing. Flavorful and no complaints on anything. The BBQ ribs could have used more sauce but I like extra sauce on everything so I'll be sure to ask for more next time. 

In conclusion I finally have found a Chinese restaurant In the area I'm not afraid to eat at. No stomach ache and we even ate left overs the next day. 

Their name definitely describes this place well YUMMY!",vdonohFxZLeq5VAjmAj1tw,2,1,5,90VW_oX_p0NMfnN4UnWT6w

The delivery service is fine, but the food quality is just not good. Everything is coated in tons of oil, and has a really fake taste. You can tell cheap ingredients are used.

The restaurant looks like an older run down place serving up Americanized Chinese food. The whole time I was sitting inside and reading the menu I felt unsure if I really wanted to eat here but I told myself I should at least try it since I was there. I ordered a beef chow fun to go since it's kind of hard to mess that dish up so I figured I was safe.
 
When my order was ready it was handed to be in a bag where I noticed they didn't provide utensils or chopsticks but I was too lazy to go back in since I was already in the car. Strike 1. When I opened the box I noticed that the portions were way smaller than most other Chinese places while they are charging a full entree price ($8.50-10.00)  for everything including the beef chow fun. Strike 2. The beef was fully cooked but had a weird taste to it and the dish overall just seemed bland. Strike 3. 

I would not recommend this place at all and even Panda Express would be a better choice since their food has more flavor. This place also has a $20 card minimum so bring cash if you're not going to be spending over 20 bucks, which I'm sure is not hard to do here.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,2,U5EjBMYSVFix078bi9ikbw

This is a nice sit down restaurant with take out like most Chinese places inside an Albertson's shopping center.  Seems like a lot of locals come here when you are in the area but not really something to go out of your way for specifically.

They have a nice lunch special that is reasonable for it's cost although and here is the bad part.  They are extremely Americanized Chinese heavy on the Chop Suey.

I was observing her childish behavior while trying to enjoy lunch with my parents today. She was yelling and demanding free items and threatening the manager to go somewhere else that gives her free things down the street (she was only ordering three things and an appetizer). The manager agreed to give her something free and she still wasn't happy.  She then accused the manager of charging her too much and was talking to him like a three year old. The male that was with her said nothing and did nothing but stare at her causing a scene. What a pansy! 

This place is great! 

The food is delicious, the service is great, and the lunch special is a lot of food for a cheap price! ($5-7). It's even available on weekends until 4pm.

The place is very clean, despite the sort of tacky turquoise casino theme on the booths. 

I come here often with my mom and we always order the Kung pao chicken and the cashew chicken lunch specials. I order the cashew chicken spicy or ask for the chile sauce on the side. The hot and sour soup and egg drop soup are both delicious, but are a bit thick (gelatinous), most likely from a cornstarch thickener or whatever they use.  The lunch special entrees are about half protein and half vegetables (which I like), and the Mongolian beef is just beef, white onions, and scallions. All lunch specials come with fried rice or chow mein, a cup of egg flower or hot and sour soup, and a spring roll.

I asked him about it and he stated that"" he doesn't believe Yummy China has them.""  Very unprofessional.",knst3K5kSWNFhUYNY1jqEA,0,0,1,chrM72jGK5bzfzTNOFrU0A

My only problems were is that in all the chicken dishes we got mostly dried out pieces. The honey walnut shrimp was very good and still crispy and the pork chow mien had generous cuts if pork. The portions were more than enough and good for the price.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,1,3,pjIANDbFXSK0jTIsZtpW4g

Unless you are from China or have lived in a legit Chine Town, like in N.Y., Chicago, or San Fran, then you will enjoy what they have to offer.

I can say that the food was excellent, from the hot and sour soup to the eggroll, and everything in-between.

Also ordered 'Fried Dumplings' - all was for Take Out.  These too, were the worst I have ever been served anywhere in this world.

All was flushed down the garbage disposal - unedible.

I can not imagine how any Chinese restaurant can be so  bad.

At $15, this was an lesson well worth learning! Avoid at all costs!",vOI8EqgsLSIjlrCUiJATRw,3,1,1,lRMEAI-McErwtte0-PD_Qg

The honey lemon shrimp is a masterpiece and the Mongolian beef to die for. Best noodles and fried rice around and if you love garlic chicken you will be in heaven!!!

5777967,2017-09-28,0,lUSAupdaVSoEaUO63RdPZA,"Received a flyer from this Chinese restaurant that has changed owners so we thought that we would try.  Ordered 1 lg. Wonton soup, 1 lg. hot & sour soup, teriyaki chicken on a stick (6) pcs., 1 order of pan fried dumplings (6), 2 combination appetizer platters & combo fried rice. Each platter includes 2 egg rolls, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 paper wrapped chicken & 2 chicken teriyaki on a stick. The Wonton soup had nice broth w/nice dumplings. Hot & Sour soup's broth tasted ok, needed a little bit of the hot but vegetables and egg helped the dish for balance. The teriyaki chicken on a stick were pink? But, very tender and for being pink, had the teriyaki taste to the meat. The combination platters definitely was not happy! Egg Rolls were very greasy, paper wrapped chicken looked like ground ?, crab Rangoon; could taste the cream cheese but not the crab meat and did not get the fried shrimp or the 2 chicken teriyaki sticks for each combo platter! We instead received 2 onion rings? I called the restaurant and explained to them that we were short the shrimp and she said what I thought were onion rings were the shrimp? I tried to tell her that they weren't fried shrimp and she continued to say that's how they make their fried shrimp (round)? The only dish that we enjoyed was the combo fried rice which they cooked fresh while waiting for our order. I try to be fair when doing my reviews and really hope that these new owners will realize that arguing with a customer that their fried shrimp is actually onion rings which the person I talked to kept on saying that they make their shrimp round and definitely were onion rings! Plus, their menu on Yelp is from previous owners and they need to put their menu because is different from the Internet menu.",i4eQXKpWn7E-SU0wDAHEMA,0,1,2,RBqTWWVcBSGEfs2ntpWs-g
