I enjoyed the brown rice bowl, and I never knew rice could have so much flavor! It was amazing to see how the chefs could find new and bright favors to add to their food. The green goddess salad was also delicious, and it was probably one of the best salads that I have ever had! My son, who is 15, also enjoyed the food, which is great because I can never get him to eat healthy foods, so I have found the place which I can get him to eat better! The vibe of the entire restaurant was so fun and happy, and expertly designed! It was one of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to! I will be returning to Panacea very soon, and I am so excited to see the new things they add to the menu!",-bcJeA7y3ryM-P7_R6bZrg,2,0,5,U5DxR2mGCNxs2ubRe1BQEw

616658,2017-09-14,0,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"I have been here 7-8 times in the past 6 months. I fell in love with the Ultimate Burger. It is one of the best burgers I've ever had and definitely the best vegan burger. I have also tried the umami spinach noodles and the Buffalo cauliflower. The food is always delicious. 

My gripe is that the kitchen seems to be inconsistent, because nothing ever tastes the same as the last time. When I first came, the ultimate burger was almost perfect except that the patty falls apart and it can get messy. I think this may have been brought to their attention because the next few times the party was coated in toasted quinoa, making it more nutty but a little more dry. Sometimes the cheese is melted, sometimes not so much. Sometimes too little condiments. 
They are also quite pricey but im a returning customer because the food tastes fresh, the flavors are great, and the atmosphere is beautiful.",DVu1Bk8-o5OF-xtCCXFvcQ,0,0,4,jdtXy6MsYehO9-SPq-0DWA
626868,2017-05-09,0,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"Panacea's is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene. The menu is well planned and offers a variety of dishes, drinks and desserts.  Talking to the management, they  also support the total wellness aspect of ""living"" (in the future will host webinars re healthy living).  Prices are in line with the ingredients they are using.  I talked to the chef and am thrilled that they buy  many ingredients from organic farmers and suppliers from around the world.   My wife and I ordered the kale green salad and really recommend the rutabaga and  jerusalem artichoke dish. The double patty hamburger is excellent with a blend of many ingredients and no soy.  It is juicy, well done and truly tastes like a very good beef burger (not the usual soy patty served at other restaurants).  For dessert we shared a chocolate chip cookie and several matcha and pistachio balls. I predict that Panacea will become a destination restaurant for all of Las Vegas Valley. As  their reputation expands they will attract out of town guests.  My wife and I are from  San Francisco and very familiar with the healthy eating boutique restaurants. We can say that if Panacea opened in the Bay Area or Napa wine country it would be a ""hit"". We look forward to make Panacea a regular  part of our dining out experience.

I was asked for extras like cheese and fries, I said yes. Turns out, you now don't GET the salad...first time I have seen what is 'built' into the price point of a dish get removed from the offer table even though you are paying more for fries. And no, sorry the sweet potato fries were not Soooo amazing that they outweigh the value of the small salad. Nobody likes to feel Nickel and dimed when they dine!

I came in here a few days ago but just remembered I wanted to write a review.

First off, this place is expensive. Like...pretty expensive. Paid $12.99 for a salad of just a handful of things.  I could have went to Whole Foods and gotten over a pound of a salad and  paid less. It was the 118 salad. The dressing was tasty but it was burning my lips and mouth to the point where I almost didn't want to eat it, but I did. It was good but not worth the money considering it was very skimpy. Says it comes with crispy quinoa and has literally just a few grains of it sprinkled over the top. I'm really upset because I really wanted to enjoy this place but I don't think I'll ever come back unless someone else is paying (lol)

The inside was cute, the customer service was eh. I could have went to Panera bread and gotten an entire meal for the price and would have been filled up. I ate this salad and was still hungry, and I don't usually eat much.

I really wished I liked this place and if you wanna try it by all means go! But keep in mind that you will be paying a lot if you want to be satisfied/full.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,7,4,2,7uV0G5_BqGSnSTsK-73uaQ

I did expect more of a sit down restaurant type place but it wasn't exactly that. You approach the cashier where there is a menu and a very helpful employee ready to answer any questions. We told her it was our first time there and she politely and patiently took her time explaining the most popular items. 

+ Food is delicious and all made from scratch
+ Every single employee there is super helpful and kind
+ Food didn't take long to come out 
+ Love this location, since it's in the heart of Summerlin

- Water is self-served, so every refill you get yourself
- A server never checks on you throughout your time there  
- Seating isn't super comfortable
- Expensive compared to most other nice vegan cafe's 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place especially to try at least once. Since I live in Henderson I probably won't make this one of my regular go-to places since it's kind of a hike and Vegenation just opened up next to me.",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,0,0,4,6PGirkwZndL1IcRVAm69oA

A food runner drops it at your table. And get your own silverware by the way. So just to back track a smudge... upon walking into the place there were people standing in front of the register. Thought they were customers. They weren't. They may have been mgmt. but no one greeted us. It almost felt intrusive walking in. We asked a question about what was in the burrito to the guy at the counter.. and he answered. And that was the end of the conversation. There wasn't much customer service basically. No help with the menu which they are still working on.. it's kinda a skeleton menu. No welcome upon entry... no excitement that they had people in their restaurant (it was empty). After we got our food a girl came by to ask how it was.. we literally had the food in front of us for like 2.5 seconds and hadn't even picked up our forks. And then no one ever came back by to actually see how the food was. After getting a take away container we cleaned up our space and left. And there was no ""thanks for coming in"" or anything like that. I don't know if I would be back regularly or if at all honestly. I would give the food a 3 cause of price...but the service a 2.

1694635,2017-04-15,2,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"THIS PLACE IS OWNED/OPERATED BY A BUNCHA GD HIPPIES

And that's quite alright, a blessing in fact, because this troupe isn't the stereotyped dirty, aloof ilk. They're clean cut, have refined taste and exacting standards, and are a long-anticipated welcome to an otherwise depressing salad/vegetarian scene in Las Vegas. They're reinventing vegetarian casual dining on their own terms, and reintroducing us commoners to what it means to be a Modern Hippy. 

""But Kevin, isn't a salad just a salad?"" 

NO. 
Well, once upon a time, it was. No longer. Your salads at Panacea will be fine crafted works of art. That is no exaggeration, a precise portrayal. 
Someone frame this before I fork it up. 
The photos we're posting from our luncheon aren't exceptions; they are the rule. My Cracked Freekeh salad was, no joke, the best salad I've had (and I hate superlatives). I'm a sucker for kalamata olives, and that tapenade warmed that chilled vege side of my Vegas heart. The roasted elements? Perfect char that didn't dominate the flavor, only accentuating it. And them roasted red peppers! 

You'll notice the salads' featured elements adorn their own private space in the bowls and on the plates. The aesthetics of this operation are primo, and the palate affect is that you get to taste each of the featured items in your particular dish, while also being free to mix&match those flavors per your prerogative. Get creative! Engage your salad!

For my drink, I had a looseleaf green tea, with a saucer of honey on the side to sweeten. Clean, perfect. I have wished for a looseleaf tea spot since moving to Vegas a year ago. And soon they'll carry pu-erh, my go-to tea favorite. 

This is day 1 of their official opening. There are some kinks to work out, as it took a half hour for my salad to arrive, music was a touch loud for conversation, and the dude serving tea at the front was chatting on his cell instead of engaging customers. BUT, the chef was making the rounds and visited our table to see how we were enjoying. Maximum enjoyment. And the delay on my salad? The owner made good on the delay, which was much appreciated. 

Atmosphere and upstairs: comfortable, accommodating. 
Service: a little flustered for having so few people in house, but they're stressed from opening, I'm sure, and things will work out in a week or two. 
Smoothies: had the Divine Feminine, and she was in fact. Healthy, not heavy, not saccharine sweet. The fruit alone was the sweetener with no trashy extras thrown in. Win. 

Definitely will be back, and will definitely recommend to health-minded people looking for a serious upgrade to the garbage vege fast-food chain places in the area (you know who you are, places). Very satisfied with everything had.  Victory!",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,10,5,4,Hrzk1Hj9O4Sgus4XHELQBQ

1710718,2017-05-08,0,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"FINALLY, a health conscious vegan spot in Summerlin! The anticipation for this place was intense and all of the hype over Panacea had my expectations pretty high. I've been following Panacea's Instagram for several months preceding the opening and every time I saw a post I'd get giddy. 
Well, today was the day! I finally convinced my omnivorous boyfriend to come with me and try it out. 

Pros: 
1. Food is freakin' ridiculously good. I had the veggie burger and my boyfriend had one of the rice bowls. My burger was SCRUMPTIOUS! The best vegan burger of my life. Boyfriend was amazed by his rice bowl and even went as far to say that he would go vegan if I could make him that every day. :o 
Oh guess I need to learn how to cook!!

Moving on,
I also had the vegan hostess cupcake for dessert and that... that was divine. They should sell entire full sized hostess cakes for they are that yummy. 
The rest of the menu items looked great and I hope to come in again and try more! 

2. Decor is so cute, and the owl mural is even more gorgeous in person. There's even some locally made crystal jewelry for sale as well as some goodies from Herbally grounded. 

3. Service was fast, friendly, and accommodating. 

Cons:
1. As others have mentioned, this place is expensive. All 3 items came out to a little over $40. Now, with that said, it is obvious that there is a certain level of culinary artistry going into these recipes-a kind of artistry that will require GREAT ingredients that sequentially mean more expensive dishes. Not a huge con, but it's worth mentioning.


In conclusion, I loved this place! So many things I didn't try though! A mocktail is definitely a must for next time.

Of their ""green bowls"", I've had the 118* Chopped Salad ($12) with all the vegetables in the house in a delicious warm shallot thyme vin dressing. It's super fresh with tons of textures!
Their Cracked Freekeh and 8 Grain Rice ""grain bowls"" are more filling, but also full of fun flavor pairings. The curry-tinged beet puree is especially enjoyable. 
I'm less into smoothies, and the Divine Femininity was nicely light and floral with rose water but thinner than I personally prefer my blended beverages.

We had the burger and nachos. Too much on the fermented purple cabbage/onion or whatever that was in both Love Burger and Nachos, but delicious overall. Didn't have a decaf coffee - that's a minus. Be sure to provide a decaf for pregnant women and those not wanting caffeine. Then we decided to get 2 cupcakes at the counter. They didn't have a plate to put cupcakes on (!!!), so we waited for like 10 minutes for the other girl to come out with a plate (and somebody else's order from the kitchen), and we carried our dessert back upstairs where we were sitting. Our dirty plates from nachos and burger were still all over the table, so we had to move them ourselves and try and enjoy the cupcakes. So while we were waiting for the plate to put out cupcakes on, that's when I saw her put conventional grapes in the so-called organic smoothies. She said that they don't always use organic ingredients in this ""organic"" eatery... I asked her if they at least avoid genetically modified organisms in this ""organic"" eatery, and she looked at me and tells me she has no idea how the ingredients are sourced. WELL, damn it, then don't call yourself organic. OR better yet, train your staff and communicate to it such basic information as the standards for the ingredients you use. Needless to say, ANYTHING that's made in the blender where pesticides covered conventional stuff is being blended cannot be called organic. So, Panacea, please, either commit to honest food standards and labels, or spare us the bs. We drove there FOR organic vegan food; not some lack of transparency about what we put in our bodies. Our lousy government is already doing enough of that; I don't drive to a so-called organic vegan restaurant for more food scam.",toa0118ENh3DtwOqpuAGSg,0,0,3,N8yjELRTvEnUf9nCtlwp3A

Back to Panacea. It's kind of a hybrid between fast food and a sit down restaurant. Lots of choices, from smoothies to burgers (vegan), to veggie concoctions. The price point is a little high, but when you're getting all that organic and vegan goodness, it's to be expected. 

The smoothies are really tasty, large sized, and filling! I'd seen complaints about portion sizes, but I didn't find them to be small at all. The sweet potato fries were fantastic, and I got quite a lot of them. And yeah, that Osaka burger is legit! I just had a few bites of my friend's, but man! Juicy and actually ""meaty"" tasting.

Its kinda discouraging to go somewhere several times and each time the item you quest is unavailable. Also you can make a veggie burger w/ fries just as good at home for way less than the $18 dollars i paid for other night. The last and Biggest problem with this place is that you have to be a child to request something off the kids menu which makes no sense.... why restrict customers and put something in front of them they can even have? all you're doing is missing out on profit when someone decides to get nothing instead of picking something off the more expensive menu after having all their requests denied. None of the adult shakes or smoothies looked good so I decided not to get one. And after being told that i just decided this place was not worth the money or trip. Telling a customer they cant order a small berry smoothie because they aren't under 12 and letting them walk away without getting anything at all is bad for business in my opinion and just a silly policy in general. One could just simply lie and say they're child is sitting outside.

I am an experienced yoga instructor exposed to a lot of elitist attitudes in the vegan/conscious health community (those ""my life is better than yours, you should be like I am"" demeanors), and by their Instagram/Facebook posts I got the impression that this place worked against that type of pretentious egocentrism, and possibly offered an open space for all walks of life, but we found ourselves on the defense when attempting to rearrange a menu item because of some food allergies. It took a lot of patience to bypass the cashier's judgmental/condescending tone and demeanor to calmly explain and complete our order. If they drop the heavy opinions, downward eyes, and let the ingredients do the talking, Summerlin AND Vegas, have a true winner within them.

Highlights were roasted sunchoke and rutabaga with smoked paprika aioli, great to see veg dishes that are not pretending to be something they are not. Ginger kombucha on tap was great, green tea also pretty good. Hummus was fresh and yummy, mild in the seasoning dept but good value and portioning.

We had the Love Burger, Garden Nachos, Cauliflower Buffalo bites and Trilogy Kombucha.

Panacea has some great bowls... They start with grains that have a strong protein to carb ratio, include a bunch of fresh veggies, and finish things off with wonderfully tasting sauces or dressings. But the bowls aren't even the tastiest thing I've had here. I'm also a fan of their burgers. In fact, I had to come back recently because I found myself craving their Osaka Burger. I even came in once with a friend that said this was one of the better burgers they have had, and the first vegan burger they have ever truly enjoyed!

My axe-to-grind concerns the portion sizes. My love and I recently spent $45 (including tip) on a couple of burgers with add-ons for lunch...no appetizers, no drinks, certainly not any smoothies, and we both found ourselves hungry a couple hours later. In fact, all three times I've been here, I had issues with the portion sizes comparable to the price of the meal. We certainly don't mind spending money on quality food, but the blatant marring of experience concerning the value (or lack there of) of the meal is the not only the only thing holding them back from 5 stars, but also the only thing that will keep me from coming back anytime soon.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,38,30,4,OEOOWvMngnuwvvErMjAIMQ

I had been following this place for a while now on Instagram and also another person on Instagram who raves about this place. Since I've been transitioning to a more plant based diet, I have been searching around town for some good plant based food, and I think I finally found it! 

I came here with my kids spontaneously just to try it out. So I ended up ordering 
- 2 lemon sugar cookies
- Sweet Berry Smoothie
- Banten Honey Oolong Tea
- Love Burger with Vegan Cheese

Now the kids liked the flavor of the lemon cookies, however they were a bit too hard on their little teeth. The sweet berry smoothie was delicious! The kids loved it. I enjoyed my Tea, however I prefer it to be a bit more sweet, just my preference. And as far as the burger, I ordered the love burger, but received the Ultimate Burger instead. Not a problem for me, the more the merrier. Especially since I was sharing the burger with my kids. I asked the server for a side of Sriracha. Now let me just say, that burger was the BEST plant Based burger I have ever ate. Like ever! The texture was so on point and it was super moist and flavorful. I didn't even need the Sriracha Sauce honestly. It was really just that good. I could literally eat it every single day.  I will definitely be going back for the burger for sure!


Now you guys are probably wondering why I gave this place a 4 star rating. Well as much as I would love to give this place 5 stars I just can't because of the service. The staff was super friendly, however service was extremely slow. I received my burger over 25 minutes after I placed and paid for my order. I felt like they had forgotten about my burger at one point. I ended up taking my things from my table and going down to one of the tables on the lower level just so I could be seen.  I also felt like the staff was still learning the menu and the placing of things. And I got the ultimate burger rather than what I ordered which was the love burger. Now I really don't mind about getting the wrong burger, because I was beyond satisfied with it. However there was only one other customer in the entire restaurant during the time I placed my order, so I honestly don't understand how they could get the order wrong. And I don't understand how they took so long to give me my burger either, given that there was basically no one there. 

Now I know this spot is rather new, so that is expected. I will definitely be returning soon and recommending it to others. Can't wait to give this place a 5 star rating!",4kBDBcr6sPe2sPkK7ibgtw,1,2,4,_19gLkuLFB_fj7q47cH5Cg

Aside from that, everything else was lacking flavor or actually not even in the dish. As I sat there eating the flavorless dish, I was thinking that there were other ingredients missing. I looked on their menu and actually three other ingredients were missing. So I paid $15 for something that didn't have any appealing taste and was half of what it should have been?

I hope they last and keep business going because the food was really good albeit pricey for what it is. The burger was really good and has that smokey flavor one looks for in a burger. $1.00 upcharge for cheese, $2 for fries. I can see why people are upset over the prices. Ten dollars for a smoothie is ridiculous I don't care what's inside. No smoothie is that expensive to make. We ordered the sprouts and got the cauliflower instead due to the cashiers mistake. I'm surprised at the way the issue was handled. Usually in Vegas, especially the restaurant industry, if a mistake is made the customer either gets their money back OR you bring out the correct item which is what we would have preferred but it never happened. We asked for a small side of sprouts and were told they'd be out and after waiting 25 minutes for them we decided to leave.

3875550,2017-08-04,2,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"A NON BIASED REVIEW: Had great food & service the first time, and just terrible food & service the second time, especially for Cheesecake Factory like pricing. Burgers, sunchoke, aioli & chocolate cake on the first visit were phenomenal! Albeit $9 for a small dessert seemed a bit too pricey, but I understand that vegan substitution can mean higher cost-margins. Had the fresh spinach fettuccine the second time around and it was a waste of $15 and a complete disappointment--way too undercooked, sticky, greasy and just bland. I wonder how or why this is even on the menu because it's very amateur, just because the pasta is fresh doesn't mean it's good, yes?! My husband's side of fries was cold & stale and the extra side of aioli was forgotten. We also ordered a regular black-drip, which the cashier said they had (off the menu) and then were served & charged $6.50 for a small cold-brew that was beyond bitter for regular coffee let alone a cold-brew, no cream or sweetener was offered either! Lastly, after taking my plate to the bar asking for a to-go box the girl behind the counter just handed me the box instead of boxing it for me after I actually had to take the plate to her, and so I ended up boxing it myself over the cash register while she was waiting for me, then handed her the plate--very awkward & rude! Staff needs more training, especially their Thursday night staff in taking orders correctly & hospitality. Basically, for the prices they charge (meaning sit-down prices for hip, cafe style dining) I hope to see great improvement in service at least! Deducting 1.5 stars for service and .5 stars for pricing in relation to cafe like dining; the POS says it all, we do not remember receiving a receipt either or being asked if we wanted one (second visit). However, I would like to finish on a good note, and say that the burgers are gourmet and worth every penny, and I just love their sunchoke & aioli (very reasonably priced too). My recommendation to the owners: add more reasonably priced light seasonal items to the menu like the sunchoke, frugivores compared to omnivores don't need much food to feel satisfied, or change to a bistro (small restaurant) style dining experience with a waiter, if not, at least a designated hospitality employee; the gourmet experience is a bit off at the moment.

3970385,2017-08-18,1,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"I'll start off by saying part of me really wants to give this place a 5 star review. I can't seem do a 3 1/2 star review, so I'm giving it 4 stars. It's hard to judge from a single experience and I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I will definitely go again and this time, just be more vocal about anything I feel isn't quite right. 

So here's my review, as well as POV on some of the objections others have made in their reviews. 

1) Location: I'm staying in Summerlin with my mom. She likes a lot of the vegan food I make (I'm pretty handy in the kitchen), but is definitely an omnivore and often not satisfied when I bring her to vegan restaurants. Having a nice place like this, close to our airbnb and also close to other omni places for those who really just want a burger or pizza is a huge plus. There's nothing worse than feeling like you're making the people you're with go out of their way to accommodate your plant-based preference. 5 stars for location

2) Price: True, it's not cheap. Then again, what great vegan places are? It's on par with similar plant-based places I've been in Asheville, NC, Florida and even Cali. 

For the money, the food was clearly very fresh & thoughtful, and the veggies were flavorful. It's also Vegas...everything's more expensive here and they need to make sure they can pay rent and employees to stay open. 

I had Bufflalo Cauliflower $9 + rosemary reg fries $4 (headsup, they're shoestring fries!). Mom had the cracked freekeh bowl $14 with the virgin feta $1 (which they forgot to add and we didn't even notice until we were nearly full). 

Total 2 meals, no drinks or extras, ~$30 + tip. Not cheap, but we surely would have spent AT LEAST that if I'd bought groceries at Whole Foods to make this dinner myself. + we had freekeh bowl leftovers. 

3.5 stars for Price.

3) Food & Service: Chelsea helped us and was really sweet and pleasant. She answered all my questions about the food really well and accommodated us as newbies, letting us grab a seat at the bar with the printed menus while we decided and then just putting our order in for us without making us get back up and wait in line.

We came after an evening yoga class and were really hungry...I was actually craving buffalo cauliflower....BAM it was on their menu. Sold. 

Many other reviews complained about the speed. This was NOT an issue for us, in fact the food came out so fast it surprised us! That said, we the roasted veggies in the freekeh bowl as well as my buffalo cauli were a tad undercooked. The eggplant couldn't really be eaten (don't eat raw or semi-raw nightshades!) the rest was just very al dente, but also tasty. I was ok with the buffalo cauli, but now having seen some photos from others, I'm sure it wasn't fully roasted. Now I'll know to just say something next time. Mom still really enjoyed her food but commented it could have been a bit more seasoned. 

As they were making smoothies for other customers, they gave us each a little sample which was really nice and we enjoyed them both. The raspberry (?) one was really yummy and the green one (x-something) was light, refreshing and not overly sweet. 

Chelea also checked in on us a couple times and genuinely seemed to want our feedback as they're still pretty new. Food+Service 3-3.5 stars, second chance pending...

Suggestions for Restaurant: 

- Be sure when people order they know they're supposed to self-serve water and get their own cutlery and napkins by the register. We were looking around waiting for it for a while, but now that I know it's not a big deal. 

- Mark on the menu what is/isn't Gluten Free

 Suggestions for Diners: 

- if you're not sure about something, ask! If your food doesn't seem right, cooked enough, etc, don't feel bad, just say something! I wish I had spoken up last night as I think they would have fixed it and I could have added an extra star to my rating. 

- if you're not really into this kind of lifestyle/food choices, don't go and then complain about the pretentious smoothie names or other such nonsense. Honestly, they're supposed to be inspiring and fun. If you want to drink pure sugar for half the price at Jamba Juice, go for it, but know there's a world of difference. 

- If you want to help them make this place even better, SAY SOMETHING, NICELY. I honestly don't believe places like this open without a genuine desire to serve the growing plant based community and promote more ethically inspired cuisine. Help them help us. 

Good, high quality plant based food requires love, skill and high quality ingredients. If you want to PAY someone else to make it for you, that gets baked into the final price. PLUS...you ARE in Las Vegas. Everything costs more here. I'm just grateful for a nice place to get some good food from good people. 

I will give this place another shot for sure and am really looking forward to it.",aG_i04u6fYMrskDpMcL1eA,3,1,4,46LD9rxI8a77EMcxp0xHWg

4215403,2017-11-16,2,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"Came here on a hot summery Friday morning with a friend since we were intrigued by the idea of venturing towards a new healthy cafe in the downtown Summerlin area. By no means is Panacea purely vegan, however they do carry a lot of plant-based items on their menu.

Sadly they didn't have any samples that day to try, so I decided to splurge a little on the dessert side of their inventory since I don't come by this side of town often.

I opted for their Divine Feminine smoothie since it had the highest intake of antioxidants out of all their smoothies. Originally I wanted to get their Gratitude smoothie since I prefer citrusy flavors, but that'll be an order for another day. This one drink in particular had an inconspicuous taste of berry overload, which is great as I wouldn't have it any other way. An easy sip to finish and I had enough to savor it even upon leaving the building.

Their Chef's Special for dessert was Panacea's version of a raspberry cheesecake with a poppy petal decor on top. A simplistic aesthetic on the eyes. The verdict it being rather tart in taste, it lacked the soft and mushy feeling of a cheesecake though, and if you didn't douse the cake with the sweet raspberry sauce it would seem rather dry in texture. 

Lastly, I took it upon myself to order at least one flavor of their plant-based truffles: goji berry, pistachio, matcha, and some other flavor that I completely forgot. Honestly they all had a taste of granola flavor to them, but the aftertaste wasn't bitter either. I would recommend to have these eaten with greek yogurt to offset the plainness.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,3,3,3,l2gKRGkTLcLTttObY1ibsQ

I wanted to love this place because the inside is really fun and chic but based on my first meal, I'm not particularly impressed. The menu was nothing special at all, I've had all those dishes other places before. We got the ultimate burger which had two patties on it. My first bite was just very plain and tasted like mostly black beans. The patties were very mushy and I'm not sure why they added two. The side salad that came with it had barely any dressing on it and again, hardly any flavor. We also had a side dish of buffalo cauliflower. The sauce on it was just regular buffalo sauce but the cauliflower was a little limp and nothing special. I did like the ranch dipping sauce. We also had a slice carrot cake for dessert which I enjoyed the most, but again, nothing really special. The staff was nice and the place was super cute but menu offering just so-so. My favorite vegan place so far is Violette's Vegan. My boyfriend is not vegan and he also preferred the burger and appetizers we've had there vs. Panacea.",nivlx6UsMVmugSmu1p3HqA,0,0,3,VjBc3W7CG9ODlhuh57w2Sg

Our constant fear when ordering Vegan is that we will still feel hungry. That is never a problem when eating here. We are stuffed! 

We ordered the Green Goddess salad, the nachos, sweet potato fries, and the eagle condor smoothie. We loved everything. The salad dressing is not too tart, not too sweet or overpowering - just the right blend for the delicate arugula. The nachos are huge and loaded with vegan cheese, chili, spring onion, tomatoes, and more. We threw some salad on each chip for fun. The sweet potato fries were crispy with several dipping sauces to choose from. Finally, the eagle condor smoothie is pretty good too with cacao and coffee. I'm so full though. We're just gonna take this smoothie home and blend it up with some ice later. 

The decor is inviting and entertaining. The service fantastic. Two sweet and engaging girls behind the counter. We happened to strike up a conversation with the chef too. I just love when people are passionate about what they do and why they do it. 

If I had something to complain about, it might be the music. I'm not sure what you might call it? Techno? House? It's verrry upbeat with an energetic tempo. I just feel like winding down and relaxing during a meal and that wild tempo doesn't seem like the right mood music? Slightly annoyed but not a deal breaker.

We ordered: spicy bourbon brussel sprouts, nachos, and the love burger with a side salad. Spicy bourbon brussel sprouts were so delicious, not spicy at all and tastes more like a teriyaki sauce, which isn't a bad thing at all. The love burger was tasty. However, maybe it was the patty that was a bit moist, so the bottom bun fell apart from becoming soggy. My boyfriend loved it, and he is a fan on all things burgers.
The nachos were big and beautiful, lots of nacho fixings including vegan cheese. It was very filling we had to take it home.
We brought home a snickerdoodle cookie, a goji berry/hemp truffle, a lemon/pistachio truffle, and a CBD water. The sweets were all delicious especially the lemon/pistachio, it was like biting into a lemon pound cake!

4938832,2017-05-13,1,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"I have been patiently awaiting the opening of this place for almost a year now. I had already been speaking so highly of it to my boyfriend because I just KNEW it was gonna be good. He's not a vegan by any means, but I always try to get him to eat plant based whenever I can. I have successfully managed to make 2 other vegan restaurants a part of his top 5 restaurants in Vegas, and I had planned for this place to be a third. So yesterday, I convinced him to come try Panacea with me. 

4:10pm (I know because the time is printed on the receipt) - The cashier rings in my order. My boyfriend didn't even order a drink and the bill was $50. He looked at me like ""really?"" So far I was not doing a good job of convincing him that this place was going to be great haha. 

4:25pm - I go up to the lady that's behind the counter and ask her for water cups while we wait. She says she will bring them to my table and hands me the smoothie I ordered. 

4:40pm - My boyfriend starts getting impatient and says ""You just paid $50 to wait over half an hour to get any food."" I guess so. We hadn't even received our appetizer or the water that the lady said she was going to bring to the table. Meanwhile, the guy checking up on all the tables is asking everyone else how their doing, but seems to be avoiding us. My boyfriend walked up to the lady that had been making food behind the counter and asks about our order, she replies, ""We are getting there.""

4:45pm - The same lady behind the counter walks up to our table to ask us what we ordered....wait, what?!??? This meal was definitely not going as I had planned. Thank goodness we weren't on a time crunch.  

4:55pm - Yay! Our appetizer has arrived! Not long after, the rest of our meal arrives as well. I was still super annoyed, but this nice blonde lady came out and explained exactly what happened. She said they still haven't figured out the receipt system so the orders tend to get mixed up out of sequence. This was all we needed as customers. From the guy avoiding us to the girl claiming she was working on our order, we just wanted an honest explanation. 

Now the food...was delicious! We got the rutabaga & sun choke bravas for an appetizer. I liked it, but my boyfriend didn't. I got the kale-green bowl for my entree and he got the cracked freekeh. Both were good, but the Cracked Freekeh bowl was AMAZING! My boyfriend even had to admit that it was extremely tasty. 

To sum it up...

Decor: Simply beautiful. There's no denying that. From the art on the walls to the plants on the tables, everything matches well with the name and theme. 

Price: Expensive. The food is overpriced, but that's become the norm these days for health conscious eateries. I hate when I try to tell people plant based is the way to go and they reply that it's ""too expensive."" It really shouldn't be, but yeah, at this restaurant it is. 

Service: Obviously we didn't receive the best service on our visit, but it's a brand spanking new restaurant that's still working out some kinks. I'm hopeful that this will improve as time goes on. 

Food: Delicious! The food was fresh and there was much attention paid to detail. The grain bowl we tried was full of an array of flavors. I will for sure be back to try more of their menu items. The food and the girl that explained the situation to us are the reasons for the 4 stars.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,9,3,4,AIrXmbOS7eXLO4Vdu0Nahg

I personally got the Love Burger - I ordered it without a pickle or the pink onions and with cheese. What I ended up with? A burger with lettuce. No cheese... since somehow they forgot. The patty had no flavor and was not worth the $14 (which included soggy shoe-string fries). 

My co-worker that ordered the Love Burger, did not love it at all. She said it lacked flavor with the exception of the pickle and mustard.

There's always something new to eat. My recent favorite is the spinach fettuccini. It's a bowl of green noodles with a mix of veggies. It all compliments each other very well. The broth is savory but not too heavy. I like to ask for extra veggies which provides a perfect balance.

The Yelp Book Club met here this past Saturday, and I have to say...I probably won't come back.  

Tucked away in a shopping center, Panacea is a ""plant based"" (not Vegan) cafe that is beautiful to walk into, but that's about where the good stopped for my visit.

First and foremost:  Their menus are on two separate walls. Above the register is all the food and sweets.  Next to the register, completely out of view, was the smoothie menu.  I had no idea where people were getting the smoothies they were walking out with.    

Second:  For a place that's been open for 2 months, I'd expect the full menu to be available.  Yet they still have ""coming soon"" next to several of their items.  Super disappointing, considering I'm a hummus freak, and would have loved to try their hummus plate.  

Third:  This place is really spendy for not a lot of food.    The burger is small.  The sweets are small.  The smoothies are 24 oz, but...they're $9 a piece.   

As for quality:  meh.  The smoothie we ordered, the ""Gratitude""  (kind of pretentious smoothie names, in my opinion): Green Grapes, Kale, Spinach, Dandelion, Ginger, Lemon, Green Cabbage, Orange, Apple, was ok.  But Jamba Juice is better, and cheaper.  
The cupcake was ok.  It was comically placed in a GIGANTIC bowl...one tiny cupcake in an enormous bowl...and honestly, I've had better at other Vegan joints.  
The edamame was good.  I did enjoy that.  I thought the cilantro was a nice touch.

Service was severely lacking too.  Pretentious attitude when I asked a question, and that's never ok.  

Definitely disappointed in this place.  I really wanted to like it a lot, but it was just lacking too much for me to give any more than 2 stars.   Would not recommend.  Most likely will not be back.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,14,5,2,qn9zyvT1I8G7HmC7Lf4wDA
5280999,2018-02-08,2,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"If you're new to vegan food, then Panacea may not be the best place to experience it. I'm not saying that the food is not good, but the flavors are very earthy. 

I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, the Love burger, a BBQ burger, chili cheese fries, chocolate chip cookie, and a mock Hostess cupcake. 

The burgers were decent, but not worth the price. The Love Burger was topped with sautéed onions, dill pickles, lettuce, ginger mustard, and chipotle ketchup, plus a side salad.In spite of them burning the bun of my BBQ burger, the toppings were still really yummy. I especially enjoyed the contrasting flavors of the dill pickles and the sweet BBQ sauce. The onion straws on the burger were delicious too. 

I substituted one side salad for chili cheese fries, which were on the bland side. I even wondered if they actually added cheese to the fries. Note to self, stick to the regular fries next time. 

My least favorite entree was the Umami spinach fettuccine. It was way too busy and extremely spicy. 
I'm all about getting my daily dose of vegetables, but the dish looked more like a science experiment. Maybe the packing (on to-go orders) could be done differently.

On a positive note, I was given a sample of a very tasty green smoothie that's worth coming back for! 

Lastly, my chocolate chip cookie was phenomenal, but the Hostess cupcake needs more cream in the middle and more chocolate icing. Otherwise, it's very moist and chocolatey. 

I'm on the fence with this place, but will more than likely give them another shot. It's a really cute place and the servers are friendly.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,7,3,3,sRTx7y3SxwyaUL_XFZdWIA

This is a Togarashi seasoned burger patty, toasted bun, smoked paprika aoili, sautéed mushrooms, yakitori-sweet chili sauce, pickled red cabbage, green onions, avocado and furikakae...! You simply have to try this burger to understand how good it is. They have an upstairs dining area tables downstairs and an outside patio. They also have a small food bar to eat at which is nice if you just want to run in and grab a quick bite. They have Wi-Fi which is always good for those that need it.

5421483,2018-01-28,0,s4sr0anCKMyQw53xNv6DQA,"I've eaten at Panacea several times since they opened. I've tried burgers, grain bowls, salads, burritos, cookies and Kombuchas. I'm very pleased with the dog friendly patio out front and I'm pleased that it is one of many plant based dining options in the valley now. 
 
   I have pros and cons. Panacea has been very hit or miss for me. Last Friday was my most recent visit. I had the Spicy bourbon brussel sprouts as an appetizer which I have had several times. Sometimes I get them and they are superbly perfect and dripping in the spicy bourbon sauce. Other times like last Friday they were dry as a bone and just blackened in appearance with just a hint of spicy bourbon sauce flavors. Perhaps some of the chefs have more skills or experience. 
 For my entree I had the Ultimate burrito. One of the main ingredients is Soyrizo. I feel the Soyrizo really ties the whole burrito together with explosive flavor but for whatever reason my burrito this time around had maybe a teaspoon of Soyrizo. I'm guessing either they were short on Soyrizo, being cheap or poor burrito building skills by the chef of that evening. My burrito was also extremely dry too. I think for the cost they should also come with sides of fresh salsa or some hot sauce options to customize them to your individual liking. Keep in mind that I've also had the burrito when it's ingredients were well balanced, juicy and flawless with flavors. When I have something delicious I love to return and have it several more times and it is such a let down that I never know if it's gonna be a delicious night or a flop. I may bring my own salsa in the future if they don't start to offer it. 

  Next the kombucha on tap is a favorite of mine. I had grape last time and it was perfect. I've found that everywhere I have kombucha on tap it's hit or miss in the flavor and carbonation departments. So I can't blame Panacea when One is a dud. So thumbs up to the kombuchas. 
  The cookies I have tried were all rich, sweet and delicious. Sometimes a little on the high dollar side for the quantity but I imagine rent is through the sky in this location so that's, well that. 

  Last but not least the employees. Fortunately I've had more extremely friendly and helpful experiences than the polar opposite. Everyone has a bad day so I don't take bad service personally unless it's a constant thing with the same people. 
  I won't give up on Panacea because I've had more good meals than bad ones. I will keep you updated on future visits to Panacea.",DYNHc9IxYwdJuGuC4bvpAw,1,1,3,iYeGKSPLWVqV7TbXyswcAA

Their menu is mainly vegetarian/vegan friendly, but they do not broadcast their items specifically. It makes a carnivore eater try new things that taste similar, but yet is way more healthy and better for you. 

Kale salad hands down the most amazing and beautiful salad you'll ever try! So many flavors you taste in one bite. They ""Kaled it!"" 

As for the Asian Osaka burger, it is one of the best vegan burgers I've ever had. The flavors of the ""meat"" taste so meat like, you can't believe it's not meat. 

Cheese burger, hummus bowl, edamame bowl & Green goddess arugula salads are all amazing. They are all portioned well to the amount to pay.

Updating my review because I gave it another shot. Had the Freekeh bowl.... once again came out literally 35 minutes later and it was apparently this super fly, bomb signature bowl that everyone raved about. Ahhhh it was so bad. Literally like raw chickpeas, and this weird beet tahini/hummus, and like cold soggy peppers and weirdness. Oh it was so bad.

Panacea has easily become one of my absolute favorite restaurants since becoming vegan. Their umami spinach fettuccine won my heart at first bite and I have found myself craving it on a weekly basis. If it weren't for how pricey the food was, I would probably be here on a daily basis honestly! I understand that plant-based food ain't cheap but I do find myself only eating here when I have extra money in my pocket haha. 

Their menu is packed with delicious sounding foods and so far I've tried the ultimate burger, cracked freekeh bowl, forbidden black rice bowl, the Osaka burger and I can honestly say they have the BEST vegan burgers in town!!! Super flavorful, juicy, and guilt free, yassss! The burgers come with a side of salad or fries for $2.50 more and a slice of cheese for $1 extra.

They also serve an array of desserts - their cookies are massive and addicting (applesauce is the egg substitute ingredient that makes them so yummy!); the snickerdoodle is a must try! They also serve smoothies, coffees/lattes, and kombucha on tap! 

The ambiance is also what keeps me coming back, especially the upstairs! It has a modern and hip vibe with dim lighting to it that just makes it perfect for studying, meeting with a friend for lunch or going on a nice date.

We strained to view the small menu hanging overhead until the lady behind the counter noticed us and provided us with the paper menus.

The restaurant itself is not huge, but clean and colorful. They feature some cool art and a choice to dine upstairs or downstairs. Upstairs is more private and has some unique lighting using the Einstein bulbs that I love. 

The menu features many unique vegan style options and so I just went with what sounded good to me. I decided on the ""Love Burger"" and the ""Gratitude"" smoothie. The burger was all plant based with black beans, quinoa etc. along with shredded lettuce, agrodulce onions, cabbage, pickles, mustard and ketchup. I also had a side of fries with sea salt. The smoothie was made of green grapes, kale, spinach, dandelion, ginger, lemon and apple. The burger was fresh and tasty and I really couldn't taste the difference between a regular meat burger and this burger. The burger was definitely small for the price. My smoothie was also very good and it was a healthy serving so I know I definitely had my required ""greens"" for the day. My total check was $23.25 which I was like (cough, cough) what???? That was damn expensive for a burger, fries and a smoothie but I did feel really good when I was done. No heavy feeling of fullness like when I eat a regular meat burger and I did have some extra energy too so I ran home (just kidding). I did have a chance to taste Loren's Buffalo Cauliflower which in my opinion was the star of the meal. The buffalo sauce was nice and spicy and gave this normally boring veggie a kick. The only issue is they could have spared a little more dipping sauce.

Very cool name for a dining establishment, touting a healthy and healthful menu of smoothies, salads that is also vegan friendly.

It is located in Boca Park, next to The Cheesecake Factory.  So parking that is super close will be rough to find, but that is nothing healthy minded individuals that decided to park in their parking structure a few extra steps away can't handle.

The restaurant looks very modern, with additional seating spaces upstairs. The view upstairs is great, the use of mirrors and the angle of view makes it totally looks far more spacious than it actually is, as the illusion of seeing the bar seating area (directly below you) downstairs plays a cool trick on you.

On my visit, it happens to be their soft opening (first day in fact), which is credited to my friend Leo that told me to check them out because they do Kung fu Tea ceremony and also serves kombucha tea.

After quickly glancing at their menu (I only noticed their drink menu at first) and did not see kombucha tea, so I opted to try one of their smoothies. I asked for a recommendation and since I said I preferred to try something ""berries"" instead of ""green"", the Divine Feminine was what I ended up ordering along with 118* Chopped Salad. 

I headed upstairs and after a few minutes, the very beautiful lady with blonde hair wearing a crisp chef coat came upstairs to ask if almond milk is okay or would I want coconut water, I picked almond milk (since that's one of the options for smoothie orders, with Coconut Milk being the other option). 

Then she came back with a beautiful plate of salad. It has a lot of different greens (arugula, mustard greens?) and tomato halves and shaved fennel, carrot, radicchio, and fanned avocado slices. It didn't look like the 18* Chopped Salad that I thought I ordered, but whatever. The lady that took my order must have punched in the order incorrectly or didn't hear me correctly, the music can be loud at times.  But it was delicious. I love the vibrant tomatoes that balanced out the pepperiness of some of the salad greens.

After a long wait, a server finally came upstairs asking if anyone is still waiting for their smoothie order. That's when my Divine Feminine smoothie was served in the familiar plastic cup adorned with a sticker with their restaurant name and graphics.  It was quite good, I finished in a matter of minutes.

I am glad the restaurant opened offering healthier menus, which is something I have to mentally force myself to try. You know bacon, good slow braised shortribs and Chinese honey BBQ pork are hard for omnivore like me to resist. I look forward to checking out their menu once they graduated from their soft opening phase.
