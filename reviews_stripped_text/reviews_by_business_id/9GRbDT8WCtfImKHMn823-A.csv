 I just got the 12 piece chicken meal for the family and I have to say, it was delicious!
Chicken was crispy, not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the mac and cheese and biscuits ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly shrimp which was delicious.  Definitely worth going back for!",05AJXwvGplac3IWSk68pyA,1,1,5,z5-Wiiag6fUqkzOxO3v1FA

This system makes the chicken crispy and juicy without the grease. Reasonable prices.  Very simple restaurant setup.  Minimal decor. Very friendly,  really clean.

1644201,2014-08-20,2,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"This place is solely dedicated to serving up broasted chicken and one of the very few places that is authorized to sell genuine Broaster's Chicken! Good news for me since I became of a fan of broasted chicken when I first tried it in Boulder City six months ago.

Chicken is moist and juicy, skin is thin crispy coating. All pieces are fried up fresh,  not from a frozen state to a perfect golden brown. Not burnt. I detect the chicken skin is mildly seasoned with garlic and salt. The chicken meat seems like it's brined because the flavors goes down right down to the bone. 

Hardly any grease unlike fried chicken. 

It means less fat, less calories and less carbs because the broasted method uses a pressure fryer (not bros roasting chicken) which seals the juices within the coating of the chicken. Chicken is Fricken good! I ended up ordering another meal to take home.

They sell individual chicken pieces ranging from 2 - 24 pieces, meal deals that come with biscuits and sides. Some of the sides offered are fries, coleslaw and a very generous portion of mac n cheese.

Prices are budget friendly. Well at least for me it was. I got the 2pc chicken deal with mac n cheese with free can of soda, cost me a whopping $6! 

Dining area is simple just a few tables. Food prep area was immaculate. It's a one man operation. Owner is a nice guy!  He is the one multi tasking with taking and making your order.  

Just remember now, chicken is made to order and is timed and takes a total of 15 minutes to make. So call ahead if you are in a rush. 

I prefer to dine in. Chicken skin is crispier. Because once it's packaged to go, it loses some  crisp from the steam trapped in the box.

Find Z Chicken in the same lot where Regal Colonnade, Juns Korean. Right behind Lemongrass Cafe. You cant miss it right off Eastern and Pebble.  Bigger fan because of this convenient location.   

Glad I saw Lon L.'s review and he mentioned broasted chicken in the first paragraph.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,4,4,4,pWVnhal1enXJjlr8fgbgRg
1644987,2014-08-22,0,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"This is the first time I've ever had broasted chicken and it tasted alright.

The chicken itself was very tender, juicy, and the skin was crispy. 

The only problem I had was that the chicken is not seasoned at all. I would love to come back here again, but I would really hope that the chicken had some flavour in it. It just seems like the chicken is breaded and then 'broasted' and then served. Not being seasoned once.

The man running the operation is a very nice guy, he talked to me while he was preparing the chicken (which is cooked to order) and overall his restaurant is very clean. 

A little too clean though, when I went inside the restaurant I got an overwhelming scent of bleach. Not that it affects the food, but if I had decided to stay and dine in the restaurant it would've become bothersome. 

Anyway, if the food was just seasoned at all, this place would be a hit and a much better option than KFC or Popeyes.",MzIzsHa1kssFkviGufm-dw,0,0,3,l_zVF_PImRitwKGeZ4uCyg
1989777,2014-06-28,0,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"What can I say about Z Chicken - except that the chicken is fresh, crisp, and juicy.  It is cooked when you order it so you do have to be patient.  If you don't feel like waiting you could call ahead and put your order in so that it is ready when you get there.  But I can tell you that it is worth the wait, this chicken is the real deal.  The texture of the chicken very light and doesn't drip of oil like other fried chicken joints nor is the chicken heavily breaded.  Check it out and order ahead - you won't be disappointed.",P8I1j-p6hxYrewXFCdkXLQ,0,0,5,RvoILJEbcQO0jqmT8P-QaA
2725226,2014-06-09,0,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"So I walked into this place to try and eat lunch around 1:30 without to much success. When I walked in there was 1 person in the place and he was actually just breaking some chicken at the time. So I'm like ok it's a hole in the wall it's fine I can wait a min. So I ask where do I order from to let him know I was wanting to order something. Proceeded to say it's my 1st time in. He says "" there is a menu in the front"" 

These were actually the last words that were spoken between us. After he washed his hands I expected to have my order taken but I guess this guy had better things to do than actually sell something. So I wait like 10 minutes playing with my phone and finally I'd had enough and just walked back out the door and went to Twin Peeks and got a burger. 
I guess I won't be back here anytime soon thanks a lot Z Chicken. 
I really think the guy just wanted me to leave he didn't even say a word as I walked out 
I don't think Z chicken is gonna make it with service like this",xDk84KnY8Gc-2uTb3U2_9w,6,0,1,ofbM3Rmlq5gG7AIUAokm0w
2875733,2014-05-13,0,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"I'm a new fan of broasted chicken, and Z chicken is a good spot to get it. I had a combo with mac and cheese, potato wedges, and biscuits. Everything was good, but the chicken is the star. Somehow, the broasting process kept my chicken hot during the entire meal. I also liked that the flavor seemed to be locked into the actual chicken meat instead of the outer skin like at other chicken places that always seem overly greasy. Next time I'm trying the hot wings cuz it seems like the process is perfect for that. Service was good too. I was helped by Dave, the owner, and he was super friendly while the chicken was cooking.

2892488,2014-10-25,0,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"After reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this place.  Unfortunately Z chicken was a let down.  

The Pros:  The Chicken was very juicy and was not over fried.  The Mac and cheese was also decent.  It is for those two reasons that I gave them at least 2 stars

The cons:
Service- The man working the counter was less then friendly and seemed almost bothered by us ordering. 

Food-The only compliment I can give the chicken is that it was juicy.  The oil the chicken was fried in was old and needed changed, as the chicken tasted like burnt oil.   The coating on the chicken was in serious need of seasoning.   After the first bite I was done. Overall it was not good fried chicken.  The okra was fried well but also in serious need of seasoning, mainly some salt.  The biscuits were dry and had no flakiness to them. They tasted like they had been frozen and then thawed out.",OYr9ZDVcQy3inSIjIy7tJA,4,0,2,09pf_DnQV5Y5y2reoIPXlw
2898741,2014-08-06,3,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"By now everyone in Las Vegas should know what a Broasted chicken is about, if not, you should check this place out.   You don't have to drive to Boulder City find out what it's about...in fact, this place is much more reasonably priced. 

I'm a fan of this type of fried chicken, it's juicy, but not oily at all, and made  FRESH to ORDER!    It's great stuff, but what totally surprised me was Z chicken variation of their Coleslaw.  Very similar to the famous Original Pantry Cafe. Simple, but very solid!   heck, I'm in the area, and not too much in Fried Chicken (fat chance on that one) I might just order a side order of slaw, and put it on my sandwich!    

Located at the northeast corner of Eastern and Pebble, Z Chicken shares the same shopping center as the Regal Colonnade cinemas, Jun Korean BBQ, and Soda fizz.  Right now, it's most just a chicken joint, but I have a feeling it's going to be more than that shortly.  Good stuff.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,5,3,5,X6_TtjbCGVBjabEzzodGdQ
3075786,2014-05-16,1,9GRbDT8WCtfImKHMn823-A,"Hands down the BEST fried chicken & biscuits I've ever had in my freakin life. Tried this place on a whim, it was on the smaller side, one guy working who was really nice.  I liked how he had local art on the wall for sale.  Since I couldn't find it online & there was no one else around I expected it to just be all right, but it was dammn delicious.  You can tell the owner knows how to cook, tried the chicken meal with mac & cheese, potato salad and the biscuits, all were amazing. Much better then the chicken at any fast food place or god forbid that crap they serve at kfc.  I felt bad that a place this great didn't have good business, l if you're in the mood for some delicious chicken try it out cuz this place doesn't deserve to go out of business.",tOHlttRfZt1M4k1W4LXFmw,4,1,5,C6MDttTm0TFJBVWrETJyTw

Super moist chicken, crispy, thinly breaded, super crispy skin. Cole slaw is made in-house and really tasty as well. Potato salad was average.

Chicken is not greasy yet has more flavor than any other fried chicken I've had. The Mac n Cheese is perfect! Also the biscuit are little pillowy clouds of goodness. 

This is a very quaint little mom and pop type business, type of place that I'd probably just pass by without noticing. I'm glad my friend recommended it to me because it was worth the drive. I would definitely suggest calling ahead because they make the chicken fresh to order so it can take awhile. But I'm telling you it is worth the wait.

With that said, the store itself is a vanilla shell with minimal artwork (colorful camouflage canvas paintings for sale).  It is very clean.  So clean you can probably eat off the floor!!  There are about 6 four top tables.  

We walked in and were greeted by the owner.  Friendly and helpful.  He's from Chicago.  :) 

The hubby and I ordered the 8 piece broasted chicken meal with 2 sides (potato wedges and coleslaw) and 4 biscuits.  $19.

Reasonably priced and really delicious.  

Now just for fun...  2 years ago I mentioned to the hubby that Broasted Chicken was down the street from us.  It was on Las Vegas Blvd with a sign that read N A I V E.  So naive at the time he believed it.  Only to realize that I was joking with him.  Hahahaaa..
