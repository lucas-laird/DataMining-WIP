Ceasar, the chef, showed consideration by personally asking me about my preference of my order. The food is always fresh and full of flavor.   Ordered the Volcano Blackened Mahi fish with brown rice. Also, ordered the Hawaiian Teriyaki shrimp with the Rumbi rice. Always a pleasure to eat at Rumbi Island Grill.",4vwNDGBp4WhnMjxkhmDUXg,0,0,5,ji3S-fMRjQhmVl3Ur4LNTQ

826165,2016-02-20,0,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,"I'm not one to write reviews but I felt that I had to on this one. First off I called on the phone and asked to place an order over the phone and the girl was short with me and asked if I could wait ""a few minutes"" on hold because they had a long line and a family of 5 ordering, I said no problem and waited on hold for 5 minutes before I hung up. So I decided I'd just head down there and try and call on the way there again. (I tend to order over the phone because I find it to be a lot faster). So I did and this nice gentlemen took my order and quoted me 15min before I could come get my food. I ordered at 6:05pm walked in exactly after 15min, was greeted with an unenthusiastic ""aloha"" when I walked in, I went up to the register where this younger man was taking orders who seemed very shy (no big deal) so I paid and then was told my order wasn't quite ready. So I said no big deal and backed off assuming my order was being bagged.. which was waaaaay far off! I waited on the side while listening to the employees in the back who I could hear nice and clearly.. I'll add that none of them were wearing gloves while handling the food and none of them had hairnets or aprons on. There was a young girl, red hair,  completely belittling her fellow coworkers, yelling at them giving them attitude telling them no one is helping her and telling them how useless and ridiculous they are all the while throwing tongs on the counter saying ""she's done!"" And proclaiming how angry she is that she's the only one working and that there's no manager on duty, etc ETC ETC. I took a video of her talking rudely to her two co workers that's how shocked I was! After waiting and waiting and waiting some more I finally asked the boy behind the counter nicely how my order was looking and he said he was sorry and that he'd check on it, so he went back ( I can see everything going on) and asked where the teriyaki bowl was and where the tacos where and the red headed girl raises her voice and says, Well the bowl of rice has been sitting there for forever, the tacos are there and here's the kids noodles! Then I watch her cut my steak on the cutting board which I guess wasn't done then watch her throw it back in the pan to cook some more. Mind you, it has now been 40min and they barely started putting my order together that I ordered OVER THE PHONE 35min before after I said something. So after all of that (believe me this is a long story short) I received my teriyaki bowl ( was supposed to be spicy and wasn't) btw I heard them saying to each other that they didn't know if they made it spicy or not) my husbands tacos and my sons teriyaki noodle bowl, finally walked out 50min after I ordered over the phone!! After seeing the way they handled the food with no gloves, none of them were wearing hair nets or anything I told my husband I wasn't sure if I wanted to even eat it. I decided to anyhow no idea why and the flavor was on point, my husband said his wasn't bad and my son liked his noodles BUT the food was EXTREMELY oily and my steak was a little chewy since the girl threw it back on the grill. All in all if I had to rate the food I'd give it about 3 stars but because I witnessed the terrible back of the house service and the way the red head was treating these poor guys she was working with and the time I had to wait for my food I only give it 1 star and that's only because it won't allow me to give none. Hopefully the manager of the establishment reads this and gets some more help in there and rethinks the red heads employment because she is a terrible team player, is negative and extremely rude! End rant. (Going to try and upload the video of the girl being rude also)",fwtDWzKNQ2o_lpupMgS4fg,0,0,1,E--ukVBOXrY49DQYy0HH-Q
856502,2015-10-22,0,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,"I was excited to eat here after going to the Maryland locations many times and the food was terrible. I got a bbq chicken salad and carrots were bad. Also the chicken didn't taste right and pita bread was stale. My husband had a teriyaki bowl and his chicken and rice weren't good either. The rice was really gummy. We feel like crap after eating it. 

Sadly, we will not be back.",w9NJ9pY7MTOzuTgzWmhSWA,0,0,1,K-lR4nnvNDdS9KhrkiN0kA

2395572,2016-03-02,0,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,Decided to give this place a try and I must say the food is delicious. Everything is fresh and it tastes delicious. The staff is amazing and they have great customer service. I didn't know what to order since it was my first and they decided to explain to me the menu. Everything was amazing. I ordered a rice bowl with Noodles and from the chicken to the vegetables in it was great. If you haven't checked this place then you should.

3781628,2016-02-19,1,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,The Kahuna Burger is the best! Anyone that loves island-style food and atmosphere should absolutely give this place a go. The owners are super nice and always accommodating. They make your visit pleasant and enjoyable.

4559108,2016-04-23,0,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,This place was alright. I ordered the kahuana burger with rumbi fries and the burger was good but the teriyaki sauce is a bit sweet tasted like maple syrup. And the fries were over cooked. Also the fries had a fishy taste to them probably cause they use the same fryers to fry fish. The prices are good so maybe we'll come back one day. Best thing we did have was a pineapple cake. I would go back just for the cake.,W5NduvWX04nIazbmgBtpEw,0,0,3,w_ZfmXFLpd7aIAs327DLog
4655364,2016-01-29,7,HJMFCfgp8fbey-sCi9vGPw,"From the shores of Hawaii, award winning sandwiches come crashing to the desert shores of Las Vegas the Ninth Island at Eastern at Serene like a tidal wave. Except here the shoreline is the sidewalk that wraps around the Walmart-anchored shopping center. 

   Las Vegas is a melting pot of cuisine from the shores of the world. This makes the Ninth Island an interesting place to explore restaurants. On my exploration of Hawaiian restaurants, my mind had been set on Rumbi Island Grill. Twice in recent times, Rumbi Island Grill went from mind to experience. 

   Rumbi Island Grill is relatively new to the Ninth Island. This location, the second one in Las Vegas opened this past summer. For several previous summers, Rumbi Island Grill has been popular in Utah where the majority of their locations are. In essence, Rumbi Island Grill is a Utah dining experience exported to Las Vegas. And their sandwiches made for a pleasant dining experience. 

   Upon scanning their menu, it appeared that they specialize in rice bowls. But life in the world of dining out can be kind of funny. From several experiences it appears that restaurants that promote one cruise such as Outback with steak or Nathan's with hotdogs; serve outstanding burgers and sandwiches. Rumbi Island Grill was the latest. 

    On visit one, I ordered the Kahuna Burger. This burger creation seemed to be the size of a football. This was a Super Bowl worthy burger sized burger. I tasted the two USDA ground beef patties marinated in teriyaki sauce, with the Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions topped off with a pineapple. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to return to Rumbi Island Grill. Fast forward to a week later, and I was inside exploring the Island Chicken sandwich. I liked the Island Chicken sandwich more than the Kahuna Burger. This thing was huge. Biting into this is like opening your mouth wide when the dentist is about to x-ray your teeth. My pictures below compliment this picture that I am putting into words. Between the patties were grilled chicken breast, Swiss cheese, red onion, mayonnaise, and in Island Grill fashion a pineapple. Both times that I dined here, I combo sized them into a meal. This added a fountain drink and rumbi fries. Rumbi fries are a mix of sweet potato and regular fries. A unique sauce that looks like thousand Island compliments the fries. The admission for this dining experience both times was around $11 and change. 

    To begin the dining experience, you enter a line that looks like ropes and poles from a ship. Before arriving at the counter, there are menus. The first time dining here, it could be overwhelming. The employees were happy to help. Upon paying for the food, they present you with a stamp card that eventually leads to a complimentary meal. Subsequently to paying, you find a table, pour your Coke beverage and take in the Hawaiin motif. There are Hawaii pictures and the music of the tropic provides a dining soundtrack. I was overhearing reggae and Jimmy Buffet to the degree that I was thinking this could be a restaurant from the Caribbean islands. They brought the food to the table on plates that they took off the table when I was done. The cheerful employees would check up on me. Both times I would leave Rumbi Island Grill full with just enough room in my stomach for the after dinner cup of Starbuck's coffee.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,10,4,Hgl3JeYAFTH4axhjqcmhbw

A very large order was placed before we got there and our order came a little late and the gentlemen working went out of their way to apologize.  We really appreciated that.

I waited anxiously for them to finally open up here.  Their Rumbi Rice is a nice change from regular rice because they infuse it with coconut.  Today, I actually tried the Rumbi BBQ Salad. I think I found my new favourite go to salad, it was that amazing! It's located in a pretty busy area but the service is always fast and friendly.
