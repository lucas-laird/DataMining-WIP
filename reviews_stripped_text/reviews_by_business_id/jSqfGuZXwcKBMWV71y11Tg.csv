It doesn't.

Double-char dog is overly charred to the point that it's almost like jerky, not a hot dog. On the bright side, the bun didn't fall apart, but I took two bites and had no interest in finishing the thing. Not a good reaction considering it's a $7 hotdog and my immediate reaction was ""7-11 has got this place beat.""

Add to the mediocrity by being out of cheese. Their cheese fries were likely going to be the only redeeming factor for my meal, but they're out. On a Monday. Here's an idea, maybe go stock up?

The hot dog options and taste are great, the pigs in a blanket are perfect, and the fries are just the way I like them (on the thin side but potato-y, somewhat similar to Five Guys).

Made special trip to Red Rock casino to try it out on Saturday June 28.  It was pretty empty, especially for a weekend.  My husband ordered a polish dog, and was very disappointed they don't have sauerkraut.  I originally ordered a coney dog and was disappointed they don't serve chili.  I have never heard of a hot dog place that doesn't serve sauerkraut and chili!  Anyway, I ended up ordering the dogs in a blanket.  We shared an order of fries and got two sodas, and our tab came to $27 and change, which is ridiculous for hotdogs, even in a Vegas (off Strip) casino.  I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was as good as the Pinks (which was formerly in this location) or Nathan's, but it wasn't.  The ""blanket"" portion of my dogs in a blanket was undercooked, and my food tasted like hot dogs wrapped in raw dough.  The fries tasted as though they  had been prepared in old grease and were limp and oily.  My husband said his polish dog was decent, yet he was still disappointed it had no kraut.  I will say the worker who delivered our food to the table was friendly, although the woman who took our order not so much.  I wish Pinks had never left this location, they were so much better!

First of all, their food is overpriced unless you order off of the limited value menu or are just getting fries or Krispy Kreme donuts. You can get a pound of cheese fries for 5 bucks which is probably the best value they offer. It's pretty ridiculous that they're charging $6-8 for a Chicago style hot dog...there are more authentic and cheaper options in town if that's what you're looking for. 

I had a char turkey burger, 6 piece pigs in blanket and a strawberry shake. The turkey burger tasted like a normal beef burger, mainly because of the char from the grill. Either that or they gave me the wrong burger! The pigs in blanket were a little burnt and mostly blanket and not enough pig. The strawberry shake was decent and I finished it pretty quick. Although it still doesn't compare to In-N-Out's strawberry shake.

If you're at the sportsbook check it out, otherwise save your money and skip it. It's really not up to Chicago standards despite being a Chicago chain.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,4,2,2,Xab8W8wIHdEwk63c7H42cQ

Now onto the review.  

First off, I'm happy with the prices considering it's located in a casino. Two char-dogs, fries and a Pepsi for $10. Not too shabby. 

The char-dogs, (which is something new to me) were great. Made by Vienna Beef, a good quality dog. The dogs come Chicago style. Bright green relish, sport peppers, onions, tomato, pickle spear and garlic salt. This may be my new go-to hot dog joint. As for the fries.

3167838,2014-08-04,12,jSqfGuZXwcKBMWV71y11Tg,"Not too long ago, I saw an episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate on Food Network where The Wiener's Circle in Chicago was featured by Ted Allen. Needless to say, I was pretty excited when they announced plans to open up here in Vegas. And while this location might not have the infamous rude service, they do have a pretty solid Chicago dog!

Adding to the trend of transplants coming to Red Rock Casino, The Wiener's Circle can be found right next to the sports book in the old spot where Pink's once was. The restaurant has a decent amount of seating for it's size and is styled almost like a modernized 50's diner. Apart from a lonely fly wandering around, the place was pretty much spotless and thankfully doesn't have a second-hand smoke smell. It is a pay at the counter setup, but they do bring your food out and the two employees we encountered were friendly and helpful.

When it comes to the menu, the main stars are of course dogs and burgers. There's several variations of the dogs, including their char dogs and boiled Vienna Reds. Each dog comes topped like a classic Chicago dog and can even bad had as a double, which is 2 dogs on 1 bun. For those who don't like it at all, they have no problem customizing one to your liking though. There are a few breakfast items on the menu as well, including a breakfast sandwich made with 2 Krispy Kreme doughnuts, which are also served at The Wiener's Circle.

I opted for the double cheddar dog and while it wasn't the best hot dog I've ever had, it was still pretty good. The dog is charred on their specialized grill and since they are somewhat small, I'm glad that I got a double. It had a good snap to it and was surprisingly juicy. I love a good Chicago dog and ordered mine just as it came, but both the toppings and bun fell a bit short. The bun was just way too soggy and neither the tomato or pepper seemed fresh, as they were both pretty mushy. I'd definitely order without the cheese next time though as I think that just added to the sogginess. My meal also came with fries which have a coarse salt on them, but they were really greasy and just okay.

Since they are in a casino, I don't want to complain too much about the price...but it is a tad on the high side for what you get. A double dog is $7-8 and as I mentioned, they are somewhat small. We ended up spending just over $20 for two meals, but if you have a lighter appetite, they offer a couple decently priced value meals. I do think they are a welcome addition to the Red Rock and would definitely return if in the area.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,14,13,3,Tqd0yuNf4BRRy1LCuAIX1g

The place was not very crowded and food was delivered to our table in a short period. We ordered a double and single char hot dogs. The single comes with French Fries and a drink. Both sandwiches come fully loaded with the Chicago style condiments. 

The char Hot Dogs are not as tasty or as juicy as a genuine Windy City dogs. The French Fries are nothing special. I tried to order the cheese fries but they were out.

I would not make a special trip for these Hot Dogs but if you are in the Red Rock Resort and crave one it is convenient, especially if you are in the Sports Book and don't  want to miss any action.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,2,1,3,4UajDZu013C09anpMAeEzQ

I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered ""Wieners in a Blanket"" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered ""Cheddar Fries"" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a ""Char Polish"" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,43,38,4,SioI9NC-Cwps4peob9sXpg

Chicago-style dogs are the game here, and they execute the formula down to the letter.  Sure, you could go across the street to Costco for a dog, but if you're a fan of the chicago-style that includes tomatoes, relish, mustard, celery salt, and a pickle spear, this is your joint in this region of the valley.

The burgers on the menu here are ok and served with the same dressings as the dog.  The patty gets a fair amount of char (hence, char-burger), but there's no real juice to the patty.

Wiener's Circle even has big screen TVs hooked up to the Red Rock Casino sportsbook, so this will quite possibly be my go-to eating spot for all my favorite sporting events.

Just awful service from start to finish. It seemed like it was opening day but they've been open for a year! 
I understand that it takes some time to prepare the meals. However, we waited around 15 minutes and when my number was called it wasn't ready! I saw one person doing all the cooking and the cashier helped a little. Not even close to providing good service. Not even a thanks for waiting when it was finally ready!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,3,1,DEL98YcjLdbaa-7c8RMnQg
