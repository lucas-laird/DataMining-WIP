They sell a bunch of agua frescas  - I got the pineapple, very good. The place was clean and well laid out. I like being able to see into the kitchen. I would come back when in the area.",XDPm1U6uMjn7XVnXPFTuPw,0,0,5,8CUxl-CH3z5I7fx95sDcgg

The lady who assisted us when we first walked in gave us samples of every drink they make fresh and every one was just as delicious as the next. It's clean, the decor is relaxing and a laid back feel. She took her time with us and guided us along with the menu. The food was delicious! Just good basic food. I will defiantly be back to try everything else on the menu!",pvxpYNr_blF1C3JCMIwEUg,0,0,5,qskHOTc9wu5AVAd6skNibw

One of the few places I like tongue here. Their ceviche is good, small portion but it's cheap too. Elote is meh, but that's probably the only thing that hasn't thrilled me. Staff is friendly and major bonus for having a drive thru. Definitely where I go when I get off work craving Mexican food. Quick, easy and delicious. Their Frescas are great too.",ndhakszVplkDWU-2ApTfRw,0,0,5,PSDpnmlgjf7wvuEqgKDwAw

I ordered a caene asada burrito with everything, shrimp quesadilla and a shrimp taco.
Burrito was like full of air
The quesadilla had a little string of cheese

I will be returning here for certain, Thank you for taking that local spot.... clean cheery staff helpful.. they as well give suggestions for their fresh fruit drinks, i tried a taster but as usual I am a water drinker  all about the food of which I have only one complaint and that is juste my own taste ... street corn is not roasted....once again my own thing but the toppings were spot on.... had burrito and chicken quesadilla with chips and salsa .... could have eaten that salsa all day....

I can't say too much about the service since it was a brief exchange but the taco was pretty delicious. The only gripe that I have is the pricing for a single taco, about $5. It definitely didn't fill my appetite but its probably one of the tastiest taco's I've had. Might try a burrito next time I'm there.",Yh0811X62OorELbMIByMjw,1,0,4,kqBBVyo6T1HaRABUAT_5yw

3432072,2018-05-22,0,IHoPEi8RltLLGzE3GrT8ww,The place is really nice but overall I don't like the food personally everyone has their own opinions though. I think it's way overpriced for cheap beans that you can buy at a grocery store and make yourself. The beans here are probably canned they do not have any good taste to them. The burrito here is about $8 dollars I rather spend that money at chipotle it's cheaper over there. The customer service isn't well either the workers do not say hi when coming in the restaurant or say bye to you. I hate to say this but I don't see myself or my family coming here again. I rather eat at chipotle or Taco Bell for the quality of food.,Bv3VulnfDI5B7ov-J2MBoA,1,0,1,oSt5PN5_CRGMtMZp-dCBMg
3754890,2018-01-27,3,IHoPEi8RltLLGzE3GrT8ww,"1/27/2018  I was glad to see that there was a new place close to my home and decided to give them a try.  I entered the place and there was about 30 people eating or waiting for their orders.  You order at the counter and you are given a ""beeper"" that alerts you to when your order is ready.  I ordered a beef burrito with a side order of refried beans.  I explicitly said I was hungry for refried beans and would like a large serving.  I also ordered a drink.  My total was $9.00 and change.  I filled my Styrofoam cup from the drink station and picked up my plastic knife and fork.  I was alerted that my order was ready in a reasonable amount of time and when I went to pick up my order, there was a lone burrito in a plastic basket lined with a thin paper and aluminum foil.  I asked where was my refried beans and they said they put them in my burrito.  I explained that wasn't how I ordered it but I would go ahead and accept it the way they fixed it.  My burrito was 90% beans with very little beef and a little sour crème and chopped tomato and onion.  Eating a burrito from a  plastic basket with plastic utensils on a sheet of foil is one of my least favorite ways to eat.  There were two squirt bottles on the table, one with red and the other with green sauce.  I try and give new places the benefit of doubt as I want them to succeed and I struggle with giving negative reviews, but it is what it is.  It's not the places fault but there were 3 different tables where children around the age of 4 or 5 would scream as loud as they could to either get attention or show their displeasure and the parents did little to teach them that behavior was not acceptable in a public place.  I was glad to get out of there quickly as parents not controlling their screaming children is at the top of my least favorite things.  I think that after getting my order wrong, that the  burrito was way over priced,  and serving food in a foil lined basket with plastic utensils, is what I have to say about Frijoles and Frescas.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,10,3,2,G7DFHv6bvgsOVTOfoC_vQg

I decided to give this place another try, and I am definitely glad I did. The carnitas taco was delicious and the mini quesadilla is an amazingly tasty bite of heaven.  Even their beans here have great flavor. The only thing I was not a huge fan of was the corn, a little bland for having so many components to make it flavorful.",wnE9JY_EPCzLq7ImPrDWgQ,0,0,4,0rRjWR0fbvlRZFF8-WfuwQ

I ordered bean cheese burrito cheese nachos
Steak quesadilla 
Burrito was not full but very watery
The nachos had a tiny about of white melted cheese on it
The steak quesadilla was very peppery and hardly any steak in it
Guacamole was 1/2 teaspoon serving as well as the sour cream inside
It was not worth the money
The place was dirty tables weren't washed down trash was over flowing
The cashier is rude not inexperience
also i forgot to mention. they use everything in blasket bins,plastic silverware
parents come and bring there kids,and they do scream and yell. there is no control. taco bell is better than here.",anwmW5m3Q_ZvDK50-RMGbw,2,0,1,_f-PcL9PNqnT7leJdSeh0A
5476407,2018-04-21,0,IHoPEi8RltLLGzE3GrT8ww,"I was pretty excited about this place because the food was similar to Los Tacos on Charleston and didn't require me to drive very far. With each visit, my experience keeps going downhill. Today we picked up food to go and when we got home, I opened up my tacos that I ordered with no cheese, and guess what? They had cheese. That's not the worst though. My sister opened up her chicken quesadilla and guess what? It had NO cheese! What kind of s*** is that! Definitely not a quesadilla lmao. Luckily we had some shredded cheese at home we were able to add to complete the quesadilla. Ill be probably be back again though for the cravings.",wQHXRErPkw148btN_GSkcA,0,0,3,t8DtDrOfcHDZGRjF6SuIaw
5488193,2018-05-13,0,IHoPEi8RltLLGzE3GrT8ww,"I recently went to their Nellis location and ordered a shrimp cocktail and a soda... a $20 tab. 

Upon getting my order, I thought ""f*** yea I'm eating at frijoles again"".  I was let down by the quality of the food. While the service is good. The food however, not so much. Maybe it just wasn't their day? Not sure.
It felt as if they threw Pico de Gallo in the cocktail juice.  The acidic taste from the Pico de Gallo and the the cocktail juice don't go together! Specially when Pico is sitting in their cold serv table.  The shrimp had a bland taste.  To top it off there wasn't enough avocado in the cocktail.   Not sure, I would come back to this place to spend another $20 on a shrimp cocktail.",CboFqXRLkckxYrhVcn0Gxw,1,0,3,UMqy72LJRw-k3LOkOI879Q
