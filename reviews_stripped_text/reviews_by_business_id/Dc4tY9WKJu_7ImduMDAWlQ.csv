We were seated immediately at the bar but then had to get the attention of a server to get drinks. After ordering we waited again for a server to bring warm miso soup that was nothing but soy bean paste.

Never saw the server again, my drink ran out and asked for a refill twice from other servers and never got one. 

Asked for the check (from another staff member) and waited 10 minutes to get it..... If i was a dishonest person, i just would have left, the staff did not seem to notice us anyway.",l6cX8Mc0N47hSqaSPi_sEw,4,0,1,O5B45HcIvHRy0ys7nqqyLA

Don't get me wrong sushi was amazing! The hulk roll was amazing and so fresh! I had same quality at sakana and it was ayce!! 60 bucks for 3 rolls and 2 nigiri!!! Great service though looks the same as when ""The Sushi"" was there it won't last unless it goes ayce that's the truth. I'm not saying the place is bad or anything trying to downgrade. But on here and other places it does say ayce sushi and I was on date I wasn't going to just leave and ruin my chances so I caved in and stayed!!",OUqdcv1V6qSIJEGypj--6w,0,1,3,KygyhtZET1PMko9vffl6og

There were only 2 tables occupied, the place was dead. Bad news is that Sushi Wabi is 30-50% higher priced than Naka, the menu was much weaker and the food wasn't nearly as good. Even the miso soup was thin and prepared poorly. I would encourage that owner and the cooks to eat at Naka, compare their respective quality and pricing then make some much needed internal changes if they want to stay in business.",lVAtdUDcwWexVCdQ3nwCig,1,0,2,xDtehCoIqxlIofQPkpgGCA
1119987,2017-11-16,2,Dc4tY9WKJu_7ImduMDAWlQ,"Tl;DR This place has managed to get worse after going out of business and reopening. 
This used to be our go to for AYCE. The service was always a bit lax and nothing really stood out as being special. It was convenient and reliably mediocre. That was before they shut down as ""The Sushi"" and became ""Sushi Wabi"". It is obvious that all of their money was spent on rebranding rather than hiring a real sushi chef. The real red flag was when we asked about AYCE. We were told they do not do AYCE, but they would do it for us so we could try them. It was like pulling teeth trying to define the terms of AYCE vs. you can eat all you want. It was like being offered a bad drug for a discount in the hopes you will buy more before you leave full of shame and regret. After our waiter watched with care as our wannabe sushi chef made our ahi poke, he returned with what was truly the worst excuse for a tuna roll. Frankly the sheer lack of pride and or enthusiasm for what they do soured whatever chance they had to make at the very least an ok time. They get half a star for being open and they get the other half for being close to a few better sushi places.",JdlOwAt5Wh9xW9kjyu17kA,0,0,1,M7N1qR52qPb9HXQpqxtOOw

My visit was a few months back, but other yelpers said it was AYCE which its not. I live quite far from here and the only reason I tried this place was because they were doing a 50% off all rolls deal. 

Service was friendly, but incredibly slow! We were the only table there and it took 20+ minutes for 3 rolls to come out. They were out of super white tuna so we ordered yellowtail which tasted strange. The water also tasted really off which I didnt drink after one sip and I will literally drink all restaurant water. 

The rolls were good but covered in sauce. I would say ask for all the sauce on the side. The one with the fried carrots on top was quite good. Another which I forget the name was not.

1814015,2017-12-08,0,Dc4tY9WKJu_7ImduMDAWlQ,"First thing to notice is they are completely empty but we were starving and wanted sushi.

2nd....nobody of Japanese or even Asian descent works there. They are Hispanic. When I asked about this because it is quite odd, the server said it's quite common. I told her I've been eating sushi longer than she's been on the planet and have never ever seen a restaurant with no Japanese servers.

Four of us began to order and a sushi order can have 10-15 different items, but genius Myra thinks she can remember them. I specifically asked her to write them down but she refused. That's when I knew I should have walked out but was with others, and we were in three cars so to go elsewhere would have been complicated.

So genius Myra starts bringing sushi in plates of two. Nobody in this place has any idea that they should put ALL the sushi ordered on one plate, and bring the chicken dish, and bring the rice sides all at the same time.

So while the two men ate the sushi, the ladies just sat there watching them.

Then my veggie sushi arrived, avocado & cucumber, and the cucumber was ice cold while the rice and avocado were room temp making this a strange combo.  I ordered two rolls, but she only brought one.

Then long after all the food was served, I'm like, Myra, where's my Miso soup?? Where's my fried rice. She brought the soup and said the rice was cooking.

After we were ALL finished eating, I said, hey Myra, where is my fried rice? She answered, oh it's cooking elsewhere.  Yeah ok Myra.

I totally call her out on forgetting two of my items because she didn't write them down and she has no reaction to this. She doesn't care at all. No apology. Just a blank stare.

No way no thanks.
The only benefit of this visit was to confirm my intuition that as soon as we were waited on my a non Japanese person and she refused to write out order down, this dinner was doomed.",1JW3rbxP2WpnXYOeMyKEWg,2,0,1,k0VU2CrYHROaHVeAnBfaQg

2399367,2017-12-03,0,Dc4tY9WKJu_7ImduMDAWlQ,"This place is amazing! It replaced, ""The Sushi"" and since its opening I believe in October my fiancé and I have become regulars! The price for the quality of sushi is fantastic! Typically I can only do one roll and prefer to not do all you can eat, and these rolls definitely do the trick! Specifically, I have had the Raiders Roll and the Miss Monica Roll, which were both phenomenal. As well as garlic tuna and yellowtail nigiri which both melted in my mouth, it was so good! 

Sushi chef and owner Nico does a great job interacting with his customers and delivering quality fresh fish that he personally picks up and checks out everyday. His attention to detail and the amount of flavor he has in each of his roles is insane! You can tell he is all about quality control and only serves the best. 

Also, don't let the yelp reviews fool you. The first week we went in this place was slammed, and everyone appeared happy and satisfied. There's something up with yelp because a couple of months ago this place had 4.5 deserved stars and I checked back recently to see they have removed majority of those for some reason. So what's up with that yelp?! 

Regardless, I hope future customers come to enjoy the deliciousness that is Sushi Wabi! Recently, our other go-to sushi bar Kabuki in Tivoli Village closed but we are happy to have Wabi to fill the void. Nico is an amazing chef and owner and everyone should check this place out, you won't regret it!

My friends and I went last night, not busy at all. One of my friends got there a few minutes before the rest of us, sat in a booth when we arrived neither waitress came to greet our table for roughly 20-25 minutes. I made eye contact as a 'hey we need something' gesture and still nothing. However they did acknowledge the fact we stood up and reseated ourselves at the sushi bar. Service was still extremely slow but at least we were being helped. Once the food started to come out and we finally had drinks the experience began to turn around. All and all the food was quite good but we couldn't get past the fact that beginning portion of the meal was so lack luster. Even when it came for the check, she set it on the table. I had my card in hand ready to pay for the entire meal to make it simple and nothing. She walked away. My boyfriend got up and followed her so we could just get out of there. I've worked in many areas of the service industry and what we went through last night was some of the most piss poor service I have experienced.

2965692,2018-07-01,0,Dc4tY9WKJu_7ImduMDAWlQ,"What a disappointment. Kept hearing about this from NextDoor so thought we would give it a try to support our neighbors. Waiter could not answer questions about the menu so tried guessing. When it was obvious that he was guessing I suggested he ask what a particular item was ra ther than guessing. He seemed nice but should definitely learn the menu and items before working in a restaurant where many may have questions. There were three of us- I pointed at the item on the menu and even asked if the soup (Pork Ramen) came with noodles. Waiter thought that Tonkasu and apparently ordered that. Another ordered Chicken Teriyaki plate. Came with miso soup and small salad. Chicken Teriyaki comes plain on the plate- a sliced piece of white meat chicken with sauce on it- not even a garnish on the plate. Also ordered a special roll with spicy tuna and a few other things in it. Had Gyoza which were acceptable but rather burnt and took over twenty minutes to arrive. The waiter never came to refill our waters. He would disappear and then someone else would ask if everything was ok but it wasn't since we did not get our food or got served the wrong items FOUR times. I NEVER GOT what I ordered. The manager came over to try to help out but simply would go back and bring out something awhile later which was not what we ordered but apparently what the waiter ordered. It was a disaster. During one of the times the manager came by I told her about the NextDoor and she said she would take off 25% for that. Later, after getting the wrong food four times and me never getting my order she took 20% off the check ( gyoza, chicken teriyaki and special spicy tuna roll) which was still $30.00 for only two of the three of us getting our meal. POORLY HANDLED TO SAY THE LEAST. SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPED FOR WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. NO- NEIGHBORS- I DON'T PLAN ON RETURNING.",bjh-_mYDMXRvMY55-kVrqQ,0,0,1,S6a1mNo9cLgMGwfIg9TMFQ

""The Sushi"" was amazing: great chefs, good ambiance, fantastic service.  Tonight the door had a new sign, but same menu which was suspect.  The place was very loud and busy, like a family and friends party at the bar.  We got our drinks (water) and ordered a couple AYCE items.  Seaweed salad and gyoza were fine, but once our nigiri came out (not exactly what we ordered but hey, close enough) we still were waiting on plates, wasabi, soy sauce, etc. We attempted multiple times to flag anyone down to no avail (just to ask for some plates and wasabi) but were awkwardly avoided.

No kidding 15 minutes goes by and we're still trying to flag someone down the whole time.  The nigiri is just sitting there while waving and attempting to flag down anyone working.  15+ minutes with no service at an AYCE is terrible.  Empty waters, no service, nothing to eat our sushi with.  Meanwhile the party at the bar continues with the chefs doing shots with friends at the bar.  Our maybe waiter who greeted and sat us was polite and running around trying to keep up with the 4-5 other tables, but continued to avoid us even after saying he would be ""right back"" 15 or so minutes after we flagged him down. 

Bottom line, this place needs to get their game together if they want to stay open.  As locals, we'll never go back.  It's too bad ""The Sushi"" closed and was replaced by this joke.",Ke7qM-y2eJSkAywCgaDnrQ,8,2,1,Igm5bdkxij2uAmvZOF48kw

As we walked in, I noticed the place was very quiet even though it was a weekend. They were only 2 customers on the bar at 6pm. Suprisingly the food wasn't bad.

The menu was limited and majority of 2 pages of sushi were fried. If you like your sushi fried this would be a good place. We felt this place wasn't as authentic because we are used to more unique Japanese food. The sushi we ate were actually pretty fresh. 
We had Jt and Lee's Special roll. Also Smelt roe and Tempura Udon soup. The soup comes with a salad. Their house sake was hot, no cold sake.

I didn't check in on Yelp but I noticed later there is a $10 off on $45.

4012322,2018-04-15,2,Dc4tY9WKJu_7ImduMDAWlQ,"This place is no good and I think it shows as we came in to an empty restaurant.  I would say the sushi spot across the street by the dance studio is better.

This place used to have a different name but is now called Sushi Wabi, the only spot used to be AYCE but Sushi Wabi is NOT AYCE anymore.  No big deal, my favorite sushi place in Vegas isn't AYCE.  

We literally had the option to sit anywhere but maybe two tables in the restaurant because it was slow on a weekend dinner service.  Throughout service we'll find out why.  

They bring out cucumber as an appetizer but ours had random stuff on it from the cooks glove from a different sushi or prep.  They weren't on top of water or soda refills throughout the evening.

One of my order wasn't made until all of our other dishes were served because the cook could not read the servers handwriting.  I think the server was more on a rush to clock out than complete the food service.  So the late order was a banked roll.  It came out with the cream cheese still in a block and the middle of the roll still cold.  Maybe the cook was in a rush to get out an incomplete meal because we were waiting awhile for it.

The scallop nigiri tasted OLD and the sauce they serve with the gyoza was more tart and tangy that what I'm used to.  The California roll also was more MAYO than crab meat.  Sushi Wabi needs to get their act together.

I wouldn't suggest coming here.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,4,1,2,0YwerAFyjVSk_hFWDRnfdA

Since then I have eaten there two more times. We got some great service and fresh fish. I found my sushi placr,e1Cpg08H7wREMDIJqPV90A,0,0,5,_hDANcQ8FZqonmmGnmIeOw

Even though we went during lunch hour, there were only a few people there. Our waiter was MOA most of the duration of our time there. We had to ask more than once for eating utensils.  Original ginger and wasabi wasn't enough for one person, let alone two.  We had to ask for more.  It took awhile to get our food, but it was good.  Waiter kept going to back of restaurant so if we needed anything we had to wait until he came forward.  No offers to refill drinks.

We had the ""I Love Jane"" roll, the ""Linda"" roll, ""Screaming Orgasm"", Halibut with spicy ponzu, Yellowtail, Blue Fin Tuna, and shrimp.  All were exceptional.  They do not offer AYCE which has evidently disappointed some people.  However, we prefer a higher end sushi experience and Sushi Wabi was it.  If you sit at the bar, the chefs will do their best to accommodate your requests. Don't be shy.  Tell them what you like.

The place was empty when we arrived (it was empty last time too -- hmmmm). I ordered sashimi which came out relatively quickly. My husband ordered a hot dish which took probably 20+ minutes to come out. When it did, the rice was cold, the soup was cold and the meat was dry. The waiter had just started yesterday so he wasn't quite on board yet. The ""piece de resistance"" was that they couldn't get the POS system to work. Normally we pay by credit card but fortunately we had enough cash to pay the check. My husband is normally a big tipper but he barely left anything. Needless to say, we won't be returning.
