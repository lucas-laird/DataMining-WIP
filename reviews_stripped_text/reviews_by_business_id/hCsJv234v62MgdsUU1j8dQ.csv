Until one day me and my cousins just decided to try it.. We order our food, and then when it arrives, delicious! Thats all I could think of while eating their oyster rockefeller and calamari! Those 2 I highly recommend. I look forward to coming back here soon and trying out their other dishes..

Well I finally decided to eat there. 
Started off with a bowl of new england clam chowder. I must say it was pretty good. Not to thick, not to runny and a good amount of clams. 
Had the fish n chips, made with halibut (a flatfish of the genus Hippoglossus from the family of the right-eye flounders). AWESOME!!! Best that I've had since i was in Ventura years ago. 
One of my friends had the pan fried oysters with pico de gallo and offered me one. It was good, but would not order myself.

Here we go, on our way to Big Sur Oyster Bar. We arrive to Palace Station casino and we go on our way to look for the spot. I had imagined that it would be a sit down type of restaurant but it was a little more kick back then that. Hence the words oyster BAR. I would say about 8  seats total so on a busy day, you more than likely would have to wait a long. 

Looking at the menu we weren't too sure to get but ended up getting the pan roast because it seemed pretty popular. Along with that we ordered the New England clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, half dozen rockefeller oysters and a dozen fresh oysters with complimentary bread. 

The pan roast (mixed seafood served with rice) took a while to make but the cool thing about it was that they make it right in front of your face. It took slightly longer because they had so many orders of it ahead of us considering the fact that there were only three cookers for pan roasts. Getting a little impatient while waiting, we just kept nibbling on the bread. The pan roast finally done and it was SO WORTH the wait. SO GOOD and so FILLING! We had to take home leftovers but it even tasted as good as good as it was first served. 

Catch this spot on a not so busy day and you will be satisfied!",8R_wUo73Aba1-pnuKnqfOQ,5,0,5,KT_yeL3A3JTIBM9Vh-eDvw

Dozen raw oysters.  Dozen clams on a half shell.  I would say that the clams were better at Palace Station just for the fact that they were larger but the Oysters were better here.

I've had the  crab pan roast at both of these places and both are very good.  
The difference between the two is, the Palace Station version is very rich and you can specify the heat level.  Big Sur's version is not as rich but you need to add your own hot sauce from the table.  Since it is not as rich, it has a more pronounce crab flavor.  

I would definitely go here on my next visit to Vegas.",8HSPqescPcwOmQ6sQ3-TTg,0,0,4,ZMdcYcVVxpoR-I9v9sZ3cA

My date & I were in the mood for some oysters after catching a movie at the South Point & she mentioned that Big Sur was pretty good. It was around 8ish & it was fairly busy. However, there was still plenty of seating, but we opted to sit at the bar. 

After taking our seats, they immediately brought out some delicious bread & butter. I was so ready to devour it all!! I started with the Manhattan clam chowder. It was definitely good! Although, I could do without the giant cracker/wafer that they serve sticking out of the bowl. My date had the Boston clam chowder, which was pretty good, but not as good as mine ;) She also ordered the GIANT shrimp cocktail. No joke, those were some GIANT scrimps!! 3 to be exact. We also ordered calamari & a half dozen raw oysters. The calamari was ok, but I probably would not order it again. The oysters were great & about medium size. 

The prices were ok I guess, about what you might expect for eating seafood at a casino. The service was pretty decent & the staff seemed friendly. I will definitely go back, for the Manhattan chowder & oysters alone. I definitely want to try the lobster grilled cheese next time!

I'm so happy i discovered this place one day when there was no place to go grab some food about 12 in the midnight. I was staying at our timeshare at the Grandview and was really hungry. Everything there was far from the strip, so we decided to pass across the street and ended up at South Point. And i'm telling you, i regret NOTHING!

There was not much on the menu. They gave us bread and butter which is alright. I didn't really expect getting those, i see that place more of a fast food bar than a restaurant kind of bar. It was an open bar, alongside the casino. The hostess and the employees are nice because when i asked them what to get, they were nice enough to describe everything on the menu.

 I didn't know what to order first, so i ordered fried oysters for appetizer. It was really good! Crispy on the outside, and fresh and soft on the inside, fried to perfection!
And then i saw this couple eating this stew with noodles and tomato-ey soup, loaded with seafood. It looked really good so i undoubtedly asked them and ordered the same thing. It was called CIOPINNO. It was a HUGE bowl! I mean, one bowl is good for two. I was with my aunt and she shared with me. We didn't even get to finish the whole thing! It's an authentic Italian dish, typically stew/ creamy soup with clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and squid. For the size, i think it was really worth it. I just don't like the fact that i have to go all the way to Southeast pass the strip just to get it.

It came with chips, and was big. I'd recommend it. Each of us got a roll as well.
The only downer was the hostess/supervisor. she stands at the front desk, you'd think as a hostess but when we walked up, not a ""hello"", not a ""hi"", not a how are you... all she said was ""bar or table"". I said table and she pointed at an open table. Guess it would be too hard for her to smile. Also, she never smiled. So at the end, I went to pay. She is the one that you pay. Not a smile, not a pleasantry. I noticed at this time that her name tag (which was upside down) that she was a restaurant supervisor. A white lady, thin, black hair. Nothing but a scowl on her face. Too bad. I'm shocked really that our server was so upbeat and smiling as he has to deal with her all day. But the food and server were great.

I had a chance to talk to the chef and I asked him how does he do it and he said its a family recipe his name is Jose....... And he said he makes 200 pounds every two days and they sell out faster than he can make the next batch

1747622,2012-05-30,0,hCsJv234v62MgdsUU1j8dQ,"I do believe that I have visited the Big Sur Oyster Bar on every Vegas trip for the past 8 or 9 years. Not ever writing a review until now, I have never thought about why I ALWAYS go there. Guess it could be the great food. Guess it could be the great service. Guess it could be the cool atmosphere. I guess, no, I know, its all of the above.

OK, lets start with the atmosphere. The restaurant is located inside the South Point Hotel next to the Garden Buffet and has al fresco style seating with an open ""bar"" where all the food is prepared (You can sit at the bar or on tables). I like this concept because you can people watch and it is open and airy.

Next is the service. The service is quite good, the waitstaff are attentive and efficient. Although, if you order certain alcoholic drinks, they have to leave the confines of the restaurant to get it from the casino bar.

Last is the best part of this place; the food. Big Sur rivals any coastal eatery as far as seafood goes and it's in the middle of the desert! My personal favorites and obvious must-haves are the Steamed Clams in White Wine and Garlic (more bread is a must for sopping up all that delicious broth! That, or a straw!), Fried Calamari with Marinara (Crisp and tender), New England Clam Chowder (nice and thick served with a 5"" cracker disc),   and the Seafood Diavolo/Cioppino (they're actually two separate dishes but quite similar in taste, one spicy and the other with more seafood types). Some other dishes that I have recently tried and added to my faves are the Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters (hopefully BP oil-free), Oysters Rockefeller, and the Beer Battered Shrimp and Scallops (crispy, savory goodness!). The 1 1/2 lbs. of Steamed King Crab Legs are pretty good too.

Prices to me are a scosche high, but if you have a players card with some credit on it, you can use it towards your tab which can ease the hit on the wallet. We always eat family style and walk outta there stuffed and satisfied, so its a decent value for us. Overall, a good way to get something quick to eat so you can get back to losing? all your money in the casino! I kid, South Point....relax!! Here's a plug to make up for that last remark: For a good time, stay at South Point Hotel and casino!!",iqT0nLolv2HcUmm26jsW7Q,2,0,5,28vtK4wHSRcU4G_vO0T-Ww

With 30 minutes to closing, we ordered only a half dozen of their Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a crab and shrimp pan roast. 

The oysters were the best I've had in Vegas. They were plump and super cold. The jumbo shrimp cocktail is exactly that, J-U-M-B-O! They looked like they were on steroids. The order only comes with three but that's all you need. The pan roast was comforting. I loved the tomato butter sauce! 

The cashier who took our order didn't seem to mind that we walked in so close to their closing time but when my others friends came 5 minutes til', she apologized that they couldn't order anymore because her system locks at midnight and her cooks were already working overtime. Bummer! At least she let them sit at the bar to eat any of our leftovers.

We were promptly seated and immediately given bread and water. The bread was great- warm and toasty with the butter packets wrapped up so that it was nice and soft and super spreadable (small detail, I know, but one that is so often overlooked that it's noticeable when done right). 

The promptness and attentiveness of the service remained consistent for the duration of our visit. 

We ordered oysters in two forms- straight up and Rockefeller. The Oysters Rockefeller were rich and buttery, basically tasted like a cheesy spinach dip on top of an oyster. However, nothing beats the real, straight up deal. The oysters tasted really fresh and clean and elevated by the horseradish and cocktail sauce. 

We found $15 for a dozen to be a great value, especially considering that a half dozen goes for $13 (translation: don't order the half dozen and shell out the extra two bucks!)

We plan to go back for more oysters and for some crabs (there's a special for 1 1/2 pounds of legs for $16.99).

There were muscles, clams, shrimp, etc., but only one kind of oyster. Beer and wine is served here, but if you want something else, your server will go to the casino bar and get it for you. 

Our server was amazing. Unfortunately, I did not get here name. She was very, very organized. All I can tell you is she was an older lady with dark hair. Since I wasn't that hungry, I opted for a cup of clam chowder and Ceviche for my main dish. One of my friends ordered the Ahi Tuna wrap and the other ordered the seafood platter. My clam chowder was really good. Nice an creamy, but not overly clammy. The Ceviche comes in a martini glass. It was not overly filling, but still flavorful. You have to dig to the bottom of the glass to get to the good stuff. (i.e. the avocado) My only complaint is that there were no chips to scoop up all the good stuff. The Ahi Tuna wrap looked good. It was huge. I think you are given a whole tuna. lol The seafood platter looked good as well. It came with two oysters, two prawns, a crab claw, and some clams.

We started off with the New England Clam Chowder which was really nice and hearthy; with big chunks of potatos and clams.

Next, We had the Louisiana Oysters.  These suckers were plump, juicy and flavorful.  We gave them a nice soaking of lemon juice, a dab of horseradish and cocktail sauce.  

**Warning**  The waitress warned us not to go too crazy with the horseradish because it packs a punch.  And she wasn't kidding.  My buddy Alan was the first victim.  He had a nice big chunk of horseradish work his head over. Alan grimaced like he just sucked down a 64oz Big Gulp in 5 seconds.  I was the next, as I caught a chunk hitting directly at the back of my throat, sending a nice burning shot to my face.  No, i'm not crying...  Man, that was some good stuff.  I had to mix in some of that stuff into the chowder.

Lastly, we had the Soft Shelled Crab Po Boy.  And that sandwich did not disappoint.  The soft shelled crab was big and meaty.  Plus the batter crust was awesome.  I could of downed a few of these bad boys alone, without the rest of the sandwich.

We got to sit at the bar area, so we watched the chefs working away right in front of us.  Most of the stuff looked really good.  We saw them cook up a couple batches of Oyster Rockafellers.  Oh man, we should of got some of those.  For sure next time!!

My husband and I always take visiting relatives here, especially when we encourage them to stay at the South Point Hotel. I usually get the Seafood Diavolo, and always the calamari appetizer. Unfortunately, after my experience last night, I will never be back. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and the only thing that was subpar was the crab and avocado salad. Last night, my mom (who is visiting from California) and I met my aunt and uncle and cousin from Hawaii here since they are staying at the hotel. I told them they had to try it because it was surprisingly delicious. I ordered calamari for the table, which was extremely rubbery in texture. I was the only one eating it after everyone tried a piece. My mom had some clam chowder which was obviously decent. We decided to share the TWENTY-SIX dollar lobster grilled cheese. It was nothing close to a grilled cheese. The bottom piece of bread was so soggy, the inside contents of the ""grilled cheese"" seemed to have little or no cheese, and it tasted awful. I honestly do not believe that there was any real lobster inside. For the side, it came with stale kettle chips that seem to be house made...maybe earlier in the week? My cousin ordered the crab for $29 which came out barely warm, with an unlit candle for the butter sauce. My aunt had fish and chips which also came out hardly warm fries, and luckily the fish was hot. My uncle had the scampi and he said it was good. Our service was nothing special and we never received any refills. The calamari came out so late that it wasn't really considered an appetizer. I felt bad that my aunt and uncle insisted on picking up the bill, but I was more so embarrassed that I had told them to try this place more than once, and the quality of the food and service was pretty awful. I am very disappointed. I feel bad for people who stay here and decide to ""splurge"" on a decent meal, since the prices aren't very reasonable. I still am in shock that the grilled cheese was so bad and came with stale kettle chips for almost $30. It should be removed from the menu ASAP.",RphrCucIVsfQ86vEcT-ZAQ,0,0,1,tbCVr8uzeZ6mj32h16gIOw

We all get together and feast on fresh oysters, crab meat served in a martini glass and crispy calamari.  
For entrees everyone's favorite dish is the Seafood Diavolo, a combination of shrimp, scallops and lobster served in a spicy sauce. And for those that don't care for spicy food like me, I prefer the cioppino, a combination of shellfish, fish, calamari
with a little bit of linguini in a light tomato
broth although nothing beats the cioppino at the Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco. The Pan Roast is another favorite if you love rice with seafood. You can order cocktails and beer and the waiter orders it from the casino bar. 
Pricey menu  but they serve good portions.
I gave it a 4 star for consistency in flavor, taste, fresh seafood, fast service, and the location 
of the oyster bar. You see  all the casino activities and traffic. It's quite festive.

My fiance and I decided to grab some appetizers here before watching a movie.  I ordered a calamari and dozen oysters.  This was exactly what I said: calamari and a dozen oyster.  We got our calamari first.  It was good.  However, we then got fried oysters.  We immediately turned away and said that we did not order fried oyster since we ordered dozen oysters.  The kitchen staff said that it says fried oysters on our order but took back the order and will put in the order for the dozen oysters (FYI - we did not even let the kitchen staff leave the plate of fried oysters with us so we never touched it).  Michael, our waiter, came to us and said that we ordered fried oysters.  He wrote down calamari and fried oysters.  I clarified that I said dozen oyster.  I don't think that I would mistake saying dozen oysters with fried oysters.  Michael then went away.  After some time, Michael came back with the hostess.  She tells us that she can't remove the charge for the fried oysters since we ordered it.   Umm, are you serious?  We started to argue that we did not order fried oysters at all. My fiance argued that it doesn't even say in menu that the fried oysters come in dozen.  The menu lists those food as the following (there was no description):

Pan-Fried Oysters with Pico de Gallo

Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters 
Half Dozen
Dozen

Well, the hostess snapped at my fiance to not raise his voice.  Umm, hellooo!  You are the one who started the scene by basically accusing us of ordering the wrong thing or something.  It was just so ridiculous.  Luckily, two female kitchen staff members jumped in the conversation.  They told us not to worry that we will not be charged for the fried oysters.  However, we then told them that the hostess is actually saying that we do have to pay for it.  They said that's not right and that we should not have to pay for it.  They went to talk to the chef.  He went to the hostess and cleared it up with her to remove the charge.  I really appreciate those ladies and wished that I got their names.  They kept on telling us that we are right and that they apologized.  The hostess and Michael never apologized.  I was just so upset of being blamed so the meal was totally ruined and part of my Christmas eve.  

I just don't understand why this even became a big deal.  Maybe Micheal thought that he heard fried instead of dozen.  Maybe I didn't enunciate dozen clearly enough so that it sounded like fried.  It is a very loud open restaurant right smack in the casino.  Whatever the case, Michael, why were you so stuck on accusing me?   Do you really think that I could mistake saying dozen with fried or that I was trying to get out of my order of fried oysters for fresh oysters?  We didn't try getting out of paying for the fresh oysters, which are more expensive.  I just can't believe that I was even put in this situation.  Whatever the case, we will not be coming back.

We got seated in the front, not really an ""ambience"" place, but the food and service were awesome.
We ordered 2 glasses of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio to start, picture does not show full serving, I had several sips.  That was filled nearly to the rim. YUM.
Hubby does not eat seafood, so we were both authorized 2 appetizers plus entrees and two alcoholic drinks.  I got a cup of New England clam chowder.  It was delicious!  Picture shows...I added the pepper. 
Only thing hubby could order was a chicken sandwich due to the lack of anything else not fish or seafood.  Our FANTASTIC  waiter offered to substitute chicken instead of shrimp scampi and hubby was SO happy!  He loved his meal.  I had the 1 1/2 lbs of king crab legs and they were awesome!

I was in agreement because I saw the large menu over the bar proclaiming various offerings like oyster po'boys and jamabalya for $7.95.  Good deal, right?

Wrong. This was for weekday lunch only. some of the things are not even available for dinner, and if  they were, the price was about triple.

We both ordered the fish and chips. ($23) Her bf got the shrimp and scallop combo.
($21). Ahem. In what universe are shellfish cheaper? I was assuming it would be a monstrous portion of gigantic fillets at that price point. You know what happens when we assume. 

There were four small chunks of battered fish atop  a pile of fries.  They were all crisp and hot, and the fish was nice and white, but come ON! 

I have no idea what kind of fish it was, but for that price tag, it damned better have been cut from a mermaid's tail.  And there was no accompaniment like salad or cole slaw either. Only spotting of anything green was pickle specks in the tartar sauce.

Could they be charging for the ambience? Well, considering the fact that it's cafe style seating in an open area of the incredibly loud, bustling casino, I'm guessing not.

The waiter was very sweet and seemed almost sheepish. I'd be embarrassed to bring the check, too, buddy, and I come from a long line of unscrupulous carpet merchants.

It was one of those occasions where you're forced to balance the scales however you can; up to and including scooping the entire contents of the cracker basket into your purse and leaving it all right on top, daring any intrepid employee to say a word.

I absolutely luv the lobster grilled cheese here- you almost crave it - if you have it - lobster so sweet and the cheese complimenting every bite- this is  a must have!

The crab legs are always good here, i don't know what they do to them but its a sweet salty combo when eating them. 

Oyster Rckefeller, hmm last time I ate something this great was at the ACME Oyster house in New Orleans (which is a must as well) - super d lish full of flavor and just melts into your mouth - i could probably eat about 2 dozen of these by themselves!

I tried the steamed clams in white wine sauce, these were okay - a bit smaller than what I had expected. but still real good.

Another must have, my friend had the Ciopinno and it was to die for! super flavorful and jsut everybite  the flavor jumped out even more!

The prices were as you would expect in a seafood resaraunt not cheap but not too expensive.

The best Pan Roast in Las Vegas.  It is full of seafood, shrimp, crab meat over a tomatoe base rice.  I've eaten here over 20 times and each time the food has never disappointed.

The NE clam chowder is creamy and sweet.  The Manhattan clam chowder is great and I would recommend.

I start with the lump crab cocktail.  They have a special mayo/mustard sauce that hits on every note.  It is sweet, savory with a hint of mustard on the back of the palate.  Great start!

I usually get the Cioppino and my wife gets the Pan Roast.  The Pan Roast is flavorful and a mouth full of seafood with each bite.  You get the sweet from the seafood, a dash of  another creaminess from the tomatoe base on the rice and kiss of wine on the back end of the bite.  Delicious.

The Cioppino is full of seafood and you can taste a whiff of the ocean with each morsel.  Lobster, clams, mussels..you name it.  It was better than the Cioppino at the Italian restaurant located here at South Point.

The seafood Diavolo is great and spicy and the Linguini and Clams is a can't miss also.  Never had a bad meal here in all my times.

To begin, the hostess/cashier barely greeted us and just pointed over to the bar area. The server that we had was non-attentive and was more interested in talking about plumbing with the guests next to us than asking us how we were doing. Nto even once. He was good at refilling our drinks though, lol. The hostess walked others to their seat yet we only got a point?

The bread was very chewy, but I liked the butter. Haha. Very spreadable. I was really disappointed in what we had ordered.

My friend had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and that was the only decent food item we had. He also got the Lobster Grilled Cheese because I had informed him that many Yelpers were fond of it. I took a bite and it was horrific. The lobster was tastless, only made with butter. The bread had lots of butter. It was just butter over-dose. 

I ordered the Louisiana Oysters and after the first one, I didn't even want to finish them but I did. It did not taste fresh at all. I actually went here because I was craving crab soooo bad. I got the 1 1/2 lb of crab for $20. Tastless. Maybe if they would have steamed the crab instead of just boiling it then I would have liked it much better. Not even my lemon peppered sauce concoction made it worthwhile to eat.  

The disappointing part was that the chef was checking up on us and giving us real customer service much more than anyone else there. 

When we had went to pay, the hostess/cashier looked at us. Then her phone rang. She proceeded to answer her phone and ignored us until she was done with her call. When my credit card did not read as she swiped it, I asked if she could input it manually. Then she said she would have to write down my credit card number. WHAT? 

I would not go back to this bar and would never recommend it to anyone since you are over-paying for mediocre seafood and the worst service I have ever experienced.",E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,3,2,1,s9Jx7ONM6WlZ1QZZadnTKA

Pan roast was definately smaller than we expected but, delicious nonetheless. It's not like Palace Stations' pan roasts so, don't expect anything of that caliber here. 
And just a note, the rice they serve with the gumbo/pan roast is the boxed rice...as an Asian who loves her rice, this was a semi-problem.

One bowl of soup will cost you $8.00 but they bring you warm sourdough rolls that will most definitely soak up all the leftover alcohol dwindling in your body.. delicious!

Unfortunately for them (and the diners), everything appeared to be made from being frozen. Everything looked that way. I was hoping for something fresh. I guess my hopes were too high for a casino restaurant.

1. 2 dozen half shell oysters:  they were fresh and were all opened in front of us.  Not sure what type of oysters they were, but they were the appetizer size oysters.  They were bigger than normal, which is a plus.

2. 1 dozen clams: again, not sure what type of clams they were, but they were smaller than I thought they would be.  The good thing about them is that they were very tasty.  Just give it a little dab of tabasco but no lemon and you're good to go.  

3. 1 1/2 lb. of Snow Crab legs:  this is the dish that eventually didn't make this review a 5 star review.  Why? Because the legs are previously frozen and already cooked, BUT the way they reheat them was dumping them into boiling water.  This causes the flavors to go away because it was being soaked in the water.  If they were to steam them, it would've been much better.

Good enough for us because we were craving these dishes all day!

Hope this helps and Enjoy!!!",9fbvO9EY_1SotbeIhbhxWw,2,1,4,4sFxcDjvY4Aluqmm7cblkA

[Apps]
Louisiana Oysters: not that impressed with their oysters. I've definitely have had fresher tasting stuff. I didn't think these were worth ordering.
Calamari: Great app, but that was expected with something fried.
Oyster Rockafeller: These were pretty much the same oysters as before, but masked wit a buttery spinach spread. I felt like I was eating spinach dip on a shell. Couldn't even taste the oyster.
Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters: Nothing impressive

For the entrée, I ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese. It was an ok dish, but overly slathered with butter. It probably would have been a little better 
with more cheese melted into it. Lots of lobster meat in this sandwich though, which was very good. The homemade chips that it came with had a nice crisp to it, but it had a tad bit too much salt

All in all, it was a pretty mediocre meal. I can't see myself coming back here. There are far better alternatives in Vegas. Initially, we came here just to down some fresh oysters, but that ended up being the worst part of the meal.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,2,2,3,NQ8hjfE_s2TEQDsH3Hr6DQ

I had the gumbo @ $17.00 (wild rice, shrimp, sausage, chicken, okra), which was pretty good but not as good as palace or station's (but better than cheesecake factory). The flavor was really good and had thick sauce (traditional). It has less seafood than the palace/station version which explains the lower price. The shrimp and chicken were pretty good size, though. The hard rolls were very good. I like that there is a cracker basket with a variety of crackers, ritz, saltines, including oyster crackers (love it).   

It wasn't spicy (like a little heat) but Cookie (our server) gave us Cholula. She was really good- refilled his drink without my husband asking. She was very friendly, always had a smile on her face and would check on us periodically.

My husband got the crab and shrimp pan roast and enjoyed it (but his favorite is still palace). There were a couple crab shells that he would of preferred to not have. 

The bill for both of us was $38, which was pretty good.

After reading the other reviews, I am curious to try the linguine with clams and the fish and chips next time. The special was 1 1/2 pounds of crab legs for $16.95- a lot of people ordered that.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,2,4,VN_VeEwyt8K6jdogVZylfQ

As for the other items on the menu. They are just ok. Probably something you can get anywhere. Nothing stands out or is super amazing. 

Salmon Cesar salad: the salmon was really fishy. Waaaay too much dressing on the lettuce. 

Linguini with clams in red sauce: if you look at my picture, everything is pretty much swimming in the sauce. This was pretty much a soup with noodles and clams. The sauce was a little on the bland side. I had to put some Tabasco sauce to give it some kick. The noodles and clams were good though. 

New England clam chowder: thick and rich. Lots of potatoes and big pieces of clam mixed in. I would order this again.

4512473,2018-06-19,0,hCsJv234v62MgdsUU1j8dQ,"So I'm reviewing the raw oysters mostly with some consideration for the place as a whole.

I came here after searching the web for good oyster deals in Las Vegas.  It's not the greatest place and separate from all other casinos.  So I was hoping for the best.

Alas, it was not to be.  I walked up to a mostly empty restaurant on an early Monday evening and was seated right up front in the bar.  I asked the guy behind the counter if they had an oyster that was large and briny as I like a strong salty, seafood-like flavor.  He showed me what they had and they were sizeable sure enough.

And even though I missed Happy Hour (before 4PM), I ordered a dozen anyways.  A dozen for $27.  Not outrageous but not a happy hour price either.

My spidey sense was tingling because they had that kinda orangy clam like color to them.  They also looked a bit dense much like clams do too.  But still, I was hoping for the best.

Unfortunately, they were completely tasteless.  They were called Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters.  I had to dump a bunch of seafood sauce on each one just to taste something other than a cold lump of goo in my mouth.

I know most people don't like briny, salty oysters.  But that's my thing and a reason some gals like me.  At least they were fresh and very cold (well stored).

A customer sitting next to me asked how I like them and I told him the truth.  He said he was having the chowder and said it was good.  I peered down the counter and saw a couple eating.  The lady had the Alaskan crab legs and unless they were dry, it's hard to go wrong there since they are shipped pre-cooked and frozen from Alaska.  They looked ok.  That's why you should buy Alaskan crab from Costco and not a 5* dining establishment.

The waiter asked how I liked them.  I told him the truth.  He made a sad frown but did not offer to get a manager or make any kind of amends.

I asked him if I could've ordered one or three instead of the dozen and he said yes.  I asked how much each would be if I ordered one or three and he said $3 each.  I was yelled, ""THREE DOLLARS FOR THESE?""

Realizing how loud I was, I chilled out, paid the bill and left.

If you like salty, briny oysters, this is NOT your place to go to.  I go all around Vegas looking for the best oyster deal and for what I'm looking for, this is NOT it.  

This place is getting two stars only because the guy next to me looked happy with his chowder and the place was clean and quick (I've been to empty places that took forever, god knows why).

My normal go to is the new-ish oyster bar in the Hard Rock.  I've never seen it have a line.  They usually have at least 4 different types of orders.  They are open to 2A on Friday and Saturday (to 12A all other days).  They don't have a happy hour.  But so far this is the place to beat.

I have tried their Oysters, Crab Legs, Manhattan clam chowder, Lobster Grilled Cheese and their Cioppino.  Omg Cioppino is to die for, but let me get back to that. 


Oysters, can't pass it up, you're at an Oyster bar.  They crack it fresh right in fornt of you.  Honestly, for crab legs, you are better off going to a buffet.  Manhattan clam chowder and their New England Clam chowder are delicious.  Reminds me of Bay Area when you go to eat the Clam Chowder bowls, but thier chowder is chunkier!  

I love their Lobster Grilled Cheese, I think its very expensive though, but then again it is Lobster.  I remember it used to be about $18, I think, but when I went there this past weekend to fulfull my craving the price was right around the $30 mark, think I'll have to pass this time.  

So on to the Cioppino.  I must have missed this, or it could be a new menu, but I could see that everyone was dining on some monstrous bowls.  We took my friend here and as he ate the Cioppino he kept saying ""Mmmm, OMG, Wow, Oooh, this is great..."" LOL, so we had to come back to try it ourselves.  

Um, yes, we were spewing those same words.  Its a $31 bowl of goodness, big portions for two, maybe even three to share.  Mussels, Calamari, HUGE Scallops, shrimp, and lobster sitting on a bed of linguini in this delicious tomato based sauce.  Seriously, I'm not often a pasta eater, but today, man was I glad I agreed to have pasta that day.  We shared the bowl and still had leftovers.  I'm telling you, its that good.

Our server Emmanuel (I believe that's his name), is the worse server ever. Our first experience with him, he gets our order wrong because he doesn't bother to write it down. When our food came out, the chef had to take it back and remake it. We are by far not difficult customers but I am clear on what I want, like for instance, rice instead of pasta? Come on.

This last time, my boyfriend and I decided on a bowl of clam chowder and the catch of the day. Our soup never came out. When our entree came out, I told the chef to cancel the soup. He confronted the server about not bringing out our soup and we hear the entire conversation. Instead of the server taking responsibility for the soup, he says, they didn't tell me. As a server, a soup is a starter. In this case, we only ordered one entree, but if he was confused, he should have asked if we wanted the soup first or at the same time. The soup is ready to scoop at any time. How can the entree be brought out first? After that, he never came to check on us. He took his mistake out on us. Like I said, this is not our first encounter with him. He saw we finished our meal and didn't say anything to us, just printed the receipt and placed it in front of us. I did not want to deal with him anymore so brought the receipt to the hostess and paid there. First time ever I did not tip in a restaurant. As many times as I have had bad service, I still felt bad and still left a little, but in this case, he was so rude and did not care so neither did I.

We were so unsatisfied with our service and meal that we went upstairs to the bowling area and got two hot dogs and a pretzel to eat while playing bingo.

The catch of the day was the orange roughy and it really lacked in salt. I tasted nothing from the fish or the sauce on it. I didn't know if it was just me so I asked my boyfriend and he said he didn't taste anything as well, just felt the warmth of the food.

Ughh, I'm frustrated because I want to like this place but I just can't. I probably will never be back after this experience. I hope the South Point does something about the service here.",jKrYE0ls8o2zCFYHubihsw,0,0,1,i5NH-Pi_wHnwKAfPAF7-_A

food was pretty good both times. we had: 

loved watching my FRIES getting tossed in a big bowl while they got seasoned. 

the CALAMARI (cocktail sauce with extra horseradish instead of the marinara) -- could have crisped a little longer in the fryer but still awfully good. 

a dozen OYSTERS (actually a couple dozen oysters since we had them both times) -- they were a little dry and i had to work a little since they did not sever the abductor muscle. but i love those juicy, little nuggets so still worth the effort. 

CLAM CHOWDER (like there's a style besides new england -- what is that red stuff anyway ??) -- i managed a tasty spoonful or two before the kids loaded up their bowls with oyster crackers. 

steamers -- clams, white wine, garlic and a little bread to sop up the juice -- there's nothing wrong with that. 

the nice thing about an open kitchen is you get fed and a floor show. the bad thing about an open kitchen is sometimes the floor show detracts from the experience. at lunch, everybody seemed animated and happy to be there. at dinner the droll little trolls behind the counter clearly wanted desperately to be somewhere else.

The location is at a major intersection where exiting hotel and bowling alley traffic meets with traffic moving laterally across the back of the casino. If you're sitting at a table, don't expect a quiet dinner, but one with plenty of people walking by, many smoking. So I would recommend just sitting at the bar.

The menu is one page with seafood appetizers, soup and salad, sandwiches, entrees, and a pound and a half crab leg special for $29. We started with bread and a dozen Louisiana Gold Seal oysters. The oysters were decent in size but lacking any briny or ocean flavor. About half of the oysters could have been shucked better with less shell. My wife ordered the linguine with clams in red sauce and I had the seafood diavalo with an anchor steam. My wife wasn't too happy with the sauce in her dish. My dish had a nice spicy kick with big chunks of seafood.

It's not cheap either, but probably one of the more affordable and convenient places to get cioppino with out braking your pockets and making reservations at since fancy shmancy Italian restaurante.

Other dishes include lobster grilled cheese, bloody mary oyster shooters and beer bartered shrimp and scallops.  Also includes the regulars (crab legs, catch of the day, etc.) As well as both Manhattan& New England style clam chowder.  

The place is fast and right on the money with what I need, good food fast and close to home.  

Service is mad friendly and helpful behind an open kitchen that provides that piece of mind for those skeptical about cleanliness.

Now the cioppino, it's on hit!  The tomato broth is piping hot and tasty when it comes out and includes a generous portion of scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari and lobster over linguine.  There is a tone down version that has less broth and more of a sauce, its called a Diavallo and just as good.

We usually share a portion unless you are ""mob boss"" hungry.  I like to pair it up with a  nice glass of Anchor Steam and keep the buns coming, ah thank you.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,1,4,B3djMHWBGbU5Y40JlACgnw

5676959,2017-09-03,1,hCsJv234v62MgdsUU1j8dQ,"Food: $34 crab legs, fish sliders, and ceviche for lunch. My husband really likes the crab legs and has come here several times just for this. It's a better deal than paying for a buffet when this is all he wants to eat.  They get the crab from Seattle and in the winter from Canada. The fish sliders were tasty, but even better if you add salt, pepper and lemon. Ceviche was terrible - rubbery and gross. I ate two bites. I had an upset stomach a few hours later which I suspect this as the culprit.  

Location: inside South Point. 

Ambiance: facing the casino, so noisy. 

Service: our server Alfredo was great.  Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. 

I didn't love the ambiance of the place and I think the ceviche was bad, so I think hubby will have to get crab here with friends!",V6Cjj3SVmMqCrr6uJqvlPw,2,1,3,xruDJK5MyigwtSaAFEDIUw

After watching a movie at the theatres, we decided to go and indulge in some seafood (party of two). This was our second time eating here and the impression Big Sur Oyster Bar made on us the second time was just like the first; lacking customer service, fast-paced, and with no personality. I understand that this may be a high volume restaurant with majority of the people wanting to get in and out, but I believe every restaurant should have a bit of passion for customer service.  I also understand that each restaurant has its own culture, but a restaurant in a major off-the-strip hotel should have a pinch or two more. 

The food is decent. The Jambalya is soulless. The Combo Pan Roast lacks the flavor. It's sad when the best part of the meal is the table bread.

The customer service is sub-par with the servers at the bar gossiping about work drama and not even making eye contact to the customers. There was no suggestions for specials or meals, and our glasses of water were kept empty for the whole meal.  However, they were extremely quick to cash us out, which was probably a good thing. 

Pros:  conveniently located in the Southpoint Hotel

Cons:  customer service & food

Over all 1.8 stars for poor customer service and no flavor to the food.",BN-hf4cTiPwbM4kjRYIzyg,1,0,2,rYyFACUMryZovnL8dOxJNw
5731163,2016-07-30,0,hCsJv234v62MgdsUU1j8dQ,"I give this oyster bar a 2 because the food and atmosphere is plain. We are regulars at the Oyster bar in the Santa Fe, but they close at 10pm so we tried this one since it was 11pm.
It seemed like the workers were ready to go home. I was watching the chefs and every time they would get an order it was irritating for them. 
Our servicer was Daniel, he was good. Always ask how we were doing. 
Like I said the food was plain no spices, like we are use to. They don't offer a selection of oysters. I think the only kind they have is Louisiana oyster. It was ok. Not a true oyster bar. Their drink selections are plain too. I wouldn't drive far and pay what we did for this food.

I have had the good fortune of dining here on a number of occasions and I must say that the food is fantastic and the service is equally as fantastic. All the Chefs and servers are really friendly and helpful. The clam chowder is a must have and the crab legs are great because they are already split. I've pretty much tried everything on this menu and all items are really fresh and well-prepared. I don't know why the other reviewers keep comparing this to the Palace Station because to me there is no comparison. This place has better and more flavorful food.,qba1JQlp5a6kEwRRTGxdkg,2,2,5,xxFCocPmzDBQcIIOFWql5w

They have a large counter area for sitting, and a few tables. No wait for the counter so that's where we sat. The king crab legs were 1 1/2 lbs for $29.99, so we ordered that along with 6 oysters.

Crab legs were a bit on the small side for king crab, and not as flavorful. I've had better.

Service was very good. 

Overall, not a bad place to stop in and eat. Prices a bit high as normal with a casino. I do like the South Point and hope to come back and try a few more dining options here.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,3,3,aFIe-S56PAnfA60Q7FCV3w

Perhaps it was a fluke but we had an uninterested waiter, awfully strong and non-mixed bloody mary oyster shooters, and two bland, overpriced entrees. I was excited to try the lobster grilled cheese, but it was incredibly bland and lobster was a little over-cooked. My boyfriend had the seared ahi caesar salad that was incredibly fishy and actually made him run to the bathroom afterwards. I wonder why...?  We got out of there as fast as possible but not without feeling incredibly frustrated with the service and the poorly made, way overpriced meal we had paid for.

I always thought there are too many good places in vegas to eat... why eat here... welllll its goood!!! especially when they have their happy hour like sale... half off clams and oysters!! yum! so worth it! 


My bf got the cioppino  and he loved it.. $30 bucks and he said its worth it.. i tried it and i thought it was cool! 

be sure to use ur south point hotel packet for a free soup!  its like 5 bucks but you get it free with a purchase of entree... 

their lunch specials are cheap 7.95 for a few things... the oyster sammy was good!  the best thing here tho is the half shell oyster and clams for half off... its monday-thursday 12-4 or something... starts when it opens at 12!

It's like the ice cream of soup.  Even just a cup of it with a meal was too much.  I had the Beer Battered Shrimp & Scallops with french fries and remoulade sauce. Delicious, but very rich as well.  I think the thing to do would be to get a cup of soup and then split an entree with another person and even then, you have to pace yourself.

I've always passed by  Big Sur and never thought of it more than an Oyster bar - which I am slightly allergic to, but I like to take a dip on the while side once in awhile - After trying a pan roast at a different location, we decided to take in some good eats. 

Order the combination pan roast - good flavor but might've needed a bit more rice (could I have asked for more? I don't really know) 
and the shrimp scamp - delicious sauce and the shrimps were pretty large. 
Dozen oysters (for mis amigos) - they were also pretty large in size and I'm used to (and confined) to the smaller ones.
