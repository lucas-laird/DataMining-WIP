Under previous management, they used to offer a very tasty Massaman curry which sadly is no longer available. However, their Moo-Tod (garlic and pepper fried pork) is perhaps the best dish on their menu and should not be missed. Their spicy catfish filet was outstanding the first time I had it, and I normally don't even like catfish. Unfortunately, the second time was not nearly as good. The catfish lacked the crisp exterior it had last time and was kind of mushy. As for their other dishes, the pad thai was decent, but the pad see ew was missing the right amount of caramelization. The spicy eggplant dish needed more of its namesake and less ""filler"". Service is generally very personable although they inadvertently left out the 3 dipping sauces for my last take-out order of Moo-Tod. Once they address some issues with inconsistency and service, they have the potential to be 4-star material.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,1,1,3,dmfrMspr28x7RfT0e7wB_g

I was starting to lose hope....we will be back.  Those crab rangoons are magnificent not even I can stuff that much in them! :))) The restaurant was totally empty (i had ordered take out) but the gentlemen that walked in behind me was a regular and said he orders all his food here! Soooo go give them some business!  I went to Lotus of Siam over the weekend and was soooo disappointed I was determined to find some good Thai food! So I did my research online, check out there website! Spiciness was perfect!  I was used to ordering by stars 1-4 which I usually get 3 stars so I ordered a 7 on there 1-10 level and it was perfect.

1759881,2010-10-17,1,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"First: big thanks to the other reviewers of Thai Grill. I just moved to Las Vegas from California yesterday and needed some great grub to lift my spirits after the long drive. 

I ordered what seems to be a local fave: Tom Kah Kai. For those not fluent in Thai, it's a sour chicken soup with mushrooms and a coconut base. My fianc√© (Erin Ashley) was apprehensive at first. Then came the first slurp of the creamy broth. Words cannot describe the glory in that to-go cup. Do yourself a favor and order this when you come here. Oh, and we finished off the soup for breakfast this morning, too -- it was just as good chilled. 

Since it was my first time visiting Thai Grill, I ordered Pad Thai. What spaghetti is to Italian, pad Thai is to... well, Thai. Peanuts and noodles and sprouts (which Erin Ashley ate; sprouts are one of two things I culinarily dislike) and hot sauce and shrimp. All exquisitly prepared. Big thumbs up for this staple dish. 

While waiting for everything to be prepared, I enjoyed a Thai Iced Tea. Sweet, spice-y (not to be confused with spicy), creamy, smooth, rich... all the wonderfully exotic things the beverage was meant to be. 

The owner (Jill) is also more than pleasant. It is obvious that she takes great pride in her restaurant. As she should, too! Not only is the food phenomenal, the interior of the facility is immaculate! Well-lit art hangs on every wall and tables, chairs & booths are all very fine in appearance. 

5-Stars for Thai Grill. This is definitely a place I'm looking forward to going back to again and again. 

Hope to see you there!",rQM4yX8XW466hX2to2O2bw,1,1,5,qDE26jThoTCbjuiEUUKSJg

My buddy and I ordered the Pad Sew Eew (chicken - level 4 spicy), Yellow Curry (beef - level 7 spicy), and the Fried Rice (add egg and tomato). The Pad Sew Eew was average at best; bland, not much flavor in the chicken, and extremely dry. The Yellow Curry was probably the best Thai curry I've ever had in my life. Potatoes were cooked super perfect, nice full savory flavor, the beef was nice and tender, and the spice was not overpowering at all. The fried rice was up there in the top 10 I've had ever.

The price was pretty standard for Thai dinner cuisine. Pro Tip: check-in before your visit and you can get 10% off your dinner bill.

2338826,2011-11-06,0,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"Thai Grill is located at the outside corner of the Food 4 Less parking lot. Yeah, the area is a little ""hood"" but Thai Grill itself is anything but.

The restaurant itself is clean, dim, and quiet. It's much nicer inside than I would expect from a restaurant that shares a parking lot with Food 4 Less.

I got my order to-go and used the ""$7 for $10"" Yelp coupon. The cashier seemed a little confused about whether the coupon was worth $7 or $10, but she ended up taking my word for it that it was worth $10. *sigh* She was really sweet about it, so I just assume she must have been new. 

I placed my order for the Cashew entree with all veggies and the Fresh Ginger entree with tofu, both at about an 8 or 9 for spiciness. The cashier said it'd be about ten minutes. The food came out when she promised, and both entrees included a serving of steamed rice (it didn't specify that on the menu).  

Both entrees were full of flavor but they weren't as spicy as I would have expected. I know the spicy-scale is relative to the restaurant and that a 9 at one restaurant might be a 6 at another. But really-- my food was probably more like a 7 to someone who hates spicy food, and like a 4 to someone who loves spicy food. It tasted like it was toned down a lot... or maybe the cook just didn't think I was being serious when I said 8 or 9.

Also, both entrees were super oily! I've never experienced this at any Thai restaurant I've ever been to so I don't know if this was a one time thing, or if this is normal at Thai Grill... but I was literally wiping my mouth with a napkin after each bite because the oil was so thick that it was coating my lips!

Yellow chicken curry spice level 8 - this was VERY good however it was sooooo spicy and I still don't know what I was thinking by ordering an 8. It came with a side of white rice and it was delish. Next time I will order it with a spice level of 3 or 4.

Beef fried rice - my husband ate this and loved it. Huge, huge portion by the way.

Chicken pad thai spice level 8 - this was also very good. I loved it but it was also a little to spicy for me. Next time I would order this at a 5. The 8 level was still really yummy though.

Chicken satay - I have never had chicken satay before so all I can say is that I'm not the biggest fan but the type of chicken they used was really good...no gristle or fat or anything. I wouldn't order this again because I just didn't care for it too much.

2646772,2011-01-15,2,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"Thai Grill and I have a long history.  Starting nearly five years ago, I started eating authentic Bangkok-style Thai food here on a weekly basis.  Some of you might remember Pock and his family's unique, gourmet Thai food during that time.  About a year ago, ownership changed, and the food changed... starting the beginning of this year there is yet a new owner with new recipes, especially Northern and Southern Thailand recipes.  Here is my updated review for Thai Grill over several visits.

Pad See Ew - Fresh Chinese broccoli, fairly well prepared chicken.  The sauce is a little heavier than it used to be, and slight bit sweeter.  However, it is still a good version of this classic Thai dish.  I would say that it compares to the style of Pad See Ew at Kung Fu.

Pineapple Fried Rice ($9.99) - Very well done.  Lighter, and a little less flavorful than the old Thai Grill fried rice, but not greasy at all.  They started using fresh pineapples again, which gives the dish the properly fruity-sweet flavor that it is supposed to have.  I enjoyed it.

Kang-Pa, Jungle Curry ($8.99) - A Northern Thai spicy fish sauce curry soup (no coconut) with bamboo, various peppers, galanga, choice of meat, and a whole lot of taste.  This is a very authentic curry, and I loved how th curry flavor mixed with the fish sauce.  I haven't had a lot of Northern Thai dishes, but this was definitely much nicer than the Northern Red Curry at LoS.  I wouldn't recommend this for folks who aren't adventurous, but if you are then this is a great dish to try.

Hung-Ley ($8.99) - This is a pork base with a homemade curry (not coconut curry) type sauce on it.  The pork was cooked similar to pot roast.  It was extremely tender, and expertly prepared.  The taste over rice was amazingly great.  I highly recommend trying this one.

Duck Noodles (10.99) - This came with a regular egg noodle, duck, Chinese broccoli, and various herbs.  The broth reminded me of pho, and wasn't spicy at all.  I added some chili powder to spice it up, and it probably could have also benefited from the sour sauce in hind sight.  The duck was well prepared.  Overall I would order this again for people who aren't into the stronger tasting Thai dishes.

Nam-Tod (8.99) - This is a deep fried pork dish over a vinegary sauce and light salad.  The fried pork was flaky and simply amazing.  I am not a huge fan of fried foods, but the way the pork was prepared was simply amazing.  If you like to explore, try this one out.  The vinegar sauce was not overpowering, and was well balanced (unlike most vinegar sauces at Thai restaurants).  You can tell that the cook knows how to balance flavors properly.
 
Red Curry w/Beef ($7.99) - So far my only real disappointment, if you could call it that, but it wasn't that bad compared to most Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This is the first coconut based curry I have had here.  It had a light, but unique flavor.  It definitely could have used more umph to it though.  the server promised that the curry can be made spicier for us next time.  With some chili powder though, it was still a good curry.

Khao Soi ($7.99) - YUM!  This has fresh, yummy noodles, and a well balanced yellow curry.  I loved their version of the dish.  It comes in a huge bowl, so it is bound to fill you up.  The best part about this dish is the yellow curry, which is rich and flavorful (not sweet).  

Desserts - the Fried banana and sweet sticky rice are perfect.  I've only had ""better"" fried banana at TSNH, but even that is a toss up... these were very lightly fried, which made them easier on the stomach than TSNH.  The sweet sticky rice (with or without mango depending on the season), is again expertly prepared.  The sweet coconut based sauce saturates the rice, making it very sweet (not candy sweet though), but somehow doesn't make the rice soggy.  You've got to try this one if you are a fan of this classic Thai dessert.

Final thoughts: the new cook, Natta, knows how to balance Thai food, and at the same time keep it strong and unique.  The food is about as authentic as it gets.  The menu is absolutely huge, featuring different regions of Thailand; you are bound to find a dish that you have never heard of/tried before.  I will definitely return on a regular basis!

UPDATE/WARNING: In my opinion, Thai Grill has two modes: Slightly Americanized, and Authentic.  The Americanized versions aren't bad at all.  The main thing is that the base recipes are well done.  Some people might not like the added sugar/toned down Thai flavors of the Americanized versions.  If you are one of those people, be sure to tell your server to make the authentic, strong stuff!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,12,5,5,KWyNzvx22aeSUs1_6vqsrA

Like many restaurants in this neighborhood.......... komex, pepe's, sunshine cafe, I amazed at their presence here. 

Why would so many spectacular eateries set up in the somewhat defunct strip malls of this 89108 zip code?

This strip mall in particular is a little scary at night.

But so what? If you are worthy, brave the parking lot and enter the sanctuary that is this amazing thai restarant in the barrio.                It's actually really nice inside.

They have a lot of regional thai food I am not super familiar with, but their noodles, curries, and appetizers are as good as it gets.

I am not shy around spicy food, anything higher than a 8/10 you order will melt your face.",FNnb4b4GolPiShkO025S3A,0,0,4,nNXnOXHJcsan2NevKfvIZw
3143016,2010-07-27,0,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"Going to the Thai Grill was an excellent experience. The restaurant has a modern asian feel.They have very tasty traditional Thai food. The service is very prompt and friendly. 
The first impression of the restaurant is that it is newly remodeled with a nice tile floor and dark wood furniture. I was impressed by the unique modern asian art on the walls. Everything felt professional designed to fit. After speaking with the waiter I learned that they had just changed ownership and the new owner put a lot of time and effort into remodeling the place. I think they did a great job. 
The service was excellent. I had a few questions about what to order and the waiter was very patient and was helpful even when i stumbled with some of the pronunciations. I finally ordered the beef salad, yellow curry, chicken satay, and the tom kha kai. 
I had my camera with me so I was able to practice some food shots. I posted them on this site. Let me know what you think. 
When the food came it was an excellent presentation. What i noticed was that the flavors were very unique and better then what i have tried at other restaurants. I started with the chicken satay. I really like the peanut sauce that comes with this. The chicken was juicy and cooked just right. The beef salad had a great steak flavor with a hint of lime. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The curry had a unique flavor. Not the curry from the can but a home made flavor. I recommend trying this one. The heavy hitter was the tom kha kai. It was an explosion of flavor. The combination of coconut ,Thai spices , and chicken were perfect.  I also highly recommend this from the Thai grill. They have somehow taken a great recipe and gave it more character. Share it with a friend. 
I have to give the Thai grill 5 stars because it was  a perfect experience.  The environment was classy and professional. The service was friendly and prompt, they made me feel like i was family. The food was excellent and very traditional with more attention to the unique Thai flavors. And most important of all the prices are very competitive with other Thai restaurants.

My love and I went in for their

Tom Yum Noodle: The Tom Yum broth was really delicious. However, on the menu, it is described with having BBQ pork, ground pork, fish balls, etc. The noodle came out with only ground pork. I told the server that there should be some BBQ pork in it without listing all the other things it was missing. He told me he would ask the chef. He came back out saying that ""The Tom Yum noodle hasn't been as popular, so the chef took some of the ingredients out."" Uh... we don't send food back, so we enjoyed this dish which lacked three of the things listed. 

We also tried their

Thai BBQ Chicken and Sticky Rice: When in a steak house, order a steak. When in a place called Thai Grill, I figured I'd order barbecue, right? Oh, how I wish I could have taken that back and ordered something else. The chicken was moist, but the sauce was overly salty. I have an inkling that they didn't taste their food before sending it out. It was so salty that I only ate the chicken inside the skin. The sticky rice texture was perfect. The rice still has all the mineral flavors, although this also means it wasn't washed. 

I normally don't rate after one visit, but both dishes were a fail and the server didn't really know the ingredients that should be in the food. We were expected to like our tom yum even without three of the other ingredients listed in it. 

I don't think I'll be back to try this place. There is so much more that is good out there that I wouldn't want to take another risk. I would like to add as a benefit of the doubt that perhaps their menu was just too large, so they probably have some really great dishes that are ordered all the time. However, we didn't taste any.

When we received the food, we were missing an entree, I called and spent over 30 minutes with them because they were arguin that it was there, when in fact it wasn't. In the time they wasted on the phone, they could've dropped another one off. They also didn't bother to call and tell us that the lunch option only comes with vegetable soup. Even though online asks you to order from 11 options.
Unfortunately, the food was decent, but with the horrible customer service they provided I could never recommend this to a friend! When we asked about the pad Thai chicken having only two small pieces in it they said ""we're in recession, chicken is expensive""",_lUsR_nKi3WXRmlDMhT9kw,2,0,1,TJxrp7G_Rj776b77rHZrJQ

We placed our order around 1:30p, we ordered 11 entrees, 2 drinks and a dessert.  We ordered soups with all of our entrees and when the food arrived at 2:35p we did not have the soups we ordered.  We also noticed that we were missing an entr√©e.  We immediately called the restaurant to notify them of the situation so we could get the order and our soups before our lunch ended at 3:00.  When we called the woman that we spoke with was rude and made it a point to say that the mistake was on our end and one we did not order 11 entr√©es and the soups are not included with lunch specials even though that was what was posted on the company website.  After 20 minutes of arguing with this particular woman (and passing the phone 3 of my co-workers) she handed the phone to another individual who re-read our order and listed the missing entr√©e.  When I again told them that we did NOT have that item he said ""I don't know what else to do"".  I then notified him that I felt I should alert a good friend who works for the Las Vegas Weekly about the situation that was happening (since he writes reviews for restaurants); the man asked me to please not do that and that they WOULD get the entr√©e out to us as soon as possible. I also notified the employee that on several of the entrees we had ordered (which were supposed to include chicken) that there was very little chicken present, he felt the need to tell me that ""because of the recession"" chicken was expensive.  

Personally I will not be ordering from this restaurant again.  I do NOT appreciate being talked to the way I was; nor do I appreciate being told (after spending over $100.00) that there is nothing they can do when the error was on the restaurant not on any of my co-workers or me.

Chicken Panang Curry and of course, Pad Thai.

Portions here are VERY generous, these three dishes could've easily fed 4-6 people! The Papaya Salad was crisp, refreshing, and had well balanced flavors.
The Panang Curry was also good with just the right amount of heat(we ordered mild) The Pad Thai was perfection, and just as good as Komol's version and we were stuffed, but still had half of each dish for leftovers the next day.

We started off w/  the Thai Grill's Platter & Crying Tiger.  It was so good! Then the chicken satays,  fried rice, eggplant, pad thai, crab omelette & papaya salad & drunken noodle.

 We also ordered the Tillapia w/ Thai herb, but I think they forgot it. Which was okay because by the time we were wondering what happened to it, everyone was so full. I thought everything tasted so good. 

The only complaint was from my sister because when she ordered the papaya salad she asked for a level 2 on spice because she didn't want it too spicy since she was pregnant & sensitive to the heat but it seemed like it was a level 6. I liked it. When they brought it, it was a hill of papya salad. My boyfriend & ended up finishing it because everyone else at our party thought it was too spicy.  Next time she said she'll order a level 1.

I like how they have yogurt smoothies & you can't go wrong w/ Thai tea. They were delicious! So bomb!

To top the night, we had mango w/ sticky rice, fried bananas & roti w/ condensed milk w/ avocado ice cream for dessert. Yummy! We all left full & happy.

It was so good, I ended up coming back the next day for lunch. I ordered the tom-ka w/ tofu & my sister had a lunch special w/ green curry. My sister really loved her lunch. I thought my tom-ka was good but not my favorite. I thought it lacked something. Although it did have a lot of tofu in it.  I also liked the texture of the tofu. It was fried, but inside was soft. I'm might even go there tomorrow just because the have such a huge menu & I'm curious to see how there other stuff is.",G0hKae1fj3M3CGz7EpTqEQ,3,4,5,q6-U6sZJWl51AuZYm_ikQw

I don't care about the slightly shady location that some people mentioned, or the fact that it's a little out of my way. I'm easy to please - good food = happy me.

I ordered online (eat 24) and arrived about 5 minutes after the 30-45 minute pick up time had elapsed. The restaurant was completely empty save for one couple finishing their dinner in a booth, and I waited another good five minutes standing at the counter as I was ignored by a young lady and then an older gentleman. I'm talking no smile, nod, hello, no acknowledgment of my existence. They appeared to not care.

I finally flagged the man down and said I was here to pick up my order. ""What order?"" he says. Uh oh. So I explain the online order, show him the e-mail confirmation, he sifts through some papers scattered by the phone counter and comes up with the order. Which they haven't even started preparing. Really?

So I wait another 20 minutes (by now we're at, what, an hour and 10 after I ordered?) and they bring out.... half the order. He stares at it for a minute, then disappears into the kitchen again. One more dish out. Few minutes, then one more. It was just silly. But finally, almost an hour and a half and double the time they told me it would take, I have food.

Now, if the food had been good, the above would have been forgiven, truly, but it was so disappointing. Tepid food, curry with no flavor, greasy greasy greasy everything, sad underseasoned limp papaya salad....

I popped my UYE cherry here at Thai Grill with about 20 other regular Yelpers.  I would always pass by this nice restaurant and never give a second thought about stopping by and trying it out.  This is located within a grocery store parking lot so there's a lot of parking spaces.  

The inside was clean and lightly decorated.  The emergency exit door wasn't obstructed so thumbs up for that.  The menu was really easy to read and staff was nice.

Because it was cold outside and seeping in I had the hot herbal tea which reminded me of Starbucks' Orange Blossom tea but a little bit more on the lighter side which was perfect.  When the server came around to me I went through about 3 dishes that no one has ordered yet and decide to choose the Roast Duck Curry to share.  

I was able to try at least 8 dishes and the ones that stuck out the most was, by mistake, the Green Curry.  The green curry had a nice kick to it where as the red curry was toned down a little bit.  I liked the tofu but I heard they had round tofu also.  The Pa Cha and Pad See Ewe were good too.  I can't remember the catfish dish name that I tried but that was good, can't really taste the catfish but I knew it was there.  I really wanted to try the frog legs but missed out on it.  With all the spiciness around my Roast Duck dish finally came.  

It took a bit for my duck curry to get there but I believe they had to hunt down a duck (old school Nintendo Duck Hunt anyone?).  And it tasted fresh and mild.  It was refreshing on the palette and the light sweetness to this curry dish made it unique.  

In conclusion, I believe they toned down the heat level for all of us but I didn't mind that as I wanted to taste a lot of dishes.  The fried banana dessert courtesy of Thai King Dan tasted great, fresh bananas at 9pm ftw?!  But there was this dish that looked like it came straight out of hell, the smell of the heat on this dish traveled about 4 person down and when it came around to me I tasted a sample of it and it was really good.  Not as spicy or hot as it looked.  Great restaurant overall, i can't wait to try the real intense flavors next time.  High four stars.

Roast Duck Curry + any of favorite spicy curry dish = win.  Ohhh, the company I had was great.  Thanks Jade!  Thanks everyone!

May not look like much on the outside, but inside....boy oh boy can you smell some good Thai eats going on.  Coconut.  Mint.  Basil.  Lovely.  My wife took me here one night for dinner because her work office nearby often calls in for lunch take-out.  She told me the folks in their office like it here.

Nice atmosphere, very cozy.  Not too busy on a Friday night, granted it is in a less then affluent part of town, but the hostess was very hospitable.  Ok fine.  This place is in the ghetto....""In the ghetttoooooo...."" but damn this is where some of the best food is.  Best chicken?  F-U KFC.  Ghetto.  Best ribs?  Forget it Famous Dave.  Ghetto.  Best Mexican?  Eh, ese are you lost?  Ghetto.  And I have no problem with that.  As long as you don't try to steal my food.  Then yous going to have a problem.  Yeah, I'll show you Hunger Games! 

For the life of me, I can't remember what we had for dinner on this night.  But here are a few of my favorites:

-Beef Salad ($9.99) - Grilled marinated beef with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Served with lime juice dressing.

-Spicy Basil with chicken ($8.99) - Signature entree, with garlic, fresh chili, onions, and jalapenos.  

-Pad Thai with chicken ($8.99) - Rice noodles in home-made pad thai sauce, egg, bean sprouts, and topped with peanuts.

All the food?  Excellent.  The beef salad is so good with that dressing, bright and refreshing.  From what I can gather, lime juice, fish sauce, salt and pepper, and some other spices in there make that salad pop.  I like basil so the spicy basil dish was a natural for me.  The savory of the meat with the sweet touch of basil and the kick of the jalapeno, yummy!  And yes, their pad thai is one of the better ones I've had in Las Vegas.  Great when it's hot out of the kitchen!

The menu at Thai Grill is pretty extensive, there's so many things on it that I haven't tried yet.  Besides Thai appetizers, soups, and salads, there's a diverse entree menu.  So many dishes: noodles, rice, seafood, curries, house specialties, just way too many to list.  They even have a section of the menu that's dedication to food from different regions of Thailand, a very nice touch.  I hope to eventually try more of these!

And of course for those of you on a budget or wanting a culinary sample of Thai food, you can always go for Thai Grill's lunch special from 11 AM - 3 PM M-F.  There's over a dozen entrees to choose from and each come with Jasmine rice or fried rice and a cup of soup.  I'd go for one of the curries (yes people, please be adventurous every once in a while) or the pad thai or ginger entrees.  Choose chicken, beef, pork, or veggies for only $6.99.  Choose seafood for $7.99.  Super great deal!  Forget your burger combos and your $5 footlongs every payday Friday and go exotic!  Your taste buds with thanky thanky you!

If you visit here late at night, please keep your Range Rover, Hermes, Christian Louboutin, and blingy-bling at home!  I will not be responsible for intimitable stare-downs and your impending robbery!  And above all...respect people, respect!

I ordered the Thai Ice Tea not knowing what it was and it turned out to be sweet and bitter, like black ice tea mixed with coffee creamer, really interesting and really good. We ordered the Golden Bags as appetizer and they came with a sweet & sour sauce and darker soy like sauce. The spicy chili peppers to the side and I even wanted to bite off my fingers. 

Then, I ordered the red curry chicken and my husband ordered the shrimp spicy basil. They all come with a side of rice bowl. They both tasted very good. It was the first time I tried red curry and it took me 2 bites to get used to the taste but it tasted different and I really enjoyed eating it. The spicy basil wasn't too exotic and the taste wasn't too crazy either. Nonetheless, both dishes were good spiced and tasted fresh. 

To round things up we ordered desert, I cannot remember the name but it was like a warm crispy pancake with condensed milk on top. It tasted sweet and simply delicious.

And although after i did interrogated the server i learned that they are in fact obtaining new ownership and that they're still undetermined of which direction they want the restaurant to head towards to.

Anyhow Ive been eating lots of noodle soup lately due to the weather and this belly i have is out of control!  Never less i don't mind filling up with goodness like their Khao Soi: deep fried egg noodles with choice of beef or chicken, bean spouts, julienne ginger, dried garlic slice, chopped green onions, chopped cilantro, and a lime wedge all in a bowl of thin curry soup similar to yellow curry.  Since yellow curry is richer in flavor it tone down the overall spiciness of the dish, so an 8 would be about a 5 in this case.  Despite the low grade quality beef, this is a welcoming, hearty bowl. Just a sip of the soup and it will fill in all those missing pieces that you need to move forward with your life.

Another treasure here would be their Tom Ka.  Although i only had it once my first visit here, i remember it was one of the most tasteful, yet smooth coconut soup i ever had.  The transition was endless as it took my mouth on a roller coaster ride. Defiantly get this if you want to impress your foodies in crime.

After meeting Judd L @ Big Wong, we asked him for his opinion on his favorite Thai place and he recommend that we try Thai Grill. Keep in mind our all-time local favorite is Pin-Kaow and Archi's. 

To make a simple comparison when trying out a new Thai place, we always order the following: 

1) Beef Namtok salad 
2) Yellow or Green Curry dish 
3) Pad Thai 

We arrived @ 10:58 (sign reads open @ 11) in the morning to find the place closed and at 11 am, two young men opened the restaurant and told us that the chef has not yet arrived. Not a good sign. You need to open a restaurant early to turn your equipment on and prep for the day. 

We placed our order for the three items as listed above and requested that everything arrive at the same time. I remember reading Dan P's review to request to not make it ""Americanized"" and the waiter told me they only make it one way, the ""Thai way."" Ok. It took a while for the items to start coming out (lack of coming early to prep). The items came in the following order: 1) Curry, 2) Beef Namtok salad about 5 min after the curry, and, 3) Pad Thai dish came about 9-10 min after the salad. Not really acceptable since we were the first patrons there. 

Everything ordered at a spice level of ""5."" 

Yellow Curry w/Tofu-Our favorite dish. The curry sauce was very smooth and flavorful and the fried tofu chunks were a little chewy outside and tender inside. Delicious and one of the best in Vegas. An improvement would be to add a little more potatoes and oninons (not really expensive items) to bulk up the dish.

Beef Namtok salad-Plenty of beef here and not enough cabbage. We asked Wayne, the owner, for more cabbage and happily given us more. The flavorful beef was cooked a bit well and not the normal medium I am accustomed to so it was a little bit tough. Next time I'll request medium. 

Pad Thai w/Pork-We were already almost full from eating the first two dishes and it is too bad that this last item came 10 min later (15 min after the 1st dish). The Pad Thai is sweeter than what I am accustomed to. Judd happened to call me back after I texted him and he said that the sweetness is authentic Thai. Who am I to argue? I just know what I like from eating this dish at many different places over two decades. So this is subjective on my part.

Remember the chef came late? That came to bite back because the rice wasn't fresh but a rather soggy reconstituted leftover rice. Also, since there were two of us, they only brought us one small bowl of rice. Now, we like to eat our curry with rice and why would you only bring the two of us one small bowl instead of two? 

I really wanted to stretch and give Thai Grill a solid 4-Stars. But, the issue with coming in late, not cooking the rice fresh for the day, only giving us a single bowl of rice to share (they did bring more as we asked), and items coming out slowly, I have to resort to 3-Stars. 

Perhaps this is an isolated incident due to some unforeseen circumstance causing the owners to come in late. Till then, I'll reserve the higher updated rating on a future return trip.",HxdCh7lvfe86M8eQ7qeb8A,0,0,3,wfqN6l1cHBtuFVAQcgdQOQ

I was on a date, so it was kind of nice that the server wasn't on my jock strap, so that's fine.  I didn't want the server to feel like a third wheel, I guess.  We had a restaurant.com coupon and the server mentioned that they generally request that patrons spend $40 on Friday/Sat nights when using the coupon.  Coupon says $35.  Who cares, but initial impression makes it seem kind of tacky.  It's not like the place was remotely packed.

The food, though... oh, the food...

Soup was delicious.  I can't even remember the name of it.  Doesn't matter.  Oh lordy.  I start salivating just thinking about it.  Good broth, veggies, nice and light.  We had a few entrees just to try everything out.  The beef panang exploded with flavor.  The yellow curry with shrimp wasn't too spicy or overpowering.  It's almost like the cook knew we were new to Thai food.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Even the rice was nice and fluffy, yet sticky enough to grab a chunk with a fork.  We took home a few boxes to eat for the next couple days.  It was definately worth a trip back.",MmHCNElMsS8wgKOW5EU94g,0,1,4,UOkzV4atIqDY56-DKJZOCw

So what's the verdict? It was good, but I didn't find any compelling reason to drive back there. The one dish that stood out was the Green Curry. I'm not sure why, but it had a unique flavor and was absolutely delicious. That is the reason I'm handing out four stars.

Like I said, the rest of the food was good too. We all ordered individually, but I got to try pretty much everyone's dishes. My go-to dish, Panang Curry, had good flavor. I still prefer Archi's, of course.

The ""Cashew"" dish with chicken was particularly tasty and just the right amount of heat (I ordered a 6!) for me. Crisp, fresh vegetables and big chunks of tender, premium white meat chicken. To die for, and would definitely order again!

I ordered the Panang curry with shrimp; I found it flavorful and spicy. The shrimp were cooked just right and this tasted great over some steamed rice. I thought it might have been a little salty, and I could have ordered it a bit hotter (I think I did a 5, probably could do 6 or 7 next time). While I enjoyed this meal, I might try a few of the other curries before coming back to this one.

One of my favorite dishes, spicy basil rice, was expertly executed and perfectly 'spicy'. I ordered this with beef and thought there could have been more of the meat, but the rice and vegetables were great and this complemented the rest of my dishes quite nicely. Would definitely order this one again, too, maybe with chicken next time. I got this at level 7 and this was good for me.

The spring rolls here are HUGE! Greasy and good and filled with deliciousness. My order came with two sauces: one looked like the standard plum sauce and the other was something with garlic (and maybe ginger?) floating in it - this was money!

Bottom line, order from here if you are in the area! Or even if you aren't. You'll thank me and all the other 4-5 star reviewers later!",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,2,0,5,hCxsrOFL0aRhDgHBvxH9VA

I think the owners are nice and the male server (who I think is the manager) is very talkative and friendly, but one of their servers isn't equal to the rest of the people who make for a good experience. We've had this one older lady with a K name ( I can't remember what the receipt said exactly but I think it said Kae) several times and I hate to call out people, but they've been rude, forget orders/wrong orders (once when it was just the BF and I, during the UYE she gave us a curry no one ordered and a few peoples things came out with the wrong types of meat, and most recently with the family, we didn't get one of our orders at all), doesnt really check up on people.

 Last weekend we brought my mom and grandma in law. Apparently my mom in law signed and left the ""customer copy"" receipt instead of the one that says ""merchant"". It really doesn't matter on records but receipts print that out to minus confusion. She went to the parking lot to catch us and was yelling over and over ""I need this copy. You gave me the wrong copy. Where is it?"" and even when we were digging through my mom in laws purse she kept on and so my mom in law went back inside. Mom came back out irritated. Said she continued to repeat herself over and over and was making her feel like she did something terrible by the tone of her voice when it's just a piece of paper. Its not like we tried to do something bad to her and she kept on even when mom was looking for where she put the receipt. 

I would come back for certain foods, but I'll try to come when the friendly manager guy is in. The inlaws don't want to come back with us though and want us to only take them to Pan Asian.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,1,4,YD2OuJ_526Tcd1R8jEyQdQ

Actually every day. 

You're not going to Thai Grill for the atmosphere unless you really miss the atmosphere of your Grandpa's basement rec room. Light brown paneling rules the day here and it is completed by a couple TV's sitting up on a cabinet or table and red vinyl booths accented by occasional touches of almost matching duct tape. All it needed was a furnace, water heater and peg board wall filled with tools and the Grandpa's basement Thai restaurant illusion would be complete. 

So what about the food you ask? Is this a legit hole-in-the wall find? 

I'm not quite sure. I had Mussman Curry with shrimp. I ordered it medium but would go hotter next time. The sauce was nice and flavorful and there were no remnants of curry flakes I have seen at other Thai places. It included shrimp, potatoes, carrots, onions and peanuts. The veggies were fine although some of them had a crinkle cut which I found oddly distracting in Thai food. The shrimp was good but a little chewy. Could be slightly overcooked or could be thawed too quickly: 2 methods with the same result, chewy shrimp. 

I also ordered Thai iced coffee. The server brought out Thai iced tea which I immediately started on. He quickly realized his mistake and brought out the iced coffee. I drank most of both and I actually preferred the Thai iced tea. It had a good earthy authenticity to it. Between the coffee and the tea my fingers are flying right now, BTW. 

The total bill for this decent but not outstanding meal? $12.06. Solid. 

There was steady call-in and drop by orders going to local repeat customers that they knew by name...generally a good sign.

We happened to be on this side of town the other day. We are always up for a curry adventure, so we decided to be bold and go for it despite the advertised lunch special served with egg drop soup and crab rangoon. These items don't really say, ""Tasty authentic Thai,"" to me.

Looking over the past reviews, I am pretty sure the interior has been redesigned over the past year. I saw the remnants of the wood paneling lining the hallway to the bathroom, but the rest of the restaurant now has a kind of Pier One aesthetic. It was nicer than I had anticipated.

The service was super friendly, although we did have a bit of a miscommunication. We did not want the lunch special, and the waitress thought that we did. She brought out the egg drop soup with a smile, at which point we explained to her we wanted the dinner portion for our curries. She left the egg drop soup, and I couldn't resist a teeny taste. To describe it succinctly: cornstarchy with English peas. We didn't even eat an entire teaspoon. I definitely advise skipping the lunch special.

After the soup, I wasn't sure what to expect. On the one hand, if they can't deliver a decent egg drop soup, how can they execute curry? On the other hand, why should a Thai place have good egg drop soup in the first place? 

For our main dishes we had a red and a Mussaman curry, both with tofu. Perhaps I am not looking hard enough or perhaps it isn't a popular Thai dish, but I have a hard time finding Mussaman. I admit I was giddy to see it on the menu! Given the consistency of the curries, I would say they are not using a lot of cornstarch for thickening. They were neither too thick, nor too thin. A good sign. The tofu was fried, but quality. I ate mostly the Mussaman, and the flavor was addictive--a true comfort curry. But, it was really sweet, and I could not tell if it was the tamarind or perhaps some sugar delivering that saccharine punch. I should send my taste buds to bootcamp! One minor detail: I wish there had been more potatoes and carrots in the dish. 

They don't have brown rice. So, where does that leave me? If you are on this side of town, this is really a food oasis as there are few respectable dining options, but I probably won't drive out of my way to return unless I get a mean Mussaman hankering.

So I walk into the restaurant on a Monday night and it is pretty dead. I decide to take a look at the menu for some take out. The girl at the front was pleasant.

I ordered the Raw Salmon or Raw Shrimp in Spicy Fish Sauce (#94). The girl at the front checked with the chef and mentioned the salmon was not fresh, but the shrimp was. So I ended up getting the shrimp though I was more looking forward to salmon. Anyway, she then asked how spicy I wanted it from 1-10. Being used to most of the other Thai restaurants in the area I knew even a 10 would be weak sauce. Boy was I happily wrong. The dish was probably around a 9 on the spicy scale for me, and I loved it!

As for the actual flavors of the dish, they went together beautifully. Raw shrimp, with large chunks of garlic, lime, and mint with a healthy dose of minced chilies was heavenly. I definitely felt the pain by the end of the meal which was actually quite large. Bigger than I was expecting.

I went here on a Sunday around 7:30. The place was empty other than the 20 Yelpers all gathered around one table. 

Everyone ordered various drinks, but most people opted for the Thai coffee or tea. I had Thai tea and it was great. I would say it most closely resembled an iced chai tea latte from Starbucks, but even better and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. 

For apps and entrees we all ordered and shared.  The best app was by far the beef jerky. Unlike typical beef jerky, these pieces of meat were cooked, but not not dried to a crisp and marinated in what tasted like teriyaki.

I would say the best entree I tasted was a spicy shrimp pad thai dish. Great flavor and spice. What is great about each order is that you can pick how spicy you want it. They give you a 1 to 10 scale.

I wanted to be daring and show off how much I enjoyed Thai cuisine so I ordered the Jungle Curry. While some people may have enjoyed it, I thought it tasted too earthy.

5390837,2012-12-03,2,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"Just finished my takeout order from Thai Grill.   I'd been there one previous time dining in and thanks to my spectacular memory I have no idea what I got that first time.  I do remember enjoying it, and since I'm in the process of trying to visit and review as many Thai restaurants in my best Dan P impersonation I figured it was worth another try.  

First thing of note I noticed on the online menu was the option of getting seafood in the lunch specials.  I absolutely love salmon so I decided on trying my usual Basil lunch special, but got it with salmon instead of chicken.  I even asked the gentleman who took my order on the phone if in his opinion that combination would go okay (I wasn't sure if my love of both items separately was clouding my decision.  I love bacon, I love cake, I dont want bacon cake.  Okay maybe I do.  Nevermind).   He said he thought it would work out okay, so I went with it.  I also ordered a ""regular iced tea""  I'm including that tidbit for a reason.

When I went to pick up the food, it was all neatly packaged for me already.  I always love that, though they did include my ""regular iced tea"" in the bag, which always throws off my sensibilities of hot vs cold as well as how to carry and place the bag appropriately in my car.   Upon getting to my car I promptly removed the tea from the main bag and was on my way.

Back at the office I removed my food and started eating.  Another noteworthy item is the soup from the lunch special was actually included, which is seemingly a rarity from my experience with lunch special take out from other restaurants.  The soup was a very light brothed vegetable soup which I enjoyed.  When opening the Basil dish, it was much different than any I'd ever seen before.   Large chunks of veggies like carrots, bamboo shoots, and cucumber or squash tossed in with the usual ingredients.  There was a decent amount of salmon which had the skin left on which is a plus as far as I'm concerned.  Overall I enjoyed it even though the salmon didn't taste extremely fresh to me.   Even though I did like it, I still think I prefer the ""standard"" preparation of the dish I'm used to and that I've had at just about every other thai restaurant I've ordered it.  I honestly questioned if I even got what I'd actually ordered, that's how different it was.

Now onto the ""regular iced tea"".   When I removed it from my bag in the car I noticed it was of a different color than I usually expect iced tea.  I figured it might have been some sort of flavored tea, which while I prefer it normal and unsweetened, wouldnt be the end of the world.  Instead, I'm fairly certain it was a thai iced tea, which I'm not a fan of and which actually can potentially cause issues with my lactose intolerance depending on the way its made.   I ended up throwing it out after 2 sips, so clearly I was disappointed in this.

In the end, I dont think I would end up at Thai Grill again in the future as I generally like the know what to expect when I order.   Friendly service and nice flavors on the Basil dish bump it up from a 2 star review it would have earned otherwise.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,1,3,0wbAWmYfZMAWwkf86CFwiA

The spring roll was awesome, and the sauces are delicious (well, the peanut sauce was kind of bland with an unpleasant under-taste). The tom ka soup was not too bad but it was a bit ""heavy"". I have been spoiled in the past by tom ka soup that was light in body, possessed a distinct undertone of lemongrass, and contained soft, flavorful chicken pieces. Compared to that, this soup was, the less refined cousin or something.  Something a novice might prepare.

On to the main meal: yellow curry. Did not like it. I don't know if it was overly salted or what, but I just did not enjoy the flavor at all. I'm not sure how to describe it- maybe I'm unfairly comparing it to mussaman from better Thai restaurants. This restaurant doesn't offer mussaman per se, but the yellow curry is the closest. I won't be ordering it again.

I have to add that the rice was MUSHY and TASTELESS. It was in no way the basmati rice they advertise. Maybe they ran out and substituted cheap short grain rice from God-knows-where but it was horrid.  If I wanted rice like this, I could have ruined a batch in my own kitchen.

5562436,2011-02-28,1,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"Last night, I had the pleasure of attending my first unofficial Yelp event here at Thai Grill.  I spent the evening sharing in good food and good company and I met some really nice people.  If you ever get a chance to attend a Yelp event, I recommend it.  It was a lot of fun.

The Thai food here at Thai Grill is some of the best in town.  The restaurant is under new ownership so if you didn't like it in the past (which is doubtful), I recommend that you try it again.  The new menu contains many new and delicious items originating from all areas of Thailand.

If you are tempted to get the lunch specials, don't.  Be courageous!  Be adventurous!  Be daring!  Go for the real food on the menu!  You won't be disappointed.

My favorites include the Pad See Ewe, Green Curry, and something new I tried called Pa Cha.

Pad See Ewe is probably my favorite Thai dish.  I love it's smokey flavor and wide rice noodles.  It's best when made with Chinese style broccoli, which Thai Grill serves fresh.  If you haven't tried Pad See Ewe, you won't be disappointed when you do.  It's full of wonderful flavors and is even more delicious with a little Thai chili powder sprinkled on top.

The Green Curry here is one of the best I've ever had.  I had it both with shrimp and with tofu.  The perfect mixture of spices and ingredients in the curry was amazing and the sauce was just the right thickness.  The heat level on this dish was about a 6 on Thai Grill's scale of 1 to 10 and I think it was perfect for my taste, but I do like it spicy!

The Pa Cha was loaded with chicken!  I don't think there was a portion of the plate that was uncovered.  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauce in the Pa Cha was very savory with a hint of salt and herbs that sent my taste buds dancing.  This is how Thai food should taste, in my opinion.  This, to me, was a very authentic dish.  I'm glad the new owner of Thai Grill recommended it!  I will be ordering it again.  Oh yeah!

I also tried the Kua Kling, a beef dish which is always served spicy.  This is an oilier style Thai dish that is on the salty side, but is full of Thai flavors.  The previous owners did this dish a bit better, in my opinion.  This time it had an overpowering lemongrass flavor and the bits of lemongrass were visible throughout the dish.  If they toned down the lemongrass a bit it would be a lot better.  It was also not a spicy as I remember it.  Even so, it wasn't bad at all.  Just not what I'm used to.

I have never had a bad Thai dish here.  The atmosphere is cozy and elegant and the staff is professional and attentive.

I came here after checking Yelp and seeing friends sing the praises of Thai Grill. I went in excited, hungry, and so happy to find a well-received place not horribly far from where I work. The bar was set high, sure, but not unreasonably so.

I ordered the shrimp and veggie tempura to nosh on while I waited for my friend to show up. She was driving an even longer distance, but I was too hungry to wait! I had a shrimp that seemed too soft and a couple small pieces of zucchini. (A) This was NOT tempura batter; there were two styles of batter/breading on the plate. (B) The batter was so thick that there were wet pockets of uncooked batter on the insides. (C) Some of the pieces looked like they had been re-fried at some point.

When M showed up she asked me what the hell I was eating and I explained that I was sending it back with the above explanation. The waitress was nice enough to listen to me and replace it with some Thai dumplings. Too large, dry, and with a wrapper that was soggy and falling apart, they *did* have an OK flavor. But it was just OK.

The thom kha soup was decent. Not my favorite, but edible. They love their fish sauce here, the flavors are way too obvious. Other than that and my personal preference that it be a tad creamier, it was the spice level I wanted and generally OK. Definitely the highlight, and that's not saying much today.

The shrimp panang damn near killed me, and not in a good way. I took some of just the curry, then with some vegetables... so far, I kinda liked it. A little bland, but I figured I could spice it up a bit. Then I had a shrimp. Even as I bit into it I knew it was going to be a problem. The shrimp was barely cooked: take all the sauce off of it and it was still grey, translucent, and in need of more time in the kitchen.

We pointed that out and ended the meal. Thankfully I had allergy meds in the car; I had a few decent bites of the curry in which the shrimp was cooked, then the shrimp itself... and I questioned the tempura, too. Bad juju and a bad reaction.

The cook apparently said this was her specialty; this is how she always does it. Nothing about the response indicated a bad day or an off dish or an off ingredient.

The waitress was nice enough, but that was the best thing about the whole experience. The service was slooooooooooow (2 hours for lunch?) and at one point I had to offer to come to her to get her help. We had to ask for water refills. Then, after the meal is over and we're sorting out the semi-OK parts... we are informed that they can only take cash today (of which neither of us had any on us) because their system was broken. When we said we only had cards with us, she wanted to take a card and run it on a system in the back (no receipts, mind you, and what system would this be?!) and we could come back and sign for it later?

I said I wasn't comfortable with that arrangement and wondered why no one said anything during the two hours we were there? That, and given the failure of the whole experience, found us suggesting that this meal be taken care of.

Not just no, but hell no. It was my first and last time there. Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,9,1,1,vCUyXYjOVmiaS69xevu03Q

Speaking of the menu, it had a great number of selections and definitely some new things we hadn't noticed at other Thai places.
The food was fresh and had really great flavors. They give a good sized portion, I had leftovers for lunch the next day! 
The restaurant was really clean and kept up well. It had a quiet relaxed atmosphere. The prices are pretty general for Thai food. It's definitely on our favorites list!",zblbAz9PqlVlZ3Hqm38k4Q,0,0,5,X6e-SWR0t310ESXT2x7yIQ
5696234,2011-02-28,1,0ueq5zB3NqLbh93KYYNIHQ,"I attended a Yelp Event that was held at Thai Grill with a invite from my friend Dan P.

Like Dan P., I've been here a few times in the past couple of years and this is the first time I've been back since they changed ownership.

I ordered the Beef Jerky, which was very good.  I tried the green curry with shrimp and it was very spicy for a medium hotness.  It is still good.  

Surprisingly, the Yellow Curry with chicken was very good.  It's as good as my mom's yellow curry with chicken.  I think my mom is going to kill me for saying Thai Grill's yellow curry is better then hers.

The next dish I sampled was the Jungle Curry, which I am not a huge fan because it was really watery.  This is to be expected as it is Jungle curry, so no coconut milk.

Overall it was a really good event and the food was excellent.  I need to go to a few more yelp event.",AtujfYZ6sbBu_JM32nxPsg,3,3,4,mXFkPmMrUDbaGMJ09cCXSg

The food here is superb & very authentic.  The Pad Thai (beef), Pad See Ew (beef), Yellow Curry, and House fried rice were all excellent, all solid 7.5/10 easily.  Coming from LA where there are lots of Thai restaurants, this place is easily top 5 Thai restaurants I've experienced.  

Unfortunately the prices are little expensive at $10 a plate.    Also the server declined our 10% discount when we showed him our check in (he said it doesn't work for to-go orders).  I felt like he was too lazy to process our order.",pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg,0,0,4,vrSBBwP-cax2rDhRQ4v8Kw

I arrived around 1:30pm, well within their lunch special promo period, and there was just a pair of dinners finishing up their lunch specials and an appetizer. The restaurant which looks small on the outside but rather large once you enter and round the corner to get a better look of their interior.  I wouldn't be surprise if some wizards or witches placed the Undetectable Extension Charm on this place.

After scanning their lunch special menu and consulting the reviews on Yelp, I opted to get their Duck Curry from the regular menu.  The food was prepared quickly and brought out by the waitress/cashier, along with a bowl of rice.

The Duck Curry was good. I liked the curry flavor and thought it was good, but I didn't care too much for the canned pineapple chunks that was used in its preparation.  There were plenty of duck pieces in this dish, and those tasted great (like it was cooked separately then added to the curry near the end of the preparation).  The only major disappointment was the soggy rice that was served.

As far as Thai food goes, it is not in the top half ranking of the local Thai restaurants that I have tried.  But I will give it a try in the future if I am in the area or if there is another UYE, where I can get to try more of their menu items.

Ambiance 3/5:  A lot of Thai decorations in this relatively large restaurant, but the TV on the wall with the analysis of the up coming NFL season and their predictions (which i didn't mind) did not contribute to the Thai ambiance.

Food  3/5:  It was A-OK.  Which means it was decent, but I was not blown away by it and already planning a return visit for dinner or another meal within the next few days.

Service:  4/5  The waitress checkd up on me and refilled my water without having to be asked.

Price/Value:  3/5:  Reasonably priced, and very much in line with other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.

Location:  Located in the NW part of town, not too far if you work or live near the North Las Vegas Airport.

3 stars.  Hopefully I can like it more after future visits, but for now, just A-OK.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,u6pNWNcLIh3QG8GhWS4n-A

Empty tables, except for the staff eating in the dining room. The first thing that catches my eye is the glass of water, lots of random floating white bits. This is not your usual dirty glass mind you, there were a substantial number of things on my glass and of my companion's glass.

We ordered a Thai Iced Tea since the water was no good. Fortunately this was clean, and tasted pretty good.

For entrees, we got Chicken Phad Thai, Pan Nang Beef, and Screaming Tiger.  The Phad Thai had decent flavor, and was quite plentiful for a lunch special under $7.  The Pan Nang Beef was quite different.  My companion asked for it mild but was still a bit spicy and grease was covering the top of the curry. It was quite poorly made and to date only one place in this city prepares it well.  The Screaming Tiger was decent.  Lightly marinated beef that was grilled to medium and sliced thin, served with steamed brocolli and carrots.  It had a tamarind soy dipping sauce (at least that's what it tasted like.)

Overall, the experience was mediocre, and the total of the bill was about $30 for two people with 3 entrees and 2 drinks.",Y_polWPxlC9e9EzAte-6PQ,0,0,2,9VqtUaXYerYCJvE5GiHb_w
