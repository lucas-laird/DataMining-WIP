894670,2017-09-27,0,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,"First and foremost, it's McDonald's - the food is always going to be, for lack of a better term, ""McDonald's-y"". Now that that's out of the way, let's talk decor: it's the fanciest fast food joint I've ever stepped into! There's a chandelier and flat screen TV, and depending on the day, even fresh cut flowers. It looks like what a McDonald's should look like in a Strip casino. If you care about ambiance, then this place will fit the bill. 

*Families/Play Area
For families with young children, there's a sweet play area that's closed off to the rest of the restaurant. For child-free patrons, this means that when kids are a-screamin', you won't have to give mom or dad the side eye. Parents, there's a good amount of seating in this area (booths, benches & tables, etc.), so you can spread your baby gear out without worry. Take that much needed break while your kids run around in there! It can get pretty busy and crowded in there (lunchtime/weekends), but if you time it right, you can have the place almost to yourself. 

*Customer Service
I have no complaints here. In general, everyone I've encountered has been cordial, helpful, and seem not to loathe doing their job. If that's not a win in this day and age, then I don't know what is.

*Cleanliness
There's always someone cleaning the tables or mopping the floor, and the women's bathroom is always stocked with paper products. 

*Drive-Thru/Traffic
When you leave via Badura Ave., beware the mess that is the drive-thru entrance. I've tried to leave a couple times that way, but got stuck behind several cars waiting for someone to kindly let us outgoing traffic through. If you see that, avoid it at all costs. You may be waiting there for a good ten minutes because people are THAT concerned about you ""cutting"" in front of them for drive-thru service.

First off, I walk in and there's a guy texting on his phone behind the front counter and behind the shift lead. If this Corporate location is attempting to make McDonald's look more upscale and professional, then the employees should be the part as well. Texting in front of customers is unacceptable, whether on break or not. If you're on break, you should be using your cell phone in a non-public area, out of view of guests. Second, the shift lead that took my order rang up the wrong special order on my Crispy Chicken Classic because she was distracted by engaging in conversation with co-workers... which should stop completely when a guest is present.

2711752,2018-03-09,2,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,"I pretty much only use the drive thru here, however I have been inside once, and like others have said, it is really fancy. Back to the drive thru:

Because of the stores layout in the parking lot, at busy times (which seem like all the time) it can be a pain to ""line up"" the cars. It's almost Mad Max like. You have cars trying to leave, cars trying to cut through, cars trying to park and everyone else is just trying to get to the drive thru. It's not unusual to have cars all the way back in the street waiting to get in. Honestly this isn't this McDonald's fault, so not counting it against them, just letting you know, you need to be proficient in your driving skills because they will be put to the test.

As far as drive thru service goes, 90% of the time everything goes through great. I can't remember the last time they messed up an order which when it comes to fast food, is pretty impressive. Also 90% of the time if you can get your car in the drive through, it moves through at a steady pace. One complaint is the drink options aren't listed on the menu, so I just go off of memory, but it would be nice to know what drinks they have without having to be the guy that asks ""what drinks do you have?""

As others have said, late night it gets ""weird"". It's like all the new or dumb employees work late nights. Talking midnight+. Just really slow, you have to repeat your order a lot, etc. I guess it's a sign that I shouldn't be eating fast food at midnight.

Last but not least, this McDonald's doesn't escape the infamous ""broken shake machine"". You would think with all the McDonald's in the world they would have solved the ""shake machine"" issue. They always seem to say ""it's down because of cleaning"". Either I'm just so unlucky that I time it so that it's always down, or this shake machine is so clean it could be used as a piece of sterilized medical equipment. I don't know, maybe put in two machines, use one and clean the other. The worst so far was a couple of weeks ago they advertised the Shamrock shake. I ordered one but this time I got ""shake machine is broken"". Probably broke from being cleaned non-stop. Whatever came back the next day, STILL broke!! Skipped a day, came back still broken! First, I know, I go to McDonald's way too much, but this time I said ""dude this thing has been broken for a week"". The employee actually informed me that yeah it's been broken for a week and there is ONLY ONE GUY IN LAS VEGAS THAT FIXES A MCDONALD'S SHAKE MACHINE! Well, I know what my next job is: being the SECOND guy to fix a McDonald's shake machine. Seriously, McDonald's, train more people to fix shake machines. Put in spare shake machines. Do an investigation on why they break so much or need to be cleaned every couple hours. Solve this or just take them off the menu and put up a sign admitting defeat and say ""we no longer sell shakes, it's just too hard"". Take a hint from Wendy's: there can be riots, floods, nuclear war, zombie apocalypse, and Wendy's will always get you a frosty. You have a better chance hitting the lotto than getting a shake at McDonald's.

In summary, if you can brave the car situation to get TO the drive thru. Know what drink you want from memory. Don't go super late. And never want a shake, this place is for you. Seriously I go here more than I should and besides those few things, the food is fast and fresh, and the employees are pretty cool.

Oh one last thing..... Why if I buy a 10 piece chicken nuggets I get TWO sauces, but if I buy a 20 I get three? It's like haggling with a car dealership. Seriously, just give me 4 sauces for a 20 and 2 for a 10. Don't try to jip us that one sauce.",gij38wU44AZtOq8AXSeKaQ,0,0,4,0da0eyNuwFfo9BNIKWiUWw

You could automatically tell she doesn't have kids by the way she spoke to my child.
UPDATED 4/30/2017
The lobby looks to be cleaned more often. One thing I did appreciate was as soon as the play area cleared, someone came to clean the dirty tables and floor. I'm concerned by how cramped the table are in the play land. Towards the tables in the corner, you might have to squeeze in depending on the size of your bottom. The food still needs improvement, like the fries being fresh no matter when I order them. Also, why does the lobby seem cold, like the A/C is always on. 
One thing I do look forward to is seeing the cashiers, the ones in the black regular crew shirts. They are attentive to my children (my kids order their own food with gift cards). A manager once deleted one of their orders because both orders were the same, but only one was given their food.

Because of all this, most of my experiences here has been with the drive thru. However, the other day the drive thru line was literally lined up into Badura Avenue, so I parked and walked inside to get my egg mcmuffin fix. I have to say that the interior of this McDonalds is definitely much nicer than your typical location. It was very clean and had a more stylish design, at least by McDonalds standards.

The employees here have always been nice enough and the service is typically performed in a timely manner. 

It serves a very specific purpose for me and I will keep coming back. 

I like this place. It is A-OK.

Ok here goes, when we first walked in I noticed all the fake plants everywhere, and the fountain, and the bench. Am I at McDonald's or an old ladies house? By far the strangest mcds I've ever been to. Then it gets more interesting, the inside is a poor attempt at making this a hip lounge. With damask wallpaper and a small sitting type lounge area with a cheap chandelier, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and did I mention the guy passed out sleeping in this ""lounge"" area? Random men were walking in and out of the restrooms, I truly felt like I was in the twilight zone. 

Now onto the service, we had a fairly simple order, and not only did they get it wrong not once, but 3 times, and gave us an attitude with it. This isn't rocket science people. Learn to speak English.

4464596,2017-06-07,0,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,"Classiest McDonald's restaurant I've ever visited with the most classless management.

I came in and ordered my burger the same way I always do... ""ketchup and cheese only."" I've been ordering that way since I was a child and I'm now feeling old AF. It's practically motor memory now to speak my order exactly like so. 

The food came quick. It was like lightning. I give them that much. In the short minute I waited for my food, I couldn't help but acknowledge this is the nicest, most presentable McDonald's I've ever been to. I was notably impressed with their clean, neat look. My food arrived and I sat myself down. I opened my burger for an accuracy check to see immediately it was not made as ordered. My receipt showed it was not due to the food prep staff, it was an order taking error. The cashier was polite at least... just incorrect. No big deal.

My problem lies in what seemed to be their manager/supervisor on duty. A short woman with short hair and a tie. I can only assume she was the manager because she was the only one I noticed with a tie on. I caught her in a free moment and politely pulled her to the side to whisper how my burger was made incorrectly so no attention was drawn to the guests in line. She took it from me after I explained my order and walked away. No ""sorry about that,"" no ""we'll fix it,"" no anything. Just grabbed it and walked away with what appeared to be an annoyed eye roll. 

Where my problem had escalated was that I (no exaggeration) waited 6-8 minutes for them to remake a burger they originally made in 1 minute. I watched a number of those people who were waiting in line not only place their orders but receive them with in that time. Which shows me their priority was not in retaining guests so much as immediate profit generating. I stood at a counter where she passed me by several time to serve others with a tray full of fries that had gotten warm at that point before she finally retrieved my burger. 

Icing on the cake moment... she handed me the burger as I simultaneously thanked her loud enough for her to hear and walked off. No ""you're welcome,"" no ""thank you for your patience,"" no ""sorry for the wait"" no apology of ANY KIND for that matter. No words again. She just walked off. 

It's one thing to see an employee with poor service etiquette as a front facing representative of your business, but to see that poor service extends to your management team is a problem of concern. I really hope a manager reads this and reevaluates who is leading their team, what examples they are setting for their front line staff to follow, and how they are being received by their guests. Even as I am writing this review, the right column highlights two 2-star reviews, and two 1-star reviews. What they are doing is clearly not working the way it should be and this could have easily been the most impressive McDonald's I've ever been to in my life had it not been for the way their staff is trained.

Again, a few min went by and she came back with our food order but did not even bother to ask us if we would like ketchup or napkins (which we wanted to ask by the way). Without saying one word or even a look at us, she closed the window again before my boyfriend could ask for ketchup and napkins. 

We're extremely disappointed about how this McDonalds has such poor customer service. We usually come here and haven't had any problems in the past with our food and service. Granted that this place is a fast food joint, they should still uphold to good customer service no matter where you're at.",iqvQ-4xBNIoBQbMp5S7_AQ,0,0,1,h-fblEsiDRDhaLM_04agzw

I work in the food industry and fast food or not, you should always think about the quality your giving your customers. Never eating there again.",X-YE-0Mv_gFn_5ZDklZc5A,0,0,1,MDActeC0UOMAbb8KDWbaDA

The lady asked me ""Would you like something else like a diet coke or something?"" Yeah like instead of a hot latte to start my day at 5am I'd prefer a diet coke :rolls eyes:. Today when I ordered breakfast (one sausage egg mcmuffin, a sausage biscuit and two hash browns) i noticed my bag was a little light so I looked and the mcmuffin wasn't inside. I let her know and they gave me the sausage mcmuffin. I opened it before leaving and there was no egg on it. I let her know and she said I needed to pay for it. I told her that's ridiculous that if i didnt even check i wouldn't have got anything let alone the egg. The manager got an attitude and said ""You know what forget you"" and gave me my mcmuffin with egg. I mean come on. Seriously. Fix your customer service AND your latte machine and stop wasting my time in the morning when I'm trying to get to work. I wish I could give ZERO stars.",H3qCw3olj33MbF6R_Xh0sA,0,0,1,oBDp2tegX3lK_cC1tIMX6Q

5769359,2017-05-10,0,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,This place sucks ! They feed the drive through line and make it a priority while the walk in customers have to wait an extremely long time for their food. This is now the second time this has happened. I ordered the food at 903 and received it at 918 as waiting in the lobby. Not cool. The place is clean inside and staff friendly and he parking lot is a shit show near the drive through with two lanes funneling into one line. There's a play area inside that's often noisy and chaotic. It's the only location close by without traveling to blue diamond. I guess if you want your food hit the drive through line don't go inside you'll regret the wait time and get frustrated fast.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,mBbvc3xP5qBP0do5G9b9aw

It's near my home, so I have been coming here for the last seven years at least once a month, if not more. Don't judge me. I won't stop here for breakfast anymore. I only like the Egg McMuffin, but when I did order breakfast, the muffin was always burnt. Sometimes to the point that it was completely inedible. The first time it happened, the smell of burnt toast lingered in my car for a week. I of course immediately took it back and they exchanged it for something else. After a few more visits with similar experiences during breakfast, I just drive by now and go to Jack n the Box up the street. On the plus side, the regular menu is always hot and fresh. The staff here is not the friendliest, but my orders have always been correct, and I don't really go to a drive thru for the service.",-ycajT56HnL3RNeUQV8HWA,0,0,3,5nI4uAtJ8CFeJbRcC8g_UQ
5868933,2017-07-05,0,mfQfNIb3TYeBSxsN1WD8eA,I've let more than a few slide but this is happening way too many times! Pls managers inform your employees to check the orders if they are complete before handing the order out to your customers. This is the fourth or fifth time it's happened to us n this time we are missing all our hash browns we ordered and thats half of our order! I can understand if there were a bunch of orders but it was only pancakes and hash browns. How could they have missed that?? Always missing something with our order and normally I shrug my shoulders shake my head and just let it go... we don't often go to McDonald's to start with but once in a little while when my kids asks for hash browns or French fries and chicken nuggets we give it to them but how can we do that if our order is most of the time incomplete?!!!,tlAhD1bg5FBzQj4bdGW22A,0,0,2,35baPIcCYP544rgm3mK7hw
