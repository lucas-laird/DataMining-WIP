Me and the bachelor party of 15 other guys got reservations here because we didn't want spend $200+ each on a nice dinner on the strip. We were not disappointed. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. The server Laura also added to our night. She fit right in with all the boys in our private dinning room. She started the night out with shots for everyone and then she said ""trust her"" I'm glad we listened, cause she kept bring appetizers and oysters, etc. She was spunky and kept firing little one liners to all the guys. She even brought a chocolate milk out to one of the younger guys who was ""acting like a baby"". Honestly it was the perfect dinner for our group. Get the bone in NY and trust Laura ! Oh and Apps, drinks, and steaks for everyone was less than 1900 bucks for 17 guys. That same meal would have been around 4,000 bucks on the strip.",mjc2ph41J4eACipqWE6xoQ,2,1,5,1Xh0RAyaDDAGL4durhR6eQ

The selection of foods offered, ranged from wonderfully fresh shell fish and smoked salmon, to custom-built omelets that were on point , to delicious and juicy prime rib, lamb and turkey. The bottomless champagne, mimosas and Bloody Marys, were the icing on the proverbial cake.
This restaurant has recently been remodeled and has been transformed into a handsome venue for a steak dinner or any other special meal. The service was top notch, friendly and very professional.  You will want to come back again and again. And all you wine lovers will be in heaven.  The wine library as you enter will take your breath away and soothe your thirst for all things grape!!
Again, please keep in mind BILLY for your server.  He made our meal all the more special with his affability, charm, attention to detail, as well as his special attention to all of our needs.

We started off with the sautéed mushrooms, which were amazing, I always order mushrooms and these were up there with any of them. We both ordered filet mignon, I got the 10 oz, which is huge for a filet. She got the petite 7 oz, which is still bigger than alot of places regular filet mignon. It comes with a house salad, which was carefully hand picked, like every piece of lettuce was perfect and mushrooms, sayce of your liking, tomato, and more,  just a perfect house salad for me. The whole time they give you fresh bread, pretzel, which is AMAZING, sourdough, and squaw. So after being careful not to get full and oace myself before my steak came, my steak arrives, and it was a perfect filet mignon. My girlfriend's petite was a perfect medium rare aswell as mine, both had excellent flavor.. I got delicious buttery mashed potatoes, so good didn't have to request gravy or au jus. We also had the sautéed asparagus which is mre her thing, but I tried aswell and I usually don't eat them too much, but these were excellent. shocked about the $$$ Price Tag in the magazine they give you in the hotel.

I was happy to sit down at the bar, have my bartender Carrie, greet me with a genuine hello. Asked how my day was and if I would be dinning at the bar, or just having a drink. I decided to eat at the bar. I asked her what I should I try. For starters she suggested the pink grapefruit, mind you there is no grapefruit in this amazing cocktail. And oh was it yummy.  From there I knew Carrie, could take me on a ""limo"" ride. So she did, suggesting the I start with shrimp cocktail, and for dinner a must have, king crab. Oh Carrie, you were spot on. The bar was steady, as the restaurant. The manager Diego, stopped by asking how I was enjoying my pink grapefruit, I saw a lot of interaction between Diego, and staff.

1059397,2015-05-20,1,0YG_kM5caZhtwd6nbnei6A,"Well ... the Orchid and I had an event to celebrate (and as is my custom, I told no one; I don't do ""happy-happy-joy-joy"" and have been known to walk out of an establishment if they inflict this type of thing on me), and we had always had positive experiences at the Broiler.  I phoned Palace Station, and was informed that the steak house is now the Charcoal Room.  I figured, how much different can it be?  I made rservations.

Come the night in question .. about five days ago.  We walk in on time (7:15 pm), and the place was almost empty.  Always a little scary in a ""first-time"" place.  But, we went in anyway.  Reactions and review follow.

Atmosphere.  Typical ""wanna-be-a-steak-house"" decor ... lots of reds and oranges, subdued lighting, et cetera.  Horseshoe booths.  Two-top and four-top tables.  Pretty standard.  Note that despite being inside a busy casino, we had very little ambient noise during our meal.  We did ask to be placed far from the entrance, specifically for this purpose; how much noise abatement was placement and how much was site design, I can't say.  A nice touch.

Observation: the Broiler had an extensive salad bar, including the largest asparagus spears I have ever seen.  (In the interest of full disclosure, the Great Bearded Bird is a sucker for a good salad bar, and LOVES asparagus.)  No such amenity exists at the Charcoal Room.

Service.  The hostess (I believe her name was Lauren) was pleasant and prompt, and got us to a table before I could stop talking.  Nicely done, my dear.  Waiter (Francisco) introduced himself within three minutes of our being seated, and told us he would be serving us with the aid of another staff member (female; I missed her name, unfortunately).  Beverages were delivered quickly, and by my wife's request, soft drinks were served in the wine glasses (her only concession to the event being celebrated).  Refills of beverage, questions about the menu, suggestions on dishes, and special requests were all handled quickly, pleasantly, and professionaly.  Once again, nicely done.

Food.  It starts getting just a little rocky right about here.  The Orchid passed on an appetizer, and I had half-a-dozen oysters on the half shell, as I hadn't had oysters in several years.  They were served in an aluminum contraption the size of a freight barge full of ice, with red cocktail sauce, grated horseradish and something that looked like a wine-based minionette.  The oysters were good, but the person who shucked them needs some more training; every oyster had relatively large chunks of shell in them.  Not pleasant having to fish them out of your mouth.  (I know this old man needs more minerals in his diet, but seriously ...)
I went away from my normal carnivorous tendencies (that being a rib-eye), and tried the King Cut prime rib.  Not bad, and prepared properly (medium rare, delightfully pink), but frankly, I've had better.  I added scallops - another weakness of mine - but to my taste, they were not worth 3-for-$14.00.  Side ordered the asparagus (as noted above), and again it just kinda fell short.
Orchid ordered the sea bass at the recommendation of our waiter, and that was spot-on.  I had a taste, and as much as fin-fish normally isn't my go-to, I would order this again for myself in a heartbeat.  Wonderfully flaky, moist and ""ding-ding-ding"" good.  She ordered the creamed spinach - one of her favorite dishes - and picked another winner.  She ordered the sweet potato, and was quite pleased with it.  (I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes; I trust her judgment, as I didn't taste it.)  Dessert time came, and whatever she ordered (I want to say the carrot cake?) she was also quite pleased with.  (The Great Bearded Bird is diabetic, and therefore tries not to even pay attention to the sweets on a menu.)  All in all, I was happy, but the Orchid was thrilled (and isn't that just the way it should be?)

Will I return?  Probably, with a few mental notes about what NOT to order.

1186352,2016-11-28,0,0YG_kM5caZhtwd6nbnei6A,"WOW!!! Yes 4 exclamation points!  This place was ruined to me by 1 server and the cook who couldn't follow orders. We ate here with a group of 13 on a Sunday night. Service started off kind of good drink orders taken, wine served ($25 cork fee not bad) , soon after orders taken by two waiters, one for each side of table. They start at end of table, but since the first person on our side was not ready and for some reason our waiter thought no one else was ready, he had announce ""well no one is ready on my side"" ?, when the whole time we were ready and it took us a couple times to get his attention. Order was taken then they brought bread (the bon bread is good). 
I ordered the Kitchen Sink Cesar, and fried chicken. (I don't care what people say when they say I should of ordered steak at a steak house, don't serve it if you can't cook it.)  My wife ordered house salad with the sea bass broiled with no salt or pepper. Didn't really pay attention to what everyone else had, but I was told to get the salad . 

The kitchen sink salad was really good, that horseradish dressing was tasty. My wife's salad was how she wanted it with no dressing. Then entrees were served I got a  fried boneless chicken breast that they promote as buttermilk fried chicken. (In my mind I'm getting fried chicken) not one big dried SALTY AS CAN BE chicken finger,  that tasted like a salt lick. It was served on top of what seemed liked homemade chips with a side of gravy something, and was one of the saltiest things I have eating since salt. Not to mention they completely over cooked it ,which I didn't because the handful of salt on the chicken was enough to mention.  My wife's fish came out pan seared in butter seasoned with salt and pepper and over cooked .  She ate it anyway because she don't like to say anything.

The waiter seemed apologetic and ask me what else I wanted, I asked for the house salad. That's when service got a little spotty. We had to fill our own wine and the help seemed scarce. Lol ! He brought the salad and when I took a bite I almost spit it out because it had SALT ON IT! Who puts salt on a salad , smokers? I thought I was crazy but then someone else at the table tried it and reassured me the white crystals on my salad was in fact salt. I told the waiter that it had salt on it  and I must of offended him when I asked if this was a joke only because I never seen salt poured onto a salad, especially on a salad for a customer who just sent something back for being to salty. Seems like the joke was on me this night. Again who puts salt on a salad? Then he started arguing with me and basically called me a liar so I swiped my finger on the plate full of salt and said what's this white stuff then. Left him mumbling as he walked away with an attitude and if he was that bitter he should of ask me to step outside. I don't know what happened to the customer is always right when it comes down to what we decided to eat and how we want it. We never saw that waiter the rest of the night. The new one was better anyway.  Manager did offer me something from the menu, but by then I was over it. I did order the Creme brûlée that I wish I didn't because it was bland no vanilla flavor. I had two spoons and stopped  taste like a dirty refrigerator.

The Seafood Jackpot is an amazing and indulgent way to start a group meal here, but the staple apps are the scallops, French onion soup (so hearty!), and the steakhouse chopped salad (huge portion, too).

The pan-seared scallops, if not chosen as an app, are also a great entrée. The King cut prime rib is exactly what it should be, the Colorado lamb chops are delicate but hearty with a perfect merlot reduction.

Sides are mostly potato-based, but solid. Desserts vary but are all typically well-executed. Only bummed that they no longer seem to have the beef tartare on the menu- perhaps it is now only offered as a special?

We had a super time there a couple of Sundays ago, when ace waiter Timothy served us with enthusiastic efficiency. I had the skirt steak, though there are more swish versions of beef on the menu; as guests of our fine host my husband and I both chose that modestly-priced dish. I was advised by Timothy that my steak may get tough if well-done and charred, but I said ""not to worry"". When it arrived, rare in the middle, I sent the meat back to be thoroughly cooked. It came back perfectly broiled and tender as could be; the skirt steak entrée was a large portion compared to other steakhouse fare these days, beautifully presented on the plate. I chose the optional peppercorn sauce, which was a very tasty ""au jus""-style liquid in a separate little pitcher--there are other traditional sauces available as well.

This hidden gem is located inside the Palace Station casino. I previously visited the steakhouse a few times before the re-model when it was called ""The Broiler."" I didn't really classify it as a steakhouse before, but it was definitely in my top ten Las Vegas restaurants of all time. Based on past positive only experiences, I chose this place to celebrate my recent birthday.

I was skeptic when I first walked in as it now had all the fancy shenanigans of a typical Strip steakhouse, and the hostess was meh (before it was in a casual setting with family-friendly service, along with a free salad bar). Our party of four was seated only to find out that two napkins were missing well into our dinner (had to eventually ask for them as the staff never noticed).

Things turned around though, and the entire staff's service ended up being top-notch. Food was brought out in a timely manner, and drinks were never empty. The Porterhouse was superb for $36 (medium rare with amazing peppercorn steak sauce). The lobster chowder was delicious and massive (I wasn't aware of the large quantity, and our server politely asked if we'd like to separate the portion into two separate bowls). Not bad at all for $10. The chowder and bread alone could be a meal in itself. The pan-seared Sea Bass was excellent as well, along with the asparagus and fries.

A somewhat upscale environment while still retaining local prices and above-average friendly service is an awesome combination. I'd rank The Charcoal Room #3 overall on my list of American steakhouses in Las Vegas. I'll definitely be back.",b1wjZL3EBm4h2vbeXjfcTA,2,1,4,FFTCtDPDybS3BYz1ih8U1A

Came here by chance. Mission was for The Oyster Bar but the wait was so long and I had several beastie drunk friends getting the munchies so we just went next door to The Charcoal Room. 

Staff was great. Friendly and helpful. 
Some dishes were better than the next but all were not too shabby. 

Started with Crab Stuffed Clams and Oyster Rockefeller. Clams were really rich. Too rich I had to eat it with the complimentary bread. Much more enjoyable with the bread. 
Oysters were alright... Not much into cooked oysters. 
The King Cut Prime Rib and Creamed Corn was delicious! Tender indeed! Those 2 items were my favorite. 
Filet Mignon, Roasted Chicken and Lobster Tail were all a tad bit dry.

It is, after all, a steakhouse, and my bone-in ribeye was a first class steak - flavorful, tender, and well-cooked.  On top of that, it was reasonably priced and came with a fluffy baked potato and house salad included.  My wife ordered the sea bass, and she raved about it.  We both started with the French Onion Soup, which my wife liked but which I thought was a little salty.  It tasted a bit as if someone had taken a good bowl of onion soup and dropped a beef bouillon cube into it.  So, the food was mostly good.

Now let's back up.  Getting to the restaurant means making your way through the length and breadth of the Palace Station casino, which is somewhat akin to how I imagine travelling steerage on the Titanic must have been.  Once you arrive though, the ambiance is nice - appointed in dark red and black with a slightly retro design.  I would have liked it better if the casino was not visible from our table and - the common scourge of Vegas restaurants - big screen TV's were visible at the bar were playing ""the game.""  But soft background music ran the gamut from Dean and Frank to rock.  The tables were spaced a bit tightly for my taste, but sitting in one of the booths that ran around the edge of the room was comfortable.

The room was almost empty on a Thursday night, so we were seated immediately.  A nice variety of fresh breads appeared immediately.  Our server, Gary, was quick with the cocktails and quick to take our orders.  Each course was served promptly, and Gary remained attentive throughout the meal.

So, all in all, this was a nice dinner and we will go back.  Also a nice value - cocktails, wine, tax and tip included we  were out the door for about $150.  Pretty good for a high end steak house.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,4,AP7ByOPRpU1KxV8s3mM3Hw

We live pretty close to Palace Station and used to dine in their old restaurant, The Broiler, pretty often a few years back.  I had heard from someone at work that The Charcoal Room was good and we should try it sometime so I suggested it to my husband and we decided to head over there.  
The room was obviously renovated from The Broiler days which isn't a bad thing but it unfortunately now has windows looking on to the casino which has decidedly ruined the ambiance. They need to frost the windows or something... the ""view"" is atrocious.  We were seated in the booth right behind the hostess station which I think was a punishment for having no reservation (although, the room was half empty). It was fine until the noise from the machines right outside of the open doors of the restaurant reached a crescendo of binging, beeps and ringing where we kept having to ask the other to repeat themselves.  At that point, we asked our sever, Timothy, if the doors could be closed due to the noise which he promptly got permission for and did. It was amazing what an improvement that was. The next time we go, we will be sure to request a booth near the back of room which looked much more quiet and inviting. 
Now, the food... We were happily surprised to see the wine list and menu prices. It was very reasonable. We had a bottle of Kendall Jackson Cabernet (one of our favorites) for only $40. We were also pleased that the meals included the house side salad and choice of potato - like the ""good ol' days"". When Timothy (Tim), came to take our order, he said that the special was surf and turf - 2- 7oz petite filets and a 28 oz Maine lobster tail
 to share... that was a winner!  It was also reasonable at $99 for the dinner for two. The house salad was fresh and delicious and the main course, was perfect!  Everything cooked perfectly and hot. The lobster was some of the best we ever had. We decided that the next time we will order the NY steak and lobster entrees separately and just share them as we both enjoy that cut more than the filets. We shared the rice pudding for dessert and although, it wasn't the best we had, it was good enough. 
Overall, I would say that the service was excellent. The food was also some of the best we have had in a while... reminiscent of Old Vegas and being natives, that is right up our alley.

Not wanting something too heavy, I opted to get just soup (the lobster chowder) to jump start a night of feasting, which would culminate at the famous Oyster Bar at Palace Station.

The oysters were fresh and slightly sweet, lacking much brininess (which is fine by me). I used lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.

The lobster chowder was surprisingly filling, decadent, and rich. There were adequate bits of lobster. The soup was thick, creamy, and quite indulgent. I also got to try the crab cakes, which were splendid as well. The coating was crispy and light; the meat was fresh and tender.

I would definitely return to the Charcoal Room. They have some pretty good looking steaks. I'd for sure try the prime rib next time!",CdQhdJeP4IUWQlMasapkCQ,15,13,4,7MFWdl9u3dXP3XxnEvDVUQ

Spicy calamari was overcooked so that ot was hard to chew. Peppers tasted like pure brine, no heat at all.

The dessert, well that carrot cake slice was big enough for both of us to share and left over. Just great.

While in town for CES, we had a hard time making a reservation at several steakhouses so finally were relieved to find The Charcoal Room had space immediately. Now I see why. The service was a bit saccharine - our waitress was polite but not necessarily knowledgeable in what to suggest. I felt she was merely sharing what she presumed was popular as opposed to what was actually good. It didn't matter anyway. The sides were enormous but hard to enjoy without the main entree. Then after waiting at least 30 minutes for the food the arrive, the prime rib was thoroughly over done. I'm not a picky eater and have happily grazed on food most meticulous eaters would scoff at but this was an abhorrence. The meat was extremely tough to cut through and not for just me - for every single person in our 5 person party. Even for my colleague who ordered fillet mignon, his serving was almost unrecognizable. To top it off, the manager walked by and ask how everything was. In hindsight, we probably should have complained but we were tired from a day at the conference and not convinced we would have been properly compensated for our dissatisfaction anyway.

I will say the ambience is nice and there was a table of 8 ready for us at the designated time.  Having said that, the wait staff was efficient but not personable.  We had two small children with us and (as any parent knows), time is of the essence in term of getting food on the table for them.

Not a protein, a grain, a seed, a starch, a noodle, or a sauce.  NOTHING.  What?!  In 2017, in a time when plant-based diets are becoming increasingly adopted, THIS is REALLY the best you can do.

I was thinking of getting French onion soup but I noticed that steaks come with house salad and baked or mashed potatoes.  Asking my server about the size of the salad, he assured me it was large.  I opted to forego an appetizer and go instead with the 10 ounce filet, house salad with blue cheese dressing, and baked potato with butter, sour cream, and chives.  For dessert, I ordered carrot cake.

The salad was indeed very large with iceberg and romaine lettuce along with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and some other items.  The blue cheese dressing was very good and the server ground fresh pepper to taste.

The steak was a little too done for my order of blue.  It was more on the rare side than being less done than that.  I think too many chefs want to make sure they have a char look that they overcook when ordering blue.  The steak was very tasty and quite tender.  The vermouth mushroom butter ($2 charge) made no difference in taste.  The mushroom flavor nor vermouth were there.  I'd get the steak naked another time.  The baked potato was stuffed with the things mentioned above and was good.

For dessert, I ordered the carrot cake.  It was a large slice of classic cake.  It was a bit dry, however, as if it had been the exposed end from the day before.  It was more plain carrot cake without a lot of spice as some bakers do and except for the dryness, it was quite good.

Service was excellent.  

I am of two opinions about bundling the salad and potato as part of the cost of the steak.  On the one hand, I like the fact that you're not being charged a lot for separate items in your meal.  On the other hand, it would be nice to have soup instead of a salad and I'd order French fries any day of the week before I'd get a baked potato.  

I was made aware by my server that the sides were all very large so I stayed with just the potato that came with the meal and that was more than enough.  This is an OK place to have dinner.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,7,3,nD4UNwk7_mTPEO1jkKGjUw

That pretty much sums up my review for the Charcoal Room.  Don't let the fact that both Charcoal Rooms in Las Vegas is located inside a Station Casino.  This Charcoal Room and the one located inside the Sante Fe Station doesn't seem to get a lot of Yelp attention and I have no idea why.  For me, it's all about service, value, and taste. The Charcoal room delivers on all three.  First of all, service is ""as good as it gets"". You rarely have to wait, your orders are taken quick, food doesn't take forever, and your drinks are kept full.  And don't be surprised if almost every employee stops what they're doing to greet you.  Now that's what I call service.  The steaks at the Charcoal Room rival some of the high end establishments around town.  I swear, the Charcoal Room should have a blind taste test with the other steak joints out here.  I bet they come out on top or at least close. Their steaks are pretty damn good and literally melt in your mouth.  I have also tried their lobster, king crab legs, every side, most of their desserts, and some of their salads.  Besides their dry carrot cake, everything that I sampled didn't disappoint.  Trust me with this mini, non-informative review.  You can't go wrong with the Charcoal Room

We both had the petite filet mignon, mine medium-rare, hubby's medium, and each was cooked perfectly, just as we ordered.  The meat was flavorful, tender as a filet should be, and juicy.  The asparagus side we shared was outstanding - crisp-tender in a way that I can never get my own to be, and even though they ranged in thickness, each spear was cooked just right.  We also shared the giant baked potato, and it was giant indeed.  My hallmark for a great baked spud is one that is cooked so well that it doesn't need any butter or sour cream, and this one passed the test.  There was also bacon, cheese and chives brought with the potato to add more taste and calories.

Though we didn't order drinks or dessert, and our check was comparatively small by steakhouse standards (and even smaller, since The Charcoal Room is Strip quality without the Strip prices), the service was as attentive and friendly as possible.

A decent salad is served with the entree although it came with a lot of the core or stems of the lettuce leaves that one would think a restaurant trying to be a step up would want to use for the stock pot, if there actually is one in this kitchen.  I don't particularly care for extremely hot food so when I cut into the baked potato and it didn't steam I wasn't too concerned. My companion sent his back, pointing out it was old. I found it odd it had not been rubbed in butter or oil before baking. It did appear to have been washed though.  If you crave tough, rubbery Calamari be sure to order the appetizer. It is served with sliced peppers which are very flavorful.",nu9Jq6Oe-FkrRU1vaNGq2g,0,0,2,uQJVvWQAINT29Nu3JNjyyg

Casino restaurants are not my favorite places to eat solely because I don't like smelling cigarette smoke, when I eat.

The good thing about The Charcoal Room is it's enclosed in glass doors that block out the cigarette smell.

The muted lighting and decor give the setting a classic look.

Our server, Billy, is right up there with the best of them.  He is polished and pleasant!  For example, when my restaurant companion went to the restroom, Billy stopped by the table to fold his napkin.  I ordered a wedge salad and he didn't scoff at me for asking the kitchen to chop the salad.  

What I love about the menu is that it's not contrived, it's SOLID.  The restaurant doesn't need to use fancy names or highbrow ingredients.  The Charcoal Room has simply amazing food combinations that instantly stir your taste buds.  In fact, the menu has so many incredible staples it's hard to choose a dish.

I went with the blackened salmon.  The vegetables are a la carte.  I ordered the broccoli cooked medium.  

Everything was presented and flavored to PERFECTION!

The portions are quite hearty.  I had to get a to-go container and didn't have enough room for dessert.

When you visit The Charcoal Room, bring a robust appetite and anticipate that all of your fine dining senses will be satisfied.",aJRnjwJ3D4Knl9pRwOfKDg,4,2,5,I9w57sqj9N4E0xAA6YGpXw

The Charcoal Room is behind two heavy glass doors, and a wine sculpture, which blocks out the noises and lights from the slots.

They cook great steaks and seafood in classic steakhouse presentation with choices of French sauces or crust add-ons. I'm not a dessert person, but I was able to note how beautifully they are presented.

They make a decent supper club old fashioned and I enjoyed my large gin martini.

For dinner I had the rare New York steak with peppercorn sauce and sautéed mushrooms. The steak has a flavorful rub. My dining companion had the surf and turf special with a filet mignon and perfectly cooked shrimp and lobster tail.

The chef has been screwing with a long successful menu with items that are basically ""CRAP""

Cream Corn is gone - replaced by a crappy version of Mexican Street Corn. It was bland, completely unseasoned and inedible.

Scallops: They were RAW when served to us How did they get out of the kitchen? The REDO was OK, but this should never been have happened. It should have been caught before being served. AND no IDIOT puts ""green peas"" on a scallop DISH - NO ONE! UGLY, INEDIBLE, BURNED and DRY! - No sauce for the scallops either. A complete failure! 

Pretzel Bread: We were serve two sticks, but no refills - THE KITCHEN RAN OUT (at 7:30 pm)  - they said ""will have to cook some more.""  WTF!

Out Lobster and Filet were fine, but the incompetence of the kitchen with veggies, pretzel bread, raw scallops  and then the pea crap on the scallops RUINED an otherwise good meal.

Our server, Kevin, was PERFECT in every way and did all in his power to help us! We commend him greatly!

Please fix this before the Chef brings this restaurant DOWN!

It is a sizeable & lovely room with subdued lighting, many booths to be had, and enough friendly faces to greet us.

I ordered giant crab legs ($28) and my partner the Top Sirloin ($24).  We were promptly asked for our drink order & served a big basket of 4 kinds of breads, incl. a delicious sourdough & terrific walnut/raisin.  Then came substantial salads & we were happy with their ranch & bleu cheese.  But everything was over-shadowed by what followed:

Our server brought a little hot pot of butter & soon one pound of crab legs which were bigger than I've had in an order, & just as succulent.   Even the sautéed broccoli accompaniment was terrific.  My partner & I are not lovers of red meat, but the expression on his face made me realize he could convert real soon.  The Top Sirloin was beautiful on that plate & served  ""medium rare"" as ordered.  I had a taste & it melted in my mouth (oh, the memories of the days back in the Midwest where I often feasted at Chicago's Stockyards on prime rib).  The mashed potatoes weren't ordinary either (but a bit heavy on the salt).

Our server, Alexis, was a sweet young woman & most attentive.  And midway into the meal the maître'd   arrived to inquire how the meal was so far.  ""Divine"" said I.

[To add to our experience:  The Charcoal Room has its own restrooms, unusual in most casino restaurants].

I came here through recommendations from my parents, who found this place last year and have been raving about their high quality food since last year. 

First of all, the bone-in rib eye steak was amazing. The flavor was perfect and not too salty and it was cooked very evenly. The baked potato that came with the steak was also very good (for a baked potato). Even the salad before the entree was pretty good!

During the course of our dinner, I also had a chance to try my girlfriend's pan seared scallops and those were also really good.

I just loved our waiter! Gary was so attentive but not over-bearing but at the same time laid back and friendly.  I wish every waiter could be like Gary honestly.

$8 classic caesar salad- Fresh, cold romaine dressed with a house-made caesar dressing and garnished with a nice french bread crouton.  The dressing was nicely fishy so I'm betting they use real anchovies.  It was a tad over-dressed but still really good.  I really liked the shaved grana padano cheese on top. 

$12 jumbo shrimp cocktail- Came with 4 huge shrimp in a lovely metal container with delicious horseradish cocktail sauce.  They were very fresh and delicious and I highly recommend this appetizer. 

$11 Fried calamari- Had  really good mix of tentacles and rings and was fried perfectly.  Batter did not fall off the calamari, even when dipped into the tasty tomato sauce.  I loved the addition of the cherry peppers on top.  If you like calamari, you'll be pleased with this appetizer.  

$28 petite filet- Very good and tender cut of meat.  Perfectly cooked to medium and seasoned very well.  At least 2 inches thick and I enjoyed every bite.  I took half home with me and it was even good warmed up in the microwave.  

$32 Lobster tail- Probably one of the biggest lobster tails I've ever eaten.  It was so moist and juicy and had a lovely grilled flavor.  It was served with a nice wedge of lemon and drawn butter.  Probably one of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten.
