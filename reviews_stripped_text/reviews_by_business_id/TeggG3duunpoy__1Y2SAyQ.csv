The I cut into it and the coloring was kind of funny.. I inspected it better to come to the conclusion that about 98% of the patty consisted of some type of filler. bread maybe? I have no idea, it's like the color of breakfast sausage patties. I feel kind of grossed out eating this. I can see areas where there is actually hamburger in there to compare with the filler. I don't understand why anyone would have the audacity to make a ""hamburger"" patty this way. I am extremely disappointed, still hungry, and grossed out. Hamburger Steak is NOT recommended, it is NOT hamburger.",M_yuhPOTKwFoiO7Kc6jfUA,1,0,1,B8JBoW7RgkP7ZJqe6tP_Wg

452078,2014-08-20,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I had only one experience and that was ordering platters of food for a party which ended up quite delicious, I must say.

I was in Vegas recently for a birthday party and decided to have the party in our room instead of at a restaurant and ordered 3 platters.  Teri Chicken, Fried Noodles, and Egg Rolls.

Let me backtrack by saying that I came across Aloha Kitchen by accident, just driving around looking for somewhere to buy the food since I really didn't do much research beforehand.  After having bought a few things from Vons down the street, Aloha Kitchen caught my eye as I was driving along and since I was in a crunch, thought why not check it out since I was sure I'd be familiar with the food.

I asked if they sold platters and was given a party platter menu.  There were quite a few choices but I was a little hesitant at first because of the prices.  $60 for a large platter of Teri Chicken and Fried Saimin, and $40 for 100 pcs of Egg Rolls.  I was expecting 30 people.  I asked how long to make them and was told 30-40 mins.

I ordered and went about my business taking a little less than an hour before going back to pick up my order.  When I arrived, my order was ready and to my surprise, it was a lot larger than I thought it was going to be.  Of course I had to sample them and found that all items were quite tasty.  The Teri Chicken was lightly breaded and the sauce served on the side, every piece of Egg Rolls were cooked golden brown and crispy with a sweet chili sauce served on the side, and the Fried Saimin were mixed with a surprising amount of Charsiu Pork, as well as cabbage and egg.  

I ended up pleasantly surpised, having a lot of left over food and felt that it was well worth the price. 

In summary, considering the fact that I stopped in by chance and had no idea what this place was like, I was quite satisfied with my experience and would eat there again based on the food alone and would definitely order platters from them again.  The next time, I'll probably sit and eat in, and after reading previous reviews, I sincerely hope the service issues has been resolved and that my experience will be just as satisfying.",iD_JP0Dz0qPCGnfI-pPqdg,0,0,4,joAjbPtRY0chv3pFN4m_mA
455424,2013-10-14,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Let me first start by saying that I have never been a big fan of Aloha Kitchen. Being born and raised in Hawai'i, I am familiar with Hawai'i cuisine and Aloha Kitchen has always been just OK, nothing spectacular.  Living in Las Vegas, Aloha Kitchen has always been the ""last resort"" when wanting to eat Hawai'i cuisine. After my experience yesterday, I felt compelled to write this review. My boyfriend chose to eat here yesterday after visiting the UNLV campus. When we arrived, there was no one in line ordering, so we did not have to wait to place our order. We ordered saimin, adobo fried rice, a cheeseburger and a side of corned beef hash, There was one family of four who just received their food as we sat down. Every occupied table at that point had their food. The restaurant started to get busy as we waited for our food. After 15 minutes, we received our side of hash. Five minutes after that we got the saimin and cheeseburger. The adobo fried rice omelet took 30 minutes!!! RIDICULOUS!! How hard is it to make fried rice with already prepared pork adobo?!! Then about half way through my saimin, I found a hair in the soup!!! SO GROSS! At that time, the waitress was delivering food to a table next to us as I was telling my boyfriend about the hair. I know she heard what I said but made eye contact with me and walked away. I then took the bowl to the guy working the cash register. He apologized and then offered to make me a new bowl of saimin. At that point, I was so disgusted, that I declined offer. He did not offer any other compensation! He just took the bowl and turned away from me and walked to the kitchen. If I could, I would not give any stars but being that I have to select at least one, one it is. The food is a disappointment, the customer service is a disappointment...what more can I say!!!",aQTdYBHz2SzTyoO6x1r81w,2,0,1,7cZql1o62SVumgjTINBNaw

797411,2010-01-25,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Aloha Kitchen definitely satisfied my longest craving for local Hawaiian food.  Living on the East Coast does take a toll on the Local when it comes to food, and I knew that one of my biggest priorities when visiting Vegas was to find good Hawaiian grinds.

I found Aloha Kitchen on a random google search.  It was also the place of choice because it's about a 10-15 minute bus ride from the airport on the 109.  This is great for those of us who are cheap and like to save money by not renting a car and utilizing public transportation.  And, it literally drops you off right across the street.

The food selection was plentiful, so I had a really hard time deciding on something.  I ended up ordering a Hawaiian plate that included laulau, kalua pig, and the usual scoops of rice and ono mac salad.  In addition, I also ordered a couple of manapuas.  I tried to order poke, but they already ran out--and it was only noon!  You know when something runs out that quick, it has to be good.  Great for them, bad for me, I guess!  The funny thing is that I kept thinking ""you can't screw up laulau and kalua pig"", but then I had to remind of myself that you CAN.  It wasn't dry, too salty, or even mushy, which are sometimes an issue.  It was just like how it is back home in Hawai'i.

My partner had the katsu/curry plate really liked it.  Unfortunately, I was too much of a pig indulging in my meal to sample from his plate, so I personally can't attest to its goodness.  

Would I go back there again?  Absolutely!  Great location, great price, ono food--what else do you need?  Oh yes, the employees were very nice, too!",GET5FnW_pkS_6l7Rz20H4A,0,0,5,EYUYuztsE0DJlSB-Omc64w

Musubis: they were okay, but nori and spam were quite soggy prob due to the over use of Teri sauce

Mac salad: not that great..lacked flavor and had a salty base..texture of noodles were nice and firm though! 

Teri chicken: usually Teri chxn is bbq'd or something..but idk, the one from here was fried (I'm guessing) which I found interesting, and it was covered with gooey overpowering Teri sauce, which was extra sweet and salty  

Teri beef: same as the chicken in terms of that gooey overpowering Teri sauce..the texture of the beef was good though

When we arrived, there was one party waiting for their to go orders, and one person waiting for his food to dine in, so we figured that our food shouldn't take long. I ordered my loco moco with over easy egg, and my boyfriend ordered an adobo omelette. 
We sat down at 10:10 and waited for our food. At 10:40 the loco moco finally came out (it's an egg on top of a hamburger meat on top of white rice all topped with gravy). At 10:50, my boyfriend wanted to check on his order, he said ""Can I follow up on my order, it's been 40 minutes?"", and the server says with a hint of sass, ""You're order is being made, I'm still waiting on other orders"". Finally after 10 more minutes of waiting, the server drops off (more like slams) his food on the table and says, ""sorry about that"" (sarcastically) and walks away without giving him any utensils to eat with. 
He eats two bites because he lost his appetite, and I go grab a to go box. What i see is a bunch of people waiting for their to go orders, tables of people with no food on the table, a long line of people waiting to order, and all the servers turned their back on them talking to the cooks looking flustered. 
Aloha Kitchen, I understand being backed up in the kitchen, may I suggest some sort of appetizer (chips and dip) while customers wait, or more sympathetic servers.

My wife is in school at UNLV, and she has exactly one hour for lunch. I picked her up and took her to Aloha Kitchen. We were in line by 12:10, waiting to place our order. Plenny time for a great island lunch, yeah?

No.

It took the counter guy 10 minutes to take care of the one person in front of me. Half of that time he was standing with his back to the register, waiting. Finally took our order at 12:20. Still plenny time, yeah?

We waited. And waited. And waited. I got up and asked whether they'd forgotten us. The counter guy assured me our food was ""next."" Waited some more. A very polite busboy asked how long we'd been waiting. We told him almost half an hour. He checked, and told us our food was ""next.""

At 12:45 I got up again. My order number was 58, and I saw that people with 60 and 66 had received their food. I told the counter guy we needed to take our food to go, because we were out of time. He got pretty snippy with me, telling me I was ""next.""

""You've been saying that for half an hour.""

""Whatever.""

Finally got our food at about 12:55. To go. Dry katsu, no sauce. Mac salad instead of the kimchi we ordered. Everything separate, so there was no rice in with the curry or kalua--it was in with the bone-dry katsu. My wife tried to eat some of it on her way back to school, but burned her tongue on it because it was so hot.

The food was pretty good. I ate the katsu while fantasizing about having sauce. The mac salad was good, even though it wasn't what I ordered. If I had a two-hour lunch hour, I might consider coming here again. But only if they get new help.

1230045,2015-03-10,2,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Aloha Kitchen is a hole in the wall restaurant offering Hawaiian Filipino comfort food. Food is greasy and filling (isn't comfort food usually that?). This location is located in a strip mall with the university theater (doesn't look like they are currently in business) and a vape store. But don't let the run down area discourage you because the food here is wonderfully tasty and quite cheap. 

Anyways, my husband and I stopped by here this past Saturday evening around 8:25 pm and made a to go order. This place was nearly empty with the exception of 2 small tables. While we waited for our order to be made, we saw a handful of people come in to pick u their to go orders. We only waited maybe 15 minutes. This is what we ordered:

Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combination Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- The katsu served is chicken. This combination meal comes with 2 large pieces of Mahi Mahi (white fish) and many tender pieces of chicken katsu. Also included is 2 scoops of white rice and a small side of macaroni salad, which was good and creamy. I didn't like Mahi Mahi that much because it was bland. It was coated in egg and fried. I think there should be added seasoning to this (but the tartar sauce, on the side, that comes with the fish helped). With the generous portions, this meal was made into two. 

Mix Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- This combination plate comes with Mahi Mahi, teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken (2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad too). My husband was not a fan of the fish as well and agreed that it was rather bland. Both the chicken and beef were good but it would have been nice to have the chicken or the beef cooked differently (maybe swap out the teriyaki chicken for chicken katsu or something) to really give more variety to this meal. My husband (I had a few bites) ate this whole meal and felt pretty full afterwards. Just like the portions of my meal, this was pretty large as well (which could have made for 2 meals too). 
---------------------------
(Total= $17.27, includes tax)


After we placed our order at the register, immediately the cook in the back got to work with our food (love that it was made to order and not just waiting around, ready to scoop into a styrofoam to go box). They also have sriracha available if you want some with your to go order (just have to ask for hot sauce, which is the famous brand, Huy Fong, in case you wanted to know.. not that it matters to me because I don't like spicy foods). 

Wait time for our food wasn't too long and food was pretty good. It was pretty cheap and filling. We will definitely make sure to stop here again the next time we visit Las Vegas. 

By the way, there is free (unprotected) WiFi and they do not take anything larger than a $20 bill (they also take credit card if you didn't bring cash).",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,3,3,4,YHZUBPtC8PPgtvuuoDmg2g

I will say for all the flavor, I wish they put a bit more rice, and probably added a small side of salad or something to add some color but also alkaline/veggies to make it feel a bit healthier and more balanced.

I also wished the banana pancakes had like ice cream or some whipped cream, but it was still very delicious on its own.

Price-wise, it was decent. I forgot the exact prices but the pancakes were another $6, the combo was about $8 or $9, and the chicken bowl was about $6, so a little over $20 total. Not a bad deal.

I don't think this is the best hawaiian place ever, being that i've gone to Hawaii, but this is the best Hawaiian place in Las Vegas, at least it's my favorite. There are others, but not like Aloha Kitchen, in Vegas.

I do like to support your local Filipino's and they're here to help them. 

*Adobo Fried Rice over Egg - This place is famous for this item. If you eat this by yourself, you're probably a food eating champ, a teenager, or haven't eaten in a while. Very duable, but very heavy. It is a lot of rice. I recommend eating with a friend. 

PRO-TIP: If you get the adobo fried rice, it is likely all the other dishes will have rice as well. Try to get a la carte items you want or you'll have tons of rice left over. I've made this mistake many times. 

**Portuguese Sausage, eggs, and rice - Least to say, I love this dish, but they need to put more sausage on this plate for my big body. The rice to sausage ratio is overwhelming on this plate. They need to reconsider the amount of rice for the loaf of sausage they give. I personally want more sausage, but I can't complain. 

***Spam Musubi - The classic side dish, works everytime. I always think they over do the rice in every place that makes musubi. It must be a thing, but I could just use half the amount they put in musubi's. That will probably not change.  

There really is so much here to order and I love everything on the menu. I have a hard time looking and up and seeing if I want that today.

The kalbi. WOW. So tender with each bite and full of flavor. They offer plenty of it which was to my surprise. For the teriyaki chicken, it doesn't get any better. It's juicy and has a nice crisp to the skin. They only thing I would do different is ask them to make the chicken teriyaki crispier. For my plate, I opted for no Katsu and double the chicken teriyaki. 

I'll be back to try some of the Filipino food. They have 5 locations in the Las Vegas area. So I recommend trying one most convenient to you. The prices and reasonable and the portions are big.",8DmF1fOW_vBhOF8mu6XU5w,0,0,4,SjH_68x7SryzSJgzFS7MtQ

2164843,2011-03-31,1,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"All my friends who have been here make it a point to make a stop here at least once while they're in Vegas. We came here on our way back home from Vegas. I kept hearing all these great things about their adobo fried rice omelet which sounded so intriguing! I like adobo, and I like omelets so that sounded like a win-win already. It's a pretty decent sized restaurant with another room in the back with more seats. Our group of 12 was able to push together seats and tables so we can all sit together. We ordered separately and they give you a number placard to put on your table. So we all ordered one by one and sat waiting at our table. 

Service: Pretty disappointing. The food started coming out at the same time, some dishes took longer than others but for the most part people who ordered the same item got theirs at the same time. Then it started to slow down and about 6 people had their food already but only 2 people were given forks. We had to constantly remind our server to bring out forks, etc. to us. After 10 more minutes almost all of us got our food except for one person... when everyone else who ordered the same exact dish already had theirs and was halfway through eating it by then. No joke, it took another 10-15 minutes for his dish to finally come out. I asked our server, Ana if they had forgotten about his dish to which she replied no. mm hmm, because it always takes about 30 minutes to make one more tapsilog right? We got the food with no explanation or even acknowledgment that it was late. After that whenever I needed something I went right up to the counter so I didn't have to wait. I would understand if the restaurant was packed, but at the time we were there it wasn't. 

Food: This is at least the good part. The food was good here. We ordered the adobo omelet which was excellent on both aspects. I like to think of it as adobo fried rice with a better presentation of the egg portion. Like I said, you can't go wrong with adobo & an omelet. I also ordered the Loco Moco, which was also good. I thought it was very similar to L&L's Loco Moco, but then again since I waited for everyone to get their food it was cold by the time I ate it- still good anyway. 


Since I base my ratings on my overall experience at a restaurant (service, food, & ambiance), I had to knock off stars for the service portion.  Hey, what can I say, service can make or break your experience am I right?  At least the food was good enough for me to come back again next time I'm in Vegas.

When I stepped into the restaurant there was one person ahead of me standing in line. As she left I stepped up to the counter and saw a display model of what a plate of food from here looks like. I got excited even thou I noticed the scoop of Mac salad was on a skimpy side. Oh well, I stepped up , ordered my usual fave at a hawaiian place ,chicken katsu plate. Since I noticed the skimpy display of Mac salad I decided to order a extra scoop of Mac salad, because for me the Mac salad is CRUCIAL to enjoying this dish ( I can get fried chicken and rice pretty much anywhere). $2 extra for a extra scoop! Oh well I love the stuff.
As I am sitting waiting for my to go food to get ready, I observe the predicament one of the cashiers is in. They forgot to give the lady that was in front of me the right order. They hurry and call her to ask her to come back so they can give her the right items. About 10 min later she comes back and hands over the ""incorrect food."" The cashier (with no gloves or anything) opens up all her food boxes and looks at them, then opens up the one they said she is suppose to have. We have 4 workers looking at the open boxes arguing with each other ( all while my food already ready sitting behind the counter getting cold). They finally agree and close the boxes and hand the lady back the SAME items they told her to bring back and said "" oh, never mind we didn't mess up."", And just hand her back her bag. No apology for having to turn around and drive back to a restaurant for a mistake of a mistake. I'm sitting down watching this just thinking "" man, that gotta suck."" As she leaves the cashier calls out my order and hands me my food. I ask for a side of gravy which which she charges me 25 cents for. I pay and get in my car eager to enjoy my food. I get home and open everything up...... And there's only one small scoop of Mac salad :(.
 Now this would not be a big deal, but  the Mac salad is the highlight of a Hawaiian dish for me. Plus since it seems like they have a habit of messing up orders, I will not be returning. The food was good but not so amazing that the service shortcomings can be ignored.  I will not rerun to Aloha, instead I will continue to got to L and L, where my order is always spot on, my Mac salad is plentiful and my gravy is free.",Hhh8BJslNhXWGrHxYoknFg,1,0,2,lNA69GjpCZriX-5_D5s1RA

This location has gone through a few renovations.  They completely got rid of the Hawaiian decor and updated the restaurant to look more modern.  The colors are a bit too dark for my taste, but it looks nice.  

I usually order the Adobo Omelette.  This is big enough to feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I've never been able to finish it on my own.  Also, they've expanded their menu.

There is something on the menu to satisfy whatever you may be craving.  If you don't want to stray too far from the beaten path then the Mix plate is a good option. Teriyaki chicken and beef, plus some Mahi. All of the plates come with rice and mac salad, which you should try if you have never had it at a Hawaiian spot. Here is a rundown of all the other goodies I have tried there.

Chicken Katsu - On par with the other Hawaiian places I have tried. Usually fairly crispy and not too fatty. The Katsu is offered in a number of different combo plates.

Kalua Pig - One of my favorite things on the menu. The meat is not very fatty at all, I am not a fan of really fatty meat. The pork is served on a bed of shredded cabbage which gives everything a nice crunch.

Chicken Curry - My favorite thing on the menu. This is a brown curry, a little more like Japanese curry than Thai. It comes in a soup container and is full of chicken and veggies. Pour it over the two scoops of rice and it makes the perfect cold weather meal.

Mahi Sandwich - Good for a light meal, I like that the fish is not fried. Served with fries and only a little over $5.

Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - A ton of fried rice inside a cocoon of egg. If you like omelettes and fried rice this will be a revelation. 

Kalbi Ribs - Plenty of meat on the ribs and the sauce is what you would expect, with just the right amount of sweetness.

Lumpia Shanghai - Little eggrolls stuffed full of pork and deep fried. If you have ever had them before you know how addicting they are.

Loco Moco - Eggs and gravy served over a hamburger patty and rice. The quintessential hangover meal. It's warm, filling, and just the right amount of greasy.

Word to the wise, make sure you pick up a menu to see what is in all of the combo plates. The menu on the wall over the register doesn't explain what is in the combo plates. They offer a lot of combos and most of the above items are included in at least some of the combinations.",sRLwrUelf8jWg1my5CntXw,1,1,5,4cMt1wBcmLmYNlaI5A0cOg

However, after convincing friends to join me for breakfast here, we ended up feeling disappointed with the lackluster food. First of all, it was disappointing that they were out of pancakes. While we were looking forward to trying the macadamia nut pancakes, alas -- it was a goal unaccomplished. 

The adobo fried rice omelette was a letdown for me. It was a huge portion that I would suggest sharing with a buddy. My friend and I each got one and we were both only able to finish half. The fried rice was lacking in flavor. I was tempted to put a lot of Sriracha in it. I had one little chunk of adobo and small shreds but the protein was fairly absent in the dish. 

The Portuguese sausages were large slices and were pretty good. I also liked how the spam musubi had a good rice to musubi ratio. I detest rice being heavily packed into my musubi, so I was really glad that Aloha Kitchen did not do that. They also had a nice selection of the Aloha Sun drinks. 

I think I'd enjoy this place more if I was really hungry or recovering from a night out from heavy drinking. The experience was not up to par with what we desired.

Maybe they were having a rough day, but the female employees made me feel very unwelcome and one seemed irritated as she was taking my order. I told her it would take a minute or two to figure out what I want, but she just nodded and proceeded to stare at me while I browsed the menu :-(

I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and requested an egg-white omelette at no extra charge. I sat down at a table and waited about 30 minutes until I finally got my order. I don't understand why it took so long! The place was not busy at all. I was even more disappointed with my order...it wasn't even an omelette. It was literally just an egg white, on top of the rice. The fried rice was just okay and lacking in flavor; I had to add some sriracha and soy sauce to it.

The sauce is kind of bland and I've found the chicken to be fatty.  But, hey, what do you expect for $3?

This place, can't be compared to L&L, though, but they had more distinctive items on their menu than the latter. I suggest to order the mix plate, which is very tasty if you love both meat and fish.

The only bad thing about here is that their water comes from the pitcher, not the soda dispensing machine, which hints they're getting it from the sink, and their glasses are all stacked up in one corner. You have to put yourself your own water, and once it runs out, the busboy took like 10 minutes to refill it.

I remember going to an Aloha Kitchen on Maryland Pkwy right where this one is, and then I remember eating crappy Hawaiian food that I thought we could easily make better and cheaper at home, and then getting violently sick from food poisoning. But after overcoming my previous fears, and starting off slow with 1 spam musubi to go and then building up to their combo plates with no violent aftermath, I've come to the conclusion that it is now safe to eat at this place. 

The food here is decent, not bad pricing for some things, and they get it right for the most part. Their mac salad is a little lacking in the taste department, but after being addicted to Fukuburger's mac salad nothing comes even close anymore. The kalbi ribs are quite tasty, and at a decent price at $7.99 for a plate. The spam musubi is okay, cheap and quite big for $1.99, but they put a weird sauce on it that is kind of like a watery teriyaki sauce that I could definitely do without, and I think they need to roast their seaweed wrapper a tiny bit more. 

Overall, it's decent food for the price, but I am looking forward to trying their breakfast specials and see if they measure up to the breakfasts we make at home. Also, I did not get food poisoning here so that is definitely a plus.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,1,0,3,NTHnnORXpYRXjDczfdNdZQ

I got the Kalbi combo, which is only, like, the best combo ever (L&L listen up!  You MUST make a combo like this), duh!  It comes with kalbi (a tiny piece :/), chicken teriyummy!

As soon as my plane touched down we were on our way to carb up with some good food at Aloha Kitchen! I've been here only one time prior to this trip, but that was back in 2007 and I wanted to make sure this place was still good! There menu offered plenty of standard Hawaiian food style things like loco mocos and spam musubis, but people come here for the adobo fried rice! When my plate finally arrived the smell was intoxicating and my mouth was instantly watering. The fried rice did not disappoint this hungry stomach! There was a lot of flavors, albeit a bit salty, but it wasn't too bad. If you've ever had adobo on its own with rice and loved it the adobo fried rice will make you happy.

I ordered the teriyaki combo, which was probably a bad idea because the teriyaki sauce was WAY too thick and sweet for me. The plate, itself, was decently sized, but their meat section of the plate wasn't all that impressive. It came with chicken, beef, and pork with rice and macaroni salad. Half my plate was rice, a small scoop of macaroni, 1 palm sized chicken, 1 palm sized beef, and pieces of pork. Due to the overpowering sweetness of the teriyaki, I got kinda sick from it. Their portion of rice to meats wasn't balanced. Their sauce, not good for me.

My friends and I ordered the same thing-teriyaki combo, while everyone else got the loco moco. Again, the loco moco had  too much rice compared to the meat and egg. Maybe their adobo fried rice omlette is better. That's what I've seen from friend's posts. Shoulda gotten that maybe.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Aloha. I'd much rather go to L&L. I left unsatisfied, but full. I guess it got the job done. I wasn't hungry the whole 14 hour drive back home....Next time, I might try the adobo rice. *shrugs but I don't know.",XkYxCZaSpVdn7rhBmkUAnA,2,0,3,RCNpjxlad2S8OHA7n9pHFQ

I find it weird that there are two areas to dine in yet everyone's seated in view of the counter. I wonder if people just aren't allowed to sit in the bigger room?

Anyway, my favorite is the kalbi plate. The sour kimchee obviously came from a jar (I forgot what the brand is) but I still enjoy it very much. I had the local plate before and I only liked the spam musubi. I also like their adobo omelette...sometimes. It can either be tasty or too dry and bland. 50/50. It's probably a good idea to ask for extra adobo sauce to guarantee flavor. 

I gave up on trying any other items on the menu because they never seem to have anything. No oxtail soup, no laulau, no bbq pork.. dang it! So I just go for the Kalbi plate or an adobo omelette if I feel like enjoying leftovers.",7lXJ1xfcuVNk-i1B48oGvA,0,0,4,ElCXBm5EHT-TrtXdRCY2qQ
3107590,2013-12-21,1,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Back when I lived on the east coast, I was never really aware of how popular hawaiian food was. When I moved to the west coast, it was like discovering a new world. I had never heard of dishes like Loco Moco or Saimin, although I had heard of Spam Musubi. So when I first started visiting Vegas with my bf, he introduced me to this place. 

If you read my previous reviews, I get really excited about hold in the wall restaurants because they tend to have the best of the best. This is a really small restaurant located near the university so I figured it would be popular with students. They even have student lunch specials! It's one of those restaurants where you order at the register and you seat yourself. 

My bf really wanted the Loco Moco and recommended I try the Adobo Fried Rice. What he described to me was something I couldn't fathom--until I saw it with my own eyes. Chicken Adobo fried rice encased in an egg omelet?? Yes, please!!! Although our entree portions weren't as large as other places, I wasn't complaining. It was enough. 

I had high hopes for our food based on looks alone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed about the taste. I had to add loads of sriracha sauce to complement both dishes. 

Although it wasn't the worst experience I've had, I've found other hawaiian restaurants I'd rather visit since. If you haven't experienced Hawaiian food, you could try this place. But to be honest, I'd drive further to eat somewhere else.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,1,1,3,fM0ePXOSI-bUDh9wvgVYCQ

I first saw this establishment in the 1990s, shortly after enrolling in some post-Graduate courses at nearby UNLV, and decided to give them a try.

My favorite dish is Kalua Pig, and I must say that it tasted every bit as good here, as it did in the islands.  It turns out that this is a family-owned company, and the folks there are from Hawaii also, so they KNOW how Hawaiian dishes are supposed to taste.

If you've never enjoyed the flavor of the islands, you're in for a very special treat, and I heartily urge you to stop by sometime, to give their many menu items a true sampling.

Aloha Kitchen has a student special for under $8, which includes a Chicken Teriyaki bowl and rice. There is a good amount of meat, and the portion size is more than sufficient for lunch. 
Customers order at the counter and can receive their food there, or they can order and get the food brought to them. The place is a little dirty, and the staff mess up the orders sometimes, but they do try their best in getting the orders out fast, which is pretty important for students who need to get back to class in time.

They also add green onions to the egg, which I think is awesome! I like to put Siracha on top to give it some spicy hotness.

I finally tried this spot. Dude, I'm Filipino and it's 2016 - where have I been, right? Well, obviously not here, until earlier this month.

Service was friendly and although there was a line that had us standing inside right by the door, it moved quickly.

I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette (big surprise) and a half order of longanisa, put me out $12.37 but that's not bad at all! The omelette was HUUUGE and delicious. I was debating if I should order another for the road, but I knew I would be back in less than 2 weeks so decided against it. Of course the next day back at home I regretted it! Anyway, the longanisa - it isn't your traditional Filipino style longanisa, sad face. I knew it right when it was delivered to our table. I thought maybe it would be similar to a Portuguese sausage but it leaned more towards a hot dog, a sweet hot dog, if that makes any sense. It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I was expecting.

The venue itself is located in a plaza close to UNLV and across the street from, helllooooo, Starbucks, which has a freakin' drive through - WINNING!! YELP came through!! My peeps and I were able to roll through that Starbucks right before hitting up Aloha Kitchen and happily fulfilled our caffeine requirement for the day! Parking was easy and the venue was clean. Not a huge location but ample seating for good customer flow. Speaking of which, it looks like Aloha Kitchen agrees with local law enforcement as we saw several uniforms occupying a few tables.

Aloha Kitchen is probably a good cure to a hangover or if you're just straight hangry, or not. Come full and you will still probably stuff your face. Just make sure you do so before 10pm as this location closes earlier than the other location.

Garlic chicken is always a must order for me whenever I go to a Hawaiian restaurant. The biggest and most obvious difference between the garlic chicken here and other places is that chicken is grilled here.

 At most places, chicken is marinated in garlic sauce then deep fried. When my order arrived to the table, I could smell the garlic but when I took a bite, the garlic flavor was barely there. It just tasted like a garlic chicken that was marinated in soy sauce. It was good regardless. Gravy was also good, albeit too salty for my liking.

I will say, I have not been back since May. That particular time, it was a Sunday afternoon having lunch with a friend. It was understaffed. My cashier was also my server, which was strange.

I ordered Pork Lau Lau which is pork wrapped in leaves. I only got it because I liked the name. The server helped serve me and unwrapped the food. I ate it and did not enjoy it much. It was worse that night when I got some of the worst food poisoning of my life. 

Either the pork wasn't cooked all the way or the server hadn't washed his hands after handling all that money and it contaminated the food. That was just my last experience. Every other time was an okay experience.

My wife got the longanisa, which was on the sweet side, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. If it's any indication of how good their Portuguese sausage is, I'll definitely be back.

Spam Masubi and Lumpia Shanghai, the reason for 3stars is b/c as much $#!t as I complain about the SPAM to RICE ratio of the masubi I still order 2 of them when I'm there.  The SPAM/RICE ratio is like 11/89 (11%spam/89%rice) where is THE SPAM.  I don't know how to make masubi so this is why I buy it, aloha is right up the street form the house therefore it's where I go.  No, this is not Hawaii, I know I know, but my Californian a$$ ate so much masubi in Hawaii it became my favorite fast food/quick meal.  To the point I was getting them from 7-11, but once again this is not Hawaii, this is LAS VEGAS is the SPAM/RICE ratio (to me personal) are very very unbalanced.

The lumpia is DA BOMB! and the teriyaki sauce OOOOOOoooooo, it is worth the $0.71, don't frown your face at the price.  You are not getting a little dipping cup of sauce, it's like a pudding cup of sauce.  I took the sauce, glazed some salmon that I had sitting in the fridge and tossed in the oven for 22mins, impromptu dinner, no seasoning needed.

My only complaint is that the diversity of veggies in the stir fry is very limited to cabbage, carrots, and maybe some peppers. I love the way AK makes their rice, and had no complaints. The portion size was also massive. As for the egg rolls, they just didn't do it for me. They were cooked okay, but were pretty bland, and the sauce with them didn't really help.

Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. 

The adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed. Nothing remarkable, but enjoyable.

Aloha Kitchen offers affordable and delicious meals and it's a terrific way to get out of the casinos for an hour or two. The adobo fried rice omelette alone is worth a visit.

4521764,2013-04-15,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,Ok first and last time here.  Tried the adobo fried rice omelette the rice is bland! I also had a custom order made which was incorrect. I told the cashier I cannot have pork in it. Asked if they can substitute the adobo for chicken katsu. He asked the cook and the cook says no that the rice already has the adobo mixture. I'm like ok can you do just chicken katsu and egg omelette? (Since no attempt on fresh rice will be made) the cook's expression was like it was a burden. Really? What's hard of cooking made to order eggs and put cooked chicken in it. Well when I finally get to my destination and hubby went to open his food why was their rice with pork in it?

I got the Loco Moco which sounds amazing in theory but was a little bit much after I ordered it: it's essentially burger meat topped with gravy, an egg, and rice. My friends had the Adobo, which is one of the more popular dishes, which is an omelet filled with rice. That would have been my recommendation if you're a fan of either things. The Katsu was not too great either. Yes, I tried everyone's food.

The kids working there are young and nice, offering pretty good service with a smile. I came back a few days later for quick to-go order of macaroni salad and spam musubi and it took twenty minutes.

4640472,2011-05-08,1,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Okay so up til today, I'd have to say I liked this place...sometimes over Ross J's Aloha Grill...There. .. I said it.  The reason? Well I really do love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki bowl at Ross J's...its only $3.50 plus they give you extra sauce if you ask...free of charge...   I alternate between this and the Aloha Kitchen's Chicken Teriyaki bowl for several of the following reasons:

1)The sauce at Ross J's is a bit on the salty side...AK has sweeter sauce.
2) I get really good service at AK and when i study at UNLV=convenience 
3) The portions have been more than adequate..(The chicken rice bowl as well as the Local plate)

Why they now down to 2 star rather than 4.5 star in my book ? ..

    Local plate no longer comes with RICE! WTH? They were really nice and just offered the rice after I made it a point to pay for a side portion of the rice so that was cool of them.  But i was quite taken back by their explanation of why this place no longer adds the rice in this $7.59 combination plate ( The menu says that all combos are served with rice and mac salad) ""We don't add the rice anymore because we put rice in the musubi!"" Okay..first of all...if you are going to offer spam musubi..it comes with rice on its own...it isn't good business to try to skim customers out of clearly what was printed on all the menus.  You don't advertise a plate with spam masubi and give customers the spam and tell them to pay extra for the rice do you? Vice versa...you shouldn't sell something with spam musubi and say that the rice is now counted as part of a dish and the portion of the rice that has always been included with it is no longer included! The employee was nice and told me that she has told management to change it on the menu...Problem is the rationale for excluding the rice now is irrational. 

I have always been happy with paying the extra 50 cents for extra sauce (although Ross J's never charged) because i liked it so much and i wanted to support the business.  But after today, i feel disappointed with this place...

Lastly, I ordered Mixed vegetables for a friend...opened the container and was really disappointed by their version of the mixed vegetables.  There was only cabbage and a few strands of onion...($1.99 for mixed veggies).  I think if you were going to charge this price..at least add a few for types of veggies..broccoli, bean sprouts ...carrots..something..not just plain cabbage that costs pennies on the dollar..
If you are in the area, like this sort of Hawaiian food ...the portion is okay...decent flavor & its still way better than L&L.  Unfortunately I don't like how this place does business.   Ross J's=You are still my #1 favorite..

Adobo fried rice omelet. Mmm.. just like home. Homemade adobo (pork) cooked in garlic fried rice wrapped in an omelet! How can you not resist that! The adobo is perfect, tangy, soft and peppery. You can share this omelet however it is best to buy one for yourself and eat the rest for leftovers.  I like to dip my rice in hot sauce it gives a better kick!

Things I have also tried: Spam plate- nothing to fancy straight forward, you can ask them to cook is crispy or soft. Corn beef hash- mmm.. I love corn beef hash. They make it crispy on the outside and soft in the side. Eat it with rice, over easy eggs and ketchup! Adobo Katsu- Adobo with chicken katsu, rice and macaroni salad!

""Uncle"" as it was displayed on his name tag took our order and was courteous.  Although this is a Hawaiian restaurant, they have Filipino food as well as you can hear some of the workers speaking Tagalog.

PROs: the adobo omelette is a must have when in Vegas and is just a short drive of a couple miles off the strip. ""Silog"" breakfast items are available to choose from - tapsilog, longsilog, cornbeefsilog.  Dishes are not too salty and the tapsilog was flavorful.  Tapsilog came with a little of garlic vinegar and ketchup.

CONs: the side booths were a little snug for space.  Was looking for more adobo flavors in the adobo omelette just like I remembered the first time I was here.  Tapsilog was flavorful but small in quantity. Also, would have preferred garlic rice with our ""silog"" plates.

My friend got the locomoco and I tried it and thought it was really good as well, not too salty.

The Kahlua Katsu combo consisted of two sides of rice, the juiciest most flavorful kahlua pig and a huge cutlet of chicken katsu, the sauce was right on point. My Kalbi combo had a side of rice, OMG yummy macaroni salad! It had tiny pieces of celery and I absolutely hate celery but I couldn't even tasted it and I was in love.

My wife got the Adobe Fried Rice Omelet with Chicken, and I got the Banana Pancakes.  The omelet was pretty good; decent flavor, nice size, and chicken in every bite.  It could use a little more soy sauce in it, but other than that it was a hit.

The banana pancakes, on the other hand, were terrible.  They were seriously overcooked;  they were almost black on both sides and tasted burned.  And banana?  Not in these babies.  If there was banana in these, you couldn't taste it.  And the Mac nut sauce was flat; it needed sweetness of some kind, as well as vanilla for depth.  These pancakes need to come off the menu until they can do them right.  These are quite possibly the worst pancakes I've ever had.

It's like a filipino torta/burrito, he he he.  The omelet is large and in charge and can be a pretty hefty meal; but I finished the last one all by myself.

Very nice employees.  Our orders were taken and I kid you not, by the time I filled up my cup with something to drink and looking for a place to sit, the server was already looking for where we were sitting to give us our food.  That was fast.  They probably were starting on a few Adobo Fried RiceOmelettes while we were busying ordering and paying.

My gf and I got the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, Chicken Katsu and Miso soup.

The Adobo Omelette looks good.  The flavor of the Adobo is there, but it's just way too much.  For one thing, as much of a Filipino I am, I'm not a big Adobo fan.  I ate a little under half and just boxed up the rest.  Ended up chucking it.

For the Chicken Katsu, could use a little more flavor.  Although, they do give you a lot of chicken so that's always good.  It just didn't hit the spot that I was expecting to get when I saw it on the menu.  The sauce it comes with is very dense as well.

My gf also got their Miso soup.  We were expecting a small bowl just to get some warmth in your system after a weekend of partying.  I was wondering why it was pretty pricey on the menu.  It's because they give you this pho-sized bowl of miso soup.  They told us they ran out of tofu.  So in essence, this was literally just broth.

After a successful Vegas trip for my friends birthday, what more to end the trip with a good place to eat before a long drive back to San Diego. The whole trip, there was a huge hype for Aloha kitchen being the Bomb.com and all that... I was amazed how my first and last  experience was the worst service I EVER had at any place I have eaten at (literally). 

My friends and I get there, and it did not seems busy at all. Just about a 1/3 of the restaurant was full. We were impressed with the menu items and we were excited to place our order. We sit down... wait... wait... wait.... and wait... then waited some more... 30 mins pass. With no acknowledgement of the staff that we have been waiting for so long and still no food. Then we see the another group of people who already ordered and sat down, get up and complained about the wait. Then they were told that their food has not even started cooking... I felt bad for them, as I am sure that they were waiting over an hour and nothing. Then the started to ask for a refund... then finally their food came out..

I was thinking, if their food is starting to come out... then our food should come out soon after a 45 mins of waiting. One of my friends went to go check on our food, and one of the ladies, stated that they just started cooking it. WTF really? 10-15 mins later.. our food started to come out and they were serving us the food that we did not even order. We tried to nice about it but the service was horrible. After straightening about ordered what.. Then find out that one of my friends and MY order has not even started cooking... WOW WTF!!!?!?!?!!??!! we waited... over an hour and nothing... WOW pathetic... I then complained to what is going on... why is everything taking so long and they made the excuse that there was no cooks or the cook who was suppose to be an hour earlier when we ordered, just came in.. 

Thank you for the courtesy of letting us know ahead of time so we could have at least thought about eating here... Thank you for not compensating anything for the time we have wasted waiting for our food and to find out that it was not even put in to be cooked. I simply asked if they can compensate us for a simple drink for the long wait.. and we got denied like it was our fault. ARE YOU FREAKEN KIDDING ME!?!? Asked for a refund, and it was a hassle for even getting my money back.

Finally... there was some acknowledge from the staff that there was something actually going on... that they were backed up yadda yadda... that would have been greatly appreciated hmmmm.... an hour ago when we first placed our order.

Honestly, I am not a negative person. I am really patient and I can understand that we are human and we all make mistakes, but I was not going to put up for any BS as that is all I got at ALOHA KITCHEN. 

NEVER AGAIN GOING TO THIS PLACE AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE.  

TIP FOR MANAGEMENT: CONSIDER NEW STAFF

When I walked through the door, I immediately smelled the teriyaki grill; It instantly made me more hungry. There was soft Hawaiian/Island music playing that really captured a smooth, friendly, no worries type of theme. There was not an overwhelming amount of Hawaiian décor, just enough to fit the ambiance and keep a modest, family owned touch to the place. 
 As I approached the register I was greeted with a ""What can I get started for you?"" I replied by ordering the Kalbi Ribs displayed on the menu board above and behind the register. The cashier took my credit card, gave me a receipt and a number holder for my table then said ""Sit anywhere you'd like, your meal should be out in about 10 minutes."" As promised, about 10 minutes after sitting my meal was brought out to me. The food was absolutely to die for. The ribs where cooked with just the right amount of tenderness, and had an amazing amount of flavor. This meal was definitely worth the wait.
 In all, the restaurant does a fantastic job providing a calm, relaxing feeling throughout the entire experience. The cashier could have done a better job greeting me with a ""hello"", or a ""how is your day going"" before getting straight to ""What can I get started for you?"" However, too much conversation could be a bit annoying so she did a great job keeping it quick and to the point.

5042179,2013-08-17,1,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"During my niece's basketball tournament, we decided to drive to Aloha Kitchen around the corner from UNLV to enjoy a quick lunch.  I was stoked, because this is one of my favorite Hawaiian food places in the valley.  

The location is definitely located in a sketchy area.  Next to In-N-Out on Maryland and Tropicana, I feel like they were trying to target the students at UNLV.  I feel bad for someone walking to location at night.  Definitely a dangerous looking area.  The reason for my low score is the staff.  There's a little Filipino looking girl with a name starting with a V (I think Veronica) that works there.  First off, when there are a lot of people in line, she definitely seems to crack under pressure.  No smile, no small talk, sighing at requests all the time and giving attitude.  I was not a fan at all.  I was even going to go as far as to send a message to the owner of the restaurant, informing them of this rude behavior.  I was with a group of 20.  I understand that amount can get super overwhelming, however, she is definitely in the industry to create the best experience for every customer.  At one point, I asked her for more water as the pitchers on the side were empty.  She looked at me, rolled her eyes, sighed a little and took the pitcher from my hands.  LIVID I was!

Now that I'm done ranting, here's what I got:

For lunch, I got the Aloha plate for $7.99 and (2) spam musubis for $1.99 each.  The musubi was super good!  Different textures like the sticky rice, fried and salty spam and the crunchy seaweed that held everything together!  Although I ordered the Aloha plate, when I got back to the gym, I discovered that I actually got the adobo plate!  I was so pissed because that's not what I wanted!!!  In the adobo plate, though, it comes with a bunch of pork chunks cooked in vinegar and soy sauce, with two scoops of rice.  What made me more mad was the fact that the adobo to me was dry.  It came in a to-go bowl with lots of the soup it was cooked in, however, the meat was still dryer than I'm used to.  Not happy at all.  

I love me some Aloha Kitchen, however, I was not a fan of this place at all.  I know they usually do a great job at the other locations so I'm not going to refrain from coming back just because of this experience.  This location, however, needs to get it together and step up the service!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,0,2,82nIZvTofdbS4fGOEY1jnw
5043251,2014-01-09,1,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"I must admit Hawaiian food is a great way to end a shenanigan-filled weekend in Vegas. Hearty and full of carbs and protein, it pretty much could be a soupless alternative to pho as a hangover helper.

I ordered the Pork Lau Lau since I've been craving it for the longest time. It comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The pork came out tender and the taro leaves were nice and soft. Not bad for Vegas.

It's in a random strip mall next to UNLV, prices are pretty affordable for what you get. People keep mentioning the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette? Guess I'll have to try that next time I'm in Vegas. And knowing me, I'll be back sooner than later...

Local Plate:

Rice only comes with the plate upon request? Really? The reason I was given was ""because a lot of people don't eat it."" I've never come across that anywhere else. 

Also, the macaroni salad comes in a 4oz sauce container. Come on.

The chicken and beef were pretty good, however. It's a shame you don't get much more than that, and it's definitely not worth the $8 it comes out to.

Chicken Adobo Omelette:

The portion for this item was actually a good size, enough for two, so I was happy in that regard.

The combination itself was decent. The fried rice and egg were good, but the adobo itself was on the dry side.

If only I had known about the adobo sauce, which I did not know was, again, available upon request only.


The food was alright, the portions are hit and miss, but the general tomfoolery of my experience gives me a reason to never come back.",sznc01vaWdlEytHGiA51AA,1,1,2,Nc3IjPUumHneg4WZAao0yg
5576527,2018-05-11,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"I visited Aloha Kitchen on my lunch break 2 days ago (05/09).  I called ahead of time, placed an order over the phone for to-go and was told it would take 15-20 minutes.  Pretty decent timing for a lunch hour.  I showed up in about 10 minutes and decided to wait in-store since it was fairly hot that day, and it came out 5 min later.  Again, timing was good.  The restaurant is clean, there are a bunch of friendly faces on the staff (they didn't look like they hated their job), and there is a water tray sitting in the corner for you to grab your own at if you don't want to indulge on sugary drinks.  

Food: I ordered the mix plate, which online says it is a combination of chicken teriyaki, beef, and mahi-mahi.  When I opened up the box of food at work, it was chicken teriyaki, mahi-mahi, and PORK.  Not sure where the communication went wrong over the phone but I read exactly what was listed on YOUR menu.  If it has changed since what your website says then you should update it for your customers who don't have time to sit in restaurants for lunch so they order what they want.  I don't eat pork, so that got wasted but everything else was pretty good.  Also, I saw many reviews talking about how delicious the macaroni salad is so I was excited for that.  Not so excited when I ate it though.  It tasted like rotten mayonnaise.  I definitely couldn't finish that. I am unsure where the reviewers got the idea that it was delicious at but it literally tasted how a dirty garbage disposal smells.  It was awful.  

Is this going to be my first choice in food next time?  No.  Would I return?  Yes maybe but would be passing on the mac salad and making sure I am ordering the right item since their online menu is inaccurate.

I have tried many dishes here and none disappoint. There are a few that especially stand out. The chicken katsu is the absolute best katsu I have ever tasted in my life. It is not some thin breaded, greasy chicken piece of crap like most places will serve you. It is a juicy chicken thigh breaded to perfection and sliced up. This is definitely my favorite dish. Also, the BBQ chicken is quite tasty. They always grill it fresh which is awesome, but it can take awhile to get to you. It takes about 20 minutes to make, but it is worth the wait. Can't forget the student special; for under 5 bucks you get a teriyaki chicken bowl and a drink. It is enough to fill you up on the cheap.

The Union was closed, none of us were in the mood for Mexican, and for obvious reasons we needed to walk to wherever it was we were going. The girl from my class said she was down for Hawaiian, so Hawaiian it was! 

Walking in, the place is a combo Filipino/Hawaiian place, with some combos of those cuisines available. The place was empty when we went (5/24/11), but it was 6 PM - I don't think normal dinner time is the same around UNLV. Our food was delivered relatively quickly. I got the Kalbi combo - Kalbi ribs, chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki with two scoops of macaroni salad. The kalbi and katsu was decent, not the best I've ever had but still good. The teriyaki was, hmm, maybe had too much cornstarch in the sauce because it had a very thick consistency, more so than usual. 

The service was friendly. The owner (?) cut in on our conversation to chat with us about what we had been talking about, so yeah, the service was friendly.

5806949,2007-06-11,0,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"There's Hawaiian food, and then there's Hawaiian food.  My introduction to such fare was in Hawaii, many years ago.  First was the inevitable luau which, although touristy, nonetheless introduced me to such foods as kalua pig, lomi lomi salmon, and taro.  Next came the ""traditional"" restaurant.  ""Traditional"" is in quotes because I'm not quite sure what tradition was being followed, but it was an attempt to offer some of the foods eaten by Hawaiians in the not too distant past, and even into the present.  I got my first taste of poi, which by the way is actually pretty good as a foil to the salty foods often served.  I then moved to a locals restaurant that served many of the same dishes, and fell in love with haupia, which when properly prepared is coconut heaven and when poorly prepared is coconut jello.  Lastly, I was introduced to the then new Pacific Rim (aka Asian fusion) cuisine.

Aloha Kitchen isn't like any of those places. 

The menu is representative of what is sometimes called local Hawaiian food, and caters to the large local Hawaiian community that has taken root in Las Vegas.  The food is an amalgam of Pacific Rim cuisines.  It is cheap and filling.  A typical meal is the mix plate, consisting of two scoops of white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and one or more items such as kalua pork, chicken katsu, and pork lau lau.  Spam is also a mainstay (spam sushi!), or try the loco moco (bed of rice, hamburger patty, eggs sunny side up, and a big ladle of brown gravy).  Health food lovers need not apply.

Like most such restaurants, Aloha Kitchen is very plain, and very inexpensive.  The Maryland Parkway location is near UNLV, and feels like a typical university hole-in-the-wall place.  Order at the counter, take a seat, and your meal will be brought to you.

Meal #1:  I had never had a loco moco before, and decided to give it a try.  Loco Moco is a bowl of steamed rice, with a fried hamburger patty on top, followed by a generous portion of brown gravy, and a couple of sunny side up eggs.  The rice was bland, the gravy was bland, the hamburger was bland.  Once is enough!

Meal #2:  I decided to try a typical meal - one of the many mix plate combinations.  In this case it consisted of kalua pork, chicken katsu, and of course rice and macaroni salad.  The kalua pork was salty but flavorful, good in combination with the bland rice.  The real winner was chicken katsu, a kind of Japanese fried chicken with a sweet barbecue sauce on top.

Meal #3:  I got the local plate: chicken, beef, Spam musubi, macaroni salad, and rice, all for the bargain price of $6.99.  The beef consisted of thin small slices of beef with a sweet barbecue sauce, on top of sprouts of some sort.  On top of the beef was a thin piece of chicken, skin on, sauted until the skin was crisp.  Both were very good.  Next, Spam musubi; I had to try it.  There were two pieces.  Each pieced consisted of a thin slice of Spam (about 3"" x 1.5"" x 1/8""), fried until crisp, on top of a thick layer of warm rice with barbecue sauce, wrapped in a large sheet of seaweed.  It wasn't as weird as I expected, although the seaweed was too chewy.  I'd give it a mild thumbs up.



This kind of food isn't fancy; it's heavy on the fat, heavy on the carbs.  I love it!  Aloha Kitchen serves a decent representation of the stuff.  I have a feeling there must be better versions out there, but this one is pretty good.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,2,4,3,zx432r9iz_vrRycgrPE5Sw

5923700,2010-08-28,2,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Overview:  Being a UNLV alumni I of course have eaten many a meal at Aloha Kitchen.  It is cheap, but I'll warn you now, for each item that is of wonderful quality and taste, there is an item that is equally bland, fake, or just plain bad.  It is a Filipino owned establishment, so the Filipino items tend to be good, while the flavors that I grew up with in Hawaii are often a disappointment.  I miss Diamond Head grill, which was across the street from UNLV.  Their Hawaii food blew Aloha Kitchen out of the water, but the owners moved away and I was left with just the Aloha.

Location:  The restaurant is on Maryland Parkway, north of Tropicana.  For all you poor college students, it's to the east of the southern dorms, south of In and out burger, and north east of the architecture building.  When you're on campus, the strip is west of you.  Hopefully that helps.

Exterior:  Your standard strip mall restaurant.  There is minimal outside décor, glass store front, and a door.

Interior:  They are really going for the Hawaii feel here, but it looks nothing like any restaurant that I have ever eaten in whileI lived all my life in Hawaii.  It screams fake Hawaii.  Corny.  

Service:  You order at the counter for takeout and dine in.  If it is a takeout order, there are a few seats that you can sit in while you wait for your food.  For dine in, you get a plastic number that you take to your table with you.  You get your own drink and the only service I ever seem to get is when the food is dropped to our table.  Sometimes I wonder if I should even leave a tip for that.  The attitude of the service really depends on the workers.  Some are really friendly, others are just plain b####s.  The manager, an Asian guy, is the nicest guy.

Food:  Like I started off with, they make some really good stuff, and some really bad stuff.  The good stuff first.  They make some great Kalbi.  It is tasty and charred just the right amount to add the perfect flavor to it.  The Adobo anything will always seem to be a winner (adobo fried rice, adobo omelets, etc.).  

Now I will move onto the bad.  Musubis are simple and normally delicious, but I don't like the way they make theirs.  They make it fresh which should be a good thing; however, this does not allow the steam of what should be freshly cooked rice to soften the nori.  Now I've heard people say they like the fresh nori, but I feel the nori on the outside of a musubi should not be tough and chewy.  I'm sorry, but growing up with the stuff I am just against that.  The solution would be to just wrap it in plastic wrap as soon as you make it to trap the steam inside to soften the nori, then unwrap after about three minutes and serve.  

Also, they seem to use ready made sauces.  If not, then they have pretty accurately duplicated the taste of Kikkoman teriyaki sauce.  The thing that used to piss me off was that they would not marinate their meats (except the Kalbi).  If you ordered Teriyaki chicken, you would get a bland piece of chicken with Kikkoman sauce poured over it.  I used to work at some higher end Hawaii restaurants in my day, and when I saw this I wanted to throw my plate.  How hard is it to put meat into a sauce and leave it there for 30 or more minutes so the flavor gets in the meat?  

Summary:  I'm going to be as positive as I can be here and focus on the good.  The price is pretty decent and on most days the staff will be friendly.  What they made well taste outstanding and comes out fairly quick.  Since in Hawaii presentation equals portion size and not prettiness, the presentation here is great.  They give you a good amount of food for the money.  This is a blessing for any college student.  

Will I eat here again? No, since there are far better Hawaii restaurants in the Valley.  Would I recommend it?  Only to students who don't have a car and can't drive to Ross J's, Island Flavors, or the California Hotel.  This place is becoming more and more a chain.  This saddens me.  Why can't a restaurant with some actually Great Hawaii food become a chain?",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,2,2,3,-bAqDrmE-oP1Kb-_ga1e1g

Seriously this thing was as big as my forearm but as thick as my calves. Ginormous but I think it tasted too much like home cooking that I felt like I could make this haha. The adobo fried rice was very vinegary and still a bit sticky, and less fried rice like, to a point where it felt like it was just adobo and rice wrapped in an omelette instead of fried rice being placed in an omelette

Still the price and volume for food you get is good.",EGvptPOz6SDKdxvbeqQ7Vw,0,0,3,o8Wd1szW21Mi6J4y7__lMg

Given its location, its intent is to serve students. Hence, generous portions, cheap prices and whatever tasting food.",q4jhCWLkC6WA5ZiN6hWf9w,3,3,2,0lylXsEtTe0paFjmYAfkyQ
5976831,2014-08-14,3,TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,"Lets just say im big on customer service. And honest, I dont care how shitty the food is, if the customer service is good, I might try this place a second time. Im sitting here waiting for my food order because I payed with my card already. I planned on leaving cash tip as my order comes. But forget about it. This little girl in the front counter is rude, short with words, and cuts her eyes at you as your order. To top it all off, she is too busy yelling at her co worker and barking orders and throwing her hands in the air that she cant hear me calling her. Maybe shes ignoring me. Or maybe shes too engrossed in yelling at the poor guy behind the counter regarding his training and what he should have been training in. Honestly, I dont care anymore. This little heifer needs to learn some manners and some common sense. The only saving grace is that the food smells good. Im sure it tastes fine. Aloha, please get rid of your rude cashier/trainer/ankle biting guard dog and hire another student who I can give a tip to.

Edit: spam musubi was awesome. Kalbi plate cause some annoyance. The kalbi were thin slices of short ribs that were burned because it was so damn thin. Had no flavor. I didnt know that it came with katsu which was great, and chicken..... the chicken was gross. So gross even the neighbors pitbull wouldn't eat it. The best part of it was the side of kimchi it came with. So sad. If you have any suggestions to a better hawaiian bbq place. Please let me know! 

A thought on that waitress, im sure after all these crap reviews about her she should have been gotten rid of.. BYE FELICIA!",ABG8n-fsKfcdWdJqJkNsQA,3,1,2,gcURo2AuRKW5r8zyH4ln_Q

Definitely would visit again when in Vegas. Service was good too.,5yPWU4Y7PP3T0jng0beXZA,1,0,4,UCuS_DokClRZTeHwW8Q9qw

Though I was not hungover during my visit, my custom adobe rice order with adobo meat and egg on top could be the perfect remedy to a hangover or a hungry stomach, and highly recommended.  

Aloha Kitchen has some of the best Filipino adobo meat around.  The texture is comparable to pulled pork or lau lau.  Get their popular egg omelette filled with fried adobo rice, a must have eat when you're in Vegas or to go order on your way home.

If you want another taste of heaven, get their banana pancake.  I'm not fond of bananas or banana bread, but this will make you a fan.  The sauce combined with fresh doughy pancakes with a slight hint of banana will make you want to come back for more.  With these two awesome dishes alone plus their good service and great home cooking, Aloha Kitchen should get no less than 5 stars.",p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ,4,2,5,majl-HWFCr202pR-AvPdtA
