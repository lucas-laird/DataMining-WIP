116118,2012-05-01,0,Tq032toLj_WQY3e7P3aQ8A,"The other reviews for this branch aren't that great, but I had a generally positive experience eating breakfast here this afternoon. 

I usually just go with one of the breakfast combos, because I like a little bit of everything. Today I got a belgian waffle combo with scrambled eggs, sausage links, and buttered toast. The waffle was great and the toast was really yummy. The rest were pretty standard. The last time I ate here, I got pancakes and they were a bit gross. 

No major complaints about the service. There was only one server, and not many customers so I didn't notice any long waits.

The only thing that bothered me was the water. It was disgusting. I have a thing against restaurants that serve nasty water, making me wonder where they even get it from.

I've been here a couple times within the last few years, so my feelings here are a bit mixed. Today was the best experience of them all, so I was glad for the slight improvement. 

There are better IHOPs around town, but I'll give four stars for my pleasant experience today.",4e6MMvMT_VFEtYXmRRelUA,1,0,4,mzkVPeGFKHjqU3KZfpYDOg

We really enjoy eating at your restaurant and have been for years...but please do some serious cleaning. When a person visit the restrooms and some seating areas we can see in the kitchen. The floors and the women's restroom needs some attention. Sorry to say the food is slipping we are trying to hang-in with you. Maybe we will try you in a few months, have to get over the last visit.

248353,2015-04-03,2,Tq032toLj_WQY3e7P3aQ8A,"The International House of Pancakes is where I get my brunch on. I used to go to Denny's, but one of the kids selling newspapers up front was constantly pressuring me to buy a copy, so I stopped going there cause I felt like I had to pay a toll to enter. Sometimes, the kid even tested my knowledge.

Kid: Did you know that mining still exists in Nevada?
Me: *pretending to not know, but I know because I'm old* Oh...really? You don't say...
Kid: Yeah,  learned about it in the newspaper. *holds one up and points to it*
Me: *thinking to myself* I just wanna eat pancakes!

At IHOP, none of that happens. I just walk in, tell them my name, and they usually lead me to a table right away. I like their chocolate chip pancakes, which aren't bad, and I usually order them as part of a combo with bacon, eggs, and hash browns... that are freaking delicious. Other international offerings that I've tried are the German crepes and Harvest Grain pancakes, those are all right.

The servers are always on their A-Game. I had one who was well-spoken and relaxed. I like to think he teaches mediation on the side. Too bad I don't remember his name and have only seen him once. Maybe he went to go teach meditation full-time. 

Is there anything that sucks about this IHOP? Yes. It's busy on the weekends, but at least I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table to open up. Another thing that sucks is if the main waiting area is full, you'll have to wait in the secluded waiting room by the entry. Makes me feel like a second-rate citizen.",CP4WKLIlLcIVm6ov8umgdw,0,1,4,o1MQ_RKojeTeKgGQEoWhjQ

I've been here several times. Yeah sometimes service is slow, sometimes it takes awhile to get a table, but overall service is good, food is good and the prices are not to bad. At my recent trip, we sat down quickly bacause we asked to sit outside ( TIP alert - they will usually seat you right away if your ok with sitting on their patio) It was late in the morning, hadn't eaten a thing despite having been up since 5.

Even after you tell them to please make sure it's done right because you've had issues in the pass where it was wrong. My husband placed his order at 8:20. He arrives and pays at 8:43. He he notices that his country fried steak has the gravy on top, which he ordered on the side. So he informed the cashier and she stated we can remake it. At this point my husband was like whatever I don't want to because other food would get cold. So he gets in to his car and he checks the whole order just to make sure. Sure and be  behold the kids meal was wrong. So he goes back into IHOP and has them fix the whole order. He waits other 10 min. The cashier gives him back the order and assured everything was in there. At no point while he was waiting did a manager ever talk to him. To even offer a apology for the inconvenience. 

So he arrives at the house 9:15 he starts giving everybody the food and to find out that they didn't give us the full stack of pancakes we ordered. So now obviously he's livid. So I call IHOP and speak to a manager and tell what happened and that's it's not the first time. I told her I wanted a refund and she says that they don't do refunds. I told her I wanted to return everything and a refund. She told me the only thing she could do was give me two free entrées and next time when I call  to asked to speak to a manager and put in my order with them to make sure it was done right. That's sad that I have to talk to a manager to maybe ensure that my order comes out right. I told her I didn't want that I just wanted to return everything. She's like the two free entrées it's like it's $16 I  started to laugh and say OK but I paid more than that. How is that helping me. We didn't even eat the food. Because by now the foods cold waiting to see if I could to to a manager to return. So, now I'm out of food and money. I will NEVER go to this location again.

I was sorely disappointed that we did, even with the coupon.  I had the ham, onion and bell pepper omelet and pancakes.  The cheese was not melted on top and I tried to push the cheese underneath the omelet so that it would melt; the eggs in the omelet were not light and fluffy; the pancakes were okay but by no means as good as Stoney's in the same parking lot as IHOP. I used the old fashioned syrup it was of Log Cabin quality however the remaining flavored syrups had a very artificial taste.  My hubby got a stack breakfast, I think it was an english muffin, egg, hollandaise and it had fresh spinach which was a plus, however, the ""crispy"" bacon as stated in the menu was more like ""super limp' bacon. He asked the waitress if there was anyway that they could crisp it up and she retorted ""they make it fresh"" I am still confused how that explains limp bacon.... nonetheless she took it away and I could hear her call back to the kitchen. The replacement back was better, but not by much. He also ordered iced tea, I realize that the price of drinks has gone up, but I was surprised that ice tea at ihop would cost $3. The hash browns were clearly frozen, although again I realize that most breakfast places here use frozen hash browns.  With a coupon we paid $20.

Here it's called country fried steak and will run you north of eleven bucks before coffee and OJ. It comes with the standard eggs and potatoes. As always, and to maintain the consistency and integrity of the quest, I was going to inquire as to the possibility of substituting a pancake for my choice of bread. No need to.  It's on the menu as CFS, hashbrowns, two eggs AND two pancakes. The pancakes were outstanding. Hot and fresh. The hashbrowns were about average. The eggs were a little runny for over-easy, so keep that in mind. You might want to go over-medium. The CFS itself was man-sized and tasty. The breading was full of flavor and the meat could be cut with a fork. No need for a steak knife here. The Mrs. opted for the Strawberry Stuffed French Toast and was pleased with her selection. The coffee here is not going to win any awards, but was decent. The waitress was very attentive and the food was ready and on the table in surprisingly quick fashion.

We were disappointed to learn at the register that kids drinks are not included. Kids meals are $4.99/5.99, yet kids drinks are $1.79 each. That's almost half of the cost of a meal, so you're saving only $2. We still would've ordered milk, but the server should've mentioned that at time of ordering. Most other restaurant include drinks in kids meals. Super cheesy not to.

We put our name down with having 2 adults and a child requiring a high chair. The hostess took our name down, incorrectly, and only had us for 2. When we were finally brought to our table, with a normal expected wait, the hostess called out two names and the other group cut in front of us on the way to the table and jumped in our booth. The hostess just froze an idiotic look on their face and then shrugged her shoulders. She then found another table with crap still on it and said that it would be cleaned right away. Now during this entire time, I am holding my child, and when I asked about the high chair, she looked shocked as if she wasn't expecting us to need one. She said she would go find one, and never came back. We literally stood outside of our booth for about 5 minutes waiting on a chair for my son. After I snagged one of the workers, they looked around and finally came back to me saying that all of the high chairs were being currently used. 
I sent the wife and kid to the car as I talked to the manager. She seemed truly sincere with her apology but wasn't able to offer any solution. She tried to convince me to come back at another time for a free meal, but didn't take my name down or give any voucher, so I think she was full  of crap.

Vibes: 
It's honestly like any IHOP. It has the feeling of efficiency and corporate diner feels. Not really much to say.

Service:
Now the service was something to talk about. Most times I'll agree that service makes the place! My service was an absolute delight. Her name was Jaime and she was superb. Despite it being 2 in the morning, she was patient, sociable, and very helpful. 

Food:
There's never much to say about food at chain restaurants like this. The pancakes were lovely. Very fluffy! The meal was as nice as I expect it to be.",HH7VzcNn3jAZ0_J4Xr9JsQ,1,0,5,FwV7Fs9K3kX1U-3GT9B0Dg

Went here for my wife's birthday(with 3 kids) AYCE pancake breakfast. Took ""15 minute wait"" which actually turned into a 20-25 minute wait. Once seated, it took a bit for the waitress to come(it was busy so it was slightly understandable), but either way. No smile... No intro.... No NOTHING. Just ""What do you want to drink & what do you want to order?"" 

Once ordered, she came back about 15 mins later with our WATER & just dropped the glasses & straws & ran. Then another 10 with the food(wife's stack & my sausage & egg combo). The kids(ranging from 2-5... Let's face it, they DONT eat much!) didn't get anything because we figured they would just share our pancakes(as they ALWAYS do) because nobody at ANY IHOP(including the waitress we had last time we were here) we go too has ANYTHING to say about the kids nibbling out of our plates. 

But THIS particular waitress had a problem with our kids nibbling. (We found out when we received the bill) Charged $1.99 for a sharing charge! 

I/we never even got the chance to ask for refills on the pancakes but she brought me ""2 just in case"" & NOTHING for my wife. So she had to have 1 of the 2 that she just brought(which took another 15 minutes). And again.... Dropping the food& running(the WRONG order I might add).... Took another 5-10 to just get her attn to tell her that I did NOT order the food that she dropped. So she finally dropped & ran my food(the right order this time). My wife & I tasted the potatoes & realized they just didn't ""taste right""..... But was she around to tell? NOPE. Once she finally came around, I asked for white toast instead. Again... Dropping & running.  

When we received the bill(with the sharing charge).... We were dumbfounded when we saw the $1.99 on it. So we TRIED to question it but again.... Nowhere to be found & too busy dropping & running. When we finally got hold of her... Her response was ""The AYCE is for the consumption of the person that prefers it.... Do you understand?! Wait a minute.... I'll let (whatever name she babbled) explain it!"" And bolted away from the table.

A person(ID'd them-self as ""The Manager"" & stayed the same EXACT thing that the waitress said & then questioned(being VERY SNOTTY) us(the customer) when we told her that the kids did nibble off our plates but WE actually consumed the majority of the pancakes. 

She finally took it off the bill(after giving my wife & I a VERY dirty look. Stated(VERY snotty) ""I'll take it off THIS time but remember, it's not me.... It's the company that charges"".

5278382,2014-06-16,1,Tq032toLj_WQY3e7P3aQ8A,"Thinking about eating breakfast at IHOP on a Sunday morning? Usually a bad idea. When we pulled up, the parking lot was full and there were a few families standing outside of the doors. I fought my way up to the hostess stand and made a reservation for a party of two. 20 to 25 minutes she said. My husband and I waited for less than a minute out in the sweltering heat when we spotted an empty bench in the mid-section. We sat down in the in-between section and then after another minute passed by, my husband motioned for me to move seats again to a bench closer to the hostess stand. What is this, musical chairs? Anyways, my point is that the seating area was being cleared out in pronto like fashion. 

Our name was called seconds after. Instead of waiting 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes even though it looked crazy busy here. We were seated in a booth section and our waiter quickly took our drink orders. I'm a fan of IHOP's vanilla and mocha iced coffees ($2.99). The drinks are a little pricey but at least you get refills. I ordered a short stack of pancakes ($5.99) and the Mr. got some kind of ginormous combo plate. The food was out in less than 10 minutes. The food was made to order and tasted great.

If you're going to IHOP and ordering pancakes, french toast, or waffles, I cannot stress the importance of using their Butter Pecan syrup!!! It makes everything better and knocks the socks off of plain ol' maple syrup. My husband introduced me to Butter Pecan syrup and I've been hooked ever since. I swear I dump half the bottle of that sweet stuff on my pancakes. ;)

Our waiter was on his game. He checked up on us often and made sure everything was okay. When my husband's plate came out minus some hash browns, the waiter said he'd take care of it and the hash browns were out seconds later. Our bill came to $22 and some change. The only complaint I have is that when we went to the counter to the pay, the cashier either tried to withhold the receipt or forgot to hand it back to us. I've had this problem at least three times before, so it can't be coincidence. Thing is, that receipt has a survey on it which gets you a free short stack on your next visit. I rarely fill them out, but hey the point is, I want that receipt! 

I liked the fact that we were able to get in and out of the restaurant with virtually no wait time. The customer service overall was average, but our waiter in particular was awesome. The IHOP in Centennial Center is your usual everyday IHOP. I'll be back when I want some more Butter Pecan syrup with a side of pancakes.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,1,1,4,KCavdJbsyM9Dz0gDc1BE9A

Everything has a lot of salt in it. EVERYTHING. Everything is pre-made as well, from the eggs, to the pancake mix, to their stuffed french toast. How do I know this? I asked once if I could get the stuffed french toast without raisins in the toast. ""Oh, they are already in there. We just thaw it."" Um. EW. 
I've gotten still frozen strawberries (which were not good at all), greasy eggs (do they saute them in butter back there?) and limp, ill looking tomato slices.
I use to go to this place when I was in high school, when there was no other place open late for teens to mingle and eat junk. It seems every time I have ever gone, something gets messed up. Whether it is my plate of sliced tomatoes that somehow turned into a plate of pancakes (they really try to give those things out), or my eggs being over easy, not scrambled. 
Service is alright; sometimes you get a slow waiter, and sometimes you don't, but I have never had a rude one.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,1,0,2,urc7J-wY8kLG6auVXPzkXQ

We got seated & our waitress was extremely rude right off the bat (I wish I would have gotten her name). When we ordered our drinks she threw the straws on our table instead of putting them down nicely. When she took our food order one of my friends ordered the country fried steak & eggs. Our waitress proceeded to ask her what kind of pancakes she wanted. My friend didn't even know it came with pancakes & decided she would just get blueberry. For some odd reason she was only rude to our table. At all of her other tables she was as nice as can be. Maybe because we were a group of young adults? Idk but I found her act to be very disrespectful. As we were getting ready to leave we got our bill & noticed my friend got charged extra for her pancakes that she originally didn't want so we kindly asked our waitress about it. Our waitress lied trying to say that she said it came with buttermilk pancakes ONLY when in reality she asked what kind of pancakes my friend wanted because it came with it. My friends bill was rather high so she wanted to know why she was being charged extra (not a big deal she was going to pay for it regardless if they took it off or not). It became an issue/argument & even got the manager involved who did absolutely NOTHING to help out. She was basically on the waitresses side claiming ""oh well she's been here for 10 years & we've never had an issue"". I used to work at a restaurant & my manager would have NEVER doubted a customer rather if they were right or wrong... The customer is always right. It is the restaurants job to make sure their customers have a great experience, am I right? Anyways, nothing got solved & we payed our bills & moved on. After the last bill was paid (because we had separate checks) the MANAGER chased us down asking if we stole a cell phone in one of the cashiers drawers?! What the hell?! I was so furious at this point. We all felt so judged, it's unbelievable how they treated us. I will NEVER go back. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.",kgQpD_2JAtK5xCbZI0HxKQ,1,0,1,wFaF9C-XQoMfNx4dmT1Htw

Today we went in and I put my name in the list and let them know we would need a highchair. We waited the 15 minutes to be seated and then were ""seated"" by a waitress. At the same time she was seating us another ""host"" stepped in front of us and sat someone else there. She pointed us to another table and said she'd get a highchair. My husband stood there with our son for 5 minutes as she walked around helping others while seeing my husband standing there with our now crying 1 yr old. She didn't even bother to say she had someone else bringing it. Then finally a waiter came over and said ""sorry we have no highchairs"" and walked away. We got up and left and when my husband talked to the manager he pretty much got the sorry, sucks to be you, but come back again.",zRcgTyJBqFNeGYH2TSzSIw,1,0,1,ji8Ubz3PmNWf9LwyA3A9vQ
