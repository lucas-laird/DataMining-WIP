It's so rare to find genuinely friendly staff in Las Vegas. They had our reservation perfect and gave my party it's own side of the restaurant. There was games for the kids. The pizza was very good. Roberto is a great manager (owner?) and he accommodated us with every need we had, which included staying open a little late. Do yourself a favor and go and support a Las Vegas business that deserves your money, time and appetite. 

ps - all you other Las Vegas business owners, Go to Graziano's Pizza and take note of how to treat customers right.",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,2,2,5,rzYTA7Wjg-ct3Xe7aI5vCw

Maybe it's just me but I would expect better customer service and presentation from a pizza place that hosts a lot of sport meets.

I went for the buffet, after reading some of the reviews & following the gastronomically sage advice of Misty Y. :D She has not steered me wrong yet. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Roberto, who graciously informed us that we were just in time to still partake in the buffet happy hour special. Lol, which includes the drinks in the price of the already reasonably priced buffet (available from 11-12). 

There are a great number of delectable choices here & I wanted everything! 

First off, I had some pizza, the Sicilian sandwich & some broasted chicken, which I am a sucker for, and which I probably haven't had since I lived & worked in Kuwait one year. Why aren't there more broasted chicken places?! 

Anyways...round 2 was corn chowder & pasta. The corn chowder was a little too sweet for my liking, but it was tasty. The pasta was very good for a buffet. 

I finished off the buffet with a slice of apple pizza & the cinnamon buns...YUM!! Both were very good & I have to say that the cinnamon buns are a close second to the ones served at CiCi's ;) 

Anyone who has read my reviews for my usual favorite pizza & pizza buffet spot, which shall remain nameless, know that I am a frequent patron of that ""spot"", which has been disappointing me lately. Alas, I may have found a new pizza buffet ""spot""! 

I feel that I will become a Graziano's regular ;) & who knows, I may even try out the Monster pizza challenge some day. 

Stay tuned...",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,3,1,5,Cz1zYm6EWxBlyM9PepBn4w

The price was $6.49 per person, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot. On this particular day, the pizza felt like it was under the heat lamp for way too long and there was nothing really fresh. The fried chicken was dry and soggy. I can honestly say, the only thing that was decent was the pepperoni pizza, as that was edible.

The hostess ordered for us so all we got try was their pizza, fried chicken & salad. I must say their chicken was so good it reminded me of Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles back in the LBC, lol. That's why I'm giving them 4 stars. 
Other wise I'd be giving them 3 stars for the service.

You get your own plates & utensils which is cool, but there were no busser's to clear out our tables let a lone the other tables around. This place is just like Chucky Cheese without Chucky so you can imagine how busy it can get in here so they should have had more busser's clearing out the tables more often.

In July I ordered a pizza for delivery Monster Pizza - I had two slices.  I had nothing else to eat all day long except two bottles of water.  3-4 hours later - FOOD POISONING !  All the symptons of food poisoning as I had it many years ago.  I called he restaurant to let them know that I had food poisoning  to ask if anyone else had compplained that evening ( liek he would actually tell me ) and wanted them to know the situation in case I had to be taken to a hospital.  The surpervisor I spoke with was apolgetic and sauid the manager would call  me tomorrow to follow up.  no call.  no refund... nothing but me sick all night and sore the the next day and half.  I should have known better as I was there at the restaurant a couple of years before and there were ants crawling all over the table and ants in my soft drink.

1024635,2010-01-04,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"As many others have mentioned, the best thing about Graziano's is their buffet. Although not very large, the food was damn good, and for only $6.50, its definitely worth going to.  The only downside was that drinks cost extra, aside from water.

I got there right at 11 when the buffet began and there was a salad bar with a variety of toppings, macaroni/spaghetti stuff, a couples soups, giant potato wedges,  broasted chicken, garlic knots, calzones, sandwiches and of course pizza.

I tried most of the things available and all but the potato wedges tasted good and flavorful, the wedges were fried/broasted, but tasted bland and boring.

Later on they brought out dessert pizza (half cherry half peach) and it was DELICIOUS. I've never had dessert pizza and I absolutely loved the peach one. One of the workers also said that if I wanted anything else she could let the cooks know (canoli's would have been nice but I was stuffed).

Hit the buffet - with soda it cost $8.50 give or take a few dimes.

It reminded me a little bit like Shakey's bunch 'o lunch but not quite to their  "" high"" standards.  Also reminded me a little of the old chuck e cheese days with my daughter but this place is a cut above chucky's 

salad bar - basic stuff - liked a few slices of peperoni on my salad !

pasta - spaghetti and elbow macaroni with two sauce options - can you say....ragu  ( actually a smidge better ) 

chicken and potato wedges - both coated the same ...hmmmm...tasted the same, too.

pizza - well....first round, THERE WAS NO PIZZA 

2nd round - pizza - had a slice of sausage and pepperoni - nothing special here - my guess is the pre-cooked, SYSCO sausage; the pepperoni had no flavor but alot of grease !

I've been craving broasted chicken for sometime now and saw on the internet that Graziano's had a geniune broasted chicken. When we arrive we both ordered the lunch buffet at $6.49 + $1.85 fountain drink. Seemed very reasonable. Started with the salad bar and a garlic knot which were both excellent. I noticed for being such a huge place it was fairly slow for a Sunday. With these conditions to keep in mind the pizza and chicken sat for a while and I'm sure I don't have to tell you what happens to the food after it sits under heatlamps after a while. Average at best. I guess what bothered me the most was the self-proclaimed friendly/helpful staff. The only people they were helpful to was among themselves. Carrying on with their conversations, never acknowleging the customers. Must have been at least four employees right there at the buffet. 

I will say this looks like a great place for the kids. Lots of games.

But please, please don't insult me by serving what they call pizza. And it's expensive as hell. I really wasn't going to say anything, but the next night at home I noticed something. I was eating a leftover piece of DeGiornno pizza (frozen pizza). I was amazed how much better this was than the sorry piece of s*it I was charged over $20 for. It honestly looked like a frozen pizza. But not a good frozen pizza, one that looked like it came in a three pack for five dollars. Their price is crazy high for what you get It saddens me because I like this place.

I also came for the Chicken Parmesan, which I had 6 years ago when I was in town helping a friend move. 

I clicked on the restaurant.com link on the yelp grazziano's page and bought a $25 certificate for $10 before I headed to the event. I sat with Anthony M, Jieun L, and Teri C. I forgot which combo they ordered, but it had Broasted Chicken, Potato Wedges, and a Pizza. We also shared a couple half pitchers of Blue Moon.

The Chicken Parmesan was not as good as I had remembered. Maybe it was because when I first tasted it 6 years ago, I was moving furniture all day and was super hungry. I had a couple bites of a slice of sausage pizza. I didn't think it was all that. I didn't try anything else.

On our way back to the house, we got a call saying that all the workers were there but couldn't do anything until the inspector came and did his thing...well like most city inspectors this guy took forever to even show up at the house. My mom felt bad and we decided to get something to pick up so the workers and my family can eat. She insisted on fried chicken. Well, since I am not a big fried chicken fan...I tried to think of a place that we could go to get out of driving 20 min out just for a bucket of chicken. As i was driving I we came across Graziano's Pizza. 

I have had their pizza before at work functions but have never ordered from the Restaurant before. I was extremely surprised to find that it is a sit in buffet-restaurant style place. I they even have an arcade area for the kids with a prize table. Kind of like a smaller version of an Adult Chucky Cheese. There is also an area for you to hold birthday parties there, with three different Birthday Packages to choose from. I didn't get a chance to experience the buffet at this place unfortunately, but i saw that there was a salad bar, a couple of pizzas to choose from and whattaya know... Fried Chicken(Go Figure) =D Buffet is like $6.97and they have weekday specials. Wednesdays special is Seniors get 1/2 off. 

The pizzas are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The crust is good and the toppings are full. They give you your moneys worth of toppings and don't just drizzle it on there. They even have ""No Marinara"" pizzas. But don't think that they only serve pizza and chicken. They do have desserts and pastas. My favor tie dessert from there is the Cannolis.

1708018,2010-09-07,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"My first visit to Grazzianos was a bust do to some poor planning on my part and confusion on the part of the restaurant. Needless to say I was convinced to give it another try and I'm glad I did. I did the Monster Pizza Challenge (which I proudly failed) and the rest of my party had purchased the buffet. 
The Monster Pizza challenge was fun and the pizza itself was really good. This thing is an enormous pizza. like table covering big. The crust is pretty think but the cheese and all the toppings (especially the bacon) all come together to make it a good salty cheesy fun experience. The buffet had a bunch of different pizzas like bbq chicken and pepperoni, plus they had salad and mac and cheese. The apple pie pizza was pretty interesting and they also had fresh brownies. very nice value. 
There is a play area for kids to earn tickets for prizes but its off to the side and not annoying like a chuck e cheese. Plus they serve beer by the pitcher for the grown ups. Dave and Roberto were very attentive and friendly and the service was they provided was great. 
My only gripe is that they air fake oops i mean fox news on their TVs. Minor complaint but c'mon guys us bleeding heart liberals like pizza too:) I would recommend CNN for a neutral news vibe or maybe just ditch the news all together and put food network on or just make all the TVs ESPN 1 and 2.

It took a while to get our orders but through the register (3) value - with the internet coupon, we got a soda and a large pizza for $14 between two people - not too bad.

We came here with low expectations of the food. Really, the main draw was to support the group of Yelpers in the Graziano's Monster Challenge (10lbs of pizza, 45 minutes). Shout outs to Jen S. who set up the UYE - it was a lot of fun for the supporters... er... maybe not so much fun for the competitive eaters - LOL!

Overall, for our food, I split a soda and pizza with my hubby for $14 (the soda was for me). The pizza crust had a nice crispness to the bottom however it was rather doughy for me. Toppings were okay - not great. I would say probably your average store bought pizza - nothing more or less.

The most impressive thing was our champion eaters - who would need to eat the equivalent of three large pizzas each to finish the monster challenge.

The pizza was surprisingly decent, and we ate all of it in one sitting. Thin/chewy crust, decent sauce, no canned toppings. I had semi-low expectations when we walked because there were a bunch of 6-year-olds running laps around the place - half of the restaurant is a Chuck-E-Cheese style game room. The restaurant side was peaceful enough to have a conversation. 

Saw pictures on the wall of the 10-pound, 2-person pizza eating contest contestants and the big pizza itself, and the whole time I was eating our 2 free pizzas I was feeling pretty confident that I would be able polish off half of the contest pizza. 

A few months ago we were driving back from LA and stopped off of the I-10 to grab a quick dinner and ended up at a pizza place in Beaumont, CA, that was formerly a Graziano's. From the looks, taste and texture of the pizza, it was clear that the new owners kept the old Graziano's recipe. We easily ate an entire large pie.

I guess I lied there's more than 2 reasons to step into the door.  Their lunch buffets 11 am - 3 pm are only $6.49 it includes pizza, pasta, salad, dessert, and more. Pizzas were hot, not cold or left out too long.  They have a good selection of arcade video games and they host parties.  Expect little kids running around screaming.

2432558,2012-02-13,1,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Prior to making my first visit here, all I knew of this place was that they had this monster pizza eating challenge. My boyfriend and I are always compelled by these food challenges, we figured we'd scope out the place and see what they had to offer. Upon walking in, we were surprised at how large the place was and the fact that they were kid-friendly. One side of the restaurant is set up with a decent amount of children's games that can be exchanged for prizes at a prize counter. The other side is set up for mainly dining, with television screens placed along each wall and corner for those who may be there to catch a game or two.

So back to my first visit. We walked into the door and were kind of getting the feel of the place as to not appear as though we were in foreign territory (which we obviously appeared to be), because as we were casually browsing the menu we were asked by a man behind the counter if it was our first time there. The man, whose name was Roberto had such a kind demeanor about him. Being that it was our first time there, he gave us a run down of the food on the menu as well as informing us of the lunch buffet that was still going on. He encouraged us to walk over to the lunch buffet to see their selections (salad, broasted chicken, potato wedges, a variety of pizza, desserts, etc) as it was a very good deal. We were surprised at first because he saved us a good amount of money considering we were ready to pay for a whole pizza, chicken wings, and drinks when we ended up paying 6.49 each! The best part about doing it this way was that if there was a pizza that was not out on the buffet, they were kind enough to make it for us.

The potatoes are to big. Wish they were more like mojos. Need to slice them thin. Anyway the food was ok. We didn't know the free drink is only from 2-3. So we hade to pay 1.85 a drink. Thought that was kinda high but they need to make money someway.  It looks like a great place to have parties for kids. Garlic knots were good. The guy making the pizzas did make 2 different veggie pizzas for us. All and all good I'm sure we will be back. They kept our table clean.,8O6YdO7ZntA8nQhlUDubsw,0,0,4,qTXGYWNCaHnlwl48LoC77w

The pizza tasted like cardboard and a lot of the games either ate tokens or didn't give tickets when they should have. The pizza was seriously thin cardboard pizza and the employees are all teenagers that don't know what to do. One of them didn't fully understand how to give my son the junkiest of dollar store multi-pack toys in exchange for 25 tickets. It's not that difficult. I would never come here on our own accord, but I'll likely be back after next soccer season. Hopefully the pizza is less cardboard like. 

BTW: I complained about the machine eating my tokens and not giving tickets. They said they'd check it out, and then didn't. I stood at the counter talking to the coach for 10 minutes, waiting for them to give me back my eaten up tokens, and no one cared!",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,0,2,GBwnW-maHUGXIFfnyFjJNA

First the positive: the pizza and drinks were fine for a pizza buffet restaurant--average and just fine.  The restaurant was spacious and clean.  Now the negative:  Our youth soccer league partnered with Graziano's to host our end-of-year parties for the kids. Our team reserved tables for a particular evening almost two weeks prior to our party.  The evening we arrived, almost all the tables were reserved, but no tables were held for our kids or parents. When staff and management was asked about it, they immediately took an attitude that somehow this was our fault.  It took almost 20 minutes to resolve and the service that followed reflected their earlier attitude, leaving us feeling as if we had forced them to accommodate us.  There was at least one other team there at the same time, with the same problem.  It's bad business that Graziano's clearly overbooked for the evening.   It's very poor that they take it out on their guests.  The restaurant has potential but I won't go back and definitely can't recommend Graziano's for a kids' group activity.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,0,0,1,XdMPCTddJlH71Au5z0U_8A
2944620,2010-10-28,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"I love this place. I think I could come back everyday and not be disappointed or get bored of the place. Yes, they have carry out pizzas and what not, but really what you want is the lunch buffet! It's only $6.50 for most days of the week, and it is well worth the price. Oh, but if you want a drink, it's extra $$$. They do give water cups though.

The buffet includes some type of salad bar with plenty of choices for toppings, soups, different types of breadsticks, broasted chicken (which I don't like), these (disgusting) overly large sized potato wedges, pizza, dessert pizza, and other desserts like brownies (gross) and cinammon rolls (delicious). 

There are a bunch of specialty pizzas included in the buffet as well including some deep dish options. The specialty pizzas that I tried included the buffalo chicken and the barbecue chicken pizza. Those are my two favorites along with just plain cheese deep dish pizza, which, in reality, it anything but plain. 

Their garlic knots are great. They are very salty and have lots of garlic flavor in them. I think I could have eaten a dozen of those if I had a stomach of steel. 

Overall, I couldn't ask for anything more in a pizza place. They're perfect. If you want something that isn't out in the buffet, you can just tell one of the cooks and they will make it for you. Great service and great food!",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,1,1,5,shZBAr4_-pRmyp63CoH5oA

- Pineapple and ham
- Cheese
- Pepperoni
- Chicken (BBQ and Grilled)
- Club Sandwhich Pizza

They have a lot of pizza choices, and special requests can be made. Quoting the manager, ""Just like CiCi's"" but way way way better!

They also have fresh salad, with a lot of toppings and salad dressing choices!

I love the garlic knots too, one of the best garlic breads I've ever had!

The place is comfortable, with seating choices ranging from booths to long tables for big groups. Though not an ample amount of sunlight comes in, lighting is good.. not too dark nor too bright. They have arcade too.. good for adults, kids, and kids-at-heart.. like my boyfriend!

Last, they have the best customer service. I will choose their staff over any other resto in a heartbeat. Everyone is friendly and helpful.. they always try to build relationships with their customers. I can say this without second thoughts.. i am a real satisfied customer.

Fortunately, the pizza is much better than Chuck E's. The Graziano Special is full of pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers and the crust is thick and chewy. The Brooklyn style pizza is a thin cheese pizza that's great for toddlers. My two and a half year old loved it. This place may not be the best pizza joint in town, but it's respectable and fairly priced.

They've got specials on certain days of the week:

This is an excellent place to eat.  Very Very Clean.  The inside was well lit and Cool.  I had the Buffet for $7.40 which included, a great little salad bar with ham, peperoni, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, and much more and people were building huge salads.  Continuing on, there were sandwiches, sliced like a Peta which looked good, two soups, then fried chicken (legs, thighs, breast, wings) which was good and crunchy.  Next was spaghetti with 2 sauces, and elbow maccaroni with a marinaro sauce.  The spaghetti was actually good (I had the meat sauce) Continuning on, there was deserts,  cinnamon rolls, and possibly fudge. Next the pizza.  I ask the person behind the counter if they had any anchovy pizza and he said we take special orders and I'll have some put out in ten minutes.  He came over to the table about 8 minutes later and said, ""The pizza you wanted will be out in 2 minutes"".  I requested, Anchovy, sausage, peperoni, and cheese.  The pizza was out, right from the oven, hot, tasty, and the crust was just enough crispy without being overcooked.  This was good pizza.  They gave you a cup for the  serve yourself drink fountain and everytime I went for a re-fill, the old plates were removed from my table, without my knowledge.  As I ate I watched the staff and they were constantly cleaning the food line and surrounding area.  Not just wiping it down but taking a paint brush and lifting and moving things and cleaning under them.  I also watched as they put out new Pizza for the line, they did not put the older pizza back on the trays but threw it away so the pizza was always fresh.  I was really impressed.  There were also video games in an area where the kids were playing and not near the eating area.  If you like Good Pizza (request what you want and they will put it out), a clean cool place to eat, a good variety, give this place a try.  I hope they are successful as they had everythiing right when I was there and I can't wait to go back.  This place is in the south-east cornor of the Vons shopping center kinda hidden, but the ""All you eat Pizza"" sign can be seen from Desert Inn.

3943310,2010-08-28,1,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Ugh, too much pizza! My wife and I were eating leftover pizza for two days after we decided to try the Beast pizza challenge here during the UYE. As you may have gathered from other reviews, we were among 4 yelp teams who made the attempt that evening. All of which were doomed to complete and utter failure. That being said, we had fun and enjoyed the pizza immensely, so it was most certainly not a waste. 

Now, about the pizza itself...  10lbs total weight currently (I say currently because it USED to be 8 lbs) with 2.4 lbs of dough, 1.5 lbs of sauce, and 2 lbs of cheese, meat, and vegetable toppings respectably. We got just the regular pizza with everything on it, though substitutions are allowed! I wish I had known this from the get-go as I would have gotten rid of the olives in exchange for more pineapple! Blech.. olives... lol. Despite the olives the pizza was VERY tasty, the dough was thick and a good texture, the sauce was yummy, and the toppings were just delicious. One of the better pizzas we have had in awhile I would say. It is by no means a gourmet pizza though, you should expect a huge mess when trying to eat this pizza! For one thing, all the toppings are just piled onto it so that when you take a bite you will likely lose a few if you aren't careful (not to mention you need to watch that sauce! Don't come wearing clothes you'd feel bad about staining ^_-).  Also, the pizza is cut into squares, so the slices in the middle will NOT have a crust edge to grip... extra mess right there! The pieces were so thick that the plastic pizza serving utensils they gave us were bending under the weight! My wife and I just barely managed to eat through half the pizza and we were full for the rest of the evening. I heard similar stories from the other yelpers doing the challenge.

This challenge just isn't realistic for your everyday eater. 10 lbs is just too BIG! And they expect you to finish within 45 minutes!! The challenge prior to this was 8 lbs, but you also had a full hour to complete it as well. At least then you had a fighting chance. To date they have only had one duo actually finish this challenge which honestly should have been a warning sign for the rest of us. Still, would I do this again?

I felt pretty good about finishing half of my half of the pizza.  My partner was also only able to finish about half of his side of the pizza.

4152809,2009-08-11,2,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"So I'm a frequent Vegas visitor, but more importantly, I'm a fan of eating challenges.  I can't recall how I found out about Graziano's, but all I knew was that they had this 8 lb. pizza challenge, and that I was pretty confident that I could be able to put away 4 lbs, if I had a reliable partner.

I took on, and failed to beat the pizza challenge that was on Travel Channel's Man vs. Food just outside of my home in Atlanta, but it gave me a good barometer to know that 4.5 lbs. of pizza was my limit.

Unfortunately, when I showed up to Graziano's I found out the hard way that the challenge was no longer 8 lbs, but now a menacing TEN pounds!

Regardless, I took it on anyway.  I'd come a long way, and win or lose, it was a challenge.  I plunked down the $47 for the pizza, and a friend of mine and I went to work.

The buffet looked really top-notch, but I dared not spoil my appetite.  The pizza arrived, and it looked delicious.  Covered in a variety of meats, as well as olives, onions, pineapple, peppers and garlic, the great news was that it tasted as good as it looked, regardless of the absurd size of it.

In the end, I managed to miraculously pack away all five pounds of my half of the pizza, but my friend did not.  So it was still a loss, sadly.  Looking back at the ordeal, the food was delicious, and IMO, better than the pizza challenge in Atlanta.  I couldn't eat for the rest of the day, and instead of getting drunk on comped drinks at the blackjack tables, I was drunk on pizza for fourteen hours.

As for other details, Graziano's is located like 6-7 miles west of the northern part of the Strip, and is very easy to get to.  Parking is plentiful, convenient, and the restaurant itself is clean, staff friendly, and I enjoyed the food, regardless of the losing result.",uq_xDJi7cmZ9wLE8v3X4Bg,2,2,4,nh5IrJSx-WEfroRCvKUdeA

4260457,2012-09-03,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"This review is for 4.5 stars. Entertainment Book Coupon participant (bogo).

Part One: We had the lunch buffet with some friends @ $6.49 some weeks ago, but I heard about this place from an old co-worker at another office, some years ago. So, I was familiar; knew that this co-worker's son liked having his birthday parties here, since there were games to play and coupons to redeem (kinda like Chuck E Chees, but on a smaller scale). Lots of selections, but appears small when compared to a casino buffet. But, this is when Quality over Quantity wins. And c'mon, it's not like all the Vegas buffets in town are good; most are mediocre, let's be real here (mystery foods, not enough flavor, overdone meat, poor quality dishes). There were: two salads, a host of dressings, five or six kinds of pizza- cheese, supreme, meats, hawaiian, pepperoni, bbq chicken, pasta & sauce, macaroni & cheese, garlic knots, cheese calzones, sandwich round (cut pie-style), soups, cinnamon buns, brownies, and fruit pizza. Fountain drinks station= free refills. It was very good. I sampled many items, but was trying to be careful, given my restricted diet. I want to go back again! After having this buffet, the one at CiCi's isn't so great, now.       

Part Two: Catering- 6 foot sandwich order $54.00 (including tax). This was disappointing. There was a lot of bread (very thick, especially the top piece), and not enough filling- two slices of cheese and one thin slice of roast beef, one thin slice of turkey, one thin slice of ham. Also, lots of the sandwiches were cut in quarter size pieces. Sides/condiments was shredded lettuce, very few slices of tomatoes (for a 6 ft. sandwich), mustard, and mayo. Getting Capriotti's three or four large specialty subs would have been better (cut up into small sandwiches). We thought it would be good, since we had eaten there. But no, it was not worth it. Another better option for us, we could've made our own sandwiches using Boar's Head meats and cheeses and french bread loaves. (It was a good thing we had pizzas from Domino's too, besides all the side dishes). 

So, basically the high starred review is for the restaurant side of the operation. The menu is pretty extensive; lots of other possible yummy options like Broasted Chicken. Also, there is a monster pizza challenge- posters are posted inside.

Overall, it is a clean restaurant, looks like there are lots of teams that patronize this place (as evidenced by the softball team sign-up events). It wasn't crowded for lunch, though there was an event being held there. The food in the buffet area was well-filled. The price is reasonable.

4287863,2012-02-13,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Pizza buffet!!

Since Pizza Hut buffet closed Ive been in search of a pizza buffet. This is a hidden gem by madhouse coffee. Its pretty large and has a great selection of food. My son and I opted for the lunch buffet its 6.49$ for adults and 2.49$ for children. If you want to add a soda its .99cents for kids and 1.89$ for adults unless you go during their ""happy hour"" which i already forgot what time it was haha. 

The place itself is pretty large, the tvs there are super old and placed in weird positions. Like next to the ceiling lol. Anywho on to the food.

The pizza here is meh, nothing spectacular. I liked the chicken they had, it was a nice change to just pizza and salad. They also have calzones, sandwiches, 2 different types of breads, soups, and an AMAZING selection of items on the salad bar. My def fave was the garlic knots and the salad bar. Ahhhh the knots were soooo sinful! I kept wanting more, but it all goes to my belly so I had to restrain myself. The salad bar is also delish, I love the romaine salad they offer, and I like that they allow you to put your own dressing and items on. Cicis better recogniiiiize! Haha. The sandwich was ok, dry so you need to put mayo or whatever on it. They also have desserts that werent too bad. I like how they have hot sauce for the chicken, a def plus!!

Grazianos also offers an arcade area for the kids, its pretty rad! They have a ton of games that all take tokens and once youre done you can cash in your tickets for prizes. The guy working there is seriously THE BEST CASHIER EVAR! Hes a sweet dude who actually converses with you. 

Another plus is that they always have a check in special on the Yelp app!!

We will def continue coming here for our pizza and my garlic knot addictions!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,0,4,oUA1BEYDr2zxoQBRe4ejMg

Not like the Famous Mojos!  I think its a great place if you want pizza, salad, and good chicken on an all you can eat place!",SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,2,1,4,7cx3KWbqpZnm-890iGWeCA
4612271,2013-01-24,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Graziano's does well as a casual, family-friendly restaurant. The food is very typical American-Italian fare, nothing surprising or particularly impressive, but the generous portions, smart pricing, and large menu are bound to satisfy everyone in your group. They offer great specials, and you can take advantage of many of their coupons/offers. With our Entertainment Book coupon, we ended up under $13 for dinner to-go for 4. Warm, good, predictable food. Also, it's a plus to have the comfortable, cozy seating and fun little gaming area while waiting for the orders to come out.

The staff is attentive and efficient considering the scale of the establishment, from the dine-in area to the take-out counter and the gaming area. We had issues in the gaming area, but at least they were very prompt in correcting the problems, and they were very sweet and patient with the kids in our party. 

Settling on 3, since I won't be coming back for the food myself, and will only be back if I'm with the niece and nephew on a quick family take-out run.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,1,0,3,M0_fo5_LHG_1DqCGxUz8xA

I went with #foodcrew to Graziano's to take part in the monster pizza challenge and YESSS that thing is a monster!!  There were around 30 of us at the restaurant 8 competed while the others ordered from the normal menu. The food was delicious and everyone's order was out fast even tho they had to make 4 of those huge pizzas.

Short list of delicious:
1. Garlic knot (so tasty)
2. deli calzone (yesssss!!)
3. Broasted chicken (delectable) 
4. BBQ Pizza (flavor)
5. Graziano special pizza (flava flav)

I definitely recommend that you make a stop at Graziano's",M8sicCwphozgVjJyGhTOkQ,0,0,4,ndsmutXRmobdwxf6LG9zMg

If you are a Vegas local and want a good pizza I would highly suggest you forgo this place and instead try Pizza My Dear or Grimaldi's",3yACizmvq1c4aGoa9jGxIw,0,0,1,1xuN_a0Y71pL-w6MGfuIhg
4807250,2013-05-02,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Before writing this, I need to warn you I am normally not a fan of local pizza. Honestly, I rarely see a value in it. But, after two-times dining I have decided I am a fan of The Original Graziano's Pizza. 

What makes them better? I like the lunch pizza buffet and their variety. I am on a low-calorie diet and I like that I can eat salad and soup while my boyfriend can feast on as much pizza as he wants. I tried the Pineapple pizza on the buffet, AWESOME. 

I subtracted one star... Why? You have to self-serve your own drinks and I am not a fan of having to grab my own silverware. It would be nice if they at least added napkins to all their tables. 

Before you leave, check out the wall-of-fame wall of the people who challenged the HUGE pizza.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,3,1,4,qqSlFyzjnqyZg-lEgIt6Kg

5167196,2011-09-12,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"I was having a hard time finding somewhere to eat dinner.  I originally wanted Baja Fresh since it's quick and easy to take home.  After driving up and down West Flamingo and not finding an establishment that looked decent, I remembered a friend's suggestion from a long time ago and drove to Graziano's.  

I've never had their food but was told their pasta was good.  I didn't want to spend too much money so I ordered their Spaghetti with meatballs and meat sauce.  This only cost about $5 and garlic knots.  Here's how the pasta tasted:  noodles were cooked just right - not aldente but not soggy.  It was just perfect.  The meatballs had great seasoning to it and was impressed at how good it tasted.  Now, as for the sauce it's still swimming in my mind how awesome the sauce was.  I think I've found the place for spaghetti with meatballs.  Let's see, as for the garlic knots.  I loved how it was fresh from the oven, not oily and had a lot of flavor to it.  If I wasn't so full from the pasta, I would've been able to eat it all.

I got there past 9pm and figured they would've turned me away since it was near closing time.  But, they didn't and took my order.  The person who took my order was very hospitable and easy to talk to.  He was also very personable.  Could he have been the owner?  Anyway, combined with the food and service, I would definitely pay another visit and this time try their famous pizzas.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,3,2,4,hYbN4cGj-RBCaxmYvC4i2w
5188753,2012-02-22,1,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"First off let me say this place serves BROASTED CHICKEN.  If you have ever tried it you know what I'm talking about.  It's a healthier version of fried chicken.  The meatballs were also very tasty.  Self serve drinks bonus!!  Haha.

My Nephew loves it here because of all the games they have for him.  I have to say I enjoy them too.

Where they lose a star is the pizza although tasty is still, to me, ordinary.  But I guess you can't really mess pizza up too bad.",NV6b0oTn99n8PMY5V_RAlQ,1,1,4,sFetHZyBmc12NENM1vcXrg
5199530,2011-09-16,3,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Yes, I am upgrading Graziano's to 4-stars based on two factors: value and service. Until the end of September (time is running out!) their pizza buffet is only $5.99, and it includes a drink. Even if you only eat the salad bar it is worth it, but you can also throw on a couple of chicken drumsticks and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup (one of my guiltiest, shameful food cravings). Plus, the staff here is friendly, and they really care about the restaurant. Our plates were cleared no less than three times, and each time the person who stopped by asked how our meals were with a smile. Is it the most amazing pizza in Vegas? Probably not, even though I do like the crust. Warning: The iced tea is not good at all. Still, it is well run and where else can you get all you can eat fried chicken, soup, pizza, salad, garlic knots, brownies, weird dessert pizza and giant potato wedges for $5.99? It is what it is, and they do it well.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,7,4,_2pYTlxt7QHw-nBivmYx8g
5426630,2013-01-27,0,aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ,"Closest comparison is Shakey's in Califorina. For $6.49 you get various pizza's (the best being the supreme), broasted chicken, potato wedges, soups, garlic knots, cheese stuffed bread, Italian sandwiches, pasta or Mac n cheese, salad with all the toppings (drinks not included unless you come between 2-3). Child's price 12 and under is $3.49.  Food was really tasty and for the price it was really good!!!  When we were there, there was a kid appx 4 yrs old or younger touching all the pizza but luckily a worker saw and threw out all the ones he touched (not sure where the parent was)....so I was glad about that but just imagine if the worker didn't see.....yikes! Drinks if purchased was refillable on your own and it was Pepsi products, pretty good because there was the no calorie peach tea (which we love)! All in all we were really satisfied and fed our fam of 4 for under $20! This AYCE is also everyday!!  We will be back!",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,0,4,YW_7iX5Y3xD2o6GtD3nLwg

Its time for some change so we tried Grazianos pizza. We went with a Large Grazianos special. The pizza was cooked perfect. A little bit of crispness the perfect amount of toppings and it was here rather quickly. 

I have to be honest I was expecting the same ole feel like crap feeling after eating pizza but it was not overwhelmingly heavy. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch if you are in the area.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,1,0,4,MFf7BzYuQcifUPYf0OV0Sw
