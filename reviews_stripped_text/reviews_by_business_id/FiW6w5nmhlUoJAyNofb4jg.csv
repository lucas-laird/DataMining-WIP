I asked for nutritional information and was informed it hadn't been made yet. It was disappointing to not be able to order anything. When you promote healthy foods and drinks at your business....having nutritional info is a must!  Couple positives were the place look really nice and I loved that they have a Vegas strong wall.

I love the decor on the inside, it is so refreshing, just like their acai bowls.  They have a really cool Vegas Strong painting on one of their walls and I really liked that part.

I decided to try an acai bowl and it was so good. Although it is on the pricey side, it was nothing I didn't expect because fruit bowls are always way expensive! It tasted so good. There was granola on the bottom and acai puree mix, then more granola and cut up fresh fruit on top. The fruit was a mix of bananas, strawberries, blueberries and coconut flakes on top. They put some sort of sweetener on the top, like agave syrup or something.

I would definitely go back to this place because I love the vibe on the inside and love the taste of their bowls! I felt really energized and good about what I ate afterward... and I actually enjoyed my healthy meal!!!",mu4XvWvJOb3XpG1C_CHCWA,1,0,5,rVIK1ljZ95SET63CDQmSPw

I ordered the pure bowl, all green everything cold pressed juice and a detox smoothie. The all green everything was great. The detox smoothie and the pure bowl lacked flavor and tasted like ice - there was also a huge frozen piece of something (unknown what) inside of my bowl. I paid almost $35 bucks for everything....I read other reviews about people complaining about prices. Idk, I'm willing to pay for things that I enjoy to eat. The bowl and smoothie just weren't very enjoyable to me.

1918965,2018-03-14,0,FiW6w5nmhlUoJAyNofb4jg,"After popping in to the Greek spot next door (that place is great, by the way), my wife and I went in to see what kind of smoothies Fruits and Roots had. Nothing really appealed to me which was fine, because I realized that a cold pressed juice is NINE DOLLARS. AYFKM? Girl, bye. The places you are modeling yourself after don't even charge that much. I live in the Mecca of health and wellness (Portland, OR) and this pricing wouldn't fly there. 

We ended up settling on sharing a 20oz ""strawberry mint lemonade"". Do you know what their lemonade is? It's water with some lemon squeezed in, pulverized strawberries (tops on), and mint. You know the free cucumber or lemon water you get when you check into a hotel or stop into the bank? That's literally what this is. And it is NOT good, especially for $6. They asked us if we wanted it sweetened with agave. Agave is just as refined as sugar, if not more so.  ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

A note about staff: the kid at the register was nice and pleasant and greeted us, but then proceeded to explain the menu. That's weird, because I know how to read and have been to a juice wellness place before. What these folks are selling isn't much different than any other place. Second, I guess the owner was there but he didn't greet us because probably we don't look CrossFit or paleo enough or whatever. He made sure to get up and greet the people who came after us who looked like they just came from yoga. I'm a competitive power lifter, play roller derby and do yoga 6x a week. I'm your demographic.

Their wraps and salad bowls are really yummy too. Everything is fresh that day and they source a lot of their ingredients from farms out here in Las Vegas! My favorite is build your own wrap and I add chicken, black beans, kale (which is bomb), cucumbers, micro greens, and top it with their amazing vegan ceaser dressing.

Secondly, when I order a lemonade I would love to actually have some lemons/lemon juice in there, not the essence of a lemon that maybe laid next to the strawberry that was pulverized (GREEN STEM AND ALL!) into my water. Fuh, I realize it'll taste a little different if I get it without the sweetener but I at least expected it to taste a little bit like a sour lemonade instead of left over melted ice water. 

C of all, I don't really care if your ingredients are sent over here via helicopter from the remote corners of the world, there is no reason a small container of any juice should cost $9 when you can literally get the same thing for half the price at Pressed Juicery. 

I wish I could give negative stars. But alas, here we are. If you're looking to get rid of some cash, may I suggest just burning it instead of purchasing anything here.",RQe6lwzjN3cYLjDb-PYWTQ,0,0,1,ZeNmI0AAoZPU1oIwD1e8kA

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as
we looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made.

Operational Inefficiency: super slow on preparing pre made Food into a bowl, as well as coordinating which employee plays which role (preparer, check out..)

The food is super fresh. In my two visits with my mother, I tried various dishes but my favorite is the Caesar bowl. Good ingredients, vegan dressing and a filling portion for $11! It was a few extra bucks to add chicken. 

Caffeinated drinks have the option for cashew milk. Be prepared to dish out if you get cashew milk ($9 here - this is more expensive than NYC FYI). I will say it's well worth it, since there aren't too many places with this item in the area.

I only had card for payment and they weren't able to process it due to the register being down and they told me breakfast was on them. I offered to come back and pay with cash and they told me not to worry since its issues on their end.  To the manager, keep up the good customer service and thank you for making my day!",DhYl8NcXoh47T2OO5Ki55g,0,0,5,MI6v_kK9Z8Ep-K7AVCnK_A

I ordered the Avocado Toast and it was $8. Very small piece of toast, but it was still delicious! The workers were very nice and friendly. It's a nice place to study. Not too loud, not too quiet. I would come back here again!",vIUYACQ8Zsdg02n7plrzdQ,0,0,4,KddIXJ-TL8yusYxIYBTUSg

The Vegan cheesecake is also incredibly tasty and doesn't disappoint. I've had several of there smoothies and all of them have been great. So happy they opened another location on blue diamond because it's closer to my house.,KzG_6Aq-nz0nwgisf1EdTA,0,0,5,mjgUFagCdUl6XPyzT2LaUA

They offer up the usual healthy variety with juices, smoothies, salads, and then some. The Sweet Asian salad was delicious and clean, and I love the fact they put their detox on the greens. My boyfriend, on the other hand, got the Chicken Quinoa and the chicken looked dehydrated af. So either we went on an off day or its always that dry.

The acai bowls are amazing here. The base is delicious and the toppings complement it well. Plus, they blend it up with acai fruit (rather than just the juice) so it's packed with antioxidants. Definitely recommend the Earth Bowl plus almond butter topping. 

Downsides to this place is that it's pretty pricey (on par with other similar healthy joints) and the consistency is not quite there yet. One of out of three times, the acai bowl we got just wasn't the same. It wasn't as sweet which is probably hard to control based off the fruit without using sugar additives and there was huge chunks of frozen solid smoothie not blended in.

Overall, decent health option if you're in the area ~",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,5,4,hgXjcMuaW8n1FvgAlgjsLA
