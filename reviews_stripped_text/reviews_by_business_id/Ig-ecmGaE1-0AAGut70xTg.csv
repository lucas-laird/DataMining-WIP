Almost everything is served in styrofoam containers and with plastic forks and knives. Not too sexy but I guess it saves on cleaning dishes and since the portions are big, they probably figure many people are taking left over homes anyway. 
The bartender (Jill), the server and the owner (?) where all rather cordial and friendly.
They have a separate dining room but we sat at the bar to eat and listen to the live band.

So why three stars? My friend was playing video poker at the bar and bought in for $25. She was playing pretty consistently off her winnings of a couple four-of-a-kinds for the several hours we were there. When the bill came we noticed only one drink was comped. We were told by Jill that their policy is one comped drink for every $20 buy in. Many places we go to comp drinks based on time / amount played.
I would expect that sort of nickle and diming from an MGM property, not from a local bar and grill.
The price for a white wine was $5 so not as damaging as the $9 you would pay at MGM but the point is...

Anyway, they do have many tv screens and said they will be playing all the football games so we may head back.",Q0Z2lhB7fHNNldEhl8l3PA,2,1,3,X8dDhyVpqWf3C5QZMvk3Hg

I liked their menu geared toward Asian/Hawaiian flavors like musubi or saimin, plus typical bar & grill offerings like fries for example. Portions were generous and the menu prices were reasonable. The servers and food runner provided cordial and attentive service.

I would have given Barefoot Bar & Grill more stars except that their playing comp policy wasn't disclosed up front. Their policy, as I learned AFTER getting the bill, is that $20 played earns one drink. Although I put $25 in, in the 3 hours I was there to hear a friend's band play, I played through much more than my initial investment due to the machine being loose enough to afford me the replay. 

I mentioned to them it was my first visit here. If the comp policy was stated in the beginning, I would have reset my expectations. Not every bar in town follows this policy.

Overall, great food and service, but just be advised of their comp rules.",Z1g3_X8wTyTsRsTuEDv2qA,2,1,3,RVSZdHw-SpgtmvcoX7pVoQ

Barefoot the latest occupant has live music and I have seen Billy Ray n the Boyz and the Moanin Black Snakes over the past couple of weeks.  Their statement of Great Atmosphere, Food, Cold Drinks, Hot Slots and Absolutely Great Entertainment seems accurate so far.",cAY_gYiIq68RkWhLennaKw,2,1,4,BARiVbcmWtBIswK2tViRMg
