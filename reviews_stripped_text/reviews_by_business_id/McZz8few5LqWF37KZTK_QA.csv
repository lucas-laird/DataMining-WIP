Our waiter was VERY nice. Out drink orders were placed in a timely manner and quickly followed with our food order. I had the pasta with a red cream sauce and sausage. Delicious. I want more right now just thinking about it. My boyfriend and friend both got the special that night, pasta with shrimp and scallops. My boyfriend still cant stop talking about how wonderful his dish was. Another ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and said it was good, but nothing special. My other friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and said it was one of the best meals he has ever had. Also we were brought three different kinds of breads and we had oil for dipping on the table. 

We did not dine on any dessert since we were stuffed from a fabulous dinner. We will be coming here again on our next trip to Vegas. SO YUMMY!",WKvYyQtnpDwnNeyVbO4Fsg,0,0,5,OWMZj42lp9fkGwhoxYxcqw

This time, I was ""coereced"" into going by a friend b/c it was convenient and b/c the Burger Bar next door was crowded.  I conceded b/c I was starving and out of my mind from hunger.

But I have to say I'm glad we ate there!  We both ordered the rigatoni w/fresh tomatos and mozzarella.  The tomatos were so tender and flavorful, and the mozz just melting into the dish was heaven!

I really was shocked everything was so good.  I gave it 4 stars b/c no respectable Italian joint should be serving butter with their bread.  Where's the olive oil folks?",97VE7yPbzssyZMzh4LXrvA,0,0,4,nX_KW2O5l0QK7rz_z8UPMA

When the server left us sitting at our table for a good 20 minutes before menus, water or a perfunctory greeting was dispersed, we should have taken that as a sign to cut bait and head next door to Burger Bar.  Yelping, or even thinking really, about this meal and restaurant is getting me so angry I will stop my description of the meal there.

The restaurant is the the Mandalay Bay shopping mall.  My husband and I split two appetizers and one main dish.  We started with the shrimp scampi and steamed clams.  Both were very good.  The clams were small but the wine sauce was done to perfection.  The shrimp in the scampi tasted very fresh and they were big.  The garlic, lemon & butter sauce was scrumptious.  For our main dinner we split the pasta with meat sauce.  No complaints and it was rich and hardy.   So for the price the food was above par but I only gave them three stars, because.......

Negative - the service was terrible.  No one came over to offer more water or to check on us and I could see staff (5-6) just standing around the front check in desk.  So after we got our food and ate, we waited and waited for the check.  Our waiter wouldn't make eye contact.  It was a bit annoying but we weren't in a big rush.

I was leery at first simply because of Giorgio's location: it's effectively in a ""mall."" We were promptly seated and our orders came farily quickly. The bitter greens salad (radicchio, endive, arugula and shaved parmesan) was great, as were the Insalata Caprese and butternut squash ravioli. The waiter was even able to accomodate a special request for fresh fruit as a dessert -- the raspberries tasted like they had been picked just minutes prior!

I just turned 21 and I was extremely excited about ordering a mojito from a super fancy restaurant...But alas, after all the hype from rum commercials, movies flashing the pretty long glass with crushed mint leaves at the bottom in my face, friends raving about how deliciously awesome it is, I'm presenting with a beer cup full of sugar water, soda, uncrushed mint leaves and a normal straw (as opposed to two super thin straws that normally parallel the cup that the drink is in). This experience is only equal to being promised a super hansom rich prince from far away, only to see that he has arrived in a t-shirt and a pair of jeans.  No...No...I don't feel sorry about taking that star away. 
Ya know what the sad part is..? It had a beer logo on the cup...



Okay enough about the drink, onto the super awesome broccoli! I ordered the veal in a white wine sauce with capers with the vegetable side and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The broccoli was deliciously buttery and garlicky that that was all I ate. The veal was superb, don't get me wrong, but the broccoli out shined it hands down x3 I'd go back for the broccoli if I could get a big bowl of it.

2852925,2009-09-04,0,McZz8few5LqWF37KZTK_QA,"At first glance, this place would seem to be a decent place to eat without all the fanfare that is vegas. However this place was a big let down.

First, the service was horrible. The bussers and other assistants did their job well, but the waiter himself was inattentive. After we placed our order we noticed that we had a choice between fries or vegetable. He just chose french fries.. LAME.. We ordered mixed drinks which were ok, but never asked us for refills. It was almost like going to Denny's to eat, except at Denny's, they ask you what option you would pick for your order!

Now the food. It was blah.. nothing great. Again, i chose the sampler since it went so well at Piamma's... For a salad i had cantaloupe with prosciutto. It was terrible. I love prosciutto and mixed the cantaloupe it was good, but they gave me about 1/2 lb of prosciutto with the pieces of cantaloupe. The plate looked like a bowl of prosciutto and the cantaloupe was buried underneath. Also, i noticed that the ""cook"" attempted to cut the cantaloupe into pieces but stopped midway.. what the hell was that?

My steak was cooked they way i wanted and it was seasoned ok. However, i noticed that one of my dining partners order her steak medium and she instead got it medium rare.. the same color as mine. Whatever. The creme-brule was forgettable and bite size.

Giorgio saved the day and my tired feet. The Burger Bar next door was jumpin' but Giorgio seated us right away and we immediately felt 1000 miles away from the bustle of the Mandalay Place mall. The server came right away and was relaxed and accomodating--he brought my husband's beer and my stiff and yummy rocks margarita quick style. The bread basket with foccacia and sourdough was plentiful. My turkey sandwich and salad were satisfying and reasonably priced, especially after paying stupidly high prices for bad service and lame wanna be gourmet at Circo.

I would go to Giorgio again in a heartbeat. The service was excellent--not too fussy, but present, the food just hit the spot and the prices were damned reasonable, especially for Vegas.",rbNmNOG3iKkE6XiGSEw8mg,0,0,5,3ldCPtlGK1yih_6VEYc0sw

I went with the Pappardelle and added a meatball...oven dried tomatoes, ground sausage, basil and a touch of cream( http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/vbrJDAVvrKm_r_IHeVqiGQ/l ).  The noodles had a good chewy consistency and the sauce was quite tasty.  The pasta was really filling.  I only ate a little more than half the dish, and then I made myself stop.

Champagne was flowing, so that's always a good thing. I can forgive a lot if I'm drinking the bubbly.

The starter was a margherita pizza. It was kind of meh, but not offensive.

Next up was a salad which was very good. It was composed of arugula, radicchio and some other greens. It was peppery, had a nice bite to it, and the perfect amount of dressing.

I wish I'd stopped after the salad and the champagne but unfortunately the main course was yet to be served. We had a choice of salmon or chicken marsala and since I'm not a salmon lover, I chose the chicken.

I'll preface this by saying that I make an excellent chicken marsala, but I tried to keep an open mind. The sauce contained no discernible mushrooms. Aren't mushrooms a main component of this dish? And the sauce was black. Not brown, not dark brown, but black. It tasted like that horrible ""Kitchen Bouquet"" seasoning that bad cooks use. On the side were overcooked, greasy vegetables.

I only had 2 bites and decided to cut my losses, down more champagne and focus on the joy of the occasion and not the food.",WN3FQ5lNz5q8FFbeH42OxQ,6,5,2,8-K_SWiLrhbAW-zzjSZ3jg

We had reservations at 5:30pm, because we were going to see the Lion King right after dinner (the theater was right downstairs). We were seated right next to the busboy station (three busboys were standing there talking) and were IGNORED for a good 15 minutes. No water, no bread, no greeting, NOTHING. I noticed a guy sitting at the bar, and later discovered that this dude was actually our waiter! He decided to approach our table just in time because we both agreed we were going to get up and hop over to the BurgerBar next door if somebody didn't approach our table soon. We probably should have gone anyway, but we didn't. 

As for the food, it was nothing spectacular. I started with a caprese salad before my meal. It was edible, but not delicious. The mozzarella did not taste fresh, and there was barely any basil. Not something I'd recommend. My husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and I ordered the eggplant parmesan. He said his fettuccine was pretty good. The eggplant parmesan was just ok. It was tasty, but too greasy.

Pasta here is very YUM!

The bread and butter they bring out is also pretty bomb. Then again, at this point in my life, any type of CARB is BOMB!!!

I ordered the caprese salad and the papardelle with sausage and tomato cream sauce. I was REALLY impressed! Because the restaurant wasn't that pricey as the other places we had gone, I expected the quality to be much lower. But the pasta was wonderful! The tomatoes aren't in season now and weren't that great, but the mozzarella in the salad plus a little balsamic vinegar made it much better.

On the first night in Vegas I noticed this restaurant in the shoppes area in Mandalay Bay. I had been to this hotel before and eaten at the ""Burger Bar"" but never noticed this quaint little restaurant. I asked my girl if she'd want to eat there. We actually tried to make it in on our second night there, but they weren't seating anymore so we decided to try again on the next night. Let me start off by saying that the food here is good, really good for the price. I liked how it wasn't packed and it wasn't loud. It was more of the kind of restaurant I'm used to eating at. Not refined in anyway but more...comfortable. Feels like I'm sitting down to eat with my Sicilian family at our favorite restaurant back home, which is gone now.
