616044,2015-06-26,1,XBIaV-NJ-OxyAd_rsiBr2A,I didn't place an order here because this location does not participate in the normal Burger King promotions such as the 2 sandwiches for $5 or the deals offered through the Burger King smartphone app.  There are several better Burger King's located a short distance from this one.,0vaHSbaRk2CsldclYO54vw,1,1,1,oz8Z3NN9178tUp4myr46Yg
1154993,2018-06-09,0,XBIaV-NJ-OxyAd_rsiBr2A,Went there and the drive thru was closed for some reason. Went inside and only saw 2 people working and 5 or 6 people waiting for food. Left and went to the one on Vegas Blvd just a skip away. There I got what tasted like a 4 hour old whopper. This is absolutely unacceptable Burger King!,oDUWXui3dzGtU2bnsrLz-g,0,0,1,Y7SvtroGeIZpysauWOplbA

2297813,2017-03-11,0,XBIaV-NJ-OxyAd_rsiBr2A,This place seriously needs to be remodeled.   The seats are torn.  And could use a very cleaning.  Plus there prices are higher than other Burger King restaurants.  Much better to walk across the road and go to In and Out or McDonald's.,GtiUVfth9qmd-U8fC_RdBw,0,1,2,oCs1fVPXQkul_UGe8mnqmg

Great quality for a fast food place. .it seem to be going down hill everywhere else ..but not here everything was hot and fresh and the cashier was very welcoming she greeted us with a nice smile and a hello. Thanks!,baCER6Oo5rMVK9ruvVjL4w,0,0,5,GmUwODEbhK6N1YmsEnDTaQ
3457881,2018-01-14,0,XBIaV-NJ-OxyAd_rsiBr2A,"Not a franchise Burger King. They don't have specials and charge you twice as much as the one half a mile away. They are constantly out of stock of something every time I go. They don't take any Burger King coupons.  Besides not being able to stick their food they sell, the burgers taste like crap and the fries taste like tacos because they share with a taco time restaurant. Oh and can someone tell me why the hell I have to pull forward to receive my order when there's no one behind me. Oh that's right because they want their drive thru times to not be crap. NEVER go here unless you want shit food and crap service. 

Update: Month later, went to purchase a whopper meal, price on the drive thru menu showed one price but when I pulled up to window they said it was .30 more. I told them the board said this price and they looked at their inside board and disagreed. I told them they could get out and look at their drive thru board as it was listed at not the price your stating.  The attendant looked at me blankly and asked what she should do. I said to not steal from people would be great.  So watch out for these scumbags! Now they steal.",zZBF1oAb9LdvSx2Ehb-LNA,0,0,1,2rjwzuxU_21dRg-PuhwEQA

Multiple people were complaining how long their order was taking (course, they waited until after I ordered to start complaining).  This is a privately owned franchise, prices are high and no specials.  The whole outside of the building is under construction at the moment.",KxL2Z4YK1I3QBvhw9FnnUw,0,0,1,Hx9F2USsXpdIroXyyJX9Nw
