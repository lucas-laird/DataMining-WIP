The menu has a lot of choices for a ramen restaurant and they serve Yakisoba as well.

I tried the kimchee miso ramen, where they stir fry the kimchee and chashu together before adding to the ramen. I really liked the flavor, but I will need to try my favorite staple, shoyu ramen in the future

When I try the shoyu ramen next time I will be able to compare and contrast this place with others around town.

The noodles didn't seem harder than other ramen places, and I like the noodles better at Monta. 

However, this place is not crowded, roomy, and much closer to my home.  I will come back here for sure!

The gyoza was fresh and apparently it is made daily.. As well as the Kim Chee. 

I hope others find and try this place as it is pretty good.",fMwtpqJPWNH2WpCgWb2Sxg,0,0,4,eqw52EN03K32Fynz1RQN2Q

653849,2016-05-22,0,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"I tried out this new ramen place as it was closer to my place that my usual spot. It was an alright experience at best, it did the job of filling me up. To start, the broth was weak and tasted watered down, I had to add hot sauce and spices to give it at least a hint of flavor. The noodles were too chewy for me and the chashu pork was not tender at all and lacked flavor. Lastly, the egg was straight hard boiled and and the yolk was dry. On the bright side however the chicken katsu was good. The only thing that would bring me back here is if I'm feeling too lazy again to drive to Jinya.",WcJAdTpJ3IKa9blCvYyr9A,0,0,3,XmQ1tjtUaxqzJ8U6L7I7yQ

1645721,2016-03-26,10,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"New player in the Vegas ramen wars! Unfortunately, not up to par. Prices are pretty fair though, about $10/bowl with generously-sized apps and sides. 

Noodles are chewy and on the thicker side, but there's more to ramen than noodles.  Broth was weak and watered down. The egg was straight-up hard boiled, it even had a gray ring around the yolk; unacceptable. If you can't do it well, don't do it at all. Bowl featured a mix of meats, none of which had much flavor- house made meat ball was bland and unremarkable.

 Mochiko chicken was closer in execution to karaage chicken but a little greasy and bland.  DIY a quick sauce using the soy, sriracha, and togarashi at the table. 

Mediocre meal leaves me disinclined to make a future visit. Menu also offers a variety of rice dishes and bowls. Service was polite, space has not changed decor since previous ownership.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,10,2,MOPnoAsykiznEPjCiom2og

The food was as fresh as it gets, the place is immaculate and the service was top notch, warm and friendly. We had the home made gyoza, which was disarmingly delicious, as was the sauce. All too often, gyoza, pot stickers and the like are straight out of the freezer in all too many restaurants, These were superb, flavorful and absolutely fresh (made daily) as can be. We had the seafood fried udon. We were surprised at how wonderfully vibrant the flavors were.... superb flavors. We finished it off with mochi ice cream, which is vanilla ice cream in a solid sticky rice powder. It was like an ice cream cookie and it was the first time I ever ate ice cream with a fork. The owners are certainly doing it the right way. I will always support family owned restaurants that care deeply about the quality of the food they are serving over any chain.

2028130,2016-01-13,5,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"3.5 stars. This place just opened up about a month ago and I think they are still fine tuning things. There is plenty of seating inside. Maybe the largest interior space of any ramen place I've seen in Las Vegas. But does that translate into good food? Just looking at the menu, they seem to have some interesting things. Not just ramen. There are some good appetizers, and Asian entrees as well, such as Katsu Curry rice. 
Speakng of which, I tried their Chicken Katsu Ramen. Interesting. It came out very flat tasting. But next to you, there is a selection of condiments you can add such as Hot Oil to control your spiciness level to your liking, salt so you can make it taste like MSG as much as you want, and even Sriracha sauce. So I think the flatness was intentional because everyone has different tolerances and you can suit your own liking. 
The chicken katsu was fine. Nothing so awesome. But my whole meal was $8.65 so I can't complain. I will be back to try other items such as their Mochiko Chicken, of which I heard the next table go ape-shit over, and of course, I have to try their curry.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,9,6,3,yEua8SqcNmbxMeJ7CT2VWA

They offer large portions for a reasonable price.  Cliff C mentioned that they are still fine tuning things ... maybe he should try again. I think they have it down.

I had the chashu ramen and it was ok. Chashu was over done. The egg was waaayyyy over. The egg yolk edge was even green. The noodles were actually nice. Broth nothing too great, but can be doctored with the condiments.
Tempura shrimp A+ so good! Fresh.
Kashu chicken A. Pretty basic, but well done.
Gyoza A+++++ Best gyoza I've had! Yummm

I was craving ramen on a gloomy day so I called this place for delivery and they were able to get a driver out to me even though I was not within their delivery zone. Because I was so thankful I was very generous to the delivery guy. 

The ramen was very delicious. I ordered the kimchi miso ramen and the yakisoba noodle. Being a strict vegetarian in Las Vegas it's rare to find a restaurant that serves ramen where the kitchen will accommodate for a custom order of a non-meat based soup if it's not on the menu. Also their portions are huge and the price is unbeatable. 

I'm so glad I found this place will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and the next time I'm craving ramen will be dining here.",uyB27ThcwC2KR-G5qWlsHw,0,0,5,PtI1jx1QQSB4LW3FL1RNgQ
3837755,2016-02-22,2,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"We walk in on a Sunday around 3:00. We're the only people inside and the owners are sitting at the table with what I assume are their kids. Usually, I'd be skeptical. However the kids were well behaved and the service was great. She was on top of our drinks and dishes, and even offered good alternatives to sauces that they did not have.

Personally, the food was perfect. I ordered the Chef's Special Ramen. The home-made meat balls and fish cake were amazing. The flavors were all there. Threw in a little Sriracha for spice and it was perfect. 

Fianc√© had the Chicken Katsu Ramen. Just as great. Friends had the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice. They said the curry was ""okay"", but the Katsu itself was amazing. Nothing critical, it wasn't bad...they'd just had better curry around Vegas (we're a little spoiled food-wise). 

Overall, great experience. Portions are pretty large, which was pleasantly surprising. Enough to take home and have later. They were all very kind and the atmosphere is very warm and insanely clean. The menu is pretty simple, which is a pretty good sign in my opinion. The food was absolutely delicious. Crunchy bean sprouts, tender meats, flavorful broth, and decent curry. 

Loved it. Plan to make this my go-to ramen place.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,3,3,5,r4Z9p4CpzxmaCtIjmnY0sw
3882881,2016-01-09,1,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"My parents and I ordered the Chef's special ramen, curry ramen, and miso ramen. 

Out of the 3, I like the curry ramen the best. It was the most flavorful and had the best spices in the soup. The noodle to soup ratio was perfect, but I wish there was more substance - whether it be more vegetables or more meat. Something about the meal felt missing. Aside from that, the service was quick and we got our food within 10 minutes. The prices are decent, about $8 and up per bowl. 

Personally, there are better ramen places in town like Monta Ramen or Ramen Sora that have a more milky, unique tasting broth.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,5,5,3,OXa7hSuPbvN4pFI0_9Dp2A

3943218,2016-01-20,0,nvisKK8rLsGonRIvGCttUQ,"KEY WORDS: PORTIONS AND BROTH!! 

This place serves the largest Ramen portions in town! This is a big deal for me because whenever I order a bowl of ramen, I can never get full. This place knows how to serve it and serve it big. 

Most Ramen places serve very salty and dense broth. It will either be tasteless or make me feel like having a heart attack after. This is not the case here. I don't understand how they can make the broth so light and savory at the same time. You can literally taste the years of experience from the chef. 

The other speciality of this place are the rice dishes. It's  a nice change seeing a Ramen place serve great rice bowls and tasty fried rice. This is a big plus since some of my family doesn't like Ramen. 

This restaurant is owned and operated by a lovely wife and husband with two kids. Not only can you enjoy Ramen, but every time you eat here, you're supporting a family's dream.

When we walked in this place was pretty dead, I'm guessing because this place is kinda new and in a hidden spot. 

I really liked how small and simple their menu is- so that you aren't sitting there for 10 minutes figuring out what you want. 

I ended up getting the Wakame Ramen which has Wakame Seaweed, Bean Sprouts, and corn. Just a heads up this doesn't come with any meat- which the server did inform me. When I took my first bite I felt a little disappointed because the broth was a little bland. But the textures of everything together with the nicely cooked ramen was a perfect combo. 

I will be back here again though because the server was really sweet and I really want to see these mom and pop shops succeed. I wish them the best of luck in the future.",BkWhiifV55jvhOAV-3rdOA,0,0,4,_5SBrp_nm8MGYfq5YByVFg
