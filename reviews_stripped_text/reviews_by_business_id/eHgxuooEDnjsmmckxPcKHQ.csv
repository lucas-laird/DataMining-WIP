Regardless, I had a long day without food so I basically went for the first restaurant I saw in Rio. I ordered the duck noodle soup because it did not sound that bad. I thought the duck was actually alright the skin was crispy and there was actually a large portion of duck on my noodles. However, a lot less could be said for the noodles. The noodles were so dry and hard.. not fresh noodles at all more like instant ramen texture. Considering I paid 10 bucks for it they could at least use fresh noodles? Anyway I say skip this place unless you are desperate like I was.",HeTqkQClXiWtV2ePaj1fSA,0,0,2,UqEdtoonLb2BELqC-poitw

We were defeating the system as we purchased a mini Heinekin keg @ the on site ""one stop shop"" in the Rio. Beer filled Starbucks cups in hand- we walked around the casino and finally planted our butts @ the food-court like area right next to the sports betting. 

Perfect!

Brew, the Lakers game, and a few steps from some grub. I hovered back and forth from the two choices and Mah Jong won (but not by much). A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. 

Highlights & Low-lights:

*Pricey but think about where you are
*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix
*Pork itself was good but overly fatty
*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well
*Service was middle of the road 
*Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasure

Yes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food. Would I go back? Maybe if I were staying in the Rio again and had my fill of Buffet madness. 

Not bad but not tooo good either!!",HipNu3vK_MSJ-IIGsKFbfg,11,5,2,BdIUcfETqBfVSEgOrPy3cw
2636729,2011-08-24,1,eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ,"The food smelled soo delicious when I got there. I ordered wonton noodle soup with the egg noodles. I had high hopes.

I was promptly let down. The egg noodles weren't chewy at all. They were overcooked and soggy. The wontons were obviously store bought from 99 ranch or the likes and probably the cheapest kind you can find. There were meager servings for Chinese cabbage in it, and it was overcooked and not crunchy on the inside. And don't get me started on the broth, er i mean the water that they passed as soup. There was no flavor at all. I would have expected a place that has a great""international buffet"" to have a somewhat decent  ""Cantonese"" food.

Perhaps I'm being too harsh. Perhaps I expect too much. I want my 9 dollars back. Not only it was 9 dollars, but it was served in a crappy ass plastic bowl and the nastiest kind of chopsitcks you can find (which I had to ASK FOR- they gave me a fork!) Did i also mention NO WHITE PEPPER? You aren't a true Cantonese place without it! 

Thank you Mah Jong for ruining my favorite dish.",y9UlCZbRv-qG0W2pYSD0kg,0,0,1,N9okFHMxvl3DAZvc8P54gA
2942684,2011-08-18,0,eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ,"Not sure how to rate since this is Las Vegas but if I visited this place near me it would be 2 stars.

My meal only cost around $9.00 and could feed two people. I didn't have the time to go elsewhere since I was at a convention at the Rio 

I got what I thought was three broccoli stems with two shiktakki mushroom caps and a few shreds of carrot with a (Maybe) fried slightly crispy block of tofu with slightly hard rice on the side but after eating more I discovered this might be Chinese broccoli because of the ONE leaf I discovered.

The sauce was mild and flavorless and the steamed white rice was hard and crunchy.

The Chinese broccoli steams were very hard to cut with the plastic forks they give you here and the sauce was too mild to enjoy. 

But for a Casino this was extremely low priced and maybe better to some people. It was low priced but would go elsewhere If we had the time. It will do in a pinch.",V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,2,0,2,ueqx9hGYHk8OqTSfURDQ9w
3465466,2011-04-20,0,eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ,"For a place at a decent casino ran by Chinese people, you would think it would be pretty delicious.  It was actually pretty plain.

Had a chance to taste shrimp pad thai (I know, pad thai at a Chinese place?), chow fun, and sweet and sour pork.  I've had things taste better at a Panda Inn.  

Their versions of Pad Thai and Chow Fun were not good examples of how to cook noodles.  Both were on the chewy side.

I usually like any kind of sweet and sour pork, but they were on the salty gooey side.  I don't know why I went back to try other items at this place, I should have known by the way they cook noodles.  I won't be back.",niaemMbZsESYcefRunLwsg,0,0,3,jlYYroFXI3dg-N-cA7kvhA
3569536,2010-08-04,1,eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ,"So when you are in Vegas and you need some thing before you start drinking the night away, think about getting chinese food. Why chinese food? I have this theory that the greasy the food the better the alcky doesnt soak in your stomach. haha! The first night we got there we were in a rush to head out to XS, so we stopped down here since we were staying at the Rio. 

The prices for the dishes range around 10-12 dollars for the main dishes. You might think these prices are steep but its family style and the portions are pretty big! We had the general chicken which came with a bowl of rice, and chow fun. Everything was nicely cooked and not over seasoned which I came to the conclusion that there probably wasnt MSG in the meal which is always a bonus. They have a full stock of condomints: soy sauce, sriracha, garlic chili sauce, hot mustard, sweet sour sauce and many more. I also liked that the cooks in the back were old chinese guys so you know the food has to be sorta legit hahaha.  The last night there we had the food again, this time me and my gf split the hot and sour soup and the Singapore noodles. Now that I look at the pictures of the duck, I should of ordered that too.",aGgNm24n_jpgD52nhbJiHw,0,0,3,xvDgFPFIUETpA0TwWyRN8w

It's not only Chinese - they have Thai and Vietnamese items... which I refused to try. I'm not a fan of Chinese food outside of Chinatown and SGV. We only came here because fast and easy.

I got a BBQ pork plate - $6.88 and it comes with NO rice. The cucumbers taste horrible in it too. It's a small plate too. Very expensive for what you get.

Notes:
* It's actually made by Asians tho (saw them cooking in the back)
* fast
*expensive

You pick up your order when your number is called. Food is served in plastic bowls and plates with plastic utensils (wooden chopsticks though). Prices are high considering the fast food ambiance, but still well worth it.

I started with really good spring rolls. Then when I saw the size of my main course, I thought twice about finishing my appetizer. The duck soup was  piled high with crispy, fatty duck pieces. Underneath was a delicious soup full of egg noodles. I washed it down with a Tsingtao beer. 

A confession: when I was done, I didn't bus my table like I would at McDonalds- after all, this is Las Vegas.",qw6w0dLPA6miMjcCAWc7BQ,0,0,4,NQMY6bHegLGDa1SNx9ILRQ

I ordered the duck plate and descended to my happy place. The duck was cooked to perfection, it sat atop a bed of white rice & baby bok choy, with some pickled carrots & cucumbers. I had a hard time deciding between the duck or BBQ pork w/egg noodle soup, both are equally delicious. I decided to try something new and it was fantastic.

4385757,2011-01-06,1,eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ,"Being that this place is inside the RIO, I'd say that they have a pretty captive audience - especially late at night. That being said, its still a decent little spot to eat at if you are staying here. I ended up staying at the Rio on some comped nights for the new years so I found myself here in need of some food to soak up the alcohol in the system late at night. Had tried a few different things from this place. The braised oxtail was good - but not nearly as good as the oxtail soup from the California casino in downtown - anyone who has eaten that late night, knows what I am talking about. One of the best anywhere. The Yang chow fried rice is really good and if you have some other dishes with rice already... getting the bbq pork without rice is a great option - its like twice as much to get it with rice! 

The only consideration is that if you are mobile and have a car... you are right near a huge Chinese food area on spring mountain road where you can get more bang for your buck. Then again... when you are in a casino, you already know that you are going to pay a little more and hopefully you have gambled enough to get some free food comps. 

Don't look for anything too fancy here... It's really like a cafeteria where you order and pick up your food and go sit down at an empty table to eat afterward.",mOeYi3nEDnGhnD-oPedhjQ,2,2,3,_PpbjQXP6DsY_U0KOkQ_Ng

To my surprise, the noodles are pretty legit. Definitely more expensive than I'm used to (holla at some $3 won ton mein!) but FAR better than what I expected for late nite casino eats. The duck noodles were satisfying considering I got about a third of a duck, a nice helping of choy and noodles that only seemed to expand as I ate.

But you don't have to leave the hotel if you are staying here, so that is the convenience... the yellow noodles were just okay, i liked the pho a lot better, and I was very surprise they are very generous with their portions, so generous that the 2nd time we went back, we had to request for less noodles and more broth.. the noodle soups here are loaded with lots of noodles, lots of meat and beef balls which is great since you get a lot for what you pay for.  I would definitely recommend sharing because they are big portions..Only thing I didn't like was the crappy bowl that it came in...It was too flimsy and hard to eat...Definitely a great spot to come to cure hangovers if you are staying at the Rio..",FCGCxiXBrj1p_8cscTeQXg,0,0,4,0wNn55A5T5m_gljYcJEleg

This is Food Court style, not a sit-down full service place. It is quite expensive for this format, even more expensive than many sit down restaurants.  Example: $10 for noodle, duck soup (skimpy portions).

The food is good, portions are small. With other choices in the area, I would skip on eating here again. Go across the street to Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast.",DKdttAvXagfAfNFIKeApuw,2,0,3,yZY9_Q084CUVdND8h5AVRA

The fried flounder, fried rice, and any of the meats or poultry from their Chinese BBQ selection (particularly the pork and the duck) is outstanding. You can't go wrong with any of the aforementioned entrees. Yes, the price is a bit expensive compared to, say, Panda Express, but its high quality and is located in a casino so its expected. Their condiments area is well-stocked and clean. Free soda refills = :)

Its located next to the sports bar too if you like Chinese food as a comfort food.",s7XUDb3zT-7u1_5lySqvKg,1,1,5,cMmhJo2qC6GzTEUcKw8PZg

We ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup which was pretty good.  We also ordered the Dan Dan Noodle - it was only OK.  

You can ask for cups and get your own water from the pop machines.  Sure saves some $ that way.  Better still, order a cheap drink from the casino and then bring the drink to your table.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,0,0,3,tqOxXB6v02Z-XGXkz4puVg
