As this was the closest and on the way to Hoover Dam, we decided to stop by here. The food was terrible and I don't remember  any dish worth mentioning here.  It was a buffet and not a single dish was tasty enough for the second serving.  The only manageable one was chicken Tikka masala.

35474,2016-03-27,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I was excited to eat at this restaurant. But, honestly the food was just okay. I opted for the Pre-Fixed menu because according to Mint Indian Bistro, these dishes are supposedly their most 'popular' dishes. I was disappointed by the soup starter. I had two scoops of it and was done with it. The fried veggie appetizer was decent,  but nothing great. 

Then the entrees came. The two meat dishes were good. I believe one was a chicken dish, the other was the lamb. The other vegetable entrees were forgettable and bland. The rice was plain and nothing to brag about. And I chose the garlic naan, which was dry. They don't brush it with any ghee to add an extra layer of flavor. Just chopped garlic on a dry naan. 

The dessert was almost inedible. I chose the round 'doughnut' hole thing that was swimming in a pool of butter and something sweet, maybe it was honey, which in theory sounds pretty good, but it's like eating a soggy sock soaked in sweet butter. After spending $65 with tip (had a $5 indian beer), I felt like I was massively ripped off. Also, if you are hungry, the portions for the pre-fixed for two is quite small, in my opinion.

I've honestly had much better indian food in Hawaii. If anyone ever visits Oahu island. There is a small hole in the wall called Cafe Maharani. The food is amazing, but just keep in mind the wait can be horrendous, so call in your name (to put you on the list as you make your way there) or order take out to avoid the (often) 2 hour wait. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Marsala, Shrimp Do Piazza, Cheesy Garlic Naan, well any Naan. The saffron rice. Well, any of their flavored rice. And, any of their creamy lamb dishes. 

I was also super bummed that our server was inattentive. Our water glasses went empty for a significant amount of time in between the meal and each set of food app/entrees/desserts were delivered by the bus boys. Our server only took our order and then brought our check. 

They were slightly busy, but no where near a 2 hour wait. There was only one party waiting to be seated when we were leaving, so I just felt like more effort could have been made to providing better service.",f9v_i9HV2iI1m0Dy29yKjg,2,0,2,023XLglnAigyRYw1RsG-2g

After looking at the yelp score on this restaurant we decided to visit it for buffet and ended up with a major disappointment. 

If you don't want to experience below, DON'T visit this restaurant:
- Inferior food quality - Most of the food items had poor preparation and lacked taste.
- Poor selection of food items 
- Low hygiene - the place didn't look clean. The floor was dirty and I could notice food particles lying down the floor at several places.

head there for happy hour (can't remember the exact time) and enjoy the two for one beer prices.  they have a diverse selection from around the world, including some great belgian-style ales as well as a couple of organic brews.  or try the ginger energy tea....just the thing to pick you up.

**edit 4/10/09....the place in under new management...wasn't happy w/ the food or service the last time i was there (hard to get them to make it hot nemore).  i know they have a different chef than when i gave my first review....will give it another shot, but it isn't the same place as it was

***edit 6/1/09...went again last friday.  food was lackluster....not bad, but not at all what it was.  sad that the place that used to have awesome flavor and spice served me two bland entrees.  would drop it to two stars if it didn't have a decent price....and one of my friends did like one of the two things she got.

Perhaps even better than any place in the bay area. We were in Vegas for 3 days, and ended up going to the same place on each of the 3 nights for dinner! I tried the Handi Biryani. They ask for spice level (from 0 to 10!), and I actually noticed a difference in spiciness corresponding to what you order. I ordered 10 and the food was pretty spicy. (spicy = good :)). They also have an ""Inferno biryani"" which is supposedly so spicy that you have to sign a waiver to order it. The waiter discouraged us from having that and I obliged.  You don't want to risk losing a night in Vegas , right? :) The place is quiet on the one weekday we went, and was pretty packed on both the weekends.",O5lBXerxVQRqP-cOXWUAtQ,0,0,5,MOXuS9yro6eIVweKzoS0rw

All that said it is a really nice place.  Very attractive; tasty food and best beer selection I have every since in an Indian restaurant including some Indian beers I had never seen before and the one I ordered was quite good.

260869,2013-03-24,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"One star, and there's good reason for it.

Visited Mint today. I love Indian food. I grew up on middle eastern, Pakistani, and Indian food. The food here is NOT Indian, it's Indian made for American taste buds. Yaddaddaimean? But let's get down to the *critiQUE.*

Service:
There hasn't been a single time that I have come here, in which I have felt comfortable walking through the door. It's always a depressed / emotionally challenged man who takes us to our seat. Water, at first, is there quickly. Refills are scarce to none. We wait 5-10 minutes for the check every time. Never half-a-smile cracked by the server(s)...and everyone who works here looks, plain, miserable. 

Food:
I'm a huge curry fan, and a huge goat fan. Both of these are garbage, here, and this is why: all curry tastes the same, jus different levels of spicyness. The goat is terribly undercooked, chewy, and has NO FLAVOR (as everything else, here, is flavor-less). Today was the last straw. There was hair in my food. Done. I don't pay money for hair.

After the fact:
Ive been feeling like crap all day. Stomach is not right. I am unbelievably, and strangely fatigued. I regret this.

There's nothing here for me. I don't trust this place's discipline in cleanliness at all! I don't trust that it ""matters "" to them until they get caught and shut down! (which they already have, as far as I've heard, for sanitation) they're here for the quick buck. It seems that There's no ""moral standard"" in this business.",RVOLw6Vw0S8IcSDdJq8lqQ,2,0,1,zuILSc5HuTTd-LwkUJgUOA

They always start you off with free (and yummy) papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Their mango lassis are soooo good and the lychee lassi that my husband randomly tried one day was pretty tasty as well. 

I'm boring and always order the same thing: saag paneer. Theirs never disappoints, however. And you get lots of paneer which makes me extra happy. We've also had the korma and saffron cauliflower and they are both great as well. I have dreams of the garlic naan. 

I would say that the samosas are not so great, and if I was rating this by the buffet only (and the vegetarian food only), I would probably give it 3-stars. Maybe non-veg have a better experience at the buffet, but I'm not sure. 

We wanted to try a new Indian place one Sunday afternoon, but got fed up because they are all closed between the hours of 2-5. So we finally decided to go to our old staple, Mint, for the buffet. We had to laugh because the place was jam packed with Indian customers... we said that all the other restaurants must close to come eat at Mint for a late lunch. 

Most days the food is amazing and occasionally it's just good. Some days the ""medium"" spiciness is too mild and sometimes its too hot. But we've never had a bad experience here and the staff are wonderful and very friendly. Definitely give it a try, and seriously... order a mango lassi. 

Note: their menu specifically states what items are vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. They even have vegan lassis! And they also have a great beer selection.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,0,5,gcXWJqQcTupEfcUwYHq8IA

385467,2012-05-20,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"There used to be a couple of wonderful Nepalese restaurants in the Detroit Metro area, and I've missed them sorely since they closed.  Mint's Nepalese offerings made this a must-stop place during business & pleasure trips to Vegas, and I've been here several times.  This latest visit in May of 2012 found Mint as more fusion-oriented than I remembered it; they appear to have dropped some of the Nepalese dishes, which made me sad.  However, we found a great deal at Mint to be happy about.

1) Lassi bar.  Both my husband's mint lassi (not sweet) and my blackcurrant lassi (sweet) were sublime.  The color, the flavor, and the texture were all just perfect.  We did not have liquor in either lassi.

2) Drinks list is extensive, with many beers I remember fondly from my visits, including a wonderful lambic, a beer named ""Troubadour Obscura,"" and a bock that is probably one of the best beers I've ever tasted.

3) Diverse menu-- mostly Indian with some Chinese, Tibetan, and Nepalese-influenced dishes-- with many can't-fail choices.

I've enjoyed the ""Rebel Curry"" on a previous visit, but this time we had the momos-- delicate meat-filled dumplings similar to a potsticker, served with a spicy tomato-based sauce.  I had the tamarind rice, a vegetarian offering that worked well as an entree after the course of momos.  My husband had the chicken Chau Chau-- one of the Tibetan noodle dishes-- and a bowl of the delicious noodle soup.  I had the warm sweet carrot Halwa for dessert and my husband had kulfi; our two fellow guests, both newcomers to Tibetan and Nepalese food, both enjoyed the Chau Chau with shrimp and the lamb momos.  

Service was spotty-- the server had to be asked three times to provide lemon wedges for our water, and frequently missed at least one person at our four-person table when providing refills or removing dishes.  And during almost every course-- beer, entree, dessert-- we encountered the news that something we'd ordered wasn't available at that moment (no Ras Malai or Hakka noodles), so each of were eating and drinking our ""second best"" picks for at least one course out of the menu.  The dessert I ordered wasn't available and the server took it upon himself to bring me out mango kulfi instead, which was a nice gesture but a terrible idea, as I am allergic to mangoes and had previously indicated I did not want mangoes in my iassi.  Dishes are presented attractively on four-cornered white plates but presentation isn't really exceptional.

In spite of these hiccups, we had a very good time, which goes to show how excellent the food and drink here are.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be heading to Flamingo Rd for another lassi and a plate of momos.",ajyW7_5AqD6Xj2wDi-5d3g,0,0,4,8cDkErc1kN4I14YtBXootg

2. The waiter clearly asks for water with ice or without it. How many Indian place do so?


And the good part ends there, rather miserably.

My friends, veg asked for a thali for 2. Question: how can a thali for 2 have only 1 nan?
Lamb lollypops, not well marinated and rubbery.
We were asked to rate the level of spice in food, we asked for 8 and got a -8

0/5 for food. There is an apt hindi saying: unchi dukaan feeka pakwan (only pomp and show but no content).

A good reataurant has to be flexible, we asked for a thali which had kheer for dessert but we requested to substitute with gajar halwa ( available on a different thali ). The request was rudely turned down not by the steward but by the kitchen, we never got what we asked for.

The waiter goofed up plain rice and jeera rice and tells us not to worry he will have the ticket updated. I love food and feel bad when my love for food is weighed in currency.

We started with popadoms and samosa chat. For the mains we had goat biryani, makhni daal, karahi chicken and garlic naan. It was all very well prepared and presented. The 'hot' dishes were a bit mild for my taste, but after a week of eating at the hotels, it really was a joyous dinner. 

The service was absolutely top notch and waiters made sure we were looked after without being over-imposing.

510259,2010-01-01,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Every time I visit Las Vegas I must without fail eat at Mint Indian Bistro, because I believe it's one of the best Indian restaurants in the country.  I say this after having sampled the vegetarian food selection at over a hundred Indian restaurants in about a dozen major cities over the past two decades.  The diversity, freshness, and flavor of the Nepali/Indian vegetarian food at Mint is unmatched.

I usually order the Lumbini Platter, which is vegan.  This is not cheap at $28 and others may simply wish to try the lunch buffet instead.  But for those willing to try the vegan platter, let me say that it's health food that tastes like gourmet food.  The meal comes with rice, whole wheat roti, a mixed lentil daal with a tantalizing smoky flavor, a few different vegetable combinations each with their own unique flavor, and a carrot pudding for dessert.  On my last visit Chris, the owner, who has become a friend of mine, recommended I try the soy mango lassi afterward, and being in an adventurous mood I tried it and was very happy with the result.

What makes the food at Mint so different is that the flavors of all the ingredients come out in a delightful blend and dance on your palate, because unlike most Indian restaurants, the chef here is sparing with the chili powder, uses oil in carefully controlled amounts, and uses different spice combinations in each dish.  As a result you eat to your heart's content, enjoy every bite, remember the delicious curries Mom cooked at home (if you're from India), and end up feeling like you've done your body a favor with all that nutrition.",gl64cPrBgLmHNWmo25o5tA,0,0,5,9DPhB55fyX4qlj-2ABpe8g

My boyfriend and I stopped here after hearing that they had a lot of vegan options on their menu. First of all, it was FREEZING  inside. SO cold that I had to ask for a cup of tea because I was getting tired of sitting with goosebumps. We were both hungry, and got the Vegan Sampler ($26.99). I got a cup of tea and we got a side of garlic naan.

The garlic naan wasn't naan. It was just flatbread (roti) with WAY too much garlic pushed into the top.  Neither my boyfriend nor I could stomach that much garlic, and that's saying a lot coming from two garlic fiends.

The vegan sampler was so small...for $26.99 we were expecting something to feed two people. It was more like for one person. You get a small, 1/2 cup serving of 6 vegan dishes, including 1-2 cups of cooked white rice. It was not enough by any means. It was supposed to come with a side of coconut sorbet, but it never came. We were told they had replaced it with the ""carrot pudding"" that was on our sampler. We didn't want that....we wanted the coconut sorbet! SO disappointed.

Way too expensive for the amount of food you get. My bill of $38.00 shouldn't have left us leaving still HUNGRY. My tea cost $5.99. For one tea bag.

525478,2013-03-30,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"We were visiting Las Vegas and were craving Indian food. Mint had a lot of good reviews and we decided to check this place out. The crowd was extremely young and the place was lively. The decor was okay with muted sounds of Indian cinema music in the background. The menu was very innovative -- almost every appetizer and entree had a twist. We are vegetarian and so this review won't help if you are looking to hear about the chicken tikka masala (which I am told is good...). 

So, we ordered the Organic Samosa and vegetable pakoras. We also ordered the mahakali mango masala (yes that is the real name), Dal Maharani Balti, and the Hariyali Kabab. After a long day of gallivanting, we were hungry and would have eaten anything cooked :-)

For the food then... While the names were innovative, the food not so much. The Hariyali Kabab was green (as expected), but was bland. The chutneys were basted on a bit too much and there was literally no spice. The Mahakali Mango Masala was similarly taste free and bland. We had ordered this with paneer and it was undercooked. The Dal wasn't bad and probably the only item that was tasty enough. The breads, on the other hand, were fresh and nice.

Also there were a lot of innovative lassi types. These were very nice as well. 

Perhaps the items with meat were better and the crowd was generally having a lot of fun! So, we might have been the unlucky group. This place is definitely worth a visit just to see the creativity in the menu.",0kvZ3xoRf08373a3BuqZjQ,0,0,3,ZeULuowAw7dp0JQV6Zn1Ag

Ordered the lamb Karma Korma for the entree. I asked for the mild spice, since i don't normally like the really hot dishes, but I probably could have gone with the medium spice.

In the non veg section there was chicken tikka masala, chilli chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry and another chicken dish. They all were great; I ate a bit of each coz it was that good.

Also, a nice little plus for you spicy food eaters out there---When you first open your menu, there is an entire page dedicated to ""inferno"" courses. I don't know if you have ever had a ghost chili or not, but these meals consist of that and habeneros. On a scale of 1-10 in spicy, most of them are 30s-50.

Don't get me wrong, Mint Bistro's food is not the best Indian food one can find, but well above, for instance, Gandhi Indian Bistro, which is just a short distance to the west.

Four stars is probably a little high for the food, more like three and one-half. The cons: in every chicken dish that I've tried, the chicken is overcooked. I routinely expect that in chicken tandoori, but not in tikka masala, or even the chicken chili at Mint Bistro. Additionally, the food is definitely toned down for American tastes. I have to load up on the chili paste at the salad bar.

I do the recommend the chutneys here, all of them but especially the mint and coconut chutneys.

The service and smiles on the staff merit five stars. I like to see happy people in a restaurant. That makes me believe the management cares enough to consistently produce a good product.

Finally, the beer selection is very good, though for some odd reason, Mint Bistro carries no American beers, not even some of the premium micro-brews.

I'm from California and have been to many Indian restaurants from San Diego to the bay area. My aunt and uncles also own a couple of Indian restaurants and I've had Indian food when I've visited India so I know how the food should taste. I went to there lunch buffet which is ten dollars ( not a bad price for a buffet in Vegas). Now even though the price is low, that doesn't mean the quality of food should be low. When I went i noticed that the food was cold and that the containers in which they house re food were all open. This is very bad because that food is exposed to air and bacteria the entire time that the buffet is being served. The food also didn't have any flavor(the somasa were round and only had potatos, they were more like thick potato chips and the chicken tikka masala was very plain and didn't have any sweetness or spice). Indian food should be either spicy or somewhat sweet, it should never be flavorless. When it came time to pay, I had to wait ten minutes because the two guys at the register were on there cell phones and very slow to process my bill. I left them a 4 dollar tip and as I was leaving one of the workers says bye to me all while still on his cell phone, this in unacceptable customer service.

If you try the lunch buffet, the Chicken Chili over Basmati rice is unreal, as are the curries, and spicy potato/bell pepper.

We just tried the dinner, and I got the spicy potato dosa and let me tell you- it was awesome! We come back here again and again and, I promise, one day I'll work up the nerve to take the ghost pepper curry challenge :) 

Also, we tried the food at the brand new location on the West side. They have some Indo-Asian dishes that are mind-blowingly tasty, including little fried lentil flour bread that makes naan seem passe, as well as fried baby corn (Amazing!) and the best chicken wings I've had in Vegas - with a twist of a chili sauce and minced chives.

Try the makhani!

Service can be a little uneven. Sometimes they will bring dishes without serving spoons, or present a shared appetizer without plates so you have to ask for them. At times I've had to flag them down to get the check. 

Sometimes the kitchen is a little odd. The menu says the tomato soup has paneer, but I recently ordered it and it came without it. So I had them redo it. I was there again last week and as I was ordering the soup I asked about this, and had to point to the menu where it says the soup has paneer. No really, it says paneer, I like paneer, bring it to me with the paneer!

I am a little worried about them, however . . . they used to have the biggest beer list in Las Vegas, but now if you want to order beer, they are out of stock of almost everything on the list. They point you to a table where you can look at what is available, and I'd guess there are less than ten selections. Not a good sign that they are not sticking to the brand promise of an amazing beer list.

I remember visiting a long time ago for the buffet and not being very excited about the food. This trip was different.
We all were excited to see so many options of different types of indian food, and tried the following:

chau chau noodles with veggies-This was yummy despite the taste of tomato ketchup in it. really yummy actually. 
Schezwan fried rice-good
dal makhani-yumm
saag with paneer-flavorful 
cheese naan, naan and tandoori roti were fresh and crisp

The only downside was the fact that the portion sizes are quite small for the price. They also charge for chutney, onions etc.

When you get into the restaurant and you don't have a reservation, you'll have to add your name to a wait list. When they're ready for you they'll give you a call. That part was kinda cool. We didn't have to wait long, but I was surprised there were a good number of people already on the wait list. They were pretty busy on a random Wednesday night.

The complimentary papadum was nice. It was a good way to begin our meal. 

If you love spice, try the paneer tikka masala at a 7. You'll get some good heat and some tasty curry. There was no need to add extra cayenne to this dish.

They've also got some flavorful lamb rogan josh here if you're into lamb.

Tip: If you enjoy spice, but don't like it too hot, don't order ""medium"" because it'll be a little on the bland side. I should have given a number like a ""5"" or a ""6"" because the chicken tikka masala I got at medium could have used a lot more kick. 

Overall, 5 stars for the paneer tikka masala at a 7. Minus 1 star because it took a little long to get our food.",ojTxLImVnUj-_XHBGHsIhA,0,0,4,BQpK4VXgOWepMVfnItTKqw

This place has been a few different restaurants in the few years I've lived on this side of town. It was a Himalayan restaurant, and now it's Indian restaurant. The decor inside is very basic. Moss green walls, some black iron pieces on the walls but was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that I particularly like in ethnic restaurants. I feel like decor really adds to an experience, it makes it feel authentic. This place didn't really have that. It was new, so maybe that's why it was so sparsely decorated. I took someone here because they never tried Indian before, so we just ordered the Indian Sampler. The Indian Sampler had about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables, lamb vindaloo, chicken masala, lentils, tandoori chicken, yoghurt, kheer, and one other that I can't remember. It was accompanied by 2 pieces of sliced garlic naan and basmati rice. The coconut curry veggies were fantastic, the flavors were excellent. The lamb vindaloo was good, not great. Not as spicy as i'm used to, but not bad. The tandoori chicken was kind of a joke,  it looked like two cornish game hen legs. So micro chicken legs, I thought that looked horrible.  We ordered lychee lassi and mango lassi, and for whatever reason I was served lukewarm mango lassi. I've never received lassi that wasn't cold, so it was a little different for me since the lychee lassi was served over ice. The service was good, no complaints on that. The owner chatted with us a little and was friendly. All in all, it was okay. It wasn't great, the price points are lower than Origin India, so i'd go back if I wanted to pay something a little more moderate. The experience was fun, nothing mind blowing. Origin India just blows it out of the water as far as the quality of the food and ambiance though, so i'd much rather go there if I had a choice.",P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA,2,2,3,UIljDeAoBj_XtTD_yLvBWA

The menu itself is an enjoyable read - very cleverly written.

My most recent visit was on Valentines Day 2012, when they had a pre-fixe menu - which was a four-course meal with several options for each course. At $40 per person, not including drinks, this was a more expensive meal than the usual dinner here. If anything, there was too much food, but I love leftovers for breakfast, so I'm okay with that.

The meal was delicious as always, the waitstaff friendly and prompt - especially considering how slammed they were on this big dining-out night.

Two special little treats were the Rose Mintini - a slightly sweet, rose-flavored cocktail that was a perfect compliment to the spicy fare - and the kulfi, which was a cardamom flavored cross between rice pudding and ice-cream. Extremely rich and flavorful, it was served in tiny cups, but was creamy and wonderful - and just the perfect treat to end a lovely meal.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,0,0,4,kaOic4iGjP6PEAMjtgMD0w

I was reading through my reviews and realized that Mint was missing!!!

I have been here about a dozen times and evey time I have left happy and very full!

I have not tried lunch or the buffet. We have been here on date nights and brought friends here for dinner only.

The only con I have is the service can be slow, well most of the time the service here is slow. They always seem disorganized and usually forget an item or two that we order. I understand duh this is not fast food...the guys just always seem flustered. We always overlook it and never are in a hurry to inhale food anyway.

Being vegan we have TONS of options to choose from and we usually just tell the server to pick a potato curry dish, a veggie dish, an app and a chef special creation.
We always get two orders of garlic bread we order extra garlic and it's amazing!!!!

Every meal is different and every experience has been very flavorful and fresh! When you let them order it really does make for a more unique and special dinner.

Organic tea selection is top notch and my fav is a rooibos called African Sunset. Warm and yummmmy.

My family and I had 2 meals there during this trip.  
The first was lunch buffet.  They have so many dishes in the buffet and all of them taste excellent.  The idli was super fluffy and the coconut chutney tasted great.  Pakoda was super crispy and was made with all kinds of vegetables. Chilli chicken was supremely tasty.  Came back very satisfied, happy and ready to gamble some more! ;)
The second time we went for dinner and again we were not disappointed.  We had fried okra - crispy fried okra chips.  I had never eaten this before and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The food we ordered was really good (roti, mushroom mutter(served with rice), and idli sambar).  The waiter serving us was super nice and accommodated our change request after we had placed our order.

As a father of 2 and a family man who was looking for good Indian food, I have to say I would never recommend this spot to anyone bc their service is dookey sauce and the homeboys that are servers like to speak Spanish in hopes you don't understand their insults!

The food is only take out worthy.  They literally serve water in a bottle that is tap and the bottle had black mold at the top of the cap!! ""Disgusting!!!""

The only Indian person we saw from this restaurant was the cocktail server who was great. 

All in all never go here bc they are a disgrace to the Indian Cuisine and I hope the city health inspectors shut them down!!!

I love starting with their Naan, warm bread toped with roasted garlic and butter. My favorite two entree's are the Mahakali Mango Masala and the Andhra Curry. They are signature entrees. 

The mango masala has fresh vegetables with mango chunks that are cooked in an onion/fennel-seed base. I get it with the chicken ($16.99), but you can also get it with the lamb ($18.99). It is served with long grain white rice.

The Andhra Curry is a spicy curry mixed with coconut milk. It is very favorable with it's combination of spices. I think this dish is best with lamb ($15.99) but have also had it with chicken ($15.99). Dinner for two is about $45.00 with bread, no alcoholic drinks, no dessert.

This is review is relevant for the weekend buffet on a Sunday afternoon.  First impression was nice modern decor and fast friendly service. After previewing the buffet my mouth was watering in preparation for the feast that was about to go down. After filling up my plate it was time for the show. 

I started with a bite of both the tikka masala with chicken and paneer.  The base sauce was thin and spicy. The sag paneer was even more spicy and lacking the richness my tastebuds are accustomed to. I went back for Gulab Jamun and Mango custard to cool down my mouth. 

Overall I've grown accustomed to slightly less spicy and more rich flavored Indian cuisine. The service, cleanliness and decor were great, but the food was too spicy and curry seemed watered down.  To each his own.",_UsSJFj7phfzoKQfzbnV6A,1,0,3,wIGGrMkb3-v727A96HMfSA

At lunch, the buffet is outstanding. Actually, it blew my mind.  One erstwhile yelper commented that the dishes were among the ""most common"" and then recommended the spread at India Palace.

Indian lunch buffets are usually pretty sketch. In most cases, it's the food leftover from the night before, and it's obvious. Not the case here.

Every single item in the line was FRESH, DELICIOUS, and tasted as if had been made right there and then. I know this because I had been here for dinner just a couple weeks back, so I could judge accordingly.

I sampled a little bit of everything. The Chili Chicken, the Tikka Masala, Chicken Pakorda, Saag, Daal Tarka, the Idli Sambar....mmmmmm!

For 10 bucks, this really is the best lunch in all of Las Vegas! You get a ton of food and it's delicious. 

If you have Vegan or Vegetarian friends, there are plenty of options in the buffet line as well. Everything is clearly marked, so there is no hanky panky.

Service was great, just like last time.

I can't wait to come back.

Well, I've never had that recipe, but in the past, the goat was always salty. This time, it's like a smooth lamb - it's dark and tasty-tasty!

The buffet includes enough purely vegetarian items to make a Vegan want to get fat. And it's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. The service is good, and the staff is friendly. 

My only regret? I don't live in Las Vegas and it's going to be a long time before I get back. And The Mint will be the first stop when I get back.",bxJ9khqOeorLHyzMj1ShfQ,0,0,5,RGekwElEnKHqlZR6-7KzaQ

1688038,2011-08-26,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I went here with some friends during our recent vegas stay. It was really awesome. Going to vegas, people always rave about the food, but I've never really found anything food wise that I cant live without.

I am a vegetarian for almost 9 years now and most buffets are meat/seafood heavy and I just don't see the value in paying for salad.  That makes indian food a really attractive option for me. I was with 7 other people and we settled on indian after a little bit of back and forth negotiations.

I am really glad we did!  First, its a little off the strip so parking was easy to find.  Coming with 8 people isn't always easy to accommodate without reservations but Mint was more than accommodating.  

We had excellent service.  We had a free appetizer and our glasses were always filled before we had to ask. 

The menu was fairly extensive.  There were a lot of options, including many of the traditional indian favorites: naan, kormas, masalas, etc.

The portions were generous, served quickly and hot.  My veggie korma was really good.  All around everyone was very happy with the dishes they ordered. 

Some of the items we ordered included: 

Veggie Korma
Lamb Korma
Naan- Garlic and Plain
Rice
Dinner special menu set 1
Mango Lassis
And Chicken Masala. 

The korma was smooth and not gritty.  Gritty korma is a pet peeve of mine.  The dinner set came in traditional metal serving trays with many little sides.  They didn't make a fuss in my request to substitute 2 of the meat options for vegetarian options.  The vegetables were cooked correctly and not mushy/overcooked.  

The spice level was low for me but I also have a very high spice tolerance.  Everyone else seemed to think it was around medium spicy. 

We split the check in 2, which they didn't give us any heartache about.

I'd recommend it as a nice, calm place to get a solid, tasty, dinner while in Vegas- especially if you have a larger group and don't want to fight with the long lines at buffets.  Also Mint is really vegetarian friendly.  All in all, a great experience. =)",uUwBUasesyn3LLXysx54LQ,0,0,5,eU71OB6p3haD1ALgwIE2jA

I was finally able to convince my husband to try Indian food.  The lunch buffet was a decent price so let's go.  It's located in a small strip mall off of Flamingo.  Parking here is tight and very few spaces.  The dining area itself is very clean.  The buffet area was also kept tidy and presentable.  Service was good with very polite employees. 

Since spicy food is right up the hubs alley, he liked the Chicken Chilli.  This dish is listed on their fusion items.  Very spicy loaded with chilies, green peppers and onions with soy sauce and Indian spices.  I tried a variety of their vegetarian options which I enjoyed! Of course you do have your choice of naan bread that is made there in house.  Fluffy with butter and garlic made this my favorite.

I ordered the rose lassi ($5) with soy milk, and we ordered the Naan appetizer as well as one of the more popular ones, with cauliflower. That one was a little spicy but very tasty. 

I usually get chicken Tikka masala so I decided to try their mango masala. The taste was very similar to the Tikka masala but with chopped mangoes in the sauce, which I never would have thought would go well in Indian food, but which was very good. 

Waitservice was good too and our waiter recommended some dishes to us. 

They get 4 instead of 5 stars because we each got a tiny portion of rice, and when one friend ordered more, there was a $1.99 upcharge. Also I felt like our waiter did try to sell some of the dishes too much, like the Naan app, which we did end up ordering.

1852838,2017-08-28,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I'm learning Vegas surprisingly has quite the Indian food dining scene, which is fantastic to say the least. My family and I were headed back to the strip (our home base) after a long but fun day at the west rim of the Grand Canyon. We knew we wanted Indian but the strip joints couldn't promise a 4-5 star meal. I did a quick search as we got closer and Mint was just a couple minutes away and seemed to have a good track record. 

We arrived and were seated immediately. We were given a good amount of time to review their expansive menu which by the way is filled with more variety than I have ever seen in any Indian restaurant coming from Chicago. A lassi bar, lassi cocktails, various styles of naan, an inferno challenge - living upto the Vegas touch, foods labeled clearly as vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, Jain, etc. We ordered masala papad and sev puri as appetizers to start and both were above average. We felt the sev puri lacked much flavor. For our entrees we did paneer tikka, pineapple schezwan rice, fire roasted garlic naan, kabuli naan and bhatura. The paneer tikka was excellent - full of flavor, as was the naan and bhatura - yum! The rice was far too spicy to eat so I wish we hadn't gotten that and the kabuli naan tastes like desert so I wish I had passed on that because it was odd having to eat it with the paneer tikka. 

Overall we had a great meal and were quite impressed with menu and selections, the ambience was nice and service was quick. There's definitely room for improvement however. I guess some of the busboys don't know English (they don't communicate this to us) so when we would order something with them a waiter would come and ask us again and everyone would be lost as to if someone was getting our order. It would be much simpler if those that don't know English would just grab someone that does or not work the floor. For drinks we saw lychee lassis on the menu and knew we had to have them, so we ordered only to find out they're unavailable along with the tandhai, two of their most unique flavors!!! I was so disappointed to learn this. The owner explained it's because they need someone to bring it from India whenever family or friends go which is hard to rely on, but then I feel the menu is a tease in that way. I feel when it's available they would make a ""specials"" menu for the month and include it on there. In that event I went with a rose lassi which was great, my got a mint lassi because again the uniqueness of flavors. Well that was a mistake. We were thinking mojito like sweetness in a mint lassi - we were very wrong. For those of you that know what the mint ""pain"" in pani puri tastes like, it's that, mixed with yogurt. Absolutely unpleasant in the context of a lassi. Regardless of the mishaps, we had a generally great meal and would definitely consider returning when back in town. Only a 5 minute drive from the strip, well worth it for the quality of food.",WOlBelW_IzsKOyizelNKCw,2,1,4,UlVChFj5m3bBmT4ED8kfow

First minus 1 star - for the annoying fly buzzing around the table... Yes that is a natural thing that they can't really control but it started my dinner there on a wrong note.... So let me add one more thing onto this one to make it more even for anyone that is keeping count....:). After they dropped off the entrees they didn't check back on us even tho there were only 3 other tables... And we had to actually yell across the restaurant to get some water as all the hand waving and polite excuse me fell on deaf ears. :( Service (1/5)

Minus 1 star - I ordered roti and it came out like a thick tortilla... What happened to the layers?? All the roti that I have ever gotten were light and flaky. This one was thick like really thick tortilla that was very under seasoned. This was just a chewy piece of under seasoned tortilla. It was better after I started dipping it into the sauces that came with my papadum. Still was not very appetizing. :( Food (1/5)

Minus 1 star - I ordered my Rebel curry at level 10... When I got it... It was a level 1 not spicy at all. Disappointment since the server even warned me that it was spicy... My friend that I was eating dinner with even agreed that it was not spicy either. Food (1/5)

Minus 1 star - they left huge pieces of a spice.... I'm guessing star anise in my curry that was inedible. Either fish it all out as I understand that the curry needs the spice or ground it up so that I'm not biting into it as I'm trying to ""enjoy"" my dinner. Food (1/5)

Minus 1 star - for not having the inferno menu. They couldn't tell me when I placed the order. They took my order and then 10 minutes later told me that they were out of the chilis.... but there was no communication about that at anytime at all until 10 minutes after I ordered it. I'd figure that if it was something that u are known for that u wouldn't run out. That's what I think maybe I'm wrong... But this is my review... So minus 1 star

Ambiance was ok. It wasn't spectacular... It wasn't dirty... It was just ok...(2.5/5)

So overall with my first impression mixed with my second ""not impressed at all"" impression....I will never be going back. I will not waste one more penny at this place. It just was not worth it... And by my count they should be at a 0 star from me. Way too many other BETTER Indian restaurants in town to waste my time at this place.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,5,2,1,uweJU274iJ7yIbNCu7H24A

It was a waiting list that you put your name and phone number on the the app. Very helpful, because I am sure that the restaurant does have many patrons. Because the day I visited, it was full of people. I only waited about 20 minutes before I was able to sit down. There was table water available already. So I'm sure they have guests asking for water. Their menu is very detailed, which I liked very much. I started out with some garlic naan, which was served warm. There were about 4 pieces in the basket. Then I ordered some buttered chicken tikka masala, that was very tasty. It was served with basmati rice. And they even asked me what spice level I wanted.

1942074,2014-04-12,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Was craving Indian and saw a bunch of Elites raved about this place, so it made the top of my list despite being further than I wanted to travel. Called in my order for takeout and headed on over. Upon entering, saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than I expected. Service was a bit lackluster- waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged, my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager-looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures, then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if I needed anything else. 
That probably explains why I didn't get any utensils or napkins, nor did I add on another side or additional naan as I'd originally planned. And there were only two tables seated at 5:30PM so it's not because they were busy.

I found this place to be a bit pricey. 
I like that half-size entrees are available for a slightly-lesser fee, but found that the decrease in pricing (usually around $3) isn't worth the decrease in product. Lesson learned. For three half-size entrees, one container of rice was provided. Also ordered one garlic naan. Total was around $40, which is a bit steep. I always have difficulty paying so high for a la carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much. I feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher, but whatever.

Quality made my entree choices worthwhile: saag paneer, baingan bharta, and lamb korma. The saag was decent but I prefer mine a little saucier, this one was a lot of spinach and good-sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough. Best eaten with the garlic naan, which was fragrant and delicious.
Baingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. It was flavorful and I appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side, which allowed for it to go well with the rice. 
The lamb korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever, and it was quite mild despite ordering a 5/10- at Thai restaurants, that'll get you a spicy dish, but I guess Indian is a little more laid back with the scale. I know now for next time. Dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a $10 portion.

Speaking of portions, I was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout.
I appreciated that the half-size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled. But the size of the portions themselves were on the small side- think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery. That size. 

Going to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet, thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience. Good quality, vast menu of options including several vegetarian dishes.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,3,AfusFb69H110KB_-e0tbVA

2037111,2011-10-19,4,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Mint Indian Bistro is an interesting spot. It's not like most Indian places I'm used to. A little more upscale, a little more gourmet, a little more... well... different. My paradigm for Indian food is, in general, that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste). When I walked in to Mint I immediately formed an impression about what I was going to eat, and I was not too surprised in the end. Just glad to have some decent Indian food since I come from a place that has none. 

The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc. Not as dirty, earthy, pungent, and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks. But it's good nonetheless, and sticks fairly well to form as being actual Indian and not fusion, which is what I tend to see at higher-end Indian places. 

I sampled the chicken Vindaloo, which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender, succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that I'm used to. It has a decent heat to it but not quite the ""fiery descent"" that's comically described on the menu. The Saag Paneer is quite nice, with a less 'spinach-y' flavor than I'm used to. A much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast. The name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies. Nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three. Paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of Roti, 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two. Props for offering half-size portions... if only the price were half too!

The drinks list is mighty impressive, with a very extensive beer selection, some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings, and of course wine. My rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what you'd expect. 

Three half-plates, Roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54, kind of a lot for the amount of food, but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than I'm used to seeing in the street Indian I usually seek out. The experience, including the impeccable service, also adds in to the value. Papadam to start, clean plates to transition from papadam to meal, and constantly full waters. This is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole in the wall spots I hit in SF for my sub-continent fix.

Light with the perfect balance of softness and crispness...All for a cool $9.99 on weekdays. Oh, and UNLV students get a discount.

My favorite dishes are the Aloo Saag, Chana Saag, and Chau Chau. All are packed with such great spices and full of flavor! I can't leave without having a little bowl of the Khir (rice pudding) and also enjoy their Gajar Haluwa (the carrot pudding).

I have dined here for dinner, but find I have such a tough time choosing one dish because I've become so used to sampling them all at the lunch buffet :)

The food itself is delicious, the ingredients and quality are good. At some Indian food places I have been to, I am disappointed when I see the food is very oily or it smells as if it is not fresh- or low grade quality ingredients are being used. That is never the case at mint. You can trust you are getting good food here.
I also think that for the price it's a good deal. 
There are plenty of options for me as a vegan and I like that everybody there is always willing to let you know what's what on the buffet line. 
The interior of the place is small, clean, and has a quiet mellow feel to it. I do like that as well because sometimes dining and noisy places is just too much. I enjoy a quiet meal w good food.

First a note on the atmosphere, the restaurant had been booked for some event that sounded like a presentation on maintaining your visa. The event ran over and they were not taking walk ins so it's difficult to give a proper evaluation of the noise and the typical crowd. However we had a reservation and the staff quickly adjusted. The fact that an all Indian event would choose this place says something about the authenticity.

We ordered samosa and garlic naan to start. The pastry was light and crispy and the filling was perfect. The naan was light and fluffy. For main courses we got a chicken vindaloo which was tasty and well spiced and a shrimp mikhani. I had never heard of this dish and from the description was expecting something like a tikka massala. It wasn't. It had sweeter creamier taste. It was delicious and I highly recommend it. The staff also brought us extra naan with dinner.

The service we received was great. My friend had informed the owner what it was we were doing, and he was more than accommodating. He sat down with us and we were able to talk to him about the restaurant which is really nice. 

The food, however, was so disappointing. Two of us split the Indian sampler, as it was advertised that it was ""Perfect for two to share or one to feast on."" Naturally, I was expecting a bunch of food. To my disappoint, when the platter came out - it was nothing more than barely a half cup of each item. It was not enough to satisfy one persons' hunger, let alone enough for two to share. We had even ordered an extra side of naan. It was sad to say, we had more naan than food to eat it with. It's a sad, sad day when that happens. 

I will say, their mango lassi was good.

A majority of my group was disappointed, just as I was, in the food to price proportions. Although, many of them left full, unlike myself - the price they paid for the food wasn't sitting too well with them. But who can blame em? My friend and I spent about 40 dollars between the two of us, to leave the place completely dissatisfied and hungry.

The naan bread is made right in front of you in a big, silver oven that you just want to stick your head in to eat all the bread. This restaurant is perfect for vegetarians/vegans. I have never seen so many options at an Indian buffet in my life. The paneer masala and veggie korma were my favorites. 

If you are looking to learn more about Indian cuisine, this is the place to go! The lunch buffet is massive, so you will be able to eat more than the basic tandoori chicken or chicken tikka masala. I honestly feel like I learned so much more about Indian food from my most recent experience at the Mint Bistro lunch buffet. Can I say how yummy the veggie korma was again?!

2250584,2011-08-11,2,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"A year ago we visited and I thought, ""It's okay, but there are too many places I like better."" This summer, finally taking heed of the restaurant's ""You Yelped. We Listened."" comment, we came back.

And back. And back.

This review only covers the lunch buffet as I've yet to make it out for dinner, but don't think I don't have my eye on that Paneer Makhani.

Speaking of paneer, it's my thing. I like pakoda/pakora, dal, aloo anything, and malai kofta, but what gets me on my feet and the car keys in my hand is the promise of paneer in a creamy sauce.

Oh, but it can't be sag or palak paneer. I've got a spinach issue. (It's what keeps me off the Galactic Council of Vegetarians.) And muttar paneer (peas and cheese) is nice, but everyone does that. My bar is set above that and getting higher all the time.

And Mint has met the challenge. Every visit this summer has been met with a different creamy-sauced paneer dish. Sometimes a tikka masala, sometimes something I've never heard of. And when there is a spinach-y paneer, there's still a non-spinach option as well.

I'm going to buy a choir robe just so it looks less weird when I walk the Mint buffet line shouting ""Hallelujah!"" 

In addition to the paneer is the fresh salad offerings (fruit, chutney, raita, the usual), vegetable pakoda, lentils, and then a few surprises. I try everything because nothing has let me down yet. Oh, except for the meat, but my husband has that covered. You can probably hear him ""Mmmm!""ing across the restaurant. (And maybe across the street at the Atomic Museum on the days they serve chicken pakoda.)

Flavour was an issue with me a year ago. Mint's taste was strong and samey to me, not clearly made with a careful hand. Good, but not as great as other places. But now? It's easy to savour every bite, and I find myself so, so, SO sad when I'm full. ""But the party is still going on!"" my mouth says, but my tummy draws a velvet rope and suggests that next time maybe I eat less naan.

(But the naan is so soft and garlicky! You can have plain naan as well, but this is one of the few places where I really enjoy the garlic naan and don't find it a little acrid/burnt.)

For dessert, there's always (at least when we've visited) gulab jamun. If I were a mad scientist with preteen fashion sense, I'd freeze-dry a ball of gulab jamun and wear it around my neck to show my love for this fragrant, rosy dessert. The syrup at Mint is airy but strong, and the spheres are porous and squishy, just how I like it.

Service is always hospitable and swift. I especially dig the carafes of ice water on each table, the condensation a pretty sight on a hot Las Vegas day.

It has taken me two months to write this review because I can't start thinking about Mint without finding myself driving across town for a reasonably priced lunch. This time, armed with a full stomach, I have made it to the end of the review.... but I think I know where we're going for dinner.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,3,3,5,4boXDT__Htgjv3rNbHiC-A

We all greatly enjoy their yogurt, so they finished off their helpings and asked for extras, which the service complied with. When they were leaving, he asked for an extra yogurt so that he could bring some home for the leftovers. 

When the check was brought to the table, he was able to take a look at it before another one was quickly brought out. When he asked why he was being given a different check, he was told it was so that they could apply the two-for-one tikka masala. That was untrue- the first check already showed the two for one discount, the only discernable difference was that he'd been charged a dollar for the yogurt. 

It's not a big deal that they charged him a dollar for the yogurt- the problem is that they obviously felt the need to lie about it after failing to mention anything earlier. That was really disappointing.

A thicker Tikka Masala curry (both veg and chicken) than their previous recipe. A long row of creative curries. Even Chicken Vindaloo. 

Full disclosure - this was probably my 14th time eating the lunch buffet here and I have never liked it as much as this trip. I actually stopped coming here because I felt there was a lack of selection and no variety (always the same buffet items). The last time I came here was in the Summer of 2013. We were driving by and hungry and a what-the-hell moment ensued. We went to Mint for the first time in almost a year.

Clearly lots has improved, and I am a huge fan. The Mt. Everest Indian restaurant on Sahara has a lot to live up to now (I've eaten at Mt. Everest close to 25-30 times.) Mint is my new favorite Indian lunch buffet spot in Las Vegas, no contest.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,4,5,5,TkHGSRj49mBBhAiGV-D3qw

$11 or $12, i dont remember.

they had mint chutney! very good stuff. not spicy though. 
they had an interesting basmati rice with cashews, dried cranberries, and other stuff. it was pretty good. never had anything like that before.
all of their curries were excellent. i really liked the mutton on bone the most. 
the tandoori chicken was a little dry, but it usually is. lunch had just started so everything was fresh.

last time i ate here i dunno if i ate too much but i had really bad food coma. this time i had 3 plates but feel good.

maybe its the waiters thick indian accent that makes the food taste better at mint, but this place is definitely one of the better places to get inidian food in town.

At 4pm, we were the only consumers there. Other started coming in little by little, probably because it's raining outside. 

The aroma of the place alone makes you drool. So many mixtures of spices floating in the air! 

We were served our water one at room temp and the other with ice. We ordered, and had our food maybe 15-20 mins later. 

Recommending their Chicken Tikka Masala (Roasted Chunks of Chicken in a creamy, spiced, orange colored sauce), Chicken Tindoori (Yogurt Marinated and seasoned with spice mixture), Garlic-Butter Naan (somewhat like pita bread), Biryani Rice. It was enough to feed my family of four though we had to order another two orders of the Butter-Garlic Naan. It was just that good! 

We also ordered the Raita sauce which is yogurt based to cool the spiciness of the chicken tindoori for my mom who doesn't like spicy food. It definitely did what it's supposed to but the taste was nothing to go crazy over. I've tasted better from other places. 

One star deducted for how non attentive the servers where when we were there. They only came to our table when one of us flagged them down and never did they just check up on us throughout our meal. 

As for the place, clean looking, very spacious, dimmed lights to make the place more intimate and music to portray the the desired ambiance of the place.

Was greeted by a cheerful fellow and seated in a booth while waiting for my date. Prompt water, and after a little confusion trying to order top shelf vodka/soda/lime. 

I had looked forward to trying either the Vegan or Vegetarian Chef's Dinners (crazy amounts of food, a bit a of everything for $44 $38, respectively) he was reluctant so we went a la carte, which ended up with far less food. They also offer Gluten Free Chef's Menu & have one of the most clearly marked menus I've ever seen describing each item and what categories they fall into, awesome. 

The waiter takes your order on an iPhone, which took us a few seconds to register that he wasn't just Yelping :) When I was taking pictures of menu & food, I was asked if I was Yelping and copped to it. He proudly pointed out Yelp sticker on door. 

Now, down to food:

I ordered a cup of yellow dal : light, herbaceous and delicious enough to keep around to mop up the last bits with nan. Date had never tried it before and loved it, too. 

Two orders of Nan: yummy (too much bread for me, but guess he likes carbs) 

Brown Basmati rice: yes, please! They happily informed us it would be refilled on request and it was. 

My main course was vegan tikka masala which I ordered at level 8. Some heat, but I'd go 10 next time. Complex, full of veggies and spices and I took half home. 

Date had Mango Lassi, which he enjoyed and a usual lamb korma guy tried the vegetarian version level 8, too and ate every bite, most of the nan, and surprisingly, his first brown rice?! 

In all, service was attentive, water glasses were filled and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. In my pictures is a cute ""Happy Face Rating"" which came with bill I thought was adorable. Thought it a bit pricy at $65 + change but that would have been easily remedied ordering the Chef's Menu for 2. Another funny thing: we were trying to figure out what ""1 Russian $10"" was on check = it was my cocktail ( guessing Stoli)

My date went back today for the $10.99 lunch buffet, which he really dug. Guess he enjoyed Mint as much as I did. Once I try more items, I will update review and am pretty sure it will hold up or bump to 5*. Another plus: half orders! Keeps making me crush on you harder, Mint, you charmer. How flirty is it that they thanked me on the Facebook (c'mon y'all want to say THE Facebook so let's do it...) 

Directly across the street from the Atomic Testing Museum: perfect place to hit for lunch before or after. Yummy.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,9,6,4,liEJMi3BYIlqqT64K6ftRQ

I will just point out the positive aspect of my experience for now:

1. Fantastic service: Right when I walked through the doors, I was greeted by the staff and felt very welcome. Our waiter made sure to check up on us several times during our meal and was very hospitable. 

2. Nice accommodation: Very cute and quaint mom and pop restaurant. The interior decor is nice and their choice of music is very soothing. The restaurant is very clean as well, which is a huge plus.

3. Food: I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding but they actually won me over with their rice pudding. Their garlic naan is also delicious--very light and fluffy. Actually, I really loved most of their vegetarian/vegan dishes.",Pk-JwS_oRws8fFUzkULU0Q,2,1,3,5Krhw8j6qP5eM6Yww4DbUA
2662706,2014-08-18,5,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"-Lunch Buffet Review -
(TL;DR - I prefer my Indian cuisine to have lots of flavor, spices, and heat. Yet, sadly Mint didn't meet my requirements. The flavors here were too boring. Plus I had stomach pain soon after eating here. I won't be returning.) 

We prefer Mt. Everest's lunch buffet - they have a better selection of flavorful curries and an overall better tasting selection of food. Also, their naan (even if they don't offer garlic naan for buffet anymore) was fluffy like pillows and had more charred stone oven flavor. 

Maybe I'm the odd woman out and call me crazy, but I prefer my food to be exploding with flavor and rocking my taste buds off, you know, the type of flavor that punches you in the face. Especially when I'm in the mood for Indian cuisine, I expect bold spices and ingredients to jump out. Unfortunately, Mint didn't meet my requirements for a satisfying Indian buffet.

There was a scarcely detectable amount (if any) of spice used here, no layering of flavor, and specifically, no wow-factor. The selection here was poor and didn't offer up the typical items I was hankering for - Malai Kofta, Saag Paneer, or even Samosa, to name a few. The list goes on with my rants about this place.

Mint is also super sticky, right as I was seated, my silverware placed on the table was stuck like glue! I had to use some elbow grease to pick them up. Plus, I despise their buffet set up - you constantly have to touch the sticky germ-y handles to lift the lids up off of the trays on every single item, then use the spoon to scoop up your food. It was really gross touching the handles. Good thing I brought my wet-ones. The plates that they use gets hot instantly when you place hot food on it, so I had a hard time holding my plate without burning my hands. Also a pet peeve - they have Pepsi here and it's not fizzy at all, it was flat. 

I only found 1 item from the buffet that was delicious enough for me to get seconds of, that 1 item was the chicken korma (cashew chicken curry.) Everything else was super bland, dried out, or boring. 

Here's the breakdown of what I tried: 

- Mint and tamarind chutney were both were refreshing and flavorful. They really helped to bring life to the boring curries and food. 
- Coconut chutney was alright, but not something that I kept eating. 
- Chicken korma - rich and sweet, also had tiny hints of spice which is why this was my favorite dish out of everything I tried. 
- Saag mushroom wasn't my favorite. I really missed the cheese curds. There was no bold flavor, richness, or natural sweetness from the spinach. It was seriously bland and sad. 
- Chicken tikka masala's flavor was muted. It tasted like bland tomato cream soup and lacked all of the rich luscious flavor that I've grown fond about tikka masala. I did not finish finish it.
- Tandoori chicken was dried out and tough. 
- Chile chicken had decent flavor, but they were super dry.
- Veggie tikka masala flavor was very boring, just creamy, and no lively spices going on in there.
- They offered yogurt, which is fine, but I was upset that they didn't offer refreshing cucumber raita.
- Cranberry rice had colorful specs of carrot and peas, but it wasn't amazing or memorable.
- Both the garlic and butter naan were dry, plus the garlic flavor was faint and the butter naan was boring.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,6,2,tcO4P4HUf8syXS5unbXLJg

If you have never tried Indian food, there are several options that will get you introduced  to it with familiar flavors. They really do have something for everyone. They have easy to read descriptions and so many different flavors to choose and love. They only think that isn't 5 stars is the cocktail menu. The descriptions are nice but the flavor is just OK. Stick to the virgin Lassi or their nice beer selection for better options.

It has been fairly or very quiet every time I have gone and the service is always friendly and excellent.  You can control the spice of your food as well on a 1 to 10 scale. I usually go with an 8 or 9 depending on the dish. Good spice with excellent flavor. Great for a date night or to try somewhere new.

2734445,2018-06-01,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"So after being stuck on the strip for 4 days with insanely overpriced cafeteria style food, we decided to venture out and give this place a try. I had high hopes because it got great reviews and we've been lacking good Indian food since moving away from San Jose, ca. 

We ordered a sweet and mango lassi, pakoras, a veggie biryani and navratan korma. We ordered low
Spice levels to avoid butthole burn. 
Here's what i thought:

The good- they offer lots of good veggie and vegan options, including lassis made from soy yogurt. Good for vegetarians and vegans. Very unique lassi flavors including rose and lychee, also the option of a ""boozy lassi"" . I got a mango one and it was good and pretty standard, not exceptional by any means.
Both the navratan korma were really creamy tasting and flavorful, and the white rice was perfect. I would order this dish again here. Portions were generous and more than enough for two people.

The bad- the food didn't make us feel great. Probably because of all the heavy cream and butter used to make it taste legit, I had that brick in stomach and really sluggish feeling not even before we left the restaurant.
The chutneys were OK. 

The ugly-  the pakoras were insanely salty. Also seemed like the main flavor in the biryani was salt, and for how colorful and veggie packed it looked on pics, it didn't have much flavor except for salt. 

All in all, I might return if I had a hankering for Indian food and nothing else was around. not the best Indian food I've ever tasted but prices were decent for portions provided.",m-XsM2FcWIkakNAfrhUZmQ,0,0,3,Ili7PWGKUMaG7OooZzTHbw

A little too crispy for dipping in my entree broth but still good.

Plain Dosa 4/5
Massive in size check out my photos. Dosa tasted great but the coconut chutney was probably the worst i've tasted. 

Saag paneer 1/5
Lacking more flavor then the kofta, do they not season the food at all?...

Lime Soda 1/5
Suppose to be fresh squeezed limes, you could clearly taste that it was not.

Rose Lassi 2/5
Never tried a rose lassi before although I love mango and mint lassi's and I love rose ice cream and yogurt. Not what I was expecting.

Their menu is quite extensive, and for us newbies that have never had indian food in our lives, we were a bit overwhelmed with the options. Our waiter was great and helpful in helping us narrow down what was spicy and what wasn't. We ordered the garlic buttered naan (yum!), chicken Maharaja tikka masala, and chicken chetinad curry. The naan was delish! The masala came with a small side of rice - although the flavor was decent, I didn't love it, it was just okay. I tried hubby's curry though (which also came with a small side of rice) and I actually liked that a lot better. The flavor of the curry was bold but not too overkill. 
That being said, I was a little disappointed that the portions seemed a bit small for the price. I guess I expected a little more than a small bowl of chicken and small side of rice for a $13.99 and $15.99 meal. However, even though their portions were disappointingly small, I think I'd still come back.",-QViqz6QGfMLUYLY73lysg,1,1,4,sH9m99hK0i6dMsts2mEB7A

Where the oasis would be a really good Indian restaurant and the desert, well, is Las Vegas. My experiences are based on dinner and not the lunch buffet. Their staff is very accommodating here and are experienced in dealing with large families and groups with small children. On busy evenings, you can flag down any of their waitstaff for assistance. I've never made a reservation here and have not waited more than 15 minutes during my last few visits. 

I love the extensive and almost daunting menu filled with northern and southern Indian dishes. We usually start off with some samosas and the Bhel Puri, which is an Indian snack food made of puffed rice. I always have to get garlic naan with my meals. The naan is an Indian flat bread that's served hot out of the oven and has a wonderful texture. The bread is great for sopping up the sweet curry sauce of their Tikka Masala. Another dish to try is the smoky and aromatic lamb dish called Rogan Josh.

Complimentary, all you can eat Naan if you dine in for lunch. A good portion wrapped up to go if you do to go. I always go with the garlic butter. 

They also have a dessert/salad bar which I always forget exists when I dive in but, when you order to go, they give you a small plastic container for dessert. I either get the frozen yogurt from the machine or the non frozen mango yogurt which is quite tasty. Both are a Great way to get some sugar without feeling too guilty. 

So the way to-go works is that they give you a normal sized to go container and you fill it up as best you can. I typically have enough for three or four meals (I shouldn't be telling you this). I go a small layer of goat, then tandoori chicken (the bone-in one) then more goat, maybe a little bit of whatever has spinach in it, then top with rice because rice is the least likely thing to spill out while still doing a good job of compressing.

Food quality and quantity: for the price the thali quantity is ok! Probably having unlimited rotis/breads would be a better with so many curries to finish. They only serve 1 garlic naan each thali (small) 
We did not like any curry, vegetable in particular to be honest. We did ask them high spice level which they probably forgot!

I used to come here for the lunch buffet when I went to UNLV but now mostly for a nice dinner. The inside has had some renovations and it's very cozy and romantic. They have a modern bar area now but I don't ever see anyone sitting at it. My favorite dishes are the biryani, paneer tikka masala, rogan josh curry, and vindaloo. I love the paneer so much but the goat is also awesome. We tried the inferno naan the last time we were there and that was not the best idea. Not sure how anyone is able to eat the curry. The flavor is not bad but you can't eat anything else after your tastebuds have been burned off. We love spicy food but this is next level uncomfortable.

First off, the place is located very close for Vegas strip but far enough that you don't get the feeling that people are walking all over/around you.. lol ! We were seated pretty quickly and provided our waters! 

As for the food, we didn't order any appetizers as we were very tired from our plane ride and just wanted to eat and get to or hotel. Because we ordered only main dishes, it took a while for the food to come out (that's why 4 stars). We got butter naan, roti, a creamy Gobi Sabji, and a paneer dish and everything was extremely delicious!!

The place is all pretty on the inside. Cute decor and the sexiest buddha sitting in the midst. But the service was horrible. We decided to sit at the counter and watch the shenanigans. Parties of two constantly being wait listed or sent to the bar then looking around and leaving. Larger parties being sat (without a reservation mind you).

While I was still placing my order the waiter said you should order the full size of curry because the small size is very little. First off I was not finished ordering and I just felt like he was trying to up sell me. Also I have been here before so I know the portions and have been served by this same waiter. 

On this visit, I ordered the mango lassi; garlic naan; chicken tikka masala; andhra curry. Mango lassi is still my favorite in town. I still don't understand why the garlic naan is not cut so when it comes out piping hot I have to wait a bit to actually tear it apart. The chicken in the tikka masala was dry even though it is buried in a cream sauce. The Indian spices in the andhra curry are overpowering to where you cannot taste the coconut milk or the fresh veggies.

The same servers have been here since I've started coming here and the manager is really nice, great staff.

The food is bomb and always has been. Best Tandoori chicken I've ever had, period. Even though I frequent the buffet, it's never the exact same as the previous trip.

Luckily, I tried the lunch buffet this time around, and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. One thing that I did like on my first visit and still like about this place is the decor. It's definitely a good place to go for a romantic date. I also am fond of the service here. 

Anyways, back to the food. At the table, the server brought us our choice of either plain, butter or garlic naan (we chose garlic) and also roti (a thinner bread made with whole wheat). The garlic naan was yummy- soft, warm and studded with garlic bits, it was perfect for dipping into the soups and curries. The roti was good too, but I definitely prefer the naan. I can't remember all I ate, but I will list off my favorites. There were three soup varieties; I enjoyed the Sambhar soup (a hearty lentil soup) the most. I also enjoyed the seasoned rice dish, as well as the Chicken Tandoori and a vegetarian dish called Paneer Tikka Masala (blocks of soft cheese simmered in a spicy tomato-based stew). I also thought the Chicken Curry dish to be flavorful and good. For dessert, I had a few cubes of watermelon and one piece of Gulab jamun (fried balls of dough soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom and rosewater). I wish I went back for seconds on dessert though. The best part about the lunch buffet is that it is healthy or at least tastes healthy. 

All in all, I had a nice time here. I would probably go back again- for lunch, that is.

The dosa is delicately positioned on a silver tray with delicious sauces, and the filling was very tasty. It left me craving more filling... The dosa was perfect. The onion combination with the malai kabob was heavenly, because the lemon pieces were generous, making the basmati rice and chicken sparkle with flavor and tenderness. The four pieces of naan were scrumptious. We had tried onion cilantro flavor and were not disappointed. Mint is a good place to know, and we look forward very much to checking out the second location west of the Strip.

We were waiting for about 15 minutes until someone has finally took our names and put them in the list. After that we waited for another 15 minutes until they called us to have a sit.

The place was packed when we walked in. The atmosphere is very dim, has somewhat of a bar/lounge feel to it. They do have a bar section specifically labeled the Lassie Bar. There were about 3 parties ahead of us, and after waiting for about 20 minutes, we decided to take a seat at the bar. We asked the server/bartender if we could order food here and then move to a table once a spot opens up. He said that once you order food, it will be difficult for us to do that. Seriously? It would take less than a minute to exchange that. Very poor customer service right there. We just ordered a glass of pinot noir and a mango lassie and waited another 20-25 minutes for our table to open up. 

The whole night basically consisted of us waiting, waiting, and waiting some more. I don't mind waiting, but the servers never said a word about the food coming out late or apologizing for the food being really slow. They seemed to be lacking employees either out on the restaurant or in the kitchen. The parties next to kept looking around as well, because they weren't getting their food either. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our food after we placed our order. 

The food was above average. The butter garlic naan was a miss. It wasn't soft, and it was lacking the garlic flavor. The Maharaja chicken tikka masala (spicy level 4) was really flavorful, and the chicken was tender. It had the right amount of spiciness too. The lamb vindaloo (spicy level 6) was ok; the lamb was really soft and juicy, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The tomato flavor was too strong in this dish. 

We should have come here for their lunch buffet before trying their dinner menu. It's probably a better bang for your buck. I'll consider giving their lunch buffet a shot before ever coming back for dinner.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,9,8,2,NZhptZuFDgWczUkW6pZMmQ

Chicken fried rice: absolutely awesome. The rice had a slight crunchy texture and though by concept may sound like raw, but was actually superb.

Yellow dal: the best dal I have had in the US. Period. Low in spices and full of flavor. In love with dal now.

Malai kofta: didn't care much for the kofta, but the gravy was awesome.

Chicken kadhai: wasn't bad but we had far superior food on our table.

Chicken momos: the momos were amazing but the sauce with it wasn't. I have had a lot of momos in India (my fav roadfood snack after chaat). I used to love the chilli sauce served with the momos in India. Here the momos were pretty close to the original though.

Paneer pakoda: good. Liked the sprinkling of chaat powder over it. 

Chilli chicken: was nice. Not like India, but am not complaining.

3375544,2013-02-06,4,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I came here for the first time just over a week ago on a Monday afternoon. I was craving for chicken tikka masala, & according to yelp, this is the highest rated Indian restaurant in the area (thanks, Yelpers). I easily found the place; it was right off the strip, & there was ample parking. As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted by one of the waiters & shown to a table even though it was slightly busy. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated & has such a warm, exotic feel to it. There were about four or five groups of people seated throughout, but there were many available tables.

The waiter brought me a menu, & I told him that I would be ordering my meal to go. He was very friendly & was smiling along with the other employees. I quickly felt at home & opened up the menu. My mouth dropped open. The menu is huge. They have all kinds of dishes from different parts of India & other southeastern Asian countries. Each item had a tempting, mouthwatering description of the dish's contents. I knew what I had come for, but I couldn't help but look over the delicious selection of foods that they had to offer. A couple minutes later, the nice waiter man returned to take my order. He was so friendly it felt like I was actually getting the full service that a customer who dines in would get. I pointed out the dishes I wanted, which were the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast & garlic naan stuffed with cheese. I also asked for rice on the side. The waiter was quick to show me a variety of fried rice options on his iPad, all of which had mouthwatering (my mouth was really watering) pictures. I wasn't sure which one to pick--I wanted them all, so he recommended the Schezwan Fried Rice.

About ten to fifteen minutes later, the waiter returned with my package of food & the tab. After paying (& leaving a tip because they were so kind!), I rushed home to taste the food I had been dreaming about for days.

I got to my kitchen & opened the bag. First thing I noticed is that they had triple wrapped my naan in foil & wax paper to preserve the texture & heat of the naan! Then I saw that my tikka masala was in a plastic container that they had also double sealed in seran wrap! How awesome is that?! I've ordered to-go from many restaurants, but I've never seen anyone so carefully wrap the food as well as they do!! Next, I saw two round foil containers & wondered, hey, I thought I had ordered only one more thing. I opened one & saw my Schezwan Fried Rice, which was still steaming (I drove home in rush hour traffic--hence my amazement). I opened the other & saw steaming hot Basmati rice!! WOW!! I thought to myself, they've already impressed me immensely with their awesome customer service & food wrapping abilities, the food must be even greater!

And man, I'm telling you, I was not at all disappointed. In fact, I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! I started with the garlic naan stuffed with cheese--that naan was better than sex!! The texture was warm, crisp, buttery & garlicky on the outside, & hot & super cheesy on the inside!! I don't know how to describe it. It was so goddamn GOOD!!!!!! I couldnt put it down for the life of me, but I knew I had to start on the tikka masala.

The Maharaja Tikka Masala.

Goodness gracious.

As soon as I dipped the delicious naan in that tikka masala & shoved the two in my mouth, I knew I had found a new religion. That tikka masala is the best thing that's been in my mouth in YEARS. Trust me, I've eaten all kinds of food from all over, & this, my friends, is where it's at!!! I think my neighbors heard me moaning as I ate. It was just that damn good!! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, so so so perfectly. It was juicy, tasty & delicious. There are no words to describe my mouth's experience with that chicken. It was as if that chicken had led a good life, died happily, & went to heaven, which is where my mouth was at that moment!

Last, but definitely not least, is the Schezwan Fried Rice. That waiter guy who recommended this to me deserves a raise. In fact, he deserves an award of some sort, cuz my goodness, that rice. That rice, people. It was beyond amazing. I had ordered it with shrimp, & you know, normally when you order shrimp fried rice from a restaurant, you expect baby shrimp, even from the high-end restaurants. But no. Mint Indian Bistro did not conform in this case--they rebelled!!! The shrimp in the Schezwan fried rice was gigantic!!! It was not only huge--it was tasty, juicy, crisp, fat-- cooked to perfection!!! I was not expecting that at all because normally fried rice is made of leftover ingredients, but no way is that fried rice made of leftovers!!! Goddamn. It was so good, I wanted to go back & give that nice waiter guy a hug!!!

This is the only Indian restaurant that I'll be eating at while I live here :)",6CtC7rVQqvB-GwTuINvbog,2,1,5,vFgIc50bD85BqrVyzqaiPg
3382544,2011-03-31,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I yelped and I googled and I yelped when I was in the process of purchasing a voucher from Restaurant.com . The foods was great but not for the money.

This is my first time I tried Rest voucher. I took a friend with me. It was definitely a lot less valuable as Groupon (from what I've gathered, there was Groupon offered at this restaurant recently). Groupon imposed no conditions on money spent (I assume you ordered $40 foods or more with your $20 purchase, then you paid the tax and tips on top, for a minimal of $23.24). Rest voucher dictated you ordered twice as much and paid 18% tip, plus tax. For $25 voucher (you may pay $15 for it), you have to order $45 min of food. So the final total was about $49. What's my saving? If I've got the voucher for free, I still paid about $33. How much is my saving then? If I order the foods without the voucher, I would have paid about $49 too. What's wrong with this picture.

With this irritation aside, the foods were good. Not excellent, but tasty. I was surprised with a one-page Nepalese section. I have never tried Nepalese foods before. And I don't consume east Indian foods often. So we ordered Nepalese sampler $29.99 and a Tandouri chicken $14.99. There was also a Indian sampler for $30.99 available.

The portion on the sampler was so small (2 oz per metal cup) that I could easily finish by myself and still feel hungry. It came with 4 pieces of turkey dumpling, 2 oz red curry chicken (4 cubes), 2 oz vegetarian, 4 small pieces of skewed lamb (in 2 oz cup), 2 oz broth, 2 oz cucumber salad, 2 servings of 2 oz steamed rice, 3 small pieces of brown desserts, and one cut up Naan. Luckily we had Tandouri chicken to contribute a small space in our stomach; it came with 5 small pieces of thighs and drumstick with plenty of onions. I have to be honest, I don't have a fine palate for Indian cuisine. The Nepalese foods tasted like Indian foods.

Even though it tasted good, but I had similar or better at various cities. A meat sampler costs $12.99 and Tandouri chicken $8.99 during a visit to Flagstaff (I thought it was a bit pricey at the time comparing to the restaurant in SoCal excluding San Diego).

The service was plain ordinary. I can hardly understand our server's thick accent. I wound never have paid 18% tips on this kind of service.

The location was off the strip but in the midst of Asian commercial district. There were many Indian and some Filipino restaurants in the neighborhood.

So diners, beware what you are getting from Restaurant.com voucher. It feels like a scam to benefit the restaurants. Groupon is a better deal here. I feel the price is at least 50% more than other places, regardless Vegas charm or not. I won't be back for there is no knowledge gain but a bad overall experience and the worse value I have ever had for a long time.",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,1,0,2,98TP1B_dDZEw3sqPHkC_KA

I went during the lunch buffet and it was pretty good. 

I may be butchering the name of this because my phone autocorrected to Andrea and now I can't remember what it was called, but the Ankur? chicken curry was amazing. Chicken literally melted in my mouth. The flavor was perfect. By far my favorite item. The chicken chili was also pretty good. Pieces of chicken made with chopped up chunks of red and green bell peppers. Reminded me of chicken Jalfrezi.
Chicken Tikka Masala was a different color than I've normally seen. It was ok but I think I had a hard time getting past the way it looked. I just couldn't' eat it. I prefer mine to be more consistently creamy and a little darker in color. This one was almost the color of salmon.

The Chicken Ttandoori was as good as I've ever had before, definitely worth it. 
I didn't see Raita on the buffet line. I probably could have asked for it, but they were really busy and I didn't want to be a bother. 

I guess I was really thirsty because I finished my first glass of water quickly, instead of refilling it the server set a carafe of water on my table. Now that I think of it, he never asked me what I wanted to drink. Good thing I wanted water because that's what he brought me. 

The Naan could have been better. It seemed to be a little dry or hard. I don't think it was fresh. They were a lot of veggie/vegan options and the ones I tried were pretty good (Potato, Sag Aloo and a few others)

I basically looked up other people's reviews, and they all stated that this place was a must try. My mother's usual Indian buffet place, IHO, is just not very good. But she would always go there because it's ""what she knows,"" and she was comfortable with it. This day, I suggested we try someplace else, and she was open to it. As soon as we got there, she kept stating how everything was so good, even better than ""her"" Indiana buffet place!!

I ordered a Mango Lassi, and it was very good. Not as sweet as some I have had in the past, which is a plus. They have a small veggie/chutney/soup area. The food was hot and fresh. The tandoori chicken is delish. It is not the best I have had, but for buffet, it is really close. Throw a little mint chutney on it, a squeeze of lemon..... Mmmm. Yum.

They bring out hot, just-made Nan for you as well, which is very nice. I rip off pieces of the nan, and use my hands to scoop up my food. I am used to eating with my hands, since Africans also use a food (fufu) to scoop up other food with. I saw one other person eating with their hands there, so I felt a bit less weird doing it, but most used utensils.

The place looks little shady from outside, the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside. But don't worry it's a great place from inside. The decor is nice and upscale. It's a quite place, with comfortable seating. The lights could be brighter. There were few other table's occupied (All by Indians) - A good sight if you are looking for true Indian spicy food and not tamed down for the American population. 

The waiter was nice, pleasant and took out his iPhone while talking to us. Realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store. Also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time.

Coming to the main part! FOOD! It was really good. 
We ordered Mint Lassi and Masala Chhas. Both were very Indian and really tasty. 
Their Menu is very well organized. Great for Vegetarians and Vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans. Very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well. One of the best organized Menu's among all restaurants (Comparing to all Indian, American etc. restaurants).

For the main course we ordered Paneer Makhani, Daal Makhani and Chole With Naans. Everything was really good. Daal Was very tasty, although the color might make you think its not the best, but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home. Naan's were also very good.

3445692,2016-07-29,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"One of the 2nd year pediatrics residents who is Indian recommended Mint to me, so I decided to check it out. I came during lunch, during which food is served buffet style. It's a little pricier than most other Indian lunch buffets I've had ($12.99 here), but I will admit that the quality is quite good.

The interior is very sleek and clean, and the buffet area is kept very tidy. The restaurant has a good number of tables but isn't huge. I was the first diner to enter shortly after the opened at 11AM, but by the time I was finishing my meal around noon, the restaurant was almost completely full.

Since it's buffet style, there isn't a ton of waiter service, but servers would come by to collect my used plates. They give you water carafes so you can refill your water by yourself. You also get a choice of naan when you are seated, and the naan is made-to-order than brought to your table in a basket.

While there were no samosas or kheer during my visit today, I was surprised to see idli and bhel puri, two items that I rarely see at buffets. I especially enjoy bhel puri with all of its crunchy bits. =)

All the other dishes were good too, and there was a decent variety. They even snuck in one Indo-Chinese dish, chilli chicken. Surprisingly, the sweet chicken tikka masala was not that good (the sauce was a little overcooked and some of the yogurt had coagulated, plus the chicken was a bit tough), though the paneer tikka masala which has the same sauce base was much smoother. I was also surprised by the spice level of things that didn't look very spicy and that aren't that spicy when I've had them elsewhere (saag mushroom, daal). On the flip-side, the chicken vindaloo was just moderately spicy; go figure. Nothing was too spicy for me to handle, but some dishes were just packing unexpected heat.

I wouldn't mind coming back to try ordering off the menu. All in all, a solid and very clean Indian restaurant.

P.S. I was a bit alarmed when I saw all the recent one-star reviews on Yelp, but most of them seem to be centered around poor dinner service or takeout orders, and I came for buffet lunch.

New decor. Bigger restaurant. Same fabulous beer menu. Same silly menu. But the name has changed and there's now a lunch buffet.

Sadly, the new lunch buffet is almost all Indian food with little Himalayan or Nepalese. BUT....this is one of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas, and I'd even put it up there with some of the best Indian food in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This ain't your typical greasy Indian buffet. The food is fresh and delicious. This is one of the best budget restaurants in town and my old review gave them 4 stars, but I'm adding another star for the new, beautiful decor.

Old review: 
1) Why go to a Himalayan restaurant and get Indian food?
2) Maybe it's because this place has been under new ownership for about 9 months but at least half the menu is Nepalese/Himalayan food. Yes, there is Indian food on the menu. But I didn't eat any of it and you don't have to either unless you want to.
3) there is no lunch buffet anymore.

We had the Nepalese Sampler Platter (split one between two of us which was plenty of food for a not-heavy dinner) and it was wonderful! The only thing that looked even remotely Indian was the dessert.

We had some kind of black eyed pea dhal-ish kind of thing that was a bit bland but still nourishing and tasty.

A cucumber, potato, cilantro salad was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.

The lamb was scrumptious. I'm not huge on chicken but it was pretty good.
There was some kind of bamboo shoot salad that was oddly compelling. No clue what was in it.

And the momo! Oh man it is ALL ABOUT the MOMO!! I could eat these tasty dumplings all day long.

Phenomenal beer selection. Friendly owner. Great food.

If you like spice, don't ask for 5. The 5 was really quite mild.",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,7,4,5,Q4uLU-R1XnXKYGy05xzT-w

It was a very similar day to my previous review. Copious laundry yet to be folded and lazy me coerced my husband to thinking that we need to partake in Mint's buffet this last Saturday. I remembered a message one of the owners of Mint had sent me letting me know that they had taken my previous review into consideration and created a better buffet. It's a rare occasion that small business owners give you positive reactions on a negative review so I was impressed enough to give Mint another chance. 

Wow...the 2 of us were truly surprised (in a really good way) and absolutely enjoyed this buffet. There was a thin tomato soup that was tangy and a prolific salad/chutney assortment. Also their Dal Tadka was to die for. I filled multiple bowls of this delicacy. The pakoras (Indian vegetable tempura) were excellent. Special shout out to the thinly slivered potatoes coated with the garbanzo flour mixture. Yumminess. Soft and airy idlis with a thick and tasty sambar (the best in Vegas thus far) spoke to the South Indian in me. There was lemon rice that was full of flavor and their spicy chau chau noodles that were oh-so-perfect and what I am currently salivating about. There were 3 vegetable dishes (one paneer) and at least 5 meat based dishes on the buffet. Garlic Naans/Plain Naans/Rotis were brought to the table with the blink of an eye. 

Now for the grand finale. Dessert...my eyes popped when I saw they served Gulab Jamun (balls of dough and milk, deep fried and served in sugar syrup). The Gulab Jamuns were warm, melt in the mouth and probably the best I've had out here. Dessert Nirvana. 

Mint pulled out all the stops at their new buffet and I for one, will be a repeat customer as long as I get my belly filled like this. For 9.99, this was a stellar deal and of course, the service was just as impeccable as before with the nice waiters.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,8,6,5,1KZHWyor03a4DT46NPlGWw

Since I didn't want to have Indian food that I could eat anywhere else, I opted to try something from Tibet or Nepal. Since their lunch specials were mostly Indian, I ordered from the menu. 

The Tibetan/Nepalese section was rather sparse in comparison to the Indian section and chose one of two vegan options. I ordered the Chau Chau which was a flavorful blend of noodles and vegetables with chili paste. The dish was pretty good though I wish there was more variety than just noodles and was happy that I chose the half order which was sufficient enough to fill my stomach and left me craving for dessert. The half order was similarly priced as the lunch special. They offered one vegan dessert option which was absolutely amazing. I tried the Gajar Haluwa which is a carrot ""pudding"" that consisted of carrots chopped up very small and sweetened by its own juices mixed with raisins. Apparently nuts were also in the ""pudding"" though I didn't see any. Their red tea peach iced tea was also delicately sweetened and refreshing for the hot weather. 

The atmosphere is alright. It is a lot more casual than it looks on their website. Their right wall is under construction pending a Lassi bar and they use paper napkins instead of fancy napkins.

While ordering food we weren't sure if we were under or over ordering and when we asked the server he wasn't helpful at all. The food waiting time told to us was 40-50 mins and the reason told to us was that the restaurant was very busy. The food was terrible . Malai kofta was very hard and didn't taste at all like the dish is supposed to be. Aloo tikki was buried in the sea of uncooked pea curry. Pao bhaji was smelling bad.

The papri chat was insipid, one could only taste yogurt, no seasoning. In fact the papri smelled ""old"". The entree, malai kofta was overwhelmingly sweet. The koftas barely had any paneer or what is known as cottage cheese, which it is supposed to have. The ""rotis"" or flatbread were burnt, we could barely bite into it. Rather we had to pull it apart.
 These people don't seem to care their customers either. We kept waiting for someone to come and take our order. 
We were very disappointed with their food and service. The only thing that was good was the papad served at the very beginning. These people seriously need to taste their own food and then change their cook. Doesn't seem like the owners know the taste of the food that comes out of their restaurant's kitchen.

3541981,2011-03-14,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I've been here many times for dinner, but not buffet.  This review is for the lunch buffet.

There were many items in the buffet line, ranging from vegetarian to meat courses. 

The quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now.  I love goat karahi.  I have been to many Indian restaurants where the goat karahi isn't consistent.  I know I can count on Mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful.  I mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers, then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more. It was delicious, and the naan was great as well.  

However, goat karahi wasn't the only star on today's menu (according to me, of course).  I have tried tandoori chicken at many places, but I find it lacks flavor.  When Debbie said that the tandoori chicken is her favorite, I decided to grab a piece to give it a try.  Boy was I glad Debbie raved about it.  It was SOOOOO GOOOOD!  I tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic naan. I then dipped it into the tamarind chutney and wala, yummy-in-my-tummy.  

I was full at this point, but still had to eat my favorite dessert, khir.  I was super excited to see this in the  buffet line.  I love the basmati rice, slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom.  I got two servings, one for Roland, and one for myself.  Somehow, they both ended up being consumed by me...Oops...Khir...I can't help myself.

I also had the Lal Mohan.  Again, tried this at other places, never liked it.  Luckily, Debbie also raved about this so I gave it a shot...thank goodness I tried it because it is DELICIOUS.

3577080,2012-06-25,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I've been here a number of times for their lunch buffet and I've generally been pleased.  Mint seats about 60-70, though it feels like a smaller place and even though it's been busy I've only had to wait for a table once.  

The buffet doesn't seem to change and has a lot of the standard Indian fare.  It's usually kept well stocked and usually things aren't dried out from having sit out too long.  The chicken tikka masala seems a tad watery, but the chicken quality is top notch.  Chicken chili and tandoori chicken are also favorites, along with the masala rice.  

The service is generally good, mainly because of the smallish size of the place and the fact they seem to have 5 servers running around almost constantly.  That said, there have been a few times I've needed to flag someone down to get more water or the check, though it's not much of a hassle and considering it's a buffet I can't really expect them to fully know when to bring the check.  

The one real hitch in the buffet service is the delivery of naan.  As soon as you come in the servers generally ask you what type of naan you want (plain, buttered, garlic, maybe some other types?).  A couple of times I have not been asked and had to bring it up myself.  Regardless, I've usually sat down, gone to the buffet, gotten a plate of food, eaten that entire plate of food, and gone up for a second plate before the naan is delivered.  Sometimes I've had the wrong naan delivered as well, though in that case they gave me some plain naan and then later brought the correct garlic naan later with no extra charge.  

The buffet is $10.99 pre-tax, or $11.88 after tax which is a good value considering the quality and how much everyone likes this place.  They have a normal menu if you aren't there for the lunch buffet and I imagine the food is even better.  They have an ""Inferno"" menu of super spicy items if you're so inclined.  There is also a lassi bar of some sort, though I haven't had it.

I'm on the fence about whether Mint deserves 4 or 5 stars, but considering if I drive by the place and I'm hungry I automatically go there, I'll give it a 5.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,4,2,5,owNOc4waD8E-pVGzVS35uA

Vegetable Pakodas- Fried veggie chips with plenty of flavor

Lentil the chef's way- Lentil soup. Very tasty had a hint of Cilantro that was outstanding

The lamb and chicken dishes were so warm, flavorfull and comforting. I only chose level 4 spice not knowing how hot it would be.

3618247,2013-03-26,9,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Mint Indian Bistro easily earns 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up to 5 stars because A. Yelp doesn't offer a half star review option and B. Mint's huge menu offers so much potential, I can easily see it going to 5 stars depending on what you order from here. and C. I'm easy to please.

This was our first dining out experience in Vegas. Despite what the directions may say to walk here if you're coming from the north on Paradise, don't venture off of Paradise until you reach E. Flamingo. The neighborhood gets real rough, real quick. Was it worth the short walk through the hood? You best believe!

This is everything Udupi Palace http://www.yelp.com/biz/udupi-palace-berkeley in The Bay Area should be and more. Service is quite good. The menu, in addition to being massive, is well labeled with what's Vegan and what's not. On top of being easy to distinguish between what's Vegan, the majority of dishes are offered in a Vegan and non-vegetarian version as well. While I appreciate that the menu is expansive, I was a little confused since it's laid out according to region. I'm not the biggest Indian food expert so I needed to comb through it to find what I was looking for. It seems to me it would be easier to navigate if it were separated by meat, veg, and so on. 

The Popular Pakoda are delicious little fried buggers full of shredded veggies. Their mint and tamarind chutneys are both very tasty. As a certified condiment whore I can say they're as good as you'll find at most places around.

I love Malai Kofta, but haven't had it in years since I've never seen it made Vegan at any of the Indian restaurants I've been to. Once I saw they offered that, I was a happy boy. It wasn't quite as spicy as I was hoping, but it had a good creamy flavor with soft dumplings as a centerpiece. I'm sure if I asked them to bump up the spice level, it would be excellent. It also comes with a complimentary side of rice, which is a rarity nowadays.

Speaking of spice level. They offer to spice most things on a 1-10 scale. I'll have to come back to get my photo on the Inferno Wall of Fame by downing the Inferno Curry. I'll just be sure to pick up some throat numbing spray as was recommended to me by an expert in the subject matter. If I have to sign a waiver to eat something, I'm bringing my ""A"" game!

The Curry Pineapple Rice was alright. It wasn't mind blowing or anything. I would order something else in it's place. Especially since they already include plain rice with some of the entrees.

We ordered the Pistachio Kulfi as a dessert thanks to it's description. I was thinking it was a Vegan ice cream but it was much more icey. Not in a terrible way though. A little different but still good.

The Paratha was really good filled with potatoes and peas. It had a nice smoky taste on the verge of being burnt, but not all the way there yet.

For some reason in all my visits to Indian restuarants I've never once ordered a Lassi that I can remember. Even during my dark Vegetarian years when I was eating everything BUT meat. My dining partner encouraged me to order one since we've never seen a Vegan version. I went with peach, which I think was a great choice. I thought I was getting the alcoholic version from the ""Lassi Bar"" but it wasn't according to the receipt. It was still really good, like a more refreshing, less heavy milkshake. Very recommended! 

It's not cheap, but you get all this food in nice looking digs for not too much coin http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mint-indian-bistro-las-vegas?select=MPGTXF3oXowuVnbHZcwE0A#GpkSqhM7xSy7PExgzZwQbg

The food here has been fantastic every time we've come.  Sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find parking, so just be aware that you might have to park further away than you might like (it can be a rough neighborhood).  Still, the food is totally worth a stroll through a dangerous neighborhood.  For real.

When we first came here, we thought our server was being REALLY rude, because he was looking at his cell phone while we ordered.  Turns out, this is how they input the orders, and they all have fancy iPhones to do it.  This is actually helpful, because they never screw up your order, which has happened to me at other Indian places in town.

The only thing that sort of bothered me last time was that they dramatically decreased the size of their kheer (the price went down, too).  It's like a little shot glass now.  Totally not worth the decreased price of $2.99.  Should be at least a dollar less for how tiny it is!

Atmosphere: it's busy! But in a good way. Lots of people are always waiting but they don't cram you in and are happy to sit two people in a booth. (Some places will make you wait for a smaller table). The restaurant is clean and well kept, and the staff keep it cleaned during your meal.

3664811,2012-12-27,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"My husband and I went here on a Wednesday evening around 6 p.m.  The restaurant was fairly busy with both dine-in customers and a to-go line.  They also seemed understaffed, and worst of all, the waiters use iPads to take your order, which seemed to be more of a burden for them than a time-saver.  Our waiter seemed like he cared but was overwhelmed.  Some other members of the staff, however, seemed the opposite.

Part of the reason we tried this Indian restaurant was because it has a full bar.  Unfortunately, simple mixed drinks took between 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table.  I would not recommend ordering any of the more elaborate drinks on the menu because the wait time would probably be even longer.

We ordered naan, an appetizer, and two entrees.  They brought out the naan first, then 10-15 minutes later, only one entree.  Then we waited about ten minutes for the second entree.  Thankfully, we were sharing both things, or this would've been way awkward.  At this point, we still hadn't received our appetizer, so we asked the waiter to please cancel it.

The food was actually quite great.  We ordered the Chef's special lamb kabob and the Vertical Vindaloo with chicken thigh, and they were both excellent.  The vindaloo was not saucy enough for my liking, and the ""Full"" size was rather small for the price.  Other than that, we weren't disappointed by the actual food, despite its strange delivery times.",CTU350iuYij8uUe7qNNq3Q,2,0,2,920rIwpTIdpe-zIu1qsuGA

My husband and father tried the Inferno challenge- which is a challenge to eat whatever you want at the Inferno spice level made with ghost chilis. They did not complete the challenge, but my father took his portion home and used the delicious based to flavor home cooked meals.

Our orders were taken on an iPad mini where every possible alteration to any dish is already programmed into the app that they use. I believe that they also have an app that you can download on your smart phones to order before coming into the restaurant. Sweet!!

So when in a panic of needing Indian food and needing it now, I met my girl Jaime W for some AYCE yums. 

When we arrived, we were given menus. ""WTF FOR?!?"" I thought. It turns out that in addition to their delicious lunch buffet, they have a hefty selection of drinks, alcoholic and non. Next time. 

I started off wrong by getting a small plate instead of the bigass one necessary for all Indian food pursuits. It didn't take me long to fill it up. I did not care for the green salad--too peppery--but hey, that's the beauty of the buffet. Chutneys all were so winning, especially combined with any of the other various items on the buffet. You can't go wrong with mango chutney and paneer tikka masala, amirite? 

The menu is SuperMenu, so clearly marked for anybody with dietary restrictions. My only dietary restriction is having only one stomach so I'm not concerned about vegetarian/vegan/gluten free but if that's your bag, here's your place.

I had stopped down the street at India Masala for Dosa Tuesday, only to find out their chef quit and they're no longer serving South Indian food. So I left and came here.

First thing that caught my eye was one their first page of the menu, inferno naan. YESSSS please. We were asked to sign a consent prior to ordering. What the? Made with ghost peppers and habanero chills, it came out looking so plain, but when you open up the naan, it was loaded with peppers.  I took one bite, it was horrid. I love spicy food, but I like a good taste with the spice. This was pure nastiness. I had to spit it out. My nose, lips and tongue immediately started burning, thankfully I had a full lassi in front of me that cooled down the heat. 

Onto the next one. I was excited to see that they served Northern and Southern Indian food. I ordered my favorite, Mysore Masala Dosa, red chili chutney and potatoes, and onions. This was by far the best dosa I have ever had. The chutney served with it was really good as well. 

We also ordered the lamb kabobs, these were nice and tender, great flavor too. Of course we had to order cheese naan, every americans favorite. I love naan. I could eat it for days.

The most exciting thing tho, they have a lassi bar! I tried the mango and rose lassi (two, don't judge). I love a good mango lassi. I've never seen a place have a lassi bar, there were so many different flavors to choose from. I will most likely be trying all of them. 

I like this place, a lot. Good Indian food. I like that they serve both cuisines. Kinda like when you go to a Thai place and you can get Northern and Southern style. I like options.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,10,7,5,V0lWJ5FFIfCl3dmgUIufjw

I was first pleased to see that we were the only folks there that didn't appear to be of Indian ancestry, my personal good sign indicator for ethnic fooderies. I was also pleased to see that it was pretty packed, but there was no wait to be seated. The decor was simple and elegant, with lots of blond wood and high backed booths. 

Service was spectacular, we had at least 5 very attentive and polite servers. They kept us up to date on the progress of each course, made sure our water was cold and plentiful, and inquired about our enjoyment. 

The menu was extensive, with both Himyl and Indian dishes. There was a lot of creativity involved, but the old standbys were also delish. I also liked that the menu let diners know what was veggie/vegan friendly.** Say yes to the samosas my friends. They are the best I have had.** All dishes were at a fair price, and I really liked that you could order half-dishes at a reduced cost. This was especially important when you have no microwave in your hotel, and you were taught not to waste food. Me and the BF were really pleased with our dishes, and two half plate entrees were more than enough food to share and be stuffed--but not too stuffed due to the half portions. I may also have to mention that they serve Frambois, and I would cut someone to have that delicious fizzy nectar.

I went here with my fiancee for lunch as we both were craving Indian and heard it had a buffet going on. Her being a picky eater and me on a see-food diet (I see food, I eat it) I thought a buffet would satisfy both our needs. Although the choice on the buffet might not be as extensive as some casino lines, what they had to offer were all amazing. A case of quality over quantity. You can't go wrong with any dishes. I have tried curries from the east coast and west coast and even in India. This place can easily compete with some of the best curries I've had. (Try the paneer curry! So good. It is cheese btw.)

The wait staff were polite and quick with a fresh basket of garlic or non garlic naan so you can happily wipe your plate clean. Their fruit lassis are suspected, probably made with flavoring liquor.

The first page of the new menu is the Inferno menu.  All dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers.  You have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server RS told us.  There's one challenge that if you finish, you get your photo on their Wall of Fame and you get a $50 Mint gift card for future use.  I don't think it's accepted by any hospitals.  (Michael K, this might be something you'd want to try!)

In addition, the new menu has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds.  There are so many things to try it seems like a good UYE with 5 or 6 people to share the items.

For tonight, I chose the Vertical Vindaloo with lamb.  The menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want--cheese, lamb, veggies, goat (bone in), swordfish, shrimp--and you choose your spiciness from 1 to 10.  I chose 
7 and I could have had more spice.  8 or 9 next time.  My wife ordered the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast (again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo).  She chose a spiciness of 3.  We also got an order of buttered garlic naan.

Everything was excellent!  The vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful.  There were cut potatoes in the sauce, too.  My wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier.  Wow, are we going to 4 or 5 next time?  What happened to my gabacha?  The naan was the tastiest we've had here.  It wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart.

After dinner, she got khir and I pistachio kulfi.  I've had the khir before and while good, I wanted to try something different.  The pistachio ice cream was really, really good.  
I asked RS if it was made in house or could I go to the Indian store and get it out of the freezer.  Sure enough, it's made in house.  There goes that idea for a repeat.

RS was quite a pleasant server!  He refilled my iced tea when I was getting low and he gave us chance to look over the menu with no hurry and then was ready to answer any questions.

You'll see that I frequent Indian restaurants fairly regularly wherever I travel, so I know what I like and how it compares to other establishments. 

My family and I decided to go with the Chef's Northern India tasting menu and were given a plethora of different dishes, though with smaller than normal portions. We all enjoyed the pakora (they called them pakodas) and again thought we were in for the best Indian meal in a long time. That being said, the lamb vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb (and it was tougher than it should have been), the chicken tikka masala had great flavor; but was more masala than chicken, and the daal was good, but just a tad undercooked. I was also disappointed when I asked for a ""6-7 spicy"" I received something more like a 2 or 3. They do have something they call Inferno chili sauce, but I thought my dishes came from a very universal pot that's geared to less spice (and flavor). As other reviewers have noted, their naan bread is excellent. Service was satisfactory, but I never felt like I was being ""served"" meaning it was more obligatory than driven.

We ordered one of the chef's tasting menus (Lumbini Vegan Prix Fixe) which was perfect -- we were able to try several dishes and loved all but one.  The Vegetable Korma was my favorite dish.

The most surprising part of the tasting menu was the dessert.  The Gajar Halwa (Carrot Pudding) is cold, spice-laden and delicious.  I think it's flavored with cardamom and nutmeg.  Yes, this sounds weird, but trust me -- it was great!   And it is vegan -- no dairy.  Perfectly yummy!

I'd tried their Desi Burrito concept last week, but Mint Indian Bistro is what I should've done all along. My co-workers wanted to squeeze it into our lunch hour, so we hurried over for the $12.99 lunch buffet, offered 11am-4pm daily.

My first impression was that the buffet line isn't the biggest, but it still had plenty to offer. Clean plates and bowls are in the back corner near the salad, sauces, and soups. Vegetarian options are next if you follow the line down, and meat dishes (mostly chicken) are nearest to the seating area.

The food was quite impressive overall. Carbs from the Vegetable Fried Rice and the Vegetable Chau Chau, a soft noodle dish that their web site states to be from Tibet. The veggie Pakoda were a nice fried treat that didn't seem too greasy. Goat curry was tender enough and tasty, if a bit annoying to eat with all the bones. Pretty much everything chicken was yummy, but the tandoori chicken is most likely the best, moistest version of it that I've had - and it's at a lunch buffet. Don't forgot to grab the veggies served on that tray either. Finally, don't forget the decadent gulab jamun for dessert. They're kinda like wet/soft, sugary, soaked donuts, and they're served very hot here.

The negatives weren't that much of an issue for me, but I have to mention that the service was very spotty. We were through eating our first plates by the time that they brought out the water, and considering that a couple of dishes are mildly spicy, it would've been nice to have relief earlier. The garlic naan took even longer - even considering that they tasted freshly cooked, you'd think that they'd just keep pumping them out during lunch rush. Even the check took a couple of minutes to arrive after we finally flagged someone down, and we ended up walking to the register to pay.

Also, the naan were the one food that I had a quibble with. Although they were crispy, flaky, and served hot, they were undersalted if eaten alone.

I wish I hadn't had my first meal at Mint Indian Bistro during a rushed lunch hour, but it was still delicious. I'd say it's fine if you have at least 45 minutes, not accounting for drive time. If I catch the Indian food bug, Mint would definitely be on my rotation.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,7,4,jjy_yt_xI04IlpW2o7aQYQ

The place was decorated in black and grays that gave it a chic feel.  The service was awesome and our water glasses were never empty.

-Buttered Garlic Naan - came out fresh and warm, dipping sauces that came with it were delicious as well ($3.49)
-Rebel Curry - excellent, got it with the chicken ($13.99)
-Tikka Masala - so creamy, yet spicy, got it with the chicken ($13.99)

I was super lucky and was there at the right place at the right time as there was a spot open waiting for me to take it right in front of the restaurant. Locating this place isn't too bad. It's directly across from the Atomic Museum. Or in between Jack in the Box and the Coffee Cup thingy north side of Flamingo. 

Anyway I actually give this place a 4.5. And that's because the service here is PHENOMENAL. And as us Eliterati like to say sometimes a place will have 2-3 star food but when the service is outstanding it can easily bring that up to a 4-5. Hmmmm now that I ponder on that I'm making Mint sound like the food sucks! Lol okay okay the food here is great too! Maybe I should make it a full 5 stars!?! 

Lunch buffet is $12/person which includes the naan. I'm a naan lover so I went ""all out"" and ordered the garlic one. LOVE! They have the basic Indian cuisine: tandoori, masala, salad, chick pea green stuff, pinkish mashed stuff, yellow curry-ish stuff (wowwwwww I'm excellent at naming Indian cuisine)! *sigh 

Alright alright yes they do have all the basics. And I ate a bit of everything to maximize my buffet option and everything was real yummy. Selection is maybe about 10 different trays of hot food and the salad bar. They have a consistent flow of eaters so that's more confirmation that this place rocks. 

But what rocked the most was the staff who was very accommodating, friendly and quoting my girlfriend whom I dined with ""cute"". ;)",FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,0,0,4,bpZ416D8KzGoWhVmvPIkRA

The location is kinda weird, in a small strip mall with a close proximity to Jack in the Box's dump. Once you get inside, though it's très chic. Clean and modern, with funky art hung up on the walls. 

For appetizers we had the garlic naan with makhani sauce and the organic samosas, along with some lassis to drink. I had the mango rum and my friend had the lychee rum. The mango was thick from the puree and yoghurt, and a little too strong from the rum, but good overall. The lychee one was perfect! Both the  naan and samosas were delicious, but the garlic naan was my favorite, and the spicy makhani sauce : )

The entrees we went with were the veggie tikka masala (8/10 spicy) and lamb vindaloo (10/10 spicy) with basmati rice. The veggies were perfectly cooked, the lamb was tender and flavorful. Sauce was well seasoned, and the spice definitely matched the level. 10/10 had my nose running, but it's all good, the pain let's me know I'm alive hahaha. I'm gonna need to train if I'm gonna try the inferno curry challenge (which according to the server is at a 110/10. Basmati was ok, but next time I'm getting extra garlic naan to have with my meal. 

DESSERT! We were fat kids and ordered 6 of the mini desserts, because they were sold out of the 7th one. So! We got the Khir (rice pudding), Gulab Jamun (milk based pastry steeped in syrup), Pistachio and Mango Kulfi (ice cream), Mango Custard, and Gajar Halwa (carrot pudding [like, steamed pudding, not jello]). All so good, even after stuffing our faces with food prior. The gajar halwa and gulab jamun were too sweet for me, though.

4300165,2010-09-25,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Before you read the review, you must understand a few things.
1) This is the only ""Indian/Nepalese"" place I've eaten at in Vegas
2) The only other ""Indian"" food I've had has been homemade by ethnic Indians or at Diwali events. 
3) I am not an expert in either of these two cuisine types, but I do like good food. 

We came here for a dinner with some friends. We had a friend in from China, and since she likes to eat, we decided on a place where we can try something new, while socializing. We also know that Indian food meets many different dietary wants and needs, and this place has decent reviews and reasonable prices, so we came to Mint. 

We arrived at 7pm to a very clean and modern dining room. The dining area was a little over half full. The clientele seemed very diverse with a mix of cultures and varying levels of dress. 

Mint easily accommodated our party of 12, which was nice. We had a nice big table and were not cramped, nor did we cramp the other tables around us. The staff seemed friendly enough. However, we were waiting for 2 members of our party to arrive for about 30 minutes, but our waiters never asked for drink or app orders. That wasn't a huge issue, but once we ordered apps and drinks our waiter didn't ask us for our dinner orders for about another 30-45 minutes. We were all engaged in conversation, which I guess could have encouraged the waiter not to ask us. Overall, we were there for 3 hours, and the service was only so so.

The food was good. The wife and I shared the vegetarian sampler platter. Everything we had was distinctive, flavorful, and delicious. I don't know Indian/Nepalese food too well, so I can't say how authentic it was or was not, but it was pleasing to my palate. We asked for a level 7 spice, but I am pretty sure the waiter did not accommodate that as our food was not too spicy. We like heat, and only one of our dishes had a bit of heat. 

I was very impressed with 2 things: 1) The wide selection and friendliness towards vegans and vegetarians. We had more selections than we knew what to do with. I am really excited to go back to Mint just to try some more.
2) Beer selection: There is a great selection of Indian and European beers here. They range in price from $5-$19 a bottle, but they have selections here I've not seen anywhere else in Vegas. Additionally, they do have a ""beer of the month"" which they sell cheaper than the others. This month the beer is a very good Belgian White (the brand escapes me).

Overall, it was a good experience (other than the service), but I think I will be back.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,3,0,3,E8xVow-KdCKEUnejfVvFHg

That's not the problem here.  Their food is really, really good Indian food.  Probably some of the best I've had!

The problem is with how they run/manage their buffet.  This is what will keep me away, unfortunately :(  So it's $13 per person for their buffet, which isn't bad, however, I have a FIVE YEAR OLD son that they want to charge us 8.99 for (which, for some reason, they explain as being ""half price"" even though the math doesn't add up there..).

Here's the problem, I tried telling the people working, my son will NOT eat ANYTHING besides a plate of rice.  Literally.  That's it.  Even though *I* love their food, my son is such a picky eater (moms, I know you feel me!) and all he will eat is rice.  

I see no reason why I should pay $9 for my child to eat a plate of rice.  It's really ridiculous that they won't take the time to listen or understand.  Why can't they just charge me what they'd normally charge for a side of rice?  That would be so simple.  I get it, they don't know me, and they don't know that's really all my son will eat - so WATCH US!  LOL!  

Anyway, I wish I could eat here, but call me stubborn, an $9 plate of plain rice isn't worth it to me :/",C-O1hKW7_ZIA3kZbQg0WmQ,2,0,2,ABNOwmPUtTnbtBP5_-jItQ

Although their menu is quite large, they offer a useful & effective ordering system - Aside every menu item comes a list of options for how you would like your order prepared (i.e. with or without butter, onions, garlic), what you would like in it (cheese, veggies, chicken, lamb, fish), & the size/ cost (half or full order on some things), etc. with a really cute/ funny description of each dish. Some key symbols you will see throughout the menu are ""V"" for Vegetarian, ""Vn"" for Vegan, ""G"" for Gluten-free, ""J"" for Jain (w/out onions & garlic), & ""N"" for nut-related products, as well as ""H"" for choices that are considered healthy. Although this may not be of concern to some people, I found it to be very helpful & this made it much easier for me to order my food exactly how I wanted it. 
For my dinner, I tried the Vertical Vindaloo w/ Fresh Veggies & Veggie Tikka Masala Curries w/ Paratha. I enjoyed both dishes & was really glad I went with the Paratha instead of the usual Naan since I love Whole Wheat products & wanted to try something different. Also, I love that they carry brown basmati rice & even give you a side of regular white basmati rice when you order curry, as most places I've been to have not done this. But, keep in mind that half orders of curry are probably smaller than you might think, so it's probably best to place full orders since their dishes are so good anyway! In addition to the rice & noodle dishes, soups & salads, & curries, they also have some good-looking dosas & condiments like tomato, mango, or coconut chutney for only 1$ :) 
Our service was very nice & attentive too; We had multiple people check on us throughout our meal & each brought us everything we asked for w/out any problems. I had a really good experience here & can't wait to come back!",3XUocxsfbFMS13fLyJlp0A,1,0,5,7JmzlhUbTFThLG2PB1LFaw

This restaurant has such a wide variety of curries of non-vegan and vegan selections.  
Their buffet runs from 11am-3pm and might i say, something everyone should become very familiar with.  The buffet is only $12 and it comes with such a variety of foods, it's such a steal!  Considering I came here for dinner and ordered chicken tikka masala (buttered chicken) and naan; the bill came out to about $18.  The buffet includes chicken/vegetable tikka masala, tandoori chicken, basmati rice, bone-in lamb curry and more dishes i can't pronounce.
It includes normal and garlic naan! 
The curry is packed with so much flavor, the naan comes out freshly made (HOT), the meat of the tandoori and chicken tikka masala is slightly dry but other than that I really can't complain. Food is an A- for me.

The only complaint I have is for dinner; their portions are a bit small for what you pay for but nonetheless still very tasty.

Service is spot on and punctual whenever you're out of drink, naan or if you have empty plates; oh yeah their naan is refillable!  Our server was extremely friendly, wasn't overbearing and took care of us throughout the whole dinner.

Ambiance was very warm, lights dim but not dungeness and with trending indian songs to add culture to a very modern looking restaurant.

That was a modestly spicy curry with a sweet tang to it just as promised. The  stuffed paratha has some potato and peas, but not enough for my Indian colleague's liking ;).

This place is also a hidden gem for beer. The beer menu is extensive, but there were also an additional 15 beers recently added! ""Take a look before you choose"", said our waiter as he pointed to the table with 20 beer bottles on. So I did. And came back with a pint bottle of Belgian lager. Very nice with my mango chicken.

Try this place. I didn't try the buffet. All in all, the portions are good - my colleague and I shared the curry and rice and we had paratha each. I had a beer too and the bill was $38 incl tip. The decor isn't as nice as the Nepalese place in Pasadena, CA, but it's pleasant enough.

I have too many five-star reviews, so I changed the way I rate places. I'm more critical now and an establishment has to go way above and beyond expectations or be the best I've had in its category. Unfortunately, Mint Indian Bistro is THE best Indian food I have EVER had, period!

I know, my life sucks! All I want to do is give a critical review, but I keep having outstanding experiences.

When I opened the menu and saw dosas in the appetizers, I knew I was about the experience something special. Dosas!!! My use of redundant punctuation should indicate the percentage exceeding one-hundred that represents how much I love a good dosa!!! Mint has giant flaky dosas filled with many different types of awesomeness.

Both Southern and Northern Indian recipes are included on the menu, as well as Tibetan and Nepalese entree selections. I know of nothing like this back home in Seattle. If someone else does, please tell me! This place was great from beginning to end. 

I don't do dessert at Indian restaurants so I can't speak to that, but I did have a delicious Blackberry Lassi which I can say served a dual purpose as dessert/beginning of the evening cocktail.

They have a lunch buffet, but I didn't get to do that since my friend is a bit of a germophobe about buffets. 

So, in conclusion, best, awesome, great, and delicious! I'll have to wait another day at different restaurant to be comfortably critical. I can always go back to Chutney's back home, I guess.",LEVHqrU8bJl2TXd6hKmo3A,2,2,5,GUU4jUDp5R7_92-yZwoqiQ

I tried this restaurant for their lunch buffet.   Overall, I was not impressed. The buffet itself was of average size. I found nothing to be spectacular. They had about 3 vegetarian dishes, 3 or 4 chicken dishes, and one goat curry dish.   Nothing I had tasted bad but I did not find any of the items particularly good either.   The tandoori chicken and chicken massala were average at best. The goat curry was mainly bones.   Thankfully they had a container for additional hot sauce so I was able to spice things up a bit. If I lived in town I can't say that I would return to this restaurant.  It looks like Las Vegas has many Indian restaurants with lunch buffets. I will be eager to try somewhere new next time I am in town.",bEhMouPlen6PdN-yeZa2Lg,0,0,3,ib5CdJx9f-bR1slFR68otA

The lunch buffet is what I usually go here for. With the UNLV discount, it is an affordable and tasty option.

During the daytime, the interior looks bright and airy. At night it has a moody romantic atmosphere. The servers are always friendly and I'm so glad they are very accommodating for people with food allergies. The menu is clearly labeled with icons indicating Veg/GF/Nuts/Etc.

Onto the food! Goat curry and any paneer dish are the things I make a beeline for. The goat is tender and full of flavor every time I come here.

For dinner, I usually get takeout on my way home. I've tried the Rebel Curry, Saag, Rogan Josh, and a few others. There's lots to try here.

  They are very accommodating on anything else that you want to eat with it, they brought him yogurt, milk, Salt and sugar in separate bowls, which I have never seen before and even some mango putting...he drank some Pepto-Bismol after and still had issues five hours after eating the curry.

I LOVE Indian cuisine, it is one of my favorite foods when going out to eat, I pick it over almost anything else. There are a lot of good Indian restaurants in the area, and one absolutely incredible one. But Mint, I wouldn't even call it fair. It's not true Indian cuisine. It's in the horribly ghetto parking lot near Mr. Beijing on Flamingo, but the restaurant itself inside is extremely nice and clean, only reason it's getting two stars. The service is absolutely horrendous, some of the worst service I've had at any restaurant in the Las Vegas area. I always go to Indian restaurants at lunch because of their lunch buffets which is nice so you can experience many different foods rather than just one entree, and its generally a really good deal. Mint had the same sort of setup, so I began at the buffet. The options here were really really weird, there were some Asian inspired choices and everything seemed very Americanized, not your traditional Indian restaurant. I remained optimistic. The food was not good, no spice, no real flavor in their tikka masala/butter chicken. The naan was absolutely horrendous, worst naan I've had. How can you mess up bread? Super weird.

The food is very authentic and to be very honest they serve some of the best Indian food in the country. The only downside is the service. During my multiple visits what I have observed is that they are understaffed. Just one server most of the times taking orders! And I guess that level of stress have made them to act rude sometimes.

4488950,2010-09-02,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"My friends and I were looking for a place to have dinner on Saturday night in Las Vegas. One of the girls looked up this place on her iphone and we decided to give it a try after we saw the raving reviews on Yelp. 

Food: I ordered a chicken saag paneer (aka chicken with spinach) and it came with an order of rice. I also ordered some garlic naan (Indian bread). The total for both including a 22% tip was $20 bucks. I had water with my meal. Food was great and the ingredients tasted fresh. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had since I've had comparable and better in the Bay Area (California) excluding price or portion. 3.5-4 stars for the food.

Service: Service could be improved. We asked if we could get out of the restaurant within an hour when we ordered. Waiter was eager and enthusiastic about getting us out on time to our 10pm show. 1 hour later (9pm), food barely started arriving. We ate quickly and was able to get out around 9:30pm. Considering that there weren't mainly people besides us (granted there was 1 large party and a couple small tables), they could have and should have been much faster at getting our orders out. Slow and not that responsive. 2 stars.

Location: It's off strip and cost our party about $10 dollars from the Flamingo to the restaurant. Considering the cost of strip food, the taxi ride breaks it even. Keep in mind that you must call for a cab or else it's rather difficult to catch a cab back onto the strip. Try to get the cab company # beforehand and call 15 minutes before you plan to leave the restaurant so that one will show up 15 minutes later (maybe make that 20 minutes considering ours was ""late""-- even though we called 30 minutes in advance. 10 minutes passed its prime, we decided to flag another cab.

Ambiance: Average. Nothing out of the ordinary. A bit dark in some areas as well, but without justification for mood.

We started off with drinks I had the Rose Lassi. The rose flavor was really delicate ..it  didn't taste like I was consuming a rose garden. My husband had the Pomegranate Martini. He thought it was a little strong and so did I but I don't think that taste can be avoided when you are mixing juice with Vodka. I've had a Martini made with Baileys before ....I think that's more my speed. I don't think it was a true Martini but the taste is much smoother. 

I ordered the half order of Lamb Biryani $9.99. It was good but while I was eating it I came across some very strong spices. You know the feeling when you accidentally bite into a peppercorn..it felt like that but I'm not sure what type of spice it was. It looked like a miniature piece of a tree branch but the tender lamb made up for it. 

My husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad $5.99. The seasonal veggies that came with salad were super fresh. Good size cucumbers tomatoes, and chicken ...beautiful colors. It tasted good too! It's perfect for a late night snack that will not weigh you down. It tasted even better when you put some of the salad on the Naan and roll it up. My husband agreed that I know what I'm talking about it because he liked it . That's no easy feat. 

We wanted to try some dessert so I ordered the Mango Kulfi. It's basically a milky mango ice cream. It's not sour like a sorbet... it was pretty tasty. My husband went out of his vanilla box of his basic dessert choices .... he also had no choice because there is no ice cream sundaes here! He ordered the Lal Mohan which looked kind of like like juicy brown eggs. I thought the he might be scared off by it but he tried it and like it. I tried some too . If you are the type that doesn't like too much syrup on your french toast then this may not be for you. I'm one of those people. These are milk based pastries drowning in syrup. It was cool trying something new though. 

The service was awesome ! Our waiter helped us decide on the desserts . He genuinely cared what we thought of the food...which was refreshing.

The cold bar had varius kinds of churney, a salad, some fruit, and other sauces.  There were also 3 different kinds of soup.  A tomato soup that tasted a bit sour, a lentil based soup, and a spicy soup.

Its got a lot of the standard Indian fare.  What stood out to me was the goat curry.  The goat meat was fall off the bone tender and the curry had an excellent flavor.  Also, the tandoori chicken was nice and juicy.... not dry like a lot of other joints.  The paneer sagg (a spinach and cheese dish) was also pretty good.

I tried just about every hot dish that was out and I have to say that most were too spicy. But I did find a few that weren't and they were absolutely delicious! The Paneer Tikka Masala was probably my favorite, but the Vegetable Korma and Chicken Tandoori were great as well! 

They also offer a little salad bar and some desserts. The naan is brought to the table fresh - you even have a choice between plain or garlic!

The place was clean and ambiance was fitting. We had a coupon that we bought on restaurant.com and that is what our deciding factor for this establishment.  

The service was polite and friendly.  No complaints in that department.  

The menu was substantial, but as I get older I find that places with such a large menu yet tiny place, often miss the mark when it comes to execution of full flavor of their items. (Due to waste control, they need to be able to mix quickly.) We had the equivalent of the chicken masala and it was way sweeter than anything I have ever had.  The sauce reminded me of the Indian tomato soups that I have had, in both texture and flavor.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I had expected based on my past experiences at other Indian restaurants.  Also, despite ordering it spicy and requesting it be an 8, it was very mild. We ordered the garlic naan and could hardly taste any garlic. 

I ordered a Mango Lassi to go and it was okay.  A bit heavy on the yogurt.  I prefer my Lassi drinks lighter/less thick.

Regretfully, it took us a year to come back. A year in which we undoubtedly missed many more memorable meals. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and were seated in what I would call the 'choicest table' (actually a corner booth). Our waiter was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu which was to be expected. We each asked for suggestions, stating preferences and dietary restrictions, and we felt our waiter nailed it as we were all thrilled with our order. I, especially, appreciated the vegetarian and vegan selections. The food was nothing short of heavenly and the naan  could not have been more perfect. The somosas? To die for! Service was expeditious and expertly executed. I would also like to point out that rice comes FREE with the entrees unlike many other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas (which I refuse to patronize for that very reason). The ladies room was immaculate (always a good sign). I cannot wait to go back and try the lunch buffet at Mint.

4620568,2011-03-13,3,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I went to Mint a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of fellow computer scientists for a birthday lunch. The place is pretty small and the buffet area seems small, but the selection is decent. If you know me at all, you'll know that the first thing I look for is Butter Chicken. A quick scan of the lineup reveals a disappointing no. So right off the bat, this puts them at a disadvantage against Namaste.

Then I found the Goat Curry. At an Indian buffet, I really only need one go-to item and luckily, the Goat Curry was off the hook! It's not quite the Naan heaven that is Butter Chicken, but paired with rice, I enjoyed every morsel.

As for the Naan, I like how they bring it out to order. This can lead to moments of Naan-less agony, but at least you know it's always warm and fresh when it comes to your table.  The Garlic Naan has an overpowering aroma and is the only way to fly.

I haven't tried any of their Lassis, but that will definitely change today at the CMYE. I love me some Mango Lassi, but the other flavors are intriguing.

Overall, I'm definitely a fan of this place. Quite honestly, I'd pick Namaste over Mint for one simple reason (which should be easy to deduce by now). Still, Mint is a solid lunch buffet choice.

EDIT: I've since been back and I'm not sure why I thought the buffet area is small. There are quite a few dishes from which to choose. I guess it's because I only found a couple of items that interested me.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,2,4,e7uNZ81bTmou9xZ9loTThA

Special because, they have a spicy menu, for people like me with red hot spice buds :) If you love spicy, you need to try their Inferno menu. They have almost every item on their menu which can be converted into inferno menu item. Last time I had tried their Dosa, and we asked the server to make it 50% less hotter than regular inferno, as we were a large group which included people who didn't enjoy spice as much. We all had our ears ringing with heat, it was spicy yet tasty. I kept eating it until I could enjoy it, and straight away chugged my sweet yummy Mango lassi. 
This time though I wasn't lucky enough to get the inferno menu, as I had come along with my wife and a couple of friends in afternoon, when they serve buffet. Cannot complain about the food as everything was pretty tasty. They had South Indian items like dosa, idli and medu vada and North Indian items like Naan, chicken masala, goat curry, paneer sabzi, veg sabzi and other chicken dishes. Sambar could have been better as I remember it was last time I was here. We also tried some chicken tandoori and chicken masala from Buffet which was pretty good. Gulab Jamun was the desert which was just ok. I really wish to come some time back in the evening and try their other menu items. In my previous visit, other than than the inferno menu, I had tried their chicken tikka masala and Navratan Korma, which was really delicious. Mango lassi was fantastic and I couldn't resist to try it again.
The staff is good and gets the plates out of your way, so that you can go for next round on the buffet. The restrooms are clean and there is plenty of parking available. This is definitely a very good place to eat Indian food, specially when you are busy getting drunk on the streets of Vegas, this place can help fill your appetite.",MtmbnUmDPeW8QW-mEeLPHw,2,4,4,GJB4Mr8ISq0cZAYZyIQd-g

Food was MUCH better than average. The naan was excellent. And, the selections were original and refreshing.

The variety is unbelievable, including several chicken and lamb dishes but also many vegetarian ones.  I've never seen an Indian buffet with that big of a spread!  There is also a salad bar.  

Everything was delicious!  The Garlic Naan was out of this world!  The chicken curry and fried chicken (strip) were very yummy and the chicken tandoori was the best I've ever had!  They even have desserts!

Love, love this place!  You will, too!",VVMqxCARIOdUzpqngpFMgA,6,6,5,Av90jRhuzSwCTRFCNhky9g

While I'm used to the flavors of my former go-to place, this food was good. Ordered my usual saag paneer and chicken tikka masala along with naan, lamb biryani, and a plain dosa. 

My only complaint is that I ordered from the website and it defaulted to this location when my intended pick up location was on Durango. This location was many, many miles from my house which was troublesome. Also, ordering was difficult as their website was not formatted for an iPhone browser and was sort of annoying to navigate.",x7vj04BPnhoX3AeGTnOa1Q,0,0,4,IL34XoFeIPM2J-0MlmH6Cw

I had planned to get food to go but I started chatting to one of the employees and decided to just eat it there at the bar instead. The conversation ultimately centered around the Route 91 festival which I was working at, as I was wearing my #vegasstrong shirt it was all that was on my mind. I was telling the man named Chris my story, my heartbreak, and my luck to even be alive.
My food began to arrive. I had ordered enough for two people as I was starving and had barely eaten that day. My weight had dropped over 10 pounds since the previous week of the festival. After I was finished and stuffed I asked for the check. 
Jay, one of the employees informed me that it was taken care of. I asked what he meant and he told me that the owner had taken care of everything. I did not know the man I was speaking to was the owner and I had not noticed him leave. I broke down crying with tears of happiness and sadness. I began to tell the others also what had happened as they didn't really know. The staff in there were so caring refusing even a tip, and even offering me dessert and a ride home.

We go there so much that the staff puts in a order of vegan roti for me as soon as we walk in the door, which is sweet.  The service is usually very attentive (filling drinks, etc. ).

Based on the level of saltiness I'm pretty sure they came out of a package but I appreciated they were steamed and not fried. The chutney that came with them for dipping certainly upstaged their flaws as did the courses to follow. We ordered a couple different variations on naan (bread) and they were hot and delicious, obviously right out of the oven. I ordered the chicken curry and the bread came in very handy to soak up all the sauce. I'm not sure what my friend ordered but it was wonderfully sweet, savory and spicy. The kind of heat that creeps up on you and makes you want to eat more of it.

The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, they had a good selection of Indian beer. One thing I noticed was how cleverly the food descriptions were written on the menu. The imaginative and vibrant language made it difficult to decide what to order because everything sounded amazing!

4884722,2010-09-18,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Mint Bistro is an unassuming gem in the University section of Las Vegas.  Right across the street from UNLV on Flamingo, Mint Bistro is one of the best Indian restaurants in town.  The University/ Paradise section of town already has around 5-6 great Indian restaurants, but Mint Bistro is the best.  

The outside of the restaurant makes you think that it is a take-out restaurant, but once you walk in you will feel welcomed by the comfortable Indian decor.  I have been to Mint Bistro about 5 times, and have always had great food.  My favorite dish is the Saag Paneer, which is house-made Cheese sauteed with spinach.  They make a very good version of one of my favorite Indian dishes.  I also really like the Mango Masala with Chicken.  This dish combines the classic flavors of a Chicken Masala with the sweet Mango flavor.  The other dish I usually try to get is the Rebel Curry.  Very flavorful, but spicy, curry, served with your choice of meat.  If you are a vegetarian, Mint Bistro has many options for you, but if you eat meat you have many options, too.  

Mint Bistro also has a great selection of Belgian Beers.  My favorite that I had was the Duchesse de Bourgogne, but they have many more.  Although it sounds random for a Indian restaurant to have a great selection of Belgian beers, they have some of the best I have seen.  Definitely try the great pairing of the beer with the Indian food.

Went here for a weekend lunch buffet. Priced at $12.99/person, it is unbeatable good quality Indian food (you could tell by the sheer number of Indian folks eating here and the long queue of those waiting to get a table). The buffet had a varied collection of items including appetizers, salads, four veg, four non veg curries, rice and dessert. Some top show stoppers were Vegetable Korma, Paneer, Idli Sambar, Veg Pakoras, Bhelpuri and Naan. Food was flavourful, hot and fresh (unlike many places where dishes just keep sitting for long on buffet racks). Each curry tasted authentic, distinct from another and cooked to perfection. Also tried their Masala Tea (not included in the buffet) and it was good.

Service was fast, attentive and friendly and this is despite the rush on a busy Saturday afternoon.  Decor is simple yet pleasing to the eyes.

For those of you, who might be tempted to try many other low priced Indian buffets in town (mostly at $9 or $10), trust me this one might be a little pricey but it is top value for your dollar. This place serves delicious food and has great ambiance & service!

Tip: Lunch hour gets real crowded on Sat & Sun, so ditch the long waiting time (sometimes upto 30-35 mins for a table inside and 20 mins for an outside seating) by making it for an early lunch. Also, if you are not used to having Indian food, this could prove to be a little on the spicy side for you.  

So what could improve? This is for the restaurant owner/ management/ staff:

1. Do away with those paper cup glasses. They look cheap and take away the charm from the entire food experience.
2. Including a drink in the buffet like Tea or Mango Lassi can help you beat the competition that comes at a similar price.",lnS0o8WR1IEslZQHUDnN-A,2,2,5,cDj6CxYqnm-QpjB4uogtFw

Our first visit was at dinnertime and we were utilizing our Entertainment Book coupon.  For the Husband and I, we ordered:

* Karma Korma ""A creamy sauce sprinkled with nuts and assorted Himalayan spices."" (with fresh veggies $12.99) - 

* Rebel Curry ""This is the Nepalese Gurkha version of the famous curry with a rebelliously inspired exotic blend of curry spices."" (with lamb $13.99)

* Garlic Naan ($2.99)

One thing I absolutely love are papadums and was so pleasantly surprised when they offered these to us complimentary!  (Other Indian restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore!)  Both entrees were so flavorful and just delicious that we couldn't resist checking out their ever so popular lunch buffet option.  

The daily lunch buffet is $9.99 with kids 3 and under being free.  (Ages 4 to 7 years are $5.99.)  It's offered from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm.

One thing I appreciated was that they noted what food items were vegetarian and vegan.  As someone who recently stopped eating dairy, I found this very useful.

When ordering naan, I was able to get this sans butter, which was quite appreciative in my situation.  And with my  new dietary restrictions, I was still able to enjoy quite a lot of food items and left feeling full and satisfied! 

Their buffet menu can be found on their website, but it does change.

4982568,2012-06-30,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Oh Yelp, you steered me wrong on this one.

I feel pretty bad about it actually, because there are some things that Mint really does right.  Unfortunately, few of these were related to the food itself.

The good - they bring you a carafe of water and leave it on the table so you can refill your own glass.  This is really nice when eating spicy Indian food (of which there was none here.)  The restaurant is very clean and attractive, the service is very friendly.  They bring naan fresh to your table and the naan was good.

The bad - Most of the buffet was bland, bland, bland.  And I don't mean just 'not spicy' bland, but 'no flavor' bland.  The tikka masala was gloppy, like the cream in it had curdled, but it had little flavor.  I was SOOO excited to see goat curry (my favorite dish ever!) on the buffet... but it was bland, bland, bland.  The meat was good but the curry...nonexistant.  The saag was downright horrible - the worst I've ever had.  Everything tasted like they'd forgotten salt (and I don't like overly salted food).  The creamy tofu curry had no flavor.  The kheer was also pretty dreadful.  They use rice angel hair instead of rice, so it had a slimy wormy consistency and the runny 'sauce' did not taste good.  I usually love kheer but I took one bite and that's it.

The indifferent - the gulab jamun was about average though I couldn't taste any cardamom in the simple syrup, which is a letdown.  The dal was subtly flavored but not too bad.  The best dishes on the buffet were the 'chili chicken' (tasted like mexican-indian fusion but actually had some flavor) and the 'veggie chow chow' which is some sort of noodle dish that didn't really remind me of any Indian food, but didn't taste bad.

The buffet was about $11 per person.  There were a surprising number of indo-pak folks in here, surprising because of how bad the food was.  Normally at the places I frequent in other cities that have a lot of indo-pak clientele, the food is very spicy and flavorful (sometimes too spicy for my pansy white arse even).  But here, it was like the baby-food bland version of everything.  Why were they here?  Is this really the best Indian food available in Vegas?  I shudder to think that is the case.  I hope they were just having a bad day but honestly the food wasn't good enough for me to want to find out, despite the nice touches of fresh naan and abundant water.",51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w,1,2,2,9PEX9SgzLneRny5I6MfEzQ

*********
For years I ate Indian food on a weekly basis and for a while I stayed away since I burned out and the BF never had Indian food before so away we went. 

 The drink selection is one main reason that made me really want to try them. We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. 

While we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. 

For food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.

It includes:

*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). 

*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. 

*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside

*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. 

*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. 

*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. 

*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.

We also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! 

Lal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. 

The service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all. It felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there. I just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details. 

I haven't been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time. The BF was super happy with discovering Indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about it....days later he's still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend. 

 Definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal. If our next experience is as good as this one, it can quickly grow to be a favorite.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,7,5,VQ-q1QMe01PTJqM2tpMglA
5052990,2011-12-26,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"We made a reservation last night for 8pm on the OpenTable app while we were out running errands. When we arrived, every table was full and the manager expressed that he thought the reservation was for 8:30. I pulled up the email and he apologized profusely. They seated us to the side with menus while they figured out where to put us. The manager continuously apologized and we were seated within 20 minutes of our reservation, with drinks (which we ordered while we were waiting) and papadum arriving quickly. 

My husband is still coming to terms with Indian food (he was convinced he hated it when what he really dislikes is curry, so he's been slowly discovering things that aren't curry), so we ordered the Indian sampler to give him the widest range of options. At least one other reviewer suggested that this wasn't enough food for two, but we found it to be more than worthwhile. True, there were no leftovers, but that isn't what we were expecting. The tray is artfully presented. Each item comes in its own small, circular metal container with naan in the center and extra rice on the side. The containers are easy to pick up, which is really useful when sharing. There isn't really enough naan for two, but our second order came out fast and warm.

Everything expect the vegetable curry was a little mild for my taste, but that was the price I paid for sharing with someone who asked for medium.

I had the lychee rum lassi. I really like the idea of alcoholic lassis, but the lychee flavor was a little mild. I think I'll start with a stronger base flavor next time. Lychee was too delicate.

I had the lunch buffet a while ago and came back based on that. It was definitely worth it.

They did rush us out without be drink menu I asked for after we finished our khir, but when I saw the grandmas in saris sitting outside in a line about five tables deep, I decided that my darjeeling would be just as good brewed at home.

5123041,2016-03-08,3,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Been to about 5-6 Indian buffets in town and this has taken over Mt. Everest as my new #1.

Something to rave about...
1. The garlic buttered naan was the best I've had at any buffet in town, soft, hot and airy and they bring it to you in an individual basket to ensure it's fresh.
2. The curries are good and the meat/chicken is good quality...I noticed buffets like to go cheap on the goat, giving you some fatty parts and straight up bone, but not here. I had some nice chunks of goat meat in the flavorful goat curry and it was tender...nicely done.
3. They had two kinds of soups, both had a good spice, one with a nice tomato broth...soup on an Indian buffet is a nice touch.
4. Making an entrance was chicken vindaloo...not too many buffets put out a vindaloo because they figure most people don't like spice...I love spice and wish it were a touch hotter but glad it was there regardless.
5. The Khir (rice pudding) was also tops as were those gulamon (?) super sweet carb balls...

Let's bitch...
1. Vegetable pakora was kind of dried out...they had made a ton of it and it just sat there...but who the heck goes to a buffet for pakora?
2. No vegetable samosas...I would have hit that but not a big deal...they said they change things daily so maybe tomorrow is samosa day.
3. They had chicken tika masala and paneer (cheese) tika masala in two different bins...I love paneer dishes so maybe instead of giving me the same exact curry twice and calling it an entirely different dish, make a paneer palak (spinach) dish with the paneer and keep the chicken tika masala up there as well...just an extra flavor rather than the same flavor over again.

Word is they are opening a new location in Spring Valley off Flamingo and Durango which is awesome because I know I'll be there 2-3 times a month minimum.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,5,5,5,oHR5zu2mDxrVSpai7VkQuA

5204600,2009-11-05,1,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Having recently been burned by overpriced terrible tasting food at another Indian restaurant in the area *cough* Bollywood *cough* we were hesitant to try more Indian cuisine. We were having a tough time coming up with a new place to visit so I went to Yelp. I started looking up various ethnic cuisines and I did a search for Nepalese food. Much to my surprise a place called Mint Indian Bistro showed up. After reading the reviews it seemed like the place had a mix of Himalayan and Northern Indian cuisine. So we made a resolution, we'll try some appetizers and if we didn't like it we would go to a different restaurant for our main meal.

All that plan B contingency stuff went out the window when I looked at the menu. They actually had menu items marked as vegan and vegetarian such that for once I would not have to ask about the ingredients they use in each of the dishes. So we made the plunge. We decided to share the Vegan Sampler and it was good. I want to say it was great, but there were a couple of items in the sampler that I did not enjoy as much as the rest.

Additionally the decor and feel of the restaurant was very nice. They even turned the lights up for us temporarily while we were perusing the menu so my mother could see the menus as she squinted without her reading glasses again.

With full disclosure and all that jazz I would say the food was in the four star range, but the addition of the vegan friendly menu really pushes the rating up for me into the five star range.

- comparing my experiences with indian restaurants near UC Davis, the food is not spicy at all. I was expecting it to be packed with flavor, but curries were nothing close. For my tastes, overall somewhat bland and dry.
- Garlic naan was great! fresh! But comes with a caveat. it takes forever for you to get some.

We came here for the lunch buffet since I've been hearing good things. Our naan took a rather long time but at least they gave us unlimited garlic naan. 

There's another Indian restaurant a few miles away from here that also has a lunch buffet but that place turned me off when they kept giving me excuses as to why they can't give me garlic naan (i.e. ""We ran out of garlic"" when there's a supermarket right behind them). This place is in a better location and looks nicer and cleaner. The service is better too. For less than $15 for a buffet, you can't go wrong.

I liked that there's a good variety of dishes for their lunch buffet: tikka masala, palak paneer, tofu, veggies, spicy chicken, curry and other savory dishes. Their gulab jamun was just right - hot, sweet and cheesy balls. Yum! The food was excellent. Hooray for huge chunks of chicken! The sauces were spot on. There was this mystery dish that we all tried without reading the label - was it cheese or was it tofu? It was the texture of cubed mozzarella without the stomach ache-inducing property of cheese on somebody who's lactose intolerant. So, it probably was tofu.

I'll definitely come back again and again.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,4,5,gWRxO0b5k8MCmPTibSm8ow

The food was good, a mixure of Indian and Nepalese food. The curries were quite tasty and Naan was great. However, I was expecting more Nepalese and Himalayan food and less more traditional Indian food fare. However, all in all cuisine aspect of the place is definitely above average.

Service was poor. We came in for an early dinner (around 5PM), and the place was empty. A few Nepalese gentleman (friends of the owner, I presume) were sitting together talking business and writing stuff on notepad right in front of the customers--not professional. That would have been okay, but to top it off, one of the managers, or possibly the owner was also serving the tables and was quite slow with water/drink refills and was very rude in questions about different, unfamiliar menu items. He even had a smirk on his face a couple of times. The tables were unimpressive and some of the booths were ripped in places and patched together with tape.

Overall, for me to return to this place, I would have to make sure that the server/manager was not there that day and that it was busier so I do not have to see creepy business conversations.

5333486,2017-01-12,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"This is one of the best Indian restaurants ever! And this is coming from someone who's eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants in a handful of cities across the US. 

I had a veggie salad to start, which is sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots, thin green chili pepper strips garnished with onions and lemon wedges, with the perfect amount of Indian seasoning sprinkled over it. Unless you have super high tolerance for extremely hot food, I suggest you go easy on the chili peppers but the rest of the salad was awesome. 

For the main course I had Aloo Gobi Masala (potatoes and cauliflower in a curry sauce), brown rice and an order of buttered paratha (multiple thin layers of whole wheat bread) with fire roasted garlic. Aloo Gobi tends to be a standard dish at Indian restaurants, though the flavor, consistency and oily-ness of the curry sauce often differs from one restaurant to the next. I have to say it is out of this world here! It's like you died and went to Indian food heaven! The paratha was also outstanding . . . a little heavy on the garlic but I happen to love it this way. And it's such a pleasure to be able to get brown rice at an Indian restaurant. Very few offer it though I'm not sure - in this day and age - why this remains the case. The meal was absolutely perfect. The dim lighting, plush decor and warm ambiance of the dining room was a wonderful compliment to the wonderful food. No complaints about the service either. 

I had such a great experience that I came back a few days later and tried their Karma Korma with veggies, along with the garlic paratha again. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the seasoning was heavenly. The sauce was nice and creamy . . . coconut milk-based I think. Regardless, it was one of the best vegan Indian dishes I've ever had.

5373918,2011-04-20,0,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I have experienced a few misses while trying to find a good Indian restaurant. This place is the total package. The decor is filled with soothing earth tones. The employees are friendly and attentive. The food is pleasing to the palate. The best part, the lunch buffet is only $9.99. At this price, I can afford to buy lunch for myself and a few friends.

Unlike my last experience at a different restaurant, Mint is great at keeping the hot foods hot and the cold foods cold. The salad and fruit selections were limited, but they were crisp and refreshing. I am a sucker for Indian sauces. My favorite being mango and mint chutney. I can eat it with everything. 

The vast selection of gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan friendly foods makes it a no brain option for when I'm with friends who steer away from meat. The kadhai paneer was one of my favorites, a firm cheese with a mild taste in a curry sauce. Yet meat lovers will not go hungry. The tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection. Nice juicy pieces that were seasoned exceptionally well.  Chicken chilli was probably the best meat dish offered though. The spice is not over powering but strong. Try the rice pudding. 

The only criticisms I have are that certain dishes were either too sweet or too salty. The masala rice needed to be mixed with some basmati. The galub jamun gave me an instant toothache and numbness of the tongue from the sugar overload.   Other than that, I would happily come here again.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,4,oFnkfEOE6go3qpJLqbFfiQ
5390843,2012-09-13,2,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"I hate buffets.  Ever since I was about 9 years old and ate a horrific piece of cold fried chicken at the Circus Circus buffet, I pretty much avoid them unless they're being paid for or someone I know really wants to go with them.  For a while this even extended it to restaurants I liked or cuisines I enjoyed that offered buffets.   I would skip those and order a la carte.   

With my recent love for Mt Everest's lunch buffet and my complete obsession over Indian food in general, I figured it was time to venture out and try another.   I'm ridiculously smart for this decision, because Mint blew me away at lunch today.

We were seated and offered a choice of naan and I ordered an iced tea before going up to grab a plate.  Naturally I skipped over the fruits and veggies on the first cart and went right to the rice, pakoras, and varieties of dals, curries, and chicken dishes.  First thing I noticed that I appreciated wholly was that each item had notations on whether they were vegan, vegetarian, had glucose, or had jain.  One of the friendly servers heard my friend and I seemingly confused over what that even was and she explained it (people who dont/cant eat garlic or onions?  Perish the thought!)  I annoyed her with my lactose intolerance issue as I do everyone that I encounter in a food establishment, but still took my chances with just about anything that didn't say ""paneer"" on it.  My goal at Indian buffets now is to never return for a 2nd plate.  Of course this just means that I have a mountain of food on my one and only plate, and Mint was no exception.   If I went back for seconds they probably would have closed down for the day.  Pretty sure I was triple stacking items and just letting them all ooze together.  It's like an fountain drink suicide indian style.  The only negative I can think of on selection this day was no samosas.  Seemed like a greek joint without falafels.

Got back to the table with my iced tea waiting and a basket of fresh, hot naan followed shortly after.   EVERY single bite was delicious.  I wish I could go into greater detail on each component, but it wouldnt be adequate.  I probably had 12 different items on my plate, and I repeat:  EVERY bite was delicious. 

Price was standard and worth every penny.   One final exemplary service note which might have just been circumstantial, but on the receipt it noted that the naan was with (no butter).   I think the woman that was working at the front of the line may have informed our waiter to hold the butter on the naan as she overheard the two lactose intolerant weirdos in line discussing it.   Way to make us feel welcomed!

Gotta go 5 on this one.   Though I'm starting to wonder if there are any Indian restaurants here in town I DONT like....",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,3,5,eOS4OJKt54sDiDcYXoeg_g

I can buy a whole tub of plain organic yogurt at the grocery store for that much. Still, it was thought to be a courtesy yogurt.

The hubby got the Mighty Momo with chicken. I didn't think they were that good and would definitely be more appropriate served as an appetizer than a main dish. One of our friends got the lamb lollipops which he thought was great. The garlic naan and paratha were ok...I've definitely had better.

Really enjoy the cool and laid back vibe at Mint.  The lively Bollywood style background music adds a nice touch. Also, the creative art on the walls contributes to an air of whimsy.

Now, onto the food. The buffet starts out with a small but nice selection of simple lettuce salad, various chutneys (mint and mango are my favs) and plain yogurt to tamp down the heat of the curries which aren't really that hot anyways.

While I didn't try all the the entrees, a few of my favorites included: Paneer Tikka, Veggie Korma, and Chicken Tikka.  The basmati rice is always a nice addition and works well under the entrees.

I always look forward to the garlic naan bread and it did not disappoint. Just a nice pillowy, but crispy bit of deliciousness. Yum!! I'll take another order please! And another...so addictive.

Found the servers to be attentive and courteous. They are always sure to bring another carafe of ice water.  All restaurants need to have carafes of water as it's a major time saver for the servers and keeps customers happy.

True, it may not be professional, but I've never liked the waiters that stand on ceremony and I like this intimate and friendly atmosphere better.

Located in an unassuming strip mall, Mint is somewhat of a buried treasure in Vegas.  We went for dinner and were seated in a spacious booth, the restaurant itself was almost packed at 8:00pm.  

The menu itself is extensive, but also descriptive and keyed for Vegetarian/Vegan items, Gluten Free, Spicy, etc.  Very impressive regional beer selection, I had never tried Indian beers before.  Our party of three enjoyed the Garlic Naan, Vegatable Samosas, and the crispy flatbread that was brought to the table was toasted perfectly.  For our mains, we enjoyed chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani, Rogan Josh (with lamb), and I loved loved loved the buttered masala dosa I ordered.  (I had been craving a proper dosa for months!).  Various chutneys were brought to the table as well.  

All of the items were delivered with good timing, and were all equally delicious with tender chicken and lamb.  At the time of your order you can designate how spicy you'd prefer your meat/curry dishes (on a scale of 1-10).  Our server was hilariously talking us into spicier levels and we were glad we agreed with his recommendations in the end.    We ended with the small dessert offerings of which I can't remember the name but all were lovely and petite, served in tall shotglasses it seemed.  Total bill for three adults with one alcoholic drink and one soda $100 with tax.

Food wise there were standard items that you will find in any other buffet. The taste was very average with surprisingly no dish really standing out. The only worthwhile comment was that the noodles were really Indian style chow-mein that is very common in and around Delhi. They gave us hot bread (naan) at the table without charging more for it, I'm not sure if that is their policy or they just forgot to do that. 

The sweet dish (Gulab Jamun) looked pretty nice but when eaten felt like they were recycled after being left around for a couple of weeks so you can avoid that. The menu on their website mentions lots of options for the sweet dish but the only other item was an empty bowl of mango custard.

I've been here twice now - the first time for dinner and the second time for the lunch buffet. I'll just go over the overall points.

Generally good service. Sometimes the waiters are awkward and there was one young fellow in particular who looked like he hated his job. Everyone is knowledgeable in the food and readily answers questions though, which is great for me because I barely know anything about Indian food.

The food is bomb and I'm seriously craving it right now. One time, the chicken in the chicken Marsala was dry though, so that was strange. But overall, everything is seasoned to how I like it (a rare occurrence) and I was delightfully surprised by the mango yogurt! So good.

Outside of the lunch buffet, it's a little overpriced but you get a good amount of food made with quality ingredients and care. I like that they label things in categories like vegan or gluten-free. Very helpful for those who have limited diets.

My favorite was probably this lamb dish during the lunch buffet which I cannot remember but I assure you, it was awesome. I love the garlic naan, which I wish came in some heated basket (in my dreams) because it gets cold so fast! Tastes so much better warm.

5659864,2011-07-18,4,UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,"Ever since the Mint Yelp event, I've been DYING to come back here but hadn't because of lack of somebody to come here with. My friends are unadventurous eaters and unfortunately, this is a place my family would never eat at because well... for example, my mom's favorite food is saltine crackers and milk.  Anything remotely spiced is shunned and I get a lecture about how I need to be normal and eat stuff the family will eat (read: bland and processed.) Zzzzz.

I've had the mind to walk down and just eat here by myself when I'm at school, but I'm afraid I'd gorge myself on the much talked about goat stew, the delicious gulab jamun and the KILLER tamarind sauce. Seriously, you know how there's that nasty tasting cake called ""better than sex cake?"" Well, if there's a food on this planet that should have the title of ""almost as good as sex,"" this tamarind sauce is the only one that could possibly be a contender - it's crazy delicious.

After volunteering at the Las Vegas Rescue Mission on 7/16/11, I needed to grab some food before work because I felt faint, thanks to some vegetable and fruit only fast that I was on. Being a non-vegan, looking for vegan food, I had only one place in mind to go - Mint. 

My sister waited outside while I walked in. After a few minutes of perusing the menu, I noticed that it was laid out differently than it was when I came for the Yelp event - it was much easier to find the vegetarian and vegan options. 

I'm supposed to eat only vegetables and fruit on this thing- no dairy, no meat, no nuts, no grains, but, dang it, I was in a hurry and after 5 days of eating dressing-free salads and drinking juiced cucumbers and carrots, I was dying for something filling and flavorful. The meat options all looked killer and I wouldn't mind eating... well anything on the menu. It all sounded great. I settled on potato and pea samosa and a half order of malai kofta with 10 spiciness, hold the rice and the naan. (Less than $10 total.) 

The service was good. I chatted with Smeet about school and work while I waited. He told me the kofta wasn't vegan. At that point, I didn't care. I'd settle for vegetarian for this meal. Friendly service anywhere is always good and in about 15-20 minutes, my food was in my hands and I was out the door. I basically ripped open the container and devoured half of the innards of one of the samosas while simultaneously changing for work in the car. I took the rest with me in to work and chowed down. 

Ummmm... the malai kofta was SO good. Maybe I was deliriously hungry or maybe it was just that good. I've been craving more of that kofta like crazy. It was spicy, but not overly so, and had the creamiest texture. It was delicious. How wonderful it is to have something spicy! The remainder of the samosa had the mint and  the ZOMG! tamarind sauce that Smeet included in little containers, poured over them. It was the best thing I'd eaten in almost a week. I wish I had ordered double the amount of food. 

Would I go back? YES. As of this writing, I have 8 more days to go on this Vegan thing and I have a feeling I'll hit up Mint at least two more times to grab some more delicious food before I'm done.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,3,5,hoDrVV8-3ZUDFwcTY5SUIA

The dessert that they normally serve with the vegan set menu they were out of though so they gave us some sort of mango sorbet.  It was so frozen that it was hard to eat with a spoon but I was so full it didn't matter.  One other downer is that we did have to ask a total of three times (two different employees) in order to get our bottle of sparkling water.  No big deal though, other than that we had atleast 4 different employees serve us, check in, help out.  Honestly if the service had been perfect I would say 5 stars.

My fiancé who is the meat eater wasn't too fond of the goat curry and prefers Taj Palaces chicken tiki masala.

The Idly was okay.  The Dosai was good and they provided Podi as well for the Dosai in addition to Sambar, Coconut and Red chutney. Was disappointed with the Sambar as it was not close to being south Indian version. 

The Biryani was a flop for us because there was too much masala and the flavor was overpowered by the turmeric powder and could not taste the biryani. The chicken fry was not an item in their menu but the chef was kind enough to accommodate our request. It tasted good. We had a good conversation with restaurant manager and found that he hails from our City in India. So here we go for nativity and scored a Gulab Jamun on the house.

Everything tasted AWESOME. Their tikka masala is a bit more tangy than I am used to, but it was delicious. Vindaloo was spicy (level 3) in a good way, not a burn on the way out way. We were devouring our food...

You can't beat $10.99+tax for a delicious lunch buffet with 10% off if you're a UNLV student.  It just doesn't happen.

Their butter naan is so yummy; I have to remember not to fill up on that so I can fit more delicious food in me.  My OCDness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees.  They used to have a dessert warmer at the very end, but I think they nixed this because not enough people were utilizing it during the lunch hours.

My favorites are (and I will definitely butcher the correct names of these items): the yellow Indian fried rice with vegetables, fried vegetables, the noodles with vegetables, chicken tikka masala (I know that one!), goat curry, and spicy chili chicken.  I'm pretty sure I've tried everything there, but these are my go to dishes.

The 5 stars comes from food and price alone.  They really do have delicious high quality food.  The service is consistently mediocre if not subpar, but if I'm at Mint it's for the food.  Also, it takes awhile for drinks to come out, especially if you order coffee.  I don't know if it's a cultural thing, but I've almost always received my coffee at the end of my meal. I would prefer it as an accompaniment to my meal.  And getting your bill can take awhile too sometimes.  If I have to leave, I just go up to the counter and pay.
