3044377,2014-07-09,0,leZNWLccyBaXpPIRPK_lsA,"First let me give you my take on Fazoli's. Fazoli's is to Italian food, as Panda Express is to Chinese food. It may not be authentic, it's fast food, but I like it.

I had the Ultimate Sampler, Fettuccine Alfredo, Meat Lasagna, Spaghetti and Penne Pasta with Meat Sauce, endless bread sticks, $6.99, with a soda and tax just over $9.

I will start with the bread sticks, they were very good, by themselves or using them to sop up the left over sauce, very tasty.

Lasagna, noodles with ricotta and meat sauce poured over top, 
Penne pasta with meat sauce poured over the top.
Spaghetti with meat sauce poured over the top.
Fettuccine pasta with Alfredo sauce poured over the top.

If you keep in mind it's fast food, this is how you would make lasagna and the rest of the food. You have pans of sauces, pans of cooked meat (chicken, meatballs, etc) and vegetables, with boiling water to quickly cook the different pastas. Then combine them in as many combinations you can. You boil the noodles, add meat or vegetables (if the dish calls for it) and pour sauce over the top, Voila, Italian fast food.

It's not going to compare to, nor intended to compete with, an authentic Italian restaurant, old family recipes, sauce cooking all day long. For what it is, it's good.

They also have salads, pizza and sandwiches. The sodas are Coke genre,

If you have eaten Fazoli's before, this is a nice location, with a very good staff, always checking to see if you need anything. If you haven't been to Fazoli's, I recommend you give them a try.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,3,kqOCUP_lokC_lbaRuEq9YA

4960198,2015-04-06,0,leZNWLccyBaXpPIRPK_lsA,"Good food, fairly good service, but they need more drink options and/or Coca Cola Freestyle machines.

Fazoli's is essentially an Italian fast food restaurant, with a number of dining option and entrees available which are surprisingly delicious and transcend the ""fast food"" label. They once had four locations in the Las Vegas Valley, but for reasons unknown the others have closed down, and this is the only one left.

As far as variety, the menu here has no shortage of that. Pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, they have it all. No matter who you are, you should be able to find something that you like on their menu. My personal favorite entree on the menu is the cheese ravioli in marinara sauce, but I am sure you will find something that suits your tastes.

The service I have gotten in the restaurant has always been good. As a semi regular, they recognize me and know what I (usually) want to eat, which actually speeds up my visits a little. It is good to find a place that knows the regulars.

Prices are a little high on some items, but I cannot entirely fault the restaurant for this; there are likely factors that go into pricing food that I myself am not aware of. It is still far less than a traditional ""dine-in"" Italian restaurant and nearly as good despite the casual approach and atmosphere.

The problem I have here is the lack of drinks; there are only a limited number of sodas to choose from, and things like teas, milk, lemon ices, and such. They need to add vitamin water and/or sports drinks to the menu to give customers some variety. Why have they not installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine here yet? In this day and age, and with only ONE restaurant in the Vegas Valley now, there is no excuse for this. If anyone from the management team is reading this, PLEASE install a Freestyle machine (I have already requested this on the official website). If I am using a coupon that requires me to buy a drink, I need more variety than what your outdated machines offer.

Overall, Fazoli's provides a quality dining experience, though the lack of Coca Cola Freestyle machines is a major weakness that needs to be addressed in the near future. Still, I would recommend eating here despite that. This is quality Italian food, and fast.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,3,PFzkdORBdwCj7T0GA3vYqg

Nothing has changed other than the prices going up, up and up and the flavor going down, down and down.

I ordered the #8 which cost $9.79, it is Penne with Creamy Basil Chicken and a slice of pizza w/small drink.

The slice of pizza was actually very good and I began thinking that I should have just ordered the two slices of pizza combo instead. 

Anyways, I did contact a store Supervisor later to inform of the bitter tasting pasta and she did advise it was most likely that they added too much balsamic to it which could have ruined it.

She was a sweetheart and put my name in the credit book as that I may return and get a replacement meal to make up for the bad pasta dish I had.
