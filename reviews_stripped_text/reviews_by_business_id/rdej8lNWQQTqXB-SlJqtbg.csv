Bartender was nice and friendly. Small talk and looked at the menu. I asked about the Morning After hamburger and he said it was delicious. I ordered it along with a coke. People around the bar were young, eating and just hanging out. When I got my burger, it was incredible. The fried egg on my burger was cooked just right. I bit into it and the yoke broke. Oh my God!! It was one of the best burgers I've had in so long, but the French fries just took it over the top. It was an awesome meal. I will be back because the guy behind the bar was telling me about how good their gravy is for their chicken fried steak or the biscuits and gravy.

Not only was it more than small it had the texture of jerky and was terrible. I ended up just eating the vegetables and sending it back. Now with that being said I will never eat here again. 

Onto the service, it was the middle of the day with maybe 5 people in the bar and it took my friend a good 45 minutes to get a refill. Not only did she never acknowledge that the glass was empty she was never around to grab her attention for a refill.

Why only  stars? I hear the company is hard to work for. Why can't they invest in this wonderful property to reestablish it?

I come in for the wings, the bartenders (now), and it's close to my house. But when I want a crowd, or live music, I go elsewhere.

I did, and it seemed to put the waitress into high-speed wobble's. At first she said they couldn't do it, then she said they could but there would be an up charge. I agreed to the up charge and then she asked me if I still wanted the biscuit. I said ""sure"" at which point she said they really couldn't do it because the pancake would have to go under the meat. What??? Apparently this is the first somebody has asked for a substitution.

The chicken fried steak itself was about middle of the road compared to others that I've had. The eggs and the fried potatoes were on par, but I was a little put off by the biscuit and gravy underneath the CFS. I ordered iced tea to drink. The waitress never came back to offer a refill.

We were greeted by Holly,  the bartender, and pulled up two barstools to play while we ate. She made two awesome Bloody Mary's using Clamato with a bit of spice. Damn respectable. She offered them as talls and of course we had to oblige. For breakfast, the wife ordered steak and eggs; and I ordered chicken fried chicken from Holly's suggestion.  The wife's steak was not good. The meat seemed old and even smelled a little strange. My breakfast was really good with great tasting gravy on the chicken and biscuit. The house potatoes were crispy and well seasoned wit no grease.  Holly apologized for the bad steak and offered something else, but the wife just enjoyed the rest of her breakfast which was all good.

Once done, we asked for the check and was surprised to see that we got charged for everything except the streak and eggs. Holly even charged us $10 for each Bloody Mary. We were surprised because we played the machines while eating and each dropped $100. Seriously? No comps for anything outside of the bad steak?

The food was okay but a bit overpriced, the beers were cold but the service was slow.  $25 of play at full tilt didn't warrant a single comp.  When I asked the bartender how much you had to play to receive a comp, she said $30. Since that is higher than ANY other place I have been to in town, it might have been good information to give me.   I know that $25 is not a lot of play but I was never enticed to play more.  The bartender never asked if I was/wanted to be a member of the players club and never told us about any promos etc.   Also, it took about 10 minutes to get our change because the bartender was more concerned with the payout to the GM who was drinking at the bar.  It is unfortunate because this place has a lot of potential and is close to my home but I won't be back.

Well about 12minutes later we walk out with my hundy$$$ in my hand! We watched the asian bartender chick circle twice without even looking at us while Mr BuffTatoo is on the other side. All the while I am logged in to gamble only to walk out as Mr and Mrs Invisible ....hello BJ's Brewery. BTW....how dare BJ'S interrupt my rant with prompt service!!",L-bAAvjfCD360YwrSTv3Lw,1,1,2,_UbhZu_NIr9bhga2f6Lx3A

First drink was free and I tip well. Looks like no take home food from here I would rather go the McDonald's then give this place any more of my money.. Horrible service absolutely,7gL0foPFp3Nui3K7PTWPtw,0,0,1,DhNw0j94HgD7K2RYaN8ZKg

Had to ask for ketchup  and mustard  when it should have been brought out with the meal.  Soup with no crackers?  The staff should be trained or replaced.",esyj0rVb_yIxHe6IBSMLgQ,1,0,2,S8XTGDPom81hRfdFqmurMw
