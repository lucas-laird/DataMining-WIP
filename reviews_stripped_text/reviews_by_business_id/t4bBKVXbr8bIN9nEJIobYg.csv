I've developed a taste for spicy food because of this place and now I can't get enough. Any meat dish is cooked to perfection always tender and perfectly flavored. The prices are decent and the atmosphere is peaceful although I'd love to see them expand. I cannot stress enough how good the food is!,HRrY-Btr-5w-TArnl7jBKw,0,0,5,mbRaMJnCZ8mhmocd2R-G6g

30504,2012-07-12,0,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Decided to visit this place during a weekend getaway to Vegas after seeing reviews on yelp and trip advisor. 

Food: Tastes great (we had Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Chili Shrimp), Spiced to taste, smaller portions (one entry feeds 1 adult), garlic naan was excellent (kids swore it was the best they've ever had), the fact that they had Indo Chinese choices was a huge plus as well. Only con was the dessert (they lost a star for this)- Gulab Jamun was not good at all, and they still charged us for it even though I said it wasn't edible. They serve it cold, and the insides were rock hard. Overall, this was the best Indian food I've had in a very long time.

Decor: Elegant, nothing too fancy, but tasteful. In a quiet, residential area.

Service: Very friendly, at times a tad slow, not too sure who our server was, at times it was a guy, at times it was the hostess who was quite nice.

Cost: A little pricey (~ $15/entree). Bill for 2 adults and 2 kids was ~ $100 without drinks.",DaiEUoyNXE3OI7KG-kfwIA,1,0,4,P401zHlMl0R_midoHRgg4g

Small thing, for me, when I arrived on time for pickup the food wasn't ready. Another takeaway customer arrived and had the same problem. They've got some timing issues, but I was able to easily overlook that by the quality of the food, which is for sure the best available in Las Vegas (and I've tried just about all of them).

While I waited for my food I noticed the restaurant looked great. A large, fully-stocked bar and a comfortable, modern dining room. For me, Saffron is a little out of the way, but I'm happy to overlook that too for their excellent food. Glad to have found it.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,2,0,4,XiqS6RXxEWZEVdd4qahClA

(It was like half the price of sushi, too, so there's that...) The place had a great atmosphere, they were very generous with the naan, and service was great. There were some dishes I wasn't crazy about, but I think that's more of a personal preference, and that's the great thing about a buffet- you can just try something else. I loved the chicken tikka masala and there was a paneer veggie dish that was incredible. The only reason this review isn't a 5, was we like it spicy. Like, INDIAN spicy.

I did notice a good about is business was coming in and out for carry out, not that it mattered to me. The decor was nice I guess for a restaurant in a strip mall, they could not have done much else to spruce up the place.

Our food came out pretty quick and was served in nice dish ware. The rice that came out for us to share was cold. But my dish was just flavorless.

165854,2012-12-01,1,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"I've visited this establishment twice, once for dinner and more recently for their reopened lunch buffet. For dinner, the food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. It took forever (about 2 hours total) to order our food, get water and refills, get our food and finally pay our check. The butter chicken was so-so. The aloo gobi even less remarkable. The 2 kinds of naan were too doughy. Despite this mediocre experience, I was willing to give their lunch buffet a try, especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine. What a mistake that was... First of all, the price of $11.99 is at the high end for Indian lunch buffets, and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for. The selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing. Ok, to be fair, it was still better than our abysmal experience at Sherpa House (in Golden, CO) but that is setting the bar extremely low. There were a whopping total of 8 hot trays consisting of items such as onion ""pakora"" (basically onion ring fragments), orange chicken, daal, chana masala, goan fish curry, lamb curry, paneer masala, and (non-Basmati) rice. There was also a small salad bar section and kheer. There was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango chutney, samosas, Tandoori chicken, any kind of chicken curry, or saag. Although we enjoyed the fish curry, it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items. The garlic naan was so-so. It was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom. The kheer was the worst we've ever had. It lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice. At least this time around, the service was half decent. The only other mitigating factor was they were running a $2 off promotion, although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied. That being said, the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher. Perhaps, restaurants located in the (relative) boonies are held to a lower standard. Who knows? As for me, when I rate a restaurant, I don't care where a restaurant is located. The food is either good or it isn't. It's either a good value or it isn't. Unfortunately, this place is neither.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,1,2,oEkU7zJnPAkFbMHOuFOO7Q

Service was attentive and just right. Ambiance is a nice blend of Indian and Southwestern without overdoing either.

265692,2010-11-30,1,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Really great place. We had dinner there tonight and sadly had the place to ourselves. However, unlike a lot of places that just seem to ""give up"" when they don't have a lot of business on a particular night, the staff at Saffron seemed to be working extra hard for our approval! Our hostess/waitress was very friendly and accommodating, ensuring that we had everything we needed without hovering.
 The food was absolutely excellent as well. My husband had a lamb dish, which he ordered medium spicy, while I had the mattar paneer at no spice. Both of ours was delicious and seasoned perfectly. They don't seem to fall into the trap that ""more spice = more flavor"" that I have encountered at some places where a ""5"" actually equals ""nuclear reactor in your mouth hot.""  Now that I know they have a fine hand at spices, I may actually order a little heat next time!
 We also got the cheese naan, which I HIGHLY recommend! Tender, filled with just enough cheese to add flavor and texture without making it greasy. 
Their menu is just long enough to give you lots of options but not so long that it's overwhelming. It has a huge vegetarian section, with lots of choices for even the pickiest eater. 
 Long story short, we will be back! Hopefully next time it will be full to the rafters busy!",WbJuDPwlDctt7QD8nQhetw,2,0,5,Q1r03qc7aqSRiwjtDVBtwg

i had a certificate for restaurant.com that was expiring and we wanted to try something different.  after bouncing between their site and here, we decided to give Saffron a try.  thank you to Whitney for posting the location behind the McDonalds; otherwise we might have missed it!

we walk up toward their OPEN sign and get pointed to the door down tot he right.  why in the world would you put that sign next to doors you do not use?!?!?  anyway, we were told we could sit anywhere we wanted as we were the only ones there.  the young man was probalbly new because he could not answer a question about one of the naans.  no big deal.

we started with the garlic naan, bullet naan, tandoori chicken wings, and the sampler.  both naans were very tasty and the wings were also very good. the sampler was also eaten pretty fast, even though it was a bit spicy; probably a 7 on a 1-10 scale.  we were not asked how spicey we wanted the sampler, but were asked for our entrees. everything was nice and tender.  everyone also loved the mango lassi; not too sweet but yummy.

3 of us ordered the tikka mix (lamb, chicken, shrimp, but no fish as mentioned on the menu) and our 4th ordered the shrimp saag.  the tikka was very good (silly of us to get the sampler as an appetizer and the mix for the entree, but it was good stuff!).  very flavorful and nicely spiced.  the girls raved about the saag.

So I was going home from this side of town, and I desired a bit of good eats to arrive home with.  Here's a shout-out to Yelp for leading me to this place.  I never would have stumbled across this tucked away place otherwise.

Even if I happened upon this establishment, I'm not even sure I would have guessed it to offer take-out.  There's enough class inside that I actually asked if they even did, and soon found out I would be one of three doing the same.  There is a separate dining area from the bar, but from the passersby, I guess it to have accommodated them nicely.  The bar area seems to have a full compliment, and the tender definitely seemed to know his way around it (not that I sampled).  I sat at one of the few bar tables and watched the television they had up.  I was very kindly offered water or soda while I waited for my order; a first for me when getting take-out.

After perusing the entire dinner menu, I settled on the Chicken Tikka Masala -- caught my eye as it brings together the joys of the tandoor (grill/oven) with curry.  Luckily the dish comes with rice, as you really don't get a lot for the money here.  What you do get is quality over quantity, but I'm a fan of both.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy I wanted it.  After discussion that I'm a fan of a little heat, we concluded that I should try an 8.  Well, the 8 tickled some, and it was flavorful -- not just spicy for its own sake.  It certainly carried the graceful interplay of spices and textures of good Indian food.  It had an acceptable amount of chicken that was cooked to perfection.  Delish it was most definitely.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,2,0,4,c5FebV3yDWMlw6DhKVanSQ

Here, though, it was richly flavorful, moist and yielding -- seriously, the best I have ever had.  The people raving about the garlic naan bread are absolutely right -- fresh-baked, with just the right level of browned bottom.

The service was very pleasant -- maybe a bit over-attentive, because we arrived at a slow time.  That's a shame, because quite honestly, this restaurant should never have any slow times.

We were greeted and seated immediately at a table near the entrace to the dinning area, not our favorite but not bad overall. We ordered the vegetable samosas, chicken tandoori (heat lvl6), and chicken masala (heat lvl3). We were given crisp thin crackers that were very good, they had great flavor and came with two sauces. One was very savory with hints of citrus and herbs, the other a sweet jam like sauce that we preferred. Our vegetable samosas came and the shell had a great crunch, the filling of vegetables and curry was delicious and was complimented well with the two sauces. Then our main courses arrived, the chicken in both the dishes were cooked well, very tender, and the tikka masala had lots of flavor. The odd thing was that the folks masala (heat lvl3) was spicier than the tandoori (heat lvl6) although both was spicy it was very managable and was a welcomed level of heat. The servers were friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food was good. So why the 3 star?? When we got there we were one of maybe six tables that had people and as time went on the dinner crowd came. Although not slammed we were then approached,by four different workers. One day us, one took our order, one brought our food, and another cleaned up. When our meal was coming to a close my water was not refilled nor even asked if I wanted any more water, to some it may not seem like much but for me having a beverage is a point I look at as it is much over looked. We were then asked if we would like any desserts and if we wanted a dessert menu and we said sure! So while the waiter took off we watched him, clean up tables, get water for other guests, and totally just forget about bringing us a dessert menu. Then our original waitress asked if we were done, at that point we were. So after getting our mean if payment ready we then watch all of the waitresses and waiter walk by us more then a handful of times and not once came to ask if the check was ready. My lady had to stop one of them so we could pay and continue our day. In my opinion the food was good but I overpriced and you dont get much for your dollar. So while the food is good, staff are friendly. There is still room for improvement, waitresses I believe should slow down and pay attention to their guest more and don't forget about others while more come in.

Saffron has a wide variety of choices and most dishes can be ordered at a range of spice levels, from a one to ten, with one being super-mild and a ten being set-your-lips-on-fire hot. When in doubt, go a number or two lower and work your way up!

If you are in the northwest, be sure to try this place. If you live across town, it is worth the drive!!

Everyone enjoyed their food, and the other fan of spicy foods also liked the bit of Chicken Madras she tried, finding it spicy-flavorful but not overpowering.

Came in because we'd heard they were starting to do lunch buffets. Add the recent promotion of $2 off, we were psyched to try it out especially when it's a lot closer to our neck of the woods.

I was really surprised by the lack of selection available considering the price. For $12, there were 8 hot items (including rice) with a small salad/fruit bar and kheer.

But this would be okay if the food was fantastic across the board. However it missed the mark. Of all of the dishes, the standout was the Goan Fish Curry. The fish had a lovely texture while the curry was wonderfully mellow. However, you were pretty much dumpster diving to look for pieces of fish in the curry. Other than that, everything else was okay (lamb masala, chana masala, paneer masala) to not-so-great.

Of the not so great items was the dal (bland), the orange chicken (soggy, overly sweet --- I'm not sure how this fits in with everything else - this s*(t is about as American as apple pie), and the kheer. 

I have to take a minute about how they messed up the kheer. Not only did they cheap out on the rice (they used some sort of long grain instead of basmati), they may have used leftover rice to make it with the rather large clumps of rice emerging from the pudding. If you stirred the rice while you were cooking it, this doesn't happen. In addition, the rice was undercooked and hard. Plus you don't even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all.  Bleh. Major turn off. 

The garlic naan came to the table nice and hot and flavourful. However texturally, it was a little too hard, a little too doughy and not enough flakiness. 

Sporting a tomato chutney, an unpleasantly weak mint chutney (where's the mango chutney?) and a rather watery raita, I was disappointed by the lack of pickles and other condiments normally seen at other places.

Given the plehtora of places available in the valley that offer better selection, better quality and overall better prices, I'd skip this place for the lunch buffet. 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,3,2,i1ATTcrWTyL8mPhDyeFkmg

2250598,2011-11-19,2,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"I was devastated when Saffron had to close its doors for several months, and the moment we read it had reopened, we were back there that night, ready for some more five-star Indian taste.

Alas, the only thing five-star about Saffron now is my husband's old review, which he plans to downgrade soon.

The staff is still friendly. The dining room is still pretty. I'd give four stars to both. The menu offers shahi paneer, so you know I'm already happy.

But did Saffron reopen with the same chef? Because the taste? Eh. 

Look, if you live in the area, then you're probably delighted. But it's nothing I'd drive across town for, which is exactly what we used to do. Now the taste is a little acrid, a little bland in seasoning, not nutty whatsoever in the shahi sauce, and although it was served a little hotter than before (I always order a ""7"" on the 1-10 scale, but I don't mind hotter), it was just the taste of heat, not the taste of complex spices.

If I were rating strictly on taste, I'd struggle to give it 3 stars, just because it's a little shy of ""A-OK"" and I've definitely experienced better (the 2-star rating), right there in that building. 

As it is, I struggled to give the entire experience 3 stars, even after factoring in the good points described above. Why? Well, we asked for our remaining food to go. ""Do you want your rice packed separately or mixed with the dishes?"" Odd question, but okay. ""Separately, please."" 

We'd left at least half of our meals untouched, what with not really being satisfied, but we'd hoped that - like most Indian food - it might taste better the next day after the flavours settled.

So, imagine how disappointed I was when I opened our puffed-out to-go bag when we got home. There were only two boxes. One had rice, and the other had our three dishes all mixed together.

It's Indian food. It's saucy. It's not going to obey the 1/2-inch ""compartments"" in a single to-go box. Huge mess. 

Now realize that my two vegetarian dishes were slathered with my husband's chicken tikka masala, and you can see why my disappointment turned to disgust. How cheap and unprofessional. We'd clearly ordered separate dishes, but even if we hadn't, I wouldn't want my own curries all mixed together in a single to-go box.

Saffron, this three-star rating respects the good times we once had. Good times I hope your other customers will get to experience. I know your heart is in the right place. But what you've got going now is *not* ""A-OK."" I hope you'll return to your prior glory, but I can't see driving past all the ""sure thing"" Indian places to take that chance again.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,5,1,3,pMMe_Zei9VukYT4Cap1Agg

This place has AWESOME Garlic Naan.

As of late, I haven't been yelping a lot but with this trend of hitting an Indian lunch buffet every week, I feel the need to share.

***THIS IS ONLY A LUNCH BUFFET REVIEW***

After a disappointing experience last week at a different establishment (that we drove halfway across the city for) I'm glad to write a review about the place closest to where I live.

Saffron Flavors of India has a good lunch buffet.  

Let me explain...

First off, the service is great.  The staff is attentive and friendly. :)  Always nice to see GREAT service from anyone in this town.

Secondly, the food selection was good and the items themselves were fresh, not dried out (like some tandoori chicken at other establishments) and the Garlic Naan is AWESOME.  

Last, the place is clean.  There's really something to be said for this.  I've been to some other places and the glasses (or the water) are cloudy, or the buffet itself isn't appealing due to spilled items next to the buffet or on the floor, etc.  While this may not be the biggest place or have the biggest selection of items, the place is CLEAN and well organized. :)

Now with those things said, I'm sure there are those of you who may be thinking, ""Hey, I read a few other reviews and they mentioned that there weren't that many items on the lunch buffet.""  I sort of agree...  Then again, consider that the items they have available are not always the same items day in and day out and that the things that are on the buffet have great flavor.  It's $11.99 for the lunch buffet.  It's not some huge dinner feast, and it's not $49.95.  $11.99 will get you a sandwich and a drink at the place across the street and this is a MUCH better option for the same money.  Also, if you were thinking about it, since I mentioned sandwiches, the bread here...the Garlic Naan...is REALLY GOOD. ;)

I really need to come here for dinner.  I'm sure it's probably just as good if not better than their lunch buffet. 

As for the price, $11.99 is fine.  We're in Vegas and typically anything WORTH anything is $20.  If it's $11.99 and it comes with great service...  Well, there ya go!

Honestly, I'd probably pay $11.99 for a few baskets of their Garlic Naan. :)",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,3,1,4,gAWaqQxv16iNI8cfjHrMvQ

I saw the yelp reviews and decided lets go, thanks everyone! 

I was seated within 30 seconds of arriving and received my beverage within a second of sitting down.  The waitress then asked me if I wanted garlic or regular naan, and being me, of course I ordered the garlic!  She guided me over to the buffet, and basically told me to dig in.  *my eyes grew wide*  I started with a salad with the delicious cucumber dressing and little jalape√±o; tay-tay-tasty! Then I went and got my main meal, I loaded up with some rice and then piled the Curry Chicken Pepper splashed some of that Ritata sauce on there and headed back to the table.  After piling a mountain of food onto that yummy delicious warm garlic naan I shoveled that food down so quick and went for seconds, and then thirds!  Ahhhhh somebody stop me!!  In my many trips to the buffet bar I also tried the garlic chicken, which was good, almost a little dry, but it made the cut for me and then something else, to be honest I didn't even look at the name, I just dove in and took it; it might have been the Chicken Masala come to think of it.

2798118,2011-11-06,1,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Really happy that they opened back up so I could finally try them. My mother and I went for dinner on a Friday night around 6 p.m. The establishment is divided into two areas. There is a bar on one side and on the other side is the dining area. There were a few tables occupied but not busy yet. Two very cheerful servers greeted us and after being seated asked if we had any questions.

Everything on the menu is ala cart so it can be pricey. They brought us a basket of papadum and couple of chutneys. The green chutney was my favorite, while the red was a little too sour for my taste. We started off with two mango lassis and paneer pakora. My go-to drink at any Indian restaurant is mango lassi. I can usually down 2-4 of them during the course of a good meal. These did not disappoint; nice and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness and perfectly smooth. The paneer pakora was huge. Not really that used to appetizers at an Indian restaurant being that big. We were going to get full before the meal came. The pakora was crispy and brown and we also spread the chutneys that came with the papadum on them. The paneer has a bit of a nutty flavor and is sort of the consistency of very firm tofu.

For entrees we ordered Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken and Kadai Ghosht. The Butter Chicken was good, I got it at spicy level 5. Was not to enthused about mom's Tandoori Chicken. It came out all sizzling and hot on the plate but the piece I had was flavorful but dry. Mom said I must have picked the only dry piece on the plate since her's were pretty juicy. I think my favorite dish was the Kadai Ghosht. It is a lamb curry with onions garlic and ginger. It was very tender and succulent and the flavor was out of this world. We also had panner naan (good) and garlic naan (very garlicky so very good) as well as they served us a small dish of basmati rice to share between us.

Now as far as the service goes, it's the type of service I expected. I don't think I have ever been to an Indian restaurant were the servers are snappy. They are not bad but if you are expecting to be in and out the you are out of luck. They were very cheerful and quite helpful. Our server was a bit too eager to clear our plates away (even when we hadn't finished yet.) I was a bit alarmed to hear a server recommend to a family a vindaloo when they asked what was a good dish that was not spicy. But considering they go on a 1 to 10 spice level for every dish I suppose that was okay?",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,1,1,4,CTzBE-1nyfuY5NIgrnmolw

The chicken wasn't yogurt marinated and pre grilled before being dumped into the sauce, which to me is what makes the meat stand out at an Indian place. 

The sauce wasn't your typical masala either. It tasted like garam masala and chicken broth with way too much of.. Something that made the sauce quite light in color and not the red I'm used to. 

The paneer was similar.

Butter chicken and tikka masala are my go to dishes--that is my normal order! The madras was something else--the flavors were so good, I couldn't stop eating! We also ordered garlic naan and cheese naan. The cheese naan is to die for! I want to kiss the hand of the one who thought to put cheese inside the naan! We ordered our appetizers at a spice level 2 out of 10 and the entrees at a level 3. They were both the perfect level of spice for those wanting the flavor and avoiding sweating through the meal!

Overall, the food was excellent. Our server was very patient with any questions and concerns that was asked--as mentioned before, most of the party had never eaten Indian food before. I would definitely come back again!",OwXcuIvZVX4LAHIaM0X6OA,1,2,5,H_tLZ5KNBAZ2bgVPlFsPFw

So, don't expect to be getting a huge entree of chicken.  For the price, I think they could've given more chicken.  The small curry bowl was filled 1/3 chicken and 2/3 sauce.   

Naan:  It was absolutely delicious dipping the naan into the masala sauce.  What made it most enjoyable was the surprise crispy texture on its bottom... almost like an Indian pizza!

Mom had the aloo ghobi & seemed to be disappointed with the dryness.  She kept on saying how it was missing something-something.  Since this dish isn't familiar to me, I had no idea how to compare.  

We also had the vegetable samosa.  Surprisingly, it was not fried, but baked.  Mom was quite upset about it and said it would've tasted better fried.  I agree with her, but I did think it helped cut back on the calories.  Perhaps, if they used filo dough, the thick pastry would've been a better choice?

For me, it was a 3 star visit.  For Mom, probably a 1 star visit.  I'd like to return for their buffet just to see how they cook the other items.",vY-tZRltKhp4AZN3yEr10w,2,1,3,dGSvSiDPn-oQbmAClL2OMg
3248251,2011-01-30,0,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Despite the fact that Saffron is a little far north for us to drive, a restaurant.com gift certificate combined with our love of Indian food convinced us to give it a try.

We arrived at about 7PM on a Saturday and the place was deserted. We were the only customers. I worried about what the food would be like if no one else was here and if it was good, how the place would survive. By the end of our meal any worries were dispelled. The food was delicious and the place was packed with hardly an empty table.

The meal began with some complimentary pappadums with the usual accompaniments of mint and tamarind chutneys.  We started with a serve of samosas which I initially thought looked a bit dense, but they turned out to be the most aromatic and delicious samosas I have eaten in Las Vegas and I found myself regretting not ordering a double serve.

For our mains we split a paneer makhani, my wife had shahi paneer and I had chicken tikka masala.

My tikka masala was delicious, although it was a bit different to other tikka masalas I have had in the past, having a bit of a vindaloo flavour. I initially thought they might have mixed up my order, but the chicken was definitely tikka with clear skewer holes in the meat. Either way, it was absolutely divine.

My wife absolutely loved her shahi paneer and when I helped myself to some and plenty of the ample gravy I agreed. Very rich and nutty and perfect fodder for the delicious serves of garlic and plain naan we ordered with our meal.

The paneer makhani was also very good, although I found it just a touch runny when compared to the wonderful consistency of the shahi dish. If I had ordered it on its own I would have been more than satisfied, but next time if we split a dish I think I'll try some sort of kofta and see how that is.

The restaurant itself is really attractive and welcoming. When I read other reviews that said it was in a ""Strip mall"" I had visions of a grotty row of shops with some cheesy red and green neon, but the place looks really classy and the ""strip mall"" looks more like a business park and is only brought down slightly by the presence of a honking great McDonald's out front.

Service was great and friendly. Water was refilled promptly and they did well handling the sudden influx of crowds.

Prices were decent. I would say the main dishes were a couple of bucks more expensive than your average Indian restaurant and appetizers were a dollar or two cheaper than average, so if you're ordering a bit of everything it should work out about even.

Saffron Flavors of India is a great addition to a growing list of quality Indian establishments in Las Vegas. It's of the highest quality and ranks among the very best, to the point where the thirty to forty minute drive from home won't daunt us in our future dining decisions. We will definitely be back.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,6,1,5,M11-WZNje8JXCbiFucUEcw

The samosas were good.  The tikka masala was good.  The tandoori chicken came out cold and undercooked.  Usually that dish comes out sizzling on the iron skillet...but we had to send ours back because it was cold.

I've traveled to so many cities, and I always make sure I try one indian buffet in that city. So I'm actually disappointed in trying this with a friend of mine who is also an Indian Buffet-enthusiast to only taste bland dishes. I had to add salt (which I really never do) and chili powder (which should never happen in an indian restaurant).

3583506,2014-11-30,2,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"I have no idea why Indian food is so expensive.  I'm sure it has more to do with supply and demand than actual pricing.  Seriously, a reasonably priced option would do an amazing amount of business in Las Vegas.  It's not like Indian food is gourmet in its native country.

In any case, the majority of Indian fare in Las Vegas is centered around the strip or to the East.  Samosa Factory was my go to restaurant, but is now gone.  I was certain that my joy of Indian food was over, but then luckily Saffron Flavors of India came to occupy a strip mall a mere few blocks from my place.  I can go there everyday.  Or rather I could, if I could afford it.  Despite being in a ""not-ideal"" location, Saffron has the pricing of a strip adjacent Indian restaurant.  Maybe I'm being a little harsh, it may be a couple bucks cheaper.

Now that I've complained about the price, how is the food?  It's good.  Although, I had a really disappointing lunch buffet when they first opened.  While I haven't risked the buffet again, the dinner is delicious.  They will even make a lamb korma (not on the menu) which is delicious.  The quality of the lamb (or mutton, I'm sure) has not been consistent, but I can't complain.  Their dum mutton biryani is superb and I have to get it every time.

They have you give a number for the amount of spicy that you want.  Little Greg, whom I've trained to tolerate more and more spice, likes it at a 5 or 6.  I prefer 7 or 8, but don't recommend that level on a date unless you don't mind having a runny nose in front of a prospective sexual partner.

Oh, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't mention something about quality Indian food.  If the chef has used the correct spices, it should not give you stomach problems.  In addition, when you leave the restaurant there is a little dish with fennel seeds in it.  Eat a small spoonful to avoid later explosions, if you know what I mean.",pd5ouypeFcAlLEZ25o2uBg,0,0,5,qsGiUAVy1pS9YYQNb66ovQ

An Indian restaurant? Up here? Could it be?  Thoughts of culinary joy filtered into my mind and the ""Curry-Plum Fairies"" danced in my head.

This was my second visit to Saffron. The first time, my friend and I ventured in and my love sensual decor did a delighted dance.  The walls are a warm, almost Tuscan texture, and the windows are hidden by a dalliance of lovely, transparent, red, gold, and emerald curtains. My friend and I shared the Butter Chicken and the Saffron clay oven platter. The butter chicken held pieces of tender, moist chicken in the most delicious, buttery, flavorful sauce over rice. The Saffron platter was a mix of chicken, shrimp, and Indian sausage slow cooked with tandoori spices in a clay oven.  We also ordered the garlic naan bread, which I thought was to die for.

Today, I thought I'd try the lunch buffet since I had some time and wanted more than my fridge had to offer. The buffet is $11 and contained 8 dishes, salad, and yummy Indian sauces. I had the tandoori chicken wings, a vegetable samosa, spicy chicken curry, lamb curry, a lentil dish as well as two other vegetable dishes.  I am ashamed to admit that I am not fluent in the names of Indian dishes. (Maybe I'll tackle that in 2011)
Along with the buffet came a basket of regular naan. I'm no expert of all breads Indian, but this bread was SO yummy.  Clearly just baked in a hot oven, the bread glistened with butter over it's hot bubbly dough.  It was savory with almost an undetectable hint of sweetness.
All in all the food seemed authentic, not too spicy (and you know I like my spicy...), but in some cases I thought needed a smidge more salt.  Now, I probably like too much salt, so this may not deserve the elimination of a star.

In the end the atmosphere is very nice, and the staff is friendly, attentive and genuinely concerned that your experience is a good one. If you're ready to venture away from your weekend trip to Applebee's, and want something that will tantalize your taste buds....  Head over to Saffron for some serious yum.",sM0FJN2NfXBmPjOgz7tv-g,7,3,5,MMfSWS_ol4e-Fv4bPy6ZHg

The service was pretty bad for us.  We got our orders taken right away, and the food was pretty fast, but then we didn't see anyone again for quite some time.  Our mouths were burning from our food and we had no water.  And when I went looking for someone to fill our water, I couldn't even find anyone.  That's ridiculous!

The food itself was OK, but not amazing.  Definitely overpriced.  If I hadn't have gotten a restaurant.com GC, I would have felt super ripped off.  As it is, I felt only a little ripped off.  I guess I'm spoiled, as I remember getting like 5 dishes for $35 at the Indian restaurant that closed on Decatur and Charleston.  Here, I barely got 2 dishes and an order of naan.

The buffet is small but is in the size range of others.  At $11.99, it's price is OK.  Not the cheapest, not the most expensive.  The restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating.  There is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located.  The buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining room.

There was a selection of salad, yogurt, chutney, and desserts at the beginning of the buffet.  After the initial bar, there were several chafing dishes with various foods.  I tried the chicken tikka masala, a curry chicken, dal makhani, onion pakora, and some fried chicken balls--the name of which I can't remember.  Accompanying this was basmati rice.  

For the most part, the dishes were good and flavorful.  The dal was bland.  It could have used some seasoning.  The chicken balls were tasty and different.  I should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but I failed to do so.  Next time.  One of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry.  I didn't try this but noted this for future reference.  I made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition.  I got one gulab jamun and it was very good.  It was quite soft, and it was not overly sweet.  A very nice ending to lunch.

Service was average.  We were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room.  When I went to get my gulab, my dirty plate was not removed.  Other than this, things went OK.

If I'm in the area, I'd certainly stop again.  It is in the middle tier of Indian buffets I've tried.  Since it's the closest place to where I live, I'll be back.  I wouldn't recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the UNLV area.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,6,3,3X-4IBH9UVL4AGFhw9sdTw

Located on West Craig and the 95, inside a tiny strip mall opposite the gas station. If you blink you'll miss it.

Legitimate indian food is hard to find in Las Vegas and if you do find half decent food it's usually some sort of infused restaurant that costs an arm and a leg that's not very good!!!!

After realizing Saffrons was closer than expected, I decided to give it a shot and wasn't disappointed!!!! Every time I have been here for lunch Buffet, dinner or picking up, the quality and standards of this business are 5 stars each and every time.

 My recommendations are the Rogan Ghosht, Lamb Vindaloo and the garlic Naan are all top shelf. The bar at the front of house is also not a bad little bar, with large LCD screen with whatever sport you want. Also it's a nice place  to knock back a kingfisher while waiting for friends. The service is also a fairly oiled machine. 

Decor is fairly simple and nothing outlandish that you come to expect from a lot of good five star places on the strip. 

I realize I'm pumping this business up, and I truly do believe its a 5 star indian restaurant. Indian restaurants are one of those hit or miss kinda places that can give you amazing quality or cardboard.... So until they start to pump out run of the mill stuff I'll keep it at 5 stars.

The ambiance is a little off.  You walk into a really brightly lit bar area, with no recognizable hostess station.

Sort of reminded me of a cafeteria that had been dressed up with some bright colors and lot's of curtains.

The important part the food, was AWESOME.  We ordered chicken samosas and chicken pankora's to start with.  Both were excellent.  We especially enjoyed the samosas.  The chicken meat was ground and mixed with wonderful spices, very very tasty.  For dinner we ordered lamb vindaloo and chicken masala tandoori.

But all foods are not the same. The feeling I get from one food may be far greater than that of a different food. Case in point, curry provides me with one of the strongest highs I know. But not all curries are created equal. A Thai curry is far different from the curries in an Indian restaurant. Either way curry is a comfort food to me. It is astounding how one meal can change ones mood so completely and curry fits that profile. Tonight I had a more mild curry at Saffron Flavors of India. More so I had a full experience featuring curry. I started with the complimentary papadan and two sauces of which I am not all too familiar but I am a fan of nonetheless. I also ordered a bottle of Taj Mahal pilsner style beer. For my entree I ordered butter chicken and a side of garlic naan. The naan was warm, chewey and perfect as always. It was the perfect accompaniment to the buttery rich chicken curry with a touch of tomato. The high from this meal was such that my eyes were half closed and I had a soft grin on my face during the entire meal. I was experiencing a sort of nirvana. And why stop there. I had my opener, my side, my entree and my drink all of Indian origin. It was time to round out the evening with dessert. I thought I should try the galub jaman.

It was juicy and not dry. Even after microwaving the next day the chicken didn't dry out. 

- Garlic Naan $3 : I don't know how felt about it. It did have the garlic I guess I was hoping that the garlic would blend more into the naan rather than just being on top of it. 

For take-out it was fast and already waiting for me when I came in. Food was hot and fresh coming home. Only thing I didn't like is how there was no breakdown what the curry came with. I was so scared it didn't come with rice, which I got so happy. Also if they offer Naan with my Masala not sure if it does or not since I ask if I can get garlic. The price might be for substituting it for the regular. Another thing is the price was not shown on the menu. This is a minor thing but I like knowing how much it's going to cost me before going in.

4484361,2011-03-17,2,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Saffron Flavors of India, not to be confused with plain old Saffron on East DI, is the first Indian Chinese fusion restaurant I've seen. Though traditional dishes found on the menus of most Indian restaurants make up the bulk of the menu, some interesting plates catch your attention immediately. One dish that sounded particularly enticing to us was the Paneer Chili ($7), an appetizer of homemade, mild Indian cheese dressed in a sweet and sour sauce with green peppers and onions. I know it sounds strange, but it was actually quite successful. The sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting as sweet and sour often can be, and we loved tasting Chinese flavors in a dish that actually had some heat.

Non-fusion dishes were just as successful. The sauce of the lamb rogan josh ($15) was a deep brick red and flavor-PACKED, letting you know someone loved it for awhile. My mushroom and sweet corn masala ($13) was served in a sauce that was equally complex and flavorful, yet I was disappointed to see that canned mushrooms were used. The sauce was so incredible, however, I really didn't mind at all. Anyone who can make canned mushrooms taste so good gets a big culinary thumbs up from me. I also enjoyed the addition of corn, which replaced the more common peas found in many Indian mushroom dishes.

Fun little extras included a superb raita with crunchy chunks of cucumber and crispy onion pakora. If you love onion rings, the latter is a must try. We also loved the bullet naan ($5), a flatbread stuffed with cheese, potatoes, chickpeas, onion, cilantro, and green chilies. It made me think this restaurant could do well as the first Indian pizza joint.

Sadly, I fear this restaurant may not survive due to it's location. It's actually fairly easy to get to as it is right off the 95 at Craig, but the new strip center it's in is dead with no signs of budding life. I hate seeing these mom and pop's dissolve - R.I.P Taqueria Los Parados and Vegas Cafe.

Today they have 60% off for St. Patty's Day with the code LUCKY, but if you sign up for their updates they offer discounts just as deep nearly every week. You can also same money by taking advantage of their great lunch buffet. The number of items is limited, but it's a bargain at just $8.99.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,6,5,5,LL1Re-ceOpPJ2e4G3lPAWg
4486441,2014-02-01,0,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"My friends and I went to Saffron on a Friday evening and we were the first ones there as the restaurant does not open for dinner until 5:00pm. This was nice because we were able to take in the ambiance of warm tones and seating options. As more people began to arrive, I was grateful they seated the families with children in the back area, while seating the after work crowd with drinks in the front. 

I ordered the Vegetable Korma (heat option of 6) and garlic naan. I enjoy spicy food, so the Vegetable Korma was a good balance of spice and creamy coconut sauce. However, my friends who are meat eaters, ordered the Mixed Saffron platter and shrimp masala  thought the heat option of 4 was more than enough.  The paneer in the korma had an excellent flavor and I cannot wait to try other dishes with it on my next visit. As other reviews have stated, the garlic naan is amazing. The garlic had a fresh flavor and the bread was perfect for scooping the korma. 

For dessert, we ordered the galub jamun. You will get three ""honey balls in rose syrup"" and they are quite tasty. The perfect end to a great meal. 

As a suggestion, if you are going with a group of 4 or more, you will be fine ordering a few dishes and sharing them family style. With 3 dishes, two orders of garlic naan, two orders of  rice, and two orders of galub jamun, there was more than enough food for the 4 of us and we even took some home.",6sgJfHy6lUY9xWP7uCMA3Q,1,0,4,I7oxj0m9oOo_mmGqd048kw

We Used Yelp Eat 24 to place our take out order.  It was very easy.  It gives you the option to pre-pay with a credit card or pay with cash when you get there.  

We walked in the door and the inside was very nice.  A great looking bar, everything looked extremely clean.  Definitely a place I would stay and eat at one day.  

What we ordered;

Chicken Saag (medium) 
Chicken in a spinach gravy- Saag is usually my favorite item, but this is my least favorite item we ordered only because it seemed it lacked a bit of flavor, maybe salt.  But it can be easily remedied yourself at home.  The chicken was a bit tough as well. 

Lamb Korma (medium)
Lamb is an extra $1 but oh so worth it.  It's very tender!  The Korma gravy was amazing!  So flavorful and perfectly seasoned to my requested Medium.  I could eat this all day.

Garlic Naan-  Yummy!!! This bread is loaded with delicious garlic and the perfect tenderness.  

Saffron flavored Basmati rice- I meant to order a different flavor of rice, so this was not my favorite.  But it was very good for what it was.

Cheese Naan 
Chicken Korma 
Lamb Kabob 
Tandoori Chicken Wings 

The Chicken Tikka Boti was my GF's favorite out of all these dishes. Mine was the Chicken Korma at level 5 spiciness, makes my mouth water just thinking about that creamy goodness. The Naan was perfect on both accounts. I love the flavor of those Tandoori Chicken Wings. The Lamb Kabob was perfectly spiced to where you could still appreciate the flavor of the meat.

He was super friendly and helpful. After we had a chance to go over the menu Demi came to take our order. As I said we started with some Naan.

Personally I am not a fan of lamb at all but I dipped my garlic naan in the dish to try the flavor of korma and it was not as sweet as I expected but it tasted really good and my date loved it so much he was able to finish almost the whole dish.

I went with a spicy chicken dish called Kadai Chicken . Demi asked on the spice scale what I wanted to go with since I'm huge into spice I went with a 6 because my date is not a fan of spicy at all but I still wanted him to be able to try it. As other reviews state beware of the spice if you're sensitive . For me it was spicy enough to give me a good kick of flavor and spice without burning my

When we walked in we were greeted with spices wafting around which was definitely a inviting sign!

They start you off with cilrantro and tamarind chutneys with papadam to nosh while you wait. 

BF has discovered Tikka so we decide to get their chicken tikka ($14) so he can try more of it and see a range. It was pretty nicely spiced and the chicken was tender.  I prefer a bit richer, almost creamy of a sauce, but that's just a preference that I tend to seek so this isn't my favorite version.

Aloo Ghobi ($13)- cauliflower, potato and spices sauteed together. The cauliflower was cooked nicely- soft but still with a light bite and the spices were flavorful but not overpowering. 

They ask how spicy you want it from 1-10. We got a 2 and it doesn't really register any spicy at that point. We want most things no spice to mild since the BF can't eat too spicy. 

We also grabbed some garlic naan ($3) which was pretty good to go with the meal. Dishes comes with rice and they will refill it if you need more. 

For dessert, we got some gulab jamun ($5) which are fried milk dough balls that gets a bath in fragrant syrup and served warm. The syrup had a light gingery taste to it and the dough was good. There were two golf ball sized pieces and though they were tasty, $5 is not proportional to what you got.  $2.50 a ball is like grabbing a oreo sized cookie at Bouchon bakery in the Venetian and we ain't on the LV strip. 

Service was attentive and nice. We got our drinks and rice filled and we were checked on.

Even though we were full from our dishes, for the price I feel it was a bit skimpy on the portions.  I think the restaurant.com certificate was a good way to try this place. Definitely though this area needs a place like this to bring us to more food and culture diversity so I appreciate when a new spot opens up that is something different. 

I'm curious about their lunch buffet. I'm with Rob on this one- probably coming back, but not running back for more.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,5,4,XmLumLmIRcnpYlDfKLnR8Q

We live close to here, so we've been here a lot over the course of 5 years +. We went again on Sunday night with some friends. And we can't ever say enough how this is the best Indian we've had in town. 
We've been all over because we love Indian food. But this is a major staple in Las Vegas. 

The dishes I recommend:

Mixed Tikka Platter - all of the tikka. All of it. 
Tikka Masala - Always one of my favs with chicken. 
Lamb Rogan Josh - we love lamb. And we love curry.
Shrimp Korma - Because you have to throw seafood in the mix.
Chili Chicken - just tried this for the first time and we were floored at how good the flavor was. 

But man, every time we try something else, it's always been amazing. 

When you go,  you have to try the Indian beers. Haywood is our favorite. Also, naan. Garlic naan, plain naan. You can't go wrong with naan. 

They do have a lunch buffet if you're wanting a variety, which is awesome as well.

Always excellent service and food. It will always be a favorite.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,59,34,5,k09-nivtDJLx9_t1WVtOww

Not only is it an excellent value for the money, but everything is fresh and delicious.  I am not an Indian food guy, so I don't know how authentic it is or how it compares to others...

But I will tell you, it will be hard finding a better way to spend the same money for lunch!  

The garlic naan bread was amazing...we ordered two baskets for the table and it was devoured quickly.  Some of the best ""bread"" that I have had....so so good.

I liked most of the dishes I tired, but a few of the meat dishes stood out, and were great to eat with the accompanying dipping sauces.  A few times the serving food went empty since it was very busy, but that meant fresh food was coming out within minutes.

Only bad thing....they were really busy...and it didn't look like their was much help on the floor.  The poor guy was literally running around in circles and was forgetting refills and pulling plates, but that was hardly enough for me to drop the review down a notch since it didn't ruin or affect our lunch here too much.

5278406,2014-05-30,1,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"Saffron Flavors of India is a rarity because so few Indian restaurants are located in Northwest Las Vegas. I've been to Saffron several times for the lunch buffet and during dinner, and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. The lunch buffet is on the small side but is only $11.95 (drink included)! The buffet has plenty of option for vegetarians as well. I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from. I last ordered the Mattar Paneer, $14, a curry dish with peas and spices. You can customize your level of spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10. If you're not a fan of spicy foods, I'd recommend staying under a 5 for sure.

For a group of 4, we were immediately seated and shortly after provided with a pitcher of water with ice and what I can only describe as paper-like tortilla chips with two dipping sauces. The service is generally alright, but sometimes we've experienced servers disappearing on us and long wait times on refills. Otherwise, the servers are friendly and polite. If service was more attentive, I'd definitely give this place 5 stars. When our dinners arrived, the server placed a single petite rice plate for all four of us to share. That rice was gone in an instant and we had to order another rice bowl. Other than that small minor inconvenience, everyone loved their dinners.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant- it's decorated well and feels intimate. There's also Indian music playing in the background. Saffron is my favorite Indian restaurant and is close to home. More importantly, the food is amazing! My personal recommendations are the Garlic Naan ($3.50) and Vegetable Samosas ($5).

5319907,2015-02-16,4,t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg,"This is the closest Indian restaurant to one of my offices and have been here only for dinner.  I'd probably spend an hour if I came here on my lunchbreak for their buffet and the whole afternoon with a food coma.

I like how spacious and open the layout is. When you can high-five the person at the next table, that's a bit too close and I like my personal space a bit much. We're always greeted by the eager servers/hosts/bartender as soon as we walk in.

The food is great. I must warn you though, you have to have a high tolerance for spicy food. Their spicy scale of 1-10 should not be underestimated. 1 is like Baby Spice. 5 is like a 7 in other places. 10 must be like Chuck Norris on your taste buds. The menu items we always get include: saag (with any protein), tikka masala (any protein), garlic naan and mango lassi. They give you a basket of papadums with mint dipping sauce and chutney. They're reasonably priced.

Mango Lassi:
Yogurt and mango in a drink. Great consistency - not too thick an not watery either. 4/5

Garlic Naan:
They're warm and delicious but when you get a freshly made batch - it's hot and glorious! They use a lot of garlic and possibly the most garlicky naan I've had in this town. 5/5

Saag (Shrimp/Paneer/Chicken):
Other Indian restaurants I've been to have a standard spice level for their saag. At Saffron, you can specify how spicy you want it. I think that's what I appreciate about this place. Sometimes, I just want my saag with a kick. I like scooping up the tasty spinach pieces with my warm naan. 5/5

Chicken Tikka Massala:
The blend of spices are incredible. We get this at spice level #5 and I'm sweating and reaching for my water. They're pretty generous with chicken. Properly cooked, not dry chunks of chicken. 4/5

Gulab Jamun:
My favorite Indian dessert. I'm hooked on these sweet cheesy balls. Their syrup isn't overly sweet and has a hint of rose. 4/5

Almod Joy Naan:
This is not a regular menu item. Warm naan loaded with chocolate, almonds and coconut. 3.5/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,2,4,AP-49P6WsYiPJnZ3sdvENA

Pretty much every dish I have had so far has been superb. Before I get ahead of myself let me tell you get the garlic naan! I love their naan and it comes out nice and hot. Next comes your main dish. The curry is always a go to. If you want something already mixed try the rice fields dishes as it's already mixed for you.They always ask you your spice level. I caution you if you have never eaten Indian food do not go for the 8 or higher right off bat for spiciness. You may end up like my friends who find it way too hot. I usually go between 3-7 depending on my mood. For dessert I usually do the Peshwari Naan. 

Service is great. They always come by to check and see if you need that water refilled and if you got a spicy dish chances are you do!

The service was fast, staff friendly and our server kept apologizing right till the end looking at our mouths burning.

We didn't have any problems with buffet selections running out or anything like that, as is mentioned in other reviews.  I'll definitely be back!",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,0,0,4,2HIFnx6UpERw6BsmZlacYQ

The portion size is pretty large to share with 2-3 people. If you are not used to eating Indian food make sure you stick to 1 or 0 for spicy. I ordered a level 3 of the chicken korma & my non Indian friends were screaming it was too spicy! Recommend you try it, they have a lunch buffet as well as take out! I did the take out and it was ready when I got there! Delicious food!",0Iy04fJxaKug-kYsi6gvWw,0,0,5,yi8xv3KJe1T_B4NTenw-MA

It is impossible to find Indian Chinese food, let alone GOOD Indian Chinese food. I had the chili paneer; it was LIFE-CHANGING. It was fantastic. I just wish this place was so out of the way, otherwise I'd be way more often. SO GOOD! They have other Indian options too, but trust me, try the Indian Chinese food!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,2,4,XB2HlLXv6Q1ifp9w5GEjVA

When you first walk into the place, you are welcomed by the scent of cooking spices. The atmosphere is warm and subdued and they have, what sounds like, contemporary Indian music playing in the background.

I ordered the Shrimp Vindaloo (I asked for ""extra spicy""), and some Garlic Naan (flatbread). Both were really delicious. The Vindaloo was served with rice, which was cooked perfectly.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive and, all in all, it was a nice dining experience.

I got there around 6pm on a Saturday night, and there were several tables filled. When I left (at 7pm), the restaurant was nearly full.

I'm really glad this place opened up near me. There is one other Indian restaurant in the Northwest part of town which, unfortunately, I didn't have a good experience with.

But, I will definitely be going back to Saffron, again!

I believe they have a lunch buffet, as well. I'll have to try that, sometime.",RR6e9Flzur-FRBXq3x912g,1,1,5,bcOILcIXu-7Prvmll-P9rw
