This place is an aberration.  The food is just OK, and the waiter neglected to bring out my coke even after asking for it twice.  The signs on the outside of the restaurant had embarrassingly obvious grammatical errors on it.  In general, the lack of attention to detail manifested itself throughout the entire meal.

My boyfriend and I had just gotten lunch at the Earl of Sandwich, when we were walking and saw Oyster Bay. We both LOVE oysters, and for $12 for half a dozen, that is the cheapest you are going to find by far. We are used to paying $20+ for a half dozen at most places out in LV for decent oysters. We sat at the oyster bar and talked to one of the chef's and the bartender for at least an hour over a couple of beers, shots and many oysters. They were super friendly and the oysters were super good! I will recommend this place to anyone, don't get scared off by the reviews. Now, we didn't sit in the dining room and didn't order any other food besides the oysters, so I don't know how that experience will be, but we will definitely come to this place for lunch or dinner for the full experience the next time we are in town.",-pgJsdaGBNuQC1HB9EtzFA,2,0,5,nJZ9krclwCLl-ccpnmbIUg

I liked it, but if you don't care for the noise, then I'd suggest just taking a seat inside.  

We didn't have any of the seafood/clam/oyster stuff so I can't really review on what they signature.  But we ordered some steak and pastas which were pretty good.  Their angel hair was a little over-cooked for my taste, I like al dente pasta.  The grilled chicken on my pasta was good though, I liked the aroma that came with every bite.

The service was horrible.  After ordering our drink, we put in our food order right away.  It took a while for the waiter to bring our drinks. (diet coke, ice tea and a beer)  We noticed that the restaurant isn't that big and it seem they had enough wait staff, however, it took 20 min before we finally get our drink.  
We waited 45 min and didn't see our food.  I saw a table that sat down after us already finished either food and paid.  Mind you we ordered oyster on the half shell.  Does it require any cooking???? why did it take 45 min?  

Anyways, we told the waiter to not bother with our food and we want to leave.  It was totally his fault for not putting the food order b/c he said our food will be out in 20 min.. I guess after we asked about our food, they started cooking the pasta we ordered.  The waiter was rude about it, he dropped off our drink check and just left.  There was no apology what so ever.

They have some great oysters here that make for a great starter!

Great place to come to if you have a group of 8 to 10, but also still great to come if it's just you and you want to suck down some oysters and have a glass of whiskey. 

They have as fresh as you can get oysters in Las Vegas. I did find it funny that their oyster monger had never been to the Ocean, but his knowledge of oysters was great, he even let me sample each one so I could choose the optimal dozen, which I appreciated because they had 4 different kinds and each one was TOTALLY different and the ones I thought I'd like were not my favorite at all...

The only thing I mark a star down is their seafood special (the lobster, crab, clams, etc.. was only ok) It might have been because that was when we had 12 people and mine was just steamed seafood, and everyone else's took longer to make so mine was sitting a little longer than I wanted.

Service was lackluster and just shy of failing.
If you have someone with a walking stick or walker who clearly has difficulty getting around don't take them on a round about tour of the store before sitting them at their table just a few steps from where they started. The excuse 'I can't go that way when there are customers' is not acceptable when you made no effort to explain that WE could take the shortcut and meet you at the table. Or, I don't know, seat them at a close table since they clearly have mobility issues. 

When the diners ask you questions that is the server's chance to shine and really impress. When asked ""What is the soup of the day"" the answer we do not expect is ""You can't have that"". Not only is that completely unacceptable, but it is easily misunderstood. I had to ask ""Why not?"" before being given the response ""We ran out"" and ""Well, it must've been good. What was it?"" to get the answer ""Cream of broccoli"". Which, BTW, is an obvious lie as cream of broccoli is clearly less of a hassle to make then lobster bisque or clam chowder unless you're just reheating things. The 'correct' answer and one that would've been more impressive to the question ""What is the soup of the day"" would have been ""The soup of the day is cream of broccoli, but unfortunately we've sold out and have no more remaining"". Not only does it answer the question, but makes it sound like the soup was really awesome (even if that's a lie). 

Also, when asked the question ""Do you have any suggestions"" you should try and push the menu or specials and give some insight. The answer ""Well what do you want to order?"" is not helpful and just makes it seem like you don't have time to deal with us. 

A point on the specials as well. If the restaurant is named ""Oyster Bay Seafood"" I expect actual seafood on the specials or properly offered. Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Pasta don't really scream 'seafood'.

Food was passable, but tainted by service and presentation.
A bread basket is provided that include some sun dried tomato focassia bread sticks and some plain bread. It is provided with the oddest combination of dipping oil I've ever seen. Typically you'd get extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar or olive oil and roasted garlic to have some infused oil to dip the bread. Instead it was a confused mess of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, and some generic 'Italian spice blend' that had no strong flavor to impart. When I asked the server ""That looks interesting, what is in it?"" I received the response ""A lot of things"" which just screams ""I don't know and don't care because I wouldn't eat it"". 

The lobster bisque was passable and had some sweet meat that tasted more like crab than lobster. Also it did not have the distinct taste of cognac that I'm used to in lobster bisque so it lacked that depth of flavor. 

The rib eye steak looked alright, but the prep cook has too much of a fascination with dried parsley. The plate was COVERED in the stuff which is a bit dated and adds nothing to the presentation or flavor. 

We were served a pasta dish and we had to remind the server, a good while later, for Parmesan cheese (which we knew they had due to being in the oil) instead of having it offered with the dish. 

The tilapia fish was pretty good and well cooked, but it reminded me a lot of some 'sweet and sour fish' you might get at Panda Express and not worth the $20 price tag. The side of wild rice was WAY too salty and just contaminated the fish as it seeped under it which brought the dish as a whole down.

All in all you may want to give this place a pass.",eUS7Ivtquhyw2xlxLFvVww,0,0,2,hDzleaMOz4jhrAGBTosFtQ

I ordered a 6 oz. filet mignon and eggs and replaced the potatoes with fruit...misadvertised since the supposed filet mignon was just regular flank.  I got potatoes instead of fruit.  When I told the waiter that I had  ordered fruit, he did not apologize and in fact when he went to the kitchen I could see him glaring at me from across the restaurant....talk about creepy.

I first came here years ago, before the days where I Yelped every eating establishment. Sometimes you just trust what you see and experience.

Located in the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood Casino, my girlfriend and I were looking for a place on Friday for lunch in the area, and after some disappointing displays at some of the other restaurants, came here.

There's something to be said about ambiance, and Oyster Bay certainly creates a very intimate setting. While the restaurant is actually indoors, there's a look and feel of a outdoor patio right on a boardwalk, from the decor of wooden posts lined with roped netting, and as diners people-watch passersby walking along the wooden flooring. Not far off is the rainstorm fountain, so the occasional thunder rolling and pouring rain can be heard in the distance, which makes you imagine you're in the southern wetlands.

Our meal came out as such:
Complimentary bread came with a saucer of oil, grated cheese, and vinegar. My refillable soda cost $2.95. A cup of soup (Lobster Bisque) was $4.95. A large bowl of the Clams Posillipo (topped with three slices of grilled garlic bread) was $12.95. The Capellini Pomodoro (which we substituted the angel hair pasta with fettuccine) came out $10.95.

The seafood is good overall: lobster bisque and anything with clams (like the Clams Posillipo). Portion sizes are plentiful. Our waitress Monica, and overall service, was attentive and fast; the refills kept coming, the food arrived in a timely manner. I will say that the sauces on some dishes can come out to be a bit potent (the clams a little salty, the pasta a little sour), but flavorful in the right portions.

No restrooms, so you'll have to find one in the mall facilities.

Order the SEAFOOD people!  They feature the simple, unassuming perfectly cooked type of seafood dishes found in Maryland seafood houses.

Food quantity was varied. Some dishes were mounded pasta but mine not so much. Sandy clams in a thin soupy broth that was reminiscent of Campbell's tomato soup. The tilapia was mushy. Cheesecake was ""meh"". Not recommended!

I chose to have the linguini spicy and I seriously could eat that every day. It reminded me so much of my time in Italy.

I have to admit I came here this time out of convenience and it because it was somewhere familiar.  

I ordered the Maine Lobster Fra Diavolo. I was disappointed to hear they did not have any Maine Lobster at a seafood restaurant for a regular menu item. My server, Angel S was very accommodating, he suggested substituting the half of lobster for a lobster tail and was ok with me.  I was pleasantly surprised when my entr√©e arrived.  The lobster tail was big!  It was cooked to perfection and the dish had an abundance of mixed seafood. Yum!  Diavolo is usually mildly spicy however the sauce was not spicy at all.  Personally I like garlic and chili and it definitely lacked both.  They offer $5 Peach Bellini, Mimosa, or Bloody Mary all day (weekday?)

to you when they were at your table but they didnt come to your table frequently enough in order to see if you needed anything. (Drink refills, bill,)  It seemed a little chaotic.

I walked across the hall on my way out and asked a waiter if they had the syrup and they did. Here's where the major plus for them... when I walked in this morning the waiter remembered me and then said, I suggest our pancakes, they're the best!!!

I brought my wife here because we were craving oysters. It was 5pm and it was happy hour (the only positive part of this experience), so we settled for it. The fellow yelpers are correct: the service is very, very slow. It took forever to get our drinks and to order our food. What I don't get is receiving the appetizers along with the entrees. What was the point of that? For appetizers, I ordered the half dozen oysters, and for my entree, I ordered the scallop scampi. Both were delicious and extremely expensive. It cost me $12 for six oysters and $25 for the scallop scampi. I still did not understand the concept on why we were there too long. Were they trying to sell the boring rainstorm? Whatever the reason is, if you decide to dine here, expect slow service from melancholy servers.

Let's start with the food: You can't mess up Caesar salad, in fact, it had a lot of parmesan in it, so I loved it! After that, I ordered crab cakes, which seemed a little over priced for 2 tiny crab cake patties, but I'm not exactly sure ($15 for 2 small crab cakes), although they were ok, not too flavorful, but what do I know? I'm not a crab cake connoisseur.  A friend of mine told me his sandwich was dry and another friend's order was wrong, a pork instead of eggplant sandwich.

One food runner ruined the name of Oyster Bay and all of their employees.  He was outright rude! 4 out of 5 of us ordered a salad with our meals, only 3 of us received salads at the same time.  When the hot food came out, they still hadn't brought out my friend's salad, so I asked the food runner if her salad order was put in, to which he responded, ""I'm getting it right now, I can't carry two plates at once,"" with the worst attitude I have heard from anyone in the history of customer service...ever.  

We waited for our food for a good half hour after we ordered, so long, that when we received it, it was luke warm and not fresh at all.  Another thing that totally turned me off about this restaurant is that their ladies restroom didn't have any soap, meaning ladies, including their employees, had to leave the restroom after handling their business to wash their hands (not cute).  We told the manager about our experience, which she pretty much told us she could not do anything about and asked for the check, which she proceeded to take another 15 minutes to give to us, but gave us a 15% discount.

The waiter took our drink and food orders all out of whack.  He would take a drink order from one person, but skip their food order.  Then the next person he would take their food order but not their drink order.  He didn't write anything down in the beginning, then once he got half way through our group of 6, he grabbed a drink napkin off our table and started asking people to repeat their orders.  It took him a good 20 minutes just to get our order into the kitchen.

It took about 30 minutes for the first plate to come out, which was a steamed clam entree.  It took another 20 minutes or so for the salads and appetizers to come out.  Then another 30 minutes or so for all the other entrees to come out.  I'm not exaggerating this wait either... cause that damn thunderstorm kept going off.  

My steamed clams were super salty.  The hubby ordered a Mediterranean salad with grilled salmon.  What he got was a Caesar salad with grilled chicken.  But by the time it arrived he had already been waiting over an hour and was starving so he ate it anyways.  My friend's shrimp scampi were so overcooked they were like rubber.  They just threw the cocktail shrimp on a warm plate making them very unappetizing.

Plus we had a coupon for a free cocktail. We all ended up getting things off of the specials menu and got an extra to eat as an appetizer. The appetizer was raw oysters, and there were two different kinds. I called them the fat ones and the small ones - though, I'm not sure where in Vegas they would get fresh oysters... oh well, anyway.... one friend ended up getting an ahi tuna salad. After much discussion about why they would sear salmon instead of cooking it other ways, she finished her entire meal, leaving the two of us in the dust. I don't even think she was that hungry, but I guess it was just a salad and some strips of tuna. She made it seem like it was really good nonetheless. I ended up getting a chicken pesto on penne. Reminded me so much of Gypsy's back in Berkeley. And though this one was good, it just wasn't as good as the Gypsy's one. I will say that the chicken was better in this one though, but the pesto sauce itself is better at Gypsy's. Maybe it's just more creamy there or something, but all the pesto sauces I get at other places just seem to thin in comparison. It was a ton of food, and we ended up bringing it all back to San Jose with us. I just ate it yesterday for lunch. YUM. Pasta as leftovers is always good. My other friend got Baked Ziti - it was good too. I had a noodle. We had a conversation about penne vs. ziti and how we thought ziti was just penne with straight cut edges. Turned out that here, penne was the same as ziti, so we felt dumb, but it was funny. Ended up bringing some of this back home too. I wasn't the only one to not finish my meal hoorah!

Me and my partner went for dinner the week before Christmas.

We were in town for a week.  This was the worst meal we had.

Waiter was very enthusiastic.  There were no service problems.  The hostess out front was charming.

Partner had the oysters.   He's quite the oyster eater, almost always ordering them in any seafood place.  He says they were among the worst he's had.  By and large for him it was a temperature thing.  Oysters are far better if they are really cold.  Some of his were pretty much room temperature.

I had the calamari appetizer. It was piping hot, if somewhat bland.  Large chunks of calamari, in a very light and tasteless batter.

He had the fish and chips entree.  I had the bacon-wrapped scallops.

His was, as he put it, frozen Mrs. Pauls fish stick quality.  Bland.  Unfresh (if that's a word).  

My scallops were possibly the saltiest things I've ever put in my mouth.   And they had a slightly funky 'maybe they sat out all day' sortof taste.   The side vegetables were overcooked and bland.

The bathroom is pretty dirty.  A dirty bathroom in a seafood restaurant doesn't instill much confidence.

I honestly wouldn't have been surprised to wake up the next day with food poisoning.

Dinner for two (no drinks) was around $70.  FAR too much for substandard seafood. 

In a normal mall in a normal city maybe you'd just say 'eh' and consider it a lesson learned.

But this is Vegas, with literally unlimited dining choices.

You can do far, far better.  

The funny thing is, when we sat down we had an uneasy feeling about the place, so we checked the Yelp reviews.  But we didn't heed them.  Our mistake.

Right down the corridor is Pampass, the Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse.  I didn't get a chance to try it, as I opted for Oyster Bay instead.  I regret that choice.

The place serves up sandwiches and the like, and most are tasty enough and filling.  I had to take home some food as the portions are pretty sizable.  I tried the Cajun chicken.  The meat was tasty, but I think it has a little too much bread for its own good, which filled me up more than the rest of the sandwich.

They just got Guinness in as a drink choice, and while happy for that, they serve it in a can.  I'm not trying to be snobby, but I would have preferred it on tap as I think that's when the drink is at its best.  

If you eat there, I would recommend outside seating.  It's fun to people watch, and the restaurant is right next to the Desert Passage's rainstorm effect, which I think provides for a better atmosphere.

For an appetizer, my husband ordered a half dozen oysters (one of the particular reasons we chose the restaurant) and I ordered an eight-dollar bowl of lobster bisque.  Of course, they were not as good as the seafood we could get right here in New England (and if I were a native New Englander, I wouldn't have ordered seafood in the middle of the desert).  Our favorite part of the meal were the entrees.  We ordered the filet mignon special for $19.99, which included mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  We both ordered the filets cooked medium rare, and mine was a bit on the rarer side but I loved it anyway.

The problem is that the food here is pricy and only so-so. It isn't bad, just bland. I have tried both their Filet Mignon & Eggs and the Eggs Benedict. My Filet was overlooked but since I was hungry I ate it anyway without complaining. The eggs Benedict were undercooked with raw egg whites and a very water hollandaise sauce.   Oh well, people don't come to Vegas for breakfast. 

Another good and bad point is that they open at 7:30 am but are not staffed to serve until 8:00 am. So I got to my table and had to wait a while to be served.
