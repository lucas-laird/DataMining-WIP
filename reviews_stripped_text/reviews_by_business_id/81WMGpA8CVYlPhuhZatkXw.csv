1264453,2018-05-29,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,I was in Vegas about a week ago and was craving something sweet at 2 in the morning. Luckily this bakery is open 24/7! It would've dangerous for me to live in Vegas knowing I can get my hands on yummy desserts any hour of the day. My only complaint is how pricey it is. The ones I chose were $9 each. I had a fruit tart and a key lime tart. They were both delicious and beautifully presented. The fruit tart was topped with a variety of fruits and the filling was not overly sweet. The key lime tart is my favorite. The tartness from the lime balanced well with the white chocolate. It left my mouth was watering the whole time. I can't wait to go back!,ZTb2huIBFYqwZkpZw6Wxfw,0,0,4,pvcRZ_QqxLYVL7M6nfNRkw

This is the same place that had the Jean Philippe store here.  Honestly, it is only a name change.  Everything else looks identical except it says Aria.

Food
I've only had the gelato.  I honestly could not taste the difference.  The prices on the chocolates and goods are the same.  Not cool Aria.    

Service
I didn't notice any difference in service.  They are still prompt and very Vegas style service.",YSG1faJQlIc-omsMec_eOQ,0,0,3,2W2kpHGqpiX3siAWE606xg
2124352,2018-04-15,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,"The days when Jean-Philippe Patisserie was there are definitely gone, unfortunately.
They kept the high prices, but they don't meet the quality anymore.
Flavors are plain. Or gone. I can't decide. There's no more creativity behind all their items. It's now way below average, with no interest at all. Go to Walmart, you'd find the same stuff and save money.
Seriously!",vrtwR7XZO6yq35zaxEZ6fA,3,0,1,utjP8JJnrfdj4mQj6Q-_8Q
2266611,2018-06-12,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,I miss JP. May keep coming on off days by mistake but the quality of the cakes seems to have dropped yet the prices are still $8.50 per cake. Fruit tarts now are full of apples instead of berries like JP used to make. Fruit tart custard texture and flavor has also changed for the worse. In general the quality and taste of the desserts have all seemed to recede. Ambiance and location are still great and still is a nice location for a quick coffee or snack whether you're on break from the poker room or just want to sit down for a bit.,ewAF0n1WprmjJgHefrb24A,2,0,2,HrHk_Ddw2kBKvTgkF-FdmA
2402879,2018-04-15,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,"I was a bit surprised that this was no longer Jean-Philippe's but they still had all the delicious goodies we've had before, and they're still spot on. Our favorites are the almond croissant (flatter, less flaky than the average croissant, bursting with almond paste) and roast beef sandwich (that roll! This sandwich is perfect for lunch at the airport later). 

I did spend some time gawking at the chocolates and macarons, and while I was the only customer there, not a single person asked if I needed any assistance or even a hello. So, I guess no chai tea chocolates for me. Just sayin', a hello would've been nice. Maybe I've just gotten too used to the stellar service at neighboring Mandarin Oriental.",f2c0zHEZf64GPxAcjP6pzw,1,1,4,vvb5XfpoVUXAeUyFhp5BVg

2886476,2018-04-07,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,"We were at Aria for six nights beginning on March 28. We stopped in our tracks when we saw 'Aria Patisserie' on the sign instead of the 'Jean Philippe' name we were so used to. Change! From a favorite to an unknown. Oh oh...or maybe not. 

The new Aria Patisserie is not the same. How could it be? Jean Philippe is a master at his trade. Where are the sticky buns with pecan? Where are the chocolate truffles so anticipated by those at home?

While we love staying at Aria, one shortcoming in my opinion is a lack of quick serve food places. I often walked over to the Monte Carlo food court for a quick bite but that is no more. Breakfast choices are basically limited now to the AP and the Aria Cafe unless you care for the buffet which now seems to be more of a brunch. There is more quicker eats later in the day with Five50 Pizza Bar (a favorite) and the Burger Lounge. 

It took me a while to warm up to the AP but I did find one item which successfully scratched my itch. That is the smoked salmon sandwich, served on a baguette with various toppings including onion, sliced hard boiled egg, capers, and a smear of cream cheese. 12 bucks seems to be about the going rate for most breakfast and sandwich choices but this sandwich could easily be shared by two eaters. Toasting or grilling the baguette would elevate this cold sandwich but it's really good as is. 

One morning, I ordered the three scrambled egg and bacon breakfast with toast for Joleen which she also enjoyed.

The line forms for this 24 hour counter service patisserie after about 8am and can look intimidating but it moves fairly quickly. 

They do offer a variety of pastries but if they could only bring back those awesome sticky buns.",RX2VX3mG9ngyRbldLSzCkA,1,0,4,KsnsRswkHmMx53J-OMB8JQ
3163779,2018-06-18,0,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,"High end dessert cafe with ice cream, sandwiches, breakfast items, coffee, tea, espresso, cakes, mini desserts, packaged desserts, pastries and cookies. The presentation and attention to detail was stunning!  I would highly recommend coming here. Compared to the Bellagio, Aria is superior in terms of presentation. But I did notice the pastries look similar and probably made out of the same kitchen. 

For those that think $12 for a dessert is over priced is crazy. The attention to detail, 100% made from scratch, and artistry are what your paying for. Also keep in mind this is Vegas. I also just paid $3 more for the same Starbucks coffee in my casino as I can get at home.",wzjQSt7pxb1LMHqTm8u7pg,1,0,5,nFmdkgNDtwzbSEO6HWnkDQ

Standing in single file line (cafeteria style) as you wait your turn. There was quite a bit of customers tonight, and seemed not enough help. 

Their croissant was flaky, buttery and incredibly good. Their strawberry/lemon eclair delightful and a must get. 

Definitely a great one stop shop for any cafe type needs.",qs8q8a7znZUseGkOepNf_w,5,4,4,ITDONZW5XkjUAsUgvj3JOw
4036766,2018-07-02,9,81WMGpA8CVYlPhuhZatkXw,"When I visit the Aria this was my go to place after the club, until it changed. It used to be John Felipe; which like most the reviews lean towards the loss and emptiness one can feel for a bakery goods store. 

John Felipe was magical, from the coffee to the fabulous pastries that they made in house. Their chocolate decadence has been replaced with this new establishment. The Aria does try to deliver this feeling that one could have with a bakery. But they still need some more magic dust!

The menu here is very extensive and well thought out. The desserts that they offer are more colorful than the old JP. I applaud them for keeping the business the same style and type when John Felipe went south.

The service still needs some work. At every occasion that I have visited this new concept by the Aria. The staff does not immediately recognize the guest when they walk up. You stand there very awkwardly wondering whom is going to wait on you. 

Eventually someday does come over but it takes them way to long. This is how you loose customers. Funny when waiting today two employees were fiddling with restocking and ignored my presence, and another customer behind me. It is random chaos to find an employee to take your order and give them money. It should be the other way around.

The strawberries with cheesecake that I tried was very good. The strawberries on top were fresh and not pre sweetened. The cheesecake was fluffy and gooey. It was properly cooked and all. Just a more loose cheesecake with a stronger graham cracker taste. The strawberries were surrounded by a lime chocolate piece with was very cute on top of the dessert. Especially since it was edible.

The raspberry muffin had lemon red sprinkles on top and was excellent. It was a well thought out balance for a muffin. This is the new tricks that they need more of. The red lemon sprinkles were what caught my eye. 

The muffin was very moist and had whole pieces of raspberries inside. The Pellegrino was the right sparkle that I needed to wash it all day. 

The dining area is very comfortable here and really clean. In fact they are still cleaning as I sit here now. Clean and Vegas are so important. Just think of the people that sat at this stool in a day. Too much math for me. 

The new menu is good, not great but I know the Aria constantly changing. The service could use a little boost here. I will return now that I know it is still way above par.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,27,20,4,I2iOHz6wpEns2F_SHXxG4g

Stopped in one night for an almond croissant and it was great. Flaky, buttery and that almond paste in the middle with shaved almonds on top. I was all about it. Very good for breakfast. 

We have yet to try the gelato but it seems to be quite popular. Service can be a little slow but it wasnt too bad a wait. I also stopped in one time to get myself a banana and the lady a caramel macchiato. She was very happy with her drink... Duly noted. The pistachio rice krispie treat wasnt bad either. Not too sweet with that distinct pistachio flavor.
