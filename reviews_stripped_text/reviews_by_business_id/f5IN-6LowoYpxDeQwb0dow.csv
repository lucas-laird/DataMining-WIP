They're lucky we can't prove it since after researching a possible lawsuit, I found that you need to bring leftovers to a lab for testing. Unfortunately, we threw the leftovers away. My entire household threw up about 20 times each. I'm not a fan of hospitals but we had no choice but to go. Dehydration level was dangerous, and our stomachs wouldn't hold a drink of water for more than 30 seconds. I should also rate sunrise hospital on here too. They we very nice and professional, but it took 2 hours of waiting and throwing up in the emergency room before we received an iv and pain meds. We were asked our symptoms and pain level by 5 different nurses/doctors assistants. Repetitive much?? But having to wait that long in a room full of people, while throw up every 5-10 minutes was tough. Every time I looked up EVERYONE was looking at me with an expression that said ""I'm glad I'm not that guy"".",r-4rg5sCvbvooMaccTQbMg,2,0,1,Pkah3lCGXnBddfQZYtlHuw

Well as I entered the door there was no kind of greeting or acknowledgement from anyone. So when I did order she aurally p actually was pleasant and nice. She made sure I had fresh hot fries and they had  spicy chicken here. Fries were good and chicken was fresh and spicy n like I wanted n it. 

Guess I will have to drive across town to this one if I want spicy chicken. But they need to work on their customer service skills. Asking $15 per hour you need to stepn it b up  fast food workers.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,1,4,jhlUqKLgk3MRA4Vi18u_lQ
2840544,2017-08-20,0,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,"Customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. My mom told the cashier our order and he ignored her and waited for me to tell him the exact same thing. He was very curt and unpleasant with his responses and seemed to be bothered by the fact that he was working. A little girl came in while we waited for our food and told him she wanted the $4.44 deal and he didn't even know what it was until she pointed out the poster on the window that advertised the deal. Then as we were leaving, the girl asked him if she could get her change and he said to her, ""Hold on, okay? I have to get another customer first."" That's not okay. You shouldn't withhold someone's money regardless of their age. Money has to be dealt with quickly first for obvious reasons. 

The food here has been good though, but I'm not sure I'll be coming back due to customer service alone.",XiHO1FMgsS2RCzsevmKAXQ,0,0,2,wGVcxxRNiqNhEh0RxYkiPQ
3023180,2014-07-30,3,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,"The service here is horrible!!  They recently opened within the last couple months on the lot that used to be Arby's.  They have screwed up mine and two of my co-workers orders the last 3 times we have went.  That's batting 100!  The drive through is slower than molasses and takes a good 15 minutes, even when there is only one car in front of you.  I don't understand how it takes so long to not even make an order right.  I even sat and watched an employee check my bag like 5x so of course, I'd assume it was correct.   And fast food workers want $15/hr?  Yea right!!",zbRjeEkON8EXFk_VrcTAiA,3,1,1,-QSNInSDg41egBx2k3OH3w

3236163,2017-05-21,0,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,"I've always liked Church's fried chicken - however, I haven't eaten fast food fried chicken in years, and this place is not far from where I live and I was listening to my cravings - it said, I want fried chicken.

so, I went.

Honestly, the location is in an area that can draw a sketchy crowd but, I lived in the area for years and I'm used to it.

There were only two people there making the food and I came at a time where it wasn't busy. One car in the drive through, and 3 customers including myself.

The cashier was pleasant. The person in the back may have been a supervisor or manager, he was doing the prepping and cooking. It was a two man show.

The customer service was a pleasant and I was in and out with my meal.

I may come back again in the future when those cravings hit me. Look for another updated review perhaps in the near future!

3400230,2017-05-06,1,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,"Hated it. I accept a certain degree of responsibility for choosing to go here since I never liked Church's. The chicken always seemed pretty flavorless and as a child my sister pronounced it ""hairy"", meaning it was the cheap crap that underwent careless processing so some of the pinfeathers were left intact. Hadn't been to one in years. 

When they opened one near me, I was absolutely not tempted by the flyers advertising specials involving dark meat and sweet tea. Yuk. I am not the demographic they're going for.

BUT. I was on my way home from grocery shopping, it was almost dinner time, and no way was I going to cook the same day I shopped. I actually had dinner plans with friends, so when I passed Church's on the way home, a faint pulse of guilt caused me to turn in to grab some dinner for the Anaconda. (He has been known to happily chomp away on many things I find distasteful; the fact that it might be either ""flavorless"" or ""hairy"" wouldn't slow his roll at all).

Well, considering the fact that I was tired from running errands and in a bit of a hurry, this was the worst mistake of my life. Once I got into the line, I was trapped, and it was NOT moving. After 18 minutes (I timed it), I was finally at the ordering station. No sign of life. So I honked and said ""Excuse me, is anyone there?"", to which I received an exasperated ""Just a minute!""
So I waited 10, and then called to her again. ""I SAID just a minute!!!"" No apology, no explanation, no civility at all. I assume she eventually came back to (snottily) take my order, but when the traffic crawled forward, I went with it, and when I got towards the front, I had the people waiting in front of me pull up so I could just leave.                                                       

30 minutes of my day and all I got was a brush with high blood pressure. I'm sure they were overwhelmed with the crowd, No one could have expected there were that many people craving feathery chicken legs all at once. But I put this squarely on management for not organizing the flow and making sure employees were at least trying to give basic customer service. Was it a one time mess up? I have no idea. I never went there again an I never will.

Good day, sir!",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,1,yAdpIswxTULQbwrLEcgFCA

3768134,2014-10-05,2,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,I love church's chicken but this location is ridiculous.  The employee are super slow and rude. I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made.,fWwAz1s7xUoCjQijoHIGgg,3,0,1,9ICDyNsOI2RRVSEN9jmEYQ

5925775,2017-09-14,0,f5IN-6LowoYpxDeQwb0dow,"This is the worst churches chicken in Las Vegas. They're the most disrespectful non-caring employees. Yesterday 9.13.17 about 4:30pm, none of the employees was wearing gloves when handling money and food, the restaurant is completely filthy. I came to this location a few times before because it was a new location. But every time I go they don't have something that's being advertising on the menu. And the employees are just rude. The food is never hot, it's like they're serving you food that's been sitting there all day. And when you kindly ask them to make it fresh they have an attitude or they will say no. The manager is never available, and the owner always seem to never order enough food to accommodate the demand. Please, I ask you all don't eat at this location. Popeyes is you best choice. I hate KFC but I would consider that before Churches again.",kX97VRdIhHlX44xpI08zKQ,0,0,1,f67l65e6FrKbpBO8jQINwQ
