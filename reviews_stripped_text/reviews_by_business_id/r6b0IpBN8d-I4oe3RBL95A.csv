The flavor they offered weren't appealing at all. Other than that the place looked pretty clean and the one cashier I talked to was nice. I'll definitely try something different next time I come out to LV! So two stars for the hard toppings and weird flavors.",Uh7skpId0683MYlYjCj1vA,0,0,2,_R9dFPblbX-Za_JmuA_2lQ

We had the chocolate chip cookie dough which was good but not amazing. Still worth the trip to try though! But the crepe was off the charts good! It was the banana, strawberry, Nutella one. So good!

Their chocolate and butter pecan ice creams are tasty and about $3.50 for a single scoop. 
Their chocolate strawberries, not so much. The chocolate didn't really have that great of a taste so we were disappointed by that. And two for $3 wasn't that bad.

The ""tart"" yogurt didn't have the light refreshing taste it should, instead resembled thick frozen sour milk. All of the fruit offered as toppings were either out of a can, or inedible looking. And the candy was stale and hard. My husband and I each chose the smaller cup, and only filled it half way. The total was $13.63. Outrageous, even for a tourist trap...and what's worse is it was so inedible we threw it in the trash.

Froyo is $0.45 per ounce and has just as many toppings as Yogurtland. My favorite so far is the lychee and it's consistency is almost that of a sorbet. There's also no sugar added in these yogurts which makes it somewhat healthier. I do think there are fewer flavors than typically at Yogurtland.

They also have a variety of crepes and waffles and ice cream sandwiches that look great as well - definitely hoping to try some more. 

For the kids or for a somewhat guilt-free dessert this definitely isn't a bad option if you're staying here. Their menu for other items is also decently expansive so there can be something for everyone.",YkMCNI3nVukPL_PIztHZJw,1,2,4,2AYhBsIsTu69r5tSsyQMWg

Froyo at $0.65 per ounce so you're going to end up with a very small cup of frozen yogurt if you want to keep the costs low. :) I think the froyo place inside Mirage is even more expensive at $0.79 per ounce so this place is actually cheap compared to Mirage. haha,5yGgNgkkNvsv6dYiA_whFw,0,0,2,nbUIv4Xd9lkfonHN4MpHpw

I'm local and was very anxious to try their edible cookie dough. I wasn't that impressed with it, the taste wasn't horrible it just tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. I sampled all three flavors (choc. chip, peanut butter and jelly, & butter pecan) I went with a half scoop of chocolate chip because their full scoop is much larger than your typical scoop and would have been way too much to consume in my opinion. I also got a scoop of butter pecan in a cone.
They get an extra star because the staff was incredibly helpful on offering samples and their opinions on flavors, etc..
Their prices weren't as horrible as I'm reading they are but that's probably because I'm used to Vegas prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but if I was ever inside of Treasure Island and craving something sweet, I'd return!",HIsY6T7YhkgRRCVZ6dPBIA,1,0,4,FAGPc5HoRetAKY-tkWKPmQ

Well it's a serve serve and it's by the ounce and has a topping bar so you can dress it up how you like. So I got the vanilla ( I know plain lol) and the $3 scoop of cookie dough because they say it's their signature and let's just say I was very underwhelmed. The cookie dough was soggy which I didn't even know was possible for yogurt and the vanilla had a weird after taste. The only thing that saves this place is you can dress up your yogurt anyway you want and it's really clean which is nice for a self serve place. 

Just know if you go here you will pay a premium for frozen yogurt but the product could be a lot better, I'm guessing that's why it's pretty empty. If it was around .35 a ounce it would be on par with the quality of the yogurt. I personally wouldn't Patronize this establishment again",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,3,1,3,sSJV_dlLgoxZLrfSsmZH7g

So,after a busy day I decided that tonight I was going to order a Crepe from this shop located in Treasure Island. I proceed to head over and so excited(and hungry) and when I arrived there I saw 2 Caucasian men waiting for the lady who looked and acting so pissed off at the entire world. So right then I should have left but,NO! I felt I walked all the way here for this crepe and I was going to get it...wrong! This woman didn't greet anyone who entered and was just awful! I am now the only one still in line after the other 2 have been waited on and gone. In walks a  Caucasian couple wanting samples which pissed her off! Finally! I said mam! I am standing right here. I have been standing here for awhile without no acknowledgment! She says""what do you want""! Now I'm ready to whip this bitch ass! But! I want my damn crepe! I said I would like to order a crepe with strawberr... you notice I was cut the hell off! She says ""No! That takes too long and we close at 12! I said mam! It's 11:45!!!!!!!!!!! She said""No! We start to shut down at 11:45 and close at 12""! OMG! I was so damn mad I wanted to reach over and choke the shit out her rude old ass! Why in this day and time are people so damn awful to others? Why have a business that hire this type of person allow such behavior? Why even support such a business that think this is ok and except our hard earn money? Never again!

I managed to get some chocolate cappuccino swirl and a mango-strawberry swirl.  I was surprised at how expensive the tiny portion was that I got, $6 and some change.
