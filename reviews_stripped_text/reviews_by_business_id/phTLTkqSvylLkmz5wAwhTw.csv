I called a day ahead to order the food, requesting that I come pick up the appetizers and that they deliver the main courses about an hour later. They were very accommodating, having the appetizers ready at our agreed upon time, and delivering the rest of the order to our home about an hour later. The food was plentiful, hot, fresh and the bill wasn't too bad (about $100 for 8 people, and we had leftovers!). I would definitely return to this establishment. Nancy and her mom were very nice! The only reason I didn't give the restaurant a 5 star rating is that while the food was great, it was a bit on the ordinary side (which was fine!)....",3_BtmfEZQL0B6G6hcY3oIQ,0,0,4,iQagTfZPiZp416-IhDYwxA

Spring rolls were so greasy the wrapper was soaked within the 5 mins it took to drive home.  Then blotting with paper towel soaked up another full towel full of grease.  Dipping sauce was gelatinous. Orange chicken was tough and breading soggy.  Took loads of antacid to get over this meal.  On the plus side the counter girl was sweet when she rejected the coupon because small print said dine in only and only within certain time frames.  Really!

Again, consistency is key, although from my taste, not a perfect menu...from egg foo yong sauce thickness to how many Malasadas in your to-go tray sure makes a difference.

They are thick, full of flavor and not the 'spring rolls' that these restaurants tend to make nowadays.  That being said, the rest of their food pretty much stinks.  Their Kung Pow anything and Mongolian anything is very salty.  The Chow Mein is not saucy, just imagine spaghetti noodles with soy sauce only.  The Singapore noodles are fairly good, but you don't get a good amount for the price.

2487124,2016-10-08,1,phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw,"I ordered from these guys tonight using BeyondMenu. I've ordered from this restaurant many times before and I've never had an issue. The food has always been good and the service is matched. 

Tonight was completely different though. I ordered the family dinner A and it gave me a list of eight options for my rice or chow mein item. I chose the combination chow mein. I added a couple more items and I put my order through which totaled $35, no problems. 

I received a call from the store about three minutes later. Some young girl, who didn't tell me her name, tells me combination chow mein isn't available as an option for family dinner A. So I ask her if that's not available as an option, why is it listed on the website they use for online ordering (BeyondMenu) as an option? She answers me ""we've never had a problem like this before."" I told her if it's an option available for me to choose then it is an option available. All I hear is silence then she responds by saying nobody else has had this problem. 

Now I'm pissed because I have a store calling me after I placed a $35 food order and telling me I have a problem. I demand to speak to a manager and this girl tells me they have a manager but they're not in the store right now and they're not available to speak because they're not there. 

So rather than owning their mistake and honoring the items offered on the website they use to place their orders, they lose a good size dinner order and a repeat customer. 

I hope the management from this restaurant reads these reviews and does something about this because it is absolutely ridiculous!",V5-jX5LheSctLfa6_cABcg,4,1,1,x9_viSr0BXOVUsZX7HzSqw

This place is just annoying. I have been here 10-15 times, and they cooked the chicken right 1 time. The Chef cooks food only 1 way, his way, which is nearly inedible. 

Great prices, yucky food... The noodles that come with the lunch are absolutely repulsive.

2909707,2012-11-20,2,phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw,"So we were headed out of Vegas on N Rancho and craving Chinese so I looked on yelp and saw this place.  There was only 1 review but it was favorable so we decided to try.  First of all the address is N Rancho but its really way on the side of the shopping center on W Craig.  We nearly missed it, we actually gave up and was leaving the parking lot when someone in the car looked back and saw the place.  So we turned around and went back.  Nothing to look at from the street and someone in our party was like ""nope"" lets move on.  I said let's just look inside and decide then, I have no problem checking a place out and leaving after looking things over.  Well it was clean inside and they had a good variety of dishes.  The lunch specials caught my eye at only $5.55 including a drink you couldn't beat that.  They serve you in the to-go container at least the lunch specials were. One of us had the Thai noodles which were very tasty and full of shrimp and it was served on a paper plate.  All of us had enough for left overs and ate the rest for lunch the next day.  This place is worth a try.  I would certainly try a few more things on the menu if I was local.  It satisfied our Chinese craving at a very reasonable price. Very friendly staff and fast service.  Not a big fan of the plastic forks and spoons.  I'm used to my Chinese places having real dishes and silverware and then packing your leftovers up.  Perhaps they are a big to-go order location so thats why they do it that way.  But either way the food was good and price was right.",Tzdu8NMT7Sv87HLkpHl1LA,5,4,4,6WVqLR_eNpGRwa-DVRf4YQ

3733577,2016-02-20,1,phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw,"My first visit here was horrible. I ordered two chicken chow me in and chicken fried rice to go. The young lady checking me in could hardly understand  me I had to point to what I wanted to order which is fine. But I also tipped them for a to go order thinking I'd get good service. I was wrong. The girl handed me my order in such a hurry and said ""everything in bag"". There was no soy sauce or any utensils. When I asked where they were she just pointed like I was an idiot. I said this is my first visit here. She just turned and walked away but was gladly helping another man that walked in behind me. When I got my order home. The chicken is super soggy and it has no flavor or veggies only one slice of carrot. The fried rice is over cooked and dry and the egg rolls are by far the WORST  I have ever had! I've never had a crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside eggroll. It wasn't even edible I had to throw it away. So thank you golden china for being close to home I will gladly NOT give you my business or any referrals I will take my business back to new York china on lake mead and rampart.

I love chicken chow fun. Its one of my favorite dishes, period. I ordered it again tonight with my heart and my stomach set on those delicious chewy noodles. My first bite I knew something was amiss. I kept chewing the chicken and it did not break down. I spit out that piece and tried another thinking I just got a gristly piece the first time. Nope. The next piece was even worse. I tried to break apart a third piece with my hand and that help firm. I don't know what they did to this poor chicken but it was very cruel. I ended up seeking and removing all the chicken from my chow fun and ate the noodles only. They were actually quite good. I've got to give them that.

I also ordered another favorite treat tonight, Spam musubi. I was less than pleased with this too. There was far too much rice. So much I could hardly bite into it. The Spam was good as was the nori and sauce. But the rice in all its bulk was not great. There was a strange minerally or rancid taste. I removed the excess and ate just the Spam and nori. 

I hope I just caught Golden China on an off night. I've been eating here for about four years and I've always liked it. I want to continue liking it. I'm not so sure about that right now.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,6,4,2,DPGzpeh_WSuB_3dEjoPLiw

Was just ok ! But everything else was really good ! I never dealt with a person other then delivery man because I used grub hub but order always correct! 5 stars all the way around! Considering the other place around me are gross you go into store and salt shaker is stuck to table......is it glued ? Nope! Or the other place is on dirty dining. ......... AGAIN! Nope so far this place rocks !,fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,0,0,5,7EWxZutN1OSzqMabJAGFhA
5842701,2018-04-17,0,phTLTkqSvylLkmz5wAwhTw,This place is amazing. I had pad Thai it's was good and I got Mongolian beef that was absolutely fantastically amazing. It's a family owned business. It was a bit pricey but it was worth it. Big portions and kid friendly.,_GwgR1lpURbFTuTjGsxdYA,0,0,4,iPphsr7khomf5qSc-kl41A
