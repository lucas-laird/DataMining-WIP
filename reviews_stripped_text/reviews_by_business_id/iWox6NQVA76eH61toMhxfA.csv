My salad was the spinach salad which was spinach, apples, feta and walnuts with an apple-cider vinaigrette. They were both very good, they portions were really large and I couldn't finish my meal. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The only thing I would have done was put less mayo on my sandwich, but it did have really good flavor. The bread tasted fresh and they put a lot of meat and cheese on the sandwich. The dressing was really good and light.

Dismal food quality and quantity.  Incredibly overpriced!  Nearly $13 for a sandwich and a bowl of soup.  No drinks or chips in that price.

It's a fairly new place near my office and I decided to check it out.  I got a pannini sandwich that had almost no meat on it at all..  It came with a side of orange slices that appeared on the verge of rotting.  I also ordered a large bowl of chicken noodle soup.  It should just be called noodle soup.  There was less than one tablespoon of chicken, a few small bits of carrot and just a bunch or waaaay over cooked noodles.  So over cooked that you cannot tell they are noodles when you eat them,.  Just pure mush.

I'll never go back.  Silly me!  It's my fault.  This is what happens when I decided not to go to Capriotti's.  I'll even take Subway over this over-priced rip off.",2ubFYvxy0RwoyV5EUJiOgA,3,0,1,PJRCtQ2gOu35c7JIMmImXw

I think it's the cheap Tyson or Hormel chicken that you get in the freezer section that I wouldn't even feed to my dog.  I ended up unwrapping the wrap and getting all the fillings except for the chicken.

I decided to give it another go.  Got the Bandido and the bread wasn't cooked all the way through.  I tried and tried to keep eating, but just couldn't stand the mushiness from the bread.  I kept examining it to make sure it was the bread because the flavors were very good, but ended up tossing more than half the sandwich :(

I ordered the Med sandwich.  I opted out of the red wine vinegrette and instead requested for the spicy ranch sauce.  I also ordered a side of cole slaw.

1. I opened the cole slaw and immediatly noticed that it wasn't a mayo based cole slaw.  Alright no problem.  Mayo based is my favorite, but i enjoy vinegar based slaw as well.  First bite, no flavor.  2nd bite, no flavor.  I see some kind of liquid has been added, but it wasn't vinegar.  I'm not sure what it was but it was absolutely flavorless.  Didn't finish it!  Plain shredded cabbage is not coleslaw!!

2. My sandwich.  I opened it up, and found no spicy ranch sauce, and no red wine vinegrette.  It was a completely dry sandwich.  Dissapointing to say the least.  I goto the fridge, and get my bottle of creamy parmesan ranch and ate the entire sandwich.  It was good despite the bread being a bit on the dry side.

3. The first 2 complaints wouldn't have been enough for me to leave this negative feedback.  It's this third complaint that was the icing on the cake.  When i bit into my sandwich, i bit down into something a bit hard.  Not enough to crack teeth, but enough to let you know, something isn't right.  i spit it out, and it was a chunk of lettuce core.  How cheap and/or lazy do you have to be, to not spend 10 seconds to core your lettuce before shredding it?!  Really!!",VX41TL3qmWOLhsO6yNIEjg,0,0,1,GVZ35KObsiQgM8DJjRJHnQ

The place was moderately crowded for lunch, but the wait was terribly long, so long that a manager decided to stop by and ask how long I was waiting.  New help in the kitchen?  Perhaps.

To say the quality of the food here is ""mediocre"" is an overstatement. A compliment in fact. Because frankly the food is barely edible. What's worse, one of my pet peeves is when a food establishment calls its food one thing when it's not actually the case. I believe that's called lying. Or at the very least, false advertising. Like when a restaurant claims their orange juice is fresh squeezed when it is actually from a bottle (you know who you are, Eat), or in the case of this terrible place, calling frozen chicken that's been microwaved as grilled. I mean come on. In what world is that the same thing? You can't just get fresh chicken and grill it if you're gonna call it grilled?

Not even close, sorry. No worries, I don't like to waste food, so I picked it off. Unfortunately, the sandwich was pretty much flavorless, which you wouldn't expect since it has corn relish, avocado (spread) and Chipotle mayo.

Tried the pick two combo- half a sando, half a salad, and a spicy pickle for about $8. GOBBLER sandwich (peppered turkey, feta, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato mayo) had little to no feta nor artichoke hearts, as I could not detect them at all in the sandwich that I consumed. The PARISIAN salad (grilled chicken, bleu cheese, EVOO mayo, avocado, bacon, red onion) sounded tasty, if remarkably unParisian- but it was presented thrown together with minimal toppings, and sided with a huge heap of guacamole, which went with neither dish on the plate? Guess they know their food has no flavor, and that must be their attempt to fix it?

Service was polite, plate was delivered to my table after ordering, but I was never checked on to ask about the discrepancies with my dishes.

1995145,2012-09-06,0,iWox6NQVA76eH61toMhxfA,"I first visited this Spicy Pickle location shortly after they opened, and experienced a VERY long wait time (10 minutes) for a simple panini that wasn't nearly toasted enough and a side of pasta salad. Assuming that this was merely because the staff was new and there was a big lunch rush there, I figured it would be worth another chance. Based on my second experience, I don't think I will be giving them a third chance.

The dining area only had a few patrons, and there was no line when I got to the counter. I ordered a combo with a half Basque panini and a green chili corn bisque soup (about $8) and stepped aside to wait for my order. FIFTEEN minutes later, after several other orders were brought to tables or given to other take-out patrons, the employee who was expediting food asked me, ""Are you Lisa?"" No, I'm not Lisa. He shuffled through a few tickets (where he obviously didn't find mine), asked me what I had ordered, and then asked the gal making sandwiches where my order was. She said gruffly, ""I don't have anything for Amy."" Great. Instead of apologizing for making me wait needlessly, they slapped together a sandwich that was 50% apple, 25% mustard, 24% spinach and 1% ham and then put it on the panini press for about 10 seconds. I will say the soup was delicious, but all they had to do was ladle that into a cup. I not only waited while nearly every other patron dining in and taking out received their orders before me but I was then rewarded by receiving a half-assed sandwich assembled by ambivalent staff. The ratio of ingredients made for a very weird flavor. A mustard-coated granny smith apple sandwich is not what I ordered.

Lunch rush sandwich places are a dime a dozen, and I am lucky to have quite a few options close to my office. It's great to have something a little more special than the Subway across the street, but with so many dining choices, customer service is key.

I ordered two half sandwiches, a drink, a cup of soup, and a bowl of soup. I tipped a few bucks at the register before receiving my order. They asked if I wanted my receipt and I said no. When I received my order, I got two cups of soup instead of a bowl and a cup. I told the waiter I needed a bowl rather than the cup, because I received the wrong size. He then looked at the receipt they keep and told me that's not what I paid for. I am annoyed because it was miscommunication and my tip was more than enough for the difference of what I supposedly didn't pay. If I knew my order was wrong, I would have corrected it. Hah, I know I'm complaining, but it just made me annoyed that they didn't consider my tip. I know what ordered regardless if it was rung in wrong. Additionally, my signed receipt they kept only had the total price and not breakdown. What you need to know about the food is that it's pretty good, like Panera. The side pickles are very tasty.

I was so full I did not eat for the rest of the night and took a slice home which was half of my breakfast the next day.  I am always conscientious of eating healthy avoiding all but complex carbs on a typical day so I asked a lot of questions from the guy who helped me about what he recommended etc. 

I am really picky about what I eat since I used to manage a family-owned ""Best of Las Vegas"" restaurant with my mother. And I am telling you this place is so delicious.

Like I referenced before, the guy was so helpful and patient.  Answering at least 5 minutes worth of my questions before my settling on my order.  He was so helpful in fact with his recommendations that I tipped him two dollars.

Later when he delivered my food he noticed me fiddling around on my HTC EVO 4G.  He mentioned that they do groupons frequently, and that I should look into it for next time.  Very friendly, and I appreciate the suggestion that I save myself some money.

After my first review I tried the bronx panini.  Unfortunately, that sandwich had some pretty generic Vons coleslaw on it.  I wasn't impressed.  I'll stick with the bandido.

I realize the food is very fresh and the sandwiches are quite different from other sandwich chains, but still... I think their pricing may be due to the fact they also make the personal pizzas, and they do paninis as well. I can imagine that's kind of costly to a place that is this small. 

I have had Spicy Pickle before I went to this new one in Vegas which is located off of Warm Springs. They opened a Spicy Pickle in Reno when I lived there many moons ago. I remember going a few times and thinking it was pretty good.

On my visit I had the Santa Cruz sandwich ($7.95). And all sandwiches come with a selection of a side: fruit or macaroni salad, or you can upgrade to an actual salad as well, but its costs extra. I opted for the macaroni salad, because I've had it in the past and it is actually very good. It never comes out slimy or gross, but is actually light and tasty, considering it's macaroni. My Santa Cruz was very well put together. The lettuce was crisp, the bread had a nice feel to it, and the other toppings/meat were plentiful, yet not over-bearing. I hate it when I get a sandwich that is busting at the seams, just not my thing. My meal also came with spicy pickle (how appropriate...)

Comparable to... Capprioti's in my opinion, but SP has a lot more selection. The prices are comparable, but SP has a completely different vision from Cap's. You might also compare it to Quizno's, but then again SP is much higher-ranking than Quiznos taste-wise and freshness wise. 

There's a lot of selection here. That's their strong point. If you're looking for something different that you've never had before in the sandwich world, SP would be for you.

We ordered from this location on Thursday 8/14/14 and the sandwiches were pretty good as well as the sides, cole slaw & potato salad.

Today Friday 8/15/14 we decided to order from here again, pickup as well and this time the sides were VERY disappointing.  We got two cole slaws and the containers they put the to go stuff in is not very big to begin with, but one container was only about half full and the other one was even less then half only about a quarter.  REALLY???  

They charge a fairly decent price but when paying $6 to $8, you expect to receive the value for the money paid. 

Consistency is NOT something this place has.  We ordered two Piadina's both exactly the same and one had more substance to it then then other.  One had two pretty good halves, the other only had one full half and one which was half bread with a little substance. Again not a good value for the price being paid.  Both halves should have been equal and the sides cups should be full.  I guess the food is not being checked by anyone before it is given out, it is just made by whomever is in the kitchen that day and given out with no quality control checking.

Service is fine. Nothing extraordinary. 

The food isn't good. I have seen almost every sandwich offered on the menu and the bread is huge and the meat is disappearing! The meat is not good. It tastes like the cheap kind you get in the refrigerated section pre-sliced. You own a restaurant the least you could do is slice your own!  The cheese is flavorless. I'm not sure they could slice the tomato any thinner. Nothing about any sandwich is good or worth going back for. I also had a flat pizza. Not good. It was dry and flavorless! I found myself wanting some red pepper just to have some flavor. I won't go back here unless there is nothing else. It isn't good.",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,0,0,2,0UMQK18kqqpZS1peZTaFoQ

I got the wise guy sandwich with macaroni salad and their infamous spicy pickle. To my surprise the spicy pickle itself was delicious, crunchy with a kick at the end and the salad was to die for! The ingredients inside of the wise guy were good but the bread was tough and scratched the roof of my mouth. It made it difficult to enjoy the sandwich but I couldn't complain after receiving a filling amount of food for only $8.50 which is a good buy of you're not looking to add on any extras. I still prefer Jimmy Johns or Port of Subs though.",xQEkhgrEyU1ssUhum0WZdw,0,0,3,pMMLnac77_GjWQo5o9Tdgw

Other than that, it needs some serious work especially if it wants to compete for lunch business from the nearby business parks. I decided to check the place out for lunch recently and ordered the chicken Caesar salad in a spinach wrap to-go at 12:45pm - simple, easy, quick. There were about 10 people in front of me waiting for their orders if you include both the line and the people waiting for food, with a smattering of guests seated at the tables enjoying lunch. So, I was slightly shocked when I looked down at my watch and noted that 15 minutes had passed since I had ordered - and still no wrap. All told it took 18 minutes from payment to sandwich in hand, a near travesty for those of us who need to get back to work at lunchtime.  There were two cooks in the kitchen and they maybe turned out a combined 12 orders in the 18 minutes I was there. This is a counter-service lunch place, the kitchen should not be crawling along at a glacial pace while the manager pokes away at the POS with a clipboard (partially ignoring some customers waiting to order by the way).

As for the Chicken Caesar Wrap, well it was not like any other Caesar that I have ever had! First off, they used feta instead of Parmesan (even though the menu says Parmesan) - a completely different flavor and texture that was off-putting. Next, I had hoped for a homemade Caesar dressing but whatever dressing they used tasted closer to soy sauce than to Caesar. I would have settled for something out of a squeeze bottle. Finally, the chicken was ""meh"" - your average quick service sandwich strips so nothing redeemable there. Trying to hard to ""spice"" up what should be a straight-forward sandwich left it unrecognizable as what was advertised.

Overall, this outlet needs to up their game. Its in a competitive lunch area surrounded by business parks and should be able to make a killing. However, if the kitchen can't keep up, the management is checked out, and the food is mediocre then its going to have a hard time. Normally, I like to give places at least 2 chances, but I honestly don't think that I have the time! If it took almost 20 minutes to get a cold wrap when it was not busy, I definitely couldn't fit it in my lunch break if the place was slammed!",Y33qF7OEmrE9fshgQ94jEg,2,0,2,4TJgL-f4l4OqVVkS9BxteQ

My boyfriend got some limited edition buffalo sandwich which also wasn't all it was made out to be.. We also were limited on what could be ordered since they were out of certain soups and don't serve breakfast paninis after a certain time. Basically it's a downgraded version of zupas but pricier! Not an expensive place- but for what we paid we could've have a better meal, more options and a side of bread and chocolate covered strawberry ..",fkf5UTsQTakNIAiwZfDW5g,0,0,2,YMT90Np3xM69vvNK5ikcgg

5848427,2014-10-19,4,iWox6NQVA76eH61toMhxfA,"I made the worst mistake coming here for the first time one day during lunch time at work. I happened to run into it while looking for a 7-11 which happens to be next door. I tried it and decided on the Bandido Panini because the ingredients sounded yummy. The menu stated peppered turkey, pepperjack, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, and chipotle mayo.Ok well that sounds good right? I was totally wrong because this panini that I ordered to go was a huge disappointment in a bag just waiting to explode in my face! They state the Panini is built on Fresh Baked Rosemary Focaccia. Well I don't know about that because it taste like flavorless cardboard. This crap was not cheap either, the combo which is a small Panini, small side and soda set me back like $11 and some change.

I am sad to report this is a 1 star trash dump of a rating. I wasted my taste buds and money on a bad decision. I learned my lesson.

The photo I took you can see is prior to taking a bite. This bland and flavorless Panini should have been posed in the casket it belongs down in trash land.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,0,1,S4bg2-eM_r7Ts5EyI5Z_jA
