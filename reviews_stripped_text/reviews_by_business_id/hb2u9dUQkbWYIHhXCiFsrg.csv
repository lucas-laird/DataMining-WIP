You're walking through MGM, hungry, looking for some cheaper options to eat. And if you're not feeling burger, taco, or whatever the other cheap crap is being sold..than Pizza is it.
 
  So I decided to go with the Pizza and wings (see picture). It wasn't fantastic, it wasn't cheap (It's Vegas) or expensive (it's not Aureole).  Bottom line after reading Bill C's story.. throwing up in Vegas I would assume is 99.9% due to over consumption alcohol rather than food poisoning.  So keep that in mind. Anyway it's not a bad place for pizza, but again...it's nothing I'd go out of your way for.

2227890,2011-08-19,0,hb2u9dUQkbWYIHhXCiFsrg,It's a shame that this place closed down in Stratosphere.  They had the most delicious deep dish pizza.  They were open late and always hit the spot.  Mama Ilardo's you will be missed.  I hope they open up in another hotel on the strip.  It was well worth it.,Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,0,0,5,sL_gSAwUpNyKKJaJcXyBQQ
2598900,2009-02-12,1,hb2u9dUQkbWYIHhXCiFsrg,"omg Chicken WINGS!!!!!

They served really good chicken wings, and it's changed how I see Las Vegas.  I now see it with Mamma Ilardos greasy, yellow chicken WINGS!  

I liked that I could just request for the juicy, tender wings (and not have to deal with the drier, drummettes), and that they were open 24 hours!",4_fkSSTFYEUXYPhtpbsAJw,1,1,5,IQDuEs4NgLkxhnD68zr-Ig

One night I waited an hour in line to order, that was around 2-3am.
It was a horrible wait after a long night out in my heels, but it was all forgiven once I had a bite of the chicken wings. $5 for 1 order.
The pizzas are pretty good, especially b/c they reheat them through the oven.

1 large deep dish veggie pizza was $35! My arms hurt from carrying it.

4 stars for their chicken wings + open 24 hrs.",Uit6vvFxthHbwOHIYI0sfQ,1,0,4,5Q3IXOI9caMzuvLLSIVN8Q
3238046,2008-08-27,0,hb2u9dUQkbWYIHhXCiFsrg,"One of the tasty cheap options at the MGM Food Bar area.. Under 3.50 for a huge slice of either NY style of thick crust pizza. I tried the veggie and the pepperoni thick crust pizzas.. both were bready and had a decent amount of toppings. Plus they have a family special, 25 bucks for a large cheese pizza and 4 drinks.. you could easily feed 3 guys with the thick crust pizza.. seriously thick!!",p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,0,0,3,8eWnqHcviA-Roq2HswpXPA
4621384,2009-12-03,3,hb2u9dUQkbWYIHhXCiFsrg,"I think this was the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. We went there after the UFC show at Mandalay Bay--at about midnight, and just wanted a quick slice. The line was super long, but it moved quickly. 

The pizza was gross. Dry, flavorless, disgusting. Like it had been sitting out for 2 days. We both felt sick after eating it. What a disappointment!",0l_mc4dHJm9kg1PqaO77qQ,3,1,1,cMIMihO0LJcZT0DUIs91Zg

Must try the classic pan pepperoni and the classic wings.
Crust is 1.5 inches thick, but melts in your mouth.
Open 24 hours.
Line could be long, but give it a try.

One of my favorite pizzas ever!",VYOQLKuR0Ugy9lU-QiOuLw,0,0,5,UT_PjszxbP0B4bDHFTGzUg

5813429,2008-12-24,1,hb2u9dUQkbWYIHhXCiFsrg,OMFG this shit is crack!  I ate her for dinner two nights in a row.  I lost all my money so I had no more left to eat.  Fortunately the cheese pizza here was awesome.  I only had the NY style.  The deep deep looked like it had too much bread.  What really makes this pizza crack is the sauce.  It was pretty damn good.  If you are going to order 4 slices for yourself I would recommend ordering a medium.  You save $1.  Woot!,LU7ikPXZ5R8tv4oNQZQkKw,1,0,5,QPD0qyedu_gmJZ0qIclG-g
