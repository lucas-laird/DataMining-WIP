769652,2013-02-06,2,94BEy7wGKmrOC7sjSHMisw,"Charlies has excellent food and service.  It has a great location at Durango and Sahara, and is a huge, clean, stand-alone building, beautifully landscaped in the front seen from the intersection.  The hitch is the parking lot and entrance at in the back, so it always looks closed or ignored from the busy corner.  After moving to the neighborhood and actively looking for good spots near our home we kept passing on Charlies since it never looked busy.  Fortunately we did make the chance stop-in and were delightfully surprised.  
Charlies needs to either promote its assets of do something in front to tempt passers-by to go in and give it a shot.
I've had their Steak & Eggs late a few times and it is the best inexpensive steak i have found anywhere.  All their food is well presented and good.  
Charlies web site sucks however, that can't help, and their FB page looks hijacked.",6ywcryHllu7kJyPqPYF2jg,0,0,3,1IuKi8U83gZ2aFhYs05pCQ

The food is Food Service, and not particularly spectacular.  I read some one describe the steak as ""good for reasonably priced""~ Not something I could see eating twice on purpose~ So service is interesting, atmosphere less than threatening, and near some decent places for a meal~ And after reading the other batch of opinions, seems like the most complimentary thing past the service is ""Close to home""~",zq6x1AKzX2GhK2mFi8wK6g,0,0,3,K2lVY9Iu6F6j-zcQGiOOdA
1122232,2015-05-11,1,94BEy7wGKmrOC7sjSHMisw,"I just left lakeside charlies as an avid customer of 500 bucks a night because of the bartender telling me to not converse with the other customers. The time I was there was 5/11/2015 at 2:00 am.  I lost 400 bucks tipped him 10 bucks on 2 drinks and was told by him to shut up and mind my own business when I interjected on a conversation about MMA boxing.  The patrons that I interjected on were ok with my conversation but the bartender was not.  He made his point that he could care less about the 500 I put in the machines and through the loss I  still   tipped him 5 bucks a drink.  I also work for tips and could not dream of talking to a customer unprovoked like he did.  I have lived here 12 years and this is my very FIRST complaint on Yelp or anywhere that I would say this.

The food is decent enough but not all that special. There isn't a large menu but there is a bit of seafood or steak if that is your desire. The burgers are big and you can replace your fries with a nice chopped salad. The drinks are priced well below places like Applebee's or Chili's so enjoy one with your meal.

Charlie's offers great drinks... at reasonable prices... and has extremely friendly bartenders... and they are happy to serve you (even if you're not gambling).

Charlie's has a moderately priced dinner menu... typically with potato or rice (unless you will get your carb order from a pasta dish)... vegetable... includes soup or salad... the best waitresses around (they've been with them for many years) dinners are made to order...

4176740,2017-04-29,0,94BEy7wGKmrOC7sjSHMisw,"I am local and this is only a block away.

I should have rated this a 4 due to one negative.  It has nothing to do with food quality or service.  It is due to the fact the dinning area is open to the bar and there is a smell of cigarette smoke in the eating area.  For some that will not be a concern or deterrent.  

Their service, quality, and quantity added the additional star.

Aside from that the food is great.  At least breakfasts.  I am partial to steak & eggs.  As is a friend of mine.  We try to meet up on a weekly basis.  We have dined here several time this past month. (April 2017)

Update 12/2017 I have been coming here weekly since April.

They have a Steak and Egg special that comes in right at $10. ($9.99 to be exact). It comes with a large side of potatoes of choice, and toast of choice.  Their steak is not the run of the mill lower quality you might expect from a normal breakfast house.  Many times it ranks up there with a steak house quality serving of meat. Regardless, great value for the $. 

Coffee is extra of course but priced at the bottom of the scale for what we pay at comparable places ($2.00).  

Service is prompt, courteous, and attentive (Server: Wendy).   She knows what I always order.  I feel like I am getting small town friendly service.  Weekday Breakfast (8am) is rarely busy and rather quiet which makes it very attractive as a place to meet for breakfast and conversation.  I am not sure why they aren't packed.  In a way I hope this review doesn't lead to that.    

No charge for parking in an ample sized parking lot.  This is one of the ""best quality for your $"" that you can find in the area.",yLpkTs6giYbA0rCP9pDiYQ,4,0,5,H702mHoM1YmlYSLX4NRTLA

It's an ok place as a last resort if all places don't fit your style. I came here with my wife and we wanted to eat out and relax, it took the waitress 10 minutes to sit us, because she was assisting another customer which by standards is literally fine I love seeing that. What upset me was when we were seated it took another 10 minutes to get anything to drink, so when we ordered our drinks we were ready to order.

When we told her we were ready she stated she would be back to take our order.... 5 minutes later she returned and took our order. About 45 minutes to an hour is when we saw our food and it alright, but allot of things could of been better. Not bashing the company, but literally only maybe 5 or, so people were in the building and out of the 5 were 3 customers and the rest were staff. 

Everyone's allowed to have an off day, but common that's the purpose of an individual having a day off to kick back relax and enjoy themselves while out, but to come here was more of annoyance than all else.",Fr9OjCKLIKrV9zXoyrbSHg,1,0,3,xk7lGf3kgRN-RwEzlk_PrA

I have an app on my iPhone that sends me an alert every time a charge is posted to my credit card. I gave the waitress my Amex to pay for the meal and got the alert prior to her bringing me the receipt to sign. My phone alert showed that I was paying an automatic tip (before I even entered a tip amount and before I signed the receipt). They don't even show the tip amount that they are charging you on the credit card receipt, they leave this blank for you to fill in an amount for the tip. When I brought this to the waitress' attention she said it is a bit embarrassing the boss does this but I don't have to leave that large of a tip if I do not wish to (she said the system automatically charges a tip amount and closes out the transaction before the customer has a chance to sign off on the receipt). She said if I disagree with the tip amount then I can get the tip credited back to my card but I would have to call the owner. What a friggin scam!!!!!!!!!!!

5967464,2017-09-22,12,94BEy7wGKmrOC7sjSHMisw,"This review is based on their handling of a private event. I attended a dinner seminar here and the server was very nice but service wise, she failed tremendously. We had a big group that started to gather around 530 because the dinner was supposed to start at 6. She took a handful of people's orders, mine included, and before most of the group even showed those who ordered had their soup/salad already. It made it awkward while people were starting to arrive and we're there eating. Next she started to take orders from people, but it was scattered because not everyone who was sitting got to order, not even a drink. Once the presentation started our entrees arrived before other people could put their order in. Again, awkward. Before the presentation ended at least 45 mins later, than the rest (most) of the attendees got to order their food. One of my colleagues were missed completely and still ended up not getting his order because they forgot him AGAIN. I don't know about this place. The server should have alerted the manager if she couldn't handle it and the manager should have made an appearance midway to make sure all was good. Or at least peak in to make sure all was going well.

Food wise, it was ok. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes. The side house salad was presented very well.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,17,15,2,E76u-tO4CQ_mDZQOm6OChw
