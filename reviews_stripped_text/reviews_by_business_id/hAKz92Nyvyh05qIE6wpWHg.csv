So i mixed it around a little to see if that would help and it didn't at all. I wasted money on that drink cause I had to throw it away due to it being so bad and nasty.

PROs: Beyond Meat was hearty and just the right texture.  Sauce was spicy with a kick to it.  Crunchy with the romaine & wontons.  Liked the julienned veggies as well.  
~~ 5 stars for the partnership

CONs:  Really really salty - 1400 mg of sodium without the Beyond Meat.  Add 360 mg for Beyond Meat.  That's SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT of the RDA for sodium.  All in one little sandwich.  Obviously this is an place I'll go to only if there is no other option for food (like in the middle of nowhere).  A bit small for the price, but hey, I'm eating mainstream (albeit salty) food!

Second, he didn't know the wifi password. 

Third, he skipped my order and made the smoothies of 4 other customers that came and called in their orders AFTER me.

There are one or two people on staff working. I feel that if there are popular hours then they need to be scheduled correctly to have a larger staff. I am waiting for 20 minutes to get my smoothie.

This place is always busy and I know why. First, super friendly staff and great smoothies. They could stand to be more efficient making the waits less, but it was worth it all in the end.

I got the Peanut Paradise with peanut butter, banana, non-fat yogurt and whey protein. It was a BIG drink. Almost too big. I was headed to yoga and just wanted a little something to put in my stomach, but I couldn't drink all this without getting sick, I'm sure. So, it's a good sized smoothie for the price. 

I have other things here that were just as good in terms of smoothies. I have to say the food looks a little unhealthy (not sure if is or isn't, just looks that way), but looking at it I'd have to stay away.

The Pen: I stood at the register for a while before I was noticed, no biggie. Orders a smoothie and a wrap. I pay with a card and go to sign. No pen. I ask for one, the girl laughs and says I don't have one. She yells to a young man in the back (who looks like he's been sweating over a hot stove for 8 hours, dirty and dripping in sweat - I'm thinking - please don't be the one making my food) and he laughs and says no clue where the pen is. They both stare at me, so I dig through my purse looking for one, no luck, so the girl shrugs and says oh well, and stuffs my receipt in a jar. Wait...WHAT?!? 

The Chicken: The man then yells to the girl up front to stop selling chicken because he's trying to prep it. My sandwich was supposed to have chicken, so she calls my order and JUST FOR FUN I unwrap it before I leave - no chicken. I ask her if it's supposed to have chicken, her eyes get wide and she's just like...oh...he forgot it...then proceeds to go in the back and whisper a (she noticed) as he glares at me and laughs, before reluctantly remaking my sandwich. He clearly thought I would leave and by the time I noticed, I wouldn't bother to come back. Good effort, but next time don't yell at your coworker to stop selling chicken in front of someone who just ordered it. 

The Store: As I wait for sandwich number 2, I actually look around and realize how disgustingly dirty this place is, garbage on the floors, dirt all up the windows. The floor around the register is horrific. At this point I realize I've made a horrible mistake, and I just want to get the hell out. I take my food (again I check my order) with not so much an apology, just a matter of ""that was embarrassing"" and leave. And thus concludes my story of my first and LAST experience here. The bummer is that the food & smoothie was great.

Morale of the Story: Due to the crazy number of horrible reviews about this place, it's obvious management doesn't care and things won't change anytime soon (although I do feel better now). Jamba Juice folks.",Jwt8vq-3_DFAFcGq-dOLgQ,0,0,1,XjYkzhEY4rvQn1m6uRrFQA

The store manager here needs to be fired.  Came in today at 2 pm and one poor girl was working the whole store.  It took me 30 minutes to get one smoothie.  I had to change what I wanted because the girl basically pleaded with me not to order the Blimey Limey.  Apparently, she would have to stop everything and juice the limes.  I obliged.

Here is the biggest issue.  The girl was handling money without gloves on, then she was making food.  She did this over and over without washing her hands once.  In addition, juice and fruit were left out.  This place would be shut down if a health inspector showed up.

Welp, I am done with this company for a long while.  I might reconsider after a year or so of improved reviews.

If I'm waiting to order I get no acknowledgement that they'll be right with me. When they finally come on the counter, I go out of my way to ask them how they are, because working in customer service I know how far that goes, and I just get a ""good"". No ""how are you back"" or not even a ""what can I get for you"" they just stare at the register waiting. How am I supposed to know you're ready for me? I recommend to management that they train the employees better customer service because you won't receive repeat customers.

I make 4-6 salads every week. Do not be fooled by this. The lettuce is the quality of iceberg lettuce. Totally deceiving with about 4 big pieces of Spring Mix on top with a shredded iceberg underneath. I was disappointed and couldn't bother finishing it. 

After I took out most of the lettuce from the taco it wasn't bad. I highly recommend to just stick with smoothies or check your order before leaving.

First off I've had quite a few smoothies from TCS and although I like most of them I tend to stay away from anything that has pineapple in the name because I think it just makes the smoothie taste weird. My favorite smoothie from here is the one that is mainly blueberries (I forget the name). 

The food was pretty decent. I have had the Pesto Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken wrap. Is it great? No, not really. But is it okay for the price, plus getting a smoothie to go with it? Yes.

My galpal, Candy and I were set to do some research on good picnic grounds in the Las Vegas area for my birthday (which is tomorrow, but we plan to go on a picnic next week) so all we needed was a strong wi-fi network (and she assured me that Tropical Smoothis was 'student friendly') and some good ol' brain food. After a quick examination of the menu, we both settled for a couple of flatbreads - Honey Ham & Swiss for her and Chicken Pesto for me. For $3.99 (that's $4.13 with tax), we were filled up pretty well. Top that with a chocolate chip cookie (roughly 0$0.60 each) and we had our cherry top for the night. 

We had a good time chit-chatting if only it weren't for the cackling blender in the background that grumbled abruptly every now and then, it had us jump a little every time.

Service: Usually just teenagers working at the shop, but they're all pretty friendly and helpful. I usually have my drink out in 5minutes or so.

5176326,2014-04-21,0,hAKz92Nyvyh05qIE6wpWHg,"I am a regular at a number of Tropical Smoothie locations-- I absolutely LOVE the Thai chicken wrap with Gardein faux meat. One recent evening, I stopped into this T.S. and ordered just that. The boy with the glasses and large gauged ears took my order. His tag was not visible and he did not give me a receipt, though, so I do not know this name. Upon repeating my order back to me, everything was correct. Once the order was complete, as I took my bag, I asked, 'With the Gardein chicken, yes?' To which he said, 'Yes'.

When I got home, I unwrapped my wrap and had a feeling that I should take a look before biting into it. Indeed, my wrap was made with real chicken, NOT Gardein.

I quickly drove back to Tropical Smoothie and confronted this staff member about the error. When I asked, ""Why did you make my wrap with real chicken, even though I emphasized Gardein before preparation AND asked you when you handed me the wrap whether it was Gardein or not?""

His reply: ""It must have slipped my mind"".

Completely unacceptable and absolutely disgusting. Had I not been familiar with what Gardein looks like, I likely would have eaten an entire wrap with regular chicken.

They tend to get pretty busy at lunch time, when I usually frequent this place, but they are efficient and always seem to get each customer in and out as quickly as possible. Customer service is pretty friendly as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,2,4,7aL62tqD_kWnJzYfQsex3Q

I went in at 12, ordered a wrap and a smoothie. It took them almost 1 hour to complete my order. I got the smoothie with in 10 minuets, and then waiting for about 45 minutes for the wrap. Being on my HR long lunch break, this pit me in a crunch to get back to work on time. 
The girl making the smoothies had a poor attitude and seemed annoyed with the customers that continued to come in. 
The gentleman that came to take my order ( only after the front girl snapped at him that there was a line) was abrasive and I could tell he was rushing through. 
Finally an other young woman came to give my my food order once it was done, and she was the first smile that I saw with in the store. She was cheerful and did apologize for having there be such a long wait. 
My suggestion would be to move the young girl that was making the food today to the front as cashier. She was the only one with in the store that was personable. I wish I would have gotten her name.",KsKBP9y-MHFFIpmJP58MTA,1,0,1,yhg8PCzoYzy4efRIvjjyMQ
