So I've hated on this place in the past, yet today, due to already having had breakfast at a Sierra Gold and spending like 4 hours there then coming here afterwards, I felt like a loser with no life going back to the same bar, so I went to a different bar so they wouldn't know how little of a life a I actually have. Alyssa was attentive from the start, greeting everyone as they walked in the door with a ""welcome"" and a gorgeous smile. She was attentive throughout my stay there, was witty with her back and forth banter, and gave her recommendations for food choices when I asked with appropriate requests and ridiculous demands on my part. In essence, she's the kind of bartender that turns a guy who comes on occasion into a regular. PTEG, as I've stated already, give a raise, promote, or sculpt this woman into your management circle, because she fucking gets it. This place earns my business again after destroying Beano's.",mjbTKcJyynlmqOH-EuBY4Q,0,0,5,YMTgMYbIxF--rYuenNJ74Q

However, they charged me the full price for the pizza and just gave me a coupon for ""buy one get one free"" appetizer. It was a pretty pathetic response.

If the policy is one tab it should've been stated prior to us drinking otherwise we should've been asked.

4942365,2018-03-01,0,1WsXLCPRP2EZ9KoBRTkSbw,"Yesterday I took 4 of my employees here for pizza , wings and a couple beers for the ones who drink.  The waitress was nice to us however I will not be revisiting this place.  We ordered a bucket of wings, a large pizza and a basket of fries.  The wings were split up in 3 flavors.  One of the flavors a guy picked was garlic Parmesan.  They were terrible.  All 5 of us tried it and all agreed they were gross.  When we brought it up the waitress told us well you'll know for next time.  Then we needed 4 more ranch.  The lady went and got them for us.  I get the bill and was charged $0.75 per ranch.  It's ridiculous to me that I spent $111 on food and $20 on 3 beers and had to pay extra for 4 ranch.  Again the waitress was nice but I believe this place is caught up by the corporate garbage.  I will not be back and do not recommend a place that feels the need to not offer a different option when 5 people tell them a certain part of the order was terrible or makes you pay for extra dipping sauce as if they didn't already make enough profit.",mElD1Xavxf2L28AD3HsHzg,1,0,2,yP_2hs_7wtdWTodn7-X4jQ
5211868,2017-02-15,0,1WsXLCPRP2EZ9KoBRTkSbw,"Was VERY disappointed with the service tonight. My wife and I eat at different PT's Pubs all over Las Vegas all the time. For bar food, they are pretty good and they make a good hefeweizen. It was Valentines Day and every normal sit-down restaurant was jam packed with people. We didn't need anything fancy but we were hungry so we went into PT's. It was a little busy but not like a weekend or if there was any major sports game on so we took a seat outside. Our waitress came over (I wish I would have gotten her name) and she didn't even smile. She looked like she was having a really bad night, and we were going to get the punishment for that. We placed a drink order...two beers and waters, while we looked over the menus. Water came out after a few minutes, followed by the beers. The beers had no lemon or oranges in them, very odd for a hefeweizen to be served. We decided to place our order. Pot Stickers as appetizers first. My wife wasn't super hungry so she just ordered chicken fingers and tater tots. I ordered the Ramen soup bowl. Off she went.

I kid you not, 15 minutes go by and we never once saw her again. She then walks out with our pot stickers. They were barely warm...obviously had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Overall, they were OK but not great, mostly due to them not being very hot. We didn't even have two bites of those and then our entrees came out. Obviously she didn't stagger the order so everything was coming out at once. I so absolutely hate it when servers screw this up. 

She drops off the food and before you can blink your eyes...she was gone. No salt and pepper on the table and no soy sauce for my dish. We had to walk up to the bar and get salt and pepper, which is good, because if we waited for our server to come back we never would have gotten them. She never once came to check on us ever. My soup was extremely bland with a really weird sweet taste to it. I ate half of it and that was it. My wife thought the chicken and tots were just meh...like we ordered it at Sonic. 

It wasn't until another 10-15 minutes until we saw our server again. I asked for the check...7 minutes go by and she comes back. As soon as she hands it to me she tried to run away so I called her back because I didn't want to be there another hour or two waiting for her. I gave her my CC and she was gone. 5 minutes go by and she walks by with some food for another table and tells me she'll be back, which she was in about another 5 minutes. 

The few times we saw her, she started to get a bit more polite but overall the experience was not a good one. For close to $60 for dinner (including the tip which I regret leaving), it was absolutely not worth it for some mediocre bar food and terrible service.",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,0,0,2,FEj7nhddedu5akoJEaxCeg
