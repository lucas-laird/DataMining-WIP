We came here, six of us, including two Korean sisters, who declared the food better than the best of K-town in New York City. Though I'm not Korean, I agree. Possibly the best jap chae I've ever had, divine banchan, and delicious, homemade-tasting everything else. This sleeper is a gem.",R03v0NfmWU5qeMglJ_pjgA,1,0,5,4TJq5Ru4d6QSGeJdTmxnBQ

All of the dishes we ordered were so good and did not disappoint. The Clam soup was refreshing, their Soybean Paste soup was amazing, the Seafood Noodle (jjamppong) was refreshing and tasty. This is a smaller, quaint place and the owner is very nice and attentive. You should definitely check this place out!",ChUsgyEMgJ1hO3YbYcaW1A,1,0,5,4YkWoco2tMHhQR9ZxztW8w
5814843,2015-04-28,0,-AGdGGCeTS-njB_8GkUmjQ,"This is truly the best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas....I should know since I'm Korean-American and I've lived in NYC, NJ and eaten in LA, home of the best Korean food in the US.  I will definitely seek Woo Chun out again when I return to Las Vegas. The owners, a couple, are so nice, friendly yet modest. The food tastes homemade, as if my momma made it for me. The seafood pajun is crunchy on the outside and stuffed with tasty seafood. The bibimbap is delicious with large slices of beef, not ground beef. The bantam (free appetizers) are also so tasty.  Definitely check it out...you won't be disappointed.",YZ-37H--tcMNMYMhupJ1DQ,0,0,5,jajVBAXjdQeYgXaQ5y5s-A
