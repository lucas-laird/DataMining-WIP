585197,2015-06-08,1,EiO5lrozazxIaqOnUvzCag,Trust the other reviews and stay away from this place.  Ordered two sandwiches and a medium two topping pizza.  The pizza was just alright... had frozen that tasted better.  The sandwiches were literally raw and doughy.  We called them and have two sandwiches coming to us but we will never use them.  Nothing like taking a bite of nothing but raw dough.,T3_Maz72KRLYWY9a1qWYQg,0,0,1,0Gi5czwuRXg-n201NrYOuw

Very poor training or systems. It is time to give up on Dominos and move on. Orders incomplete about 75% of time.,X9R4F7g2uzvmvZY8bwwQoQ,1,0,1,Crry--oGGqMllRI2rnA2Wg
764581,2016-11-26,0,EiO5lrozazxIaqOnUvzCag,This place has terrible customer service with no empathy towards their guests what so ever! The lady on the phone answered and mention they were not doing carry out anymore but it is 12am on a Friday night. They close at 1am! Did not give a reason nor an apology! Her response was just that she only has one driver and they are not doing carry out! I was only asking for one pizza! For PICK UP! No common sense and poor management to not be able to handle these kind of situations properly and having a set staff! Never ordering at this location again!,w_4inIDABoMyCxZDUkUgww,0,0,1,8peTu2uActIXUr5Z9irQAw
853358,2016-12-15,0,EiO5lrozazxIaqOnUvzCag,This place seems to have the worst customer service all the time. Today we walked in and we greeted the employees and all they did was stare at us so awkwardly if anything it should be them greeting us. One of them was a chubby guy who had earphones on the whole time listening to music! First off that should be a health hazard and not allowed by management. Secondly my pizza was made by a guy with blonde hair and the tomato sauce was dry as well for the toppings there wasn't even any. Lastly it seems as if management should be SUPERVISING the team more often so things like this don't occur. I didn't seem to have seen a manager to be acting professional towards their customers in this facility! This is just horrible,ClTYJcrwUY8VKDs1rGv_pw,0,0,1,Cthk8Tc4sX3spQ2DOrbXJg

I was in and out in less than 20 minutes; if that. I loved the fact that the wings weren't dry and I can actually substitute the crust for any size pizza. I was shocked that I was able to get my medium pizza with thin crust; an option rarely offered by competitors.

I called this store to order something quick.. the kid that answered was so dry and unwelcoming (despite the fact this store did not deliver to my location), his attitude made my not even want to spend my money there. I immediately called back, asking to speak with the manager, and no named employee quickly reminded me they do not delivered to my location, I repeated myself and asked to speak to the manager. 

A very polite Melissa picked up the line, i let her know of the situation and did not appreciate the employees attitude both times when i called. She said she was covering from another store and did not know the kid's name, but she would be sure to have a talk with him.

She did not check the food and when I checked I saw the the cheesy bread is burnt, but I would rather just throw it away and never walk back into that Dominos again. 

I sent this complaint to Dominos through there website, then recieved a call from the women who I complained about an hour later. Due to this incident I now know it is Dominos policy to have there employees call you to yell at you after you complain, I will not go back to ANY Dominos Pizza.",H6U6H_JN0REqaHz4SRSglA,3,0,1,mlnl7uRqfN77zTlmTXXmog

We submitted it online, duh. A driver finally called and said he was by our pool. Our pool area is locked. He couldn't describe our clubhouse. I repeated my address multiple times on each call. He asked if we spoke Spanish. I could barely understand him. I even drove to my clubhouse to find him. There wasn't anyone there. So evidently he went back to the store again after telling me he'd be here in 5 minutes. The store is only about 2 miles away. The last time we called we asked for a manager and the kid said he said he could do the same as a manager. Then we were put on hold for 10 minutes.

2548911,2014-06-15,1,EiO5lrozazxIaqOnUvzCag,"This location used to be really good.  About two years ago, it became inconsistent.  And now it's consistently not so good.

You can expect 1 piece of topping on each slice.  This was considered a major offense when I worked for the company 10 years ago.  Now it appears to be the standard.  

I used to have a problem with not having cheese on the pizza, but I complained.  Now every pizza I get is really JUST a cheese pizza.  The toppings have become more of a garnish.

It's a shame that you can't get a delicious pizza to the same standards that corporate used to hold.  I'd order twice a month (rather than twice a year) if the product was still as good.",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,2,1,2,DH5r4RuetxEcD_WuNKYwBw

2765885,2017-01-27,0,EiO5lrozazxIaqOnUvzCag,"January 21 7:10 PM I ordered a pizza for carry out from dominoes at 4150 Boulder Highway, Las Vegas. I arrived at 7:20 PM and the display showed that my order was ready. As I was walking up to the counter to pay they were handing a pizza to someone who had been in the store waiting. He left, I paid for my order and then they could not find my pizza. Just one or two minutes later the previous customer returned with a pizza, the box open, flaps up, the pizza sticking out. That pizza had only had pepperoni and sausage which was what I had ordered. One slice had been torn out and thrown back in the box. They also couldn't find his pizza but they believe they sent it on a delivery. They slid that pizza into the box with my order sticker on it and they handed it to me. My food order was given to another customer who left the building with it, who opened box AND HANDLED THE FOOD, and then returned it to the store. The female delivery driver who took my payment handed that to me and said that my pizza was ready. Even if it didn't appear that the customer handled the food, you already know you cannot present food received by another customer to another customer as their meal. You know that. You are breaking all ethics of food handling practices and you are committing health code violations of any county in the United States . Even so, your store manager and your store employees believed there was nothing wrong with that. If that's the way the store does business they should be shut down immediately.",-vTIOBkGfZ6JdP0RROs6Fw,0,0,1,HgEmAxbYZzz9a-zW2kDFKQ

Then they deliver the wrong sandwich. I call, and can barely here the person I was talking to. He kept having me repeat myself, and was rude. I won't have them ever deliver anymore. It takes too long.  They need to hire more drivers or have a change in management.  It's not rocket science, it's delivery.  They've cheated me out of extra mushrooms twice before. Watch for those extra toppings you don't get. Better yet, order elsewhere, as I plan on doing!!!

Well, the second sandwich Never showed up!!  Really, WTF Dominos... is this how you treat your customers??

I called and spoke with the manager.  Third sandwich on the way with a soda ( a soda for my inconvenience, not Their inability to do Their job!! ) 

It came. It was hot. It looked like it was just thrown together without care. I added my own cheese since they didn't put any on. Yeah, I'd stay clear of them.",BWpsQHK9ldt_j6bvacHIpA,2,0,1,U3mhpacxd5hL-uY-JzbhXA

It's not a huge deal, I have a pizza cutter, but it's a pizza place... that to me just proves their attention to detail is majorly lacking.
