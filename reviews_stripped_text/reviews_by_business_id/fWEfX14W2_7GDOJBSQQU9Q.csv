This was one of the few restaurants open at 8 am so we decided to try it out. Unfortunately we weren't able to get sushi since they don't serve it until 11am. We were still glad they had a breakfast menu which included American and Japanese breakfast as well as handful of noodle bowl options.  

I had the Japanese breakfast and my girlfriend got the deep fried sweet tofu upon bowl. The miso soup was excellent and my breakfast was mostly really tasty. It had small portions of grilled salmon, rice, oranges, cantaloupe, soy beans, seaweed salad, and a regular salad with a light ginger dressing. Everything was delicious sans the fermented soybeans, but I'll attribute that to my own personal taste. It was also served with green tea which was great. 

The udon bowl was pretty typical, nothing fancy and the broth and noodles were good. The deep fried sweet tofu was kind of  different, but still kind of tasty.  
Just as note, their actual restaurant is still under construction and has been for 14 months. The server there mentioned that construction has stopped currently and the don't know when it'll be done.

  Staying at the Flamingo, I remebered seeing this Japanese joint right next door in Bally's (located in the back where the sportsbook/pool/monorail is).

  They have a great Bento lunch set (3 types) all around $9-12 which is a cheap lunch for Vegas that isn't McDonalds/Quiznos. Their beer prices aren't too bad compared to most restaurants in the area (around $4, compared to the $6 in other places). We had a big group so we ordered almost 1 of everything on the menu, so I got to try out a lot of what they had to offer.  The sushi, chicken teriyaki, soba, udon, tempura, and salad were not the best i've had. However, they were still of good quality, came out quick, our service was friendly, and the food was delicious...and yes we were all sober at that time...so we could make good judgement.  By the way their fried Squid which came out looking like Katsu was delicious too.  
  If you're around the area (considering I wouldn't go too out of my way to get here if I was somewhere like Mandalay or Treasure Island), and like us just not craving the typical burger fries/pizza...this excellently priced delicious Japanese food is definitely worth a stop.

My husband and I went here as our first dinner as a married couple after getting hitched @ the Vegas sign.  Before even knowing this our sweet and adorable waitress presented us with two shots of chilled sake which was absolutely delicious.  I had never had sake before, and I LOVE it! 

We ordered four different rolls (I honestly don't remember which ones now) and they were all absolutely fresh and delicious.  We sat at the bar and were able to watch them being made for us.  

My husband thanked the waitress for her kindness and informed her that we had just gotten married, so we really appreciated the hospitality and she disappeared really quick and came back with some shots of flavored sake which were even better! 

We were all done eating and requested our check, and it turned out the guy sitting down at the end of the bar from us had PAID for our meal!!! 

After finding this out, and my husband and I almost cried at all the kindness in such a strange new place (this was our first visit to vegas - i had dreams of being married in Vegas by Elvis since i was a little girl) our waitress came out of the back room with a sundae for us!

The signs and menus all had both English and Japanese.  That's usually a good sign, it means they expect to serve people from Japan who know what how Japanese food should taste.  It also usually means the staff speaks Japanese, so I can get in a bit of practice ordering in Japanese.

I decided to go with a ""bento"" box lunch special.  I like ""bento"", because it is the traditional Japanese lunch, and I get to try little tastes of different things.  In this case, the bento came with miso soup, rice, salad, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and chicken terriyaki.  All were very good.  I was impressed by the quality of the chicken meat, and how light the terriyaki sause was (instead of the usual heavy, sticky, syrupy terriyaki).  I topped it off with a cold Sapporo beer.  A very satisfying lunch.

The staff was also very nice, greeting us with the traditional ""Irrashai!"".  My wife is not very experienced with chopsticks, and the waitress provided her a set of ""chopstick helpers"" to make it easier for her to eat.  She tolerated my ordering in Japanese without any problems.  And she quickly provided my wife with an extra helping of terriyaki sauce when asked.

I only had a few minor complaints.  Our waitress was occassionally busy doing other tasks and sometimes took a while to check on us.  And the menu was a bit more limited than some places.

Neutral: tempura is entirely ordinary. Quality of the sashimi isn't bad.

Awful: the spicy yellowtail roll was so bad I can't even remember what it tastes like anymore. I think I was just eating it because I realized I'd already paid for it, and didn't want it to go to waste.

The main point I wanted to drop about Ichiban is that they have a phenomenal server named Pen. She is one of the sweetest, most genuinely kind people I've ever seen in this role. 

Friendly right from the get go. She kept coming back, answering questions, checking on things for us. She brought us a sample of a unique type of potato we had never heard of, cut fresh by the chef just because we seemed curious. I learned a few things that day, about huge rice balls and the fact that I do not like that potato.. 

Anyway, the food was solid. We had just rolled into town and needed food ""stat"" as the doctor would say. I would have said 3 stars because the meal did what it was supposed to; filled us up and didn't cost an arm and a leg, but Pen's service jumped it up another one just by being great.

I was in Vegas with 2 Japanese grandmas who were desperately in need of miso soup and rice. Now normally when in Vegas, I would get my Japanese (or any other Asian for that matter) fix on Spring Mountain Road, but since we were car-less, I figured we'd better stay close by. 

Ichiban Sushi is located inside of Bally's, but waaay on the other side of the entrance, near the monorail station. The employees are actually Japanese and I would say the food is more authentic than what you would get at Sushi Roku or Sushi Samba (or many other hotel Japanese restaurants). They have everything from sushi to udon/soba noodles and your typical teriyaki combinations. For us the food was just meh though and overpriced on top of that. I mean really, cucumber salad for $5?? Fried tofu for $7??

It is located downstairs next to the sports book, tucked away in the back of the casino.  On game day, this place gets very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet place to eat, make sure it is not March Madness or the Super Bowl.

The place is fairly small with counter service for about 12 and about 10 tables.  They could probably put together a group of 8 or so, but I would not recommend attempting this.

The place usually has one or two Japanese speakers if in case that is some sort of necessity here.

It is a bit pricey for the quality of food.  $15 or so for most dinners such as pike mackeral or pork cutlet.  If you want to go cheap, you can get the bowls or eat here for lunch specials.  I have never bothered with their sushi or tempura.  I don't recommend you do so unless you aren't very picky.

Anyhoo, at least they ask whether or not you want your miso soup before the meal or with it.  In case such things are important for you to know, miso soup is supposed to be served with the meal.  Personally, I don't care one way or the other, but it is a good check point for if you are an authenticity nut.

This place is exactly on par with the old Sushi King at the Stardust.  Serviceable when you need Japanese food and some green tea.

Our server was friendly and more than willing to make suggestions and accommodate special orders. She recommended the Dragon Roll, since I mentioned we were a fan of eel, and it was a great suggestion! Very fresh and well balanced. We also go the spicy yellowtail with avocado, which is one of my favourite rolls. The yellowtail isn't just sitting around in the spicy sauce, the sushi chef makes it fresh when you order it, and it shows. Ample amounts of fish with the perfect amount of avocado, with a decent kick. I think this was my favourite dish. We also got the jalapeno poppers. Beware, these guys will leave their mark! Deep fried jalapenos (seeds still present) stuffed with spicy tuna, drizzled with eel sauce. Holy runny nose, Batman! We actually had to order a side of white rice to help with the heat, and both of us can handle hot foods. These were sooooo spicy, but sooooo good!

It is NOT a casino-owned restaurant, so you won't get comped - but you won't be paying prices inflated by comping, either. It isn't huge, so don't bring a huge gang of people, but a medium-size party could fit fine. There's sushi bar seating and tables. 

I've been here twice now. Each time, the place was largely full of actual Japanese people, either locals or tourists. Last time, one of the principal dancers from Bally's big show was there with some friends, and obviously liked the place (especially since she could surely get comped elsewhere). 

The food is average to good - and that's by my snobby San Francisco Japantown standards. I've had better Japanese in Vegas, for three times the price, but nothing in this range - which is why it gets four stars. Certainly way better than Todai or any of the buffet sushi!

I would compare the quality of the food to that of a good Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area, for those of you familiar, but with slightly higher prices (combination dinner + a roll is about $30) since it is, after all, on The Strip.

What I usually get:
- Combination lunch/dinner. Salad comes with miso dressing. Tempura is fried just right. Teriyaki chicken is crispy, not drenched in sauce. Portions are slightly smaller than what you'd expect, but everything is done well. If you order to-go they include the miso soup.
- A roll. Standard sized, a couple of dollars more than average ($13 - $17 instead of $10 - $13).

It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT. Go elsewhere if you're in the mood for sushi. The only good thing here is the service. The waitress was very friendly to my friend. She was treated like she was the daughter or relative.",pgTz-Ds6WvS8qFOsRekG9A,2,0,2,7j84Xlz050XrCl1SIo6aMQ

That location is clearly a 1-Star environment, but we did not mind too much and enjoyed that we did not have to wait to be seated at 8 pm. Food is 4 star: we had rainbow rolls and nigiris. The salmon nigiri was 5 stars, however, the rest was 4 when comparing to our favorite Seafood-Restaurant at home.

Prices are okay, probably Las Vegas standard. Rainbow roll was $16.

I was browsing at a magazine in the Hooter's Hotel on the July 2010 issue of ""The Complete Guide to go Where: Las Vegas,"" (wheretraveler.com). As i was browsing this small description under the ""The Guide: Dining"" on ICHIBAN SUSHI  in BALLY'S stated: A rotating sushi bar presents selections that gently glide by your chopsticks. WRONG; FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!

My friends and I went into this sushi bar thinking there was going to be an actual rotating sushi bar. We thought wrong. The restaurant was a little small, no doubt there used to be a rotating sushi bar. I honestly thought it was hidden somewhere. I asked the waitress what happened to the ""rotating sushi bar"" and she said that ""WE USED TO HAVE IT BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST OPEN."" Now, how long ago was that? She claimed that it was ""HARD TO MAINTAIN."" Explain why it was on the most recent July '10 issue? This seriously was a bummer, we expected one thing and got another.

This regularly priced sushi joint wasn't bad, it was actually okay. I ordered Spicy Yellowtail and Spicy Mini Scallop cut roll. It was pretty good, i enjoyed the sriracha (rooster sauce) in the little mix with the raw fish. Oh man that was tasty. We also ordered Shrimp Tempura with Udon Noodles. This dish took quite some time to serve. The shrimp tempura was small, I've seen a larger tempura at ""Mako in Los Feliz, CA."" Overall, my experience was okay, this place is marginal. There are better sushi joints out there were you can get the full experience of a rotating sushi bar.",sZM9Op2hDETZ8DyepRttIg,0,0,3,yESlKQGrIMg91w60AOo6hQ

I thought ichiban meant number 1. They remind you at the door. As a complimentary service they have an illiterate lady from hong kong constantly translating ichiban. 

If you didn't know that the country of japan is the origin of any type of cuisine, this place is for you. In fact, if you have no idea what Japanese food is then your ignorance will be bliss.

Subpar food, service is poor. May be an illegal front for Chinese immigrant racket. Bottom line: if you were thinking sbarros, do sbarros.",03hwMftkJlKXXddamrdIkQ,2,2,2,Tq_fSvaeEQJbloV3FeijQA
5233387,2011-04-18,0,fWEfX14W2_7GDOJBSQQU9Q,"Ichiban Sushi is a comfortable casual place in the rear of Bally's on the way to the monorail station. I found this place 5 years ago while attending a trade show. I decided to try Ichiban as I noticed that most of the patrons visiting that week were Japanese nationals away from home wanting Japanese cooking. I have dinner here at least twice for my once a year visit while I'm in Vegas for the week. Ichiban is perfect after spending a whole day on the convention floor. The atmosphere is lively but tame enough  to have a conversation should you wish to have friends join you for dinner. 

I found that I liked Ichiban because of the variety of ala-carte items, and many items that you won't find in the high priced/high end sushi places that are plentyful in Las Vegas. The appetizer list is long so you won't run out of items to try. I rate the sushi as good, but not in the high end of excellent. Don't get me wrong, the sushi is still very tasty, fresh, and delicious. 

I ordered everything ala-carte, starting with sake and a beer chaser. Meanwhile an order of sushi consisting of, mackerel, tuna, unagi, and halibut await. The sushi order took longer than expected, so don't be in a hurry if you order sushi. There are two chefs handling all of the sushi orders. As an appetizer I ordered nato tofu or hiyayako tofu. On one night I had chicken udon and the next night I had broiled black cod and some pickled vegetables. Both items came with miso soup which was excellent. The oyako domburi is also good dish to order. All dinners finished with green tea. 

I feel that many of the dishes served can be described as Japanese comfort food; overall a delicious and satisfying experience. Both waitresses Pen and Midori were very attentive, personable, and took care of my dining needs. Ichiban is open on some nights until 11:00PM which is great since I like to eat late after 9:00 PM.",JOCxl84RmO3ED7tfQ3lHLg,2,0,4,x6ARmGdpEUwQxGbk1HnkYg

My boyfriend had two sushi rolls - spicy tuna and spicy yellow tail. Both were priced around $8. I am not a huge fan of the raw fish sushi, but the yellow tail was INCREDIBLE! Very fresh and flavorful without that ""fish"" flavor. I highly recommend Ichiban if you are in Vegas and craving Japanese/sushi! :)",NpZ6hMBncbIvAo4btwrvZQ,2,1,4,CCz1znJR6_k_pQx1iPjeKw

Its runs me about $50 which includes tip for myself when i go eat sushi here.

I have to say that the service is very good. They're really friendly here and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. It's a pretty small place but clean and comfortable with the fun lobster tank outside.

We basically came here because it was close by to the hotel and it was relatively cheap. There is certainly much better sushi to be had in Vegas and there is certainly much better AND more expensive sushi to be had. We wanted to keep things easy and cheap. 

They have a good selection and all the usual suspects are present. Didn't see any particularly unusual or creative things on the menu but you've got your spicy tuna, salmon skin, rainbow rolls and all the rest. The fish was pretty fresh and it was presently nicely but it just lacked a ""Wow this is so delicious"" factor. Salmon skin was a little fishy and the spicy tuna a little chewy and not as spicy as I would like. 

I do think it's an OK value if you are lazy and cheap and in the area but I wouldn't make any specific plans on coming here as it wasn't that good. Next time I would probably make the effort to go somewhere with better quality food for similar prices (even if it means not being so lazy and actually getting into a cab).",Ta3V5b98z48RaV3fmmlqrQ,0,0,3,xyBD3kGW94-I6QCGpUYA1Q

The reason I keep coming back even though I never stay at Bally's is because it's decent food and the other strip sushi place, Hamada Sushi of Japan, doesn't sell sushi during the daytime for some reason. 

I usually order their assorted lunch sushi special, which is 5 pieces of sushi (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp, tamago (the egg omelet sushi), and a california roll for $12.95.
