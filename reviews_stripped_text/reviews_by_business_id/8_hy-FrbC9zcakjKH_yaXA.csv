The decor is very reminiscent of a cool place you'd find in downtown Los Angeles. Everything was excellent and I'm glad I stopped in,voNl6rXo9c-NuYIBIj5AQg,0,0,5,NUklwihFKYAJKAioIF2Dag
1253720,2018-05-28,1,8_hy-FrbC9zcakjKH_yaXA,"One of, if not THE best, fusion taco place I've had the pleasure of finding. Thank goodness there are two locations in Vegas, one on the west side Durango and one downtown near Fremont. Their carne asada taco is to die for, perfectly grilled with a nice sweet subtle flavor. Not too spicy. I also had a fish taco that was extremely delicious. My sister and her friend ordered cauliflower tacos which I did not have the chance to try during this trip. But they both raves about how delicious it was, I'm gonna have to make another visit to try them. Perfect that they have vegetarian options here to accommodate! There are a few other unique items on their menu, such as a crispy taco selection which I didn't get to try this time. BOMB TACOS will keep me even more excited for taco Tuesday's to come. A must visit in Las Vegas! The only reason I post 4 instead of 5 stars is due to their being out of sangria... on a Friday night! How could they  still love this place regardless.",Fv_HnsFKqJ591qoVFAr86g,1,1,4,zpeBavVoD_FnuYwBaYQfhw

I'm a fan of the original location on Durango, particularly of their grilled octopus tacos that are an occasional daily special (peep the insta to know when), but even without specials, the standard street tacos are anything but, particularly their vegan varieties. 

Despite the name, they offer more than tacos, including burritos and asada fries, but I stick to the handheld version. The array of protein options will make your decision making difficult, but the rock shrimp, crispy potato, fried cauliflower, asada, and mushroom are all pretty good. They also have a crispy brisket version I haven't yet managed to try. 

TIP: Prices are high and my appetite for tacos is large so, I go on Tuesdays when they have specials- 5/$15, from a limited selection.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,16,4,QiMV-i_acwRIb_Qrd_bwtg

3538963,2018-04-12,1,8_hy-FrbC9zcakjKH_yaXA,"So open for a week at this location. Located Downtown Las Vegas where a much needed taco was in very much need! Place is clean and very cute with some beginnings of murals painted by Chef Robert himself. So, not only does he cook some delicious food but he brings his artistic talents to create a great atmosphere. The menu has a little bit of everything. So, I began with the basics when it comes to tacos.  Carne Asada -  Fine diced onions/ cilantro with a guajillo sauce (not spicy and very tasty), fresh guacamole and light cheese all on a small (street tacos size corn tortilla) super hot which is the way any taco should be served in order to enjoy the freshness of the guacamole and other fresh ingredients. Next I had the Carnitas - same construction as the asada except with pork carnitas.  Next had the Al Pastor which was very good. Probably not my favorite of everything I had, but definitely worth trying. Why was it not my favorite? It's more of  home made al pastor not shawarma style which in my opinion is what a true al pastor should be all the time no exceptions but none the less good flavor. I then moved on to the Braised Brisket which by far was the best of them all. Fresh Romain, guajillo, pico, a dap of sour cream, fresh guacamole and topped off with just the right amount of cotija cheese all in a crispy warm shell corn tortilla. To finish it all the rock shrimp tacos which were good.
In my opinion best and must have's are:  Braised Brisket, Carne Asada and Carnitas. 

They have veggie and vegan menu options (which I will try next time I stop by) 

Currently they do serve beer, Mexican Coke and other Mexican drinks as well as fresh waters are coming soon.

They will also be expanding the menu to burritos and some other seafood options.  
Bomb Tacos are bomb and glad to have them downtown!  Perfect place to go eat after being on Fremont Street on a late weekend. Open until 2am on weekend and midnight during the week.  
Thank you Chef Robert & Team for bringing some quick, easy and enjoyable tacos to our Great Downtown Las Vegas!",3cBVCNsm273EJ_GM4FVvJg,3,1,5,yppKSqYAnxAYemz6XLHc7Q

As soon as I walked in, I ran into the line of maybe 5 people. There was one person behind the counter taking orders and running food and drink (poor guy I thought.) Waiting in line gave me enough time to look at this awesome taco menu. It's written beautifully on a chalk board! They have so many options for such a tiny shop, and I wanted to try them all! I settled for a. 3 carnitas tacos plate with rice and beans and one shrimp taco (OMG THE HABANERO SAUCE IS DEADLY PLEASE ORDER IT ON THE SIDE IF YOU DONT WANT TO DIE) and a Sangria! What!? You sell alcohol too? Beers on tap? Holy Guacamole! 
We took an open table and as much as I love the decor, the tables are very awkward.. This was a puzzle for me as I sat and waited..when I finally realize that these tables are works of art! They are bar stools turned tables! That's super rad.
Our food and drink came out pretty quickly and overall was ok, I think I may just need to order something else but the SHRIMP TACO was BOMB, but I think the sangria was my favorite. Ha! Can't wait to bring the squad!

Tacos I supremely recommend:
Fried potato 
Rock shrimp
Carnitas
Barbacoa in the fried shell

And we loved everything about our order. We ordered Guac, salsa and chips. Fresh fried corn chips, yummy Guac and two types of salsa. My husband loved the red and I loved the green. But it was hard to compare because they tasted amazing. 

I ordered the chicken and carne asada. My husband ordered the carne asada and brisket. I ended up with his meal and he with mine. We didn't notice until the end. Either way it was fantastic. It's hard to find good carne asada with good seasoning, these hit the spot. The brisket had a crunchy shell and I loved all the additions. Really made the taco. They are small but don't lack in taste. Each well filling portion. My husband loved his chicken, I recognise by the wide eyes he gets when he finished his first bite. I kept oogling my first taco before I realised he has finished both!

Another customer had received the wrong taco and she sent it back. I got sad, I would have eaten another, regardless what it was. :)",wVs0CRseaC48G9Vm3rJMwQ,0,0,5,TuF7Xsw82AyDj-sNW_JrhQ

Right when you walk in the vibe to me was beachy and cool. There were lots of taco options from mushroom to shrimp diablo. 

There were so many yummy options we ordered about 7 different tacos. I will tell you right now the crispy potato taco is sooo delish! 
We were handed our drinks and took a seat to wait for our order we didn't wait long but we were greeted while waiting by midget man (that's what he said to call him) to see if everything was ok and assured us our order was on its way and offered to dance for us while we waited haha. He brought us out a extra taco as well because he thought our wait was long, which it wasn't. 

As we dug in to our tacos we noticed we were missing 1 taco so we went to tell midget man and he fixed it right away. The manager came out and apologized for the missing taco and offered us some special sauce they made that was a habanero mango Chile it was super spicy but sooo good!! 
The manager then brought us out our missing taco plus a extra and still was apologizing but it really wasn't a big deal. 
We really liked the place and the staff! Tacos were on point as well as the sauces! Midget man was so cool and definitely made our experience memorable! I will be visiting bomb tacos again",zdV9SNsPQ7E7vC1nWfx_lg,21,21,4,8sDTkZnA-Wruo6l5RoztgA

Keep in mind I'm from Louisiana where we have some of the best food in the world.

I figured I would give it a 4* review.   4 stars is standard for an upscale taco place - - one with a 'creative' menu, where you pay somewhat more than at a barrio taqueria,  but basically, you are getting tacos.  And after having the tacos, you say, ""well that was different - - I like what the did with the [fill in some random aspect here]"".  But, basically, you just had some upscale tacos.

Despite my most curmudgeonly disposition,  I have to bow my head in respect.   Yes, the menu is every possible shade of 'creative'.   Yes, in the end,  you get tacos, with a twist.

But wow are the people there great - - the person taking the order had real heart.   The person serving the tacos, and asking if everything is OK,  had real heart.   The tacos were, in fact, not just creative,  but wowsville subtle.   Gems of perfection.   Works of bloody art.
