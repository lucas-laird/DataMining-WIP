My mom and I were in Las Vegas for a softball tournament and wanted to venture out of the hotel for dinner. I've been vegan for about 4 months now so I decided to search Yelp for an interesting, healthy, and delicious vegan spot for our meal. I found Vegenation and was lured in by the gorgeous pictures of pink sushi and a bright green living wall. Unfortunately, although a cute and casual environment, this excursion was horrible. 

I won't bore you anymore with all of the lengthy details so here is a summary of our disappointing night-

CONS- 
*weird and uninviting smell
*THE WORST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant...waitress was awkward and distant, never cleared our menus or plates, and brought our appetizers and dinner all at the same time
*AVERAGE main courses- something you could buy from the frozen section (soggy bread and watery pasta sauce) 

PROS
*pretty setting
*delicious appetizers (dumplings & tamales)
*nice white wine


OVERALL don't come here & waste money on mediocre food and services

We immediately get seated and I decide to get what they recommend which is the chicken waffles and my brother gets the breakfast burrito. The wait is okay and we finally get the food. The hype around this place doesn't meet my expectation the food is bland and tasteless, the fries feel like burnt potatoes and the ""ketchup"" is basically water and tomatoes mooshed up. The chicken is alright for being vegan lowkey tastes like flour only good thing is the waffles. I tasted the burrito and I thought I didn't take a big enough bite because I tasted nothing.

We also had the tamale appetizer ($7). Tamales (2) were outstanding. Very well flavored, masa was not too heavy. Nice sauce and filling. I definitely recommend these.

My wife had the Stuffed French toast - she thought it was really good, filled with fresh fruit and ""cream cheese"". It was served with a side of fruit.

My husband and I have been going to VegeNation since it's soft opening and we have progressively watched it go downhill. The food is hit or miss with a lot more misses and the service is horrible.

After an awkward silence i went ahead and ordered our entire nights menu in case i wouldn't get an opportunity to order again, which seemed probable with the service we already had. The food was very mediocre. We ended up wishing we got Taco Bell. Would have been a better meal. 

Two stars because the work they are doing with students in the valley is very admirable. Also, CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ARE AMAZING. One thing that will keep us back.

I am still pining away for Steph & Justin's VegOut AYS - nothing could top that dish!

I couldn't decide between the meatball sub or the quesadilla, until I saw the table next to me get the quesadilla.  It looked good so I ordered that.  Sushi came out almost immediately.  Today there was a red bell pepper strip, some avocado and what tasted like a carrot puree on top.  Really good, flavorful and tasty.  Scarfed those 6 little rolls down in a blink of an eye.  

Then the quesadilla came out.  Very pretty with the chipolte sauce drizzled on top.  My order was mostly sweet potato puree with some black beans sprinkled throughout.  So it was kinda mushy to eat.  But it had just a slight spicyness because of the chipolte sauce.  I wish there had been more sauce and black beans.  

Between those two dishes, I was too full for dessert.  Next time.  And there will be a next time.

Tip:  paid metered parking ends at 9th.  I parked on the side of the apt complex at 9th & Carson and walked the 2.5 blocks down.  No problems :)",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,0,0,5,mkx2UAdJ7Kr4VZq8FAra3Q

342242,2015-09-27,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Vegenation had a promotion on Facebook where they would bestow a round of mimosas to someone who tagged friends they would like to have Sunday brunch with on their post. 

My roommate and I tagged each other and three other mutual friends and we BOTH got chosen. 

Two rounds of free drinks guarantees I will come to your restaurant, but it doesn't guarantee a good review. So, off we went, to try a vegan brunch. Only one of us is a vegan and my 8 year old daughter has a nut allergy, making vegan restaurants tricky.

We were sat quickly. Live music, exposed ventilation, greenery, reclaimed wood and great art makes for an amazing atmosphere. It felt hip and cultured and comfortable all at once. 

In comes our server, Vanessa. Vanessa appeared to truly love her job, something few server exude. We put in our drink orders. The adults all ordered the adult beverages of our choice, as well as Peruvian French Press coffee, and my daughter ordered a berry smoothie. As Vanessa walked away, I realized I forgot to mention my kiddo's nut allergy. I called Vanessa back and asked that there be no almond milk in the smoothie. Vanessa handled it like a pro. 

Food orders were put in later. The menu had a tiny illustrated peanut next to anything that had nuts in it. French toast was a no go for the kid. (My BFF ordered it, though, and I had a bite... heaven). Kid wanted mac'n'cheese, and they were out, but Vanessa handled it like a pro: ""Don't worry sweetie, it's not that good anyway"". We look at the menu again, and kiddo decides on the waffle, which has no tiny peanut with the description. 

The food came out fast. It was all amazing. I was cutting the kiddo's waffle, pouring on the syrup, and Vanessa bursts out of the kitchen, and practically yells ""DON'T EAT THAT!"". It turned out the waffle was made with cashews. Vanessa took it away, brought out a side of fruit to occupy my daughter and brought back a ""cheese"" pizza, which my daughter loved... until she found a piece of a plastic bag in the soy cheese. Vanessa apologized profusely and took it off the bill. The chef came out and also apologized profusely. 

But these things happen, it's not that big of a deal to me, and I told them that. I just wanted them to know because the next time it happens it might be to someone who doesn't know how a restaurant works. And let's face it....The burrito I had was wonderful. The guacamole was incredible. The French toast was to die for, as was the meatball sub and the sushi. Plus they gave us free drinks! 

I was a server for a long time and I know Vegenation is new. I know ""New Restaurant Problems"" are a real thing. I am a bit miffed that their menu did not have a tiny peanut next to the waffle item, which is the only reason I'm not giving five stars. 

The food and drinks, the atmosphere and the service were amazing. Seriously, if you want good service, ASK FOR VANESSA. And my carnivorous friends enjoyed their meals thoroughly. Since when does that ever happen at a vegan restaurant??",GytLpb49JEL8SaH5xUMvcQ,1,0,4,vvrz-T37ABTls5VJoDPUSA

The chilled jalapeno could of been pickled, grilled or served without the stem to make it tastier.The warm chips were nice though. The tamale, had to order some hot sauce to get my mouth salivating so I could swallow the saw dust like tamale dough. Not enough flavor stuffed into the tamale, just some lentils and topped with what tasted like canned green chilies. These were shared between my wife and I but had no app plates brought to us. I ordered the Tagine of harissa coated roasted vegetable and the first five bites were of potato that tasted like my wife's stale fried potato logs but cut into small pieces and sauced heavily. None of the other vegetables tasted roasted, the eggplant was chewy, zucchini tasted like it was blanched, and the sweet potato looked like it may have been oven roasted but come on!! Peel the skin off of the sweet potato! Elevate your cuisine and step it up. This isn't  hippie commune commissary food. This was served with quinoa which was swimming with all the vegetables in sauce. I sent this back and ordered the sweet potato ravioli, what a joke. Shouldn't have to use a knife in a pasta dish but the asparagus was too large, not bite size, the dish was served with way too much sauce, looked like a soup and the worst part is that the pasta was raw as in not cooked. I think the menu said or was told that it had pecans, I didn't taste any if so. For drinks my wife had the Pina Colada which was very good, I had a Riesling. My complaint on the wine is that it was served in a recycled wine bottle cut down into a  cup.  I appreciate using recycled this and that but good wine deserves wine glasses with stems. Nice to have a restaurant of this type (pure vegan) but I would rather go to a Mediterranean or Indian place that had vegan options, and a higher level of service standards.",z2sHGXNZzNyZf9BvfO-4WA,0,0,2,OdFVbQ8uyy0BXMRp-pBIgw

The food is actually not bad. Tried the sushi, sliders, meatballs, quesadilla, fruit loop salad.

I'm going to honest.  The food is good but the names of the dishes are horribly misleading.  

The sushi was good but it tastes like a Korean BimBap(GimBap). So that's what the should call it.

The mucho Garcia quesadilla tastes like bean burrito. So that's what they should call it.

The meatballs taste like arancini, but I like it.

The sliders taste like well not sliders. Can't think of a name but it's was good.

I just don't like misleading names.

Tip on parking: If you park in a lot after 6pm it is an automatic $10. Before 6 it is $2 an hour right behind Vegenation (other lots can charge higher because they are private owners). Park on the street for $2 an hour and, don't worry about running to the meter because you're running out of time, there's an app for that.

This is the kind of place you can take meat eaters and hardcore vegans alike, the food is SO incredibly delicious and well prepared and sophisticated that it makes a fun lunch date or even a fancy gourmet dinner.

What you really want to know, is what I recommend from the menu.  From what I've tasted, here are my top picks.

1) Asian BBQ Tofu Bao Buns.  Absolutely delicious, savory, saucy, little zing to them, 100% amazing.  They will get inhaled within seconds.  Comes with two nicely-sized buns, so it's easy to share for 2 people.

2) Portabello mushroom sliders (called the ""Downtown Tony"").  These are to DIE FOR.  Please order this if you like sandwiches/sliders/tasty, saucy and slightly spicy food.

3) THE BROWNIE SUNDAE. It's gluten free.  It's gooey and soft (how they do this, I have no idea).  It's massive with two big scoops of amazing vegan ice cream, caramelized banana, sliced fruits, heaven.  If you come here and you don't order this for dessert, you are seriously missing out on a big part of life.  No excuses, you have to get this!

Everything else looks great, I just haven't had a chance to order it yet and probably won't since the two items listed above are so freaking good I will likely never order anything else.

Oh also, prices are extremely reasonable (like $10 for a delicious, gourmet, large dinner entree), staff is incredibly friendly, their T-shirts are amazing, service was great, atmosphere and decor was very LA-esque (in a good way) and parking on the street was simple.

We will be back many, many times.  Thank God for Vegas Vegans taking the plunge into opening vegan-only restaurants.  We THANK YOU for this and also for putting incredibly talented gourmet chefs in the kitchen for our dining experience.",86A8KKZwHvli-V2DF7XvJg,2,1,5,NbZ1un5nfTdlpoS7yXjPpQ

I ordered the Daniel Negreanu entree, which is a ""meatball"" grinder with Parmesan style cheese and served with oven baked togarashi fries, I ordered to go. Overall the sandwich was very tasty!!! This sandwich would be the one you serve to the husband or boyfriend you are trying to convince that vegan doesn't equate to tasteless and bland.The meatball tasted like the real thing. I let my son try some and he was impressed, he's 23. The roll reminded me of the New York style crusty hoagie roll I grew up with on the East Coast. 
Now the reason I couldn't give an excellent rating was that the fries, even though they were tasty, were mostly over cooked. You only get like five (they are cut wedges) and three of mine were way over cooked. 
The hostess was very friendly and the place was briskly busy. The visit was on a Saturday, early evening, in the 5:00 hour. Next time I may eat in and see how the table side serve is. Or the next time I decide to get it to go, I'll order ahead because it was a bit of a wait for the food.

 The service is friendly but  slow and the food lacks flavour. The out of Africa dish is supposed to be spicy. It is not spicy at all.

The buns used for the downtown tony and vegeNation burger taste like they are 15 days old. Dry and hard. Salad is meh.

If you have an allergy let them know, they will kindly suggest replacing ingredients! Water was refilled constantly, thats a sign of great attentive customer service!

The flavor was unbelievable, and the ingredients went surprisingly well together!) restaurants should have this in SoCal.

My chicken pot pie was alright except that half of the gnocchi tasted like flour because they were undercooked. My husband tried to like the tacos but they weren't good enough to eat. I tried them and it tasted like tomato paste. 

Here's the thing...I don't expect to like everything I try but at a restaurant I expect the server to care somewhat. I don't remember her name but she had a ""vegan"" tatoo on her neck. We told her we couldn't eat the tacos and she did not try to fix the issue.

There are lovely plants, a communal table if you feeling like mingling. And just a really good energy to the place. I introduced myself to Chef Donald and wished him well.

971297,2016-01-19,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"This is a great restaurant whether you're vegan, vegetarian or simply trying to find delicious health conscious food, this is the place to eat in Las Vegas. In a town where food is abundant but vegan options are scarce VegeNation is an oasis of light in the darkness. The gluten free pasta was perfectly prepared. More like al dente wheat pasta than other grainy or mushy gluten free styles. The vodka sauce was creamy and perfectly flavorful. A balanced delicate richness is difficult to achieve with traditional ingredients when preparing vodka sauce so I tip my hat to this beautifully balanced vegan version. The pizza was much like any other vegan artisan style and had some less common, more health concious toppings to choose from. The sauce on the pizza was a bit plain. In my opinion it could use some more floral and savory flavors. Although slightly under salted the curried red beans and quinoa had a great flavor profile and the beans were prepared quite well, perfectly firm skin with soft creamy innards. I relished the flavor of the blueberry cheesecake and the crust had an amazing Graham cracker taste and feel which I love on my cheesecake. That said, the texture of the filling was a bit grainy which detracted from the presence of a perfectly sweet, cheesy/custard-like flavor. The service was decent. You could tell that everyone on the staff enjoyed working there which added to the cheery casual ambience of this cozy cafe.

We ordered the Ellen Degeneres raw collard tacos (partly because of the name) and the East West jackfruit tacos. We also ordered one carrot cake to go. Both of the entrees were awesome! Though the way they cut the limes made it hard to squeeze any juice out of them onto the tacos. The carrot cake was pretty great too though I think the desserts were a bit overpriced at least for the size of the carrot cake. I probably would go with a different dessert next time just because I've had better vegan carrot cake at other places. But all in all the food was great. I would definitely come back!

1020341,2016-01-09,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I just visited for my third time. I keep hoping that the food and service will get better with time but it hasn't happened.

SERVICE:
It seems like the servers, hostess and busboys have never worked in a restaurant before. Everyone is very awkward and unprofessional. The other thing I have noticed with each visit is that some tables get good service while others (like my table) get lackluster service. It seems like the servers favor regular customers or friends and neglect you if you aren't in those categories. I have had to ask for refills on drinks every time without them being attentive because they are too busy chatting with the chosen ones.

FOOD:
I have tried the portabella sliders, sushi roll, the spaghetti with meatballs and the meatball grinder. While OK, everything is lacking flavor and pizazz. 
Take the meatball grinder...It is a roll with 5 small meatballs (taste just like gardein meatless meatballs...maybe they are?) with some sauce and vegan cheese. It is very basic and the taste is lacking. Some grilled onions and peppers would go a long way to make this basic sandwich better. The roll is not sturdy enough to handle the runny sauce and gets soggy within minutes. The spaghetti is the same story...basic spaghetti with sauce and the meatballs. Again, some onions and peppers...something besides the basic sauce would be good. The portabella sliders are OK but the rolls they come on were stale tasting. The sushi is good but again is just plain bland. Some spices and seasonings would go a long way to make this place better.

PRICES:
Most dishes are in the $11-$12 range. The meatball grinder is not worth anywhere near the $11 they want for it and the $11 spaghetti dish is a very small portion size and again not worth the $11. 

With few totally vegan restaurants in town, I was excited to try Vegenation initially. My experiences have been lackluster however.

It just seems like A) the staff id very inexperienced and caters to regulars; B) the food is lacking substance and could be jazzed up and C) the prices are out of line for what they are serving up.",XcDvtHwx6BIa2tVb_vCjSg,0,0,2,Ci_PQAocW9Hq00pB5EWJaA
1020676,2016-02-10,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"This place needs a little work. Went mid-morning on a weekday and we were handed the brunch/breakfast menu. After being pulled in by the breakfast options we decided to order the waffles. Our server then told us breakfast wasn't being served at the time & we shouldn't have been given that menu. Seems like an opening week mistake not something that should be happening at this point. 

We decided on the bao which was the best thing we tried. Highly recommend. The black bean quesadilla was tasty but not anything to write home about. The jackfruit tacos were not my cup of tea but others in my group dug them. The big haus salad was very good & filling but I could probably make something like it at home. 

I don't like that they put the term meat balls on their menu. At least put it in quotes, ""meat"" balls, so people can easily understand it isn't meat nor are there meat options. Many people know everything is plant based here but perhaps those discovering this place on a whim may not.

The taste of the food was very good, but the service was clearly sub-par, and the portions size/value ridiculously bad. 

Spouse had a Burger, it was delicious and reasonable for $12. 

I had the 'Power Haus"" salad. It was basically an slightly oversized side salad. Delicious, but barely sized for a starter. A bowl of little but lettuce of various kinds, a few thin slices of carrot, a few other items, you get it. Should have been listed for $5, maybe $6. Was $12. I was more hungry after eating it than before. We brought up the lack of substance to an employee, and was told we should have chosen another menu item. Well, thank you for that information.

Service was seriously lacking on attention. Water was served without straws, had to flag down a waiter to get them. Nobody refilled our glasses after we emptied them 5 minutes into the meal. Nobody paid attention, nobody in sight.

Again, the food tasted real good, but there are so many options in LV to get a solid, well crafted salad with plenty of substance in the $12 - $15 range, and receiving attentive service, so I don't see why we would return. The place looked nice, but the value and the service just isn't there. Too bad.",Kua408hhmBUcBeeWSDkhzA,0,1,2,NsnPCEcpDXOAsYKySLenIw

The place is decorated beautifully and has a very friendly atmosphere. We ordered our drinks and continued to look at the menu which was a bit smaller than I remembered when it came to entrees. And they were out of a few things including the buffalo cauliflower wings which was a HUGE bummer because that's one of the main reasons I come here. My boyfriend and I had a very tough time finding something we wanted to eat because nothing really stood out to us. Eventually we decided on our meals, we got the pop-up queso, I had the vegetable thai curry and he got the ""holy mole"" tacos. Our food took a little while to get to the table but our waitress was able to give us a warning on that because the kitchen was backed up, which was okay. 

We were served the queso and chips first-it was outstanding. Had I known how the rest of our meals would have been I would have just gotten about 3 orders of the queso.
Our dishes arrived. Right off the bat my boyfriend noted that the Mole tacos did not look or smell appetizing and boy he was right. I told him that if he didn't like them we would trade plates. I tasted my curry and it was pretty good. Tasted like your standard yellow curry, my only complaint is that I wish it had more veggies in it. 
My boyfriend ended up hating his tacos, and usually if he doesn't like it he will eat something anyway but he immediately wanted to trade like I offered so we did. The tacos were indeed really really bad but I finished them just so they didn't go to waste. The mole was very strong and just lacked any other flavors. He wasn't crazy about the curry, and we agreed not to order these dishes again if we return. 
During our visit that took about 1 hour, we were only asked if we would want refills one time, and it was about 45 minutes after receiving our drinks for the first time. We didn't get the chance to ask before hand because that was the only time our waitress came around.
All in all I'd love to return here for a small appetizer and a drink. It's a lovely place to sit down and chat and take in the atmosphere.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,0,0,3,vUk8Kobi9chCRk3_NBZH7g

PROS
+ Service is always on point
+ Ordered the gluten-free crust mushroom pizza +1 for not using Daiya cheese and another +1 for only charging $1 for gluten-free #winning
+ They have the most orgasmic vegan desserts. I've tried the tiramisu and the brownie Sunday so far and I plan on trying everything in time. 
+ Buffalo cauliflower 'wings' enough said

CONS
- They were out of the buffalo cauliflower 'wings' wahhh they're so good!

Started with the Yelp Check-In giftie - a glass of lovely Apple Cider Sangria. Light and delicious.

Ordered the Meatball sub, which was really truly great!
Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I'm all about the balls. These balls were Aromatic and slightly spicy - I can't wait to put 'em in my mouth again!  

Ditto for the perfectly spiced potato wedges.

The desert (Brownie Sundae) was the only 'meh' part of the meal.
This almond milk ice cream was more ice than cream, and not particularly tasty. Was the brownie 'raw'? It had that kind of texture. I prefer a more baked and crusty take.

Nevertheless I'll totally let that go. I really really like this place.

1379134,2016-02-27,3,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I am not a foodie. I am not a strict vegetarian,  and I am not a vegan. But if I lived in Las Vegas I would be all of those things because I could eat at Vegenation anytime I want.  

We went to Vegenation to try something different and because it was walking distance from the fun at Fremont Street. It is only one street away from the bars,  lights, loud music, and pizza places but in that one short block you find yourself in what feels like a neighborhood restaurant staffed with very friendly young people who clearly enjoy their jobs and everything about the foods they prepare and serve. 

We like to try different places when we travel but Vegenation was so good we went two nights in a row during a short visit to Las Vegas. After the first visit  were sure that we would be disappointed with any other choice. The food, location, cleanliness, service,  and atmosphere are all perfect. I didn't even notice the price because we were trying different things. The food was so good we gave our complete-stranger table neighbors one of our tacos just so they could try something they discussed but didn't order. None of us knew what jackfruit was or how good it could be... 

The black bean hummus with blue corn chips and steamed spinach/mushroom dumplings with herb soy sauce are great. The east West tacos are **shockingly** good. I had to Google jackfruit (the pork substitute in the tacos) and am amazed that they are so good. Three tacos are huge,  tasty,  and filling. They are not a compromise from real BBQ pork tacos; they are better. I am an occasional carnivore,  I live in Texas where tacos and BBQ are everywhere,  and I could eat these tacos every,  single,  day. We enjoyed the tacos and thank every yelp member who suggested them.

I don't have enough superlatives for the mushroom pizza. Just buy one. Eat it. Be happy. Write your own review and keep a thesaurus handy to find synonyms for ""delicious,"" ""perfect,"" and ""fresh."" Okay,  I'll try. We ordered this two days in a row; it was always hot. The crust was always perfect. We could not have eaten more,  and none went to waste. The tomato sauce is so intensely fresh and tomato tasting I wanted to thank the chef AND the farmer. The mushrooms are also intensely flavored, perfectly seasoned,  and saut√©ed to perfection before they go on the pizza. Cilantro makes it taste even more fresh. Really,  really good. We are UNHAPPY that our hotel room doesn't have a refrigerator ONLY because we would have ordered an extra pizza each day to snack on. Get one. You won't regret it. The two other pizza options looked equally good but we just didn't want to take the chance... 

90 % of restaurants just follow the program of feeding you in their theme,  and getting you in and out. Maybe 8 % really care about their food and the dining experience. A tiny 2 % do all of those things and care about what you are putting in your body whether it be the best beef,  rare ingredients, youghtful preparation and presentation, or just ingredients that are healthy,  fresh,  and thoughtfully prepard. That last group is a very rare and cherished group,  in my book,  and they range from tiny kitchens to Michelin starred restaurants. Vegetation is in the top 2 %. I will ALWAYS visit in Las Vegas and pine for it elsewhere. 

Five stars. 

Great food. 

Great experience. 

Great location. 

Get so much food for 30 bucks (for two) that you give some of it away.

1444351,2015-06-04,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Let me just start out by saying: WOW. This place is one for the record books!! We went there last night for the first time, after finding it via ""vegan restaurant"" search on here. So happy that we went! 

The ambiance is very mellow and the restaurant design is one you would find in the outdoors, with vines hanging around and an almost rustic theme throughout. Properly named, VegeNation, is quite a turn than other vegan restaurants that I've visited in Vegas before. The service was spot on and our waitress was very attentive. We ordered water and the Jamaican hibiscus punch (really tasty- had a clove/cinnamon taste to the hibiscus and not too sweet) as we looked over the menu.

To start, we ordered the Bao Wow and the Italian Dumplings. The Bao Wow came out first, and since we'd never had Bao buns before it was quite the experience. These two little scrumptious sandwiches were gone in less than five minutes. The Bao Buns were lightly sweetened, steamed to perfection and the tofu was cooked just right..mix in some spinach, saut√©ed mushrooms, and a sweet kind of terriyaki sauce, and we have a winner people. Seriously. Then, while waiting for our pasta to come, we saw our waitress walk by with the Save The Tuna starter. Needless to say, we ordered that too because we are obsessed with sushi. And while we were at it, we also ordered the Pho-King-Delicious (we were HUNGRY).

The pasta came out quickly followed by the sushi and the pho. We ate the sushi first- the rice was a dark purple colour and it looked like it contained jackfruit and a few other veggies. It was plated on a creamy sauce of the gods and came with soy sauce. That was gone in less than two minutes. Very well put together and thought out- made our sushi that we make at home seem like a waste of time.

Now, on to the pasta entree, the Italian Dumplings. Just when we thought our taste buds were at their max in the ""wow factor"" we were proven wrong again. The sauce was what seemed like a mushroom gravy combination and it was mixed with chunks of aspargus. The pasta was phenomenal with just the right amount of sweet potatoes and veggies to pasta (certainly wished there were more of those homemade dumplings on the plate as we contemplated getting another dish of it).

The Pho-King-Delicious came out steaming. It was the darkest pho soup I have ever seen, as it was a very deep black colour. Make sure you have a nice cool beverage ready for this soup because it is SPICY. If you have congestion, this is definitely the cure. The ""Miracle noodles"", the tofu cubes, veggies and the broth were overall very delicious but too spicy for me to continue eating. No waste there, though, because my partner enjoyed the rest of it. WIN.

At this point, I was still hungry and perused the menu again. The Bao Wow called to me again and I couldnt help myself as I ordered another round. Even more tasty than the first..can you believe it?

Lastly, we ordered dessert even though we were feeling almost too full (gotta live a little, amirite?). So, we ended our meal with the brownie sundae. Gd damn it was so good. One scoop each of chocolate and vanilla almond milk ice cream, perfectly carmelized banana halves, slices of strawberries, nuts, caramel and chocolate sauce on top of a decadent brownie (that was soft and chewy in the center). We ate the whole thing, despite ourselves. After this, we quickly ordered the check so as not to order anything else.

This meal was what my vegan dreams are made of and much more than I could ever expect. We were even able to meet the chef and give our profound thanks and admiration at such a dreamy meal. Left the restaurant full and happy. Cannot wait to go back..do yourself a favour and go there too! (:",dAkm7-iv8HiePcrfLa3MBw,3,0,5,ikcbkOa5DWZ5vyOZWri4Yg

I know that flavors and textures are going to be different when trying to recreate Omnivorous dishes with Vegan ingredients.  I wasn't expecting my ""meatball sub sandwich"" to taste like its namesake, but I wanted it to taste good. It didn't. 

The grilled cheese, that tasted great, like a savory Gruy√®re melt. But the texture - smooth at first - quickly became paste-like and caused a traffic jam at the back of my throat, making it difficult to swallow. 

The Buffalo cauliflower was AWESOME. I suspect that every dish that isn't trying to be something it's not is probably excellent, but that's not the majority of the menu. 

I have to say that I didn't complain at all, complimented the food when the server asked, because everyone around me did as well.  But later on, my entire party all said something to the effect of ""yeah, it was OK... But... Yeah, not going back.""

I think we all wanted to believe.

As for the 'Wings', I was somewhat dubious as to how this would taste, being a big chicken wing fan.  It did have the same texture you would expect in very good boneless wings.  The buffalo sauce used for this seemed spot on without being too spicy or too bland (for which I thought might happen).  

The Gnocchi was amazing.  There is a lot going on in this bowl with tastes and textures.  A really nice comfort food.  My only wish/ suggestion would be that they add a side for a bread or roll type option to dip into the bowl.

The interior of the restaurant was clean with a modern hippie activist vibe, and it was packed in there. 

I got the East meets West tacos and they were incredible - sweet and spicy, and the jackfruit made them really interesting. They also held up well despite taking them through airport security. In addition, we got the non-tuna sushi roll which was much smaller than expected, but also very delicious. I was hoping there would be more though - it looked so small and sad in the take-out box! 

Last of all, the blueberry cheesecake. It was good, but it melted into a sad puddle of goop during the hour or so it took from the restaurant to get to our gate.

MY LITTLE DUMPLING: steamed Shiitake and spinach dumplings. Easily some of the best dumplings I've had, stunningly good quality. They were clearly fresh and handmade, with ample filling, and a tasty dipping sauce to boot. But $6 for a portion of 5 just-bigger-than-bite-size bits was steep.
DOWNTOWN TONY: Trio of portabella sliders with kale and sriracha aioli. Pretty good execution, good choice of mini brioche buns, but the aioli was so sparingly applied it seemed to be on there for color rather than flavor. Dish is plated with some simple potato fries and a house-made ketchup. Again, good quality!

Dishes are flavorful but sophisticated, with a  price tag to match. Solo lunch above was a hair below $20 with tip. Service was polite and attentive, really love the way they've styled the space! I'll come back to try their vegan sushi and bao.

But maybe you are not into granola but love the plant-based food selections available from vegan eateries? I also nominate VegeNation for your choicest choice.  However, I only went here for breakfast!  I want to go back though, for the other meals of the day!

A laid-back activist feel to the decor permeates the empowerment you feel when you order from this menu.  From the Food not Bombs bowl to the don't eat friends artwork, it highlights the vegan movement in a non-confrontational way.  The food is good, so why wouldn't you eat here?

This place is open early on weekends for brekkie, which is always a plus.  So few places open on Saturday or Sunday before 10 am!  What happens if you want a real breakfast not just coffee?  Well, go to VegeNation.  Chik'n and Waffles?  Breakfast burrito? My favorite is that they have bowl options including bean-based, acai based, quinoa-based and chia seed pudding-based.  Awesome.  The Perky Potion brings coffee to a new level.

As for the rest of the options during other times of the day.... I can't say I tried them, but looking at the menu, I dream about their many options listed as having nuts but not gluten or just nuts or no nuts, but all vegan.  Who cares?  So amazing that they have pho, Asian tacos, gluten-free pizza, buffalo cauliflower, sushi and tamales.  I would go back here in a heartbeat.  The place is in downtown, near the Container Park area, so be wary of how many people might be there - you may need to wait. Well worth it!

I am not a vegan, but eat mostly plant based. I felt invited and not judged. That is fairly hard in this type of circle, so thank you. 



We were told to try your restaurant by other vegans in the area. My friends were both plant based, vegetarian and vegan that I came with. We also met the 2 influential vegan lifestyle body building pros at Vegenation in town for the conference.

 I got a wonderful starter of buffalo cauliflower, ranch, and celery. Delicious! 

I followed it with a meal, I returned. It was great, but I dont like curry and it didnt say it had it in their on the menu. I couldn't order much else because I have an allergy to chipotle and it was in almost everything, even their black beans. And a sensitivity to mushrooms so that knocked out a few others. I just followed up with a dessert, chocolate tacos. They were yummy, a little salty, but very good. teeny tacos, could use to be bigger. 


I would have tried many other things had they used cayenne and not chipotle...but it is the trendiest spice right now besides turmeric so I get it. I did think too much of one flavor limits a menu though, especially in a plant based field. It would have been nice to see some interesting salads and soups and maybe some dipping bread. I have tried so many places in Seattle with the vegetarian vibe and I think Vegenation could do so much more with their passion. 

But it was flavorful and great service, I would go again, if chipotle wasn't so prominent. Their ranch was perfect! I would buy a bottle.",YQoyk_zgY6SO7xvx8_e_yA,0,0,4,SsrBKi4slR_LFMNEOlfL9g

The three stars are because though the food is fresh and made with pride and care it was not something that suited my paler and tastes very much. 
For my tastes I found the steamed dumplings appetizer rather bland and characterless the only taste coming from the dipping sauce. I also had the Fruit Loops salad which which, while very fresh, had a smaller proportion/ratio of grilled fruit to greens than I would have liked. It also had very little dressing for my taste.
For dessert I had the Brownie Sundae which had decent vanilla ice cream, not good (to my taste) chocolate ice cream and very plane/ordinary tasting brownie. It would have helped if the brownie was heated which it was not.
One more reason for the three stars is that though they advertise that they make cold pressed juices they DO NOT offer any fresh squeezed juices without alcohol so if you want any fresh juices you are forced to order one of their cocktails!
I got their version of a Pina Colada and was not pleased with the way it tasted.

The chicken pot pie gnocchi I don't have much complaints about. It looked like what I've seen from other pictures on Yelp.
The pizza was a huge disappointment. It looked so good from a recent IG post from chef Chloe. But our pizza looked nothing like that. Our crust was blonde, soggy, and the menu says ""fresh pineapple"". But clearly they were freshly out of the can!

Well, I am a vegetarian, cook 3 meals at home everyday and I frankly enjoy my food way more. But I don't want to compare it to mine, so I'm giving them a higher rating just for trying to accommodate a mass audience's palette. People expect healthy food to be bland and that's pretty much what you get. The food needs some more flavor and love. 

Here's what we ordered and what I think they need help with:
-Vegan Sushi- really good! no complaints
-Moroccan tagine (Casablanca)- Most of my veggies, especially the eggplant and sweet potatoes were undercooked. Just a few more minutes to steam/sautee them would have been great. I am also part Moroccan and this really doesn't taste like a couscous dish in terms of spices.
-Portobello sliders- To replicate a meaty burger/slider, I think they should use an entire portobello mushroom as opposed to them thinly sliced. There wasn't enough ""meat"" for the doughy bun. Needs more sauce as well. 
-Starter dumplings- There's a smokey cayenne powder taste in them. Not a fan of that. 
-Jamaican punch- pretty good but I think they should describe the expected flavor because not many people know what Jamaican spice tastes like.

The service was wonderful. Very attentive waiters. They were really on point. 

I will go back at some point and hopefully have a TASTIER experience.

1694615,2017-04-17,8,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"To preface: I'm a carnivore.
To retort preface: I'm a fan of vegetables, they're my staple food item at home, so I'm a meat-reductionist. I love my greens and other colors. 
In short, all of my pet peeves against vegan places were met here. Over-hyped by desperate veggie people, under-flavored for god knows what reasons, and uninspired menu descriptions, per usual. Fake this and fake that. 
Don't call it chicken if it's not chicken. 

Why do veggie places do that in the U.S.? Indian/ME/Medi veggie cuisine has been around for hundreds/thousands of years, and they don't call anything fake. I think vegan joints do this in hopes of attracting carnivores away from the dark side, as if we're too stupid or timid to try anything that isn't pretending to be a meat, but I've only found these descriptions repulsive, and I know I'm not alone in the sentiment. Are vegans attracted to meat-named dishes that aren't meat? That seems weird. Like if you have a moral objection to murder, would you be drawn to self-defense instruction that was called, ""Murder Class?"" I don't think so. I hope not. 

Anyway, rating the Nation was difficult, torn between a 2 and a 3 star. If I were vegan, I'd give it a 3. People love the dickens out of this place! They rave. It's a sanctuary for them. I understand! Veggie Safe Space. 
And the chef's plating is attractive, so I've had them bookmarked for awhile as there was clearly pride taken in the presentation of this unstoppable culinary trend in America that continues to suffer growing pains and engrained stigma. Visually, they're doing what they can to lure folks in to try this ""food.""

But on my first and last visit last night (for the ThugKitchen popup), the experience was Vegan-Average. Meaning: blas√© flavors and some pretty amateur execution. Take for example the mac&cheese ordered and photoed. Looks nice! But the noodles were cooked beyond al dente, an inexcusable faux pas for any restaurant claiming niche fame and enjoying an average 4.5star rating. Boil water, take out on time. The ""cheese"" had little to no flavor and was masked with a spicy kick. Meh. If you can't produce a simple home comfort food, well...

Our table shared an order of buffalo cauliflower. This simple item was the best of the evening. When I asked our server about how it was prepared, she didn't know. We're talking maybe 3 ingredients. The chef had to be conferred with to confirm.  Oy. Another service note, our desserts were brought out before the main course. We were asked if this was ok. What if it wasn't, were we supposed to say ""NO! Take it BACK!?"" Felt like we were in Crazy Town for a moment. Dessert before main dish, because they couldn't handle timing in the kitchen. 

About those desserts. I had the banana cream pie. The live banana on the side was about the only thing that tasted of its namesake. No memorable flavor otherwise, with the large dry pastry shell dominating the pasty-textured filling. A friend ordered the carrot cake, which tasted like someone pur√©ed some carrots and said, ""voil√†!"" That ain't cake. It looked like an upturned can of cat food that dried out in the sun. Most unappealing, unpalatable dessert ever.

That about wraps it up. Sad, I won't be back. But if you're a dyed in the wool vegan, you'll love this joint.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,14,7,2,QO0QrTUK_fFprHDx0fuKiA

-Juicy vodka and shot of life were so unique to me I was kind of skeptical at first but they ended up being two of the tastiest cocktails I've ever tried!

1717189,2015-08-20,2,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Brief Overview:
VegeNation is a great plant based option for dishes that are flavorful and healthy. If you're looking for a Vegan restaurant in town, this is a must visit location.

Pros:
- The dishes taste so good that they make you forget that you're eating vegan food
- The french toast and waffles are to die for!
- The decor is very green and hipster looking :-D
- I go here the first Sunday of each month as a part of the Reset Project and love their breakfast options. 

Cons:
- It's a little noisy in the restaurant which makes conversation a little difficult during busy times
- Not all food is 100% organic (but they source it that way the best they can)

Final Verdict:
VegeNation is a wonderful restaurant for people looking for more plant based options that taste great. I know meat eaters that go to this place and love it!",s1DTIKX-ZXcQOMDlcOI6Tg,4,2,5,vM8_Gbu73CiKlq4EX4ZVRA

This is probably one of the better vegetarian restaurants I've been to. They're located a block outside the downtown container park. The menu has plant based takes on classic dishes such as pho, chicken & waffles, pizza, and buffalo wings. Their ingredients are local from gardens and schools they sponsor, as well as their own garden. 

We grabbed a second lunch here and ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings and save the tuna. We enjoyed both dishes and especially my husband, who usually yelps vegetarian places just for me. The choice of cauliflower was perfect for ""wings"" as it's ""meaty"". The buffalo sauce had a nice kick. The save the tuna tasted like actually sushi! My husband surely couldn't tell the difference.

We had the Bao bun with tofu and the sauce was too strong, as if it came out of a can but it was edible.  The steamed dumplings were soggy. Next were the entrees and the African yam stew was best of the bunch.  The Russian standard with pasta tasted like regular pasta with tomato sauce. But the Vegie burger with a bean patty was so bland, even if eaten by itself.  My husband took one bite and that was it, no second try.  We also had the non-dairy pizza, which looked good but tasted like paper.  Honestly, this is the worst pizza I have ever had in my life.

You think you know what you're doing but you have no idea.  

Perhaps you have never had any professional dining experience. 

I'd be happy to train your staff for free because Donald is so amazing but you need to be fired or smart enough to hire someone to train the staff.  

There isn't one person who works there who displays any dining or serving experience.

1. Dim the lights to what is suitable for the time of day.

2. Train the waiters on how to approach a table, for instance, Stand straight up at the table. Say, ""Hi I'm Ann and I'm going to be taking care of you tonight .  Is this your first time here? We are a community based concept in that we use all local food and drink producers. blah blah whatever your spiel is.

3. May I get you started with some drinks. These are our special ones blah blah blah

4. GO GET THE DRINKS!

5. USE A TRAY TO CARRY EVERY SINGLE DRINK AND THINGS you need to bring to the table, like chopsticks, cream, teapot, soy sauce, etc.

6. When you return with the drinks, tell the guests about the menu. Give them a few more minutes to decide.

7. Take a spin through your section with your tray and take a look at every table and see if they need anything.

8. Go back to the new table and take the order and write it down. Don't memorize it unless you are very experienced.

9. Put the apps in if applicable.

10. Take a spin through your section and see if people need anything.

11. If you see what appears to be finished dishes, say ""May I take this? or May I take your plate?
Don't make a big insecure fuss (Like the busboy does)

12. Bring whatever the freak any table that doesn't have their food yet needs, like chopsticks, soy sauce, sugar, ketchup, napkins, knives, whatever is necessary so that when you put food down, the customer can eat or drink it without waiting for the incompetent waiter to bring it.

13. DON'T MAKE PEOPLE WAIT TO EAT ONCE YOU'VE BROUGHT THEIR FOOD. Have everything they need already on the table.

14. Bring people apps THEN entrees.

15. Refill drinks if necessary.

16. Offer desserts.

17. Bring check.

18. Dont' make people wait to pay.

19. Take the check and run the card or bring change.

20. Say freaking thank you to them.

See Kelly, it's not that hard. 
You just don't know how to do it.
Read this to the staff.

Now for the busboys or girls.
1. Constantly cruise the sections and take away empty or dirty dishes.
2. Refill waters.
3. Say to people ""May I take your plate?""  You don't have to use hand gestures and wave your hand all over the table.  Be discreet, people go out to dinner to enjoy themselves, not involve you.
4. It's not that hard.

You should have one big staff meeting and clear this up immediately upon reading this.

Hostesses:
1. Stand at the podium with a smile on your face.
2. Say hello or good morning/afternoon/evening to guests.
3. Ask how many and seat them with a smile.
4. Stay off your phone, don't smoke, and keep smiling.
5. Look people in the eye.

There you're welcome.
Good luck now and stop making excuses for yourself.

1879139,2018-05-04,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Oh the disappointment...oh the disappointment.  The wifey and I visited Vegas on a corporate retreat and decided to take a break from The Strip and headed to Downtown Vegas to grab a much-needed vegan bite from Vegenation.  The litany of 4-5 star Yelp reviews for this restaurant led us here.

For appetizers, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower.  It was spicy, saucy...and pretty good overall.  The vegan ranch that was served with it however was a little too thin to really use as a dipping sauce and it lacked flavor, but the cauliflower itself had great flavor.

For the main dish, I ordered the gnocchi chicken pot pie and the wifey ordered the mole chicken.  I actually ordered the pot pie per the recommendation of fellow Yelpers and was uber excited to try it.  The pot pie itself is more like a thick, creamy soup than an actual pie (there is no pie crust).  It looked promising...and once I bit into it...I tasted...well...nothing.  It was extremely bland...lacking in really any flavor whatsoever.  It literally tasted like it didn't have any salt in it...nor pepper...nor any other herb or seasoning.  I saw that a few other Yelpers mentioned this...but it was such a small contingent that I shook it off as random occurrence...until I ate my food.  I even swapped out my pot pie for the sweet potato and black bean quesadillas (per the waitress' recommendation)...and it was equally bland.  The only thing on the plate that had any flavor was the tiny ration of guacamole that came on the side with it.

My wife's mole chicken was also nearly flavorless.  It had just a subtle hint of chocolate in the mole sauce, had no spice, and had little other flavors.  It was also extremely bland.  Significantly worse than any mole sauce you'd find at even the most haphazard and dilapidated of Mexican joints in the grimiest of back alleys across the country.  

We both checked-in on Yelp and were each able to get a smoothie.  I ordered the chocolate peanut butter smoothie and my wife ordered a green smoothie.  I liked my smoothie, but my wife did not enjoy her green smoothie.

On a more positive note, the decor of the restaurant was really cool.  Lots of faux foliage on the walls with cool artwork.  The ambience was great, but the food itself...didn't deliver in the least bit.

I really wanted this place to be as good as advertised on Yelp by fellow Yelpers...but it just wasn't.  All the potential was there with the trendy decor, great plate presentation, and expansive menu...but...the flavor was completely vacant.

We read about another place called The Modern Vegan designed for more brunch-oriented vegan dishes...but we chose this place instead.  The Modern Vegan may be worth visiting instead.",DwLP7uMTzvCTifuh-oU1tA,1,0,2,eikM-pQZgXMjJ58EeeYGnQ

1977021,2015-05-16,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Ok, brief review. Dumplings were great--dipping sauce was a tad salty, but palatable. The pizza was my least favorite--the marinara had the consistency and tart acidity of tomato paste and did nothing to accent the flavor of the mushrooms or herbs, which were masked. The Daiya was uneeded and wasn't really tastable anyway. The crust was great and I'd love to have them work out something better for this. I saved the DN sub for later and enjoyed the meatballs. I concur about the lack of sauce--and the same criticism applies regarding flavor. The Pho-King-Delicious was flavorful and fresh. The Chocolate Tacos are great in theory, but the flavors could use some balance--the salt overpowered the sweet. I hope this place strives to improve.

The place is decorated as if you are outside sitting at a park, larger and more tables than other places Downtown. The place is located in Downtown so parking can be tricky, we were lucky and got there when it wasn't crazy busy so got Parking at the next street and walked right over. 

We were seated and greeted immediately. I tried their lemonade with coconut water... I like it. Something different and definitely more healthy. Their hibiscus tea is also very good, very strong in flavors. The mango tea was very bland.. Could not taste the mango at all! We started out with Save the Tuna and My Little Dumplings, both were very good. Save the Tuna tasted like eating sushi... But even healthier. The sauce that came with My Little Dumplings was so delicious... I drowned my dumplings in that sauce... Tasted like soy sauce but sweeter .. Must try! 

I got the Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi... But was ok. The sauce tasted like some kind of sweet potato pur√©e ... Good but not my favorite. The spaghetti that my friend got was pretty good... The texture of the meatballs was just like meatballs ... But you can smell and taste the mushroom that they used. My other friend got the portobello sliders and really liked it.

Got several dishes to split. The pizza was okay; some of our crust was burnt, so that wasn't that appetizing. The African stew needed a little salt to really bring out all of the flavors, and it wasn't spicy at all (which was disappointing because it was advertised as spicy). The burger was suuuuper mushy. Each time you take a bite, it would come mushing out the other side. It needed a more solid texture and toppings on the burger itself to make the overall texture of the burger not just a big blob of mush. The potato wedges that came with the burger had no flavor whatsoever, so I'm glad it came with some ketchup (but really needed more ketchup than was provided, given the lack of flavor with the burger and the potatoes).

Our server was decent, she seemed to be in such a hurry which was so uncomfortable because she made us feel rushed yet when we needed her after we put in our order, she was nowhere to be found so we had to wait until our food arrived to let them know we needed our server since we wanted our free ""check in"" Sangria, which was horrible. They must of used the cheapest alcohol because it was gross and tasted like nothing but alcohol. 

Our food looked great but lacked flavor. I ordered the East West Tacos. Do not order them! They are extremely sweet, so sweet that I could not even finish one taco. I only ate the tops which were fresh coleslaw and guacamole. The jackfruit was drenched in bbq sauce and it was not a good mix. The tortilla did not taste good and seemed cold, like they didn't heat up the tortilla all the way. My sister ordered their Picante Pineapple Pizza, she said she liked it but the from what I tasted, the flavors were okay but didn't come together well. My mom ordered the Vegenation Burger and said it was good, my daughter ordered the kids Spaghetti & Meatballs and the pasta and sauce was good but the meat balls weren't that good. 

What was good was their Coconut Chia Seed Lemonade & the Hibiscus Water.

Overall, customer service, the price you pay for the food & having to pay for parking, not even worth it for me.",RhU4n9Ow5PPF1bHHTx8lIQ,2,1,2,7794McRK6IwIgpnrqeZctA

-Downtown Toy: delish! Could have used more spicy aioli sauce though
-Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi - definitely FULL of flavor, &don't be fooled .. it IS vegan

-Brownie Sundae- YES YES YES. SOO good!!!

Awesome server, thank you David for being patient with us, as it was our first time! We appreciate the recommendations!! Also, one thing I always notice is the waters (I know, I'm weird.) They always kept them full - thank you!

CONS:

Nothing MAJOR, however their complimentary ""Monday night drink"" was terrible. Didn't even drink it even though it was free - sorry. And the ketchup - I'm a huge ketchup girl especially on my fries &although it's nice that they make it in-house, I'd rather they didn't.

2195941,2017-12-25,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"First time at VegeNation and I am a fan. Been to a few Vegan spots around the country and I am always curious on their take of the classics.

I) Food: 
Went with a friend and we split 1) the Chicken and waffle sandwich and 2) french toast and 3) got the peruvian coffee. The food was better than expected and both dishes are a must try. 
1)The waffle sandwich was flavorful and hearty. The textures were spot on. I must admit I'm very much a meat and veggies person and strongly texture oriented. The dish met all my expectations and I didn't miss the lack of meat.
2) The french toast was spot on as well. Crunchy outside, soft warm inside. They were vegan cream cheese filled and the perfect touch. The dish was not dry which is usually the case in vegan dishes as they don't include butter or dairy which are used to give that 'fluffy airy' texture. The dish came with syrup but I barely needed any. I preferred the taste as is and it was sufficiently sweet and I didn't need more.
3) The coffee was a pleasant surprise. French press, nothing extraordinary except that it was ginormous! The mug was larger than my head and easily served 2-3. The added touch was that the server provided fresh nut milk. The coffee black as well as with the fresh nut milk was a perfect compliment to the other dishes.

II) Service:
The service was friendly, attentive yet not overbearing. She provided useful suggestions (such as the fresh nut milk) and food suggestions based on a few questions which was very nice to someone unfamiliar with the menu or options.

III) Ambiance:
The decor had a bohemian modern greenhouse room vibe. Simple fixtures and seating and glasswear that felt appropriate with the concept and menu.

Overall great experience and worth making a trip out to old town las vegas for a try. Note I had gone for breakfast and can't comment on the lunch or other items but would be willing to give it another try.",n_nIpyUTQpkYM-ZK8GnKxA,0,0,5,MeEHlHZLHaXd3yGzq_5H7g

This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas. From the cool art and design (that oh-so-instagrammable plant wall), to the friendly service and amazing food, I always leave here feeling happy. 

I have brought people here from all walks of life and have yet for someone not to find something they enjoyed. The colorful save the tuna roll is a MUST! And the cauliflower wings are a close second in the appetizer/snack category. 

If the thought of vegan food makes you nervous, I would recommend  the meatball sandwich, or spaghetti and meatballs. If the thought of vegan food does not make you nervous, I would still recommend those items because the meatballs are delicious....and I know my way around balls. *cough*

The stuffed sweet potato is filling, and comforting, and my husband is a huge fan of the chicken pot pie gnocchi. 

They often have fun and creative pop-ups, especially on weekends. (Their chicken and waffles is very popular, but not my thang.) 

They offer a variety of great drink options - I love the coconut water lemonade with chia seeds, and their sangria.

The prices are quite reasonable for what you get.  The service is warm, friendly, and exceptionally zen (Note: The zen vibe seems to be a trend among veg restaurants.  Is this a thing?).

Some booze is available, and on Saturday & Sunday mornings, (spicy) Bloody Marys and mimosas may be enjoyed at the special pricing of 2 for 1.

Needless to say, he was definitely pleasantly surprised at the level of excellence! We definitely want everyone know of their awesomeness... seriously the good word of this place's wonders needs to be spread everywhere!

My husband got the East West Tacos with the jackfruit ( mock-BBQ pulled pork ) & a side of the oven baked fries. Tasty!! Our friend is on a very specific elimination diet to help weed out what's causing him some discomfort, and he was generously accommodated with a smile!  He got a bowl of brown rice and steamed (or possible saut√©ed in olive oil, can't remember) vegetables, but only the certain vegetables that he could currently consume, and a side of plain oven baked fries. He was worried it would be too much trouble for them due to his strict limitations, but they graciously assured him it would be no problem at all, putting him at ease, and filling his tummy with warm food, a much needed change up from dried hotel food and rice cakes.

We also shared the Mexican Hummus which was SUCH A refreshing change from just the standard hummus w/ chickpeas... the blackbean hummus was rockin'! We definitely are a fan!!

We finished off with the decadently fabulous fresh blueberry cheezcake dessert  (I spell it quirky like that because it's obviously not real cheese, as everything is vegan here) which was fantastic! We have a very similar dessert back in Florida at a raw/vegan place and it was just as good as our favorite place! Hubbs got the orange, ginger & tumeric smoothie to go as well.

My cousin and I went VegeNation for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived around 1:30 pm and were seated immediately. We both ordered the veggie burger, which we received less than 5 minutes after placing our orders. Had it been a cold dish, it wouldn't have bothered me as much. Was it microwaved?

I am no stranger to veggie burgers, but when the waiter set my plate in front of me I was a bit taken aback. The patty was red! I was also a little confused as to why we only received 4 french fries and a mound a ketchup. After about 3 minutes of mental preparation, i finally took a bite of the burger. It was actually decent. Not nearly as good as my favorite veggie burger from Lucille's, but it was tasty. There was a ton of flavor is the patty, and the burger was dressed with extra goodness. The consistency of the patty was off. I think the ingredient were precooked, chilled and free formed. The texture reminded me of baby food. The fries.. there weren't enough for me to to review, but I will give them an honorable mention.

The chef came out and asked us home the meal was, which was a lovely touch. The service was excellent. I would probably go back if I was with another Vegan.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,5,4,3,gzXPezT0ecm9yJUyk12-ng

I have been wanting to try this place forever and finally got a chance to go last night. There are so many interesting new places to eat popping up in hip downtown Las Vegas but Vegenation was first on my list. I went with my bf and our friend and his gf visiting from California, both of the guys are meat eaters but our friend's gf is vegan. Everyone loved this place! We ordered six different dishes so we were able to try a good variety. 

Save the tuna: vegan sushi roll with ""forbidden rice"" really tasty, I already love veggie sushi so this was a no brainer to order. I think most of the ingredients they use are seasonal/local so I think the filling of this roll changes but ours had mango, green onion, bell pepper and avocado with what I think was pumpkin pur√©e on top. 

Dumplings: these were my favorite! They are a pretty good size and are served dim sum style. I honestly think these are better than meat dumplings. Full of flavor and the skin had a great texture. Also the sauce was delicious! I'm defiantly getting two orders of these next time I go. 

Mushroom bao buns: looks like cha Sui bao at first but its shiitake and tofu! I really enjoyed these as well. Mushrooms and tofu were cooked perfectly and the bun tastes the same as any other bao bun. 

Pho: I really liked the unique flavor of the their vegan pho broth but it was pretty spicy. I like my pho a little spicy but our friends gf couldn't really handle spicy so she asked for it to be made mild. Even mild this pho still had a pretty good kick to it so if you're sensitive to spicy food I would say not to order this. 

Fruit loops salad: amazing! I was sharing with my bf and they split it into two plates without us even asking, awesome! I loved the grilled sweet potato and whatever cheese substitute they used for the salad. 

Penne pasta with vodka sauce: it's called Russian something on the menu but I can't remember. This was realllllly good. I love love love vodka sauce and this did not disappoint. Really good size portion too. 

Hibiscus tea: insane! So much flavor! They are free refills and they even give you one Togo when you leave! They also have ""juice cocktails"" alcoholic drinks made with fresh juice, I'll have to try one next time ;) 

I can't wait to come back here and try their breakfast menu along with vegan pizzas they have. Another bonus is the place is decorated super cute and the servers are very informative and friendly.",KHTCHdnjQfLx2c4d3UnPmg,3,3,5,PVdmhlF5EGFY2lgzNqfzCQ

First dish was ""Save the Tuna"" sushi rolls - I generally like to taste sushi first as is, without any soy sauce - this sushi tasted very good on its own, but with the soy sauce they were simply indistinguishable from the regular tuna roll. Wow. 
Next were Hot Tamales, which were excellent, well resembling the non-vegan version. Our last appetizer was Buffalo Cauliflower Wings - while cauliflower doesn't fully resemble chicken wings, the buffalo sauce was spot on, cauliflower florets were crunchy, overall another delicious hit.
My Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi dish was simply outstanding - full textural  
resemblance of the chicken, great flavor. 
May be the biggest surprise of the dinner for me was the dessert. Bread pudding was spot on, moist and delicious, great flavor. Chocolate brownie with scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream were just a riot - delicious, creamy, smooth - it is rare to have regular ice cream that tasty at the restaurant - never mind that this was a vegan ice cream.

Reason why we didn't give it a 5 star is because we wish the jackfruit could be a little less sweet, and maybe not broken down so much so there could be a more meaty texture to it.

My wife prefers vegetables to meat, and I have no problems eating that way.  While my frame of reference isn't incredibly broad in this regard, I loved the food and will absolutely return.

The black bean hummus appetizer was amazing - perfectly seasoned with a fire roasted jalapeno that added to the experience.  I had portobello sliders which were filling.  The sriracha aioli was really good but I could have used a little more as the whole grain rolls were quick to absorb it.  My wife enjoyed the sweet potato quesadilla (I might have snuck a piece too).

In short, everything was great.  The inside is very cool and the service was fantastic.  Don't take the 4 stars as a downgrade - it totally isn't.

Let's start with the staff, SUPER FRIENDLY and very accommodating , if we didn't like our food they'd replace it with something else and they always checked on us to make sure our drinks were full and we were happy. The food, AMAZING!!! We started off with Save The Tuna sushi, weirdly colored, but so delicious.  For our entr√©es we ordered several items and went buffet style and tried each other's food,LOL.  We had two different pizzas, one was the Picante Pineapple, it had pineapple, ""sausage"", and jalape√±os, sweet and spicy but oh so good, the other was the Ciao Margarita, tomato and basil, YUM is all I can say and the crust for both pizzas was crunchy and perfect. We ordered the Downtown Tony, mushroom sliders, they were good, but in my opinion there was to much bun and the buns were a little dry. Next was the Vegenation Burger, HUGE, it was nicely seasoned and juicy full of flavor, fries were good but didn't care for the ketchup, it was tasty but to thick like they opened a can of tomato paste and gave you a scoop.  We had the Get Over The Hemp pasta, I don't know how to describe this, it was alright but not a favorite. Finally we ordered Little Soul, not to sweet raviolis in a delicious sauce. Desserts were interesting. We ordered 4 different items, vanilla ice cream, OMG is all can say, so smooth, creamy and vanilla flavored , we had the blueberry cheesecake some in the group didn't like the texture, I thought it was fine, the flavor was amazing. We went with carrot cake, um....not popular with the group at all, being made with oats, the texture was weird, flavor was ok. Finished with the Chocolate Tacos, I LOVED THEM!!! Some weren't fans, they said they were to salty. Three little bite size tacos made from cinnamon and sugar tortillas filled with creamy chocolate goodness and a salted Carmel sauce YUM!!!!  I licked my plate clean, LOL. Drinks? Now with this place being VEAGAN don't try ordering a coke, lol. I had a lemonade with coconut and chia seeds, not to tart and very refreshing , the Mango Ceylon iced tea was good, needed a little sweetener for me though same with the Jamaican Hibiscus Punch.

I was looking forward to trying this one because of its high ratings. The food I got was pretty decent, but a little on the bland side. It could be that this only applies to the items I got, and I'd still be willing to give the other dishes a chance!
The Food Not Bombs Bowl is mostly just potatoes and the flavor is a little lacking - 3/5
The Bao Wow has pretty well seasoned tofu and mushrooms - 3.5/5
The Brownie Sundae has 2 scoops of ice cream that aren't too bad. The brownie is very much a dark chocolate-y bitter-y flavor which i liked, especially since the ice cream is sweet. And the toppings are good - 3.5/5
The Carrot Cake is not what I expected. I think it's completely raw, so the texture is very much like cold mush - 1.5/5",5_LAWjdcggYTGWSx8OlRfg,0,0,3,mLD1o2Z51ZId-ZCovjOo5Q

The chef also treated us with some date & cacao truffles which were great.

We started with Hot Tamale (Organic Masa, Pumpkin Green chilis and Lentils) which were creamy/firm in texture and spicy in flavor.  All of us enjoyed them.  Next were two pizza's 
Mushroom Madness (Assorted Mushrooms & Herbs) and Picante Pineapple (Charred Pineapples & Jalape√±os) and two orders of Ellen Degeneres (Raw Power Tacos Collard Green Wraps).  We ate ""family style"" trying everything and conclusively agreed everything was delicious.  

Mushroom Madness:  Very mushroomy flavor, the cheese-no-cheese looks and taste like cheese.  The tomato sauce is where most of the flavor seems to explode from.  A nice, balanced flavored pizza that I would order again.

Picante Pinapple: Wow, the spice here has a kick.  It may have been a bit much for me as I couldn't taste anything else in here.  I would order it again because I'm intrigued by spicy foods.

Ellen Degeneres Taco: My favorite.  I'm always full after this plate but I'm getting better at leaving one for later so I can have room for desert!

Carrot Cake  (Raw Cashew Lemon Frosting)- Someone once made this for my birthday cake and I've wanted more ever since.   For the work involved in doing this recipe at home, $7 is a bargain to come here and enjoy it.  I'll order this again and again!

Blueberry Cheese Cake (Walnut Crust, Organic Blueberries)- Nothing bad about this choice.  The blueberry reduction on top probably carried the whole desert more than the rest as stand alone.

No big deal if the server mentioned it.
I also ordered a serving of rice.  And 
cheesecake with blueberries for dessert.
Well, the veggies were overcooked and almost swimming in oil.  The rice portion was fine.  Cheesecake was just okay.
I found the server aggressive in asking for the payment.  Card or do you need change?  When I gave her cash, again, do you need change?  Hey, why don't you just give me my change and I'll tip you accordingly!  I definitely will not be back. Food was not pleasing, service was pushy, and there must have been some gluten somewhere.

Well I've had this place bookmarked for a long while and finally had the chance to eat here today. My bf and I started with the Bao Wow which was probably the only thing that was good. We also ordered the Vegenation burger and the Russian standard. Presentation at first glance looked beautiful. But, once you start to examine everything, you can already tell it was not going to be good. First off, pasta is extremely extremely over cooked. It was mushy! It was like they used old pasta from last night. They also added waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many capers which overpowered the entire dish. That was extremely disappointing. For the burger, the patty wasn't even fully formed. Everything just fell apart. I literally had to eat my burger with a fork and knife. But It felt like I was eating old beans I didn't get any hints of mushroom or any other flavors. Everything is underseasoned and overseasoned at the same time. I don't know how that is possible.

The lasagna -- a nightly special available during our visit -- was plenty savory with a sauce that had decent depth and ample acidity. The lone letdown was their ""Italian dumpling"" sweet potato pecan ravioli that skewed too sweet for its own good. Dishes take interesting approaches to make them vegetarian and often they succeed, but that ravioli was a miss. They even have vegetarian drinks. The lemongrass pina colada was refreshing, but was so sweet that it could have doubled as dessert.

Chef Donald and his team are spearheading a movement full of flavor, quality ingredients, local sourcing, nutritious offerings, caring, artistry and authenticity. And full of value, especially given the moderate prices.

Last night's appetizers included the Save the Tuna, Bao Wow, the Mexican Hummus, My Little Dumpling, and Hot Tamale. While my personal favorites were the Hot Tamale [great, flavorful masa with a symphony of spices] and the Mexican hummus [hearty comfort food, complete with a roasted jalape√±o on the side], every selection was gorgeous in presentation, bursting with wonderful ingredients and thoroughly satisfying. 

No buyer's remorse here! Try any menu item and you will want to return to try ALL the others!!

While I was fortunate to sample all the appetizers, they were so satisfying and filling that I did not have much room for an entree. But, in the ""community's interest."" I determined to try an entree in order to share my thoughts with others. :)

Especially since every entree served to the other diners looked so tempting, I took my time before deciding upon the Out of Africa yam stew. Turned out to be a wonderful choice of hearty, wholesome deliciousness. I am not one to snap & dine, so I will encourage everyone to SEE for themselves how gorgeous & colorful this dish is, how ample the portions are, how comforting & appealing it is. It was simply a wonderful dish. I heartily recommend it; it is now a go to, must have dish for me to seek out on a regular basis. 

Other reviewers will be sure to post ample photos and many others will be available on the VegeNation Facebook & Instagram pages. By contrast, the only photo i will supply will be of the living wall - which is in the patio at the rear of the restaurant. Because for me and for the entire Las Vegas community the little living wall portends what stunningly important contributions that VegeNation and its visionary chef and team will make toward the resiliency, health, sustainability & nutritional understanding of everyone who walks through the front of VegeNation.

VegeNation is not only feeding stomachs, it is nurturing the soul and, simultaneously, educating the minds of of its clientele. It is not serving meals, it truly is spearheading a movement that will transform lives. Seriously. 

This is not just an experiment in the vegan lifestyle for all its diners - it is the unfolding of a visionary chef's dream to share his own voyage of using his extraordinary knowledge of nutrition and the ""alchemy"" of cooking to transform his own life and thereby place his bout with cancer into remission. VegeNation truly is the culmination of decades of Chef Donald's dedication to living life to its fullest & in his sharing what he has learned and achieved with the world.

Chef Donald & his handpicked team have created a community center on sustainable eating, local production & resiliency.

And the not simple living green wall in the rear of the patio of VegeNation portends much, much more to come.

To be continued.

Food was just Meh. We were pretty underwhelmed, which was disappointing because we really looked forward to eating here because they have a great mission and seem to be one of the first all vegan spots in town. As one of the highest rated and most recommended vegan restaurants in LV, we expected more. 

 We went on a Friday for lunch. It was not busy but service was super slow. The food was just okay. We shared the buffalo cauliflower wings, and I had the veggie burger and my husband ordered the meatball grinder. Nothing to write home about and definitely not the best meal we had on our trip.

Beverage. 
My orange smoothy was a great aparatif and dessert. Added their protein boost.

Appetizer: not so tuna sushi. Very tasty using the wild purple rice. Placed over a white sauce with toasted sesame. The dumplings are tasty, however the skin they used is a little on the harder side. The cauliflower buffalo wings are excellent! 

Entrees: I ordered the east west tacos. Jackfruit tacos with Korean chili paste sauce. Interesting fruity tasting taco. Not sure it's my cup of tea. If it had a tofu and jackfruit protein instead of bean and jackfruit will be good. 
I enjoyed the curries red beans and quinoa. They used a coconut based curry.  I do wish the quinoa was a little more less cooked so it will have a nutty texture

One ordered the mama Mia pasta. Tasty sauce the meat ball tastes really meaty.
Another person ordered the same thing but with their noodles was substituted with miracle noodle. The noodle resembles clear ramen noodles. One ordered the pizza and another the ""chicken""and waffles  which is delicious. Crisp!

2970627,2015-06-12,20,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Say it with me... Veg-E-Nation. Spelled with an ""E"" said with an ""A - sound"". The more you know, the better you Yelp. 

Anyway, I'm not a big fan of vegan or vegetarian restaurants. For the most part they tend to lack in the flavor department. Walking into VegeNation, the first thing you'll notice is how totes adorbs this restaurant is; live plants everywhere, funky art, and welcoming soft-spoken servers. 

I sat down and went order happy; My Little Dumplings, Mexican Hummus, The Downtown Tony, and I forget the name, but the Ravioli with green beans in a white sauce. To drink, a vodka based carrot juice cocktail. 

STARTERS:
The ""My Little Dumplings"" were fantastic. The not only did they have great texture, but also a surprising deep rich flavor. These are filled with shiitake mushrooms and spinach and wrapped in a chewy dumpling like dough. The sauce that accompanies this dish just enhances these little pockets of joy. The Mexican Hummus was very good too, but it was pretty much just spicy hummus. Solid starter plate.... moving on!

MAIN DISHES:
The Downtown Tony is made of three veggies sliders with a mushroom taking the place of the beef patty, a great order choice for the cautious veggie food eater. My, ""beef"" with these sliders, was the dry bun and lack of sauce. The bun seemed just a tad stale, which made it tough to bite through. The menu states these come with aioli, but it was almost non-existent, which made for a dry slider. I ordered a side of house ketchup for dipping and this seemed to remedy the dryness. The mushroom inside was cooked perfect and the veggies were fresh. A fresh bun and extra sauce on this and you have one bomb beefless burger. 

The Ravioli plate needed some T.L.C. - The raviolis themselves were cooked well and had great flavor, but sauce was almost flavorless. I added a little extra salt and pepper, which is huge for me, because I almost never add salt to anything. A little seasoning on this plate made the sauce ten times better. This plate is worth a try, but get salt and pepper on the side. 

My carrot/ vodka cocktail was super refreshing, but could have used just a bit more punch. I like em' strong

Great option if you're looking for something both healthy and different. I give VegeNation four out of five broccoli bushels.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,23,15,4,Re0-b8005xsNWiV8FlU7lw

Also tried one of their burgers. The burger substitute patty was like a super burnt, thin burger. Like the cheese substitute for the pizza, it's easy to find better burger substitutes in the freezer aisle. The house made ketchup was mediocre. Just get store bought stuff.

If you can get past the sloppy branding I would recommend stepping inside and trying some vegan fair. Once inside, the decor is much more trendy and colorful with a great local vibe and chilled out ambience.

3021218,2017-10-23,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"This review is very challenging for me, because I'm vegan and I REALLY want to like this place. Las Vegas is a very vegan friendly city, but when it comes to entirely vegan restaurants, we really miss the mark. I feel like there's this notion in the vegan community that we're not allowed to criticize other vegans. Due to this, we accept mediocrity and praise it unjustly. So this is an honest review from one vegan to the community, pleading that our vegan restaurants need to do much, much better. 

Vegenation is always a hit or miss for me, and I've been here about 5-6 times. The ""miss"" items are completely inedible, and the ""hit"" items are just okay. I find this to be really troubling, because I feel like whoever the chef is just doesn't care about the food they're presenting. The food is so bland and uninspired. It's really depressing because vegan food doesn't have to be that way! There's so much you can do with it. I refuse to believe that this chef is putting forth 100% of their efforts on anything they're creating. 

I am baffled that Vegenation has the audacity to buy pre-made, frozen mock meat and serve it to their guests at the prices they charge. I understand omnivore restaurants using Gardein or Beyond Meat, because I don't expect them to know how to make seitan. But vegenation is an all plant based restaurant! Why are they cutting corners like this and not making their own mock meat? Making your own lentil ""beef"" or homemade seitan is so easy and incredibly inexpensive. Omnivore restaurants spend so much time marinating, prepping, tenderizing, etc. their real meat for their dishes. What is vegenation doing with all that extra time they have in the kitchen? They don't have to worry about serving real meat. They're not making their own mock meat. Are they spending all that time cutting up vegetables and making sauces? It just doesn't make any sense to me. Their dishes are all glorified frozen food. 

Now this is where I get nit picky about specific dishes I've tried. The cauliflower wings are horrible. Cauliflower wings should be completely cooked and soft so that it is stringy like.... chicken! (shocker) Vegenation does what so many other restaurants do when they jump on the cauliflower bandwagon. They don't understand how to properly cook it, and then it tastes like crunchy, raw cauliflower covered in buffalo sauce. Maybe some people like that, but I don't understand how that's appealing at all. The meatball sandwich uses pre-made, frozen vegan meatballs. So the sauce and cheese will burn your mouth off, while the meatballs are lukewarm. PLEASE make some dang lentil meatballs already! The chicken pot pie gnocchi is essentially the same. It's flavorless, with frozen, pre-made mock chicken and pre-made gnocchi. So they cut the vegetables for you and maybe make the sauce in house. I just don't think that should be a good enough standard for any restaurant. I could go on and on about their other dishes, but you get the idea. 

Vegenation, PLEASE set your standards higher. Las Vegas desperately needs better plant based restaurants. There is so much potential here. I will always continue to support vegan businesses and check up on this one regularly to see if things improve. But from one vegan to another, we need to encourage a better standard in our community for the people of Las Vegas.",Dk27mIM4DGNW-fX_4Ow8JQ,5,2,2,A6y6MVBJvlcEyFhc8NOesQ

So after 15 min we were seated and literally waited 20 mins for our appetizers and 30 more min for our other main courses. We got here at 2:30pm and didn't finish up until 4pm with our final meals. The quality of food is awesome, however it was not worth an hour and a half wait. I will try you guys again in a few months, I know this place is new so maybe some kinks need to be worked out.

This is just a pet peeve of mine. If you are going to a business to spend money, I don't think you should have to pay for parking. So, for VegeNation; please look into validation for parking. The menu is packed full of yummy and interesting options. We opted to share the jalapeno, sausage, and pineapple pizza and the pot sticker appetizer. I enjoyed the presentation of each of them. The potstickers came out in the bamboo steamer baskets and chopsticks. The pizza was a nice size and the combination of the sweet pineapple, savory sausage, and spicy jalapenos were spot on. I would have liked parm on the side of the pizza, but that was not offered. It's hard to find good, let alone great vegan pizza and this was one of the best. Neither of us could resist finishing the meal with one of their sundaes, and this would be a non negotiable if you're ordering from here. I got the peanut butter and jelly sundae; homemade peanut butter ice cream topped with fresh blueberry compote. This was good, and would have been amazing had I not tried my husband's brownie sundae. This was topped with fresh strawberries and what tasted like crumbled up Heath bar. Plus the chocolate brownie was more decadent than the blondie mine was served with. Overall a must stop if in Vegas and we will be back again. Oh....and do not forget to check in on Yelp and get your free Sangria.

3057304,2018-05-28,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"My friend and I just dined here. Having had amazing vegan food in San Diego, San Francisco, New York, and South FL, I was excited to try what seemed like an amazing vegan restaurant in Las Vegas. I don't understand all the good reviews. I don't like to leave bad reviews, but for people coming with high vegan standards, I felt compelled to.

So let's get this going. We started with the buffalo cauliflower wings, which was probably the best thing we ordered from the menu. Having said that, the cauliflower was not fried enough and cut in far too big chunks to be able to really crisp up. It was good because they drowned it in buffalo sauce, but not fried well. For anyone who needs their cruciferous veggies cooked well to digest it better, please pass on these.

I had the East West Tacos, which I was excited for, but it was not very spicy and more sweet than spicy, so flavor was very off. The jackfruit was also incredibly watery, soaking my tortilla and everything just fell apart after the first bite. I didn't finish it. The meal gave me a weird feeling in my stomach.

My friend ordered the Vegenation burger. It came with about four potato wedges. The burger was better than my taco, but the flavor was meh. Nothing to rave about. It needed more flavor. The potato wedges were kind of raw. I took a bite of one, and it kind of snapped. They were hard.

I hope maybe we came on an off day, but when seeing other lower-rated reviews, they had the same complaints as me.

I will say, however, the prices were very reasonably priced, and the service our waitress gave us was great. The decor was nice (casual/trendy), but unfortunately, I don't go out to eat at restaurants for the decor...",yGh6LxgmmKTcyYBne3BSRQ,0,0,2,q0I73ixY1jRyfioVubP_Gg

We placed a to-go order since we didn't have time to sit and enjoy. From my brief moment inside, the decor and the place seemed pretty nice. 

I had a sweet potato and black bean quesadilla and their tamale. I was blown away by how good the quesadilla was and asked myself who thought of this masterpiece? The tamale was okay, probably would have been much better had I ate it in fresh out of the pot at the restaurant. 

My wife had the dumplings and she loved them. They too, however, would have been even better had we eaten them there. 

My advice, give it a shot if you're a vegan and want a variety of foods. But most importantly, if you really want to enjoy, EAT IT THERE! Do not expect greatness trying to eat it at your hotel lol",P594zklGmGJrzEDMUj671A,0,0,5,z-iJqpVZQWH1nCK9EEQ_Qg

Service: Reasonable
Yes, it was quite busy when I entered, but we were still served with a smile and prompt service. All of our questions regarding the menu items were answered promptly.

Vegetarian Chicken and Waffles? Count me in! The food tasted just like chicken and the waffles were amazing! The utilization of ingredients and how each item on your place complimented the next made a great dish served.

We hadn't been eating well because we were on a road trip and sometimes it's very hard to find vegan places on the road. We were excited to try this place out since it had amazing reviews and upon entering- super cute. 

Now I've eaten at quite a few vegan restaurants in the Bay Area and had splendid experiences with them. However there weren't a lot of items on VegeNation's menu that looked appetizing. We opted for a couple recommended dishes and I ordered a salad. I did not enjoy any of the dishes we tried. =(!! Of course my boyfriend was like... it's hard to judge their main courses since I ordered a salad. BUT! I've had plenty of salads that blew me away and I went WOW that's a good salad. This restaurant did not do that for me. I thought it was bland and their toppings were eh. 

When in Vegas, I will not return here to eat. There's another vegan restaurant in walking proximity to VegeNation that I liked better.",2VsmF97uT8Pflgv4o2dNjQ,3,2,2,WKsGeAgdAojwPrWvuBSp3A

Craving a brownie Sunday, we came here excited to enjoy some ice cream and chocolate. After we were seated, it took about 10 mins before anyone else acknowledged we were there. While seated in the middle, we met our server and we decided to immediately place our orders...we were ready, 2 Sunday's please!

After 20 mins, we started noticing other people getting their food who were seated after us. Maybe those dishes were super easy to get together? Maybe it was super busy? No. Another 5 mins come by and a person in our trio received her steamed dumplings...no sign of the brownie order.

Aha! Finally roll in our Sunday's, just as we were about to ask about them. The waitress set them down and walked away...but something didn't look right! 

Bowl 1: Hardly had ingredients inside, the bowl wasn't 1/2 full. The banana's were extremely thin and very very small, a spoonful size. The abundance of strawberries were adamant and sprinkled with walnuts/shredded coconut. To me it looked sad!
Bowl 2: Filled to the top with ice cream and the same duo slivers of banana within the melted mess. No strawberries, no walnuts, a little bit of coconut...it's as if this bowl had been left out while we were waiting and completely melted! 

I finally seen the waitress again to tell her this didn't look right. She insisted this was the correct order and that she ""told them many times to remake it in the back and they refused...so.."" Then shrugged her shoulders and put her hands in the air as if to suggest 'I don't know', then walked away. 

I physically took the melting pot and brought it over to her and said: ""Look, we're not gonna eat a bowl of melted ice cream. This doesn't even have a brownie underneath..can you just take it back and ask they remake it?"". Again, she told me they wouldn't and she'd comp the meal. She seemed frustrated with the kitchens behavior already. I left the bowl with her and shared the small Sunday waiting at the table...but wait! I needed a spoon!!

After flagging down someone, anyone who would look up, I asked for a spoon to eat the Sundae, and was given a Won Ton soup spoon to eat with while my friend had a regular spoon utensil!!!!!

You get this automatic care free vibe once you enter and its a great place to just hang out and grab lunch and coffee. Their menu has a range of appetizers, dinner, dessert, shakes. The best part, is as a vegan you can get whatever off the menu and not worry about the ingredients :)

Although everything about this place is awesome, the food, the vibe, the people. They do have one flaw...BUT not big enough to stop me from ever coming back.

I want to live right above this place that's how good it was. I would literally come every day. By no means am I vegan or vegetarian, but I practice it. I'm going to practice more by coming here!!

The minute you walk in you get a very bohemian lower manhattan feel. Low music, great clientele, beautiful restaurant set up. I was greeted today but the most bubbly and personable host. I totally wish she was my server too.

My server Romario was really good. At some moments he seemed nervous but other than that he suggested great things and checked on us plenty. 

The food was AMAZE-BALLS. We had the vegan sushi with forbidden rice. Literally great tasting sushi for a great price. Plus it was a whole roll so it was good alone or to split. We also had the homemade spicy buffalo cauliflower. The sauce was good, a little too tangy but still delicious. The cauliflower was cooked well and served with a side of vegan ranch dressing.

For entrees my partner had the Gnocchi chick'n pot pie. It was delicious. The gnocchi acted as the bread/carb. So all you needed was everything else mixed together. He really enjoyed it. I had the chick'n and waffles which was literally better than any chicken and waffles I've ever had. The sauce on this was a mix of mayo, syrup and jalape√±os. All together fantastic combo. 

I wish I wasn't so full that I coulda slid dessert in, but hey there is always next time ;)

It was my 3rd time here and made it in just when the restaurant cleared out of its busy crowd this afternoon  . It was an annoying experience from the start. I'm not in the mood to get too far into detail but I will have to. our server was very forgetful and I wish I knew her name but I didn't ask as I was in a hurry to leave the place after my husband and I waited more than hour for our food that never got made!! The server had the nerve to lie to our face about some BS receipt not being printed so our food never got made which was an obvious lie. The big group of people who were seated next to us got their food first and they got there about 15 min after we did. Aside from that she never checked if we needed our drinks refreshed and she was busy interacting with other guests. I felt embarrassed for the lie she told us and when she said the food would now be getting started I said we were leaving! I was so upset because I was looking forward to going there with my husband who has been embracing a vegan lifestyle with me and for this to be his first experience I was highly upset. My husband and I left without bringing it to the managers attention because we just wanted to leave. It was ridiculous absolutely no excuse for why she forgot our order. It was not busy at that point and everyone who got there around the time we did all got there big orders just fine.  If our server had apologized and admitted to her mistake I wouldn't have left with such a bitter feeling about the over all restaurant. I will not return after today's experience. Not even for the food. Honestly the food is decent nothing mind blowing but decent and cool that there's a vegan restaurant not too far from me but I learned my lesson. Just stick to where I know I will be acknowledged, treated fairly, and not be forgotten. I hate when people mess with my food and money.  My previous experiences were really pleasant . I went at night the other 2 times. No problem with the service I even looked passed the dirty menus and dirty seating because the service was awesome. Unfortunately today's experience was enough to turn me off completely.  I'm also extra annoyed  because I have close friends who are good friends with the owner and manager there.

Despite the fact that they were supposed to be serving Sunday Brunch....they did have a ""POP UP"" option of Chicken and Waffles. We decided to go with that and I have to tell you it was simply the best VEGAN Chicken and Waffles I have EVER had.

We had hot sauce.....ketchup.....and maple syrup to go with our meal not to mention if you check in on YELP you received a free spiked Apple Cider. 

Now be advised you may need a little salt with your potato wedges.....they served us this awesome pink salt and speaking of being served our waiter was AWESOME. There is literally no FREE Parking in downtown Las Vegas.....so you have to pay 2 bucks for an hour of parking if you want to eat at this establishnment.

The Dessert (Sundaes) The ice cream that they use is awesome!! So creamy and flavorful. It was a huge portion and I think fit the price!

I'm actually AMAZED this place has so many good reviews. Like...HOW?!? Could it be the tourists who are distracted by the atmosphere? Could it be the hipsters that are distracted by all the ""hype""? Who knows. But as for me, it's quite annoying to go to a restaurant that is all about the ""facade"" & not quality food. Perhaps I'm just spoiled being with a chef and all, but my god my 10 year old cousin could've prepared a tastier meal! I can't even trust yelp reviews anymore cause people have absolutely no idea what good food is!! ?
I ordered the ""Food not bombs bowl"" (since the sever said it's ""larger"" & more ""flavorful"" than the burrito I thought about getting). My bf ordered the ""Stuffed French toast"". Btw, we actually wanted to order the biscuits & gravy and the waffles but they were apparently ""sold out"". Um, seriously??? He was disappointed before he even tasted it because of the presentation. He thought it was a kids meal. (And yes, it was VERY small for the price!) His fruit was also not fresh. He thought the French toast was mediocre. And no - it's not ""stuffed"" like the menu says. It's just jam spread between two pieces of bread.  No offense but ihop & Denny's has WAY better looking French toast. (AND NO WE DO NOT EAT AT IHOP OR DENNY'S just giving an accurate comparison!)

As for mine, after one bite I knew I couldn't finish the rest. For starters, the tortillas looked, felt & tasted stale. They were not warm whatsoever!  It comes with black bean chili, scrambled tofu, spiced potatoes, vegan cheese, & avocado with chipotle cream. Sounds pretty effin' amazing, right?! ..WRONG!  Sadly, the only warm part of my meal were the potatoes at the very bottom. The meal actually consisted of 99% potatoes & beans. And it was totally TASTELESS! I just think if you're going to pay $11 for a meal at the very LEAST it should be fresh & hot. ?

I REALLY wanted to like this place! I do love the ambience & decor. I love seeing vegan restaurants & especially successful ones! However, as a paying customer & passionate foodie I just don't appreciate getting ripped off. Luckily, they get TONS of traffic in there that love the hype no matter what their food tastes like. But if you actually appreciate fresh, hot, filling, savory meals & getting what you PAY for.. I would skip this one.",OJKwPoOghX_MDdtfOAWZzQ,3,2,1,rtFOQ7OmpFN_z30M4oNbVg

Then moments after met a waitress (I forgot her name she was wonderful) that gave us details of the specials without us even asking. She made us feel very comfortable gave us great suggestions and even educated us on the ingredients of the food.

No judging .... we started with the buffalo cauliflower wings and tamale they were so tasty and fresh. Next my cousin had the pineapple picante pizza which was good but could have been even better if the crust weren't too burnt. I had the meatball grinder the bread was a little hard around the edges but let me tell you the sauce and cheeses and meatballs were perfect!!

I'm not vegan but I've been to many vegan/ vegetarian restaurants. I appreciate the art it takes to creat vegan options since there's a lot of ingredients to substitute in the everyday meals most of us eat. 

The ambience is beautiful, I love the plants and arts on the walls. The rustic/ modern design is nice, there was a live Dj which really put the beginning experience over the top. We walked in and was quickly seated. Our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink, we gave her our order and off she went. To be honest it took a good 10 15 minutes just to get drinks which was a iced chai and an iced coffee. The long wait didn't really bother us since we were catching up but after awhile it became ridiculous. There were parties that came in after us that got their food before we could order. I kept having to catch our waitress attention just to get her to help us. I'm not sure if she forgot about us because we were somewhat in the corner but the place wasn't busy to not see us. It was about 30 minutes of us sitting there until we got to place our order. Then it took about another half an hour for us to get our food. I ordered the Free the tuna appetizer and meatball sandwich and my sister got the Vegenation sandwich. With the time it took to get our food I expected a lot more. My bread was soggy and the food wasn't even warm it was colder then what I would expect and the fries where so burnt and hard I couldn't it break it in half with my hands. My sisters burger was so mushy that she had to eat it with a fork and her fries weren't better then mine. So sad. I asked for our check and my free Sunday with the Yelp check in. I requested it to go because to be honest I didn't want to have to wait an hour for it. By the time we got our check and was able to pay for our meal we had to rush back to our meatier since the two hours that we added had already expired before we could go on our marry way to the container park. 

So with this devastating experience I won't recommend my fellow vegan and vegetarian friends nor will I be back. There's better restaurants with food that doesn't taste like it's been sitting there and service that actually feels like they want your business.",K8j3LpYqWTeRPNkemMtqnQ,2,0,3,OMFBqO5Xq8ZMg59VVinV1g

Save the Tuna - Fish-less sushi roll! It was huge, with lots of fillings, you don't even miss the fish.
Hot Tamale - Two delicious tamales!
My Little Dumpling - Five steamed dumplings in a circle bamboo steamer, with a dipping sause
East West Tacos - Three Korean BBQ flavor Tacos. They were huge! I think this was my second favorite out of the five items I got.

I was worried that, being that I was the only Vegan in my group, I wouldn't have any food options. But thankfully, yelp listed several options near the hotel we were staying in. First of all, this place is so quaint, located downtown in an area that is similar to ""Eat The Streets"". Parking was conveniently located in front of the restaurant. There was additional parking behind the building as well. The sign on the building made it easily visible and I loved the bright colors of the sign as well. Upon entering, the hostess was pleasant and immediately welcoming. The environment in general was so cute, warm, and bright with beautiful decor on the walls and tables. Loved the wooden type tables and the overall cleanliness of the dining area. The hostess offered a menu and quickly explained my options based on what I was craving. The menu was simple, back and front, thoughtfully separated into sections of breakfast, lunch, smoothies, dessert, etc. It also provided the ingredients in each meal or drink, which made it easy to choose from. I ordered the Super Food porridge with fresh fruit. That was AMAZING and very fulfilling. I actually couldn't eat all of it but I was able to save it for later. I also got the Chocolate Thunder which was a delicious smoothie and the Orange Burst. Both of these were fulfilling and was able to satisfy my sweet tooth for our long drive to Primm. But my most favorite were the Save the Tuna, Hot Tamale, and Black Bean Chili Stuffed Sweet Potato! I honestly couldn't believe how tasty these entrees were and all very good portion size. I got the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings. These were good but just a little too spicy for me. Prices are slightly higher than expected but worth every penny!

I'm the only vegan in my family, but they all love coming here with me. Sometimes I hear them say ""Hey, what's the popup item today at Vegenation?""

You HAVE TO try Save The Tuna sushi, Sweet Potato Quesadilla, Downtown Tony sliders, Food Not Bombs Bowl and when available Chick'n and Waffles. Sure taste buds pleasers for anyone! As far as dessert, Brownie Sundae is the winner for me as it comes with delicious vegan ice cream. Hubby loves the bread pudding. He also loves their coffee and the iced tea. Their lemonade is the best lemonade in the world! With coconut water and chia seeds. 

They often have live music and little events going on. What is important to note is that the restaurant is involved in wonderful local groups that promote awesome things like gardening classes in local schools.

3602299,2017-05-25,2,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I have to agree with Kevin L. (below). This place, albeit filled with positive vegan vibes, is really a miss on the food. Like Kevin, I am currently a carnivore, but I do like my vegetables. And I was a vegan (raw food vegan, mind you), for 2 years...many moons ago. I have enjoyed scrumptious vegan fare on the East Coast, particularly in Brooklyn, New York. So, when a fellow former New Yorker invited me here, I had high hopes. But frankly, they were dashed (hard) to the ground. 

But let's start with the positive first. It's a swanky, hip, big city feel, intellectual dive. That's an unique ambience for Las Vegas, especially for downtown. The scene is a quiet sanctuary. The waitress was sweet and wholesome. If I had just come for a cup of coffee, I would give it 5 stars.

But I didn't come just for coffee, but for lunch, and it was surprisingly bland and somewhat sloppily executed. First, the menu items (as Kevin complained of) were odd. There appeared to be ""meat"" on the menu, and I was worried at first if I had actually come to a vegan restaurant. Then, I realized that these were faux meat options, called ""meat"" but were actually some kind of non-meat, meat substitute. Though it is clever, it is a little credibility-reducing. A true Vege-Nation should be unapologetic about its embrace of plant foods, and not try to disguise them as anything other than what they are.  When I was a vegan, I never ate such fake foods.

Secondly, the menu seems a bit disjointed. There is no unifying structure or sense to what is offered, and it is hard to navigate, despite being large in its offerings. Then, as said before, when the food does arrive, you feel it is missing something in flavor, and in execution. It's overcooked or undercooked, or underdressed, or perhaps overdressed. But it's missed its marks somehow.

The presentation, however, is very pretty. That and the atmosphere is what it has going for itself.  Again, that is enough for a cup of Joe, and maybe (maybe) dessert. Not more. 

I don't know why the high number of favorable reviews of this place. Some may honestly believe this is as good as it gets for vegan restaurants, probably because they are desperately lacking for them, and don't know better or, more dishonest, simply want this place to succeed as a statement. I don't know. But don't you be fooled, dear reader. Better to go with one of the many other slick, smart, and delicious hangouts downtown, and order veggies.",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,1,1,2,MzzA5tpKv3-Oz5YWAAEdgg

3617395,2016-11-21,5,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"What a different experience from what I'll just refer to as the unhealthy ""healthy"" vegan chinese food fiasco of last month.  This place, on the other hand, was a blend of fresh ingredients prepared with skill and balance.  I'm definitely a carnivore but if a herbivore dish is done right,  the meat is not missed at all.  

The night started off on the right foot with free Sangria with Yelp check-in! Nice!  :)

Our table of 3 started with an order of the Buffalo cauliflower ""wings"" and they were superb.  I'm generally not the biggest fan of cauliflower and will only eat them if they're prepared in certain ways but this dish was certainly a cut above any cauliflower dish I've ever had before.  The cauliflower was cooked 'til semi-soft then charred to get some nice caramelized edges, then tossed in a perfectly spicy buffalo wing sauce.  The dish was served with some celery sticks and a house-made ranch dipping sauce.

The three entrees that were ordered were Masaman curry, Sweet potato ravioli, and the Russian standard which is gluten free penne pasta in a vodka sauce.  I didn't taste the other two dishes but my Thai curry was delicious.  The menu said it comes with sweet potato noodles but I think mine were rice noodles instead.  It had some al-dente vegetables in it with a thai yellow curry sauce.  The dish was really flavorful and the portion was perfect.

My friends said their dishes were great as well, they both have been here numerous times so know how good this place is.  

The place is a bit on the small side with seating for about 50 maybe and has a cool trendy vibe.  I definitely like the music they were playing which ranged from The Cure to the Ramones, The Jim Carrol Band and Social D.  Very cool.  This area of downtown has some really good restaurants opening up and this place is a great part of that resurgence.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,4,7,4,IrhYDpfERBbpZyg7o3RB2Q

The Pamela Anderson raw tacos are refreshing and healthy. Love the addition of nuts for texture. Our mini sliders were also good, however the multigrain bun a little dry which I didn't mind at all. What made a lasting impression for me and the 5 stars is their brownie sundae. That was amazing. They've brought in a new vendor who supplies amazing almond milk based ice cream, vanilla and chocolate that had the texture and taste of real ice cream. All the flavor and non the the guilt.

3618231,2016-03-29,13,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"If you're Vegan and staying downtown, there's only a few choices to eat at. Not that there's a ton of choices on the strip either. Just so happens that both of your main downtown options are within a block or so of each other downtown.

If you love Veggie Grill type junk food like I do, then you'll thoroughly enjoy what VegeNation has to offer. We came for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on three separate days during our visit to Vegas. So you could say I'm a bit of a fan. While everything on the menu isn't a slam dunk, most everything is as delicious as it sounds.

We were overwhelmed with the menu choices during our first visit. We ended up going with a few of the most popular dishes.

VegeNation Burger: The patty was a bit soft which normally would be an instant mood killer. However with this ""super foods"" burger, it kinda works. There was so much flavor in this that I didn't even think about how soft the burger was until I was several bites deep. By then it didn't matter. This was good!

Save the Tuna: This lil' roll could compete with anything from the world famous Shojin in LA. The toothsome forbidden rice that they chose to use gets a special mention for being an actually tasty alternative to white rice.

Muchos Gracias: This chipotle flavored Quesadilla, was pretty tasty, if overpriced for what you get at $11. It's not very filling as an entree. It could also use some substance inside that adds extra bite to it to keep it from being too mushy. It had great flavor though and I would order it again if it were a few dollars less.

East West Taco: Despite the apparent popularity of this, I wasn't a fan. It had a good fusion of flavors but nothing really stood out. It was also missing some much needed crunch.

French Toast: Delicious, well done with a flavorful almond butter spread on the side. This one didn't need any maple syrup to taste great. The fruit cup it comes with doesn't make you forget that there's only 3 half slices of French toast here. As my babygirl asked me, what the hell do they do with the other half a slice? It's worth noting that @ $11, for a few bucks more you get much thicker Texas toast over at the Wynn. And yes, there's 4 slices on your plate there.

Chicken & Waffles: While it doesn't seem to be a regular breakfast item, they have been offering it on what they call the ""pop up menu"". If it's available while you're there, get it. It's a well made, tasty, crispy waffle. The chicknon that they use is a Gardein patty that is flavorful and well seasoned. They added a side of their thick cut homefries to the dish in an attempt to make the plate less bare. However, I would rather see a side of tofu scramble or something instead.

While some of the dishes were 5 stars, there were some that fell somewhere in between. Overall the food is about 4 stars. Service is what takes VegeNation to the next level. Our waiter on the first day was phenomenal. He stood out from a rotating cast of other fine service staff. 

Despite eating here 3 days in a row, I can't wait to go back! That's a testament to my love of their food and mission statement.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,19,16,5,VpdZrxfBKkqQgYAH0cEAEw

3642713,2016-05-07,5,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"VegeNation is a great example of a vegan restaurant that has something for everyone. Whether you are an omnivore like me or a hardcore vegan, I guarantee that you will be very satisfied with their offerings.

My (vegetarian) wife and I were here recently for Sunday brunch. It had a cool ambiance that my wife thought was more ""hipster"" than ""hippie"". Maybe she meant that it was clean? We sat at the community table which really did seem to be a community of sorts. Friends and strangers chatted amiably and listened to the talented guitarist/singer (they have live music every Sunday.)

We started with a French press of Peruvian coffee. Our very nice server told us how long it had to steep for and our brew was robust but also mellow and not bitter.

We shared Save the Tuna, which was really fresh and delicious. It didn't seem like there was any mock tuna in it, but the avocado was so tasty that nothing seemed missing. If you are like me and you do enjoy raw fish, just keep in mind that this dish is not trying to be a facsimile.

I chose Daniel Negreanu for my entree, and I'm glad that I did. This was an East Coast style Italian meatball grinder, all right. If you don't like the taste or texture of meat, don't get this because the meatballs were very realistic. Our server said that they get them from a place in the Bay Area, so I doubt that they're any brand that I've heard of. The ""parmesan"" is probably not Daiya because it tasted more cheese-like (actually, I don't think Daiya makes a parmesan product.) This is a perfect example of how vegan food can be hearty and satisfying.

In fact, I shared my sandwich with my wife and I was too full to help her with her off-menu order of chicken and waffles. The tiny taste of the chick'n (or should that be ""chickun""?) that I got was pretty meaty, so be forewarned.

We checked in on Yelp and got the free brownie sundae. I didn't exactly save room for it, but I somehow devoured my fair share. I would love to know what kind of ice cream it was (rice cream? almond cream?) Wonderful!

VegeNation just made our list of must-visit places for every time that we come to Vegas. I think that two-for-one happy hour is calling our names!",rvkVh-FNvg2fYSgHjG4mkQ,7,5,5,jYlJYbXXxtLOY6A_-1FX3Q

From drinks to starters to entrees to dessert, this restaurant is able to bring out savory and scrumptious dishes without any use of animal products! 

When we walked into the cafe, we were greeted by a friendly young lady. Within 5 minutes, our table was ready (we went at 12pm on a Tuesday). Our waitress was able to give us great guidance, since it was our first visit and it really helped us in deciding which dishes to try.

Here are what we ordered: 
Drinks - we had a cup of perky portion (taste like mocha without milk, but is thickened by coconut milk) and a glass of chocolate thunder (taste like chocolate milk with chia seed) - we'll probably try something else the next time we visit, since there are so many other options available!

Starter - we had hot tamale (steamed dough with sweet potato, lentil, mole and tomatillo sauce) - this is pretty flavorful - we'll order this again when we visit next time

Entrees - we had downtown tony which is portobello mushroom sliders (comes in 3 and are around hand palm size each) with vegetable slaw and siracha aioli and served with fries - as we are mushroom lovers, this dish definitely won our hearts! The portobello mushroom in the sliders is well done and lip smacking! The siracha aioli in the sliders was not overpowering, so the sweetness of the mushroom was evident. The fries won't fantastic as they weren't crispy but we'll still order this portobello sliders again during our next visit!

Pizza - we had a spicy picante pineapple pizza - it is a little like Hawaiian pizza. The pizza is topped with pineapple, italian sausage crumble, jalape√±os and cheese. It was interesting to have cheese and Italian sausage crumble made from non-animal products, and though no animal products was used, the taste was not compromised! - we might order other interesting pizza to try and compare the next time we visit!

Dessert - how can we leave this cafe without trying out its desserts! So we didn't! We had brownie sundae which is a black bean brownie topped with caramelized banana, fresh berries and vanilla and chocolate ice creams! The black bean brownie was delicious and its sweetness was just right (not too sweet)! This dessert is yummy for a sweet tooth person like me! - I will definitely order this again to end my meal!

The CBD Tea is 5 stars!! Get the big pitcher for $6 i believe, you wont be disappointed, the tea is perfect for digestion and makes you feel great! 

Eggplant stacks are always a go to! You will never be disappointed by these, they're like lasagna eggplants, yum! 

The tamales- delish! Definitely have a good twist to them! 

The fries; (i forgot the name for them but they come with some kind of ketchup) they're okay, i would not order them again to be honest they're kinda thick and I also do not like ketchup so my opinion on this is somewhat bias! 

The pot pie dish was hearty yet could use a little more flavor! 

The sweet potato bean side; yum! definitely worth it! 

I have loved almost everything I have gotten here so do not feel afraid to try anything!! 
Love how everything is vegan and all dishes are about ($10-$12)

Everybody was super friendly and went out of their way to help if you needed anything. The vibe is great and it was a nice break from the Strip for us. 

The Cauliflower wings and ranch were the best I've ever had, and I would come back just for them. My boyfriend enjoyed his Pho, although he said it was kind of bland. Adding in some seasoning fixed that for him right away. I got the burger, and it was also a little bland. The fries were amazing, though.

3866249,2015-12-28,2,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Okay, I've been here twice now - once for lunch and once for breakfast. 
First, the decor is gorgeous. I absolutely love the set up, the decorations, the plants, the tables, everything. It's beautiful in there. Next, I love that everything is local, organic, fair trade, etc. Both servers we've had have been some of the friendliest, most enthusiastic servers I've ever had. You could tell they LOVED working there and loved the food. Unfortunately, I don't remember either of their names but the service and atmosphere are absolutely five stars worth. And very clean and lots of parking. 
But, most importantly, the FOOD.  So, I'll admit, the breakfast was just okay.   I had a chocolate bomb smoothie, I think that's what it's called and that was really flavorful and delicious. The french toast was just okay but didn't taste very french toasty, if that even makes sense. The bread that they used was incredible though. 
I also got the tofu scramble and was a little disappointed. I thought the fennel was too strong and there wasn't that much tofu. The potatoes were good. Have no idea why the corn tortillas were there, wasn't expecting that. It also came with some fruit, so there was a lot of food and it was okay but not outstanding. My biggest complaint is really just that the tofu portion was so small and a bit flavorless because all I could taste was the fennel.  I'd still come back and try some of the other dishes. It's good, solid VEGAN breakfast food made with integrity and compassion for a reasonable price and generous portions.  Oh and the coffee was really good too! We had so many cups on the counter lol. We couldn't even finish everything and the waitress gave us to-go cups which was very nice. 

Anyway, the time we came for lunch was really good.  We had sushi, the dumplings, pizza and something else but now I can't remember but this was awhile ago. Affordable, delicious, fresh and beautiful. The food is really colorful and gorgeous to eat. I wish I could say more but to be honest, I ate lunch here a few months ago and forgot but I do remember really liking everything!  

Another reviewer said that this place is still learning and I'd say that's a fair review. Like I said, this is solid, good, food but it does seem like something is just a little bit off. They're new and still perfecting everything so I'm sure it'll come together better but this is a really amazing, impressive start.",aEMadd3c9ufio64ngrDu8A,4,3,4,Iuubt4TELBdMV_xSJg6LNg

 This location is on Carson and 7th st so if you don't find a meter right out front you may have to pay to park across the street and walk on over.

4006012,2016-05-25,5,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Hip/casual lunch spot in Downtown Las Vegas. They claim to offer global, plant-based menu. I have never been to a vegan or vegetarian restaurant so it was interesting for me to see the options they had. Located next to Glutton and fairly easy to find.

Walking in, we were greeted and promptly seated by a friendly staff. I love the interior because it went well with the concept. Lots of living plant which added to the clean and refreshing vibe.

Keep in mind, I am not a vegan or vegetarian by any means so based on my diet and the things I eat on a daily basis, everything here tasted bland. I don't know if the fact that I am not a vegan/vegetarian plays a role in this but just wanted to quickly mention. 

Save the tuna ($6.95): One of the appetizer. My favorite dish out of everything. It's a vegan sushi with avocado and mango (?). Texture was similar to tuna and it was presented beautifully. Highly recommend. 5/5

Mushroom madness/picante pineapple ($10.95): They have three different pizza options and you can get half and half which is what we did. Unfortunately I did not try picante pineapple because of jalapenos and I can't handle any heat. Mushroom madness is assorted mushrooms with herbs. It was on a thin crust and I definitely did not like the tomato sauce they used. It had a weird sweetness/tanginess to it. 3/5

Chicken pot pie: Not the pot pie I expected. There was no crust or pastry bowl, it was just a chicken stew. It had a light curry flavor but overall tasted bland. For some reason stew felt grainy and I was not a fan of its flavor nor the texture. 2/5

One of those first and last visit. Nothing memorable about the visit except for their hip and cool ambiance. I don't think I will be back.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,7,3,g0CGwBvk_6byb4W-8e_sBA

I'm not a huge fan of vegan food as I love fish, chicken and cheese but I though hey let's try something new. I had the Vegan Sushi and a Mushroom Pizza. I loved the Mushroom Pizza with the exception of the crust. It was far too thin and made most of the toppings runny. Overall extremely tasty but it was slightly annoying to eat. Vegan Sushi was interesting, While I can't say I'm a huge fan but it was tasty but at the same time it could have a bit more flavor. I'm a huge fan of sushi and I really wanted this to be great. As for the staff they were kind and genuine. 

Now on to the part I hate. I get it this is geared to a certain crowd (young 20 something liberal hipsters). Please forgive for being so blunt. To be fair though there is nothing wrong with the titles I mentioned above. The main issue I have with this place is the decor and the anti meat propaganda associated with it. Another odd thing I encountered was the lack of soda on the menu. Now I don't know if this was somehow tied into you guys being a new restaurant or not. I just feel this very odd vibe that you guys are trying force healthy choices on the patrons. Let us make are own choices.

I'll start off by saying that most of the food was really good but they have a super slow kitchen. Restaurant wasn't full. 20 minutes for appetizer, another 30 for the entree. Everyone around was twiddling their thumbs. The free sangria with check-in was a nice plus while waiting...

The food:
Buffalo Cauliflower had too much sauce and could have been crispier
Bao Wow was not marinated or seasoned well. It just tasted like plain tofu with blah mushrooms. A suggestion would to have used jackfruit and cooked it down like with the flavors of a bao pork bun.
Pot pie gnocchi and pineapple pizza were awesome. 

Not sure if it's just because they are newer but their kitchen needs to make a few changes to be more efficient. Maybe the next time I'm in Vegas I'll give it another try.",jOy7IdSgtb2ZQd7F2_eLyw,0,0,3,BSyixh8Zza4lR2c1XZDivw

Turns out, I should have been more open minded about vampires.  Sorry vegans, but as an avid meat eater, I judge your cuisine harshly and perhaps unfairly.  When I found myself in this cute little restaurant to accommodate a vegan friend, I was taught the error of my ways. 

The menu is creative and everything I had was so delicious and filling. On the rare occasion that I've eaten a vegan meal, I end up unsatisfied and looking for a snack. Not the case at VegeNation! We started with the buffalo cauliflower. It was the perfect amount of heat and the house made dipping sauce (green goddess?) was a nice, cool accompaniment. For my lunch, I had the Downtown Tony. Three portobello mushroom sliders, and crispy tater wedges. Added bonus, it comes with house made curry ketchup and sriracha aioli.

Yeah, it was lunch. But when you've had a hard day, you go for that bread pudding at 2 pm. Unbelievably good, with fresh strawberries and a great texture.

We got here on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend at 7pm. Staff looked really busy, not sure if they were an employee short, and there were a good amount of tables available. It took us a second to get seated because the hostess was busy in the back grabbing and packing to go orders. There were a couple people waiting around for their to go orders. Seems to go orders are more popular than sit down. A waiter came out and said the hostess would be right with us. 

We sat down and was greeted by waiter fairly quickly but he had a good amount of tables to serve as well so ordering took a little while unless he was giving us extra time since there were the five of us. It was disappointing because everything we wanted to order, they ran out of. They ran out of all red pasta sauce and after ordering they can out of the taco shells. This tells me that nothing is made fresh but rather preprepped and warmed up and difficult to substitute because it's already pre-made. But this also tells me those dishes are probably really popular and yummy because the were sold out by 7! I really wanted to impress my omnivore friends but they looked really dissatisfied with every bite they took so we felt it would be best to take care of their meal. We ordered a variety of dishes which came out to over $100. Some dishes we got may have had some good flavor but nothing ""to die for"" and nothing terrible dissatisfying. I would give this place a try if you're vegan and or gluten free and are in the area. Unless your stomach is sensitive. All five of us were gassy after our meals. Not sure if the food is old or if the black beans weren't soaked long enough or what. I personally wouldn't come back. Sorry to say. I don't regret trying it though. They have great looking dishes, cute vibe, good drinks, and great concepts but I just didn't like that all of us ended up with mild to severe gas afterwards.",p19ZuBIruJhrrb9z5rAelw,2,1,3,E2jxrfZ30VTA4U5v4PwNFg

4132155,2015-07-03,12,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Ok I am kind of, a fan.. so far. I often do not rate a place until I have been at least a couple of times but, this review is based on a 1-time visit, and one take-out order. I had the same thing both times, as the take-out order was a surprise and happened to be the same exact thing I had - to an extent. 

Both times I had the, now famous, SAVE THE TUNA - non sushi roll. With Forbidden Rice on the outside and various fruits and vegetables on the inside. The most recent visit had mango, avocado, and perhaps a carrot puree? I would have liked an explanation of what I was eating , as the very simple description on the menu states - 'Vegan Sushi - Forbidden Rice'. Which I take to mean that the ingriedients are seasonal or daily fresh items. So that's cool.. but something like that REALLY deserves a bit of explanation When being presented. The server was all over the restaurant as I think perhaps they were on low-staff situation. I dunno.. but I couldn't get a chance to ask her what I was eating. In any even - it was sort of good.  

I also had the 'Mushroom Madness' Pizza - which I have had previously. I really like mushrooms and so that is a no brainer when I am at a loss of what to eat. This visit, I was very hungry so the server suggest that I try two types of pizza on each half. So I did that, and asked her to choose what ever else she thought would be good. She chose the 'Picante Pineapple' as the second half of the pizza. It consisted of 'charred pineapple, jalapenos, and 'sausage crumbles'. Its all vegan so it's obviously not real sausage and was remenicent of chorizo in flavor. 


The chorizo-like sausage crumbles weren't too hot on the palate, but man, did it burn my chest for the next couple of hours. So I'll skip that next time. Whatever was used to season the 'sausage', really gave me some terrible heartburn. As I said, I really liked the mushroom pizza though, and would possibly get that again. 

It was semi-filling, and I did not leave hungry.. I will say that I was a little bit dissapointed at the presentation of the sushi roll. It was a bit of a 'womp-womp' as it arrived on the table... It was colorful and good but loooked a bit deflated. I don't say that to be mean.. but you can sort of tell what I mean by the pic I posted. 

Anyway, I may go back and try other things and then go from there.. we shall see... so.. HAPPY EATING TO YOU!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,16,11,3,KBXaPsYw9gvdugMNZAybEQ

Fresh and much locally sourced ingredients, I was impressed by the inventive uses of plants posing as meat. I am a meat eater, I guess you'd say Paleo pescatarian mostly (although I occasionally eat poultry and eggs), no or very rarely dairy, no pork or beef at all. However, plants encompass most of my meals or I should say the larger percentage of my meals are plant-based, and I find the importance of eating at least five servings or more of plants a day to be vital to our health. I'm enjoying this sort of revolution towards healthier eating and reduction of processed or filler foods. 
The live plant wall with hanging Tibetan prayer flags overhead, loads of tables and one large community table lends a relaxed and inviting environment. 
Our server was really friendly, very sweet. She even wrote down the cookbooks the head chef likes for my daughter who is always wanting to try more vegan and vegetarian recipes. Bill, minus tip, for 3 plates and two drinks was $36.

4163713,2018-04-17,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"This review is almost entirely based on the service provided to us when we ate at VegeNation. 

I came in to eat with a party of four. One of the people I was with has a service dog. We put our name on the waiting list. Eventually, we are next to be seated and there was a four-top table in the front of the restaurant. It was a really beautiful day, so we were excited to get the table by the window. However, the hostess came to inform us that we have to be seated in the back area. Upon asking why, she replied that it VegeNation's policy to seat service animals outside. We specifically asked to be at the open table by the window. With attitude, she told us, no. Bewildered but starving at this point, we just agreed to go outside. Like I said, it was a nice day... It was actually my birthday. So, I didn't exactly want to get into things. 

Our server was so forgetful. She got our orders wrong for different things. We needed to remind her two or three times about the same forgotten item. It was extremely disappointing. There were also periods of time where it seemed like she disappeared - almost like she forgot to come check on us. There was also a table next to us that was full of dishes. It was left for the entire time we dined. 

There was also an employee on break or something outside on the table by us. He was sleeping or listening to music with his eyes closed. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care but it just seemed like it was the employee break room as opposed to a dining area. Later in the meal, two employees came outside to another one of the tables to do silverware, so it added to the break room feel. 

During our meal, a couple was seated outside. After a few minutes, they requested to be seated inside, and their request was honored. 

Later, we inquired again why we were forced to sit outside. Another employee said that there was a person with a dog allergy inside, so they had to seat us in the back. At this point, I'm livid. Was it a restaurant policy or because it was somehow known that someone had a dog allergy? Someone lied to us. And, on top of all that, the restaurant is NOT allowed to do this. Regardless of either reasons, it is not allowed. According to Nevada State Law, they are not allowed to force us to eat in a specific section (i.e., outside) because we had a service animal in our party. The management will be receiving a more detailed letter regarding this matter. I really hope they take this into consideration when making policies or training their employees. 

Food was okay. Nothing special. Service was horrible. It isn't very often that I leave a food establishment actually mad. This was one of them.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,1,0,1,678m2kkHPrcsLJ0HPZ9efw

I understand it's vegan food, but these are mostly standard ingredients (pasta? marinara sauce?).  I would be happy to pay these prices if their portion was just 10% larger.  Please listen to this feedback guys!  You aren't nearly as bad as the ludicrous vegan food establishments that charge an arm and a leg for two bites worth of food, but you aren't THAT far off.

Now onto the brownie sundae.  The last time it came out in a different bowl, not sure if it's smaller but it kind of looked like it.  They really need quality control here because the brownie tasted like disgusting not even half baked mush :( :(  No it wasn't the ice cream melting into the brownie... it literally tasted like it was baked for a few minutes it was wayyy too gooey.  And if the portion is indeed smaller, then boo to that too.  I know Vegenation can be great, and so many of the dishes have great flavor.

(Understandable!) after waiting for 30 minutes in line to be seated, we agreed to sit at the community table because no one else wanted to and I'm more than fine with it. For 30 minutes, I sat with my friends wondering where our waitress was because our drink order hadn't been taken yet. We then noticed multiple other people who came in AFTER us were seated with their drinks... A little annoying and frustrating but we let it go. Finally our waitress came to our table and didn't apologize for completely ignoring us and serving everyone else beverages before us even though we got there before them. After taking our drink order, she came back and asked what we ordered because she forgot. The entire time we've been understanding that it was busy but at this point, I'm frustrated and annoyed because there's not very many people left in the restaurant. Finally, she comes back with our drink order and asks what we want to eat. We order. And we wait 45 MINUTES for 3 pasta dishes. Our waitress doesn't come ONCE to apologize for the wait or to notify us how our order is coming along. So in total we waited more than an hour and a half for our meal and drink when it was no longer busy and no one came to apologize or made us feel welcomed. I'm very sad because this was one of my favorite places but the service was really bad and that pretty much ruined it for me. It would've been nice if a manager came to the table and apologized but no one seemed too worried about us. I was completely astonished by everyone else being seated after us being served before us.

To nail food, service, and decor this early is simply unheard of...but Vegenation has done it.

Everything we ate at Vegenation was the right kind of filling and popped with so much flavor. Absolutely no sacrifice. Chef Donald is a master! My husband and I indulged on a variety of dishes - the Hot Tamales appetizer (Organic Masa, Pumpkin Green chilis and Lentils) - INSANELY FLAVORFUL, for entrees Muchos Gracias (Organic Sweet Potato Quesadilla Black Beans, Chipotle Crema) - just the right amount of spicy and super filling as well as the Vegenation Burger (didn't miss the meat at all), and for desert we had the Blueberry Cheesecake. How that cheesecake was dairy free is mystifying...it was just so so good. For drinks we had lemonade with coconut water and chia and an orange burst smoothie. Everyone at Vegenation made us feel welcome, we love the use of local ingredients and community collaborations (i.e., Boulder City's Frankly Good Organic Coffee, Grassroots Juice, etc.), and it's just too cool that they are actually growing their own plants on site.

I tried this place twice while I was here in Vegas. Both visits we decided to do take out because we just wanted to relax in our hotel (it was literally less than a mile from where we were staying)

My first visit I ordered the bao buns and the chicken pot pie gnocchi. They were both fairly delicious! I didn't get to finish my gnocchi tho because my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator :( lol 

My second visit was a let down. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings, the hot tamales, and the Daniel Negreanu. My partner ordered the spicy picante pineapple pizza and the east west tacos. 
The cauliflower wings weren't bad but the hot tamale was a super disappointment tho considering how they were voted the best in Las Vegas. They were extremely dry and had very little filling. 
The Daniel Negreanu (which is meatball sub) wasn't bad but the fries were stale and they only gave me like three fries? Lol so I guess if you order something to go make sure it doesn't come with fries 
My partner's spicy picante pizza was good! Only complaint was that it was pretty small even for a personal size pizza. The east west tacos however weren't good. The sauce was extremely sweet and the tortillas were breaking apart when we tried to eat them :/ 

All in all, it isn't a bad place. It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is so friendly! Unfortunately the menu for us was a hit or miss so we're not sure we might come back next time we're in Vegas",MrhK5lMtAYOU7VVNUVnNAg,2,1,3,mXtkKWgTriYel6mOZfgQjw

So, here I am.  I'm back.  This place was highly recommended.  I went the first chance I had.

I had the steamed buns and the tamales.  

The steamed buns had some flavor, but were mostly disappointing.  Steamed buns are just about my favorite food so this was sort of heart breaking.  I wanted to love them.
But the bun itself wasn't steamed long enough and was still sticky dough on the inside.  I think it was because they were so much thicker than the usual bun.  Also, the tofu, mushrooms, and spinach did not give any textual difference.  No crunch.  I think tempeh would have been a more exciting protein on the bun.  Also, I needed more sauce.

Then, I had the tamale.  It could have been great.  
But it was far to thick.  Like, big cylinders.  The masa was a bit dried out in places.  The filling however was delicious.
I think the whole thing would have benefited from a sauce of some kid to accompany it.

Service was kind and lovely.  I was given space to enjoy and checked on without being hovered over, which is something I appreciate.

It was very hearty, with quinoa, though I have to say they missed on the Moroccan flavors and the eggplant was under cooked. We shared the chocolate tacos for dessert, which was small, but just the right bite.

4529803,2015-09-11,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Experience:  Went with my girl, who is 100% Vegan. She doesn't even eat cheese...yikes! I've seen good reviews here, so this Southern girl thought I might keep an open-minded and step out the pork zone for a bit. 

Facility: Small cafeteria feel, but hipster place located in the same strip mall as Zydeco and Glutton. Guess I won't talk about Zydeco having the best catfish and Glutton having my favorite burger in Vegas so I won't gross out the Vegetable peeps reading this. LOL!

Service:  although there were 4 wait staff walking around this small room, I can't believe how many times I attempted to waive someone over to be ignored. I was really disappointed, because when they finally did see me standing on the table with bright orange cones waiving them in, they were very nice to speak with. All of them...very pleasant dispositions.  

Food:  yeah, um...how do I say this politely...nope! Not for me. I like a good salad and I love vegetable side dishes, etc, so I thought there would be something yummy to me here. The food was just super bland. Spices are ok in the vegan menu, right?  
Now before you cast me back to my red meat roots...yes, I admit there was pork fat back in my baby bottle, but I really do love veggies. At Italian restaurants, when I order pasta, I usually only order vegetables in it. I can skip the meat...however, I can't skip out on flavor, and in my opinion they did. 
Mexican Hummus - 2/5 - did not take like hummus, rather just plain black beans. At least there was a half of a jalape√±o in there I cut up and added to each chip. 
Tamales - 2/5 - bland, bland, bland. I had to ask for salt, and then added it to the hummus too. I like the masa, the pumpkin and chiles, but it was just so boring and bland. The waitress said she likes to ask for extra chiles...doesn't that tell you something?
Ravioli - 3/5 - ok, this one was ok, but too sweet. I guess it was the sweet potatoes, but it almost seemed if they added sweetener, like honey or something. I like my pasta savory, not sweet. 

Overall:  I apologize to all the Vegans that love this place, but in my defense, even my long-time strict Vegan friend told me it was very bland and disappointing to her too. I mainly gave it a 3 instead of a 2, because the staff were so polite and nice, and even comped my tamales. However...it was just not enough for a good dinning experience. 
Im sorry, but I won't be back. :(",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,1,3,rDyyCZWyCVTuiYsc5Mvyxw

For starters we shared the vegan sushi which actually tasted very similar to regular sushi. It also was quite filling for just about 8 pieces. As an entree I went with the Muchas Gracis. It was a quesadilla filled with sweet potatoes and black beans. Strangely enough it had a cheesy taste too which was very good and the portion size was quite big and filling.

4577567,2017-11-15,4,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I am shocked...SHOCKED I TELL YOU...that I haven't yet written a review for VegeNation. My husband was working in Las Vegas for a couple of months, so I visited the city a few times. Every time, I had to come here, usually more than once. I brought a not-yet-vegan friend here and even she was blown away. For weeks, when we'd talk about getting together in LA, she'd lament, ""Why is VegeNation so...far...away...?"" I know, it hurts.

I've eaten a lot of food here, but here are some of my favorites that have stuck with me.

DANIEL NEGREANU: maybe the best meatball sub I've ever had in my life. Every time I order a sub elsewhere, it disappoints in comparison. The meatballs are amazing. I remember asking if they make them themselves and I think they said yes. I just remember being soooo impressed with how meaty they were.

BAO WOW: umami heavenly goodness. My mouth is watering just thinking of them. It's a flavor explosion tucked in a fluffy bao.

SEITAN CHICKEN & WAFFLES: best brunch item I've ever had. It's not on the regular menu but based on reviews, it's often available. If you see it, get it. Spicy, sweet, meaty - it hits all the notes.

TIRAMISU: this is one of those dishes that I can't help but order whenever I find a vegan version, it's just irresistible to me. I was too full from feasting to eat dessert there, so I took this to go to eat later in my hotel room while watching trashy TV. The layers of mascarpone are wonderful. 

If I had one complaint, it's that the french fries that come as a side are not all cooked properly. They're really thick steak fries, seasoned really well, but they miss the mark when they're still tough on the inside. Thankfully, they come free with your entree so if there had to be a shortcoming anywhere, that's not bad.

I love the earthy, hip ambience, and I've been treated to excellent live music a few times. They have a great happy hour (buy one get one free) and street parking is a breeze. This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",H183Fg4ku9mIQsmAa0fsOQ,4,4,5,0lFd-AFqotlmynGloFNH0g

This place is one of the best vegan restaurants that I have been to. I would recommend this place even if your not a vegan. Everything here was excellent.

We started out with some fair trade organic coffee. It was served in a manual coffee press that contained about four cups. I also liked that they had almond milk and raw stevia for my coffee.

Appetizers:Bao Bun and Save the Tuna Roll.

**The Bao Bun contained some tofu, spinach, mushrooms, and an amazing sauce. Excellent!!!

**Save the Tuna is a roll that is made with veggies and purple rice. Excellent!!!

Entrees:

Veggie Nation Burger - Excellent!
Muchas Gracias / Quesada - Excellent!
Ellen DeGeneres - three veggie tacos. The shells consisted of collar green leaves. Excellent!

My only real criticism is that the menu descriptions are lacking. If there's a strong flavor in a dish it should be mentioned but often isn't. For instance, the gnocchi they're serving now is topped with nutritional yeast but that's not mentioned on the menu.

My only reason for 4/5 stars is that it definitely is more on the pricey side, especially for the small portions.

If I wanted, I could have eaten 4 orders worth as a meal. The mushroom pizza is a very comforting treat; my SO and I do like shredded Daiya. I realize it's a hit or miss for people, but we enjoy it as well as most other plant-based cheeses.

Lastly, do yourself a favor and get a brownie sundae. This dessert will make you all kinds of happy! It offers so many different flavors that work well together: a fudgy brownie, creamy vanilla and chocolate ice cream, crunchy walnuts (?), and fresh fruit!

4636183,2016-03-31,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"OK. So the food is AMAZING! Let me just start off by saying that because the mission of this review is not to bash the restaurant. 

I need the customers, owners and employees to realize how inappropriate DONALD was on the phone with me today.

My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian. It's HARD to come to Vegas regularly for long days of strategic work and find healthy food to fuel our brains. This has been our FAVORITE place in LV. We even got to chat with the owners last month for a second to express our gratitude when they had the guest pop up chef from LA. Excitement grew as we learned they are on GrubHub although issues struck when I found that GrubHub would not deliver far enough in the span of a block. They will deliver to 4365 but not to 4500 on the street so I decided to call to see if something could work. I get a lovely lady named AARON (sorry if I misspelled your name lovely!) and she sent me to PostMates because they normally deliver as far as you want so I tried that but still no luck. I called back trying to see if I can figure something out. You all know that moment when your heart becomes set on having such delicious food. I ask for her because she was SUPER HELPFUL, KIND, and COMPASSIONATE ABOUT PROVIDING A GREAT EXPERIENCE. She said it was weird that they weren't showing up. So then she says ""Ok, try one more called EatStreet. If that doesn't work call back."" At this moment, after the call, I turn to my boyfriend and go ""OMG I love the vegan/vegetarian culture because people are so genuinely nice and they want to help you! They know how important it is to eat well."" My heart filled with love just because of her kindness I get back on my computer and try EatStreet. Unfortunately, EatStreet also said delivery unavailable. Now keep in mind I had just put down 50 MINUTES OF MY TIME to figure out how to order this food. I even offered to pay more to get it. We also discussed having GrubHub drop it off at the strip club down the street. 

So I call back and ask for Aaron again and the host said hold on...

""Hello this is DONALD,"" an agitated, grumpy voice came on the phone. I try to tell him my situation but I can barely get through it by the time his negative energy cuts me off and says ""We are in downtown and only deliver so far."" I told him I understand that but I was working with Aaron to see if we couldn't figure something out. I told him she directed me to EatStreet but if I still had problems call back. No joke he says ""Try EatStreet."" I repeat myself. I'm a little frustrated with his attitude but my voice was still calm and nice trying to work with him. Again he was soggy and said ""The Orleans is too far, the delivery companies only go a certain radius."" 
I was also literally OK with jumping in a taxi and meeting GrubHub down the street. Aaron may not have even been able to condone that but she was sincerely trying to help and her help wasn't taking her off the floor for more than a minute each time I called. (Now I have also worked at many restaurants from serving to bartending in downtown San Francisco and San Diego. I know a minute does effect flow but there are lovely other options on how to deal with inquisitive customers like myself.) 
I could feel his negative energy through the phone and I choose not to deal with toxic energy. I ask for Aaron because she knows what's up. DONALD replies to me as if I'm one of his employees (obviously the manager) trying to distract him from a rush, ""Aaron can't come to the phone, she's on the floor right now. It's lunch time. It's busy!"" In my head I'm like, duh, why else would I be trying to order food from you... It's close to lunch. I told him he was providing poor customer service and he hung up on me....HE HUNG UP ON ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!! No ""Could you please try calling back later?"", no ""I'm sorry miss I don't know what else we can do for you."", No suggestions to another restaurant or hey even try another vegetarian search around your area with the GPS on. There were SO many other ways he could have dealt with this situation. DONALD WAS NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT KIND. I wouldn't have been mad or anything if he or Aaron couldn't help me as long as they were kind about it! 

Needless to say when we go to VegeNation this week I hope Aaron is working so I can express how much gratitude I have for people like her. I hope she knows her light shines through his darkness. I hope all the employees can block out the negativity as well. I know what it's like to have a blood-sucking boss. I hope eventually the owners of VegeNation will take a step toward bettering their workplace environment by finding a replacement for DONALD. He needs to work at a restaurant that supports his negative attitude rather than working at a restaurant in which part of their values are to ""Do good by people."" 

P.S. Congrats Donald..This is the most time I've ever spent writing a review!

4647462,2018-06-16,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Wow! I am blown away by how awesome this place is. 

I'm not vegan, but dairy free. When my husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I told him that I wanted to be able to eat a nice meal without having to worry about avoiding dairy. He said he would find something great- and he did! 

VegeNation is the bomb. I am seriously impressed by how flavorful and delicious everything was. Oh! And they have a kids menu! This is big for me because I wasn't expecting them to have one. Some places just don't think about children so we end up having to get the kids a plate to share that usually goes to waste. Anyway, both girls wanted pizza. I asked the waitress about the portion size of the pizzas and she said ""individual"". So, I'm thinking she meant the little 4 slice Target/Pizza Hut sizes. Nope! The pizzas were huge and delish! The cheese was creamy and rich in flavor and the kids gobbled up as many slices as they could. 

Okay. On to the adult food. We ordered the cauliflower ""buffalo wings"" and they were nice. The buffalo sauce was tangy and had a nice bite. Not overwhelming but strong enough. They were served with a ""ranch"" dipping sauce.

Main course. Husband and I both ordered the ""chicken"" pot pie. Sooooo good! Creamy, flavorful, rich and chunky. Super rustic and so much of it! The waitress suggested that we just share since we were ordering the same thing but it was my birthday and I wanted to be a greedy ass and enjoy my own food. Welp! She was absolutely right. We could have shared. It was a ginormouse bowl of goodness that I couldn't finish. That was okay though because I was promised a free dessert for my birthday. I saved just enough room for it and I am so happy that I did. 

I was given a brownie sundae. Ahhhmaayyyyzing! I believe the ice cream was coconut or almond based. Whatever it was, it was nice and smooth and was the perfect finish to an outstanding meal. The brownie was crispy around the edges, hot and chewy in the middle. It also came with bananas and berries that were incredibly plump and fresh. Geeze. This place is legit.

My Little Dumpling ($5.95): Steamed shiitake mushroom and spinach. Fantastic dumplings! Plus, the accompanying sauce was perfect (and great with the other dishes). The dumpling skins were light and chewy and the filling was flavorful. Probably one of the best dumplings I've had, ever.

Bao Wow ($5.95): Asian BBQ tofu, spinach, shiitake mushroom, Bao bun. A nice concept of Bao, but wasn't something I loved. 

Save The Tuna ($6.95): Vegan sushi; Exotic forbidden rice. Yum! A simply tasty sushi roll and bonus, it's also beautiful. 

Picante Pineapple Pizza ($10.95): Charred pineapple, jalape√±o, and sausage. Their pizzas are delicious!! The crust is crispy on the edges and the toppings are flavorful. They use Daiya brand Vegan cheese (which I already love). This particular pizza uses Vegan sausage that was rather good. The pineapple appeared to be from a can and not obviously charred, but it didn't take away from the dish being my favorite of the group.

Mushroom Madness Pizza ($10.95): Assorted mushrooms and herbs. Same great crust, cheese, and sauce. We requested half of Mushroom Madness and half of Picante Pineapple, which was a perfect sampling. I wasn't as fond of the mushroom bunch, but my sister loved it.

Ellen Degeneres ($10.95): Raw power tacos; collard green wraps. I really enjoy collard green wraps and etc. It's the perfect non-carb vehicle. These tacos are packed with various vegetables and other goodies; good kick of spice, too!

Casa Blanca ($11.95): Moroccan tagine of Harissa roasted vegetables. Great flavor; loved the assorted squash and root vegetables with the couscous.

Blueberry Cheese Cake ($7): Walnut crust, organic blueberries. Pretty delicious dessert considering there's no dairy. The ""cheese"" cake had a nice consistency and the blueberries had a good balance of sweet and tart.

Overall, I really enjoyed our meal. I'm definitely planning on a return visit and for it to be one of my go-to places in town.

Moving on to the entree I was disappointed. The Russian standard was just OK. In my opinion it was bland and the braised eggplant was rubbery. It was really a let down in comparison to the appetizer.

Really enjoyed this place a lot. Both the servers hostesses were really nice. Food was great. The space itself is really nice and bright, and the layout makes it feel comfortable and spacious for the size of the restaurant. 

Two small things...
Consistency. Got the buffalo cauliflower both times I ate here. The portion was less than half the size the second time. Noticed in the pictures on yelp things varying a whole lot. 
Second... And this is going to sound really petty... It'd be nice if they offered room temperature water before bringing out ice water. 

Anyway. Great restaurant. I'd absolutely eat here again next time I'm in Las Vegas.",FfX2617XANZ6Irdb_OhOOg,1,0,5,afwyxyyij2KnvgGBR1Ethg

This place is 100% 5-Stars. I was visiting Las Vegas and so happy to be taken to this vegan sanctuary!

Lots of vegan restaurants DOUSE their foods in salt and if you are a vegan foodie you will notice, the clean taste of the items!

APPETIZERS: we ordered the pot-stickers, the buffalo cauliflower, and the sweet potato tamales. ALL THREE WERE SUPERB! But the buffalo cauliflower took the cake!

Only a few celery sticks and could have used more to cool down the heat. The blue cheese sauce could have been better too I think. My only real complaint is that everything is made with soy or nuts so if you are avoiding both, you only have 2 or 3 options although I thought the Pamela Anderson was a perfect vegan taco dish and scrumptious.

Entrees:  We had the Out of Africa Stew and LITTLE SOUL Ravioli Black Eyed Peas & Collard Greens.  Both were Great!  The stew was just a little spicy, but not really HOT, if you are worried.  The Ravioli's disappeared like magic. Yum!

4938795,2016-05-16,3,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Vegenation is a great option for Las VEGANS (get it? Ha). Coming from LA, I'm a little picky when it comes to vegan restaurants. Vegan restaurants outside of LA tend to lack in the flavor department or replace everything with soy...say no to GMOs! When I first came here, I remember the menu being very soy heavy. It seems as though they have changed their menus for the better since then. There are now plenty of soy free items with an array of flavors. 

The not so good...
Bao Wow: I could be bias on this one due to my distaste for soy heavy items. I ordered this on accident because the waitress recommended it, and I didn't check the menu for what was inside. I ended up taking the tofu out & just eating the bun haha. 
Blueberry Cheesecake: This basically just tasted like coconut oil and nuts. Maybe it would've been better if it was colder? Maybe not. 

The okay...
Hot Tamale: If you're craving a tamale, I'd recommend this; however, I won't be ordering this again. Nothing made it stand out flavor wise to me. 
Vegenation Burger: The potato wedges that come out with the burger are spiced very well, and the sweet ketchup compliments them well. The burger patty itself was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, just tasted like a lot of black beans mashed together...could use more seasoning. I'm not exaggerating when I say the burger fell apart after 3 bites (& my mouth isn't THAT big). The buns were already soggy when it came out as well. I don't like soggy bread, so I had to do without them. Does anyone like soggy bread?
Chocolate Tacos: I already know people are going to disagree with me on this one, but honestly, these were just okay. I just had chocolate tacos from Tacos and Beer the other night that raised the bar! I know Tacos & Beer is not vegan, but it wouldn't be too difficult to replace ice cream with vegan ice cream. That's just my opinion. 

The yummy in my tummy recommendations...
Picante Pineapple Pizza: My meat loving boyfriend orders this every time and absolutely loves this. It tastes just like a ""regular"" pizza. I would strongly recommend this to those that are new to the vegan scene or anyone that's just craving some pizza. 
Black Bean Chili Stuffed Sweet Potato: soooo yummy & full of flavor! Since it is sweet potato, it is also actually quite filling. 
Save the Tuna: Not only is this sushi super colorful and pretty, it is also DELICIOUS! Hands down, this is my favorite item on their menu. 
Brownie Sundae: I'm drooling thinking about this one. Just look at my picture of this brownie, topped with ice cream, topped with caramel, fruit, & nuts! It is unanimously the best dessert Vegenation currently has to offer.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,4,4,4,FbRi2LQJy36a0q-Wxp5tQg

Stopped by this hipster looking joint in the DTLV area to satisfy my cluckity cluck craving this afternoon.

The place was way busier than I anticipated with open seating available; although the host insisted I wait five (which turned into ten) minutes. Whatevs!! 

My server Nikki was sweet when she finally arrived but you could tell she was overwhelmed by the amount of guest in her section.  

My cauliflower wings $6.95  were perfect not mushy  but not too hard either. Moment of silence for the ""ranch"" Omg!!! I devoured my Save The Tuna Roll! Another great flavorful pick $6.95 The fries $3.95 were delish but the red dipping sauce was terrible.

My favorites were the Holy Mole, Torre Washington Salad and Warm Apple Cobbler! I live and work right around the corner and will be back often!

Ordered the Out of Africa again, for some reason it did not taste the same as the first time we had it. Pretty disappointed since this is what we came back for. Let our server (Daniel I think his name was) know and he said that ""our kitchen is working on consistency."" Didn't offer to give us something else to replace it. Kinda bummed. =(


Hoki Poki and the Out of Africa bowl are my favorites!! I've been here twice and have had great service and  delicious food both times.

My co-worker (who happens to be vegan) and I were over the Vegas vibes the second we pulled our Uhaul up to the Rio. The shitty recycled air, and sea of gray hair and plastic men/women quickly forced us to find some sort of personality in a city that didn't seem to have any. 

We found Vegenation on Yelp, and took the 15 minute uber ride to the restaurant. I ordered the Vegenation Burger, and my coworker got the Muchas Gracias. We came back to this place every single night as the food was super good. The vibes were also on point, with some good music and stellar service from a fun young group. 

On our third or fourth time coming in after the convention, the owner stopped by and said hello to us. He asked us what we were in town for, and shot the shit before going back to work. It was a really nice change of pace.

4979172,2017-09-03,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"So, one of my colleagues is a pescatarian and was craving something fresh. We were visiting the Container Park and found this place on yelp. So we we're quite excited! 

So I will say this post and rating is based on their service and not so much their food because we didn't really get to try any food. 

So when we arrived, we were seated within 5-7 minutes, which was fairly quick. Once we were seated, our server arrived a few minutes later with water and ready to talk about today's special. A colleague and I took advantage of the Yelp special (free sangria), which was refreshing and I very much enjoyed. I will say it did take about 10 minutes to bring out two sangrias, a punch, and water. I understand that it may take a bit of time to put drinks together but it seemed to take a bit too long compared to other restaurants I have been too. 

We were rarely checked in upon and we were not informed or communicated to about the delay of the food. Other individuals who had arrived before us acquired their appetizers after we did, after sitting for 40 minutes. We had to flag down other employees to request an update from our server. After our request, our server never came. 

So after approximately 30-40 minutes of waiting for food to arrive, my colleagues decided they were no longer going to wait for the food because we weren't provided the service that a customer should be given. 

In addition, when we were informing the hostess we were leaving and we would like to pay for the punch, then our server came out asking why we were leaving. Our server stated that the food needed 15-20mins to prepare; which surprised us because no one told us. 

In the end, we appreciate the manager coming out and comping the drink but I wish they had given more attention to their customer service. 

If I choose to try this place next time I'm in town, I hope they have made improvements.",d9s9wcyDRko5ElkskER7iA,2,2,1,cCaqSEg47xrRX1bSTulc_g

I'm so use to being limited on my vegan options when dining out and with my 1st visit to Vegenation, I was like a kid in a candy store with endless choices to choose from. I've dine here twice and keep ordering takeout. Here is what I've discovered.....

Buffalo Cauliflower: 5 ***** FANTASTIC! Gluten free, No breading, baked with amazing hot sauce! A must everytime I order in or to go

Mushroom Spinach Dumplings: 3 *** Just okay. These had some good flavor (ordered steam) but extremely sticky and needed the soy sauce to add something to it.

Chicken tacos: 5 ***** Delicious! Pop up meal gluten free Gardein chicken with lime slaw and Mexican rice. 

Coconut Thai Curry 5 ***** BOMB!! Gluten free and wow at 1st bite. Made with sweet pot noodles 

Eggplant: 4 **** Flavorful. Gluten free, great flavor but there were some crunchy bites and I believe it was from the cashew cheese. It was a little strange chewing on crunchy in eggplant but had great flavor.

Kids Grill Cheese Sandwhich: 4 **** The 4 year old boy with us ate every bite of his sandwich but wasn't too thrilled about the large potato fries. They're wedges and didn't seem cooked all the way through but that might be their style in the fries. 

Brownie Sundae: 5***** A Must!!! This was incredible! Their ice cream is made out of avocado and nut butter. It's vanilla & chocolate on a brownie with caramelized bananas and Coconut shavings. They have a child's ice cream with choc mouse and gummy worms but they were out of worms so the boy with us had a scoop of choc ice cream. My pic shows you what he thought about it.....

Please check them out!! They offer breakfast with mimoas and bloody Mary's. Their alcohol choices are from a local Las Vegas brewery and organic.

The Mexican Hummus was served with blue corn chips, however, I personally felt the Hummus was bland even with the salt in the chips I get like it needed more lime or spice or salt....something.  The WINNER of the meal was the Pho King Delicious! The flavors were married together, they leave the lime in when you order it to go, don't know if that is how they always do it, but it gave it additional flavor that was delicious.

I went here solely based on the fact that they were sitting at 4.5 stars, and 600 reviews. We weren't disappointed. 

The first visit I had the Eggplant stacks. The ricotta cheese was awesome, and the eggplant was perfectly cooked. 

The second time I had the Thai Curry. Good lord, also good. Unique too, in that they use glass noodles which made for an interesting change up. 

The pros:
1) I seriously haven't had anything I didn't love
2) friendly staff
3) good price- the three of us are for less than $40

The cons
None that I can think of.

On to the food. I got the Jamaican hibiscus tea which is amazing! Tastes kind of like Christmas flavors and it's refillable! Also tried the lemonade with coconut water and chia seeds. Also good but the hibiscus was better in my opinion. I got the buffalo cauliflower app it was good but kind of small. The entrees made up for that though! I got the eggplant stack which was amazing! Also tried the Russian pasta (forgot the actual name but you'll know what I'm talking about). Both were so delicious and filling. Also really healthy. Some vegan food isn't the best for you because it's more processed or fried. When they try to make meat imitations instead of alternatives it tends to be less healthy.

In my opinion the food is five stars they have a very creative menu with lots of different options. We enjoyed all of the food we ordered .  The buffalo cauliflower is absolutely awesome! We walked in about 15 minutes before closing. We stood at the door for the first 12 minutes and had 3 ( literally) employees with veg Nations shirts walk past us. None of them said anything... Not hi, hello, we will be with you in a moment. Two of them actually looked down at the ground instead of acknowledging the  customers( there were five of us standing at the front entry). Finally my husband mentioned to me it seems like we're invisible or something .  Just after he said something a gentleman in plain clothes ""oh I can help you?"" . He happened to be the owner and was very nice. He mentioned that he thought we had just stood up  from a table that was unbothered or .  I can understand how if he was in the back hewould have thought this . He sat us in the area that we wanted and let us know that he would get our waiter for us.? The owner left shortly after seating us. I was very surprised when the waitress (Faith) that came over was the same waitress that had walked past us several times without saying hello.? The service never got better.  At one point the server actually brought  food to the table with out silverware
 my husband asking for silverware.  As she turned away she did not acknowledge his request. Since it seems pretty clear to me that she must not have heard him  due to her lack of response  I grab silverware off a table that was right behind us .  She actually Came back about 4 minutes later without silverware asking if we still needed any... I'm not really sure why if a waitress heard customers ask for silverware they wouldn't acknowledge or grab the closest sets of silverware. I understand that this was the end of the night and it did  seem like they were busy shortly before. As a past Yelp Advertiser and local  business ownerer it really takes a lot for me to write a negative review because I understand first-hand how great of an effect it can have on the company .  I was really surprised when looking at the reviews  that the business has not gone on  here and replied to the reviews  or seem to make any changes in the last couple weeks with several other to start reviews due to service . I really did love all the food that we had and it came out  very quickly from the kitchen . I feel like this place has a lot of potential an amazing menu and the ambience is wonderful as well. I hope that this business steps up their game tenfold with their service. and that next time I eat there (which I plan to again) I  can update this review to a 5 star review :-).",qN_rK48Ms5W03CioH55SVA,0,0,2,e19bSXIMhqCfGAbyhZ0xNw

If you are only in Las Vegas for a short time, make sure to make Vegenation one of your food destinations. 

For appetizers, my partner and I had the antipasto platter and the hot tamales. The hot tamales were good. The antipasto platter featured the local virgin cheese, which was very good.  We longed for crackers of some sort to put the cheese on. As a kale chips fan, those on the platter were by far the worst I've ever had, but since the rest of the meal hit it out of the park, this was no more than a minor disappointment. 

We ordered the East West tacos and the eggplant stacks with vegan ricotta and mozzarella in the middle for entrees. Both were absolutely delicious and we would happily order them again and again if we ever return to LV. 

For dessert, we had the bread pudding and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was so creamy, rich and flavourful. We'd recommend a bit more coconut cream in the bread pudding, but it was still delicious, too. 

Part of what made the meal so good was our highly knowledgeable and attentive server, David. He knew precisely what was in each dish and sold each item so well, he had us downright excited to try more dishes than we ever intended to order.

Even if you're not vegan, the food here is great and worth a try to anyone looking for a different kind of afternoon meal. 
The atmosphere is great, they have a nice set up that includes lots of plants and decor but nothing too overbearing, and the waiting staff is really nice. Our waiter was super cool and open about explaining everything on the menu and what's in it. 

Everything on the menu is vegan and it all sounded great I wanted to try EVERYTHING. For the appetizer my friend and I shared their ""Save the tuna"" sushi roll and it's was probably my favorite thing served there thus far.

For entrees, she got the mushroom sliders(which I had a taste of and were AWESOME) and I had the ""Out of Africa"" curry dish. It had a nice blend of flavors and wasn't too spicy, but still tasty. (I'll have to ask next time if they can adjust levels of spicyness, I like my curry ON FIIREEE)

Even though we were both stuffed by the end of our meal, I knew I couldn't leave this place without getting some dessert. Choco tocos were the go-to for a quick tasting, they were small and cute and just enough for someone that want's a sweet snack but you know you're too full to eat anything else. Unless you're like me who keeps eating after they are full, cause I'm a terrible person.

The salted caramel choco tacos are great and there is quite a salty bite in them, so make sure you know what you're getting when you order them!

5090434,2015-04-16,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"So much good!   Good for the environment, good for the people, and good for the wallet!

I had met Chef Donald at an event almost 2 years ago,  when I first learned about his all vegan restaurant he planned to open downtown.   Ever since then I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of VegeNation!  So, when Surprise! They opened almost a week earlier than they had originally stated, I needed to get my grub on ASAP.

I was there twice today, TWICE!  It is that good, it is that budget friendly, that I went for both lunch and dinner and I'm not ashamed!

Staff - perfectly nice and attentive.  I enjoy when I'm at a restaurant and I can feel that the server loves and believes in the food.  The servers aren't quite there yet,  but I take away no points because my understanding is that the servers weren't expecting the early opening either.   They were perfectly good servers,  this is just a preference of mine and I'm confident they'll get there. 

Location - in the up and coming part of DTLV, walking distance from Container Park and such, easy on-street parking.

Decor/Ambience - Check out photos attached.  Very comfortable.  

Lunch - CIAO MARGARITA PIZZA I'm not a big fan of Daiya, but the in house made sauce, charred grape tomatoes,  basil,  and perfectly cooked crust won me over.   MUCHAS GRACIAS Sweet Potato Quesadilla oh em gee, so freaking good, I can't even.  CHOCOLATE TACOS little pastry crisps filled with chocolate pudding,  topped with salted caramel,  berry, and coconut.  JAMAICAN HIBISCUS PUNCH caffeine free,  just enough sweetness, LEMONADE WITH COCONUT WATER AND CHIA SEEDS. I didn't taste this,  but it looked awesome and my friend loved it.    My omni Co worker was blown away by how good everything was.  My favorite tidbit from her was ""I am so satisfied, so full, yet I don't feel gross ""  Yup, welcome to Vegan food, my friend!

Dinner - MEATBALL GRINDER ""meat"" balls in that delicious red sauce on a toasted hoagie roll, topped with melted Daiya, served with a side of potato wedges and their own home-made ketchup.  The Hub's reaction ""I didn't realize how much I missed meatball parm"" (we've been vegetarian for many years) EAST WEST TACOS Jackfruit (mimics pulled pork) seasoned well,  topped with a Korean sauce and just the right amount of citrus (lime) to. Die. For.  BLACK BEAN CHILI  STUFFED SWEET POTATO this is actually a side item, and it tastes exactly as good as it sounds.   BROWNIE SUNDAE so effing good period.  DRINKS We had a drink that was Whiskey,  Cold Pressed Apple juice,  and cherry.   It was divine (and strong).  Also had the Mango Ceylon Iced Tea delish!

Price - for lunch,  before tip we were at $36 (2 meals,  2 drinks,  dessert)  for dinner,  before tip we were at $49 (2 meals,  1 alcoholic beverage,  1 non alcoholic beverage,  1 side,  dessert)  Incredible value considering our non-alcoholic drinks included free refills and the ingredients are organic whenever possible.

 Bottom line - Highly Recommended.  Check out their website for more info including their mission statement.   Veggies and Omnis alike can appreciate the flavors, artistry, and feel good vibed of VegeNation",rg9BnWtWbEusg8GBnS8JsQ,3,2,5,V-lw80VfsxGijz73wGAdGw

I tried asking for parmesan, but naturally, being a vegan restaurant and all, they didn't have any. Instead, the waitress offered me a yeast substitute. I'm sure the expression in my face was less than enthusiastic but I told her I would try it anyway. Conclusion: the yeast just wasn't for me, but kudos to anybody who finds delight and taste in the fungal substitute. Bypassing the fact that I'm just really not a vegan, this restaurant is the truth.

I went for the meatball sub, my girlfriend got the chicken pie gnocchi, and we split the sushi. We wound up getting bread pudding for dessert.

Sushi: Bruh. Awesome. Pretty much impossible to tell it's vegan. A little wasabi and ginger would have made it perfect, but really, it didn't actually need it. 

Meatball sub: The menu claims it's homemade, and maybe it is, but the meatballs were super similar to Gardein.. which is fine with me, they're delicious. The sauce soaked into the bomb ass bread, and with the ""cheese"" on top, it had a gooey sort of texture. The sub came with a side of fries that had a cajun-y seasoning with a side of curry ketchup. It was a bunch of weird flavors that I thought only I thought would go well together, but apparently not. My one critique would be I wish the wedges were a little thinner. A couple felt a little underdone in the middle. 

Chicken pie gnocchi: Good stuff. It's oddly slightly sweet, so I felt like it needed hot sauce for heat and acid, but I enjoyed the few bites I had. The chicken inside looked and tasted like Beyond, but that's fine with me. 

Bread pudding: Not a huge fan of sweets, but this was pretty good. Hot and, dare I say, M O I S T, with ice cream, and a bunch of fruit. Muy bueno. 

VegeNation is awesome, and I really hope they franchise. The whole menu sounded delicious, and I'm willing to bet it all would be. Another definite visit for me when I come back to Vegas.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,4,2,5,g5YsJ_mtSg5DT1VIathzLA

5161378,2015-12-09,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"My boyfriend wished to pen a review, here's his two cents:

My girlfriend and I have been here four times,  plus once for a carry-out order tonight.   Our experience tonight has forced me to gather my experiences and write a review.  My girlfriend is vegan,  I am not. It was her desire to try this new Vegan place in a city with few satisfying vegan dining options.    

Our biggest problem with this place is that it seems like it's run by someone who doesn't know exactly what they're doing.  One time we went, all three of our food choices were sold out. Not a big deal, but still off-putting. Another night, one of the two beer choices was sold out. The only other option was an IPA, and I know it's a craze lately but there are people who dont prefer an IPA. Another time they ran out of the big glasses so I had two sips of my tiny glass of iced tea and it had to be refilled.  Really, out of large drinking glasses? I'd personally love it if they could offer more beverage options- Perhaps a cola? I can go to the grocery store and purchase several well-made and delicious natural cola beverages that would fit into VegeNation's model of natural and organic vegan food.  If it's an issue with sugar, fortunately enough I know of at least one cola sweetened with agave. The server forgot my girlfriend's drink order the same night as the ""tiny glass incident"".  Mistakes happen, and she made it right but there are so many little things with this place that make you wonder if the staff is trained or experienced in food service. It just leaves you with an odd feeling of discomfort when you're coming out for a nice meal and service. 

The service is largely good. Like some others have mentioned, it's just odd how there is insecurity over whether the busboy wants to take my empty plate. Training issue or experience, or both? Change this and I think there's a very good thing going on at VegeNation.  We've been served by several different employees and Erin seems to be one of the strongest. She made right on a mistake she made the one night but she seems to know what she's doing more so than some of the others. 

The food at VegeNation is hit an miss.  My girlfriend wants so badly to LOVE this place.  But it seems like every time we go there there's just one nagging little thing that prevents it from being a great experience.  Overall the food is very nice. It's put together well and presented nicely, but it's terribly inconsistent. The sushi is excellent, we've had it once.  I loved it. The pizza was good, the crust was really good for some reason. We've had the bow wow appetiser twice and tonight it just seemed like the sauce was non-existent and the tofu not marinated.  My girlfriend was let down based on the same food being so excellent the last time we went there. I've had the meatball grinder three times and it is very consistently delicious- And I'm NOT vegan! Tonight, however, I got home to see that I had been given mostly raw potatoes for fries... 

 Overall, I DO like this place. I, as a non-vegan, have been surprisingly impressed with the food at VegeNation. I just feel there are some big bugs to still work out and inconsistencies to smooth out. Every time I go there I hope the experience is flawless, but sadly there is always something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth to oppose the delicious food.",8PQ76yALAc6C8HtsxXc8NA,3,1,2,TPdazSJMRntINfMYGHHuCw

The women sitting us even let us know it might take a minute, totally understandable. It wasn't until 6 people that got seated after us had waters and had already ordered their food until we got remotely greeted by a server. 10 mins into us being seated. 

I don't even know the waitresses name and we only saw her a total 3 times for the entire hour and 15 mins we were there. After she brought us waters she never checked on us again until our food came literally 25 MINUTES AFTER we ordered it. Half the restaurant was empty by that time. Didn't even bother asking if we needed refills or apologize for the wait. We even checked in and asked for our free sundaes and only brought us one. The only time we got our drinks refilled was when we were on desert which was by a busser I'm assuming, so we went the entire meal without water because she never cared to come check. 
We got the check at the same time since we were already there over an hour and didn't want to wait to find her again. 

It was the worst service I've ever had which sucks because we do love coming there, my friends and I. Service is a huge part of making a restaurant survive and acknowledgment or an apology would have been great. I didn't even bother tipping because that's how horrible this service was.

A word to the wise, a server makes their money on tips. If you don't bother to check on your tables the entire night, don't expect a dime for giving shitty service.",mO-AAuRLEAaGUuGYw_Q6Yw,1,0,1,8nxT9hYXgqevXk5MXwDmSA

Their menu is very similar, but the downtown location occasionally has some fun pop-up events too.
One of the downsides to this location is the space itself - it's shaped like an awkward L, which seems to slow down waitstaff response time, and makes you feel crammed - especially if you are in the long, Bavarian-style (kinda) booth.
The other downside to this location is paying for parking, although they will give you $2 off of your bill if you can present your ticket.
Try out their spaghetti and meatballs, pizzas, and tiramisu - avoid their Thursday vegechanga popup and buffalo cauliflower starter (only a few pieces of cauliflower are included so it's not worth the price point).",i6DkPAz95X3FtuUCLR_QHQ,0,0,4,U34crz--z72EbugfPQxYJA

5278121,2016-05-24,25,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Vegenation is a hip restaurant in downtown Las Vegas with a completely all vegan menu. It gets four stars for taste but I'm rounding up to five stars since Vegenation has such a wonderful impact in the vegan community, is stringent about buying locally, and has such great weekly events - Can you say Pop-up menus, 2 for 1 Happy Hour drinks, Brunch Specials, AND Meatless Mondays with DJs?? There is always something fun going on here it seems like. 

I've ate at Vegenation a few times and I will definitely be back to sample more items from the menu, but here's what I've had so far:
FRENCH TOAST WITH FRUIT ($10.95): This was my first dining experience with Vegenation, and I was not impressed. I was able to get 2 for 1 mimosas on this visit, but for $18 it just didn't feel right. I really should have went with something more unique, like the breakfast burrito with tofu chorizo. Fortunately, I vowed to give Vegenation a second chance! 3/5

CHICKEN N' WAFFLES ($12ish): This dish sold me completely on Vegenation. The 'chicken' tasted amazing and the portion size was huge! Served with potato wedges and a side of maple syrup and hot sauce. This was my second visit. :) 5/5 
PRO TIP: This dish is only available on weekends and is known to sell out!

MEXICAN HUMMUS ($6.95): A large appetizer with plenty to go around. My party of four really liked this interesting hummus made out of black beans. 4/5

CHICKEN POT PIE ($11ish): How could I not get this for dinner? The chicken bits tasted great and the sauce that topped this vegan medley was thick and creamy. Tasty, but I was kind of disappointed that the pot pie wasn't actually stuffed in a pie crust. Had this for my third visit and already looking forward to my fourth visit! 4/5

VIBE: Hipster, Eco-friendly, and the patio out front is great for people watching. 5/5

PRO TIP: Follow Vegenation on Instagram for updates, specials on drinks, and info on validated parking.

I'd recommend Vegenation to all vegans and vegetarians! I brought my omnivorous friends here and they loved it too, so don't think you can't bring the whole gang here. Keep on keeping on Vegenation. You rock!

5284406,2016-02-21,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"TL;DR - Eat here, you'll like it. Be sure to have a cocktail.

I ate here because my wife is currently eating Vegan (we had too much Franklin BBQ in Austin last month and needed to drop the weight) and I wanted to take her someplace where they had Vegan food (not just salads).  It's around the corner (south and west) from the Downtown Container park (which I regularly take visitors to because its cool and I like to scare them when the Giant Praying Mantis flamethrower antennas shoot 30' flames) - but I had never driven on that street, so I didn't know it existed until I found it on yelp.

Food was very good.  I had the Italian ""meatball"" sandwich - I couldn't tell it apart from a real meatball sub if you asked me to.  I don't remember what my wife ordered, but I tasted it and it was good too.  Its a real restaurant with tables and waiters, not a order at the counter place like Veggie Grill. 

This is the only vegan place other than the Veggie Grill chain (mostly in California, none in Las Vegas) that I can recommend.

I've eaten at a number of ""Vegan"" restaurants before and about half are terrible because Vegan is usually a political statement about not eating animals. This means that the food is very limited (or terrible - like raw food places) or uses substitutes that don't taste as good as the real items (eggs, milk, cheese, butter, meat).  Also, the staff at vegan places tend to be vegan too which usually means a lot of weird servers.  

This place was good.  Our waiter was normal, they did have another guy with a purple mohawk (very punk) haircut and the waitresses had multiple earrings, nose rings, etc.  They all seemed pretty nice and professional and no one seemed to be pushing an agenda.

This place has a limited menu, but the food is very good.  only thing we said ""meh"" to was one of the desserts - the cheesecake (which obviously doesn't have real cheese in it) was kind of gritty and not creamy.  I would pass on it.  I had the 3 choco tacos and they were good.  

I had a Pina Colada cocktail drink and it was the best I've ever had in my life.  It probably because they have a juice bar so they fresh press and squeeze their juices here (verses getting it from a can of Dole juice anyplace else) - so it was really, really delicious.  prices were very reasonable.  i will eat and drink here again. 

Its pay street parking, but they have a lot across the street that is apparently free with validation.  best bet is to pull up in front in one of the empty street parking spots and go inside and ask where to move to.   Meter maids do patrol the area because of the popular Downtown Container Park right around the corner, so if you street park make sure you pay.  its only like $2-4, but the machines takes like 5 minutes per person to run a credit card.  It might be faster with coins but I haven't carried any of those in my pocket since the '90s.

Save the Tuna:
Vegan sushi made with forbidden rice, cucumber, bell pepper, mango, avocado, nori and sesame seeds.

Sliders with portobello mushroom, kale and sriracha aioli, with potato wedges on the side. Mushrooms have a beefy taste to them, in my opinion, which is why I love mushrooms. The multi-grain buns and kale add the crunch to the sliders. 5/5

East West Taco:
Non-GMO homemade tortilla, jackfruit, gochijang BBQ sauce, kale, radichio nd guacamole. Jackfruit is normally yellow-orange in color and is very sweet. Theirs looks like shredded chicken...mind-blowing! 4/5

Organic sweet potato quesadilla, black beans drizzled with chipotle crema, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The sweetness of the sweet potato, spiciness of the chipotle crema, and the richness of guacamole make layers of textures and flavors. 4/5

Chocolate Thunder:
Cocao, peanut butter, banana, chia seeds and kale. I added hemp protein powder for $1. This tasted like dirt. This could have used more banana and peanut butter.

Vegenation is the vegan joint sponsored by Uncle Tony in the Fremont East corridor. 

The place is charming and full of bright colors and is casual, making you feel hip for eating/venturing to a vegan joint. No animals were harmed for your meal. Unfortunately, your taste buds would be.

Appetizer: Tamales and the Vegan sushi.
Tamales were mostly cornhusk with a small amount of filling. The filling was delicious, just not plentiful. Sushi was flavorful and colorful. This dish was pretty to look at and hit on all the sushi accent flavors. Awesome original flavors encountered; I was thinking ""we're in for a treat,"" but mostly everything fell flat after this round.

Round 2: Mushroom Pizza and butternut squash ravioli. The mushroom madness pizza tasted like a Diaya frozen pizza. I've had much, much better vegan pizza in downtown (Pop Up Pizza) and it's nicer on the wallet. The squash ravioli. What the fuck was that? Sauce was runny and flavorless.

Anyway, being a complete fatty on my cheat day, we ordered and split a blueberry cheesecake. This was pretty tasty. Not the greatest I've had, but it was pleasant and fresh and unique.

Vegenation is a place I really, really want to like. I will be back, as some items looked and smelled heavenly. I also wish they didn't have so many pasta and bread options. Processed foods are still processed foods, even if they are being served up in a cutely decorated joint in the burgeoning hipster Mecca that is Downtown Las Vegas.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,12,9,3,C1Cp014oARBTlGYPEFVWGw

I've followed VegeNation on Instagram and liked many a food photo.  Expectations started to run high which can sometimes be a dangerous thing. I'm happy to report, VegeNation met my high expectations!

Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi sounded very unique. I think I prefer the pasta potato dumplings to a pie crust. The flavor truly blew me away! It's cashew-cream based, savory, seasoned with rosemary, with chunks of ""chicken"" and veggies. Loved this! http://bit.ly/2kObZzo

The Meateater BF ordered the Sweet Potato Quesadilla. This is one of those dishes that makes me ask, ""why didn't I think of that!?!"" Sweet potato pur√©e and vegan cheese melted in a wheat tortilla. Yum! http://bit.ly/2klFR9h

We also took advantage of the Yelp check it offer: Spiked Apple Cider http://bit.ly/2joSSzT

Bellies were already happily full but we couldn't resist getting the Chocolate Tacos. Chocolate pudding in a tiny crispy shell with a sprinkle of chocolate granola. I think the shell was made of phyllo dough. I appreciated that this dessert was slightly on the lighter side. http://bit.ly/2joM7xU

Even my friend, who isn't vegetarian, enjoyed what he had.  Their alcoholic drinks are not to be discounted, either.  The one we got for free for doing a Yelp! check in was SO good!

5424720,2016-11-26,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"This is SO disappointing to have to write this horrible review. We have been patrons here for over a year and the food, while usually so delicious, has had so many inconsistencies. Tonight was the last straw. 

Customer Service: Usually mediocre but the food is so great that we always come back or order delivery. The hostesses love to put us on hold for long periods and then hang up when we call to place an order. The best is that they like to forget items that you paid for- calling Grubhub or Postmates to get a refund is never a fun, wasted 15 minutes of my day. Most of the time, the place seems as if its being ran by an after school, high school club. 

Tonight (I'm assuming they were out of their normal cheese) they used something similar to a bad, upsetting version of a cheese substitute. Very gooey and sticky but to the point of making you want to puke.. or highly consider it. No one bothered to say that they changed the recipe in the last week or were out of the normal ingredient. Again, we order these pizzas once or twice a week. The tamales are great when they are great, but 5 times out of 8, they are dry, bland, and burned. The last and only time i've ordered the Pho, the broth was so bland. Tasted like water with floating mushrooms. The eggplant stack would be good in theory.. however the bottom and edges were burned to the point of tasting like old, burned, oil crisps. The first time I had the buffalo cauliflower wings, they were amazing! The next two times they had a weird smell and tasted like perhaps they were cooked with the same oil as the brunch items... but hours later. 

The point here is that the inconsistency with the food is such a real problem. I LOVE to see vegan businesses thrive here! However, it looks like this is going to be one that loses our support. I absolutely hate yelpers that have had one bad experience (or lie) and rant just to get a free meal. I am not that person. I never give bad reviews, but I feel as we have been abused more times that necessary since we remained loyal customers despite the inconsistencies. Which is my fault I suppose for always coming back. I can only hope that they get it together before losing more business. 

Order and spend your money here at your own risk. Out of every 5 visits, I can guarantee that 3 of 5 of those, probably won't taste as well as the other 2.",hc_YU1Ih00jNtivFcocpaw,0,0,1,m3bMbVHi1LNVcDQUWG02cA

The pot pie is one of my favorites, and their lemonades are so fresh and delicious. Yes, it is a little pricey, but the quality of the food and the fact that it's vegan makes it worth it. 

The only thing is I don't really feel like they advertise they're vegan. The first time we went we didn't see any signs in the restaurant or the menu that said it was vegan so we just assumed it was vegetarian (we saw that they had meat on the menu so we figured it was Gardein or something like that.)

Pho - Meh. Broth was alright, a little light on the flavor. Tofu was literally just diced up and thrown in. Too many sprouts and not enough noodles.

I would maybe have the pot pie gnocchi again if I was in the area but would not recommend going out of your way to check out this spot.

We also got the ""Downtown Tony"" - portabello sliders with an aioli and veggie slaw, served with some ""wok veggies"". 

    The dishes were well thought out for the most part, but poorly executed. The sliders were probably the best thing we had, although not terribly flavorful, and the mushroom to bun ratio was pretty low, leaving you with a lot of extra bun. The wok veggies were overcooked and oversauced, and seemed like they were cooked in too much oil at too low a temperature to get caramelized. 

    The chicken was a good texture, but the breading was quite bland, and was much less crispy than other vegan fried chicken we have had. In my experience, the chicken needs to be a little spicy to balance out the sweetness of the maple syrup and waffles, and these couldn't stand up to their sweet counterparts. Waffles were very good! 

    The ""fries"" were more like baked potato wedges, were way too thick, and ended up raw in the middle, with little to no seasoning. Severely undercooked and not crispy. Curried ketchup was strangely sweet and thin, and couldn't save the ""fries"". 

    We love supporting new vegan restaurants, especially in areas where the vegan pop is growing, but VegeNation needs to rethink their menu or retrain their kitchen staff to keep up with much better executed food from other places like Bronze Cafe, Komol Thai, the chicken sandwich from Flippin Burgers, and some other vegan options on the strip.",1v7a1lqFro2MEz1MXihEzA,0,0,2,9-SMgk2xUcokd1w38dvkVw

Went for brunch and got the special, chicken and waffles. IT WAS BOMB. The sauce is perfectly spicy, and the syrup calms everything down. The best vegan chicken and waffles I've had (surprisingly, have tried many), perfect, sturdy, crispy waffles with a patty of 'chicken' which was nicely fried. If you can eat it as a sandwich, I salute you.

My boyfriend liked his African stew/soup as well, and there was enough of it that we had leftovers. Marinating didn't hurt it a bit! Delicious.

Red, our server, was extra nice and friendly, and we really appreciated her no-nonsense style. 

They had the only two brunch cocktails that matter, a simple Bloody Mary & mimosa. Didn't see other alcohol options but this place is really about the food.

It was good and very filling/rich, I think I drank maybe 2/3 of it before it became too much for me. I found it very strange that it was cool (temperature wise) not cold. I'm not super picky so I drank it, but I would have preferred it colder.

My friend got the iced coffee, she enjoyed it and we split the black bean hummus, which was DELICIOUS. I was really skeptical as I enjoy hummus greatly, and I found that I really enjoyed that one. 

The service was wonderful, and they let us sit for a couple hours, we didn't feel rushed to leave or anything. They refilled her coffee a couple times and provided waters with refills. The ambiance was really interesting, it was a really cool place and I would definitely be back to try more of their food rather than just the smoothie and hummus (though again...that hummus was fantastic).",S_7OkmN0BicgWEt2oMmzIQ,1,1,4,39V8tIdXjTlOz2_q--SJuQ

The service was friendly but not over-bearing and the entire meal, including coffee served in its own mini-press that you operate at the table, was 15 bucks. If it didn't seem too weird I would have come back and had the same dish for lunch and dinner, and again the next morning.

I'm not a vegetarian but have to say the food here is very tasty. I ordered a lot for one person, I had a bao wow, the dumplings and the pho king delicious, together with a green machine smoothie and they also gave me a sangria because I checked in on yelp.

Im Vietnamese so i know my ph, and the pho here is probably the best vegetarian pho I've had in my whole life. the broth is just right, very delicious.  I like that the noodle is actually not the typical rice noodle but from the Japanese yam so no bad carbs here. The bao and dumplings are also exceptional, and they got the sauces right for both. 

I think it's a little pricey for what you get but I'm ok with that because the food is nice.

One more thing I wanted to comment here is the service though. Don't get me wrong, it was nice, however I felt like they were rushing me even though I saw lots of other people sitting there with the laptop doing their homework.  I was there also with my phone but I had a feeling they wanted me to leave early maybe it's just my feeling.

5544509,2015-10-23,5,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"My friend and I shared a FANTASTIC meal at VegeNation!  In Los Angeles, we are spoiled with the best vegan restaurants, and we were totally wowed by our meal here!  The ""Real Food Daily"" of Las Vegas.  Please expand to LA!  I would come here all the time.  Big portions, wide variety, delicious food- and prices are reasonable (unlike RFD).

I stumbled across VegeNation on Yelp, and loved how their website described them as passionate about preserving the environment, and creating delicious food for health.  Their chef, who worked in well-known NY restaurants, began experiencing health problems, went vegan, and decided to create a vegan restaurant with all his healthy creations.  (Interestingly enough, this is the same story of another vegan chef, Eric Lachesseur, the classically-trained French chef who opened Seed Kitchen in Venice).  Their menu and website looked really interesting and FUN, with funny named dishes, with some of the most popular items of different cuisines- tacos, bao, quesadilla, tagine, sushi, etc.  I told my friend about this place, and she said she already knew about it and had been wanting to come here- perfect!  

The day we came, there was a chicken and waffle special!  It looked amazing and decadent, but we decided to pass on it.  The d√©cor is casual and made pretty with plants, including a plant wall.  I ordered some coffee, even the coffee is local- the restaurant uses local ingredients as often as possible.  We started with the Bao Wow and the Save The Tuna sushi, the bao might be my favorite thing here!  I haven't had bao since going vegan, or vegetarian even, over 5 years ago.  What a treat!

For our meal, we ordered the Muchas Gracias sweet potato quesadilla, and the Ellen DeGeneres collard wraps.  The wraps were delish, but the quesadilla was the real star.  

For dessert, we had the chocolate tacos, which were inventive, but my least favorite thing here.  It was all about the presentation, with a pastry outside in a taco shape holding chocolate pudding, with berries.  I didn't think the pastry was that great, and the salted caramel was too salty for me.  I think there was a brownie sundae on the menu that I would try next time instead.

VegeNation is such a gem, and I will make this a must-stop on all my future Vegas trips.  VegeNation would really do very well in LA, I think.  It's rare when you find the combination of delicious, healthy, local food in a wide variety, with fun d√©cor, beautiful presentation, nice people, fun environment and specials (DJ's and live music sometimes!), reasonable prices, that takes measures to protect the environment.  What's not to like?!  Only the distance from where I live ;)

Bonus: there are some great outlets 5 minutes away in a cab- vegan food + shopping is a fun, mellow Vegas day in my book!",HduHfYjJUFjQUrrQ1Ets-A,8,6,5,wHeMNeagWEUPyw5EgXy57Q

We had the sushi, meatball sub, sweet potato quesadilla, spaghetti & meatballs and some sort of curry scrambled tofu.  Child felt the meatballs were too spicy to eat (he's picky, however).  Sushi was colorful, beautifully presented and pretty good. The meatball sub was pretty good as was the sweet potato quesadilla.  The smoothies were well received. The lemonade had chia in it, which one of the kids didn't care for. 

We sat at the community table which was cool. The atmosphere is great. They had live music during our Sunday afternoon visit. Music was good & not too loud to enjoy conversation.

I heard nothing but good things about this place and the pictures were so convincing. 
I came here last Saturday for a quick bite to eat. It's adorable inside; industrial like feel with wood and metal pieces and an awesome wall of green. The hostess greeted us and said she will be right with us. I then noticed that she was playing buser as well as we waited. We were a party of 5 and didn't want to sit at the high tops because of my grandfather so we were okay with waiting for a larger table. We finally got seated by our server. The table had 1 menu and no silverware. It took about 10 minutes just to get water, again being brought out by the hostess. Our server, Letitia, I believe was her name, was AWESOME! She was full of life, energy and humor! She came to get our orders and was disappointed to find out by 11:30 the jackfruit tacos were sold out! I don't have a background in food purchasing but would hope people see trends in particular orders and would stock it accordingly. I was disappointed but moved on to my second choice Ellen Tacos. Food came out as it was ready, starting with the dumplings. This hostess was an all in one, she was now bringing out our food which she spilt soy sauce all over the table. It was clear that this establishment was extremely understaffed. I even got up to get the table 5 sets of silverware! 
The food though was okay! The tacos had a lot of flavoring and crunch. The mixture was a blend of nuts. If you have consistency phobia I recommend staying away. It was almost like a tuna fish texture to a sense. But my absolute favorite was the sweet potato quesadilla! It's that sweeter option entry as to why I was only able to eat it as an appetizer. 
Although they need to focus on staffing and food inventory this place is still a must try and to at least say you tried it.",IY0zs4-DzwRs_W2NOYtz3Q,0,0,3,KUSn0s1CVrfvFkUUFC2BNg

The large plate glass windows look out onto Carson Street and the surrounding city-scape.  I started off with the Cylon Tea with a hint of mango:  It was delicious without any added sugar (which is the entire point).  I must of asked 10 questions of my server and other team members in the first 5 minutes.  They were all very knowledgeable with the menu and answered my questions thoroughly and patiently.  They were all terrific.  

Although I had a tough time deciding on what I wanted, I finally decided on the Thai Curry Vegetable Bowl.  When it arrived, the sweet potato noodles were swimming in a think curry sauce.  Zucchini, sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, and other vegetables topped off the dish.  Although a lime squeeze was available, I decided to just dig in.  OMG, it was incredible.  The blend of the curry sauce, vegetables and noodles was a hit. 

As a side note, the table across from me ordered the black bean burger.  I have no idea how it may taste; however, it looked hearty and was served with a few (what appeared to be) large cut fries.

5603165,2015-06-27,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"O how I love this place.

I've been vegan for about 6 months now, and was really excited when I saw this place was about to open.  Me and the GF have eaten here atleast once a week every week, and I think we have had everything except the desserts and one of the tacos.  I'm going to start with a general overview, and later in this review break down some specific dishes that I love, and some that I'm not such a huge fan of.

When you first walk in you are greeted by an always smiling face.  Most of the time it's a very nice gal, I think her name is Erin.  She is always willing to work with us on seating because I don't like sitting with my back to people.  The art is mostly vegan inspired, and it was great to see some local art, especially the stuff from recycled propiganda.  I love their stuff and have several of their pieces in my collection.  A wall covered in vines spills out as a reminder of how beautiful plan based foods are, proudly displaying their logo in the middle.  When thus place first opened the wait staff was a little sketchy.  I understand new reasurant, and all, this however doesn't excuse the rookie mistakes from the wait staff.  Waiting 10 minutes of drinks, and forgotten waters was common, and lack of menue knowlage was also rather common.  I think the chef may have resolved this now, but most of the time we just ask for Art to serve us if he is working.  He is truly a master of the craft attentive, but not invasive.  Funny, but not over bearing.  I have tried to phone in Togo orders on gallery nights when we were trolling around 18b, with mixed results.  Sometimes the phone just rings and rings, other times a smiling voice greats you.

The food is 100 percent plant based, with some gluten free options.

Save the Tuna- A vegan take on sushi that is a must try if your a first timer.  Chef nailed it on this dish.  Perfectly balanced and portioned.  I say try it with out the soy sauce first, than just a quick dip if you still think it needs it.  The forbidden rice adds color and incredable flavor that contrasts the veg caviar it is topped with.  It sells out every night, so get in early if you want this.

Steamed mushroom dumplings - vegan pot stickers.  I hear these recently went under a change, they were okay, nothing to write home about.  Texture was nice with the mushrooms adding a nutty flavor.  I haven't tried the updated version, but the presentation in a bambo steam basket was the best part of these.  Go with the save the tuna.

Bow wow- WTF is this?  It was good, but not great the steamed puff that these...  almost taco on a cream puff things came out on looks great, taste and texture...  not so much.  Steer clear of these weird kind of soggy and sweet things.

Mexican Hummus- hummus with black beans and blue tortia chips.  Umm... winning...  I've been trying to recreate this at home, and been failing miserably for weeks.  Chef don has really done fusion right here.  Tangy and both hummus and black beans at the same time make this a winner.  I have ordered this 5 times now and one time got a weird batch.  A meal can be made with just this and the save the tuna if you only want some lighter fair.

Pizzas- using daiya cheese is hard.  To much and it's a gooey mess, to little and it lacks flavor.  We have done a half tomato basil and half mushroom pie here a few times and it can be absolutely incredable, or a soggy mess.  Most of the time it's a 10, one time we got soggy mess.  Don't let that stop you from trying this.  Super thin crust is great, and just how I like my pie.

Sweet potato black bean quesadilla- I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatos, but saw this on a neibohor's table and decided to try it.  I was hoping for more black beans and less sweet potato (personal preferance).  Texture was great and it was topped with a cashew queso that is a staple in my house. If you like sweet taters, this will be a great dish for you.

Meatball grinder - This is my go to. I love this sandwich more than anything.  It's a normal style hoggie bread, with Gardaen Meatballs and marinara topped off with some dayia motz.  Side of fries and home made ketchup round out this plate.  If your a meat eater (I'll lecture you later) and your friends drag you here...  the gradaen meatless meat balls and better than the real thing.  Stick with this and than later we can watch some Gary Yorofski videos to make you go veg too.

Mama Mia - Pasta with marinara was good, a touch watery as most reasurant marinara is for some odd reason but delicious to the end, and topped with some of the awesome Gardean meatballs.  (Wish I had some nutritional yeast to top this off like parm.  Actually maybe every table should have a Nutch shaker...)

Smoothies are a little soy milk heavy, I think it's to ease the blending and get them done faster.  Very smooth and delicious.  Rookie waiter said it was a vitamix in back, than I saw a blendtec pitcher one day...  not sure which they use but both are too end blenders.

5628844,2018-02-24,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,Service was terrible. Our party had a reservation for two weeks and when we arrived they did not have any record and blamed it on the hostess. The manager did not come talk to us and they sat us separately. Our group was able to accommodate ourselves together at a larger community table after other customers left. They still wanted to charge us for a group gratuity and did nothing to make us feel welcomed or comfortable. We spoke to the manager upon request and she was not professional in any way. She did not seem concerned about pleasing her customers and tried to validate their faults with us choosing no gratuity versus getting appetizers and drinks on the house and didn't not confirm which one we would get.

The waitress was nice to tell us that they have breakfast special: Chickn N Waffle.  Oh my!  I have heard about this dish.  Vegans that go to Wynn shared pictures of this dish.  However, Wynn hotel restaurants are just too expensive for us.

I decided to order it.  It was DELICIOUS!   Also the portion was big.  The side dish was yummy potatoes.  I almost could not finish it.  

Hubby ordered French Toast and that too was a big portion.  It was topped with fruit and he loved the sauce on the side.

5659566,2015-04-14,5,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"Not everything tastes as good as it looks, which is exactly the case at Vegenation.

The employees are courteous, young, and friendly. The decor is spot on, with wooden accents and a green garden wall. The menu is concise and so very visually appealing. Everything is picture perfect.

Unfortunately, picture perfect doesn't cut it for me. I have two main gripes with this place:

1) The menu items are slightly overpriced for what you get. Not so much that it's outrageous, but just enough to make you wonder why that pasta dish wasn't the best pasta dish you've had all year.

2) The dishes were all wonderfully creative and beautifully presented, but every single one was missing something. They were good but just not very special. 

Here's a rundown of what we got:

Downtown Tony (portobello mushroom sliders with a side of potato wedges and sriracha aioli) - mushroom flavored/cooked well, potato wedges ok, aioli pretty good, buns left something to be desired

Gotta Get Over the Hemp - tasted very average, sauce was good but nothing too special, pasta cooked well

Chocolate Tacos - salted caramel tasted weird, taco shell tasted so stale that at one point I thought I was consuming plastic, the cinnamon(?) and coconut did not compliment the chocolate or berries at all

Jamaican Hibiscus Punch - tart, slightly sweet, salty, spicy, and watered down. At least there were free refills?

I'll come back and try Vegenation again, but for now, it is just too expensive for the amount and flavor you get.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,9,4,3,BhWHXItuhAX1MPe25HbX0Q

5674750,2015-07-10,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"The mock sushi tricked your mind into thinking you were eating at a five-star sushi restaurant. Thickly sliced red bell pepper was the replacement for ahi tuna, and surprisingly, it worked! Avocado gave the roll creaminess that it desperately needed. The vegetables were rolled in nori and red rice, and served with wasabi cream, sweet potato pur√©e, and toasted white and black sesame seeds.
     The vegetable tacos were tasted very organic and clean. The filling had the texture of shredded tofu and the flavor of hemp milk, which is a very sweet ""milk"" made of seeds. Then, the filling was scooped into three flour tortillas. Guacamole generously topped each gorgeous taco. Even though it had the texture of baby food, it was jam packed with the flavors of earthy cilantro and smoky grilled jalape√±os. 
     My yam stew was bursting with earthy flavors that I absolutely adore, such as sweet potatoes, grilled peppers, chickpeas, and roasted peanuts. The ingredients were doused with a spicy peanut sauce that tasted like a thinner version of nd√≥mbe. Nd√≥mbe is Cameroonian condiment made of palm tree butter. However, the raisins gave the dish an unnecessary sweetness that made my mouth longing for water. 
     The penne with hemp pesto was satisfactory. Pasta is very easy thing to cook, however, the pasta at VegeNation was slightly overdone. Therefore, the pasta had no texture which resulted in a flat dish. Luckily, the pesto had a fabulous texture which masked the overcooked texture of the pasta.
     Overall, I'm sure every carnivore out there  would enjoy VegeNation because of its diverse menu and eclectic decor.",H4maWgOBeeW7xSYu_cYhcg,2,2,4,F1Nl3g44PP-_t_pWWUS6SQ

We decided to order a bunch of starters to share. We went with the bao wow, Mexican hummus and hot tamale.

Bao wow-Asian bbq tofu with spinach and mushroom in a bao bun. The sauce and the bao were great. I wasn't too much of a fan cause of the mushroom they use but it was a big hit for the group. 

Mexican hummus-this thing was delicious. It was a chipotle lime black bean hummus with blue corn tortilla chips. I can eat this for days. It was creamy and perfect blend together. 

Hot tamale-organic masa, pumpkin green chilis, and lentils. My favorite of the day. I love tamales in general so there is no surprise, I was a big fan of this. 

Muchos gracias-I decided to choose this as my entree. It was organic sweet potato quesadilla black beans and chipotle crema. This dish you really have to love sweet potato. There was tons of it. I think it would be perfect to share but not as your own dish. The quesadilla was wonderful but after two pieces, I was totally over it. Too much of one thing going on.

$42.62 got us some spaghetti and meatballs for the boy, an orange smoothie, a greek salad, a dumpling appetizer, and a quesadilla.

$6.00 Orange burst smoothie- Consists of orange, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and pineapple. It is served in a cute mason jar which is appropriate because it tastes just like a scented candle.  
.
Sadly they were all out of the ""save the tuna"" vegan sushi so we had to settle for the My Little Dumpling appetizer for $6.95. The steamed shiitake & spinach dumplings were served in an adorable bamboo steamer basket.  I very much enjoyed these.  They are served with chopsticks and a tasty soy-based dipping sauce. 
.
$10.95 Muchas Gracias- Organic sweet potato quesadilla with black beans and chipotle crema.  Husband quite enjoyed this.  It was served very hot and fresh.  
.
$10.95 Greek salad- Has feta, kale, romaine, red peppers, green peppers, onions, vinagrette, olives, and oddly enough- tortilla chips.  I found the tortilla chips to be out of place in a greek salad but I enjoyed the vegan feta cheese more than I thought I would.  
.
$7.00 Chocolate tacos- Delicate crunchy pastry shell with chocolate goop, chopped strawberries, coconut, more mystery goop on top, and HUGE PIECES OF ROCK SALT...like the kind you use to make ice cream! I liked everything but the ginormous hunks of salt, which, according to our waitress and the chef, are supposed to be in there.  I sincerely hope nobody loses a tooth eating one of these.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off our bill.

That's alright because I didn't have ""mushroom"" in my tummy for dessert anyways.

As are the Italian Dumplings which are sweet potato pecan ravioli in a buerre-blanc-ish sauce with asparagus and radicchio.  They serve kombucha which is not made in house but is also always tasty.  The dessert tacos are cute and tasty.  The vanilla ice cream is the best I have ever had.  Affordable and convenient kids menu too!  Most kids dishes are $3.95!! Can't beat it.
    They are 100% vegan.  They support local businesses.  They get involved with the community.  They have a hip urban vibe.  Non-gmo and organic abundance.

My husband Joe L. and I visited for brunch on our last day in LV before heading home from an action-packed weekend. We had wanted to come for dinner the night before but they were experiencing a power outage due to a bad storm that had just dumped buckets of rain on the area along with thunder and lightning. Someone from the restaurant was nice enough to call me on my cell to inform me what was going on, and we were able to cancel our reservation without problem. 

When we walked into the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, I was immediately impressed with the decor and vibe: tons of plants hanging from the ceiling, long wooden tables, nice decor, and a mellow but hip atmosphere. Yup, it definitely felt more hip than hippie to me, and that made it feel more upscale and quaint. Apparently they also have a beautiful outdoor patio, but there was a private party going on so we didn't get to see it on the day we visited. There was also a talented singer/guitarist performing which provided good if not a bit too loud entertainment and ambiance.

Our server was so sweet, helpful, and friendly, and we were quickly hooked up with a large French press pot of delicious coffee. I ordered off-menu (thanks, Yelp!) chicken and waffles and hubby got the meatball grinder. We also ordered a save the tuna roll as an appetizer. 

As we were waiting for our food, gorgeous plates of pizza, sandwiches, salads, and other items passed us by making us even hungrier. As soon as our save the tuna rolls came, we quickly devoured them. They were flavorful yet light, and each one was topped with what I think was described as a smoked carrot puree. It was creative, beautiful, and very good.

Our main courses came out shortly after. The meatball grinder was phenomenal! The meatballs were chewy and meaty, and the tomato sauce was perfectly seasoned. The crispy yet chewy roll was toasted just right, and the whole thing was topped with melted parmesan cheese. I would think any meat eater would be happy eating this sandwich, and it hit all the right spots for a vegetarian like me. Sandwich perfection, indeed!

The chicken and waffles was another winner. The fluffy waffles were smeared with a spicy chipotle (I think) mayo and topped with large crispy chicken pieces. It was served with the requisite cup of maple syrup. Talk about hearty food! I could barely eat 1/4 of this dish because it was so filling and satiating. 

We were ready to call it quits but had already taken advantage of the sweet Yelp check-in deal of a free sundae. Seriously, who can say no to free ice cream?? It too was awesome! Topped with a crunchy toffee or granola of some kind and drizzled with syrup and fruit, it was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.

I didn't like the taste of the jack fruit and the bbq it was seasoned with (and neither did the people I was with that tried it).  My friend had the mushroom pizza, which was decent, but would've been much better if they used something other than Daiya cheese.  Daiya, in my opinion (and many others) is the bottom of the barrel.  There are so many other much better tasting vegan cheeses out there like Follow your Heart or Chao.  I don't see why any restaurant would use it other than because it's cheap.  My husband had the meatball parmesan sub, which was good, but these aren't homemade, they are outsourced.  The chicken that they use is not homemade either.  It's ""Gardein"" brand...which again, is bottom of the barrel and not a healthy option (soy protein isolate).  The waffles were really good, those seem to be made in-house.  The dessert that we all split was amazing.  It was a donut topped with icecream and it was delicious.  That was the best part of the lunch.   All in all, I think if they made more homemade quality food, this place would be awesome.  I'm from NJ and have tried many Vegan places, including By Chloe in NY, and this place just doesn't come close to the quality of food I've had at any of the places.  I come to Vegas every year and get amazing vegan food at the mainstream restaurants, so I probably won't be returning to this all Vegan restaurant (unfortunately).  I do hope that the restaurant reads my review and takes it constructively and makes some changes.  Homemade food is key.  If they use Gardein and outsource meatballs (one of the easiest and most delicious things to make vegan) I can only imagine what else is outsourced.",C4C-uhRT0vY7eiv3rq4sJg,4,0,2,glC4qDQVgD56Wi93l6dPLg

Vegenation is exactly what Las Vegas has need for what feels like an eternity. Not only is this restaurant 100% plant based, the Chef/owner is a classically trained professional Chef. This, my friends, is the real deal all the way. 

The menu has a great variety of options ranging from sushi to tamales to pizza, and everything else in between. It's great if you're like me and cannot decide what cuisine sounds good at the moment (you can have them all!). 

The food is great, does not have that typical ""vegan"" flavor (braggs, fake meat, etc.), and will satisfy even the most discerning of omnivores. I simply cannot recommend this wonderful gem enough. What are you waiting for, try it out already!!",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,4,3,5,SDt4N368WYXZojJURWeQ3w

5778267,2018-02-14,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,I've been meaning to post this for a while. Simply the best vegan food I have ever had. Was in Vegas for a week and I was working from my hotel room so I looked for a vegan restaurant that would deliver. I happened upon VegeNation and ordered a Negrano (a meatball sub named for the poker player). It was so good that I had to call the restaurant and confirm that it was indeed vegan (and not vegetarian).  It honestly tasted like real cheese! The next day I ventured to the actual restaurant for lunch and had the chicken pot pie. It was better than any real chicken pot pie I had ever had. They nailed both the taste and the texture of the food. I ended up eating here every day for the remainder of my trip. Weekend brunch features outstanding chicken and waffles. One day I had an eggplant lasagna. I tried the pot sticker appetizer. A few of the deserts. EVERYTHING was fantastic. If I could rate this 10 stars I would. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

5820924,2016-02-17,2,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I've been wanting to go here forever.. I'm talking months ago! 
and since it is a little out of my way, I decided to just go by myself. 
And too bad it was a little disappointing! 


The food is pretty good, I'm used to paying more for vegan food and this place, expect to spend at least $11 a dish for entrees. They have a good selection of appetizers to salads, juices and desserts. 

I got a few food and just really wanted to try a bit of everything. I ate one thing and boxed everything else. 

I tried the save the tuna as an appetizer,
Carne Asada tacos, East West Tacos, Italian Dumplings and Chocolate Tacos. 
The tacos was definitely filling, I had one and I was already feeling full but my favorite was Italian dumplings. They're a little small but so good! The East West Tacos were my least favorite. It was super soggy and didn't think it was any special.. Which was a bummer cause it was the one I've been wanting to try! The dessert was yummy They are so tiny! So I feel a little good about that but not the price, for $7 a little pricey! I know overall it was good and my brothers are excited for me to give them the left overs.

Let's talk about service.. Man, I hate bashing on servers but it was ridiculous. My server was inattentive and never smiled nor greeted me. It didn't look too busy but I tried to be positive that she might be. But I was just ignored a lot, I mean.. I was in a back table. 
I was greeted by a nice lady and she was nice enough to let me sit on a table by a plug so I can charge my phone. I was going to skype with my friend who lives in Taipei . He has been wanting to see the place since I've been talking to him about how cool this place looks. But idk if it's just my phone but it was having a hard time with the internet, as soon as I left it was fine. I actually couldn't even check in on Yelp till I got out. 

Anyways, I tried to ask for silverware but my server left.. She literally would drop off food and not spend less than 2 seconds on my table. I didn't even have enough time to tell her that I wanted to modify my food... She didn't tell me any specials (Taco Tuesday 's Pop up Carne Asada) I couldn't decide on the Italian dumpling or East West Taco so I turned to my server's opinion but she just said it depends on what I want. (Okayyyy, err helpful?) 
She said her favorite was the dumplings.. But she didn't even tell me what was in it or anything about the Carne Asada, which I was curious what was actually in it since all it said on the Pop up special board was ""Carne Asada"" and she left. I had no silver, no napkins.. After trying to flag down 4 servers I got up and went to the station and grab my own damn napkin. Like I said, I was trying a few dishes and taking it home for my brothers but I didn't appreciate how they put the rest of my order in to go boxes. I wanted to sit there longer and actually enjoy my food.. A different server was close by and I ordered the dessert since my server dropped off my food in a to go container with the check. By that time I was just okay, this blows. I just ate my tiny dessert and paid.

Total was $51.67 but I did get 3 entrees, 1 app and 1 dessert. The dessert should definitely cost less... All 3 tacos would have fit on my palm. 


Parking: It was $1 = 15 mins, I guess there's a pro in my bad service otherwise I would have gotten a fine. I was sitting in the parking lot as I type this and a security personnel told me I was overtime. So make sure you put enough time! Definitely strict about paying the meter. 

Anyways, I would have given this place a 4 star because the food is good, the atmosphere is nice and the place looks clean and very trendy. But alas, service does make a huge difference.

To be perfectly honest, when I had watched some vlogs or reviews of this restaurant on social media or youtube I had really high expectations for the food. Vloggers really overhyped this restaurant, possibly for more exposure. We visited on Sunday June 25th, lovely atmosphere, great sounding live acoustic guitar singer, air conditioning, and really clean! The restaurant was not too busy, and service was good.

I was craving desserts and wanted to try the tamales so here are some concise reviews on the various items my family and I tried...

Tamales 3.5/5, Amazing but pricey..for two micro-mini tamales. Came nice and warm, yummy masa, reminded me of meat tamales I used to have! Would recommend if you miss tamales!

Black bean hummus and chips 5/5, Yummy! Try this because it is so tasty! More chips please!

Blueberry Cheesecake 1/5, Ehhh, aesthetically pleasing nevertheless it was ehh and gritty. 

Carrot cake 000000/5, No. Pretty, but NO. I am not totally sure if this was supposed to be a raw vegan carrot cake, but being frank, it was pretty much just the carrot grinds that were a result of juiced carrots, put together in a small cake form with cinnamon to resemble a carrot cake. Cashew creme frosting was ehh, gritty though. Expensive for not reason. Gag worthy...

Tiramisu 3/5. Yummy cause it had notes of coffee. I added some of my cold brew to it and it made it a 4/5 hahahha, would recommend adding more chocolate and coffee to this though. I enjoyed this!

I also had a black cold brew (Free refills), which was really excellent and perfectly strong AND kept me hyped all day!

If you are vegan or a curious omnivore in the Vegas area I would say give it a go, try it out. Most likely going to skip this on my next vegas visit. But, it was a good experience.",Xe0QhhscowwsUoPBcipoag,0,0,3,C0VjtoZLa27ptuUoEp_Umg

This is a bigger bowl than photos make it seem, so it's best to order this if you're hungry or sharing. Second, I got the faux fish tacos. They had that nice deep fried flavor, though slightly dry.

atmosphere and service: i really love when a place plays great music, and this place did! the layout is simple, clean, and there is even outside seating. the entire experience was very calm and comfortable which i appreciated. almost every person working in the building approached my table to see how things were going. i could tell that everyone really cared about my experience.

drinks: the ""jamaican passion iced tea"" was to die for! it was very...unique, but in the best way! i have never had an iced tea so different and so perfectly blended.

appetizers: i do not like forbidden rice, but fell in love with the ""save the tuna"" roll. 

overall, an amazing dining experience.",Qam8ZxHCH-jPCMq0HQbQ7Q,2,1,5,Ql3BPSTb1FHAHpMv3w_PBA
5975386,2017-02-07,1,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"We love Vegenation. They always have a ""daily special"" and the prices are really reasonable. First time I came the service was very slow, but today it was completely opposite. Our server was very knowledgeable and seemed really into the food and had a ton of recommendations. This place is truly a Vegans Paradise. 

My biggest gripe about this place (and why there is only 4 stars) is there is not a baby changing table in the restroom, I probably never looked before but when your kid goes.......you gotta do what you gotta do. Seriously I think it should be illegal not to have a changing table. If you have a kids menu, you should have a changing table! End of story!! Also, parking-another gripe! I hate having to pay the parking meters to go have lunch. Although i understand it's not the restaurants fault, it is a pain (and those meter maids are not slacking)......probably the reason i have only been here twice.",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,1,1,4,PQZPHwSocD-BTshNM0Iiyw
5979609,2015-05-27,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"I found Vegenation while looking for vegan options other than my usual Wynn restaurants and I am SO glad I did!  

My husband and I went around 7pm on Memorial Day.  I was afraid it would be hard to find parking, but we easily found a spot right in front of the restaurant and headed in.  

The hostess was friendly and offered us indoor or outdoor patio seating.  We chose indoor.  I love the aesthetic of the restaurant!  The tables, lighting, plants, everything.  Our server quickly came over to greet us and take our drink order.  My husband ordered the Jamaican Hibiscus Punch and it was AMAZING!  Perfect blend of sweet and a slight savory-ness to it.  Since it was our first time dining here, we asked the server for his suggestions on what to order.  He was very knowledgable and definitely steered us in a great food direction.  

Onto the food...
-For appetizers we had the Mexican Hummus and Hot Tamales.  Both were amazing!  I was actually really shocked at how great both were.  The tamales had the perfect blend of spices.  
-For one entree we went for the East West Tacos which were bbq jackfruit.  My husband who is usually a carnivore, was severely impressed by these!  Texture was great and the flavor was fantastic!  Homemade tortillas.  Total score.  
-Our other entree was the Casa Blanca.  Quinoa and Moroccan spiced veggies.  The spices were great.  Good amount of heat, but not too overpowering.  I make a lot of dishes like this at home and I was still impressed. 

Food and service were both fantastic.  Good prices.  I love that everything is non GMO!  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!",5jZCm98_09LCqJL7WULqgg,4,0,5,DUyhYjzUgMFRZFNvaMvjNQ
5980031,2016-06-24,0,2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw,"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  What is there not to love?  The decor is so lively and vibrant, service is speedy, staff are friendly, prices are affordable & food is excellent.  I sneak out of work and go to VegeNation on my lunch break quite frequently, and they always get my food out to me in what seems to be only about 5 minutes, making it an awesome lunch spot.  My favorite menu items have got to be the appetizers, specifically the Bao Wow, Save the Tuna, & Mexican Hummus (which is a generous portion!)  My favorite entrees are The VegeNation Burger (seriously one of the best vegan burgers), & Muchas Gracias.  For a more light, healthy meal the Pamela Anderson raw tacos are flavorful and refreshing.  If you happen to go for breakfast, hands down you've got to try their Food Not Bombs breakfast bowl, it is one of my favorite breakfast items ever!  And last for dessert I recommend the cheese plate, which is locally made by Virgin Cheese, check out their Facebook page for more info on the cheese!",2rIOC06QezS71w5Evh_z9w,1,1,5,zZUhVpcwE5jmWbKNuWWPkg
