The staff was great...super friendly and made a great sandwhich. I know it's Subway but it wasn't overloaded to where all the toppings where falling out.

The bad is that only 1 person was making the subs while the other waited at the cash register. Keep in mind there were 10+ people waiting behind me. The 2 teens working barely communicated. One more thing, they did not have any meatballs in stock. I ended up going home with no dinner for my son and wife. :/

Where's management to step in to get this place back up and running right.

Only reason they are busy is it's the nearest subway in providence!",V-RwGHZrv6al02iok25NYw,0,0,1,lNVGvB4hLfr-g6flUYom_g

A friendly suggestion to the managers of this franchise location: you may want to hire another sandwich artist!  My visit today was during the lunch hour and there were 6 or 7 people ahead of me in the queue.  The two staff members were not the fastest, nor the friendliest, and all told, it took almost half an hour from placing my order to receiving my food.

My boyfriend stops by a lot here and they never have meatballs sandwich for him. They always have 2 people working so therefore it's always busy when I have came and I'm here for at least 20 min in line. They need to hire more staff or open another fast food place around this area. I hate coming in here and waiting 30 min for my food. Very disappointing.
