5182,2014-07-02,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"We went to Nine Fine twice this trip and experienced two different atmospheres.  

Our first trip there was for lunch during a FIFA match (Bavaria/ Korea).  They did have minimum purchase requirements for seating which is understandable for a big sporting event.  The service was prompt and left us alone to watch the game.  My wife had the fish and chips which was fantastic.  The fish was thick filets and perfectly cooked.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I'm hooked.  I'm no shepherd's pie expert, but it was a fantastic dish.

We went back the next night just for a drink.  We didn't expect more than the ambience that we experienced during the FIFA match and we were wrong.  Ri Ra, what I gathered was band that plays there regularly, was playing and they were quite good.  We stayed and had a few pints (I recommend the Black Smith), watched the Irish dancing and listened to the band.  The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  Even though the bar was busy, the server's were spot on and never seemed rushed.

All-in-all, a great experience.",ofyvktJU3HEFpcSKaWEhNA,0,0,4,jGvmnO-xmEuwI7iU_a4fDg

We were even running late and I called so they wouldn't give the table away, which they appreciated.  

A couple of things happened that prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  First off the reason I booked this place was because of the live music on Saturday nights.  Well, we must have been there too early because they had the ball game on instead.  Second, we ordered 3 drinks from the bar.  My friend got his right away but my boyfriend and I didn't even get our Guinnesses until after we got our meal 20 minutes later and that was after we reminded our server that we still needed our drinks.

As tends to be my Vegas fare (think: too hung over to eat real food), I ordered a salad and shared a turkey and corn chowder with a friend, based upon the recommendation of our server. Despite the fact that I came in wearing a sparkly dress, 5"" heels and hair that had clearly not been brushed, this waitress welcomed me with warmth and no evident judgment (look, I was judging myself by the way I appeared). She listed the specials and was understanding when we required more time to make decisions.

When the soup came out, we were surprised by how filling and delicious it was. Two of my friends ordered shepherd's pies, the other a sandwich she didn't even touch. All of us were pleased with our food, which was reasonably priced for being on the strip. The service was prompt and our server kept returning to check in on us and insure we were having the best possible experience.

We sat outside, so missed the Irish experience. Loud pop music (though this is everywhere on the strip). We sat for 15 minutes before our server acknowledged us, then finally got our drink order taken. It was now 6:20 p.m. and we advised our server that we needed to be done by 7:30 for a show in the hotel (New York New York). We anticipated an hour and a half would be enough time for pub fare and a drink. We were wrong - should have known when it took so long to even get our drinks.

The baked brie was barely warmed. The cheese, in fact, was still hard and cold inside. The green beans were cold. My friends said their meals were just okay, even for pub fare. My wings, as I stated earlier, were excellent. Note that a meal does not include any sides (e.g. vegetable or otherwise - you get, say, a piece of salmon and that is all on you plate unless you pay for more). We were barely attended to during the meal and asked repeatedly for our bill.

It was after 7:30 and we were watching our server provide bills to customers who had arrived after us and also take new orders, though it wasn't particularly busy. I approached our server at the server's station to remind her that we needed our bill. She barked ""I'm doing the best I can"" at me. Yet still no bill.

We were a table of six. Not demanding, except for the need for our bill at the end. There is a gratuity of 18% added automatically if there is a table of six or more. That would be fine if we had good service and individual bills. The best she could do was subtotal into five. And there were errors, so check your bills carefully. 

And then we ran to our show.",xnMMoe_6H-KYlOfnKQY2dg,0,0,1,0uKFwGAyYeu8HOsPhgh3nw

My husband and I went to Nine Fine Irishmen on July 5. I ordered the lamb stew and a glass of water, and my husband ordered the shepherd's pie and a glass of Guinness. We're were both a little put off that the food came in dented metal bucket's and both commented how my stew was more of a soup with a watery broth, but the food smelled good so we ate it. My stew did taste good. Another off-putting thing was that the dim lights made me mistake a large chunk of ""something"" for cauliflower. It was not cauliflower. Whatever it was dissolved as soon as I closed my mouth, so I couldn't even spit it out. Still, nothing was too bad, probably a three star rating experience. Then, I woke up at about 4 am with horrible sharp pains in my stomach, followed by hours of all the disgusting symptoms of food poisoning. Thankfully, we are here visiting my parents, so I spent my sickness at my parents' home and not a hotel. Still, food poisoning is a terrible thing. I spent half of the day incredibly sick to the point where I was so dehydrated that my hands and feet cramped into painful immovable positions, and I had to be feed ice chips of Pedialyte to rehydrate me because I couldn't even keep down fluids.

162377,2010-10-20,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I have a feeling the family and I came here on an off night recently during our Vegas vacation. For me, the best part of dinner was my Black and Tan. For my wife, it was probably the Heirloom Tomato Salad. The rest of the meal was pretty forgettable. 

Here's what we ordered:

Guinness braised beef and mushroom pies with tomato relish and chive dressing -- nothing I would order again...pretty bland...not what we were expecting.

Heirloom tomatoes with goat, blue and farmhouse cheeses marinated in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar -- probably our favorite part of the night...nice tomatoes and cheeses...pretty yummy.

Cashel Blue cheese crusted NY strip with au jus -- this was a disaster...ordered it medium rare, but it came out well done...sent it back and as I jokingly predicted to my wife that it would come back to rare because the cook would be too afraid to over cook it again...unfortunately, I was right...second steak came back black 'n blue...looked almost like a piece of seared ahi...but hell, it was better than an overcooked piece of meat, but much to rare for my taste...we ate a little bit of it and left the rest.

This is a cool place and I'd definitely go back for drinks. For lunch or dinner...probably not again after this experience.",JTW6dZCeGaZgfwedA3yFKA,0,0,2,JyWlBq41AIaex4eNq98xqg
164616,2014-01-12,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"First, atmosphere is great. Very cozy and comfortable whether you are at the bar, a high top, table, or outside (whether thats outside the bar inside the casino, or outside the casino itself on LVB).  Bartenders are friendly & fast.  I like their selection of beers on tap & the drink menu. The Dubliner, btw, is THE best, sour apple martini I've ever had!!

Second, Darryl is just amazing.  Ireland's loss is definitely Vegas' gain. Unlike some performers on the Strip, he's not pretentious, is friendly, and will stop for a quick chat during breaks. The entire band performs well together & they are some of the most talented musicians I've seen. I really like that if you step outside there are speakers so you can still hear the music during your ciggy/cigar break. 

Third, the food. Not terribly impressed.  Whether its actual Irish fare I don't know. What I do know is that the menu is terribly overpriced.  $21.95 for fish & chips, presented in an upright wired cone basket. There was way more batter than fish & at times it tasted as if the fish wasn't fried long enough.  There is nothing special here...even with lemon, ketchup, malt vinegar, it was still bland.  All in all, it wasn't anything you couldn't get at Yard House or for $10 at the fish & chip shack in the food court at NY NY.

Fourth, I've been a server so I can speak to this. I found none of the servers to be ""ok."" Our server rarely checked on us. We were constantly having to flag her down for drinks and then wait, and wait, and wait some more, for her return.  I was still working on my meal when she attempted to take my plate...without asking.  Granted, she was very nice, but just bc you're really nice doesn't mean you're good at your job.

Fifth, I made reservations. One of the hostesses flat out lied to me, was not friendly, and just made one excuse after another. And I called her on it.  Upon arrival I requested a specific table and was told it was reserved for a large party. Fine, I get it. Until she sat the 2 guys in line behind me without reservations at the table I just asked for. (There were 3 in my party.)

If you are looking for a place to hang out, have a few HALF pints, and dance (or watch others dance) a jig & take in some great live music, this place is it. Unlike The Bar at Times Square where you must exit the bar to use the restroom, Nine Fine has them. Outdoor seating is quite spacious & there is a full bar there as well so you don't have to shuffle in/out for drinks.

I gave this place 3 stars bc of the food & service alone; otherwise, 5 stars.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,1,3,HeydAQQPhdY2e3ZCvbuRzg

Normally, the place is wonderful, the drinks and appetizers are wonderful, and we really enjoy the live music. The staff has always been very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our night.

However, our last visit forced me to drop it down at least one star, and considered dropping it two.
The hostesses were very cold, making us feel like they were doing us a favor even speaking to us. We were seated out in the ""patio"" area, which means out by the casino floor. This was ok. We wanted to chat with a business associate, so this worked for us.

Our waitress was TERRIBLE - bossy, rude, and very condensing. Her attitude made us want to leave very quickly, and we will probably request another waitress/waiter on our next visit (which is something we normally would never do)

Where do I start? Their steaks are delicious and juicy and they have probably the best bread pudding I have ever had.  Not to mention the amazing live music that starts at 9pm! Definitely not your typical, on the strip, restaurant. The place is lively, dim-lit, and I always see people having a good time when they are here. I make it a point to go here every time i'm in Vegas.

If you pick a seat with a view of the balcony and the stage, you'll be set for some good ol' fashioned Irish folk dancing and tunes by the Nine Fine Irishmen (Yes, this place is named after the amazing band that plays here)

He said he was never told about that option and didn't have a way to ring it up on his computer and offered to show me his computer. I declined anything further and paid for my one drink. I've never been argued with before much less have to get up and prove my point. I told him he didn't have to argue or be mean but apparently being right was way more on his mind tonight.

We were seated upstairs which would have been no big deal except we were the only ones sitting there with empty tables downstairs. No band playing as it was a weeknight but EXTREMELY  loud Irish music was playing non-stop on our floor with the second bar.  I can only guess it was so they could hear it downstairs but we literally could not hold a conversation at the table. After awhile I just wanted to flee the place as it gave me an actual headache by the time we left. We literally could not wait to leave....  Unfortunately, this also took much longer than we would have liked because the food service was painfully slow once our order was placed.  We received water which was never refilled and not another drop of anything liquid was offered after we declined cocktails initially. The food itself was good enough, unfortunately we were so uncomfortable due to the noise level it was hard to enjoy.  The food is why they got 3 stars.  Otherwise service=1, atmosphere=1.  Probably would be fine if you were a loud, boisterous drunk that was here to drink and have an appetizer only - if not, I would patronize somewhere else.....",BOvb-65sJMfmIb_oFxjPsA,0,0,3,AJj9_fv2LjipGOuglEiJOg

Entertainment: 4 stars - When we were there, a group who played Celtic music, but also took requests and were funny and laid back were playing. Enjoyed them very much. 

Food: 4 stars - We went with the Restaurant Week prixe fixe meal. Our starters were a mixed green salad with a fabulous dressing and drunken onion rings which were delicious, not greasy, and were accompanied by a delicious mustard based dipping sauce. For the main course, we had the fish and chips and Irish bangers. The bangers with cabbage over mashed potatoes were not only thoroughly Irish (or at least British), but were also very tasty and fit solidly in the category of comfort food. The fish and chips were horribly plated (fries on top of the fish in a cone shaped vertical stand which forced you to dig through the fries to get the to the fish and resulted in the fish getting a bit too much steam/moisture), but the batter did not feel greasy, the tarter sauce had great flavors, and the half lemon wrapped in a sort of fine cheesecloth to avoid seeds and pulp popping into your food was a nice touch. For dessert, we both had the butter and caramel bread pudding and it was 5 stars - all the way. Absolutely buttery, melty, semi-sweet heaven on a plate with excellent presentation. 

Service: 4 stars - Our waitress was attentive and my glass never got empty. She could have been a bit more friendly, but still, she did a great job.

So glad we came here! The live band was playing drunken irish songs. When we walked by the band to go to the our table, every band member looked at us, gave us a smile. We totally felt welcomed. Pretty awesome. Every couple of songs or so, a girl would come up at the stage and perform an irish dance. 
Want to drink, meet and just with a chill and very friendly crowd? Come to this pub. 
If you want to eat without band music, they do have patio seating that gives you a view of the strip. This is where we sat for dinner. We were able to chat without having to yell at each other, and at the same time, enjoyed watching people walk by.
Good selection of food, drinks, and of course, whiskey!! I do like my whiskeys so that is all I ordered for drinks. Salmon, especially the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are to die for!! We ordered them the first night we got there, and let me tell you, I was craaaaaving them the whole time we were in vegas! Matter of fact, I am still craving them. Definitely going back to this bar. Definitely going to order the mac/cheese and mashed potato and try their other dishes. This bar is located at NY NY hotel. I definitely recommed you check out this place if you're staying at this hotel. 
The service was ok. A little slow but there were only two servers that night (around 9pm). Our server was very nice though and very apologetic. As busy as they were, she was still calm and did keep coming back to us to ask of we were ok. So service was ok, but I still give this a 5 star. My overall experience was great!

Hubby & I took a friend who was in town for a late lunch before the WWE fight at T-Mobile Arena. Why it's a 5 Star...?
Food: Burger, Salmon Salad, Chopped Salad were really delicious. My hubby's a burger connoisseur & he swears it's top 5 he's had. The salmon, was cooked perfectly medium. It's been a while that I ordered a medium temp salmon & it came out just right. You would expect that in 5 star restaurants. The cheese in the salad, was a perfect addition. Our friend thought the Chopped salad was delicious too. The complimentary raisin bread, quite yummy.
Ambiance: great rendition of an Irish pub. Looks like they had a large selection of beer, although we weren't drinking. Upstairs seating & outside available. Nice atmosphere music. 
Service: she was good! Very attentive & fast service.

The steak was good... Not great, but good... It had a bit more gristle than I was expecting, but that happens sometimes with the particular cut I chose. It was tougher though than it should have been...

The Mac and cheese was great, rich, creamy and steaming hot! The colcannon mashed potatoes however were not the greatest... and none to hot and unfortunately the waiter was gone long enough that it wasn't worth waiting to get it changed out for new stuff.... You know when mashed potatoes sit to long on a line and they get that over starched hardness... Think that, but cold, with mixed in cold uncooked cabbage and ham.  

The rest of the meal went rather well... The atmosphere was a bit darker than I would have cared for.. In fact it was hard to see the stairs... I can deal with darkness in a restaurant at the table... But the stairs, is usually a good place to keep things rather well lit. 

MyVegas we behind on the viva launch and had only one POS terminal setup... As such my first receipt did not have a Viva code, I talked to the waiter about the program and he gladly reprinted my receipt on a terminal with the viva integration...

It's ok to eat, but it was kind of like eating a sheet of something brittle between the fish meat and the batter.  Another piece was soggy and when picking it up the skin just tore away chunks of fish fell off.

We were all disappointed in the fish and chips.  If they tasted better, they would have been a great deal, three large pieces of fish for about $16 bucks.

The hostess showed us to the table and said if we wanted to eat outside instead of inside we could choose a table. When we went outside we were ambushed by three waiters who were very pissed that we took it upon ourselves to change tables. Another waiter came up and thankfully diffused the situation. I wish he would have been our waiter as it was apparently it was our waiter's first day. He forgot to put our appetizer orders in and we ended up getting our entrees after 45 minutes. The food was lackluster. I've had better Shepherd's Pie at The Cheesecake Factory. 
Our waiter tried to make it up to us by saying dessert would be complimentary since he messed up with the appetizers. Well, he redeemed himself we all thought. We each were going to order a dessert since we each ordered an appetizer. When he came back to take our order he THEN clarified that ONE dessert would be comp'd. We only ended up ordering two to share between the four of us. When he brought the desserts out he explained that he still felt badly about the appetizer debacle and was going to comp both desserts. Well fine then. Whatever. He tried. 
Our dinner was over just after 6:00pm and we did not have a car and our hotel was at the other end of the strip. We hurried back to our hotel to change and then hurried (practically ran) back to NY NY to see the Cirque show. Somewhere in MGM the pads of my feet gave out and turned into two HUGE blisters. I was miserable the remainder of the weekend. (They still hurt mind you.) 
The next day I checked my bank account and realized I was charged twice. I called and spoke with the manager/chef who was SO nice and friendly. It was straightened out very quickly however I was out $120 while it was pending in my account the entire weekend.

The food is very good. All of the entrees were perfectly prepared. Even though the meat cuts were not of the same caliber of some local steak houses, I think they were actually better prepared than many others. The sides are simple and true to tradition. Buttered peas (peas with butter), creamed corn (corn with cream, simple and not overdone), the mashed potatoes were smooth with shallots and garlic mixed in. The quality seems consistent across the menu. 

My only complaints are that the music is too loud for conversation (most people seemed happy though) and the wait staff were more South American than Irish (though friendly and attentive).

The Chicken Pot Pie arrived in it's own little pot with the large pastry hanging over the edges. There were tender cubes of chicken, potatoes, carrots, and onions in a delicate, creamy sauce. It could have used a little salt. The Fish & Chips were very hearty large pieces of cod that was delicate to the fork yet held on to the crispy batter. The tartar sauce was unique in that it didn't resemble the Midwest white tartar sauce with bits of relish. This was a more creamy tartar sauce that was yellow in color, with a hint of lemon. Even though the fish was cooked perfectly, there was no seasoning and not even bathing it in tartar sauce could bring it to life.

Lots of great draughts from the British Isle on tap.  For the majority of the night, we went with those and Harper, Guinness, and Bodington was the ones we went for.  It was a bit odd since the beers were served in plastic cups.  Price was a little over $8 per beer.  Not that cheapest, but meh... Vegas.

They even have a table that has the tap right at your table!  Didn't get to try it since this group occupied it the whole time.

The live band was actually pretty good!  They even had a girl doing the Irish tap dancing.  That's something we don't see everyday so that was pretty cool.  It seems like there were plenty of European transplants that night since many of them knew the songs.

We tried one of the sampler plates, which was delicious but was disappointingly served to us in a plastic take-out container with no plates and limited silverware.

First of all, there are a ton of different bars in Vegas, as well as a myriad of nightlife experiences to be had, but there is nothing quite like ""Ninefine,"" as my girls and I like to call it.

The bar itself gets full pretty fast, so show up early (think 8pm).  Also, there is a thing called the ""tap table"" that can be reserved for up to a few hours.  Ours was equipped with Harp and Guiness, but wasn't exactly ready for pouring when we arrived at 8pm for our reservation.  After a quick fix, and a replaced keg, we were ready to rock and roll.  To start off we had a shot of Jameson, with a pickle back (or side shot).  This is a MUST to try.  The pickle juice is cold, yummy, and takes away the bite of the the Scotch whiskey.  After a shot and a beer, we settled in to order food.  Shepherd's pie?  OF COURSE!  There is also a chicken pot pie that almost looks like it deserves to be in an art museum, rather than eaten.  All the food fare at Ninefine is delish!  I don't recommend the sausage appetizers, or the fried pickles, simply because they seem to have a chef who is tempura crazy and all that grease does not go well with heavy drinking.

Finally, there is the entertainment.  The traditional Irish band, and dancers are spot on for this spot!  You will be lifting pints, most likely, with other Irishmen who deem this venue worthy of home and often frequent it on their trips to Vegas.  Why?  I'm not sure...I certainly don't plan on finding a Tejano bar in Dublin when I visit.  The nine fine Irishmen can be found high above the bar, and the ambiance certainly feels Irish and authentic.  This, again, is a definite must when you plan your next Sin City excursion!

TIP:  Ninefine is located in New York, New York and is easily accessible from south strip - or a short cab ride from mid strip.",v8CZsPV5MYcuuhZZRjyeuQ,0,1,4,p14ETfy6IJCuDExfNnIbCA

Our first trip was phenomenal: We sat in a secluded section of the restaurant that houses a couple booths and were lucky to have the area to ourselves for most of our meal.

In fact, we always have dip left over, never enough bread to finish it. 

I've stuck with the salmon (topped with smoked salmon) entree every time. I love it THAT much! Much of the food is pretty heavy, but the salmon is yummy and never fails to satisfy. My husband and friends have sampled various menu items and we've never been disappointed with a meal.

I love good bread pudding and can't stand bad bread pudding.  If you like bread pudding or have never tried bread pudding YOU MUST GET THE BREAD PUDDING.  It is the best bread pudding I ever ate and is the best dessert I've ever had.  Days later on our departure day we stopped to get one to eat and one to go.  We asked the hostess if the bread pudding would last with a 4 hour car trip.  She checked with the chef.  Executive Chef David Suppe came out to talk to us.  He said it would last if kept in a cooler with ice which we had.  When we were almost finished eating our bread pudding David brought us one ready for the trip in a plastic container with instructions on how to prepare it when we got home.  He also gave us the reciepe on how to make it.  When we got home we prepared it and it was delicious.  I don't know how you can top that service.

We live about 1/2 mile from this pub in the New York New York in Las Vegas.

Our meals there have been OK, but not anything special.  On our last visit, on 28 February 2017, we experienced a bill shock at the end of the meal.

We normally sit at the bar, but they had no seats this time, so we had a table.  We ordered two Bushmills on the rocks - as usual.  We have done this every time we have visited Nine Fine Irishmen.

So it looks like sitting at the bar is a better idea.

First, we were given rather meager pours.  Perhaps they were strict 45 ml pours.  So we ordered a total of 2 rounds, for 4 drinks in total.

When we received the check, there was a bill for 4 drinks at $14 each = $56 - the drinks were listed as ""Bushmills 10"" - I assume this is the Bushmills 10 year old that sells for $45 at BevMo.

As a result, what we were expecting to be well under $100 for a modest meal, came to $124 total.  This would never have happened had we sat at the bar.

A 750 ml bottle of Bushmills 10 year old is $45.  That holds 15 45 ml drinks.  First, they brought me the wrong drink.  We did not order Bushmills 10, we ordered Bushmills.  Second, they are charging a 4.67 times markup for a drink.  

It is very unlikely we will be back.  It is even more unlikely that we will recommend to anyone.  BTW, since we live here, everyone asks us for recommendations.",zsW18y02lzJeaJ3aU2orjA,3,0,1,C5DpoBSI7kVHAyYwqeTcfg

I went here with my BF because we both love Irish bars, and we happened to have the BEST time ever at this particular watering hole. There were 3 Irishmen at the bar from Canada, and an Irishman from New York city with his Jersey girlfriend -- our whole time there was a combination of dancing, singing Irish songs (dirty old townnnnn....), laughing, biting (the good kind, but even the bad kind is the good kind), singing pop songs (loudly), and of course, lots of Irish whiskey (Jameson) and beer (Smithwicks - for you beer dunces out there, the ""w"" is silent). It's the most drunk I've ever gotten without throwing up. That's a personal record I would write in my diary if I had one. I'd probably even stick a Hello Kitty twin star sticker next it and everything.

The bartender was heavy handed and fun and I think he even shaved that day. He even resembled Colin Farrel a bit; but maybe that's just because I was watching Colin's porn clip on the web just an hour earlier (5 stars for his performance, FYI). The crowd was definitely lively; how much of that was attributed to the fact that you're on vacation and you're supposed to be lively on vacation, I'm not sure. A guitarist took the stage and sang a variety of songs, which of course, we all slaughtered along to ourselves. He totally humored us and was a champ about all our heckling. I'm sure he talked shit about us after his shift, but he sure acted like he wasn't going to.  It truly was one of the funnest times I've ever had at a bar. We didn't try the food, so I can't vouch for that, but the crowd and the staff -- five stars all the way.

Feel free to walk up to other patrons and say ""kiss me I'm Irish!""... if they politely decline move on to the next table or if they stare at you confused just say ""hug me I'm Irish?""... it's okay because you're in an Irish pub in Vegas. Right?

Nine Fine Irishmen is located inside the New York, New York casino.  It's more than just an Irish pub.  The ornate décor and split level venue make it seem a little more classy than a hole in the wall.  But I have serious gripes with this place.

The crowd: You are guaranteed to come across packs of oblivious tourists.  It starts as you wait to get in and only gets worse the deeper you get inside.  These are the folks who just stand in the middle of the room staring at the wall while you try to weave your way through.  They're inescapable.

The booze:  8 bucks for a Guinness and $7.50 for a Newcastle is about as expensive as it gets on the strip.  And when it's served in a clear college style plastic cup half the time, good luck expecting any kind of tip from me.

There are a few bright spots.  The venue itself seems very authentic.  And on many nights you'll have live Irish music which is certainly better than another dj playing Boom Boom Pow every 20 minutes.  But hey if that's your cup of the just go out to the patio seating and you'll hear the music bleeding over from Rok next door.

First off, we use the game MyVegas to earn loyalty points that translate to free stuff in Vegas.  You can get it through Facebook.  We got a voucher for $25 to use at NFI.  We told the server beforehand and she was nonchalant about it.  
We ordered a beer and a hard cider and some appetizers.  We got the cheese dip and hot wings.  The hot wings were hot wings - perfect size, just the right amount of hot.  if you want traditional hot wings, you can get them here.
The cheese dip was the stuff of dreams.  It wasn't complicated, melted cheese with various types of bread.  I love bread and I love cheese.  I love various types of bread and I love melty cheese.  I was angry Yes ANGRY, that I had to share with my husband and you could tell he felt the same way, we were feverishly trying to beat each other out to get more of the cheese dip.  Next time, I will just order my own.  I should have that night, I have no idea why I didn't.
There was a live band and we were sat around the corner, in view of the dancing platform at a table that had a loveseat on one side.  It was an intimate little corner away from the drunken masses.  The music was good. There was a dancer who came out here and there to do some Irish dancing on the platform.  She was good too.  Definitely a cool place to have a couple of drinks and a boatload of cheese.
We ended up ordering a couple more drinks and the whole bill was the $25 voucher plus maybe $15 more.  Awesome value.

4.5 stars really, because I found the food way too expensive for what it was. $91 for two people, even for Vegas, was much.

Shortly after that we realized how the place was full of old men in their 60's or later. Keeping in mind that a lot of places don't serve Car Bombs, we held our breath and fought toward the bar.

We were greeted quickly when we arrived and were seated at a nice table at the top of the stairs.  The waitress was friendly and brought our drinks with a short wait.  We ordered the fixed holiday menu but asked to start with an appetizer.  After a fairly long wait our salad and soup arrived .....before the appetizer.  When I pointed out to the server that we had not gotten our appetizer he checked his tray and said oh...here it is too. He was indifferent bordering on rude.   So, our casual dinner now has the appetizer and soup/salad on the table.  We started eating and after about five minutes the server shows up again....with our entrees.  His comment - so were am I supposed to put this.  My first thought is to send it back because we just got two other courses but based on his surly attitude (....I can only imagine what treatment that food would be given in the kitchen,,,,,) I told him to put it on the corner of the table.

The waitress came by and I told her I felt rushed and could not understand why the courses were coming out all togther.  She was polite and apologized.  We finished the dishes and  the waitress returned to get our choices for dessert - which was included in the holiday menu.  They were out of one of the two selections and they let me substitute a regular menu item because I AM NOT a fan of pumpkin pie.

I was happy with my chocolate cake choice because the pumpkin pie looked dry and .....old.... when they brought my husband's dessert.

We ate so quickly I barely finished my one glass of hard cider.  

Not sure if they were just trying to hurry up diners and turn over more tables or there was miscommunication in the kitchen - but this was a less than pleasant visit.  I guess I got coal in my Christmas stocking from the Nine Fine Irishmen.",W7jFzFFxAj2SzpicETgXfQ,1,0,2,Z9MrHqJVgaX2vmtZbhi3Wg

We were a little early for the live entertainment, but we still enjoyed the ambiance of the Irish style pub. They were playing the soccer game which was a huge plus! Our server wasn't in a big hurry, but we weren't either, and she was extremely friendly. It was a tough choice between the shepherds pie and the braised ribs. I ordered the Guinness braised ribs, and my friend ordered the corned beef and cabbage. The ribs were flavorful and very tender, and one of the best things I ate during my stay in Vegas.

It's quaint and little rabbit warren rooms which is fun.  Very small menu which includes a bit of everything.  Since we were in an Irish pub we opted to try that type of food.  I had Irish Stew and hubby had bangers and mash.  He said it was  good but a little bland.  I felt the same way about my dish.   The lamb was very unevenly cooked, some tough and some not as bad.  Not many carrots or potatoes and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I'm sure the Irish don't eat like that.  We didn't do dessert, nothing tempted.

Our server Timothy was very nice and brought my friend a bread pudding cake for her birthday. It was so nice of Timothy to give her the cake since the hostess informed me that they were under new management and only shots are offered.

They weren't busy probably because it was only 11am - we got seated upstairs right by the second bar - when looking down there was another bar downstairs. 

As we were looking through the menu, our cheery and sweet waitress came by asking what we would like to drink - usually my mom likes orange juice but she wanted to try something new so I asked her to whip up some kind of fruit punch for us....whatever she mixed up was pretty good.

The service was friendly and great but the food was equally as good. We ordered: the Beer Battered Onion Rings with spicy mustard to share - I usually don't like onion rings but ordered it cause my mom does - but I actually really liked these onion rings  - they were crispy and I didn't even need to dip into the spicy mustard - for the batter already had a good taste.

I really like corn beef so I got the Corn Beef Sandwich on Marbled Rye with Cole Slaw as the side. The sandwich was tasty unfortunately the Cole Slaw lacked dressing. Maybe get it with the fries or potatoes would be better.

My mom had the Irish Breakfast which came with Corn Beef Hash, Banger, Two Eggs, Potatoes and Toast. I actually had some and the corn beef hash was good and also really liked how they made the scrambled eggs. 

The portions were pretty big and we didn't finish any of the food and ended up taking it back home....and even after a 4 hour and half car ride my sandwich was still pretty good.

Overall good service, good food - the only slight complaint was the price - for the two of us the bill out to be around $50ish and plus tip it was almost 60...that's pretty pricey for lunch in my opinion and we didn't even have beer or any alcohol.",nZpSxSHct3faGgonk0nmdw,1,0,4,W8xO7qwHPbpXOIRRS2OmZg

- We were told we'd have a 15-20 minute wait, which was fine... until half an hour went by and we went from buzzed, happy-but-hungry to straight up sober and hangry. When finally seated, we were brought to a very private table at the top of the stairs near the back which we initially thought was awesome, except we later suspected they put us there just to forget about us.

- After receiving our waters, my husband and I added Mio flavoring to ours. Our waitress passed by and immediately got snotty with us and demanded to know who had gotten us a drink so that she could add it to our tab. Wtf.

- Only ONE page for the entire dinner menu, including salads and appetizers? Pathetic.

- My husband ordered the lamb stew, and for nearly $20, boy was it lackluster. Considering how mediocre and mushy it was, they could at least have served him more than one ladle-full.

- While at dinner for over an hour, our waters were NEVER refilled. Not even once.

- Between the six of us multiple salads, stew, fried sausages, and onion rings were ordered. The ONLY things worth ordering were the appetizers (which were delicious). No joke. No one even finished their boring, overpriced salads.

- A bus boy brought us a basket of starter bread when we were almost done with our meal. Thanks, I guess.

Needless to say, we were especially miffed that we were forced to tip a rude waitress who basically showed up to our table only to take our orders and then give us our bill. (Please keep in mind that we received this awful service on a weekday evening in the slow month of February.)

2121361,2012-08-11,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"The ""New York, New York"" hotel and casino in Vegas is very much a microcosm of Las Vegas itself.  You can find all kinds of examples of humanity within.  Bros, bro hoes, preppy types, hipsters, wanna be's, classy people...you name it - you can find it there.  Its a smaller version of the ""barely organized chaos"" that exists outside on Vegas' strip.  Because of the way its laid out with the casinos, the shops, all the eateries and that various ""neighborhoods"", Ny Ny can best be described as cacophonous.

But nestled within this little den of chaos is a relative haven of tranquility and mellowness known as Nine Fine Irishmen.  For those of you who don't know (and really... what are there.. like 4 of you out there still left?), it models itself as an Irish Pub right out of Dublin.  The wife and I have been here twice in our wanderings; most recently for lunch and a pint of ale.  

Without a doubt, this is a great place to rest, relax and recharge yourself with a pint of ale or perhaps a shot of whiskey and grab a bite to eat.  My fave drink here is a ""Black Velvet"", a lovely concoction of Stout and Cider that is the perfect parity tween sweet and strong.

The food is excellent too.  Highly recommended is the Fish n Chips.  The fish, never frozen, is delicious and served traditionally in a paper ""funnel"" along with the thick chips.  Also of note is their corn beef sandwich - which included generous portions of meat.  They also have traditional Anglo fare, like Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash.

One of the nicest things about this place is when you walk in - all the sounds and chaos of the casino and goings on outside become dull and muted causing your cares to drift away.  Of course, having a pint or two doesn't hurt either!.  Its a very relaxing, mellow atmosphere.  Except after 10pm, that is.  Then it becomes a raucous and happening nightclub.

The place is a *tad* pricey - but only just a tad.  There are far more expensive places to eat and drink - but really, the quality of everything is worth it!

The employees..bartenders...waitresses...everyone, are very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress, Tracy I think her name was, even knew what a ""Snug"" was in regards to pubs - and pointed out that they had three of them!  Woot!

Simply put, Nine Fine Irishmen is the perfect spot at the perfect place in Vegas.  An oasis of solemnity in the middle of a vast ocean of glorious chaos.  A must-visit kind of place when you want to settle down with a drink and recharge your inner-battery after strolling up and down the strip.",zWLhTbc_Q0R2800Q5EPSKw,4,2,5,E6o0IWd9WHKUDLzJ0tpcmw

The band was alright. We came to eat the food so was disappointed to pay the cover charge (violinist and tap dancer was pretty cool). We werent that hungry so we ordered the shepherd's pie and drunken onion rings. 5 starts for the food. It was tasty. The onion rings were crispy and gave a decent portion.  Didnt like the sauce much...was too spicy for me. The shepherd's pie was really good...first time trying anything like that so can't compare it to anything.

One star for the service. 

After getting in, we weren't acknowledged and just found a seat. We tried to flag down the waitress but she ignored us or didn't see us. When she returned 5 minutes later we asked for the menu. We flagged her to order. We wanted to order a drink and tried to get her attention and she walked past us again. Granted, it was busy. But she wad the ONLY server in the entire place on a Saturday night.  Come ON. When she passed again I shouted ""EXCUSE ME!"" because she obviously wasnt checking her surroundings to see if the customers needed something even when I was looking at her and flailing my arms. She seemed stunned and shocked that I shouted. But the music was loud and she was not checking up on us. We asked for a drink menu and she gave us one.

Finally, she came and took our order without us trying to call her again. The food came out and it was good. I tried to get her attention for one last time and asked her for a box, refill of waters, and the check all at once so I dont have to keep trying to get her attention. She refilled the water.  I had to get the busboy to get me a box. Then after maybe TWENTY minutes she brings the check after saying ""I see you got the box!"" She swipes the card and and we finally leave. 

Ruined the experience. We were waiting so much. They need to get more wait staff especially on a Saturday night. She was so busy and she can't keep up with everything she needed to do. There were even people who had gotten up to pay because she was so inattentive.

We found this place while looking for Shake Shack nearby, so we decided to stop by for some drinks.

It was kind of quiet during the time we went, but the bartender let us know that it gets fun at night time.

We had a few drinks, most of which had Jameson of course. The drinks were strong, bartenders were chill, and the crowd was cool as well. We didn't stay long, but we had a good start here for our drinking afternoon, haha.",hYWwocw-J4KdyGLrUlOYXA,3,0,4,IuIAHyeeohoDBJxKxlYBHg

2275020,2012-02-19,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"We were here just a few days ago celebrating our oldest daughter's 21st birthday.  It was our second visit and we had an even better time than visit #1.  Here's why:

1) On entering the manager greeted us, asked if our daughter was 21 and when she showed her id the manager gave her a hearty Happy Birthday and bought her first drink.  Awesome!

2) The layout - we scored sweet seats at the bar.  This section of seating had a floor-to-ceiling panel that separated us from the rest of the bar and gave us almost instant access to the very attentive bartender and kept us somewhat insulated from the next seat over group of ridiculous 20-something guys drinking Coronas.  Seriously??? All of the seating here is set up to provide a cozy, insulated table that seems to encourage settling in and staying for the evening.  

3) The drinks - my husband is a beer fan (shocking, I know) and I'm neutral but I love an occasional Harp and can't usually find it on tap at home.  The 21yo started with her on-the-manager shandy and followed up with an ice cold hard cider.  Hubs had black and tans all night.  

4) The food - just before the kitchen closed we ordered shepard's pies.  Served in a cast metal bucket these we the largest shepard's pies I've ever seen!  Two were more than enough for our whole party.  The flavor and texture were excellent!  I want one now, in fact.  No noticeable veggies in there but that might have been the low lighting and the beer, not the pies themselves.  :)

5) The band - Sin É Rí-Ra is apparently the house band and they were fantastic!  I'm not a huge fan of Irish music but everything they played was awesome and I've still got one of the songs (Whiskey in the Jar) stuck in my head three days later.  I'm contemplating tracking down one of their CDs.  

6) The little old lady with the cane - I'm pretty sure she was there last time, too.  I don't know who this woman is but she had a following of her own and was getting right down with the music all night.  Adorbs.

Unlike some of the other reviewers here we ARE fans of the pub aesthetic.  At it's most authentic it is a gathering place for the neighborhood, men, women, families and friends.  It is a place where you spend hours just hanging out, drinking, talking and listening to music, with people whose company you enjoy.  It's simple, homey and comfortable.  If that's not what you're looking for, don't bother.  If it is, Nine Fine Irishmen nails the experience flawlessly.

8 girls and I went for dinner and had a cute waiter (wish I could remember his name now) who was super attentive and helpful. We ate, drank, chatted, drank, ate, drank, etc... They had cider and guiness straight from Ireland and it was perfect. 

We then found out they were having a live band - a live IRISH band. So, we nixed our previous plans, did a quick wardrobe change and headed back to the NFI for the music. The first 1/2 of the set was full of upbeat irish classics. The second 1/2  - good old American favorites (think Bon Jovi, Journey, CCR, etc).  They even had an Irish dancer.

First one- there is a cover charge which is odd for a bar. I understand that there is a live band playing... but still. It's not a night club. Although, a little tip for the military- show your ID and you get in for free. Even dependents!

Second one- the drinks are ridiculously expensive! Ok, I know it's a bar in Vegas, so it is to be expected to a certain extent, but $11 beers?? And I'm not talking Guiness, I'm talking Coors! Yikes!

Third one- lack of seating. The layout of this place is really awkward and hard to navigate. It is fairly narrow and situated so that most seats can get at least a small view of the band playing on stage.

Although I don't much care for the NYNY hotel in which it is located, I highly recommend starting your evening of debauchery w/ NFI. They always have a band playing Irish tunes, and a crazy Asian woman ( nightly regular) dancing a jig. Not sure what her story is, but she isn't even the wackiest ""thing"" you will run into here. On this particular visit, an older gentleman in his 60's came into the bar with an unusual date...... A six foot tall Marilyn Monroe impersonator, with a prominent Adam's Apple. Good Times. I sent him over a shot believing he needed it more than me. Makes for good entertainment, even if their alcohol prices are on the high side (even by Strip standards).

Only disappointment was a VERY small bacon wrapped meatloaf (about the size of a childs fist).
Starters: baked brie, loved it, the crabcake we thought a bit expensive/small for one crab cake.  The beer selection appears spectacular (I dont drink, but the wife likes it!)

2467112,2017-03-27,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I was on a visit to Las Vegas during the St. Paddy's week in 2017. So checking out the Irish Pubs was a natural. 

I might mention that the primary purpose of my trip was a campus visit to start a PhD at UNLV in fall. But, checking out where most of my extracurricular hanging out is gonna be was also imperative. My first PhD in music is from UT, and Fado and Baker Street were two pubs where a lot of my time was spent. My U2 tribute band (Mysterious Ways) played at the former and my classic rock band (American Thighs) at the latter. Needless to say, We have fond memories of each, and of the damsels ""who helped us through the night"" (to quote Gordon Lightfoot).

As the quintessential outsider, an expansive cosmopolite, what I seek in a bar is a place that makes insiders of outsiders. Some Irish pubs can do that, and of the three I visited in Vegas, this one gets my vote.

I was drawn in around 1:30 AM by the sounds of a U2 cover, and JR at the door waived the cover for me, as the band only plays until 2:30. It's the same band, six night a week, but they are very good. Three members sing, and the harmonies are precise. A lead fiddler adds the Irish garnish, even to classic rock covers. It's a mix of Irish and British numbers, from traditional to contemporary, and they take requests. They also have an Irish step dancer who hops onto a dedicated table for some of the tunes.

As there's hardly any worthwhile socializing to be had on the strip other than with the hustlers, I came back on the following night, a Thursday. As I stood at the bar, I was approached by a sweet woman (something that never happens in the boondocks where I currently live), whom I immediately recognized as the fiddler/singer with the band. She said I was a ""lovely man"" and offered me her CD and business card. Well, on next couple of days, my best friend was in town, and both of us were let in without a cover. The guys at the door also work in the Irish spirit, very welcome in the American $$$ zombie dream of the strip. (Hey, Maire, the fiddler, also does a great version of ""Zombie"" with the apposite dance moves. It's a hit, every night!)

Overall, on the Strip this was the only place I saw ""regulars."" I guess locals do hang out on the Strip.

Drinks: I tried a Guinness one night ($12, including tip) and Long Island ($14, including tip). A shade less expensive than other places on the Strip, I understand, but definitely not Austin prices. 

Overall, currently this is the only bar that makes me look forward to going toward the Strip when I move to Vegas in August. But I hope to find others.

First of all, the atmosphere is great! It has two floors, and also offers and outdoor seating patio right on the strip, where you can people watch, too. Pretty much whatever atmosphere you're looking for, this place has! The entire place is designed and appointed to look like an authentic Irish pub, and there's a great place in the back for the band or whoever is performing to get on stage. It can get very busy and boisterous on the weekend evenings, but hey...you're in Vegas, and it's a fun spot!

There are two bars here, one on each floor, which is very handy if you're moving around. You don't have to walk a whole flight just to get a drink! They have a great selection on tap, and the bartenders are on point and professional. 

The menu/food here is probably not the best you'll have in this city...probably not by a long shot. I personally wouldn't choose this place to eat, though. It's more about the atmosphere, and a place you stop with friends to grab drinks, talk, and enjoy the entertainment and people watching. If you come just for the meal, you'll probably leave less than satisfied.

Overall, a nice little Irish pub on this end of the strip. It's conveniently located in the NY-NY hotel, and it's right on the strip, so it's fairly easy to get to. This place is worth a stop if you're in this area.",WHXBLnA7LE1ap2_KPoQKtQ,1,1,4,F2mpFGU9uwN2QLPVz-LA1A

Had a great late night dinner here.  It was LOUD.  I guess I had enough to drink prior that the noise and location of our tiny table right by the stage wasn't a problem.

Tuesday night and the place was packed.

Hubby had the blue cheese encrusted steak.  He didn't think it was as good as the steak he had earlier in the day at Fleur but he liked it none the less.

As a vegetarian I just at my husbands side dish- Mac & cheese for $6!!!  It was amazingly delicious!  I couldn't even finish the entire serving.  Would eat it every single day... way way way better than the Mac & Cheese from Mon Ami Gabi.

Thanks Nine Fine Irishmen!

Every time I go to Vegas, this is always on the list of places to go.

First off, the atmosphere is awesome. If you want a good pub-feel in your dining or drinking experience, this is the place.

Secondly, the music is always great! I haven't been in here once where the music didn't tap my shoe. I suggest going on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night when they have live music - it resonates through the entire building and provides a good ambiance to the evening.",prYnDGdETPFHyFIqThzdpA,0,0,4,6wzgqT-BuAPVi--8O0qYxw

2616675,2014-02-15,6,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I would love to review this place's food, but the hostess was so unbelievably RUDE that I immediately left with a group of co-workers after a 10 hour day at CES. That's how bad it was.

The hostess's name badge said ""Martiza from El Salvador"". I could care less where she's from, but hopefully someone from Nine Fine Irishmen will read this, be able to identify her, and at bare minimum send her back to customer service training.

We were running about 15 minutes late for our 7:30PM reservation. (HELLO, it's trade show season in Vegas -- it happens.) So, I called into Nine Fine Irishmen, and let them know. I was told on the phone, ""No problem, we'll push the reservation back to 7:45PM.""

We arrived at 7:45PM on the dot. The hostess, Martiza, looked at our names and said, ""You're late, so you'll have to wait."" I informed her that I had the reservation pushed back. Her boss came over and said, ""It's OK, I've got them."" She was clearly irked, and started yelling as we walked away with him.

After he took us upstairs, he said to please enjoy ourselves while we were seated. But, we couldn't find a seat, and no one came to seat us. I went back town to Maritza to say, ""Where was your boss going to seat us?""

Instead of telling us, she snottily yelled, ""I TOLD YOU there's no seating.""

""Well, MARITZA, your boss said there was, and was trying to seat us,"" I reminded her, my patience running out.

""He doesn't do the seating charts, so he doesn't know. You're late, so we gave your table away. They're almost done, they're just finishing their drinks, so you'll be seated after they're done."" 

So, let me get this straight. In the fifteen minutes we were ""late"" (which is almost always a window that a restaurant gives you anyway, not to mention I had changed the reservation), you managed to seat ANOTHER party of four, get them through drinks, dinner, dessert, and a final round of drinks.

I don't think so. Martiza screwed up the seating chart, and then had the nerve to, instead of act like a classy, well-trained hostess, go on a pissy-pants party.

Any REAL hostess with real training (particularly in a foodie town like Vegas) would have said something  ""I'm so sorry, there is a little wait due to the rush with the trade show. Why don't you have a seat at the bar with a glass of wine or a beer on us, and we should be able to seat you in just a few minutes."" 

If she had done that, we would have stayed, and gladly spent our company's food and drink allowance there.

Instead, Maritza's horrible, entitled, condescending, and insulting tone and manner led all of us to decide to eat elsewhere. I said, ""We've decided we don't want to eat here,"" and handed her back the reservations. A huffy ""FINE,"" a slam of our menus down on her podium of stank attitude, and turning to gossip with another hostess (almost certainly about us) was her reply. 

We went to Il Fornaio (also in New York New York), were seated within 10 minutes without a reservation, and had a great meal with lovely and attentive staff. Kudos to them!

I wouldn't step foot back in Nine Fine Irishmen as long as Martiza is a hostess. I hope that Nine Fine Irishmen takes a better look at their hosting and wait staff. There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas, and plenty other of wonderful Irish pubs (Ri Ra in Mandalay Bay, for one).

2629500,2012-03-14,2,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"The Wife has been talking about going to see some fine Irish men for years. Although i have always been a little concerned about this, i decided that this year i would finally let her. So I grabbed her Lucky Charms and off to New York New York Hotel and Casino we went .  The Nine Fine Irishmen Pub is always busy and the evening that we went was no exception. We did not have to wait for a table, however , when we got seated in the dimly lit dining room, we were greeted with a view of the restroom. This was not ideal, but at least with a complete 360 turn around of our necks we could see the stage where a great Irish folk band was rockin the Riverdance, and a sixty something year old midget in her leprechaun costume ( I'm not kidding) was burning up the dance floor.I was looking forward to seeing a sexy Irish waitress straight from the country side come over to take our order, and i did not have to wait long. Although she probably had some country in her, the sexy and the Irish part seemed to be missing. So with a little disappointment in my voice I placed my order with Marlborough Lung Cancer Granny. I decided that after the leprechaun midget ,Irish folk band , restroom view seating and total lack of Irish tail that a strong drink was needed. I went with Gaelic Punch, it was loaded with a bunch of  Rum(s), and Midori and did the trick. Before long I was smiling like a kid that had just found a four leaf clover.  For the food, Simone and I started out with the Potato Basket. Although not the most adventurous of choices, you really can not go wrong with thick slices of deep fried potatoes. The potatoes were served with Red and Yellow curry sauces that were both very good. And the portion was large, consisting of at least a couple of good sized spuds.  For the entree Simone decided on The Herb Crusted Goat Cheese salad. Although (as discussed in previous blogs) salads are not an entree, I decided to keep my opinion to myself and let my wonderful wife enjoy her rabbit food. The salad consisted of Arugula with other mixed greens, oven dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, and a big heaping spoon full of goat cheese topped off with a Hazelnut Dressing.  Simone said it may have been the best salad EVER.  And she would know, she loves salad- as an ENTREE. For my tastes, I also found it to be very good and the goat cheese was excellent.
Next up was my choice, a real entree, the traditional Shepherds Pie. Now this was comfort food. No frills, just damn good and piping hot. Topped with a mashed potato crust it arrived in a mini cast iron pot and was filled with tender morsels of sirloin steak, not the ground up junk, but real chunks of good beef tips mixed with carrots, and onions in a thick and rich port wine gravy. The BEST EVER Shepherds Pie. No cream of corn, or any other gross stuff that mom used to put into it (sorry mom) .This was just a simple,  warm your insides on a snow filled night kinda meal. It was excellent.  So ended our visit to Ireland. Although it started off a little scary, it ended great.

2634352,2011-07-25,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I love Irish food and the Americanized versions of it. Just about everywhere I travel, if I see an Irish Pub, I try to stop in at least for one dish to see how they stack up. Nine Fine Irishmen did not disappoint. 

My wife and I went were before seeing Zumanity. It was in the same Casino so it worked out for us. We walked in with out a reservation. They seated us promptly on the second floor of the restaurant. The atmosphere was really nice. Not the best for Irish Pubs I've been in, but it did give you a nice laid back impression. It was busy enough to keep your attention, but not so busy as to distract you. 

I love Bangers and Mash, so that's what I ordered and I was not disappointed. Two thick Irish sausages over mustard mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy on top. DELICIOUS! These were some of the best ones I've ever had. Even upon returning home to my local pub, I had to break the news that the Bangers and Mash and Nine Fine Irishmen were better. Loved it!

My wife ordered the pan roasted red snapper with heirloom tomato and caper butter. She loves red snapper and she really liked it here. She let me try some and it was so flavorful. The fish and the sauce combined. She let me try some, but I'm not a big red snapper fan. I liked it, but I think my bangers and mash was much better. 

The service was okay. There were a couple of times our server seemed to disappear and we couldn't find her. She was also a little slow to bring the check at the end.  I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a bathroom in the restaurant. You had to leave and go back into the casino to find one. I asked if there was one closer and they told me no.

My BFF and I decided to take advantage of our luckiness and make it a night to remember, even though it was a Monday. That's how we do.

We have friends that RAVE about Nine Fine, but we both had never been there. I love NYNY and I had loved the Big Apple Bar, which is now being turned into a money cage. Boo. But we decided to venture into Nine Fine...and what fun it was!

We were hungry, but we arrived after the kitchen closed, so we decided to have a drink or two and then go find food. I really liked the atmosphere of the place. I'm quite familiar with pubs, especially as BFF's dad has worked for Guinness for 20+ years, and this place looks authentic! We went upstairs to the bar and were greeted immediately. The bartenders were pleasant, and while our first drinks were not strong, they were decent.  Then we moved on to apple martinis (I know, in an Irish pub, but whatever!). Soon they asked us to move downstairs, as they were closing the upstairs part. No prob.

Downstairs was a lively Irish band (I think they are called Ri-Ra or something like that). Although it was not packed, it was busy enough and soon people were dancing. It was really fun. BFF and I began drinking ""Drunken Peaches"" from the speciality cocktail menu. At $10, they were really strong, but sweet and delicious. We really liked taking our cocktails outside to the large patio. At 12am, on a Monday/Tuesday in February, the Strip was pretty much a ghost town. It was a cool experience.

2655783,2014-11-20,8,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"We were dishin' out dough at the tables inside of NY NY. A few hours in with the house consuming our money, it was agreed, consumption of food was absolutely necessary. ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 

The ambiance is 'pubbish' with stained wooden floors and walls, head stones, mirrors, marble pillars and dim chandeliers. Very subtle and nice. Being a quarter Irish, I'm always drawn to places like this. It gives me a false sense of feeling, that perhaps, this is what it might be like over yonder. 

We were sat in a neat little sofa style seat adjacent to the restrooms. I don't mind this.. In fact, it was quite the scene. The entry / exit door for waiters / waitresses / bussers and so on is conveniently  placed side by side with the restrooms. I couldn't count how many men and women walked into the kitchen dazed and confused. Even the restroom entrances themselves were a little confusing, with dudes going in the women's and women going into the men's restrooms. Good times.

I was about to order a chicken pot pie and my sister the Shepherd's pie when a waitress walked by with an individual chicken pot pie. These things are ginormous! They're served in a tin pale that's stuffed to the top! The proverbial 'muffin top' so to speak. We ordered the chicken pot pie to share, drunken onion rings and each had a cup of Colcannon soup. 

The appetizers were delightful. The drunken onions rings are marinated in a bloody Mary / beer batter mix, fried and served with spicy honey mustard. Scorching temperatures had us waiting on these bad boys, but I have to tell you, they were really good. I didn't catch the hints of bloody mary flavoring, however, the spicy mustard sauce made up for that. 

The Colcannon was what the doctor ordered. The weather during the day had been in the mid-70's and evening hours around the low 40's, so the soup compensated for the cool weather and warmed me up instantly. Did somebody say bacon!? Resting inside this creamy soup delight, Irish bacon is topped on pureed potatoes, cabbage and leeks. 

The chicken pot pie took the cake though. As mentioned the crust spews out of the top of the tin pale it's served in. Light, flaky and buttery.  The crust's solid defense was no match for my fork's offense.  The chicken was succulent, salty and tender. And wow.. The sauce / stock the vegetables are mixed in was probably one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Period. There was cheddar in this pie, which I've never had in a pot pie, and it (along with a few other ingredients) created an orange like cream that was too tasty! I was full, but kept eating.  Flavor in every bite and never EVER lacked it.

-- Oscar Wilde


To savor the true experience of the Emerald Isles, who would think the path would lead to Las Vegas? At the doorstep of the New York New York Hotel?

It's a rubbish thought of course. Yet, there was a certain whimsy in the double-faux authenticity of Nine Fine Irishmen. And, by the DIsneyland-like ersatz takes of Vegas, NFI is a winner.

Compelled by a tempting menu, and reasonable fix prix for Vegas' Restaurant Week, my buddies and I were seated by thick-brogue staff to our table. RIGHT in front of the stage. I said, ""do you think we want a quieter spot?"" ""No this is fine"" they said. My friends -- either geniuses or precognitive.

Right after ordering our drinks (whiskey for me -- not usually a fan but ""when in Dublin..."") and meals, the band proceeded. Loud, traditional Irish folk songs done in a contemporary slant. The crowd that gathered was alive and into them. It was kick-ass (literally kick-ass, as the occasional song brought a riverdancing maiden to a platform. Watch your dental work if you stray too close). Yes, so over the top Irish, missing only a pot of gold and leprechauns (well one glitter-faced older lady dressed like Queen Elizabeth, reputedly there every evening, seemed to be channeling a leprechaun in her gleeful dancing).

Lest we forget the food ...

The first course, Colcannon Soup -- hands-down the BEST thing I ate over my five days at Vegas. So wonderful and so simple -- a thick soup of potatoes, butter, leeks, cream, cabbage and a dollop of bacon pieces crowning the velvety richness. Cholesterol be damned, each spoonful was worthy of a love sonnet. My main course of Shepherd's Pie, with port wine-infused beef tips and cutely served in a mini-kettle, was generous and oh-so comforting. Dessert, the bread & butter pudding of baked brioche, with golden raisins, topped with whiskey cream and caramel sauces, was almost flan-like in texture and a knockout. And big. I couldn't eat more than half.

Dinner was a huge carb-load, which I usually refrain from -- it hit my system like a pint of whiskey (just ask the persons I tried to text post-dinner). Between the glorious food, ribald entertainment and carbs I was in a cloud of euphoria. So if you're in Vegas and want to have a glamour of your Irish heritage, put your hands and stomach (and ears) in the hands of these nine fine men.",hxl75_mb4CUxYUCm9CjLcw,2,3,5,65j_b_VsJgjS1A-9zyUG7w
2668691,2015-12-16,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I have visited this restaurant twice and I'm surprised to find that I did not review them the first time, which is unfortunate because the first visit was stellar.  That was about a year ago and the service was awesome, as was the food.  We fell in love with the beer cheese dip with different breads, including some phenomenal pretzel rolls and told everyone that they had to go to this place.  That's why I'm surprised I failed to actually write the review!

Unfortunately, this recent experience was really different.  My husband and I brought my parents here for dinner on Sunday night for fish and chips and OF COURSE we ordered the beer cheese dip.  Everything started out pleasant but when the beer cheese dip arrived it was lukewarm and all of the breads were kind of hard.  I'm not much of a complainer these days and my husband was sort of saying it wasn't hot when the server walked up.  Monica overheard and asked if there was something wrong.  He told her that it wasn't hot and she offered to bring another.  I said, it was fine because it was warm, just not hot and not to worry about it.  That was before I realized the bread was also not very fresh.  But, I'd made my bed.  We munched on the bread and were chatting and the football game that was on the big screen next to us ended, so my husband asked a server who was passing by if they could change it to the last few minutes of the Cowboy game, she was saying that they didn't have the football package when our main server, Monica came out and agreed that they don't have a Football package.  My husband said, ""it's on regular TV."" and Monica got an odd look on her face and said, ""Sir, I don't know why you're so upset.  I can look into it.""  We were all a little confused because my husband wasn't upset at all, but instead just stated a fact.  She said, ""we don't have that and I can't change it and walked off.""  It was one of the weirdest experiences with a server because everyone was happy and having a good time and he just made a request that you might make in any bar.   That sort of set the stage for the rest of the meal and while the fish and chips were good, after that the experience was awkward.  We probably would have just let it go, but then the manager stopped by and asked how our meal was, so we told her what had happened and instead of just apologizing and saying she would talk to the server, she started defending the server by saying we don't have the football packages, etc. etc.  THAT was weird, too.  It was never about that, it was the weird response and awkward service.  The manager did offer to remove the cheese dip from our bill and we hadn't eaten it all so it was pretty clear that it wasn't that great and we accepted her offer.  

Overall, it was a strange experience. I think it was the only time I've ever worried that something might get hinky with my food because a server was mad at us.  Super awkward and uncomfortable and I'm bummed because I really liked that place.  It is unlikely we will return to NFI because of it, because my husband is pretty darn unhappy.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,0,1,2,3iwITsLawS7OEze0gVWevA

We came around 5:00 on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. We walked through the restaurant inside and the decor looks great but we preferred to sit outside. They just renovated the outside area and it's a good place to hang out at. 

They have a rectangle bar outside that has seats all around three sides. One side is left open facing the strip so people can walk up and get their drinks to go. There are also tables to sit at if you prefer that. The bartenders were nice and attentive and the drinks weren't too expensive. We got a beer, three whiskey cokes, a red bull, and an adios and it came out to $53. That's especially good in Vegas and the drinks weren't weak either.

We started with the Colcannon Soup, which is sort of a potato and leak and bacon type soup. They put a dab of oil on top and the bacon gives it great texture. It really was very satisfying and could be a meal all by itself. I was very impressed with the complexity of flavor and execution on that soup. 

My entree was the Guinness Braised Short Ribs. Also very well prepared and flavorful. It could've done for another textural aspect to kick it up a notch but overall a satisfying meal.

And beer... we also thought of beer.

Nine Fine Irishmen!

The dimly lit interior was a little off-putting when we knew it was bright mid-day outside, but the faux-""countryside"" Irish pub decor was charming, the hostesses and wait-staff very friendly, and the menu intriguing. We were seated in a cozy corner booth and eagerly waited upon. We started ""breakfast"" with two beers, ""we have to"" Sarah insisted; a Guinness over Magners for her, a Boddington pub ale for me.

Sarah ordered the [starter] Guinness braised beef and mushroom pies w/ tomato relish and chive dressing and [breakfast] stack of pancakes with strawberries. I got the [traditions] Irish breakfast of two eggs, rashers of bacon, bangers, black & white puddings, roasted tomato and sautéed mushrooms. Great service - I didn't know what black and white puddings were and inquired; the server said ""blood sausage"" in a delicate manner, commenting that the name dissuades some people from trying it. Glancing over at Sarah, we cheer ""It sounds good! We're all about that!""

While you wait, they bring out a big overflowing basket of crusty bread and big triangular wedges of butter. One could get full on that alone.

By Sarah's estimation, the meat pies, after some giggling ponderance, tastes like (and this is not a knock, more like pleasantly reminiscent of) McD's cheeseburgers! The fried pastry shell, tender meaty filling, the tomato relish, the chive dressing... it comes together like a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles!

The stack of pancakes with strawberry compote and whipped cream was an eyeful. The cakes themselves were large and fluffy, griddled to a crispy exterior. The strawberry compote wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, retaining a tangy snap of fresh fruit. Add a big dollop of whipped cream and there was little need for syrup at all.

My Irish breakfast plate was simple and straightforward. A couple of cooked-to-order eggs, strips of bacon, serving of rashers (like corned beef hash?), a sausage, the black and white puddings (a dark and a light blood sausage), and a whole roasted tomato. Clean and comforting breakfast staples. With the pint of Bodington and a slice or two of buttered bread, its a hearty meal, perfect for those hazy hungover mornings.

A good find to mark the end a good time.
A fun restaurant in one of my fave hotels.
I'll definitely be coming back here again.

After having been privileged enough to visit Ireland, I'm always a little reluctant when it comes to Irish pubs in America because other than the Guinness, a lot of them really never come close to the experience that I enjoyed. Not to say they're aren't any, I just haven't found them. We've passed by this place many times in the past and never thought once of trying it out.

Located inside the New York, New York Hotel and Casino, we decided to give them a try because the wife wanted a Shepards Pie. Through the bar you see the usual: dark mahogany wood, Irish stouts, ales, and ciders on the tap, and thankfully Irish music playing. 

We asked to be seated outside which is on the strip but I wished I would have stayed inside to keep the illusion. This place could really make you forget where you are. Oh well, the strip is always great for people watching. 

Once seated I went with the cliche beer choice, a Guinness, and for the app we chose the fried sausages. Oh man! Whose idea was it to bread a sausage link and deep fry it? I want to shake their hand. This was awesome.

Next, I had me a Smithwicks and Corned Beef sandwich while the wife had the Irish breakfast. The corned beef was piled high on marbled rye and tasted great. We probably could have done with ordering entrees because of the size of the sausage app. 

I think next time, and there will be a next time, we're going to just order apps cause they all looked really good. Man. I'm still kicking myself in the rear end for not trying this place sooner.

My dad and I have been coming to Nine Fine Irishmen for around 4 or 5 years. The first time we ever visited, we were amazed at how much food we got. My dad had the fish and chips and I had the shepherd's pie. Every year that we've come back, we've gotten the same things and have always been pleased. The service has always been hit or miss, but the food kept us coming back. Sadly, last night's trip was a major disappointment and we are probably not going to ever return.

As per usual, my dad ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the shepherd's pie. The meal came out decently fast and our waitress took acceptable care of us. When the food arrived however, we were not pleased. What had once been a massive helping of fried fish and French fries had become two small strips of fish and a handful of floppy fries. My shepherd's pie looked the same, but the beef was no longer anything special, but tasted instead like a hamburger that had been broken up and drenched in mashed potatoes. The generous pieces of carrot that had been mixed with the beef on our previous visits had been reduced to small (and I mean minuscule) pieces of what I think may have been carrots, they were honestly too small to even be sure.

After we picked at our food for a half hour, my dad decided to ask the waitress what had happened to the fish and chips and she explained that they had gotten a new chef and that he had traded out regular cod for Alaskan cod. For $23, I would say that the Alaskan vs. whatever cod they were using before is definitely not worth the price. Don't waste your time here, go to Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay instead. We are so sad that our favorite Irish pub is no longer living up to what it was before. 

Honestly, DON'T LISTEN TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. If you want to spend over $20 a person on subpar food then visit, but if you are looking for big, delicious portions then don't waste your time.",7SOIBLPANWd_qIy2Bys2ig,2,0,2,sgHfk3q5G_Bz_2-cObSreQ

The downstairs area was pretty packed so we headed upstairs and were lucky to get a couple of seats at the bar. We ordered a few rounds of beers and ordered Fried beer batter Irish sausages to snack on. 

The sausages are a great appetizer to share with friends. The batter was crispy, the sausage flavorful and the dish as a whole was non greasy. I would have ordered another round but we had plans for burgers later in the night. Didn't want to get full.

There was a live band playing a few Irish tunes. One song was Whiskey In The Jar the bartender stated. Never heard of it before and really didn't catch the lyrics but it's title speaks for itself. It is an Irish Pub so the tunes fit and the crowd enjoyed it. Speaking of whiskey in a jar, we also had a few shots of that. Keep the Jameson coming!

2937621,2011-03-16,2,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"Nine Fine Irishmen is one of my favorite restaurants/pubs in Las Vegas! If there is somewhere I could go everyday of my life, it would be this pub. I cannot say enough incredible things about this restaurant to do it justice.

My boyfriend and I have been here several times, the first time being one year before we moved to Vegas from Chicago. Coming from a city filled to the brim with Irish Pubs (our favorite is Celtic Crossing downtown), we searched high and low for a great pub to relax and have some Guinness. Nine Fine Irishmen was perfect on many different levels. 

1. They have a gluten-free menu. I'm not talking about a junk gluten-free menu that has you substitute or remove certain parts of a dish and are flavorless yet expensive. This gluten-free menu IS THE BEST! Sheperd's Pie? Gluten-free. Seafood Chowder (another soup that finds its way into my food dreams at night)? Gluten-free. AMAZING SALMON SALAD - GLUTEN-FREE! The brie-stuffed chicken? Gluten-Free! JOY!

2. Live Irish Music. Need I say anything more? Good quality, authentic, Irish music including dancers and sometimes bagpipes. You can NEVER complain about this music, and it provides a nice background while sitting out on the patio watching the crowds go by.

3. Whiskey and Beer. Guinness on-tap AT THE TABLE. No further description necessary.

4. Service: Fantastic. Every single time. Friendly, informative and always attentive, even when they're busy at night. I've never had anything less than great service at NFI.

5. The BEST Jameson Martini I have ever had in my life. My boyfriend's family is Scottish (amongst other things), so the man loves his whiskey. When you take Jameson (one of my favorites), add some apple juice, a little pucker and one other ingredient, you get the ultimate mantini in martini form! You can be the most masculine man and still enjoy this FANTASTIC concotion without feeling even a bit feminine. 

Bottom line? Go there. Now. Immediately. Do not pass go, just get a martini, sit on the patio listening to the live music and get fat and happy.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,5,2,5,0fQ7Vh4f6Twy0RyWOjGvfQ

If you reserve months in advance for a party, be sure to confirm with them closer to your event at this place because there is a high chance they will call you (if you're lucky) within an 1 1/2 hours to tell you they don't have room for your party. Because this is exactly what happened to us. We had to take the patio area (not our choice) since we were told that was the only thing they that night because a wedding party had reserved our area a week and a half ago. I really think they were offered more money and we got bumped from our spot. Apparently, the little guy doesn't count in this town no matter how far in advance you reserve. Where are you going to find another venue on a Saturday night in Las Vegas for 20 people for a visiting author at the last minute nearing Christmas? NOWHERE!!

The hostess was also rude enough to ask why the planner she was there so early before the event (15 minutes). What does that matter? When the hosted noted there was a cake involved, the party planner was told no outside food was allowed and there would be a $30.00 charge for outside food. Really??!! For a cake???!! I've never known a restaurant to make objections to a cake being brought in for a special event before in my life. Alcohol brought in is understandable. By the this time, the manager had come over because the party planner was upset and getting loud. The cake fee was waived and apologized for the mix up when explained what had happened. The party did go on as planned, however, the hostess did want to know if she could close out the check midway through our event and wanted to know when we would be leaving. When informed that we weren't leaving yet, the hostess she stated, "" Well, as long as you're ordering drinks."" The icing on the red hot cake for us, was when the customized cake taken into the back for safe keeping. Every restaurant that I've ever been into knows that when a cake is specially decorated in such a manner, you bring it out to the party first to see it, maybe take pictures with it BEFORE you cut it up to be eaten. THIS PLACE DID NOT DO THAT!!! No one saw the cake, no one was able to see the care taken in decorating this cake!! They cut it all up before anyone saw it!! 

I don't know who runs this place, but save yourself the trouble and don't come here. Look elsewhere because this could happen to you and all your careful planning can be undone all because of mistakenly renting out the wrong place. Waiving the cake fee, removing a couple of items from the bill does not make up for a ruined experience with the managerial staff for a special event months in planning. I will never come back to this place again. If I could, I would give this place no stars.",3JIfGet5Unjgg6JztF8vXA,4,0,1,qcV4ZBHzaR2XBVi60JXvUg

We wanted to sit outside but if I remember correctly they don't let you sit outside past a certain time so they sat us upstairs. I ordered the fried pickles and the 14oz bone-in New York steak with a side of mashed potatoes and it was delicious. We didn't realize it at first (because we were tucked away in a little corner) but there was live music downstairs so we asked to be seated closer to the banister overlooking the downstairs.

The pub itself is beautiful, designed by The Irish Pub Company who design, manufacture, and install authentic Irish Pubs globally. The staff is extremely playful, which helps after you just lost some cash at the tables. There is a small stage for a band but we ended up leaving just before they played. Apparently they sing old and new Irish folk songs and cover almost anything you ask them to.

Sure enough, Nine Fine Irishmen was definitely something new. The place itself is set up to be unique and stylish in its own kind of way. Its like a pub, with its own Irish twist to it. Even though it may have been a small place, the layout and scenery made the place interesting. I really like the uniqueness of the dining area and the service was good. 

Of course, going to a restaurant, where I have no clue what is on the menu. It sure does bring your curiosity level to new heights. But, I decided to have the Fish and Chips, which is probably the only thing I recognize on the menu. Also a great tasting Gaelic Punch, an alcoholic drink with Cruzan Banana Rum, Malibu, Midori, Raspicello, OJ, Pineapple, and splash of Sierra Mist, is a drink I would like to have again. The Fish and Chip was great, but when the wife shared her Shepard Pie, which was a big portion for her to finish. I just love the way it tasted.  I wish I was more curious to order a Shepard's Pie, then the Fish and Chip. If I could, I would of finish the Shepard Pie, but I after indulging my Fish and some chips, I was a bit full to finish that Shepard Pie. With the fact of us being full, we were unable to have dessert. But how things turned out to be, I'm sure dessert would of been ""icing on the cake"". 

This was a new experience for me, which I totally approve on going to, and seeing it for yourself. Sure enough, I do plan to revisit this place and order me my own Shepard Pie, Gaelic Punch and next time around, I'll even order a dessert regardless how full I am.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,1,3,4,JsrET2RuvOkwtO03KHQXMQ

The atmosphere is somewhat dark but somehow appropriate to the theme. My server was a round older lady with a smile that never ended, and a strong need to please. I ordered a Newcastle Ale and inquired about the Concannon soup. She congratulated me on the choice and tole me I wouldn't be disappointed and she was soooo right. A rich creamy soup made from potatoes, cabbage, and garnished with an incredibly lean and delightful smoked bacon. My co-workers had raved about the macaroni & cheese side dish. I love good mac & cheese so my curiousity go the best of me. This too was quite rich with a creamy full flavored cheese baked to a very hot and satisfying taste and texture. The couple sitting at the next table had ordered onion rings and I have to say they looked home made with a hand dipt golden batter.

It's in New York, New York right off of the casino floor. When we got there, no hostess, I walked in and walked around confused for a while. Finally I walked back out and two ladies were positioned at the hostess stand. The hostess was pretty pompous and cold, standard issue ""I'm doing you a favor by you being here..."" eastern european from what I can tell, if you're going to be rude, at least be native to the theme of the restaurant, LOL!

OK great, she gets us a table in the pub area. No one comes around, I walk up to the bar. Pretty cool barman tells me he'll send some one over and some menus too. Finally a slow clueless but somewhat friendly waitress comes over, I ask her about the menu, she kind of stares back like she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I order a pint of the black stuff and ask for another minute. 

Not a lot of Irish happenin on this menu. One lamb stew, one clam dish (with a tomato broth??) it's not that enticing. I order the clams and proceed to drink. The pogues come on the jukebox and I start drinking more and more then the food comes, WOWWWWW, the clams are out of this UNIVERSE, and I usually prefer mussels, this were a revelation. People were probably staring at me like I was a pig... annnnnd I am. 

Had a bite of the wings (why are they on this menu???) but there were DELISH!!! I had a convo w/ the barman and said hey man, you've got beautiful fresh guinness on tap, a chef/cooks that clearly know what they're doing, and this staff (aside from him) that don't seem to be at all focused on the people or the theme of the place and a really dumb menu.

Don't eat before you go if you want to be seated at a table. They only seat people if you are ordering food. Everyone else has to fend for themselves in the bar. We actually hung out in the bar after we ate because by then they had live entertainment. So if you already ate, just do that.",LhahPrt2tC0MtR2lRQDpRA,0,0,5,jyPtsdEp88cCMFvCfeFKwA

The onion rings were VERY good and I believe made with their Bloody Mayr mix.

The Beer Cheese dip... lets just say... that was fantastic!  served with a verity of breads and what appeared to be a bit of a Parmesan crust on top of the dip, it was heavenly.  And here's the thing... I really don't like chess all that much, this was something my wife ordered.

Every time we're in Vegas, we always make sure to stop by Nine Fine Irishmen at least once, for old time's sake. And it's always consistently good. In fact, it's always just the same as we've left it - same house band, same menu, same drink prices. And to be honest, that's not a bad thing. We always know that we're going to enjoy ourselves, and relive fun moments from our past. 

Drinks are somewhat pricey; it's Vegas. They do often measure their pours, though, which is annoying. The food is alright, but we don't come here to eat - we come to drink, soak up the atmosphere, and listen to the band. Since the band takes requests, one of our favorite activities is to play ""stump the band"" and request all of the obscure Irish songs we can think of. It's fun, though, when they actually know one! 

The bartenders aren't really outgoing, but they do keep everyone well hydrated. The atmosphere isn't really like what you'd find in a pub IN Ireland (it's a little too upscale for that), but Nine Fine Irishmen still does a good job of creating a fun, pub atmosphere, and is a good change from the standard Vegas craziness. You definitely don't feel like you're in Las Vegas...until you step out the door! I prefer to sit at the bar downstairs, but the upstairs area is nice as well, especially if you're having a meal. Downstairs can get a bit rowdy and loud as the evening goes on. 

I do have to admit that there's another pub in Vegas that has recently stolen my heart, but Nine Fine Irishmen will always be special to me, and I know each time we visit will be as good as the last.

Happy Birthday, and enjoy your time."" I gave him a hearty thank you and proceeded inside with my siblings. 

The decor is really nice, and looked authentically Irish. There was an Irish Folk band playing (their name is ""Sin e Ri Ra."" Check them out on YouTube!), and it immediately got me in the mood for some brews. After a couple of drinks and some great music, everyone was having a great time. My sister-in-law was dancing with an awesome Asian leprechaun lady, everyone sang along to Finnegan's Wake, and there was even a dude wearing sunglasses in the dark and dancing a jig, all while holding a beer in his hand, no less.

Atmosphere is loud and exciting virtually everywhere, but the quiet spots are relaxing and cozy. My family and I were lucky enough to get a table upstairs tucked in a corner for some quiet and privacy.

Men of every size and shape standing around, holding a pint of Guinness (or Smithwick's or Boddingtons) in one hand, the other draped around some other bloke's neck, singing--nay, YELL-singing at the top of their lungs to ""Danny Boy."" Beer is sloshed about, there's laughing, kissing, the works--while it's balls-cold outside.

Right? Am I right? You know I'm right.

This is almost identical to what happens at Nine Fine Irishmen (except outside, you have the desert). There's someone on the piano, singing on the mike, while the drunkards try to one-up the poor sod with their drunken renditions of Irish-y versions of American pop songs.

And as much as I detest karaoke and annoying drunkards, sometimes it's fun to partake in both ventures. Nine Fine Irishmen offers this opportunity, in addition to their excellent whisky selection and standard pub fare.

Normally I would face away from the sidewalk but I decided to spend the evening staring back at the folks checking out my dinner.  :-)

I was torn between the chicken pot pie ($19.00) and the shepherd's pie and after being informed by the waiter I would be a better man than he if I could finish the chicken pot pie if I could finish it that is what I ordered.  I finished it but desert was out of the question as I waddled away.  I chose a pint of Harps to wash it down with.  The pie was good but different as I am not used to a tomato based gravy with chicken.

The service was excellent and friendly.  I got a chance to chat a bit with the waiter as his section on the patio was almost empty that early in the evening.  Going through the restaurant it was more of a crowded noisy atmosphere and a live band was playing.

Ja, man kann super in Vegas draussen sitzen, auch wenn die Temperaturen mal heisser sind. Da die Luft aber super trocken ist, nimmt man die Hitze als nicht so anstrengend wahr.

Sicher kann man auch sehr stylish drinnen sitzen und hat das Gefühl man befindet sich bei Harry Potter in der Winkelgasse, aber drinnen friert man auch schnell mal durch. ;-)
Insofern empfiehlt es sich draussen ein kühles IPA, Porter oder Wheat Beer zu trinken. Direkt vom Fass und super süffig.
Zwischen 14 und 17 Uhr gibt es eine Happy Hour. In dieser Zeit kostet jedes Fassbier 5 Dollar. Für ein Pint also ein super Angebot.

Mit dem Barmann kann man auch noch einen lockeren Schnack halten und sogar das Bier ""To Go"" mitnehmen, denn in Vegas ist ungeniertes Trinken auf der Strasse erlaubt, was im restlichen Teil der Nation eher als schwierig angesehen wird.

I came here to sober up after drinking at about three bars further down the Strip. I know I went to the Vespar Bar at the Cosmopolitan, another bar at Cesar's, then another bar in New York New York. I walked across the floor to Nine Fine Irishmen and was greeted with the sounds of a live Irish band singing ""Drunken Sailor"" (yes, I know the words!) 

After about a minute, the bartender, who was very busy helped me out. I asked about the different types and ages of the Irish whiskies that there were and he was very helpful in recommending an 18 year-old whisky (I forgot the name) and it...was...smoooooooth!!!

After about three of four more, I sobered up and made the trek up to my room. I also woke up with three kids running around the suite with no hangover. My trick?

I recommend going to listen to Ri Ra, the house band if you haven't done so already.  They play great folksy Irish songs and drinking songs that make even the most Mexican guy (me) feel Irish.

They were from Ireland and I had the chance to talk to them. They were extremely friendly and engaging with the crowd.

I had been here a couple times the last couple years, and it has never disappointed me, though it has disappointed my dining companions several times. 

Last night, I ordered the tomato salad as an entree, figuring I could sneak off some of the sides that the group was ordering. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe, and the blend of cheeses to accompany it were really surprising, but good. The sides are really where the place stands out for me--broccolini, tons of different mashed potatoes (goat cheese FTW) and my personal fave, mac and cheese. 

However, my friends' steaks were not cooked to order. Some were too rare, another (a medium rare) was barely pink. I understand that with Friday night and a large party, getting everything out at the same time is a challenge, but a too-done steak, IMO, is probably the worst thing ever.

3812070,2009-03-16,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"This is definitely one of the coolest looking places and more fun bars I've ever been to. First off, I love Irish bars. That culture has a really fun attitude about boozing, and some of the best drinks in the world. Whisky, beer and Irish cream, awesome. Second, this place has great food. It's rare to find an awesome bar, that also has awesome food. Usually I can either a) tolerate the food or b) drink enough crappy beer to not care how bad the booze is, even though the food rocks. I really love the second level of this bar. It's a huge high ceiling-ed place with dark, rich wood bars and cozy lighting. They pump Irish music in (not too loud) to add to it. There's lots of Irish decor and pictures as well. 

This place recently fell from 5 to 4 stars in my book for several reasons. 

1. They do a lot of private parties here. You may be turned away every night of your stay.
2. Prices seem significantly higher. $10 for a pint of Guinness, and it's (probably) neither an imperial or even full pint.
3. Food seems to be out of stock a lot. Certainly dishes were out of stock several times.
4. Service. We used to LOVE the bartenders here (especially Dave, the Mexican guy and the guy who served us ""shaleighleighs."" Since then, the staff is almost indignant and sometimes approaching rude.
5. I HATE to say it, but I definitely got food poisoning here once (it was the only place I had eaten in 24 hours, so I know it was them.) It wouldn't stop me from returning or recommending this place, but it's my first thought when we enter here.
6. Crowded. Sometimes it's impossible to get in.

More on the good (I feel like I left too many negatives.) Food is great here. Everything I've had was top notch. The sausage pail is one of my favorites. It's small, deep fried sausages in a little 'bucket.' They are super tender and juicy. It's a meal for two. They also have Guinness pies, which kinda like empanadas or similar. Very good, but kinda skimpy. The baked brie is good, but also a little skimpy. I like the crab dip a lot. It was very flavorful and fresh. They have a huge selection of whiskies and mixed drinks here. They actually have some interesting concoctions on their menu. They also serve several Irish beers and of course, Guinness. I highly recommend this place, with a bit of caution towards being able to even get in. Pretty much, if you can get in, I'd do it. But I wouldn't go way out of my way to do so, anymore. I really wish it was still a 5 star, but it's hard to say I love a place where the service has failed recently, and I can't even get into! Anyway, enjoy it, if you can.

3881457,2009-12-08,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"Craftsteak Vs. Nine Fine Irishmen

Craftsteak at the MGM Grand is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable, the decor nothing short of stunning, and you will, without a doubt have a fine meal here - so long as you are willing to pay the price, and a hefty price it is. The real question is if it's really worth it. Regretfully, my answer is - maybe not. 

Craftsteak barely misses the mark in my book; expect to pay more than double what you would at other equally good venues. If we bring the total picture into play, not just food, then our measuring stick has to change and I would give the place 4 stars instead of three. For me, I prefer a beautiful, friendly atmosphere and great food over museum-quality surroundings and average to good food. This review is actually a comparison/contrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect. 

Our table of three at Craftsteak enjoyed a few drinks then started off with wagyu tartare. It was nothing short of outstanding  - and an extremely large portion! I was expecting 2-3 oz but received what appeared to be more than 1/2 a pound of pure delight. It was opulent. Had I known, I would have ordered it for dinner and called it a night. The three of us actually struggled to finish it - it is very heavy. 

On to the steaks. We decided on a 32oz  rib for two and a 16 oz New York strip. As sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment which included somewhat rare hen of the woods which is a delight in an of itself, and sautéed Brussels sprouts. 

Complaints... well, I must say the steaks lacked seasoning. Sorry, Chef/Owner Colicchio, it was close but no cigar.  A great steak should need little more than some fresh cracked pepper and salt, our two steaks felt devoid of either. To add insult to injury, the rib was excessively fatty with a rather large grain of connective tissue running through the dead center. This had to be a mistake. The knives provided were surprisingly dull (security issue?) and we had a hell of a time carving through this sucker.  If not for the great company, I was seriously considering sending it back. 

We packed up some of the dinner rolls and the remaining steak to make late night sandwiches in our suite that evening- we were feeling like beached whales after the tartare. The check arrived and I handed over $375 to our waiter. Ouch. Double Ouch. I shudder to think what the bill would have been if we ordered deserts and coffee.

Lets move ahead 24 hours to a little Irish joint called the ""Nine Fine Irishmen"" at the New York, New York, right over the connecting bridge from the MGM Grand.  It's a bit loud, but bristling with a friendly, not raucous, energy and live music that was just loud enough that you could still very easily have a conversation. This time it was just myself and my wife. We sat at the deep marble bar (we didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table) and ordered two of the Guinness 250 limited edition stouts. Really yummy (if you like stout). 

We shared a bowl of their colcannon soup which is a hearty blend of leeks, potato and irish bacon. They offered it to us with fresh soda bread and European butter with a herbs. I was simply in heaven. I considered licking the bowl, but there were too many people, including my wife, watching.  It was at this point that I started feeling bitter about Craftsteak. My 16 oz NY strip arrived (round two) and horseradish crusted halibut. Perfection! I was enjoying a great beer with a simply phenomenal steak that was cooked to perfection. The halibut was flaky and succulent in every way. Here's the best part - our bill was $64.. Sixty Four dollars compared to what we spent at Craftsteak! ($375). There simply was no comparison. As much as I think Gordon Ramsay is a pompous ass, (and I have eaten at  his restaurant London), there is something to be said for his philosophy of great, simple food. Craftsteak is good, but with the exception of the tartare, does not blow-me-away. They are missing the mark just a bit by trying to be an over the top. You are paying mostly for a name and a very posh atmosphere. 

Considering the price and the quality of food, Nine Fine Irishmen was the winner for me.

There couldn't be a more Disneyfied Irish Pub in all the world; everything seemed really clean and new, it didn't reek of urine, and the barmaids wear Lord of the Dance costumes.  But it was somewhat charming. 

The bartenders told us about different whiskeys and gave us some good recommendations of places to go (and not to bother with) in Vegas.  Minus one star because for some reason we couldn't smoke at the bar upstairs (no smoking?? in Vegas??). I don't really like Ny,Ny (way too many kids), but if you find yourself there to ride the roller coaster this place is worth a visit.",xTbwHdSgPgCCI_Ok5Q-4TQ,2,2,4,nLJJiyCvIrtiJtjeyhq6aA

We arrived at about 1030ish and found seating upstairs. We asked the bartender upstairs if they had a good menu and told us they stopped serving food but we could see the waitress running food. We went downstairs to ask the host and he sent us to ask the waitress. We asked the waitress and she told us to ask the host. It was a mess. We finally sit at a table downstairs to try it and the same waitress comes up to take our order but man did she have attitude!

I sympathized with her b/c she was the only one serving but it's not really our fault. Anyway, she comes and sets the check on a chair instead of the table. (?) The attitude continued throughout the night. I just paid and took the food upstairs with my friends. We got Irish nachos and they were not what I expected. They are chips with a bunch of sauces on top. It looks like cheese sauce and some other green sauce. Not good at all.

After being seated on the second floor, we got drinks and I ordered an iced tea, Colcannon soup, and fish and chips.  The tea was brought and we placed our orders.  

Within a brief time, I got my Colcannon soup--a potato soup with onions, leeks, and savoy cabbage.  The texture was very nice and the soup was excellent.  The only reason to return here would be for a bowl of this wonderful goodness.

The entrée did not continue a good impression of the restaurant.  The wait time was longer than necessary, and the fish was not what I like when I get fish and chips.

A sign in the men's room claims that the bar was built in Dublin and transported piece by piece.  I'm not sure if I buy that, but it is comfortingly authentic in that Americanized, idealized way.  Everything's a little too perfect, but I'll take it.  Dark wood, cozy nooks, wistful signage evoking the old country...it's all there.  

Beer selection could be better, but of course they have Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, and Magner's.  I tried Murphy's Red for the first time (B+) but would have preferred Murphy's Stout.  Pints are $7, which on the one hand is highway robbery, but on the other seems in line with Strip pricing.

I get that this is a pub, and the bar area is half of the property; and I get that American bar patrons like their sports, but the 80"" TV right in the middle of the restaurant was very off-putting. The rest of the establishment is beautifully decorated, including the bar, and the giant basketball game really detracts from that carefully crafted decor. Thankfully we were seated in one of the small areas that weren't in view of the jumbo-tron, so we were able to have a nice atmosphere for dinner. There was Irish music playing quietly in the background, which was nice. 
We each had an appetizer (soup for the wife) for which there was a substantial wait. My wife's Colcannon soup was very tasty, but it wasn't pureed completely, which resulted in a gritty texture that was not particularly pleasing. I love onion rings, so I had to give theirs a try. They were different... and fairly disappointing. They were beer battered, which is a plus as I prefer battered rings to breaded, and the batter was very good. Unfortunately, there were two major issues. First, the onions were chewy, which was odd. I don't know if this was a side effect of the bloody-mary soak or a cooking issue, but rubbery onion rings were the end product. The second issue was what ruined the dish though; these puppies were beyond salty. It was actually a little painful to eat some of them. The bloody-mary soak might have been a nice touch, but whatever flavor that added to the rings was overpowered by the ridiculous saltiness. For entrees (which arrived promptly) my wife opted for the chicken pot pie and I had the shepherds' pie. This time I got the better plate (or bowl, as the case may be). My meal was quite delicious. The meat and carrot mixture was heavily seasoned and braised in wine, which balanced with the mashed potatoes nicely. The serving size was plentiful, but not so large as to make me feel stuffed (i really hate that feeling). Now, my wife's pot pie; where should I start? It was huge, my wife was unable to finish it and I doubt that I would have been able to either. It was gorgeously presented. It was very flavorful, with a creamy tomato sauce in place of the traditional cream sauce, fresh vegetables, and large chunks of white meat chicken. It was TERRIBLY undercooked. What should have been a delicious, buttery, flaky crust was only so on the outside; after that, it was layers of partially cooked dough. The sauce also didn't cook down or thicken, resulting in a very soupy filling. Altogether this was a disappointing dish (though the flavor was good, so it could be saved).
Service was interesting; our waitress alternated between spot-on and crummy and when she made a snide remark to a neighboring party as she walked past our table, my wife wasn't too happy. She was never rude to us, but she wasn't very cordial either. Maybe, like the other party, the rude comment meant for us was only heard by a different dining party.",Be3feRupSjyWkig3ife-Tg,0,0,3,jMtktrNJYv2Z1XWbbAtztQ

My spice grilled pork porterhouse with apple and peach chutney was well worth the wait (as the waitress had advised)! The King cut bone-in ribeye with roasted shallots and baby tomatoes was also mouth watering! Sides are so yummy and great to share so get two of them! Then for the following lunch went with seafood chowder and irish beer and cheese dip with an assortment of bread.  Seafood chowder tasted creamy and the clams, mussles and fish were soaked in the creamy white wine broth.

4089054,2013-01-06,2,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,I get the occasional itch to visit Irish Pubs. The atmosphere is normally different from the typical bar. And Nine Fine Irishmen confirmed my love for pubs. The band was surprisingly good. There seems to be another level but it was closed for a private party. The bottom level was small and tables seemed to be oddly placed. I did enjoy the overly drunk very Irish bar patron that was offering me $20 per beer because the bartenders had cut him off. When the band didn't seem Irish enough for him he would scream obscenities until a more authentic song started playing.  The crowd varied and everyone was friendly. The bartenders were friendly and maintained eye contact with me to get me another $10 Guinness as soon as I started running low. Not sure if there is typically a cover but not having to pay a cover and good live music will have me coming back for more.,4A83_zUaPBUn5Nc7eeOgtA,2,2,4,xZFUvkjAA8o0gZ7j_7gWGA
4090214,2010-11-26,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"The hubby and I came here for an earlier than early bird dinner on a quite Wednesday night.  I feel like when all these reviews I missed a good portion of what this place really had to offer, still I had a great dinner.  Half the place looked closed down and the upstairs area was roped off.  The stage was closed down with a projected basketball game going on in the pub area.  We were seated towards the back in a little kitchy table that was one half love seat, one half dining table.  I loved all the stuff hanging from the walls.  While we were near the bar it seemed very cozy.  

After a few late lunch crowd folks finished up we had the dining room to ourselves.  Hubby had the fish and chips and I ordered the Shepard's pie.  The server asked if I wanted the Irish cheese on top and even though I'm not a big cheese fan I said yes.  I'm so glad she asked because it was so good taking big fork fulls of the gooey cheese out of the little tin pot it comes in.  The serving itself was quite large and because it was so good I wish I could have finished it.  Even with the human vacuum cleaner with me, we still couldn't get to the bottom of it.  If you order appetizers, the Shepard's pie could be split and both people could be well fed.  I would definitely come back to this place just because of the pie.  Service was really great too.  It was about 60 bucks for the two of us, with tip and drinks without an appetizer.  Well worth the price.",cBSYFg0yZ7ua5Fl_xcsfNQ,2,0,4,QeQSu6sv1GnUqj2NLw9fYQ

4094105,2012-12-04,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I ate here this past Sunday evening for a late dinner with my girlfriend.  Whenever we walked by the place was packed but we were told that it would only be a 10 minute wait.  Less than 5 minutes later we were in and seated.  The inside of the place was cool, done mostly in wood and there was an Irish band playing like there is every night after 9.

For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start off by splitting the goat cheese salad and beer cheese dip.  The salad was pretty refreshing as it had a vinaigrette dressing with a nice big hunk of goat cheese on top of it.  However it paled in comparison to the beer cheese dip which came served with some crackers and bread.  Man was that stuff good and very cheesy!  You could even taste the hint of Smithwick's that went into it. For my entree I decided on the bangers and mash since we were at an Irish place.  It came with two links of sausage covered in a mushroom sauce covering the mashed potatoes which in turn were covered with cabbage.  My favorite part of my entree was the mashed potatoes which had some mustard seed in it which gave it a nice taste.  Other than that the rest of my entree was also good.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future but before the live band starts at 9 PM.  You see the state of NV has an 18%+ sales tax on all food and drinks when there is live entertainment or so our waiter explained to me.  So while I enjoyed the food and atmosphere that definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,0,0,4,g4TcKy2KCkhuLzxL9B-xIA

4120756,2009-01-15,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"First the good things about this place: the restaurant is very pretty.  They're trying to be your local Irish pub, if you were in Ireland, but the colors are rich, the lighting pretty, and easy on the eyes, but not flashy at all.  Seating was easy to get and the place wasn't crowded.  And that's about it.

Maybe it's because I had high expectations, but I was disappointed when I visited Nine Fine Irishmen.  I just loved saying the name with an Irish brogue and I expected there to be people dancing a jig and entertainers reciting reels or something.  We must have come at the wrong time, because that didn't happen.  

The marketing machine for this restaurant did an excellent job of selling this place, what with the ""authentic Irish pub, dismantled piece by piece and reassembled at the spectacular New York New York casino"" crap.  I just kept thinking, ""Who are the Nine Fine Irishmen?""  I checked the website, which describes each of the irishmen and makes them out to be freedom fighters.  I kept thinking, ""Does that mean they're terrorists?""

I was willing to forgive them if the food was good.  It was subpar.  I was hoping the shepherd pie would be hearty and intense with flavor.  It was bland.  My friend ordered the sausage pail, which is sausage served with whole mustard.  It tasted like sausage with whole mustard.  The beer made it go down well, but that doesn't change the fact that it was just sausage and mustard- nothing special.  

I was going to try dessert, but since we were so disappointed with our entrees, we didn't see the point.",-uLtfRYb2o8hQtjOrKNNhQ,1,1,2,uQ8f5HiiTply0OLtSE9rhg

WTF is the big allure with Irish pubs? Drunk, aggro mooks swilling dark-ass beer and eating grotesque, high-sodium high-fat carb-heavy food in a frenzied, fake-ethnic Animal House atmosphere. WHY???????

I was coerced into having lunch here the other day, and it was GROSS. I thought I'd be OK just ordering a good old-fashioned cheeseburger. Little did I know, the Irish apparently slop garlic mayo all over everything, and even a simple cheeseburger isn't good enough without adding a layer of some kinda weird flesh-bacon on top of the regular meat patty.

Aside from the food, I find the atmo at Irish pubs to be INSUFFERABLY ANNOYING. All that dark wood paneling, hearty waitresses, manically jovial Irish music blaring from the jukebox....it's my own private version of hell! Secret fact about me: I looooove holidays, but on St. Patrick's Day I crawl into a hole and HIDE -- all that green beer and all those drunk idiots make me want to VOMIT.

The sole exception to my anti-Irish-pub stance is O'Shea's...because it's more of a shithole dive bar than a pub, they keep the wood paneling to a minimum, Irish music is almost NEVER played, and my friend Brian works the door in a leprechaun costume. 

I'll reserve my VERY infrequent Irish-bar hankerings for O'Shea's! With any luck, I will never set foot in 9 Fine Rí Rá Paddy MacGillicuddy's Krazy Old-Tyme Potato-n-Whiskey Shack again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4242957,2013-05-12,2,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I love this place; it's probably one of my favorites in Vegas.  It certainly doesn't rank up there with the high end, celebrity chef restaurants, but the food is consistently good, the drinks are mostly excellent, the service has always been nice and friendly, and the prices are reasonable for where you are.  We came here with a $100 voucher to celebrate my birthday dinner (following a disappointing lunch elsewhere) and our final night in Vegas and NFI did not disappoint.

We made reservations, although I have come here without them in the past and have generally not had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a table.  If you have to wait, they give you a pager so you can go play in the casino until it's ready.  They're currently remodeling to expand the front of the restaurant and add a patio in the back, so the entrance has been moved but there are plenty of signs to direct you around.  The restaurant itself has two levels and I prefer the upper, which is a bit more spacious and not as cave-like.  There's an elevator that they are happy to let guests use if you don't feel up to taking the stairs.  We were there too early for music this time, but have seen performances in the past that were pretty good, if a bit loud.

I was very torn between the beer & cheese dip and the brie cheese appetizer and had just about made my mind up for the former when our friendly waiter mentioned that the brie was among his favorites.  I can take a hint and switched my order mid-sentence.  I can't tell you if I regret missing out on the beer & cheese dip, but I can tell you that I in no way regret ordering the brie and crackers which were delicious, a bit unusual, and had a nice kick thanks to some strategically used chili oil.  For drinks, mom started with a citrus drop (essentially a lemon drop) and I opted for something else that I now don't recall what it was.  Needless to say, I switched to citrus drops for the rest of the evening as they were far better than my first choice.

Foodwise, mom went with her favorite standby of shepard's pie, which was delicious as usual.  I agonized over the menu for a bit (noticing a theme here?) and finally decided to take a chance on the lamb stew, which I recalled my dad enjoying several years before.  I'm very particular about my lamb - I like it when it's done right and loathe it otherwise.  NFI was oh, so very right.  I managed to restrain myself from licking the bowl clean but only just.  For dessert, we split one of their decadent bread puddings, and it very nearly did us in.  We left stuffed, tipsy, happy, and with the birthday and the vacation ending on a perfect high note thanks to NFI.  You can bet I'll be back!",Xsuv6bKcPUVDWih0DtEBbA,2,2,5,cXOLkHzub_1nEsXSzejZcA

The appetizers are big enough for two but both the potato chips and curry and the bread with melted cheese  are heavily biased in the favor of dipping items to sauce. In the potato wedge case you can barely fit the dam thing in the small, They were on the whole good enough. 

My main meal of bangers and mash with mushroom gravy was surprisingly good it's hard to mess that up. Sadly my wifes ""brie-stuffed"" chicken was a dry as hell cheese under the skin concoction that was really light on the featured ingredient. They are either losing it all in the cooking  or more realistically they are being miserable bastards with it.

This dish accompanied by awful potatoes, additional charge, that were way runny .   You can tell a place that gives not a crap by the way they don't inquire about the fact that you are paying $20 for food that remains uneaten, surely that's about the biggest clue your customer could give you?

I have a couple things to say about the place, the food, and service. 

1.) Location and Decor . 
This little pub is located in new York new York, close to The Park, the fake Brooklyn Bridge,  and a number of other shops (stupidiotic, shake shack). I personally thought the decor was adorable, it really contributed to the atmosphere. Outdoor patio area is really nice and gives you a nice view of the strip. The sprinklers keep you from overheating on those warm vegas days

2.) Food
Everything we ate at this place was absolutely wonderful. My drunken peach cocktail was great - not too strong on the slcohol, but just the right amount. We started with the beer and cheese dip - tasted amazing and the bread slices and sticks that came with it were yummy and  perfectly soft/crunchy. My friend had corned beef, which he said was really good (and he is very hard to please food-wise). I had turkey panini, which although plain looking, was very flavorful and tasty. And then we had the chocolate cake for dessert. I've cream on top of it was creamy. Cake was soft and moist. Beer, chocolate, and ice cream came together perfectly to create a flavorful masterpiece in that cake 

3.) Service
Our server (Dillon 09 was on his jersey, but i don't recsll his name) was very friendly. He gave us the time we needed to order and was always checking on us to make sure we were doing well. Sladjan, was, of course, amazing as usual as well. He delivered our food quickly and always made sure to check that my friend and I were doing well and were happy and comfortable. He even entertained us with more stories and jokes. His laugh, smile and service was great.

I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas - what's not to love about the good food, location, and great service? Thank you nine fine irishmen for a wonderful experience",0RZk2dq1yczOz6VBT5K9Cg,0,0,5,CYth1HY3_NB6tyCWGo90tw

My girlfriends father loves live music, particularly live irish music, and this place did not disappoint. The band and the step dancer were both wonderful! We loved listening to them play and enjoying the atmosphere. 


The food we got was also very good, albeit expensive. However, it's the strip, so I wasn't overly surprised. I tasted the bangers and mash, the fish and chips, and the shepards pie. I LOVED my shepards pie, and the bangers and mash were really good too. The fish and chips were above average, but not amazing. 

We also got irish nachos with the corned beef on it to start. It was good, but at like 16 bucks, I expected more. 

The beer was also reasonably priced at 7.50 for a pint of Guinness (or anything else). We enjoyed quite a bit of beer!

There are few places that make me feel I am getting My value for what I'm getting at strip prices, but I enjoyed myself so much with the music and beer I found myself thinking how worth it this was! If I'm looking to spend more money than usual, but have some good food, GREAT beer, and listen to live music... I'll most likely do it here.

The sticks I'm referring to are a desert on their menu.  Like funnel cake, but in stick form; easy to dip in the three sauces they provide, strawberry, chocolate, and caramel.  Just like at the fair, but bring friends, caus they give you a lot.

Hello Irish breakfast. Eggs over medium cooked in butter with Irish bacon which is closer to ham. Small medallions of meaty bacon....really salty and really really good. Bangers, of course....because I hadn't scarfed enough yet.....grilled think tomato slices and...wait....no heinz beans? awwww....
it also comes with mushrooms, which i am allergic to and black & white puddings (blood sausage).....which are nasty.

We went back on Monday (we were in Vegas Thurs-Wed) night so they had a live rock band, which was really funny. I begged them to sing Molly Malone after my 4th Guinness, and they happily obliged.....I may have told them it was my birthday.....but whatever.

Ordered battered sausage and onion rings for apps - both were very good.

For entrees, shepherd's pie and herb crusted arugula and goat cheese salad with shrimp.

Shepherd's pie was a large portion (good), with great mashed on top but the meat was dry - no gravy!?  If it had some moisture to it, it would have actually been a really good shepherd's pie....

The shrimp on the salad was tough and overcooked (re-heated??).  Seemed like they had been sitting around too long or had been cooked the day before.

Ordered a Stoli and tonic but somehow got a Smirnoff and tonic (shown on the bill).

Perhaps it is unfair to expect to have great pub food in LV...but it's such straightforward and simple food, I would have thought it would have been a no-brainer.  Maybe Ri-Ra would have been a solid bet because it is a chain...but I will get my pub food at Olde Blind Dog in ATL :)

When you ask them about a game on tv, they direct you to someone else. How's about some fucking customer service and say you'll talk to someone  to get the channel changed for a sorting event.
Especially at halftime when the game should be on but changed to hockey.

I used to love this place and came here every time I came to Vegas. 
Nine fine Irishmen needs to check the ego and serve its customers and do the legwork to Chen Channels. It's called customer service...

The Pub, located on the second floor in Nine Fine Irishmen seems very authentic right down to the wallpaper. Probably a little too clean and neat for an authentic pub, with polished cherry-stained wood all over!

What I had...

Chips and Dips - Sliced / Fried Potatoes in an aluminum pot with dips two dips made from Curry and another dip with unknown ingredients. Interesting to say the least.

Lump Crab Cakes - The remoulade dip was what made this starter stand out. Without the dip, though, the Crab Cakes could not have stood out on their own.

Shepherd's Pie - I told myself I'm going all authentic tonight! Let's try the Shepherd's Pie! Not authentic, with a few variations that would not confuse anyone that they were in an Irish Pub. The Port Wine sauce and vegetables makes this entree interesting, but definitely not authentic. Also served in an aluminum pail.

Bailey's Creme Brulee - Pure 100% Bailey's... and nothing else. If you didn't get a buzz from the bar drinks... this ""dessert"" could cause you problems!

Black and Tan Cake - Very good. Would order this dessert over the Bailey's anytime.

An Irish band, Ri Ra, was playing this night and LOUD it was. 

The waitress / barmaids were cute in their RiverDance type of uniforms. Would not mind coming here more just for this...

In summary... The environment might be authentic, but not the atmosphere... definitely a Las Vegas feel to the whole evening. AND Bring LOTS of money, and some ear muffs to muffle out the noise which is tremendous when the Irish band is playing. And even when the band is not playing, the noise is tremendous!

If New York, New York wants this to be authentic... bring over a dart-throwing area, and some TVs showing soccer or rugby matches for starters.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,4,tmJdsz5nwyjFUfgueYbO8w

The drink prices were very expensive for what you got however, this place is located on the strip at NY NY, so what can you expect being on the Strip...

$9 for a shot of rum not even the best they had was sad, but again it's the Las Vegas Strip.

It was just ok, nothing special for bar food.  It was a great ambiance for St. Patrick's Day but not a place I would go to normally just to hang out.  If the prices were better then maybe but with so many other options in this city, its like no.

Grilled salmon entrée, with capers and tomato butter sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly, the sauce simple yet flavorful. A steal for $24.

They have the busts of the nine Irishmen prominently displayed in the bar, likely to avoid stupid questions, although i like that the concept of the bar goes beyond just the name.

Additionally, their bangers and mash and Shepard's pie are quite delicious and the presentations are straight Vegas.

The one knock, is that the place is designed a little oddly, so some of the spaces can seem very cramped, especially upstairs.

We were seated in the upstairs bar area where we had a great view of TV which was showing the Cowboys vs. Eagles game. They had a few Irish beers on the menu although most of them were super over-priced. I ended up getting a pint of Guinness anyway though. Las Vegas is clearly not a beer mecca as beer selection was generally poor everywhere we went, even places not on the Strip.

To eat, we shared an order chicken wings and a plate of Irish nachos. The wings were underwhelming as they were not spicy in the least. They also cost like $2 per chicken wing which is insane. The Irish nachos were way better though. The beer cheese complemented the potatoes really well, and the richness of the cheese was freshened up by the green onions and chives. It was a very satisfying and creative take on nachos. I would definitely recommend ordering the Irish nachos.

We started with the beer cheese dip that is served with bread, bread sticks, and this thin, cracker-like bread. The cheese has a distinct beer taste to it and was so good that we practically cleaned the bowl out. 

I ordered the shepard's pie for my entree, which arrived in a cute little metal bucket. The dish was thick and dense (not soupy) and stuffed full of meat, carrots, and onions and topped with a layer of mashed potatoes. I also got to share a side of the Mac and cheese which was ooey gooey cheesy (much like the beer cheese appetizer) and actually very flavorful and seasoned nicely. 

As this was a birthday celebration and I am over 21, I was offered a shot with a candle instead of your typical ice cream scoop or cupcake. It was a fun way to end the meal. 

Overall dinner was fairly priced, we all left full and happy, and there were some leftovers to enjoy for lunch the next day.

The whole story: We sat on the patio for dinner at an Irish pub on the Strip. When we went to order, the waitress (Rosanna) asked if I wanted cheese on my entrée, and I said sure, nonplussed. We ate the unremarkable and somewhat bland food, the bill came, our drinks were empty and we asked her to split the bill by seat. Not hard. 10 minutes go by and the waitress brought back our check, not split, and told us she couldn't split the appetizer. We sorted that out, and Rosanna took another 5 minutes to spilt our checks by seat. Drinks were still empty. 

Once we got the split checks (which she had to auction off because she didn't remember who had what), I noticed there was a $1.50 upcharge for the cheese that the waitress didn't bother to tell me about, and tax and subtotal weren't on the split checks. Tax is different in Nevada than Texas (duh), so without tax listed on the bill, we didn't know how much it was. I had to do the math myself to figure it out. Thank Goodness I know how. I put my card in the check presenter intending to ask about the cheese but Rosanna whisked away all our payments before we could ask her anything.

She got back after another 10 minutes (still no refill or offer to refill drinks) and couldn't remember who had what again. My sister in law paid with two twenties, which should have covered her bill. It didn't,  come to find out there was also a 10% ""entertainment tax"" we didn't know about. We thought okay,  it's Vegas. It sucks but no big deal. My sister in law had to get change, which was brought back in bigger bills (no $1 bills to ensure the waitress got an appropriate tip).

I let the waitress know that I was unhappy with the cheese upcharge about which she didn't bother to tell me. I told her I used to wait tables and would never have just charged someone extra for something they didn't ask for without telling them, or offering something that was an upcharge without first divulging the cost. Rosanna said that she was sorry, but dismissed my concern because ""$1.50 isn't that much."" I said that maybe it wasn't to her, but it might be to some people and it's the principle of the matter rather than the actual charge that irked me. She shrugged and walked off. 

She ruined the vibe of the whole evening with her apathetic attitude. I still can't believe it.",yfpvNUCBb8NR_fA6zsSGgQ,1,0,1,NGzwDLroGL4JvG81BWliNw

Nine Fine Irishmen is sprawling, dark, and comfy; like a Bennigan's on crack.  It's precisely that cracked-out quality that reminds you you're in Vegas and not in a Dublin pub.  

The restaurant is huge and furnished warmly, and your fellow diners are likely to be in various states of intoxication--from stone cold sober to the mother next to us in our snug (and I do mean snug; our tables were a foot away from each other, tops) whose tipsy husband kept encouraging her to use her ""library voice"" while their tween son looked like he wanted to gouge out his ear drums with a salad fork.

The menu boasts a lot of traditional Irish favorites, which is great and all, but not exactly the sort of fare you want to chow down on before a night of drinking, gambling, and moving up and down the strip.  On the whole, it's heavy.  I tried the Shepherd's Pie, for example, which is basically under-seasoned ground beef and mashed potatoes served in a metal pail.  My bad.  The portions are really generous, though.  I had enough meat and potatoes left in my bucket that I could've carried it around with me all night, handing out ""pie"" by the handful to delighted passersby. 

All in all, Nine Fine Irishmen isn't a bad restaurant.  In fact, the Drunken Onion Rings were pretty alright.  It's just that, given its location and clientele, it's a dumb restaurant.",b8kAVcWvsLXLB8HUjruqTQ,0,0,3,xDfefyRJ0ZpdfyaGhI1GHQ

Husband had Guinness. Now, he's been to the Guinness factory in Dublin where they actually teach you how to ""properly"" pour a Guinness and according to him Nine Fine knows how its supposed to be done!

Started with the fried pickles (I can't resist those little bastards anytime they are on the menu) which were very good & served with a dill based dipping sauce.

Also had the deep fried sausages. Deep fried sausages? That's almost like telling me there was deep fried bacon on the menu. They were also very good and were served with a spicy mustard sauce. YUM

We split the Chicken Pot Pie - because its HUGE and we had been eating all day for the past two days. BUT, it is big enough to split even if we hadn't been eating ourselves into oblivion.

We asked to be seated outside because it was such a nice night out.  That was the first big mistake.  After being seated, I noticed that there was only one server working the entire outside area.  There were at least six or seven tables occupied.  She gave us water and came back fifteen later.  We decided to order the fried mac and cheese, the pot pie, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn.  

Food took an extremely long time to make its way to our table.  The mac and cheese came out first.  It was crispy on the outside, and soft and gooey inside.  This seemed like a fantastic preview of the quality of food that was to come.  However, the mac and cheese would be the only part of the meal.  The pot pie, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn came out next.  The pot pie was served in an actual pot, with the lavish pastry puff on top.  The pastry was good, but the inside was disappointing.  For the record, expect tomato soup inside the pot pie because that was exactly what it looked/tasted like.  We did not get bowls to share the pot pie.  Nor did we get any spoons for the two sides.  

It took a long time for the server to check up on us so the GF walked up to her and asked her.  She said that she was busy taking orders with her current table... After a while, she made her way to our table and asked us what we wanted.  We asked for bowls and spoons.  I am going to assume no one has ever asked her about bowls because she was beyond puzzled.  It took her awhile to understand what we were talking about.  She said she did not have any bowls, but would get some spoons.  She again, took her time bringing the spoons to our table.  As for our sides, the mashed potatoes were bland.  The creamed corn was also bland.For dessert, we had the bread pudding.  It was very tasty, and quite the presentation.  

It makes me sad knowing that the appetizer and dessert were better than the main course and sides.  I really expected more from this place.  In all honesty, I don't blame the server.  Lack of competence starts from the top down.  Management is at fault here.  They need to hire more workers, and check quality of food being brought out.  

Bowls are necessary for the pot pie.  One probably should't finish the entire thing by his/herself.  Plates are not ideal in sharing the pot pie because of the soup inside.  Time for this place to invest a few dollars and get more dinnerware.

Cure kids cancer! I think we can all agree on that! (Okay, did not see the review going there...)",wqkdqreUgj7MFLFqUsMDQw,0,0,4,tBt-NUMqaRn6HBqfZjCfgg

5027184,2013-07-27,2,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"Came here for an early dinner based on the raving Yelp reviews and menu (online). We were majorly disappointed. Service and initial food rating would have been 2 stars, but factor in food infection, they get 1 star by default because ZERO is not an option. Their current menu is also different from what they post on their website...Patty said the website hasn't been updated yet. Read on for explanation and details.

We were greeted and seated promptly, so things started off promising. About 5 minutes after seating, the waitress (Patty) attended to another nearby table and then said to us that she'd be right back to take our drink orders. 10 mins later, we contemplated leaving...15 min wait just for a drink order is ridiculous! And the restaurant wasn't very busy. She finally took our drink order, so we stayed and gave her the benefit of the doubt because the reviews were good. Patty's service was very slow and lacking throughout our dinner. She had a limp and seemed like she was trying to attend to all her tables at the same time regardless of when they were seated to save herself from walking back and forth. The table next to us came in 15 mins after us and had their drink and meal order taken at the same time as us. Patty even asked them how their meal was about half way through their meal but didn't stop by to ask us the same. The only thing she moved fast on was getting us the check and closing out our ticket. Patty was lucky that my Mom paid and was nice to give her a decent tip. I would have given a dollar.

Food was okay...the best was the mac & cheese and the grilled asparagus sides. We also had:
- chicken pot pie...creamy tomato base was different and just okay.
- tossed green salad with chicken...just okay, nothing special.
- rib-eye steak...no seasoning and tasted okay (read more on this below).

Initially I would have given 2 stars for food and service, but after my partner got sick (food infection, possibly caused by Salmonellosis, causing vomiting and diarrhea) from the steak, I'd give ZERO stars. Granted, she asked for her steak to be rare, meat is supposed to be properly stored at the correct temperature and dated to ensure freshness. The steak did not taste ""off"".....I had a small bite but didn't get sick. The cut and quality of the meat seemed fine, but nothing spectacular and definitely not worth the $27 price.

From our experience, we completely disagree with most of the Yelpers this time and will never be eating here again. We probably would have been better off eating at the American restaurant with a NY strip and crab legs special for $14.99.",88wthM2TViKXaKetkc61hA,1,0,1,AgrlKY1Rlr0GGrpNvpJi_Q

I had never been intimately involved with any one of Irish kin before so it was a new kind of culture I was being exposed to. There was an awesome band playing that night and the crowd and I were totally digging it. I also had a newfound love for cider which was all I drank when I came here. The upstairs bar and lounge area is really pretty in addition to the downstairs decor. It really feels like a true Irish pub. There was even a couple celebrating their marriage there that night and they were coming all the way from Ireland! And they were all smiling ear to ear so of course you know they should have great taste in an American Irish Pub. I didn't get to try any food, just had some drinks and enjoyed the music and danced all night.

I can't say anything for the food here, but alcohol is bought at Vegas pricing, so expect to pay a little more for that pint of Guinness you're about to down then you would normally expect to at what would be considered a local dive.

Everyone inside seems to generally be extremely friendly and extremely drunk, so expect some beer sloshing, loud laughter and yelling as opposed to talking.

My fish and chips were soggy and miserable. UGGGG. Susan and I ended up pushing our plates away. The only dish that kept us from walking out was the Beer Cheese Dip that we ordered.

They have a ton of beers on tap and drink choices. We wanted to order food but the kitchen was closed already. 

Overall this is a nice place to chill and have a drink. It's noisy downstairs but not too bad upstairs.

This is not your typical Irish pub that pops up in every town lately.

Downsides, for dinner it's very LOUD with bands cranking out tunes while you eat.  Don't expect to have a quiet, intimate conversation.  But, when your sitting at the bar, the sound is fine.

Love, love, loved this soup...gosh wish I had a bowl right now...
Fish and chips were moist and flakey.  Perfect pairing with a fresh glass of Guinness.  I am NOT a beer drinker, but when beer is this fresh--it's a  whole new world 
And speaking of music, a live band takes center stage about 9:30 or 10.  And just like in the Ireland, the later it gets, the livelier the place becomes!! People start dancing and pounding on the wooden floors and bar...but just before you hit the dance floor, DO NOT pass on the golden bread pudding and an Irish coffee--and not a fake redi-whip cream coffee, this is a legit Irish coffee with Jameson and real thick Irish cream 

I would have given this place 5 stars if not for the Sheppard's pie! The Sheppard's pie was blah.  No flavor...the chef must have forgotten to season

We drank a many Guinness and danced to the Irish music. The entire group I was with had a good time. Now I did not eat any food here, as I was on a liquid diet here so I can not review on that.

Other great things about this place is that there were plenty of table to sit down at and talk while the band played.

That stuff is off the hook (and this is coming from a person who doesn't even like beer.) I tried to re-create it at home and it paled in comparison. I mean, it was okay but it wasn't as bubbly, gooey and as mind-blowing as that dip. Don't skip the dip unless your vegan or allergic or whatever...

As a meal, I had the Colcannon Soup. I loved how the chunks of bacon contrasted the lightness of the soup. The soup itself reminded me of how my mom makes her broccoli and cheese soup -- all the ingredients blended smoothly together. Yum. It was good, but temperature wise it was only lukewarm. Lukewarm soup just bums me out :(

We also got the Bangers. They were just okay for me, although my hubby really enjoyed them. Nothing super memorable or special about them for me. I WISH i would have followed the reviews to finally try some Shepherds pie.

Not particularly a Casino for ""destination"" dining, America a serviceable 24-hour spot with good doughnuts and Gallagher's certainly not without its fans, it was with two local writers that lunch was enjoyed at New York-New York's touristy Nine Fine Irishmen on Saturday, the results mostly in line with what might be expected from a Las Vegas Boulevard ""theme"" eatery, though several signatures actually proved quite well made.

Located just off the gaming floor with a patio available to those simply looking for a place to smoke and grab a pint, Nine Fine Irishmen is presented as a True Irish Pub and featuring lavish decorations including everything from Lady Justice to gnarly looking taxidermy the two-story space additionally offers no lack of seating options, a hefty wood table found in one alcove while our table sported a throne.

Open from 11a-11p seven days a week, Irish Folk played overhead by day with Live music on stage by nine, the menu at Nine Fine Irishmen entails a highly varied experience clearly intended to suit the interests of any sort of guest, even Vegetarians and the Gluten sensitive likely to find something worthwhile amongst the extensive bill of fare.

Dining at the odd hour of 3pm, dinner options available to our group despite the technical start-time of five, it was on the heels appetizers that I arrived to meet the rest and although well sated from a prior dining engagement I could not help but sample the now-somewhat-congealed Beer Cheese signature, the depth of flavor actually quite impressive despite the tasteless white bread.

Treated to pleasant service that thankfully dresses the role without putting on a fake accent like other ""Pubs"" in town, it was a touch perplexing that neither tablemate had opted to order any of Nine Fine Irishmen's green-box-highlighted menu classics and although the health-conscious Mahi-Mahi was well cooked with great flavor complimented by horseradish alongside fresh vegetables the hefty plate of lamb chops was severely compromised by a pungent crust that buried the lightly cooked meat's intrinsic gaminess, the dark brown sauce adding a unique bit of flavor, but at the same time seeing natural flavors further lost.

Debating Shepherd's Pie and Bangers before finally opting for Fish and Chips it was alongside the surprisingly crisp and well-executed ""Irish Nachos"" that two planks atop a pile of fries arrived, the tartar sauce cast aside in favor of malt vinegar plus ketchup with both parts of the plate quite good even when compared to some of the stuff in London, the Cod itself moist and meaty while the golden shell was virtually oilless and faintly accented by beer.

More impressed by the Macaroni and Cheese here than by others gussying it up with all sorts of junk it was onward to sweets that the meal progressed, and with only two items sampled thanks to the limited sweet-tooths of my companions the results were split right down the middle - my steamy Bread and Butter pudding turned from cup tableside with a pillowy texture not dissimilar to Monkey Bread with two excellent sauces while the ""Bomb"" selected by others lived up to its billing by failing completely, the center most certainly not 'soft' and the dried out exterior only saved by slowly melting ice cream.

*** No worse than other upscale Irish Pubs speckled around the country, Nine Fine Irishmen is precisely what one might expect walking through the door and although a bit more expensive than some might consider acceptable the price is mostly right for its execution of the classics...not to mention the service, location and décor.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,8,3,lueHwG3lqYSwIlLeeHTHRQ

The shepherds pie was literally like someone put in ground beef and carrots with mashed potatoes and no extra flavors. It was like something I'd make for my dog. Sorry. The creamed corn had no flavor whatsoever. It was so dull. The sodas for some reason were not carbonated. I had a sierra mist and I thought it was flat so I changed it to a coke. Same problem but I didn't want to complain and seem stuck up. 

I did however like the rack of lamb (med rare). It was perfect. WARNING! They do not come with sides, but when you do order a side item it is pretty big so its enough for two people to share. 

The hostess was very sweet. The server was nice but rarely checked up on us. Didn't get a refill either.

I was looking forward to eating here all day hoping to get the same great taste I received at the Irish Restaurant in Mandalay Bay, but I was very disappointed. Hopefully when I eat at the other location tomorrow I wont be dissatisfied.

TIP: It wasn't only my table that felt this way. When the bus boy came and asked us how was everything we told him our opinion on the food and he agreed. He said it was a new chef and they claim everything is the same as the Irish Restaurant at Mandalay but the other restaurant was  much better to his opinion too.

I had made a reservation for after Zumanity. With Yelp and Open Table this process could not be anymore easy. I had originally used Yelp to look up their number, but found that I could just input a few simple answers and have a table waiting for us. 

When we got their at 9:20, they were ready for us and guided us upstairs. Originally disheartened because their was a live Irish band downstairs, we trudged upwards. The pout soon was replaced with glee when we saw our little private alcove though. This table set in the back of the top floor is perfect for parties of 6-8. It is away from all of the chaos, but you can still hear the music.

The Big Appetizer Platter ($18) is a large mountain of wings, onion rings, sausage, and deep fried sausages. It sounded so good with the beers, but not so much as the night progressed. The Steamers ($14) was the best starter. These little morsels drew in all the garlicy/tomato flavor of the broth and added a nice saltiness once they opened up. The Beer and Cheese Dip is like eating a bowl of warm brie. It is decadent and rich. Smothered on bread, it will render you immobile for a while. 

For a proper hen night (we ran into British people who called it that), the $5 shots of Jameson was an inexpensive way to get the bride plastered. All of the usual beers are here, but the mixed drinks are good for people who might not normally like beer, Snakebite (Harp and Magners Apple Cider), Black 'N Black (Guiness and Black Currant), Black Velvet (Guiness and Magners) made the bride happy.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,2,4,RStF1a5FGNdnG1i0RCG7Ew

They also had a large cheese platter and dessert platter. They had about 4 cheese to choose from and a couple sides that go along with the cheese. I really liked the one that was a mix of huge garlic, herbs, and oil. They also had several different types of grilled vegetables.

5522418,2014-12-09,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"This is, I'd say, the third-best Irish pub in Vegas, not to say that it's not at all a great place to dine, drink, and have a bit of craic (which, incidentally, is the Irish word for fun, enjoyment, and fellowship). The only places I found that beat it out are Rí Rá in the Mandalay Bay and McMullan's, a free-standing joint near the Orleans Hotel & Casino a bit west of the strip on Tropicana.
The interior of the place is capacious but doesn't feel cavernous, as there's an upper level and a lower level to keep things cozy. The decor is Irish, a bit on the fancier side, with bars upstairs and downstairs full of knick-knacks just like you'd find in pubs on the other side of the Pond. The tables feature benches, different kinds of chairs, and several of the ones upstairs are in little nooks so you can have a bit of privacy if you desire. All of this is quite authentic; pubs in Ireland feel quite a bit like this (although most of them are smaller).
The food is superb. My favorite is the Shepherd's Pie, which is a mixture of ground beef, onions, and culinary magic topped with mashed potatoes, baked in a steel lunch pail like a shepherd would actually use. The beef is perfectly cooked, the potatoes are perfectly browned on top, and digging into the hearty portion makes you wish you could chase woolly animals around a field to burn some of the calories off once again.
The desserts are great; I'm always a fan of bread pudding, and this place delivers. They probably have cheesecake, too, being that they're in the New York New York and somehow, cheesecake is a staple of any restaurant professing any sort of connection with the Empire State, but since you're looking to dine in an Irish restaurant, I recommend that you forego it for the bread pudding. You can have a more authentic experience with your Irish pub atmosphere and you can thank me later.
The service is great; usually it was just my fiance and I eating together, so we'd sit at the bar and revel in the friendly face-to-face interactions with the bartender, but the table service is also nice and friendly so you can't go wrong there. Ask your server for what their favorite dish is, as well; you really can't go wrong with anything they serve, and you should definitely find out what other options are instead of just going with my recommendation of the Shepherd's Pie. The sandwiches, for example, are also fantastic.
Finally, the beer! They've good beer, including Guinness and Harp and Smithwick's (pronounced Smithicks for the uninitiated; just drop the W), and they're poured in good portions for good prices. So sit back, relax, have a pint of the dark (or light) stuff with your meal. And enjoy the craic!",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,2,0,5,0wmq-dAUIms1DI847qtC3Q

5588403,2012-03-22,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I love the atmosphere at Nine Fine Irishmen (and have given an extra star mostly because of it) but the food leaves a bit to be desired. 

What I lived:  I really enjoy the live music they have there (saw the Celtic Rockers most recently and thought they were pretty decent) and I like the cosy seating that some spots in the restaurant have to offer.  There service that I've had has been pretty decent too.

 What I didn't like: 

The food portions were huge and on paper looked promising. In reality though, the dishes we had lacked flavor and weren't nearly as interesting as the descriptions might lead you to believe. We ordered ""drunken onion rings"" that boasted a bloody mary marinade that the rings didn't have the slightest hint of. We also ordered the pork tenderloin, which while probably the best dish we tasted, was mostly show. I ordered the Blue Cheese steak which was incredibly disappointing; it lacked any seasoning and relied instead on the blue cheese and the horrid au jus style sauce to give it any flavor, but it wasn't enough. It was a huge cut of meat and I would gladly have had half the food with a little better quality and preparation. 

 I ordered the ""dubliner"" after dinner and while it had Jameson listed as it's first ingredient, it was completely imperceptible to either of us (it tasted like a sickeningly sweet appletini). We'd ordered Jameson neat before dinner and I get the feeling that they cut cost corners by being stingy on the whisky; not a good practice for an ""irish"" bar. The waitress, to her credit, had it remade (it came back entirely different the second time) when she noticed that I wasn't drinking it and she took it off of our bill. 

 Perhaps my latest visit was an off night; I've had better from them in what now feels like the distant past. I'll probably go back again for the live music, dessert and  (simple) drinks, but I won't drop another $100 for dinner there again without some proof of redemption.",zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q,2,0,3,pvJNTTZcWGXBkLifp5lPqA

The chicken pot pie was popular among the patrons beside us and will definitely be something we try next time we visit. I also have my eye on the lamb dishes too...

The other highlight for me besides the food was Sin E Ri Ra (the band) and Tara Reid (the dancer). If they're on stage I guarantee you'll have a good time. They fulfill requests with your tips and do a great mix of folk, traditional Irish song, and classic singalongs. They do the best rendition of ""Country Roads"" I've ever heard!

If Disneyland and some podunk Dublin pub had a love child, it would be ""Nine Fine Irishmen"" 

I've never been to Ireland. The closest thing I've been to Ireland (or might ever be) was a hazy, boozy, nebulous Saturday / early Sunday that ended at this faker than fake Irish bar, inside the fake NY - Greenwich Village-esque part of NY-NY in Vegas. 

The night went as your average, nonsense Sodom and Gomorrah , we are all going to die in a fiery wrath of Godly fireball, Vegas night. We hopped around from the Hard Rock , over to the grotto at the Wynn. Finally, one of my friends says ""hey, let's go over to New York , New York""....It's one of my least favorite casinos in Vegas because knowing New York fairly well, it just seems cheesy. 

So against my better wishes, this horde of liquored up stooges I call friends of mine make it to New York New York and try and go to ""Bar at Times square"". You know the one where you inevitably sing along to Wal-Mart renditions of Billy Joel and Elton John songs. That place was packed. 

We walk around the urea a bit and stumble into ""Nine Fine Irishmen"" Well jumping Jehoshaphat! The decor was a mix of Vegas excess mixed with every two bit pub, dive and European styled watering hole you've ever been in. It was packed, loud and cracking' There was a live band eponomously named ""The McIntires"" and as far as I could tell, they were in fact Irish. Besides them and maybe the Guinness on tap being served there, they were the only true Irish element inside the ""pub"". 

You know what, it didn't matter. They were playing rockous, Pogues inspired Irish Rock complete with Riverdancers. Chants of ""when I say you, you yell Mc Intires!!"" left my throat raw. We pounded about 3 pints of warm Guinness and for a minute, I actually believed I was in Lord of The Rings at the ""Prancing Pony"". The spell worked so well that I hardly noticed when about six or seven guys staged a faux Irish pub fight. How do I know it was fake and there to add to the realism of the joint? Well, they all of a sudden started ""fighting"" for no apparent reason to me (I was next to them) but not a single guy threw or landed a single punch. It looked like a standard playground fight when I was 5 years old. 

The night ended with all of us beginning to speak Gaelic sprinkled with gibberish. Though the bathrooms were clean nobody cried, I still could have sworn I was in Ireland. 

Be sure to catch the nightly staged midnight rabble.

Every bar we went into in every casino had muted pastel lights and space age decor, and was filled with young, blonde, huge-racked girls in tiny clothes, and the men who love them.  The bar tab was inevitably a month's rent, and the drinks were watery.  
This is why Nine Fine Irishmen is different.  Don't get me wrong; there are a large number of the young, blonde, huge-racked girls in tiny clothes and the young men who pine for them here, but there's also a nice mix of people closer to my age.  It really invoked the pub atmosphere I know from the U.K.  The decor is all dark wood, and I think is the actual interior of a pub shipped over from Ireland.  If it's not authentic, it's an excellent replication.  
The house band, Ri Ra, was great!!!  They mixed old pub drinking songs with Pogues covers and other Celtic rock songs.   The beer and whiskey selection was excellent as well.   We were kind of hungry, but none of the appetizers appealed to us.   Still, it was a good time.

We had reservations and they marched us upstairs.  While there was plenty of room it was stone cold dead up there so seemed like we were in an empty restaurant.  Food that I tried:
- beer and cheese dip: decadently cheesy with a bunch of breads to eat it with. Cheese was hard to just dip out, you have to use your fork or knife or risk stringing it all over the table.  It wasn't mind blowing but still pretty tasty.
- chicken pot pie: creamy tomato broth was kind of what made it taste weird to me and the chicken was in perfect square chunks which made it seem like those frozen dinner chicken pot pies, but overall it was good.  The bread covering it was soft and pillowy and delicious.
- Shepherd's pie: authentic Irish it isn't, but you are in Vegas so it is decent.  I'd pick the chicken pot pie over this though...beef seemed almost ground up rather than in chunks.
- Creamed corn: home run side!  How can you not like corn that has been made extremely unhealthy by being creamed?  

Service was efficient and, of course, helpfully upselling.  However, I like a double drink for not the full double price so I can dig it.  Cost is like everything else in Vegas - bit pricey but this place isn't going to break the bank.

Overall an A-OK joint.  Probably a better place to drink and get appetizers but still not bad for a full meal if you have people in your group that prefer a casual, more bar-like atmosphere.",L27OShvycGmVOkAxD1h86A,2,1,3,TfwwnmEOZdG_PJopqgHXTQ

The other reviews are accurate when they say the service leaves something to be desired. Our party of three sat for about 15-20 minutes before our server finally noticed us.

Started with the baked Brie which was tasty and the bourbon soaked cherries and balsamic drizzle set it off nicely. 

The herb grilled chicken looked promising, but came out dry, the glaze almost saved it but not quite. Couldn't bring myself to try the mushroom muffin but an order of mushrooms as a side helped. 

The lamb stew had decent flavor but was more of a soup with very little substance and the shepherds pie was overall unimpressive which saddened me after the hype from other customers.

Creamed corn had so much heavy cream in it, it was closer to tapioca than anything else and the lack of any other spice including salt made the texture strange and overall inedible. 

Take home story: come for the booze and live music. With so many other options for food, this one is tolerable, but not worth seeking out.",L0zkEpnjWdrZNBioJjzsjA,0,0,2,5_NBa91wY0O2DC1WVy9mWA

They have TVs to watch various games, it's a comfortable atmosphere, and the beer/cheese dip appetizer I had was surprisingly delicious.  I'm from Wisconsin and when you're from there you know your cheese but this stuff was REALLY good.  We also were just in the mood for a snack and it turned out to be plenty filling.

When you're down there anyway spending gobs of money on all sorts of entertainment, this place is a pretty good stop for slowdown in the action.  Good down to earth feel; highly recommend.

5765741,2013-05-25,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere they were able to create, it's a very spacious 2 story Irish pub in the midst of the gaudy New York New York casino in Las Vegas.  Though it does seem somewhat artificial, like a corporate themed restaurant that hired customer insight specialists to put together what the mass consumer beer drinking target demographic would expect in an Irish themed bar, that doesn't mean it doesn't appeal to the average party of gastropub going fans.  Besides you're in Vegas, who goes to places to scrutinize every detail anyway?  

I was seated upstairs in a semi-private table corner, as the bar was full and a local Irish 4 person band was playing to the delight of the crowd.  The hostess took me upstairs and pointed out the 9 busts of heads, who I think were the owners of the restaurant.  There was a whole description of them somewhere in the menu or on the side, but I didn't bother to read it.  They have an excellent selection of beer and cocktails, which would have been seriously disappointing if they didn't.  

For the appetizers, they had a whole selection of standard gastropub food and then some.  If I lived here, I could see myself coming in and trying out their meat pies or sausages just as a meal in itself or as accompaniments to beer.  But since I wanted to try something different, I opted for the beer and cheese dip.  It was interesting, they serve it with different types of bread, which gives it a variety of textures.  The dip itself is a combination of 4 cheeses, which blended into a cheesy, salty range of flavors.  It was good, but after 3 or 4 bites I had enough.  Something about mixing that many cheeses together didn't sit well with me and I opted for munching on the breads sans cheese instead.

For the main dish I had the shepherd's pie, which is one of my favorite things to eat.  They make it ok here, the whipped potato on top was light and fluffy and the ground beef (which makes it cottage pie actually) underneath was flavorful and hearty.  I would definitely recommend the dish and one of their stouts to wash it down.  Looking at other tables, I want to come back and try their chicken pot pie.

Located in New York New York, the inside part of the restaurant is supposed to look like an Irish pub, but it looked like what an Irish pub would look like if it were in Disneyland. We sat on the patio, which was great at night, because it's a pretty good view of the strip and still pleasantly warm without the sun burning your skin off. 

Was the food good? It was pretty decent, better then I expected. Was it overpriced for what it was? Yes of course it was. But I still enjoyed it.The table enjoyed an appetizer of beer battered Irish sausage with Guinness mustard dipping sauce. It was okay, I personally like my bangers a little meatier and less squishy. 

My boyfriend and I decided to split the Shepard's Pie, which they serve/bake in a metal bucket thingy. It was enough food for the both of us and $18. I still think my mom's Shepard's Pie tastes better, but she's really British, and of course home-cooking is always better. However some of the other members in our party got the steak, which is crusted with Blue Cheese for around $26 and everyone was raving about it. 

People enjoyed Guinness, Murphy's, Harp, and more. So it's definitely a good place to go to get these things on tap in Vegas. However, they serve you in wimpy half pints for the same price as a regular one. Kind of sad.

We had fun here, and only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table with a party of 7. They had live music, and a real live Irish dancer who's tapping could be heard filtering through the bar onto the patio where we were sitting.

After a very long flight, not really the flight but the delays in San Jose. I arrived in Las Vegas... about 90 minutes later than I had expected... I had already made reservations at Nine Fine Irishmen but I had to constantly push it back due to the delays... Finally got to the hotel and just threw my bags on the floor, didn't even change or wash up or anything, because I was absolutely famished!

My girlfriend and I walked over to NY NY and were greeted by one of the hosts there and asked us if we wanted to sit downstairs or upstairs. I asked which is louder and he offered to take us in and we could have our pick which was great. We decided to sit up stairs overlooking the stage where a band was playing a lot of Irish fare.

The decor and the audacity of the place is awesome. It's like Ireland threw up from across the pond and it all landed in this restaurant. I loved it from the minute we walked in.

Now on to dinner...

We started dinner off with the Drunken Onion Rings. Now I've had my fair share of onion rings in the past and I would have to say that these fat behemoths take the cake hands down. They were huge but they were cooked to perfection. The batter was amazing and the onions on the inside were cooked perfectly.

Now onto the entrees for the evening, my girlfriend decided on the Pan Roasted Red Snapper which looked out of sight and I'm sure was very tasty since there wasn't any left for me to even try. haha. And I had the Pork Porterhouse, which when it came out I was actually in shock. It was HUGE! And it tasted incredible, especially with the apple and peach chutney.

Side dishes, which I wish would have come with the meal instead of having to dish out another $5 each were great never the less. I ordered the colcannon mashed potatoes, which we both enjoyed immensely. And my girlfriend ordered the whipped sweet potatoes which were awesome too.

All in all, I'd have to say that this restaurant will most definitely be visited again the next time we are in Vegas!",tFy8QQLH9z9wspHBB1fRiQ,0,0,5,Kbb3yn3W_CIL9qraKYIJnw

The magners cider on draught had a very yeasty odor due to either poorly cleaned draught lines or glassware.

Tourist trap. 

They have a modern POS system, but will not split bills for a 10 top. We pen and papered to figure out each couples total all while our server hung over the table. Just split the bill for people and they will be happier, tip better, and turn the table faster.

Both meals were cooked perfectly.  The short ribs provided a generous portion and 2 people could actually share unless you want leftovers.  The bacon was a nice touch to the potatoes and short rib.
The cream corn was so so.  I think it's just not my cup of tea.  You have to ask for Irish soda bread and the butter sat in an oil that had a rosemary or sage flavor I didn't care for. 
We split dessert since we were taking leftovers home and saw alot of positive reviews on the bread pudding, so we have it a try.
I am not a big fan of bread pudding so this was something I had just a bite of.  They serve it hot in a mug and the server empties it out on your plate.  It is hot and you pour the sauces over it. The dessert wasn't bad, but it just wasn't my preference.  It is large enough to share for sure.

It was a very good start to RW, but not without a few down notes.  Just my luck, this was the first day of MGM-Mirage's paid valet parking, which cost me $13 plus a $2 tip to help pay for the parking lot that the casino giant should have built before opening its new 20,000 seat T-Mobile Arena.  It is the valets who will suffer.  I used to always give a $5 tip but they will be lucky to receive anything now.  I noticed that none of the few drivers before me extended any tip at all when they claimed their vehicle, and I was profusely thanked for my token recognition of good service.  At least the pathway to the top of valet parking was wide open!

The other downer for me was that because I had just devoured a giant fillet of Pecan-Crusted Walleye Pike at Big Dog's less that 15 hours earlier, this time I was not in the mood for any more fish.  So instead I ordered the Irish Banger & mashed potatoes.  When I did so, in my mind two gravy-laced sausages appeared.  But on my plate there was only a single specimen.  I rechecked the menu, and--sure enough--""Banger"" was reflected in the singular.  My mistake!  

Diane's bowl of Tomato Gin Soup--which I got to eat--was a nice, creamy soup; and my Mixed Green Salad with Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onions, and Balsamic Vinaigrette a colorful and interesting first course. 

The sausage was good, and the Mustard Mashed Potatoes and Mushroom Jus great, but one little sausage to me is not enough bang for my stomach.  Bread & Butter Pudding was sweet and filling, with lip-smacking sauce that almost made up for my dainty entree--but not quite.  Meanwhile, my two female companions very much enjoyed their two rounded golden hunks of battered Fish and Chips.  Good complimentary Soda Bread & Irish Butter helped to fill me up.

Stopped in here for an afternoon snack and ordered Rustic Potatoes with Red and Yellow Curry Dips, Braised Beef and Mushroom Pies, and Ale Battered and Spicy Sausages with Guinness and Honey Mustard Dips. The Potatoes were good, but I found the curry dips to be on the bland side. I instead dipped them in the Guinness and Honey Mustard Dips that came with the Sausages. The best out of the three was the Braised Beef and Mushroom Pies. It was served with what I thought was salsa, but it was a tomato and chive dressing. This was a lot of food for three appy's and they were only $6 each! I can't wait to try some entrees next time around!",HA8021u0OmrhbZsiudB_7Q,1,1,3,5_N15T8ljPm9mdoEmH6TAg
5904037,2009-05-24,0,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"I was seated on the patio for dinner and the atmosphere was great (until someone started smoking).  Inside seemed very cozy and sticks to the very homey pub theme.  It was very reminiscent of European architecture.  Starting with a wonderful Heritage Tomato salad with 4, very fresh, cheeses.  The baby heritage tomatoes actually had more flavor but with the cheese covered up some of the mealy taste of one of part of one of the heritage tomatoes.  After pointing this out, they brought me some more fresh slices.

This was followed by an extra large portion of Red Snapper that was expertly braised on one side and topped with (almost too many) capers and a buttery accent sauce.  I ordered, by recommendation, the Mac & Cheese.  Short of what I love from my home town (Charleston, SC), the Mac and Cheese was expertly baked with a wonderfully crispy topping and smooth, creamy sauce.  All meals are accompanied by what I'm sure they claim to be fresh raisin bread but it came across as a bit stale.  What was nice was the Irish butter in a pesto sauce to spread over the bread.  If the bread was warm it would have been much better.

I came back later, after walking off some of dinner, to one of the best bread puddings that has ever hit my tongue.  It arrived piping hot in a large cone shaped mug with two sauces on the side (one was some sort of whiskey sauce).  They proceeded to overturn the mug to empty out the succulent and buttery bread pudding onto the plate.  It seems that they may have intended one to dip the bread putting in each sauce with a spoon but given some of the other great bread puddings, in my experience, I proceeded to drizzle the sauces over the bread and dug in.  This was definitely not portioned for a single person or serving.

I would have been happy to pay the same price for more of a personally sized portion of each of the main course and the desert but it was definitely one of the best meals and deals that I've had on the strip.  I wish I could have stayed for some of the table dancing and band playing.  I am excited to visit there again and try something new the next time I'm in Vegas (though I probably won't deviate far from the pudding!).",9pdLihjokoKyq8XGPQ8KFQ,0,0,5,VW4Anq-XpupHSBrHmtoyRw

Thanksgiving Lunch:

Having a good Thanksgiving Lunch was important to us, we're usually the ones hosting it at our house, this year the wife and I decided to escape to Vegas, but we like our holiday meals and it had to be a good one.

If you read another review, you'll know another place in the New York New York Hotel messed up our reservation, this became our back up plan - in reality I think we actually lucked out here.  Not only did we get straight in on Thanksgiving Day with NO reservation, we were immediately seated and assigned one of the most friendly and bubbly servers who was very engaging in conversation and an absolute pleasure.  On top of that we had GREAT food so thank you Nine Fine Irishmen for coming to the rescue.

Between us, we tried most items on the Thanksgiving menu!  They had both turkey based and ham based main dishes, so we got one of each and traded back and forth.  They were both amazing.  The chowder soup starter was literally to die for, and the bread pudding desert - well if I wasn't in utter ecstasy eating it and making sure I got ""my share"" before the wife did I may have written down all the adjectives I wanted in my phone as notes for my subsequent review.  I almost just said, heck, forget the Blackjack tables, send us 4 of those to our room!  Suffice to say it was all eaten.  We're not generally people who get through entire deserts especially in a big meal like this, but we were not going to be defeated this time, and defeated we weren't!

Breakfast:

On a later day during out trip we decided to go back here for breakfast, after the Thanksgiving experience we wanted to try more and find out if it was as good in more general terms.

Well my phone notes for breakfast start with ""OMG, most awesome breakfast ever, corned beef and sausage WOW"".  I think quite honestly I can use that without having to even add anything more or really edit.  It stands for itself and is exactly how I remember it!",jpLGApN7hQG2ZeTV0FKhjw,1,0,5,1wvGrD6fLWP-PnSHo85Fqw
5919369,2008-05-10,1,VR8QvH2g-jEG5EfMzA_G9w,"This place is run by cheap bastards. 

I have eaten here before. Nice atmosphere, but overpriced food. The fish and chips are okay, but nothing to write home about (we have better in SF). 

The reason why I am giving this restaurant 1 star and a bad review is because I booked a night at the NYNY casino-resort where the restaurant is located. Part of my package included several two for one coupons. I was on that leg of my trip by myself and assumed I could use the coupon for NFI as 50% off a single item. The restaurant refused to honor the coupon (from their own property) and treated me very rudely (and this was within minutes of checking in). I can't believe they would be so cheap that they wouldn't honor a coupon in this way (for $14 fish and chips) and acted like it was the weirdest or most awful thing in the world that I would request to use it as a single diner. She told me I would have to order one fish and chips and get a second order in order to use the coupon (thus wasting the food). Not only that, but the host and bartenders didn't seem to know what was going on and were rude. I will never set foot inside this place again or NYNY. These people are cheap and it shows bad judgment and management when people book a vacation at your establishment, are looking forward to going to this restaurant, and then treat their own patrons so badly. Jerks. I am not sure what their management is thinking, but I won't ever give them my business again.",0nFQgBQlel94VZpIfUAEMw,2,1,1,KwuDmyqa4qAqkAeI7fqgNA

Holy crap it was awful. I have no idea what is going on in the kitchen, but it tasted like frozen sausages that had been microwaved. All rubbery and totally without flavor. Yuck. The meal came out in under ten minutes, so that alone tells me they didn't prepare this meal properly. F you, charge me $19 for this slop.

Even the Guinness was awful. See the attached photo. This is not how a properly poured Guinness looks. And the wanker who poured it had a thick Irish accent. So either he just doesn't care, or wanted to mess with me. 

Two stars because it is fun here, cool live music, and a nice patio on the strip. But just be aware of what you are walking into.",zxmIKyEX89aY0QLC1JJksA,0,0,2,XRrnk4sml0JhOdzrCJJ7pg
