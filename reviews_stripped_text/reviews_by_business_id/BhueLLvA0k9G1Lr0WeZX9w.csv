I ordered the strawberry harvest salad and clam chowder.  I did not like the chicken on the salad it was pressed chicken, gag.  I didn't mind the soup, it wasn't chowder by any means, it was warm, not hot either.  There was a lot of potatoes and clams, it tasted good.  I would go back for the salad with no chicken.",IwqkEwNg2CPFXrEKNgsX7w,0,0,3,6VOS14ErO0FNlttHQfTgEA

Ordering is easy, everything is on a line and made as you walk down it. My favorite sandwiches are the pesto chicken, the cuban grilled pork, and the honey bacon club. All three are absolutely fantastic, but the other sandwiches I have tried there are all wonderful. I love the chipotle chicken salad and the chicken enchilada chili as well. The place can get really packed very quickly, but it normally moves pretty quickly. For having food healthier than that of other fast foods restaurants, I'm happy to go here when I need a lunch.

There's not a tone of lunch spots in the area (getting better now) so anything in the area from noon-1:00 will be packed. Plan accordingly.  Not sure what everyone's negative comments are for, it's a quick spot for a delicious bite to eat.  Lots of seats, yes, but we've never had trouble maneuvering, and my husband is in a wheelchair. My favorite soups are the chicken enchilada chili (despite what someone else has said, doesn't seem cheesy at all; it's thickened with masa) and the cauliflower soup (super rich).  I typically get the BBQ chicken salad, and my hubby gets sandwiches. Everything has been great. We eat here at least once a week and the only bad experience was they took longer than normal to make our salad and sandwich and by the time we paid for our food and sat down, our soup was barely lukewarm.

The soup was better than the sandwiches. The sandwiches, the cuban and turkey club, were just okay. Not a whole lot of flavor and I expect flavor from a cuban. The drink station was nice, plenty of different options but super crowded. It was busy and I felt rushed to make a selection. I didn't try the salads but they did look super appetizing and healthy. The price is right for what you get, definitely a good value.

Half the time I repeat it, no one even writes it down or does anything with it.. it's like they ask for fun. Also, my order is always somehow wrong. The wrong sandwhich.. missing a meal...

550727,2016-01-29,0,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"So my friend had told me about Cafe Zupas because of the Lobster Bisque soup. I checked it out at the Lake Mead location and the food options and pricing immediately made me think of Panera Bread. The soup was good but not better than my beloved Broccoli Cheddar soup in a Sourdough bread bowl at Panera. For that reason alone I was likely to choose Panera Bread if given the choice in the future.

However upon visiting this new location I think Zupas now has the edge. The food options are great. Just ordered a Try 2 combo and was able to get a whole Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich and a half salad of Glazed Chicken Chipotle. It came with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The strawberry is a wonderful little addon that Panera does not do. Also this Rainbow location has House Made Drink Infusions that are lightly sweetened with Raw Honey and a much healthier alternative to soda or sweet tea. I'm inspired to recreate these at home and drop soda out of my diet. 

This place gets bonus points for all the fresh produce, local dairy, and overall healthy ingredients. Menu is way easier to navigate than Panera as well. New favorite cafe and I will be spreading the word.",QYagsl80cr0MAmFEu9SfRw,0,0,5,SxdM-Zzbpe7YxJKeyc47jw

My BF and I went there for lunch on March 30th after deciding to meet up there on our lunch break. We both hadn't eaten anything all day as we both had a hectic morning. We were excited and hungry! I ordered a pesto chicken panini and a cucumber green tea from their fountain tea drink selection. My bf got an Italian sandwich and a clam chowder and a soda from the fountain drink. After eating my sandwich which I thought tasted good and drinking my drink which was disgusting, my BF ate his sandwich which he said was OK and soup which was disgusting and watery! We left full and a little disappointed. It was definitely not something we were planning on going back to...

After about 30 minutes my BF and I both began feeling sick!!! My BF is a physician and he knew we both got food poisoned! I did call the manager (she said her name was ""sharika"") the next day and she said she'd look into it...but this was enough to forever turn me off from any zupas for the rest of my life! I also warned all of my friends and family to never take their chances here...
My BF and I both had to return to work feeling like dying and I was soooo sick and nauseous the whole day and felt like death!!

Came here around noon with the fiance after a gym workout. This is a new location, and was packed. Similar to places like Q'doba and Chipotle, you start at one end and work your way down the assembly line. The first lady (with a glazed over look) ""greeted"" us with ""for here or to-go"". 
Us: for here. 
Her: would you like to try any salad or sandwiches today? 
Fiance: a soup and sandwich combo, please.
Her: would you like to try a salad or sandwich today?
Fiance: (extremely confused) a soup and sandwich please?
He proceeds to order a Cuban sandwich and clam chowder, to which she rudely says to order the soup at the end of the line.
She looks at me and repeats her slogan, ""would u like to try a salad or sandwich today"", to which i also say ""a combo"". She, again, repeats her question if i want to try a salad or sandwich. I repeat my order that i want a combo with a veggie sandwich, add sprouts and onion. Another gentleman behind the assembly line snaps his head around and says they can't add anything to sandwiches, only salads.. You're freaking kidding me, right? Strike 2. Also ordered vegetable and quinoa soup.

They were extremely unorganized behind the line, waaay too many employees that don't know what they're doing behind the line for the space they have. 

Ordered soup at the end of the line and the soup dude asks what sandwiches we had (they weren't finished being made yet) and looks around, lost. Dude next to him talks the fiance into a cheesecake. 2 lunch combos, 2 drinks, and a slice of cheesecake-$28. Strike 3.

Food- my vegetable quinoa soup was really good. Also, the cucumber basil green tea was great. That's where it ends. ""Vegetable"" sandwich was absolutely pathetic. ALL bread. (although fresh) One piece of Muenster cheese, 1 tomato, tiny specks of mixed greens, a few sweet peppers and a cilantro sauce that was decent. Fiance's chowder was straight up runny and he said it was very salty. He said his Cuban was decent. He said cheesecake was just ok. We both got a ""complimentary"" piece of bread, and a small, chocolate covered strawberry that was very mushy. 

No thanks. If I'm in the mood for that type of food, I'll stick to Panera. 2 stars only for the tea and the soup, and that's being generous.",u2kUEnt88S7iumV-3Vdmbg,2,1,2,zgnfAxuBybh_LgITkasQeg

1. Yes, the entrance is tricky but as adults, it's not that difficult to find the entrance to a line; so I'm not going to complain about that.

2. My biggest complaint - every time I've been in, it's extremely overstaffed which would automatically make you think quick, friendly service.. Completely wrong. This is the slowest assembly line of over 8 workers at a time that I have ever experienced, it's actually pathetic how slow they are when the lines aren't outrageous (chipotles lines are longer with less workers). I'm not an impatient person and don't mind waiting for my food but why have so many people getting paid to stand around? On top of that, while you're in line, prepared to be asked what you ordered over 5 times from different workers. I haven't experienced any rude staff. In fact, most are very friendly; so maybe that's what has made me return. I just find their assembly line to be extremely disorganized.

3. The salads here are delicious (especially the mango berry) and is another reason I have returned..but don't be prepared for anything fantastic when you're ordering the soups. I tried the tomato bisque to accompany the grilled cheese. The sandwich was really good, the tomato bisque was disgusting..it was so sweet (yes, sweet..so gross) none of the other soups look that appetizing either.

About three months ago, I found myself and the darling Orchid in that neighborhood to transact some business.  Since it took a while longer to transact than we originally figured, we found ourselves hungry after ""mission accomplished.""  Having not been in that neighborhood before, and having seen the sign, we thought, ""why not?""  We entered the building and ""saw the sights,"" as it were.

(DISCLAIMER: AS HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE PAST, ORCHID HAS SEVERAL FOOD ALLERGIES, WHICH DOES OCCASIONALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CHECK OUT A NEW PLACE.)

We were concerned about several issues relating to ingredients, expressed or implied, in certain of the offerings, and so, as we have so many times before, we asked about ingredients used.  Imagine our surprise, shock and dismay when we were told that they would not divulge the ingredients - even a specific request such as ""is there any soy in this?"" or ""do you use any hot peppers in this?""  When we asked why such a medically-reasonable request was being refused, we were told that they did not comply with such requests to keep their recipes from being stolen.  HUH?

After about ten minutes of discussion on whether or not an allergy qualifies as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as a few more simple requests for specific allergens in their preparations, we finally decided that their ""policy"" meant more to them than new clients.  We left, with no intention of ever returning.

One of the employees even told me that she was going to kill the other employee. Lol you can add extra ingredients in your soups for extra charge.

I typically get the Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. The sandwich is always packed full of ingredients, bread is soft and delicious and the soup is a little thicker and creamy, and tasty at the one on Sunset. Now let's talk about the new one on South Rainbow. For some reason the food is always less than Grand. My sandwich is puny with very little ingredients. Today I ordered my normal Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. Literally I think my sandwich had one piece of meat two tiny peices of sprouts and nothing else. The cauliflower soup literally was the consistency of water, hardly any flavor, just not good. How can items differ between the stores, if they serve the exact same items?

1380607,2016-06-04,0,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"I remember when the first one originally opened on Eastern by the 215, it was like an amazing thing. Healthy salads thats different from the usual salads and stuff. But the only downside was its location being 30 minutes, on a non-busy 215, to get to. Yeah i work near by sometimes but still not something i can get that easily. They had another location on lake mead that was more inconvenient than this location. I rarely on that side of town xD 

When i heard of this location opening up, it was like a god-send XD and had answered my prayers ! (no i didnt pray for this to happen but i did hope one would open on this side of town at some point in time) 

Big open location in a newly developed shopping center, across from the widely popular Arroyo Shopping Center on Rainbow and 215. Only downside is the traffic that is on Rainbow at almost all times of the day ! 

I had came here one day after volunteering to pick up for a few friends as we were meeting up at the office. They've never had Cafe Zupas before so it was a new experience for them. Since nowadays, everyones on the healthy route, it was the perfect pick ! And they loved it !

Their popular try 2 combo is amazing. It includes picking 2 of the following (whole sandwich, half soup, half salad), bread and chocolate dipped strawberry. All for $8.79 

My usual go-to is the Strawberry Harvest Salad (fresh strawberries blanded into a house-made strawberry champagne vinaigrette tossed in house-chopped lettuce, chicken and sliced strawberries, gala apples, cranberries, fontina cheese, and candied pecans) and a sandwich (turkey bacon avocado usually)

This salad is my favorite. It was AMAZING to get this considering i was getting sick of the usual salads from like Sweet Tomatoes. Sweet and savory. Fresh and bright. Soft and crunchy. Holy crap. Lol XD i have gotten this salad ALMOST every time i've went to Cafe Zupas, except now ill probably attempt to try the entire menu again, it being in a more convenient location. Lol xD

Turkey bacon avocado sandwich. How can you say no to avocado? Usually my go-to sandwich as well. Panini style with a crispy outside. 

---------------------------

I had came here again and totally got something different this time around (as i had mentioned earlier, tryin my attempt to try the menu... XD) 

California protein cobb salad with baby field greens, fresh herb vinaigrette, chicken, eggs, bacon, edamame, grape tomatoes, olives, goat cheese, and avocado. the vinaigrette is yummy. i even dipped my bread into it to get more. The salad itself seemed a little smaller than usual. Edamame gives it a nice variety of textures. Goat cheese, was not strong at all, or maybe im one of those who is ok with eating goat cheese. Lol Avocado was scooped by a baller like it was guacamole. Small amount. Wish i get more xD 

Pesto chicken sandwich with home-made pesto chicken, almonds, roasted sweet red peppers, muenster cheese, sprouts and tomatoes. pesto was nice and light. You'd think this sounds like a semi-heavy sandwich but not so bad. Pretty tasty. creamy pesto and muenster cheese sounds like a good combo. tomatoes gives it a nice brightness to it all. 

------------------------------

I still have yet to try the soups but friend said the chowder wasnt bad nor is the lobster bisque. they did mention it was a bit weird that the chowder had chopped celery in it. Maybe ill try a soup next time :3 :D

What I love about this place is that it's not greasy fast food. It's fast, sure, but the quality of the food is so much better to me than anywhere else. Actually, that's not even the only thing I love about this place, I just love this place.

Every time I come in I order what is to me one fantastic lunch: the Italian club sandwich and a half size of the mangoberry salad. The sandwich is great, don't get me wrong, the lettuce is nice and crunchy and the bread is just soft enough and the meat is good, but what REALLY draws me to this place, what really keeps me coming back for more, is that heavenly mangoberry salad (with extra cinnamon almonds). I'm a fruit salad type of girl so this just hits the spot for me. They use a spring mix in the salad so the sweetness of the fruit and dressing is balanced by the occasional spiciness of the radicchio. I would recommend this salad to everyone I know, I just love it!

As for the place itself, it's roomy, it's clean, and I've yet to have a bad experience here. The service is so friendly, which is great, but honestly I'm just there for the food.

Every time I've come, the food and service has been spot on, accommodating to the occasional specific request (I ask for my strawberry not dipped in chocolate), consistency in taste and freshness of the food served is a huge reason I'm a fan and speak so highly of this place, as well the reason I give it 5/5 stars 

Location is easily visible from the main road Rainbow Blvd in a brand new plaza. It has lots of seating as well as outdoor seating available. Very well lit as the entrance and one side wall is floor to ceiling windows. 

Lunch time gets rather busy especially at the peak of the lunch rush between 11:45am-1pm. The ordering system is very much like an assembly line system so at each part of the line a different person is assisting you. I will admit during their busiest times this may (or may not) get confusing but just keep moving forward and the rest will follow in place (puns totally intended lol) 

I always get the try 2 combo which give you the option of salad, soup, sandwich obviously pick any of the two. I do the soup and salad. What I like is that unlike other establishments that do a salad sandwich or soup combo option, you get a full panini sandwich verses the half of one. I normally get the mango berry salad that is completely vegetarian (no meat) and it comes with an amazingly sweet but not too sweet or thick mango yogurt dressing that I always get on the side (calories control). I've also tried their Asian citrus salad that perfectly pairs with a citrus peanut type ginger vinaigrette dressing. Although I've sampled all the soups, I always still end up ordering the roasted pepper lobster bisque. They do have original lobster bisque but I like that added kick in flavor. Another soup I recommend is the wild mushroom. Seriously, their options on the menu are pretty endless so I'll definitely be in to start trying other things on the menu. Sandwiches that I've tasted from family while dining has all been really good as well! Maybe one day I'll check a bit and order myself one of the sandwiches. 

Drinks are separate at $1.99 but at the drink station they have in house brews that are all naturally sweetened with raw honey only so I love the pomegranate lemon coconut water. I always grab an extra lemon slice to squeeze into my drink as well. They also provide flavored syrup sweeteners as well. The in house drinks are definitely worth trying and I highly recommend it. They have 4 different flavors. 

Every order comes with a roll of bread (wish it was warm bread) & a strawberry dipped in chocolate but I get mine without chocolate. This place also offers desserts which I've had the cheesecake before, but I come for the healthy eats do I tend to stray away from desserts, 

The combo is $8.99 & I walk away full every time. My salad is always tasting fresh. I do wish the soup was a little of the thicker side and less thin like it's been watered down but that's not enough for me to knock this place off a star. 

The area is great, place stays clean, service is great as they have people that come around and ask to take your plates when done, & it's been a consistently pleasant experience for me every time I've come. I really do love coming and eating here and I most definitely will keep coming back for more!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,10,8,5,WV8hS7sgoLECxP7ha52oCw

1851094,2016-05-08,3,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"I like the idea zupas has here order a combo with a soup or salad or sandwich. It's pretty cheap too but if you're eating with one other person it's about $20 which about the same as sweet tomatoes for 2 people so I'd say the better deal would be to go to sweet tomatoes but I mean if you want fast but healthy food id definitely come here though!
My favorite soups from here would have to be tomato basil or veggie quinoa and the best salad would have to be chicken chipotle or the healthiest is the kale salad. Best fruit one is the nuts about berries 

They also have really good house made drinks like the cucumber/basil infused water is my favorite.
I also love how they give you a strawberry and bread with every order. 
The service is very fast and they have a lot of good workers working for them. 
The interior is decorated nicely too.
The only problems I have is that the portions are so little. Like when they scoop you your soup they do one scoop and it fills only half the bowl. 
One time I was ordering and the worker gave me a little too much soup and the manager told them to take some out because it was too much? 
Other than that though everything else is fine. Sometimes it's too cold in here too, but other than that I'd still come back and bring my friends if we want quick healthy food",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,7,4,3,4T5Vy0DuyzHnRfGqrs1Ovw

Sadly I was more disappointed then impressed.  :(

I got their combo... Full sandwich with either a half salad or half soup.

I got the turkey with bacon and avocado.  The sandwich was decent. It didn't blow me away. I figured that the bacon would still be a little crispy.... Sadly no it was limp.... And it looked like it had been sitting in their reach ins for sometime.  And the turkey was just your normal sliced turkey u can get at a grocery store. Now the real disappointment.... The avocados. I love avocados and that was one of the main reasons why I got this and instead of being fresh avocado slides.... It looked like they had just smeared guacamole on it. Very sad about that. :( but the flavor was overall decent.  (3/5)

The soup was another disappointment. I call it a soup even though they call it a chowder because it was NOT a chowder. When I get a chowder I expect that it's going to be thick and chunky.  It was brothy like a chicken noodle soup. And it was SALTY. very very SALTY. The soup comes with a piece of bread.... They call it a baguette... But it was just a loaf of bread in the shape of a baguette. :/  even with adding the bread into the soup it was SALTY.... But I was hungry so I ate it.... I got the new England clam soup.... The flavor besides the saltiness was barely ok.  There was no potatoes... Just lots and lots of celery. And the pieces of clam were miniscule.  This was a total miss. (1/5)

Best thing about this visit was the drink station. They have 4 upgraded drinks included when u buy a normal soda fountain drink. They are all natural made with honey instead with normal sugar or sugar substitutes.  I tried 2 and both were well balanced and not overly sweet.  If you do not like honey I would not recommend these drinks as the honey is very obvious. (5/5)

Free chocolate dipped strawberries.... (5/5)... You can't really complain about free....

Ambiance.... It was very clean and the staff were awesome. Very friendly.  But I will knock a star off since it was COLD in there. This is coming from someone who has her thermostat at home set to 68.... It was COLD.  (4/5)

Overall I would like to give them 1 more try.... And see if the food quality improves.  But I won't be rushing back here. :(",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,3,2,3,pxmuXc8Bv39VFvwqmGM5jg

I've been wanting to try a salad but it seems that most salads follow the formula of sugary dressing + fresh fruit + candied nuts/dried fruit and I am not down with sweet salads.

Today I ordered the fresh herb chicken sandwich. I am sensitive to mayo (it's gross, lets be real) and I asked the employee behind if the chicken was covered in mayo and he said no after I asked twice using different words and... it was covered in mayo. I hate to complain so I ate it anyways and it was pretty OK. The fresh avocado, bacon and soft bread made up for the unsavory ingredient, though I won't make that mistake twice.

The soups have been, by far, my favorite part of coming to Cafe Zupas. They allow you to have a sample of the soups when choosing which almost makes it *harder* to decide. Today I went with the mushroom bisque and it was so fresh and delicious. It seems like most mushroom recipes come with truffle oil these days which, if not done right, tastes like rubber, but this soup was obviously super fresh. It didn't taste weighed down with heavy creams and butters too, it was simply perfect.

Lastly, there is no calorie count for any of their items. I've lost 40 lbs over the past year, my BF has lost 65 and we aren't obsessive, but we are mindful and their lack of nutritional info irks me. I'm not scared off of higher calorie meals and indulge weekly, but it would be good to know if my ""healthy lunch"" was really a caloric splurge. Maybe soon?

The staff all behave like it's their 1st day on the job. No one seems to know what they're doing, and they all seem very uncertain about everything happening.

The food itself seems...off. The portions of fruit in the salad I got (nuts about berries) seems much lower than normal. The lobster bisque was insanely watery and contained absolutely no meat (not the case at other locations).

Today I had a turkey artichoke panini with red pepper and lobster bisque. 

The soup was fantastic I expected it to just be lobster flavored, but there's a noticeable amount of lobster in there. It came with a chunk of baguette (which I wish was a little crustier). 

The sandwich was good, but it was made for gringos- thankfully they have a selection of hot sauces (I settled on chipotle Tabasco). It was also a little too mayonnaisey for my taste (I don't like hot mayonnaise), but somebody else might like it. It was still good mind you, just not great. 

I didn't have an issue with the portion size (perhaps it has been corrected). I'm kinda muscley, so I'm typically a big eater, and I was satisfied (as my second lunch)

The staff is super nice, if they're still this happy in a few months, they're service and culture manager will be pilfered by Disney. Seriously, the service standard is fantastic.

2200059,2015-12-27,0,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"I'm not sure why this location has gotten such bad ratings so far. Yes they are newly opened, and the staff are new, but when we went, service was very fast, everyone knew what they were doing, and the food was good!

It was very busy when we went and the line moves fast. The main thing that bothered me about this place is that it's cramped. Most people will walk in the front door but the tables are really jam packed in there, so it's hard to get to the back to get in line. There is also a side door that would be a more logical entrance but I think most don't know it's there.

Also after ordering, most people will turn to the right to walk away, which puts you behind the drink station. You then have to walk back around it, which in many cases you will be walking across the people walking in, which again will be trying to walk past people getting their drinks. I think they should put a big sign on the front door to use the side door as the entrance, and use the front door as the exit. If this place continues to be this busy, I think it would control the flow of traffic much better. Or they could turn the drink station around, which I think would be a great idea, but probably out of the question.

As far as the food, prices are very good if you don't go overboard with the add ons, which are $0.69 each. But sandwiches are less than $6 each, and are small, but the size is equal to its price IMO. We tried the Cubano, Turkey spinach artichoke (TSA), Turkey bacon avocado (TBA), and Chicken salad. The best is the Cubano. It has the most amount of meat and the pork is really tender. It's the same pork as what's used in the Pulled Pork and Cilantro Pork, though I have yet to try those. The runner up was the TSA, refreshing yet satisfying.

Every order comes with a small chocolate dipped strawberry. If that's not enough for you for dessert, they do have several house made desserts that are VERY sweet!

Soups are also very tasty. We tried the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. I like the lobster bisque better. It has a bit of a spicy kick to it. The clam chowder had big chunks of clam but was a little on the salty side.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,5,3,4,m_OC6gzfaABxkCp8V5bFZw

At the end all your food is on the tray and you are met with these delicous looking home made brulees. OMG! Its hard to resist.

We tried the California chicken sandwich, lobster bisque , turkey avocado sandwhich and Maui tropical salad. 

Loved the salad...so refreshing and delicious. 5 

The lobster bisque was a little of a disappointment. I was expecting a creamy, lobster pieced filled soup like I have had at other restaurants. This one was more like mass produced, a bit watery based, no lobster soup. I get it that they probably go through gallons of this soup and they can't have people chopping up fresh lobster in the back so maybe u expectations were a little too high.

I got the spinach artichoke sandwich and a chicken tortilla soup and my husband got the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup with orzo. They are perfectly sized and you actually get a full sandwich with your meal. 

If you want something light, this is a good alternative to other soup and sandwich places. They have drinks infused with different teas, berries and raw honey too.

I do love the atmosphere and I do love the location, but the food was just okay. I felt as though this place didn't live up to the hype that others have created for it. Maybe it's because I am not a health nut and that is why I didn't favor it. The food didn't make me sick so they get one star for that, the service was great, so that's another star, and a third star because the food is supposed to be healthy for you and is made with fresh ingredients. 

I ordered:
Honey bacon club with New England clam chowder  = The sandwich was 'meh' and the chowder was too watery

Husband ordered: 
BBQ pulled pork with chicken enchilada chili soup = The sandwich had a nice tang to it, but isn't a 'must-try' by any means; soup was decently good, hate that add-ons are $0.69 each for just a sprinkle of shredded cheese

It's the fourth time I see this happening so Enough is enough.
Salads and desserts are great but portion are ridiculous.
I always pay attention how they prepare your food. Every time I go at cafe zip as on rainbow I noticed portion served is less and less but price hasn't changed beside zupas charging you for drinks or extra ""salad topping"" I did not even order.

Last experience was Friday 08/04/17
Ordered a ""make your own salad"", it took the guy who picked my green about 2 minutes before he was able to figure out the amount of green he will give me. Then he removes 4 leaves out of my plate when the portion was already small.
Then on my 5 toppings, the woman did the same thing. Shake out as much as possible the mini spoon so nothing was left RIDICULOUSLY GREEDY

I do not mind paying extra, I never complain about it
But las Friday was like ""really?

With every new restaurant opening, there are sure to be some growing pains (as other reviewers have pointed out), but I think this location still has the same great service, affordable/high quality food options, and friendly atmosphere of other locations I've been to. I get what I always get at other locations - mushroom bisque and nuts about berries salad, and my husband picks up the delicious honey cilantro carnitas with whatever soup looks good that day. My husband picked up some food for me to go the other day and he said the place was packed and even sent me a picture of the line, so be aware if going during lunch hours.

2911474,2016-01-06,1,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"I had always wanted to check out Cafe Zupas. When I lived on the other side of town, just off of Eastern, I would end up going to either Pin Kaow, BJ's Brewhouse, Beach Hut Subs, Griddlecakes, Smashburger, or Taco Y Taco. It just had the bad luck of being in the same area as ALL of these other dining establishments.

So when I saw that they opened one just up the street from the new house, I knew I was definitely going to check it out! Sure enough, just the other day I experienced Cafe Zupas for the first time and here is what I took away from it...

Pros-
-Fair prices for what you get. For $8.79, you get a choice of 2 out of these 3:Sandwhich, Soup, or Salad.
-Employees were very nice and friendly. They explained the whole process and answered the questions we had.
-Sandwiches are not huge, but combined with the soup, was quite filling. My Italian Club was very tasty, but that Chili Enchilada soup was incredible! I want a large serving of that next time!
-The restaurant is new so it was, of course, very shiny and clean.
-Chocolate covered strawberry with each meal is a nice little touch....and yummy...I loooove strawberries!

Cons-
-It was 45 degrees out and raining when we dined here and they were blasting the A/C. Ummmm, I am freaking shivering, can you please kill the A/C while I eat?? I am sure that will be awesome in July, but in the first week of January? I think not.
-As others have stated, when you first walk through the door, you walk through a bunch of crammed little 2 and 4 seaters to get to the line. Must be awkward as hell on busy days. They definitely need to fix that.

Other tidbits-
-Fountain machine serves Coke products, including Coke Zero!(Yay!)
-Nice little outdoor seating area out front, with a few table settings under umbrellas facing Rainbow Blvd.

I was very happy with my first visit to Cafe Zupas and definitely see many return visits in the future!

As a family of four, this is the most annoying process.  Can'y you write it down, or have an electronic order system so you don't need to ask me four times?  Also, prepare to have at least on of your items be wrong and you need to ask to have it remade.

I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.
   The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.  
We got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.  
    Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.  I would assume this is due to recently opening and doing OJT with new employees.  I ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures.

Friendly staff.

The food is very average but for a soup + a grilled cheese sandwich + a chocolate strawberry + an unlimited refill drink for 3.99, what can you expect ?
The soup I choose was tomato and he had some little pasta inside, my friend had the mushroom one and liked it too. 
The grilled cheese sandwich has nothing special and the cheese they use hardly taste like cheese, American cheddar I presume (looks like it).
Chocolate strawberry to end on a sweet taste. One bite strawberry as it's very small and not very tasty.

This is the place you go to when you're in a hurry and you want an healthier option than a burger or a fried chicken place.

I had the Pick 2 deal for $8.79 which I chose the Honey Bacon Club Panini and 1/2 of the Citrus Spinach Salad.  It was great!   The salad was especially amazing!   It had a Blood Orange Vinaigrette, which was one of the best salad dressings I've ever had.  It included Mandarin Oranges, Baby Spinach, Dried Cranberries, and Goat Cheese.  The sandwich had Turkey, Ham, Bacon and Muenster Cheese with Honey Mustard.  Both were very good.  The service was VERY FAST and they had plenty of help.  The place was very clean.  The ingredients were very fresh as well.  The downside of it is that the place isn't well lit at night.  I've driven by it many times thinking they were closed.  However, they stay open until 9pm, except on Friday & Saturday when they're open until 10pm.  They need some outside lights.  One thing VERY DISCOURAGING is that they are closed on Sundays.  Lucky for their employees I guess, but I don't get how chain businesses do this?!    Other than that, it was great and will be a very frequent dinner spot.

Downgraded this tonight from four stars to three stars.  The food is incredible, but we tried to call in an order for six people tonight at work.  Their policy is no call-in orders, unless you place an advance order before 10am on the day you want the order.  I can understand if you have 15-20 people or more, but what kind of casual restaurant can't prepare a call-in order for six people in 30-45 minutes?!   That is beyond ridiculous.  Your kind of business should thrive on phone in orders.  If you don't have the personnel to handle it, then hire more people for that process.  Also, why is it that you can only order on-line in Utah?!  They have A LOT of work to do in this area.",gmYU_SLgpWgafgSejWdzTg,0,0,3,_mBj0pDP_nWVYkxGyhR0_A

I had the combo which includes sandwich, soup, and salad for $8.79
I added the pomegranate coconut water green tea .
There are 13 sandwiches to choose from , 12 salads and 10 soups . You can also add deserts if you choose and they also look delish. 
Expect a large lunch time crowd here .
Here are the few drawbacks I encountered during my visit . At the time of this writing (April 2016) the cafe is newly opened. There seemed to be some minor confusion between the employees trying to match sandwiches to salads and soups for different orders. With time , this problem will fix itself .
The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries. Even more akward is they use this same customer entry door to wheel out the trash bins (yuck).

I have enjoyed the lobster bisque, roasted red pepper and lobster, chicken enchilada chili and wild mushroom bisque.  Anything they suggest to go on the soups is .69 per add on just so you know.  All of the soups were phenomenal but the red pepper lobster is my fave so far.

Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad
Garden Chop Salad with Blue Cheese
Cherry Balsamic Chicken Salad

Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta Soup
Wild Mushroom Bisque Soup
Chicken Enchilada Chili 
Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster
Hungarian Beef Stew (World Tour Special)
Honey Cilantro Carnitas 
Ultimate Grilled Cheese
Cuban Grilled Pork

I read some previous reviews mentioning salads being too wet or too sweet, but in my opinion that's your poor review of the menu. I found the Glazed Chicken Chipotle salad to be too wet but I take responsibility for not asking for lite dressing knowing they include two dressings in the salad. I don't think that means Zuppas makes a terrible salad. If you don't like a sweet salad or salad dressing don't order a menu salad, you have the option to ""create your own"" 

While I do agree the layout was poorly conceived and it's annoying snaking through tables full of people during lunch rush, the amount of fresh food for the price made me get over it fast.

The soup was heavy with lobster in my opinion it was a little too much it took away from the red pepper taste, but still DELICIOUS! The sandwhich was to die for i loved everything about it, the second combine 2 dish i tried was the New England Clam Chowder with the Honey Bacon Club sandwhich, the clam chowder was eh, nothing to special but very good.. The sandwhich was amazing as well but after awhile the taste of honey mustard became a little too much, to me it tasted like a corn dog. The place was clean and the atmosphere was very nice, not to mention the infused drinks they had were amazing! My favorite had to be the Raw Honey Lemonade.. super good everything seemed healthy definitely worth the 4 stars. Oh and the chocolate strawberries are what made this place worth coming for!

Though I did like the food, I thought the service here was just odd. They have an assembly line where each staff seems to have a set station but it's extremely unorganized and inefficient. I also think the ordering system here is plain confusing. I don't know if it's just me but I had a hard time figuring out how to order or what to get. Also didn't help because I'm at one station ordering a sandwich and a staff at a soup station is already asking me what soup I'm ordering. ""Would you like some soup today?""...""Sorry I'm still deciding."" 

Then 20 seconds later, ""Would you like some soup today?"" ""WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY?"" ....Holy moly, how many times are you going to ask me? Calm down soup server. I'm not ready yet.  I guess it is my fault for not knowing what I want on my first visit? Then come to the register and we are met with a rude cashier. Ugh.

On the bright side, our food was fantastic. We got kale and quinoa salad, cuban grilled pork panini sandwich, wild mushroom bisque and asian citrus chicken salad. Salads were drenched in dressing so I did not like it too much. However, I did enjoy the sandwich and mushroom soup. 

Cuban grilled pork had a smoky taste to it. Panini was thin and sandwich was a small portion but I loved the flavor. Small bite and I was instantly in love. One bite kept me wanting another. Mushroom soup was rich and creamy, wish it had more mushroom in it instead of few small pieces. I got to try a sample of tomato basil soup and that was one of the best soup I had. Wish they sell it by gallon. 

Unpleasant service but enjoyed the food. I would come back in a heartbeat especially now that I know what I like from here.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,5,4,0ZGBSWtx9lcqrBRdk47riA
4026828,2016-03-24,0,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"I lived in NYC for a couple of years and healthy soup, salad, and sandwich places are available everywhere for lunch. I always complain how there aren't those quick salad places here in Vegas so I was seriously excited to see this place open up not too far from my office. Additionally, my younger brother had recommended it to me. He had tried the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and claims they make better carnitas than a Mexican restaurant.

While I'll give this place another chance, I am initially not a fan. I looked at the menu online and was wowed by their salad selection and the affordable prices! I try to eat really healthy during the week and I know that salads aren't always as healthy as they seem so I searched for their nutrition information, which was nowhere on their website. I headed there anyway on 3/21/16 and decided to ask the staff.

When I got there, it was mayhem. It was super busy with a large lunch crowd. I approached the line and a friendly staff member asked me if I had ever been there before. When I said no, he explained the menu to me. I asked him for the nutrition and allergen information and he told me they would have it at the front of the line, after I order. I asked, ""after I order?"" to which he said, ""let me go get it for you."" He came back and said that he was unfortunately mistaken and that they do not have this information. What?! Okaaay..... so I ordered the Asian Citrus Chicken salad, as Asian style salads are usually a healthy option anywhere. The half size was $5.59 and the full size was $7.59 and I opted for the full size, very happy with the fact that I would be having lunch for under $8.

They rush you through the line. When I ordered my salad, I was told okay, it will be at the front of the line for you. I figured they would let you customize as they build your salad? I told the guy please leave off the wonton strips before I headed to the front of the line. I don't know the size difference between the half and the full size but wow the full size portion is small. If your salad is to go, they put it in a compartmentalized plastic container and just fill 3 of the compartments, leaving the 4th and largest compartment empty. It was not enough food for me for lunch and I was very disappointed. As for flavor, it was okay. The mandarin oranges were mushy but the dressing was flavorful. The chicken was plain chicken. I was missing the sesame seeds, cucumbers, and cashews from my salad which I didn't notice until I was already back at my office. So that sucked. They give you bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I would rather have had more salad.

I'll give it another try someday as I would really love a quick salad place nearby work for lunch. But as of right now, meh. I'm hoping I just had one of those one-off bad experiences.",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,4,0,2,bGRKZ68EXUmQUq3c-L3AOw

4085532,2017-03-09,2,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"Imagine a Panera bread but with a focus on Southwestern style foods. That's Cafe Zupas in the nutshell.

This place was busy. Probably still busy as of right now. It can be a little intimidating ordering, but they have menus in line and they have a huge board of what's available. They also have deals where you can get a sandwich and a 1/2 or soup or salad at a combo price. You may also want to designate a seat saver, if you are traveling in a group as seating can be hard to find at times.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup. The Cuban sandwich is my downfall. I have a tendency to order those in places where I feel they won't get it totally right. You want that nice hard pressed bread, cuts of warm ham with mustard and pickles. Well, technically, it had the correct parts but I wasn't a fan of their little twists. There was pressed bread, but it was some special bread they used. Multi-grain bread is fun and all, but not the same taste. They weren't skimpy with the ham, plenty of that to taste. The pickles were bread and butter chips. Again, technically they are both pickles, but normal dill pickles are a little tart and crisp. Bread and butter chips are soggier and much much sweeter than normal pickles. Throw on some of that citrus honey mustard and sweet red peppers and you are swimming in sweetness.

The chicken enchilada chili was pretty good but look at the name, of course it's going to be good. It's cheese city. You can get cheddar on there too (for what I assumed was a fee, everything happened so fast!) You can never have too much cheese though. You also get a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I don't know the significance of the chocolate dipped strawberry but it was tasty dessert snack.

Again, this reminds me of a Panera bread with the emphasis on Southwest style foods. I do think their strengths are soups and salads more than sandwiches.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,3,2,3,DFL-LGzKc7H4cQHIeXaAjA
4099178,2017-04-28,3,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"Does anyone else get anxiety as soon as they walk in the door? There are WAYYY too many tables in this place. Whoever is in charge of design needs a lesson in feng shui.  There is no clear path to the area where you get in line so you're always trying to shuffle between people eating and the tables are very close together.  There is only about 6 feet in front of you when you walk in the door before you hit a table with people eating. This is the first thing I notice every time I walk in.  

It's pretty obvious that Café Zupas trains their employees to do things in a VERY specific way. God forbid you make them stray from that training plan. They're usually very young, very robotic and don't know how to maneuver when there is a one off request. For example today I asked for a cookie with my soup and the girl looked at me like I was absolutely crazy. She said sorry you would've had to place a catering order for that, we don't do cookies with soup. I said 'do you sell cookies?' She said yes.

With so many sandwiches, salads and soup to choose from, this place is Soup Plantation on steroids. Everything sounds tasty like a gourmet item, so making a selection was difficult. Luckily, they allow you to sample the soups. Since it was late on a weekday, there werent many people in line. The staff was extremely patient as I sampled 6 different soups. When dining out I try to order things that aren't routine, leaning towards meals that are new for my pallet or things that I would not ordinarily cook. I was torn between a brothy soup or a chowder. The gal behind the counter recommended the cauliflower soup and once the cheesiness hit my taste buds I was sold! I paired that with the kale and quinoa salad. For $8.99, I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with bread and one large chocolate covered strawberry. The salad was hearty, with a good mix of fixins with just enough kale to goodies ratio. My sister ordered the crab avocado sandwich, which I had to sample. It was a delicious, on a warm panini bread and I'd order that next time.

4702226,2016-01-15,2,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"This was my second visit to a Cafe Zupas location and it was prompted by their Grand Opening mailer for 50% off your order. I brought Ruben, my mom, and my brother to take advantage of this fantastic deal, plus, they had never been to Zupas.

There's still construction going on in this new plaza and it was insanely busy, so it was a little tricky maneuvering around the lot. Parking was also sparse, which made it even more chaotic. I'm sure they'll be rather busy as long as these mailers are running!

The lowdown on CZ: 

ORDERING: Go straight to the line. The menu is available above the food stations, but also available as convenient to-go menus along the line. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts. That's the simple part. Making a decision may take a little more time since there are 13 sandwiches, 12 salads, and 10 soups. Sandwiches are sold whole, but soups and salads are available as large or half options. There's a very popular ""Try 2 Combo"" for $8.79 that offers a sandwich with a half salad OR half soup (it's also the best deal). When it's your turn at the counter, they'll ask you if you're having a sandwich or a salad. Then you're moved down the line and asked if you want soup. Everything is prepped as you're walking. As your meal is being wrapped up with a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry, they verify your items before you pay at the register (This is also when you choose your beverage options).

BEVERAGES: There's a beverage station with your usual fountain sodas and freshly-made teas and lemonades (all sweetened with honey). This area is also home to utensils, napkins, butter, etc. (There are salt and black pepper grinders at the tables)

SEATING: ""Please place your order before reserving a seat"" It's a quick-service restaurant and turnover is equally fast (we were at our table for just 25 minutes). It was really busy when we arrived, but we were still able to find a table for four immediately after receiving our food, so I wouldn't worry about not having a seat/table. Though, I'm sure it could get busier and I don't know what they do in that situation.

The verdict:

Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini: Turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. First, the sandwich was a MESS. There was avocado everywhere (especially outside the sandwich). Also, I'm certain it was an avocado spread rather than actual avocado. The bread was not crunchy or warm like you'd except from a panini (especially when it's pressed to order, unless this was prepared in advance). There was also very little or no salt; surprising when there's bacon present (speaking of bacon, it was flabby and sad). I'm assuming they purposely don't salt their foods and allow you to season it yourself? Basically, the sandwich lacked much-needed texture and seasoning. Even with the addition of salt and pepper, it was still just okay.

Honey Bacon Club Panini: Turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. Again, the bread lacked crunch. Its flavor was decent and I like that the honey really stood out without being overwhelming or too sweet. It also didn't need additional salt. I didn't love this sandwich either, but I enjoyed it much more than the other panini.

Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster Soup: This is a neat combination of two ingredients I love and lighter than its described (creamy). It had a nice lobster fragrance that you could really taste and there were several pieces of lobster (though they had an odd texture). However, it was just okay. 

Chicken Enchilada Chili: Red & green enchilada sauces, chicken, black beans, and Southwestern vegetables, topped with tortilla strips. A bit thin for a chili since it was more soup than stew, but the flavors were good. I would order this one again.

Asian Citrus Chicken: Baby field greens, housemade yuzu miso vinaigrette, chicken, sugar snap peas, edamame, baby cucumbers, tri-color peppers, mandarin oranges, cashews, wonton strips, and black sesame seeds. I was pleased that the salad wasn't overly dressed with vinaigrette (I hate drowning salads) and thought it was decent. The mandarin oranges were super mushy, but I'm not a fan of them in salads anyway.

The sandwiches are small, but the soups and salads are generous. The accompanying bread is pretty good, though it would be soo much better toasted (and butter; I forgot about butter)! I didn't eat the chocolate-covered strawberry this time, but I remember it being good (Belgian milk chocolate).

I'm not overly impressed with the food. It's wonderful that everything is housemade, but the quick-serve model is compromising the end-product (soft paninis, soggy ingredients). It is a great option for healthier food when you're on the go and I know that's their thing, but I prefer a made-to-order product that may take a little more time.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,2,3,TXMcnDvvT8jzDOGuBR3JYg

I've visited Cafe Zupas a number of times. I think the service is always on point and the food I have tried is very tasty. The location is always clean no matter how busy they are. 

For me, the downside is definitely the small portions. I have observed the careful attention to detail that goes into making a meal. You will notice that the small portions are consistent. Each item that is added to the salad is carefully measured and portioned.

I have a SEVERE ALLERGY to quinoa and before placing my order I let the employees know and asked for items with NO quinoa OR cross contamination. They said they would make sure that my food didn't touch any quinoa. I ordered a sandwich on whole wheat bread. After two bites I started to feel my face itch and swell, so I asked 2 employees at the register if the bread had quinoa it it, they both confidently stated no so I sat back down thinking the itching was just in my head. A few minutes later one of the employees came back saying there IS quinoa in the bread! The GM expressed ZERO concern, then proceeded to argue that she didn't know what we expected her to do about it and that next time I should make sure I tell a manager about my allergy before ordering food. Next time a customer tells any of your employees that they have an allergy, I hope you take it much more seriously. You are lucky my allergy is not fatal or even more severe than it is. They should be knowledgeable about what they are making. If they don't know, THEY should ask the manager rather than reassuring the customer that they will be taken care of WITHOUT knowing. The GM kept arguing with us, so my friend took care of the rest as I ran out to get Benadryl. The manager refunded my food, but the $10 didn't even matter to me. It was the way the manager handled the situation as I have to deal with my allergic reaction. Don't ever argue with your customers especially when you have caused harm to their wellbeing! If they apologized and made sure I was ok and that they would make sure it didn't happen again, and tried to make things right without arguing I would have understood that mistakes happen and hope they would learn from it. I definitely would have come back if this was handled appropriately, but because of the poor customer service, insensitivity, and arguing I will NEVER come to this location again and will make sure I tell everyone I know not to as well!",yN5TNQbdX0Q7y1H4uHsGnQ,0,0,1,TF5eFQEt90leRT8VJk_cIw

Normally I eat something before I eat at Zupas because the salads are a bit on the small side and I don't like to leave hungry.  I didn't have time so I just went and ordered the normal salad that I get.   
I asked the ""shift leader"" if I could have a little extra lettuce with my salad.  Not any of the items that they put on it, just lettuce so that it would be a little more filling.
The shift leader said to me, ""No we can't do that because we have no way to charge you for it.""  WHAT?
I even said back to her that I wasn't asking for extra Protien or fruit or anything that actually would increase the cost of it, simply a little more lettuce.  
To which she replied, ""sorry, there's just no way to do it.""

The employee's are really nice and efficient. Although there is a lot of them on the line, every employee from my experience has never failed to smile and make me feel welcomed. There are a lot of issues on repeating orders down the line but I am more patient and understanding when I have to repeat my order a couple of times, no biggie. 

Their food is very fresh and you could tell by the quality of it that most of their ingredients isn't pre-packaged. Their salad and soup portions could work on being bigger but the quality of the food is amazing. They also have chocolate dipped strawberries that comes with your purchase.

I'd never even heard of it before and I miss the soup/salad/sandwich place I frequented in Florida. Bonus incentive to try it was the 50% off the ENTIRE MEAL coupon I received in the mail. We finally went to try it out tonight. My daughters and I are vegetarians and my son is not. I very much appreciated the number of vegetarian items on the menu. We ordered three Ultimate Grilled Cheese, one Cuban, two cauliflower soups, one mushroom soup and one chicken tortilla soup. For dessert my girls got the chocolate mousse cake and chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée. Of course we all got the chocolate covered strawberries. Everything we got was exceptional. I am very picky about soups. The cauliflower soup was perfectly seasoned and the mushroom soup was so good my daughter wanted to lick the bowl. The Ultimate Grilled cheese sandwiches reminded me of a caprese salad in flavor. It was wonderful dipped in the cauliflower soup by the way. I really liked the small pieces of bread provided with the meals, they were perfect for sopping up the soup in the bottom of the bowls. The desserts were divine! It was a tad confusing when we first walked in, having never been in a Cafe Zupas before, but the staff was very nice and quick to help us figure out what we wanted and they got us through the line quickly. I liked seeing the menu outside before we walked in as well. That was extremely helpful in our decision making process because we had some idea what was on the menu before we even walked in. I would suggest maybe moving a few tables/booths around so new customers know where to go when they first walk in, but otherwise, I am definitely impressed. My family will be returning here often. I might even have to sneak in for a bowl of soup while my kids are at school every once in a while. :)

It seems to be very consistent across the board at all the locations I have tried, the food is the same and service is the same, which is a good thing, you know what your getting! Decent food, decent price, good service. 
I'm a big fan of the Honey Bacon Club. I don't care for the salads. The soups are pretty good too but I wish they were hotter when you get them to eat in, they are just warm and if you don't eat it fast enough, it can almost get cold. I rather take it home if I can and heat it up a bit. Love the Garden Chowder (its not thick and heavy like a chowder usually is). Not a fan of the Wisconsin Cheddar, it's not smooth enough. The Enchilada and Tortilla soup are pretty good. Red Pepper Lobster could use more lobster. I think the soup toppings are a rip off for the price  (.69) but sometimes I can't resist adding some cheese to my soup. You get a free side of bread with your order and a chocolate covered strawberry, yum! Cakes and dessert bars are good, the crème brulee isn't ""real"" so I will never get it again.

I paid $12.10 for a soup and salad. 

As you will see in the picture I added chicken to my Kale-Quinoa salad. I paid $1.79 for extra chicken. To pay that I got a sad amount of chicken in my salad. Not even full size strips of chicken, bits and pieces for almost $2? I usually don't complain about the price. But my goodness, a little stingy on the portion for almost $2 extra for chicken. I know that restaurants try to portion out the food for food cost. I would know I use to be a Sous Chef.

To be honest, the sandwiches are kind of on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for it in FLAVOR. I usually order the ultimate grilled cheese so I can dunk in my tomato soup, which is freaking AWESOME. Also, the cherry balsamic chicken salad is BOMB DOT COM! Both are a must try. They also have a nice assortment of fruit infused waters, which are delish, if your tired of the regular old fountain soda drinks. The orange infused berry one is my favorite.

Last week , I picked up to go . They were slow . 4 people working on 2 salads is probably NOT necessary ! They had me so confused . I come home to realize That my husbands salad is also drenched in vinegar like I had asked for on mine along with his side of ranch . We have 4 kids , I couldn't run back to have it redone so there goes an over $8 salad in the trash ! The next night , I let the manager know what had happened and didn't even get an apology ! Tonight , prob made me the most mad , the portions vary so much that just to get 1 serving of chicken my husband had to request 3 . A large salad has 7 toppings , so he had 1 left then paid for 2 additional . The girl decided she would  charge him for 2 additional proteins instead of regular toppings which are $1 more each one then regular . This place needs a game plan!

I liked the Cuban so much I went and ordered more sandwiches to go for later. They screwed up my order, and gave away one of my sandwiches. They gave me a dessert for the trouble. A Million Pound bar or something like that. If you eat the whole thing in one sitting you will gain a million pounds. It's very rich. Gf liked it but it took her almost a week to finish it.

I choose the cauliflower soup and oh my goodness, I know cauliflower doesn't sound great, it was fantastic! Creamy, cheesy, and seasoned well! 

My husband opted to have cheddar and bacon topped on the soup which made it that much better!

5659595,2016-02-04,2,BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"Cafe Zupas finally opened up on the southwest side of Vegas! What a time to be alive. Both the exterior and interior are very modern and industrial, with high ceilings and a mix of wood and metal accents. The organization is a bit strange, seeing as you enter through a single (instead of double) door and have to awkwardly snake your way through dining tables in order to get to the line. They should have followed in Chipotle's footsteps and had a separated section against the wall for a line. 

There is plenty of seating and even though the line was long, it moved very quickly. Employees were not the MOST efficient but there were so many of them, their inefficiency was negligible. There is so much signage and menu options it seems a little confusing and daunting at first. Basically you order your salad and sandwich first and order soup and dessert later if you want some. 

My parents and I opted to share two preset combos, although you can order everything separately and salads can be custom made. 

Conclusion? Price is stellar for what you get and the food is much healthier than most fast casual restaurants out there. There's a great variety of choices but I find all the flavors to be to strong (too salty, too sweet, too much sauce). I could barely finish the kale and quinoa salad because it was so drenched in sweet dressing it made me sick. I'll just ask for dressing on the side next time. The sandwiches are kind of small and dinky looking though. The little chocolate strawberry is a nice touch.

Great place to stop by for a quick lunch.

I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.

My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.

The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn. 

The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction. 

Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,7,3,KREONXghQqWs3AIlLkkVBg
