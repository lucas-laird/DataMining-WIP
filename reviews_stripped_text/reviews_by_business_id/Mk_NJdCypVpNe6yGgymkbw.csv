885348,2017-08-15,0,Mk_NJdCypVpNe6yGgymkbw,Wanted ice cream on a hot day so I walked in with my friends and the lady behind the counter did not acknowledge us at all. We stood there for 10min as she made a sandwich still with no acknowledgment and looked and scowled. My friend asked me if she really did that. We left and got ice cream sandwiches at the smiths next door. The coolers of ice cream looked dirty and the ice cream was melting inside it. I wanted to try as I've heard good things but I'm about customer service and there was 0 so yah won't go back.,Ec7k5Nxp1rohv1f1nMU_ig,0,0,1,t4-CyVCwxzhBHE8KXAUH_Q

 I stopped in here after seeing the sign many times on my way to the grocery store. I'm always hesitant to go in because I don't speak Spanish and I'm afraid I'll look stupid ordering something that doesn't make sense.  But Everyone in here was really nice and I felt comfortable enough to ask questions. It was so hot what I really wanted was just one of the agua Frescas. So refreshing, a few rotating flavors every day will keep me coming back. If I wasn't so full from my recent Restaurant Week experiences I would have tried some of their ice cream products because they looked delicious.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,0,1,5,l1oUINvpVV2qiB9O4vDY9A

2428236,2017-09-25,0,Mk_NJdCypVpNe6yGgymkbw,"Visiting from out of state and looked up the closest ice cream shop. Came across Pios Pios and was pleasantly surprised to see how many different things they had besides ice cream. Tried the tamales, cup of corn, strawberries and cream and the banana split. Everything was awesome and priced great. Will definitely stop here when in town again next year.",UKk6S98BpqUZUJgEPA4fHA,0,0,5,5oJidxcxGE92nlKEC9j-GQ

5689567,2018-06-01,0,Mk_NJdCypVpNe6yGgymkbw,"This place is much more than an ice cream shop.  It's got sweet and savory crepes, sandwiches, lots of fruit juices, Mexican drinks, and more.  My boyfriend introduced me to this style of food when we first started dating and I've been in love with it ever since!

I got the nutella/strawberry crepe, omg it was so good.  I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and that just put it over the top.  I'm salivating just thinking about it :-)  Can't wait to try all the other goodies!",gS80ppRUCnFKSINjYoutRA,0,0,5,-jlIhJqNoLd0ltZO6w-WVA
