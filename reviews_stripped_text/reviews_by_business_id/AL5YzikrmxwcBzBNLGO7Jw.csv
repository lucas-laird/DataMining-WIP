I ordered the hangover 1/3 burger (came with bacon, cheese, and egg. 1/3 burger was a good size. Nice to have the condiment bar and add however much you like. The burger itself was a little over cooked, the egg too. And it was a little on the salty side. Other than that the meal was pretty good. The potatoes wedges I ordered where seasoned just right.",w_B8hRcgXOzntK4MFNefXQ,0,0,4,cCPBqitRhoxipbAyI6sYMg
124287,2012-08-27,1,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"I've had more than a few people recommend Fuddrucker's since I've started my blog, but I somehow always forget about it when I'm trying to figure out where to eat. When craving for a burger the other day my girlfriend mentioned it and it sounded like a good idea at the time. This review could very well mark the first time that I planned a revisit before I even left the building, and not because it was so good I knew I had to go back for more. Why did that happen?

Fuddrucker's has two locations in the Valley; I went to the one in the south west side of town located in your average shopping area by a Target, Sears and other typical crap. The interior is kind of country kitchen meets a Hawaiian theme or something; it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is nothing fancy or great. Also, most of the patrons reminded me of the folks I spotted the last time I visited Farmer Boys; think your average Wal-Mart customer. The menu offers a few different sized regular burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads and other things, but the items that are going to draw me back are the 'exotic' burgers made with either elk, buffalo or wild boar. More on that in a bit.

I went with the 1/2lb Original which comes with 100% USDA all-American, premium cut beef with a sesame bun with a variety of toppings available in the self-serve bar. This self-service bar is a scary, buffet-style presentation of wilted lettuce of the large slice and shredded variety, sliced tomatoes, peppers, onions and a few other items. There is also a sauce 'island' with ketchup, mustard, cheese sauces and a few other selections. I decided to keep it very simple and went with just lettuce and tomato so I could sample exactly what I was given. This was probably a mistake. The meat had bad flavor, was overcooked and dry. The thick bun was also dry and didn't have great flavor. The cheese, lettuce and tomato were all just ok, and didn't do anything to improve my burger. This burger sucked; I quickly realized that the draw could be the wild game burgers and I suddenly wanted to come back and try one despite the mess that was sitting in my hand. Mind you, this probably won't happen any time soon.

The fries also completely sucked; they were dry, generic and just not that good. They had some seasoning but it really did nothing to help the flavor, nor did the variety of sauces that I tried. From the outside I thought for the longest time that this was a slightly 'fancier' sit down restaurant similar to a Red Robin or something, I had no idea it was more or less a fast food restaurant that just served terrible food. Our meal came to $24.41 which is far too much for a crappy fast food meal for two. I will be going back at some point to check out their 'exotic' meat, but despite what so many of my readers have said, I would recommend staying away from here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,1,PTaW4IRuHPBop5y0taOtwg

However it's far from where I live. So today March 25th 2016, I came out to summerlin to eat here finally. Boy was I disappointed! The place was very dirty & the food wasn't good at all.  Our buns on our burgers were stale & the frings we ordered tasted like dirty oil & precooked then redipped when we ordered them. There was absolutely no seasoning on the burgers or fries. Our food was cold & they had barely any produce to put on the burgers. It was 6pm on a Friday night & the restraunt was very empty however alot of the tables were dirty with dishes on them & not wiped down. I had to ask the girl at the register if they could wipe down our table! Her response was we do when people leave were are you sitting & what tables are dirty? My response was almost all of the tables. The cheese sauces were dripping all over the sides of the containers, the coke machine was dirty & very sticky. The floors are horrible with sauces on them. Bathrooms are just as bad. After eating my burger only, without the bread, I told a worker that came to the table about my experience with the bread & she talked to the manager then told us he doesn't know why they gave us stale buns, when they have fresh ones that they made today. My whole thought process of this Fuddruckers is horrible. It ruined my whole night out especially driving 30+ miles to get here.

So we go to the Fuddruckers at the Grand Canyon Mall with high hopes. The day went south when what I thought was fly out of the corner of my eye, turned out to be a cockroach on the back of one of the chairs, the Ladies with me were a little freaked out. I went and called over a staff person, and nothing. So we went and found a Manager. And he could also not care less. Their whole attitude was like why were we surprised to see a cockroach? Ask Chipotle how that is working out for them.

We may go to a Fuddruckers in CA, but I doubt we'll ever go back to the one at the Grand Canyon Mall.

When I was a chubby 10 year old the idea of fixing up my own burger was mind blowing. Such freedom for a little kid. My memory of Fuddruckers was a fantasy land of food: Kaiser roll clouds floating by patty mountains and pickle slices flying overhead. Wow, that memory was viciously beaten when I tried this spot again. 

I went during lunch on a weekday and it was busy, but not slammed. I ordered a burger and fries, very basic. I was intrigued by the Elk and Ostrich burgers on the menu, but decided to stay classic. About 20 minutes later my order still hadn't been called. FINALLY, about 30 minutes after I ordered my name was called and I picked up my food. 

So they have a stand where you can dress your burger the way you like, which should speed up the kitchen....it doesn't. They have exotic toppings like pickles, lettuce, and tomato. Whats that you're thinking, those aren't special ingredients? AGREED.

All you have to tell them is which burger, how well to cook it and what type of bun you want.

I'm 23 now, so you know it's been a while. When I found out they were building a Fuddruckers by me, I was beyond ecstatic. It was Fuddrucking awesome!

Anyway, I wanted to review this place after a recent visit with my mother and brother. We came on a Sunday and were not aware that the restaurant closed at 9 PM. We arrived at 8:30 and immediately asked if they were still cooking. You could clearly tell that they were cleaning up and prepping to go home. I used to work in a restaurant and when people would come in so close to closing, I would feel the extreme animosity towards whoever came in.  We said we could leave, but their manager kindly urged us to stay. We placed our orders and they got the food out to use really quick. We had a order of onion rings with a couple of the burgers we got, and they burned them. But not so quick on the hate wagon because they hooked us up with a fresh LARGE order of onion rings on the house.

The food came out really quick and it didn't feel rushed or sloppy. There weren't employees walking around waiting for us to leave, but we wanted to eat as fast as we could because they were so nice to us. Like 15 minutes before closing people came in and you didn't see anyone look upset, they all happily served each customer and cleaned up what they could. 

I appreciated the great service and felt respected as a customer. I didn't feel once as if I was imposing while they were so close to closing up shop. The food here is always great and it's never a disappointment, especially when you are hungry. I would take anyone here as, it does not disappoint.

I am however very impressed with the customer service I received. I don't remember the two names of the ladies who helped me but they were awesome. One was an African American cashier and she really helped describe the menu and popular items to us. When I received my onion rings there was a hair on top of the order and I instantly pulled it off so the cashier and another lady could see that it was there before I grabbed it. The Caucasian lady seemed like maybe a manager or something and she was extremely rude and made some comments about how she would have no idea where that hair would come from since ""no one cooking has that color hair"" ... Ok honey but clearly you see me pulling this strand off my freshly made food.
Another African American worker who was a cook actually came to our table later and was asking what she could improve on. I thought that was really admirable and awesome because I've never been anywhere that does that. She went out of her way to help us with things and ask where she could be better and even asked if we would like our food remade.

Popped in to grab a burger for takeout when my guy had a craving. Signage was advertising their new bourbon burger with caramelized onions, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, and sweet bourbon sauce. 
Opted for the 1/2 pound version ($8) and asked for a side of fries. 
Receipt reflects that I was charged $13: apparently I was upgraded to a combo, despite not receiving a drink. Apparently a ""regular"" order of wedge fries consists of 12 pieces. For FOUR FUCKING FIFTY. ($4.49- close enough).
I somehow did not realize this while I waited 20 minutes for my order.

Was asked how I wanted my burger cooked, stated medium. Burger received was well done. Despite all the toppings listed in the ad, only the onions and bourbon sauce appeared to be present in flavor, and very scant amounts of each because it still came off as dry. Did not taste any cheese whatsoever. Fries were tasty, topped with the jalapeno cheese sauce from their condiment bar that I love so much-- just wish I didn't pay $4.49 for twelve fries.

Oh, and that part about service and a 20 minute wait for takeout?
I placed my order with one guy just as a large group walked in, creating a line that literally went out the door. No one ever stepped on to the other register.

Decent burger. (I went with the swiss melt)

2028127,2017-01-16,5,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"Maybe 3.5 stars.
I've been itching to visit this joint because I haven't had Fuddruckers since I lived in SoCal and I loved it there. I put off my visit because I read the many reviews that mentioned some cleanliness issues. While I'm glad to report that I didn't see any glaring cleanliness issues during my visit, I had some other issues.
But first, a brief description of this joint. You basically choose a size, choose toppings and add as much veggies and sauce as you want. Or you can choose from a preset menu. For sizes, you can choose from a 1/3 pound, 1/2 pound, or even 2/3 pound. You can even choose various animals whose meat you want to consume, such as Elk, Ostrich, Buffalo and some others. If you're more conservative, they also have chicken and hotdogs too.
So here is my first problem. I truly believe that the sizes are smaller than they used to be. When I was fat, I always ordered a 1/2 pound and even then I felt it was enough. The meat would be flush with the bun and I'd have to grab the burger carefully. I was hungry this time so I ordered a 1/2 pound and I felt it looked small . The meat could be completely hidden by the bun. After I finished, I felt barely satisfied. And keep in mind, I'm over 50 pounds lighter now, and I'm saying this. Since it looked small, I overloaded my burger with veggies. Maybe next time I'll try the 2/3 pound...something I never even thought about even when I was fat. Maybe I'm wrong. So if you are going for the first time, my suggestion is to just try the 1/3 pounder and go from there.
My next problem is that the staff definitely didn't look like they wanted to be there. Very cold and unfriendly. Not a fun vibe. Makes me not want to come back. 
In sum: food was still great, albeit small, but service was sub par, so 3-3.5 stars. I'll be back though because I have to try a 1/2 pound Elk Burger.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,7,5,3,PvpwbNl86h_QaraL3jtugw

I'm not cheap-- we're in an economic crisis! Haha! I get a buzzer to let me know my burger is ready (awesome so you don't have to wonder or miss hearing your name!) and when I get the burger, my high expectations aren't met.

Honestly, I came here wanting to try their ostrich burger (the tastiest animal on two legs) however they're out until August 20th. So, my hubby and I shrugged and split an elk burger instead with all the trimmings - a diet Dr. Pepper (who-hoo!) and a side of seasoned fries.

First things first - really impressed by the side bar of toppings available here. Love the fresh veggie bar of fresh iceberg (cut in wedges or shredded - wedges is better, of course!), tomatoes, onions and pickles. Personally, didn't like the salsa because the tomatoes had gotten a little too mealy but that's just my taste.

The burger came out and we were impressed by the size. When we saw it, we were instantly gratified we only ordered one burger to share.

The meat itself is good - medium done. However I felt the patty lacked seasoning. Another problem with the burger was the bun. The bun was a little too large for the patty and it wasn't anything special (kind of your average hamburger bun). Although overall, the burger was okay, I'm not sure that it would justify the 7.99 pricetag.

The fries were not that great - they lacked the crispness and adequate seasoning of a good french fry. The soda however was dead good - not the watered down stuff you see at most places. My Diet Dr.Pepper pretty much tasted like it does out of a can.

My one beef with ordering an exotic burger - there are no combo deals here. You must order a drink/fries at a la carte pricing if you were to order an exotic burger. That's why it cost $14 for a burger, fries and drink.

Overall, the burger was okay, the drink was good, the fries are not worth the price. I think I'll come back when they have ostrich just to try it.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,3,ELlRxmvJIbb2-Y_XDzjW7w

I only eat here once every few months given that there isn't one near my house, but every time I do I am not disappointed. The buffalo burger is thick and very juicy which isn't an easy feat given its low fat content. 

The condiment bar is great. I'm very picky when it comes to the amount of condiments I put on my burgers. Restaurants (fast food and sit down alike) always put too much of everything for my taste. I've also made the mistake of ordering ""light on the [mayo, mustard, etc.]"" only to receive the most minuscule amount. At Fuddruckers I get to add everything at my own preference which of course solves this problem. The fries are also really great. Thick cut and hot every time. If you like something sweet to finish off your meal the brownie is pretty good as well!

Waiting in line can sometimes be a little lengthy. I don't blame Fuddruckers for this though (and thus did not deduct any stars). I think newcomers are initially thrown off by the meat choices and repeat customers like to switch it up.

I stand corrected.

Fuddruckers is a great burger joint, surprisingly nice and with a great menu.  They have everything from elk to buffalo, ostrich and veggie burgers.  What I like is that you put on your own toppings, so I can pile the extra lettuce on myself!  I love the fact that they have a nice list of options for sides, a killer fish sandwich, and several choices for other burger toppings.  I also love their freshly baked buns.  They have a kids menu that simple, too.  There's definitely something for everyone.

I ordered the classic burger and we shared a fish sandwich.  I have to say that the burgers are really good.  Nice and juicy and not small AT ALL.  1/2 pound is the size they start at!  The bread has just the right sweetness and softness, and with the toppings I like on it, it was downright yummy.  My favorite, though, is their fried fish sandwich.  It has just the right crispiness on the outside and really good, tender, juicy fish inside.  Their tartar sauce is good, too.

If you're looking for a great burger place with variety, one that has a great eating area, a topping bar so you can make it your way, and for a great price, stop by here.  I'm honestly craving that fried fish sandwich right now!

I was a bit concerned as there was no allergen information available online or via their app. I phoned ahead to inquire whether the hamburger buns contained egg and was informed by the kind young lady that answered that, while their white buns contain egg and sesame, the wheat buns contain neither.

When we arrived, the same woman that helped me on the phone greeted us. When she realized that I was the person who called with concerns about food allergies, she immediately offered to bring out the store's general manager, Kenneth, to answer any additional questions we had. We were never made to feel that we were a bother and Kenneth was thorough in ensuring that our family could dine safely (he even phoned the corporate office to verify ingredients).

The dining experience was awesome and everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed the food.  The custom burgers we had were cooked to order and were tasty and visually appealing.  The fresh topping bar had a variety of produce to choose from (pickles, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, etc.).  The milkshakes we had (Oreo and strawberry) were a decadent and yummy treat that my kids loved.  I appreciated the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine to mix up my favorite soft drink flavors as well.  The restaurant was clean and well-stocked with condiments and napkins.

We will definitely be returning to this restaurant not just for the food but especially because of the genuine kindness and customer service shown to us by Kenneth and his staff.

It is fun that you can choose the size of your burger and that they offer some exotic meats. The open bar for burger toppings also makes the Fuddrucker experience a little bit different from your typical burger joint. The burgers themselves are greasy, but I have to say quite tasty! Unfortunately, that's really the best I can come up with. I have now gone through the ""Fuddrucker experience"" a couple of times and tried a few variations, but this time I decided it just isn't good enough when there are so many other options out there.

The buns are not note-worthy in any way, and the same can be said of the swiss or cheddar cheese if you choose these as additional toppings. But at least these are not bad toppings, which cannot be said for the blue cheese or grilled onion toppings. They add something to the blue cheese (I imagine to save on cost), but it makes it look & taste grainy. And those grilled onions (sometimes called caramelized onions) are, well, not grilled. When you grill an onion, the sugars caramelized and give it a wonderful sweetness that makes them special, and these are tasteless. I suspect they boil the onions, and then just mix them with some grease.

We have tried every side dish, and except for the mozzarella sticks, they are soggy & greasy & gross. And now they have gotten rid of the mozzarella sticks. If you must order a side dish, ask for it extra crispy, which will help a lot. But even then, when you eat the onion rings it will feel more like you are just eating fried batter more than anything else.

I have always found the restaurant clean, and the staff very nice. But it's a restaurant, and the reason you go is for the food. Or, in this case, the reason you don't go.

Finding it: It is in the same shopping center area as Target, on the south side of Flamingo. Look for the traffic light closest to Target, head south, and you will see Fuddrucker's almost in front of you, toward the right.",OdexeMpufpv2H4yZt2dIZg,0,0,2,9oO55zzat_5_lb6DMWVICQ

Select from their menu of specialty burgers or build your own by choosing your meat option and adding whatever premium toppings  that you desire for $1 each. It's easy to create a burger costing nearly $20, but  I couldn't skip out on adding grilled mushrooms, a fried egg, and grilled onions -- whatever, first time there so I lived a little. Basic toppings can be found at the buffet located near the assortment of condiments. I passed on the greenery after noticing that the lettuce tongs were contaminated with pieces of onion and tomato. 

My 1/2 pound buffalo burger was just OK. The blue cheese wasn't the best choice -- my bad. The patty was good, so it didn't disappoint. I was surprised to find out that the fried egg was fully cooked. There's no point in adding an egg if it's not going to be runny - What. The. FUDD.  At least the burger was filling. 

Service was decent, and each table is assigned a server who cleans up your table and serves you beverages. 

The restaurant could use some tidying. I noticed trash on the floors near the soda fountain machine, as well as partially-filled beverages that appeared to have been forgotten.

3652381,2015-09-13,2,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"Fuddruckers is one of those places that I've always said I really enjoy, although I haven't been in years. I remember it being very good, but after my visit today, I'm not sure where I got that idea from.  The one thing I am sure of is that I won't be coming back to this location if I ever eat at a Fuddruckers again.

I'll start with what I did like...

The burger toppings bar was well stocked and all the veggies looked crisp and colorful. The lettuce was bright green, the tomatoes red... It was like a little farmer's market in there. Impressive!

And like all Fuddruckers, they had the hot jalapeño nacho cheese pump set up and operational, which is always good.

Everything else about my experience was terrible, however.  

I ordered a hangover burger (patty, fried egg, American cheese, bacon) cooked to medium. It was well done...dead, grey meat. If there was any seasoning, I didn't taste it. It seemed as though they took one slice of bacon and broke it into three equal-sized pieces instead of giving an adequate amount of bacon to constitute the extra money. The egg was fried hard. Kind of a bummer since I like a little yolk, but they didn't ask how I like my eggs and I didn't tell them, so I guess I really can't complain about that much. Maybe the cooks are trained to cook out the yolk to prevent mess. Overall, the burger was mediocre, bland, over cooked... Not at all like I remember the food here.

I remember enjoying their wedge cut fries.. Maybe I should have stuck to what I know. I ordered chili cheese fries because it sounded awesome. What I got was cold fries covered in lukewarm chili topped with cheese that was maybe half-melted. It was soggy and hard to finish.

My wife got the southwest burger. It was also burnt, but not a problem since it was ordered well-done. The guacamole, however, was sour tasting in her opinion so she didn't finish her food either.

To make the experience worse, there was an obnoxious customer sitting two tables over from us who felt it necessary to belch loudly throughout his meal. It was disgusting to say the least.  I know this isn't fuddrucker's fault, but it didn't help the situation any.

I was excited about stopping here for lunch. It's a fun concept for a burger place where you get to load your burger with as many of your favorite toppings as you want. Unfortunately, this location killed any positive memories I might have had of this establishment, and with so many great places to eat in town, I doubt I'll ever try it again.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,1,0,1,QkCKhmRDUFTpzsoHVwuMwA
3663927,2011-09-25,1,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"I always heard about this place and was curious to try it.  Well it just so happened that one night when I made the rare trip to the southwest part of the valley to pick up the jacket for my suit JCPenney was holding for me, I spotted Fuddruckers!  So the dinner choice was quite clear.

Once inside I wasn't sure if it was going for a fast food or restaurant ambiance.  Everything was set like a fast food place but then the prices (15 per person) and the seating area contrasted greatly.  Regardless the cashier recommended the buffalo burger based saying how much leaner it was and that the ostrich burger was currently out of season so we ordered that along with half onion rings, half fries.  

When we got our order I was excited to take a stab at the array of condiments and toppings for us.  I ordered grilled onions and pepper jack cheese on my burger as well so it wasn't toppingless to begin with but of course that didn't stop me.  Jalapeno cheese sauce on the fries?  Don't mind if I do!  Pico de gallo on my burger?  Perfect!  Mayonnaise?  Nope, I avoid that like the plague these days (as if the cheese wasn't fattening enough either).  

Once we sat down to finally eat and see if the price was worth it . . . like the suspense?  As if the rating didn't give it away . . . it was!  I ordered my burger medium-rare and every bite I could feel the juices flowing in my mouth and the cheese and grilled onions were the perfect compliment.  The fries and the onion rings were also huge and also delicious!  Whether with cheese, ketchup or Au natural those sides were crispy and full of flavor.  Overall I felt greatly satisfied.  I dare say, almost as much as In'N Out?  

I don't know how often I'll take a trip to that side of town in the future but when I do, I know one place I'll think about popping in at.  I just need to find out when ostrich meat is in season.",xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg,1,1,4,s-qVv3ykyKnN9FWuIiC92Q

This time I got the elk burger. Although not as big as the others, I guess a quarter pounder, I never leave feeling hungry. 
The meat was excellent, moist, not dry at all. Slightly gamey but just enough that you know it's not beef but something a little more exotic.
The buns are excellent...If I could only find these locally - but that's another story.

And of course the topping bar. Anytime I get free stuff, I'm happy. Well I think of it as free but it's the little things that make my belly smile. Any time I can load up a burger sky high with jalapenos I'm happy dude.

One of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.

The Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.

I like how the set up is that you order your burger and it's served plain with the exception of cheese. Then you make your way over to the self serve station to stack it as you see fit with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles (or no pickles. I hate pickles!), ketchup, mustard and so on.

Only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because the seating area is filthy. And when they do decide to clean they bring out a vacuum and clean right next to their customers. Like really? It's not how I want to enjoy my meal. Bring out a dust pan or something! Sheesh.

4052560,2012-11-06,2,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"Quick Review:
Cleanliness:  4 stars
Staff:  4 stars
Food (taste/portion):  2 stars
Price:  1

Good stuff first...restaurant was clean and staff is as good as it gets.  Now for the bad stuff.  This visit was for one thing only....their Ostrich Burgers.  

For those that haven't had Ostrich before, here's the scoop.
-Low fat, about 5 grams
-Low calories about 194 (minus the bun)
-High protein, at least 40 grams
-Taste: Like Beef

Always been a fan of Ostrich and had it at least once a month.  In the California Fuddruckers, ostrich was eliminated from their menu due to cost.  I asked fellow Yelpers out here and Cat C. suggested to try Fuddruckers in Summerlin.  Thanks Cat C!!!  I bookmarked it and made a call.  Sure enough, they confirmed that this location still had it.  

As soon as I arrived, I noticed that the prices are still $9.99 for their exotic burgers.  Their exotics consist of Elk, Wild Boar, Buffalo, Salmon, Turkey, and Ostrich.  Ostrich didn't have the $9.99 price, it was labeled ""Market Price"". Market Price for an Ostrich Burger was $13.99 on tonight's visit.  Keep in mind that this didn't include fries or a drink.  This was bit higher than what I'm used to paying, but I just had to have it.  Then the cashier (possibly one of the supervisors) stated that all their exotics are no longer 1/2 lb burgers.  All have been reduced to 1/3 lb. This only made the $13.99 price for a burger now even more expensive.  Again, just had to have it.  She felt bad for me and hooked me up with a drink.  Wow, but it's the thought that counts.  

I gave this place an overall 3 stars because the price and portions.  Their service and cleanliness actually boosted their status to me.

Only had the Ostrich at this location and it was so good.  Just a bit expensive in my opinion.  

I've tried their other exotics at some point.  Here's my thoughts on them.
-Turkey Burgers:  Actually prefer Island's or Red Robin's
-Buffalo:  Taste and quality pretty good. My only issue is the after taste
-Elk:  A bit dry and the after taste is like Buffalo
-Wild Boar:  Never again. Imagine what a wild boar looks like. Then imagine what it would taste like.  Yes, that's what you get.

I'm still on my quest for a good ostrich burger at a decent price.  Due to the economy, all their exotics have been reduced to 1/3 lbs compared to 1/2 lbs a year ago.  I still know locations in San Diego that have ostrich burgers, but we're taking a 5 hour drive.  And plus, it's possible that they too have either eliminated ostrich or up'd the prices.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,4,3,3,ZVWiXIpWwLzWy1QUl2Z7vQ
4074273,2013-06-04,0,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"I love Fuddruckers, it's a great place to get a good, filling burger. This location is just good -- not great, but good. It can sometimes be very good, depending on who is cooking that day. I get the feeling this location relies heavily on a microwave (watch the cooks and if you catch them zapping your food speak up)! The seasonings are also sometimes ""off."" On several occasions I've been either served a burger that tasted like nothing or as rubbery as a hockey puck. Other times I've been served the tastiest, juiciest, most super flavorful burger. 

The 3 Cheese burger is my favorite, I usually load it with super crispy bacon and then top it off on the fresh toppings bar. I really like the sweet relish and pico de gallo that's available on this toppings bar. One complaint is that sometimes the bar is poorly stocked. I was there a few days ago and the spicy mustard container was completely empty.

We decided to go to Fuddruckers because it's been a long time. We have one in our home town but we never ate there together. It kind of felt like a first date in a way. I remembered I used to go on dates to Fuddruckers in high school ...then songs from high school kept coming on . I will not say which ones because I don't want to date myself! It felt surreal ...and kind of funny. 

When the girl behind the counter asked what type burger combo we wanted she complimented my jacket right off. I added a star for that ....just joking I didn't ...I still remained objective. We both ordered a one item combo so basically it was a burger, fries , and a drink in my case . My husband had the onion rings instead. The two combos came to about $25.00. 

When we received our burgers we started to doctor them up to our specifications. The condiment section looked smaller then what I remember but it has all the basics of what you would want on a burger. They had tomatoes, lettuce, onion, jalapeno, and pepperchinis etc. They also had mayo, ketchup ,mustard and my favorite spicy mustard. On top of that they had bottles of A-1 sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and malt Vinegar. I took a bit of vine gear for my fries because some people say it's good together. It was okay . They also had melted cheese for your fries which I tried too. One was regular cheese and the other was Jalapeno cheese . I chose the Jalapeno cheese which was tasty with the fries. The fries come with spices on them so ordinary ketchup would also be good. 

The burger was tasty but I thought a tad overpriced for what it was. I think to make the pricing more worth while they should add two sides or add on a dessert since there are only three side choices fries, onion rings and coleslaw.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,3,68DkBW7-ec58Oii9dr3Sng

I like that the quality has been consistent at each visit. Good, but not amazing. I like that they have some less conventional options, like bison. I don't like that they have a self serve condiment/toppings station because I'm a bit of a germophob, but I know that most people probably love it.

Service is pretty good. It was slow on this visit so that may have helped. We didn't have to wait to order, food came pretty quick, and there was someone working the dining room to whisk away your trash.

My biggest complaint on this visit was that the area where you get your drinks and straws and napkins was pretty trashed. There were straw wrappers all over the floor in front of it for example.

We got in line to place our order.  While in line, we scouted out a table that would accommodate the 7 of  us and there was only one.  Although the table had been wiped off, the seats were dirty and there were squished hamburgers and french fries squashed into the carpet underneath that table. Not just a few...many.  

After placing our order, which  was $100 for hamburgers and french fries for 7 people, the floor and chairs had the same mess, so we asked if they could clean that place.  (Most tables there only seat 4 people) 

We walked over to the table and the girl who was cleaning the table was mad and told us that we could have chosen any other table...she would have pushed them together for us.  Really, there were not 2 next to each other and I am not sure why she would make a big deal about cleaning this table.  Factually, it was a disgusting eyesore for everyone around.  Fuddruckers is not really an inexpensive place to buy hamburgers, it was $14 per person on average and some of our party were children.  The point being, no one wants to pay that much money and sit  in a really filthy place.  In my opinion, they do not have enough employees to designate for cleaning and this girl was overwhelmed.  She kept complaining out loud where guests could hear.

It got worse:  While waiting for our food, some guests got up because there was a COCKROACH on their booth and we watched in disgust for 5 minutes while this employee chased around the cockroach and then found others, which were apparently coming from under the booth seat ( It was the kind you can lift the chair top off and the bottom is a hollow wood bench. ) 

They called our name and we went to pick up our order.  Unfortunately, they had overcooked my child's chicken tenders so much it was a dark brown and hard as a rock.  They did remake it, but the fact is, they never should have tried to serve something like that.  Where is the quality control?  

Bathrooms are grimy, black grime is built up in every corner.  The carpets need to be cleaned.

So, attitude, unsanitary and burned food.  It's gone way downhill since our last visit.  Maybe the health department needs to come take a look.",CcS_Ns-aTHIwfsnwp0D1uw,3,1,1,8mOMIgROlktcqQXQ5Nu4Zw

4654991,2016-09-25,5,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"Feeling the brunt of a Post-hiking appetite, I stopped at Fuddruckers on the way home from Mount Charleston. This was my first stop in a Fuddruckers since 2011. It hasn't been easy to stop in a Fuddruckers when this is the remaining one of two in Las Vegas (the other one is in the Orleans). 

  The remaining freestanding Fuddruckers stands in the Target-Sear's Grand Shopping Center to the southwest of the 215 and Flamingo Road. It is a large restaurant served by a larger parking lot reaching to Target. Inside, there are numerous seating areas between walls covered by Las Vegas and Hollywood nostalgia pictures. The decorations include pics of Elvis Presley and a mural mimicking the ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign that says ""Welcome to Fuddruckers Las Vegas"" sign. Closer to the entrance there are two arcade machines including Ms. Pac Man. The wall decorations and two arcade games come in handy to keep your mind occupied when it takes at least twenty minutes for your hamburger to be ready. 

    Fuddruckers is similar to the higher priced self service hamburger restaurants. You order off a menu at the counter, pay exorbitant prices, then pick up the food when the buzzer goes off. The menu choices included burgers, a chicken sandwich, Buffalo burger, shakes, and Americana food. The menu breaks down the burger choices between 1/3 and 1/2 pounder. An additional $4.59 upgrades it to a meal. 

   At the counter, in a restaurant filled with families and teenagers, I ordered the Works burger. The 1/2 pounder version costed me $8.04 before the value meal. I paid an additional $4.59 to enjoy my burger with fries and a Coke. After paying Regina $13.66, she explained the Fudruckers process. When my buzzer went off I would pick up my food at the counter. There are two Coke Freestyle machines to fill up the glass. There is a topping bar to the left to top off my sandwich. 

   When I picked up the food twenty minutes later, I was confident that the cooks in the open kitchen made it fresh. At Fuddruckers they leave the top bun open to show the inside of the sandwich. The open top bun that is supposedly made in house fresh every day showed a burger with bacon, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms. That was before my trip to the toppings bar. Courtesy of the toppings bar, I added tomatoes, onions, and jalapeños on the side. I passed over the pickles and lettuce. When all was said and done, I was biting into a thick burger that was good yet nothing exceptional. I'd detour from the burger to work on the potato wedge fries. By the time I left Fuddruckers after a five year hiatus, my post-hiking appetite was momentarily gone. 

   In conclusion who knows if it will be another five years before I return to Fuddruckers. In all honesty for the $13.66 I exchanged for a self-service restaurant burger combo, there are far better dinners that I could have brought for around that price range.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,7,3,FfPsYF27y91sHYUZk8K_gw

Coming from SoCal, home of In-N-Out, I've never really heard of Fuddruckers till someone mentioned it to me. Check out my In-N-Out review for the different types of burgers. Fuddruckers fit in the more complicated and beefy restaurant gourmet burger, so expect to pay a bit more than In-N-Out, Jack In the Box, or others.

Ordering was a little tricky at first because of the options, but also because the mention was a little confusing. I went with the 2/3 lb burger, fries, and drink combo. Total came out to about $11 which is wow. But like I said before, gourmet burger hence the higher price tag.

First bite made me go, this burger is certainly not worth the price. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but not worth the money for what I got. The fries weren't anything special and I love fries. I felt I should have just grabbed something at In-N-Out and get something that tastes as good and be cheaper.

This place shines in the exotic meats like ostrich, elk, and bison. Didn't get a chance to try it, but maybe next time. Its worth trying for the exotic meats, but this place doesn't instill much confidence in me when it can't execute a simple burger at a non restaurant burger price.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,1,0,3,8S5ABe5Z4rTqeoPgohmn4Q

We were a little intimidates because the line was so long (a little league team was here and the families were all arriving one by one).

The cashier was really friendly and welcoming, and was very quick. 

We ordered: 
Three cheese burger, medium rare, add blue cheese and bacon - the burger was more medium and didn't have any bacon on it. 
Buffalo burger with provolone, medium - wasn't sure what temperature is recommended for buffalo, so she recommended medium. It actually turned out more medium well than medium. 
Elk burger, medium - she also recommended medium for this one, but it was also more medium well.
Fudd's fries - these were pretty awesome!!! 

Pros: I do like that the sauces and veggies are available at condiment and topping bars. Service is super quick, even though the line is still pretty long 

Cons: temperature on the meats. We also felt mildly claustrophobic, but again it was pretty busy.

After long search of what to eat, my stepdad and I ended up here.  He was craving for a veggie-burger and I was just hungry.  It is a little overpriced but I have to admit, I don't mind paying the price of their burgers since the way it's made is unforgettable.  

We ordered our food as if we were in a McDonald's restaurant but the difference is we were given a square gadget that buzzes to let us know our order was ready.  My stepdad ordered the veggie burger with fries and drink, and I ordered the salmon burger with coleslaw and drink.  Every salmon order I've made the past few months have been a disappointment so I had low expectations on this.

Our gadget started buzzing and off we went to get our order as if we were in In&Out Burger.  Now, this is how our food looked; the bun with the salmon/veggie meat on top and the top bun separated.  Fries and coleslaw on the side.  After we took our trays, there was a side bar with all the fixings to add on the burgers:  half chopped lettuc, tomatoes, white onions, red onions, loose leafe lettuce, salsa, pickles, etc.  In another station close by are the sauces like mayonaisse, ketchup, bbq sauce, cheese sauce, etc.

Once we got done getting the side items, we were ready to dig in.  I didn't realize how hot the salmon was so when I bit in to it, I burned my tongue.  But, the burn was oh so worth it.  The salmon was fresh and didn't have that nasty old fish taste.  For the first time in months, I enjoyed salmon.  When combined with mayonaise, lettuce, tomatoe, and red onions, the combination of all gave a an explosion as though being the first night in a honeymoon.  

My stepdad was very impressed with his burger and would like to come back again.  I ordered my boyfriend a 1/3 pounder burger.  He was also very happy with it and said he hasn't had a burger that tasted as awesome as that in a long time.

They grill up your burger and call your name when the food is ready.  It's pretty quick for a fresh burger made when it's ordered.

The beef tasted different and lacked fulling flavorful and the mouth watering taste that I experience at every other  Fuddruckers I have even been to (in Texas) and it makes me sad that my friend who lives in Vegas had to taste this sub-par burger. 

Would I eat here or recommend this place to anyone. No.

They also had 1 pound burgers available w/ an even bigger bun for it.  We probably could've ordered that and split it I guess.  Didn't actually get to see anyone inhale one of those but it would've been amusing.

At first, I thought this place was a party Favors store our something, not knowing it wad a restaurant.  Derrr....  Finally, I learned that this place is a strict burger joint that prides themselves on their unique menu.  

Unfortunately, the ostrich burger was out, but the buffalo and elk burgers were available.  I opted with the elk since I assumed that it was harder to come by, let alone all the rave reviews by fellow Yelpers.  

To my surprise, the burger was not as gamey as everyone makes it out to be, in fact, it did not not distinctly different imo.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but for the upcharge, not sure if the meal was worth it.  The plus is that good ol' Elmer Fuddrucker offers both onion rings and potato wedges as a combo for no extra charge.

Otherwise, I would have to wait for when the ostrich is available to give them a chance on redemption.  The service is decent, nothing spectacular and the staff is friendly, but overall, issss aiiight.

So till next time, I'll let y'all know if they got me back on board with the ostrich.  Wonder if they serve manatee out elephant burgers.  I can already see Chic Fil a commercials in my head.  Even my write up is mediocre since the place didn't wow me that much.  I did get full of a third, okay, I'm reaching for positives now, I'm out!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,0,3,RAYT4dY6_NX5ZN8oaxGm2Q

i wasn't pleased. 

so i came here thinking it was a sit down restaurant, and boy was i wrong. 
you walk in through the doors, and wait in line. when it's your turn, you order. 
and ordering is a hassle. maybe i'm too asian to figure out how to freaking order a burger, but i thought it was a bit challenging. 
then they give you a buzzer thingy that lights up. 
now you have to find a place to sit. 
OH MY GOSH, what a pain! you have to stake out a table and try to anticipate who's going to be done with their meal first and jump on it. 
when your food is ready, you go up to get it, and then you have to put your own lettece and tomato on it. [it's kinda like a buffet line] i give them extra kudos for making sure it was fresh, because the veggies DID look very very very fresh. 
then you finally sit down and get to eat. not in peace though, because others are waiting for your table. 

i ended up paying $10 for a 1/3lb burger and wedges. they charged me extra for my grilled onions and guac. 
i think it's WAYYYYY overpriced for all the hassle i had to go through. you don't even pay that much at a sit down restaurant. 

yeah, the burgers were good, i guess. but i would never go back.

I ordered my burger well done and my husband ordered his medium-well, both were made correctly. 

When we first got our meal I noticed our burger didn't have the bacon on it, which we paid additional for. The worker at the same time passed by our table and overheard us. He was so kind and approached us very sincerely. He took our burger and brought it back correct. He was a busser but went beyond that title. Checked up on us again afterward. I asked his name and he said his name was Danny. Someone shake his hand because he knows how to give customer service 100%!.

At first I didn't really want to order a combo because it's an additional 4.50 so for a bourbon meal it was approx $13. But when the fries came then I understood why. Fries were very well made. Not greasy at all. And seasoned nicely.

I will start with the meh:

First off, they raised the prices and took away the union discount. That bugged me a little, to have a discount for union members and then just take it away. Bah! Also, it was $40 for lunch, 3 burgers, fries and drinks, and that just seems high to me, especially since you can get a cheaper lunch at nearby places (Custom Built or Five Guys are great) Really for a place where you order at a counter and grab your own food when it is done, I do not expect to pay $40 for lunch. The place was pretty empty compared to how I remember it from before, so maybe other people feel the same?

On to the good:

The food was very good. We all enjoyed the burgers and fries and the toppings bar is always fun. The employees working that day were super nice and attentive. 

If I was rating just the food and employees I would give it 5 stars for sure, but the high price and no more union discount irritates me enough to drop 2 stars.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,1,3,0hMy0RUvga_HA5mZD2mGSw

We were in the area and decided to pop in for dinner. Luckily, it was Tuesday and kids eat free. Perfect! 

You order your food when you walk in. They give you a buzzer so you can go up and get your food when it's ready. We ordered 2 1/3lb burger combos and 2 kids Mac n cheese 1 with fries and the other with apples. The burgers cost $5.59 and it's $4.59 to make it a combo, which is a drink and fries. Kids meals are usually $4.49. After tax, our total was $22.04. 

There's an area with vegetables and condiments for your burger as You put them on yourself once you get your food. They even had melted jalapeño cheddar cheese or regular cheddar cheese. 

Food came out in 10 minutes or so... let's start with the burgers. They were dry, plain and nothing special. Unfortunately, my husband and I don't care for them at all. We really wanted to like them, but no. Carl's Jr. Has better burgers. The fries were ok, but you do need to eat with ketchup or something because it can be dry by itself. The kids Mac n cheese was the kraft one out of the box, so you can't go wrong with that. The apples were a bit sour, but they give a nice portion. 

The dining area was a decent size. There were a lot of tables that were waiting to be cleared and cleaned. Someone did make their way around to do that when we were almost done with our meal. 

The bathroom could use a little attention. It smelt like pee! 

On a good note, the cashier was friendly. She greeted us when we entered.

5837423,2013-06-06,1,AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw,"On the eve of a Midwest Road Trip, Diane and I selected Fuddruckers for a sendoff dinner.  My Swiss Melt 1/3-lb. Burger with Mushrooms, Grilled Onions, and Wedge Cut Fries was very tasty, and the Wedge Cut Fries were great, with and without the restaurant's Signature Cheese Sauce and Jalapeno Cheese Sauce.  But I found the Hamburger Bun to be relatively small for a burger of this size, and the meat inside was more medium than medium rare as ordered.  The two cheese sauces tasted identical, except one had bits of potent jalapeno embedded in the slowly flowing cheese.

I was impressed that all vegetables on display at the produce bar were super fresh, and there were two types of lettuce and two types of pickles available.  The Dill Pickle Chips were real juicy.  So much so that vibrant pickle juice actually squirted into my throat.  Fat Fries were really good, but on the soft side.  

For good measure, and to sample something new, I also downed a Jumbo Hot Dog that was listed on the check as a ""Dogzilla.""  Also coming with Wedge Cut Fries, this was a very big split and grilled John Morrell All-Beef Frank laid out on a rather bready Hot Dog Bun.  About this time I found that the Signature Cheese Sauce had run out.  After telling the manager, he provided a ladle for me to draw out a needed sum of cheese sauce below the dispensing area rather than refill the sauce container, informing me that it takes 45 minutes to prepare a new batch and less than an hour remained before closing.  Since I was able to spoon out all cheese sauce that I desired, I found this decision to be reasonable.      

I washed everything down with a very good smooth and cold Chocolate Milk Shake that looked swirled but tasted solid.  When initially presented, there was more creamy liquid goodness in the accompanying milk shake tin than in the large filled glass itself.  Amazing!

Just before we left the premises, I heard the manager telling other diners that they had to be out in 15 minutes by the posted closing time with to go orders only or sit at outdoor tables ""because of labor costs.""  This position I found to be somewhat unreasonable, since it is customary for restaurants to allow all diners who arrive before the posted closing time to remain inside at least another 30 to 60 minutes to finish their meals.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,3,4,cYen4QRb-Rz2G38ADT_dCw

One time a girl was the cashier she was nice, and very attractive. The 2nd time I came here cause I saw online they have game burgers, exotic meats, so I signed up online to get updates with my e-mail and they sent me a coupon for a burger, fries & a drink for 7$. Usually I'm guessing depending on the burger you get it would be 12$ for that. I went the 2nd time with the coupon and asked if I could use it towards the bison burger. He said yes, and I was going to pay the difference. Which came out to me 11$ or something. But I got confused, and was like I don't get why it's so much, and was asking him about that. For some reason my brain thought it was 7$ for a burger, and the math in my head was thinking so it's 9$ for the bison burger or like 10$ for the bison burger, n I subtracted 7$ from 10$ and was thinking I should be paying 3$ or something. I'm not good @ math. Sometimes I literally shut my brain off, cause I don't want to think and I have to turn the switch back on the make it work. Anyway I just asked the dude to explain it to me, and he was like he got pissed off @ me for asking him. Maybe it was cause there where 2 people behind me, IDK, but there was another cashier there they could have called to the front. N If I think someone it ripping me off, that amount of difference, I'm going to ask them to explain how they got that price. Just trying to understand. Later the dude said ''sorry for the confusion'' that really didn't help make me feel better. I don't like to be yelled @ n really customers shouldn't ever be yelled @, well he didn't yell he just raised his voice in a uncalled for, rude way. The dude was much older, could be a grandpa N I'd expect he'd be wiser then that. He should have said, sorry for raising my voice to you. Cause its not his fault I was confused. It's my lack of paying attention in math classes fault 4 the confusion. When I worked in customer service, @ my mothers restaurant, I never yelled or raised my voice to customers , even when they deserved it, like where cursing @ me, cause someone got there order wrong. In the customer service industry you should always act professional, no exceptions. Raising your voice to a customer is not professional. I'm not saying I won't be back here, but I may avoid that dude. The bison burger was sorta small, and was okay.
