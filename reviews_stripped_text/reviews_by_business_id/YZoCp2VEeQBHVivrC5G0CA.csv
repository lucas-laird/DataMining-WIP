724630,2015-07-29,1,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"PT'S is generally a good fallback for a decent meal, a beer and maybe some video poker. They are usually a bit smokey however. The bartender got my order wrong but the food was still okay. I had not been to this location. The bartender that relieved the first was Crystal and she was far more friendly and helpful.",048mif2uzPN800T90sAmyw,1,0,2,kRbKm0poy9lQKm3IBryuzA

My friend and I are always looking for new places to explore and we will definitely be back here in the future. Thank you for the great service!,pXNZYh9NOKEk_3AlssNS2g,1,1,5,pnF5yWm6_h_XoEa_nX0QSQ

1790723,2015-01-08,0,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"I went to this PT's because, I had a long wait for an oil change, and it was right across the street. To my surprise... I found Jennifer there... It was her first day there, because she had transferred there from the PT's I'd normally visit. 

The decor is really cool. I really liked the layout. It felt very warm and cozy. 

The shopping center is very easily accessible. 

The food was pretty much up to PT's Standards. I had a chicken sandwich... The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the vegetables, along with the bread was very fresh.

The service was exceptional. It wasn't extremely busy, but the customers were pretty spread out, and the bar tenders spent equal time with each person sitting at the bar. 

As many of my followers know, it's very rare for me to rate a business with 5 Stars... This PT's earned each of those stars.

I can't wait to go visit Jennifer, and the rest of the staff again!!",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,2,0,5,_qoe9kjawaWCgz7HFkHYiw
2277496,2018-06-11,0,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"I'm typically not a PT's fan nor do I frequent the business, however I decided to pop in this location one day to watch the Vegas Golden Knights game and have a couple drinks.

SERVICE: The one thing that really stood out about this location was the service. It was a very professional and warm interaction. The bartender shook my hand and introduced himself and was overall helpful jovial and accommodating. I also noticed it was not just one bartender that practiced this type of good attentive service it was the other bartender as well.

MENU: I took a gander at the menu and while the menu seemed to have some very good items on it -evidenced by seeing some things come out of the kitchen to other patrons, I opted not to order anything just due to the fact that the prices were so inflated for even simple items. 

ATMOSPHERE: It seems like a warm and inviting atmosphere 

For those looking for a solid experience this is it",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,0,0,3,e_SxIu4MraoUufJt2UWAUQ
2296683,2015-04-11,0,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"I have to retract my earlier check in at this location, I was NO good times at this place. We met up a group of friends, all fairly new to this side of town and decided to meet up here and shoot some pool. Me and the misses show up a little early and have a few drinks while we're waiting for the rest of the group and pool tables to open up. Just around the time everyone showed up the tables were free to play, we politely ask the previous players if they were done and they were. So now we need this so called bartender to unlock a game so we can play, we ask politely if we could use the tables and this motherfucker doesn't even have the nerve to turn his back around and answers the tables are broken when we just watched these other people JUST GET OFF like WTF kind of service is that! So we closed our tab because obviously this bitch ass bartender didn't want our service, and will never step foot in that location again if that's the way they treat paying customers. Business must be good!!!",_337WCoHR-ZeQO5qN-aHew,1,0,1,rFE75VWs-Mbui25USLvkCA

5228654,2016-02-15,3,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"Came out to PTs Saturday night for my good friend's birthday party, and had a good time.

PTs is always good for food, $5 an hour pool, and good drinks.  

They have a killer half off happy hour special at midnight, too!

LOVED that Karate Karaoke was there!!  Had a blast singing all night. This place has better acoustics than some of the places I've been recently, and everyone sounded great.  

Bartenders were nice to me, and my husband.  I hear that one of them was not so nice to someone in my party but all of my interactions were good. 

Clean bathrooms, and very spacious.  I enjoyed myself quite a bit.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,3,3,BPNA3LQppMm5Dis9evR-2g

5630730,2015-04-04,1,YZoCp2VEeQBHVivrC5G0CA,"I've been coming to this particular pub for the steaks since I was a young girl.
I didn't notice that it had become a PT's since then, and decided to go in anyways.
The steak special and price obviously changed since PT's bought out the location, but those weren't the only things that changed dramatically.

I've come here three times in 2015, and three times too much.
In the time I've come here, I:
-Have had experienced very cold side dishes (Basically, the veggies were so cold that it felt they were defrosted for a minute in the microwave and then plated.)
-Staff that is attentive, but has attitude.
-My order being wrong.


Other than that, the 50% off happy hour is awesome, and I love that, but not enough to justify rating this particular location more than one star.",soFNjo1-ao4grGSJ0u9S4g,1,0,1,JR5mgKSWyX19PsDPsCV3qw
