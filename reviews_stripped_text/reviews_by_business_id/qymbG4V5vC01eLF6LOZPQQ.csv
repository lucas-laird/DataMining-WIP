They can also sell other specialty items by request (if made in advance) if you have a craving for something off menu.  Definately a zillion times better and more authentic than ""Gyro time"".

There is outdoor seating in the strip mall area which is nice for April/Sept temperature in Vegas :)  Always a plus.",ECY7iCCT-rWua69IbvlrYA,1,1,4,qAuzHr--ayWURea4d8atGA

They always recognize me when I go in, greet me with smiles and make me feel special. They are a bit hidden in the strip mall location. They could be easily missed if you aren't aware they are there.
They also have delicious bagels and pistachio baklava!!!! 
Oh and they have hookah and belly dancing some evenings.",lm0qcv3UMzbUkO0hJ85SbQ,0,0,4,HsIGwprTvfyItLdaqqydTA
