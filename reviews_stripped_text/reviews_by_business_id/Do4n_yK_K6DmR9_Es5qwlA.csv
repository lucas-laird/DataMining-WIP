Pasteries are beautiful looking and displayed in a case. The cinnamon roll, raspberry croissant, and blueberry muffin are yummy. Be aware: if you get an espresso with flavor, the flavor cost $1. I was a little shocked. Did it one morning and didn't order another espresso from them! :) 

You go to the counter to order yourself, get called when your food is ready or pick it up right when you order it. (Depends on what you order.)

(Warning: young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Since we were often at the Wynn, we stopped here several times out of convenience. You are definitely paying for convenience and location. However as other friends noted, for a few dollars more than the price you pay here, it's a better value to just eat at the Wynn's buffet. 

DECENT SANDWICHES AND COFFEE
From the Breakfast Burrito to the Croissant Sandwich, Lox on a Brioche and the Coffee... everything was decent, not bad, but not memorable either. My belly was nicely filled but there wasn't much enjoyment in the flavors. 

SIDE NOTE ON THE DRINKS AND HOURS
This is the only 24-hour 'restaurant' at the Wynn which is pretty convenient and it's right in the main casino room. The Coffee side is able to make a good variety of brews. I noted 'Boba teas' were also on the menu- it was a bit out of place.",nlQGyti20c07rpTSYYoNZQ,1,0,2,1Q2kH1dc7d0lFEoDqedETg

The second night I get a pepperoni panini or quesadilla - they called it a panini but it looked like a quesadilla. The dough raw and sweet, the pepperoni was almost raw and non-existent, and the pizza sauce served with it was cold. Each of the above set me back over $10.

The Wynn needs another 24-hour place that is open when it is crowded. One would think that Mr Wynn would have thought of that. Also a place with table service should be an option.

Went here for breakfast to-go one morning and the place was bustling. They have a really good steel cut oatmeal for $5.95. It's expensive for oatmeal but considering the amount they give you (enough to feed two), it's a pretty good value. You get your choice of dried fruits and brown sugar. It was really filling, too. The oatmeal was just the way I like it, not too thick to the point of being gummy and not too soupy to the point of looking like it came from Quaker Instant. They also have expensive Forte teas here. I love Forte tea and they're a quality brand, but paying more than $3.00 for hot water and a tea bag that I have to fish out myself after 4 minutes makes my pocketbook wince. For these two items, I paid $10.00. If I'm ever back at the Wynn, I would come back for that oatmeal.

The tiramisu comes in a plastic jar and is pretty good. It's sorta pricey at $8, but it was a much better value than the boba tea drink. 

The standout of the order was definitely the cookie. It's the biggest cookie I've ever ordered and at $5.99, it's a steal! It's soft, not too sweet, and still tastes fantastic and soft a week later!

My fam kept ordering the tuna croissant saying it was ""hella good"" so I'm guessing that's a favorite. The bran muffin here was the best bran muffin I've ever had. Also had the Nutella s'more. Not the best. It's alright. Wouldn't recommend it if you really want the Nutella flavor. Kinda just tastes like chocolate. 

But overall, love this cafe! Would definitely come back.

Expect to pay over $10 for a sandwich and $5 for a drink. Everything here is convenient- the sandwiches come pre-made and are warmed to order in a convection oven; the salads come pre-made as well; the soups are in a large pot; and the desserts come from the refrigerator. The only thing that is made-to-order are the drinks from coffee to tea to smoothies. There's also frozen yogurt and various baked goods (cookies, brownies, etc). This cafe is convenient (reflective of its name)- you order at the counter, get your food and then find a place to sit. 

The food is pretty good, some items better than others. I've tried the Pepperoni Pizza Pocket, the Philly Cheesesteak, the Chili, the Asian Chicken Salad, and the Fruit Tart (Not all at the same time though!). My favorite was the Fruit Tart- a delicious pastry shell filled with pastry cream and topped with a beautiful arrangement of fruit (Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pear, apple, lychee, pineapple, mango, kiwi...). It was a pretty good size for $8.

It was pretty good, but kind of made me think of baby or little kid food because the chicken was cut in little cubes and the noodles weren't macaroni, but little rings. The real winner though was the asian chicken salad which was one of the best I've had in a while.

Stopped by after lunch so my gf could get some coffee and dessert. Ordered a mocha w/ only one pump of chocolate and a chocolate tart. 
The lady behind the counter really needs to enroll in som ESL classes. She didn't just mess up my girls name.....but she messed up the alphabet...we spelled out her name and she not only got every letter wrong, but there were double the letters (even though we paid with her credit card). 
The chocolate tart was ok (gf liked it), coffee was way too sweet for her (i liked it because it tasted like hot chocolate).....looks like they used a full 3 pumps and maybe one extra....regardless of taste, it wasn't what she ordered.
No seats available, so we took it w/ us.....I recommend using the notepad from your room and writing your order out if you sense a communication problem.

Our total was around $35. Okay so it wasn't cheap considering what we got, however, the bagel was toasted and the 3 slices of salmon were pretty big, plus it came with a few caperberries and a tub of cream cheese. I was a little surprised as the salmon looked small but it was all rolled up and when you unroll them, they were big.

The salad was okay, didn't impress me much and while the ham and provolone tasted fine, the bread was cold. If it had also been toasted, that sandwich would've been awesome.

    Conveniently located down to the left of the elevator, efficient service, and decent food, nothing special.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,4,4,3,4PA5OpJWhi7qcrLOoqH1gA

I had seen it dozens of times before, but never really gave it any kind of thought or second notice...mistake! 
I wanted just a little snack to tide me over for the next few hours, and the Drugstore Cafe has a myriad of different options to cater to most patrons. I originally was going to get one of the pastries on display, but upon seeing ""Brie Mac & Cheese with Grilled Chicken"" on the menu, my mind was made up. 

YUM. 

I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty this dish was with every bite that entered my mouth. Perfect amount of cheesy goodness combined with non-smushy noodles and some tender chicken made this dish exceed my expectations; and, for just $6.95, this was actually one of the better deals in the place. 

While devouring the mac&cheese, the menu stared down on me. ""Wynn's Signature Hot Chocolate"" kept taunting me, so of course I caved. Now, this was some pretty damn good hot chocolate. However, at 7-something bucks, plus adding a shot of espresso, I was disappointed with a whopping $9 put on my credit card. Hence, the reason for 4 stars and not 5: ludicrous prices for most items. I understand that this is the Wynn, but I'm making no exception. 

As a final note, the staff on hand on this particular night were friendly and quick to help customers. Give the Drugstore Cafe a shot for a quick snack, but don't count on feeling thrifty about your spending if you order any kind of beverage.",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,1,0,4,zsGcIX4BRxunVXbWlgwJ1Q
5685017,2014-10-11,6,Do4n_yK_K6DmR9_Es5qwlA,"Despite the fact that my green tea smoothie tasted decent, I decided to rate The Cafe at Wynn two stars. First, this coffee shop is unfriendly to people who have lactose intolerance - it has neither soy milk nor almond milk. Second, the service is extremely slow. I waited for twenty minutes for my drink, which is unacceptable for a place that has a set up similar to Starbucks. Third, drinks are expensive even for hotel standard. This is not to mention that the drinks are borderline acceptable. Unless you are desperate for caffeine and are too lazy to walk outside of the hotel, I would not recommend you coming to The Cafe at Wynn.",lXG7Mbhi6_nXaTZojpneUg,7,5,2,COE9yF-1VOqoIre9r4LkeA
5693714,2011-06-05,2,Do4n_yK_K6DmR9_Es5qwlA,"From the look of this cafe, I wasn't fond of it.  It's kinda like Corner Bakery, where you just go up and pay for your food first and pick up your order and seat yourself. I'm pretty closed minded so nothing stood out to me especially because they served deli food at a whopping price. Threw me off a little. or maybe alot.
I don't even know how I ended up here, i think my girlfriends and I were all hungry so we got desperate and  wanted something quick.

We ordered the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich. None of us really liked it. it fell apart too so it was kinda hard to eat. However, you can really taste the Portobello. You can tell its some legit stuff, but eh, not my type of sandwich. Next!

We also got the Chinese Chicken Salad. in the display, it seriously did NOT look appealing at all, didn't seem filling or anything for $10. I was almost convinced that this would be the worst salad I'm about to have. Dude, after one bite, I was amazed on how good this salad was! It was super filling and we even split it between 3 people. 
The dressing is very unique. How is it different from all the other Chinese chicken salads?  The dressing itself is thick and creamy, kinda looks like thousand island but it is so good. I never had such a bomb salad before. and most places would use Sesame light oil for their dressing. This place is generous with their portions too, lots of chicken and wonton chips! they even gave me extra dressing and wonton chips with out having me to ask because the waitress knew I was going to share. so that was a plus, cant complain about that! I even have a friend who HATES salad and this salad probably changed her perspective. 

I had the Tuna croissant here before too and it is the best tuna croissant. No exaggeration. My friend and I fell in love. The tuna was so good and i don't know what cheese they use but whatever it is, it's freaking good. I love coming here whenever I stay at the Wynn. Oh! and its 24 hour so newcomers are always welcomed =]",5M1Kjx4seOmwODw4XZFTPg,2,2,4,nS1EbaHxFU_TlUZ1mfEmHQ

I think wynn purposely overprices everything in their hotel to try to be the ""best hotel"" on the strip. No way homie, I'd rather go to ti",mH17XhHw7LK0RXe6fhJi8Q,1,1,2,7BNOMbzys3QqqB5bvLNqrg

Their other pastries are good too. I am a big fan of the chocolate croissant. My boyfriend is obsessed with the tomato bisque. Since this place is open 24 hours, we had it after clubbing and the soup came with grilled cheese sticks. i wish the cheese sticks were hot but dipping them in the soup made them 10 times better! 

I just discovered they have Pressed Juicery juices here! At $10 a bottle, it is pretty expensive, but if you want to feel a single bit of healthy after drinking for 3 days straight, it might be for you.",n19tYG7tHbX6rHhAjJ8PPA,0,0,4,JNg8pSUvIGM9hL9Tkx7euw

5777402,2012-04-29,1,Do4n_yK_K6DmR9_Es5qwlA,"this place saved my ass many times.  i don't know how many times i had to stumble into this cafe in the wee hours of the morning to get my snack on.

since i'm a creature of habit, i usually get the brie mac and cheese w/ chicken, or salmon bagel with cream cheese or the chicken sandwich.  all excellent choices. especially when drunk... i recommend them all. 

yes, since it's located inside the WYNN, it will cost more than the regular cafe.  but if you're staying at the wynn, then don't be bitching about the price.  if you are, walk over to circus circus, which would gladly accept you into their poorly kept manors.  lol.

i believe this place is open 24/7, and there's also a gift shop next door if you want to buy more booze or other drinks.

they have limited seating, but its best to bring the food back up into your hotel room and eat there.",PhmMWBBQda24K9z6b9R-sA,1,2,4,RI2ucLondiayyI30J6oKMA

It was less than 2 weeks until I'd go back to Jakarta and break the news to my relatively conservative social figure of an Asian Dad that I was ready to plan a wedding - to this ""poor fresh-out-of-college American boy"" he never met. We weren't drunk.

I was suddenly famished.

When you're staying at the Wynn, there aren't too many options for casual dining at that time of night on a weekday (besides room service). We decided to venture downstairs to look for food. and the first thing we found was The Cafe at the Drugstore.

We bought lattes, a tortilla soup, and a forgettable pastry. The tortilla soup was (the only thing that was) pretty good, the lattes weak, and the pastry meh. Overall, with standards adjusted for late-night dining, it was A-OK.

If we ever get hungry again in the middle of the night while staying at the Wynn, we'll probably stick to room service.",BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg,5,5,3,jM-PJfjeyWu1ToIJ4MzCzw

The girl working there was very friendly and let me try several flavors. I ended up with the strawberry balsamic with pepper and mango french vanilla custard. It was $6.70 and the scoops very generous.

Both flavors tasted ok and I wouldn't go out of my way to get the ice cream here but if you have credit to burn, this is a good spot to use it.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,2,1,3,vEd2-kl2BpJxc53UDsh_Gw
