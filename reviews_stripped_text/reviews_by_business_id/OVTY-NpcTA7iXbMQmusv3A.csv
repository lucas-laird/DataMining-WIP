They have a large beer selection, including a sampler and different seasonal brews.  They have a large menu with the usual apps (wings, southwest eggrolls), pastas, burgers, salads, and pizza.  My husband and I come here for their deep dish pizza- the crust is buttery and cooked to perfection.  Their traditional cheese is delicious and topped with chunks of tomatoes, and they have great specialty pizzas like bbq chicken or spinach and artichoke.  Dessert here is also the bomb- deep dish baked to order cookies called pizookies, available in different flavors and topped with ice cream (my fav is the oreo).",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,EAmKFlOSZXL82bKlzfQHyg

This review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us.
We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready. 
They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?",1prJgTrk4kH85h6mvDTL3A,0,0,4,lnH2rAIxq5hra7DGjw3GoQ

Your choice of soup and a house or Caesar salad (unlimited refills). For some reason I thought I had to order only one type of salad and soup.  When the waiter came back and asked if I would like another soup/salad I didn't realize I could order a Clam Chowder, Chilli or Minestrone Soup.  It was fantastic!

They also have snacks and small bites starting at $2.95 so you can have a variety.  

Desserts?  Pizookie's to die for!!!

You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Your choice of Chocolate Chunk, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut.

369867,2012-03-25,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"Bj""s  is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with.  Some of the items, I just love some are not so great in my opinion.  First things first parking can be a hassle at times, and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend.  I like the atmosphere and decor very much.  The wait staff is pleasant enough, yet often make mistakes with our orders.  In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there.

Now, the food.  They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top.  My son and I love the Tomato Soup, truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons.  I usually start to get full with just my soup.  On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo, she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry.  I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch!  My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion, or their ribs both are very tasty.  I waiver between their New york strip, which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu.  I personally am not impressed with their pasta  dishes, find them a bit tasteless.  Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great.....

I can't ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert.  My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky, I'm sure I've
misspelled that....l.o.l. yet  a sinful and  necessary experience!  Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00  for the three of us.  Bj's is always a family favorite, with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too.

Bottom line is, if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to, always seems to be Bj's a leading contender!

Try the steaks.  I  get the New York strip usually and it's always cooked perfect (order medium usually).  HUGE PORTIONS!!  You may enter a booth, eat, then have to sleep over because your stomach has created a seal against the table that you cannot break.  

I'm not a big fan of the pizzas as I think they are too doughy.  But pizza is a thing, much like the name of this restaurant, where I've really never had a bad one.  So, you may really enjoy it.  

Also get the rootbeer.  You MAY get diabeetus after finishing off a couple of mugs, but it will be worth it.

Nice room. Will seat 100+. Someone paid attention to details here!
Great graphics on the walls, the logo's for their homebrew styled beers are excellent. Meaning they make you want to order and drink them (thats what a good logo does) http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/list.aspx Well crafted brews I will add. 7 are on tap year round with an additional 10+ specialty (seasonal) brews. ex: Pumpkin Ale, and Oktoberfest Marzen coming Oct./Nov.

It's a large menu. Listing Cocktails and Wines  throughout the Beers, Appetizers, Soups/Salads, Pizza, Burgers, Pastas, Entrees, and into the Kid's Menu. Tip: Dessert, try the PIZOOKIE®!! don't ask, just Do It!

Nice Bar too. You are welcome to eat a full menu there. But, before 7pm daily all appetizers 1/2 off (bar only) just an fyi. So I am told. I did not do this this visit. http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/beginnings.aspx (Sliders (4) Angus Beef is $7.95 w/ fries take 1/2 off before 7pm) 

Service was excellent. Food was good. Interesting variety well executed.
Big room, and it was filling to Full by 7pm, noise was very tolerable.

So if you find yourself on the westside near Red Rock Casino, BJ's is across the street. Easy parking. And they also have have ""Curbside pick up"" for To-Go ordering http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/curbside.aspx

So I asked him what it was and he apologized and then just took the food bank. Maybe he was nervous for making a mistake but he didn't even ask if I'd like something else instead.

**** Kids: The menu is great, with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99, which includes a main dish, side dish, and a drink.  The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside.

* Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed, which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and, while the flavor was okay, the pasta was terrible.  At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2,3,4 and more! Obviously, this makes for some crunchy, impossible-to-eat pasta.  How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate.

Conclusion: Unless you are just looking for a place to get a drink and watch a game, go elsewhere.  There are probably 20 other restaurants within a 2-minute walk of this place, most of which will be a better food experience.",_ELaMkFsytQSeWLUVJNkog,0,0,2,29ZA-hL7cHEfj-H294qB6w

There may be a bit of hyperbole there, but damn, I'd be hard-pressed to say that ive ever tried a better pizza and thats saying something since this is a chain.

I've been frequenting both the San Jose, Roseville and Las Vegas locations (yeah, i get around) for almost four years and finally have the sense of mind to review it.  Whats nice about this place is that no matter which location you go to, you can always expect consistency.  Great ambiance, great food and great fun are to be had at each location and you can really tell the company strives for it.
Where to start, oh yeah, PIZZA!  The pizza is amazing.  It is the deep dish style not to be confused with the stuffed type youd get at Zacharys in the yay area or Giordano's in the Chi.

The pizza is baked to perfection, has the right bit of crunch to it and is just generally good all over.  The sandwiches, beer and desserts are nothing to scoff at either.  Please try a Pizookie if you ever get the opportunity.  I'd rank it right up there with the White Molten Chocolate Cake (believe it or not) at Chili's or the Brownie Sundae at MRKT inside the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas.

I went to BJs on a Monday night when the restaurant is less than half full. I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic ""gentleman"" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor, he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check, he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table, laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check, but he refused. A large, black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit, a short, white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn't even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn't care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white, I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you.

Go there for an appetizer and then the Pizookie. If it is your first time, get the mini trio. Do not try to get an entree and then the Pizzokie or you'll be sorry.

I miss the red velvet pizookie, but I can settle for the white chocolate macadamia pizookie! Never disappoints. Who doesn't love a pizza cookie with some ice cream smothered on top? The hot and cold mixed tastes great!

She did not even greet us when we came in, and when she finally did acknowledge our presence she acted like we were annoying her.  After a few minutes she told us it was going to be a few more minutes. After a little time passed she came back and got menus and silverware, and started walk to seat us. She then turned around and told us NO!! Not yet. When she came back she started texting on her phone. A few more minutes went by and she stated asking us some question about if we were loyalty members or not, etc...  Then she didn't say anything for a few minutes. Very awkward silence. Then she told me to go and stand next to the stairs. Usually a host person would tell you it will be a few more minutes, not go stand next to the stairs. Keep in mind that this is 2:30 pm in the. Afternoon when thee are only about 20 people in a restaurant that can easily hold 200, and we are the only people waiting to be seated in a basically empty restaurant.How rude!!! She then walked by me and didn't say anything like I am suppose to be a mind reader and know that I am suppose that I follow her now. I get to the table, and proceeds to throw the menus and silverware on the table and walks away without saying anything.  When our waiter comes, he introduces him self and then proceeds to sit down next to us in the booth, like a long lost friend. Maybe he was really tired. He tells us the specials and gives us a few minutes to decide. When our waiter comes back, he again proceeds to sit down right next to us and take our order. We go ahead and order, and when our food comes 30 minutes later, a different person brings it out to us. They place it on our table and walk away, not a single word comes out of their mouth during this entire process. Not once during our entire meal did the server refill our drinks.

I like this location since its across the street from Red Rock Casino and in the Summerlin neighborhood. 

Huge menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, steaks, specialty entrees, etc.. I can go on and on. The menu is seriously like a book!  I am the type that if there is a lot to choose from, I tend to get overwhelmed and indecisive! Hmm what does Miriam feel in the mood for today. 

I have tried many different entrees during the years and majority of the appetizers, and there is not an item that I did not like. All very tasty. I was craving MEAT recently, and I ordered their new ""Black & Bleu burger"" and my friend got the ""Crispy Jalapeno burger.""  The angus patty was SO JUICY! It hit the spot. 

A MUST order is BJ's Famous PIZOOKIE. Pure DELICIOUSNESS.

First off our server forgot to give us straws with our water, but when he brought water to an older couple next to us he did not forget to give them straws or a cup of water filled with new ice. Our water looked like it's been sitting out for a while because the ice was almost melted.

 & when they brought out our clam chowder they forgot to bring out crackers with it & it took forever to flag someone down for it.

Did I mention it was my boyfriend's birthday? It was a nice that they brought out a dessert for him, but they brought it out when I was in the bathroom. I mean, couldn't you wait a little bit until I came back out? He was sitting by himself with the damn dessert & a lit candle on it! (he didn't want to blow it out until I came back.)

Lastly, I usually get the jambalaya because it's one of the best I've had but today I tried the grilled chicken pasta & to my disappointment, it was totally bland.

I understand my boyfriend & I are young but that's no excuse to give us poor service. We still left the waiter 20%, undeservingly.

I wish I had taken a picture of the fish tacos I ordered. 

They were really vegetable tacos.  
I had to dig deep to find the insignificant piece of fish at the bottom. 

It was the smallest portion of fish I've 
EVER had in a fish taco. 
To add to that.... 
it was the least inventive boring fish taco I've ever had. And I eat a lot of em on my travels.

First of all, very nice space. Cozy, yet spacious. Modern, but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect, even for my overly-impatient father!

Drinks came out quickly, my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks, and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal.

The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced!

Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs, 8 of them! Fries were yummy too!

I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food, satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side, since almost always they drench it down, but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay, but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish.

Easy five stars. I wish I was this satisfied with the value, quality of food & service, as well as the overall experience every time I dined out.",ynCrXYk70lJubrm6kcVu9Q,3,0,5,UQCkq04aOApbNgOFON3I7g

Because Feast Buffet at the tony and electric Red Rock Resort & Casino had a line out the door, I went to one of my reliable favorites. But in beautiful Summerlin!

Because it was a late lunch, it was not very crowded and I was seated immediately in a plush booth.

What a relief. No crowds and a restful and restorative dining area with the myriad of flat screen TV's kept at just the right volume for conversation when making new friends.

The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still, an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice.

The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato's, black olives, field greens, sweet red onion, hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette. 

Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer. Had no idea it was made in-house, but I had three frosty mugs of it plus a to-go glass.

Just a small cat here, so was not able to finish all the food and there was no refrigerator in my suite at The Palazzo. Bygones.

Going back to my second home of Summerlin/Henderson/Las Vegas about seven times a year I always put this BJ's on my food ""bucket-list"". So very Summerlin!

Have no fear about ordering here, you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you'll definitely not be disappointed. 

My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken, I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it's a substitution, I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well.

A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with ""Sorry the salad is pre-made we can't do subtractions."" BJ's just said ""okay"". That's a great first sight.

As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins. 

Let me just review all the food at once: for the price, I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great, the food was cooked well, the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins, and was a pleasant surprise for the salads.

I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good -- really good, just what I was looking for and up to my standards -- it is still a chain restaurant, and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way.

I advised we were Rewards members and she took my phone number right away to start our points earnings without delay. I love that! Sometimes I forget to scan receipts later to earn points. ? We we're seated within a couple minutes and greeted by our server, Josh. We started off with our drink order and kids cheese pizza. Our drinks were brought by minus an ice water. Josh brought the second ice water, after I reminded him, right away.  We ordered the Ribeye 12oz (medium rare) with two sides (Caesar salad & loaded baked potato). The Ribeye was grilled to perfection! The center was a nice juicy red and I always eat mine with a side of Worcestershire. The baked potato was fresh and soft on the inside topped with butter, real bacon, cheddar cheese and sour cream with green onions on the side. The Caesar salad came out first and had the right amount of Parmesan and croutons to romaine lettuce ratio. The creamy dressing was mixed in the salad well. All in all a great meal!  #ilovesteak My daughter had the kids: mini deep dish cheese pizza which was light and fluffy and she ate almost all of it! #accomplishment  

After dinner we of course ordered their famous Pizookie's for dessert. If you don't know, now you know.  A pizookie is a nice warm cookie fresh out of the oven in its own personal round pan topped with glorious mounds of ice cream!  Need I say more? They have several flavors and my husband actually tried a new one. It was Monkey Bread (dough baked with butter, cinnamon and sugar) topped with vanilla ice cream. AMAZING! I had my usual chocolate chunk cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. If you go on your birthday you get a pizookie Free! The prices are great here and I would say in the medium range. For example his burger was $13 and my steak was $23. They have one of the biggest menus I've ever seen. I asked a server once and they told me three guys who used to be with Cheesecake Factory opened up BJ's Brewhouse and that's why the menus compare with lots of variety. Our service and food were both great tonight. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the wood flooring surrounding the hosts desk which leads to restrooms was so oily or greasy I almost fell. Also when I went inside the women's restroom there were paper towels all over the sink, floors by trash cans and inside the bathroom stall. There was also lots of toilet paper on the floor.

1939051,2014-04-09,4,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"I have two words for you: pi-zookie

In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .


All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key.

Anyhow my sis and I were staying at Red Rock and wanted something other than a buffet/fastfood/$$$restaurant so we decided to come here. The food is pretty much the same across the board which is great because I hate inconsistency when it comes to chain restaurants. This restaurant has PHENOMENAL service. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and our server [whose name I'm unsure of] was AMAZING. She was attentive, sweet, and just a great server. We ended up getting a pitcher of beer, artichoke dip/bruschetta, nachos, and a parmesan crusted chicken entree all for under $60! 

Note: On the check it said our server was Cinnamon. Not sure if that's a birth-given name or a nickname... Cinnamon was the shit!",rGtYFE9uliZOLefeCsM12Q,0,0,5,DoUAL_yBOxvlLYCkgg6_9g

Our waiter was great and had a lot of fun with our group. The food came out fast and was delicious. We had calamari and spinach dip for our appetizers and both was seasoned well. I had the double pork chop, Brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes. The pork chop was huge so I split it and took some home. The chop was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just honey Dijon.

You're even allowed to add up to 8-9 toppings to a happy hour personal pizza ($6-ish) or pick a specialty pizza to represent your pick. What a deal!

Super attentive service. Makes you want to invest in a franchise, but all of these are corporate-owned, just like Panda Express is. That must the secret to consistency and stellar, no-excuses service! Our drinks (iced tea, beer and more beer) were never down to a 1/3rd of a glass. :)

It's no wonder this is many people's ""favorite restaurant"" when asked to state one. I certainly wouldn't want to be the Olive Garden next door (which does well, too) or any other establishment sharing the same parking lot.

If you haven't tried BJ's in a long time, go. Certainly go instead of to Grimaldi's or to the Cheesecake Factory or even to Dom DeMarco's pizzeria for that matter.

Ordered the AYCE soup and salad for 6.95. what a fantasic deal. There was choice of broccoli and cheese, clam chowder, tortilla soup and chicken noodle. 

Brocoli and cheese is the cheesiest soup i""ve ever had, hands down. no joke. order it and youll see what i mean. The tortilla soup they do in this weird way but it works. They bring the chicken, and stuff in the soup bowl but with no sauce. they then at your table pour the sauce onto the dish which leaves the torilla chips in it super crunchy. its delicious. also, its a nice touch that they add avocado and a lime inside for a bit of a kick. The caesar salad is okay, nothing special. Its yummy but i ordered only one. Of the soups i ordered then both again. 

For our daughter we order chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was actually a great portion. three large golden crispy tenders that came with two dipping sauces. ranch and honey mustard. the honey mustard was delious but the waitress said its bottled. FYI she says the only sauce they make fresh themselves is the vinegarette. The fries were pretty good. They are super thin but it just meant they got cold uber fast. no bueno. My daughter really liked them.

The service was impeccable. Our waitress was named Brittney and she was one of the best waitesses Ive ever had. She made light conversation saying she had a one year old as well.

The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip, among other things, and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great.

When they did, she grabbed the pepper shaker to give to another server, did not say hello or even acknowledge us. Turns out, she was our server. 
When she came to get our drink order another 5 minutes later, we had so much time with the menu we asked if we could put in our order. All simple food, tacos, wings, soup & salad.  A salad was served at our table, way before our drinks. We then waited 22 minutes for our food. Yes, I timed it because everything else was taking so long. Finally our food came except for the bowl of soup. Refills were done before the soup was delivered to the table. While waiting I noticed plenty of servers at the hostess stand having free time, talking, singing and joking around. By the time my soup arrived, one of my friends had already finished her meal, and a second person was almost done. 
We were there over an hour and a half. No apologies for slow service, it was as though it was the norm. I also don't appreciate servers using pet names (baby, honey, love) when taking your order or serving your food and drink.

If you've never been before, or you get lost in the large menu, I'd recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes (artichoke hearts) or the Avocado Egg Rolls for a starter.  Moving on to main course choices, try the Bacon Cheese Burger, New Orlean's Jambalaya, or one of the Tavern Cut Pizzas.  The Spicy Pig or Garlic Chicken Pesto are both favorites.  If you're in the mood for salad as a main course, definitely check out the Kale & Roasted Brussel Sprouts Salad.  There is also a good assortment of dessert options for anyone who is still hungry after the meal.  Finally, there's a gluten-free menu for those who want or need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.

In the larger restaurants in the chain, the noise level is slightly above average, and has even been noisy at times, but it's never been too loud.

As I mentioned, BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from.  They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well, so you're not bound to their own brews.  By the way, the in-house root beer is delicious.  Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits.

BJ's offers healthy size portions (often enough to keep me in left overs for a day or two at our family condo.) I highly recommend any of the specialty salads or the stuffed baked potatoes, which are a meal in themselves.

If you are up for some beer - the 7 beer sampler fits the bill to start. I would recommend the Tatonka Stout if you like dark beer. BJ's also offers some hard ciders and regular mixed drinks.

Watch for BJ's happy hour - most mini pizzas and appetizers are 1/2 price later in the evening in the bar. 

BJ's is great for kids and offers several kid's selections (that are adult size meals.) Most come with an included drink - my son always gets the handcrafted root beer, which is a lot better than the other soft drinks.

Has your stomach been telling you that you want pasta? Well look no further as BJ's has essentially a little bit of everything. I've been to BJ's countless times and not once have I ever been disappointed with my food or service, so a review for them is long overdue. I was here a few days ago on a Wednesday night and they were packed, so you know this place has to be good. Luckily my sister and I were seated just in time before there was a wait. Even though the place packed our server consistently checked up on us and always made sure our water was filled. Their selection and variety of appetizers, entrees, sides, and mini-appetizers are plentiful. You are bound to find something on the menu that'll interest you or satisfy your craving.

Our order consisted of:

An order of the calamari
An order of the Caesar's salad
An order of the fish n' chips
An order of a small deep dish pizza
And you always have to make room for dessert especially their pizookie, which is basically a pizza-cookie topped with Vanilla ice cream. Can't decide on a specific flavor? You have the option to split the pizookie in half. My sister got the chocolate chip while I got the cookies n' cream.

For a place I've been to countless times and have always been satisfied with my food and service, BJ definitely deserves that 5 stars.

2944621,2010-11-19,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times, and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas, pastas, tacos, and desserts from their that I've lost count, but I will showcase some of their highlights. 

I usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions, so I'm full by those alone, but I've gotten their chicken tenders before, and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard, so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries, not gross ketchup.

Their pizza is great. If there is a long wait, and you have to sit in the waiting area, the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait, but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe. 

I usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni, stringy cheese, and hearty tomato sauce. Normally, I hate tomato sauce on pizza, seriously, the less sauce the better, but with BJ's pizza, their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better, but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go, I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm...

The sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon, cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great, but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy, and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink.

So... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off, get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously, you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it, and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert. 

So yeah... this was a really long review, but I've been here so many times, and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon.",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,1,1,5,PM-wrPs592ue3ybuFABv1w

I love in Utah, one of the most alcohol repressed states in the country (although getting way better) and I told everyone how good it was who asked me where to go in Las Vegas. They have a new Tatonka Stout. It's good but not as good. 
Our server Woody was excellent. Great personality and he really interacted well with us and the customers he waited on. 
Today's feast started with the BJ's HopStorm IPA and an appetizer of BJ's Brewhouse blond beer battered asparagus.  The IPA was good with a light hoppy flavor.  The asparagus stalks were too wide and over cooked. I won't order that again. The country fried chicken was very good and the mashed potatoes was the best I have had. I don't know what they did to the potatoes but it worked well with the chicken.

I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e, Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places. 

There have a been a few issues - one time, despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time, my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time, a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times, however, the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order, the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked, it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day, they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant, so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts), but the take-out order staff is super friendly, accomodating, and easy to deal with. 

The food is pretty good. It's not fancy, gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e, Applebee's, Chili's).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent, and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips, but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well. (But am still looking!) 

I'd definitely recommend this place and think it has 5-star potential (but need to eat in to find out).",KRGpbpX7nq4JctJirefzCA,0,0,4,0tMxu8PSxNNGiEMvCxpX0Q

I absolutely love BJ's so after a doctors visit we had were hungry & unanimously chose this spot since it was also on the way home. We ordered take out & decided on 2 LARGE pizzas... when we arrived to pick up we noticed on the board that there was a family style package meal that includes 2 Large pizzas, salad, wings, & 2 sides for around $5 more than what we were already paying for the 2 pizzas we ordered & when we tried to mention it to Brianna when paying out she was just super rude about it & also had no idea about this special. "" o... I guess you can...."" in a rude tone of manner i would have to say as we pointed out what their special entails. We also had to witness her being a bit toney w/ another person that was trying to apply to the place... =/  that's my reason for the 3 star... 

The food was great though even if it was take-out... by the time we got home it was still hot & delicious. But one thing that really SUCKED was that we had asked for extra ranch on the side for the pizza & when we got home, all we see is the one ranch that came w/ the wings =[

MASHED POTATO - very smooth & rich creamy flavor... I love it when such a simple dish is made perfect. 

FRIES - crisp skinny fries Can't complain they're fries.

BUFFALO WINGS - the sauce was on the side & it came w/ a good amount of celery sticks.

2 LARGE BUFFALO CKN PIZZA - although I usually go w/ the GREAT WHITE, the Buffalo chicken pizza here is delicious... not too overwhelming & perfect texture to the crust as ALWAYS & the right amount of protein & veggie ratio for each bite! 

SANTA FE CHICKEN SALAD - refreshing salad w/ some crisp to it w/ the tortilla strips & the Santa Fe dressing was awesome.

When we arrived at BJ's for our dinner, I was surprised to find out that they don't start preparing the food until we get there.  I was a tad bit panicked because the girls had tickets to see the UCLA game, and dinner was already going to be rushed.

Not to worry. We were seated and they already had the salad out! The girls quickly pounced on that. Before they were finished, the pizza and pasta started making their way out. Perfection!

3311289,2011-06-02,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"BJ's is, and has been for over seven years, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas; and I have been to A LOT of restaurants all over town. To me, a great restaurant is one that has an enjoyable environment, great food, good service, and fair prices. BJ's definitely has all of these qualities. 

To begin, the environment is very welcoming and well-kept. The restaurant has a big city, Chicago style, feel to it and offers both bar/lounge area seating with a full bar and several flat screen TV's all around the restaurant. The dining room offers booth seating for two, four, or up to eight and tables for a small party of a couple friends or a huge party of a high school archery team, (I tried going with something other than football team, you get the point...). The lights are slightly dim to keep the mood somewhat mellow, but the TV's and music keep the restaurant upbeat--it's a good balance for a good environment. 

The food at BJ's is awesome! They offer a great selection of appetizers which are perfect to share, as well as smaller sized appetizers, ""Tiny Bites,"" which make perfect individual appetizers or sides. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza, (appetizer to share), and the gourmet mac & cheese, (individual ""tiny bite""). As far as the main entrees, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods ranging from classic burgers to Italian inspired pastas to Teriyaki Chicken to Grilled Salmon and even some Jambalaya. BJ's also has some delectable gourmet salads and wholesome soups. My favorite entrée has to be the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. 
There is a large selection of drinks offered at BJ's, from the full bar to specialty drinks, both alcoholic and non, as well as their signature hand-crafted root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry soda.   
Now for the good part--the desserts. BJ's is known for their pizookies. Pizookies are cookies, baked in a pizza pan, served hot out of the oven with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have the classic Chocolate Chip pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top as well as quite a few other flavors such as Triple Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and, newly added, Red Velvet. There's also an Oatmeal Raisin pizookie for those of you who like to feel like you're eating healthy even while having dessert. BJ's also offers beignets and an ice cream sundae as well as a couple other dessert items. 

Almost every time I have been to BJ's, the staff has been very friendly. Only a couple times have I ever had an issue with a server or host. If my order is ever made incorrectly, which rarely happens, the server will gladly take it back and bring me the correct order as well as give me some sort of compensation, such as a discount or free dessert. 
The prices are really good for a restaurant such as this one. They have lunch specials during the week which are only about 6-8 dollars. As far as the prices on the regular menu, most of the items range anywhere from 10 to 18 dollars with a few exceptions being slightly 
higher or lower. 

In all, BJ's is a great place to have a quick lunch, to go on a date, or to take the family out for dinner. It is very unlikely that you will be disappointed with this restaurant, (unless, of course, you are a complete restaurant snob who will complain about the most insignificant things), and I do hope that you give BJ's a visit in the near future.",RxOFmw_i8O3kF4bTdjIAug,2,2,5,uVhyIUB_uYt-j8Wr8LBhZw

First, Krystle, our server, was fantastic. She knew her stuff.  As my husband was choosing his ""Pick 4"" beers (@$6.95 great deal), she could tell what kind of beers he liked and gave him some suggestions. He ended up changing two to try something new. And he was happy he did.

Because it has been a while since we've been to BJ's, asked our server what she would recommend as I wanted more of a dip. We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip, and we were happy we did.

Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs, while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However, because I'm more of a noodle person, our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle.

And of course, we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options, she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time, we'll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead.

It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it, a piping hot, moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share, but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us.

The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients, but large enough to appease any hearty appetite.

The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart, but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare, but it hit the spot.

The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers, etc. So, chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater.

My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a ""Kids Pizza"" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good!

The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95, I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different.

I'm really tempted to try the red velvet, but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated).

I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet.

It wasn't crowded.  Tracy immediately came up and offered me a menu and asked about drinks.  I wasn't familiar with any of their beers so I got a few tastes and then decided.  Then I realized they had and did that.  (Thankfully before she poured the big glass... which turned out to be my favorite of the flights)

I ordered guacamole and chips and I swear it hit the bar in front of me in 6 seconds.  Thin, fresh warms chips and great guac.  I nibbled on that.  Explored the massive menu.  Worked on my beer flight and decided i was still hungry.  Ordered fried artichoke.  Again... 60 seconds and piping hot.  Amazing.

It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning.  I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day.  

The experience was great.  Tracy was fast, friend, knowledgable.  I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy.

Neat subtly communist decor in a very large restaurant. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and got right into the bar. Lots of TVs with sports, and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything.

The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is.

Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss. Always impressive in the land of the unified restaurant bill.

This visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA.

The food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.

My Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!

Overall, another awesome experience @ BJ's!

After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon, we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill, but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options, this brewpub clearly has their act together.

BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves, and I can understand why, since this place seems equally enjoyable for families, singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity.

The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider, but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees, portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream.

For the food alone, this is a three-star joint, but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough, my local sports bar has a very similar name.",j4BMT5Oyrt15-pwK3cRSZw,3,4,3,ud_GPPzzWKGpWahpa0EC7Q

There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.

I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.

As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised.

Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish.

We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun.  Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious.

4014577,2010-11-18,3,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"I really love my NY style pizza...thin, crispy crust...not too much toppings to weigh it down.  But man, BJ's Chicago style pizza gives it a run for its money!  I enjoy the pizza here and apparently a lot of other folks do too.  This place is always packed for dinner!  Very happening.  

Went here with the fam, and we had a blast.  It was great hearing the game on the TV, people congregating and laughing, plates and glasses clinking.  The atmosphere is pretty inviting, lots of dark woods and high ceilings almost reminding you of a gastropub.  BJ's has a very large menu that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, Angus burgers, sliders, giant stuffed potatoes, pasta, and even a gluten-free menu (no gluten, in a pizza joint?  Come on!  It's pizza!)...but the Chicago pizza is the star.

I pretty much perused the main menu and went straight for the heart, BJ's wonderful deep dish pizzas.  They usually have at least 8-9 different pies on the menu and of course you can make your own with any of their ingredients.  Every pizza comes with their special blend of FIVE cheeses.  Their pizza creations include - BJ's Favorite Pizza (The Works w/ meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes), Mediterranean (Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta), Sweet Pig (Pineapple, tomatoes, and roasted ham), BBQ Chicken (BBQ chicken, red onions, tomatoes, hickory BBQ sauce, and cilantro), and the Southwestern (Blackened chicken, green chiles, chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and cilantro) just to name a few.  They even have calzones, and yes...a gluten-free thin crust pizza!  I feel so sorry for you people that can't handle gluten.  No deep dish for you!

We ended up with a large BJ's Favorite pizza for all of us to share.  Just to let you know they aren't cheap, probably around $10-24 each depending on the size and type of pie you get (Mini, Small, Medium, or Large).  Mind you, these pizzas don't look large when they get to the table but they are DEEP.  It's like a good almost two inches thick!  I thought our family of four could finish the entire pie in one sitting but I was wrong!  Our pie had six large slices and we could only eat a slice each!  You definitely have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork...no folding slices in half folks!  The crust is buttery, not too heavy, and completely cooked through without being soggy.  The ingredients were fresh, and the veggies still had a light bite to them.  The sauce was tangy and sweet.  Overall a very delicious slice of pie!  Yes, like pie!  Very good pizza.

We rounded out our dinner with a few appetizers, the Crispy Calamari ($8.95) with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli, and the Garden Medley Salad ($8.95) with romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Both very tasty.

Although we were stuffed (ha ha...like pie?) our server told us we had to try BJ's Famous Pizookie ($5.95).  After rants from the kids on how we never have dessert it ended up being ordered.  Funny how they win and you don't even realize it.  This thing ended up being delicious!  Like sweet crack!  Not that I've tried crack before.  The Pizookie is a hot out of the oven, fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and served in it's own mini deep dish tin.  We got a chocolate chunk cookie, but you can also choose, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal raisin walnut.  So good!  They bake the cookie dough until it's just a smidge underdone so your cookie is still gooey on the inside.  Goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top!  Good way to go to end a calorie busting meal!  

I wanted to try one of their hand crafted micro brews but I couldn't fit it in on this trip.  I hear they also have a great happy hour M-F from 3 PM-7 PM and also on Sun-Th from 10 PM-close.  They have $1 their draft beers and cocktails, $2 off most of their appetizers, and 1/2 off all their Mini Pizzas.  I will have to go check this out on maybe a game day!  

I definitely want to go back here again soon, good food, good service, good times.  Go here, and enjoy yourself before the crazy holidays!  BJ's has made me a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza.

But here's why I recommend them and what prompted this review:
BJ's is always busy. (Use their call-ahead program where you can add your name to the wait list before you arrive.) One Friday night, we were waiting in the small reception area for a table, a wait we expected and didn't mind knowing that the food and service would be well worth it. Unfortunately, our wait began going over the initial wait time quoted to us by the hostess.  In fact, it was beginning to be significantly over and the very, very, very, very tiny waiting area was now becoming quite packed with other families and people waiting for their tables as well.

Looking over the dining room it appeared that it wasn't the servers' or restaurant's fault.  Many tables had paid checks on the table and were cleared, except for some napkins and lingering drinks.  The guests were just camping out at tables, ignoring the growing group of families with whining, hungry kids.

But the managers didn't ignore us.  In fact, two different food runners were sent out to the group of waiting people (both inside and outside the restaurant) with trays of pizza cut up in small portions for the kids to munch on while we waited. Napkins were provided and no mention of payment was ever made. 

This act was by far the kindest, most thoughtful gesture I have ever witnessed by a restaurant. As a parent, I was deeply appreciative of this simple, yet thoughtful gesture on the part of  the restaurant. As a 12-year veteran of the industry who has worked as a corporate trainer for two major national chains and is married to a chef, I was greatly impressed by the amazing attention to this matter and quick resolution. 

We had been entertaining the idea of leaving and going somewhere we didn't like as much, just to get some food in our crabby, hungry toddler's tummy. But this act on the part of BJ's staff kept us there and our money in their hands. Great job!

We were huge fans of BJ's before this event, but whenever asked about a good family restaurant, I quickly recount this story and lay on the great reviews.

Thanks, BJ's. We're fans for life!",NfnWEuEZiCL-IJmbk8b_cw,0,0,5,oA4Ix1izHM_SGEYcmqoR3A
4054654,2012-10-13,1,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"Located right across from Red Rock Casino and Resort.  Everytime I've eaten here, it's never by plan.  It's always been because either Yard House (at Red Rock) is too busy or I happen to be on that side of Charleston.  

As for the food.  Probably tried almost everything on the menu at some point.  My favorites include their Spinach Dip, Salmon, Lasagna, Pazookie, and their Great White Pizza.  If you haven't tried their Pazookie, then you must try at least once. I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip.  

My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza.  Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo.  I love it when they burn the crust a little.  Sometimes I request it. 

Service is just average, but really good during lunch.  I have to say, service is better than Yard House across the street.  

Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat.  One things for sure, getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,2,4,o3ZHHMC1FjuHUsu3xcModQ

I came for a baby shower for a friend and we had a section in the back side area, where there were other bigger parties. They had set-up a buffet table so when the food was ready we just went up and grabbed what we liked. I'm usually not a fan of potato skins but it was really good because they were crispy.

The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case!

They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS!

And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy.

The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4 stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like this past weekend, it was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.  The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait.

LOVE, LOVE BJ's!  It's one of few places that we can go to as a family and everyone is happy and content.  It's less than a mile from my house which is super awesome and I've never been disappointed!!  Yes, I know this is a chain and I am personally more a fan of the local eateries, but BJ rocks!!

They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad.  Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).   The happy face potatoes are awesome too, but they are not fans. 

They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca, but  the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second!  We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness. 

Hubby loves their fried shrimp, chicken fried steak and many of their sandwiches.  

Breakfast is good too - not what brings me back every time, but it's noteworthy.  

Come on your birthday and get a free b-day sized pizookie!! Yum!  They don't sing either which is a bonus, but their pizookies are amaaaaazing!!!  I've never seen one disappear so quickly as they do when placed in front of my kids!!",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,1,0,5,BgilwD9Q-SvGYz5s0ve5fQ

     I spoke to a girl name Brahel if I even spelled it correctly, she was very polite on the phone and took our order, so after ordering she read back what I said to her and then she gave a price and had no problem with it. 

     We went to go pick our food up and when we came home, the food we ordered wasn't there, only a portion of what we ordered was there, so I looked over my receipt and they charged me for exactly what I ordered, so I called them up stating I was missing items the girl Donna who answered the phone was very rude and said "" don't complain to me I didn't take your order "". She immediately sent me back to the ordering Department, so I was speaking with a manager. 

     The manager was polite and understanding, he said he would have someone deliver the missing items to our home. I called within 2 minutes of being home and noticing what was missing, we had to wait over an hour just to get the same wrong food....

BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family.

 I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too. 

Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a ""date night"" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed.

Management was abrasive. Food came out wrong. Cocktails were so poorly made we couldn't drink them, even though we were there to celebrate a birthday. Our server was not a redeeming quality, by any means, for the lack of quality tonight. Wouldn't be back if tonight was a deciding factor, which I suppose it could be at some point.

It was busy from the start. They started getting busy when the doors opened, my son and I were part of that early lunch herd. Our server was absolutely fantastic! The food was great! Management was present and extremely pleasant. Turns out, the sever Krystle that made us feel so welcomed and appreciated was actually the bartender. She was picking up tables to help the team out because the servers on the floor got so busy so fast. Being a server and a bartender myself, and being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I know how difficult busy lunch shifts can be. Kuddos to Krystle and the entire day crew today for really knocking it out of the park! Such a great experience! Thank you!

But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in), EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils, ingredients, sauces, sides, etc. For example, I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online, only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three, they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do, and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order, but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not, every time I go in to pick it up, they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what, but as a busy person, it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself, but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's, but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big, chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's), I pack everything (sauces, entrees, desserts, sides, etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything.

Today I went low carb and got the wings.  They came with the sauce on the side and I am a wet wing fan.  The sauce was ok....may have been franks red hot.  Bleu cheese was very thin and no celery came on the plate.  Tracy the bartender always remembers my tea order and is very friendly.,Cn-qcD1gZI7wW8hn748z0g,0,0,3,G38of1a6vJM0g5ZIH7oq7w

Our server Destiny, was great! She had great recommendations, especially with their seasonal Pumpkin Ale, which was absolutely delicious! 

For apps we enjoyed crispy wontons, with tai dipping sauce & fried artichoke fritters. Wontons definitely won that battle.

For entrees, my wife enjoyed a classic Bacon Burger, and I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was great. Its rather large, so just remember that when ordering. 

For dessert we wanted a trio of Pazookies, and received 2 of which we ordered, and 1 which was not. They corrected the situation immediately which was nice.

The one suggestion I will make is, I would love a brief description on the food after its delivered to the table by the food runners. Always nice to be reminded of what was ordered.

It was Thursday night, and this place was jammed - pretty good, considering the economy, so I figured I was in for some super food.  I wasn't blown away by the meal, and the service was sub-par.

I had a turkey burger.  I didn't want fries, so I was able to substitute steamed broccoli.  The burger was okay - not bad, but as bland as could be.  It came with Swiss and slices of avocado, lettuce and tomato.   Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either.  The broccoli, though, was inedible.  It was partially cooked, but not that crisp, delicious stuff that Chinese restaurants do so well.  This was RUBBER.  I had the waitress bring me mashed potatoes instead.  They were good, but too salty (What else is new?).  My friend had the turkey burger, too, and felt the same way about hers - Average.

Our husbands both had Parmesan-crusted chicken, and they were satisfied.  Again, nothing to rave about.

I just don't get it.  There are so many places in town that have above-average food.  They offer hefty discounts.  And they're empty.  In my humble opinion, BJs, which rarely has coupons, has a menu that's not much different from any other similar chain restaurant, and has food and service that doesn't distinguish itself in any way, has a steady stream of customers.  And judging by the Thursday night crowd, probably has lines out the door on the weekends.  I think it's kind of sad.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,1,3,QYESaAcf9CVfLtqLKOMuwA
4491375,2010-07-31,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,Bj's is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour 3pm-7pm (I think). Their Garlic Kettle Parmesan chips on the small bites menu is one of the regular items I like to order. It's a good size portion that can easily feed three people. It comes with caramelized onion dip and a buffalo sour cream. I prefer the caramelized onion dip because it doesn't take away from  the flavor of the chips. Their mini deep dish pizzas are delicious and cheap during happy hour. Their appetizer portions are enough to make you so full that sometimes you don't have room for their Pizookie! I also found out that they can make the Pizookie into a half ..half order. It's helpful when you share this with someone who is the complete opposite of you because they can customize it to your liking. I find eating here during happy hour is sometimes cheaper than eating fast food and it's more filling.,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,4,MRrU2I2LYZk2e_3_2x5I-g

4547869,2018-05-17,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,Overall a great place. Good service and it's fast. The food is good and I've never had a problem with it. Wife orders easy because she's more vegetarian or omni. Only reason I give it three stars is because it's difficult to order as a vegan. You have to take a regular menu item and modify it to where it's not even close to what it was. No vegan cheese for pizza. Marinara sauce and veggies is all you can get. Salads have no option for a no meat topping like tofu or chikn. . So you pay $15 for a chicken salad with dressing. Then you ask for no chicken and balsamic and oil. The cost is the same. So lettuce for $15.  Think the only thing you can order straight off the menu is soup and maybe the portabella salad.  Good place though. Used to it being hard to eat out. Just wish they'd make a page in the menu to make it easier on the waitstaff and the customer who's vegan.,0Jh-fguxui34YLu1mwpJow,0,1,3,U0wqjMBG37cdDfgZ4gZIEA

I generally don't go to places like BJ's because everything is so full of fat, lard, fried you-name-it and portions are always large. I realize I am not their target demo here, but still was happy to come here for lunch to splurge a bit.

The server gets a Star for the various things I threw at him: Changing which Fries I wanted after already placing the order; Side of jalapenos; and the biggie---- having my California Burger delivered deconstructed so that I could pick and choose what I wanted.  He went one step further and put the cheese on the bread, and had the bread completely separate from my burger. This was a great way to enjoy the burger. The burger itself seemed a smallish 1/2 LB and very thin. Consequently, not terribly juicy --- but not bad.

The in-house Root Beer was good and refills came without request.

The desserts looked good and others seemed to like them. I did taste the Grilled Salmon which seemed pretty healthy and tasted fine but nothing too exciting. Steak Fries are well-seasoned and a nice change of pace. I glanced at their 'Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza'. Optimistic thinking, I'd say.

4655316,2016-02-23,11,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"The neat thing about hiking is that after burning all those calories, there is the guilty free post-hike meal. After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll, I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ's. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159.

  At 11:20 am, the parking lot, which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign. 

  Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. ""Humm,"" I thought to myself, ""what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?"" 

   After the waitress handed us our menus, it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeño burger. After a 4.5 mile hike, there was no guilt chowing down this 1,350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us, and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table, the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery, I went for a Pepsi. 

  The crispy jalapeño burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeño burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges. 

   BJ's was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience, I will Yelp out that BJ's serves good food but needs improvement in service.

The service was great. Our server seemed to know how to pace themselves well in checking up on people and walking by to see if you need more drinks.

I'm in vegas on vacation (here for a month)  and this  visit to BJ's was  an  EPIC FAIL!!!  
My party consisted of two, we were seated, I ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious and hot upon arrival, however  my food arrived cold and I told my server 3 times that I have allergies (I carry an Epipen). 
I ordered the turkey burger with NO Avocado, NO Tomatoes and NO Cranberries and my friend ordered  a different burger.  My order came with EXTRA Cranberries, Cold french fries and my friends burger was cold along with Cold french fries as well, When we flagged down the server,  and told him about our order, he offered to take it back to the kitchen but due to fear and bad experiences with the food being returned we declined and LEFT!  
The server didn't offer any type of discount or condolences for our loss of appetite and acted as if his mind was on other things, possibly day dreaming of another job etc.   So a waste of $40 and we ended up going somewhere else for Lunch AGAIN as replacement for the food purchased at BJ's.  THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!   

Management needs to take these complaints seriously, if this keeps up this restaurant will have to be shut down for good for lack of business!!",5e_-sOcUECcj7kf_3SfbnQ,1,0,1,ulGlKG8G9ugkVP6dTrCroQ

Ordered the Potato Skins for the app. Since when do you deep fry potato skins? These were deep fried with no cheese, bacon or green onion. Just plain with sour cream sauce. Blah, gross!

Next up came the meal. The BF ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich with coleslaw. It was so bad he could not even choke it down. Usually he can eat anything, so this had to be bad. He said it was the worst tasting sandwich he had ever had. Mine was the Angel Hair Pasta that I have ordered several times here and it is usually good. The chef didn't drain the noodles so the bottom of the bowl was full of water, there was no sauce at all, just a few canned tomatoes and trust me, all I could taste was the metal from the can and a half of teaspoon of feta. This went back immediately. They brought me a bowl of their famous clam chowder to replace the pasta. Hahahah-- famous clam chowder?? You have got to be kidding me.

5391799,2011-10-06,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"I never thought I'd see myself reviewing conglomerate type restaurant like BJ's.  However my most recent experience inspired me to take a few minutes to spread the gospel on some great things that most people are probably missing out on.

First off their fish & chips have the most uniquely delicious batters I have ever encountered.  I don't know how they do it, but the batter is flavorful, crispy and surprisingly flaky.  It absorbs the malt vinegar or lemon juice while still maintaining its crunchiness.  Every other beer batter I've tried, the vinegar or lemon juice just glides right off and makes the batter soggy.  They've learned how to break the laws of physics with this magical beer batter.

Second notable item offered at BJ's is their Irish Root Beer, which is their micro-brew root beer mixed with Jameson, Butterscotch Schnapps, and Bailey's.  The drink comes out frothy, messy, and overflowing like a great root beer float.  If you've never tried it before, you don't know what to expect when you taste it.  The best way to describe this flavor of this drink is with words from that guy in that Daffy Duck cartoon.  BJ's Irish Root Beer is... ""Amazing! Marvelous! Stupendous! Colossal! Tremendous! Gigantic! Astounding! Unbelievable! Spectacular! Phenomenal! And it's good, too.""",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,2,2,4,V4pCx9SBsUSAjnejRThgwg

We got a couple of appetizers, a flatbread pizza, which had fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet tomato sauce. Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good.

For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon!

Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly ""old"" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.

Came here for dinner and can't really go wrong here. Had a beer sampler and they had a 25 dollar special for 2 so my fiancé and I had it. It included either a soup or salad and a medium deep dish pizza along with their famous pizookie. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful.

5667387,2014-02-17,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"So this is my new favorite chain restaurant since Yard House has been going downhill with the service and consistency. 

With that said, it isn't perfect. We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long, the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane, for that whole area of restaurants there, especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway, let's move on to the good shall we?

The pizza - I think it is delicious, and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza, it is more of a deep dish, which I am usually not a fan of, but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom, balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu, but alas, the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too, so that is what we often get. 

The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly, I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered, which probably says something, but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza.

Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two, they are really that good.

We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals, so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad, pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, generally busy and somewhat loud, lots of TV's going, etc., but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,1,4,v5QMQwkt3h8kfHXJHo0UTg

We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks, to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them.  He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'.  We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order. 

The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table, presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy, but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon, so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again,my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok, he may have TOLD him to :-))

I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it, after all of this, no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage, idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly. 

Having said all that, we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good, the mac and cheese was excellent, the chopped salad was great and huge, and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it.

I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is.

We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe. 

As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot.

Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!!

This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful.

Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around, sees that we have not been served  our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food.

My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way.

Nora, our waitress, was no where to be found, so we asked another server to get the manager.  Nora finally came over and went to get her manager.

William M, one of the managers, came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost.

Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either. 

I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.

The ribeye with horseradish mash and red wine mushroom sauce was fantastic! Servers name was Carrie. She was absolutely perfect. Quick, on the spot, got the orders right and didn't hover. Great night out with my wife!!!",N6EEjh_LOfmXDh-I13NKbQ,0,0,5,ZSBAjEfNq3MkI1fXJ0cRlw

There is a large selection of food on the menu... anything from seafood, steak, to vegetarian items. There is rarely ever a long wait even when it is busy and everything comes out fresh. No matter where I may be traveling in the nation, this restaurant is always reliable with great service and food when I am unsure of where to go. Never had a bad experience here, great service.",BlzKK3qINrANOC1KlzYQRA,0,0,4,oz--cNRIbaN-yaVoOLvb6g

5996436,2014-07-01,0,OVTY-NpcTA7iXbMQmusv3A,"Ate here for dinner today and for some reason it was super busy. I really love this restaurant and have been coming here for a long time. I love the ambiance and the food is great. I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer. 

Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before. 

We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things. 

Overall, I still love this restaurant, but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,3,5lSNqQG6HQ184mPbcxWtfw
