We order the exact same thing each time we go, pretty much. My hubby gets the pork chop with broken rice and fried egg. I get Pho Tai or Bun Thit Nuong. 

I love the decor inside and it is way better than the other location which is dated with ripped seats at several of their booths. It is clean, modern, new, with high ceilings. Service seemed off (very to the point and quick) which is normal for most Asian restaurants, but we usually get a slightly better vibe from the waiters at the other restaurant. 

On to the food-hubby's pork chop was served not on a plate, but on a half plate/half bowl. It has ridges on the edge going around it. I am not trying to be super picky but if you are Filipino you eat with a fork and spoon, and the ridges make it really hard to scoop up your food on to your spoon. My hubby was having a hard time with this fancier plate. We don't need the fancy, we would be perfectly happy with the regular plain dishes. 

My bun had a hair in it, which was not mine. I was disgusted and never came back. Makes me sad because this is truly my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. I know hairs happen, but it just grosses me out when it's my first time eating there and I find a hair. 

I also got pho to go one time since then giving them one more chance and the pho tasted off. Broth was flavorless. For now, I am going to stick to their original location. I hope to give them another shot one day at this location.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,3,0,3,0XbEZDbaBFnRbVjMsdGd8w

The place had just opened and already people were walking in the door and pulling into the parking lot. Good sign. We ordered wings, spring rolls with shrimp, and a combination Pho. The spring rolls came with two large pieces cut in half. Stuffed to the brim with a plentiful amount of wonderful peanut sauce. (Wish I could make this stuff at home) It also had some mint? Which really gave it a nice kick. 

The pho came out next. It was a good sized bowl piled high with ingredients. It had the usual accompaniments; basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapeno. It was a piping hot bowl of soup. Thank god, as sometimes they are not hot after all the ingredients are added. it was great. Only complaint: the broth just wasn't quite rich enough. It felt like it was missing a little flavor. Obviously, still very good as it was finished and licked clean. 

Lastly, came the wings. OMG. They were incredibly hot, covered in pressed garlic, and so wonderfully crispy. The aroma really captured us. They were so so so so so good. I had a little spicy chili sauce and hoison on the side for dipping. They were drizzled in butter. So stinking good. Worth every penny. Better than most wing places could have done. Easily.

In about 10 minutes, the large bowl of curry chicken soup with noodles was brought to the table.  The broth was rich and very enjoyable.  I added bean sprouts, Thai basil, and all of the jalapeño slices (I wish there had been more because this adds so much to the soup.

I do have to say that when you order double noodles they definitely give you a good portion of noodles. The beef was tough to eat...it was like trying to chew through some dinosaur skin. On the plus side, the beef was plentiful but just tough to eat. I normally like pho but I couldn't even eat half of it. Now the egg rolls were just ok. I probably wouldn't order them again from there. My husband asked if there were potatoes inside of it because of the texture but I am pretty sure there wasn't.

The rice with pork chopped had alot of fat then I am used to but there were two which made up for it.  Instead of the traditional steamed egg loaf they changed it up with an over easy egg which made it kinda of like a loco moco. 

As for the beef stew it was a little salty and no baguette to complement the dish.

Too many difference in the dishes.  I guess if the name of fusion was on their retail front I wouldn't had all these expectations.

For the noodle soup, I usually get beef ball and rare steak. The soup is flavorful and the surface isn't coated with oil like all the other pho place I go. Also, when you let the soup sit, you don't see that usual separation of powders and liquids. So the soup is top-notch!
For the rice dishes, I prefer the pork chops, it's a little extra work, but the meat is very juicy! It's always beautifully present with rice, sauce, veggies, a side of soup and an optional fried egg.

The spring rolls (fresh, not fried) were very good!  They had that crisp freshness like someone just picked the herbs and rolled that puppy up in the kitchen, just for you!

High FIVE for never a sticky table, utensils are sparkling clean, never any water residue on any any of the plates and bowls. I've had times where at different Pho places, I've had to use lemon on my utensils before I used it.

Clean floors and clean bathrooms. 

The owner Eric is way cool! He always offers us the remote control for the TV in case we wanna change the channel or put the volume up. Lol So Nice! We didn't wanna inconvenience anyone by changing anything tho. Good lookin out Eric! 

Let's get down to the food. I feel like the portions are a little bigger than he other Pho Annie. That's a plus! They want you to leave fulfilled. The soup for the Pho is good as it is without any alterations of any sriracha or hoisen sauce.. You know what that means?!? That soup is on point! YEE! I forget what rice plate # I eat here but its the one with the pork chop and the 2 eggs over rice. MAN! I love it! Even my kids always ask me for mine when they order soup! Our server Ken is always nice when we're there. Always polite and checks on us all the time in case we need something... He is very persistent but not in a bugging way.

I have not had the pleasure of dining in but have ordered to go a couple of times. The restaurant is clean and minimally decorated. The owners are very welcoming and ordering is fast and efficient. 

Our favored dish is the Pork chop with broken rice and egg $9.99 downright comfort food. It's perfect with charred edges yet still very tender and delicious. 5/5

Grilled pork with vermicelli $8.99 well marinated pieces of pork with noodles topped with fresh cucumbers, mint, bean sprouts and peanuts with a side of egg rolls 5/5

Garlic butter chicken $9.99 was a disappointment, it was very bland. Though it was perfectly crisp, the taste just didn't come thru. It was almost like they forgot to season it, I wonder if that was the case. The garlic pieces were good but it sorely lacked salt and pepper. 2/5

Eggrolls $5.99 are always great! an order comes with 4 pieces, I can eat these for days 5/5

I have yet to try their Pho, I am waiting until this Vegas heat lets down to try Philip T's recommendation Chicken Curry Noodle soup, can't wait though!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,5,5,4,OfDHeQe46_0AcM35rub0WQ

Extremely clean restaurant and very attentive service.  The food...PERFECT!  I had Pho Tai and spring rolls, per usual.  The broth was full of flavor and when I ordered extra beef, there was actual extra beef!!!!....at other restaurants I can barely tell the difference. The spring rolls with peanut sauce were perfection! They also brought my two year old a tiny bowl with simply noodles and broth! She LOVED it!

We ordered a fried rice plate, egg rolls, pho and some noodle soup thing. It was bland was not good at all! The fried rice was basically steamed rice with over cooked egg and almost raw chicken in it. It had no flavor and while the chicken may have been cooked it didn't feel like it in my mouth and looked raw. The pho was flavorless too and needed a lot of soy sauce. Overall no good.

We never have to ask to have our water refilled, at some other joints we literally have to wave a flag to get service.

The broth is thick and hearty, and the brisket is tasty and tender.  The bun bo hue is just okay, lacks the depth of flavor of some of the other places.

Always come back. I usually eat chicken wings and beef noodle. Grilled pork are very good too. Once you eat, you will never for this restaurant.

There seems to be some inconsistency with the service though. The taller gentleman with the glasses is extremely nice and pleasant to speak with. Then there's the shorter ""tough guy"" who really has no business being in the service industry. The last time my husband and I visited, we got it to go. We were waiting to order when Tough Guy comes out from the kitchen and waves us up and says, ""Alright, whatchu guys want?"" As I start speaking, he literally waves his hand in my face and tells me, ""Stop. She was here first"" then proceeds to yell, ""Hey! C'mon!"" at some other lady (who did come before we did but a) you're the one who brought us up there, b) don't put your hand in my face). Then when it was our turn, my husband had a question about one of the dishes and Tough Guy goes, ""Don't come in here with all these questions, dude."" I'm sure he thought he was being funny but after he already put his hand in my face, I was ready to walk out but my husband is more tolerant than most and ordered anyway. We've been here many times but have always dealt with Tall Nice Guy. Tough Guy leaves a bad enough taste in my mouth that I'm not sure if we will return.",qJNulU74iMWmMqlGI7-GKg,0,0,3,XAzC8TO7Ie9cFMVZ_MfW0Q

From when we got there there was only one other diner eating which wasn't the end of the world except that the staff was sitting down doing nothing. 

When we came in a rather brusque individual told us where we could sit and then brought us menus. When he came back to deliver our waters he asked how we were doing and left before I could answer apparently not interested in the answer to the question he had just asked. Again short with the order taking and dropping the food off which did come very quick.

The pho itself was not very good. The broth was very sweet almost to the point of inedible. I decided to try and doctor it up so I could eat my meal with my friend. None of the containers on the table were labeled so guessing was the name of the game. Also the brisket I had with was overly fatty, some of the pieces just being fat.

5778511,2015-12-02,3,YYU_E5ASIuS6HHUu8Kv-Xg,"I have found the perfect pho restaurant to meet my craving during my lunch break!

It's located a mere 5 minutes from my work, which makes it perfect! This is by far one of the cleanest pho restaurants I've been to next to Side Street Pho & Grill. They have half of the restaurant divided with booths and the other half divided with tables. If you have a larger party, search for seating towards the back.

The service here is on point. They're quick, friendly, and efficient. I usually eat here right when they open (11am), but I did come here once at 12pm and the service was still up to par. They'll let you choose your seating and set you up with appropriate utensils. I love that their soup spoons have the ""hook"" so it doesn't fall into your broth/soup.

I order the rare steak or the rare steak with brisket - both are amazing. The broth here is perfection. I can't think of any other way to stress that enough. The only thing is that they don't have cilantro in their pho, but you can ask for some and they'll give you a small plate so you can add as much as your heart desires. The pricing for pho is average; ranging from $8-9 I believe.

I just love love love how their service is. I only get an hour break, so I'm in and out of here with time to spare. I'm becoming a regular here and I have no shame in that.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,4,2,5,GMxb9DSScgPwTBM-62lHEA
