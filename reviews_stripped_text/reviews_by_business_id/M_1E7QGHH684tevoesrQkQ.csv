The food gets here the driver is in a rush and drops the pizza and leaves. I check my food and it's the  WRONG order! I ordered a pepperoni and bacon pizza, with 12 chicken wings, and 3 cups of ranch. I got a chicken and jalape√±o pizza, 12 chicken tenders and 1 ranch. I called the driver to tell him and he got mad at me and said I ordered it wrong and was very adamant that it was my fault. He hangs up, calls the pizza place and calls back and says o it was my mistake keep that pizza I'll bring you another one. Ok so I'm happy and I'm waiting, a new driver comes in with the new pizza and we check it and it's correct, but then he goes I need the other one. I was like no he said to keep it, he then goes we need to take that pizza back to who it's supposed to go to. I then proceed to tell him we ate a slice from it and he gets angry calls his manager Cynthia to tell her and she calls my phone angry screaming why we kept and ate that pizza. I hung up on her and gave him back the pizza and he left angry with it. They are disgusting and have the worst service ever!",mTPGFiPXT-5_kg9cquBKZw,0,0,1,-KyxzpUWXOOIxavSKHTymw

127444,2014-04-24,0,M_1E7QGHH684tevoesrQkQ,"My office orders from them all the time. We will never order from them again though. After getting food delivered, I called and spoke to a woman to ask what the breakdown in pricing was because they did not leave a receipt showing what we ordered. She told me my total. I had to explain that I need the actual breakdown of each item. Right away she was getting very impatient with me and trying to rush yelling, ""what the problem?!"" I told her nicely that I'm just trying to understand why I'm being charged so much.

She explained that they charge .50 cents extra for each ranch and marinara and that the delivery fee is $1.00. I told her it still doesn't add up. She continued to be very rude and impatient. She said I'm adding wrong and that I'm supposed to add tax AFTER the delivery fee, which is wrong! And even if that was the right thing to do, she STILL overcharged me!

She asked again, ""what the problem? Things happen, it ok."" I told her, ""it's NOT ok and I want my money back that you overcharged me!"" I also explained that their soup was sour and that I bit into a hard inedible piece of who knows what. She argued with me and said their soup is fresh. She then yelled, ""what you want? You want credit? I give you credit next time."" I said, ""we will never be ordering from you again and I want my money back right now."" She yelled AGAIN ""what the problem?!"" I said, ""your soup was disgusting, you overcharged me and you've been very rude this whole phone conversation! Can you just refund my card?"" She claimed she couldn't. I asked to speak to a manger and she said, ""I am manager, I owner.""

She FINALLY said she'll just have the delivery driver come back to my office to get the soup and give my money back for the soup and what she overcharged me (which would only be a total of $4.96, mind you). And then she hung up on me!

She called back a few minutes later yelling, ""where the soup, you eat it?!"" I said, ""no, I have it right here."" She asked, ""what wrong with it?!"" (even though I already told her). I explained again. She asked, ""where the hard piece you say you got in your mouth?"" I said, ""I threw it away, it's right here in my trash."" She screamed, ""that was wrong of you to do!"" I said, ""it's wrong the way you run your business. Have your delivery driver come back, he can get the soup and give me my money back"" and I hung up on her this time. No one ever came back and she still charged my card the full amount!

I just think it is so ridiculous that she is an owner and she argued and questioned me for over ten minutes. People with good customer service skills believe that the customer is always right. She just lost a whole office full of customers because of this. If she was smart she would have been nice and accommodating. Then we would have been right back to ordering within the next couple days. Not a chance now!",EIEkwdQDDsUryFcJIjYfZw,0,0,1,qTAzJ-WHIs1aqkTlNQwinQ

It is the classic Vegas pit that includes pizza wings subs and Greek food. First the wings come out of you like the devil grabbed a surfboard made of sandpaper and decide to hang ten your anus for the weekend. They pass out flyers using bums and drug addicts to unassuming tourists who are unfortunate enough to find their flyer either under their hotel room door or window. So the trick is to hit and run on tourists with cheap Nasty ""food"" delivered to your door with a jacked up price. Avoid this place if you want to live. I just hope they change the name to something not Greek and take Greek food off their menu it's embarrassing to Greek food lovers everywhere.",BNvKoIQUUBqO6OOsdMuclw,1,0,1,n5GXEutlT2tkig0aHr3ueA

The pizza tasted like something you would by from the frozen section in a discount grocery store, the wings were over cooked/dry and didn't come with any sauce, and they didn't honor the Yelp coupon for a free 2 liter Coke with $30 purchase. Instead they sent a can of Pepsi... I asked about the discrepancy when the guy delivered the order and he said that's an eat24/Yelp offer and it doesn't match any promotions they have. Never mind the fact that I used the same promotion last time I was in Vegas and I did get a free 2 liter of soda... 

To make matters worse, the delivery window was 45-60 minutes, and the order took almost 2 hours.  Everyone was asleep when the food arrived. I didn't even bother waking them because the food wasn't worth waking them up for. 

Wondering if the restaurant is under new management or something, because I've been ordering from them for years and this time they really dropped the ball",jaXXff99c8YRv3Lyr3_yNA,0,0,1,vmB6VJeDgdkwp6AuJGfQhQ

My pie was hot and fresh with no bubbles, ordered the house special and it was loaded with toppings. My Girl got extra HOT, extra crispy wings with BC on the side. She was VERY happy....so I was HAPPY. Soda was cold too for those who care.

1324645,2015-08-18,2,M_1E7QGHH684tevoesrQkQ,"Wow awful food and service! If I could give this place zero stars I would! First off It took me about 15 minutes to place my order over the phone as the worker taking my order kept repeating everything back incorrectly. Then, our delivery took double the time we were quoted (keep in mind this was about 9:30 pm on a Monday night... Not exactly prime time for a place like this). As if all of this wasn't disappointing enough, awful doesn't even begin to cover the quality of the food.

Veggie pizza add pepperoni: I'm pretty sure this was a frozen pizza, the crust tasted like cardboard, the veggies were 100% canned and our pepperoni add on was about 4 pieces over the entire pizza. One of the worst pizzas I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

Garlic Bread: if possible this had even more of a cardboard consistency then the sad excuse for pizza. Based upon the taste, there wasn't garlic, nor cheese on this ""garlic bread"". On top of the garlic bread being inedible, they forgot the marinara sauce we requested. Threw it out after one bite. 

Jalape√±o poppers: tasted like they were made 4 days ago, didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce either. Beyond disappointing 

Mozzarella Sticks: since the delivery took so long they were cold and hard by the time we received them. Not only did they not come with any dipping sauce, but again they forgot the extra marinara sauce I requested. Also were thrown out after one bite. 

Potato soup: ice cold and definitely canned 

Called back to let them know they forgot all of our marinara sauce and that our food was inedible and we were offered nothing, not even an apology.  Not only was the food worse than poor but the service was despicable.  

Overall, this place is a disgrace. Huge waste of time and money. We ended up throwing everything out and ordering from Daddy's Delights. I would NEVER order anything from here EVER again. Disgusting.",vkA1X3TxQfTKMNRvCBEKOA,2,2,1,CbSlq-50T-T49g-_IOD_zA

12 piece wing, as someone else mentioned, comes with less than 12 wings- I counted 11 and one was the size of my thumb. Ranch it comes with tasted off, possibly spoiled or just a really bad discount mix.
Mozzarella sticks were mostly breading, which is sad when they're $1/stick and falling apart. The marinara dipping sauce was the tastiest part of the meal.
I knew I shouldn't have asked about their soups but the $2.50/cup of potato soup tasted like it was fresh out of the can, devoid of any seasoning whatsoever.

Main course was Greek Spaghetti, which said was served with a meat sauce and feta cheese. Now, basically I can't really imagine that is true Greek style pasta. It was basically spaghetti with a thin layer of meat sauce topped with a thin layer of cheese and then the feta came on the side. I ended up adding the feta to my salad (included) and putting a few cubes on my garlic bread that was also included. Most versions of Greek spaghetti incude olive oil and butter and feta.

Can't really say anything about the coleslaw, because it wasn't for me, but the fries and gyros were underwhelming at best. The pita could have been warmed or baked a little bit, seemed like it was just taken out of a package. Lamb was very thickly cut and very tough, but the tzatziki sauce was pretty good. Fries were thick steak fry style, pretty mushy and not very crisp, maybe that's how they make them, but they weren't very good.

They offer a $7 lunch special that includes about 5-10 options that all include a soda; chicken fingers/wings and fries, foot-long philly cheese steak (or one made with chicken!), giant greek or caesar salad w/or w/out chicken, small pizza, etc. 

I've ordered the philly and the greek salad lunch specials, and I've split one of their special pizzas that comes with shrimp. The philly is better than the average cheap pizza place, with lots of gooey cheese and veggies and meat all crammed into the bread. It's on a soft white bread that makes it ideal for ripping off a handful of deliciousness to gnaw on while attending to other tasks. The greek salad was HUGE, enough for 2 filling meals for me and was loaded with goodies; cucumbers, pepperonicinis, tomato, PITTED kalamata olives- nice because so many places use the ones with pits, chunks of feta, red onion slivers and lots of chicken. The specialty pizza was also delicious- it had a white sauce with spinach and a blend of cheese melded with well-handled shrimp. The shrimp actually tasted like real shrimp and weren't over or undercooked, so that was hugely impressive from a place that's mainly billed for pizza. The crust wasn't particularly memorable, but it wasn't bad (because bad would be memorable, right?).

When the pizza comes they bring us some Pepsi X DRAGONFRUIT FLAVORED PEPSI!!!!! WHAT THE HELL?!??! All I want is Pepsi. Regular freaking normal simple everyday PEPSI!!!!
Anyways...
The pizza is mediocre at best. Not worthy of a review on its own. The wings are probably the only part of the order that deserve any recognition (that recognition is a1-star). Never again will I order from here. It's get my stamp!

DO             NOT              EAT             AT                 APOLLO'S!!!!!!!!!!!",A9qy3Iy-a8dxmDn6Z9bdSA,10,0,1,MEd_YbQPH142s7YrArZHYQ

They came into to my work and dropped off flyers to give out to customers so a few of my  co-workers and I bought a pepperoni and bacon pizza, 1 L of soda and 12 wings. It took them an hour to 45 minutes to deliver it to us and when we got it they gave us a buffalo and Jalape√±o pizza with 12 chicken fingers so we called them back and they said ""that is our fault keep that order and we will bring you yours with no charge"". After another hour wait another delivery driver came with only the pizza and demanding the other pizza back even after they said to keep it, he said we were lying and called his boss. After 5 minutes of talking to her he started yelling on the phone to her and calling her a bitch in front of our customers. So after all that we just gave him the pizza (we ate 2 slices and he still said he needed it back). After another 2 hours another guy came back with the pizza that we didn't want saying that we had to pay for it and pay for another set of wings. After arguing with us for a good 10 minutes, in fount of our customers again, we asked him to step out. Needless to say their communication is very poor and I will never eat there again.",DGcjR43uklooPjdU7-KH9w,1,0,1,7M6Vitkj0XzvKI4iESuLcg

I first learned about Apollos from a flyer I received at my office, and it has become a regular rotation in the week for my whole crew to eat from Apollos. Between the 4 of us we have ordered just about everything on the menu, and have yet to have anything but delicious, fresh food... including the pizza. The best part is they really have a large variety of food... you get your normal pizzeria menu with all the things that you usually expect, but they also have Greek food, all of which is phenomenal. And let me just state, probably one of the best Stromboli's I've ever had. And to top it off, it's run by a very awesome family. The service is great, the food is great. A true rare gem to find in Vegas.

I've had my final straw with Apollo's. This place used to be soooooo awesome, as mentioned in my previous review, but since ownership has changed hands, there's been a rapid decline in customer service as well as quality of food. The woman that answers the phone and runs the front counter is argumentative and rude (& is the owners wife, as I found out today), and today marks the 5th time in a row that they have screwed up my food. I am done. It really is sad because the original owners of this place knew what good food was and how to take care of their customers.",PnCzbKofJ-XM8eP4hwM6bA,0,0,1,w6WY69uakrfUs8GnDRZ5Vg

We ordered a Philly cheese steak, Gyro, and Chicken sub. the food came with drinks and the sandwiches with fries. Our food was hot, delicious and only 24 bucks for the 3 of us. My Philly steak was WAY better than POPS Philly's on Decatur. 
I know We will be ordering from here again.

I ordered for pick up and WOW I did not expect this place to be like what it was. It was kinda like the owners kids and kids friends were hanging out on the tables after school. I got it picked up, and boy, the address on Yelp is incorrect so I got lead to some other place, wrong pizza shop, and then had to make a couple phone calls to track this place down. 

The second time j got the pizza I was kinda ready to move on...was just average for me. No more Apollo pizza for this gal.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,0,3,H5EWdZsk_CldsSykkVy1Jw

Order Gyro, Philly pizza, choc mouse cake for dessert 

1. One of the better Gyro's I have had. flavor etc, could of used more sauce but thats to personal taste. 

2. - Verry Verry disappointed. The dough was under cooked or partially cooked there where pockets of air where it was raw inside.These are defiantly canned mushrooms I use to own a pizza joint and can tell difference. Well these where just really bad along with the dough. The dough felt like cardboard esk maybe due to rawness see pics soon.The cheese was descent. It was a shame cause I actually like the pizza sauce, it had flavor and texture. The philly meat was light on portion size also I am not shure , they could use a mix of grated cheddar and mozzarella  to make this better. Also do not use those mushrooms. Yes I know button nose mushrooms are expensive but trust me customers can tell product wise know. espic. if we work in trade. 

3. Choc Mouse dessert -- one of the better ones I have had not frozen witch has happened or flavorless. 

It seems that they are trying to be to much either a Greek food place serving classic Greek flare or Italian food restaurant serving such.  

I also ordered on the website for a coke product and got a pepsi one main reason I wanted to order and try seems pepsi is buying out the pizza restaurants lol. 

overall good greek food and dessert pizza's could use alot of work.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,0,0,2,A29aNMbbQZWOdzhoyxAYrA
