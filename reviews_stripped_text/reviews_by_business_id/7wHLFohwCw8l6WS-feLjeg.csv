ALL EMPLOYEES were making a team effort to acknowledge every guest, and were very engaging. We ate at the bar which I feel gave us a better experience as first timers. We ordered about 7 items and I absolutely loved every single one of them. The fish (entree) and oyster rockefellers were my favorite. The food came out one after the other and on time. I love when I don't have to wait too long for my food on a busy night and still have it come out presentable and taste amazing.

We were a party of 8, including my two 7 year old grandchildren. Service and atmosphere was great. Had 3 dozen oysters and assorted raw fish dishes. 24 hours later, 5 of the 8 of us came down with a violent case of food poisoning, including one of the children. Complained to Allen, and although he said he was sorry, I felt compelled to post this. He didn't offer any compensation for the $257.00 bill.

The oysters came with two different dipping sauces that were lighter than a cocktail sauce but big on flavor. That mixed with fresh squeezed lemon and the oysters tasted superb!  The tuna tartar was served with delish waffle fries that were lightly sprinkled with a red pepper. Last we had the beef carpaccio. It was served with these amazing seaweed crisps, arugula, and cherry tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and a drizzle of olive oil( I think, at least that was the base for whatever was drizzled on there...good none the less)

How often to you have this yin-yang of simple and complex food going on at such an affordable level.  I read a review on here from someone complaining that their mind wasn't blown.  Minds aren't meant to be blown here.  This is meant to be the kind of place that you can drop in and have an absolutely delicious meal of great food, done the right way, without someone attempting to blow your mind and take your money.

I've been there twice now and the folks making the food couldn't be more down to earth than these guys.  They know how to make great food, but they know even better how to make a great place that makes you want to say to your partner, ""Let's skip making dinner and go to Other Mama.""

Drinks: We ordered the Billie Joe and Trixie. The Trixie was awesome, Jameson with honey syrup and candied ginger! The Billie joe was refreshing with gin and cucumber but didn't quite WOW me.. 

Dinner: We started off with the French toast cavier. Don't think I would order it again but definitely worth a try! Different from anything I've tried before. You have a combination of the saltiness from the cavier and the sweet syrupy French toast. 

Blueproint raw oysters. $1 each. They were cold and delicious! Perfect! 

Scallop sashimi was awesome. I'm a big fan of sashimi and this did not disappoint. Melts in your mouth! 

Lastly, we got the mussels and waffle fries. I thought the portion was big enough for two. The mussels are big and meaty! The fries were good but I would have rathered some bread to soak up the sauce.

392704,2016-02-03,5,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"There were two restaurants that I was most looking forward to on my last trip to Last Vegas, Chengdu Taste and Other Mama. To be perfectly honest, Other Mama was the one that I was most worried about given we were going to be visiting on a Sunday and while most of the feedback about the place was positive, I did start to notice some grumblings about service and food quality, albeit just a few.

So a couple of Sundays ago five of us descended upon Other Mama for a 7pm reservation. The very first impression walking through the door was not good. There was a distinct smell of burnt oil along with smoke wafting all over the place. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant which was almost filled, with what looked to be mostly locals (which to me is a great sign). We were presented with menus and asked if there were any drink orders. When pressed about her favorite cocktails (many have commented about how good the cocktails were there) our waitress just asked us what we like to drink and offered no more. Very little enthusiasm. OK, IPA it is then.

Drinks placed we looked over the menu. Now, here is what I was a bit confused with. Most of the reports about this place has been about the quality of raw fish and how deftly it is handled. Yet looking over the menu, there seemed to be very little in terms of fresh raw fish. So to get things started we decided to order several items and continue to scour the menu and order other items later. We ""started"" with 2 types of oysters (Kusshi and French Kiss), uni, pork belly kimchi fried rice, deviled eggs with fried oysters, spicy yuzu fried chicken wings and the shishito peppers.

Arriving first were oysters and uni. While the raw bar displayed shellfish on ice in the display case the oysters that were brought to our table seemed flat and tired, no plumpness to them whatsoever. And the taste matched the appearance. Muddled brine flavor that reminded me of low tide. The uni was nicely presented atop a shiso leaf. Of the 5 pieces of uni, 3 were of good size and looked mostly intact. The other two were sad pieces almost the dregs of what was left and by no means appealing. Uni is one of my favorite pieces of nigiri. I love the texture and flavor. However these were a disappointment, not horrible but certainly not worth the $7 pp tab they were charging.

Next up were the deviled eggs, pork belly kimchi fried rice and the chicken wings. The deviled eggs were presented nicely with the fried oyster on top. As soon as I picked up the egg I paused as the egg white was stone cold. As I put the deviled egg in my mouth I realized not only was the white stone cold so was the yolk part of the deviled egg. For me this was very off-putting to say the least. The fried oyster was hot and actually very well fried but while some dishes benefit from a warm and cold component together, this dish did not. Horrible? No, not at all. But not appealing and certainly not something I would consider ordering again. The pork belly kimchi fried rice looked fairly appealing with a well executed fried egg atop the rice and pork belly. The belly itself was nothing special as the texture was not crisp nor was it soft like a a braised belly can be. Was was just eeh. Then there is the rice. This rice was nowhere near fried but rather resembled a starchy mess. Given how others have praised this dish I could not have been more disappointed...until I tasted the chicken wings. No reason to go into much here other than to say these were over battered over fried balls of mess. Mehhh.

It was at this point that I leaned over to my friend and said, ""what would feel about pulling the rip cord and going to get a second meal?""

Check please.

To be fair, we did not sample a lot of dishes. And quite honestly we may have had other dishes this evening but I just don't remember. But when 5 people all decide to leave a restaurant to eat somewhere else I really don't think you can write this off as just a bad night. As I mentioned in another post I am convinced this is an example of the Emperor not having any clothes.",AeQbL7ZA-dbMLf4I--l2_A,4,1,1,davhKprJ2l7XDQ6AQuYAkg
399455,2017-05-09,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"After hearing about this place from local chefs and finding it on my girlfriend's bookmarks we decided to check out Other Mama the other day and we arrive right at opening and just in time for happy hour.  The shopping center this place is located in is older and may seem sketchy but I find the best restaurants are usually located in places like these and I can definitely see Other Mama inspiring competitors to this lot in the future. Stepping inside it felt like I was transported to a sea side village in Maine or something and I was visiting the local tavern on a stormy day. It's a dimly lit maritime decor and that interior makes you feel right at home.

Service: Our server was great as she went introduced the menu and it's concepts as well as breaking down the Specials wall and going into detail about the more popular or in season ones. She was also on top of our waters and checked back frequently to make sure we were good. Usually at local spots I don't expect 5 star service and I mean it wasn't formal and it shouldn't be, but she definitely knocked it out of the park. I was impressed with her extensive menu knowledge and ability to give good recommendations and reasons why she'd recommend it not just for the sake of upselling. 

Starters: Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries x White Fish Ceviche. Both of these items were on the happy hour and for I believe $6 or something like that it was an absolute steal. And these aren't even half portions, it's the full size. The Ceviche was a combination of different things and paired with some excellent sweet potato chips. The chips were crunchy but not super hard and I found myself enjoying just the chips at times and forgetting about the ceviche which was fresh and flavorful. The Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries was probably our favorite starter though as the waffle fries were crisp and just the right size. (Before Other Mama I felt like the only place that sold Waffle Fries was Chick Fil A) Spicy Tuna was fresh as well and the portions are very generous as I found myself having enough Spicy tuna left even when the fries were almost done. Great Apps and quite filling. 

Entrees: Kobe Steak x Broiled Shrimp. The Broiled Shrimp came out with 4 pieces of jumbo shrimp split open and covered in a searing skillet of hot oil, butter, and sauce. Very Cajun. Just how I like it. The shrimp was fresh and meaty while the sauce just made it so much better. I found myself dunking my shrimp and eventually my steak in the sauce as well. The steak was alright and wasn't anything super impressive. It didn't melt in my mouth and the relish had me wishing it was chimichurri. The sides of asparagus and potatoes were hearty and I appreciated how soft but crunchy the asparagus was.  I feel like the NY Strip would have been been better especially with the bernaise and waffle fries. Will definitely try next time. 

Thoughts: This is definitely what I would consider a local gem. I love how there's more of these popping up around town as various chefs from the strip break out to pursue their own ventures.  This creates high quality food at a price point that isn't overkill. If Other Mama was on the strip our meal would have been in the upper 100s but instead our bill came out to $72 before tip. Im excited to be returning here multiple times and trying all of the potentially delicious foods that Other Mama has to offer.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,1,0,5,Zz-evM6gnmT6HYgzly8zJg

Despite a packed dining room, we were able to snag two spots at the raw bar where we proceeded to have a memorable experience - both with the service and with the food. We ordered the spicy tuna tartare, salmon poke, grilled octopus, and some incredible drinks, including the Billie Joe. 

The salmon poke was so good I wanted to lick my plate afterwards. Not joking. The rest of the food was outstanding and the craft cocktails were spot on. This is the type of place where you want to graze for hours: chat with the foodies next to you (including the chef from another local restaurant who makes this place his go-to spot), order another item from the chalkboard, and chat up the server for way too long until they're pretty much rolling you out the door.

800335,2017-03-20,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Blew through Las Vegas on vacation and had a night to kill before catching our plane. We stayed off the strip and didn't really want to head down there for dinner so I poked around and was lucky enough to find Other Mama. 

My recommendation? Just go there. The food was fantastic. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. They would have gotten 5 stars from me if it weren't for the lackluster (and at times terrible) service. But more on that later.

First and foremost, the food was fantastic. Thoughtful composition and spot on flavors. LOT's of dining options on the chalk board. Highlights for me were the Amberjack Crudo with Ponzu Salsa, Deviled Eggs with Fried Oyster (interesting pairing of flavors and texture), a grilled octopus appetizer that was so perfectly prepared I almost wept and the whole grilled fish.  Then the cocktails...oh my gha. The Billy Joe was solid. The Svetlana was crazy. I NEVER would have thought to put those flavors together but...wow. You MUST try one. 

The service....well...I'm really disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would have service that rivaled a mediocre Denny's. Especially given that it was not very crowded in there at all. Our drink order was taken promptly but took forever to get to the table. The apps (ordered when we got the drinks) came out in a reasonable amount of time. Then....we finished the apps...and our drinks....and waited....and waited....and never saw our waitress....and we waited...and waited. Then the when table next to us (who arrived way after us) received their entree's (after they got drinks and finished their apps) I grabbed that waiter and asked if he would take our order. Seriously? Sigh. We were pretty much ignored from that point on. To top it off, when we got the check, they ran my credit card on a different tables check. One that was MUCH more than ours. 

ALL this being said, I would go back. But I would order everything the first time I saw my server. Just to be safe. LOL!",yp5cfoaqlGZtwh9Iz4r_xA,1,0,4,IYnM2s6HixBK-Z26xlo6hQ

We mostly ordered off the specials menu: oysters, octopus carpaccio, soft shell crab, and scallop sashimi. All were very fresh and seasoned very well. The seafood was the star, and the accompanying sauces just served to enhance it. The soft shell crab was the best I've ever had, and the scallop sashimi was incredibly buttery and tender. As the mother of a 2 month old, we don't get many nights out (this was the first since she was born!), but we plan on coming back here. There were at least 4 things on the menu that we really wanted to try, but we just didn't have room! Highly, highly recommend.",8VzrBkgUM8E348hmYrAxNg,0,0,5,AjLMIrYD1Fa7h06y-8_prQ
808459,2015-10-02,1,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Amazing establishment that's tucked in a not very impressive strip mall.  But inside, the food is beyond impressive.  I've known them for their bar and raw bar, but I had no idea the food that comes out of that kitchen can be that amazing.  

Great quality ingredient and simple preparation is the best way to cook food.  And they've nailed it on that concept.  

Tried a variety of oysters, clean and fresh.  You pick a few special condiments/sauces you can accompany with instead of the regular basic lemon, tabasco or vinegar.  Point Reyes ones were our fav., you could taste the ocean almost.

Sashimi combo, great quality and good portion.

The prime hanger steak is unbelievably tender and well seasoned.  The waffle fries on the side are perfectly crispy and not greasy at all. The sauce on top is also great and not overpowering, and I am normally not a heavy sauce person.

The bronzino is definitely the best bronzino I've ever had in my whole life as it seems.  The fish itself is so perfectly grilled and cleaned.  Simple salt, pepper, a little season with rosemary and lemon slices.  Not covered in any fancy sauce, no fancy EVOO drizzled on top, it's the cleanest fish, crisp and flaky at the same time.  It's a must order at this place.

The caviar/uni french toasts are also top notch.  Uni and caviars are only the icy on the incredibly fluffy and pillow-like french toast squares.  I joked with the chef that he should make them pillow size that I would totally dive in.  

Service is great, price is so reasonable, food is amazing.  It's definitely my top restaurant in town and will recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic meal.  I LOVE sashimi/sushi, seafood and good meat.  I think I've found the perfect restaurant for me that I can indulge in everything that's on my favorite list in one meal.

1021919,2015-04-26,2,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"The food is 5 stars, but the service was a dud.

We ordered some of the signature dishes: Amberjack Crudo, Oysters, Tuna Tartare, Kim Chi Fried Rice and Chicken Wings. Everything was delicious. Every dish had a distinct and focused taste, texture and composition. The food is innovative and creative.  The flavors are powerful, unique and on point. Ingredients are fresh and of high quality. I can't wait to try the other menu items. It's great to have access to such talent  without having to head to the Strip.

Now the issue with service. The restaurant wasn't that busy. The service has to match the caliber of the food (i.e. SoHo Japanese) otherwise it's an annoyance. The oysters arrived in a timely manner, but things just dragged on and on from there. The service team doesn't seem to work as a cohesive unit, nor are they particularly excited (or versed) about the menu. You pretty much will only get the attention of your server and not anyone else. The disjointed service created a disruptive dining experience. I will try sitting at the bar next to see if that works better.",MEhBmoVFiiv9LZVq5NTMGQ,2,1,3,P60_2BznfpT1aa2xPzoQig
1033501,2016-04-14,2,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"The short version: 
If I were rating solely the food, it would be 4.5/5 stars. 
The service, due to wait times (legit 20 minutes) for the last two courses, a cocktail that never arrived, and overcharges for items that were not rectified brings it down to a 3/5 stars for me. 

After raving about Other Mama for months, my boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner this Monday evening around 6. There were only a couple of parties seated at tables as well as at the bar, so we were seated quickly. It's their 1 year anniversary so they had some oysters marked for $1 each along with regularly priced oysters, daily specials, and a regular menu. We started to order right away, since there was a movie at 8 that we wanted to see. 
The mixed sashimi plate was delicious and super fresh, as were the first round of a dozen oysters (whatever was the $1 option) and half a dozen Beau Soleil. Our server recommended the perfect sauces for our oysters. The waffle fries are really crispy and well-seasoned. The razor clams are not fresh like I expected, but breaded and fried calamari style. My cocktail had good flavor.

Unfortunately, our final course of Blue Point oysters (recently changed to $1 each) took over 20 minutes to arrive, and my second cocktail never did. At this point in the evening, most of the table were filled up and there was only one team of server/ runner working the main dining area. I understand that it's a popular restaurant and would naturally have busier times, but this really brought down the experience for us. Finally we asked for the check and when it arrived, noticed that we'd been charged the regular price for our first and second rounds of $1 oysters. 

We let our server know about the error and that the second cocktail hadn't been delivered, and he promised to correct the check. We didn't have more time to sit and wait since it was approaching our movie time, but still tipped a full 20%. We left and expected it to be taken care of. 
My boyfriend checked his bank account today and noticed that he was charged the full amount. We enjoy dining out and spending money on great food and service, so this was pretty disappointing. We may return in a couple months since he food was very tasty, but for now it's left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).",fvPyUxDqdfJkzkon5G_YSg,1,0,3,m8dmd-r46q5BZr_YGogHRw

My favorite to order is the sashimi deluxe platter, and tonight we added the fried oyster tacos which were so tasty, grilled octopus that was melt in your mouth tender not chewy, and the soft shell crab was lightly breaded which allowed the true flavor of the fresh crab to shine through.

My server was named ""English"" (guessing that's an alias).  I think I heard another employee call him Dave, but I don't hear very well.  English did a great job and was talkative, likable, and friendly.

Like some other reviewers, I found many things on the menu I wanted to order...but I was all by my lonesome.  I really need to find some friends!  Here's what I tried:

---  Oysters:  The oysters were fabulous.  They only had two choices, so I snarfed down three of each.  Great value.
---  Shrimp Mint:  I really liked the flavor combinations but they were a little light on the ikura.  I've had better ikura in North Dakota, so I'm not complaining here...
---  Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice:  I was surprised by how much I liked this.  The kim chi flavor was quite muted.  The pork belly, mushrooms, and fried egg mixed very well with the fried rice.  Every bite tasted better than the previous bite.  
---  Pabst Blue Ribbon:  $3 a pint.  Yeah, buddy.  What's better than a cheap lager combined with great food??  NOT MUCH!!!  Seriously, you ought to try it sometime.

The pricing was very fair, but it sure would be easy to ring up a big tab here.  Another nit to pick - it wasn't hot outside, but it was plenty warm inside the restaurant.  Made me wonder what it's like when the temp is 115 or so.

Shoshito peppers, cauliflower and pistachios - nice flavors on the peppers but not as well seasoned as their other plates.
Amberjack crudo - delicious!  Fresh and tasty.  It was so good, we had to order 2 plates.
Oysters Rockefeller with foie gras - by far the best thing we ordered.  Foie was subtle and not overwhelming so you can taste the oyster.  Lots of crispy bread crumbs on top. Yum!
Beef carpaccio - underwhelming.  Not salted well enough, beef was sliced too thick and the nori Parmesan chips were not savory enough to carry the beef and mixed greens.
Spicy tuna with waffle fries - perfect!  Really hit the spot.  The fries were a nice crispiness and worked really well with the tuna.  Definitely eat this one again.
Salmon poke and beets with sweet potato chips - another home run.  Salmon and veggies were perfectly diced.  Loved it.
Fried calamari - another winner.  It's crispy, tasty, slightly spicy with nice picked pepper slices on top.
Miso Honey ice cream - a very rich, thick ice cream that's really interesting in a good way.  honey is the predominant flavor and miso is in there but if I didn't know there was miso in there, I probably couldn't pinpoint the flavor.  Like it said, interesting in a good way.

We had raw oysters, the sashimi plate, the shishito peppers, the beef carpashio, the amberjack crudo, a few other things I feel like I'm forgetting, along with beer and wine. We brought our well behaved 8 yr old boy and I feel like he was welcome there, though I wouldn't describe it as a ""kid friendly"" spot. We were the first ones in the door that night (got there right at opening), and the place filled up fast. All the food was fresh and well prepared, our favorites were the oysters and the crudo, and the service was attentive- however, we were seated and served mostly by the hostess, which I assume is standard operating procedure for them, but she was not very knowledgeable about the menu, nor very friendly. She seemed a little uncomfortable so maybe she was new? No problem, we enjoyed our visit and will return the next time we are in Vegas.",Hw12BVi2ZQwN_PvlfxYb1A,2,1,4,nc6vlOEaPuFS-HnK3iLBEA
1412208,2015-09-20,2,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"From the outside, wasn't sure what to expect from this place.  The sign reminds me of a dive bar I used to go to in Waikiki.  It didn't help that there were some younger ""kids"" smoking cigarettes out front, sitting on the hood of their car.  If Other Mama's yelp rating wasn't so high, I would have jumped right back into my car, assuming this place isn't my scene. Lol.   BUT I walked in...and WHOA.  The inside is not at all what I expected.  It's an open kitchen format, but done in a very homely manner.  It's not at all flashy.  All of the servers are wearing baseball t's and it's very casual, although you may see customers dressed up on a date or having cocktails after work.  The vibe is very ""downtown"" (you know what I mean), but it's located about 5 minutes from my house, so WIN!!!!  

My first visit I was solo, and sat at the bar.  I ordered the organic chicken over a bed of Shishito Peppers & sweet potatoes.  It came out sizzling on a cast-iron plate.  Everything about this dish was yum.  I particularly liked the rock salt over the chicken.  It gave that pop of saltiness here and there, which wasn't too overwhelming.  Shishito peppers were great and the sweet potatoes were deeeeeelish! 

My second visit was with my boyfriend a few days later and we decided to sample the sashimi sampler, and amberjack + the organic chicken.  Yep!  Had to get it again.  It's just so good!  The amberjack is as good as everyone raves it to be!  During this dinner I even said ""I wish they had more dishes like THIS!"" The fish provided on the sampler is unbelievably fresh. I haven't had sashimi this good in a very long time.  Our server was courteous to ask what our favorite sashimi type of fish was, and the sampler was created with our specific tastes in mind.  LOVE! 

Recently we went with my daughter and my boyfriends brother and we enjoyed another very delicious meal. We had all of our original favorites plus we tried the special, Alaska king salmon in a cherry ponzu.  Omg.  It melted in my mouth & the basil complemented the dish very well.  We also tried the Pork belly fried rice which came recommended by our server.  I'm not a huge fried rice fan (I know, I know, being from Hawaii, that is pretty strange), but if I have the option to order fried rice, I never do.  Everyone else wanted to try it, so I took a bite.  Pretty good, but not my thing. I probably won't partake in that dish again. Everyone else raves about it, so it must just be my personal preference. On this visit my daughter had the chicken wings (sauce on the side) and the criss-cut fries.  They don't have a kids menu and a lot of the regular menu items are a little too adventurous for a picky eater, but she managed to find something to enjoy.  

Overall, Other Mama is a 5 star restaurant. The service is always on point. The food is always delicious and thoughtful.  The atmosphere is comfortable and not at all pretentious.   You can tell that the owner of this place really put some thought into the dishes and decor.  Other Mama is my type of eatery!",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,6,6,5,Sn5qNPfIOuxMw3ht3RlYkA

1452528,2017-07-30,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"First of all, this place is quite confusing on what do they really specialize. The name sounds like they are serving grandmas cooking then when you see the signage design looks like western with a Latina looking lady. Then when you enter the restaurant they have somewhat of a sushi bar. The paintings on the wall are seafood and when you look at the menu they have Japanese, Spanish, French, Korean, Italian cuisine. It's a fusion of everything. 

We ordered quite a few dish. Spicy Tuna Tartare with waffle fries do not complement with each other. It doesn't give you the distinct flavor of the tuna tartare with a fries. The ceviche is much better paired with sweet potato fries. You can taste the sweetness of the fries and the spicy flavor of the ceviche. The shishito pepper did not have much of a flavor. It is missing something. Hush puppies crab needs more crab and the deviled eggs are quite fine. The kimchi fried rice is very small for an entree. Also they don't give you bottomless lemonade which is quite odd. 

I would say this fusion restaurant is ok. I have not tried the other dish so it maybe better. I would suggest if you are going to order wine and you're in a group, a bottle is better price wise. We got the Jollie Folle Rose and surprisingly good.",1jwTqZYsjnY5f9c46YUArg,2,0,3,XjwpncVN7HbtAc3hMSCcXw

-oysters. meh. but we got the dollar oysters. you get what you paid for.
-raw scallop sashimi style: buttery, creamy, deliciousness. LOVE
-raw ...surf clam? I think?: sweet, fresh, also excellent.
-amberjack crudo: perfectly balanced and beautifully executed. perfect.
-beef carpaccio: also perfect. fresh beautiful beef, a little umami from the parm nori chips. perfection.

and THEN there's...
-ceviches. had both. both sucked. we had a group of 10. we're all food lovers. only had one white fish ceviche and one mixed seafood ceviche. we had leftovers. they were super ungood. I am a terrible cook and I made better ceviche the first time I tried.  It almost made me angry. Even the sweet potato chips were not good. they were very crispy...but too crispy...as in it tasted a bit burnt. In fact all of our chips and waffle fries tasted a bit burnt. I guess it's a fine line between deliciously crispy and burnt but it was definitely leaning towards the latter. don't get me wrong, it wasn't obviously burnt. it just had that bitter aftertaste.
-pbr seafood toban yaki. not terrible. but definitely not ordering it again. tasted like they made a sour seafood stew...and just straight poured pbr into it at the end. rather unpleasant.
-prime ribeye miso hollandaise. sounds great doesn't it? I thought so, too. The meat was cooked perfectly. But the miso hollandaise was NOT happening. I almost wished the sauce was on the side so I can just have the meat on its own.
-shrimp and jalapeno hush puppies. TERRIBLE. neither shrimp nor jalapenos could be tasted. mush inside. tasted like...mushy cornbread nuggets deep fried. actually, that probably would have been better.


fortunately not all cooked foods were terrible
-yuzu chicken wing: not the BEST but most of us enjoyed it. I'd order it again
-shishito peppers: well done
-kimchi fried rice: not the best but solid. it'd probably be better if they chopped up the pork belly into smaller more edible pieces...and if the pork belly wasn't so overly fatty. I love a good fatty pork belly but ours was alllll fat. 

ambiance is...home made hipster. not home made in a homey cozy way. but homemade like they should have hired an interior designer and they didn't and it looks off sort of way. but it's clean.

service. excellent. very very friendly staff

We also ordered oysters which were very fresh and complimented with some great sauces.  The kobe beef special is amazing and the Uni they had was the sweetest uni I have ever had!

We ordered a few different things. 
I tried 2 of each of their 4 types of oysters, which came with a choice of 2 sauces. I opted for some sort of salsa which was great. And I think a wasabi cocktail sauce? Which tasted just like a normal cocktail sauce.
We tried the waffle fries which were fantastic. The plum bbq sauce that goes with them was killer!
We also tried the Pork belly kim chi dish which came with a fried egg, and some rice. This was very good!

Now about the food. Our party of four began with a dozen of oysters - Fanny Bay, Blue Point and Skookum - and it came with a variety of sauces.

Spicy Tuna Tartare with Waffle Fries was an unexpectedly delicious combination, and Grilled Shrimp Salad came with soba noodles and baby arugula, which seemed odd turned out to be a great assortment of protein, green and whole grain.

Caviar and French Toast with Crème Fraîche was another interesting dish. Unlike the normal toast or baguette, tiny pieces of pancake-like soft savory toast came out and it allowed us to appreciate little by little, rather than swallowing all the caviar at once. We got another batch of toast and I even ate the toast alone - it's that good.

Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings was the only meat we had, and it played a nice and crispy role in the interim of seafood dishes.

Then the Amberjack nigiri special - it literally melted on my tongue.

And finally, the Japanese Cheesecake with Raspberry Mint Sauce - it didn't really taste like a real Japanese cheesecake, but it's definitely on the softer and fluffier side. I would say, an Italian cheesecake. Tasty piece of it, nonetheless.

The bill came out at $32 per person - not bad at all.

I decided to focus on flavors, presentation, and service. OK... service was phenominal! I got to sit at the far end of the sushi bar overlooking the kitchen (a treat)! Several servers chatted with me even though they weren't mine. Wow! I watched prep, plating, and service. Chef Han was 3' from me doing his magic (see pic).

The menu is modest but there were 16 daily specials, so if you come regularly, you won't get bored. I had:

1. Ceviche w. Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish (fluke aka East coast summer flounder, Habanero. It was a complex yet yummy jumble of flavors.

2. Salmon Sashimi salad: tender and firm with a sweet aeoli (unnecessary), pepitos, and a lovely fresh baby green salad topper.

3. Salmon (Scotland) sashimi: buttery tender perfection

4. Amberjack Sashimi: firm and subtle, rich fatty mouth feel.

5. Ocean Trout Sashimi: (Australia): melty, slight oil on the pallette , beautiful touch of brine, divine

6. Blue Crab Tostadas (3): lots of dense, complex, rich palette-pleasers... including a hint of tongue-tingling cayenne.

Best to make reservations but walkins may be ok mud-week or early weekend eves. Also the space is smallish, so the noise level is moderate to rambunctious. Plenty of parking in the Durango/Flamingo Westside strip mall.

Well, we finally made it back again, and by we and I mean I actually joined them this time. Holy cow is this place good!

Think small plates, fresh oysters, and incredibly well-made cocktails.  The stand-out for me was the deviled eggs with fried oyster, followed by the shishito peppers, cauliflower and pistachio.  The octopus was well prepared, just a bit bland for my taste.

I was looking for something refreshing and not to sweet, so the recommendation was the Billie Joe.  Spot on! Gin, maraschino, mint, rose-water, cucumber, and lime. It was a complex drink made to perfection. Definitely a do over for me!

After hiking box canyon, a good cheat meal was what my friends and I were looking for. Found the amazing reviews on Yelp and although it mentioned they are usually busy, we took our chances on a Sunday evening.

The restaurant itself was cute and simple. The tables were set up with glasses and silverware ready for the guests and chalk boards stating all the specials of the day (which was a lot). There was also a bar that you could sit in if you preferred. :)

Service was what kind of ruined the experience. We were served by Santina (they don't have name tags so we just checked the receipt). From the start, her service was already questionable because she was really short with us and it was not busy at all. As a server before, we figured she was just having a bad day. Apparently not the case because we noticed how friendly she was with other guests. When she was dropping off our check with the credit card, she did not even bother to say anything but a quick 'Thank You' and walked away. But thankfully, other servers there, especially the one who ran our food (she has facial piercings) were super friendly and talked to us about the types of oysters and the story of the restaurant. 

The food was of course amazing!! We ordered the Yuzu wings, kimchi fried rice with pork belly, deviled eggs and waffle fries to share. Oh and 3 dozens of various Washington oysters that tasted so fresh!! Prices were completely reasonable for the quality of the food.

The staff promptly sat us without a reservation even though they were hitting a dinner rush at the time. We started out with oysters on the half shell, which was superb. My friend had the steak rare with waffle fries (a must try!) and I had the grilled whole fish. The portions were very generous and my fish paired very well with their white wine selection. Half way through out meal we decide to get the Japanese fried chicken and fried mushrooms.

By the time our chicken and mushrooms arrived, the woman next to us starts balling out and stabbing her food. It was awkward, but the food still tasted extraordinary. 1/3 of the way through our chicken (served with some sort of tangy aolie), the man with the balling woman suggests that they should leave. The woman tried to leave with her glass of beer (a Stella, I believe, which they have on draft) and he says, ""I dont think you can go outside with that.""

Other Mama is part raw bar, part cocktail bar, part hipster hangout, in the best of ways. Friendly and professional staff plus a high-quality menu make Other Mama a success.

Start with the SHRIMP MINT, a mix of shrimp salad and mint wrapped in cucumber and topped with salmon roe. Move on to the not-actually-spicy SPICY TUNA with TOGARASHI WAFFLE FRIES for a fresh-savory combination you can assemble like nachos. Close out the night with the SPICY YUZU WINGS- sweet plus spicy, ask for them extra crispy to avoid the slight sogginess I encountered.

Pricing is on par with the quality served here- the above was just over $40. Cocktails have two pricing tiers, $9 and $16. Plan accordingly. I'll be back for the amberjack and oysters!

EDIT: Came back with the BF for the amberjack, oysters, asparagus tempura (seasonal!) and the shrimp mint dish (again).

This is a pretty small spot and it didn't seem too busy the day I came but It may be on usual days. Personally, I am not a fan of sashimi and oysters which was on their special menu. I also cannot handle spicy food so at first I was hesitant. After looking at the menu, I got the grilled fish. The fish was a little too burnt for me but the inside was delicious, filled with lemon and fresh greens. Their sweet potatoes on the side were SO DELICIOUS! I would order those as a side!!! We got the hot pot ($22) which was VERY SMALL and definitely not worth It. But we also got a sashimi bowl ($33??) and It had 25 pieces of sashimi. We also got the American Kobe (the peas on It were sooo good) and they pre sliced It for us which was very nice. The prime steak was alright but personally loved the sauce on It with the waffle fries. I did not understand the hype until I had It! They made It so It was like a potato chip instead of your usual soft waffle fries. And last but not least, we ordered rice pudding and the walnut brownie (both were $7) and although the portion seems small, It was the perfect size after a very filling meal. The service was nice and the people were friendly, the food took a little longer (probably because of the grilled fish) but with family time always flies.

But, maybe not so different.   Like most of the reviewers, a solid four stars.
It looks like a ""joint"" from the outside, and the inside is modest. Prices are modest, too.
The oysters and beers are a bargain, which even a well-healed traveler can appreciate.
The Pork Belly Kim Chi was excellent.  Perhaps could have been spicier for some, but very much to my taste, and the pork belly was like butter but better.  
Ceviche very generous and well prepared.  I spend a fair amount of time in Peru so have had it many ways and this preparation is very good.
Asparagus tempura was crisp and not overdone.  On a par with that at Raku, a truly great, more expensive Las Vegas restaurant.  
The Shrimp & Jalapeño Hush Puppies were not exceptional.  Good enough, not expensive.
The Rib Eyes were very good, but steak is steak.
So the boil down-  the staff is wonderful.  Enthused and friendly.  
Because it was late and they were out of the Foie Gras (seems not the first time) we were treated to a round of drinks.  That was above what I expected and it was appreciated.
The food is sometimes a bit cutting edge and that is admirable.  
It is refreshing to leave the convention halls and mega hotels and see a chef really working at his craft.  The place is not a bases loaded home run but a lot of fun, a bit audacious, a solid three bagger.

Ordered:
-Beef carpaccio
-Sashimi platter
-Spicy yuzu chicken wings
-Rib eye prime and waffle fries
-Japanese cheesecake
-Ice cream (miso honey , strawberry , and tamarind)

Nothing wrong with the food, but also nothing very special. Very expensive for what it is. Service was also a bit slow - we asked for ketchup for the waffle fries and it never came , was gonna flag down our waitress again but she was never found. We ate all the waffle fries anyways before we got to her again. She just completely forgot about it. Japanese cheesecake was a bit disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me (besides the medium rare rib eye prime that was cooked to perfection) was the miso honey ice cream , it had a unique taste.

Total bill was 100$+ , and for a party of 4 they were able to split the bill no problem. Left pretty hungry still though. This is the type of place to just order for taste/presentation.

I had gone when they had just opened, I believe they had been open for 3-4 days? The moment we walked into the door, we were greet by a really nice young lady who greeted us to the table. She explained the menu and the daily specials. The specials were kind of far away for where we were sitting so we took a picture so we could go over it in our seats. Everything on the menu looked so good so it was kind of hard deciding what we wanted!

We opted for all three oysters they had at the time. The prices for all three differed by maybe 50 cents so we wanted four of everything. All I remember is that the $2 oysters being too salty for our tastes. So after tasting all of them, we decided to get three more each of the other two that we had liked. We love oysters!!

For the main dish, the boyfriend got kimchi fried rice and I had gotten the steak with miso hollandaise sauce. For being a Korean person, I am usually picky with the kimci fried rice but I have got to say, it did taste really yummy!! There were even two slices of pork belly in it which was different but I loved it! Also, the waitress had said she had actually made the kimchi herself which I thought was really awesome. Home made kimchi for the restaurant! The steak I had gotten came with the miso hollandaise sauce and it was sooooooooooooo good! I was literally licking the sauce off of the plate due to the deliciousness. It had also come with thin waffle fries that also tasted really good with the sauce. 

For dessert, we had gotten the pot de la crème and holy shiznits! it was sooooo good. I wanted to get another one but we decided we would get too fat haha It comes in a cute little jar that looks like its meant for candles. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.

All in all, the atmosphere of the restaurant was also really cute. It reminded me of New Orleans or San Diego kinda, the ambience of it all. The chef/owner? of the restaurant had also come over to ask us how we were doing and asked us what we thought.

Spicy yuzu wings HH 5 pcs. - very good. The wings were gigantic and crispy. Wasn't spicy to us at all. The pickled veggies were great with it. They were a little overcooked, some of the meat was dry but I'd rather overcooked than undercooked lol

Miso honey ice cream $3/one scoop - we weren't gonna get dessert but thank goodness our server told us about their house-made ice cream flavors.

- Prime N.Y. Steak, Miso Hollandaise, Waffle Fries: Steak was cooked perfectly and how convenient to have it all sliced up 
- Kimchi Fried Rice, Pork Belly, Farm Egg : Pretty dang good for not being a korean spot. I have to say this is one of the best kimchi fried rice I've had in awhile. So much flavor and the pork belly was proportional to the rice.",chEls2JH3lI1RfRtSllRTQ,3,1,5,iQnM3nLatv1T2TQTHPT1qw

First, the good: the pork belly kimchi fried rice was fantastic! Flavorful and served in a hot stone pot, so when you mix the over easy egg into the rice, the pot cooks the egg at the same time. The grilled shrimp salad was also delicious! Would definitely order both of these again.

Next, the rest: the jalapeño hush puppies were a bit bland. There was a kick from the jalapeño but something was missing. The caviar French toast also didn't quite pair up well. I see the intent, trying to balance the saltiness of the caviar with the sweetness of the toast, but for me, it didn't work. And at $19, not worth the price.

Service was very good, our server was attentive and the food came out quickly. It's a small space, but we didn't have to wait (on a weeknight).",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,4,2,4,dhbQYQsPBz5mz71Iao45rA

This place is quirky seafood/sushi/sashimi  Great service.  Odd location, in a strip center, but whatevs.  Crazy cocktail list.  I will say, I did try the Ingrid - vodka, triple sec, strawberry balsamic....it tasted better than it smelled.  The balsamic was a little over powering.  And also, the tiny, champagne-like glass - not good.  Drink doesn't look appetizing at all, and the glass makes it worse - I suggest a high ball glass and ice.  I switched to the their gin/basil cucumber cocktail - very refreshing and visually delicious.  We had the tuna tartare with waffle fries, genius and pretty filling- great portion for two.  The sashimi bowl - super fresh.  And the Amberjack sashimi - delish.  We also got a dozen, assorted oysters.  Great flavors.  The food is super fresh.

2064826,2017-04-08,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Small, local, cool, and kickass. That's how I'd describe my Other Mama experience! 

Part sushi/rawbar, part Asian inspired with American influence, part creative cocktail, and part super no nonsense, familial vibe; Other Mama is like the best neighborhood restaurant you've always sought out but never had in your neighborhood. 

It's the kind of place where the menu is ever changing, so no two experiences are the same. Where the food has a lot going on, while the menu doesn't say much. Where you're not one of a million customers, and you're bound to know the staff by your second visit. 

We showed up on a night they had a private party. I never thought to call ahead to check, but the staff was really chill and set us up with three seats at the bar. Honestly, with a view of the open kitchen, watching them expo, prep, and run 15-20 of the same plates in unison, is the best seat in the house. 

This kitchen team is EFFICIENT, and it was impressive. Kinda like watching an orchestra perform. Everyone playing their part, allow us to enjoy pure harmony! 

We ordered up a couple dozen oysters (variety changes daily), grilled octopus with a sweet mash, Kim Chee Fried Rice, ""Shrimp and potatoes"" which had 4 huge prawns sauteed in garlic butter and served on a hot sizzling skillet with tiny fried heirloom potatoes, scallop and uni sashimi, and quite a few cocktails and a bit of sake too. 

All of it was delicious, and the meal was a helluva lot of fun! 

I really enjoyed this spot, and hope more Las Vegans discover it an enjoy it too.

Half dozen oysters came out to around $17.25. Then after two beers I was already up to $66.00. After leaving I was still hungry and needed to stop of elsewhere. 

If your paying for your date then expect to pay at least $100.00. 

The environment was very hipster/ boojie.. In my opinion these prices were in comparison to something a bit more notable on the strip.

I did not expect such a hip modern feel from this place. Nice and bright during the day and probably dark and romantic at night. They have a full bar, open kitchen, and plenty of seating throughout the place. 

My boyfriend and I had a tasting of all the oysters and found that we loved NY Prime and the Fanny Bay oysters the best. They also come with two sauces that are freshly made! I also tried their Agatha cocktail and it was refreshing and sweet! Definitely will try other ones next time! 

We also ordered:

AMBERJACK CRUDO $11: my favorite dish! It was sour and sweet and worked perfect with the ponzu salsa!

SUSHI SAMPLER $15: it was okay honestly. There was a lot of rice and it almost looked like brown rice was mixed in. The tuna was a little fishy also. I liked how the Chef Dan added the mantis shrimp! That's a new one I always wanted to try. 

PORK BELLY KIMCHI FRIED RICE: I loved how it came out still sizzling hot! It kinda lacked in flavor and I wished the kimchi was more fermented and had that sour touch to it. The pork belly was delicious though and had many large savory pieces in it! Plus the mushrooms gave it a great kick to it. 

Spicy Yuzu Wings $13: Am I the only one who didn't like it? I liked how crispy they were and it wasn't over breaded but it was missing flavor in the actual meat. I honestly didn't like the sauce they used to spread on one side either. It just tasted like sirracha and Yuzu mixed together. For $13 I kinda expect more than 5 wings.

Edge-of-shell-to-edge-of-shell, these incredibly plump and delicious mussels were a dream come true. SO hard to find good quality mussels and a chef who knows what to do with them. Bravo!

The oysters here are *expertly* shucked. And for those who scoff or make fun of the fact that I *always* mention shucking skills in my reviews that involve raw oysters/clams - I stand my ground and attest that 90% of the shuckers out there in restaurant world don't know what the hell they're doing when it comes to shucking, and the 90% find a way to ruin raw oysters/clams by getting hard bits of debris (shell bits, ocean crap) into the finished, plated product. So 5 stars for an uber-clean shuck. Every one of the 36 raw ones that came to our table was debris-free. That's hard to do! Molto bravo!

The lighting... the newish Edison bulb lighting is a great effort in trying to warm up the joint, but dimmers are desperately needed to ease the retinal burn, if you know what I'm sayin'. Those fancy unfiltered bulbs are wayyy too bright for naked eyes at normal stock wattages. We kindly asked our waiter to turn off 2 of the 3 bulbs that were blazing away in the floor lamp directly facing the West side of our party of 6. Much better, but with candles already on the table, I wonder if floor lamps are even necessary? There's gotta be a perfect balance...

Overall, a huge win for team Other Mama! We ate and drank and ate and drank to the tune of $100+ per person and loved it. Yeah, not a cheap outing, but we'd much rather spend this in our neighborhood than in a casino corporate joint. It feels good to chow down locally!

She even once told us we could not order another drink until we finished our original ones. I wonder what the manger would have thought if he was present hearing such blatant non-sense. Anther thing that needs a much needed adjustment is the clarity on the menu, as well as the happy hour, as it can get very confusing what time is what happy hour; as now there are two separate happy hours, which offer different discounts on food and drinks. The early one from 5-6 is--discounts on apps and drinks--and from 10-11 it's only dollar oysters, and you have no say in which oysters they are, as the cook decides for you. The food is high quality and most everything you order will not disappoint. I have tried most of the menu and everything is cooked to near perfection.

I mean who can beat $1 oysters with 3 different delicious sauces on the side!? We also ordered the deviled eggs with a  fried oyster on top and it was probably the best deviled eggs I've ever had. Cocktails were unique and quality especially the whiskey manhattans. Good quality craft beers on tap. We sat at the bar and the restaurant was not too busy at 5pm on a Thursday when they open for happy hour. Service was fast and friendly and they explained all their specials very well.

From sashimi & Fresh oysters to fried fish chicken wings or a steak they appear to have a good menu. I don't remember seeing a big range of different carbs.

2393119,2015-06-03,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I like the idea of Asian fusion tapas and fusion fine dining. And other mama luckily did just that in a pretty innovative and tasteful way. Parking wasn't a hassle at all since the area is pretty much dead with the exception of a small bar and sushi restaurant near by. 

Inside seating is pretty open as well and I've never seem to have problems being seating because of it being crowded. I ordered the oysters, Korean kimchi fried rice, mint cucumber rolls, tuna poke, live scallop, and the wings. For the most part I really enjoyed the cucumber mint roll, it was topped off with a little ikera, and had a really refreshing taste to it similar to a Vietnamese spring roll. 

The kimchi fried rice was okay, but came off as slightly bland especially since I'm Korean and I'm used to eating this dish regularly. The wings also were mediocre to me and didn't seem to stand out, but as a warning they do have a bit of a spicy kick. The oysters are what made this place though for me. I've had oysters at San Francisco so fresh it lack any fishy taste what so ever and was smooth to eat. 

This place comes a close second in how fresh their oysters were, and you get to try 3 of their sauces to accompany your sampler. And the best part was we got them for 1.50$ each! Idk if this was a regular price thing or part of their happy hour, but any time I can get fresh oysters for under 2$ i'll always take advantage of it. If you're looking for a new fusion fine dining tapas place to try or grab some oysters by the bar, I'd suggest other mama.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,1,1,4,JphlMFlohtodqfyNQ-uSmw

Luckily, they were able to accommodate us since the place is tiny and it's recommended you make reservations. Good to know for next time.

I was planning on ordering oysters and maybe a dish or two but who am I kidding? When I saw the menu, I wanted pretty much everything on the menu. 

The service was great. One of the guys was friendly and happy to talk about the menu items. We ordered all four kinds of oysters (Blue Point, Fanny Bay, Duck Island, and Beau Soleil) with various, unique dipping sauces, pork belly kimchi fried rice, shrimp and jalapeños hush puppies, Chirashi bowl, white fish ceviche, grilled ribeye with miso hollandaise, amberjack crudo, and the caviar and French toast with crème fraiche.

Holy crap! My favorites are the Caviar & French toast. We liked it so much we ordered another one. The grilled ribeye with miso Hollandaise was incredible. I enjoyed the oysters with the different dipping sauces. Everything was delicious but those three items stood out the most for me.

Let me start off by saying that they have 1$ oysters on Mondays.  Freshest oysters I have ever had, and I'll be coming very often for my oyster cravings. When I come I  usually get the amberjack sashimi (usually more then one order).  It's so fresh and the sauce on it is so delicious. Also if you like salmon, the salmon sashimi or the salmon salad are both so fresh and good, and the salad is the salmon belly. I also recommend the blue crab appetizer or the blue crab hand roll or the blue crab hush puppies.  The shishito pepper with cauliflower is a appetizer winner, be carful though, some of them might be spicy and some not.  The pokés are also very good and you can get sweet potato chips or waffles chips, they have tuna or salmon poké.  I am also a huge fan of uni, uni has to be fresh and you'll know based on color. Every time I order uni here it is fresh and delicious.  So when I come here I'll order the oyster with uni and ikura on top (to die for!) or uni sashimi is also a favorite. I like that this place has a  very appetizer like menu, it helps with trying different yummy things and not over eat.  Every time I have been here my waitress has always been Amber.

You're a Mother Lover
We should..."" - The Lonely Island

Other Moma has become a routine stop for us. You will typically find us here because of their raw bar.  They consistently have a good selection of oysters... often at a cheaper than most places in town. Some of our favorite oysters that we've had the opportunity to partake in at Other Moma have included Beausoleil, Kumamoto, Kusshi, and Pickering Pass. Additionally, they have Nigiri and Sashimi sushi that is better than all but the best sushi spots in town...to this point, I can't stop in without ordering some Ocean Trout or Amber Jack Nigiri.

Aside from the Raw Bar, the menu is very good in general... lots of choices you'll be happy with...but perhaps lacking a signature dish that demands my return. Still, because the whole menu is so strong, we usually share several of the smaller dishes for a chance to taste more options. We often enjoy one of their Pokes as well as their Cauliflower with Shishito Peppers. I've been pointed to the Amberjack Crudo on more than one occasion, and found it enjoyable and satisfying, but just not so much that I rave about it to others, still it's worth ordering, especially with a friend or for sharing. If you decide to go for one of their entrées I'd recommend the Grilled Branzino...wonderfully prepared and of excellent quality, 

I have been enjoying sake on more recent trips, but the first positive impression that lingered after my initial visit to Other Moma was how good their cocktails were. They do a good job of achieving balanced drinks that are alcohol forward...syrups used in proportion to elevate the drinks, rather than make a cheap liquor palatable.  

You could argue the setting to be hipster since we as a culture are still throwing that word around, but regardless of your take on that opinion, it is a setting that has been thought through and feels to fit right in with a menu that is borrowing from different culinary perspectives and presenting engaging and original options that are delicious.

2530875,2016-07-04,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I came here last night because I was super curious about the place, and I really wanted some oysters. It's a small place and I'm sure it can get filled very quickly, but for a Sunday night after 9PM, there weren't many people. (In hindsight, I realize this is probably because most people were watching fireworks.) I sat at the bar, since it was just me. I was waited on by two of the waitstaff, a guy and girl, both very friendly and helpful.

I started off with a drink, Billie Joe, because I wanted something with gin. This was smooth as hell for a gin drink. If ordering oysters, you are required to order by 6. Kind of odd, but I suppose if you're getting oysters, you aren't going to get 1 or 2 at a time. They come with 2 sauces, which other reviews mentioned. They were tasty but I could have done without them. To be honest, I preferred the lemon wedged squeezed onto the oysters, and maybe some vinegar. Keep it simple.

After the oysters, I tried another drink, Mavis. To me, this was a new take on a Manhattan. To the bartender, who was awesome, it was his take on a tiki drink that wasn't cloyingly sweet. It was a very light, almost kind of summery, Manhattan. Definitely a winner. I also ordered a couple pieces of the applejack nigeri. It's very, very delicate in flavor, but good. This would be a good introductory fish to the world of nigeri/sashimi. It's not overtly fishy or briny.

It is a bit pricey. It's not a place I would/could come to all the time, but I definitely will return again. I've got to try the rest of the killer cocktails, as well as some of the apps/tapas they have on their regular menu.",y9vss4aVUULf6Zc86MCbvw,0,0,4,3EqdzhazWjKUE1IhqTVYiA

I'd like to write about all the food we intended to order but unfortunately, three dishes did not even make it to our table!  

Joined by my co-workers for dinner, we started off with an order of the raw oysters (6 different selections on the board) along with oyster rockefeller with foie gras as well as an order of amberjack crudo.

The raw oysters were some of the best quality in Vegas at an amazing $2 each on average.  Very clean, delicious flavor.  The Beau Soleil oysters were my favorite, more sweet, less briny taste (my preference).  The oysters came with choices of dipping sauces of which we tried Wasabi Cocktail and Rosemary Mignonette.  Our servers were very knowledgable and helped us decide on what oysters to try.

The oyster rockefeller with foie gras was already a must order as soon I laid my eyes on the menu.  This is a cooked version of oyster topped with a spinach mix and some foie gras on top.  I was disappointed when our 2nd order of these never came to our table.  The dish came with 4 good-sized oysters and it was delicious.  The amberjack crudo was equally tasty.  So much in fact that we ordered another.

My co-worker ordered the assorted sashimi platter which they said had very fresh selections of fish and octopus.  

Our final dish we were able to try was the caviar and french toast with the crème fraiche.  Seriously amazing.  Perfectly cooked, warm, french toast with a helpful scoop of caviar on top.  This combination was new to me but most certainly welcome again and again.  

It was at this time that we decided to order some main entrees (1/2 organic chicken on shishito peppers and yukon potatoes,  also a hanger steak medium-rare) and another oyster rockefeller.  

We waited over 30 minutes and attributed the delay (in comparison to how fast the rest of the prior food came) to the influx of people that came after us.  Another 10 minutes passed without servers coming to our table and we finally flagged our original server down (asian guy, top knot, whose name I can't recall).

When we asked about our food, the server apologized saying he lost our ticket and the order was never placed.  40 minutes wasted.  We decided to just end the night here and took the check.   Unaware of the mishap, the manager said ""Thank you!"" as we stood to leave.  I made sure to inform her of the problem before we left.  Besides an apology and a promise to comp a few rounds (of what?) next visit, we left the restaurant still hungry and unsatisfied.   

I'd like to give this place another shot but it's no longer near the top of my must-try list.   With that said, delicious food and worth a try if you have not gone before.  Just make sure they don't lose your order.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,9,6,3,O0s_R8xNyG4cdgUelvQFsQ

I don't know why I haven't been here sooner ! but I haven't been to a restaurant in a while where I left and wanted to immediately come back. Every item we tried I LOVED, not like but LOVED! 

Calamari- best calamari I have ever had. It had some spice to it. It wasn't rubbery, it was cooked perfect. 

Ceviche- this has octopus, shrimp, white fish and the best part.. habanero. It was so good! That habanero really made this ceviche unique from the others. It came with sweet potato chips. Yum.

Waffle fries- just cooked perfect it was Crispy not oily and just enough. 

Deviled eggs- this had a twist though. There was a fried oyster on top. That was a little different. My friends thought it was weird but I enjoyed it. 

They have a board that has their specials. The waitress told me that they are daily specials and it literally is Daily. You might see it now and never see it again. One daily special was the Blue Crab hand roll and that was freakin bomb. I'm drooling just thinking about it. It was simple, and it was spicy! 

My friend got the Prime New York steak and that was so good as well. The steak was swimming in a miso sauce that was to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection. 

All the foods just had so much flavor, so much spice! Everything I tried had a bit of kick to it and I wasn't complaining! I love spicy foods. 

Dessert- I ordered the Nutella ice cream that had real Hazelnut chunks in it! That topped off my meal. So good! 

Oh and the specialty drinks! bomb. I got the Penelope. It was a good drink it was strong but didn't taste strong.

I will be returning very soon!",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,11,14,5,uxzCZLJidulf5Mmjkfnzzg

How ridiculous is that!   He was looking at the reservation list all crossed out and  told us may be 45 mins wait. Really?

The crab hush puppies are so good. The tuna tartar with the waffle fries are insanely good. I don't eat tuna, but I did try a bite and was addicted. 

We've been to the happy hour around 5pm I think, and order a bunch of things to share and get drinks.  It's a fun little spot in a strip mall area. 

Make sure you HAVE RESERVATIONS. Before it was dead when we went so the second time we felt we didn't have to make one. We got there and there was one table seated. They sat us at a 4 top with hard wood chairs... and we politely asked the man at the front if we could sit at the table with the cushioned seats. He said ""NO, those are reserved"" in a very ill-mannered way. Not sure what his deal was ... heavier set guy, maybe 5'10"" to 6"", dark hair.. think he was the manager perhaps. Not a very good one. He's the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars.  We were there for Exactly 1 hour. And they sat one other table while we were there.  
The reason we requested a softer seat, is because one of us is 80 years old, the other has Parkinson's which causes major leg and joint pain, and myself with a lower back injury. So we sat there and endured the really beautiful, yet hard wood seats.  Gosh that guy was such an ass... he could've been a lot nicer about it, but decided to just dismiss us. Which I wonder why that is?!  Maybe we're not the type of people he wanted in his restaurant?  Or he was having a bad day?  Not sure ... but 15 minutes into our dinner he's laughing and joking, and shaking hands of other patrons sitting at the bar. And then again with another guy who was leaving from the back. His demeanor completely changed. when you manage or own a restaurant, you treat everyone the same. Respectfully and nicely. There's a giant stick up this dudes butt. Really needs to get over himself. Will I ever go back?  Nahhh, there are plenty of other restaurants with better service and food. Sad that his staff are affected by his actions and lose out on having busier nights. Because I will never recommend this place to anyone.  Hopefully he gets his act together and learns how to treat people. 

Oh and did I mention NOT one single group sat at the table we requested???  Yup!  Nobody. We also walked to another business a few doors down and about 30 minutes later went back to the car and I popped my head in just to see. That table was still empty. Get OVER yourself dude.

We ordered the Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice, Oysters, Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings, and the special white fish.  The oysters were excellent and fresh, and I enjoyed the options of having different sauces for them.  The special white fish was excellent.  It was on par with Milo's white fish with a strong lemony, salty goodness that was quite good.  However, that's where the experience ended.

The Fried Rice sucks.  I can't say it any other way.  I overheard another table discussing it and hearing them compare it to KoMex.  I was laughing because I was thinking the same thing.  If you want Kim Chee Fried Rice, go to KoMex.  It's cheaper, more flavorful, and just better done.  As for the Chicken Wings, let's just call it a fail.  I have no idea how they prepare them, but they just suck.  Lotus of Siam has some of the best spicy chicken wings I've tried.  Other Mama's are simply forgettable.  

The restaurant was nice to try, but I won't be returning.  There are too many other options.  Also, the layout of the restaurant is awkward for Las Vegas.

Allen was our server and he was very helpful for providing us details on Oysters and the Specials of the Day.

Our oysters were paired with a bottle of Hakkaisan Sake... slightly sweet, light, crisp and clean...a nice pairing for the posters and Nigiri that would follow.

Next we placed 2 orders of the Nigiri Combination, one for me and one for my love. The Nigiri Combination came with Big Eye Tuna, Amber Jack, Salmon, Fluke, Octopus, Ocean Trout and Stripe Jack. These seem to be fairly consistent options. The Ocean Trout and Stripe Jack were so good that we just had to order more of them.

Our meal was finished with the Grilled Octopus from the Specials menu....look for it on the upcoming fall menu...we were debating between Lobster Tostada and our server Allen made a strong suggestion for us that we were very glad we took.

The menu isn't overly extensive but there are plenty of options for everyone. We ordered the Shishito peppers... Omg... Cauliflower with the peppers was utter perfection. It was a generous portion and we both couldn't get enough. We will be ordering this dish religiously from now on. I ordered a vegan avocado roll.

I ordered a Prosecco with a strawberry as my cocktail. It never disappoints. My boy boyfriend ordered the Bessie cocktail. It started out well but ended pretty awful. We probably won't be ordering that one again.

To be polite I asked the waitress if it was OK to sit at the sushi bar if I was getting a drink and an appetizer.  She said she would check.  Red flag.  Two employees later I was told it was too busy and all barstools  were reserved for a large party coming in. Keep in mind there were no barstools together.   I met with the bartender/manager who confirmed that there was no place for me to sit.  I told him I could have drinks and an appetizer and be out on time for the ""big crowd"" in 45 minutes.  I was told no. Then the bartender/manager put his hand out to shake mine.  What in the world happened to common sense, customer service and knowing how to run and keep the business? I don't rant much but when I do look out!  Bottom line - there are some really abstract idiots out there!  By the way - manager with the handshake David.

3167804,2015-05-29,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Other Mama is located on Durango, just North of Spring Mountain, inside the same center as restaurants like Norm's and TC's. The restaurant itself is on the small side and somewhat tucked into the back corner of the complex. Inside you'll find a modern, but homey and inviting feel. There's minimal seating alongside a fairly small bar, and I'd imagine there's going to be a wait during peak times...but, it's worth it.

In addition to their regular menu, they've also got a daily special board that hangs on the wall towards the back of the restaurant. It looks like many items rotate, but on our visit there were some non-standard specials, including $1 oysters. There's plenty of options between the two, and even a few things for those who don't eat seafood. Had my stomach been able to take it, I would have likely ordered everything on the menu. Instead, our party of 3 decided to share a few things...

Spicy Edamame - Per my 6 years olds request, we started we these. Solid starter, but they live up to their name. They've got a kick, and were too much for him. I'm a sucker for spicy food though, and couldn't stop eating them. I like that they use a dry seasoning, opposed to a spicy sauce like you find at a lot of other spots.

$1 Bluepoint Oysters - Juicy, plump, delicious...and cheap. We ordered these with two of their sauces, the Pickled Pepper & Habanero, and Ponzu Salsa. Neither did much for my taste. The habanero flavor was basically nonexistent in the first, and although the salsa had great flavor, I didn't think either were complimenting the oyster well. I see their sauces get great praise, so maybe they were just off on our visit? 

Oyster Foi Rockefeller - I'm not one to order oyster rockefeller normally, but with foie in the mix, I couldn't resist. Then they came out, we ate them, and asked eachother ""where's the foie?"". I've seen pictures of these, and ours looked like they had maybe half of the foie others had, maybe less. Maybe just off on our visit, but based on it, I wouldn't order them again.

White Fish Ceviche - Paired with perfectly crisped sweet potato chips, this is a must try in my opinion. Unlike the prior sauce, the ceviche had a very present, but enjoyable habanero kick. The fresh cilantro was a nice balance, and they aren't skimpy with the fish. When you run out of chips, it's delicious on it's own...trust me on this one.

Amberjack Crudo - Quite possibly their most popular dish, and for good reason. Fresh, tender fish and a delicious sauce with a little bit of sweetness, and a little kick. This was my first time having amberjack, and thanks to Other Mama, I'm constantly craving it and will order it anytime a restaurant has it.

Live Scallop - Excellent! Sliced thin, but still with a nice, rich, tender and buttery taste. Absolutely delicious on it's own, and so good that even my 6 year old couldn't stop eating it. 

Overall, pretty much everything we had was great, and aside from the oyster foie, I'd order everything again in a heartbeat. Must tries in my opinion are the ceviche, amberjack and live scallop. 

Unfortunately, our service wasn't quite as excellent. Our waitress seemed a little rushed, like our questions were bothering her. Since we got seated with only a couple other tables full, it was a bit disappointing. We also had one of the bussers take two of our plates that had food on them, without asking if we were done. Just walked straight up to our table, grabbed them quick, and was gone. Our food was up without a hitch, and our drinks stayed full, but service was nothing to write home about.

A few little hiccups, but still an extremely enjoyable experience for me. Other Mama has only been open less than 3 months, and mine is just one of the many of positive reviews that keep flowing in. If you've yet to come here, stop procrastinating.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,10,7,4,oI0KG9Jh9UoIkQhTOZMDCw

We ordered the shishito peppers & cauliflower for appetizers and that was a good start to prepare my pallet for what we were expecting to come with the main dishes.  As well as the viviana 12 cocktail was amazing and gave an instant buzz.  

For our main meal we ordered the garlic shrimp from the daily specials board and also the kimchi fried rice with pork belly off the regular menu.  The flavor and taste of the garlic shrimp was mediocre and did not satisfy my taste buds.  The kimchi fried rice seemed to have too much vinegar and souriness.   The pork belly was sort of bland and didn't have the seasoning I was expecting.

The service was great and didn't wait too long for our food to be served.  Overall,  I'll try this place again ordering different dishes and hopefully I can change my review to 5 stars.",dra8Ue1hlbNlQHdKDXiI1w,1,0,3,wFsHkkvSOaIdKhHq7wCoUQ

What makes it worth the 5 stars is the food and the service.  I had again just flown back to Vegas and had been on the United diet all day so I was starved for some good food.  
   We started off with 12 Holy Grail oysters.  They were sweet and very fresh tasting.  The sauces were a great compliment but the Wasabi Cocktail sauce was the favorite.  We also has the Tuna Poke which was really good.  The hush puppies were unique and delicious.  We had a couple of drinks from the bar - Agnes and Beryl which were like pretty tasty.
   For the main course we had the Oyster Rockefeller which was also very good.  Their oysters are very fresh tasting which is really important in the taste.  We also had the Nigiri Sushi Tasting, Kim Chi Fried Rice and PBR Hot Pot.  The Sushi was fresh and delicious.   The Kim Chi Fried Rice was very good and not overwhelmed by the Kim Chi.  The PBR Hot Pot was the wife's choice and she loved it.  
   Our server was Santina and she was great.  We felt well taken care of and really enjoyed her fun personality.  The bar staff was excellent and helped with our drink choices.  The restaurants slightly dim lighting which adds to the ambiance.  The dining area was well cleaned and inviting.

I was really looking forward to the $1-$2 oysters that I saw in some other reviews online. When I got there, every oyster was $2.5. I'm not going to complain too much of not having cheap oysters because these were very fresh. They also had a variety of 6 I believe when I went. I got 3 of each and it was a great appetizer. One of the sauces that came with the oysters was also amazing.

We got a variety of the entrees and none really stood out. I got the steak and fries that are basically in every review of the place, but it isn't something to write home about. 

I loved the decor and it really made the restaurant stand out once you got inside. Overall, I doubt that I will come back but I am glad I tried it.",A24A4C9CiKp-8snr_4JAOA,0,0,3,zot9VnEGiaO4JTOWY1Zd0g

I came in for a late meal at around 10pm and it was still quite full for the hour.  I sat at the bar and was served immediately and could watch the kitchen and the chef prepare right in front of me.  The way the restaurant works is they have a raw and cooked menu that is always available; they also have a specialty board with daily specials that are limited.  They are also pretty well known for their oyster bar and mix drinks.

I began my meal with a special sashimi platter and then went with the spicy tuna tartare. I also had a sake sampler which gave explanations and tasting notes based on the samples received.  The sashimi was on par with any other top notch sushi restaurant.  The spicy tuna tartare was exceptional.  It came with a large helping of BBQ waffle fries, which were a surprisingly perfect combo for this meal.

First off, the oysters are awesome! My favorite was the blue point which were about $1.50. We decided to order the blue soleil ($2.50) and personally didn't care for them. The wasabi cocktail and pickled pepper & habanero sauces are great. The waffle fries were good, but I feel like i can get that at any other place, but I still ordered it. Crispy and delicious, but not sure if it was worth the price. The cavier and French toast ($19) was way overrated. I felt like the French toast was way too thick for the amount of cavier they put on there. It felt like I was just eating toast and couldn't taste the cavier. What a waste of cavier. I would have just eaten the cavier with a cracker and been happy, or a thinner piece of bread or add more cavier on it? You can get decent cavier of 10g for about $30. The blue crab and jalapeño hush puppies were okay. I love blue crab, but maybe having it hush puppy style wasn't my thing. The Pork belly kimchee was not that great. I don't eat Pork, but I ate the rice. The kimchee was really sour and from what my guests have said about the Pork belly was not that special. It was tough and chewy. Maybe dry? We ordered the ceviche. I have to say it was good. I liked it and it came with sweet potato fries. Overall experience, was a huge disappointment.

Where Other Mama falls apart for me is the service (on this visit).  It was abysmal.  The bartender was horrible (I sat at the bar).  She didn't ever actually take my order.  I guess I was fortunate the chef walked by regularly or I might not have eaten tonight.

It began with her discussing her inability to settle an $80 debt with another member of staff.  It continued with her doing a lot of side work and never checking back with me.  I would have ordered more food if anyone had truly cared.  Additionally, I would have left a 25% or greater gratuity instead of the 15% I left just because I felt I had to leave something.

I want to love Other Mama but based upon this visit, I'm not sure what to think.  To the restaurant's credit, the bartender on my last visit was the epitome of an F&B professional.  This one was unforgivably bad.",lWeTtxym6jZztQcumO1f0w,1,0,3,LXPhDIvDAbBh-R5X9T80ZQ

You won't meet a friendlier group willing to tell their story. Led by Dan Krohmer, a chef who trained under Morimoto, their team is producing Strip-quality food and cocktails for off-Strip prices without cutting corners. Advertised as a raw bar, you'll find, among other things, oysters with impeccable scratch-made sauces and an amberjack crudo topped with a ponzu salsa. If you're a fan of chicken wings, their spicy yuzu wings will blow you away. A light, crispy southern fried exterior is a great contrast to the succulent meat underneath and each bite finishes with a restrained amount of heat. Always a sucker for pork, the pork belly kimchi fried rice was calling my name. Arriving piping hot, the bowl is full of large chunks of savory meat, spicy kimchi, rice and a fried egg topping it all. Even sorbets are made in house, with flavors changing regularly. Their strawberry red wine sorbet was a silky, sweet way to end a great meal. Their cocktails are equally as good. Their mixologist, David English, is doing some cool stuff with more house-made ingredients.

Calling restaurants ""chef-driven"" has become a cliche, but here it's the real deal. Other Mama is doing things the right way. Located in the same plaza as Zaytoon (a place I frequent regularly), this strip mall might turn into my home away from home.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,19,16,5,EFqrVj3RLZEw45jNwGYQZQ

oysters, sashimi and creatively hand crafted cocktails. Fish flown here daily is what I learned.

The restaurant had a casual, relaxed atmosphere and is small so I would suggest making reservations. We sat at the bar and it was the best seats for us as the open kitchen is in front of you. I like the showcase of an array of oysters on a bed of ice.

It's not easy to tastefully buildout a place in a Vegas strip mall without breaking the bank. Other Mama reminds me of the myriad of places in European cities that are a labor of love by the Chef/Owner. Beautiful ambiance for a date or night out with friends. 

Then came the menu...also a very unique thing compared to what we are used to. Basically the menu is made up of raw selection (oysters, sashimi etc.), small plates perfect for sharing tapas style, select entrees and daily specials. We hit a number of expertly prepared small plates and one of the specials: Chicken Fried Lobster. It was excellent as were the accompanying grilled pork belly, Kimchi fried rice and Shishito peppers with cauliflower and pistachios. Everything was excellent 

We ended a great evening with some desert. The homemade walnut brownie was superb. The rice pudding was not to my taste but you can tell it's homemade and delivered with love. The Japanese cheese cake is nothing like you imagine - more sponge cake than New York cheese cake - but it is phenomenal. Light and very tasty.

3591745,2015-04-09,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Don't worry Other Mama, I'm still coming back!

If I could rate this place just on oysters alone, I'd give it 5 stars. The drinks were created with creativity and personal attention. Mixoligist David Steven Stephen English told us all about the restaurant and the concept that Chef Krohmer was aiming for as he handcrafted our drinks for us. And while the chef and owner has succeeded in some areas, others will hopefully improve with time.

Let's talk about the good first - the Oysters. The daily oyster selection is posted on the specials board. The prices are extremely fair ($1, $1.50, $2) for different varieties. They were extremely crisp and fresh tasting and the sauces added a lot to the flavor as well, even though they aren't necessary. I had literally nothing bad to say to this point.

So why am I giving it three stars for now? I think primarily it was the fact that we had a lot of trouble finishing the Chirashi Bowl - and don't get me wrong, we weren't stuffed or anything, it just lacked in both flavor and texture. The rice was overly bland - it couldn't help carry the delicate flavor of fish because it lacked in vinegar flavor. Most of the fish was decent, but the Ikura was severely deflated and/or popped. They looked unattractive and didn't taste any better.

Another dish that disappointed for me was the Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice. Now I get that you're trying to tone the kimchi flavor down to please the taste buds not so familiar with traditional Korean kimchi (thus, Fusion?), but the flavor just wasn't there. I mean I'm Korean and I've had kimchi fried rice probably 50 times in my life, and I wouldn't have put the word kimchi in the title. If you're going to put Kimchi Fried Rice in the name, I feel like you're going to have to risk the kimchi being a little strong. That being said, the mushrooms were a great addition, and the pork belly was really nicely done, if only lacking a bit of flavor. I wasn't a fan of how they were sitting on the side, almost as if an aside to the dish. I think I'd love it if it was chopped in and cooked with the rice to push that texture throughout the dish. If they can incorporate a little stronger flavor in this dish, it'll be amazing.

For me, the Yuzu Chicken Wings were the most intriguing of the dishes I had. The light airy and yet crispy texture was unlike any that I've had to that point. However, as others have said before, I didn't taste Yuzu in the otherwise delicious sauce.

Another disappointment for us was the Japanese Cheesecake - others had described it as fluffy and delicate - but to me it was thick and dense. What it was, however, was not overly creamy or heavy, which I do appreciate. However, the texture didn't really come out the way I think was intended. I did enjoy the overall flavor of the dessert though.

I love the decor and the atmosphere that they've created here. The staff was friendly, and the Chef was kind enough to talk to us and allow us to voice our opinions on his food. I'm actually looking forward to trying more of his food in hopes that it can reverse some of the impressions we got during our first visit. That being said, we're already coming back for oysters, and probably all the time.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,4,3,3,iiCbKltgSElcIMB96mg-Jg

My first impression: wow, the artwork on the walls are pretty cool. And that open kitchen is so unique. The ambience of the place was nice, but it is a small little spot. I had the impression that this place was Italian but when reading the menu I felt like they were more of a seafood/ sushi place. 

My boyfriend's the one who took me here. So I let him order. 

He ordered 
- 2 orders of salmon sashimi 
- 1 order of raw scallop sashimi 
- kimchi fried rice 
-calamari 

LET ME TELL YOU!! The scallop sashimi was PERFECT. It melted so softly in my mouth with a bomb of beautiful flavors. If I could order 20 of those I would (but this place is pretty pricey) 
And the kimchi fried rice snuck up on me with how flavorful it was. I'm warning you that at the first bite it was sour... but when you take a bite of it with the meat. The flavors made sense! -- these were the foods that stood out most to me. 

The only downside I had to say was that it was pretty warm in there. Not sure if it's because we were seated at the bar close to the open kitchen, but I tended to fan myself a lot because of the heat.

3855272,2018-02-28,1,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"On our way home from Las Vegas, my boyfriend and I stopped at Other Mama for Happy Hour -- available daily from 5pm-6pm and 10pm-11pm. Interesting hours, considering they're only open from 5pm-11pm... Apparently, though, last call is 15 minutes before Happy Hour ends. Quite restrictive... 

From the Yelp pictures (and Yelp's categorization of Other Mama as a ""Sushi Bar""), we expected to see a sushi menu. At the very least, we thought we'd find the blue crab-caviar-asparagus hand roll that's being used as Other Mama's main picture on Yelp. 

But nope! Imagine our surprise when the server dropped the truth on us -- there is no sushi rice made here at all. Thus, no nigiri. No hand rolls or cut rolls. Only fresh sashimi and crudo dishes, such as fluke, ocean trout, amberjack and snapper. 

At its core, Other Mama is a raw bar. In addition to sashimi, the place specializes in oysters, artfully prepared seafood dishes, and a handful of hot appetizers. The pictures on the Yelp page are simply outdated. The menu has undergone a massive overhaul within the last couple of years, but those sushi pictures have consistently remained up-voted to the top. 

Here's what we ordered...

CEVICHE for $8
- Mix of octopus, shrimp, white fish and habanero. 
- Side of house-made sweet potato chips. 
- Great blend of fish, nicely complements the sauce. 
- Good size for two people to share. 

UNI OYSTER IKURA for $8
- One piece per order of sea urchin and salmon egg, served on a small oyster half shell. 
- They rotate which oysters they use. We got Kusshi Oysters from British Columbia. 
- So fresh and delicious -- gone too soon. 

We only had space for a small meal, or else we  would've tried out a few of the other adventurous dishes on the menu. 

Even though we were disappointed about the rebranded menu, we have to say that everything was delicious. Pricey, but stellar. Also, Other Mama is about 20 minutes from the Strip. Out of the way, but not too far. Worth a visit, anyway!",Gx6jqH80H9-WpYjUdyj0RA,6,4,4,Oad2YxybyUNyzE2SZnpARQ

Other Mama

If you are looking for something different, this is your place. 
For example, I had a fresh oyster, topped with uni and ikura. ..what a creative combination!  
Next, I had a Crab and Caviar hand roll. ..wow...I enjoyed the crab flavor, didn't taste too much caviar, but noticed a slight ""kick"" in it - that was fun! 
Then, had uni, nigiri style...yum! Don't you agree that uni is like butter from the ocean? 
Last, but not least, I had half a dozen NY Prime Oysters. I got a chance to select 2 dipping sauces so I picked Honey Lemon and Ponzu...  great variations for enhanced oyster experience! 

The above 4 items were some of the specials of the day. There were more items on the regular menu and I understand that those change once in a while. 

They service was excellent - maybe because I sat at the counter.  The ambiance was intimate and quiet. I imagine that it could get busy later in the evening as I had gone close to opening time. I liked the free parking and the cute decorations inside the restaurant!

I'm looking forward to another visit here and have other gastronomic adventures! !",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,16,20,5,XpCljR6jr3kggNb-ANLs6A

While the hot dishes are terrific and help create a more balanced meal, the raw bar dishes and specials are the stars.  The scallops and the surf clams were perfectly fresh (rotating specials), and the amberjack crudo had accompaniments to best take advantage of the fish's unique taste and texture.

Both bartenders/mixologists we have met are knowledgeable and we were almost as pleased with the dealer's choice -- both during the meal and as after-dinner -- as at a place like Herbs and Rye.

Our drink glasses sat empty many times over the course of the evening.  The food was good, but nothing really knocked our socks off (except the deviled eggs and fried oyster, that was amazing).   I think they could have larger portions and some dishes could be more hardy for the price.  I get it that they are trying to be more creative and their plating is nice, but we just had to keep ordering dishes to get full.  We had four people at our table and some plates came with three items on it.  I think, if we have four people, make the dish for four.  Charge us more if you need to.

3970025,2015-04-25,12,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I would normally rate Other Mama four stars but eating, unexpectedly, with freinds from Yelp, and the service and good fun we had with the bartender, this is a five star review.

I was just sitting at the last chair on the right side of the bar area when I saw Philip T and his wife.  I moved one seat and set next to the corner by them and that was the start of a fun dinner with good food and good conversation.

I ordered a half dozen oysters, two Fanny Bay, two Duck Island and two Beau Soleil. The two sauces I ordered were the wasabi cocktail and ponzu salsa.  Being from NY where we generally had the choice of Bluepoint or Bluepoint, it certainly is nice to have a selection to order from.  For the next course, I got the octopus carpaccio.  Then I got the pork belly kim chi fried rice.  For dessert, I opted for the Japanese cheesecake.

The oysters were wonderful.  While the sauces were both good, I think I enjoy my oysters au naturel without any sauce for the most oyster flavor.  The octopus carpaccio was a thing of beauty and very tasty.  The sauce in which the tender slices of octopus were resting was absolutely one of the tastiest I've had.  

Next, the pork belly kim chi fried rice was excellent!  It was served blisteringly hot and I recently learned my lesson about carefully moving hot, cast iron serving dishes.  I also learned how to correctly eat this dish.  Remove the pork belly, break the egg on top of the rice, and use the ladle to mix the egg into the rice and then push the rice against the sides of the bowl to get some of the rice to be crispy fried rice.  I learned this by watching Philip's wife who was a master at the technique!  Thanks!  The kim chi is homemade.  It could stand to be spicier for my taste but it was very good.  I finished the meal with Japanese cheesecake at the suggestion of my server, Grazzy!  A good ending to a very good meal.

Not only was the food good, but the service was good also and we had a show by sitting at the bar.  It was interesting to watch the bartender making some exotic drinks including one he made up on the spot.  If you read the drink section of their menu, you read some of the exotic ingredients in their cocktails.  The top shelf of one cabinet behind the bar held a number of jars with his concoctions (I say that in a nice manner) that are used to make different drinks.  He also gave Philip and me a piece of watermelon rind so we could taste what was in the drink of Philip's wife.  The rind had been softening in a blend of his that contained one habanero pepper.  That one pepper was enough to give the rind a spicy afterburner taste, not enough to bother you, but enough to let you know it was there.  Watching him do his thing and chatting with him truly was a show of his craft at cocktail mixing.

In about two hours, I left knowing I'd be back.  The oysters are so good and are priced very reasonably.  There are other menu items I have to try.  Some many choices, so few days in a week!

One final word.  The music was outstanding.  It was as if they had hired me to put their music track together.  Sorry millennials, it's my kind of music!  :)",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,18,18,5,VZKpvF1K9m6ILZmuh2JiRQ

Walked in and immediately had a flashback to the time I was at Yonaka. No Japanese patron found and place was packed with haole. Usually that's not a good sign for me but I always give the benefit of the doubt. First thing I noticed was how smoky the place was. There seems to be no ventilation of any sort but surprisingly, no one seemed bothered by it.  Atmosphere is  dark and intimate, perfect for the dinner occasion I was at. 

Started out with some oysters which are part of the special. They were fresh and plump. My favorite has to be their little skookum oysters which were really sweet and fresh. 

Grilled branzino with sweet potato. Holy moly. Grilled and seasoned perfectly. Fish was boneless and was grilled with lemons and bunch of different herbs. 

Waffle fries. The dipping sauce was bomb.com! It was a creamy aeoli sauce with some tangyness and was perfect with their crispy waffle fries.

*From here, I was a little intoxicated and don't remember the exact name of each dish

Also tried their spicy salmon roll with lemon and caviar. At first, I thought slices of lemon they had in between each roll was just for a presentation but I ate it with the rolls and wow. Flavor parade.  I guess it is good to be intoxicated while trying something new because you get to be adventurous. Lesson learned.

Steamed mussels in a pot. It was a recommended dish but turned out to be ok. Mussels were small and nothing mind blowing.

Other mama is cute and little. There's only about 6 tables and a bar. The menu is relatively small but there were also 9 specials on the board. 

From start to finish, we had great service. They use the team approach - which is nice. Everyone is helping you instead of you looking for your server. They were very attentive and knowledgeable. 

I ordered the Francesca for a cocktail. It was described as pear and cinnamon vodka with basil, lime, and bitters. It tasted like lime juice and nothing else. So, they made me a new one. It was certainly better than the first but not as dreamy as the description sounded. 

We got lots of food - live scallop from the special board, mushroom tempura, spicy yuzu chicken wings, oysters with mignonette and ponzu salsa, ny steak and whole grilled Branzino and the chocolate pot de creme. Everything was tasty. Nothing was awe inspiring. Unfortunately, I don't feel the need to say, ""you have to go to try the....""
Again, no real complaints, all tasty, just nothing that really stood out. Some nit picky notes: the Branzino was under seasoned and the steak lacked flavor/pizazz. Everything was cooked nicely. I missed the flavored promised by the descriptions here too. I didn't get yuzu in the wings, I didn't taste miso or hollandaise on the steak, just a warm sauce. The fries were delightful. The assorted mushroom tempura was fun and yummy! The oysters were perfectly briny. 

So $161 for dinner for two. We did have some food leftover. For an $80 dinner, I'd hope to be singing from the rooftops. Not the case. However, not disappointed either.

The ambiance: more New England than Asian, it feels cool and unique.

The service: friendly, casual, and helpful.

The drinks: great cocktail menu. I tried the bobbie-jo (I think), and it was my usual - gin, cucumber, refreshing. I also had the celina (or something like that??) and it was very cinnamon-y spice-y with a house-infused whiskey and candied ginger. Really liked them both. There is also a short beer list (10ish) and about 15 wines.

The food: awesome! We had some raw oysters (blue points and beau soleils), oysters Rockefeller with foie gras, kim chee fried rice, tuna tartare, Japanese uni, and the chef's choice sashimi. All were good. I always love raw oysters, and especially liked the oysters Rockefeller. The tuna tartare was a really big portion, served with spicy waffle fries, and the fried rice was pretty big too - came with pork belly and a fried egg. I'm not an uni eater, but my husband really loves it, and he said this was some of the best he's had.

Go to Other Mama because of the food.  So, it goes without saying, that the food and drink offerings are unique, fresh, refreshing, creative and delicious.  Dan (the owner or one of the owners) is on to something different in the valley and special.  Go because you want to support Dan, his team and his culinary creativity designed for the Las Vegas local.  Know that you have to like fresh seafood, oysters, sushi type stuff, ceviche, etc....this is what they are good at and thus the raw bar concept.  

But just when you think that is all they are serving, there is kim chi and roasted shishito peppers that are really spectacular amongst other creative offerings.  There is a huge chalkboard of their daily fresh fish offerings and specials that alone is a feast for the eyes.  

Go to Other Mama because of English.  He is a server.  Jovial, tall, really happy to be working at Other Mama and equally passionate about the food and atmosphere of the place.  It is refresing to see serving staff who have risen to the level of loving where they work because they too believe it is great.  English was attentive and friendly and led up down a great evening experience of their best culinary offerings.  He did not stear us wrong and quite honestly, set the tone for our entire evening. 

Go to Other Mama because of the music.  So opening at 5PM and staying open late, it is clear they are catering to an industry crowd in many ways.  With that, they have thought hard about their uber cool playlist being pumped into the restaurant.  Capital Cities, Empire of the Sun, some deadmau5, a little Cold Play....it would be what I would choose to listen to and adds to the cool, clean, hip vibe I felt inside. 

I will absolutley be back and encourage others to go to!",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,2,1,5,9L_QjQCrwBEfZPv_GvtLcQ
4072647,2018-03-26,2,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I have certainly had better, especially at these prices. 

Fried lobster, grilled branzino, salmon sashimi salad, deviled eggs, tuna sashimi, and a cocktail for $105. Was i satisfied when i left? Not really, as i have had far better meals for half the price for two. The best of the dishes for me was the deviled eggs at $11, but Carson's Kitchen's eggs are better and for less money. The grilled branzino was the typical preparation of lemon and rosemary in the center and grilled which i do myself at home, so i expect to have something a bit more when i come to a restaurant known for creativity? Salmon salad was, just ok as i didn't feel like the greens added much if anything to the small cuts of salmon. Yonaka does a salmon with micro greens with larger cuts of fish and more balance, and again for less money. Fried lobster was tasty, but as another mentioned certainly not worth the price tag for the size of the serving. 

I think there is a theme to my review, which is i see/taste your food and i have had better and for less elsewhere. I will pay the money for the right meal and return regularly at that, but this was one of those meals that left me feeling unsatisfied. Maybe the happy hour gets a lot of play, and that's where a lot of the hype comes from so maybe give that a look. But for my dinner on this night, it just wasn't working for me.

When you first enter, there is an open kitchen where you can see where the food is made and an array of oysters on a bed of ice. So I thought the service was okay, our waiter didn't seem like she was too knowledgable about the menu but its okay the food made up for it. 
I can't even fathom which dish I liked the best but I will name a few that stood out for me.
Oysters are a must. It def reminded me of the oysters in Seattle. I haven't found one in town that were just as good as the oysters there until I came to Other Mama. 
Spicy Tuna Tartare with waffle fries I loved the texture of the waffle fries with the softness of the tuna tartare. It was a great combination.

It would be considered an incredible hole-in-the-wall because it's a small restaurant in a shopping center, and inside it's a dimly litted charming spot with a very local feel. The inside and the vibe is really great, everyone I take there comments how they love the feel of the place. The executive chef & owner, Dan Krohmer, did such a great job with this restaurant. The menu consists of small appetizers and entrees that are very sharable as well as a raw bar which they are known for. The sushi is good, they only do sashimi though for their sushi options, and I do wish they also did rolls or nigiri. The cocktails are also very unique, the tequila cocktail is my favorite.

4151049,2017-10-15,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"We came in as a group for a bachelorette dinner for the tasting menu. We all left stuffed and completely not ready for a night of clubbing (a nap wouldn't been preferable). 

Drinks- I tried the Billie Joe, a gin and cucumber concoction (very nice and surprisingly refreshing) and others tried the Penelope, a sake and pomegranate drink (an upgrade on the sweet girly drink). The bride to be got the drink pairing with the tasting menu -- it included sake (which she wouldn't share because it was apparently too tasty) and a glass each of a red (Malbec) and white (Pinot Grigio) that we're equally good. 

Food- 
-spicy tuna tartare with waffle fries: the fries were more like waffle chips, but man were they good. I ate way too many. Very tasty combo. Just the right amount of spicy!
- ceviche with sweet potato chips: similar in presentation to the tartare, this was a fresh and less heavy alternative. This was probably the favorite for our table (for the entire dinner).
- sashimi combination: surprisingly fresh! I'm spoiled by LA sushi, and this definitely stood up to my standards. Gave me an opportunity to try fish I don't normally get (like amberjack)
- shishito, cauliflower and pistachio: we had a nut allergy so missed on the pistachios. I love roasted shishito peppers, so I enjoyed these, but they weren't particularly innovative like the rest of the menu. 
- Rhode Island calamari: sweet calamari. Tasty on its own, but didn't fit with the rest of the tasting menu :( might be biased since this was one of the last fried appetizers brought out so we were a little tired of *fried* at this point. I, personally, would've liked it better with some spicy kick.
- Blue crab hush puppies: I could eat crab for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so I could be biased, but I loved these. I also ate an entire plate by myself. Once again, fried :(
- deviled egg and fried oyster: I don't like deviled eggs and at this point I was taking a break from eating so I didn't try. The tables consensus was that they were ok. None of us are deviled egg people. 
- seasonal tempura: it was just tempura. Good tempura, but not something that will bring me back to other mama on its own. Also....fried.
- roasted cauliflower: Love. I've been thinking about this roasted cauliflower all week. I also think I ate the entire shared plate of this....
- prime NY steak and more waffle fries! : very tasty steak. Fit nicely with their waffle fry chips. 
- whole grilled fish + sweet potatoes: this was different for me, but very moist and flavorful. I'd choose this over the steak again. 
- kim chee fried rice: I normally love kim chee fried rice, but I it was a little heavy on onion for my taste.

I will definitely be coming back! Thank you for the wonderful dinner!",1V-hqYtFS9fIIYvCvInEdQ,1,0,5,9M2tpgp4oWZ9LdE6HFtnuQ

4200945,2015-09-05,1,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Heard great things from our friends so decided to give a try.

First impression the place looked cool, love the look and feel of the restaurant.  We had to wait close to an hour when there were only 2 small parties ahead of us which was frustrating.  To add to the frustration of waiting they don't have anywhere for you to sit while you wait so you're kind of just stuck walking or standing around til they call you.

The hostess was slow.  When she finally told us she'd clean off a spot at the bar for us to sit, that took her another 10 minutes.

Our server came (not promptly) and we ordered a dozen oysters and the hush puppies to start.  Hush puppies not worth the money, come with a bland sauce, nothing special.  Then never saw our waiter again.  We ordered the ribeye dish from the busser that kept passing by.  That dish was AMAZING and probably the only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars.  Meat cooked perfect, the sauce on top was awesome, and came with really yummy waffle fries.

We sat and waited around about 20 more minutes after our meal was finished.  As the hostess passed us, I asked for her help getting the bill.  She then walked around aimlessly for 10-15 more minutes, never told our waiter we wanted our bill... Let's just say by the time he FINALLY realized we still existed we were more than ready to get out of there.  We realized why it took so long to get seated... Because they take so long to take care of the guests that already have a seat.

Disappointed because they have an awesome menu and awesome food and really cool vibe... Decor, music... But the service was just terrible.  

Fortunately this is something they can fix easily and this place would be an awesome spot we'd love to come back to if the staff were ever replaced or retrained.",2quguRdKBzul3GpRi9e1mA,0,0,3,D1m-b1x_8ha7oJdaRAYm1Q

One word...Uni

Their Uni is delish! I could have eaten the whole thing. It was that delicious. It was sweet, creamy and just amazing. 

Other than that I thought everything was good like the salmon poke which was a little bit spicy. The oysters were good. The honey lemon paired well with the oysters and even my husband liked it even though it sounded weird. We also tried the hush puppy crab cakes, which was just ok and the flat iron steak which was done well. Overall, this place is good for a limited menu. I wish there was more warm foods as it was a cold day. I could have ordered the fried rice but I was more in the mood for white rice. I'm Asian and I'm used to some kind of warm carbs. The one thing I was not a fan of was the French toast caviar entree. Maybe caviar isn't my cup of tea but I didn't like it at all. 

The quality of everything was great and service was excellent as well. It did start to get busier so I noticed more and more employees came to start their shift. I ended the night with the miso honey ice cream which was ok. It's definitely not my cup of tea but my husband loved the iced coffee ice cream.

It's a small restaurant you have to stumble upon on Yelp, because it's not in a very popping plaza/location nor is it very welcoming from the outside. However, once you're inside you'll feel like you're no longer in Vegas. It has an open kitchen, welcoming decor and a great bar. On my one visit alone I saw a couple of guys here on their own just for the Happy Hour and to talk to the bartenders. It's one of those places! 
The food is seafood/sushi/bar food? It's an interesting mix. They had parts of their menu written in Japanese on the wall, however it doesn't have the atmosphere for me to want to eat sushi. 
We went with the spicy tuna tartare and waffle fries, calamari, oysters, a couple of drinks and the whole fish. All were really great, but I enjoyed the calamari the most. The whole fish was filling and deboned (YES, no digging for bones), but came out a little too burnt for my liking. Ask for it to be a little less charred! :)

So my search for great off-the-strip cuisine continued with Other Mama. Although the drive is a bit further out that I expected, the restaurant is fantastic. 

+First off, service was SUPER friendly and awesome. Thank you to all the staff who really were quite nice and helpful including (apologies if I get your names wrong) Brittany - the sashimi master, David - the skilled mixologist, and Julie - the Puzzle Fighter aficionado.  Loved how at the bar, you have a full view of the way the kitchen runs and the bar. Love also the interaction/super chill atmosphere (definitely on the darker side indoors).  
+Food-wise, the Happy Hour had about 10 unique items to try out along with HH $1 oysters for the later night crowd. I ate WAY too much but had a lot of the items here so counting them down below (about $8-10 each):

*Octopus Ceviche & Spicy Tuna Tartare: Starting off with both of these first because they came in last when I should have stopped eating. Think both were really interesting takes. Something to note is that the Waffle Fries are more reminiscent of chips. Personally, I preferred the sweet potato chips (and although full, I think I preferred the Octopus Ceviche) but not too bad overall. 
*Amberjack: A great try to get a taste of their raw selection. Really good quality fish in a sashimi style presentation. 
*Calamari: The calamari was very solid and was very surprised it didn't come with an aioli sauce of some kind. In the end, it didn't need any sauce because the calamari was super flavorful and spiced well. 
*Deviled Eggs: The fried oyster on top of the deviled eggs were fantastic and think this stood out as my favorite dish of the bunch. Very memorable. 
*Their house wines and a few beers are also on happy hour pricing for about $5 as a heads-up. I did get one of their cocktails, which I believe was the Vivian. Delicious and surprisingly strong with unique spirits to boot. Definitely worth a look-see. 

 (The full dinner menu definitely seems to be full of really fascinating and more full takes on the HH menu - something I can't wait to try in the future.)
+On a Saturday evening, it wasn't too busy when I went although I did call ahead to RSVP just in case. There's both plentiful bar and table seating. Parking-wise, there was a private lot. 

+/- One random note, if you do have a Lyft/Uber driver looking for the place or driving yourself, at least in the late afternoon, the sign was a little hard to read. When you go into the plaza, just make sure to take your time and look near the end of the plaza after going in to find the location. 

Hope to come back again to take on the full dinner menu. Cheers Other Mama.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,4,2,5,EylEscA2looYPFdcxL9bQg

My friends and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few weeks now and finally made plans to go! I was really looking forward to it and went with an empty stomach and high expectations. 

The ambiance is very comfortable; dimly lit with a modern-hipster feel to it. The cooks prepare the food in the back (in an open area) so you can watch all of the the cooking action! 

The menu is small and they have a chalkboard wall with the daily specials. We didn't hold back and splurged on a variety of dishes to share:

Caviar & French Toast 
- A combination that you wouldn't think would work but was one of my favorite dishes. There is something strangely delicious about the sweetness of the French toast and the saltiness of the caviar. After one bite, you want 10 more

Amberjack (Yellowtail) Crudo topped with Ponzu Salsa
- My other favorite dish. Raw Yellowtail. Soft, fresh, and very refreshing - doused in something both sweet and sour

Oysters Foie Rockefeller
- Baked oysters topped with Foie Gras. Warm deliciousness that melts in your mouth. Rich in flavor and creamy... My third time trying Foie Gras and it keeps getting better 

Octopus Carpaccio
- My first time trying raw octopus and it was different! A little chewy but I can say I enjoyed it. Our server said it's alive until the chef prepares it. Now if this is true, that is some FRESH carpaccio... 

Duck Creek and Blue Point Raw Oysters
- Ordered the Wasabi Cocktail and Pickled Pepper and Habanero sauce which were unique and very tasty! As I'm a huge fan of oysters, these were a must. The Blue Point was better of the two IMO

Panko Fried Clams
- Juicy clams with just the right amount of fried batter on them. The tarter dipping sauce was on point too 

Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice
- The only menu item I didn't care for. It wasn't bad, but my expectations for Korean food are on another level. This dish just didn't quite meet them. I love ripe Kimchi, don't get me wrong, but the Kimchi in this fried rice was a wee bit too sour...

Jameson Ginger Sorbet and Viet Coffee Ice Cream
- Both were incredibly flavorful desserts and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal!

Beryl
- I couldn't indulge because I was headed to work after dinner but one of my friends ordered this apricot bourbon with orange bitters. I tried a sip and wish I could have enjoyed an entire glass. If you're a whiskey sour fan, you'd really enjoy a Beryl

The service was great (friendly server and busser who frequently checked up on us) and so was the food. The portions are very small compared to the prices. (I could have inhaled 3 orders of the Amberjack Crudo) but I get it. Other Mama is a place to come for small bites, cocktails, and a tasting experience. Definitely not the place for a big ol' hearty meal. 

I enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back! I want to try the Bigeye Tuna Poke, Deviled Eggs, and Prime Ribeye Steak next time!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,13,12,4,EsuSO6LzDj3Vek8Sjm_0Og

This is the place to go if you like oysters and don't want to go to the Strip. Very small place so either get there early or make reservations. We had a little bit of everything. Oyster sampler was fantastic. They let you mix-and-match. They have a specials board so be sure to check that out. We also had the Octopus Carpaccio, Shrimp and Jalapeño Hush Puppies, Asparagus Tempura, and French Toast with Caviar (I know....but it kinda worked). Make sure you try the ""Bessie"" cocktail and the ""Aunt Opal"" if you like things on the spicy side. Service was great and we didn't have to wait on anything. There were a few minor flaws such as the Hush Puppies being a little overdone and the Carpaccio needing just a pinch of salt but nothing to detract from the 5-Star rating.

4573318,2015-07-14,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"This is an excellent oyster restaurant - it is NOT a good sushi restaurant.  If you love oysters, you will be in heaven at this spot.  This is a must try spot for oysters.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.

I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).

I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.  They do have an excellent draft beer selection and I found that tasted better with the oysters.  The next time I go I am just going to order oysters and beer and it will be a 5 star experience.

The waffle fries are almost worth ordering on its own and will go well with anything.  I guess to help narrow down some choices, you can probably skip on the ceviche, it was good but not memorable.

We ordered the ceviche, chicken fried lobster, and the PBR hot pot. Let me tell you something about this ceviche... IT WAS THE BOMB. Seriously, the best ceviche I've ever had and I've had plenty. The sweet potato chips add a unique flavor to the dish. The quality of the seafood used was spectacularly fresh! The chicken fried lobster was fried to perfection. I should've ordered a side of rice with it because it wasn't really filling lol. My bf really enjoyed his hot pot. I'm not really a fan of alcohol in my food so I didn't like that dish very much. The seafood in it was cooked perfectly though! 

The servers & the sous chef at the bar were so attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back & this time with a reservation!

4701572,2015-04-04,19,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"OMG, what an AMAZING meal! Ruben and I agree that it was one of the best meals we've had. It's rare that I'm truly excited about so much in one place, but Other Mama is killing it.

I was intrigued by the menu, especially the raw bar. I love raw seafood. Then, I hear that Owner/Chef Dan Krohmer used to work for Morimoto and I'm really interested. I had to check it out right away.

We sat at the bar and chatted with Mixologist David English about the restaurant and mostly about the amazing Libations menu he created with another gentleman. I started with the Vera ($10) composed of Domaine Chandon, Canton Ginger Basil, and St. Germain Elderflower. Fabulous cocktail. As the night wore on, I also tried the Agnes ($9) with Hibiscus Stolichnaya, Cointreau, lemon, and sparkling wine. First of all, it's gorgeous and second, it's delicious. Another home run. English also created an off-the-menu cocktail for me consisting of vodka and fresh cucumber. It complemented some of the seafood I was eating.

The food, oh boy. Summed up: GOOD. REALLY GOOD. Favorites: Live Scallop, Amberjack Crudo, and Grilled Prime Ribeye. I could eat all these dishes again and again. But really, everything is delicious. I can't wait to try everything else!

Raw Oysters: Fanny Bay from BC ($1.50/each), Bluepoint from NY ($1/each), and NY Prime from NY ($2/each). Served with Ponzu Salsa, Blood Orange Mint, and Pickled Peppers & Habañero. Nice selections. I typically avoid East Coast oysters, but these were pleasantly crisp and the sauces were fantastic. The Ponzu Salsa was definitely my favorite.

Live Scallop ($11): This was easily my favorite dish of the evening. The scallop was HUGE and it was phenomenal. Amazing by itself and delicious with a touch of soy sauce and wasabi. There were 3 scallops available; we had 2 of them. Hopefully they have more scallops the next time I come in!

Live Surf Clam ($13): Two parts of the clam were served separately, the meat and the flesh. This was just okay for me, but Ruben really enjoyed it. 

White Fish Ceviche ($13): Served with sweet potato chips. Fantastic ceviche and a really nice portion, too. Also, I am not a fan of sweet potato, but these chips were delicious!

Shrimp & Mint ($9): Wrapped with cucumber and topped with Ikura. Amazing!! This was easily one of our group's favorites; we couldn't get enough.

Amberjack Crudo ($11): Um, wow! I'm a fan of sashimi crudo type dishes and this one is up there. Amazing, amazing flavors. The fish was divine and the blood orange ponzu salsa was perfect. This was another group favorite.

Oyster Foi Rockefeller ($15): This was a Chef-recommended dish that I would have never ordered on my own and it blew my mind. They use freshly-shucked oysters for these delicious treats. It makes all the difference.

Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings ($13): Fried chicken is all about the batter. This batter was light and crunchy, plus it was flavorful. I didn't get the yuzu, but I liked the spicy sauce on the wings that weren't overbearing and not too spicy.

Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice ($11): Kimchi usually sucks at restaurants and I'm ultra critical of Korean food, so I was surprised that this rice was decent. **Note: I love the side order of Kimchi Fried Rice (without the pork belly). It's more my thing as it's more moist without the hot pot. Of course, I love the sunny side-up egg! 

Grilled Prime Ribeye ($27): Served with Miso Hollandaise and Waffle Fries. OH. MY. GOSH. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY, so that already got my attention. But it's the miso hollandaise that pushed it over the edge - it's GOOD. Oh, and those waffle fries? Geez.

PBR Seafood Hot Pot ($21): A delicious broth with white fish, shrimp, scallop, mussels, and bok choy. This was another unsuspecting dish that was really great. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the broth was so fragrant! Delicious.

Desserts: Chocolate Pot De Crème ($6), Japanese Cheesecake w/ Raspberry Mint Sauce ($6), and Housemade Ice Creams - Vanilla Bean, Chocolate Chili, and Vermont Maple Syrup Walnut ($2/each). The Chocolate Pot De Crème was delicious! I also enjoyed all the ice creams. I didn't like the cheesecake at first, but now, I'm a fan. It's light, almost the consistency of Angel Food Cake, but still manages to have a moist typical cake-like texture. Its subtle flavor is always paired with a perfectly sweet fruit sauce.

Service was beyond fantastic. Everyone was very nice and attentive. Waters constantly filled, drinks replenished, dishes cleared, and plates/silverware continuously replaced. What a spot! You need to get here! Best time to dine is when they open at 5pm; get a seat because it fills up quickly!

*UPDATE* Favorite dishes: White Fish Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Poke, Organic Chicken, Grilled Prime Ribeye, Kimchi Fried Rice, Chirashi, Caviar French Toast, and Beef Carpaccio w/ Uni.

Favorite ice cream/sorbet flavors: Miso Honey, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Jameson & Ginger.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,33,27,5,PC2LZvxla6ueSnDqZfga9A
4702025,2018-06-18,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"First off my family really enjoys this establishment. The atmosphere is nice the food is wonderful. My grievances with this establishment is the waiter that took care of us on Father's Day. He made the unfortunate mistake of spilling 3 drinks on my wife, soaking her. Her entire purse and all of its contents got wet. My poor mother was scrubbing in and outside of my wife's purse. All her belongings were out on the table as she had to wipe everything down. Her clothes and even underwear was drenched. The waiter was not apologetic nor did the other staff seem to care about what had just happened. This was at 5pm so it wasn't very busy. They did not have a sense of urgency to assist a patron of their establishment who was drenched. It was unfortunate that the customer service was lacking. Proceed later on that night, My wife was somewhat cleaned up and her new very expensive purse was ruined. The food arrived which was great as usual. As the night ended and the bill arrived, nothing was comped or even slightly discounted considering the discomfort my wife had throughout the night. I had to talk to the manager, who comped a few desserts, but was not nearly appropriate for what had happened earlier. I was just very disappointed at how things were taken care of, especially for the fact that we have been coming to this establishment many times. I hope that the management staff reads this review and teaches their waiters and other staff more appropriate customer service.

If I were to just rate on ambiance alone, it would definitely receive more stars, but a restaurant needs more than just decor to be a great place to eat.  There really were not that many people enjoying dinner, a couple large groups some people at the sushi bar, and others scattered about.  I did notice a few open 4 tops that were open and a couple 2 tops that were extremely code to one another, almost bistro style.  My significant other and I were seated at one of the two tops which literally was inches away from a women waiting for her date to arrive. We placed our drink orders and the woman's date showed up. I realize that this restaurant cannot really be held responsible for an overly rowdy couple on a date, but when there are several open seats, you would think placing people inches from one another could be avoided.  Our server was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a few different plates to share and one entry that our server recommended was the PBR Hot Pot. Prior to the PBR Hot Pot, we explained that it was my significant others birthday and apparently this restaurant does nothing to celebrate at all, as nothing was offered.  When the pot arrived we were informed that it was hot. 

We instantly noticed a rancid smell and it seemed to be coming from the pot. It actually smells like sewage. We thought for sure we were mistaken and decided to try the steaming pot of what could potentially be either the worst or best thing we have ever tried, after a few sips of the broth, we tried the shrimp, I took one bite and had to put the rest on a plate, it did not taste that great. I thought I would give it one more shot and took one bite of the mussel and almost vomited! I actually had to excuse myself and make a quick exit to the bathroom where I spit the disgusting food into the toilet. I tried rinsing the nasty taste out of my mouth but to no avail. Once back to the table, my significant other and I decided that we were pretty disgusted by the last dish and ordered nothing else. I would say within 45 mins to an hour we both started feeling ill, upset stomachs which resulted to several trips to the bathroom, thankfully there are a few at home to use. 

The day after our visit we were both still frequenting our toilets and could not shake the upset stomach that resulted in that disgusting ""hot pot"" 

I would not recommend this place to anyone and even shared my experience with several friends. 

Because I have been sick for the entire evening of our visit and the complete following day and night afterwards, I cannot rate this higher than a 1, food poisoning is not fun.",r0rbHEB7kWJKhzweCOeyeQ,6,3,1,BvzmsrTpdj_BEnrWty-uzg

The restaurant and menu itself looks very hipster, like it belongs downtown.  Crowd was primarily young ""foodies"".  Great atmosphere and we got good service.  
The Ribeye with miso hollandaise.. I swear we got a flat iron streak instead, which is fine, but I don't think I got ribeye as advertised.  The miso hollandaise was savory with the hint of miso flavor, not overpowering.  The meat had a perfect sear, nice char on the outside and cooked a perfect medium inside.
My favorite: Octopus Carpaccio... The Octopus was so fresh and sliced perfectly and had that puffed up texture you can only get with a recently live octopus.  The sauce was a light chili and oil.. It was absolutely delicious!  
Least favorite: Grass Fed beef carpaccio... Had these nori Parmesan crisps that did not go with the dish.. Besides that, the dish was warm.  I don't like my carpaccio warm.
Must try: Ceviche.  Tender pieces of seafood marinated and paired with sweet potato chips which you think is an odd combo but went very very well together.
Also, on the suggestion of the server, had a few selections of fresh oysters.. The Zen was a briny sea explosion in my mouth highlighted with a mignonette.  
Docking a star because they did not have the Caviar and French toast which initially was the original reason I wanted to try this restaurant, and also while their cocktails were decent, they did not amaze me.

My dinner last night was....f*cking epic (can you type f*cking on yelp?). And to think I almost missed out by not coming back! I think sometimes it's important to admit that we carry our personal issues with us to the restaurant and maybe flavor the food with our own saltiness. I'll admit the last time I came here the company I brought with me was lame and I might have let it ruin my dinner. Shrug. None of us are perfect. But last nights dinner showed me that there's magic in second chances because simply put this was one of the best dinners I've had in Vegas, on or off the strip.

I've had ""Other Mama"" bookmarked for weeks and finally got the opportunity to stop by with my favorite girl. 

This seafood sushi fusion restaurant is pretty small but cozy probably accommodates 50 people max.

I arrived in time for Happy Hour which is my favorite dirty word!! Reservations recommended although I was able to walk right in. I love the open kitchen bar seating because you can observe the cooks creating masterpieces. The service is fast and the servers are extremely efficient and polite.

What We Ordered:
Spicy Tuna Tartare W/Waffle Fries 
-Not spicy but fresh and definitely flavorful. I'm a French fry fanatic so I appreciated this fusion.
Shishito, Cauliflower & Pistachio: 
-The cauliflower was pretty bland & served in tiny pieces almost mike crumbs 
Hush Puppies W/Blue Crab Jalapeño 
-Served nice and hot! Pretty delicious 
Rhode Island Calamari, Hollandaise Pickled Pepper
-Best Calamari I've devoured in a while. Crisp golden brown and equally delicious. 
Kimchi Fried Rice (W/O Pork)
-The Kimchi rice was my favorite dish hands down. I love Kimchi and this rice did not disappoint. I love the chef stayed true the authentic Kimchi taste!
Chicken Fried Lobster
-I was pretty full close to full by this time none the less the Lobster was great and the presentation was awesome!
Sashimi 
-Another fresh delicious dish
Honey Miso Ice Cream
-Highly recommended by a server and this ice cream did not disappoint!

There were two tables sat and two people at the bar in the whole restaurant. Anyway, my sisters had been here previously and had the $1 oysters so we were expecting to get a bunch of those. Our server was a lady and we didn't quite get her name. My friend asked for a certain beer and they didn't have it. My two sisters wanted the grapefruit beer but they only had one bottle left so they had to share it. There were no $1 oysters on the board so we were quite disappointed. We ended up getting an assortment of 18 oysters that were $2.50 each, you have to order by 6. they were really good oysters with pretty good sauces. My husband and I got the hot pot and the pork belly kimchi fried rice. The hot pot was pretty small for $21 and wasn't as good as I thought it was gonna be. They also had these bowls that stuck to the table so almost everyone of us, including our server ended up tipping it over. The kimchi fried rice was the highlight of our night. Really flavorful and the pork belly was nice and tender. Our table also ordered the deviled eggs, oyster Rockefeller, and chicken wings. The deviled eggs and oyster Rockefeller were pretty tasty. We were nearly done with everything when my sister asked our server when the chicken wings will be ready. She had a look on her face but quickly said it should be out any minute now. It came out about 10-15 minutes later confirming our suspicions that they forgot. Chicken wings finally came out and I grabbed one to split with my husband, they were whole chicken wings. It was pretty bloody so I told them to check all the wings and 2 out of 4 was bloody so we told our server. She said that that's how it is and that it's safe to eat. It was too red for us so we ended up just not eating it. With all that said, we don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. I really wanted to love the place because of all the great reviews and hype but I think it fell a little short on both food and service.

Now, I don't know why we ordered the steak. We've been eating so much steak! I guess we were looking for a change of flavors, but it tasted very similar to what I prepare at home.

Salmon tartare was amazing! The waffle fries are some of the best that I've ever had. Nice and crispy and NOT thick, they were like chips.

5022945,2016-12-16,5,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"On our last night in town, the wife and I dined at Other Mama.  Locals are probably already very well aware of this gem of an oyster bar/sushi bar/tapas restaurant/cocktail bar located way off-Strip in a non-descript strip mall on Durango, so this is definitely for the out of towners who appreciate excellent food and drink.  The exterior of the restaurant doesn't scream its presence and could be easily missed if you're not looking for it.  The interior of the restaurant was uncomplicated and unpretentious, giving the distinct impression that much more time, effort, and money was spent on where it matters most...in the back of the house (and it showed based on the food and drinks that we received).  The dining room was smaller than I had expected, with much of seating at the sushi bar overlooking the kitchen and at the cocktail bar.

We arrived right when they opened for service at 5PM on a Thursday in time for happy hour where they offered $1 oysters, drink and food specials.  The dining filled up steadily while we were there.  Needless to say, we binged on happy hour and regular priced food and drinks.  Even at regular price, no cocktail was more than $12 and they were of equal or better quality in concept and execution to anything you'd find on the Strip.  Their selection of oysters, sourced from both East and West coasts, were exceedingly fresh, delicious, and offered enjoyable contrasts in flavor.  They came with four sauces, a ponzu, wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette, and pickled habanero pepper (not as hot as you'd think).  The happy hour small bites were made for sharing; we had the Ceviche of Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish, and Habanero ($7); Organic Salmon Poke, Beets, and Avocado ($8); Shishito Peppers, Cauliflower, and Pistachio ($5); and Hush Puppies made with blue crab and jalapeno ($5, think bite sized crab cakes, but with more crab than cake).  There was obvious genius behind the food as it was novel in concept and all delicious.  Hey, anytime you can make cauliflower a worthy co-star in delicious dish takes a keen mind and skill.  The seafood and produce were fresh and first rate.  Not to be forgotten, service was on point.  Dan and Dave, who worked the front of the house and behind the bar made us tourists, feel like locals.

My fellow Vegas visitors, seriously, get off of the Strip and check out Other Mama.  With Uber and Lyft, it's never been easier and less expensive to get to and from this local treasure.  Other Mama may have the best happy hour in town and it's definitely in the conversation of being the best all-around restaurant in terms of the quality of its food, drink, service, and value in the entire city.  We're definitely coming back the next time we're in town.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,8,5,5,9ZZdoNe1s0iPMpNmyPfcnQ

I started off with the Agnes which had a nice hibiscus base and the husband got the Beryl which had a really nice balance of apricot, bourbon and absinthe. 

We shared various plates - 

Yuzu chicken wings - these were 4 huge pieces. Really crispy and good flavor. I wasnt getting ""yuzu"" from it though, had more of a sweet and spicy gojuchang sauce and some diced onions and cilantro on top. 

Shrimp and jalapeno hushpuppies - this was a small plate of bite sized bits. Decent flavor, but was least favorite item. 

Pork Belly Kimchi Rice - this came in a hot pot so it can get some crisp bits. This was pretty solid of a rice, tender pork belly. 

Amberjack crudo - very good flavor, but smaller than most servings you get of a crudo/sashimi type plate at a Japanese spot. Still, worth ordering as it was a fresh and bright dish.

Asparagus tempura - came with 2 sauces and had a nice light crisp coating to it. Simple, but very good. 


The star for me was the oysters. $1- $2 depending on the type. The plus is there's various interesting sauces for it but my 2 favorites were the rosemary mignonette and the pickled peppers and habanero. 

My husband has been here before, but this was my first impression was positive. I think it's a good spot for a nosh and a beverage or lighter dinner more than a filling dinner as small plates can rack up. It's not a huge menu, but all the offerings are interesting.

When your in Vegas and there are sushi everywhere, but if the server takes care of a customer and makes you feel comfortable, they will always return. Server 101. Not everything is racist. Bad server is a bad server. Give you an example. An appetizer means, small dishes served before your main menu. My appetizer came after the main menu. When the customer's soda is empty, the server could ask if you would like a refill or purchase another drink. I had to flag my server every time I needed a drink. I have a 4 year old with me, she has not perfected her chopsticks skills, so a very good server will provide a to go plastic or spoon without me requesting one. In this case I had to. I think there were 10 tables and 3 tables was occupied, so I don't think they were busy. 1st in 1st out for server, if you don't get it, google will provide the answer.  If the food is taking a little bit longer no problem, servers usually try to bs that the kitchen is a little busy and the server would probably change the subject by conversing with customer.

It is as rare for me to give 5 stars on the first visit as it is to find a little gem like this in the desert.  Mind effing libations and some of the best seafood and perfectly executed meals we have ever had! 

Items tried:
- Aunt Opal cocktail. Other Mama's take on a Moscow mule. Vodka, ginger beer, lime, and serrano pepper liquer. This has a spicy kick...beware! I preferred this over mine. 

- Mildred cocktail. Rum, strawberry, lime, and mint. Nothing too special, but I walked out of there a drunk sailor! 

- Oysters (minimum order of 6). We ordered one of each on the specials board (see photo for names). My husband loves oysters and I usually have a hard time stomaching them. Normally, I avoid oysters altogether. I mustered some courage and took a walk on the plank. I tried the smallest, most innocuous one, the Point Reyes. Oh boy, I was not disappointed! My husband thought the oysters were outstanding and barely had an ocean taste. 

- Hanger steak with miso Hollandaise sauce and waffle fries. This blows a lot of fancy steakhouse steaks out of the water! I did not expect much from a hanger steak. This was prepared beautifully medium rare and had some crack Hollandaise sauce to go with it. The waffle fries were nice and crunchy and a good accompaniment. 

- Grilled wild Kauai shrimp with a side of kimchi fried rice. It was pretty good, but not great. The quality of the shrimp was impressive! The kimchi fried rice was probably my least favorite thing that I tried that night, but it paired well with the shrimp.

Peter was an awesome server who was extremely prompt, knowledgeable about the menu, and super friendly! Thanks to him and his recommendations, we had a wonderful dinner and an unforgettable experience.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,7,5,5,K9k24S-3jTD1bUVSHel6lw

Enter Other Mama.  A cross between Japanese and Mediterranean food that offers a good selection of dirt cheap ($1 - $2) oysters all day and a very tasty selection of near raw dishes.  A rare steak counts right?

To start, a selection of 4-6 oysters daily with a choice of multiple sauces.  The oysters all  fresh.  The Wasabi cocktail sauce (a take on the classic horseradish supercharged cocktail sauce) a great pairing.

Raw fish on your mind?  Standouts include a take on ahi poke with roasted beets and avocado (dressed with olive oil, the roasted beets add a pronounced sweetness that oddly works),  a whitefish ceviche (gentle acidity with bright flavors of herbaceous cilantro and  fresh chili taste of habanero).  Both served with intentionally overcooked sweet potato crisps.  The bitterness adds complexity.

Craving beef?  The grass fed beef carpaccio is very good.  Simply seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil.  The characteristic, mineral taste of the grass fed beef and it's umame finish is made even stronger when eaten on a parm and nori crisp.  The grilled prime rib with miso infused hollandaise, good eats.  Only a hint of fermented flavor but umame supercharged.  A mild spicy heat ties the dish together.

Be sure to check the specials board.  On one occasion, octopus carpaccio, live surf clams, and uni on French toast.  Fun to try and all great in flavor.

Friendly off Strip service that can be haphazard at times (missing utensils when food is served).  All good as problems are quickly corrected.

Interesting cocktail program.  Off Strip markups.

6+ visits since they opened.  Zero check-ins.  Yes I was trying to keep this a secret.  All said, highly recommended.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,20,4,xWsNJ50KfRaF9OQzrpzU2Q

It has empowered such folks to also moonlight as occasional ""professional"" negative food critics in the comfort of their own homes when they can't muster up the gonads to fix or address something at the dining establishments they so frequently have issues with. I'm usually busy reading and replying to my own restaurants' reviews that I rarely if ever have been able to or find the time to review a fellow restauranteur, but this was long overdue....

To give Other Mama anything LESS than 5 stars in my opinion is ridiculous.
These guys have consistently surpassed my expectations on every visit. The seafood is bar none the freshest you will find in the desert. Period.
No matter what day I arrive, the chef/owner is there without fail. In the trenches, hands on, with his team, as it should be and it shows.
The place is too small for pretentiousness and there is a relaxed yet attentive vibe that permeates throughout the staff and into the menu. Everything can be witnessed from the careful preparation of each dish to the service, all seen by the owner, so it would be a shock to me if a customer had an issue that it wouldn't be corrected immediately. 
I've worked in every single aspect of restaurants for 30 years and if anyone needs to be impressed, it's me. I look for every crack in the system, not to critique, but because it's in my blood....

I actually passed on the rib-eye I desired and opted for a second wing order with waffle fries. So good that I accidentally on purpose spilled a little sauce on my shirt to lick off later. The Tuna tartare appetizer was fabulous. We loved the pork belly with Kimchi Rice. The whole fish was excellent as were the oysters with bread crumbs and parm. Service was fine. Atmosphere good with a good crowd buzz for a small place. The only beef I had (no pun intended) was the size and cost of my martini. Thus the four stars. I like a martini or two with a nice meal. It makes it easier to pay for the bill. However $16 for a very small martini X 2 plus tax & tip = $40 for two teeny tiny marteenies not served in a martini glass. Wow.

5279201,2018-05-18,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Rare to dine out on weekdays, particularly a lengthy Tasting Menu beginning at 6:30pm, it was largely out of a feeling of obligation for panning Panevino when a Pharmaceutical Representative suggested it that dinner was sat down to with six strangers on Monday night in the Private Dining Room at Other Mama.

Still a popular destination for locals as well as visitors, even a night when many Las Vegas eateries remain dark finding the dining room more than fifty percent full, it was immediately upon arrival that the same young server present during a similar event in December led guests to the comfortable room adjacent the well-stocked Bar, a menu designed for varied tastes and experiences including one pregnant woman presented and confirmed by the host.

Styled as a medical case review held behind closed doors, no powerpoints but plenty of ""business"" talk taking place in between bites,  it was with most declining alcohol for various reasons that one of Other Mama's  Kiki Cocktails was selected to sip throughout the evening, its creamy base and up-front sweetness doing well in balancing the spiciness of items including a variety of Peppers such as Chef Krohmer's Hush Puppies stuffed with Crab as well as Jalapenos with a sidecar of Remoulade

Veering away from Shellfish compared to past visits, the reason for this decision unknown but potentially at the discretion of those in charge as the primary speaker appeared quite picky, it was as guests worked through steamed Edamame lightly accented by Citrus that course two was presented, the piquant Ceviche surprisingly well-received by most while all including the well-traveled were impressed by the crispiness of Other Mama's Tempura applied to sliced Mushrooms.

Offered more as a progression of small plates than ""courses,"" two long plates of Amberjack in Ponzu again highlighting the quality of Chef Krohmer's sourcing, it was in follow-up to this that pounded Chicken thighs in thick Batter had guests swearing off The Colonel forever though most did not find any comfort in blistered Shishito Peppers presented with a Russian Roulette warning that ""one out of every five or six is really spicy.""

Continuing the string of complex spicing with Grilled Shrimp and Other Mama's famous Kimchi fried Rice, the former a bit overcooked but otherwise a good balance of char, sweetness and heat while the Rice was expectedly hit n' miss amongst a largely Latin American audience, it was following Pork Belly that all found under-seasoned that savories wrapped, the Steaks expectedly crowd-pleasing while more Chicken was met with a mixed response, all finding the crispy-skinned Bird itself delicious but many turned off by the aggressively flavored Sauce beneath, though those familiar with Mole or Pipian were delighted.

FOUR STARS:  More difficult to rate than many meals, an inability to self-select items and a server's insistence on adhering to the set Menu right up to the point guests were told Honey-Miso Ice Cream had been ""thrown out"" combined with a crowd who'd have been happy at Bonefish Grill equally at fault, the fact that both Pork Belly and Shrimp were flawed makes one wonder if Other Mama has slipped from prior or if this was just a matter of an ""off night"" compared to usual excellence.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,VbKZiV9aBvz3Lzob5ikVRw
5286370,2018-06-30,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"This was my third time at Other Mama.
Third time was NOT a charm.
Other Mama conveys a sense of 'busyness', it indeed is a room with a low ceiling and dark walls. I arrived before the others in my party. Yes, indeed I had a reservation.
As I glimpsed around I noticed five available tables, as well as available bar space. 
I was 'greeted my a female, who apparently requires etiquette lessons and some additional experience in communication.  I inform her I made a previous reservation (she never inquired about the name or how many). A few happenings and horrendous communication transpired for fifteen minutes.  Eventually her response was, we are 'slammed' this evening and motions to a seat at the door/slash 'hostess area', informs me I may sit there and she will bring me a drink.  I glimpse around the room, which is the size of a basement and still see five empty tables (in addition with the empty seating at the bar).  I provided her with an unpleasant tone along with a short and curt reply.  Thinking, one would catch on and have a manager come speak with me- no.  Now, she motions at one of those empty tables,  tells me you sit there then.  I was more than put off at this point.  My fault for not leaving. 
The other two in my party arrive, and another server appears. We order drinks, five appetizers, then a bottle of wine (there are three of us). We notice the halibut on the board.  All decide we would like that as our entrees and ordered. Yes, we were still hungry as plates are small portions.  
A decent amount of time has transpired after ordering the halibut (should've had the halibut at this point). Our party watches other diners who were seated well after us receive their food and finish entire meals.  Forty five minutes have gone by since ordering the halibut.  I will refrain from my initial thought of what these three halibut dishes appeared to look like.  I will post a picture after writing this.

They specialize in raw fish dishes,  but have other items,  too,  as well as some cool artisan cocktails,  an interesting beer list and some very overpriced wine. 

I had the tuna tartare with waffle fries.  Good,  but not all that spicy.  A little salty due to the fries. But a good dish overall. I had the snapper Carpaccio from the rotating menu. It was served slightly warm,  not 100% raw, odd for a Carpaccio. But nevertheless it was quite tasty. But the star was the grilled octopus from the rotating menu.  Amazing.  Perhaps the best I've eaten. 

The Svetlana cocktail,  with house infused horseradish vodka,  is quite interesting and very good if you like horseradish, as I do. 

Service was a tad slow because they were so busy,  but it was still good. The wait staff and bartenders really know their product.

5349114,2015-04-07,5,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Am I the only one without a blown mind while eating at Other Mama? I suppose so. Perhaps I was expecting a lot from Other Mama due to the wonderful reviews, the high star ratings, and a head chef that trained under Morimoto. So yeah, I was expecting some out of this world, mind blowing, and unforgettable dishes ... but truth be told, I was quite disappointed. 

My friend and I went in one night for dinner and sat at the bar. We chatted with David English a little about the restaurant and the menu. I started with the Mildred, which composed of bicardi, lime, and a strawberry-mint soda while my friend went with the Beryl, which was a mix of apricot buffalo trace, blood orange bitters, and yuzu tincture. Both drinks were priced at $9. Both were pretty good aside from the Beryl being a little bit too strong due to the whiskey but no problem! English has got it! He added more sugar to it to help dilute it and it helped! 

We started off with half a dozen of oysters. They had three types of oysters on special that night: Fanny Bay, Bluepoint, and one other one that I can't seem to remember the name of. We chose to have two of each. And I LOVED them. I simply LOVE oysters and they were indeed VERY FRESH. On top of the freshness, the price point was to die for! Fanny Bays were $1.50 each. Bluepoints were $1.00 each. And the third one, the one with the most brine was $2.00 each. Where else can you get amazingly fresh oysters for this price in Las Vegas? Uh, no where. The taste of the Bluepoints were so fresh and crisp. The Fanny Bays were also a favorite with their slightly stronger flavor.  They pretty much have every type of condiment you would want with oysters ranging from their special house sauces to your traditional Tabasco bottle.  

As for some main entrees, we ordered chirashi, spicy yuzu chicken wings, and pork belly kim chi fried rice. 

Chirashi: I love sushi. And I love sushi rice. Our chirashi bowl came with bigeye ahi tuna, salmon, octopus, amberjack, shrimp ceviche, ikura, a type of white fish that I forgot the name to, and avocado. This dish made me realize that I really don't like amberjack. It turns chalky in your mouth as you chew on it and ... I kind of don't like that. The tuna had a strange texture, bouncy almost. The salmon, shrimp ceviche, white fish, and octopus were all really good. The ikura, however, was a bit disappointing. Half of the ikura looked popped to me. 

Now, as for the sushi rice...it tasted like regular rice. Though, my personal preference, I like my sushi rice to have hints of vinegar because it helps balance flavors of raw fish. It was actually difficult for us to finish this. In the end of it all, the chirashi bowl was possibly the most disappointing dish we've had that night. We did talk to the chef about it and he stated that he liked his sushi rice to be on the more mild side. Therefore, he puts in less vinegar than the traditional recipe, which we understand. However, it is just not our cup of tea. 

Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings: The wings are done really well. The crispness of the wings were really light, which is a plus. However, the dish itself didn't really do much for me. Nothing really jumped out at me. The sauce that they used on top of it ... just seemed like a regular gochujang recipe. 

Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice: It's comforting to know that the kimchi is made in house. I like how it was served in a hot/clay pot, which keeps the dish warm. It had huge chunks of pork belly with a nice sunny side egg right on top of the rice. The pork belly chunks were HUGE and you get a lot of it. However, I do believe if they cooked the pork belly along with the fried rice as a whole, the flavor would be remarkable. The kimchi tasted like Chinese preserved vegetables and the rest were quite mild in flavor. Once again, I can't say I enjoyed the dish due to how mild the flavors were. It just doesn't hit home. 

We ended the night with the Japanese style cheesecake. Japanese cheesecake is airy, fluffy and light in flavor. It's typically very soft in texture. Other Mama's version threw us for a loop. The texture, the look, and the feel of my fork getting a piece of cheesecake all screamed NY style cheesecake. It was dense. However, it was LIGHT in flavor, but quite far from the airy and fluffiness that I desire. 

Overall, Other Mama is fantastic for their oysters. Great price for great quality. But a lot of the other dishes were a miss for my taste buds. I'm sure the quality and the dishes are great .. just not for me. When I think Asian Fusion, I think traditional flavors with a twist. From the dishes that we have tried that night, the traditional tastes were absent, and therefore, the twists did not do much for us. But hey, it could be because my taste buds are weird.

I've been meaning to go and was one of my most anticipated restaurants to go to for awhile. This is what we ordered:

Svetlana - Horseradish vodka was what caught my eye but it was mixed to a point where there was little to no sharpness to it. Still an excellent drink that uses intresting ingredients.

Penelope - The drink basically tasted like a melted pomergranate limeade popsicle with the shiso leaf added that sweet plum flavor to it. 

5 pieces of Salmon / 5 pieces of Big Eye Tuna -  very thin and small slices but good quality and uses real ginger and wasabi

Oyster Rockefeller - Very good came with 4 oysters that were mixed with spinach and foie gras butter

Rhode Island Calamari w/ Miso Hollandaise - Calamari was cooked to perfection and that sauce was fire. The pickeled peppers did remind us of the same flavor of the peppers used in orange chicken at Panda Express but just like Orange Chicken...shit is fire.

Prime NY Steak w/ Miso Hallandaise & Waffle Fries - Steak was done the way it should be, medium rare, and the sauce being the same as the calamari was complimented well with the steak. Waffle fries weren't like Chick-Fil-A's at all and was more thinner almost to the point of it being like a chip. If only they had a soy wasabi based steak...

Overall you can taste the quality of everything from the drinks to the condiments and it borderline warrants the price tag of each dish however the non-entree portions and drinks are on the smaller side which makes this place more on the $$$ side then $$. Will def try out more items as the hardest part of restaurants like these is choosing what to eat because the whole menu looks good.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,2,2,5,TEGwAyqNbKUEsMFq3Yz35g
5434510,2016-05-06,15,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Yeah, this is my kind of place. A raw bar with oysters as the headliner and a full bar highlighted by a list of creative cocktails. The food menu is relatively short, but every single item looked delicious and I could have easily just closed my eyes, pointed my finger on the menu, and would have been pleased with whatever it landed on. Every item we had was delicious and we placed two extra orders of food after our initial order because we couldn't get enough.

Expecting a wait when we came at 8:30 on Saturday night, we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to sit at the table directly in front of the specials board. The board being in plain view was the primary reason for our extra orders. We were greeted immediately and were given excellent service by the team of servers for the entirety of the meal. There were no issues with the kitchen as everything was timely and with the kitchen being open, we could easily view how our orders were progressing.

We ordered 7 items along with 18 oysters (blue point, Wicomico, and otter cove priced at $1.50, $1, and $2.50 per oyster respectively) served with three different mignonettes. My wife had the dozen East Coast oysters and I had the half dozen briny, otter cove oysters which I thought went very well with the ponzu salsa provided. You're not going to find the selection of oysters of Other Mama, that are priced this fairly, anywhere else in the city, or at least I haven't found anything comparable yet.

My other favorites were the mackerel sashimi, yuzu panna cotta, and the cocktail, Sofia. We probably would have tried another dessert but we decided to pull the plug when we saw the kitchen starting to close everything down. Chef Dan made his way to our table, kindly greeted us, and we briefly conversed. Dinner for two that night before tip was $150 which I have no problem with and would have no problem driving across town again.

To start off, we decided to go for a dozen oysters and the grilled squid. All of the oysters they had that day were really small - which was a bit disappointing as they are a bit expensive.
The grilled squid was delicious - I looked away for a second and my boyfriend already ate half of the dish -_-.
For entrees I got the 1/2 organic chicken w/ peewee potatoes and spinach, and he got the Prime NY steak, miso hollandaise, and waffle fries.

My chicken was delicious and was cooked perfectly. The only downside was it being a bit too salty. I think I ate more of the steak than I did of my own dish - cause that shit was good! 

For dessert, we got the japanese cheesecake and nutella ice cream. I wasn't really impressed with the cheesecake - but I did notice that it's a bit lighter compared to other cheesecakes I've eaten, still not worth the $7 in my opinion. That nutella ice cream doe. They even added some nuts into it! I would've eaten 2 scoops but I probably would've barfed if I ate any more food.

This place can be a bit pricey but it does offer fresh sea food (thank goodness I didn't shit my pants from the oysters so thats always a plus).

The things we ordered:

Happy hour menu
1. White fish ceviche with sweet potato chips
2. Spicy tuna tartare with waffle fires
3. Deviled eggs with fried oyster on top
4. Blue crab hush puppies

Not on the happy hour menu:
5. 1/2 Dozen kunamoto oysters
6. Grilled octopus over a mashed bean concoction

Highlights: Literally everything, except the blue crab hush puppies.  Not a fan of the density of the hush puppies...that's just a personal thing.  The oysters were amazingly fresh and I loved the flavor of the ponzu salsa to put on top.  Our definite favorite was the deviled eggs, the creamy egg with the crunch of the oyster....perfect bite.  The spicy tuna tartare was good, but maybe could have been spicier.  The waffle fries were perfectly crunchy and seasoned well.  The white fish ceviche was really refreshing paired with the sweet potato chips.  The grilled octopus...OMG...most tender octopus I've ever had.  I'm sad I waited this long to come to this place.

We love the casual neighborhood feel of this restaurant. At first, the waiter didn't think there was any fish left and we were so disappointed, but alas, he found one for us. I love the lemony taste and the fresh rosemary. This time, we did not order drinks, which can really raise the bill. We will save that for happy hour visits.

Logical heads prevailed and our party of 4 was still able to sample quite a bit.  Oysters were mandatory and a great way to start the meal.  They featured 3 types (Fanny Bay, Bluepoint. Skookum) and while I could only tell which was which based on shell, they all went down the same way, deliciously.  The pickled peppers/habanero and wasabi cocktail sauces were my favorites.  Most spots only offer $1-$2 oysters for happy hour, but just like Lionel Richie, these guys are doing it ""All Night Long"", one of many reasons to be a repeat customer.   

The ""Caviar & French Toast"" with the crème fraiche was a nice little curveball to the palette.  The toast's warm, buttery softness went nicely with the rest and we even got more of it just to finish the order.  Other standouts were the ""Grilled Shrimp Salad"" with its excellent dressing and soba noodles, and the ""White Fish Ceviche"", which I was selfishly eating straight out of the jar by the end.  

A little piece of seafood heaven on the westside for sure.  I could envision myself overlooking the beach while eating their delectable ocean treats.  Luckily for everyone in Vegas, Other Mama is here, and hopefully will be for a long time.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,82,58,5,l1HcKCT5bqG-XjwNnGRGOg

5561648,2015-11-03,3,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I've been here several times and I'm always impressed by the quality and creativity of the dishes.  

Over the course of multiple visits, I've been able to try a bunch of items.  Here are the favorites (in no particular order):
- Spicy Tuna Tartare.   Tune is flavored perfectly and the thin, fresh and crispy waffle fries are the  perfect accompaniment.  

 - Sashimi Combo.  It's nicely presented, the fish is delicious and cut very well.  Also, it's a good value at $19.  

- Grass Fed Beef Carpaccio.  Thin and tender slices of beef.  Really tasty and the parm crisps add a nice layer of texture and flavor. 

1/2 Organic Chicken.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. It comes sliced, which really helps for sharing.   It's the roast chicken I wish I could make at home.  Also, the shishito peppers and fingerling potatoes give you the much needed side of greens and comfort.  

Specials: 
These aren't on the regular menu, so I will do my best to remember the ingredients.

Mushroom Tempura - This dish was delicious!  The batter lent just the right amount of texture over the delicate mushrooms.  Not too greasy, not too doughy...  In the words of Goldilocks, it was just right.  

Alaskan Salmon Sashimi - It was sweet, there was basil, I don't remember much else except I could've ordered this 5 more times and called it the meal.  Unique flavors that don't always come with sashimi.  It was a total win.  

Spicy Salmon, Tempura Asparagus, fluke and shiso leaf Cut Roll- I can confidently say that this was one of the best rolls I've ever had.  I tend to lean traditional when it comes to sushi (not into the whole cream cheese thing) and this was such a great combination of flavors.  The secret weapon was the shiso leaf - the sweet and peppery finish was perfect.  

Ambiance - A
Can't imagine how they could've improved that space, inside of a random strip mall.  Love the setting around the bar.  During some summer days, they had some A/C issues, but that won't be a problem as we enter the winter months.  The playlist on our recent visit was nice, some classic blues.  

Service: A
Consistent attention, always checked to make sure each dish was to our liking, drinks were always being refilled.

After getting back from Mexico I have been on this fresh seafood kick in which I thought I wouldn't get to experience without paying the high Las Vegas Strip prices. 

This place has been on my radar for some time now. A chef I work with actually recommended this spot and glad I took his advice. I will say it was a little bit of a challenge finding this place only because their logo does not really stand out; I love it needless to say though. It offers that shabby/rustic/chic-ey feel. They offer specials of the day and oyster selections may vary based on season. 

We started with the sake flight. In the beginning I really didn't care for the taste but as I continued to sip, they got better. We will just say that make sure you have a clean palette before sipping them, it changes the taste completely! 

We ordered a little bit of everything - ceviche, octopus, grilled garlic shrimp, mussels in butter four gras and OYSTERS; Kumamoto. 

Everyone is so friendly & happy to help! It was a nice change even seeing the GM delivering our food and engaging in conversations.

5575085,2017-04-10,0,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Came to this place randomly around 7 on a Friday and definitely did not expect to enjoy myself as much as I did. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, it was a great mix of a date night spot, but also a casual place to enjoy others company. The lighting was dim, great music, attentive staff, and the decor really gave the place a relaxed feel. My gf and I were sat at the end of the bar because all tables were already reserved. We had a great view of the kitchen, so we were able to see the chefs working hard to make delicious food. Unfortunately, I felt really cramped and uncomfortable with no room to scoot over because all of the other seats were taken at the bar. This review would be 4.5 if yelp allowed increments. Now for the food!

We ordered the ceviche, chicken fried lobster, and the PBR hot pot. The ceviche is one of the best I have ever tasted. The seafood tasted fresh and even better with the purée they made with the habaneros. It gave the dish a sweet and tangy taste. The ceviche came with sweet potato chips for a greatly paired crunchy element. 

My gf ordered the chicken fried lobster, the batter was light and the chicken was juicy. What really made it stand out was the sauce that accompanied it. 

The PBR hot pot I ordered was the dish that really stood out me. The broth! Wow, I was slurping every ounce of it. The perfectly cooked seafood and Bok choy took a back seat to the broth. Maybe it was the PBR, or maybe It was the smooth and salty taste of the broth; either way it was delicious. Make sure to order a side of rice with this!",tbUgfUxthT88v6XoIOAp7g,1,1,5,0F7CUpAo3Th9Jd7MAJ0OFA
5588185,2015-06-05,2,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I'm just gonna say it. This is my NEW favorite restaurant in a city full of amazing restaurants. And not just because dining on the strip is for suckers. Do you:

Love oysters?
Love fish?
Love craft cocktails?
Love life?

If you can even check two of those things off, you owe it to yourself to GET IN HERE. A previous reviewer had the gall to compare Other Mama's waffle fries to Chik-Fil-A's fries. This person definitely can't check any of these items off. Especially number four. But hey, enjoy your equality-unfriendly chicken, my man.

We've been to Other Mama four times - once every couple of weeks - in the short time they've been open. Every time we walk out the door in a great mood, and plotting our next visit. We've worked our way around the better part of the menu at this point - but still have some things to try. Without getting too detailed, I'll just say that we haven't had a single dish that we wouldn't order again. No joke. The oysters, at $1 - $2.50 each, are a no-brainer. There are many inventive sauces to choose from and it's a ton of fun to try different pairings. The deviled eggs are the best freaking deviled eggs I've had in my entire life (with apologies to Carson Kitchen). Mixed seafood ceviche is the bomb. Nigiri sampler (which included flying fish the night we tried it) was out of this world. Chef/Owner Dan is incredibly thoughtful in his preparation - the guy blends his own soy sauce, and seasons his sushi rice in a subtly different way to complement that. The result is incredible.

Enough gushing about the food. I'm thirsty. The cocktail program here is also inspired. There are just two bartenders, and they both have plenty of tricks up their respective sleeves. Last time we were there, English was working on a Japanese Hairy Crab infused vodka to be used in a future bloody mary offering (ummm, brunch. Now, guys.) and he let us try it. He also made me a bacon manhattan out of some crazy jar of stuff he keeps on the top shelf. These guys have chops and they put a ton of thought into the cocktails... all of which are named after old ladies. No 'Ethel' on the menu yet - my grandmother's name - but we can dream! Anyway, I highly recommend the 'Beryl' for you dark spirit lovers and the 'Vera' for anyone who loves champagne-based drinks.

No review would be complete without a mention of the service - efficient and friendly. Pro tip - try and sit at the bar, where you'll get a little face time with the mad geniuses that are putting out these dishes and drinks. (shout out to Stan, creator of the Stanwich, which we hope will be on the eventual brunch menu.)

Pro tip #2: make a reservation. There's like nine tables and another 9 or so seats at the bar. Do the math.

I mean the ambience was cute...kinda reminded me of a small hole in the wall restaurant that neighborhood locals would eat at in Bushwick Brooklyn.  Honestly everything was ok.  The hushpuppies were good but lacked that certain ""made with love"" aspect that they needed for me to really love them.  They were too small, too perfectly round and too uniform.  I mean, the flavor was ok....just lacked that certain homemade quality.  The grilled octopus was the best thing of the night.  For $16 they could have at least put 2 tentacles on the plate. But it was cooked perfectly, very tender with a bit of a crunch.  The side of beans were small and random and the side salad was useless and forgettable with not enough dressing. As for the mains , my boyfriend had the kim chi fried rice with pork belly and egg.  Good, but pretty standard nothing to scream about.  You could get something 10x better in Chinatown or koreatown with much more food for half the price.  I had the organic 1/2 chicken with spinach and potatoes.  Bland super dry.  The spinach was the best part...which is sad bc I could easily make it at home.  It needed a sauce and more seasoning.  The potatoes  were not seasoned and were boring.  In other words chances are you can probably make something identical to it at home for cheaper that tastes better.  Kudos tho to the excellent service and hipstery Brooklyn vibes.

We were expecting great food but were pleasantly surprised by the entertainment we were also provided, in the form of two attention-seeking girls who apparently came back after dining there earlier in the evening (""Yeah, we got our Christmas tree but got home and didn't feel like dealing with it so we came back here!""). They were attractive (and on the prowl) so definitely garnered the attention of the bartender and chef. I *think* I eyerolled at everything they said. Really?  Fireball shots?  Sorry, eyeroll.

On to the food.  Great food.  It's sushi/sashimi and share plates done with nary a Japanese chef in sight.  However, that was no problemo since Dan, the chef and proprietor did a bang-up job.  Sounds like he's had gobs of experience including training in Japan.

Favorites:  
- Caviar on French Toast
- Live Clam and Live Scallop: Both very fresh but the scallop was a little anemic.
- Uni: Also very fresh; we got two orders and received two pieces total...so 1 order, 1 piece.
- Oysters on a half shell, 1/2 dz with 3 types:  We left the sauces up to Dan and they were pretty delicious though I don't remember what they were.
- Drinks:  The bartender was very attentive (until the girls came in ha ha).  His drinks were delicious but I really enjoyed the Agnes.

The ""Ok's"":
- Oysters Foie Rockafeller:  I thought these were ok for roasted oysters.  The foie melted and you didn't really taste much of it.  Also, they were brinier than usual.  I still ate 3 of them.  Mom had one and wasn't a fan.
- Kauai Shrimp with kimchi fried rice add-on:  I actually liked the kimchi fried rice.  Shrimp was ok.  Mom ate a little of this since she was already stuffed.

All in all, a great meal with the aforementioned entertainment.  I would return, likely with more people so we can try more things.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,5,4,4,us7IbQCRsWCfXEkJhVS1zg

Most restaurants serving small dishes to share are hit or miss, but Other Mama hit it out of the park. Highest quality and care in the execution and presentation.

With each plate, the praise was universal.

Sashimi - so fresh, the tuna really melted in your mouth. Fresh wasabi too.

Oysters - wow! So fresh and flavorful. Fun to try the different varieties.

Crab tostada - I could have ordered this again. The tortilla alone was delicious.

Ceviche - more of a salsa, but sweetened with mango with a little spice. Really tasty.

Chicken fried lobster - perfectly cooked, soft and succulent lobster bits.

Mussels - small but packed with flavor. If I was to quibble about anything, I really wish they had some soft bread with which to sop up the delectable broth which otherwise went to waste.

Caviar french toast - a decadent yet delicate combo, couldn't get enough of it.

If you do and the one waiter dude is there he will forever make you feel like the biggest piece of crap! God forbid you just ask if you could eat here. WTF! 

I walked in and the girl asked if I had a reservation and I said no, but if you're full that's cool I was just in the area and she said well you can sit at the bar and then mr. A-hole comes up and says in the most rude way, ummm yeah do you have a reservation? And I said no, but I was just in the neighborhood and if you don't have room it's fine and he went on a freaking tirade about how no one can ever eat here without one and how necessary it is to have one. Well I'm just about the biggest piece of crap because who just stops by-but here let's dump you at the bar. I said it's no big deal. He then goes on and on about how uncomfortable I'm going to be because the barstools have no back on them. I tell him...I'm fine. 

He takes our order and he leaves. But he's definitely the biggest dick. But I'm super nice because I don't want any spit in my food. 

My bf is crunches on the corner of the low bar and the high bar is on his right. I can't move to the left, the girl on my left is weird and she's gawking at alex  of the VGK, he's on the high bar to my boyfriends right. But when the Golden night leaves I kindly ask the girl cleaning it if there was any way we could move to that part of the bar. Let's make this very clear I DID NOT ASK FOR A F-N TABLE!!!!!! she said He would make sure. She checks and comes back and says we can sit at this table. I ask are you completely sure because Mr A-hole Waiter who has not brought out some of our order because he forgot-he was pretty adamant that people like me don't get tables, that I'm pretty lucky to be at the bar. She assured me that it was fine and helps me move our food and drinks over. 

Ok well after sitting for 5 minutes Mr. A-hole comes walking up with big body motions--motioning is to move and yelling as loud as he can, ""NOOOOOOO!! ALRIGHT NO WAY YOU HAVE TO GET UP NOW, CMON LETS GO, UP! UP! UP! NOW!"" 

Ok well wtf, seriously the entire place is now looking at me like I'm the biggest piece of crap. So now he has everyone believing that I'm a piece of crap. I tell him nicely, oh well I only asked if we could go to the high bar and....

Then I get interrupted he starts yelling more at me like I'm a retard and takes all my crap and moves me back to where we were and I aSk if if we could at least go to the high bar because no one is there and he ignores me and yells, ""THE GENERAL MANAGER IS VERY UPSET THAT YOU JUST MOVED YOURSELF AND ASKED ME TO FIX THIS, YOU CANT MOVE!"" 

What am I a dog? A second class citizen? At this point super embarrassed and the girl to my left asked me what the heck happened? Typically I would have paid and left but I was in utter shock. I have never ever been treated this way. I don't think anyone should be. Not even the poorest man on the planet. Every human deserves to be treated with decency.

The staff is very friendly and attentive. The owner Dan accommodated for me and my gf, the Caviar French Toast made my month! Everything here is well executed, from the seasonal hand crafted cocktails to dish presentation, and beautiful plateware. 

Our server recommended the BBQ oysters special. At first it did not sound appealing but it was completely different than what I expected and HOLY COW, they were delicious! 

Literally everything blew me away. But your must have list begins: Amberjack crudo, fanny bay oysters with Ponzu salsa, prime ribeye with waffle fries, shrimp & mint wrapped in cucumber! And if they have it.. Irish Cream ice cream with baileys float! We ordered two! And the strawberry red wine gelato was even better than I imagined it would be!

Salmon, not so much. The kimchi fried rice with pork belly was on point! The blue crab hand roll was awesome but the spicy tuna not too much. Ceviche with root chips was a good starter.  For drink, I tried Bessie which was recommended by one of the Yelpers and I do not regret taking that tip. The menu seems to change so my review may only be a momentary comment for the food. But the service was superb. I saw smiles from the entrance to table and through out the meal.

5725569,2015-04-13,4,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Other Mama! Where has she been all my life?

Walked in on Saturday night around 8:30 PM with a girlfriend. There were a handful of tables that filled the air with light chatter. Music was at the perfect volume level and completed the look of this place. If I could scoop this venue up with my hands and relocate it, it'd be the perfect addition to the downtown Las Vegas area. It had that kind of vibe - cool and boutique-feeling, but not stuck up. 

Started off our night right with a cocktail. Gf got the Bessie (Cazadores Tequila, Habanero Honey and Dogfish IPA, garnished with a watermelon slice) and I ordered the Aunt Opal, which was a pretty standard version of a Moscow Mule. I know, uncommon of the Whiskey Woman but I wasn't up for having my usual on-the-rocks beverage and I was actually craving ginger beer! It ended up being the perfect, sparkling introduction I needed. 

The Octopus Carpaccio and Amberjack Crudo graced us with their presence first. Both divine and yet simple, but complex. HA! Seriously though, you MUST TRY the octopus. The texture was luxurious and delicate, just slightly cooked from the hot sesame oil and was flavored with ponzu and topped with a touch of raw ginger, sweet peppers and scallion. PERFECTION! Will be back for this dish alone. The amberjack was fresh and the fish looked stunning, adorned with a ponzu salsa. 

The Grass-Fed Beef Carpaccio, White Fish Ceviche and Spicy Tuna Tartare were up next. Nori & Parmesan crisps sat daintily atop the baby arugula, giving the carpaccio just the right amount of ""crunch"" character. Nice touch and I also applaud the not-too-much or not-too-little finely chopped onions that would make Goldilocks blush. The Whitefish Ceviche had the right amount of acidity and was presented in a mason jar with a generous portion of crisp sweet potato chips. Can I just say? The Spicy Tuna Tartare had the perfect amount of spice. Just enough fire and flare without the watering of eyes or the desperate panting and grabbing of the nearest glass of ice water. Crunchy, but soft-on-the-inside waffle fries accompanied the creamy tuna and were hearty enough to endure the weight of the tartare. There's nothing I dislike more than weak chips that shatter into a million pieces with one timid bite. 

The black chalkboard menu-capitalized Sea Snail special was something I was definitely looking forward to. The presentation was brilliant - front-page magazine cover worthy. It came in the shell it domesticated itself in (I'm assuming, and if not I'd like to keep thinking so) and was served with a ponzu dipping sauce. PORK BELLY KIM CHEE FRIED RICE was brought to our table still sizzling in the hot pot topped with a sunny-side up egg. I immediately chopped the embryo open to let that liquid gold egg yolk run, not walk. Fatty pork belly is truly a blessing and must be used in more dishes in this world. 

I LOVE UNI. Any place that has uni on the menu must be approached cautiously, but if they have fresh - and I mean, FRESH uni then you must give it a go. I didn't ask, but I'm assuming from the size of our cute little uni scoops, I'm guessing they were from Hokkaido, Japan (my favorite region of uni producers). I could be wrong. Either way, they were amazing and sweet. I ended up ordering more later as I could not resist. Friendly and passionate Chef came out and jokingly informed us that we ordered the last of the precious treasure. I'm not going to lie - it made me feel a little happy inside that we weren't going to be victims of the ""86"" grim reaper. 

We had coffee ice cream drizzled with Bailey's to finish our palate's journey. Our bill came to $140, well worth splitting between the two of us. We had more than enough food and were stuffed to the max.

1) Tuna sashimi. Fantastic, with a beautiful, melt-in-your-mouth texture and fresh flavor. Also a reasonable deal at $7.
2) Oysters. Had three each of two of the sweeter kind. Solid.
3) French toast and cavier. The taste was good, but the disappointing part was that the taste of the cavier barely came through, more on the aftertaste. Definitely by no means a bad dish.

We get the ny strip with hollandaise.  The sauce is not overwhelming or salty. It is delicious. The only issue is with the waffle fries. Not meaty enough. They need to cut them a bit bigger because they come off as potato crisps and kind of weird texture.  

The crab totstada could be eaten every single day. Put a little acid in it and it will
Come alive. What a great and fun place.  Looking forward to going back again. Btw the sushi is sooooo fresh it tastes like it was just swimming. Try the scallop.",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,4,U7t0sYXS2wZR2UIXcFUHuw
5812520,2017-07-18,1,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"We asked what inspired the name ""Other Mama?"" According to one of the workers, it is what they called their grandmother. It is interesting that they call their grandmother ""Other Mama."" The food here is excellent albeit far from the strip. We had taken Uber all the way out here to try this restaurant. It was really good.

We were trying to celebrate my friend's birthday, but our server was not very discrete about keeping it a surprise. Also, they charged us for the Japanese cheesecake and candle which I thought was a first for me. Other restaurants don't spoil a birthday surprise nor charge for a birthday dessert.

Other than that, the food was delicious. We first started with oysters ranging from small, medium, and large. It was a good variety and very tasty. Then we just ordered a variety of dishes to share including the Shishito with Cauliflower and Pistachio, Oyster Rockefeller, Deluxe Sashimi Combination that included the Amberjack Crudo, Kim Chi Fried Rice with Pork Belly, and Farm Egg, and the Braised Octopus. My favorite was the Braised Octopus. The dishes were tapas style, therefore, you needed to order a couple of dishes to share with friends.
Also, I think the pairing of my libation (Svetlana - Horseradish Vodka, Lemon, Ginger Syrup, Becherovka) with the oysters was an excellent suggestion from our server.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,1,1,4,XkXEfbrB_T_5NRCprKs6aA

5821397,2015-05-22,6,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"I was initially interested in going to this place since I had oyster cravings, and saw the price deal for $1-$2/oyster from the other reviewers. I just got back from not having enough amazing oysters on the beaches of Nice, and wanted to fulfill my craving. The short version is: I think I came here possibly on a bad day? Sorta the tail end of their stocked items, hence not as fresh perhaps.  

With some stellar, yet mixed reviews on other items, my original goal was to stuff my face with oysters only, but, you know, with all those options in your face, it's hard to walk away with JUST oysters. 

Semi-Spoil Alert!  Oyster prices have gone up by 50 cents! Yeah, yeah, i know some of you don't give a crap about 50cents, but, for one that is super stoked with the solid number of $1 and $2, it is a change. Of course, this was bound to happen with increasing popularity and time. 

Duck Island- $2  
Fanny Bay - $2
Beau Soleil - $2.5
Kumamoto- $2.5

No $1 oysters were available on the day we went and my dream was shattered. We got 2 of each to try them all out. 

My favorite was the Fanny Bay out of all of them, so I ordered two more. It wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. Granted, this is Las Vegas, and with transporting that stuff across the land of no seas, it was to be expected, but unfortunately neither mentally expected, nor noted by me. 

Amberjack Crudo- 4 stars. This was delicious, and probably the highlight of our meal. 

Caviar with French Toast-  1 star. 
I read some review after having had it that the french toast was warm? Ours seemed like it had been refrigerated and taken out. It was on the special menu. And the fact that they erased it off the special menu after our order at 5:30 p.m. (30 minutes after opening) might have been a sign that we were having the ""last bit"" that they had left from earlier in the week. Our waiter told as that they ""ran out"" as he was erasing it off the board. I thought it was okay. Definitely not good enough for $19 for 6 pieces. I somehow just found a photo where this dish had 8 pieces, which makes me wonder...did our serving fall short due to them ""running out?"" Or did they actually reduce the pieces they give out. No es bueno, mi amigos. NO ES BUENO.

So, all this stuff and our bill came out to about $70 after tax and tip. And, we were half full. 
My husband was in a haze of such disappointment with the meal, that he did the unbelievable. We hit up a another restaurant immediately after in attempts to ameliorate our disappointment, and when the bill came, he realized that he had left his credit card at ""Other Mother."" 

With our heads low, we had to make the drive back to go pick it up. 

Perhaps the rave reviews of other yelpers definitely set me up for high expectations for this place. Service was great, with our waiter being super approachable, cool, and waters being full. I even had a nice chat with the chef/owner.  Great interior, open feel, and a nice cool spot that gives a twist with the restaurant name and staff from what one would expect in an Asian fusion restaurant. 

Would I go back? Hmmmmm, I think I'm giving up on fresh oysters in Las Vegas for one, and, MAYBE I would go back for the Amberjack, but that's about it. IMHO, the prices are high for what I think it's worth. Oh, the sweet potato chips are definitely worth trying. $3 for a plate and it's a nice snack.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,7,6,3,mmpTecYg54F_gWV4vXWrYA

All 9 of us had a great experience. My son, a former chef, finished his dinner with a scoop of Miso Honey ice cream. The flavor was perfect, and I'm going to have this on my next visit.",eJZZWZ1eMXyjXkz4X2stPw,3,3,5,m5-3ybR3rRRDiq1MkGXbEw

This dish makes my mouth water just writing about it. Their spicy tuna tartare is served fresh to order and accompanied busy house made waffle fries.

5908552,2015-08-15,1,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,"Enjoyable but not too impressed. Wanted to like it more as it is close to home and seems quite unique. 

You wouldn't think this was a sushi place upon first entering the restaurant. Decor was more mid-atlantic coastal, odd for sushi but intriguing and inviting. 

We ordered a few of the house favorites - variety of oysters, amberjack crudo, tuna tartare, white fish ceviche, pork belly kimchi fried rice, and variety of nigiri. 

Server was nice, but we probably would have enjoyed our selections more if they didn't ALL come to the table at the SAME time. No kidding. Is this normal here or were they rushing us out?  Felt more like a buffet or ayce than a fine dining experience. Kind of ruined it for us.  When you pay $100+ for two, you expect better timing of the food coming out. 

Crudo was very good, with the tangy ponzu sauce.  Surprisingly, the cheap $1 NY oysters were quite plump and more tasty than the more expensive varieties. The ceviche was disappointing, flavorless other than an overpowering taste of lime. Needed more depth, seasoning and heat. Tartare was better, served with tasty waffle fries, and you do get quite a sizeable portion. Nigiri was decent, but unremarkable, as was the fried rice. 

Don't be surprised if the prices have hiked up a bit recently too. Overall decent but not overly impressed. 4 star food, but sadly -1for service.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,3,M5ueUyIDmmk9XHZ2--CzgA
