971561,2016-02-18,1,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,Disappointed in the manners of the employees here. Very unhelpful and simply rude. I took in a coupon sheet and it was like I was being reprimanded for bringing it. Another person came in after me and ordered something that I had an extra coupon for and I wanted to give it to them.  I was yelled at by the employees and told that they could not use it since I had one that I was going to use.,2MUHT4k3J9XmJjZu0y046Q,2,0,1,VOyYhr8pTZO-R4VPlwwMtQ
1634344,2015-06-16,9,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,What the hell happened to POS? Hmmm maybe those initials mean something other that Port of Subs these days or at least that's how I feel. I remember when I first moved to Vegas and the sandwich scene was really lacking. POS was a place where you could get a sandwich on bread that was freshly baked and held the sandwich together and the fillings inside the sandwich were plentiful . Subway was a joke compared to POS but for the last few years Subway has nothing to worry about. Very sad for a Nevada based sandwich shop that and such a following and lines out the door at one time. Not the case anymore this POS was dead inside and is hardly noticeable tucked away in the corner of a shopping center that used to thrive at one time and has since changed a lot. I had the 2 foot sub deal and the bread tasted like it was old and not fresh. The veggies looked sad. I had the number 1 sub and it has 4 types of meat and 1 type of cheese on it. This sandwich looked so skinny and where was the 4 types of meat? More like 4 paper thin slices of who knows what meat and stake bread. I'll stick with Jersey Mike's from now on.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,13,12,1,_eZZcZoDZTBcppl68hYFEg

They were clueless.  I had to correct how they made a simple hot pastrami.  I was also surprised that they had eliminated the miltiary discount.  I put the svaings back in the tip jar, so it is not a big deal from a financial perspective, but the idea of eliminating something like that is disconcerting.

We used to go once a week for lunch.  I don't think we'll be back now.",6cG4MsXWSVI7q0ZrQ8OI7Q,3,0,1,OoYXAEAUhZvypLAmowURlA

When you load them up with EVERYTHING, these monsters are awesome!

1872589,2009-10-29,0,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,"This seems to be a chain throughout the greater Las Vegas area. We were looking for a somewhat healthful lunch to make us feel like we were having a healthy weekend sans bad food and alcohol. Denial is a great thing!

The place has the feel of a Subway, but what sets Port of Subs apart is that the meat and cheese are sliced to order. Was the sandwich stellar? No. Was it satisfying after a late evening? Sure. 

Kudos for having fresh brewed ice tea, although we really should have been re-hydrating with water.",9IF2ZMnkrZlvxCHcO0h1EQ,0,0,3,IMYQsN5xzPfa-pX7eOtNjQ
2797523,2014-04-20,2,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,"Came here on a Easter Sunday only because every other sandwich spot was closed. I have been to other Port of Subs and they usually dont disappoint. Well this one really disappointed.

Me and my 12 year old son ordered an Extra Large #1 which was a 2 footer on sourdough and the wifey ordered a Medium Avocado Turkey and Bacon which was 8 inches on sourdough as well.

The #1 has Capicola, Salami, Ham, and Pepperoni with Provolone Cheese. The Avocado Turkey Bacon was exactly that. We had them put everything on both sandwiches like lettuce, onions, mustard, mayo, etc. 

The major disappointment was that the bread for both orders were dry, which was too bad because it kind of cancelled out the good taste of what was inside the sandwiches. I was only able to eat half my sandwich since I didnt really find it too appealing.

Service was nice and friendly. I was glad that they were open while everybody else decided to stay closed.

In closing, I have had a sandwich here before but the bread was never that dry. Hopefully, the next visit will yield a better experience and if so I will change my rating accordingly.

3329857,2015-02-27,0,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,I've been here a few times and I thought I would give this place one final chance they offer a sale of 2 footlongs for $11.99 the catch is it has to be the 2ft bread. Which is not fresh left over made yesterday. They will not substitute it with fresh bread. Very fishy. So do not spent any money here. I sure wont.,b1ERpkqHrfeCnLloGtNpsA,2,1,1,njs5vwUp3adV7xemJaxfag

3519802,2015-05-17,22,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,"I called in a phone order for the 2 foot ($11.99 plus tax) cold sub special and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes or less. When I arrived there were no customers inside and no employees in sight. Finally a guy came from the back and said he'd be right with me. Inside was clean, but the veggies and other selections to choose from weren't looking so fresh. Had I walked in and placed the order in person instead of over the phone, I wouldn't have ordered honestly after seeing that. I let the guy know I placed a phone order and gave him my name. He rung me up and gave me the order. They don't have the stamp card here anymore and wouldn't accept the one I had, so keep that in mind of you have a one. The guy was though nice and friendly.

Classic Sub #1 - I chose white bread and this sandwich comes with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni and provolone cheese. Sounds great right? Well my sandwich looked skimpy for the description of the sandwich. I remember POS tasting much better and getting a bigger portion back in the day. The bread seemed like it might have been from the day before and wasn't so fresh. The lettuce had a nasty ""bag mix"" taste and the meat and cheese tasted just so-so. I've definitely had better from other sandwich spots.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,39,34,2,hWcn4pc7pALOjbJGvIl6iw
3559316,2018-05-08,0,izvmwI3kSYIt-a6vA4gUMw,I ordered two sandwiches an XL number 1 and a Lg number 5 the XL sandwich was wrapped and in the bag neatly. The Lg sandwich was a bit messy causing the sandwich to literally come out the wrapping and into the bag. We called the store and was told that they wrap there sandwiches really good and it's probably how we take them out. Basically stating that it was our fault. So we asked for the general manager number and was told there register was closed and the phone number was in there to call back the next morning. Really a phone number is locked away she claimed she was the manager. No resolution $25 bucks I spent there yes 1 sandwich was fine but I paid almost $10 bucks for a sandwich in a bag. Waist of money and waist of time calling them.,aw8Sr61ElGkv8YWmrC6VVg,1,0,1,8xs0_WoknjJeFKf-TqfHJg

I get the tuna every time. I love that it is solid white , as opposed to chunk light. Veggies are crisp , bread doesn't come soggy like other port of subs. I'd recommend for lunch or an on the go sandwich.",CmaFYyhgk8DJBxHFND0jGw,0,0,4,hM7AWFBkP_WjzY0ohwAbQg

Had sandwich made and then was informed the program for rewards is in the process of changing and I could not use it for the free sandwich. Ok I get it, how about honoring my free sandwich I have been saving up points for a year and a half for. You could see it in the computer it was there. I would be fine if I could understand why, but I got a few different answers. If you want to clear this up then contact me. Just don't stab your customers in the back.
