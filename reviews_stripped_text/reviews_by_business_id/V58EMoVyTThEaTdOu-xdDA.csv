1090486,2017-09-18,0,V58EMoVyTThEaTdOu-xdDA,"Came in today. Got a little lost, so it's in the corner of valley view and Ali baba FYI. Place is very nice. Needs a remodeling a little inside. I ask our server and told me they've only been open for 3 months! They will don't have their alcohol license and were out of couple things we had order. Yet the server was very kind and he explained us that they make everything fresh for the week. So maybe I'll try coming in the weekend next time! Loved the food, I had a beef empanada and it was delightful, my sister had a cucumber and tomato salad, to our taste was missing lemon flavor but that's an easy fix (just ask for lemons) drinks are very originals and lastly the server brought us on the house dessert we tried alfajor and brownies with manjar!!! The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars it's because of the items not being available and the liquor license. But I loved service and the atmosphere. Mostly the food. I work near by so I will be coming back to have lunch here again for sure",2hcrCS7wvl8G2qpRQ1IJzQ,2,2,4,gbbjewsCq-D1oDpHq_ZvyQ

1503557,2018-04-18,10,V58EMoVyTThEaTdOu-xdDA,"I have a love/hate relationship with this place: I love them when I can get to them, I hate that they're only open weekdays. Unless I am off work, I literally cannot come here. Which is a shame, because their empanadas are great and I have been wanting to try their lomito sandwich and other items. 

The empanadas are available in chicken, beef, ham and cheese, corn, mushroom and blue cheese, and vegetable varieties- and so far the mushroom version is my favorite, and freshly made to order. Buy way more than you think you'll need because once you try them, you won't want to share. Anxious for summer break to get here so I can pop by regularly and try more of the menu!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,16,4,CMJN3UkWQGy3NKMFEL6SVg

2107259,2018-03-30,0,V58EMoVyTThEaTdOu-xdDA,"This place is a real jewel, hidden in an industrial area just off of Valley View near the Strip in Las Vegas.

We saw a sign for Gyros and Argentinian food and had to stop, and we came into this place to be greeted by amazing smells of cooking and a friendly couple who own and run this wonderful hybrid place.

The chicken kabobs are laid out on a bed of rice with perfect seasoning, along with grilled onions and peppers, and the portions are huge. My wife had the beef kabobs, and the empanadas and fell in love.

They have spinach and blue cheese, and a variety of flavors and if you're lucky you'll come in on a day when they have a daily special of white fish in sauce...

Try the little cupcake sized quiche looking things called casanidas (I think) which are warm, gooey and wonderful.

We have offices across the street and now dine here on a regular basis or get take-out...either way we lucked out when we moved into this area.",meAqVqrlW24jSP94-zf3FQ,2,1,5,IRAChsbw-l6-oNAmYUdy_A

The empanadas were perfectly baked, the chimichurri was delicious with a little kick to it, and the crepes with dulce de leche were a sweet finish. Everything was made in house and the server was very personable. I'd give it a 5, but service is a little slow so this is more for when you can sit down and relax.

2899109,2018-01-12,0,V58EMoVyTThEaTdOu-xdDA,"Saw this restaurant at Ali Baba and Valley View and the sign said serving Shawarma & Falafal, so I had to stop in!! I'm glad I did. Made in Argentina is really really good. I had the (Chicken Empanada's) little half moon hand held meat pies and there are many different fillings to chose from including:  beef, chicken, spinach, blue cheese, onions, ham & cheese, veggie, mushrooms & corn. Of course my eyes were bigger than my stomach so I ordered the (Shawarma Plate) and this dish is a must try for anyone who loves Middle Eastern food. From the super smooth and creamy humus, to the super fresh chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and fresh basmati rice to the perfectly cooked and crisped chicken bits and don't let me forget the warm and fresh pita bread, this dish is a world class home run!!!

The owner is working and serving food along with the other pleasant and knowledgeable staff. The restaurant is inviting and super clean. I will definitely be back.",WhJ43t6himunFfV0lgbhTg,4,1,5,svTxYlnJsNZ2wUGlfLwtAw

A wonderful mixture of Argentina fare and Greek food. After ordering five items off the menu, Pablo brought us a complimentary flan dessert. Thank goodness he did! It was epic. Try the empanadas. Such a light flaky crust, and really inexpensive. $2.10. Try the pickled eggplant too. The complimentary herb dressing is divine!

The chimichurri had a nice kick.  The choripan reminded me of Argentina as a child.  We had the mil ojas for desert and it was excellent as well.  The owner gave us a warm welcome.  The waitress was equally friendly.  Nice down to earth place for a family friendly meal.  Nice expansion to the side with larger private area for parties. The owner said is expanding to serve parrillada soon, looking forward to it in our next visit! Gracias mi amigo!

Tasty empanadas that come in many varieties, I stocked up on one of each so I could take some home and enjoy them later as well. 

Friendly service and homemade Argentinian treats, what's not to like.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,6,4,5PWy63gwZTmkrmsroRz6gA
