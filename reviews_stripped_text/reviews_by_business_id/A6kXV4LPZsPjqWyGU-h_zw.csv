167853,2016-03-08,1,A6kXV4LPZsPjqWyGU-h_zw,"FOOD:
We always have a pretty good experience at all KFC locations. At this one, however, we did not. We ordered the ""$5 Fill Up: Chicken Breast"". We mostly got what we paid for in the sense that no items were missing from our order. Two things were disappointing though: 1) When my husband (who's always the faster eater) said: ""mm, I love this ice cream"" and I looked up and realized the amount and presentation of the mashed potatoes made it look like a single ice cream scoop with some syrup poured over it and it's nowhere near the usual ""single serving""/""small side"" size. 2) The chicken ""breasts"" were tiny and had dark, greasy meat. My guess (without actually breeding or chopping up chickens on a regular basis) is that we got thighs. They were tiny and the amount of meat compared to the usual breast was about 1/3. 

STAFF/LOCATION:
I also felt bad for the one person working the counter. He obviously didn't have time for everyone, taking orders, putting them together, serving. After we ordered and sat down for a while, I heard what sounded like a knocking a few times and I realized what looked like a mirror on the wall above us was actually a dark and highly reflective window looking out from the kitchen. Our server was knocking at us to come pick up our food! I went over to the counter and told him ""oh, I thought I heard something"" and he handed over the food and that was it. Funny! Obviously, he didn't have time to come out and hand it to us, nor did he have any help. I couldn't see how well staffed the rest of the place was, but it might be safe to assume they were understaffed too. The lobby was pretty clean though and even the bathroom wasn't too bad for a public one.",_g2mH-5oOIdHJ_5Q4NqRog,1,0,1,nbmLvDDtmUlCqPO-93iFvw

Customer service was slow and a little on the rude side.  We asked if we could get legs and wings since the meal was mainly for our kids and we were told no problem.  I have to learn to check orders before we leave but I don't understand why we have to.  If we told them what we wanted and they put it on the receipt then why can't the order get right.  It was not just original in the container and it also had thighs and breasts.  My kids were not happy.  We also ordered this with mashed potatoes, cole slaw (which was dry) and the potato wedges.  No potato wedges but instead another mashed potatoes and gravy.  Didn't want to go back and deal with the poor customer service.  KFC seems to be really loosing the quality of product.  Seems like that is happening across the board.  Maybe it is time to bring back the mom and pop restaurants.",T3_Maz72KRLYWY9a1qWYQg,0,0,1,k0Pz4wvDmGRT_9loLRk4YA
