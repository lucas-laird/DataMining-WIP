I said that was fine but I was probably going to have a slice or two from the one they had because we already waited about an hour for deliver.  
The pizza gets there and they made a smaller one than the one I had ordered which to me is unacceptable, if i paid for another size. 
I did not call back because we were already hungry but ill make sure not order from here again.  Which its unfortunate  because I love supporting small businesses.

1464884,2013-09-20,6,KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA,"Hubby and I were craving pizza so I started to fix it homemade. He came in with the mail and in the stack was a flyer for this place.
Hmmmmmm...their menu actually looked pretty good so he said we should give it a try!
I ordered a Greek salad with no feta, a large Pesto Speciality Pizza with no feta and there was a coupon for a free medium one topping (with large specialty pizza) so we got a medium mushroom with no cheese.
The young lady that I spoke to on the phone was super nice and the total was about $30 before tip. 

EXACTLY 45 minutes later (as promised) it arrived at the door and WOW was I impressed...a big tip was granted, how awesome?! 

The salad was suuuuuper fresh mixed greens, cucumbers, olives, tomatoes and a really fab homemade balsamic vinaigrette.

The medium mushroom, no cheese was perfect. Super fresh sliced baby bella's, crisp but not too crispy crust and a perfect tomato sauce. Their sauce is not overpowering, not too much of any one herb. 

The Pesto pizza no feta.......wow...just wow. Same crust but it was lightly smeared (not coated) with a basil EVOO blend. I would not consider it a sauce or even a heavy pesto. Which in this case it was perfect. You could taste it was pesto but it was not chunky or gooey. The artichokes were awesome, the green peppers were perfect...everything about this pizza was perfect.

If you are familiar with Z Pizza in Seattle...this rivals that place. Flavor and quality.

On the quest for amazing pizza...I really think this place is a little gem. The secret in probably in those amazing stone ovens...
I need to actually go to the place and meet said ovens...

And they are not selfish when it comes to giving you the ranch and etc the only negative was the delivery driver who didn't want to give me my whole change as he was expecting me to give him a tip I gave him a tip but that's not the point I shouldn't have to give you a tip because you tell me to or how much you want I give you a tip if I feel you deserve one.

I popped in for a solo lunch and snagged the personal Eggplant Ricotta pizza with added pesto. Love that seasoned crust and the pesto made it pop. Everything was made to order, including the eggplant. The personal size is huge and I still had a slice left.

Dinner plans were a bust so I took a Family Meal special over to a friend's house for a group gathering: 1 large 1 topping pizza, 6 wings, and 6 garlic knots for $20, not bad at all! Even adding a second topping, tax, and tip, was still like $25. The 'za was devoured, the hot wings were fought over, and the garlic knots are dusted with powder and served with sauce rather than the dripping, buttery kind. I still enjoyed them and didn't feel like I was gaining a pound a minute.

My son actually ate the crust and he is a no crust person. That right there sealed the deal for us. Everyone on staff had a smile on their face and made us feel welcome and it was nice and clean. A definite bonus for us to come back besides the awesome food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.,8OuhgVDjoA1qcfTyy2ZIOg,2,1,5,vOBN84G5R1csuc9DoAwB0g

About a month later when we were back in that neighborhood we tried again, and Im glad we did. 

We had an appetizer with hummus and pita bread, cucumbers, pepperchinis and olives. The homemade hummus was delicious and the pitta was warm and soft. it was a very tasty appetizer especially with the cucumber and olives. 

The pizza we ordered was called ""hearty veggie""  It was a white pizza using Alfredo sauce . Artichokes, garlic, onion and some other ingredients made it a super tasty pie, I added a little sirracha to mine and was in heaven. 

The atmosphere wasn't spectacular, it felt very crammed and messy, but we ate great pizza and thats really the most important thing. Plus the staff were very nice, the pizza maker was proud of his pizza and put a lot of love into it.  I like that.

I went into this place expecting pretty delicious pizza and I was not disappointed at all. I bought for a small moving group and everyone loved it. The crust is thin but thick all in one cooked to perfection.

The sauce. Oh the sauce. It is homemade and using it to dip the garlic knots is like dipping a magically toasted bun of perfection into a sauce that has traveled the galaxies more than once to get its perfect flavor. Definitely get extra.

The pricing is great as well I bought for a small group and spent about $20 and had leftovers for tomorrow.

On a last note I love that's it's close and the owner George is so awesome, he gives great service to his customers!",Hhmwl8u4ZxkBW1mGnJEUxw,3,3,5,NGi3uQVnJ71s2zkXELD8Tw

I was browsing Yelp and saw they had a $10 for $20 special, which gave me more incentive to give it a go. Got the Greek Marathon specialty pizza, which was a ""Must Try"" without onions. Instead of red sauce, I picked to switch it to a creamy garlic sauce. Delicious. The staff got straight to work and had it done within ten minutes, which was super nice. I tend to only get cheese pizzas, but I thought it would be a crime not to get something different. Luckily, I was in the right to choose something different for once. It tasted like... biting into a gyro without the meat. The garlic and feta combo was perfect! 

The only thing to complain about is the decor. It screams old pizza joint which I thought was weird because they just opened. I didn't really mind cause I was grabbing it to go, but it struck me as odd. 

But overall, it was a spectacular expedience with the food and staff. I will definitely have to come back to try other pizzas soon!",NXmerbo1SM4_JUWcckkLcg,4,3,4,yKDKmIEbcNQq97D0RTbIkA

Called ahead to find out what the Gluten Free crust had for ingredients. John told me to be patient he had another customer on the other line. I told him to go right ahead, he was super polite.  When he came back on the line he mentioned they bought the Gluten Free dough from a actual bakery out here in town. It was made of Chick Peas.  I asked if they used real olive oil he said yes. I asked about Corn and he said the owner does not like using Corn meal and that there was none on the premises.

Stopped in tonight around 5PM (busiest hour). John was the only man in the kitchen. He held it down too. He took an order before us & then ours. When he served them their big order (bigger than ours 6 pizzas).  He had ours ready in the box hot & fresh to go. I was amazed he could handle the kitchen by his lonesome.

Now for the pizza. I ordered a Gluten Free ($12.99) White pizza w/ ($1) Black Olives, TO GO. The pizza was seasoned with creamy garlic sauce. It was NOT greasy, just enough oil to cook the pizza to perfection. Think about the ingredients you choose if don't want a greasy pizza.

Coupons on their website. PICK UP SPECIAL LARGE 1 topping pizza $8.88.

I suggest DINE IN or TAKE OUT.  Check in on Yelp and get a free Cheesecake or Chocolate mousse. We LOVE to split the Mousse cake & enjoy it slowly. It's waaaay rich and delicious. Super good food, and makes the perfect date spot with a free slice of cake. Great staff, quiet place to enjoy a date night.

 Best pizza in town, I would say it's on the same par as Grimaldi's but WAY cheaper than buying an $18 pizza (plus toppings).",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,8,1,5,pnajkfERRvIqThg1CQ_dxA

Saw spaghetti And meatballs on special. Looks like it may have been on special board for a little while as chocolate worn out. I ordered it and what came out appeared that it may have been made several days ago, back when they wrote that on the board. 

Marinara sauce was darkest color I have ever seen and not very pleasant taste. Possibly burn? Meatballs were only partially reheated and a quiet room temperature and had very soggy Texter to them. Taste was not great, maybe due to sauce or maybe due to temperature or combination of both. 

Anyways I took one bite of the spaghetti and tasted the meatball And informed the person upfront that it was not at all good and explained why. He did offer to make me a pizza instead, but I guess it may have had the same problem with lack of freshness as they were more focused on remodeling. 

I told him I was going to go to eat at a sandwich shop nearby instead. He did not offer to refund the money that I was made to prepay when I ordered. Now I know why they have people pay before they eat. So I paid for a lunch that I never did get to eat, not recommended at all.",j5imk-8npEX_a2_v9WLCpg,0,0,1,Tx3in1v7V5jMLe0YI8JVog

A+ option if you're looking for an easy meal option and you're not wanting to go to a big chain.,moC2fR1BuTXjfcDRyvg-nw,0,1,4,hvoYFZJFqJXjIrDuVzPxFQ
5437025,2013-10-16,2,KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA,"Ordered a caramelized XL pizza which was fresh tasting and cooked properly, about 4 stars :) Definitely needed a little more sauce, barely any on it, and more shrooms for my $2 up charge.

Up charging me $2 to swap shrooms for roasted garlic after telling me $1 over the phone :(

You're a small pizza shop, who in my opinion, should swap out a topping for nothing if you want to stay in business instead of trying to nickel & dime your customers. And on top of that there weren't very many on them either.

Definitely could've been friendlier over the phone and in person, the girl working tonight. The actual dining area is small and is set up more for eating a quick slice rather than going to dinner there.

So, $26 pizza with an additional $2 for barely any mushrooms plus tax, minus $5 due to website coupon, ended up being $25 out the door. Way overpriced compared to what else you can get locally with the same quality of ingredients.

So, when looking at the star descriptions, ""Meh. I've experienced better"", was the appropriate rating.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,4,3,2,Ehck0VB9bdTKjDpYmOxlug

5594795,2017-04-25,0,KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA,"My bf and I were able to meet the owner George the first time we ever tried out Pizzalicious.  He was very kind and accommodating.  When he found out it was our first time  he was very sweet and hooked up our pizza with extra toppings and told us his story of how he started and where he was from.  What I liked most was his passion for what he did and his pride for his work and his product.  It was definitely a great first impression and I loved the personalization and enthusiasm for his business. As for the pizza  it was really good the crust was so crusty and crispy you'd think it was fried, but soft and chewy on the inside .  Definitely going to continue supporting and frequenting this place any time I'm in the mood for pizza:",97bIIVHvtKGJbSwv2Slf9g,2,1,5,uzXmi_HfmPgucl2py-Lwvw

George the owner was there and made out pizzas himself. He told us his brick ovens are 15 years old which is exciting if you know pizza. The pizza was a nice classic old school pizza. Lightly crispy and chewy crust. Very happy to have a good independently owned spot by the house to order from.",rtqecF2RWslQyzvcCeom6w,0,0,5,gA7OjVbEKyxsbTsQ85OwBA

Probably the biggest waste of money I have ever wasted. I ordered wings, mild w/blue cheese dip, and I received a sopping soggy wet mess of so called ""chicken wings"" and of course, no dipping sauce which was paid for. 

Second, I order their French Fries Supreme, which was less than mediocre. These fries came in cold and soggy and missing half the ingredients. They arrived with no cheddar cheese and no pepperoncinis.. just looks like fries with a small touch of jalapeños and some hard white substance that resembles that of Elmers Glue.

Lastly, I ordered their Italian Sub.. this sandwich is one that would make any TRUE Italian embarrassed to say this came out of their kitchen... 

DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.. IF YOU DO, YOU MIGHT AS WELL FLUSH YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET.. CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU'LL GET.. SH¡T!!!",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,5,0,1,qaJE0DWyvUOLtwg07veSCQ

We ordered the Maui Maui pizza and antipasta salad which were both delicious! The highlights of the pizza were the amazing pizza sauce, which was full of spices for extra flavor, and the crust was reeeally good and I'm not a big crust person. It was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, the toppings were also great. Mainly the meat. Which brings me to the antipasta salad, the highlight was definitely the meat and cheese! The lettuce was crisp and fresh (no icky brownish pieces) and the meat and cheese was no store bought plain old ham. It tasted like it was from an Italian deli, full of flavor. I'll certainly be ordering from them again and can't wait to try their sandwiches and appetizers!",IK3ESfOGnftvxFRoBXiLlw,2,1,4,Awr2c7zUFK4QWHF5SOBRWA

I ordered a cold Italian sub opened it up at home it was cooked and soaked in Italian dressing. Tasted ok I ate it I was hungry but would have preferred it cold the way it was ordered. Ordered a side of fries damn they were horrible. Totally under cooked looked pale white and tasted Just uncooked. we threw them out. Could have used a decent amount of more time in the deep frier. At least the salad was correct. Don't know if I'd go back honestly wasn't worth raving about. Would be open to trying the pizza possibly.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,iM81l72XuEn7Bj52c8PC0Q

I can't remember who I spoke to- Brad or Brian?  I ordered a large 1/2 cheese 1/2 pep saus and onion with a Greek salad.  They had a coupon for $16.99.  He said it would be about 45 minutes.  No problemo- about 50 minutes later I was wondering and they called me!  The driver had an issue at a previous delivery and was running late but he just left with my freshly made pizza.  He took $5 off for being late.  

The pizza was awesome.  For $16.99 a 3 item large pizza and Greek salad.  The pizza was great and hot and the salad was fresh!  Will definitely order here again.",tVfXQdrxKSYX9rmjl_BI5Q,7,2,5,rKjBJfFg-DhV3vuqc8qxVA
