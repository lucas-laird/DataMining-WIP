It's a much more intimate setting and the service at the daybeds and cabanas are the best I've had in Vegas. The food served at the pool is top notch.

If you want a debaucherous party, this may not be your cup of Jaeger. If you are looking for something a little more upscale where only 500 people are going to see you topless, this is the place to go.

The staff was very friendly and attentive (Josh, Nadene, and Brian - whose Celtics just couldn't put it together :) ).  The kobe burger was excellent. The drinks were strong. And the people were not only gorgeous but down to earth and easy to talk with. The smaller pool helps initiate conversations. 

At one point, around noon, I counted 15 or 16 beautiful women and 4 guys (myself included).  It picked up around 2 but still had a good ratio. My friends blew it while I had a great time. =)

215318,2016-04-21,0,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"BE CAREFUL!!  My friends and I bought tickets to enjoy the pool party for my birthday.  It wasn't until we went through the most intense security I have ever been part of, did we find out that if we wanted to sit down on a day bed or even sit on a chair we would have to pay extra.  We were told we could sit pool side and when I sat down in the ONLY space big enough for 3 of us, security yelled at me to get up. This should have been mentioned somewhere online when you buy your tickets - in order to sit down you have to pay EXTRA.  We weren't the only ones fooled, 3 guys spent $90 to get in and had the same issue. 

If you want to enjoy this pool party, be prepared to pay a lot of $, which I know is how Vegas does it.  But what pisses me off is no mention of what your actual ticket gets you once you at the pool. 

And when I called Hakkasan group for my money back as I was dissatisfied, I was told no refunds.  I guess there is no such thing as customer service anymore.",HBfTpCAftldEYPIL0SU7pw,2,0,1,vDleFP_ItNM5ISqCKCKdnA

He used to travel here all the time for work too so we can pretty much entertain ourselves anywhere. The Liquid Lounge may be the first place we left within 1 drink and 20 mins. Might as well be Kindergarten with the rules... Couldn't even have a towel or shoes with you if you didn't buy a bed. I mean seriously I felt like I was putting my things in a cubby and asking for permission to go to the bathroom in order to wear shoes!

They took my credit card and loosed it, they requiring to have it taken when you order more then one drink, later i found out someone actually used it, i won't be surprise if its one of their employees, just worst shady bad experience i have ever had!

You got that?? they taking your credit card, it required for getting drinks to you, but they have it somewhere unsecured. 

When I asked to get it back they didn't find it.

When I started to get upset was worst experience ever, just shady answers, made me feel like I did something wrong ***they*** loosed my credit card.

they don't care about their customers at all, we asked to speak to a supervisor, when he finally showed up he was so rude we regret we even bother.

The biggest problem was they didn't let us go anywhere because we had open check of over $2000, but I wasn't able to pay it because they didn't find my card!!

my friends had to figure the check out.

Later I found someone charged my card, I bet one of their employees, so I had to contact the credit card company and deal with all this mess after Vegas trip.

They don't belong to Aria Resort, when we complained about them to the Aria we been told they are independently owned.


We spent there over $2000, it was 6 of us.

accept that we had good time before all that happened, but its not worth it, go somewhere who appreciate your business, somewhere who will not try to steal your money .

The DJ was great last year when I went (3lau was playing - one of my favorite DJs) so it was a great time. I just didn't enjoy the venue and the vibes as much as I did at Marquee. I was quite reluctant to come back here this year, knowing that I could go to another pool party. However, Illenium was playing and my group wanted to see him. My second time here was a way better experience! We got there early enough so we were able to reserve some space on the pool side. There were a lot of space to dance in the pool and by the DJ booth. A group who had a day bed right next to the pool were really nice and let me dance in their area, so the vibes were much better this year around! I honestly think that whether you have fun or not here is all up to you. I was completely sober and had a lot of fun dancing by myself! The main reason for the 3 stars is just the venue itself compared to other pools on the strip :) Whether I will be back or not will depend on who is playing at the time.

1347252,2012-06-16,7,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"I would have to completely disagree with Nicole B.'s review of Liquid.  Liquid is NOT a wannabe Wet Republic.  The two have very different objectives, and its very apparent.  Wet Republic is 100 times larger than Liquid and is more of that Rowdy, Crazy Party environment.  Liquid is much more relaxed and low-key.  As for the no seating comment, Uhhhh RESERVE A CABANA OR A DAYBED OR A CHAIR, DUH! They are actually quite reasonably priced.

On a Saturday, the Lounge chair at Liquid is only $100 and it includes food and drink for up to $100.  The Daybeds were $300 and could comfortably fit 3 people.  What I love about reserving this is that they have little storage containers where you can put all of your belongings, as well as a bucket to keep your champagne, or beers or whatever you drink cool.  The food they serve here is pretty good as well, for poolside.

If You are looking for a REHAB, TAO BEACH, or WET REPUBLIC type of atmosphere, this is NOT the place for you!!!  LIQUID is much smaller, but still has a great DJ and relaxed vibe, but still very fun! I will most certainly return and reserve a Daybed because it is WORTH it!

As a guest of the Aria hotel, I expect a little civility when asking a question of a member of the staff. Four bouncers were standing around and when I tried to ask what time the pool opens, is there a charge, is there a waiting list and then I was ignored, and the people behind me were ushered in. It is very simple if someone asks a question answer it. 

All other experiences I have had at this hotel have been wonderful, the rooms, casino, and food service have all exceeded my expectation. The Liquid Pool Lounge is owned by the Light group who I assume pay a concession to the Aria Hotel (MGM International) in order maintain this facility. Aria, the Liquid Pool Lounge is dimming your stars.

As a professor of Hospitality Management in Florida, I will be using this as an example of what not to do.

Liquid was by FAR our favorite pool!! Super clean and definitely more fun compared to the other pools we had gone to. We got a cabana right next to the dj booth and danced our butts off all day! 

Our server, Brandi was amazing! Super friendly, fast, and made sure we had everything we wanted. She even recommended some apps for us to snack on (keep us going after a few drinks ;) ) which came out in the perfect amount of time and were delicious! 

The security guys (at a different pool the day before) had been total jerks to us. Which made us nervous about the rest of the weekend...The security at Liquid changed everything. They were VERY nice and didn't make us feel uncomfortable at all! We got through and made it quickly to our table.

We got into Liquid around noon and it was pretty slow.  Since there were in and out privileges we went to and from our main cabana and here... with the free vodka... why not? 

The place seemed to start getting busy around 2PM, but the place was never super crowded... which was much to my liking. 

The free entrance was a bit weird.  We were given wristbands for the free drinks, but when we got to the door they said without the ""card"" to get in, we'd have to pay $20 each.  Since one of the promoters were there, he gave us cards and they made it seem like a big deal that we got cards saying ""okay... now that you have cards you can come in, but normally it's $20.""  So the ""cards"" to get us in were literally in our hands for less than a second... my girlfriends and I just thought it wasn't necessary.  I mean... they already gave us the wristbands and told us to head over for free drinks and they give us a hard time to get in, yet they give us a daybed for free... it just wasn't consistent.  

Aside from that little randomness at the front, the place is nice, clean and not too crowded.  The group there was definitely more of a party crowd than the main Aria pool so it was nice to go from one scene to another.",wWXcjHOsACqRyoCT6wKZEQ,3,2,3,2pkxbEcxRQntWuae-UKdfA

The service made up for it though with the pool boys attending to your every need, even fixing your towels! 

We chose to sit in the shaded area to avoid sunburn and when we asked to be moved to the sunny area because it got cold, they kept giving us the runaround about the chairs that were there were reserved and not available, when no one even showed up. 

The infinity pool was cool, but the pool toys were the worst idea EVER with drunk d-bags throwing them everywhere and splashing everyone with the water guns. People would hit the beach balls an they would go flying everywhere knocking over drinks. 

The pool toys need to go. Three stars for service and scene, minus two for required $50 minimum and pool toys.",EQ-BZ5Xq84oW_Oh5nudMyw,0,1,3,XQnptSVxH1cM29T_Wk3f1w

Well, i report it to a security that was actually sympathetic and nice. He then said i needed to speak to the security manager at liquid. Understandable, but when we walked to the front they said the manager was busy dealing with a bigger issue. So we waited... he gets there and is just plain rude as were the rest of the security team at the entrance! Gave me a business card and said call later.

When we arrived, the music was not working! Oh no!!  The host said that there was a power outage, but it should be back on soon.  We were contemplating leaving, but we were able to negotiate a good deal on a daybed (just $250 F&B minimum for our group of 6), so we decided to stay.

This was definitely my speed, as far as pool parties go. Nice atmosphere, not too big, not overcrowded, but still a fun crowd.

Drinks were pretty pricey, with their ""specialty"" cocktails being $15 each. You could, however, buy 32 oz drinks in a Liquid sports cup (that you keep) for $30.  One note- the Watermelon cocktail is VERY sweet. I like sweet drinks, but this was even too much for me.

I usually stay at all the MGM affiliate Hotel and resorts. I have been to Liquid before when Adam's cousin and her fiancé stayed there. They had a suite there so we had access to everything cool the Aria has to offer. We decided to bring ourselves to Liquid. When we got in, there was no where to sit unless you had a daybed or cabana. They said that you could purchase one. We decided to purchase one between the four of us and got to lay down, enjoy the DJ, get our drinks brought to us, and also ordered food. Obviously we ran up quite a tab. It was a great time, however I didn't like the fact that you did not have an option to get the bed. Otherwise, if you do not have one there is no where to sit and really no where to go. If you do plan to go to Liquid, go there with the intention of spending some money. Of course, if you're in a large party it would probably not be too bad to split it, but if it's just a few of you I hope that you are able to know someone there, because it can get expensive. If you are a platinum member, you will not need to wait in line, nor should you have to pay. Otherwise, if you don't get in before 2 PM they sometimes charge the guys. Unless it's a holiday weekend it shouldn't be too tough to get in. The DJ is good, the drinks are good, and the overall ambience is good. I don't know if it's worth all of your money, good.

2192411,2012-06-27,11,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"For what it is, Liquid really excels. The problem this ""exclusive"" pool faces is that there are so many others in Las Vegas to compare it to, and thus people wind up making poor comparisons to things which aren't really alike. If you're planning to come to Liquid because you think it might be similar to the atmosphere at TAO Beach, Encore, Wet Republic, or other similar mega pool parties, then save yourself the money and the subsequent public whining, and just go to those places. I wouldn't quite call this space intimate, because there are still a couple hundred people here on a busy day, but it's definitely smaller in scale and goes for a more luxury appeal (appropriately situated at the high class Aria resort).

The main Aria pool complex is pretty huge, so it's no wonder that more people don't try to get into Liquid, but it also explains why the promo ladies are constantly out patrolling with more free passes to get people in. Despite what some of the other reviews might say about ""being cute getting you nowhere"" here, I saw several ladies getting in for free. We personally got in free along with quite a lot of additional stuff thanks to a friend of ours who works for the company, but I would have rated Liquid the same without all the complimentary stuff.

For the particular day I visited Liquid was exactly what I needed, a smaller spot to hang out with my friends on our day bed (which has a nice storage compartment for your belongings as well as multiple ice buckets for champagne, liquor bottles, mixers, and bottled water), listen to some pretty good DJ tunes, quickly add to the lingering buzz from the night before (with extra help from the super expedient service staff), and get a lot of bonus eye candy from the podium dancers. There are several points during the day where the DJ encourages everyone to splash the hell out of the pool though, so just be warned you might get your precious hair wet.

While our immediate waitress and pool boy (or whatever these guys are called) were superb in their execution, the door staff did leave most of us with a bitter memory of Liquid. They are completely unnecessarily dickish here and definitely do not offer an inviting atmosphere. At one point Vidal left to get money from the ATM and come right back to tip the employees, only to get flack from one of the bouncers who quizzed him repeatedly before finally allowing him to return. I had the same thing happen to me when I went upstairs to the room to get my sunglasses and returned without my ID (which was poolside). My arm was clearly stamped for re-entry, but he felt the need to give me the cold stare down and accompanying inquiries... sorry mate, I don't budge for anyone, let alone Pool Patrol.",hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA,19,12,4,DKGuVb9Oc-nwOluR56w9fw

The drinks were pricey, but they were well made and the bartenders were friendly and efficient. We received free passes from a promoter ""baby usher"".

They never over packed the place so there was always room to walk around and have your own space. It felt somewhat like a relaxed day at a really nice pool, alas there were still a few crazy people who are doing all the wrong things in a very public place. Seriously, do they know we're staring at them not bc they're hot but instead a hot mess? Children, we are in Vegas that doesn't mean you still don't have a last name that your mom/dad would very much appreciate you not putting to shame. 

Grandma set aside, Liquid is a place you go for some good music (a DJ spins) and good food!! I'm not lying when I say their mahi mahi tacos were one of tastiest I've had. I promise if you try them they won't disappoint. Only issue is that they make you eat it at the bar, I'd rather eat it where I'm sitting so I can take my time. I had to throw out one of the taco's bc I didn't have space in my tum. 

All in all the decor is pretty and the place is new and fresh so if you're feeling in the mood for drinks and music by the pool I'd recommend it.",lCkqOtZZ_Sz_WKThOjakMQ,3,1,4,ktCOrHW-Yo0sh9nx1Ed8bQ

Apparently, for Liquid, you can't book through concierge, you have to contact the Liquid host directly.

I went to the Liquid web site, filled out the questionnaire and sent it in.  Within an hour I received the following e-mail reply from a Marc Kmetz at Liquid:

        ""Feel free to contact me at your leisure to discuss Liquid pricing/options.""

That's all that was written in that e-mail.

There was no ""Good morning, Mr. Mike G."" nor ""Thank you for considering Liquid as your vacation destination.""

Plus, I already contacted Liquid ""at my leisure."" It's their job to give me a call if they want me to spend my money there.

This is starkly different from when I booked a cabana through the concierge. I spoke with him on the phone about pricing and availability, and I received an e-mail confirmation within minutes.

Then I checked the Yelp reviews on Liquid. All I can say is, I'm glad I'm not taking the risk and spending my money in Liquid.

And as for Mr. Kmetz . . . You, sir, should take some management, public service or public relations classes. What a turn-off your cold, unfriendly, and unprofessional e-mail response was.",3aVJ-B-FlJuBbdV6voC9lQ,9,0,1,DXS-e_YWCGrdOkGX08m0dg

2902599,2017-07-02,1,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"After an incredibly disappointing experience at Wet Republic, we found ourselves at Liquid. Defeated, hungry, and drained from 111 degree weather, we lowered our expectations and gave Liquid a chance. This day club is located at Aria. It is definitely not as big or popular as other day clubs. Jennifer D's promoter was able to walk us in without any hassle. 

The crowd is definitely a mixed one, however a really fun one. I met a few friends from Texas in the pool. Everyone is obviously here to: #1) look good but also #2) have a good time. Even though the pool was fairly crowded, if someone accidentally bumped into me, they would almost immediately apologize. Not an aggressive or rowdy crowd at all. 

The music featured DJ Shift the day we were there. Loved that he played more hip hop than EDM. It was a good change from most of the nightclubs and kept us dancing the whole afternoon. 

Other day clubs have some planters or random areas where people will (at their own risk) store their clothes and belongings. There's not really anywhere to do that here. So if you don't have a cabana, plan on renting a $30 locker to hold your things. 

Since we hadn't eaten anything all day, we ordered food from the bar. Nachos and curly fries. The toppings on the nachos were surprisingly fresh, but other than that it was standard bar food. Only downside was not really having a place to eat. We stood at a reserved table and thankfully they kicked us out when we had essentially finished our food. 

Would I come back? If the opportunity came up, but I'll keep the memories of a super fun and successful Saturday afternoon here.",tlxpbxBH8tNdM5bUmt4iww,4,3,4,OLm_kZGahnzLuEkg_3MJBg

I understand that they don't want to have liability issues, but I need my sunscreen and I'm not going to be devastated if someone steals it.  Plus, how do you expect me to pay for my drinks if I'm expected to tip the (incredibly rude) bag- guy every time I have to get my money?  He actually said to us ""You know, the expected tip is $10"".  Umm...no.  And he wants that every time we have to get it?

Basically, everyone here needs to chill out.

On the other hand, I did have a great time and it's much more laid back than the other pools, but it still has a party vibe.  The pool is a small, but decent size in comparison to some of the others and everyone gets inside to splash and just have fun.",cE4mGrfBME6g1lLydtNd-Q,14,2,3,QuD9mK7kOc3ar731qpWd5w

We skipped the long line a little past noon on a Saturday cause we had friends throwing a small event there. The bag check was very strict, much more strict than regular pools at Aria. Absolutely NO any type of medications, not even the over the counter ones like tums, band aids, eye drops, Advil or even hand sanitizers! Of course no outside water, beverage, food or alcohol allowed, so put everything away before going in, or they will just take everything and throw them away! 

We ordered bottle of Grey Goose, the pineapple mixer was exceptionally good! I drank so much of it with goose vodka! Also had some appetizers later on, the lobster tacos and shrimp cocktail were so fresh and delicious. Our servers were very attentive and friendly, took really good care of us the entire afternoon. Funny thing was the bartender at the bar asked for my ID when I tried to order a drink and charge to my room, but the other waitress didn't ask for hubby's ID when he ordered bottle of Grey Goose? What's up with that? They needed ID for a 30 bucks Mai Tai, but not a bottle of 500 bucks Goose vodka? It didn't make sense! 

I am not really into pool parties, I don't do well in heat, it wasn't even that hot that day, but I still got really dehydrated afterwards.

The music was good but it was not a crazy pool day party, you weren't allowed to jump around or do anything fun besides hit some inflatable beach balls back and forth. Probably most surprising is how tiny the whole area is, there were less than 20 beds around the pool but you had to reserve them before hand for a substantial fee and they were the ONLY place to sit besides in the water.

I completely understood not getting the free day bed and expected to pay since I showed up so late, but the promoter who was ""hooking me up"" yelled at me like he was my father.

We were about to pay for a day bed, but after walking in to check out the place, decided it was way too crowded and sweaty. There was literally no room to move in the pool.

Fast forward a year later on Memorial Day weekend and it's a completely different story! Of course my sister and my friend(male), and myself (female) are on a guest list for the day party (males and females free before 3p...perfect!), because here we are 1 hour before 3p... well not so perfect because

 #1 they say friend can't come in because they wasn't feeling his short (apparently they didn't fit the Liquid definition of swim shorts) 

# 2 after explaining to the security that the shorts were recently purchased in the store and labeled as swim shorts, we advance in the long line to the ladies that check you in... uh oh guess what! It's a $50 cover for my friend (cuz he's a guy) even though it's nowhere near 3p... we debate but according to the pretty lady ""It's subject to change"" ... so friend exits stage left because he felt it wasn't worth $50... So now frustration is growing. 

#3 FINALLY we get to the front where security is to check bags... I happen to have a small fanny pack with not too much in it... so I thought...well here goes security pulling out two sealed packages of over the counter Advil and tossing them! I'm hella confused but I guess dumb ass policies are in place for a reason. 

Now we in, YAY! 

Packed! DRINK YUM! $45! BOOOO! We chilling out. Enjoying our time, vibing. Then I see the security guy the tossed the ""drugs"" out of my bag earlier walk by us, I figured he's working the inside now.... see him pass by a few more times.... 

We get invited up to the private cabana section, YAY! FOOD YUM! DRINKS FREE! private not crowded pool AWESOME! Next thing I know...

Look who's up in the private section now ""securing shit"" the same security guy that was once outside, then walking around inside, now conveniently walking around the private section... 

30 mins or so later me and sis take a dip... and look who see hovering over us... you guessed it! Security guy! Now he has words, something to the tune of ""where is your cabana"" I tell him the number cabana we are in, then he tells us we have to get out of the pool, and out of the section if we don't have a special stamp! 

Now I'm hella confused because last time me and sis came here we got a cabana and there was no specific stamp for the section... we play nice... we exit the pool... we have security guy talk to the person who invited us to the cabana (he had the EXACT SAME STAMPS WE HAD) he tells security guy we with him... now security guy is ""understanding"" but we ready to exit stage left! 

So if you like looong ass lines
Being lied to about pricing 
Over priced drinks and food 
And over the top security that pretty much stalks and harasses you....

Can I just say that this place is strict! No outside food or drinks (even waters) they make you throw it all away.

Tip is if you hide your crap away from the cameras on the side in a bush so you can retrieve it all later. 

They also do not allow piggy back rides in the water, don't we all piggy back ride in pools for fun?
And this is an adult only pool? weird.  

Squirt guns and the beach balls were fun to play with inside the pool. 

The pool is small I can imagine when it's crowded how packed that pool gets.

Lots of beautiful people soaking up the sun and everyone just having a good time.  Very intimate feeling.  I like the craziness of lots of people but sometimes you just want to chill and be surrounded by beautiful people.

Last week was not so chic.  It was a Hotel guest crowd.  Old and overweight people soaking the sun dancing to house music. Odd and weird and kind of killed the sexiness of what this pool party could be but oh well.   Can't really hate it since it was the opening week for pool parties in Vegas and I am sure all the pretty peeps have not arrived in Vegas yet.  I am sure the crowd will get better.

3751887,2011-09-10,0,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"I recommend reserving and getting a day bed here if a couple or few people.

You'll have places to put your stuff while you get in the pool, with a very shortened wait, and it's just nice to have a space to layout and relax away from the throng of people.   Get there early 11am for the best daybed spot you like.  Your bar minimum will not be cheap, just keep that in mind - but if you're spending 5 hours there, it's worth it.

Captain Morgan girls nearby gave us free drinks and shots all day long.  That was a nice touch - don't expect that though.

Pool is small compared to something like Wet Republic - so if you want a more crazy, party wild scene, go to Wet instead.  This would be more chill, but certainly busy once 1pm rolls around.

I thought the service was excellent (ice always replaced to keep the beers cool).

3855601,2011-06-08,2,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"So it was the Friday morning of the AOD Invasion, and I was faced with the decision of either relaxing at the luxurious Encore adult pool or party my ass off at Liquid. Memories of girls getting carted off in wheelchairs still reminded me that it takes a bit of endurance and party swagger to get through a day at this place. I checked with Team Encore, and they wanted to.. PARTAI. So I had no option but to tough it out. 

I texted Hali that we are coming down and she said no probs. We walked through the corridors of Aria and through the hotel pool and found ourselves at this massive line that ran around the concrete wall. The last time I came here on a Thursday there was actually no line, so my first thought is that 2011 Liquid is more popping then ever. Boy was I ever right! 

I got up to the front and waved Hali down.  She quickly had security put aside the ropes. She asked me how many and also how does the daybed next to the DJ booth sound? We all thought that was a great location. Also our JC member/Mood director of Liquid Pearce Cleaveland will be working there the whole day to cater to all our partying needs. 

We got in and got settled, and our daybed had a great view of all the mayhem that was going on in the pool.  Without having a chance to even put my sunscreen on, Pearce came by with a round of shots for our entire group. Some of the girls couldn't finish the shot so I had to handle it for them.  

I got a chance to roam around and hang out with the AOD members, and everyone was having a good time.  Pearce kept giving shoutouts to the AOD crew at the pool and random strangers saw my AOD dogtag and would come up to me and ask what it stood for. ""Bro is this YOUR party?"" ""Yes this is our party, and we are taking over.""

I don't think I ever got a chance to make it to my daybed without stumbling around this place. Pearce stopped me to do a shot (could've been 5 shots, it was a solid pour from a bottle). People were snapping pics. ""What the first pic didnt go through?"" ""Do it again!"" ""Shit"" So I had do this shot twice: http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/247987_202342743143052_100001019834956_520740_3390033_n.jpg

All in all it was a great day. If we needed an umbrella at our daybed, Pearce made it happen. If we needed more alcohol Pearce made it happen. If we needed someone to get already clinically insane people to get more crazy, Pearce made it happen by giving shoutouts over the mic to all the AOD members. 

I knew it was 5pm when I saw members passed out at random places and getting escorted out. People were dancing then falling over chairs and I had to pick them up. I started drinking water so I can save myself and not be a causality in the evening. The party doesn't stop at the pool for an AOD member, but I can't say Liquid didn't do a number on me. 

Shoutout to- Hali Tendler host at Liquid for making this location happen: http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/255024_202006046510055_100001019834956_518394_4043552_n.jpg

~ Excellent service....I got to pick my chair, the staff was super friendly, and I never waited too long for drinks.

~ Great crowd...this may vary day to day but it's a plus that Liquid doesn't pack people in....there was room to breathe and mingle.

~ Everything is new, cool, and trendy.  This place beats the other admission-only pools...if for no other reason than it's brand-spanking new.

I was attending since for ladies from 11 am to 7 pm they had comp entry. After passing through the pool doors of the Aria I made my way past the two larger pool and to the back where Liquid is located. I arrived there around 12:30 pm and there was about ten people ahead of me. The guests going into Liquid must wear pool type clothes and the dress code is strictly enforced. Once you make it through the security, which is a long encounter. The security here does an extensive look through ladies handbags with a fine took comb and a flashlight. No medication of any kind is permitted, not even Tylenol. If you carry little trial size packages of lipgloss, lipstick, or chap stacks they will be disposed of too. Perfume samples or bottles are not allowed either. This is securities job here and the rules are in place to protect us all.

Once you get through security and get that final duck stamp then the bar is to the left and the DJ to the right. The bar here is more pricey than normal but it is highly touristy here since Liquid Pool is a happening place to be seen at. This would be one of the elite day clubs in Vegas. It is so jumping and the pool is amazing. When I visited it was not too busy yet. One who is here for just general admission has to either stand, go by the pool; but the best advice is to get in the pool after one visits the bar. 
 
The pool was sparkling blue in color with the temperature of the water just perfect. The pool is located so close to the DJ and they were spinning some of the older jams such as Salt n Pepper and Missy Elliot when I got there. They changed the music up around 2 pm when the main DJ got in. He was spinning tracks such as trance and music with lots of bass.

4086209,2013-09-05,3,G5iz09NiHOtAcxAAcMCXzA,"Being a girl in Vegas definitely has its perks, one of them being freebies galore.  We (four girls) were let into Liquid free of charge, had free unlimited champagne until 1 p.m., and we were given a daybed.  I'm surprised we got the daybed because it was Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  However, there weren't a bunch of daybed rentals.  There was great music playing, the water was refreshing, and everyone was super friendly.  Naturally we made friends with guys who also had a daybed and were buying drinks, so that amped up the fun.  I went up to the room earlier than the others, but for one girl, it was her favorite part of the whole trip.  T.I. showed up for a little while too!

Tip:  If you're a girl, don't get the VIP entry/champagne to Liquid as part of your package when you book at Aria.  We changed our reservation so we got entry instead of two buffets.  Entry was free anyway, as was the champagne.  Get the buffets.

One negative: my friend came to the front of the line to get me and she got reprimanded for swearing, which is ridiculous considering everyone had to be 21+ to get in.",owklqVl1fEq5wLoiaMpzCA,9,3,4,uRe3n5Ylpge5udhxPln78g

By that I mean that they are very rude for no reason and they acted like they were working for the CIA, no smiles at all!  

I forgot my license in my hotel room (my fault) and while I stepped aside to look for it  before I realized it wasn't in my bag, the short guy working the entrance said ""You're not getting in here without a license honey!"" ""HONEY!"" I said. I never tried to get in without ID first off, and secondly, I'm not your honey, so don't speak to me like that again! Normally I'm really nice and easy-going, never quick to embarrass others or myself by starting a confrontation, but the way he said that to me felt like he was trying to belittle me and I had to cut that off really quick-like :)

Two of my friends went in and one came back to the other, nicer pool with me while my husband (the guy who has the right to call me honey) ran upstairs to get my license. My friends came back to the nicer pool and explained to me that other than the fact that they have good music, there really isn't a reason to go to liquid.

My husband brought my ID back to me so the girls and I could go listen to some music and try to have a decent time while they went gambling. I figured I'm not going to make a big deal out of the incident earlier, and maybe that guy didn't mean to be rude, so whatevs, we would try out Liquid.  We got in for free, and the drinks were OK. The music was pretty good. A good mix of top 40 and not too much house. The people were really nice, no one was acting drunk or out of control and everyone was getting along and hanging out, so that was really cool. We met a lot of cool people!

THEN, as we were getting out of the pool walking back to our area, some lady  with blonde hair in two braids walks up to my friend (who was just walking back to the other side of the pool) and she purposely bumps into her and says ""I'm a security guard here, MOVE!!!!!!""  WOW.....    Yes, I did say something and the lady just turned around and stared at me like I was supposed to be intimidated. That was crazy, seeing as how we were all totally sober, we weren't causing any problems and were just walking. I could see if we were acting crazy and the lady just broke up a fight, but no, everything was totally chill and she must have been in a really bad mood. Like I said, you're not a security guard for the president so calm down.

Anyways here are my personal scores,

music  B

Price of the drinks C (everywhere is expensive, so be prepared and don't get mad)

ambiance C- (not as nice as other places I've been but not ugly)

Service D

Customers B (everyone was pretty cool and not stuck-up)

My friends and I got a day bed for $350 which means you can hang out in the bed and agree to spend at least $350 on food/drinks at Liquid. Bottles start at $550 and individual margaritas start at $14ish. While I had a great time, I could see why others without beds/cabanas wouldn't have enjoyed themselves as much because you could literally only sit around the rim of the pool. 

Drinks: we ordered margaritas and other cocktails. They tasted good and got to us within 20-30 minutes of ordering. The price was to be expected in vegas.

Service: super pretty bikini clad girls that were friendly but forgot our order multiple times. Drinks and food arrived in a reasonable time frame.


Cons:
Music: I can't understand why they played the clean version of every song. It's a 21+ venue, is it not? You're ruining my rap music! 
There was a live dj there... maybe he prefered the clean versions. 
DJ would not play Pretty Ricky.

The pool: it was small but it wasn't overcrowded. You could see the film of sunscreens and bronzer though...

The umbrellas: Once we were burnt to a cinnamon crisp, we wanted our umbrella moved or another one opened to protect our fresh sunburns. The server said there was nothing that they could do. Its too bad that the other umbrellas shading empty beds/benches couldn't be used.

Hours: The website says it's open 11am-6pm. We got there after 1pm and by 4pm staff told us that they were closing. They finally asked everybody to leave at 430pm. Wtf?!

Great for meeting people and good music. Service was slow at times but they made sure my allergies were accommodated. 

Every towel dropped was replaced, drinks were poured for us, and didn't have to lift a finger. Just what you need for a day poolside. The pool was a good dance floor when it got warm.

Came here with a group of girls on a weekday.  We were told it was a big pool party so we got there at 11 am when it opened and waited in line.   We had to wait about 30 minutes while they let in a couple people at a time.  We were expecting it to be super crowded since they were only letting a few in at at a time.  It was super hot (which is fine since it was Las Vegas in June) but the guy at the door kept giving us the run around about why we couldn't just go in.   

We finally got in and there was absolutely NO ONE in there.   Every bed was completely empty except for two and only a few people were in the lounge chairs and a couple at the bar.    Now we had never been in one of these places so we didn't know we had to pay for a bed.   It was $1000 dollars for the bed which was crazy because there wasn't anyone there.    We did put our stuff down on the bed and were ignored for about 20 minutes until the ""pool director"" came over and informed us of the price.   My friend negotiated with her and since it was so slow we could have the bed but we would have to buy drinks.  My friend put an order in for 3 $25 dollar drinks and a bucket of 6 waters ($50).   We sat for about 40 more minutes and the drinks never arrived however the ladies that came in after us got their stuff immediately.  

We were super pissed so we just left but not without letting the waitress know how angry we were.  She played dumb and pretended like she was ""so sorry"" she forgot.   I don't think they wanted us in there to begin with.  

We went out of Liquid and over to the regular Aria pool where we had a much better time.  It was very relaxed and the pool was nice.",VN_n0Ddxny0J6Z0ehMsvUw,5,0,1,6XM0vxAzOjpTiuaOJ4zX9Q

This place is ON for people watching and meeting interesting people.  The things we saw and the people we met were movie-worthy.  I swear I wrote this review already but it must not have saved properly. 

Anyway, thank you to the doorman who let us in without a fee.  Yes, after a certain hour aka 3 pm it's $20 for GIRLS to get in.  Okay the place closes at 5 pm.  So for the last two hours they were going to squeeze another $40 out of us rather than enticing us to come in and spend $100+ on booze and water.  The $20 per girl almost lost them the $100+ that I ended up dropping at the bar BEFORE tipping well.  Bad business model if you ask me.  I digress.  We were able to sit at a table with a nice couple who's boys (21 and 25) were in the pool.  Well, I guess the boys had a disagreement of some sort while in the pool and one ended up with a paramedic and a cut.  Que controlled chaos.  Perfect for people watching, so sad for that family, sorry.  Next up is a really nice group of Canadian guys who were very entertaining and genuinely nice.  Had everyone at Liquid been as kind and considerate, it would have not been as fun to sit and watch and chat.  But they were a breath of fresh air. Because all around us were groups of extremely intoxicated girls and guys (many on the older side - not judging just making an observation) eyeing one another up and down and probably peeing in the pool.  It was hysterical!  Reality TV could make a series about day clubs in Vegas and I would watch, without abandon, I would marathon crush those shows.

With that in mind, the Liquid beach club at the Aria hotel and casino was a huge disappointment. Like other yelpers have been saying it is a very small pool with very basic lounge and cabana areas. Last year I attended TOA Beach and it had infinitely better pools and lounge areas. My boyfriend and I got in for free because we were guests at the hotel (thank goodness we did not have to pay a cover for that snooze fest). Once arriving the pool had maybe 10 people in it awkwardly sitting on the edge of the pool. 

We found out that all of the lounge chairs cost $215 FREAKIN DOLLARS just to have a place to sit. Are you kidding me? The three pools outside of Liquid are bigger and I can plop my butt down in any of those chairs for free. The whole mentality of treating these beach clubs like night clubs is ludicrous.

I was later talking to a guest who said that lots of people were interested in coming in and joining the ""party"" but once they found out how expensive the chairs were they left. It seems like a loose-loose for the Aria, no pool guests to create the party atmosphere and loss of money on cover charge and drinks. 

If I were to recommend a beach party it would be TOA on a weekend, being on the guest list, with a party full of women. Then you may have a good time at these ""exclusive"" clubs.",t6wSA4lT-KjdmdF_mddplA,9,1,2,sPl0Ci3tFMCOHg2bsU2d-g

After 4pm, one of the staff came over and said we could take another adjacent lounge for free. The majority of the customers were 20-30 year olds and we're quite friendly and very amusing to watch. My wife and I likened the final bill to being the same as a show bill......except the customers were the show! We had two pitchers of margaritas and two bottled waters. The grand total was somewhere around $170.00 with the tip. The venue was cigar friendly, so I was quite content in sitting back, smoking my stogies, sipping on a margarita and watching the madness unfold. Actually, a couple of people came by and remarked how good my cigars smelled and wanted to know where I had gotten them. The staff seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd. One of the waitresses was thrown in the pool by a few of her coworkers. The music was bass pounding hip-hop....not exactly our thing but it was a great soundtrack for the spectacle. Overall we had a good time. The staff was very attentive....coming by to refill your glass, empty your ash tray and make sure you didn't need anything else. The club closes at 6pm and when we left we could very clearly see the lack of any vibe at the basic pools. They were nice...but very laid back. So, it's all in what you are looking for. The people watching value in Liquid was pretty priceless!",9GFfIWakhOO1XFRLNmiFVQ,0,0,4,EzO7hDB5Ufx1EG2Glv3RrQ

My friend's friend works for Liquid and told us about the free champagne until 3p. Beam me up Scotty! We had just 2 1/2 glasses each. The bartender was uber chill and had PERFECT teeth. There weren't very many people there since it was still early, but the crowd was very pretty to look at. Seriously, eye candy for all the boys and girls.

Liquid is pretty chill actually. They had OK music playing, didn't see a DJ but the music was pretty loud thanks to the speakers strategically placed everywhere. If you don't plan on sitting anywhere then you are all set. Majority of the seating areas are reserved, so we just sat at the bar.

Overall, it's a nice and chill. I'd go back.",JmarPUDYALd9cmjItEA6og,0,0,4,oeDoEHfYjKoNsfrL7V4n8Q

It's a small pool, but it was very clean and service was very good.  I actually enjoyed the food and drinks here better than Encore Beach Club.  The Mahi Mahi tacos, beer battered onion rings, and coconut shrimp were amazing.  They have great prices on bottles of champagne-$385 for 2 bottles of Moet Ice where Encore was $495 for one.  It's a good pool for when you need a chill day.",o5B6Q0A16I-zkHzcsJ9n1w,0,0,4,gJpLfo_azIW7Fach1Py51w

For him to finish his text message!!!! There are 5 of them standing there doing nothing and we have six people who were willing to spends a few k to get drunk....in the rain. Seriously?!

The drinks were fine, the crowd was okay and the music was decent.  Our time there was fun but it's not worth any cover or any food/drink minimum. I say come visit if you happen to stay at the City Center. Worth the walk to peek in and look, but no need to take a taxi over here...not worth the $12.",7961wYcrm-zWEkE7kz0tPg,2,2,3,OaY79nzIvXqz3WzxK1HgSg

First off the security at the Aria didn't even know the day club was open. The staff at Liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guests excluding my party at the club. They have plenty of lounge areas amd cabanas for a busy day, but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area around a unexpectedly small pool didn't exactly seem worth wild. Maybe on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool day club, but it just wasn't for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes.",_G2MXTbpraAKm9zv2r_UXA,4,2,2,Cuc_as6T02pw8HScEwLA0A

 I highly recommend getting on a list because you can't pull this stuff everyday & the girls behind us got turned away.  

Not only did we get in despite arriving pretty late in the afternoon, but we got in for free & got to see an amazing DJ do his thing!

Drinks here are expensive  BUT luckily we made friends with the boys w/ bottle service so the good times kept on rolling.

This pool is not too big, so unless you get here super early or reserve cabanas, you probably will not have a place to sit. However, there is plenty of fun party people in the pool tossing beach balls and enjoying each other's company. 

You can check your things in upon arrival (complimentary) so you don't have to worry about leaving your purse or wallet unattended & can go have a blast.

I would recommend this party for the younger crowd 20-30's. It is loud & fun & not for people looking to lay back and relax! 

Good place to go if you want to be social and dance!",4ZaqBJqt7laPPs8xfWvr6A,1,1,4,X-_cJ0xU9F3eRrlOR3GdYg

Lookin' for a pool party?! Liquid @ Aria... is a must do if you're in the area.

I came here this past weekend, both Saturday and Sunday (I stayed at Vdara, so it was easy for me to just walk over without catching a taxi).

Saturday was great came around 1pm stayed till 6... weather was nice, packed with people and good music. That day, they charged $40 for guys and free for girls... with a $200 minimum per chair... which we wanted 2 chairs... but they could only offer us 1. On a good note, music was great! I danced for 5 hours straight and entertained all of liquid. Left with a lot of fans, lol. On an off note but not surprising, a couple was caught having sex in the pool and got kicked out.

Sunday came around 1230pm left at 330pm... weather wasn't great... windy... clouds over sun... there was a little sunshine here and there... but due to the weather, it wasn't as crowded as Saturday. People actually remembered me from the day before... guess I stood out with all that dancin I was doin. That day, they didn't charge cover for guys... but they wanted a $50 minimum per chair and there was 4 of us, so we spent another $200. It was so windy that day that one the lounge beds flew up in the air and almost landed on me! =( 

Yummm! I don't drink alcohol, so I was all about the food! Good stuff!
I had alot of food on their menu:
- ahi
- shrimp cocktail
- club sandwich
- coconut shrimp
- virgin pina colada
- virgin mango daiquiri 

- they even got us coffee, which wasn't on the menu.

$25 for liquid shirts. I love mines!

Bathroom is clean.

Except to wait 20-30 mins. for your bill.

Come here if you don't have a problem dropping $200 (food/drinks) for fun in the sun. Not super packed, so there's room to breath and dance!

-1 star for $200 for 1 chair... and not being able to accommodate us with 2 chairs. Paying that much $, they should make it happen!

I hope to return one day! Worth checkin out. Mixed crowd.
Don't forget your ID!
Enjoy my photos =0)

Lots of X&O to LIQUID! I miss U!",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,8,3,4,SmfGFwANNRtdttcsqOvDOQ
