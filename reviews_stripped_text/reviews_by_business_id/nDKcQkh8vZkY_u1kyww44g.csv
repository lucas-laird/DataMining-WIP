We Enjoyed perfectly grilled prawns with blood orange sauce and yummy little butternut squash medallions; A ridiculously delicious and indulgent beef and leek broth with spinach raviolis with beef filling; Next we enjoyed the perfect flavor mingling of Duck confit stacked on a caramelized fig - so delicious! For the main course we had a Turkey breast stuffed with quail sausage, garlic coated haricot vert and amazing truffle au gratin with a perfect crispness. In the end we had an assortment of vanilla gelato, amaretto cookies and fresh berries. Each course's wine pairing felt like a natural compliment.

Service was a bit spotty, our waiter brought our water and immediately  asked about our wine selection, before we had gotten a chance to view the list. Then, after bringing us our appetizer and salad course, was nowhere to be found when we wanted to order entrees. 

The food, however, was very good. This place boasts one the best alfredo sauces I've had on the strip, and while it's not a particularly fancy option, it's something that many places don't do that well.

I went with my boyfriend, we each had the tasting menu and wine pairing. Some items were nice but two were pasta-based, one with gnocchi and the other ravioli, and in both cases the pasta was very overcooked. The wine itself was a bit underwhelming, not the least because some of it was watered down (!). It tasted very weak and watery and we could see through it, especially along the top level. We complained about both, and both times were told that we didn't know what  we were talking about, that pasta is meant to be mushy and pinot noir transparent. In the case of the wine they came and gave us another set of unwatered wine ""just because,"" but never admitted what was clearly the case or gave us a discount for the two flights of watery wines they served. The bill for two people was 300 USD and while some of it was tasty, it was worth perhaps of third of that.

We came here after wandering through the Venetian for a while and were seated without any hassle, I suppose a combination of 10pm and bad economy. We were given a choice between Valentino Grill, which is closer to the game area or Valentino, situated in the back and more ""romantic"". We chose the back. Even though we were one room away, it felt a world apart. It's dimly lit and much quieter.

We both got the ""A Taste of Our Menu"". And it was out of this world. It's essentially 15 bite-sized courses served 3 at a time on the same plate, with very good wine pairing for each plate. The courses and wine were brought out at a very comfortable pace with a brief description of each. Often I hesitate on upscale Italian because I didn't want to shell out for pricey pasta or ravioli but I gladly did as parts of a meal that also included rib eye, eggplant, calamari, veal, pork, salmon, etc...

Everything was delicious except for the main course, which nobody on our table finished. I usually clean my entire plate when I eat at fancy restaurants serving tasting menus,  but this was the first time I wasn't able to (and not because I was full....)

Having read the raving reviews about this place, my expectations were up there which unfortunately were not met by my dining experience provided by this place.

Ambiance is almost as important as the taste of the food in my opinion, especially if you are going for the ""experience.""  This area is split into as written by other reviewers:  one is the grille area (casual), and at the back is the ""fine dining"" Valentino's.  I'm only reviewing the fine dining area.  Although it offers no window, I didn't feel contained.  The lighting is good and the ambiance though has a cozy feel to it, is nothing special.

The sampling menu I ordered gave me enough food to last till the next day--3 small portions of each: appetizers, pasta/starch sampler, meat sampler, and dessert sampler. I just had it last night but the only thing that stood out from the appetizer selection was the eggplant parmigiana.  The pumpkin filled ravioli was delicious.  The whole wheat pasta was perfectly cooked except for the sauce which was too salty for my liking.  The tri-color gnocchi was so-so but that's because I was never a fan of gnocchi (the sauce however was good).  The meat sampler was good, especially the beef and the veal.  The sauce of the prawn however was overpowered by its spicyness that I could barely tell how it really taste like.  Sadly, though I was generally satisfied with the meal itself, the killer came at the end: dessert -- which was just unfortunate since dessert for me is somewhat considered as the sacred portion of my meal.  The sorbet was just a sorbet - to plainly function as a palette cleanser.  The caramel creme was just too sweet.  And there was another petite dessert that I could not even recall since it was just plain, and again too sweet.

Perhaps, I would have rated a better experience should I have chosen the grille menu instead at the other restaurant within Valentino's....but then again, it comes from the same kitchen.  I don't know what it is but I think having read a lot of praises from magazines for this restaurant, my taste buds had just higher expectations from this place.",dsb3UQXi5P04__yXvNfQ1w,0,0,3,lwv_1UmQb9BOfDDny3M7Kg

When the waiter mentioned this I avoided eye contact with anyone as I was prepared to go caveman on everyone in the restaurant if I didn't get my ""tomahawk"". I finished it all including the truffle ravioli and asparagus sides and have since been given the office nickname of ""Tomahawk"". I wear the nickname with pride. I went with liquid desert in the form of grappa and limoncello. A perfect end to a perfect meal.

I must also mention we were seated at the chefs table in a private room so this added even more to our dining experience. If Valentino was alive and I was gay, I would marry him. Valentino...as good as it gets. Cheers",HRKQwU6SOSpYf5I51KuMow,2,1,5,9r3SQxx-mi0sO1Uvhbu-VQ

The manager didn't; skip a beat. He went back to the chef to find out if it was possible. No problem. 

The salad was amazing.  The smoked chicken was done perfectly - tender, flavorful, lean  The bartender was extremely friend;y. In fact, service from everyone was wonderful.  And I had the opportunity to sit next to a writer for food and wine which made lunch even more interesting.

I dined here in the early evening of cinco de mayo weekend with a friend.  We were seated right away and service began in the blink of eye.

The wine-by-the-glass list was looong.  Sadly it started at $13, and quickly ramped up to $25+ (the top glass was $63 - and I'm no fainting violet when it comes to paying for good wine, but this made be blanch a bit).

I ordered the Pinot Noir, which was delightful with it's dark berry flavors, light easy start and finish - so basically tasted like a well aged Napa valley Cabernet Savignon.

We ordered the equivalent to fried Mozzarella as one of the appetizers, but you have never had fried cheese like this.  The breading was light and crispy and the marinara was smooth, and garlic-y with even more cheese blended inside.

The salad, on the other hand, was a disappointment.  it was supposed to be mixed greens, mushrooms with a honey mustard dressing, but it came out dry dry dry, and the mushrooms looked like they had literally come frorm a can.  No porchini or other unusual mushroom types.

The big surprise though, came with dinner.  On a lark  (it was not on the menu in any way, shape or form), I asked for angel hair with seasonal vegetables in 'pink' sauce...and they made it for me!  And it was wonderful in both the pasta, and veggie components (I counted at least 5 different vegetable types) not to mention the  sauce.

My friend got the lasagna, and I have to tell you, i was so busy with the angel hair, I didn't even remember to ask.  

No coffee, and no dessert...too full.  We did get a large bill: $120.  that feels like a lot for pasta, salads, etc...Otherwise the restaurant was impeccable.  Good service, Good food, speedily delivered.",2aVGrrE0K4gynbLLzg1heA,2,3,4,jO-UijZMtXSfQcj3j3ljbw

In other words, while i am giving this restaurant 2 star, had I had this  meal out of a truck in some third world country I might have given it 3 or 4 stars.  The point is, in Las Vegas, expectations are high and this restaurant fell very short of the expectation.  Normally I am much more concerned with the food, than ambiance, decor, parking, etc.  But in this case I have to comment on the surprisingly inexperienced and awkward waiter we had.  He really made the dinner uncomfortable.  For instance, he would walk by on a regular basis, look over at our table and if he caught eye contact he would quickly turn his head and start walking the other way.  But enough about the waiter because at any restaurant you could get a waiter who is just having a bad night.  So here's the scoop on the food.  I had the salmon and my girlfriend had chicken.  I know these are not the most adventurous dishes one can order, but because they aren't, you almost expect that the restaurant would have perfected them.  The chicken was tiny, over-seasoned and somewhat dry.  The salmon was dry and lacking flavor.  Anyhow, I dont have time to break things down further, but I would suggest you stay away.  If youre in the Venetian, and want Italian, try B+B.  If you dont have to have Italian, try Sage at the Aria.

I thought we were seated on the Grill side but it seemed to me the more upscale of the two dining rooms, so maybe I was on Valentino side. My dining companion and I split a caprese salad and grilled pizza primavera, which I am certain were from the grill menu. Both were excellent and met our need for for a light dinner.

There were definitely numerous menu options that sounded delicious. But the specials menu had a mushroom ravioli with black truffles - and how can you pass THAT up? There was both an appetizer portion and an entree portion. Given that I tend to almost never be able to finish an entire plate of anything, I opted for the appetizer portion (as my entree, of course).

Our entrees arrived super fast. SUPER fast. Ridiculously fast. Did they somehow already know what we were going to order and have it ready for us? I couldn't even reheat ravioli in a microwave in the amount of time it took for our food to arrive. But hey, it was absolutely delicious - so I am certainly not complaining. And such quick service would be very handy if going to a show or something afterward. 4 stars for the entrees.

For dessert, we opted to share the mango creme brulee. It also came out quite fast. And it was quite tasty. The mango was a little bit overpowering and tart, but the kiwi sorbet and crunchy brulee provided a good balance. 3.5 stars.

The service was great. Very knowledgeable, thorough, and fast. The only slight issue came when I produced the restaurant.com gift certificate. The waiter tried to tell me that we couldn't use it unless we had two entrees (and, of course, I opted for the appetizer portion, instead of the entree portion). However, the gift certificate clearly stated ""$35 minimum purchase"" and NOT ""two entrees"" (which a lot of other restaurant.com gift certificates do say). So he then went to ask someone somewhere about it. You would think it would take longer to whip up some mushroom ravioli than it would to inquire about a gift certificate, but not so. We seriously spent more time waiting re: the gift certificate than the entire time it took for the actual meal. And yeah, that was annoying. But the waiter did finally come back and let us know that all was ok. Apparently, he was just thrown for a loop because the newer restaurant.com gift certificates for Valentino do require the purchase of two entrees. So I'll be nice and say 4 stars for service, despite the gift certificate glitch.

I wasn't a fan of ostrich, but my friend who helped me finished half of my ostrich loved the dish.  Personally, I thought it was not as healthy of a meal as I would like.  (4) I also had artisan cheese and fruit, which was good.  Again, being on a diet, I only had a few tiny morsels of the cheese.  (5) The dessert was amazing, which was a bavarian dish with carmel ice cream, white chocolate sticks, and some other very sweet goodness.  There was a 6th dish, but I don't remember what it was.  

I also ordered half a dozen Kumamoto oysters, which tasted very fresh and wonderful.  That and the dessert were probably my favorite dishes that night.  Oh before, I forget, I tasted my friend's USDA filet mignon.  That's a nice slab of meat that tasted better than my ostrich.

We were greeted warmly and taken to the ""back"" dining room which is quiet and romantic.  Score one.   We were given an extensive wine list (impressive) menus and left there for about 15 minutes.  No bread, no water, nothing.  There was only one other table of dinners at the time.   Finally, a server brings over a bread tray and explains which breads are which.   This was a nice touch.  The breads were good.  Though the pre-sliced raisin was very dry, seemed more than day old.  The olive bread was good.  

Finally, now, 20 minutes in our wait staff shows up.   She's a ""Barbie girl"" who says ""like"" and ""for sure"" and ""you guys""  --- in a supposedly 4 star restaurant??!!   I know I'm in trouble.  She says she'll give us a few minutes to look at the menu (we've had 20 already, return with the by the glass wine list) and oops she forgot the specials, so she'll be back.

Finally, Barbie girl is back.  By now, I'm ready to chew the leg off the table.  She takes a deep breath and reels off the specials (I don't know if she's written them on the back of her hand or what).   I'm sure some of them were good, probably really good.  But there were so many and she said them so fast I only heard two out of probably 10+.   If you are going to try to impress your patrons with multiple specials in each category, write them out and put them in the menus!   I'd like to be able to read about them the same as the rest of your ""fabulous"" food.   And I've found out from experience that the chef's specials are generally more expensive, so be up front - write them out and put copies in the menus.  

Nothing on the tasting menus sounded especially good or unique.  So we order from the regular menu.  The food is good, but unremarkable.  Certainly nothing special for the price.  My entree is fish on ""crispy"" polenta -- which amazingly is still crispy.  But the entire dish is quite salty.  Too bad.   My fellow diner's dish is also fish, again very good, but again very salty.... and he rarely complains about anything.

We were celebrating a WIN in Vegas....no, not cash, silly....a DIFFERENT kind of win - the end of a productive and promising Trade Expo that left us hungry for good red wine and unparalleled vegetarian fare in a refined yet comfortable atmosphere.....cue Valentino! Our server, Adrian, a Johnny Depp-esque creature with immaculate timing and menu advice, helped us put together a trio of pastas that delighted us to NO END....seriously, one bite was bliss, knowing I had a whole plateful was HEAVEN. The fresh ingredients were so obviously abundant in each flavor combination, yet all blended together so well in the various sauces and pasta fillings. The gnocchi, in particular, was so silky smooth and perfectly sized to mix with the fresh pesto sauce, that I would still be dragging the meal out now, a week later, if I thought I could be away from my family for that much longer!  This all followed a scrumptious appetizer-gone-spunky version of eggplant parmesean that was topped with fresh curly, peppery herbs. This ALL was accompanied by a merlot that was suggested by the sommelier after we had deposited our request for woodsy-earthy-cheesy-veggie items....he found a perfect match!
I would be leaving you without a kiss good-bye if I didn't take a minute to explain just how a fabulous dessert followed this amazing meal.

Our waiter was quite nice, but the sommelier and captain were snobby as all get out, and treated us like dirt after we indicated lack of interest in drinking wine with dinner.

My wife is a vegetarian, and they created the most bland dish for her (after messing it up once and bringing out a second dish, which was also not correct).

We were lead to our table and the first thing that got me as odd was that the hostess did not give us menus.  So, we sat awkwardly until a good 5 minutes passed and our server came over...still no menus, but gave us the wine list.  Personally, for me it was hard to choose a wine when I had no idea what I was going to eat - but whatever!

I have to add here...I Love a good wine list!!  But this wine list was overwhelming to say the least.  To make it worse, I was with my mom who has limited wine preferences and there was no by-the-glass offerings on the list.  We chose a bottle of white and moved on.

We finally got menus!  Another millennium went by and our server finally returned to tell us the specials.  It was time to order and I got excited again.

We both ordered the special Caesar Salad.  Disappointing at best and I have a feeling the dressing was from a bottle.  It was not special and lacked flavor.

I followed this up with the Gli Gnocchi (Ricotta and Rapini with Spicy Vodka Sauce Gratin).  It was okay.  It was definitely not spicy, so that was a little disappointing.  Mom ordered the L'agnello (Fork Tender Lamb Ossobuco Braised in Red Wine Served with Porcini Infused Gnocchi).  Once she got past the fact that her entree was Grey...yes grey (not even a nice grey!) she dove into the ossobuco, but the porcini gnocchi did not have much flavor.

On the one hand, Valentino's is a stunning restaurant -- from it's location within the equally stunning Venetian Hotel, to the beautiful decor, to the amazingly delicious food.  On the other hand, we've never once seen a menu here . . . each time Lynn and I have been lucky enough to dine here, we've been seated and the food merely ""arrives"" at our table, along with wines for each course.  

Is this the ""regular"" tasting menu?  I honestly don't know . . . if it is, or even if it isn't, the variety of dishes served to us over the coursse(s) of the evening -- each exquisitely done -- has me feeling confident when I say that everything on this menu is excellent.  I've never had a dish here that disappointed; indeed, everything has been not merely delicious -- and, come on, how can ""delicious""  be described as ""merely""? -- but each dish has surpassed our expectations . . . . 

Thank heavens I don't live in Vegas . . . there are now too many great restaurants there; I'd end up weighing 300 pounds . . . but Valentino's definitely continues to hold on to its spot as THE best Italian restaurant in this town, and one of my ""Top Three"" overall (along with Lotus of Siam and L'Atlelier de Joel Robuchon).

BOOO.. so my friend helped me out with yelping so we ended up picking Valentino at the Venetian.  It is right at the walkway going into the palazzo and in front of the cashier area of the venetian if you have a hard time finding it!

Don't be confused!  There's the fine dining area in the back and the GRILL area in the front of the restaurant so take your pick!  The menus are indeed quite different.. The Grill is BASIC pasta italian food... i mean if you are in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs? you might as well spend another 6 bucks for the fine dining pasta dish.. and that is what we did.

Decor: we were a bit confused.. what was it exactly supposed to be? it was just shades of dark blue/brown/shiny dark red walls.. and some long mirrors at the top of the ceiling.. oo hey! we can see ourselves up top! I don't know what the decorators were really thinking to be honest with you...There's no specific theme to the place or anything. Dark lighting in the front and in the back...romantic is not a word i would describe this place at all.

Space: the fine dining area is a back room.. it isn't that big at all.. maybe max 15 tables? a hallway leads to the front room where it is a bit more spacy.. I guess they like to hide us fine diners in the back?

Service: very good and accommodating. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. He helped us with some recommendations and made sure things were alright at all times with us.

Food: Average Italian food. I think i expected a bit more out of this place. The food wasn't bad but nothing too special!  I had the black pasta with carbonara sauce which consisted of bacon and sea urchin and shrimp.. It was a bit bland for my taste so i ended up adding some salt to the dish.  It came in a bowl sized dish which was interesting.  My friends and i were trying to taste and spot the sea urchin pieces but I think there was just too much bacon or they just didn't add any sea urchin in there for me to taste it!  I also tried other dishes there which were the ""fra diavolo"" prawns with angel hair pasta sauce ( it was a bit spicy and basic ), and the lamb chops with gnocchi pasta on the side.  The meat was very good and fell right off the bones..

Dessert: Best part of my meal. the chocolate souffle. The waiter said it would take about 30 minutes to make so we ordered it at the beginning of our dinner.  We still had to wait about 10-15 minutes for it to come out though after we were done with our entrees.  I love the vanilla bean custard when it is poured into the souffle center.  It was very good. not too chocolatey or too sweet.  On the other hand, The chocolate ice cream on the side was TOO chocolatey for me.. I hate dark chocolate!

When I stayed here in 2006 I had walked by this place about 500 times before I finally decided to make reservations and have my final meal of the trip here.

For starters I chomped on Scallop Saltimbocca (with prosciutto and sage) over potato ""rosti"": 

***Wow...those pieces of spicy Italian ham were wrapped perfectly around some of the best scallops that this Irish SOB has tasted. They had some caramelized apples on the side of the plate that at first to me seemed odd, but when I mixed it all together it seriously was such an amazing match made in culinary heaven.

I then moved on to the three color gnocchi with rabbit sausage and mushrooms in a creamy demi-glace sauce:

*** Now while it was not bad, the gnochhi just seemed like it was overcooked by a minute or two. Once you go even a minute too long, gnocchi becomes too mushy and I hate that consistency. I mean I cleaned the plate and licked it dry, but it was not one of my more memorable gnocchi meals.

For dinner I enjoyed the grilled 12 oz. ""Kurobuta"" pork loin marinated in green apple brine with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes:

Absolutely amazing! I am a big fan of pork and this chef made a perfect pork loin. It has been a few years and I still compare other pork loins, that I either order while dining out or make myself, to this one. Mmm.

Finally dessert (Oh yes there will be dessert). I devoured a warm chocolate torte with vanilla sauce and chocolate ice cream:

*** Go there and try this. I can not explain how good this dessert is in words.

Plus a lot of wine was drank and damn was the hangover on the plane ride well worth it.

Now this place drops 1 star due to the not so perfect gnocchi, expensive prices and at times slow service (even though we were one of three tables dining at the time). Highly recommend you check it out.",hGeXKYWkqJgFC1u_Sh6kCg,9,6,4,tkyaC_ihMzWucNqbCBldBA

Well, there was some fine, and there was some dining, but it fell a little short of a great Fine Dining experience.  I don't typically like to start with the service, but it, unfortunately, stood out.  Our server was slow, even after acknowledging we were trying to make the show (fret not, we literally sat down with 30 seconds to go).  After a discussion on gluten-free options, she agreed to check on the sea bass and if not, order a different dish for my wife.  She also left it as a surprise, despite coming back several times for other things.  When we ordered desert, my wife's Gelato, which was excellent, came with a cookie on top (almost definitely gluten-containing).  Did I mention she was slow?

The food.  We shared the homemade Sausage and Peppers appetizer, and it was terrific - perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I had Garganelli with Wild Boar.  It was good, if the smallest bit dry.  I would try something else if I were to return.

Turns out the Sea Bass could be made gluten-free - and it was spectacular.  Spectacular - better than a fish dish my wife had at Joel Robuchon the next night.

One other nit - my wife ordered ginger ale and they gave her Coke + Sierra Mist (or whatever) and she asked if it was caffeine free and they had to check.

After our disastrous visit previously, and due to the request to make it up to us, Jim G. and I returned, trying to be open-minded about what the night would hold.

We were seated in a beautiful private room, overlooking the dining room, but still nicely private.  The great music (Sinatra, Martin, etc) was easily heard, but not intrusive.  We had great treatment from our server, the sommelier, and the manager, all night long.

Some of the dishes we enjoyed were served gratis, but some we paid for (just for full disclosure).
-The parmesan cheese crisps are amazingly addictive.
-Gli Spaghetti with Roasted Rabbit and Wild Mushroom Ragu: This was very tasty and went nicely with the wine the sommelier helped us pick out.
-Braised Beef Cheek Ravioli with black truffles (nightly special): This pasta was very good and was chock full of truffles. I liked the other pasta better, but both were good.
-The chef sent out a beautiful scallop which was seared and served over polenta. I don't recall all the other details, but it was a nice scallop and beautifully cooked!
-Lamb Ossobuco: This was delicious! Nicely cooked, well seasoned, and hearty!
-NY Strip (special of the night): Cooked perfectly, a nice piece of meat.  For me, the flavor was a bit lacking.  It was good, but something was missing, and for $58, I feel like it should have blown me away.
-The chef also sent out a tiramisu, which I usually don't order. It's rare that any place makes them properly since it's such a cliched dessert.  This one was very nice. Glad we got to try it.

It was nice to return to good service and know that there is some good food on the menu.  There are some stars on the menu, but not everything we had was equally amazing.  I hope that everyone who dines here receives great service; our evening was obviously a little different than the average diner walking in, but I'd like to hope that the manager is working with his staff to ensure that everyone has a lovely meal here.

I went to Valentino with three other coworkers and two clients.  We shared 2 bottles of wine, several appetizers, we each ordered an entree, and we shared three desserts.  I'm sure the final bill would have exploded my brain, but the food was all delightful.

The Melanzana was my FAVORITE appetizer... really wonderful.  I didn't try the bruschetta with mozzarella, but others said it was good.  Unfortunately, I can't remember the third appetizer....

For dinner, I ordered the Branzino (sea bass), which was total perfection in my bowl.  It was the kind of meal where you have to grab bread to soak up anything remaining at the end. My second favorite entree was a coworker's gnocchi, was was truly delicious.  For dessert we shared plated donuts and a few other delightful items that were all passed around and shared.  (I tried to find what they were, but it wasn't listed on the online menu.)

Positives -- the wine menu is HUGE.  I mean...HUGE.  Pages upon pages of Italian wines, French wines, American wines... we ordered two bottles of a delicious chianti.  I'm sure that the sommelier would help you if it is overwhelming.  (Also, price go from like $55 to over $500 for a bottle, so you could just pick by cost!)   
The bathrooms were large and clean.
The waiter was friendly (although at first WAY WAY WAY too peppy and I think his manager might have told him to tone it down a little).

The room had cook books and guide books of Italy on the shelves with a bit of Frankie to be heard throughout the night.

The service was outstanding from beginning to end. We had some nice conversation about wine with the sommelier and found out he is actually from our neighborhood in LA.

A couple of their dishes really stood out to me. A must get is the Gill Spaghetti with Rabbit and Mushroom Ragu. The combination was perfect and the use of quality olive oil shined through. The Scallops with Polenta was one of the best prepared scallops I've ever had, and I've had way too many scallops! Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside which really displayed the essence of what a scallop is all about. Lastly the tender Lamb Ossobuco was the best I've had and again this is a dish I hunt down regularly at Italian restaurants. We fought after each piece as it fell off of the bone.

I wanted a creamy pasta with beef but the closest thing they had was an Alfredo. The server was very open to ask the chef if he could do it though. The pastas were under the starters menu but for 8 more bucks it was possible to get it as an entrée and for an additional 6 bucks it was possible to add chicken (or shrimps?). Since Alfredo is pretty plain in my opinion I ended up having it as a starter and ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes as the entrée.

The Alfredo was pretty boring. It even looked tired when it arrived on the table. It was OK and I ate it all after I covered it in parmesan cheese to get some flavor. It wasn't bad, but I've made better myself and that's not the feeling I want to have when I go to a restaurant.

The filet mignon was better. I ordered it medium rare and that's what I got. Same here, it was good but nothing revolutionary. I think they could have offered a bit more mashed potatoes and I would have preferred a bit less garlic in it. The starter was needed to get full. The sauce was good!

My friends had some seafood as starter and it was ok, and for entrée they had the lasagna and the seafood pasta (same thing as with the Alfredo, it looked tired). The lasagna was overwhelming in cheese and a bit too flat. The seafood pasta was, drumroll, the same as everything else - good but nothing special. And so was the red wine of the house.

We didn't have dessert.

The room was nice and the service great!
I checked in with Yelp and got 20% off for doing it which made the price acceptable.

The lamb shanks were mediocre and all dishes were too salty.

The third course was the seafood course and consisted of swordfish stuffed with crab, sole and I believe a salmon... however, this course was not memorable... and just ok.

The fourth course... the meat course was my least favorite of the meal and doesn't need to be mentioned.

The last course... dessert was decent. Berry Sorbet with a panna cotta shooter... was a nice way to finish dinner.

This time the experience was a little different, but the food was better than we remembered. Let me explain. My bf and I called ahead of time to make a reservation for 9 pm on a Sat night. We were planning to sit in the front of the restaurant (the grill) part of Valentino. When we got to the restaurant, the hostess immediately took us into the separate super fancy/stuffy back room. It was way over our heads, with a THICK wine list and all kinds of very $$ entrees- we had no idea what they were. I asked about the lasagna and he said we COULD make that with a meat sauce. I figured why have them TRY to make it when its on the menu in the OTHER ROOM!!!  We simply wanted the  amazing lasagna bolognese we had last year. There were 2 waiters constantly at our table who were very pushy and aggressive over ordering wine (which we did not want) and to order from the tasting pre fixed $85 pp menu (which we did not want). We both felt very uncomfortable back there, so I went out to the hostess and asked if we could get moved to the grill part in front. She said no problem and was very accomodating. As Im waiting in the front of the restaurant for my bf to come out from the back and get reseated, one of the aggressive waiters from the back room comes out to me to ask why Im moving! He insists he can do my dish off the regular menu and serve it to me in the back room. He was very annoyed with us and pushy. I told him no, we d be more comfortable in this room. It was so odd to us that he came over to us. Its like car salesmen competing for commission...Lol. 
Anyway, our new laid back young waiters were amazing and couldnt have been better. When we asked if they could take a pic of us, they moved us over to the entranceway so we could have the pic taken with the gorgeous red glittery wall and Valentino sign behind us. Great food. Amazing lasagna once again, and this year no room for dessert. AVOID THE BACK ROOOM!!!",rhBT5AQi8LPTc3Mk2Qpxpw,1,0,5,jELXUtHzMFlM8jMVQEl5Ag

Vegas Valentino is a mediocre imitation of the flagship restaurant in Santa Monica.

Well-known as having one of the largest wine selections in all of LA, the Vegas version's wine list while still large, really paled in comparison.  Also the first one we chose they spent 15 minutes looking for, then told us they couldn't find it.  When we went to our second choice and they actually were able to locate it - it was a great wine.

We started out strong.  For appetizers for the table we had - caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes, pumpkin ravioli and pasta with a wild boar ragout.  These were all flavorful, well-prepared and looked good on the plate.

I had the lamb osso bucco braised in red wine and ""fork tender"".  It was fork tender, but just had no flavor.  There was nothing to the sauce and was flat out under seasoned.

Desserts were just OK.  The mango creme brulee was waaaay too sweet, but the kiwi sorbet it came with was nice.  The chocolate souffle that took 20 minutes just wasn't worth it.  The center was not all creamy and melty.  We poured in this vanilla cream sauce and it just dripped off the side.  Plus they brought out all of our coffees right away, but didn't bring any of the desserts until the souffle was ready, so we had finished all of our coffees or they were cold, by the time the actual desserts arrived.

Maybe if I had never been to Valentino's in LA, I wouldn't be as disappointed in the Sin City version.  At least the company was good and we had plenty of wine flowing, so it turned out fine.",1MvdBIcPSzREkAgSYFXpzA,0,0,3,-6YS4k0TFGPsZbcDZgQohA

Food:  4 stars
The variety was nice with lots of traditional fare done in upscale fashion.  I had pork, my wife had beef, and all was nice.  What set the meal apart from the norm and lifts this to 4 stars was the absolutely lovely white truffle risotto.  Perfection.

Wine:  4 stars
If you are looking for Gaja or Sassicaia generational flights, it's here.  I would have preferred a bit more diversity in the Langhe region wines, especially a much more extensive Barbaresco selection.  That said, our waiter (doubling as wine steward since they were light staffed on a Wednesday) made a great recommendation on a '98 Barolo on the retired list.

The place is located in the Venetian hotel and it has a nice, quiet ambience.  Our servers were all very pleasant and the place was nice and clean.  

We started with the soft shell crab appetizer for 4 to share.  It was quite good, came with fried asparagus too.  We enjoyed this very  much.  Two of the people I was with ordered the lobster bisque and for the price paid ($16 I think) it was devastating.  It was a very small piece of lobster not like advertised on the menu and the soup was very watery.  I wouldn't recommend this soup.  For entrée, I had the wagyu beef which same with a small salad and zucchini, it was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious.  My boyfriend had the veal dish with polenta.  He was less than impressed.  Our one friend ordered the swordfish rolls which she was actually very disappointed in.  The meal was overwhelmed by peppers and the menu description made it sound so much better.  Our other friend had the special of the night which was filet, he seemed happy.  

So I guess the 2 people who ordered steak were very happy with their meals.  We had a bottle of wine to share and then each our own individual glass.  Besides the food being mediocre, the wait was forever.  I think we waited an hour for our entrée... kind of a waste of time in Vegas when we were wanting to go out and have some fun.  Good thing to note, a  yelp check in will get you 20% off the food portion of the bill.  Which is a good savings.

Yes, it included foie gras, and a yummy layered crab cake dish, but the rest of the dishes were just ""ok"".  I'd say that 3 out of the 7 dishes were good.  But for a $105 dollar tasting menu, that's not quite good enough for me.  I've had less expensive tasting menus at other restaurants where I can say that every single dish was absolutely amazing.  Unfortunately, I can't say that about Valentinos.  And at the end, one of the dishes was a cheese platter.  Everyone at the table smelled the cheese, and not in a good way.

They were understaffed for a 'holiday' night.  Our server was running around like a headless chicken and I felt bad.  The table that was finishing up when we were sat were rude and impatient, and the server seemed so flustered.

Maybe it's because we had just dined at Joel Robuchon the night before..Maybe it's because we only had 10 min to eat after our entree arrived before we had to dash over to catch our 9:30 show.  But it didn't meet my expectations.  Nothing was amazing, nothing stood out.  I had the gnocci which was good but not to-die-for.

So even though we love Mario batalli we decided to give this place a shot.  Monday night and pretty quite but the servers hustled with great professionalism.  My wife and I sat in the front part of the restaurant near the bar, the place is much deeper than this but the back half was not being used, probably because it was a slow night.

The menu is laid out like most nicer Italian menus, apps, salads, primeri, secundi, etc.  The waiter made a point of telling us every dish  was made to order so if we wanted to make any  special requests we should feel free. Since I had steak the two previous evenings (I know....first world problems!) I opted for the bronzini and my wife got the risotto with crab meat.  The fish was cooked perfectly, cut into about 4 sections and served in a large bowl instead of a flat plate, the sauce was thick and delicious makinf this dish almost a stew.  Overall,  one of the best fish dishes I've had.  My wifes risotto, while at first seeming to be a little on the small size for the price, was very well prepared, rich and dense so wound up being just right.

Between dinner and desert our waiter got a bit overwhelmed when a big party came in but one of the other servers spotted this and came to fill in which definitely speaks of a level of concern for the customer which is nice to see.  Side note: the large party seemed to be having a fixed menu dinner which looked really nice.

Both sides had plenty of room but the grill side menu grabbed our attention.

The wait staff was super friendly and our server was quick to take our drink order, tell us the specials and hand off bread with oil and spices. The bread was fantastic - soft and almost a little sweet on the inside with a golden brown exterior that gave just the right amount of crunch. 

I opted for the grilled Scottish salmon with onion pepper dip and grilled veggies. Both were out of this world - the salmon was perfectly cooked and tasted so great I skipped most of the sauce. Grilled veggies were HUGE and plentiful - very flavorful and you could see the grill marks. 

My colleague selected the special - a seafood pasta with a spicy red sauce. I believe it had salmon, scallops and shrimp - it looked great and he really liked it.

Each course was perfect, an amazing balance of flew ours and textures, this was as much of an art show as it was dinner.

There was delicately pan seared foie gras (eat your heart out Le Bernardin!), served ith perfect quail (or was it ostrich, damned wine).

There was a perfect piece of bison that was aged to provide phenomenal flavour without being games at all.

Chef appeared with a softball size black truffle and madly shaved generous amounts over each of our plates.

Mmmm, drooling again, by dessert I was getting a little fuzzier, and I am more into savoury , but I recall these amazing chocolate ravioli.

We first met chef while staying in Palazzo where Valentino looks after the appetizers in the Prestige lounge.  Nothing like the smell of garlic sautéing and amazing pasta.

Comparing this place to other top notch restaurants in Vegas, this is hands down my favorite and great value?

We ended up going to Valentino and I am soooo happy we did. It is an excellent restaurant with a very sexy atmosphere. attentive staff and delicious food prepared perfectly. 

Bread - Their onion and sweet raisin bread was sfot and flavorful. The olive bread was ok but I'm not a fan of olive in general so that's why I was so so about it. 

Appetizers - Calamari - This is the REAL calamari! Not the super breaded fatty calamari they serve everywhere else. This was sauteed and grilled squid on a bed of greens. The squid was cokoed just right and not chewy or hard. 

Main course - My bf order the veal and I ordered the beef short ribs. The veal was super soft and covered lightly in pesto sauce. Great pairing that brought out the flavors. My beef short ribs were extremely soft and buttery. I didn't have to chew hard or stab it with my knife. The meat just melted. The asparagus and mashed carrots blended nicely with my meat.

 I usually like to eat my meat with a glass of Pinot Noir but wine always relaxes me and makes me want to sleep. The night just started and I was going to party hardy.. so I opted for a martini instead. I paired my meal with the Valentino Martini. Loved it! It's a must try!

We topped off our dinner with the Nutella Napolean and ice cream. GAHHH!!! I fell in love instantly! I would go back to Vegas just to eat dessert here.",2Gy7OX3zFVfNeeHLhmpzJw,3,3,5,AdwhRbXbynOdKK9hm5j9Yg

My friends and I were there on a slow night, and we sat in the back room. It was quiet, and the décor was nice. I had cheese ravioli with pears, walnut, and sage. The ravioli was delicious, and the portion was perfect. The dessert was okay, chocolate ravioli and a berry and mint soup. 

The problem was how we were treated. Our two course dinner took well over two hours because our waitress checked on us once every 20-30 minutes or so. She did not read the specials, explain the menu, or give us the slightest amount of attention- though we saw her chatting up larger parties and giving them attentive service. Perhaps it was because we did not order wine, but there is no excuse.",-k6G79xi38aJYFHZb-2pjA,3,0,1,2xg1M5cbjgCCgCLryqS0gg

5872882,2008-07-06,4,nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g,"My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas for a ""romantic getaway"" this week. We asked for a guide to restaurants in Las Vegas because I was craving Italian. We found Valentino's and it was recommended that we make a reservation for the ""Fine Dining"" section of the restaurant. 

We get to the restaurant, and they walk us past the bar, past a group of tables, and into a back room. It seemed like we left one restaurant and walked into a completely different one. Our host pulled my chair out before I sat down and laid my napkin in my lap for me. (1 star) Shortly after, we were greeted by our waiter who offered us a choice of several different waters, indluding tap hahaha. He also brought us the wine menu, and we chose a glass of Merlot, which he was so efficient in bringing us, along with the dinner menu. 

The menu in this restaurant is absolutely amazing. Very expensive of course, but the food was incredible, and worth the price. I ordered a crab, scallop, and lemon olive oil Risotto and my boyfriend ordered a well done steak. His steak was so tender, he cut it with a butter knife, and my risotto was perfectly seasoned. 

I give the other stars because our waiter, Thomas, who knew each dish on the menu like the back of his hand, made any effort to see to it that we had the best time :)

If you havent eaten here yet and care about the quality of food and service, I highly recommend eating at this restaurant. If you have eaten here, but not in the ""fine dining"" section, and care about the quality of food and service,  I also recommend it. If not, I'm sure a nice double cheeseburger from McDonalds will do.",2Ss2klUXWPlVvSLtSoprnQ,5,4,5,OfAuGRtKoUmwEujBoD1mfw

For a Fri. night without reservations, we only had to wait about 15 mins.  That was the highlight.  Service was attentive enough, but it didn't make up for the food.  The mushroom pizza as an appetizer was very average.  The seafood linguine, however, as my main course was sub-par.  Bland, with chewy bits of seafood.  The pasta even tasted cold.  This place is way over-priced and over-hyped.",pttXvAL5QEzvIK4tI97JYw,0,0,2,aRN3iwe__CtroyapjTxLtw

This atmosphere is very fancy and comfortable. 

We sat by the bar since the wait for a table was about 45 minutes around 9PM when we arrived. 

I ordered a chardonnay and it tasted like any type of chardonnay I've had before. But good since I always order that 

My girlfriend ordered a shaken watermelon margarita and it was one of the best margaritas I have ever had, and I'm not too much of a watermelon fan, and I would even order this. Perfect and it does not taste too strong. 

We ordered calamari to go with out drinks and the marinara sauce, was not as thick, and it was tasteful. I personally liked it. The calamari was not too breaded and fried, which was a GOOD THING. They season it as well and give you a lemon so you can squeeze on top. Tasted pretty fresh. 

This place was a bit pricey. We paid about 48 bucks for those 3 items, which is understandable in vegas. 

I would definitely come back here.

But the waiter was really slow. My bf ordered a spicy spaghetti with meatballs pasta and i ordered the potato gnocchi. the entrees came really fast. we were just tasting the breads when they already came out. The portions are indeed big. I only finished half of mines and my bf finished about 3/4 of his. The gnocchi was something new that i have never tried in my life. It tasted alright. A bit mushy, but it tasted good when it was hot. My bf said his pasta was not spicy at all and it tasted like a normal spaghetti. I tasted some of his and agreed with him. our bill was $32  plus $3 tip.",Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,1,0,3,vKbReXdQ2DTvQTyjkUZPXg

the flavors were very bland and did not contrast well as i would expect fine foods to. there was nothing surprising about the flavors out of every dish i tried.  actually, there were even parts of my pasta that were not fully cooked. im a huge fan of the al dente, but hard pasta is not good in my opinion. maybe i went on an off night.  food aside, having the staff trying to push every little charge on you isnt my idea of a nice experience.

in addition, my friend asked for sorbet for dessert. they gave her 2 or 3 scoops of fruit sorbet for $16.....i don't know about that.",Xp_MNoIB9QUXu-fheDxXfw,1,0,1,gLvjirJwqWh8CSMjfsJeFQ
