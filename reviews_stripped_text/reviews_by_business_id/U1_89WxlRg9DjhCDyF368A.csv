They said it was food poisoning and I was extremely dehydrated from not being able to keep any liquids down. They had to give me medicine to get me to stop throwing up. My friends had the same symptoms but not as bad. The food was not good too. I have a tough stomach but not when it comes to whatever rotten ingredients President's Pizza uses.,oOvtQLdYtcfvwONIJlGw1w,0,0,1,xaYzhupnfWc2s4GhlCDz1w

On the side I ordered coke and a side of ranch. He told 45 minutes THREE HOURS passed I called every hour just to check on the progress since there was no courtesy call to let me know why the huge time difference. I was told the driver was pulled over and then something happened. Finally 3 hours later there's a disgruntled man at my door like he just waited 3 hungry hours for highly anticipated pizza from the late night buzz. The guy reads it off to me, tells me there's no ranch because it wasnt rung in (I was totally charged for it)  I get the pizza open it up and it's like pineapple and ham. Way off so 3 HOURS later the wrong pizza charged for things I didn't even receive.  Well months later I finally decide to give it one more chance so I call in tell them I want the same thing as last time and I'd like to redeem my comped pizza. They put me on hold for over 5 minutes to check and see if they were able to honor only for the manager NORMAN at the time get on the phone and tell me they wouldn't honor it because that manager no longer works there and hasn't in months. NORMAN told me I can call in the afternoon to see if someone else will honor it.... I already know where that's going. I asked NORMAN politely if there was anything he could do after I told him about my least experience with his establishment. So I politely told him I would be taking my business elsewhere. Also little does NORMAN know that my room mate is the graveyard head bell man  at TRUMP TOWERS so maybe they will learn that every customer should be treated with value. THANKS AGAIN NORMAN.",OcvKrzgLxYoFvDmbrgsEOw,0,0,1,DjYN2FstDhhQLc_xndI2Kw
