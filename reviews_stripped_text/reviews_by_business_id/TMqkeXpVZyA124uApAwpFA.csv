506482,2014-12-31,0,TMqkeXpVZyA124uApAwpFA,"When to eat lunch at this place today.  The place looks nice. We ordered beef salad, chicken satay, pad see ew, pineapple curry, papaya salad, and Tom yum Kai. We waited a long time for our food, since they only have one server and she was working very hard.  They need to improve their service by hiring more servers.  We heard the table next to us mentioned the same comment about the service even though they like the food.  

When our food arrived we gobbled up fast since all of us were very hungry by then.  The papaya salad was too spicy. It burn our tongue but we manage to finish it anyway. The pad see ew was excellent. It was our favorite dish. The bee salad was okay. I had to eat it all by myself since the others didn't want to eat it because of the rare beef. Our chicken satay did not come and instead they gave us chicken salad and it was just ok.  The Tom yum Kai soup was good.  The pineapple curry didn't come. They forgot it. So we instead we ordered another pad see ew. Overall the food was good but the service was slow and inconsistent because there wer only one service and she seem overwhelm.  I hope the service improve because the food is good. I like them to stay in business along time, but if they don't improve their service by having adequate staff.  They will not last.",5x1VqDLf-qfVUekEHjlnLA,0,2,3,Fv5_CiyAQJ5AywvQ5Hj2Sg

563917,2015-05-02,1,TMqkeXpVZyA124uApAwpFA,"There are three ways a restaurant can be successful:
1. Good Food
2. Good Service
3. Location, Location, Location

Hollywood Thai strikes out on all three. Let's take them one at a time.

1. Food.....I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was 5:15 on a Saturday night we came in and NOBODY was there except us. The noodles in the Pad Thai were rubbery and stuck together as if they were prepared some time in the afternoon and pre-heated for dinner. Furthermore, the Pad Thai was served luke warm.
My girlfriend ordered the curried pork ribs (called the ""chefs specialty"" on the menu). The taste to be honest was pretty good. But you get three ribs and a little bok choy for $14.95......how do you say ripped-off in Thai? Most anywhere else in Vegas I can get at least a half slab of ribs for that price.

2. Service......Simply put, there wasn't any. Again, when we arrived there was nobody else in the place. But the waitress took our order, then when the order was ready brought us our food and we never saw her again until about 3/4 of the way through our meal when she re-filled our water glass. She NEVER stopped by our table to ask, ""how is everything"" or ""can I get you anything else"". No, the whole time we were eating she was either behind the cash register or in the kitchen.

3. Location.....The only reason we went to H-Thai was it was close to where we stayed (Tahiti Village) and we had a groupon (thank God we didn't pay full price for what we got). The place looks nice from the inside but it's in a dumpy location nowhere near anything else.

You want great Thai food? We've been going to Vegas for over 20 years now and have found the best thai restaurant is Krung Siam located in China Town.
As for Hollywood Thai.......I'd give even odds that this place will even be in business a year from now.",xg6IX013gQdwnrc1M9X5JQ,2,1,1,O_s5GYE-VJWD5rZh5BGU3A
616047,2015-06-26,3,TMqkeXpVZyA124uApAwpFA,"My spouse is Thai and also happens to be an incredible cook.  We also spend considerable time in Thailand so for a foreigner, my knowledge and experience with Thai food is extensive.

My wife, her son and myself went here for lunch recently.  I and my wife ordered Thom Yum noodle soup with ground pork.  I ordered spice level 8 (range of 1 - 10) and my wife ordered level 7.  We also ordered Pud See Ewe with pork.

My noodle soup was NOT spicy and was NOT sour.  Both flavor's are essential for a dish to be considered Yum.  I would say the spice level was about 4, certainly not approaching an 8.  My wife's noodles were also remarkably mild.  The broth instead of being slightly sour was in fact somewhat sweet.  I had to request fresh limes to adjust the flavor to the sour side.  The waiter also did not bring the condiments (dry chilies, vinegar, fish sauce, pickled peppers, etc.) which allow the customer to tailor the flavor to their own taste.

The Pud See Ewe was stir fried with too much sauce and as a consequence was more moist than it should have been.  This dish should be fairly dry when prepared correctly.

I found the prices on the high side, especially given the quality of the items ordered.

If you're seeking authentically prepared noodles, you will be more satisfied elsewhere.",0vaHSbaRk2CsldclYO54vw,2,1,1,WTgsXG61pp0QWOEQbxoeCg

1676127,2015-02-18,2,TMqkeXpVZyA124uApAwpFA,"Now that Sakun Thai is under new ownership and has been sucking royally, I am thrilled to find a new Thai place near my office. I came here with a co worker who is actually a very picky girl, and we both left satisfied. 

When we arrived the place was half full for lunch. The decor was actually very charming and Thai inspired. You can tell they are newly opened because they are still working out some kinks (certain beverages and food items on the menu, but not available or in stock).

They do offer several lunch options at very reasonable prices. I expected smaller lunch portion but was quite surprised at the generous portion that was served. The lunch includes a soup, egg roll and a main dish. My co worker opted for curry and I went off the menu slightly and ordered their pad kee mao. We shared our food and both thoroughly enjoyed everything that we tried. The pad kee mao did skimp on the shrimp slightly.. I think I counted 3, but it was delicious nevertheless. 

I am excited to return here for lunch and sample more of their menu. They are in the same lot on Warm Springs where A Thyme For All Seasons once was.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,11,8,4,2oSCL89X3vkfsofYF8m1fg

4620528,2014-12-26,3,TMqkeXpVZyA124uApAwpFA,"I have no shame when it comes to FTR. So after only a single visit, here goes.

This spot certainly has a history of failure. It was Italian, then Greek, then Sushi. Then A Thyme For All Seasons made a decent run before they went back to just catering. I enjoyed my lunch today enough that I hope Hollywood Noodle sticks around for a little while.

I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup. I think Thai Style Noodle House has spoiled me because I was disappointed at the size when it came out, but it turned out to be the perfect size. The menu says squid, fish balls, crabstick and white mushroom. Instead what I got was squid, fish, mussels, and shrimp. Not a complaint. Just something I realized as I write this. I thought the broth was tasty, with a subtle heat that built up, especially as I reached the bottom of the bowl.

Note: If you're no longer offering your 50% off grand opening price, take the damn sign down. They gave us a courtesy 10% off for the confusion.

More than anything, it's nice to have another lunch option in the area. Plus, they have online ordering through Eat24 (Yelp ties into it). I'll be back.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,7,7,4,3_Axe6JXrLUoeJQTKpq4FA
