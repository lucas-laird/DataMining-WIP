Like maybe it's completely intentional that the soggy and limp crust tastes like little more than yeast and charcoal. Maybe the sauce is supposed to be watery-textured with a mostly-acidic hint of tomato. None of these  textures or flavors stood on their own or worked well together. Thankfully the salad was alright, anyway.

Service was friendly. Prices were okay for the area. The cup smelled of sour dish rag, so we asked for a paper cup, which was cheerily granted. I only saw one fly, and one other customer. The music was a CD of emo pop rock for some reason?

The high star reviews I'm seeing here use words like 'awesome', 'fantastic', and 'ridiculously delicious', but based on my pre-lunch weekend experience, I totally cannot fathom using those words.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,3,voGyT7sGhFNSNEYNR1_sZQ

557412,2015-06-09,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"I have been looking for some great pizza in Las Vegas for a long time now. I decided I needed some, so I did a search on Yelp to see where they say the best pizza in Vegas is. Many new restaurants came up in the search. Novecento came up as one of the best pizzas in town. They have an imported Italian oven at 900 degrees. That is very impressive to me. I went to the one in Henderson as it is the closest one to my house. When you first go in and look at the place you notice there is not much ambiance. You stand in line and order your pizza and sit down after ordering and paying. They are more like a fast food restaurant than a nice pizza place.

I ordered a small pepperoni pizza and started off with a small salad. The salad came out right away and it was very good. It is nice and small and was price appropriate. The pizza was not far behind. Coming out of a 900 degree oven you can imagine how hot it was. I like my pizza just short of burning the roof of your mouth, so I picked up the knife and fork and dug right in. I got a piece that had every thing the pizza had to offer. When I put it in my mouth the first and only thing I tasted was the sauce. This was a constant while eating the pizza. I couldn't taste the pepperoni, or the cheese or the pie dough. I could tell that the cheese had a nice texture to it and sat well in my mouth. I couldn't tell anything about the pepperoni, nothing. Hot, mild, salty, sweet, nothing. It might as well have not even been on the pizza. Another thing that bothered me was that I could tell that the dough was undercooked. I knew that from the first bite. When the pizza cooled enough for me to pick up a slice the whole slice sagged. There wasn't even the slightest bit of rigidity to it. The outside of the crust was slightly browned, but not like I would expect it to be.

I don't know what was wrong that day. Maybe the oven wasn't up the temp. Maybe the pizza was pulled from the oven too soon. Maybe the person making the pizza wasn't being attentive. I just don't know. I will give it another try at some point. But for now I don't don't know when because I was not impressed and there are a lot of other pizza restaurants to try in Las Vegas.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,2,1,2,ZHMBnWJXQF31Ur4z_xJS9g

It was pretty quiet and no wait, I ordered a margherita pizza with fresh tomato ($10). The staff seemed to be pushing the salads, I had four ask if I wanted salad - No thank (x4). A wide spread of toppings is on display, much like Custom Built, but here it'll cost you a pretty penny if you add more than a couple. The crust is pretty thin and wet so you'd probably only want a few at most. But possibilities are endless. By the time I filled my drink and grabbed a seat my pizza was ready. It had a nice char, I wish it was a bit more crisp, but it had good flavor, and fresh ingredients. However, it is Settebello that brings me right back to Italy. My pizzas there have been more evenly cooked and a bit better flavor and texture. Had I never been there or Italy, I'd think more highly of Novecento. 

Within a half mile on Eastern you can have solid NY style at Grimaldi's, great Chicago  style at Windy City Beefs N Pizza and Novecento provides a taste of Italy with its Napoletana style pizza. It's win-win, for whatever your mood.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,4,4,3,3Ac4VtJT7xom2f4owUXMlg

1139131,2013-09-17,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Finally made it to one of the novecento pizzerias.  I was kinda surprised by the lay out - very similar to Custom Pizza on Flamingo.  Basically, it's a high end ""Subway"" style pizza place.  You start by selecting a base pizza, they had a $13.99 lunch special - pizza ( one topping), a salad and a soft drink.  Extra toppings are a $1 each.  I went with Sausage and Meatball ( pic attached ) - they have numerous topping options - all looked great.

I was slightly disappointed that the meatball was grounded up instead of 1/2ed or polpette style.  Still, the flavor was above average.  Another slight ding - I expected the crust to have a little more crunch which makes me question the actual temperature of the oven - even at two minutes at 900 degrees, wouldn't the crust have some crisp ?  There's definitely blistering.  But again, the pizza is very flavorful.  I think next visit i'll ask that they keep the pizza in a little longer.

I opted for the Caesar salad which was also very good.

At novacento that is what you get. The beet salad and arugula salad was amazingly fresh, and for the $5.00 small salad, you got more than enough. Now for the pizza. Done in 90 seconds, it is not what you would normally get at a pizzeria. The middle of the pizza was very wet, while the crust was perfectly charred. The philosophy is that you dip the crust into the middle of the pizza to soak up all the good tastes, then eat the middle. It was so yummy, I can't wait to come back. Leaving for Italy tomorrow, so I can compare pizzas.

1500126,2014-01-19,0,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"The pizza is delicious and takes ONLY 90 seconds to cook. One of the major problems I have is that it's a ""subway"" type process for personalizing your pizza, so it can take an extremely long time before it's your turn to start customizing your pie. There are so many options, most people get confused and freeze up like a hot breadstick was just shoved up their ass. The ordering flow is just horrible and it only allows for one employee to make the pizzas while the rest of the employees stand around looking stoned. I also don't suggest calling in for pick up.

1643554,2013-09-08,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"A small group of us (six) popped in just before 7 PM Saturday night to give 90 second pizza a try.  They were very accommodating, putting tables together for us.  Since it was our first time, my husband and I decided to each order something different to maximize our tasting experience, and we also ordered a small beet salad.  Wine is available, as is Italian beer on tap.  A nice selection of gelato awaits you at the end of the counter as well.

My husband opted to make his own pizza, selecting various fresh ingredients from the  wide selection available - he chose spicy sausage, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, and...other stuff I can't remember.  Loved the spicy sausage!

I ordered the Roma - fresh tomatoes under a blanket of fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced pancetta, fresh basil, romano cheese and one brown egg.  Slightly rich and definitely savory.

The pizza crust is a beautiful combination of espresso, coffee, and beige coloring with a slightly chewy texture.  The edges of the crust are the most well done, and the middle is the softest.  Don't forget to soak up the juicy goodness in the middle - especially if you order a Roma or any pizza with an egg!  By the way, the pizza is about 9 inches and big enough to eat by yourself if you're really hungry and great for sharing, especially with a salad.

The beet salad was really nice, especially because we wanted something cold and fresh.  Speaking of which, the Peroni on tap was a nice surprise and it's served nice and cold.  If the beer glasses were chilled, it would've been perfect.

I ordered a glass of the house wine (made from nero d' avola).  I loved that it was served in a casual drinking glass, but disappointed that it was a bit warm (warmer than room temp) and it was a bit smaller pour than I expected (standard pour is usually 5 oz).

Overall, everyone really enjoyed the casual atmosphere, good pizza, and good company and we'll be back to try some other specialty pizzas.",KdQq5g7AjZyCrB2gzwHsmQ,1,1,4,wZX5y_WhORTiXdJ2CIia5Q

Very dark and small pizza joint located on Eastern, between Cafe Zupas and Taco Y Taco.

Upon walking in the place was dead.. And dirty.. Dishes still on the tables and about a handful of tables that were somewhat clean and available to eat at. 

We were greeted, then left, then asked if it was our first time there, then left, then a different person helped us.. Even though it was a slow evening for them, the fellow helping us was super slow! He wasn't too sure of the menu and in my opinion, needed more training ..

Seriously flies hovering all around the place .. I'm trying to tell myself that they did not at all touch the ingredients on the counter.. My friend and I both got the gluten free dough, which was pre packaged and very flat.. Only comes in 10"" with two toppings, everything else are extra add-ons.
I added the pesto sauce, sautéed spinach, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto drizzled with olive oil added once it cooked.

Pizza came out pretty quickly.. But was a little too burnt for me. I like the crispyness and the thinness of the crust but parts I could not get over the burnt taste.
Ingredients were ok, nothing to grand about the pancetta or prosciutto, fresh mozzarella was good, and I would've liked more olive oil. 

I've had other gluten free pizzas, but this one was just not that great for me.. I was bummed they didn't have the whole wheat because ""it wasn't ready"".. 

I've wanted to try the place since it opened and since lots of Yelpers put good reviews about it. I would've been happier across the street at Grimaldi's or the next freeway exit at Settebello.

Honestly when I first heard about Novecento I thought that it was just going to be a gimmicky type of spot. Pizza in ""90 seconds "" in a 900 degree oven... but, I put my assumptions of gimmicks aside and stepped into the restaurant. 

I felt a little be disorientated as to what exactly I was supposed to do, so I stepped to the counter as said that it was my first time here and I wasn't sure how to order. They told me that I would select a type of dough, a sauce and some toppings and that it would get cooked in 90 seconds. I chose the regular dough and pesto sauce as a base. I then topped it with mozzarella, pepperoni, basil, and anchovies. Then they swooped it away and put it in the oven. 

I shuffled over to the gelato case which apparently comes from Art of Flavors. Awesome! Now I don't have to drive all the way to the store near downtown to get their gelato - and before I could finish taking a picture of the case they told me my pizza was done - heh.  

The pizza was really tasty - I really enjoyed my toppings and I would definitely come back again.

So got me excited about trying his pizza because that one thing did not try on my visit to Parma by Chef Marc. Not that was disappointed but feel like after Parma by Chef Marc my pizza experience came up short. The service was nothing short but solid the guys making the pizza were friendly, explained the process since it was my first time clearly,  and made building your own pizza fun. The inside was nothing special your basic pizza parlor tables and couple booths. Some reason talk about cranking the a/c action. I felt like was in refrigerator. Not just me the lady behind me ordering had the same thought and even went outside eat her pizza. Not sure if keep it at that temperature just fyi.

The thing about the pizza was the pizza sauce was bland in my mind. I had the spicy diablo sauce. Not that was looking for extreme kick but nothing spicy about it. The tomato sauce felt like lacked depth and was more sauce out of a can. Not much seasoning to it. The toppings the fresh mozzarella awesome. I went with straight forward pepperoni and sausage pie. The pepperoni it was your sliced thin variety and sausage was italian forgot to ask or sure guy told me. I like more the thicker cut of pepperoni. So the basic thin sliced pepperoni not excite me. Not fan of the flavor. Lot of other options comes to toppings so maybe just ordered wrong combination. The dough was ok. It different style softer dough so the crust not as crispy and has more char looked on it. Overall nothing that rave about my pizza.

Caprese: Great quality cheese. This salad is giant. I felt like a jerk enjoying this cheese monster. So good.

Bianco - Pesto, Gorgonzola, roasted onions, fresh Mozzarella, Truffle Arugula. If you are a arugula lover, this pizza is great. Don't mess it up by adding too much to it. It is great on its own.

Roma - Margherita with Pancetta, brown egg, cracked pepper, grated Romano cheese.  The egg makes this pizza. Super savory.

Naples - Marinara, Bufala Mozzerella  basil, EVO, grated cheese. I like this pizza, but always find myself adding pancetta and olives to it. I should just appreciate the simplicity of it.

You can choose among the prepared specialty pizzas ($12 or so) or build your own pizza (cheese pizzas start at $8.99 with every additional toppings at $1 each).  You can choose from four different sauces: marinara, spicy marinara, white sauce, or pesto.  They've also got a great selection of cheeses, meats, and fresh veggies to choose from.

Now these Naples style pizzas are not your average take-out pizzas--they've got that authentic taste that many places just can't replicate.  It's different.  I ordered two pizzas--the Naples pizza (marinara, bufala mozzarella, basil, grated cheese, and EVOO) with the house sausage; and built our own pizza with spicy marinara, mozzarella, basil, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomatoes.  The two pizzas totaled to about $25.  It literally takes like 5 minutes for the pizzas to cook in their wood-fired oven--SO FAST!  It probably took us longer trying to decide what we were going to get. 

The pizzas were delicious.  Thin crust.  May have needed more cheese and or basil--my faves! ;) But overall: delicious!  Great with a glass of red!  Best eaten while still warm... they lose their crispiness once cold.",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,2,1,4,tcCYbvDvWlb5XIPzmiPL0A

So we went at an off hour and the place was empty.  We got the lunch special for three of us which included a nice salad, a drink and a personal pizza.

2911648,2014-03-03,2,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Its A-ok.

Went last week to check this place  out for the first time. Its a small place right next to Smashburger on Eastern Avenue about a mile south of the 215. I was diggin' the vibe when we got thru the door. It's set up where you immediately enter a line, pick your crust, than your topping, etc. The guys working were friendly and willing to answer questions for a newbie. 

We each ordered a personal pizza. I ordered mine with pineapples, chicken, and extra cheese. Once you place your order, you grab your drinks and have a seat. It took less than 3 or 4 minutes for them to be delivered to our table. It was nice that we weren't kept in suspense for too long!

The pies were quite tasty! The problem with mine was that the crust couldn't support the topping, so everything kept falling off, which made eating with a fork necessary...and not the way I prefer to eat my pizza! I actually don't like my pizza with too many topping, so I dodn't think that was the issue. 

The pies were fairly priced around $5-$6 each, but the drinks were a gouger at 2.50 each. I didn't get a chance to try the gelato that I've heard so much about, but they did look good and will definitely happen on a future trip.

....and there will be a future trip. I still want to try a ew other things on the menu, like the calzones. Plus my experience wasn't nearly bad enough to scare me off, but I think there is potential for this place to be really solid. 

But, for now, I will keep it at 3 stars...not the greatest, not the worst....will update at the appropriate time. Worth checking out.

Ok, I know everyone loves Parma, well to me, its just ok. The pizza is indeed fabulous, but I never got the hype like EVERY OTHER ELITE YELPER! However, I was willing to give Novecento a try as Chef Marc as a person always impressed me. 
My first experience was at the West side location and I did a 3 star review. I only went once, and knew when they came to my area that I would give them another shot. 
I did, and I am so glad. 
As soon as you walk in, it smells like what I imagine Italy smells like. But I am only guessing. 
We had multiple different pizzas, from plain sausage to white with ricotta and olives. Cooked to the perfect crisp! The employees were so helpful to the kids (11 and 16) who were with me and had never been. They made sure to come out and ask how they liked their pies. 
I ran into a fellow Yelper there too, that's how you know its good! 
I cant wait to try a salad next time!
Luckily, Shirley B. commented on my check in letting me know they serve Art of Flavors gelato. WHAT?!!?!? We sampled almost all of them and of course indulged! 
Honestly, after this trip, I want to give Parma another chance and I never thought I would say that. 
Thanks for bringing your amazing pizza to my area! Both kids said its their new favorite pizza and gelato spot, so I have a feeling you will be seeing more of us.

2999513,2013-10-06,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Quick review: First experience with Novecento and was really disappointed. Quite possibly the worst pizza I have had in my entire life (and I have eaten pizza from gas stations, truck stops and bodegas among other places). Both pizzas were tossed in the garbage. 

In depth review: visited on 10/5 at 8pm and ordered two ""specialty pizzas"" - the Roma and the Calabrese along with an Arugula Salad (to go). First impression was positive. Charming little pizza parlor / restaurant with a cool wood burning oven in the corner. The gentlemen working the counter were very polite in taking our order and chatting us up. Smelled really good and all signs were pointing towards a great experience. 

So one of our pizzas was pulled out of the oven and placed to the side and the cook working the oven informed us they had to re-do it cause it was ""too thin"" in the middle and would not be edible. Same cook also asked us what we ordered when the new pizza came to him to fire, he seemed confused and he was questioning the prep cook about the way he made the pie. He still went ahead and fired it. Guess that should have tipped us off. 

So we cash out ($29.19) and make our way home, short two mile drive up the hill. The lady has the Roma and I am eating the Calabrese. Both bite in and both make faces of disgust. First off: both pizzas have non existent crust in the middle, simply just cheese and grease soup. The outer crust on both is burnt black but somehow undercooked and still tastes like raw dough? Odd. 

The Roma: tasted like someone poured a pound of raw salt on it. This was not lightly salted from the meat or cheese. As bad as sticking out your tongue and someone pouring raw salt on it. Was the saltiest food item I have ever eaten at a restaurant (honestly). Salt was overpowering and I wonder did they pour an entire bottle of Garlic Salt on it? 

The Calabrese: too damn spicy and hot. I understand that they advertise spice but this dish was an unbearable 5 Alarm. Please note that I put Franks Red Hot on everything and spice typically does not bother me. This was painful to eat and the spice (heat) overpowered any flavor or taste in the pizza. You using Ghost Peppers on the pie? Had to stop after 4 bites and toss it. Have a burning sensation in stomach and eating Rolaids now (not kidding).  

Win one star for the Arugula Salad. It was OK and tasted just fine. Kudos with that.

The cooks need better training and someone needs to start managing these guys and watching what they are sending out to the customers. Sorry I had to write this but I have never had to throw out pizza due to it being inedible. Feel like I wasted my money and my Saturday night. We made grilled cheese to compensate and fill our bellies.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,4,2,1,clLarkXLVODBSSuXSk4ihg
3015742,2014-08-10,0,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Want to make your own pizza? Cool. Start by choosing your crust (type and size) they roll and toss it. (They actually make the Pizza under your direction.) Choose your sauce (pesto is YUM, and if you like spicy the diabolo is great) add the fresh mozzarella and basil then hit the toppings! So many to choose from. After you have finished your creation it goes into the brick oven for just a couple minutes and is delivered hot to your table. I have overheard others stating their pizza is ""soggy"" in the middle-it all depends on your topping choices. The crust is thin. Overall good pizza. They serve beer and wine.

My gf and I ordered a half pepperoni/margherita pizza, beet salad with red wine vinaigrette, and a scoop of strawberry gelato. The pizza received the bulk of the points because of its flavor and the crusts ability to withhold the moisture of the mozzarella. The beet salad was the down side of our meal. The butter lettuce claims to be living lettuce (cut from the root) but was browned and shriveled. The big chunks of beet were unappetizing and the salad needed a saltier cheese. Without the light, tasting dressing, this salad would have been inedible. Last was the sorry scoop of strawberry gelato that was no different than carnations ice cream.

If you have not had a Neapolitan pizza expect something new. This style of pie is smaller, softer, and has a more sparse arrangement of cheese and toppings. The emphasis is on the flavor of a few quality ingredients versus the large quantity of an American style pie.

All of that said, Novecento (sounds sexier than quattrocento ottanta cinque) is a fantastic place to get a pizza and anything else.

We ordered spicy marinara, lots of fresh garlic, whole roasted garlic, basil, spicy salami and banana peppers. Chef Marc explained to us the style of pizza it was and how it's made to eat a certain way. I asked him to make it extra crispy and he said he would try his best. We sat down, got all our necessary seasonings and chef Marc brought our pizza to us. Oh man! Crust was super crispy and the flavor of just the crust was amazing! I could eat the crust alone! All of our toppings were complimenting each other so well. I love how they offer spicy marinara! Because it adds even more flavor to the pizza. Every bite, my eyes were huge and I was satisfied. I kept raving about how good it was after each bite!

Only thing I could ""complain"" about is the atmosphere. If it were a more cozy restaurant, where it didn't feel like I was just grabbing something quick. I really like Settebello's environment. It makes lunch on a sunny day so much better! But that's the only ""bad"" thing I could say.

No knives on the table, only forks and an empty napkin holder. Some balsamic was available and some oil, pretty sure vegetable or canola as a condiment, so nasty. The chopped salad was thoroughly overdressed and all you could taste was the raspberry vinaigrette and Gorgonzola.

Jaime ordered the Margherita, which was stellar. The tomato sauce was seriously delicious, as was my pesto sauce on my Bianco. The crust was good, though I still love my precious Settebello's crust more.

I've been here three times now in a short time and it has been terribly inconsistent. My first time here I was so disappointed I was hesitant to give them a second try, but with all the glowing reviews, I figured they had an off day. I had a fairly simple order, just veggies. The pizza was terrible, from the crust to the toppings. And if I hear one more person tell me ""maybe you had too many toppings"". Why would these toppings be offered if it wasn't supposed to go on my pizza? 

Fast forward to last night. I ordered the Margherita. This has to be the safest pizza to order. I understand with Neapolitan style, there won't be a lot of cheese, and it's more crushed tomatoes than an actual ""pizza sauce"". I am happy to say, I liked my pizza. 

So I return tonight (I went for gelato, but the guy making the pizza recognized me from the night before and I felt like a jerk for not ordering pizza) so I order another Margherita. Tonight my pizza came out so charred, all I tasted was carcinogens. The entire crust all the way around was blistered black and the pieces of basil were fried to a crisp. 

I find their pizza to not be ""wet"" or ""soggy"" like traditional style. Their oven must be drier.

4074518,2014-01-17,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"After taking multiple trips to Italy the last few years, I have been desperately searching for an authentic, high-quality pizza in the states. One of my friends suggested I head across town to try Novencento and I wasn't disappointed. 

The major draw here is the quality of the ingredients. Super high quality dough, olive oil, salami and cheese makes the pizza superior to other pizzas. This is true European / Italian style pizza. Pizza Hut it ain't. 

It was my first visit and I found the concept and layout very confusing. There are no big signs to direct you where to go -- just a sort of rude sounding sign that screams WAIT HERE. Well, I waited while 3 guys just stood around behind the pizza toppings counter. After a few minutes they finally called me over. I told them it was my first time in and they offered no instruction or help at all. I'm a smart diner but this place is super confusing! 

I decided on a margherita pizza. It looks like you can add toppings to customize, but they suggest you add no more than 3. I get it, the pizza won't cook all the way through if it's loaded down, but there has to be a better way to suggest this to people. I felt like they were telling me in a food snob way and sort of ""looking down their noses"" at me. It was awkward and uncomfortable.

The pizza itself was tasty but not as great as I had hoped. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. While the crust was appropriately blackened from the oven, the center of my dough was too raw. This is not my fault, it's an issue with the cooks because I ordered the margherita pizza right off the menu and added NOTHING to my pizza. I was afraid to say anything because I was sure they'd cop an attitude and act like I didn't know what I was talking about.

So why 4 stars? I love the concept and idea of this place, they just need a few minor tweaks to get it right. Some sort of large signage and a menu board would help, and by all means have something to help out newcomers. Second, the quality of the food was so high that I will definitely be back to give Novocento another chance. The chopped salad was very good and was a standout. To keep with the Italian theme, they have a small gelato counter and they serve Illy coffee (my favorite), so I'll be sure to get an espresso next time I'm in.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,0,0,4,iNs1W2V5sYxbxq7f2rH7LA

I like how the oven is so hot it only takes 90 seconds to cook.  I recommend waiting four minutes after they drop it off at your table to let it cool and save the roof of your mouth.

Let's begin with the easy, no-nonsense approach to ordering, much like you would a typical phone-in pizzeria you can select whatever toppings you desire on a base pizza you like...we like the Margherita Pizza...marinara, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, grated cheese, and EVO...AND we add fresh garlic and fresh ricotta cheese. Yes, everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough, then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first, it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?
We also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants, now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! 
The pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas, sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.
The burrata is very creamy and rich, and it does fill you up a little. The other times, we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic and EVO...delicious.
Now I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's, but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,26,23,4,sZKZMly2TYd8U9R4kxS9ZQ
4451942,2015-08-03,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"I don't know what to say, based on all the positive reviews I really expected this place to be better. I kind of wonder if it has gone downhill since it has opened? I was very excited to try this place out as I am not in Henderson very often, but happened to be around the area around dinner time. I stopped in and the place was empty save for a few diners. 

It's easy to see how it's set up. You order your pizza, they make it, throw it in their spiffy oven and off you go. Obviously the main point of this place is that you get your pizza super quick, which is great -- as long as the pizza and customer service are good!

I gave my order - pretty simple, the Margherita pizza with addition of pepperoni. I figured the guy was on it and I proceeded to pay. At the time I was there the soda dispenser was out of order. Then, after I paid I noticed the guy making the pizza kind of staring at me and he said, ""What kind of cheese do you want?"" Well. I want the cheese that comes on the margherita pizza. I listed off what I wanted on the pizza, one ingredient at a time and then he started prepping it.

I took a seat while the pizza was made. I took it to go, so maybe that wasn't the best idea. When I got home I flipped my oven on to 400 and threw the pizza in, just to warm it back up for a minute or so.

As for the pizza, I don't know, I just wasn't a fan. It was really burnt on the edges (yes, I know a product of the super hot oven), but overall it just didn't have that great of a taste, I wasn't impressed.

I'd like to go back to give them a second chance. Definitely try a different pizza and probably just go ahead and eat it right there in the restaurant itself. Maybe that will make it better.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,2,ZLwz8EWOBf2JVACmSlvWeA

I LOVE pizza and have had pizza from several places, but NONE like this since my time in the military in Italy.  There is no other place in town that cooks your pizza in an oven at 900 degrees.  What does that mean?  It means pizza in about 90 seconds, and the taste, is like eating pizza in Naples, Italy.

Now if you have never had pizza in Italy, it is soggy in the middle and so yummy to use the crust to soak it up.  This is how pizza is eaten in Italy and if you don't like it, then don't leave the country, because you will find the same overseas.

To me, this place ROCKS!!!!  You walk in and go down the line as they prepare the pizza in front of you, meaning they toss the crust, put on your choice of sauce, toppings and you pay while it goes to the oven.  If you ordered a drink, by the time you get your drink, sit down and get comfortable your pizza is on the table.

After reading other reviews I think people misunderstand this style of pizza.  The crust can be fragile if too many toppings are on it, but this is the style; a soft and chewy crust.  

True Italian Pizza is about the crust, not the toppings.  This is more of an Italian style pizza place and the toppings are meant more as a compliment to the crust than to be the dominant flavors, so when they're too busy it defeats the purpose. 

I didn't have any of the issues that others mentioned but I think that's because I got simple pizzas.  My tip to all is if you get a pizza that has heavier toppings is to ask for it a little well-done. 

The white pizza was delicious!  The Pepperoni Pizza was good, a little bland but still good.  I definitely like Grimaldi's better, but this is a solid pizza place.  

I'll definitely be back because I love the convenience of this place since the pizza is done in just two minutes.

4870324,2014-06-29,0,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Finding pizza I like in Vegas has been a Problem for me, after a few years experiencing what Chicago had to offer. I was not expecting Novecento to be as awesome as it is. It's clean, quick, affordable, high-quality not-fast-food that is ridiculously delicious.

It's Neapolitan style pizza; which means Crispy outer crust with poofy bubbles, and a soft, floppy bottom to the crust. I usually go here with co-workers for a quick lunch, and they actually deliver on the 90-second promise. They have a few lunch specials, but I usually do the pizza, salad, and a drink for $12, and mix up the ingredients on the pizza. I'm a huge fan of their not-sweet but totally real tomato red sauce, and they have a cured meat selection I have not been able to fully penetrate. (My reviews are developing a cured meat theme, lately)

Normally when a lunch special includes a ""salad"" what you're gonna get is the shakings out of a dole bag of ""Meh"" sometimes complete with back of the fridge ice. This is not what you get at Novecento. I keep getting the ceasar, because they put about a quarter cup of freshly shaved parmesan on top of fresh, lovely romaine and homemade croutons. Aaaaaand sold. 

The pizza's great. And then they have gelato. And espresso. Which, YES, they will make into an Affogato for you, if you want a desert that will save you from the impending food coma. Which I highly recommend. 

Apparently they just got a Spring Valley location, which makes me very, very happy.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,5,LYIWz2mUkeb337P9CwHIZw

4958525,2013-09-28,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"We had lunch at Novecento on a weekday.  There were a couple of tables, but we didn't have to wait at all when ordering.  The pizza maker explained the process to us and couldn't have been nicer.  Both my wife and I opted for the lunch special, a pizza with 1 topping, salad and drink for $13.95.  This is a FANTASTIC price, as you get so much food for the money.  Neither one of us finished our lunches, and I'm not known for failing to finish meals.  So, even though a $15 lunch probably isn't in the cards every day, it certainly was a great value.

To eat, I had the homemade sausage with roasted garlic and the Caesar salad.  I got the spicy sauce (they have a choice of 4) and I definitely noticed a difference in heat level when I tasted my wife's pizza.  The regular sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes to me, almost no additional flavor.  This isn't a bad thing, but I liked the spice in my sauce.  When they say the oven cooks the pizza in 90 seconds, they aren't kidding.  We were only a couple of bites into our salads when they brought the pizzas out.  

Of the salads, the chopped was the winner.  Loaded with ingredients, you could taste blue cheese in nearly every bite.  I will order this next time.  The Caesar was what you expect, it was a fine Caesar salad.

The pizza was, of course, the star.  The homemade sausage is flavorful but lacks heat.  So, I was again glad I opted for the spicy sauce.  The crust is blistered, a little burnt in spots but chewy as well.  It's my favorite style of pizza crust, and was excellent.  Also, if you are a garlic person, you must add the roasted garlic.  It adds a little bit of sweet, and as you roast it, the garlic flavor is tamed a bit.  Next time, I may get double garlic, it was that good.

Don't think because it's pizza you can't have a quick lunch or dinner.  You can.  Also, the quality of this place makes it worthy of a weekend dinner as well.  Highly recommended.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,0,0,4,FZsAKnVDY4Ee9bj3AimS0g
4974803,2013-08-20,7,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"After hearing about Chef Marc's latest restaurant in Henderson, we took a little drive over there.  We called the original Novecento to confirm that they were indeed open. (Apparently, there was a soft opening going on the Thursday and Friday before where free pizzas were given out!)

On the Saturday we went, they had a BOGO Margherita pizza special going on.  The Margherita pizza was $8.99 each and toppings were $1 extra each.  They come out to about 10"". We added toppings to one and kept the second one standard.  Since the staff are still training, we did notice that both pizzas came out quite different. Chef Marc came over to chat with us and he noticed our pizzas too. This is when things got exciting...

He invited us to the back to learn how to make a proper Napoletana (Neapolitan) pizza! No way! So the Husband washed up and headed into the kitchen and that's when we got a real education about this style of pizza.  I am far from an expert on pizza, but after the schooling we got, we were looking at pizza in a whole new way!

He explained how their dough is made and how long it sits, and demonstrated on how it's supposed to get pulled and stretched to just the right consistency. Then it's off to their fresh tomato sauce and the various toppings.  And a swirl of olive oil at the end is mandatory. And finally it goes into their 1000 degree oven and voila! the perfect Napoletana pizza!

But wait, there's more! You don't cut this kind of pizza! You pull the crusty edges and dip it into the tasty center where all the flavors have pooled together.  And when all the crust is gone, you get a knife and fork and eat it with utensils!! (I knew I wasn't the weird one for wanting to eat my pizza with a fork and knife all the time. And plus, there's never any wasted crust now!)

This pizza was pretty damn good and it made a huge difference having Chef Marc's passion and expertise in it. The whole experience was five stars!

When you go, be sure to tell them not to cut your pizza and bring on the knife and fork. You're going to eat this Napoletana pizza the way it was meant to be eaten!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,19,20,5,ubKCDCxAqQ4vPg4q1hvN2Q

5094942,2013-09-10,15,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"From Chef Marc Sgrizzi of Parma comes an outstanding pizzeria.  Wow!

Note:  This is the sister restaurant to the original opened in Centennial under the name Novecento Pizzeria.  Same menu, same phenomenal quality.

Chef Marc's passion for sharing his craft shows.  Truly Italian.  It results in great food and a light atmosphere.

The pizzas are crafted in the Napolitano way as set forth by the Italian government.  Personal pizzas, 11 inches in diameter, thicker crust than Roman pizzas baked in a wood burning (they use almond hardwood) at 900 degrees  for literally 90 seconds.  The extremely glutinous 00 flour from Campania  creates a very chewy, well blistered crust.  

Sauces are well made, with the classic crushed San Marzano tomato puree being very good; not to thick with sweet, acidic tomato goodness.  A spicy version has good heat and chili flavor.

Toppings are designed for the quick cooking.  Quality throughout with excellent house made sausage and its hints of fennel, moist and toothsome meatballs, sweet seasoned eggplant, tender artichokes and fresh mozzarella.  Of cause, being America and being trained by a place whose slogan was ""have it your way"", there are a large number of other toppings that can be added.  Want peaches, figs, pineapple, even smoked salmon and pesto, go for it.

Simple starters including a delicious chopped salad loaded with salami, oven roasted peppers, and gorgonzola and dressed in a zesty red wine vinaigrette, oven roasted escarole and beans dressed in olive oil and house sausage.  

Very friendly counter staff.  No waiter service.  

Despite its greatness, authenticity, and low price, it is still eclipsed by Settebello Pizzeria Napolitano with slightly better seasoning, crust flavor, quality toppings, ambiance, and wine program. 

Regardless, Wow!",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,21,4,OxdzGbYLV0MP0ZqZqaHh3A

5170472,2013-09-03,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"Let me explain, how I stumbled upon this level of pizza deliciousness! I was driving on two wheels, of course, to In-N-Out. Well after leaving In-N-Out, I was driving down the street and all I saw was WOOD FIRED! That was enough to get me to stop...while still holding my burger in one hand, I ran in and got a menu. All I wanted was a menu because I already knew ""I'll Be Back!""

24 hours later and a fully digested burger, I returned to Novecento Pizzeria 900. First, I must explain, this is not your normal take-out pizza that's thrown together, mass produced, and down right an insult to true pizzerias around the world! Novecento Pizzeria 900, is the real deal! Grant it, I have not had pizza in Italy, but Chef Marc, who owns Novecento has, and that makes all the difference in his pizza making skills.

First and foremost, let's start out with the most important part of Novecento, CUSTOMER SERVICE! Do you hear me out there, business owners, CUSTOMER SERVICE! When you walk into Novecento, you're immediately greeted by the pizza geniuses behind the glass counter, which features a wide open kitchen to view them in action. Everyone is happy, did you hear me, they are happy, you know why? Because there pizza is perfect! How can one not be happy, using fresh mozzarella, tomatoes from Italy, and the best Pizza crust I have ever tasted!

Then there is Chef Marc, yes, he is a real chef, who decided he wanted to take his love of cooking and eating great food around Las Vegas, and turn that into a great pizza, mission accomplished! Chef Marc stated that he did not want to just give consumers a fast food pizza experience, made in a steel oven, and mass produced. Chef Marc wanted to focus on quality, i.e. wood fired oven, tomatoes from Italy, people, fresh mozzarella cheese and did I mention the made to order Chopped Salads! Oh, don't forget the gelato, I had the spumoni, and it was pure deliciousness!

People, please believe me, this pizza is da' bomb, lol! I went to Novecento Pizzeria 900 with the intention to eat Pizza Margherita with Pepperoni, and yes, I did eat that, but I also ate Pizza Margherita with Sausage too! And they both were divine! When you are in town, or when Novecento Pizzeria 900 opens in your city, yes, you heard it from me first, I see mass locations around the U.S., you must stop in, and eat a pizza or two!

As much an event as a meal it was mere moments after our party was seated that the education began and kicking off the afternoon with rich steamed-to-order hot chocolate each item to follow would prove superior in both ingredients and in skill, the salads complex and balanced while every item from the oven featured a smoky note of char overlying supple, leavened crust with great chew and a sloppy center.  Admittedly a special event from the opening bites to the off-menu dessert pies and Art of Flavors superlative gelato I can only speak to my experience with Chef Marc manning the ovens, but dollar for dollar I've yet to find a better pizza in Las Vegas and while that search will undoubtedly go on and potentially uncover one better I'd be truly shocked if it comes from a more humble and dedicated man.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0,0,5,YH7sjDN4OsHcRLv57cVOjA

5805796,2013-10-07,1,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"I tried this place in hopes it would be as good as my all time favorite neapolitan pizza place in Minneapolis. Unfortunately it missed the mark a bit, but it was still very good and will keep me happy until I can go back to Minneapolis. I had the standard margherita pizza just for comparison sake. Everything tasted fresh, the only thing it was missing was a sprinkle of sea salt on the crust. I also had the chopped salad which was pretty satisfying. Before returning I will probably try Settebello to see which place I like better.",yvMQhKw2_dq-bgf3lOCjEg,0,0,4,3N13G97J_2q1-RyUI5lthQ

There were two guys working here when we came. The 1st (Sebastian) was EXTREMELY rude, my jaw was on the floor in shock of how terrible his customer service was. Seemingly half sleeping, acted very impatient with us, rolling his eyes and saying quick comments. Made us feel like we were a complete waste of his time. Have never been treated so poorly by a server at a restaurant.  Luckily the other (unfortunately I didn't catch his name) was VERY kind and friendly, and took very careful attention to our pizza to make sure we were happy. Don't know if I want to come here again, while the pizza was great, I'm not sure the rudeness was worth it.",Ruc8nqJX_rBbEZV1yNDQYA,3,0,2,e6whDkhZPFakoo6rR-oYww

I'll eat pizza, but it's nothing I would normally go out and get.

With that said, after reading so many great reviews in the various newspapers about their Northwest location, I decided to try the new Southeast/Henderson area location that just opened.

I was pleasantly surprised.  This isn't your normal pizzeria.  It's sort of laid out like a Subway sandwich shop, where the ingrediants are displayed directly in front of you and you choose what you want on it.  All of the ingredients are fresh.  The pizza dough hand crafted right in front of you as well.  After topping off, it's cooked for 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven, then topped off again with stuff (like Arugula) that shouldn't be heated.

I had the Bianco.  Very good.  I'm kind of in the mood for another one right now... even though it's PIZZA!",T2y6TokoIIhXniks0ifCTA,1,1,4,c6yhT6WnOkU4Y35X4oqUxw
5944584,2014-07-27,0,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,This place is delicious for those who enjoy this style of pizza. It's fast but authentic tasting. Very friendly staff. A little pricey for what we got but it doesn't have to be and they have specials everyday. It's conveniently located by my house as well. Would make a nice casual date location as well.,gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,0,0,5,6F8VVP_HdZaDUXD8PoM4SQ
5960059,2014-01-01,2,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"I've finally reached review number 1000 and what better way to celebrate that than a review for pizza. 

I have wanted to try this place since they opened this location in Henderson and was so excited to get the opportunity to check it out as a going away lunch with my team. We arrived around noon and they had saved a table for our group, which was nice. We stood in the line and I knew what I wanted before I even ordered based on pictures and reviews I has read from fellow Yelpers. I like the concept. Very similar to other pizza places around that allow you to pick what you want on your pizza a la Subway but with higher quality ingredients. 

I tried the Roma with egg. Cooked for 90 seconds our food was all ready by the time we filled our drinks and took our seats. Stellar. The pizza was solid. Not the best I've had but definitely tasty. I am looking forward to trying many of their other topping combinations. A few of my coworkers has ordered strombolis and calzones, which looked tasty as well. 

While here, we couldn't resist having some Art of Flavors gelato as well. I love when local businesses work together to cross promote their products and what better combination than pizza and gelato. 

While not the best pizza I have had in town, it is solid for the price point and look forward to giving them another try soon, if not only to get a scoop of gelato as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,7,4,l9nn5D8GiQrEtmuRvo-tBw
5979185,2015-03-16,3,dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,"""What.... is... happening........."" the only thought that was going through my mind the entire time I was trying to order here this past weekend. Either they just hired an entirely new staff or they are all firing up something other than pizza in the back, but something wonky was definitely going on. One guy, who seemed to be the only person who knew what he was doing, was running frantically back and forth between the chopping station, dough station, and cash register. Two other guys were making pizza. I ordered the Naples pizza with added prosciutto because I don't like to think too hard. So he does the dough, does the sauce, then looks at me and asks, ""so what would you like on it?"" .....""um... the mozzarella, basil, EVOO, and added prosciutto.... the Naples pizza?"" he puts the mozzarella on. looks at the menu board, looks at the pizza, looks at me, ""basil, too?"" ... yes... and so on and so forth. The entire exchange is essentially repeated when my friend orders the pizza bianco as well. Then we get to the cash register, the one guy who knew what he was doing tells the girl ""a naples pizza with prosciutto and a pizza bianco."" we say no, we're paying separately. she says ok, so which one is yours? ""the naples pizza with prosciutto."" ""ok"" stares blankly at the cash register. looks to find the guy who knows what he's doing who has to come back over to punch the order in. again, repeat with my friend's order

Luckily, the pizza does fire in 90 seconds, so the food came out quickly after that. 

The pizza itself was pretty good. The 7"" is a perfect size. The crust was a little soggy in the center for my taste, but they do advertise as ""soft-crust"" pizza, so perhaps that is what they are referring to. There are no red pepper flakes on the tables, which is unfortunate because I love red pepper on my pizza (you may argue that it's because it isn't ""authentic"" Italian, but they do have salt and pepper and processed powdered parmesan cheese, so I don't think whole red pepper flakes would hurt their rep). 

Maybe I am just not a fast-fire pizza kinda gal, or maybe I was so distracted by the shirtless kid running around the place unsupervised (admittedly not the restaurant's fault entirely), or maybe I was so thrown off by the ordering process, but I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,7,4,2,GpNnV4EI7wMgITN0GKyxmg
