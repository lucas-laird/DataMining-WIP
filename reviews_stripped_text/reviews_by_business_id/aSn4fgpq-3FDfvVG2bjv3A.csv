The biscuits are hard 50% of the time. I usually get the chicken strip box, don't really care that it's a little more than the national advertisement of $5. The strips have been so hard that I can't even take a bite, let alone chew them, this didn't happen just once, but several times (you would think I would stop going). The service is usually decent, nothing to rave about, typical employees that don't seem to enjoy their jobs. The part that really pisses me off is the sauce, one sauce for 3 chicken strips. I ask for another and they charge me for it. They also stopped serving the Finger Lickin Good sauce, which was the main reason for my choice of chicken. Twice I was given food without a receipt and when I tried calling, no one answers. I fill out the surveys when I do get a receipt, but honestly, I don't think anyone from corporate cares.

3923445,2013-06-30,1,aSn4fgpq-3FDfvVG2bjv3A,"KFC is a guilty pleasure I enjoy from time to time, and a coworker had a coupon for a discount on their new boneless chicken so we decided to go try it out.

When we handed the coupon to the cashier, the store manager who was in the back told her not to honor it. I asked why not, and the store manager got an attitude and declared that his franchise chooses not to honor most coupons and that, actually, they don't have to honor any coupons at all. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by his off-putting and dismissive attitude towards a customer! When I asked what KFCs here aren't run by his franchise, he smirked and said, ""We run all the KFCs in Nevada and Arizona, so you don't have a choice"".

Look, I respect individual franchisees' decisions to assess their economic situations independently and not take certain coupons. But if they do that, they should be respectful to their customers and simply apologize - not be smug and condescending. And anyway, the store manager was wrong - I do have a choice, and that's not to patronize KFC whenever I'm in Vegas.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,6,0,1,T4YvWkQDrpRGbq5k3r_qjg

The squirrelly looking manager doesn't know how to run a business. He rudely came up to the cashier and told him to stop taking orders. He walked past him and said something smart to him again. Will not be coming back here. Learn how to run a business and fire the night time manager. How dare he talk like that to employees. I finally got my food 17 minutes later.

This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.

My meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location.",v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ,2,0,1,2L0ahz0ZQecNd1Ns5HkKag

I said hello to make sure the machine wasnt broken.  The lady goes WAIT(in a super rude way).
I just left...  
all the other drive thrus always responded  to me at least.

The cashier went in the back kitchen to check on Supply after I chimed in that I wanted a 20 piece bucket also. He came back and informed the people in front of me that they could only have a 10 piece bucket because they had no more.  They wouldn't have anymore for approximately a half hour if they wanted to wait.  They took 10 pieces. I asked the cashier if they were really out of ALL styles of KFC chicken and he said yes. I asked him why they had no chicken ready at dinner hour. His reply was ""I don't know but you can wait about a half hour for it."" I said that if they really have no chicken ready at dinner hour their store was in real trouble and that they should get going and fill up. We walked out and picked up Chinese food. Made fresh and quick. Maybe one more chance for these guys or El Pollo Loco or Popeye's or Church's. So on 5/1/18 we call this store's phone number that was listed on Google Maps and get an obnoxious girl making sexually explicit comments.  We hang up and look up your Spring Mtn location through YELP, call that different number and after 20+ rings, no answer so we hang up. I WAS going to tell them about the incorrect listing in GOOGLE MAPS but hey, they can't even answer the phone. So guess what?  POPEYE'S it is.

KFC's food will always be bomb so we already know this isn't a complaint about the food. 
Whomever is the franchise owner I hope they see this. Cashier we had was great, he was friendly, good at multitasking (he helped me get to the bathroom while my husband and kids was ordering) by the time I came back my husband was pissed off and everyone else seemed like they were walking on eggs. OKAY? Why? Found out that the manager there had lost his mind because he acted like he had no manager experience. It's upsetting to hear that a manager would speak to his employee in a demeaning way. Apparently my husband had given a 100 bill and they had no change. Upon request from the cashier to manager he had said ""WE DONT HAVE FUCKING CHANGE FOR A 100 I DONT KNOW WHY YOU FUCKING TOOK THAT FROM HIM"" 

How rude can you be? Seriously? Where did you get your managing experience from? 

I will never support a business, that has no respect for their employees. And that darn manager had no gloves! And he was working with food!!!",ojT9F7EuGFvuxvnUmtgEWQ,2,0,1,5t6Hupji0mj63sgi367Lvg
