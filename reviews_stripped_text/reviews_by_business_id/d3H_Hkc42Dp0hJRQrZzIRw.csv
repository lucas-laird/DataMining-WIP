My mom got the chicken Schwarma which was also delicious. I don't eat meat but the small bite I had of it was very spicy, which I love, but for those not as tolerant to heat, it may be too hot. Overall DEFINITELY recommend if you're on the strip.",VYzhiMeevpESvu6Q4x2VJg,0,0,5,1FbapwISbkQcfn89OxLyfw

I had wanted to get dinner but not spend too much money. My friends wanted to try Taco Bell Cantina but considering that I had already gotten food from there already and tried it before, I wanted something other than that because I know I could get Taco Bell back home in California.

I came by here seeing that it was one dollar sign and I was lowkey craving Mediterranean food.
Food: Food was really yummy. I got the regular beef gyro and it was moderately sized. Full of flavor. The only thing that was a turn off was that it was $9 for one gyro. Kind of expensive, but I was okay with it. Someone else might not be.

Service: Service was mediocre, the African American man that works there was the only one at the time. He seemed busy but nonetheless, he wasn't very friendly or helpful. I asked what was the most popular thing to get and I got an ""idk"" as a response. You have like 7 things on the menu and you don't know what the most popular is? I mean I guess! lol

Overall, it was a quick bite to eat but not very much of a good experience. Will probably try other foods in the area instead.",1sc1zuaLiQVnZSR2SOILiw,0,0,3,G57NRL0B9ZeLkqzDnxOz6w
1583169,2017-07-17,0,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,"This place came in handy while in Vegas with being on a very strict budget this recent visit. Pita is a nice little spot along the strip if you want some quick and cheap to eat. No it isn't a grand 4 course meal or even the best of fast food but it does its justice. Being that I'm a gyro fan had a gyro here that was fairly inexpensive and it was filling enough to hold me down and kind to my pockets...lol. Very appreciative of spots like this, especially in a place where money can go fairly quick in Vegas.",HXZox6rnDegmnC_t0dJdmQ,0,0,3,VZlDvh2ajMcafs5U219QwA

2440219,2017-07-06,0,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,The food was fresh. They were out of falafel tonight so the owner made me a vegetarian gyro. I enjoyed it. It's very quaint and has the New York street vibes. The owner was so nice. Definitely a great place to visit. A beautiful authentic feel,buwKJSGmZyYtLNsjrg16YQ,0,0,5,X-OYkjZuxCetchkCWlksaw

3108050,2017-11-07,0,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,"We were just getting hungry when we saw Pita+ from across the street.  Not wanting to spend lots of money on typical Vegas food, we decided to stop in here and see what it was all about. The owner was super friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma pita wrap and my husband tried the falafel wrap. The chicken wrap was definitely better than the falafel.  It's a small place with not many tables but I'd recommend it for a lunch around $10.",iipaDtoA1zHFkbAF3Gn5Rg,2,1,3,v2ZmfjNQPc63_mgGK1E-rg

My friends had the falafel, I had the Philly cheesesteak which was pretty good. I like how the cashier toast the bread on this press machine which gives it a good taste. Good spot for a quick meal.",lcADq2VWWnLnR7_not6DnA,0,0,4,Xbt7RpdU_2XFrXKrkagYZA
3871814,2017-10-30,0,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,"I ordered the beef shawarma. I should have known better when I didn't see the meat cooking on the spit. It was real thin meat, tasted like it was seasoned with taco bell seasoning. The pita was basically a slightly thicker tortilla. ""shawarma sauce"" was an OK tasting tziki sauce. By far the worst shawarma I've ever had. None of the usual toppings offered. Not even tahini. Just pickle spears, sliced tomato and tziki.",hdngk9bWQUnMMccI9aIdMA,0,0,1,NMRlCIRWZhjX7c0JtGgYQA
4460097,2017-03-10,0,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,I understand location can make prices higher then normal but with that comes a bit of a higher standard for ingredients. Ingredients were lackluster and you can get fluffier pita bread and thicker cuts of meat at Winco.,sYSRSJVuZcLEM-_kQfIRNw,0,0,2,jq9v23cU-rY41RXtm7aC_Q
4544656,2015-10-01,29,d3H_Hkc42Dp0hJRQrZzIRw,"This spot is definitely easy to miss if you are not searching for it. Hidden gem right on the strip and the price is reasonable!

I found out about this spot as I was walking back to my room. ""One of those drunken nights""..Yup you guessed it. Before heading to the hotel I needed to eat something after all the drinking I had don't that day. I found Pita + and I have to admit there are the BEST thing on the strip! Everything is under $10 can you believe that!

We were helped by Katrina who is probably one of the nicest and most helpful employees that I have come across in a long time. She was personable and made every attempt to make sure that every customer was taken care of. Even went above and beyond normal requests. If the owner is reading this, I highly suggest taking care of her as an employee she makes your business better. Food was great as well.",lqgxCjMLuark6N_LLQffRw,1,0,5,ox_2N2MbdGc8B8gcLX5pOA

We noticed Pita+ as we were walking along, and decided to give it a shot. I got a philly cheesesteak wrap, and my wife got the chicken shawarma. Our food was made on the spot, was flavorful, and much better than expected! With chips and a drink, you're gonna pay about $12. They also had hot dogs, gyros and a couple other items on the menu. This place is very small, but if you are walking around the Harmon area, I would definitely recommend!",iS2zfKC-am-hyH4j4t-HOg,1,0,5,S9a1VDT6pfuwwBoWgfCYJA
