Despite my attempts to communicate she got rude and didn't seem to care about helping inform us more on their menu, let alone could she answer any question I had about what specific items they have for meat combinations. Lost my business before I could even try the food - bad service, incompetent workers, and no adequate / detailed online menu.",Iil0I9h2gNq09j-BGBz5oA,2,0,1,eiEUqxBOfIbZ8D0LFzI_bg

My family and I came in after a very long hard day of going to work clocking out coming home cleaning going to take our son to the doctor and then we were so hungry we just went into Lulu's Hawaiian BBQ. So we looked raggedy and our son was snotty and sick and coughing was just terrible. But they made us feel so welcome and they gave us great customer service. The woman who took her order was so kind to my children and the cook was really nice also. I was just really shocked at how amazing their customer service was I feel like customer service is kind of leaving. Anywho their food is really good we ordered the chicken that has the panko  on it with the curry sauce can we say amazing the chicken was so juicy but still was crispy since it was deep fried with panko. My daughter had the soup with chicken it was a hefty Hefty Bowl for 495 my husband had the like double meal or something like that he also got the panko chicken with the Korean BBQ Beef I think and it was amazing we also got some lumpia fresh it was amazing and we got pot stickers and they were extra special as well.


My review was kind of off I'm really tired but I just wanted everyone to know that this restaurant is absolutely the best I'm completely in love with it and I know you will be too if you enjoy good food and awesome customer service",fjWWs7XMZ-G4hg9kGS1zSQ,1,0,5,20XQQyIP9KRlcZso85fSvQ

1372313,2017-08-19,1,bOddIZaNIQAYju-EgYBuIA,"LuLu is definitely similar to L&L and Ohana Hawaiian BBQ. Expect the usual Hawaiian plate lunches with white rice, mac salad and your choice of protein.

One thing that sets LuLu apart is that if you're dining in, they'll typically serve you and you pay after your meal rather than ordering up at the counter and paying upfront. It's a little difference that I appreciate especially since they're friendly and attentive.

The dishes are delicious but my absolute favorite would have to be Honey Chicken Katsu! Crispy fried chicken pieces drenched in sweet honey sauce. It tastes like the Honey Walnut Shrimp sauce. It's so good, trust me. Genius, actually. I don't think I've seen anyone else combine that honey sauce with chicken katsu.

I used to go to LuLu in the North side so I was stoked to find out they opened one fairly close to me. Welcome to this side of town, LuLu! See you real soon.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,1,1,4,00wtbU7bFQo6mV_PKq0Beg

I tried a combo plate with a side of poki for a takeout lunch. Plate size was large, with a generous portion of protein. I liked the flavors and appreciated that the teri sauce wasn't too sweet, but the chicken had an odd, thick skin I didn't care for and the $6.50 poki side was the size of a condiment cup.

I went in, not really having much expectation. The gal behind the counter was not friendly. I wouldn't say rude, but she definitely didn't want to be at work that day. 

The place was clean, but had an... off... smell to it. That should have been my first clue. 

We ordered the ribs place (our go-to) and I ordered the chicken Katsu as well. I took the order to go, as we didn't live that far away. 

The food was still warm/hot by the time I got home. We pulled everything out and... no. Just. NO. 

The meat plate (Kalbi ribs) were so off-putting we couldn't bring ourselves to eat it. My 15 month old, who LOVES Kalbi, wouldn't even touch it. The Katsu had good crisp breading, but the sauce was not right. Something about it, just didn't taste good, and I couldn't figure it out.

I ordered the bbq mix plate to go. The mix plate has short ribs, teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken. I didn't care for any of it because it was all fatty and stringy. Even the chicken had a thick layer of skin which I found odd. The mac salad was tasty but this place isn't any better than it's competitors.

Editied to add - they offer delivery which is pretty cool. And they have honey chicken katsu. Like the sauce that comes on honey walnut shrimp, but instead on katsu. Sounds interesting and I must try. I will be back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,1,3,t-N-BwhSt5cUhXeDOqAFGQ

Hey though! They have saimin noodle soup. I love saimin! It's comfy for colds. I remember that was the first time I ate here. Not all places serve saimin.

I did try the Thai tea and when I didn't like it they let me change it out for something else with no charge.   I don't know the women's name that has taken our order all three times but she is very sweet.  I hope they stay open!",EoHdx-byYkY0X3low3-Rgg,1,0,5,MUXew0f6RLH9gIXwpSlfWQ

If I have to rate the service on how friendly everyone is behind the counter, i definitely rate it 4 out of 5 stars but I'm here to review the food and unfortunately I have to rate it a 1 or less out of 5 stars. The Loco Moco was horrible, the patty is from a cheap frozen dinner, the only good thing about it was the egg, the price was higher than other better restaurant I've been to before. The Saimin soup wasn't impressive either. 

This is a new and young restaurant, I do hope thay make some improvement. I sure am coming back because of the service and give this place a second chance maybe in a month or two.",WPdKJcx98k2_ZECXag1Qlw,4,0,1,GGQmXz4iZAOYj_iIsYd_AA
5381849,2017-06-23,0,bOddIZaNIQAYju-EgYBuIA,Yum. First time. Very good seafood platter with lots of pieces. The fried shrimp are delicious and the breading on the fish and scallops was not a bit greasy and cooked perfectly .Two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad came with the dish. There was enough to take home for another meal. The lovely young lady behind the counter was very pleasant and helpful.  Will come back and try another dish for sure.,QQgdS8xwFcgKFmCBzZtmdA,0,1,5,Z_jfGRt4sng-Qwtceo2GMQ

5886172,2018-05-25,0,bOddIZaNIQAYju-EgYBuIA,"We had ordered 1 chicken katsu plate, 2 loco moco plates, and 12 piece wonton. 

Bc of the pictures I saw posted here I told my husband we MUST try their chicken katsu! We are from Hawaii n this is exactly how chicken katsu is supposed to look lol. We did a phone order n the lady said it'd be ready in about 10 minutes. My husband went n it really was fast, he said the shop was pretty empty. When we opened our plates, it was just mouth watering! Their portions are worth it! The katsu sauce was very watery tho. Good but watery. I'm use to katsu sauce thick n that's how I make my own as well. My husband loved the loco plate n so did my kids! Wonton my kids didn't like so much. But other than that I think they did a pretty good job at local food. I wish the chicken from the chicken katsu was thicker, kinda looked like majority of the chicken katsu was just me eating panko. 


Now for the Mac salad! My husband loves Mac n Mayo. But for him to have said it was too much mayo said a lot lol. I am not a fan of mayo at all so each bite I took with rice n chicken I ate ONE piece of macaroni from the salad lol.",UCpNBr3pKF1OqdBmVzjjLw,0,0,4,tFzuhGp0oPeXLqbLWtaX5A
