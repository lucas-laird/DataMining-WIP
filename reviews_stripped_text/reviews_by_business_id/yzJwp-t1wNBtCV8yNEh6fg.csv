84053,2012-04-21,0,yzJwp-t1wNBtCV8yNEh6fg,Server was funny and very adamant about the food. We ordered the 2 piece fried chicken with granny's cabbage and gravy w/rice. Fried chicken is made to order so expect to wait 20-25 mins for them BUT it is WORTH it! Gravy was very yummy too. The owner comes around each table and introduces herself and asks how we found out about the restaurant..yelp of course! We ended our meal with just-out-the-oven peach cobbler...lunch at Granny's was very enjoyable and we will be back!,ly2PHxuhklRek7hL9MJrTg,0,0,5,pxMfSaDftcREBNTi2b8Oiw

Carey was kind enough to bring us out some rib tips try. He makes his own rub and serves with sauce for you to decide. Great idea!  

Tip - if you order the fried chicken - they make it to order. It will not be ready in 5 minutes (closer to 20) but is wort the wait!!",La7fIJged51r2ZqHYTaUtg,1,2,5,abJo9KoGfGWXoLat3pfu9w

Granny's Kitchen Soul Food truck offers customers a friendly greeting, a helpful staff, but bland food.

Granny's seems to be offering soul food cooked a little healthier than traditional methods (greens cooked in broths and not pork fat).  Long term, my heart will be thankful for the healthy efforts of Granny's Kitchen.  Short term, the food was bland.  

The Catfish is was flavorless frozen fish in a bland cornmeal breading.  The fish came out tough, not tender and I had to douse the dish in hot sauce to make it edible.  The side dish of beans was similarly bad.  The beans were super-sugary with some ground beef mixed in, but all I could taste was sweetener.  The beans and beef were drowned out.

That said, the cook and customer service were really friendly.  While I was there they went out of their way to help several customers work their way through the menu and made recommendations for folks wanting to try out soul food for the first time.  I commend them for the friendliness, but just can't stand behind the food.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,0,1,s88lRfZ8fNdnKj6A_xG5lQ

Good attitude...family atmosphere...the BEST eggs I have ever had...the waffles and biscuits were the absolute best have ever eaten without anything on them...clean clean clean...and reasonable prices.  They have blackeye peas and collard greens too!  Yay Vegas!,fzOkbpTjQm6CiMuQmLm2Xw,3,3,5,YblHGf880S-L5d0XYvWTsQ

The best soul food and southern hospitality in Las Vegas by far. We had great catfish again, pork chops cooked seasoned and cooked perfect, baked chicken had tons of flavor. Finished with great peach cobbler. Thank you Granny's for a little taste of home.",fVN_EC2NUT-E_2i7XgQB0Q,1,1,5,QYuaEaYx2BxHrDfEfAhmAA

The place is falling down on it housekeeping, the floors when you first walked in were filthy look like they hadn't been mopped in weeks. The Coup De Gr-as what is the female bathroom, there was feces on the toilet seat the floors were filthy the trash needed to be emptied. Totally lost my appetite. I will be making a call to the Health Department on Monday! I will never return here again, because if this is the way the place is being kept I do not want to see the kitchen.",QLwn2nZBPeENK1L9GMSOfw,2,0,1,m0eX7dWE9bGRnDNfGWTjMA
