1192028,2017-05-31,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,Way overpriced!!!  I don't know why I should have to pay over $10+ for a sub just because it is a hole in the wall in a hotel.,8Zq8WkDvuO8GpLaU0wY1fA,0,0,1,J8tD1PscbyNZcqXHxnR6Ig
1254615,2015-08-09,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,This place was gross. The smell in the air was of wet dog and puke. I didn't even want to eat here but my best friend John Tip was starving. He paid for my meal but I was sick with worry. I would never eat here again. The service was poor and the food looked old and dry. The bread was stale. There is no Key.,zHjIMyyKIHYiue6WRSZrHg,0,0,1,QS8H6sl3TVOMBoS9U0TU6Q
1325711,2015-03-29,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"I thought i had written a review for this location on a previous visit to the Plaza but i guess not. I love the Plaza hotel located in downtown Vegas, hate this Subway. This was our 2nd time getting food here only because one of my daughters loves Subway and just cant wait until we get back home, shes the only one eatin here i refuse to pay $7 for a 6inch or $10footlong and thats just the sandwich add $3 to make it a combo, crazy. This place is so high, no deals like we have at home, i dont know if its because theyre inside a hotel or what and the customer service is so bad. The 2 times we've been here the people working behind the counter are playing with workers on the other side. Too laid back for me when it comes to my food i dont like ppl playing over it. My daughter needs to take a lesson from me on this and maybe her ass wouldnt get sick as much as she does from eatin out. If your craving a sandwich go to Cafe Latte located at the entrance of the hotel near registration great fresh food and customer service.",JZAcsMtcALSYw3YVVJ272w,3,0,1,obxi6qZ3Dd261lCTYZF1Mg
1499665,2017-07-28,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"24 hours so open for the late night munchies, however, it doesn't honor any Subway promotions or coupons so, your $5 foot long will cost around $12 bucks.",VXsZzOAK1neWLWkELwqfDA,0,0,3,rowJMUI5t2PFzzOrr60FfQ
1799009,2016-08-15,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"This particular store is located inside the Plaza Hotel & Casino. During my 4-day stay so far, I have been very pleased overall. Their employees have outstanding customer service skills & are efficient in their work habits. Although the prices on their items may be a bit higher than a typical franchise location, the product is excellent. 

Furthermore, the employees at the Plaza Hotel Subway are very organized with each of their items, food & condiments. Since I have been short on cash overall, I have been able to fill out surveys from the receipts which reward you with a free cookie. This Subway location had no problem in allowing that. 

Oh yeah, and they're open 24/7!  The one knock I have on them is that the inside could be more spacious, but otherwise the store does the best with everything they have. I sincerely don't mind eating each of my meals here",8udRRWEWeSwsxpbjeXylyw,0,0,5,Vx_6p-wEJhWSu39FN_uS-A
3376464,2017-12-17,1,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"$16.35 for ONE FREEKING sandwich! Get the he-- outta here with that bs! I literally thought that she rang up TWO sandwiches but no, it was no mistake!! I couldn't believe it. I could've went to an ACTUAL restaurant for that price! I was ""expecting"" to get an affordable meal since this is fast food. Every other subway in the US charges $5-$10 for a 12"" sandwich. The cashier told me their prices are higher because they are in a casino/hotel. LOL WHAAATEVER. Talk about taking advantage of customers! I shouldn't have even paid for the da-- sandwich. DO NOT EAT HERE!!",OJKwPoOghX_MDdtfOAWZzQ,0,0,1,LTgtRtqQ3wgT53MVSH85ww
4326444,2016-06-25,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"Great service but I just cant help but lose my appetite when a homeless transient is next to me. The smell just makes me lose my appetite. I understand they have a right to be there, but surely there is a policy regarding smelling up the place. 
The server was very polite and took my order promptly. The food was OK. By the time I ate it was all soggy.",MEBWqqaUOnxVLjvEcNZJWA,0,0,2,-sosyJRFJnJo5dQjUaTwzA

5549731,2018-05-06,1,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I have NEVER felt so disrespected in my entire life. Full disclosure: My entire group was not drinking. We stayed at the Plaza Hotel, and needed to get some food for the road. A few of us decided to get subway. I was super excited when I saw that they had a vegetarian option for me. I was trying to ask the worker if the patty was good but she could care less about helping me. She informed me that ""that isn't her area"" so I asked her if i was able to try a tiny bit before ordering it. I was informed by Carmen Perez, who was working the register, that I couldn't. I was totally fine with that and completely understood. But I decided not to get anything, because it genuinely felt like they could care less about giving me service. My friends and boyfriend still got sandwiches. While they were filling up their sodas, we heard Carmen say that I was a ""F*** Bi**"". We turned around, in shock. My boyfriend and friends told her that she was rude and that her behavior is unacceptable. I asked for both workers names and informed them that I would be writing a review and calling corporate. Carmen continued to be blatantly rude (while helping a customer) and she was yelling that we are liars. I was so upset that I couldn't stop shaking. I wish that we would have brought our money and business elsewhere. I hope that if Subway cares about their customers, they will do something about this.",MoeYFuyq7tlB2TWYI6lwzw,0,0,1,pzCr0mbaWGxhex6RgTWB9A
5589248,2016-01-09,0,oupRStsBHVRsxhrEm8-DgA,"This subway is in the hotel of the Plaza

24 hour subway and better than the other gross subway that's located on Fremont.

Come to this one.
I've been coming here for 11 years.

After a long day of walking / gambling, this is some great comfort food and the customer service has always been great to me. 

Hopefully this review doesn't jinx it LOL",9b3wjhUCu1a7vCAu14Hk3Q,0,0,5,Ih_a9KvqR_D8Mh5mA_XrQA
