23655,2017-10-06,0,NnoJ7MBgV_F-bv7FA_X_BA,This place is amazing I fell in love with the Gordon burrito this is my first time coming to Vegas and I wanted something good I saw it and said why not and the delivery guy was nice and as soon as I took a bite of the burrito I fell in love. It's amazing and I would recommend it to anyone and plus it's not an average burrito. It's a huge burrito and it's amazing especially the horchata. I would definitely order this again over and over.,7dpExzL6J7DFxOMqOlRpyg,0,0,5,pwO3RjIB8aWhjgotEVM_rg

I ordered a shrimp burrito, & and a side of French fries. The French fries were seasoned perfectly and were very crispy. The burrito was just a mess. First off, the burrito had so much onion it was nearly impossible to pick it all off. Secondly, the burrito barely had any flavor all I could mildly taste was ""salsa el pato"" (that red sauce people use for cooking). Every bite of the burrito consisted of onion, cheese, some sauce, & a random piece of green bell pepper. Very disappointing experience with the burrito overall.

I had to put my cheese enchilada combo in the microwave before I could eat it. The raspberry tea which I always order was too sweet this time. My hard tacos were ok, but the pico de gallo (that I paid extra for) didn't look fresh. I paid 75¢ for about 2-3 tbs of guacamole. I think it should be free for that size.

The food is always consistent and the flavor - so comforting.

If your in the mood for some Mexican fare, you may want to consider ordered or eating thier restaurant.

They also serve American food like burgers and such (I'm a huge burger fan) but, it's the Mexican food that I am drawn too.

Delivery can be as soon as 30 minutes to an hour, but it is so well satisfying!

Slowly, other mom and pops proliferated and food trucks began popping up all over town.  But it can be difficult to know at a glance as you drive by whether these places are serving slop or not.  Rest assured, Los Huicholes is a cut above all of them.

Everything I've tried here has been high quality, from the various meats and wonderful seasoning to something as simple as a side salad that looks like it was prepped by a chef.  Nothing ever seems overcooked, old, or derived from poor quality ingredients.  In fact, their sopes seem to be homemade, not store bought.  And the little breads that come as a side are as tasty as a fresh bakery product.  The only thing I've been disappointed with has been their hard shell taco - it's smallish, not fried, and they skimp on the cheese.  Otherwise, everything here - including the staples of beans and rice - taste better than  any other similar mexican restaurant I've tried in town.  Try it!

3922857,2015-09-22,0,NnoJ7MBgV_F-bv7FA_X_BA,"This is a small unpretentious hole in the wall restaurant with wonderful food. I have lived in the downtown area for several decades and have seen places similar to this pop up and then fade away. I hope that it will establish enough of a following to last, so encourage anyone living or working in the area to give it a try. Expect moderate portions of well-prepared food always made with fresh high quality ingredients. We have ordered take-out online almost a dozen times, and never been disappointed. It is notable that the vegetarian items are exactly that; flavorful beans are made with canola oil NOT lard. Cheese is used with appropriate moderation. I  recommend enchiladas with either the red or house creamy green sauce, nachos, tostada salad, taquitos,etc. and anything with guacamole. It is an ultra-fresh chunky mildly seasoned with the usual tomato,onion and cilantro, never too salty, dollop of goodness. I have reservations about recommending the chile relleno, as it is far from the traditional expectation. It is strips of green chile and cheese in an eggy crepe-like rectangle drizzled with the house creamy green sauce. We jokingly call it the green chile cheese omelet, but like it well enough order the relleno/enchilada combo often. The large menu also offers a lot of American sandwiches, burgers, chicken, salads.

Update 4/8. Tried a carne asada burrito and it seems they like to use a lot of filler. Rice and beans do not belong in a carne asada burrito! Not much meat so that's a little disappointing. Good flavor and quick service tho...

I ordered the Asada fries. $9 isn't too shabby for a messy pile of yumminess so I went with it. Plus a $3 delivery charge. Plus a tip. I gave specific instructions on how to get into the building, and where to meet me. I paid before my food was delivered with a card - first mistake. 

The delivery man called me - as requested - stating he was at my location. I looked for him on my floor. Nothing. Then he told me ""oh, I'm in the lobby - I won't come up to your floor - I'm too busy."" Ummmm... Ok? I gave a hefty tip for you to BRING ME the food I ordered. Nearly 100% of my tab! 

So I go to the lobby to pick up my own food. The delivery man said he was busy, and didn't want to go through the scanners. Ok. At least TELL someone that beforehand. Customer service. You know, making sure the customer is happy? Apparently customer service must be dead... Right along with chivalry.

Get back to my office, and my order is wrong - I received nachos, not Asada fries. *sigh*
