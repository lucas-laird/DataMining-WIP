As I normally do multiple times a week I order out via Grub Hub because I'm a single woman and it's easy and convenient to just get delivery. Mind you, I did read reviews before ordering from this restaurant (if you want to call it that) so I was aware of certain potential issues before placing my order. I did note the estimated delivery time (no biggie). Well, that time came and went. I chatted with grubhub (twice) trying to figure out why I hadn't received my order yet so GH called and reached out to the restaurant and they claimed 15 minutes more. After waiting longer than 15 minutes more I wrote back asking to be refunded/canceled but the GH chat agent insisted on contacting the restaurant once again. Only after my 2nd interaction with the GH chat support did I get a call from a female (I'm guessing she was the driver) who said she would be there in 5 minutes. Another 15 or so minutes passed before she knocked on my door. A moment prior to her arriving I was leaving my review on GH. at this point I waited 15 minutes shy of 3 hours (from placing order to receiving it) to receive my order. I was able to bite into the food as I was leaving my review and did mention the fries were stale/soggy and that the burger was ""ok"". Although the cab of Pepsi was killer.Now, in all honesty it was disgusting. But I didn't eat all day so I'm sure anything would've tasted ""ok"" at that point. The biggest disappointment was their response to my review saying that my order was not 3 hours late (which I have proof and my account clearly shows when I placed the order) and that the restaurant called me twice to inform me they were busy which 1. Never happened (they did not contact me) and 2. It was I, the customer who contacted grubhub who reached out to them to find out where my order was. Something else I noticed is there really rude replies to negative reviews. First impression is everything and they can definitely take a lesson in etequitte. My advice to them would be to not bite the hand that feeds you. Without customers there would be no you. All in all, I would've had a better experience eating cubes of salt and toilet paper.",m7Dv6swvWo0VGd8WvY0DVg,2,1,1,OTSfxFBeBnO-u7dtdLqMpg
4068939,2017-04-09,0,CqxDQPhltNo6wkkCWww80Q,"Hm. So I've never heard of this place. I was browsing through eat24 and Moe's showed up on the list of nearby restaurants that delivered. What caught my eye was what type of food they prepared. Eat24 currently lists: Burgers, American, Late Night, Chicken and Waffles, Dessert. I read Chicken and Waffles and immediately craved it. Also delivering and open till 2:30am? Although there are/were no reviews (as of right now), I went ahead and ordered 2, one for me and my mother.

Delivery was estimated to be 45-60 minutes, nothing out of the ordinary. The driver took a little under 2 hours to arrive at my door step. I did call beforehand why it's been over an hour and they said they were busy, no problem. The driver looked like she was in a rush and she also delivered the food in an UberEATS bag. Is that normal? Still tipped her 20%.

Two different to-go style boxes, the typical styrofoam ""have a nice day"" box and the other a clear, plastic style. The food was wrapped in tin foil, good way to seal the warmth. I opened the food and was thinking, ""wow"", and not in the good way either. The Waffle didn't look or taste homemade, It was like the frozen kind that you stick in an oven. The chicken in my plate were pretty much in the same category, the stuff you buy in bags down the frozen foods aisle.

My Mother's chicken on the other hand were chicken strips, while mine were like chicken poppers. The syrup was okay, no complaints and beneath the waffle was butter, all melted. Perhaps the driver got lost on the way to the house? Or maybe they ran out of chicken and had to buy some from the store. I don't know. Either way, I've definitely tasted a better chicken and waffles. Very disappointed, nowhere near worth 13 bucks a plate.",97qEu_8WUPsAvpOINUvoEA,9,0,1,T_JukG-Nj_qwD-GoqOrP9Q
