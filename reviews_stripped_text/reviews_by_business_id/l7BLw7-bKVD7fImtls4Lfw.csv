The entire menu is outstanding and very affordable. The people are great, very comfortable, homely atmosphere, very welcoming. Soups, tacos, gorditas, huarache, tortas, flan....everything here is great. Highly recommended.

Everything that I've had here has been great but so far my favorite bites have been the enchiladas Pollo De Mole and consomme loco.

The enchiladas pack a punch of flavor with the mole and the consomme loco is just a great example of less is more.",xR-QCGdqlcUqrGIxExs_lA,0,0,5,W7BIsMpuS3yGJAv-NJ2ZWA

                  CONSOMMÉ LOCO

Consommé is a clarified chicken stock. And theirs is a complex concoction served with chicken pieces (white meat only), rice, cilantro, onion, and avocado. And I add a few hearty squeezes of lime for good measure.  It's soulful and simple and demands attention.  

I always get the soup and a carne asada quesadilla. The deed fried quesadilla is always perfectly seasoned and crisp. The gooey cheese and crispy pocket puts those (healthier, lighter) quesadilla to shame. 

Aside from that amazing soup and the delicious quesadillas, they are one of the few places that has a deeply interesting and flavorful sauce on their chilaquiles.  

I've tried their tacos and a few other plates and been satisfied. Not overwhelmed, but satisfied. I would not recommend their tacos when there are so many other great things to try at Antojos. 

That said, I have such respect for the consistency and quality of the food coming out of this place. I'm always surprised that they are not more crowded. Oh, there won't be many open tables when you get there for lunch, but you'll order and be served very quickly.

1232014,2014-01-11,0,l7BLw7-bKVD7fImtls4Lfw,"I first encountered cochinita pibil at the Taco Bus in Tampa, Florida, and I've been searching for it ever since. Although there is a version of it at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay, I wanted something a little less upscale, and when I read about Los Antojos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it.

My husband loves cochinita pibil even more than I do, so he ordered the plate lunch. For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas. I had two cochinita pibil tacos, which were like the small street fare I expected; and a small bowl of the consomme loco, which is a simple chicken, rice, and cilantro soup topped with avocado. Although the soup was tasty, next time I think I'll stick with the tacos, and maybe try one of the others listed on the menu -- the ham and pineapple (jamón y piña) sounds intriguing.

The restaurant itself doesn't look much different from the dozens of similar strip-mall establishments located throughout the city, but the variety of menu options -- especially the inclusion of the aforementioned cochinita pibil (did I say how much I love it?) -- make this ""hole in the wall"" one worth visiting.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,4,jC5ihkE-8sS_fxQLcNP1qQ

  i took my mom here and we ordered two tacos and the highly recommended consomme loco (i got a junior size).  all together it costed around 6 dollars and some change.. so that wasn't that bad.  the tacos were the size of a toddler's hands (super tiny) and according to my mom, they were nothing special.  the consomme loco came in a medium sized bowl with pieces of cilantro and onion floating around.  there was shredded chicken and mexican rice in the bottom of the clear broth.  now lets talk about the taste.. it tasted almost exactly like slightly watered down chicken flavored top ramen.  i don't know if it's that top ramen is really good, or this soup is really bad but i didn't really think it was as good as other people said it was.  after eating that soup, i'm left with a really dry and thirsty taste in my mouth.  even though i got the junior size bowl, it was actually really filling and i had to force myself to spoon down the last few drops.  for filling me up, i'll give it another star.  

overall, the food wasn't great but at least it wasn't nasty.. i grew up with a lot of mexican friends whose mothers made delicious soup for us all the time, so that's what i was expecting when i came here.  it's not a place i would come to again.

1836999,2014-04-24,3,l7BLw7-bKVD7fImtls4Lfw,"Bookmarked this place after seeing their PAMAZO TORTA listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out.

I ordered the torta and a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review. The quesadilla is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back.

But back to that torta. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy with grease to the point that it was difficult to eat. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor.  I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish.

2237208,2009-11-07,0,l7BLw7-bKVD7fImtls4Lfw,"After hearing about this place on KNPR I decided to come down, with my best Mexican friend in tote (just in case I needed translation on the menu), to try this place out.  I do not recommend using Google maps to locate this place, instead look out for it on the southeast corner of Sahara and Eastern.  Upon arriving, it does not look like much, and at first glace I thought I had arrived upon a venue that did not sell food at all, but after reading the words ""taco"" and ""enchilada"" written on the glass window, I breathed a sigh of relief.  We entered and saw the crammed 9 table (plus bar top seating on the side) seating area with a counter top right behind.  After trying my best to decipher the Spanish on the menu (with the help of my friend), I settled on the chicken mole enchilada (~$8) and the tortilla sopa (~$5).  My friend, who had also brought her roommate, got the milanesa (~$10) and the chicken flautas (~$8).  After ordering we sat at one of the tables stuffed in the corner to await our meal.  On the table was an open container with what appeared to be some type of hot sauce, typical of Mexico City style fare, according to my friend.  Our meal arrived complete with rice, beans, and a few tortilla chips right on the plate.  My mole, which can be explained as a curry-like sauce containing chocolate, was rich, sweet and savory.  I tried some of the flautas, topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and queso.  Crispy on the outside with soft, juicy chicken on the inside.  The milanesa, according to my friend was good too.  The tortilla sopa was savory and sour from the lime and sour cream.  Definitely a must try.  The questionable sauce in the open dish was, in-fact, hot sauce, chipotle hot sauce to be exact.   All in all I gave this place 5 stars because the price is decent, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  I will definitely come here again, possibly to try out the other goodies on the menu.  I recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous and loves good Mexican food at decent prices.  This is not a place for those who are expecting a fine-dining, or even a Chili's-style dining experience, nor the obsessive compulsive clean.

The above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.

The excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though. 

Given the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu. Not sure I will be back to try another.

Words are not enough to describe this mole. Nothing can suffice. You can't go to Leticia's, Lindo Michoacan, nor Viva Zapata's and get this quality of mole.

Their chicken enchiladas came with mole. I have had many great moles. This mole was not a great one. It was a good one.

The animal fat would serve as the grease for the backdrop of flavorful meat for each taco. The toppings such as cilantro and onions were finely finely chopped. The grill that they used were the ones similar to the ones being used at Tacos El Gordo, even though TEG is Tijuanan style.

At Los Antojos, I feel that the execution of the food could have been so much better and reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Yes, perhaps some may say that I'm harsh, but if they advertise a regional food, and certain people go there for that regional food, that food should reach or exceed the standards. If this were in Mexico, it would have been one of the least busiest stalls in even areas like Tacubaya. 

It is possible that the person cooking my food was an employee instead of the mama other people mention in their reviews. Thus, I will definitely try to come back when the mama is there.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,3,0,3,HiAHxdiFymSUE6lczx--Zw

Los Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.

We ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas
and a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine/instant.

All of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said ""Como Su Casa""(""Just like home"") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit.

Most items seemed to be small plate-esque so I ordered two small looking items to get variety: sopes and quesadillas.  The cashier went out of his way to explain that the quesadilla wasn't the typical quesadilla but through the pictures I had figured as much.  It was smaller than what we typically expect and it was fried...still cheese filled and amazing.  The sopes was a corn shell with beans lettuce and sour cream on it.  They had other varieties but went with vegetarian.  Both items were under $3 which makes for a cheap lunch.  They also offer soda pop in the old retro glass bottles which is kind of cool.

Now, why I almost take away a star.  A man walked in to apparently try and sell customers some items...meanwhile the cashier/maybe owner/manager locks the door.  Maybe I am just paranoid but it felt like they were trapping us in there.  There just seemed to be a lot of looks being shot around the room and it was freaking me out.

3827098,2010-06-18,3,l7BLw7-bKVD7fImtls4Lfw,"I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.

The restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.

The menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.

I opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.

The tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.

When they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.

I really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.

Two things keep this from being a four star review.  The consommé was only lukewarm and should have been hotter.  The flavors were excellent, however.  The tacos were good but it was my mistake to order them at the same time I ordered the soup.  They sat there as I finished my soup.  This was my error.

This was three weeks ago and I have been back at least ten times. This place is fantastic! I have been here for both breakfast and lunch, and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried. For breakfast they offer a ton of choices and if nothing on the menu suits you, they can also whip something up. I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros, both come with different sides like beans, tortillas, bread, etc. My husband tried the borrego (lamb), it comes with a side bowl of consome (super, super rich), cilantro, onions and your choice of bread or tortilla. The owner assured him that with his meal he wouldn't need another meal all day. He was super happy with it, although it was a bit too rich for me. For lunch we've tried the tostadas de tinga (holy crap, they are incredible), tostadas de pollo (meh), sopa de tortilla, tampiqueña and pambazos. Pretty much everything was great. Also, all of their aguas frescas are made in-house.

That being said, I'll get on with the review, starting with the disclaimer that

THIS PLACE DOES NOT SELL MEXICAN-AMERICAN food. 
People that are expecting nachos and burritos--sorry. Go to Taco Bell.

This place sells LEGIT, MEXICAN food that you would only otherwise find in MEXICO CITY, MEXICO. Phew. Okay, there. 

AND, it's some of the best food I've had outside of Mexico City, to boot. 
I haven't found any other place where I can order tortilla soup and get authentic tortilla soup. And where else would I be able to find mole verde?! MOLE VERDE. There is a huge variety of amazing food on the menu. I also saw them (WITH MY OWN EYES) start to make the food only after I had ordered it. I made awesome conversation with the woman who owns the place; sooo friendly, so chatty, always asking if we needed anything else. And at the end of the experience everything was fairly and moderately priced. To be honest, the food was so delicious that I would've paid double what I paid for that tortilla soup. 

I WILL RECOGNIZE that the interior of the place isn't exactly charming. It's a little run down, with that faint layer of grease that usually coats well used restaurants. It's small and the tables are surprisingly close to the ground -- Buuuuuut I couldn't care less. The food makes up for anything that might be aesthetically displeasing as far as seating goes. 

Try this place out. I could rave and rave about it. For days. That's what I'm doing now.

The ordering took a few minutes because there was only one cashier and he was doing that and getting the food orders out.

I ordered the Chilaquiles, which comes with green sauce, rice, beans, and a choice of eggs or meat (I got the eggs). The chilaquiles itself was fine, there's a lot of sauce so it kind of makes the chips soggy. The tomatillo sauce has a little kick to it, but not too spicy at all. The beans were OK, the chips that are given with the dish seem to be a little stale,
And the rice seems a little too salty.

They offer soda, the bottled kind and not the fountain kind, horchata, and I found this little odd...Capri sun. 

The menu is not as extensive as I am used to, but this little place is worth it if you're in the area.",HeiAMoNFdLDPrDoQ97VnPw,0,0,3,QuXDwYB1gv7MgLKlYDrrzQ

But you know it's good as many Mexicanos with their whole families arrive here regularly. Huge menu. The Hispanic guys at my place of work will vouch for the excellent consome loco, a fresh homemade chicken and rice soup served with avocado - hits the spot during cooler seasons. Normally they hate all mexican places in town but they like this one, so that's all you need to know.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,4,kaTV54Yhyfq24nRjNqEPQA

I love the way they do the quesadilla, Pasole is amazing as the tortes. A must try little spot.",BPRMzqVa2JVhAI0kxKycGQ,0,0,5,7Kc9e4NpzJUnNQ4qhlS7tQ
