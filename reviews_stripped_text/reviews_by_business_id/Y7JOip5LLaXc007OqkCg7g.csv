It depends on the lunch buffet spot you pick!
The first thing I noticed was a not good smell when I walked in . I was a little hesitant but I wasn't buying so I followed the not friendly host to the back where she seated us. 
I was impressed by the large amount of selection that they had. They also had a huge dessert bar that included a lot of flavors of icecream.
The food was probably luke warm and I am not sure when they had last changed out dishes. 
The potstickers were hard but had good flavor and a good sauce. 
Loved the seafood delight , stuffed mushroom and beef with broccoli - 
but was disappointed in their cream puffs which had an odd flavor. 
It was a bargain, but not something that I will go back for.",Pn4W0F3wc6B5fAEwpKY0rQ,1,1,2,qCj7m1rgorCGTP9BzQnA3A

This location is very good with a wide variety of food all of which ( not the highest quality) but for the price will not disappoint.  I highly recomend getting down on the steamed clams!  Yummy!  Now there is a location north on cent, this was absolutely terrible.  It was so bad that I have to bring a star down from the other place just because they are the same people.  The one up north barely has food, and their ""variety"" lol is shrim cooked five different way along with crab  legs.  Trust me you want to stay away from this place.

1633613,2011-08-17,0,Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g,"My first review, oh what a shame. I'm so disappointed in this place I'm not sure how to describe it, I just knew I had to write a review on Yelp! to warn someone. 


The FOOD:
One word. SHITTY, if you like your taste buds, don't serve this trash to them. I'm usually never too picky about food, but i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I left feeling unsatisfied. Not only is the food not fresh, it looks like it has been there for hours upon hours. The sauces on the food were dried up. I went around 5pm if that helps anyone.

They had a pretty good selection of dishes, but everything was bland and tasted like the worst buffet ever, let me rephrase that, the worst Asian food ever.  Do they not taste their food before putting it out?

Not everything was bad, they did have a few good things, like the stuffed mushrooms and crab stuffed oysters, nothing too memorable.


The SERVICE:
Now some more complaints. The workers seem to have never worked as a server before, no refills for our entire meal.  I can't believe this!  I would understand if the place was actually busy, but I swear they only had 5 tables sat and 2 servers working.  One of the guy servers literally looked like he was trying to sleep standing up.  What is this your father's store?


The RESTROOM:
Fucking disgusting!  I walked in there and looked around and washed my hands.  I swear it felt like my hands got dirtier.  The toilet was horrible, like an outside gas station toilet that has never been cleaned.  A used toilet seat cover still on the toilet and probably fresh diarrhea in the toilet.  God does anyone work in this place?


Last but not least.  The meal was around $28 for 3 people after tax.  I gave the lady $20 in cash and told her to put the rest on a card.  For some genius ass reason this lady decides that she deserves a $6 tip and takes the cash and charges the other 50% of the check on the card.  WTF is this?  Ok, I would have no problem tipping this bitch if she refilled my drink once, but to think she deserves anything more than $2 for the service I received is bullshit.  I was so mad at the shitty food and service, that I just wanted to leave the place and not even complain about her taking the extra money.",kelT-3MrZk3rqzhVa7WR6Q,0,0,1,viocVoaDT1k1QfJKFZTWTw
1653490,2009-12-28,3,Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g,"This is actually a pretty complete Asian buffet with the good things from other Asian buffets I have gone to. For example, they actually have sashimi, though the meat is kind of dry. There is also a large selection of ice cream, a frying station, a large selection of dim sums/soups and because I went during Christmas, tons of crab legs and lobster. 

The service is pretty good too...it is a little overpriced but I guess there is seafood. A fair warning though....you have to FIGHT to get your lobster. Right when the seafood is about to come out, there is a huge crowd of people gathered around the seafood area. They bring out a new plate every 10 minutes or so but the food is gone in about a minute....it is actually pretty amusing, watching Asian parents grab lobsters off the tray as soon as they can....it's like real life hungry hungry hippos.",yuOsMknl3NFMcqiWdipBNw,0,1,4,oQHpPrD_0oR_l20wtVxrcQ
2049432,2010-06-28,1,Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g,"When I Yelped this I wondered can I really trust 8 reviews and 4 stars? I was hesitant, but added it to my list of ""possible dining locations"" list anyways. 

The food was decent and mainly Chinese though thus the restaurant name. I was mainly interested in if they had sushi and Chinese food to satisfy both my sisters and parents. The place was not as fancy as other buffets or as elegant, but hey for only $9.99 on weekends, that is decent! 

Although you can clearly see them making the sushi, it is not as ""fresh"" as the ones I have tried, but it was still good, some okay. But this is just because I love sushi and expect something more. Other than that the food was good in general.  

The best part was the end! I was expecting some soft serve ice cream like in almost every other buffets, but not at all. They had a variety of ice cream to choose from, as if you're buying it from an outside vendor (with tub of ice cream and all). There was green tea, red bean, strawberry, mango, mint chocolate, rocky road and I think a few more fruit flavors. Quite lame of me to rant so much on just ice cream, but it just made my experience there much better!

Both my sisters and parents were satisfied so victory! Don't expect too much from this buffet otherwise you'll be unsatisfied. Keep in mind that this buffet is only $9.99 per person and is not those high class, 5 star food. It is your ""gotta save money, but still want something decent that you won't later regret while sitting in the bathroom.""  

Bottom line: In need of something cheap to keep that wallet bulky? Ice cream cravings? Decent food? Then Pacific Buffet it is then!

It is clean and has a wide range of food selection! I definitely want to try dinner, since they serve oysters and crab legs!

We have a NEW Challenger to the Buffet Throne currently ruled by Buffet of Asia.

 I decided to give this a try as I didnt feel like traveling all the way to Buffet of Asia (BOA) on Rainbow and overall it wasnt bad. 

They had a limited sushi selection compared to BOA but what they did offer was pretty decent. It would have been nice if the kitchen staff would have refilled the Crab Salad on the salad bar so I could have topped my rolls off with that in the abscence of any peel and eat shrimp, which I usually put on my sushi rolls.

 They had the usual chinese fare = Beef & Broccoli, Lo Mein, fried rice, spicey chicken, spring rolls, green beans,  those really really Red pork strips etc. They did have some small peeled shrimp mixed wt some other seafood in a sauce bu it wasnt the same as having peel-n-eat shrimp. They also have a mongolian bbq station where you can select meats and whatnot for a che to grill. I always pass on this as I dont want to wait when food is already there for the taking. 

On the desert bar the offerings were a little bland wt premade cake squares, puddings, jello & fruit and NO Ice Cream at all. I dont know how they expect me to celebrate someones Birthday w/o ICE CREAM??? They did have a Coconut pudding and I sort of overlooked the above considering how much I like COCONUT.

The dining room was pretty open and spacious and at the time I went, 2pm'ish, it was uncrowded and I got a nice comfortable booth where I was able to spread out my newspaper and read and eat at leisure. And at $6.80 the price wasnt bad at all. 

The waitress could have been more attentive in filling my water, which was the only thing I was drinking, but overall I liked it and will definatly be back to try the dinner buffet where more seafood items are available according to the hostess/cashier = both fried/raw oysters, crab, shrimp, salmon etc. for $7.99.

Still, BOA reigns supreme and #1 in my eyes of all the places I've tried so far in my limited 5 months here in Vegas.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,2,1,3,Itr09rV1N0MCbd70TfwQ-g

Anyhow, this place is pretty convenient, located 5 minutes away from the Strip. I was eager to stuff my face because I had saved my appetite all day to eat at a buffet. 

The food was surprisingly fresh and very good, and definitely the best Asian buffet I've eaten at. The service is good and the staff are attentive. Although I have to note that the sushi was mediocre and not *that* good. Everything else was delicious. My favorite was the mini potpie filled with red bean. Funny that this thing was placed in the same section as the soups and other salty things. But nonetheless, those little pies of hundreds calories are amazingly addictive :) Overall, my parents (very picky eaters when it comes to Asian food) liked this place a lot and mentioned about eating here again when we're in Vegas.",JnUObp6gj3HUvaI6ubTzWQ,0,0,4,L-k49mLXRktMub4SXI2j8Q

4260126,2011-01-10,0,Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g,"My sister said that this place was pretty good but she also came here on an off night once, so I didn't have high expectations. My husband wanted to try this place- he likes Asian buffets. It was $7.99 each- dropped from $9.99 for dinner (you don't pay first here, unlike Buffet @ Asia). The rating posted on the wall was an A rating, which is a good thing.

The food that I thought was pretty good: garlic shrimp (burped all night), coconut shrimp (surprisingly yummy), teriyaki chicken (good flavor), fried scallops (good), bbq chicken on sticks (good flavor), mushroom chicken (more mushrooms than chicken, but that's what I wanted anyway), california roll (fresh, the rice was not hard, as it usually is at buffets), cheese rangoon (hard to mess this one up though), fried fritter (not greasy and just enough sugar sprinkled). 

The string beans tasted funny (you know how sometimes veggies can taste either metallic or like dirt). My husband said that he could of gotten more taste from the takeout container on the lo mein noodles- it was very bland. He also said that the won ton soup was the worst he ever had. 

There is a mongolian station (but didn't see the raw veggies though, but then again, I didn't check out the other side either) and ice cream station are in the same general area (see what I mean about kind of a weird setup?)- (the mango was really good- almost tasted like Magnolia- A Filipino brand found in asian markets, the green tea had some ice particles). The other dessert available were lychee (mmm), bananas (some more bruised than others), pineapple, green jello (no hardened outer skin either), red jello, chocolate cocoa cake (really good actually), macaroons, and cream puffs. 

Some of the dessert food is right next to the salads; a little awkward of a setup, but suppose it works. Some of the dishes that I didn't sample include: shrimp (with heads), crawfish (not a fan), sliced sausage, sio mai, pork bun, noodles, fried rice, and the salads.

The ""Pinball Machine"" effect as I call it- many of the asian diners (85%-90% of the diners here- later saw a tour bus outside in the parking lot)- were actually running for the food as if it were going to disappear immediately (just watch out). Yes, just a warning, you will be bumped. You will get ""line-skipped"" as well. If there is a space, one will quickly be other there as well. Just letting you know what to expect. My husband couldn't wait to get over there when it was all clear. 

Sticky floors are denoted with ""Caution Wet Floors"" signs all over near the food stations. Be careful if you are wearing boots or heels. I saw an employee mopping up the floors, which is nice that it is constantly being tended to BTW, but still be careful walking in those areas. The food stations are not messy but it seemed like some containers were completely out of food. I noticed a man kept going to the cooks asking for something. I also noticed that a man seated near us, asked for something, and it was brought over to his table, because it was the second time he asked (they didn't know what happened to it). 

The decor inside is totally transformed from when it used to be a Black Angus steak house, with dark rich woods, dark lighting, semi-private booth seating, adding to the anonymity factor. Basically, in the main dining room, it is wide open and pretty bright (lighting). There is seating (two lanes, one being booth and the other tables & chairs, narrow) on the side of the food stations, as well, located near the bathrooms. This is where we were seated, but the employee was sweeping away all the food (how the heck food ended up on the floor, must mean slobby customers, and it was still kinda gross after the sweeping). The busy hostess asked us if that was ok. My husband wanted the booth.

Final verdict: my husband thought that Buffet @ Asia is better- I agree. I think it's a solid three stars though. I know what is good here, at least; I know what to avoid. Though the employees seem rushed, they are still pleasant and attentive (refills).",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,1,3,YV1RihITUuLWnAFAj7thag

5199515,2010-08-28,10,Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g,"Disclaimer: I am not qualified to write an unbiased review of Pacific Buffet because if it comes from the Pacific I am not really jazzed about stuffing my mouth with it. In other words, AYCE crab legs don't make my heart sing. Couple this with my inherent distrust of buffets, and I am pretty much guaranteed to not fall in love with a place named Pacific Buffet.

However, my husband adores both seafood and buffets, so we ended up here one night when I was weak and content to go wherever he wanted to go. The service is kind. The quality is decent, but I really probably ate a total of 33 bites. Everything was greasy, carby, fried or fishy, which probably describes several people's dream meal, but not mine.

My husband did consume about 4 plates of clams, and even I thought those were tasty. (I am generally not a clam consumer.) Other than the clams, I ate some vegetables, soft tofu, and red bean desserts. The green beans were solid, but the spinach tasted fishy. The salad was turning brown, so I left that number on the buffet. The red bean cookies and ice cream were surprisingly good. I think I ate 4 of the cookies, and my husband proclaimed them worth the price of the buffet alone. They were darn delicious. 

As I left, I realized I should have probably given the create your own stir-fry section a whirl. Still, given my eating habits, this was personally a sad star experience. I had to do a burrito bowl later that evening.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,10,2,IeAc7vcf6twtLnbc2hAVdA

The price is very reasonable (I am not sure how they are making much money charging $9.99 + tax + tip for dinner).  Service is efficient and the staffs are friendly.

What I didn't care for:
1. Their sushi preparation.  The rice is either overcooked or overworked  (most likely the case) to the point that it is a solid layer of rice (NOT good eats) surrounding the fillings.  
2. Dinner plates can and should be washed better!  Why not take a few extra seconds to check that plates are cleaned, before bringing them out for service. This is a minor detail that reflects the lack of care by some staff, and leaves a negative impression.

What I thought was good:
1. Vegetables were cooked very well, and seasoned perfectly.
2. Mongolian Wok-style noodles.
3. Cold foods served cold and chilled properly; hot foods served hot and kept warm at the steam table.
4. Wide selections of foods and desserts.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,1,4,7C-0J5KZJ41o2sJJsiPe5w
