2104583,2018-03-22,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"Brand new pizza shop at Cheyenne /215 so thought we would see how it was.....lots of specials !!!! We used a coupon got the large pepperoni magnifico and garlic bread sticks  for 12.99.  Awesome, awesome deal very good pizza, a little greasy but I love that.  The bread sticks were the bomb.....so good with garlic dipping sauce on the side. .....will get the sticks everytime. We will definitely order from again, super fast delivery and you can order online,  so next time you're in the area looking for pizza...give Marco's a try you won't be disappointed  !!!!",Oq89wrveZYH4iJlTksti2A,1,0,4,1lUQ7a1a0pHN2E3_oy0Ltg
2213693,2018-04-25,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,Marcos Pizza is our new found place when it comes to pizza. The Pizza's are delicious and great service. Thumbs up,Xe4FH1ytp-3AcF9SYddBmg,0,1,5,2GYA41ut0rbJj1DdhdYgSg
2993158,2018-02-01,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"I been here 3 times since the opening and its been good everytime. Their pizza is pretty good, and it tastes extremely similar to Peter Piper Pizza which is not a bad thing by any means. Their regular crust is very thick so I'd recommend thin crust if you don't want too much carbs. Their wings are also very good but they are tiny and explains the cheap price. 

The service here is really nice and all the workers are friendly. Overall, although it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it beats any fast food pizza places and I'll most likely order from here whenever I need a pizza fix instead of the pizza hut across the street.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,0,0,4,DhrzCCYZydmf1JvVg-eN7Q

From the friendly people answering the phones to the absolutely wonderful delivery people it is a grade A experience.

3556514,2018-07-02,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"We stopped by here last night as we were craving pizza and this was on the way.
Marco's is a pizza franchise that has been around for decades. They close at 11 pm. Located next to Carpriotti's. There are some tables and the place is clean. They have good amount of menu options, a bit of variety with sides, subs, salads, and desserts. 

We ordered the Deluxe pizza, which is their most popular and has pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, 3 cheese and their signature sauces. We ordered it thin crust with black olives. The medium size is $14.99.  It took 20 mins. The crust is fluffy and crispy but not doughy. I want to try the wings next time.

The staff is friendly. Some say the prices are a bit higher than other national pizza chains but I am not sure about that. The quality of food is ok.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,1,0,3,ytZ8MEw0HYw3mT1z8qzuCA
3666028,2018-02-03,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"A little disappointed. Ordered over the phone for a pick up and the employee who answered had no idea how to take an order, the person answering the phone should know the menu and also the coupons. Pizza was pretty tasty.. crust was dry",bpKp3IGW2o6ugYq4sS0nxw,1,0,2,s2-vrorG6ojM65IXHhwPFg
3959233,2018-02-01,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"Pizza is great. Stick with pizza. Classic crust is delicious. Pepperoni Magnifico quickly becoming a favorite! Cheese is salty goodness.
Finally a decent pizza place to order from in the neighborhood. Baked well adds a nice option for a little browning of the cheese. 

BUT tonight we ordered the wings extra crispy with a side of hot and bleu cheese. The wings came piping hot in a tightly sealed container. Unfortunately without a vented container of some type, the wings steamed themselves soggy on the way to our house. Not a bit soggy, completely soggy. I figured they would still be good dunked in the hot sauce and bleu cheese, but looking through everything, my side of hot sauce was missing from the order although printed on the receipt. 

My advice? Again, stick to pizza. If you NEED wings or even strips, I would definitely order them takeout only.",3uPFvvFK9KNexbrArw2W6Q,0,0,3,zd7044Eu4oYJ-JyWPNJINg
4009296,2018-05-22,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"Oh my lord, just to start off, the customer service, absolutely the worst customer service ive ever recieved, a blond bigger woman maybe named lindsay? There is no way she got past grade 10... she had such a musty odor i could not deal with it.immediately lost my appetite, the way that they make the pizza was unremarkably disgusting, toppings all messy and were not even when i asked for a half and half, my gluten free cheese only had anchovies on it! How!?!?!?! 10/10 do not reccomend, and may i just say the prices are so bad, can just as easily go to pizza hut and save $30",2VTvG7Iz9_HR4ezl5IdqRA,0,0,1,dmhwqNWeRPDjx3wgQf-kow
4219557,2018-03-11,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,Average pizza. It's comparable to pizza hit hand tossed pizza. Very greasy. Also the big disappoint is the price for the pizza. It's very expensive for a chain pizza company. You can go to dominos or pizza hut and get a pizza for half the cost. I don't intend on going back here for future pizza orders.,AVQJ6tJp-o-p9gxpw1hkdA,0,0,3,W4A9pGdm1qw56T9oW-7N7w
4348624,2018-01-27,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"Ok, so being new to Vegas and being new to this area, I decided to give this newly opened pizza joint a try. this is my new favorite Pizza place. I ordered your basic pepperoni cheese pizza and it was perfect! Cheesy, crunchy and piping hot. Loved everything about my pizza from the sauce, to the cheese and even the pepperoni's weren't super greasy like some other pizza places, but really for me, its the sauce, and bread that makes a good pizza, I feel this pizza is an EXCELLENT value for the price! Awesome staff too, friendly and welcoming. I know it sounds like I work at this place but I don't lol! my pizza was honestly just that good, and the customer service I experience by the people working at this location made my visit 5 stars. I will definitely be back!",6spWMADZxOHJTxt2HZiswg,0,0,5,S8-h3l_FZuWRVzckp5Qf_Q
4970184,2018-02-11,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"So I will start this out is I generally don't eat pizza, Red sauce gives me heartburn. So we ordered the white double cheesy pizza which is with white sauce and bacon, added double mushrooms, pepperoni and black olives. As you can see I don't Yelp much, my wife gave the order over the phone the person taking the order (she) could  seem to care a less of what she was ordering. Pizza came and we soon found out there is just a normal pepperoni pizza with olives and black mushrooms. My wife decide to call and let them know that it was not what we ordered, the response on the phone was Ok sorry about that. I just hope the owner trains their employees better, this is a fairly small neighborhood word will get out quickly, I never asked for something for free but the lack of caring what your customers think is not a good way to run your business, just because you are there does not mean your customers will be",ANh6Jj2q9R5GM64IEma3ig,1,0,1,xJg87lfORjDyz0EqNrfDWg
5506104,2018-03-29,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,This review is before I ate the food.  Their online site has specials that when you click to choose then say only valid for particular days.  They also charge for 2 toppings when you order 1 topping on left side and 1 on right side.  Only place that does this.  Also the blonde that was working register didn't know how to work it - had to get assistance.  She didn't also understand when I asked for separate bags for the 2 breads with sauces as I told they were going to 2 different homes.  She then made a rude comment thinking I didn't hear.   I will go back to the pizza place down the street and recommend for everyone else to do the same.  Not good for a new business.,qXkTGl4YhA8cfmefxtLyoA,0,0,1,-zIdTKp1zcUuDamRVFCJXw
5532473,2018-03-24,0,3F7fYgrubSCzAQrpBRKMgQ,"I was surprised to see a Marco's open up the street from me. I have seen them in the Midwest, but never out here. I stopped in one night and ordered Pizza, Breadsticks and a Salad. Delicious!! Then I tried the Sandwiches with a salad. Delicious!! Since, I have been back many times and so have both kids. The food is awesome, the place is CLEAN, and they Excel at Customer Service. The Pizza Taste was remarkable, and the rest was equally as good. They do not skimp on quality. The prices are great and the food is presented well. portions are more than adequate. I suggest you try Marco's. I also had an experience the other day with one of their delivery drivers. Her name was Destiny. She was so Professional, Polite and very Neat in Appearance. I wish I could have found employees like her when I was a business owner! A note to Marco's: Keep doing what you are doing and don't change a thing. I Love your food, service and both dining in and delivery! Thank you so much!",CHGc-2TSsLSqM__TZRqO5g,0,0,5,38BX4yO48ZKsDX0lBZszqQ

The ingredients are fresh and staff is always friendly. I ordered 2 pizzas for Super Bowl and they had my order ready promptly in 30 mins as they had told me. Everyone loved the pizzas as there were a few who were unfamiliar with Marcos but after trying it, have become huge fans. Keep makin' those mouth watering pizzas!",9nFf9SoGBA_fsxYzF71JhQ,0,0,5,w0MwA6d_Mc14wJ3N1cYcfw
