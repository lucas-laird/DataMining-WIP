Meaning you may have to wait a little longer than you would at Roberto's, but it will be worth every second. This place is a mom & pop, hole in the wall at its finest! You order rolled tacos, then you watch her roll your tacos. Same thing with the shrimp cocktail, I watched her cut up the veggies right in front of me. Everything I have tried from here has been above average, and I have NOT even dined in the place yet.
Last time I was there, they gave me chips and salsa even though I was waiting for a take out order. The girl working the front always warns me if the salsa is spicy or not. (which I appreciate because I love me some spice!) And they even offer a couple not so common dishes, such as bistec ranchero, and heuvos platanos fritos. (both of those I highly recommend btw) However, if you want to stick to basic tacos or enchiladas you can't go wrong there either. 
The location is hidden, and they are not open late. But if you can manage to find the place and don't mind funky hours, I promise you'll have a new favorite local taco shop.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,2,3,5,LkVI_JmaXHZVQ6qoTzTPVw

2970675,2015-06-08,8,P9srGF_edclaYfYZjy_kgg,"""Andale"" is what you yell at you tummy to speed up digestion, because you're going to want seconds, thirds and fourths. 

This brings me back to San Diego, which in my opinion is where the best Mexican food comes from outside of Mexico. Andale is a no frills kind of place, no decorations on the walls or crazy loud music; the main focus is the food. 

I finally made way in here for lunch, because the call of the taco is strong. I sat down was given free chips and salsa, which surprised me; normally smaller places like this don't off this satisfying starter. I ordered two carnitas (pork) and two carne asada street tacos, fully loaded. Which means, cilantro, onions, two types salsa, all on two corn tortillas. These were amazing, loaded with tender meat, tons flavor, and just enough spice. This is how street tacos are supposed to be, made with two tortillas for durable food holding and no cheese. If you go to a taco shop and they put cheese on street tacos, you may want to reconsider your dining option. 

I also ordered a green chili pork tamale, which was cooked perfect. This was a homemade masterpiece, freshly unwrapped and served up. The maze wasn't too dry and the meat inside melted in my mouth. Simply a beautiful plate of food.  

As I wrapped up my meal, I noticed that they have a ""happy hour"". It changes everyday, but for twelve bucks you get an all you can eat food option. The day I was here it was chicken mole tacos, which includes rice and beans. If I wasn't about to burst I may have ordered some to go.

On Thursday they had from 12 to 3pm Happy Hour for food no alcohol is served here....

For $11.99 per person they had all you can eat Pork Mole or Beef with Potatoes with all the fixings of course to include chips and salsa.  Even though it was close to 4 when we arrived, they still offered this to us.  We did not take the all you can eat as we wanted to try other stuff from the menu.

Chips and salsa was brought to the table and it was good.  We ordered our food and while waiting for our food, the server brought us a sample of the Pork Mole and the Beef with Potatoes.  Both were pretty good, it was homemade and made with love and very traditional.  

We had tacos and Enchilada's.  The sauce is a sauce like you would find more in Northern Mexico.  Southern Mexico tends to make their sauces a little sweeter.  

The tacos were good as well as the enchilada's, however the chicken is a combination of moist and over cooked meaning it was really dry, but you did not get that in every bite.

Our server told us on Wednesday they will have Taco Happy Hour, which is all you can eat tacos.  She was not real sure on the price so it will be between $9 and $12, thats the window.

I recommend giving this place a try, everything we had was good, it was only the chicken I found to be a little dry, but otherwise I would go here again.  I like family owned mom and pop places and they do not sacrifice traditional cooking for the American Way.  This is what you will find in their native land whether is be Mexican or Salvadorian style food.  THIS I LIKE and is why I will go back.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,11,9,5,eVxsMZtbxVXgcPW9yq9dqw

I've been here twice now, the first time I got the burrito which was great and this time I'm getting the chicken enchiladas which already smell amazing. Can't wait to come back and try something new!",_UYvPbXLkM6aqtmMiaLgVQ,0,0,5,UQM7BIrWIsanRMpROr6_hQ

I can't stay away now. Their chips and salsa are also top notch. I particularly love the really hot salsa. The flavor of it is unlike anything I've ever tried and I'm hooked. Definitely recommend everyone to try them out!,kb60_De5hn8Vua-BSnJMxQ,1,1,5,oGEF3ST-ZkzMH5u2iHKErg
