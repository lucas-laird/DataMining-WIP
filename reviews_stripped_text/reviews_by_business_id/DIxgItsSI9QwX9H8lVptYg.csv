220546,2016-07-31,1,DIxgItsSI9QwX9H8lVptYg,Great recommendation by neighbors. Only been open a week at this location. Ordered the sweet and sour chicken with chow mein noodles and it was delicious. Can order chow mein without the veggies; just he way I like it. Friend ordered the orange chicken and it was great. Staff was friendly. Highly recommend. Be prepared to take home left overs.

This has not changed in all the other future visits....warm and friendly greetings.

Half rice and half chow mien, if you wish...or all rice or all chow mien.  It's up to you!  Sometimes I have even been treated to a complimentary soup or a couple of doughnuts, BONUS!!

The delivery fee wasn't so bad, and there's no minimum (this is all on grubhub), which I really enjoyed. The fried rice was spectacular, very delicious, flavorful, and filling - it was also at a great price! However, at only a few dollars shy, the crab rangoons were pitiful, which is why I omitted the final star. The crab rangoons hardly had any filling, it was primarily just a fried shell, and a small one at that. I'm used to these HUGE chunks of crab rangoon, especially when they are priced at almost the same amount as an order of fried rice or orange chicken. 

Skip the crab rangoons at all costs. Delicious, but very pitiful, pretty much a rip off. Otherwise, great price, great speedy service, and great rice.",bJ_CWJ55ZLgwNvo-OAW2Og,3,1,4,RBUrfXg5Xcpav8dmpFfI0Q

The food was ok. But the delivery driver could not understand me and I could not understand him. I understand a language barrier but when you have to explain directions to someone over the phone it's very frustrating. I asked for soy and hot mustard to be included with my order and it was not. The food was cold when the driver finally did arrive because he got lost. I don't blame him. The restaraunt should have better gps instructions.,Dniw0MiFvAeznV9Mxch2TQ,0,0,3,ez9D9ytqKhVqGwk63HcduA

Located near Sushi Bomb, and Walmart shopping centre.

I was craving for Chicken wings with sesame sauce and Seafood Hot & Sour Soup.

The food was waiting for me not long after I made the order online. They seem to be fast and efficient.

Chicken wings were tasty but was too sweet for me and the Seafood hot and sour soup was good but not spicy enough. I want to try the wings original with no sauces next time.

The restaurant has some seatings and the place looked clean. I noticed they have awesome lunch specials ranging from $6.45-$7.35) until 4:30pm. The entree comes with half rice and half chow mein and you can choose all rice or all chow mein.

On my first visit, I had the Sauteed Vegetables and a Strawberry Slush with boba. I skipped the rice and all of the vegetables were easily identifiable (broccoli, snow pea pods, onions, bok choy, and mushrooms). The vegetables were cooked perfectly and I was full with just the lunch portion and no rice. The Strawberry Slush was the perfect ending to my meal. Not too sweet, with a smooth texture and plenty of boba.

On my second visit, I got the Vegetable Pad Thai and a Thai tea with boba. I will be honest and say it is not as good as you would find at a Thai restaurant, but good enough for the location. The noodles were cooked well and the vegetables and egg were seasoned well. The best part was the Thai tea with boba. I think I enjoyed that more than my Pad Thai. It was perfectly sweet and satisfied my sweet tooth. 

On my third visit, I had Vegetable Lo Mein and surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. Like the sauteed vegetable plate, all of the vegetables were cooked well (broccoli, snow pea pods, onions, green onions, and mushrooms). This time I also tried the Taro slush with boba and I was not disappointed.

Nowhere in the past cities I've lived on the mainland had proved to meet the Hawaii standards. Yes I know I'm being a snob but I know what I like and nowhere has come close. Except maybe this place. China A Go Go does give me some hope in the Chinese take out world as most of the food has not disappointed. I've tried various dishes-beef broccoli, honey walnut shrimp, HK fried noodles, chow fun, orange chicken, egg drop soup and a few more and most have been very tasty and limited on their greasiness.  I've ordered from here a few times and the wait is never long and service is friendly too. The prices are do-able so until I'm able to make it back home, this place will work to fill my Chinese take out needs.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,11,12,4,mcOvmomM3_wZopA4z6N1gg

The chicken fried rice was excellent and the wonton soup hit the spot. Best of all, I requested extra ginger in my broccoli dish and they really listened!! Thank you China A Go Go!",2dLz_y1_rUHj9O3_lJfT9w,1,0,5,M0J_mvKd-tG_rSal00CfXQ
