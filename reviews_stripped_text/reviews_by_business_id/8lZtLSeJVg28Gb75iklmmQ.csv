17754,2013-12-06,0,8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ,I went here the other day and ordered a Deluxe Pizza and an antipasto salad and it really was the best I have had in Vegas. The service is always friendly here and the food so tasty. I love the chef that works in the pizza kitchen. That guy always has a smile on his face. The portions are also really generous and pizza for breakfast is one of my favorite things so large portions make me very happy! I would recommend it wholeheartedly.,x_yj95GFN_ht70QkiMkvww,8,0,5,Uj-1Tj-m0ht8kEUoaPyxZQ
56680,2009-11-12,0,8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ,"Pizza is a subjective thing. What I like you might not. For me, an important distinction in good pizza is the quality and taste of the dough. And while East Coast Pizza isn't the best I've ever had, it is very good and I'm glad it's nearby. They've got some creative toppings to offer, too, though I usually stick with a plain cheese pizza because I enjoy the crust so much. 

They also make a very good Greek salad. 

People who work there are friendly and pleasant and I often see the owner, too. When ownership cares enough to be there, the experience and the product is usually much better. 

I'm a regular customer and I certainly recommend East Coast Pizza.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,1,0,4,kWgCdatg-Z-wsCNKYQosTA

I don't know if East Side changed hands or if the owner(s) got too greedy but ordered a pie & when I got it home 1-it looked funny 2-tasted like a frozen pizza (the cheapest crap you could find) & when I looked at the bottom it clearly was not a fresh pie as the crust had small holes on bottom like you would find on frozen pizza crust. One bite & in the trash went the whole pie. 

I hate it when owners take a great business & ruin it by cheaping out on the customers. Unforgivable.",FCdZGj4CccoeSuLFD3qErw,4,0,1,auz1P1Ep_s7kndbPdwWCBw

336672,2016-12-15,0,8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ,"Like other posters here, I've been frequenting East Side for a number of years.  The food has always been excellent and their pizza has been my favorite of the New York style pizzerias in Las Vegas.

The new ownership, however, has made changes that are concerning.  For starters, they now have a server coming to the table instead of ordering at the counter.  It's silly - this isn't designed to be a full service restaurant.  I now have to wait for my server to come grab my empty cup to fill it from the same pop machine that is six feet behind me.  The same pop machine I used to fill my own drinks from.  

The decor of the restaurant is not visually  impressive.  They have replaced all the cirque du soleil stuff (which was strange) with random posters of sports figures that you would buy at Wal Mart.  They don't even bother to frame them, just scotch tape them on the wall.  
 
What is cool, though, is the kid's nook they put into a dead space area in the front of the restaurant.  My son's both had fun playing with the little toys they had over there.

The thing that puzzled me most was their choice to serve my food and drinks with paper cups and plates.  I'm not at a picnic, I'm in a restaurant.  I was absolutely floored that I found myself trying to eat a plate of spaghetti on a sagging paper plate with plastic cutlery.  If I didn't have an allegiance to this restaurant, I would have walked out the moment I realized this was how they were going to serve my food.  

They put in a salad bar which is mediocre, at best.  Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, croutons, nothing out of the ordinary.  The salad dressings were awful.  They all tasted like they purchased the cheapest ones they could find from Sysco Foods and served them up. 

I could live with all these things if the pizza was still exceptional, however it wasn't.  It still tasted pretty good, but I didn't care for the change they made with the dough.  I thought the previous version, which was thinner, was far superior.  

The new owner was very friendly so I hope he succeeds.  I hope he reads some of the reviews on here and is proactive in making changes to benefit his business.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,3,0,2,E38mpg5V37YIKgyTVBGzFQ
337402,2015-05-03,1,8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ,"My boyfriend and I enjoy ordering from East side. Especially on our Netflix days in.
the Mick sandwich is a favorite of ours. Pizza is fantastic, and I'm a growing fan of their wings( which will come with a side of buffalo sauce and ranch so you can pick your poison or my choice combined.)
However, I have noticed a trend in their delivery service that has become irritating. 
We opt for delivery because we are trying to stay cozy on the couch and don't intend on leaving.
Though the past few times we have gotten delivery, the delivery guy calls us and makes us chase him around the complex or will just come in the gate and make us come to retrieve our food. 
It has been different guys every time. Point being if I wanted to put shoes on and run around we could have just picked it up considering we only live about ten minutes away. 
I had taken it with a grain of salt until last night. Like many we stayed home and ordered the fight on PPV. Just FYI for those of you who didn't it's about 100 dollars to order the fight. Then here we go again, delivery guy call us just after he gets in the gate. My grub hub account has very specific instructions as to what gate and the gate code. Like many apartment complexes both of our entries feature a map of the layout. No other delivery service has ever made me come to them in this fashion. 
What really got under my skin was that while locating the guy my boyfriend accidentally dropped a few bucks. Shortly after, a knock on the door... The delivery guy informing us he had the wrong total. So you are telling me you have no trouble finding the apartment when you are missing money, but you didn't bother to seek it out when making your delivery.  
I do understand that they may be one a time restraint. Especially on busy nights like a fight night, but we pay a delivery fee. Plus on a night where we have spent a good penny on a show we can not pause, I may be reconsidering my next order.  
Thought I love the food, I have concluded I'm done with delivery fees because of the growing decline in the service I'm paying for.",mQBlUggFch2mrA_sxcKY5Q,4,0,4,4aiXf0K0sZGjXnSvP1Pg6g

542986,2016-11-30,0,8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ,"So, it breaks my heart to break-up with East Side pizza but the time has come. After 8 years and 3 owners since the good old days of Gerry and Peg owning the joint the time has come.
The pizza is no longer NY style and none of the employees are left. Even after 3 owners they stayed true to the product and service but now it's an end of an era.

The pizza crust is non existent. No flavor, no give and the sauce makes the pizza taste and feel like it's been sitting out a buffet untouched for hours.

I called to ask for the new owner and was told he was in a meeting. At 6:45 pm on a Tuesday. Got a lady on the phone by the name of Robin on the phone who said she was the owners 2nd in command. I explained how  disappointed we were in our order and she told me they were new and hadn't finalized their new recipe yet for the pizza. After nearly 6 weeks. But the thing is, this pizza wasn't off or just not so good, it's awful. And, even so they were charging the same premium price for a custom NY pizza.  Ugh! She just didn't get it. She Asked me what was wrong with the pizza and what they could do to make it better. I tried to explain the pizza was not the same but she just kept trying to convince me to give them another chance and tell her what they could do better. I appreciate the offer to help them but, Honey, if I knew how to make a good NY pizza in Vegas I would east side pizza and bring it back to life. I thanked her for her time and wished them well.

Next time we want NY pizza, we won't be going to East Side. Farewell, East Side.",VpbEcUcLiDI3q7xlCHNMiQ,4,0,1,MtlW34EySz6kLCVdoUEfPw

The crust was delicious and bottom was crunchy NOT GREASY AT ALL.
WOW the garlic knots were HUGE and FRESH out of the oven smothered with garlic butter. The BEST I have ever had. (I should have ordered 6 not 12) but, I thought they were going to be the little tiny ones that you typically get at some places.  NOT HERE! They make sure you leave full and happy!

First off, in walking into the restaurants the menus are extremely confusing. There are specials written on boards outside and at the counter, specialties up on wall, and the normal menu in written form on tables.

Since I was set to meet someone later, I was in a relative hurry to get my food. So, I ordered what I thought was the most basic item on the menu...meatball sliders. A half hour later was when I finally received my food. While other customers who had ordered after me had gotten their food much sooner, there was no mention from the staff about the sliders or an apology offered. 

In all honesty, the meatballs were not bad here with tasty herbs inside, but they were very dry at the center. The main problem with the sliders was that the inside portion of the buns were completely burnt. I don't know why they would even serve the buns to someone in that condition.

The pizza had a thin layer of sauce so that you could taste the sauce but it didn't overpower the toppings which I have to say were in ample supply. And the white pie was served up as a white pie should be, with dollops of ricotta scattered around the pie, very tasty. I can honestly say that no piece of pizza was left behind.

Been going for  a slice for a quick bite, I'm now convince that they really got the taste, that oily, dripping pepperoni pizza. the dough and the sauce is very much our favorite joint in NY.

but I think they should consider having a little bit more variety of specials that they can run different day of the week... people remembers which day is their pizza day.

I was very happy with their crispy, but yet chewy crust and it remind me of a lot of pizza parlors in NY, but for Las Vegas this was exceptional, because this is truly the heart of any great pizza!    The sauce and cheese were balanced very well.     Yes, I was very impressed with this pizza, and you folks in Summerlin are very lucky to have East Coast on the west side.

Today, I had to work in the area, and a few of the other employees were raving about this place.    I'm happy that I listen to my boss on this one, because their Meatball sandwich was pretty good!

Got a slice and a drink (white pizza with tomatoes) and was very happy!  It reminded me a lot of Famous Rays or Ray's Famous or whichever one it is in NYC.  The crust was thin, but chewy and had a great flavor. The toppings were generous, but not so much it weighed down the pie.

We left and ran some errands, but were so enamored, we went BACK and got a medium cheese pizza to take home and enjoy later. Like other NY pizzas, the slices are bigguns, so that medium pizza gave us dinner that night, lunch the next day and dinner again the next night -- and it was good every time.

They have pasta and sandwiches on the menu, too, so there's something for everyone and some delicious looking specials on the sign (including stuffed mushrooms -- nom!).  

It was $10 for 2 slices and 2 drinks, which seems about average, but it's much more economical to get a pie and take home your leftovers.  Our medium cheese pizza was only $5 more and we got more meals out of it.

The service staff was mostly high schoolers or college kids, it looked like, but they were really nice girls -- two brunettes in generous eyeliner. Polite, sweet, they brought our slices to the table for us and made sure we had everything we needed. And even though we don't live on that side of town, they made sure we had menus and encouraged us to come back again... which we definitely will.

I found the place quite easily. It is in Boca Park along with a number of other restaurants. Parking was easy. 
When I went in, I was a little confused as I saw a sign that said ""Order Here"". So i did. They do have a dining area. I asked the girl working there if they had table service, and she told me that they did on Friday through Sunday... but if you sat at a table, they wouldn't leave you hanging. Well, I ordered right there! 
Needless to say, I had one of my favorite foods! PIZZA!! Now having worked my way through school working in a pizza place, I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of pizza. I ordered a Pepperoni, Mushroom, Bacon, Kalamata Olive (Unusual but excellent ingredient!) and extra cheese. 
Now for most pizzas, this presents a problem. The problem is, too much oil, making the pizza soggy. The pizza was brought to the table, suggesting that they really will not leave you hanging! And it was prepared perfectly. The crust was solid!!! Thin crust, excellent flavor. The cheese actually tasted like mozzarella cheese, unlike some of the cheese you may get from a chain. I ordered a medium thinking it would be lots, and I might have a slice or two to take back to the hotel. (I was in Vegas on business). BUT NO... This pizza was huge for a medium. I stuffed myself on 4 slices and was only able to take 2 of the remaining 4 back with me! 
All of the ingredients were very tasty. It was possible to taste each one!! 
I watched the pizza chef as he made the pizza. I was impressed with the way he kept an eye on the oven, moving pizzas around the oven to attain the best overall consistency! And it was cooked perfectly. 
I talked to the girl before I left and I asked her about the ingredients they used... I can't help thinking that this has GOT to be one of the best NY Pizzas in Vegas! They actually bring their dough in from NY. (After all, how else do you get NY water into your mix?) 
I gave them a five! The ambience is okay. The people were great. The seating area is quite roomy... but the food was excellent! It's a bit of the drive from the strip, but well worth the trip!! I'll certainly be making it again. One of the better pizzas I have savored in my history of pizza consumption!!",sietyIIyi0mAZsvm8bcaOw,15,1,5,FIy5XhJwZFDYuw-Wg_dkog

They have a list of daily specials so we opted for the 2 slices of specialty pizza.  Basically pizza with toppings.  $8.99 for 2 slices and a fountain drink.  Not a bad deal.
We both ordered our slices with meatball and onion, paid and took a seat.  I got a little pissed as once we took a seat, the ""chef"" took a personal phone call...a LONG personal phone call so we had to wait for him to finish up before he put our slices in the oven.  Couldn't he do his job then take the call?

The pizza finally arrived and was on the greasy side. The ""meatball"" on it was more of tiny balls of meat.  Not a meatball.  Whatever...I was skeptical but it actually tasted great!  The onion was soooo good, they caramelized it so it's not harsh.  I did the napkin blot test, got the oil off and loved almost every bite of this pizza.  The crust was a little burnt, maybe cuz the ""chef"" got back on the phone AGAIN.  Whatevs...

They have a gigantic projection TV that was playing a soccer game while we were in.  There is plenty of seating and parking was ample.  Aside from the cashier who was taking selfie after selfie and the chef taking multiple personal phone calls I'd eat here again.

Slice of Pepperoni

Red Velvet Cake
Half-Order of Bombolini

As authentic as many New York slice shops despite its Westside location in Summerlin's Boca Park, East Side Pizza had been earmarked for a visit for some time when I entered its doors on Saturday night and with football playing on two screens as fairly steady stream of foot traffic arrived for takeout the experience was as good as expected - no more and no less.

Clearly a locals-only sort of spot, despite ownership proudly declaring Big Apple roots, a visit to East Side Pizza begins at the end of a long counter where single slices are there to temp and with ordering available up front or seated at tables to the right I found myself a four-top where the Italian-American menu expanded well beyond the giant rings of dough being hand tossed by a duo of young men standing before ovens glowing electric orange.

Obviously there for the pizza, but also willing to sample a few appetizers along with, it was with recommendations from a friendly female server that my order was made and with little delay the meal began with the aforementioned slice, a classic pepperoni concoction with a bit of char, plenty of crunch, and a stream of grease pooling on the plate when folded to take a bite.  Less successful, a followup of 'garlic knots' had none of the expected crunch and although reasonably laced with garlic butter the dinner-roll texture left me luke-warm, a sidecar of classic marinara improving the flavors only a smidge.

At this point experiencing a bit of delay due to several take-out orders occurring at once it was after perhaps twenty minutes of watching Oregon State and ASU that the $10 Eggplant Rollatini arrived and although meager in portion with only three thin slices of eggplant on a bed of marinara with a veil of cheese both the flavors and textures shined, a similar kind word offered to the rich cocoa tones of limited-edition Red Velvet Cake but completely inappropriate for thimble-sized 'bombolini' that lacked any semblance of yeasty nuance, instead presenting nothing but oily fried dough.

Friendly service, save for an older woman jokingly spouting semi-racist epithets to the men spinning dough, and fairly good red sauce classics are the name of the game at East Side Pizza and although never particularly sold on the idea that New York Style is a pie worth seeking out the version here is pretty close to the real deal while other options vary in quality and quantity compared to price paid.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,3,_5UzmLOBtqjhGdOsUs2P4A

The place has a bunch of New York Memorbilia - including a bunch of Yankee crap!  Of course if you get pizza in this town you usually have to stomach the excessive ethnocentric New Yorker decor, but It was clean inside and had a nice vibe to the dining area.

The pizza was better than average.  The thin crust had a nice crispiness to it.  A little skimpy on the toppings.  My only real complaint is the fast that when I order to slices I am assuming that the slices are part of a large pie.  These slices were probably from a medium pie.  The slices were smaller than other pizza joints.

I would probably go back, but I wouldn't declare this a top pizza joint.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,0,0,3,m3ndVHoXnO3nC_EMLy_bFQ

We ordered a small Margarita, small deluxe, garlic knots and a small antipasto salad. We hoped it would be worth the $60 we spent, but the pizza was NOT as thin as we hoped. The garlic knots, we're very dough-y and shaped more like blobs. The antipasto salad was mixed greens with rolled luncheon meat---nothing more. 

We'll keep searching...",JsEwlEUZvxAmbffj-mpZHg,0,0,2,mPsWZy-wI_FnewzddXyCxg

We came in during lunch time and wasn't very busy. 

Ordered pizza and drinks, the pizza took about 10-12 minutes. 
The employees are super nice and very attentive.  

The best thing of all, if your little one eats all their food they get a special prize out of the prize box!! 

This establishment is very clean including the bathrooms!!!",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,2,0,5,OcX3fHVaHQNUbXveLDtaqg

Lots of televisions in a small place so place is noisy.  I like their white pizza and meatball sub.  Good stop for a quick meal while at Boca Park.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,1,3,GAFcRYJKQeEbl8g51mc2lQ

We made it from scratch every day ,rising dough.....and it's like pizza on awesome Italian bread. I have ordered the pasta from here as well and it was very good .  They deliver in my neighborhood and I would highly recommend it!",tOZSL8plD7JGsa_A-ZKiNg,6,0,5,8TUMxumVm2U0fm7FBItj2Q

Last order they messed up the toppings.  

Called to ask about pizza and no idea other than ""they have left the store""  

Love that they deliver but there are much better options.

Pizza is quality is  hit or miss.",jRl0sjzmH1Qvxs9nzWud7w,0,0,1,zZoSHyqaJbacx6onHt2kag

They are right across the street from where I work so it's always pretty easy to order from them to either deliver to work or order ahead of time to take home some dinner. They have a good variety of what they carry, but I am one of those who always gets the same thing over and over again!  It is super greasy though! I, am not one to complain.",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,11,1,5,wqF7hz-QIQLU1RjqmZjcvQ

The pizza is really good. Thin and simple. The slice kept well too. I only ate one for lunch and saved the other for later when I got home and it was still flavorful and tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. I was interested in some of their pastas. I will have to come by another time to check out their dinner specials or some of their lunch pasta specials.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,3,4,vTLHyCtWcqUWSZ5ESwzI3Q
