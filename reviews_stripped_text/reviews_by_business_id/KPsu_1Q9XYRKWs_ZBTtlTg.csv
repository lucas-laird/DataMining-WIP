1000563,2017-08-27,0,KPsu_1Q9XYRKWs_ZBTtlTg,The view is amazing! We luckily we happened to stop in during happy hour which made it more reasonable for drinks and apps. Drinks were 2 for 1. We had an old fashion and caramelized pineapple manhattans. We also half priced appetizers: roasted tomato fondue and ahi tuna poke. They were both delicious but I would recommend eating the poke first as the spice of the fondue killed the taste. We loved the experience but without the Happy Hour discount it would have been very expensive.,sEFkc8bvnqBXB3Z4A7U8jw,1,0,3,OG91sHxicgwannFB3oTCgw

I had appetizers and drinks one night while I was in Vegas and I must say I enjoyed every minute. The drinks were tasty and the food was good. I had the sliders. Amazing view esp at sunset and night time.",RYi_egaoLFBmGLHfFFwJCA,0,0,4,wbHnQYB3FKwboLgsZpc6Ww

I was there with a group of about 10 people, both family and friends and we sat down, ordered a big round of drinks and also a huge appetizer. The drinks were dropped about 20 minutes after we ordered them, and the appetizer never came. We waited for about an hour, we finally asked for our bill and said we had dinner reservation somewhere so to take the appetizer off the bill. When we said this, the server looked perplexed as if she had no recollection of us ordering the appetizer to begin with. in a boring conclusion, the appetizer was removed from our bill and we all laughed thinking ""what the hell?"" Before we left, we went out side to the balcony that overlooks the entire city of Las Vegas and took photos, which was nice. We then proceeded to dine at Rivea the restaurant next-door. Check out my next review to learn more about that place.",hA2X9akTxboda17YqbF20g,3,1,2,LIxMHMVqipplAAmL6nNBWQ
3672597,2015-10-11,0,KPsu_1Q9XYRKWs_ZBTtlTg,It is what it is.. overpriced alcohol for tourists. I recommend coming here for a beer. It's truly the only thing reasonably priced here. Don't expect an employee discount.,YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,1,1,3,mJZdvDQpKhkFpUkcgArNNw

And at this time of all times (shooting)... 

The most unwelcoming place I have been to lately as a Local.
Sad, for I live on the Strip! I had not visited Sky Lounge in 2 years. Back then always had a good experience. My  Bartender most often a Hispanic gentleman...and gentleman he always was to me and all customers. 

I was overlooked today while tourist/visitors were welcomed. How did bartender know I was local? Is a lone female assumed to be a prostitute? My drink order was wrong. Ordered a French 75 and incorrect liquor used. It was Happy Hour so I wasn't going to complain. The drink was untasty. Drank one (2for1) but left the other.

Ordered food and was not given utensils, nor offered any. Yet the couple to my left and the 20 somethings to my right were catered to, given a warm hospitality welcome... 

The saving grace was a bartender/bareback 
Who asked if I needed anything. 

I work in the service industry, serving minimum 500 people per day. I will not return to Sky Lounge and when asked about places to go by my customers, I will definitely tell them to avoid Stratosphere and the Sky Lounge!",LjyTgTwe6BB69_DQEjdjNQ,1,0,1,iboh4_FCFomyV-PzhGvcGQ
