If you are tired of gringo-ed versions of Mexican classics you need to come for a visit. It's all about the flavor here. The Dining Room is clean but without a real sense of style. I am impressed every time I come here, you will be too. If this place was in Summerlin you would pay triple for authentic food like this.",vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,0,0,5,MoOIt10-Dnx_nu-WZcArcg

Being a couple of white folks who've visited Mexico plenty of times, we decided to be adventurous. So glad we did, the food here is amazing! Had the shrimp taco platter and it was delicious. This place is super authentic Mexican, right down to the styrofoam cup of hand soap in the bathroom (the dispenser was broken.) I'd definitely eat here again.",ULrxb5xM-6AlT_UEGQt9vQ,1,0,5,UOJvDuiiGKKHTm-bh6Qw6Q

They fry them fresh on the spot and I swear they are the best churros I've found outside of MX...

2851690,2016-09-08,1,7NvIgf7XW55OKa5ZU7gw8Q,If I could give them negative stars I would. Years ago they where one of the best Mexican food spots to go to but now they really suck. I ordered al pastor burrito and it didn't even taste like it. It was so dry that I thought I was eating a carnitas burrito. NEVER again will I be going here again. Mind you I am Hispanic and for me to say that this place is not worth going. I would rather drive 30 minutes away for good Mexican food than eat them and they are like  5 minutes away from me. Definitely will not recommend this place.,Tk1RrJZjU59b1h1mCU89QQ,2,1,1,OF0d2jr5xXMU5IxpeYi_KA

It was clean, fast and the employes were super nice. I got a enchilada place with rice and beans. It was delicious! It was so great that I even ordered more food to go!

Customer service was also good, the lady at the counter was friendly and patient while we looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.  I ordered the gordita and taco combo and everything tasted great.  My husband ordered the enchilada and taco combo.  He said this was very good.  I also ordered a champurrado and I must say that it was the best I had ever had.  The taco was good, but I have had better.  If I'm looking to only have tacos, I already have another place for that.  Since the food was so good here I know I will be returning to try other dishes.  The only thing I did not like was the way the food was served on styrofoam containers cut in half.  It just looked a little ghetto to me, and that's why they got 4 stars from me.  Also, for all the food we got and drinks, our total was $16! You can't beat that, every time I go out to dinner with my husband our total tends to be around $22.00",s03Hbpkhb2uklGs9y6k9DQ,0,0,4,0fJf3F_1eyLXdphk7wvQvQ

We walked in and saw only Mexicans and the place was filled - for those of you how don't know how to spot out authenticity - with only Mexicans and that is a VERY GOOD SIGN!

We ordered Carna Asada, Chili Verde, Horchata and a few other things.  This food is the best Mexican place we have eaten at in all of Las Vegas!  Wow such an awesome place, you absolutely have to check this one out and it's worth the far drive from the strip if you're just here visiting.

Service is okay

Got the Carne Asada Taco combo with Horchata for lunch. The food is very authentic and the prices are very good. Three tacos, rice, beans, homemade tortillas chips and a large Horchata was only $8.38 out the door. The food was fresh and the service was fantastic. Stop by and judge for yourself.

I love their tacos! I am a huge fan of tripe (if you don't like intestine stay away but if you do you must try!) it was sooooo amazing, crispy, juicy and flavorful. Also tried their beef burrito, they use the tomato rice inside!!!! My favorite type of rice... So freaking good. I would defiantly come back again and again and again.

When I worked for the power comany we used to hit this spot up when we were on the east side of town. Good steak & shrimp burittos, street style tacos.

We both tried the al pastor, chicken, carnitas, machaca and carne asada tacos just to get a taste of a few things. Everything was excellent except the chicken. Very dried out. I had the agua fresca watermelon which was perfect. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is because we really like a margarita with our Mexican.
