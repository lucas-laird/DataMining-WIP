They don't want you to come in and they especially don't want you to order food. The bar tender Mike who works at night is flat out rude. His attitude sucks and he will make you never want to step foot in this location ever again. He would rather sit at the bar on his phone then wait on paying customers. I had to wait 10 minutes for him to even acknowledge I was in the place. There were only 3 other people there at 2AM. He just sat at the bar playing on his phone. Unbelievable. Don't wast your time.

The bar itself at this location is amazing inside. 3 pool tables, large bar with a lot of machines and the lounge section is very nice as well. 
As for the customer service... horrible. 
Worst service I've received from a bartender. 
I get it if it was busy, or on a weekend but we came in on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all. 
The one bartender behind the bar didn't even  acknowledge people as they walked in and then we saw her take her tshirt off so she had a tank top on when a group of men came in. 
The bartender we had rarely checked up on us. 
She did bring us our snack foods pretty fast. But she carded me, heard me call my mom, mom... then carded my mom? Wth?

We were there celebrating a friends birthday and wouldn't have ordered anything off happy hour if this situation hadn't occurred... The service was okay, she came every so often to check on us and took our drink orders but seemed confused at some moments. I tried to clarify things for her but she did not take the initiative to repeat our order. We always have a good time at this location so didn't expect what would happen. At the end of the night the bill didn't add up. We approached Diana and asked her if she had applied the 20% discount and she exclaimed, oh shit! And ran to the kitchen to do some kind of investigating. She came back out a few minutes later with a post it that wrote MGM 640 and told us that they no longer had the Wynn code in the system. We showed her the wynn employee site that clearly stated PTs offered it and she said that she would try to contact management. I overheard her speaking to the bartender that there was no way to reopen the check or whatever. She said that she was just waiting for a text from the assistant manager. We waited for 30 mins. She then finally told us there was nothing she could do at the moment (BS because clearly she had some type of power if there was an MGM 20% she could have applied to us) she then told US!!! to call on Monday and ask for the GM KAYLA and tell her about the situation. She did not ask to take our information down or offer to contact us, whatsoever. Being in customer service I have never been so disappointed! Granted it is only $12-$14 being returned to us but it is the principal that matters and she did not for one moment show any type of sympathy for her mistake.

Standard restaurant/bar that is super close to the house.
I hadn't been here for a few years, the last time I came out a friend was hosting karaoke.  I liked the place then, and I like it now.  

We came out on Saturday night about 8:30pm to play some pool and have some drinks with friends who had gotten married earlier in the day.  

First disappointment:  They don't have ginger beer for a Moscow Mule.  That's my new favorite drink, and I'm finding that less and less bars are doing those.  Its hard to find one that does, actually. 

Second disappointment:  We ordered the cheese fries (and added bacon) and the garlic parm fries.  WAY. TOO. MUCH. GARLIC.  Let me say it again...WAY too much garlic. And I love garlic.  Like...I'll eat it raw, I love garlic.  I put it in everything.  But there was so much that one of our friends had to move to another table.  We let our server know, and she was appalled, and said she'd let the chef know. 

Besides those two things...the night was pretty good.  
Drinks aren't cheap here, but they're not expensive either...fairly standard prices.  The fries were great (other than the excess garlic...the cheesy bacon ones were awesome) and they also have really good pizza.  A friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with hot sauce and blue cheese dressing...too spicy for me, but really delicious. 

Also, pool is $5 per hour, which really isn't a bad rate at all.  We played until almost 1 am.

It wasn't super busy, either, so service was fairly quick.

I'll come back again for sure...its not as smokey as the other bars we play pool in, even though people were smoking...its just much more open.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,1,3,rJhCuYMpx6H16iEVSjuldw

I know Joe. 
I got ripped off and poor service tonight. 

I played $20 then did some writing at the bar. 
Bummer.

I asked for nachos. No meat, just plain nachos, which on the menu said they were $8.99. Later on, he brings the check, charging me $11.99 for ""beef nachos."" I told this guy, ""I didn't order beef nachos I got nachos."" He then proceeded to tell me that this price was the regular nachos. As I was about to explain to him, he walks away, crumpling the check in his hands, so I thought he was going to the cash register to get us a new check with the accurate price. 

No...this guy was by far the most passive aggressive person I have ever dealt with. He kept walking around serving other people, doing other things, while I continued to stare at him, waiting for our corrected check. 15 minutes goes by. I'm thinking what the heck...does this guy just want us to leave over his own mistake? I wanted to ask him for the menu to prove to him that he had overcharged us, but he was avoiding us completely. I wasn't trying to get free nachos. I was perfectly fine paying for what I had ordered but merely wanted him to correct his mistake of charging me for beef nachos (which is an extra $3 charge) instead of regular nachos.  It ain't about the $3 folks, it's a matter of principle. Finally my friend flags him down and asks him to get the check. He comes back with a check for nachos charging the same $11.99. This guy just didn't get it!!!!!! 

Since he was clearly adamant about avoiding any conversation with me, we just gave up and paid for the extra charges he billed us. 

Never going back here again. Geez, I don't know what was with his attitude when he was in the wrong. Some people told me I should have just left after he crumpled my check and threw it away. I don't know who does that? 

Totally ruined my night.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,4,2,1,3y37R8-8IghnD5OAbDSKUQ
5827119,2015-09-30,0,9hEPwq1GmU1dp3ZyBB9ASQ,"Got there with a friend at 6:00p, left a 11:30p and played .25 video poker with 5 in the whole time (except when my friend ate a hamburger), upon leaving I was charged $13.50 for 3 beers. When asked why my beer wasn't comped, she said I only put in $40 and didn't play the max of 10, so the policy is 2 beers per $20. I won, so why would I put more money in?
I go to the PT'S by my mechanic on Silverado Ranch and they have max bet on video poker at 5, so I always play 5. This place is 10 and I am not comfortable playing 10 and why and when they changed that is beyond me. I didn't put more than $40 because I won twice so therfore I didn't need to put more in. So what I get off their ""policy"" is beer at that PT'S location is $20 a beer! If you win big and continue to play, all the drinks are now on you.. (although all 3 of us lost)
When my friend ordered a cheeseburger that claimed to be big, looked like a McDonald burger and tasted horrible, ditto for the fries and onion rings.
Service: Bartender was nice, but too busy with paperwork to be attentive to the customers, we asked 3 times for more drinks.  Atmosphere: Very heavy smoke smell and seemed like everyone who did smoke in that bar was a chain smoker.  I will stick to bar that is not so corporate and caters to their patrons more than their policy.",jBRqDKPzObcofYnsW1GCCA,0,0,1,rkOeS0mgWn6ylT8B80uKxg
