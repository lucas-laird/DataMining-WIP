I ordered take out, and the food was surprisingly delicious.  Bhuna gosht and Daal masala were great with the garlic naan.  The basmati rice (ordered seperately) was also very flavorful.  If anything, the lamb was slightly overpriced for the portion.  This place needs more customers!! Gotta try it!",-wVPuTiIEG85LwTK46Prpw,1,0,4,W_2oPUFaToK26U8JW88lkQ

+ Delicious made-to-order food
+ Dirt cheap, as compared to other Indian restaurants in the area
+ Clean restrooms
+ Spacious dining tables. You will be glad when you have ordered multiple items
+ The host was fluent in English

- Service is slow, probably because the food is cooked to order
- The place is HOT! I do not know why the AC was not working

We dined here on a sweltering Vegas evening. The place was hot but was offset with good quality food, easy on spices and oil. I found the food to be under-salted but that is any day better than being served over-salted food. 

We ordered the following:
- Chicken Curry - Best of the lot. Enough for two people
- Malai Kofta - Easy on the cream and very delicious. Enough for two people
- Goat Biriyani - Low on oil, wish it had a little more salt to begin with
- Naan - Soft and delicious
- Rotis - Give it a miss...was almost as crunchy as a poppadom

They ran out of ice and we had to wait, while the owner had to rush out to get the ice. By the time he came back, we had paid and were about to leave. He explained the situation and apologized for the delay and thanked us for visiting Shalimar. Nice guy.",JlZPHwuz6Vz555NxPQVVlg,2,0,4,BEx1qF5HKz072e0JpRiq5A

I only picked up 'food maxx' and went to two different ones until I found it.  Ordering was not any easier. We just werent able to communicate properly. The food wasn't bad but defiantly could have been better. There was no complementary chutney, tea or anything. we asked for some, it was brought to us and then when receiving the reciept we realized we were charged for literally everything.

My sister told him, he's the waiter, he's supposed to bring us water. He laughed and went inside and brought us water.

842580,2011-01-01,0,4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw,"I lean more toward 3.5/5, but that's not an option.

The food is very tasty here. I have been three times and had a goat curry, a lamb entree, and the chicken tikka masala. The first two were excellent but the chicken masala was a bit dry. The meats are lean and tasty and the sauces seem to be composed with particular care. They feel somehow authentic rather than generic. 

Both the rice and the naan are also very good, and rice in particular is generously portioned. 

Prices are about $2 less than than is standard for Indian food of this quality. (I'm comparing Shalimar only to Indian rather than to Pakistani restaurants because I have little experience of the latter).

The big downside here is the decor, which is terrible. It starts on the outside, with the most inelegant marquee-style sign I can remember seeing outside a good restaurant. The interior is uniformly dull, cheap tables, plastic tablecloths, bland Western landscape art on the walls that has no relation to the ethnicity of the cuisine. It reminded me of a dentist's office, and not an upscale one. Another reviewer compared it to a laundromat.  The lack of style even extends to the menus themselves.

The restaurant is operated by a family and they seem quite appreciative and friendly toward their customers, unlike most Indian restaurants where the service is rather chilly. 

I think with a thorough interior remodel Shalimar would be equivalent to a fairly upscale Indian restaurant.",VyKRigWi_YBFA0hV7MQv_g,0,0,4,7_V_gBtx_RqEz7eI5YwFqA

The dal masala was differently made than we've ever had in that the lentils were whole instead of pureed.  It made a very nice texture, plus the flavor was gooood!   We also ordered eggplant and a mixed veg dish - both had hearty chunks of vegetable and were nicely spiced.  Oh and the garlic naan was so hard to stop eating!

2223000,2010-09-12,2,4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw,"My husband (Mike ""Vegas Aussie"" P.) wanted to give Shalimar 2.5 stars and was nice enough to bump it to three. I'll even things out and take Yelp's ""Meh. I've experienced better."" definition of the two star rating to heart and leave them with the pair.

Mike covered most of the important points in his review, but I can add a little from the usual vegetarian and Somewhat Fussy Wife(tm) angles.

The vegetarian menu (I uploaded a blurry photo) does have several items, although I think other Indian restaurants in town offer as many dishes with perhaps more variety. I may just feel this way because the paneer dishes were palak, masala, and muttar. That's spinach, tomato, and more tomato, so no indulgent buttery option like a shahi paneer or a paneer makhani, what I usually go for when having Indian food somewhere other than a buffet.

In addition to Mike's chicken tikka masala, we ordered both the paneer muttar and the paneer masala - one for me and one to share - thinking that at the very reasonable prices Shalimar offers, we ought to go full-on into feasting mode. Alas, only the masala was brought out. We were glad by then, though. We were the only people inside on this Saturday night, on display as the otherwise friendly gentleman playing host and server often watched us from the other side of the room. The notions of lingering and savouring had evaporated before the last crunch of papad. (As Mike noted, these tasted the same as the ones we get at Rani's and nuke up for snacks.)

Also, again as Mike said, we were nursing our semi-cold bottles of Kroger water, probably purchased from Food for Less next door, and another dish would've meant ordering another two dollars' worth of tepid H20. I don't object to paying for bottled water, but c'mon, Crystal Geyser is the same price and has a prettier label! I kid a little, but I love refreshing cold water with my Indian, and the barely cold plastic bottles were at odds with this preference, if not with the burgundy tablecloths. (Then again, our tablecloth was dirty, so maybe the sight of plastic empties was meant to be an thematic juxtaposition.) I also raise an eyebrow at a restaurant not offering tap water: are you being unattractively chintzy, Shalimar, or is there a plumbing issue I don't want to know about? 

Suggestion: serve the water bottles in an ice bucket and sell bucket refills at half price. (You already made the money back on a 24-pack from next door after you sold the first two bottles, right?)  Or keep them the same price, just at least keep them cold and keep them coming.

The naan was not of the soft sort that I usually go gaga over, but we both enjoyed it. I found it pleasantly chewy without that chewiness going on and on and on beyond reason.

Rice does not come with the dishes - you choose what you want separately. We shared Shalimar Chawal for $2.50. Mike liked it, but I thought it tasted like plain rice and had no smell, not even that basic (and heavenly) Basmati fragrance. You do get a pile of it, though.

After we ordered, I realized that we weren't asked how we would like with the dishes - mild, medium, or hot. The paneer masala was medium heat, which luckily is how I like it, but the sauce lacked subtlety. I felt like the chilis were a little harsh against the other spices, so instead of layers of tastes it was just a general sense of tomatoes + unspecified spice + heat. For the price, maybe that's okay. Then again, it still seemed a little below the par of buffet sauces.

The paneer itself was nice. To keep riding the quibble horse, I think they should make the pieces a little smaller. Sure, you can just chop them with your fork, but then you don't have all of those nice cooked edges and the taste can get a little dry. (And then you have to do fancy math to figure out if it's okay to ration a sip of Kroger water.)

My husband's review mentions that the condiments served with the papad came in squeeze bottles. (I've also uploaded a photo of this.) He couldn't identify the white-ish one, but I think it was watered-down raita. There was definitely a whiff of cucumber to it. Too bad my shirt is in the washer at the moment or I'd go give it another sniff. Yes, both it and the brown-ish stuff in the other bottle (probably tamarind?) were very watery. I gave up trying to make a little well on my plate and tried squeezing it onto the papad like I was dressing a hot dog. And now you know why I'm doing laundry on Saturday night. D'oh!

Pros: Slightly cheaper prices than other places, nice people.

Cons: Largely unremarkable food, slightly sad (and slightly smelly) atmosphere, warmish water woes.

To-go boxes are available, but we decided not to leave our leftovers, even the naan. Perhaps Shalimar has some stand-out dish that sets them apart, but since we have those two dollars that we didn't spend on a second round of water, I think next time we'll pay a little more for a better experience elsewhere.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,3,1,2,mJdphpS3wHbyvsBxBFSLpA

He ordered everything for us: goat biryani, goat karahi, chicken tikka masala, naan, and mango lassi (x3).  I personally do not enjoy eating goat because I find it to be too tough and at times ""gamey"" so I wasn't looking forward to our meal!  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised by the goat karahi- it was tender and pretty tasty!  The chicken, however, was dry, tough, and the sauce was gritty.  The biryani was just alright.  

This place is bone-in, if that matters to you.  Sometimes I prefer places without because I just hate biting down on gristle or little pieces of bone, but I know the bones add more flavor.  Also, the naan was just eh.  I love a good fluffly naan, but this one was hard on one side and not so fluffy (not a great description, but what counts is that it wasn't the same).

I ordered the Korma which was decent but two legs with hardly any meat - it might as well have been a vegetarian dish.  Also, the prices are not that great. As I'm not from Vegas maybe this is inexpensive compared to others. $9.99 for dish, $3 for rice, $2.50 for garlic naan, $1 for bottle of water (not explained that it was additional charge - I just ordered water).

Having lived in New Delhi for 3 years, I have wanted to try Shalimar and today we decided to go have lunch. It earned a solid 4 based on our first lunch experience.
We were greeted graciously by a gentleman obviously only just opening up for the day at almost 12. We were welcomed and took our menus to enjoy reading about the entrees. We had to dive in with garlic naan, raita, chicken tikka masala and a goat karahi.  My tough reviewer husband was thrilled with his meal and right away, between impassioned gestures and bites, claimed this is a full 4!! He never does this. I liked the spiciness of the goat and the tenderness of the chicken, for if you know Indian food it can be at times, less so.
Raita and garlic naan were perfect! We did agree to wait a bit as the kitchen was opening but once the staff were sending out food, it was hot and quick.
There were other gentlemen in the restaurant also diving in to some great looking meals. The fact we can walk over here and we now know there is Indian food in our neighborhood makes us very happy!
When you eat in an Indian/Pakistani restaurant sometimes you see authentically basic surroundings. It is not going to resemble a big fancy place on the Strip. I felt immediately comforted by the cleanliness and the photos of landmarks in India and Pakistan.

3248176,2010-09-12,0,4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw,"Going to have to buck the Yelp trend a bit here and rate this one 2.5 stars overall.

Others have commented about the lack of ambiance here and I'll have to agree. The restaurant is very plain and we went our tablecloth was a bit dirty and there was a vaguely unpleasant smell in the air. The smell was probably just an unfortunate combination of spices and foods from the kitchen, but this could really do with being closed off from the serving area, not only to prevent a medley of odors, but so the diner isn't deafened by clattering of pots and pans and so on.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, pappadums, the basmati rice, and water for my beverage.  Instead of the usual Indian restaurant theme of refreshingly iced water topped up the second I sip from my glass, I was surprised to be presented with a single bottle of Kroger water which I had to sip sparingly lest I have to shell out another dollar for another.

The pappadums were OK, but unremarkable, not unlike the pre-made ones you get from Indian grocers and then stick in the microwave for 45 seconds. Instead of the usual bowls of mint or cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney these came accompanied by a couple of roadhouse diner style squeeze bottles filled with some sort of condiments. Both were extremely runny, almost a water consistency, one seemed to taste vaguely of tamarind and I couldn't identify the other.

My Garlic naan was the highlight of my meal and had that certain mix of denseness and crispness that's the hallmark of a good garlic naan.

The rice was pretty good also, cooked with saffron and ghee and very plentiful for just a couple of bucks.

The main meal, my Chicken Tikka Masala was just ok - the chicken was of good quality and well cooked, but the sauce lacked a certain deft touch and was a little aggressive as the spices didn't all blend together quite how I like. I'd be very happy if I had cooked this up myself at home, but it's a notch below what I expect at a restaurant.

The people running this place were very friendly, but it was a rather odd experience. At around 8PM we were the only people in the restaurant and it was a little strange and awkward having the guy sitting there in the tiny restaurant 15 feet from us while we ate.

 One thing in Shalimar's favour is the prices - they are very decent. We didn't hold back on breads and rice and things and our entire meal for two (including bottled water) came to just over $25.

This is the sort of place I could imagine myself coming to regularly for a cheap lunch if I worked in the area and was limited in where I could travel on my lunch break. The food is good enough and cheap enough to eat again. For a dinner out; however, the atmosphere here is little above that of a food court and the food is only a few points above mediocre. 

Worth a look for the price, but go in with low expectations.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,1,2,fHtysAfsqneliTuJffJQYA

She indicated that we should seat our selves and brought over a couple of menu cards.  When she returned we ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Raita, and my husband ordered a tandori chicken and garlic nan.  I ordered Masala Tea and water, he ordered diet coke.  I was served the water and informed that the tea was made but surely I would wait until the end of the meal...if I had known that the meal would not arrive for more than 30 minutes...I might have objected and had my tea.  The place in shabby, uninteresting and inundated with the less than welcoming sound of the appearant arguing in the kitchen.  The lady that had taken the order disappeared for the next hour, and after more than 25 minutes the gentleman who replaced her brought silverware to the table....5 minutes later the food arrived, in 2 stages....I am glad that I stayed as the food was quite good...  After an hour the gentleman removed our plates to package the left overs...appearantly got distracted with an employee who may have been his nephew....10 more minutes past and the lady returned and asked if everything was alright.  I told her we were waiting for the check....later the left overs were brought to the table...The gentleman kept trying to get me to take tea, even though I told him that I didn't want it after such a long wait...the check never appeared, so, my husband went to the check out stand to try to pay the bill.
Bottom line...we will never return...It is such a shame that they can cook so well, but are so inefficient, confused, and lacking in basic business and service skills that it is not worth the going.",6eTY4D7qV8dHPVoFa_-mCQ,1,2,2,hWl17xe80Istn4BnFuPMwA

The food here is definitely the best and most authentic Pakistani food in Vegas and infact defiantly one of the best I have had in the US and I have been to all in Socal, DC, northern virginia, Houston etc. 

Now the ambience is bad, it's a run down hole in the wall and can be construed as very depressing. It's irrelevant to me because I'm here for the food. 

So the 5 star rating is for the food. Their chicken tikka is amazing!

It is a family run business (I'm all for supporting ""The Little Guy""). They don't speak/understand English clearly. I grabbed a bottled of water to drink out of the cooler as I waited. I would've thought that they would've given it to me for free for their mess up but instead they charged me for it twice & I caught them (It was an honest mistake on their part as 2 people were involved. They refunded me $1 cash out of the drawer). I received 3 dishes (since I kept/paid for the mess up) & garlic naan. Two of the dishes tasted exactly the same (malai kofta & paneer tikka masala). BLAND. Not rich & creamy. All 3 were FILLED with grease. Definitely tastes like Pakistani not Indian. I will not return. :(",YHU8CYdBOXk2IwkKYjEGPQ,4,0,2,HaAt-teLebUs8RWdYYFRLQ
5198999,2011-08-05,0,4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw,"There are so many variables at work here. I am not sure if an accurate star rating exists! I have returned on several occasions over the past couple of weeks, and my conclusion is that there are more ways that your experience might go wrong than ways in which it might go right, hence the 3 stars. There are two dishes that I highly recommend: the dal and the mili juli. They are both complex and cheap. However, the other items we have tried have been meh, and the atmosphere is not ideal...and the beverage situation isn't either. Oh, and sometimes the gentleman/owner is great, but at other times he spaces out and messes up your order leaving you waiting for the rice you ordered while he whisks away the naan he mistakenly delivered for your table. Couldn't you just leave the bread?

If you are nearby and craving curry, it is worth a try. We will probably return, but we will stick to the proven dishes and not expect too much in the way of ambiance.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,3,3,b8S82rinmDj4uNTuHqNelQ
5329629,2010-09-24,0,4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw,"I give this place 3.5 stars. The food was pretty tasty, so it is very difficult for me to take off stars, but  the ambiance and the water issue was large enough for me to take off the stars. Let me explain: Upon entering this establishment at lunch time, there was no one there, except for a middle-aged couple (I guess the owners?) who didn't greeted us haphazardly and had us sit whenever we wanted; The ambiance gets about 1.5 stars at most (and this is due to the nice burgundy table cloths, otherwise there will be no stars). The place looked clean enough, but not appealing. The artwork was of posters in super faded colors, and looked as though it was purchased from Saver's. Did not visit the restrooms, but imagine they were just as boring and unassuming. 

Once we were seated, we were given laminated green menus that looked very cheap and unattractive. Tables are covered in plastic over the tablecloth, which skims the knees and looked a little dirty. Again, very unappealing. There is a cash register on a very medicinal looking counter and a coca-cola cooler next to the check out counter--very unappealing once again.

We were brought Kroger bottled water upon requesting ""water with lemon."" My friend did say not to expect lemon, but I did expect nice, refreshing water in an average glass with ice, instead I got Kroger bottle water ($1 each). My friend asked: ""Can we please have free water?"" at which point the server/owner brought a pitcher and two styrofoam cups for us. Upon taking a swig of water, I almost threw up. It was THAT bad. The water tasted like it came out of the sink of dirty dish water, literally. I think the previous yelper who commented about Shalimar possibly having plumbing issues was onto something. I called the server/owner over and told him that this water was undrinkable, at which point he exclaimed ""the water is bad here, I told you it's no good here."" Take it how you may...

I am glad that I waited for the food, although I was very close to walk out judged by this water incident and by the decor. The food was good. My eggplant dish was delicious and so was onion naan. My friends' lamb dish tasted a little reheated, but tender at the same time, she liked it, but I didn't really care too much for it. Lamb is best eaten freshly cooked. The rice had a variety of colors and was a little too oily, also tasted reheated, but not bad. Bottled water was as you would expect  :) .

Service was very good, as expected since we were the only people there. The owners/servers were very friendly and very helpful with my food allergy concerns and ingredient questions. Especially the female owner. The male owner was a little grouchy at times. We continued on being the only people there for the entire visit. The owners did remark that they are very busy at night, which I had a little hard time believing, but good for them. I love mom/pop places having success in their endeavors.

Prices are good here, especially for vegetarian and vegan dishes. I found out that many vegetarian dishes are, in fact, vegan which is rare in Indian cuisine. As the owner explained, they are Pakistani and use much less dairy than the Indian cuisine. Kudos for that.

Bottom Line: I will go to Shalimar again in the future if I'm craving Pakistani food. I will order vegetable dishes and naan only and drink the $1 bottled water. I will stay away from lamb/meat dishes and rice.  I will smile and converse with the owners, but I will not like the decor or the water problems. Too bad I couldn't rate this higher, but this water issue and the decor, plus reheated lamb taste prevented me from doing so.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,2,2,3,rOSTj56d_cck3hbUv3M25Q
