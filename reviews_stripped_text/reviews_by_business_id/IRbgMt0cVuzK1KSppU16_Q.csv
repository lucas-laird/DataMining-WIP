The quality is good and the service very impressive, not to mention the incredible ambience experience...the only thing to not is that if you are looking for a red wine you will not find any bottle cheaper than 50$...

My girlfriend and j went back and had the worst experience in an upscale restaurant. We will NOT be returning here...

We ordered about $300 worth of food and drinks. Our first server was either drunk or high or possibly both. He was so out of it, he couldn't get one thing right. After a few dishes I think he realized how much we hated his service. So then he turns us over to a waiter who probably wasn't a waiter maybe a clean up guy. Either way he was even worse to deal with. 

He argued with my girlfriend about the drink she ordered. Seriously!? I wouldn't even expect this at a dive bar! 

One of the dishes we ordered was the more expensive Wagyu Filet they have on their menu. After being passed between 2 idiot waiters, they took forever to bring the dish out. When the filet comes out its not even the one we ordered. They tried to give us an overlooked filet of their regular one. 

We weren't offered anything for this experience or mess up between 2 absolute retards.

I went the next day to inform the manager since I was close by and he just didnt care. He didn't care what dish it was or when it happened, didn't even apologize. He just said we could fill out a complaint form in the lobby if we wanted.

177263,2012-12-31,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"My wife and I were there for the opening night of this new Restaurant. Didn't think we'd be able to get a table but when we walked up they were very nice to accommodate us even though it looked fairly full. 

While waiting, we were able to take a look at the decor, people, etc... I personally really liked the clean and hip look of the place and where the tables were in relation to the bar and other parts of the restaurant. The main dining area was slightly elevated from the lounge area, thus creating a separation but was close that it didn't feel like I was disconnected to the bar area where there were a lot of people to watch. It definitely isn't the place if you want a quiet-dinner-for-two, but for my wife and I, it was great.

Once we got seated, we decided to choose multiple small plates so that we can try different things. We had a sushi roll, a noodle dish with duck, crab cake/ball, and some items from the dim sum menu. The food was generally a 3.5 out of 5 for us because it didn't blow us away but we couldn't really say anything too bad about it. It was just what you'd expect at an Asian fusion menu and not much more...

There was one thing that we really didn't like -

1) Maybe because it was the opening night but they had way too many people working on the floor! Usually having enough staff to make sure that you are properly and timely taken care of is key to a good experience. In the case of that night, it was uncomfortably filled with workers where they were everywhere and standing around between tables, along the walls making it very distracting to have so much crowd stand around and walk between the tables. I sure hope that gets adjusted quickly.  With that said, our server, Ryan, was excellent - tried to give our space but was very attentive and informative. 

All in all we would likely return especially if staying at Wynn/Encore.",F-3zYMK3ujbkofKOOZlMxw,1,0,4,nGIOvruznKnvUxkvju-GoQ
191944,2016-01-05,1,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"One of my favorite restaurants. I have eaten here 7 or 8 times. It sets the bar in Las Vegas for its price range. Everything is in-line with a 5 star experience. 

If you have allergies to ANYTHING, they take it so seriously. Do not fret if you have nut or seafood allergies. Your food will NOT be contaminated.

The decor is ornate but not overly gaudy. One of the coolest designs and lighting I've ever seen in a restaurant. The pictures do not do it justice, it's not that bright in there. 

There is a DJ playing some nights who spins music that is cooler than any resident DJ in Vegas. (Deep, Progressive, Future House & Funk). You definitely could get down in this place but you'll be setting the trend, not following it. Most people go here before the club.

Thank God, there are NO TVs. So people are focused on the food, the music, and the conversation. No one staring over you at the dinner table to watch some people throw a ball around.

The service is attentive but not invasive.

I usually order their house salad and the sushi. The sushi always comes out perfectly. It is always presented perfectly. The house salad has a wonderful dressing that I can't quite put my finger on, but I could eat it at every meal.

The service was amazing.  We've come to expect a higher caliber of service in LV, and Andrea's is no exception.  We had a team of people assigned to our table, catering to our every whim.
The food was outstanding as well.  I can personally vouch for the sushi - which was some of the best I've ever experienced.  The other guests at the table had rave reviews for the scallops and vegetable dishes as well.

I came here with a group of 17 on a bachelor party and opted in to a $120 price-fixed menu (before tax, tip and drinks). When people are spending this kind of money you expect quality and top-notch service. We had neither. Not only was the waitress unattentive and came back to get us another round of drinks every 20 minutes or so the food (which comes shared) came about 20 minutes between dishes. The sushi that was served was bland and a plain asparagus roll was one of the three rolls offered. Again for that kind of money you expect more than a sushi roll with just a piece of asparagus in it. The whole meal took roughly three hours and the entire party was unimpressed and $210 poorer.

Our server then insisted we try the NY Strip we ordered three and they could have been the best thing I have smelled coming through a dining room in a very longtime.

The atmosphere is great - it makes me feel....sexy....if a restaurant can do that. 

The staff was very helpful and professional - always makes bland food better. 

Drink menu was on an iPad, which although cool, seemed strange. The place is so dim lit, you could tell who was about to get hammered from the bright iPad screen. I was one that gave in an tried an under-poured martini for $12 - OUCH. 

We ordered the peppers as an appetizer. Just bland, with a burst of spice from the mustard. 

Then I proceeded to order the Duck Lo Mein. 

I was very, very excited to see duck on the menu. When my dish arrived, it was a very large proportion. I almost couldn't finish! But the Lo Mein was so....bland....(like this review?)...that I felt like I could have gotten better at the buffet. The duck in the lo mein did not stand out at all. Was hoping for a burst of flavor, but I was unfortunately let down. 

My partner ordered sushi and dim sum. He said it was good, but had the same reaction...bland.

Really enjoyed the battered black cod with yuzu pepper fries (shoestring) ... some pieces of fish could have been butchered a little bit better (I personally don't like the gray fish fat on any type of fish) and I didn't get any yuzu or pepper flavor on the fries - but that was okay with me.

My husband's scallops were fresh and well prepared, as was the accompanying foie gras - although he pushed around the edamame and farro not being a fan of either ... fingerling potatoes on the side were a bit of a flop.

Menu:
All Steve Wynn restaurants have special menus that categorize what dishes are safe for each food allergy- awesome!

I ordered a dish that's been discontinued, although they should bring it back, it's the best- snap peas, pear and cloud ear. The server was great and asked the kitchen to made it for me anyway, which they did. It was fantastic!

The Seabass.... Oh no. This was terrible. I've never had bad food here, but this was a little pile of rubber. I didn't even eat it. Instead, I indulged in the gluten free fried rice which was really good.

Wine:
Always fantastic, a good menu, the somm was attentive and put it on ice. Surprisingly that's a tough request in some restaurants, but not here. Always top notch wine service and selection.

Ambiance:
We had a private little booth on the side. Always a sexy atmosphere whether in the middle of the room or in a booth.

The waiter so also really helpful as we didn't want to eat meat they recommended a lot of other dishes including plenty of options for my mum who is a vegetarian. You MUST try the crispy rice and tuna - we wish we had have ordered more.

I came to Las Vegas for work and met some colleagues for dinner.  We were staying at the Wynn and wanted a restaurant on the property, so we chose this one. The restaurant is nice - upscale looking and trendy.  Unfortunately the upscale neo-luxe features are a shallow veneer.

We sat down  and waited at least 5 minutes for our server to bring menus.  She dropped them off and then vanished for 15 minutes. She came back and took appetizer orders. I also ordered a beer which took almost 30 minutes to arrive.  This was on  Tuesday night and the restaurant was far from crowded.  The whole meal suffered from inattentive service, and that includes bus boys filling water glasses and cleaning dishes.  Basically the service was terrible.  Like frustratingly bad.  Absolutely not what I expected from such an ambitiously high-end restaurant.  We sat down at 8:35pm and didn't get food until almost 10pm.

The food was ok.  Certainly not bad, but nowhere near the best sushi I have had.  We ordered hamachi appetizers and it was sliced so thin it could have been a parchment..  It was garnished with a crispy onion straight from the supermarket and dripping with some sort of flavored oil.  Not refreshing or clean tasting.  Sashimi was $30 for 3 pieces.  Way too expensive! 

Rolls were between $25 and $30 and comparable to rolls costing half as much at most sushi restaurants. The food was medium quality meaning not bad, but certainly not top of the pack.  Yet the prices were easily the highest I have seen for sushi.  

Most of the dishes had a heavy sugary sauce on them too.

We spent almost $150 per person for food and service worth $35.  And left hungry.  I regularly eat at great Sushi places in both California and New York and I wouldn't go back to Andrea's even if the prices were reasonable.   But considering the price, my advice is to look elsewhere!  There are simply too many good restaurants to overpay for mediocre food and lazy service.",-8xYcHPALKDKLjeH7EG75A,1,0,2,Kh4TOSe5GM0cevsQsUEzZA

We got there a little early, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. If you have a group, I totally recommend the punch bowls....they have about 4 different flavors and are great for sharing (you can get them with glasses to pour individual drinks or these really long straws so everyone can drink from the bowl in the center of the table)!

We ordered our food family style so everyone could try different things. Since, we are locals, we usually go to Kabuto or Haikado for sushi, but the wagyu beef and lobster roll at Andrea's is something that I haven't seen at our local spots! We also had the special cucumber roll, rock shrimp tempura, wagyu beef sliders, a seafood platter, a crispy noodle dish with chicken, and the New York Strip! We told out server that we were ordering for the table, so he was really awesome in helping us select dishes that were easy for us to share! We finished with a tower of 12 mini ice cream cones, which drew a lot of attention when it was being brought through the dining room!

Our server and the guy assisting him were extremely attentive and patient with us. They were really nice and we never had to wait for any anything. 

Andrea's is setting a cool trend with their atmosphere! The lights were dim, the DJ was playing, and everyone in the place was having a great time!

We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party this past weekend, and selected Andrea's as our restaurant of choice for our last night out on Saturday and are so glad we did.  We were seated immediately (party of 10), and immediately helped by Adam who stayed with us throughout the entire meal (3 hours).  As this was our first time to Andrea's, we left it to Adam to select the dishes we should try - and did he rise above our expectations - as did the food!   For starters, we had the sliders, shrimp, sashimi, and waygu tartare.  If you get nothing else - order the waygu tartare.  It will absolutely change your life.

For mains, Adam brought us lobster, waygu filet mignon (thinly sliced on cast iron), sea bass (my favorite), fried rice, and more sushi.  The brussel sprouts were excellent as well.  Dessert was also incredible and very unique.  We had a sampling of their ice creams (japanese style) as well as the marshmallow/chocolate cake mocha tower which they pour several liquors over and light on fire.  It almost as impressive as it is delicious.

Environment:  Andrea's is very hip.  They had a dj playing in the corner, great music.  Nicely decorated.  Music was a little loud, difficult conversation for nine.

Service:  Service was slow.  They didn't have enough menus for everyone.  I am however giving 1 star for the fact that they did separate checks which as a one time server, I know is a total pain.

Food:  Had edamame app, and smoked salmon app.  Both of these were decent.  The edamame had truffle salt, which was pretty amazing.  I had the filet for dinner was was THE WORST FILET I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!  It was awful.  It was so dry, and no flavor.  It was like beef bubble gum.  Others had the miso cod, an noodles which companions said was pretty good... but a $60 filet.. and it was horrible.. so disappointing.

The last kicker was, we had purchased tickets from the hotel concierge to go to Surrender, and the concierge also made reservations for us to go to Andreas. What they didn't mention is if you eat at Andrea's you have a direct entrance into Surrender, we didn't even need the tickets and now they won't refund.  I guess that is more of a complaint for the hotel in general - but still bad none the less.

As a pescaterian 
As an omnivore
and finally...as a vegan.

And I can categorically say, that I enjoyed my meal the most as a vegan. The problem is, I am not willing to spend exorbitant amounts of money for ingredients (vegetables and grains) that simply do not warrant the price tag on the dish. At least I'm not willing to do that on a regular basis. I'm not going to rant about paying $X for a dish that would only cost $Y at home. Obviously, with high-end vegan dining at Andreas (and other similar establishments) you are paying for the experience. 

But with three of us (2 omnivores; 1 vegan), the famous flaming desert, sake, lots of bottled water, two entrees (including one huge shared steak), and plenty of appetizers/sides, our bill came to over $450.  As much as I loved my dishes, I don't know that I'd be willing to spend any portion of amount on a semi-vegan ""experience"" very often.

BUT..... I have to admit the food was outstanding. 
Two dishes were exceptional: KALBI PORTABELLO MUSHROOM and the VEGAN SPICY TOFU roll.

I was not as moved by: the BOK CHOY and the GINGER KABOCHA GYOZA

VEGAN SPICY TOFU ROLL: Everyone who tasted the roll --all fish/sushi lovers--said that this was one of the best rolls they'd eaten in a long time. The variety of textures and flavors in the roll would satisfy any sushi eater looking for a slightly lighter fare. We contemplated ordering a second roll for the table after devouring the first.  

I am a fan of the food that Andrea's is putting out and I thoroughly enjoy their decor. I wish they'd do something about the music, but maybe that's just a ""me"" thing. This place makes you feel like the meal is special from the moment you walk in the door. And the personalized chopsticks will tickle any patron new to the establishment.

The staff heard (somehow) that it was our anniversary and comped us nifty little ""cake pops"" for dessert.  Pricey? Yes, but it's Vegas, right?

Delicious appetizers, prepared well. Ingredients must be top quality for them to taste this good. Particularly loved the spicy fried chicken. Really crunchy with a very well-balanced sauce of sweet and spicy goodness. The steak entree with wasabi demi-glace was out of this world. Flavorful, tender beef, cooked to perfect medium rare. I would go back again and again to eat this food, if not for.....

The crappy service. Let's start with the fact that my water glass was refilled only once without me having to ask or request it. And then there is the menu. Is this a restaurant you're supposed to share or not? It's not clear. And the server didn't explain. I ordered a steak and when everything was delivered, it was all put into the middle of the table. When I looked puzzled at this, the steak was put in front of me. But they didn't bring me a side plate to have some of the side dishes that are clearly meant to be shared. My choice was to either dump spoonfuls of it into the wasabi demi glace that was on my cast-iron oval steak platter, or eat it directly from the shared plates. So I improvised by removing the plate from underneath the cast iron platter that the pork belly appetizer was served on. It was very bizarre to be at a table where some people were sharing and some not. If the server had explained, that could have helped. Or if those of us at the table were able to effectively communicate with one another in advance. But that was difficult because...

The dining room was loud. So much louder than it needed to be. And the boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp soundtrack is more appropriate for the nearby dance club than for a fine dining restaurant. Lively atmosphere is great, but somehow here it veered more appropriate for cocktail party than for sit-down dining.

I had such high hopes going in. And the kitchen didn't disappoint at all. They're pros. But too much thoughtlessness in the front of house. One last note on that. Coffee was delivered. But it took at least three more minutes for the cream and sugar to be delivered. And I had to ask for it. What the heck?

I'm sure I'll be staying at the Encore again. But this was so disappointing that Andrea's won't be visited again. They could learn a lot from the front of house at Mizumi.",in81DegShFr_S8MhLdK80g,1,0,2,vIOUxG9wQjt-50qGss36Qg

They were alll amazing! Decadent flavor yet you can taste the natural sweetness and texture of the very fresh fish.

I chose the sea bass and it was moist and flavorful.  My hubby ordered the black cod and it was also delicious. BUT... I thought the prices were outrageous. The dish was $40 a la carte. Sides were over $10. The cocktails were $16. 

We presented our server with a Yelp offer for 30% off drinks for locals, but they did not take it off our bill. Even after asking about it, the server insisted it had been removed but it was not noted on the receipt nor did the figures add up to any discount. In addition, they charged our party a special fee for the group. Plus the expected automatic 18% gratuity. 

Normally, I tip well for decent service but the service at this place was horrible, especially considering all these fees they charged us. It took our server 15 minutes to bring our cocktails. When we were ready for the check, it took 20 minutes for them to bring it. The servers were hardly around nor did they check on the table much.

Only three of us ate, however, so we didn't opt for such a large - albeit tempting - dessert. Our birthday girl had to make due with a chocolate globe filled with cake and ice cream.  I just saw a video of this online, so when I saw Andrea's had one on the menu, I knew we had to get it. The server poured hot chocolate over it, and the globe melted away to reveal the goodies inside.  Entertainment + food!

Everything was wonderful and different.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned, the cod was sweet, and the sea bass was herby and refreshing.  The green beans were a nice base to the meal, and the crispy sprouts were oily and salty - a great contrast to everything else.

Upon leaving we used the restroom, and the only available stall was broken.  Pardon the visual, but my friend and I both peed into a toilet that didn't flush, so we were just adding our touches to what everyone else left behind.  Yum!

The speciality rolls were the highlight of the meal. I really liked the yellow tail... It had some herb in it which was just so strangely magical in the roll. Wow! Everyone else enjoyed the special cucumber roll more. But  I'm just little wary of rolls without seaweed wrap..

Had the seared sea scallops with garlic noodles. Lots and lots of noodles but no scallops to be found.

The food was good and seeing that it is a fine dining restaurant in Encore, for the prices I was actually surprised at the portions. Many of the dishes are meant to be shared and this is exactly what we did. It was plenty of food for me though my husband probably could have used one more dish ;).

We had the fried pork pot stickers, garlic noodles with scallops, the shrimp tempura roll and the fun little dessert trio.

Everything was tasty, the scallops were tender and not sandy, and you could taste the individual ingredients (nothing covered in too much sauce or oil). 

The drinks were unique, really yummy and comparably priced to other Strip bars/restaurants. 

I liked the vibe of the place, decked out in mostly white with a lot of high top tables, wait staff in all black, lots of space and iPads to review and order your drinks. But among all this hipness (which I typically may not like) the DJ played an interesting mix of music (70s, 80s, 90s). For me this was the exact foil needed to make sure it wasn't too hip.

The bar area was roomy and the whole place comfortable enough that I would definitely go back just to hang out and have drinks.

I gave it only 3 stars because I've had the same quality and creativeness in Asian cuisine at other establishments for much less cost. I've experienced it once, I probably won't go back for the food.

- I've been to Andreas several times for the Cosmopolitan Connections group and love the ambiance
- The poolside view right outside of Andreas is amazing (feel like I'm in a music video or something)

Cons:
- It's a little hard to get to if you've never been there before. You have to walk through the hotel (smells like smoke) to get to Andreas. I always feel like plugging my nose every time I'm on my way to here

Mother's Day well spent that's for sure! My girlfriends and I left the kiddos in the hands of their Daddies and headed to Vegas for the weekend. We wanted one dinner where we could get dressed up, eat a hot meal, have a few drinks and savor every single moment of our night. We chose Andrea's and I thank our lucky stars!

From the moment we sat down the smells tantalized the senses. The drink menu and Sommelier on staff had us ordering more drinks than any of us initially intended to. We didn't regret even one as they were all wonderful. Although we'd browsed the menu prior to arriving, once we were there seeing food pass our table, smelling it all, we couldn't decide. The menu truly had something for all of us (sushi lovers, sushi haters, vegetarian, only eats chicken, doesn't want anything fried, etc) and boy did we order a lot! I don't quite recall all that we ordered, but I do know the sounds coming from our table while we ate probably made surrounding tables blush. Some of us tried bites of others choices and I can honestly everything was sensational.

The service was flawless. The wait staff floated in and out of our space removing plates, bringing new dishes, filling glasses, etc without us even noticing. 

I'm pretty sure we floated out on clouds of happiness and splendor, although that could have been the drinks too (wink). Either way I cannot wait to visit Andrea's next time I am in Vegas and I strongly suggest you don't pass it by either!",xvPKsTGO5GljzRTGc9VC_g,0,0,5,1RXcuI9oYz04IMW8rZK6qg

04/07/17 Anniversary Dinner

After much research on potential dining options in Vegas for our anniversary, we decided on Andrea's.  Previous reviews had lead us to believe that we were to be ""wowed"" by an extravagant and memorable dinner on our special day.  Rather, we were ""wowed"" by the lack of service from staff and poor ambience.  

Our waiter promptly came to our table and answered all questions we had about their menu.  The ""Happy Anniversary"" chopsticks were thoughtful as well.

The food:
Tuna and Crispy Rice - 5/5
Diver Sea Scallops - 3/5
Saikyo Miso Black Cod - 5/5
Coconut Creamed Spinach - 4/5
Chocolate Orange Dessert (cannot recall name) - 5/5, added a point for ""Happy Anniversary.""

Note: the runner did a fantastic job of describing our food choices. Restaurant busser was prompt.

Wine:
Nice bottle list, but don't bother ordering.  The sommelier presented the wine and dropped the cap/cork (found it under my wife's feet)...things happen, not a big deal.  What bothered me more, was the fact that our glasses were twice empty for 10+ min periods and the bottle was out of reach (contemplated getting up and refilling our glasses, but felt it was inappropriate).  Though, the neighboring tables with groups of 6+ people had no problem with their glasses being filled.  We ended our meal still having 1/3 of a bottle of wine...

Ambience:
If you're looking for a romantic dinner, this is not the place for you. This is a trendy, hip, ""sexy and social atmosphere.""  I fully understand that a restaurant cannot control the conversations coming from the surrounding tables (incredibly inappropriate, to which I will not describe and loud enough for other tables to hear), but they can certainly control seating arrangements.  For instance, when a couple requests a dinner for two and include ""Anniversary"" on the reservations, please don't seat them between parties 6 and 12 people.  

Based on our experience, I do not think that we would recommend Andrea's to friends visiting Vegas.  There are so many high-end restaurants that I would not suggest one that fails to ""wow.""  Our experience was more 2.5 than 3.",vVeFCKZG4nKXSd-d50idPA,1,0,3,FbJVxoO4nEaBTNTAxRSZYw

The salad with crispy onion strings, the cucumber avocado sushi and a chicken dish. We finished with the signature cake pops.

Miso Cod - small but yum
Tempura/spicy tuna roll- always a winner
broccoli side - makes eating your veggies a breeze
salmon tartare- preeetty.. oh. and it tastes good

We also ordered the Wagyu beef & lobster roll. My friend and I each had a piece and looked at each other funny. We felt it was either under-seasoned or just an odd combo. My friend had another piece just to check (so we ate 3 pieces of an 8 piece roll). She called over the waiter who got the manager and the blunt wonder that she is, stated flatly ""We tried this roll and it's not very good..."" (wow. thanks Lauren). without skipping a beat the manager said very charmingly (new word) ""What can I get you instead?"" we asked for a roll suggestion and bam one plate gone another in its place (the aforementioned delicious spicy tuna roll mmm.) long story short (too late) I appreciated the classy way our situation was handled.

1827292,2017-04-22,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"Have dined here numerous occasions on a comp dinner prior to going to Surrender Nightclub, and have always thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The fish tanks of alcohol, endless edamame/selected entrees, always made for a perfect meal prior to a long night of intoxication. 

I am big on trying new upcoming foods and was ecstatic to hear Andrea's at the Wynn was going to be first in Las Vegas to carry the Impossible Burger!! We headed there on Thursday April 19th, excited and eager to give these products a try!!

The Impossible Burger is a vegan burger. It is ""made entirely from plants; but made to look, smell, cook, and taste like ground beef but with a much smaller environmental footprint...The Impossible Burger uses about 75% less water, generates about 87% fewer greenhouse gases and requires about 95% less land than conventional ground beef from cows. It's also produced without hormones, antibiotics, artificial flavors and is cholesterol-free."" 

Going into the meal, I was extremely skeptical among my excitement. I am not a heavy carnivore, and tread on the idea of being a vegetarian/vegan myself. I am extremely conscious of where my meat/vegetables/food are sourced from and always opt for fresh, organic, non-GMO options when available. When I look for vegan/vegetarian alternatives specifically, I look for fresh natural ingredients used, over any GMO/soybased alternatives. 

We decided to order two out of the three Impossible Burger items on the menu. We would have ordered all three menu items, but were mislead by the menu title (we could not find it on the menu till reading the full descriptions; title labeled ""Ma Po Tofu""). We ordered 1.) the Impossible Burgers as Sliders, and 2.) the Thai Crispy Rice Cups. The Sliders came as three sizzling sliders, topped with frisée, kimchee, pickles, kalbi sauce and kochujang aioli. The Thai crispy rice cups were made with Impossible Burger, along with mint, cilantro, chili, onion, ginger and peanuts served on miniature lettuce beds. 

The Impossible Burgers as sliders come cooked medium, and visually I was pleasantly stunned. The sliders looked and mimicked the moisture/visual texture real hamburger meat portrays. They were extremely tasty, and the texture had a snap/bite similar to hamburger meat. The coloring and flavor profile were extremely accurate, and the combination of flavors on top of the sliders made the entire dish phenomenal. We decided to take the third slider off the bun, and removed all the toppings to see how the patty would taste stand alone. Though you would not be blinded into thinking it was hamburger meat, it had a completely unique flavor profile unlike soy/typical vegan alternatives. The patty was a somewhat sweeter version of hamburger meat, without the fattiness/iron profile within the mouth-feel you get in a traditional hamburger meat patty.

The Thai Crispy Rice Cups came second, and did not disappoint! This dish could make me vegan! SO DELICIOUS. It was crunchy and savory with wonderful umami flavor. We ate the dish in its entirety before realizing we should have dissected a cup to taste the meat stand-alone again. These beat out any meat-based lettuce cups I have had prior, and stood mountains over the tempeh versions I have had in previous locations as a vegan alternative. 

As entrees we decided on the Five Spice Garlic Lobster Tempura, and the Vegetable Crispy Pan Fried Noodles. The Five Spice Garlic Lobster Tempura was freshly breaded, and you could taste how fresh the lobster was. It lacked proper sauce and was lackluster compared to the All-Star vegan appetizers. The lobster was so fresh that we did rip off the additional tempura breading to consume all the delicious meat. The dish would benefit with a dipping sauce or additional vegetables to accompany. 

Next came the Vegetable Crispy Pan Fried Noodles. These were a huge portion, and the noodles left on top of the dish were perfectly crispy. The dish was over-sauced causing the majority of the noodles to be very soggy versus suggestively crispy.The sauce had a great savory flavor profile, just excessively sauced for my liking. I would order this dish with the sauce on the side to maximize the enjoyment. 

Lastly came our cappuccinos, and the ultimate dessert. I am still dreaming about this dessert, it was that good! The Mount Fiji is offered on the menu, but suggested for a much larger party (6ppl). There is also a limited Mini Mount Fiji, perfectly gluttonous for two ppl. This dessert has it all. A+ Presentation, Flavor Profile and that ""wow"" factor. Similar to a Baked Alaska, it really gets the whole room intrigued on the presentation. Showstopper, and great way to end a really delicious meal..

All I can say overall is wow! Great Experience and so excited to see where the Impossible Burger product goes in LV. Really happy this product brought us to Andrea's and showed us this restaurant is much more then just a destination for a delicious pre-club comp'd meal.

- Seared Foie Gras is a must. We even contemplated ordering a second one but had to refrain ourselves to sase room for dessert
- Tuna on Crispy Rice - I would come back for just this dish alone. So simple yet so perfectly paired together and the tuna was so fresh!
- Pork Sisim - Make sure to stir it so that the egg is dispersed. This was flavorful but when the waiter delivered it he mentioned that they were Pig Ears and I just couldn't get that out of my head. I guess I am not as adventurous as I thought I was. Husband enjoyed it though!
- Wagyu Sliders were heavenly. The meat just melts in your mouth and I loved the shoe string fries that they were served with.
- Mt. Fuji Dessert - The presentation is WORTH IT! We were stuffed and concerned about paying $48 for this huge dessert when our server informed us that it came in a smaller size for $28. The small is still large enough to serve 4-6 people so we barely made a dent in it. I am glad we got to experience the awesome presentation of this but some bites were heavily flavored with the bacardi 151, and the chocolate coating made it a little too rich. We ended up just eating the inside which contained the 10 layer devil food cake.

Coming here was a friendly reminder of how lucky I am to have great sushi for a reasonable price where I live. Nothing that came out was something I couldn't get at a place near my home at a quarter of the price.

I like the way our waiter proposed we order, basically we would order 1-2 small plates to share and they brought them out as they were ready. We ended up having the tuna-crispy rice, hamachi sashimi, ramen sliders and coconut spinach. I have a big appetite and sometimes end up with a huge bill at a fancy restaurant trying to get full, but we filled up fast as you had time to really enjoy each dish and even though the portions are not huge, they were certainly satisfying. They had a good beer selection with what I would call appropriate beers for the food, I had a Belgian pale ale that went really well with everything. Wife had a Manhattan that she said was amazing. For dessert we had the orange ball, the presentation alone was so unique I was already impressed.

We ventured to Andrea's last weekend while in Vegas.  We had been to the old SWITCH so were interested to see what they had done with the place.  SOOOO much better than SWITCH.  The restaurant and bar itself is gorgeous.  I am not a fan of everything white typically as it reminds me of Florida or my Grandma's house, however, this mostly white theme was done tastefully.

We opted to eat at the bar as we normally do even though we had reservations (I would probably suggest reservations as it was pretty packed).  The bartenders were super friendly and accomodating even though they were obviously slammed.

I honestly can't recall the names of what we had, but we had a few things to share and everything was sooooo good!  However, we probably ingested a little too much tempura as we felt SOOOO full for a good 2 hours after leaving, but quite happy.

We will definitely return to Andrea's on our next visit and will be sure to stay late to check out the DJ and the later crowd!!!",EQqor5tO_1L8lseEhpDYPA,0,0,4,OX6W9P81BONV2aFvToYvBw

I would like to add that the impossible burger is a must try. As a meat-eater I was certainly confused when the slider wasn't rubbery and didn't have that FAKE meat aftertaste. The texture was very close and the taste is..like a diluted burger. Like someone rubbed a real meat patty on the impossible burger. Chow fung noodles were delicious and traditional. We also had their ice cream flight (apparently new on the dessert menu).

2053646,2018-05-27,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"As a part-time local in Las Vegas I and my brother Dan ate in this restaurant about a dozen times since January, bringing friends as guests because I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian menu has quite a few offerings- especially the meatless burger known as the Impossible Burger. Saturday night, May 13, 2018, having made a reservation many weeks before for 6:00 PM when the restaurant officially opens for dinner. That night I had a reservation for two. I checked in with the greeter at 5:58 PM and she said it would be a minute or two before the restaurant opened. A few minutes later a group of eight came in after me and they were immediately seated. Then a group of four came in and were immediately seated even though they told the greeter they had a reservation for 6 :30 and would rather eat at 6:00OPM. Then another group of six who came in after me were seated. Still there were the other thirty plus tables open and my brother and I were not seated.

I went over to the greeter and asked if there was a problem and it was ten minutes after my reservation and I and my brother were still not seated. At first she, a thin young lady ignored me like she was thinking about something and after about 40 seconds she looked up and said there was no problem as the people who came in after me had ""registered"" before me even though I arrived on time for my scheduled reservation and most of the restaurant tables were left open. The greeter should be disciplined for when she still had not seated me by two minutes later my brother and I walked out and went to another restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. Andrea's has lost a good local customer as I and my brother Dan will never ever return to this restaurant because of their poor customer service. They have lost a frequent customer. Suggest you never go to this restaurant because of the idiot greeter. Employing someone like that indicates very poor management from the top who cares not one wit about their customers as they believe there is an endless supply of tourists coming to Las Vegas.

Still debating whether to call the Encore Hotel general manager to let him know how poor is the customer service at one of their supposedly excellent restaurant though I doubt that the hotel really cares.",kb_Jj7yuuB6Cx0UylhUacw,1,0,1,oluBXca0E0z_cw8Lkxt1HQ

I'm a local myself & I've been here on three different occasions & I can't get enough! I did my usual check in & I squealed when I received a coupon for 30% off drinks for vegas locals! The staff was happy to honor my discount :)

This review is a combination of my last two visits!

I headed to the bar since I was early for the reservation. I always go straight to the signature cocktails. I ordered The Lulu, which was awesome! It wasn't busy at the bar but it took quite a while for my card to be taken to swipe. Me & my girlfriends got a booth like we requested. They are very intimate & fit up to four people. I got the same server, Kyle as I did on my last visit. He recognized me which is always cool. Best server award goes to him! He gives so much detail about the menu & how to go about ordering. Family style is whats recommended & it is the best idea. Everything is shared at the table & everyone gets to try all the items. Through each section he pointed out some popular items & we ordered ALL of them! The items we ordered were the Rock Shrimp Tempura, ""Smoked"" Wagyu Beef Tataki (my absolute favorite & the presentation is the best), Saikyo Miso Black Cod (wow!), Sliced Prime New York Strip, Crispy Broccoli, Shrimp Tempura + Spicy Tuna roll (8 pieces). We also ordered other items like Tuna Tataki Salad, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chinese Sausage + Pineapple Fried Rice, Crab Fried Rice, & the Duck Confit Lo Mein which were all great as well. I ordered the Asian Pear from the cocktail list. It's a woman's drink for sure!

I hope it was in your game plan to save room for dessert cause you would be missing out if you didn't! Flaming Mt. Fuji! It's large, it's chocolatey & it's on fire! The four of us girls couldn't finish it of course. It's such a fun dessert to share with your friends. Devil's food cake & mousse inside with a toasted marshmallow outside that they pour Bacardi 151 over & light up! To accompany my dessert, I ordered an Espresso Martini. So far, the best one yet. 

Andrea's is a good time. The room is beautiful, the staff is on point, the service is outstanding & the food is phenomenal. It's the perfect place to get the night started before heading out to the Wynn or Encore's best nightclubs.",TvUe4KBLF87f6h0gAG8Jxg,1,1,5,e68nd6Q0qhr2Qu3G6Q42VA

Perhaps I'm biased because I have a more Asian palette, but everyone at the table really enjoyed the Lettuce Cups and Mapo Tofu.

Overall great meal - everything else we tried was equally delicious. We tried the hamachi sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the black cod. For dessert, we had cake pops and shaved ice. Even the midwesterners at our table whom have never had shaved ice, enjoyed it! Lastly, the wine recommendation the Som gave us was great! Surprisingly low priced and paired well with our selections.

The new york strip!! (served over wasabi demiglace)  The NY Strip is slowly becoming one of my favorite steaks.  This dish is not served like a typical steak, it's served in a log shape, and sliced into about 10 pieces.  The ends were fatty (didn't even eat them) but the rest of the slices were cooked to medium perfection.  Taking each piece and dipping it in the the demiglace, oh myy!!!

- took at least 45 minutes to deliver appetizers
- one if the entrees had to be sent back... And we were still charged for it

YES, that happened! This gave me time to chat with Omar, the charming and well versed bartender. Cathy C came in a few moments later and after discussing mutual love for Italian Nutella, the Birthday Girl thoroughly enjoyed her Red Velvet Martini. Omar introduced me (by sample) and in a fabulous dry martini to the rare, limited edition Gold Beluga Russian vodka. We were off to a great start.

Cathy put up the whole menu on her review, so I'll cover my dishes and thoughts on the exceptional service and beautiful space. The hamachi sashimi was light with a little kick and a perfect start to the meal. Though usually not a fan of cooked salmon, their medium cooked preparation with julienned veggies was very good. Since our hostess, Amanda M works at this unique, upscale location, she filled me in on the delightful smoke aroma that would occasionally waft by. They smoke their own salmon, covered and when presented and uncovered the fragrant smoke fills the area. Your lox with fancypants presentation, if you will. Love it. Want it. Must return to have it! 

Was kind of full by dessert, but went with the Cake Pop Trio. The Yuzu was delicious and I traded Michele my Red Velvet for a mini coconut ice cream cone. Eric R was happy to eat my third vegan chocolate something pop. Totally down with vegan, but chocolate I can take or leave. Crazy, I know. 

So, the have a ""Music Chef"" errr DJ? Spinning some cool tunes which only adds to the whole dinner club vibe. It is a beautifully designed room, clean edges, mood lighting. No offense Steve, your wife is hot and all BUT the giant chryon light show of just her eyes facing the dining room from behind the bar was a tad creepy. But, his hotel, joint is named for her, so I guess having her eyes on the menu, too, is okie dokie with him. 

The service was awesome: water glasses were constantly refilled, each dish was explained and presented with pride and professionalism. The waitress went out of her way to make sure a few guests were able to avail themselves of the 30% off drinks for locals Yelpy deal. Cathy's dessert was presented with ""Happy Birthday Cathy"" written in chocolate sauce; and they were accommodating of requests for different flavors on desserts. 

So 4* for now, have a feeling when I order from the standard menu, I'll bump it up. Easily worth the $50.13 RW price and great supporting Three Square.

We had a few sushi rolls that were quite tasty and beautifully prepared, as well as the lobster tempura, which was just spicy enough to deliver a kick. We also had the brussels (excellent but could have been crispier) and some really well-prepared fried rice.

i went with a group of yelpers for restaurant week and I'm definitely glad I did. the place is beautiful with great ambiance. All the lines of the place are clean cut and it is quite the trendy decor.  They have good music playing and we got good entertainment speculating on the couple next to us we claim were on their first date...lol.....people watching was great! 
The service was excellent as they kept our water glasses full and were attentive to what we asked for.  They answered questions and worked well together as a team.  
For the appetizer I got the chicken potstickers, and they were good and light and the dipping sauce had a kick but wasn't overly spicy.  Definitely needed the dipping sauce though for flavor.  Next I got the filet with the hollandaise on the side.  It came with potatoes on the side as well.  Now the meat was cooked well and tender but needed more seasoning so definitely had to use the hollandaise sauce.  I like my filets and usually I can eat them without the sauce and be quite satisfied.  Next came the ice cream trio.  I had coconut yogurt, sake cherry and pistachio honey.  I traded the yogurt with Christie O. for her red velvet cake pop.  The sake cherry was the best of the bunch but I love pistachio usually.  Thanks Christie for trading though as I usually am not a cake pop fan and this place makes them great!  Everyone at the table got different flavors though and as far as I knew we didn't get a choice. 
I didn't drink as I was going straight to work but the drinks did look fabulous.  
I did like this place and would recommend it, the fried rice varieties at the table did look great and the salmon on ice presentation looked great and I would like to try to that too.  So I would go back and get the regular menu items.

The shrimp tempura ($14) and soft-shell crab ($16) sushi rolls were very tasty; I would order sushi over the listed appetizers (or ""Table Shares"").  Sushi rolls are lovely and nicely-portioned so you get a better bang for your buck.

The miso black cod ($36) was a solid choice, as was the braised pork belly ($32).  The pork belly was deceptively light and not at all greasy.  The listed sides (e.g., smoked bacon fried rice) did not appear appealing and sounded incredibly fatty.

For dessert the mochi sampler was relatively light, particularly compared to the peanut butter brittle.  I would get the mochi to share as they come in several flavors (red bean, green tea, mango, and vanilla).

Drinks are expensive and may be watered-down, depending on which you order.  Skip the Moscow Mule.

We ordered hamachi appetizer, two steak entrees, and two salmon entrees. The wait between the appetizer and entrees was bearable since we ordered sides. I will admit we do eat quite fast but we waited more than 20 minutes between our appetizers and the entrees which made no sense because the restaurant had just opened the hour before and only four tables were seated.The restaurant was not full but we waited patiently. After our entrees were finished we waited past 40 minutes for our ice cream dessert. I didn't understand why he did not check in with us or why there was such a long wait for then to scoop ice cream into tiny cones. As soon as they gave us te ice cream I asked for the check. Whilst looking at the check the manager decided to check in on us and ask if there was anything he could do since we waited for so long. Why did you ask if my bill was already paid? What should I do at this point? Seriously guys? I hope a manager ends up contacting us back. I don't think this is acceptable even if I am a patron dining off of the restaurant week menu. Why did you decide to participate if you weren't going to treat all your paying customers alike? There were more than enough servers to accommodate us but there wasn't enough staff to cover the kitchen? Please help me understand. I spent $360 for dinner for four and I did not get the same service.

We stumbled upon the menu while planning an evening exploring the Wynn, and we were searching yelp for a place with Vegan options. We didn't have reservations, the place was packed on a Monday, but they were able to sit us at a bistro table in the bar area. Now, this was the first table by the host stand, which typically would make for a not so great dining experience. But from start to finish we had great service, amazing food and we have zero complaints. 

We were greeted immediately and before we could even ask for vegan options we were presented with an entire vegan and vegetarian menu. You read that right, each table is presented with an epic separate veggie menu, no ""let me ask the chef"" with an eye roll or ""maybe a salad with no dressing"" after asking. We were in heaven. 

We started with the shishito peppers and crispy ginger gyoza. Then split the vegan spicy veggie roll and the impossible burger sliders. Finished with a vegan cookie dough cake pop. Shared a bottle of yummy bubbly. Holy. Crap. 

Now, the impossible burgers definitely lived up to the hype- we could have devoured about 40 of them. Surprisingly, the most delicious thing we ate was the vegan spicy roll! It had been so long since we had a veggie sushi roll that had actual flavor and different textures that we about passed out from pure happiness. 

So the moral of this story. If you are a vegan in Vegas, and you want a more upscale dining experience that doesn't involve manipulating a menu or asking the chef to make something up then Andrea's is highly recommended.",Os90ci4u6gq60EbqdHsWJg,2,1,5,IyG4TRBbjyovvu8prbHCPw

Her husband called in advance to reserve a table and inform them it was her birthday... apparently the table was not ready when they arrived and they had to wait an additional 30 minutes...  My friend mentioned to me when they waited at the bar the bartender didn't even acknowledge them. He was to busy flirting with some girls. 

   Anyways, then they got seated and we arrived just in time.. our waiter was Daniel. He was so friendly and recommended the best dishes and drinks to order. Since I'm a big salmon lover but wanted to try something else he brought four mini samplers of it for us to try. I was impressed by that and it was good. The drinks came out and the food came out like like 45min later... 

  The main reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because we all enjoyed the dishes. However the customer service is horrible. Daniel starting off good, then peace out where is he? Looks like he was done for the night. I counted 11 waiters and not once did they come if we needed another drink or if it was time to clear plates etc. They were all too busy chatting to each other. It took awhile for even receiving the check. The worst part is my friend never got sang happy bday or a little dessert. That was the main reason! 

   Her husband eventually went to look for someone to share the experience. I guess the guy (manager) simply said sorry to hear that and walked away. Later he found us at the bar outside. He asked us if we had plans or would like another drink... We told him we were already on the guest list to Intrigue and that's where we planned on going next. He made sure we didn't have to make line and me and my friend would get a complimentary drink. I guess that was nice in his part for that but it still won't change the service you will receive when you come to eat here.

2972403,2018-05-27,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"This was truly next level stuff! I was expecting great food and service when coming to Vegas, yet this place not only met but exceeded my expectations. Sure, not everything was perfect, but that which was more than made up for it. 

Everything, starting with the food and ending with the service was on point. They pulled out all the stops, which was especially surprising considering I was here on the package including a ticket to Le Rêve (review coming soon). This package included everything, even gratuities!

P.S. If you want to see Le Rêve, call for the package, it is absolutely worth it.

In terms of flavors, I have to once again reference B.B. King. I am told the man could play three notes that could bring you to tears. This is the case here: dishes are small and uncomplicated, but they play just the right notes to make your taste buds sing. 

I can't remember too many specifics, but here is what I do remember:

+ Salmon Sashimi - Quality of the fish was amazing. Fish is a delicate animal. Sauces and marinades can greatly enhance the flavor, but it is incredibly easy to overdo it. This is what I especially liked about this is that it wasn't drenched in sauce. You had the option to try the salmon in pure form and spread the sauce as you wanted. The little touch of green was also nice, especially for me, as a person who is always screaming about balance. 

+ Hamachi - Even though the fish lays on a small bed of sauce, I did not find it too overwhelming. However, in fairness, I must say I found the flavor a little astringent. The flavors were there, certainly, but they didn't really work for me. Also, what's with the peanut? it seems a little extra in my opinion.

+ Five Spice Calamari - I really liked the different interpretation of this dish. All the calamari I've had previously was breaded and fried. Here, it was far purer. However, this dish was a little too delicate for my taste. The flavors of the calamari and greens were allowed to shine, but I found myself asking what these five spices were. A pinch more spice and spritz more sauce/dressing would have done this dish wonders. 

+ Miso Black Cod - Now back to things I enjoyed more! Unfortunately, this is also where my memory becomes a little more imperfect. Everything in this dish went well, the flavors, marinades, and combination of textures. My only critique is the rather large leaves of bibb lettuce. I'm just personally not a fan of large leaves in a dish.

+ Pork Belly Poutine - I've had pork belly prepared two ways before here. I've had them fried (seasoned with S&P only) and braised in all sorts of sauces. Frying/grilling gives a nice crispness to the dish, whereas braising makes it much softer and more delicate. Here, you had the best of both worlds. It has some of that crispness but at the same time that delicate flavor of braising. The poutine was also extremely delicate and flavorful, as was the sauce!

Bravo! When I return to Vegas, I'll happily bring a decent chunk of my paycheck to eat from the regular menu.",Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ,1,0,5,DRdy3M9hnWeR2N4WZcRTAg

I planned a suprise bachlorette weekend in Vegas for my bestfriend and I wanted to have every detail planned, including meals. Being vegan - it's hard to find places I can take my omni friends but I found out that the owner of the Wynn hotels is a vegan himself so every place in his hotel offers a seperate vegan menu (YAY!). 

We got dolled up and arrived for our 6:30 reservation. It was a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty at that time. We sat at the bar beforehand and ordered a cocktail from their  ipad menu. Our server was SO attentive and sweet. I wish I remembered her name. The service was unreal - SO accomodating, which I'm not used to. 

We ordered the truffle sea salt edamame (OMG SO GOOD), the vegan chicken lettuce wraps (that sauce is unreal), my friend ordered the pan-seared chicken breast (she said it was the best she's ever had), the Gardein chicken entree (can't even begin to explain how in love I was), and shared a side of the vegan smashed potatoes with spicy aoili. We ordered a vegan chocolate chip cake pop for each of us for dessert, along with the vegan tart.

Everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. From start to finish it was on point. The flavors are incredible and it was presented beautifully. We couldn't stop raving about it.

We ordered the edamame for the table which was coated with a truffle salt. The truffle flavor was a nice touch for the edamame. It set it apart from just a standard edamame starter. 

I also had the beef tartar appetizer, it was served with a qual egg yolk in top. The beef was fresh and full of flavor. Once the qual egg yolk was mixed it pushed the flavor to the next level. 

For dinner I had the New York strip streak in a wasabi Demi glaze. This was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The sauce was amazing. I couldn't get enough of it.

For the second round it was a salad plate I promise you enough for two bites per girl in our party. Oh and the sushi?? LOL one roll of avocado and asparagus roll and another of spicy tuna that tasted old -- AVOCADO AND ASPARAGUS REALLY? As if I went to Vons and grabbed a ready made sushi plate .

Main course you ask??? Salmon (delicious) or Chicken (dried and disgustingly salty) but that was it! Just a piece of salmon or chicken nothing else on the plate.

Dessert- Cake pops.... Really? Whatever 


Oh and the atmosphere? Felt like an overcrowded cafeteria, waiters kept hitting my chair no matter how much I pushed myself in. And no I'm not a chubby girl so I was pretty annoyed.

Did nothing special for a bachelorette either so I don't know what the point of it was.

Never again! Sushi Samba in Vegas is MUCH BETTER!

CHERRY ON TOP!!!! They kept taking our plates away WHILE WE WERE STILL TRYING TO ENJOY THEM. We had a few sushi pieces left and they came and grabbed them LIKE OK???? Seriously!? Lmao at least ask if we're done.",QyA5x4UiGalPocwEt3_Log,1,0,2,lLMdowzOHbjsqkgo0p97Wg

The waiters stand along side the walls at all times just to be available whenever you need them. It is pricey for sure but you are getting every bit of what you pay for. For instance my Filet mignon was $60 (the most I have ever paid for filet mignon) but it was the most tender, best flavored and cooked to perfection for my liking that I have ever had. It came with a trio of delicious sauces which it didn't even need because it was so good. We also had the crispy brussel sprouts, the fried mashed potatoes with thai curry sauce, the beef and shrimp fried rice, and the Ramen sliders.  Besides the filet mignon I have to say that the Ramen sliders were amazing and totally different than anything I'd had before. The ramen was  cooked and used as the buns on the slider and it was a really cool and delicious dish....brought back memories if you use to eat raw Ramen as a kid only this is not raw.  The drinks were all very tasty.  It has a huge menu to choose from sushi, steak and seafood, pasta dishes, etc. Best restaurant I have been to in awhile.  Everything was tasty.

Andrea's is such a beautiful and sophisticated restaurant.
When we arrived we got seated immediately for a table of 19.
It was a comp dinner so entrees were selected. 

We had two huge fish tanks of alcohol with a pour spout for the table. 
First to come out was steamed edamame sprinkle with a little salt (delicious).
Next were three different rolls of sushi, followed by the main entree. They brought out crispy pieces of chicken paired with chow mein. Everything was really tasty. 

For dessert my friends had something special planned for me. They brought out two different signature desserts. And one of my friends had a huge Minnie customized cake made for me. One of the desserts was a chocolate frosted mountain cake that they pour alcohol on and set it on fire. It is definitely a must if you go here. The next one was a delicate shaved ice with syrup and fresh fruit, underneath a dry ice display. Both desserts tasted fantastic. As for my cake we did not get to cut into it.

Feels a little like dining in a dance club, but the food was excellent.  I ordered from the vegan/vegetarian menu.  I loved the gardein lettuce wraps - so good, I could eat that every day!  I also had their most popular vegetarian roll.  I forget the name, but it had crunchy veggies with a spicy vegan sauce.  Boyfriend liked his sashimi and spicy scallops which had a solid kick.  They had good wine selections, and a very friendly sommelier.  We were assigned two servers, which seemed to help speed things along on a very busy night.

You will most likely dine alongside a rather interesting clientele - interesting to me, at least, coming from Seattle where your dining out attire consists of Chacos and a North Face jacket.

We ended up paying $400 for super tiny portions.  We ordered potatoes and lo mein noodles to share.  It was sad how tiny the lo mein was and was not any better than a small Chinese place that's on every corner of LA.  I was disappointed that I ended up spending so much money for so little food.  We were still hungry after we left. They didn't get our steak right either.  We ordered 3 filet mignon, two medium rare and one medium well.  My friend's medium well was a well done, totally cooked through, my husband's medium rare was medium well and mine was medium rare how I wanted it.  My husband hates anything over medium rare so i switched my steak with his because I don't mind too much, but at 50 bucks a steak you should be getting that right, no?  I'm not a cheap person I just felt kind of bamboozled into this and it may be partially my fault for not looking into the prices but the woman on the phone was pushing Andrea's so much and that I should make a reservation that I just did it not thinking it would be so expensive for so little.  I'm on vacation I don't mind splurging...but we want decent portions. And as for the 'asian fusion"" this was hardly that.  Putting an itty bitty tiny salad with some ginger sauce does not make asian fusion in my opinion.  You could either order american or asian dishes, not much fusion going on, but maybe I haven't gone to enough fusiony places to know better, lol.

3206645,2017-11-14,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"Came here on a Friday night with 3 of my girlfriends, before the Britney Spears concert. We originally had a reservation for 3 but a 4th friend flew in from Boston to surprise me and the reservations were never updated (b/c I wasn't supposed to know about it - and I had made the reservation). There was no issue with this at all when we arrived at the restaurant. We got there about 15 minutes early and we were promptly seated at our table. The décor is so sleek, and I loved how open the restaurant is. It has a nice vibe. Our server was attentive and pleasant the entire time we were there.

The reason we chose this restaurant was simply because 2 of us wanted to try the Impossible Burger dishes they had! I am not a vegetarian but my friend is - and we were both very intrigued. So after learning about the Impossible Burger online and seeing it was on the menu, we couldn't come to Vegas without a visit to Andrea's!

As others have mentioned - Yes, everything is on the pricey side. From cocktails, to apps, to main dishes... you will fork over some cash. But from my experience, the food and the service was worth it. Plus, you are dining at an upscale restaurant in Vegas. Pricey menu items should come as no surprise!

We started with a round of cocktails at $16 a piece. I don't exactly remember what I ordered but it was damn delicious. Light and refreshing... I could have downed 3 of those babies, but I knew I would be drinking it up at the concert so I just had the one cocktail at dinner. We didn't bother with apps and got right to ordering. 2 of us each ordered the Impossible burger sliders (which is actually a $25 app), another friend had a couple of sushi rolls, while the other friend had a veggie stir fry dish I believe? Anyway, considering we didn't actually order entrees it was plenty of food for a meal. If you have not yet heard about the Impossible Burger, look it up. It is a plant based ""red meat"" (it isn't really meat, duh). But it is made to look, cook, taste and even sizzle like red meat. Seriously go watch the videos. The way the sliders were prepared were delicious! I am a meat eater through and through and if you had not told me that these sliders were not actually red meat, I don't think I would have been able to tell. Now, I did take some of the meat out alone so I could taste it without the bun and sauce and everything else they put on the sliders. When I did that, I could definitely tell that it did not have the true taste of red meat, since there is a bit of a different after taste. BUT - these sliders were fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to order them again if I ever found myself back at Andrea's!

We were celebrating 3 October birthdays out of the 4 of us that were dining that night. Our server brought 3 little individual dessert for each of us that had an October birthday. I totally did not expect that! It was a fun little way to end the meal.  Overall it was a great experience and delicious food.",iHcx-dJ4IO1LCTkUok3pqA,0,1,4,oMdc6oiGRqb5fVaZcBvpwQ

We went with some Vegan friends and had not intended to eat ONLY Vegan, but we ended up 95% Vegan for the whole meal.  The first non-vegan item we had was the tempora Sprimp   This was not the traditional tempora,  It reminded more of a heavy battered shrimp with the traditional spicy sweet sauce served in all Asian restaurants.
   The rest of our meal was all Vegan and let me tell you, it was delicious!   We started with the Vegan Gyoza.  It tasted like it was stuffed with sweet potatoes and had a beautiful mushroom broth that was a great compliment.  We had the Thai Chicken Curry...(Vegan) ....awesome!   and the Brussel sprouts were probably one of the best I have ever had...

We had made reservations a few weeks before and were really excited to try the new place and then go out to his birthday celebration afterwards. We had no idea we would be waiting over and hour just to be seated and ended up missing our original plans.

When we arrived for our 9:30 reservation at 9:10 we were told it would be a few minutes to get the table ready. At 9:40 my boyfriend checked back in and was once again told it would be a few more minutes to prepare the table. 30 minutes past our reservation time and almost 45 minutes of waiting I finally asked the hostess what was going on and explained this was a very special occasion and we made reservations for a reason. She told me that people were at our table and we would need to wait. Finally after an hour of waiting I told her we would be leaving if we were not seated immediately. 

We finally got a table set up for us, in the bar area, not even in the actual dining area. Overall this was NOT a good experience. The food was very mediocre for the price and the service was close to the service you get at fast food but extremely slower. In the end we ended up missing the event we had planned for after dinner and my boyfriend spent his birthday night waiting an hour when we had a reservation. We essentially paid $300 to waste our night away and miss his birthday event afterwards. 

My advice would be if you are going to accept reservations make sure you hold them, not make people wait an hour. They clearly have respect for their customers.  After looking at other Yelp reviews this seems to be the norm for them. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want to waste an hour of your life.",45K3KQE4bhZ86TJCsZjJ9w,6,0,1,qInxum6dG-A0X64RDm1CIw

We were slightly late for our reservation, but I had called ahead to make sure they would hold our table... They did so graciously and we believed the evening was off to a good start.. After sitting down and ordering drinks and reviewing the menu we order 2 appetizers and 4 entree's... Once we ordered we never saw another waitress again... We waited a while for the appetizers, but to our surprise our entree's came out with no appetizers... We waited again and finally flagged down a waitress to ask where they were.. She told us she would go check and that she was sorry... (We were at this point in a rush to leave because we had the concert after..) So, our original waitress comes to our table and apologizes and then very bluntly gives us two options 1. ""We can have the chef out the order out quickly."" 2. ""We can cancel it for you."" We were obviously shocked by the lack of apology and also by the choice we were given considering this was considered to be a ""fine dining"" restaurant.. (Even at BJ's Brewery if they forget an ordered dish they rush it out without question and comp that particular dish.. And BJ's Brewery is hardly fine dining.) 
Out of all the fine dining restaurants we have ever been to the service here was by far the worst we've ever experienced.. I would honestly go as far as saying the service here was worse than the service I have received at places like Red Robin.

All in all - we were extremely disappointed by the service at this restaurant and we certainly do not plan on going back. A very large part of the reason you go to an upscale restaurant is the service, or when you dine out anywhere to be honest. Especially at places like this you're paying a premium for the service, and I can assure you the service here was not indicative of the title ""fine dining"" and certainly not to the standards that you would expect from The Wynn or Encore.",MHw480K7KO8jVl-lLqu0GQ,1,0,2,VjQXjEsyCDban7DRSW8iag

They have a great house salad and amazing sides as well! I love their twice green beans and their shoe string potatoes

I don't exactly remember which years and vineyards these wines came from, as I went with my server's suggestions, but I liked both quite well. The Cabernet Sauvignon was very smooth but still retained some of its acidity while the Pinot Noir was lighter and sweeter. Both went exceptionally well with the wagyu steak, foie gras, and even the seafood in lieu of white wine.

(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IdIIv2oMKefa77_HvLFSjg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
Succulent and tender, this strip of steak was melt-in-your-mouth with every bite. 4oz was the perfect size, as it was generous enough to be satisfying while still left room for other tasty dishes. There was slight uneven marbling towards one end, but it was barely noticeable. I preferred the dish without the tangy acidity of the grilled lemon, but it was a nice way to cut the richness towards the end.

Sliced prime New York strip:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c2-pnJNESt8yjgNC6p0cWg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
Compared to the wagyu steak, which came before this dish, the New York strip paled. It was still well-grilled and a nice medium, but it was understandably leaner and thus a bit tougher. The sauce coating the top was also slightly on the salty side, but overall a pretty solid dish. 

Seared foie gras:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=auLDDRVewxu6iNoTtalu5w&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I've pretty much loved every preparation of foie gras I've ever had, and the quality of foie gras here was exceptional. The slight sear on both sides was gentle enough to leave a good amount of foie gras sashimi-style in the middle, and its buttery nature paired well with the citrus. I understood the garnish on top, and it did add a pop of decoration, but I could have done without texturally. The taro chips, which were perfectly fried, were well-paired. 

Diver sea scallops with mustard miso:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kMfOYixcnypCH5-fDp0fYA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I enjoy scallops, but they're not my favorite from the seafood group. These were not overcooked, but I missed that slightly smoky sear on either side. Not a bad dish, but not particularly memorable for me. 

Crispy brussels sprouts with balsamic soy reduction:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ArbX0hOg2XQlTv_lcToPSg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
This is one of my favorite preparations of brussels sprouts, despite it perhaps not being exactly the healthiest preparation.. These were fried to a perfect crisp, and the thin layers of brussels sprouts were separated to become brussels sprouts chips, which may not sound appetizing, but they absolutely were. The balsamic soy reduction gave the chips a nice vinegary flavoring, which kept them from becoming too heavy despite being fried.

Saikyo miso black cod:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=utNkVOPcsKqLohOCGC8-hQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
This dish came as highly recommended, and it was nicely cooked, albeit a little salty. The black cod was tender and flaky, but it might have been marinated a bit too long. The blackened skin also provided a nice crunchy contrast to the softness of the fish. 

Shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pRn4DH-1_7QOmhC8oTX1Lw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
We ordered this on a whim, but I would perhaps stick with the prior dishes rather than venture into the more fusion-y ones on my next visit. This roll was nicely made and quite tasty, but there was nothing super memorable about it for me. The mango on top was an interesting complement to the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna, but I have yet to find a roll that pairs fruit with seafood without making it seem rather dissonant. 

Chocolate orange sphere with hot fudge poured on top:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OxkE_GCJf2AjBTMG7pe6ow&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rYxWBIbcd7ppAgEQTHfGwQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
This was an amazingly decadent dessert, and I'm usually not a fan of orange and chocolate combinations. It was served as an orange sphere, and then the hot fudge was poured over top, melting the outside thin layer of chocolate and exposing the truffle-like interior. The components were thoughtfully and beautifully made, and the balance between fruit and chocolate was spot on.",1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA,18,12,4,jK6C4DIJLGsBjFxrXboh9g

When they brought her plate out I literally looked at it and thought they had just opened one of those ramen bags you buy at a. Grocery store and dumbed some frozen chicken and veggies. Also mine was about as much onion and fennel as anything, by the time I was done with my chicken I still had a full plate of onion. Forget about the price of you come to Vegas you should know it's going to be expensive but spending 100 dollars on two tiny disgusting plates is not how you get people to come back.

With mysterious female eyes plastered all over and the hipster nighttime club vibe, I felt as if I were transported to a modern day Great Gatsby party.  With a full service bar and with a view of Surrender nightclub from the seats, the restaurant feeds into the opulence of Vegas party nightlife.

Although the menu touts an extensive cocktail menu that can be done on an iPad, I decided to focus primarily on the food.  Here is what my friends and I shared:

**TABLE SHARES**
TUNA SASHIMI ON CRISPY RICE: Could easily have eaten a whole plate of this by myself!  What really makes this dish is the crunchiness of the slightly overcooked rice that perfectly offsets the smooth tuna sashimi.  When combined with the spiciness of spicy mayo and the slightly sweet sauce on the sashimi, I just loved it!

HAMACHI: Its simplicity is what makes this dish so amazing.  The thinly sliced yellowtail is delicately seasoned with a pickled cherry pepper, cilantro, and soy. With the crispy garlic slice on top, provides the perfect contrast and extra kick to each bite. 

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA SWEET PONZU AND ARUGULA: Enjoyed a lot!  Nice hot pieces of shrimp that had a nice crunch covered with a sweet and spicy sauce.  I loved that the sweetness was balanced with the bed of bitter arugula.

(Avoid!) PORK BELLY SISIG:  Although I enjoyed the nice fatty pieces of braised pork, I didn't particularly find the dish as a whole as special.  I could understand the subtle heat from the sauce and red onion, but besides these flavors, I did not find it amazing.  For this dish, the waiter told us later that you are meant to break the yolk and mix in with the other ingredients while the skillet is still piping hot.  Because we weren't told until after the skillet was cold, that could explain why the dish seemed a little one note.  

**EXTRAS**
CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS: As a big fan of brussel sprouts, I did enjoy this dish!  The brussel sprouts had a slight char to them and covered with a nice sweet soy sauce.  However, what made this dish great were the slivers of almonds to add an extra crunch to each bite.

FRIED SMASHED POTATOES:  Piping hot and well seasoned, these potatoes were pretty darn good!  The sauce was slightly spicy and added an extra kick to each bite.

**MEAT**
JIDORI CHICKEN BREAST: Although the chicken was well cooked and tender, I was underwhelmed by this selection given the other amazing flavors I had experienced before this.  In the end, it just felt like a really fancy chicken soup to me because there was nothing about this dish that really stood out in terms of flavor.  The chicken sits in a light broth and garnished with ginger, garlic, and micro greens.  

**DESSERT**
FLAMING MT. FUJI: An amazing tableside service makes this a dessert worthy for ordering!  After seeing several other tables order this, we knew we had to have it.  The chocolate food cake is covered with layers or marshmallow shaped to look like a massive mountain.  When the waiter comes by, he pours some of the rum around the cake and then lights it up for an amazing visual spectacle.  As for the taste?  Also great!  Along with the chocolate cake there are slivers of chocolates to add texture to the creamy marshmallow topping.

In terms of service, the service staff was generally nice but the wait for food was pretty ridiculous.  Between the time we got our appetizers and our entrees was close to an hour.  I understand that the food is a delicate process but it really drained our time.

Overall, I would say that if you are in Vegas and looking for a unique fine dining experience, Andrea's is a great place to go!",CdKvRVLHbX3pokKhj96X0w,3,2,4,FBfOnV9yRZ-GQx7AQGMJdg

I came to celebrate my graduation here the night before commencement. As a first timer, I was just in awe. With Andrea's eyes being the focal point of the joint, I found it kind of fun that they threw in this Andy Warhol vibe to her eyes. The restaurant was designed to appreciate beautiful women. With it's soft neutral colors to appeal to the taste of women, you can be sure to really see that pop. They also play fun hip music for you to get into that pregame party mode. To enhance a more interactive and hip experience you can flip through their alcoholic beverage selections through their fun ipad menu.

I admire their attention to detail and their ongoing efforts to make you feel special. With advanced notice of the occasion, they went ahead and customized our chopsticks with a nice announcement of my accomplishment. A cool secret tip: you can order a customized cake from the Wynn bakery in which it can be delivered and sent to your table during your dinner. All you have to do is request one. They'll even special design it for you.

The goods:
Bringing Sexy Back Cocktail (Punch Bowl): this is normally made as a standard cocktail but per request they were able to make it into the size of the fish bowl. It's made with cucumber, blood orange liquor, lime juice, rock candy syrup, and their special cucumber soda. Oh...this punch bowl is served in this fun big sassy bowl with fun straws, and is big enough to share. Surely instagram worthy too!

Rock shrimp tempura: sweet and crunchy. A good recommendation.

Smoked Wagyu Beeft Tataki: It has pnzu, ginger, and green onion. It accompanies a nice table side presentation in which it is served with the smoke trapped inside a glass funnel and then released once served. It looks like smog released in a club. A smoke party. The presentation is just as good as the sliced beef tataki. Fresh and smoky.

Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna: one of their popular rolls

Saikyo Miso Black Cod: also known as butter fish. IS A MUST! You'll never feel the same way about cod ever again. It was fatty, sweet, soft, and melted in your mouth like buttah.

Sliced prime NY strip: 16 ounces of sizzling steak on a platter. 

Sides: chinese sausage and pineapple fried rice with a sunny side up egg, and the pan fried noodles are a good suggestion. Also recommend the broccoli as a side.

We all ordered these dishes to table share for a party of 5, in which it was all more than enough to fill us all. The server also suggests to order the volcano chocolate cake due to taste and table presentation. As per the suggestion to the server, I second his recommendation by ordering to share with the group. It provides more variety and assortment when tasting dishes, and it makes it more fun. I was so happy to see that they also served filipino food! I never knew that Krispy Pata and Pancit can be served in a fine dining restaurant. 

Expect to spend an average of $100 - 150 per person, including cocktails, tip, and tax.

Seriously. The hostess told me ""Unfortunately we don't allow short pants in the restaurant."" That's right, short pants. 

Seriously. At first I thought she was joking, but then some older guy gave me a condescending smirk and told me, in a snotty, sarcasm tone ""To have a good night."" Not what I wanted to hear or how I expected to be treated from employees at the Wynn.

Andrea's - drop the snobby attitude. You're serving egg rolls twenty feet from the Willy Wonka slot machine.",uCO8lRN9eD2RRI7SgsR1PQ,4,1,1,DZasxUtkudzI8K6_243YFg

Most nights they have a live DJ spinning the music - so the music throughout the evening was great, hip, (but not too distracting) and with a constant beat that put you in the mood to go out after or keep the evening going.

I love restaurants with a trendy, sexy lounge feel, yummy cocktails, and gets my evening started... Andrea's definitely gave me that.

A salad and some veggie rolls came out first, both of them good. Then some truly delightful chicken fried rice.

There are a lot of reviews, so I'll just use this as a way to remind my future self what to (and not to) order...

Must Order:
- Truffle sea salt edamame (large bowl, filling, who doesn't love truffle?!)
- Seared salmon sashimi (wasabi kick which is great)
- Fried rice tuna (the best bite!)
- Brussel sprouts (delicious, almost dessert- like)

Depending on Party Size:
- Miso cod (I'm on the fence about this one, it's pretty tasty, but never merits the price tag)
- Shishito Peppers (I love shishito peppers, but for some reason these felt more like filler food)

Skip:
- Ramen burger (everyone said ""interesting"", no one said ""good"")
- Rock Shrimp Tempura (just meh)

A lot of the empty tables had ""reserved"" signs on the tables but no one sat down to eat or drink from these tables while we waited for a table and while we wait (keep in mind we were still eating after the restaurant closed because the serving of dishes were poorly timed). 

Food: excellent and the only reason I gave Andrea's 2 stars. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the miso fish was incredibly flavorful. 

Service: awful. Our dinner was poorly timed. We waited 20 minutes between our oyster appetizers and seafood main dishes. Yes, we timed it because it was such a long wait. No water service or update of our meal by or server. The wait staff are hardworking and hustled to help patrons but they didn't pay much attention to us. I totally felt judged. I didn't dress as nicely as others but I went to Vegas for gambling not dining. My money is just as green as other guests. Luckily we ordered drinks at the bar and brought it to our table because it took a while for our server to offer beverages including water. My friend apologized for the poor service saying it was better the first time she ate there.

Price: expensive. I would be ok with it if the service was as excellent as the food but it was not. Our meal had very low value given quality of food and service. 

Location: near the slot machines in the Encore. It was beautifully designed and the decor was stunning which was the other reason I gave the restaurant 2 stars.

Let me start this review by stating that we came here one evening for one thing and one thing only...to try their Mixed Berry Shave Ice.  5 Stars for excellent service and cool ambiance.  We didn't have any drinks or food at Andrea's so keep in mind that this review is only for their dessert and service.  Amanda M. recommended Andrea's for one of our challenges because their Mixed Berry Shave Ice had similar ingredients to Halo-Halo. That being said, we were also open to putting a little twist to our Halo-Halo madness.  

There's two sides of this review. You got my thoughts on the Mixed Berry Shave Ice and you got Terri's.  For me, this dessert gets 5 stars for presentation alone.  What you have is a concoction of raspberries, strawberries, nata de coco, lychee's, white beans, condensed milk, lemon sorbet, and shave ice.  The only ingredients similar to Halo-Halo was the condensed milk, white beans, nata de coco, and lychee's.  Because I'm allergic to fruits, I had to dodge all the good stuff in order to taste this.  I thought it was pretty good. You initially taste the sweetness, followed by the texture, and lastly hit with the tang of the sorbet in it.  We were also treated with 3 cones of sorbet (Blood Orange Ginger, Sake Cherry, and Chocolate Chili), which was thoughtful and appreciative. Terri is one of the lucky souls out there that isn't allergic to fruits. She thought that the ambiance of this place, the presentation of the dessert, the amount of the servings, and the overall taste was pretty good as well. She also points out that compared to Halo-Halo, missing was the ube and flan.  I concur.  This dessert cost $21, which is about 4 times what Halo-Halo cost at most of the Flip joint out there.  But it's also big enough to serve two. Terri's thoughts...""definitely an exorbitant indulgence that goes along with the price point for a place like Andrea's, but expensive for most"". Overall, this Halo-Halo hybrid was worth the try because we only live once. Halo-Halo Challenge #6 done!!!

PS:  I couldn't give this place any less than 4 stars because I didn't try their food.  The menu looked appealing and not everything on the menu was over the top.  I may come back just to try their sushi.

My husband and I shared the seafood platter. It was $55 and I thought that was a good deal: two Alaskan King crab legs, 4 oysters, ceviche, poke, lobster salad, and huge prawns. The poke was tasty, a little on the sweet side. Love the lobster salad. The ceviche was lemony. I can't remember what type of oyster... maybe Kushi? I've paid similar price for non-Strip restaurants that serve similar so I thought it was reasonable. 

We had sliders, rock shrimp tempura, spicy jidori chicken, and pork belly. The guys gobbled everything up. I had a bite of shrimp tempura and jidori chicken - both were tasty. The chicken wasn't spicy for us, since we're Korean and handle more heat. I thought it was mild. They also allow you to order sliders in the number you need. They usually come in threes, but we were able to get four.

For mains, we had some rib eye and steamed sea bass, and shared a whole bunch of sides which come in very small sizes... so for example the fried rice is more like a single portion if you were to just eat friend rice... about 1-1/2 cups. We ordered asparagus - the preserved lemon on these are delicious and unexpected. It brightened them in a way that made me crave them the day after. The broccoli was just that.The fried rice was also not as impressive. The Crispy Pan Fried Noodles I'd order again. We said we'd order more but we were pretty full and still had dessert. 

The main reason we went to this restaurant was for the Mt. Fuji dessert. The whole cake is lit and it goes up into a fierce flame. It looked amazing. The outer cover is marshmallow fluff and it gets toasted. It's a chocolate cake and was definitely worth the trip. I would have given it a 5 stars for the cake, but it lost points for some of the lackluster sides. 

It's also very loud, but fun. Maybe I'd go earlier next time. We had 8:45 reservations and was seated at 9pm... but it was the only time that we would make after a show at another hotel. 

I think the whole bill without alcohol including tip was close to $450 for 4 people.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,2,2,4,e1tu-Qh2G1QO7X3iMHoxWQ

Our group had a wonderful table and the wait staff--as is usual at all the Wynn/Encore restaurants--did a wonderful job.  

Our meals included varieties of sushi, sea bass, scallops, filets, and sides of edamame, Bok Choy--and once we were done with the otherwise generally healthy dinners--we broke and had the flaming tower which is the most moist cake I have ever eaten.

This was a warm up and send off to an evening of wild fun and frivolity at Encore Beach Club evening show with Marshmallow!  A wild ride that didn't end until 4:30AM.

We had about five people taking care of us, which made it a bit difficult to get to know any one of them, but each was extremely accommodating and knowledgable about the menu. We started off with some delicious sashimi which was flavorful, but I'm not sure worth $20. The shrimp and pork shumai dim sum were excellent. So were the drinks, which although $16 each packed a good amount of booze. 

But the real stars were the main course. I got seared diver scallops with garlicky noodles while my fiancé ordered the most delicious and perfectly prepared sea bass I've ever tasted. I almost wanted to switch!
Only downside was the sea bass didn't come with any sides. Small price to pay for a nicely sized slice of heaven.

The waiter didn't judge either when we ordered an espresso martini to share in lieu of their $21-$48 dollar desserts.

Food:
Shishto pepper: peanut sauce, some were soggy some were al dente some seemed raw. 

Edamame: truffle infused... Best thing we had 

House salad: really?? You'd charge for lettuce and some sort of vinaigrette?

Tempura; 6 itty bitty dime sized shrimp? Tempura rolls. 

Pad Thai: the worst I've ever had. Tasted like soggy egg noodles with absolutely NO flavor. 

Duck lo mein: gross tastes just like the pad Thai, bland, flavorless, and boring with tiny piece if dried duck

As a Filipino, I was happy to see Filipino inspired dishes on the menu.  I guess it's not surprising since the chef is Filipino.  All the dishes we ordered were on point!

Omi (MUST ORDER if available) - a special type of Kobe beef with an A5 rating.  Very rare to find outside of Japan.  Long story short, 8 thinly sliced pieces of this beef was worth $70!  Cooked to perfection and will just melt in your mouth!

Miso Black Cod (MUST ORDER) - rich, delicious taste but the portion might not be satisfactory to most since it's $32.  You're paying for the quality!

Crispy Pata (MUST ORDER if you're craving something fried) - fried to a perfect crisp.  The piece we got was very meaty and not too fatty which is key to a good crispy pata.  

Crab Fried Rice (MUST ORDER side) - real crab pieces and they weren't stingy with the crab.

Brussels Sprouts - Full of flavor, pan-fried with some balsamic reduction sauce.  Very good!

Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  They are flexible enough to substitute meat with any veggies.  In addition, they have a vegetarian section in their menu that includes sushi rolls, entrees, and sides.

- Crispy Pan Fried Noodles: I asked them to remove the chicken, and they were very willing.  The noodles were delicious.
- My co-worker order the vegetarian sushi rolls (cucumber, and avocado/asparagus): The sushi rolls were amazing.  I think I liked them more than my noodles.

Both were entrées but I selected the first one and used it as an appetizer with no regrets LOL, it was crispy lettuce cups made with the impossible burger...Mmm Mmm Good!
The second one was a Thai inspired beef entrée which I forgot the name so please forgive me but it was damn good also made with the impossible burger.
Did I mention that Andrea's is an Asian fusion restaurant.
Everything was so tasty and so good I even ate my edible flower that was the garnish for my tasty drink.
The waitstaff was absolutely one of the best and I have to give kudos to Bruce and Thomas both were superior!!!

For a table of 5 with not too hungry appetite - that amount of foods was just enough to keep us satisfied. Taste and presentation were on point!

The sushi rolls were forgettable however - def skip them and try another hot dish! 

Service was a little lacking towards the end of our meal - took quite some time to find either of our servers (two per table) to submit our dessert order.

FOOD:
Sizzling pork belly sisig - the meat was crispy and reminded me of chicharon or carnitas. The combo with the egg was the perfect pairing. 

Ramen sliders - if you've had these before at some small restaurant or fair, I wouldn't order these here. Don't get me wrong, these were quite tasty but I would definitely have chosen something else the rice never had before. 

Salmon aburi - if you love salmon sushi anything, this is definitely your dish. The fish melted in your mouth and the rice to filling combo was perfect. 

Uni sashimi - fresh. 

SERVICE: Our waiter checked in with us often, like any other top star restaurant. They even gave us (on the house) a sample of some crab meat with cucumber foam, which was delicious as well.

I dined there as soon as they opened at 6pm, it was empty. An hour later when I finished, they were about 4 other parties in the dining area and two ladies sitting at the bar. 

If you ever took a taxi ride in Vegas, you're probably impressed by the ""eyes"". It's not something particular interesting, but it does stand out. If you randomly end up in this place, you'll be like ""oh that's the restaurant with the 'eyes' that Steve Wynn was bragging about. 

They claim to be the first Asian restaurant to combine bar and restaurant together. I'm not sure if that's true, but I do know it's not the best restaurant with a bar. I'd think if they tried to put a bar and a restaurant together, they'd want to do it seamlessly. To me, the bar is really isolated from the main dining area. Maybe they don't want the drunk/over-social bar patrons to disturb their dinner guests, but it could be executed better.

Service at Andrea's is really good and professional. Many cute guys are working there. I kinda wish my waiter wasn't like a robot and lacked personality. 

As for the food, I really can't say I liked it. The ramen burger I had (2 for $18) needed more flavors on ramen. It was my first time trying ramen burger, so I really didn't know what to expect, but one thing that could be said is that their ramen doesn't pair well with the meat patty, not in the way the ramen is (not) cooked. (no flavor) I was also disappointed when I found out the ramen used was probably made from fried ramen you can buy at a 99-cent store.

Long story short, they didn't do anything with a party of 6 ladies (and Encore hotel guests) with nothing more than a phone number to call for a lost credit card. After I complained that they should offer to do something for wasted time (over 45 mins), inconvenience and poor customer service, the manager Lauren Boylan, did nothing. Great. You lost the only credit card that I brought to Vegas and it's apparently my problem now. Then since we had to make another set of plans and didn't want to waste any more time of my friends, we said the least they can do is comp the meal. They refused and offered nothing. So then my friend suggested it's right to at least take drinks that came out late and 1/6 of the meal. The worst customer service ever!!!!!

- Sinatra Drink - 1 star: Medicinal and expensive
- Steamed Seabass - 3.5 stars: Famous dish, served with a ginger scallion Chinese sauce. Flaky, delicate, flavorful but a little small. 
-  Miso Black Cod - 4 stars: Delicious and buttery. The seabass and the cod were very different but I think I prefer the cod because it was more flavorful 
- Bacon Fried Rice: 2.5 stars: Bacon was very thick and flavorful but chewy and tough; the rice tasted dry like pilaf. Beautiful, but do not recommend.
- Brussels Sprouts - 4.5 stars: Crispy, deep-fried leaves sweetened with balsamic glaze. 
- Tuna Tataki - 4 stars: Mixed reviews on this, but I really enjoyed it because it was flavorful and crunchy. The tuna could've been better quality but it was overall a tasty dish
- Mango roll - 4 stars: Looking for a flavorful but inauthentic roll? This is it! Crunchy and delicious. 
- Pork Adobo Sisig - 3.5 stars: Tasty, a bit salty. Not sure if I would order again. 
- Peanut dessert - 4 stars: Three portions of peanut mousse on a crispy peanut brittle crust (you can order it with fourth piece if needed). It was very rich and decadent I loved that there was a crunchy crust

I brought my friends from NY and FL here and they were impressed by the high-energy vibe. The staff was beyond attentive and even down to the sommelier commenting on the Woodford reserve drop-off. There's a touch of detail most restaurants tend to forget about.

We started off with the pork belly, spicy tuna crunch, salmon sashimi. The pork belly, with Filipino influence, was absolutely delicious. Something to remember. Spicy tuna crunch had the right amount of balance to not be over-powered by most popular rendition of relying on spicy mayo.

We continued on with the flash-fried brussel sprouts, sea bass, and a sushi roll (I forgot which one!). Whatever it was, we LOVED it. No complaints as we devoured it all.

To finish it off, we got three different ice creams which consisted of exotic flavors. My memory doesn't serve well on the exact flavors but boy, do I remember the experience.

I ordered the hamachi with the crispy garlic. Wow wow wow!!!!! Order this!

5083858,2016-04-19,1,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"The service at Andrea's (in Wynn Encore) is impeccable. Sadly, the food is not.  Really not. Andrea's claims to be ""Asian fusion.""  As far as I can tell, it's fused the same way the top of a creme brûlée is-- with a layer of sugar. 

I showed up half an hour earlier than my reservation, by mistake, but the hostess graciously accommodated me.  After that, things started downhill. A common enough vodka on their menu was out of stock, despite being listed on the iPad (and thus updatable) drink menu.  No big deal; these things happen. 

I started off with the kale and red cabbage salad. Tasty, with a sweet creamy dressing that complemented the slight bitterness of the kale and crispy garlic. A bit overly sweet and heavy on the dressing, but still tasty. A roasted vegetable sushi roll followed. Fine, if unremarkable and overpriced. 

The main course was pailllard of Jidori chicken in an overly-sweet lemon cream sauce. Any hint of tartness in the lemon had been smothered under a huge scoop of sugar. The paper-thin piece of crispy yuba (tofu) on top overwhelmingly tasted of stale fryer grease. 

Sides were:
Crispy Brussels sprouts with another dessert-grade soy-sugar sauce (sweet far beyond what the balsamic vinegar provided), 
Creamed spinach with coconut, pork belly cubes, shrimp, undetectable pepper flakes and garlic, and a heavy coat of Panko crumbs that went from crunchy to soggy in 3-2-1-mush. Like nearly everything else, the coconut cream sauce was so sugared that you could have used it for pina coladas. 
The final side, baby bok choi was, thankfully, spared the otherwise-mandatory scoop of sugar. 

Other items on the menu include Waygu beef sliders on....wait for it....sweet Hawaiian bread, torched marshmallow cake...well, you get the idea. This isn't a restaurant, it's a candy store. 

Unfortunately, this is all too common a problem with even so-called ""fine dining"" in Vegas, where the kitchens seem to cook for Ma and Pa Kettle from Bumfuck, Iowa, for whom Olive Garden is the usual Big Night Out.   (Example: the restaurant at Trump sweetens their bearnaise sauce. Yes, really. As The Donald would say, ""So classy."")

Needless to say, I skipped dessert, as I had already eaten it.

This is an example of why:

Shrimp and Pork Shumai ($7 HH). These were very good, super juicy and flavorful! I'd CRY paying $13 for these though at normal prices!  Good, but not noticeably better than anything in Chinatown for 1/4 of the price.

Shishito Peppers ($7 HH) with Mustard Miso. This was surprisingly SPICY! It was delicious though, and the portion was pretty large.  Recommended :)

Hamachi Sashimi ($12 HH): Crispy Garlic, Pickled Cherry Pepper, Cilantro & Sudachi Soy. This was very good! Fresh, tender yellowtail sitting in a light soy with a bit of crunch from the garlic and pepper combination. Yum!  I think this is a $20 plate during normal prices.

16oz Sliced Prime NY Strip ($58): Wasabi Demi-Glace. This was pretty tasty, surprisingly FATTY, but tender and edible fats. The demi-glace was not spicy at all, but had a good flavor to it.  I found the sauce to be slightly overpowering but still good...at the price though, you are in the steakhouse category and can find considerably better quality/taste at that mark.

Fried Smashed Potatoes ($12): Thai Curry Aïoli. THESE WERE AWESOME. Twice fried potatoes with a nice crispy texture, and the thai curry aioli was super flavorful! The combination was exciting!  Funny to think that this side dish would actually be the HIGHLIGHT of my meal :P

And to finish, we got hooked up with some gelato!  Banana with Shortbread Crunch, Creme Fraiche with Sake-Infused Cherries, and Honey Pistachio.  I LOVE ice cream cones, and these were yummy bites.

Honestly, the only thing I can complain about is PRICE.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all pretty good.  Check it out if you are in the Wynn :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,1,4,kfY0b9_q37qyb7K42dygoA

We were greeted  by a very friendly and confident hostess.We sat down and the nice lady pulled and put our napkins on our laps for us. Very classy, She said our waiter Alan would be along shortly. Before I could even think about how long that might take he was right there taking drink orders. Water for the table and he gave us menus and a drink Ipad, The decor here is not what I expected from the few photos I had sen in the past. I want to be able to describe it but I guess 70's fusion with modern accents, We made our drink orders. Josie had a drink, Cranberry crush our other friend Samantha got a pear blossum.  Both were well mixed and were not stingy with the alcohol. I ordered a beer Hitachino Nest Red Rice Beer. The notes in this beer really paired well with the Asian fusion meal we were about to experience. We also ordered a Sparkling Saki. I am not normally a Saki fan but this was quite good.
Let's get to eating. This meal was truly an experience, it was pricey for my normal budget but well worth every penny. This is our splurge best friends dinner so we budgeted for this as we do all of our special meals out with friends. We started with a table share Pork Sisig. How do I explain this. Its pork belly, pork cracklin, Jalapeno and a few other spices. This also has a fried egg on top. Alan advised the best way to eat it was to cut the egg and get the yolk mixed in and eat it as a hash. So flavorful and rich, it went across the pallet and had great salty notes and pork goodness. So good we ordered another. We also had Salmon and Albacore Sashimi. Both with great cuts and knife work and a sauce I did not get the name of.
Main courses. I had The Pan seared Salmon with smoked mussels and Maitake mushrooms, The Salmon had a real nice crispy skin cooked a perfect medium(a good restaurant knows to ask how guest wants it cooked), I could eat the mushrooms alone they had such great richness. Fish flaked nicely and was easy to take apart with chop sticks. I paired it with a Smoked Bacon Fried rice. This rice had Bacon that had an incredible deep smoked flavor. Every bite of both my dishes had me really wanting more. Josie ordered chicken adobo which had a great sour bite that you expect from Adobo food. Dalton had an egg wrapped Pad Thai, The egg wrapped steamed in the flavor and the noodle came across the pallet with a true Umami. I have never had Pad Thai this good, 
We ended the meal with a flaming desert, Mt,Fuji, marshmallow covered devils food cake and chocolate moose. Covered with 151 and lit on fire. The campfire marshmallow taste added with the rich moose and devils food was amazing.This desert was so big we actually gave the couple sitting next to us a couple plates to share with us.
This was a dining experience and worth the time and money. Our server Alan was very knowledgeable of the food and the drinks. He was ever present and our drinks were never wanting. We never felt rushed and enjoyed every second.

The cocktail menu is on an Ipad, so it was a interactive start to a fun evening. 

Our server was really attentive, and the only issue we had was that some of our orders didn't make it to the table at the same time (the side of rice and the shumai were tardy) but everything tasted delicious!  

My Miso Black Cod was SPECTACULAR.  Seriously silky and luxurious and a fairly large portion.  I was surprised that it was truly a la carte, so the described accompaniments were more garnish than side.  We ordered the charred asparagus for the table - topped with lemon preserve which made it all really interesting! 

Everyone loved what they ordered.  
In my humble opinion, while the sushi was excellent  and of superior quality, if you can get amazing sushi locally for less dinero (as we can at Azuki and Sushi Ota) then I'd recommend you order the Black Cod - something you cannot find everywhere.  It was to die for!

Again, expect to sit for at least three hours because they are always crowded and the haughty servers do you no favors, but this is dining at it's most fun - especially if you're on a business tab.",riETmgv8NnaNfTWhXc-XDA,1,1,5,oPsmktYvQGGFlcRVG3K41g

5440361,2013-08-02,1,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"Ate here on a Thursday night last week. My friends & I were at the Wynn pool and were approached by a promoter (very friendly young woman - I think her name was Erica) who was recruiting guests for a special promotion for the restaurant and the nightclub next to Andrea's (Surrender). It involved Andrea's 7-7-7 deal (special menu of a cocktail, appetizer, and entree, all for $7 each) as well as a free drink ticket for a glass of champagne and a pass to Surrender that included an open bar (vodka & tequila). We skipped the Surrender part of the deal because as it was our last night in Vegas & none of us wanted to be hungover the next day (I have officially entered the 1-2 day long hangover age - I can't recover from hangovers as quickly as I used to! Gah!).

We thought the 7-7-7 deal was too good to be true, especially for a swanky place like Andrea's. And we figured out the catch:
(1) We arrived at our appointed time, but were met with some confusion over where to place us or where we could wait (2-3 different people told us different things). But that's ok, it got cleared up within 10 minutes. Totally forgiveable.
(2) The appetizer and entree portions were not too big. The menu also included an optional list of entrees that can be added on for an incremental cost. A-HA!! We knew it was too good to be true! But seriously, overall it was not a huge problem at all, it was still a decent deal in general, so we bit - and did enjoy most of the food we got.

Going back to the portion size not being too big: I expected that since this is a very trendy & upscale restaurant at the Encore. Also, since I was wearing a tight dress, maybe it was better that we ate small - any more and I would've had to stop breathing!

I had:
- Espresso Martini (it was good but a little too much espresso-taste)
- Shrimp & Pork Shumai (these were not very good actually - kind of fatty and squishy)
- Spicy Tuna Roll (pretty good)
- 1 of my friends & I shared the Wok-Fried Chicken (YUM!!) and the Lobster Fried Rice (Also YUM!!)

Ambience was swanky and chic, lighting was on the dark/dim side. Noise level was average for a Vegas restaurant: Not too loud, but not super quiet either. We shouted over each other once or twice, but not the whole night.

Our server and the hostesses were very nice and friendly, very accommodating. Our server was also very helpful and always around when we needed her, and she also popped by to check on us periodically without overdoing it. I hope she liked her tip because we left her a decent one!

Very nice place, I would like to check out the full menu next time as most of the food was delicious.",VoO-eDoNC87qolK8Fz9yPA,3,2,4,znvAkD3C1qAaJFVA8le2Pw

The space is stunning, in my eyes. The owners ex-wife's eyes watch you from above the bar. An interesting conversation starter. 

The predominantly white space with dim lighting is modern but elegantly appointed and well thought out. The attention to detail is apparent, but translates to the meal in addition to the ambiance. 

We've always requested a private booth because it's a ""special occasion"" restaurant for us. In those, it's quite and very romantic. 

The booths are private, individual high walled seats that line the side of the restaurant. You walk up two steps to enter and they have silver beads hanging along the edge. The lighting is dim. 

Upon arriving they invited us to enjoy a cocktail
At the bar. I had a delicious glass of sparkling Rose & my husband a manhattan. Made to perfection like everything here. 
Before dinner cleanser was an avocado gazpacho. Loved it. 
On this occasion my husband ordered the Crunchy salmon sashimi - it was out of this world. The crunch gave it a unique texture you don't typically experience with sashimi. The fish itself could not have been more fresh. 
I had the sea bass for the second time. It is the best sea bass I've had in my life. It's exquisite in a very light butter. We also ordered a side dish of bok choy to share. Yum. I think it was steamed. 

For the occasion they brought us two cake pops. They were super. I never eat those but delish.

On a recent visit for my wife's birthday dinner, Andrea's continuously hit high marks, plate after plate after plate.  Yes, it costs more than Spring Mountain, but there's a quality of ingredients here that is unparalleled to most spots a few miles southwest of Encore.  

The ambiance is really nice - the cool lighting, upscale late 70's furnishings with accompanying music that dabbled into the 80's as the night went on made me feel like this was the kind of place to pregame before going to Studio 54.  Andrea Wynn's eyes all lit up behind the bar were strangely soothing.  The 3 cucumber/gin cocktails only enhanced that effect.

With a party of 8, we opted to go omakase family style.  The waiter asked for a per person price to adhere to along with any items we were not interested in (ah-hem....$9 miso soup) and then we awaited the surprises from the kitchen.  ""Seafood on Ice"" may sound like the worst ice skating show ever (ok,ok a gigantic oyster doing a triple axle might possibly awesome), but these treasures from the ocean were excellent.  The slow poached prawns were shrimp cocktail for kings, and the initial bite of the marinated bay scallop totally wowed me with its freshness.  Crab legs, oysters, Maine lobster and tuna poke made life even better.   

The ""Steamed Sea Bass"" was exquisite.  It started tender on the outside and got tendererererererer as you got to the center.  The ginger, garlic, mushroom, lemon and cilantro made for a simple but divine combination for such a fantastic cut of fish.  I bet Roger Federerererererer would like this.  Everything else was very enjoyable including the tuna+crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura, hamachi sashimi, sliced prime New York strip, adobo crab fried rice, and the Saikyo miso black cod among other items.   

It was impossible to say no to the Mt Fuji dessert.  I mean....how do you NOT take photos and videos of this behemoth of sugar as they pour the Bacardi 151 and set it on fire???  I found it to be a bit too alcohol-y for my taste, but totally worth the ""show"" factor.  It was a great ending to the meal.

5552686,2015-06-08,0,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"Boyfriend and I stayed at the Encore and were planning on eating at a restaurant at the Aria on Saturday night. On Thursday, we walked by Andreas just to check it out. An employee named Trevor there graciously gave us a tour of the restaurant, described the food and told us that if we dined there he would personally escort us to Surrender nightclub next door after our meal to skip the line. He has us sold; we canceled our Aria rez and dined here. 

Trevor and his team served us; and it was likely the most exceptional service we have experienced at a restaurant. The passion with which Trevor described the things he suggested we order was outstanding. I don't even like cucumber but with the way he described a cucumber cocktail on the menu, I couldn't help but say no. Same with the dessert; we don't love chocolately things but the way Trevor described the ""orange sphere"" captivated us. He not only described what was in the desert, but the origins of the chocolate in it. Had us sold... Again. When we told him what an outstanding employee he was, he humbly told us that it was a team effort and pointed out his team members. 

So now for the food: 

* Tuna + crispy rice appetizer: this was so good and so flavorful I almost wanted to get another order. It comes with four pieces and is a good amount to share. The tuna is flavorful and the crispy rice gives it great texture. 

* Shrimp tempura + spicy tuna roll: also fantastic. Loved the mango in it. The roll was flavorful, fresh, with just the right amount of crunch. And not too much rice which can ruin a roll. 

*Shrimp pad Thai: this is very uniquely presented. Instead of having scrambled egg mixed it, the pad Thai comes enclosed in a thin pillow made out of egg. Almost looks like a crepe. I wish I took a picture! This was a fantastic take on pad Thai and I would definitely order again. NOTE: we orders this ""spicy"" and I'm glad we did, otherwise it would not have enough kick to it 

*Toro sushi: at $40 for two pieces, this is a Huge waste of money. I've had much fresher, better toro at other sushi restaurants for much less. This is the one order we regretted. 

*Orange sphere desert: this desert reminds me of a fancy version of those chocolate oranges wrapped in foil that you hit to break open. If you like those, and love chocolate, this dessert is for you. It is a but rich but the presentation is spectacular.",i-pbxNlU-PKee0Mzku95Lw,0,0,5,4zyk3SWlAJH54hijbYvNfA

We were seated immediately and couldn't stop talking about the ambiance of the place - very classy with a nice view of the Encore Beach Club right outside the window and the dim lighting was a perfect touch. 

The separate vegan menu has a ton of choices so we had a hard time deciding but ended up getting the gyoza and sushi roll for appetizers and for entrees we got the side of fried rice, the tofu bowl with impossible burger meat (the famous burger that ""bleeds like real meat""), and the pan fried noodles. All were super delicious (my favorites were the sushi roll and the fried rice!) but the tofu bowl was kinda salty. The portions are huge and very shareable! We ended the night with the vegan tart dessert and they were nice enough to even decorate it with a candle and a happy birthday sign.

The attention-to-detail here is superb, and you very well might find yourself where we were, in that we spent basically the entire meal trying not to let our jaws hit the floor after having our expectations blown out of the water time & again. Your every need is tended to at Andrea's, and nothing goes overlooked. It's worth every last penny: 

____________

+ I found the vibe here to be somewhat different from what I had read about in researching Andrea's prior to our visit. On one hand, the ""sexy atmosphere"" was all accounted for - dimly lit, beautifully sculpted light fixtures, and the signature shifting eyes at the bar all made for an edgy, inviting, and seductive dinner experience. My girlfriend pointed out how the whole environment feels ""geared towards women,"" but I'd argue instead that it's instead geared towards ""getting laid."" 

From our table's location, we could look out to the left and see Encore Beach Club at Night going off, LEDs and all. And yet - even with its proximity to EBC/Surrender, Andrea's remains perfectly insulated from even the slightest hint of thumping music & bass. Needless to say, the whole setup was both ambitious and spectacular.

+ Andrea's boasts what I believe is the best server-to-table ratio that I've ever seen. What this leads to is a supremely attentive, alert wait staff. Case in point: 

The GF steps away from the table momentarily to head to the restroom. In the few minutes that she's away, three servers simultaneously approach our table; one refills both our waters, another folds her napkin and places it neatly at her seat, and the third ADJUSTS HER MENUS and gently positions them right within her reach...I had to stop myself from squealing like a little girl. 

+ I almost felt bad as one server after the next would make way for me on the two occasions that I visited the restroom; even at my insistence that they move first, the staff members refused to budge. The VIP treatment was in full effect!

+ Okay, okay, one more - when ordering up drinks via the iPad menu, you're given the option to send an email reminder to yourself if a particular variety/label catches your eye. Again, Andrea's impressed me not only because of the restaurant's overall ability to produce consistent excellence - but also because our meal fulfilled needs/wants that we didn't even know that we had. That's true luxury!

____________

+ Being that we had plans to visit XS after wrapping up our meal, we decided to dine with a focus on flavor as opposed to fullness. Our server (I wish I could remember his name, he did a stellar job) recommended that we start off with the Hamachi Sashimi, and we tacked on a Rainbow Roll to boot. I appreciated how Andrea's brought out a gluten-free menu to our table in recognition of the GF's allergies. Normally, I'm more keen on trying more adventurous types of sushi selections, but we were in a bit of a rush - being that we arrived for dinner close to 11 PM. 

+ The Hamachi Sashimi was (I'm running out of superlatives here) fantastic; this is the dish that I've dreamt about twice in the past 7 days (except, sadly, I recall the Hamachi being $15 in my dream, as opposed to its real-life $23 price tag). The clarity of flavor and freshness of the fish made for some very long, methodical chewing; the crispy garlic and pickled cherry peppers truly brought out every characteristic of the hamachi's flavor without masking the fish's natural taste.  

We made the mistake of ordering a side of ponzu to dip the fish in; I'd advise against doing so, as that WILL overpower the natural hamachi flavor. Sometimes it's better to leave things untouched...

+ The Rainbow Roll that we ordered up was also delicious. Not at all creamy or mushy like a cheap textbook sushi roll, this dish practically elevated my thinking of what a sushi roll could be. Every variety of fish placed atop the roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) shined with natural flavor.

____________

Dinner at Andrea's makes you feel like a million bucks. It's got all the special touches that embody a real fine dining experience, complementing this refinement with lots of sexiness and character. Hats off to Steve Wynn, Chef Elevado, etc. - they knocked it out of the park and over the moon with this one.

PRO TIP:

Staying at a conventional Wynn/Encore room doesn't offer any advantage in terms of your ability to secure ideal dinner reservation times (can't say the same about the Tower Suites, as we haven't tried those yet!). We tried to book a table during the second day of our stay, and the only available seatings were at 6:00PM and 10:30PM. That being said, save yourself some hassle, and try to snag your reservations well in advance!",Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,6,3,5,L7eTYl9Mqy2Nby5lcPoEgw
5629960,2015-08-12,4,IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,"Being Vegas veterans, hubby and I typically eschew the trendy, hip, Asian fusion restaurants found in casinos.  So I wasn't too optimistic when we went to Vegas one weekend with some friends and decided to come here.  Hubby had been once before and gave it his most ringing endorsement ""Not bad.""  Uh oh...

Cut to our evening...the place is beautiful.  It's exactly what you'd expect out of a hip and trendy Asian fusion restaurant.  They also have cool, semi-private booths built best for two people.  The decor is gorgeous!  At this point, still wary about the food...

Friend and I showed up fashionably late.  Our SO's had come by to check in and get the party started.  By the time we arrived, a nice bottle of wine had already been decanted and poured.  For apps, we started with the shishito peppers, the steamed edamame and the rock shrimp tempura and some grilled diver scallops.  The peppers and edamame sound pedestrian but the way they were prepared was really delicious!  The rock shrimp and the scallops were solid as well.  So far so good...

It was around this time we went onto our 2nd bottle of wine.  The sommelier was super friendly and shared his fancy Riedel decanters with us.  The ""boa"" was my favorite both in appearance and in how to pour the wine.  

For entrees, we went with a crispy pata (a Filipino-inspired dish, I'm sure) and I went with the steamed sea bass.  Hubby says his was ok.  I had a small piece and thought it was amazing.  He wasn't a huge fan of the sides (pickled veggies).  My steamed sea bass was pretty tasty though after what we had prior to the entrees, it was a little light on the flavor spectrum.

Service was hit or miss.  Everyone was super friendly and, at times, attentive.  Towards the end of our meal, we saw less and less of everyone (which is ok) but eventually water and wine were harder to come by (which is why we learned how to pour our own wine out of the ""boa""). Ok, I sound like a brat but they were seriously pouring our wine for us, constantly...plus we didn't want to break one of those fancy decanters.  

Definitely better than I expected but I guess I shouldn't be surprised...this is The Wynn after all...!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,6,5,4,LMWqW3chW9mMZydqZ_Vu8g

     It was still CES 2014, Andrea's was 1 of the restaurant that my customer's held a happy hour here. Our team came in and stayed back for dinner at bar. 

     Andrea's is such a lovely place, swanky, modern, and so chic. The new hot dining spot in Las Vegas is Andrea's at Encore Hotel. Music popping, live DJs provide the night's soundtrack  and the LED displace with Andy Warhol art, the eyes continues changing colorful. The spacious 2 levels dining room, with booths on the side and more than 30 sits at the bar area, a little bit for everyone. 

     Chef Joseph Elevado combines hip Asian dining with a sexy atmosphere. Chef Elevado's menu features Wagyu beef and lobster roll, rock shrimp tempura, and NY Strip Steak with Wasabi demi glacé.

- Delicious grilled calamari salad, off-the-menu, ordered by a nice bartender that was serving us.

- SHISHITO PEPPERS mustard miso and CUCUMBER Sunomono salad were both good. 

- SEARED ALBACORE SASHIMI crispy onions, ponzu - The albacore was nice but was hidden under the pile of crispy onion. It was so overpowering for us. 

- Uni, Otoro were over priced compare to other sushi places in Vegas, and trust me, I've been to plenty.

- BAKED KING CRAB HAND ROLL soy paper, sweet mayo -  this was quite pleasant, tiny roll like my 2 fingers together, but surely worth $18. MUST ORDER

- HAMACHI SASHIMI* crispy garlic, pickled cherry pepper, cilantro, sudachi soy - this was good. $20

- SCALLOP SASHIMI parsley salsa verde $20 this was very nice, MUST TRY

- KIMCHEE, EDAMAME + TOFU FRIED RICE - love it

- SHRIMP AND PORK SHUMAI DUMPLINGS - this was surprisingly good. 

- TUNA AND CRISPY RICE* pickled jalapeño, spicy mayo, kecap manis - this was OK $24

      The cocktails menu was very creative, pricey but well worth it to try. You got to slide through the iPad menu to see the picture of the cocktail before you order it, I like that. The wine list was impressive and wines by the glasses were reasonable. COCKTAIL: Mango sashimi cocktail is a MUST ORDER after dinner. 

     Our bartender was very attentive even though it was so busy that day during CES 2014.  The food was good but not as exceptional as other sushi that I've been to in Las Vegas, but still 1 of my top Asian Fusion food spots in Vegas. However, I love the ambiance, the drinks, and the whole vibe here. It's such a perfect spot for a large group to dine in or late night dining here on the weekend with live DJs.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,13,10,4,0-V-ADS0qgrRs3u5QeEEKA

The place had a very lounge-y feel and everyone dining inside looked REAL good (cuz it's valentine's day). The place was dark and romantic and packed with people.

For food, we got the steamed edamame, seared foie gras bao and the wagyu beef sliders. 
-The edamame had a really really strong truffle taste, which could be good depending on your preference. I thought the truffle flavor was a little too strong and over-powering.[$10] 
-The wagyu beef sliders were amazing. The meat was soooo juicy and it went perfectly with the Hawaiian roll. I didn't really enjoy the shoestring potatoes that came it . It would have probably been better with regular fries.[$24] 
-The seared foie gras bao was also really flavorful. I can clearly remember the pinepple in the bao that gave the foie gras a tangy taste. [$30] 

The main reason we went to Andrea's was to try their punch bowls. We were disappointed when we did not find it on the drinks menu (on an Ipad), but after talking to our server, we realized that you can make any of the cocktails a punch bowl. We went for the Showstopper. The punch bowl was $80 and BOY it was strong. It was literally a huge bowl of dranks and it made 4 people buzzed. I strongly do not recommend this punch bowl to be shard only between two people but for $20 a person, not too bad of a deal.

My real problem with this place was the service. I was being ignored for a good 15-20 minutes where I had to actively try to wave down a server. I was so angry I almost walked out. Granted it was Valentine's Day, a restaurant in the Wynn, charging such high prices should not leave any tables ignored. The only reason why I didn't pursue this horrible service was because I got drunk off the punch bowl. 

Honestly, I don't think I will go back to Andrea's for the food, or slow service. I will only go back for another punch bowl because it was tasty and it got the job done.",n19tYG7tHbX6rHhAjJ8PPA,1,0,3,64eNJgQoJK80VpxGNBfT2A

Ok, this does happen so maybe a small pass until I get to the service. Our young server was distracted at best. He seemed unsure of his job description, almost uncomfortable at his task.

However, BEWARE of the steep prices here (which you expect because you are in one of the nicest hotels in Vegas).

I came here because my girlfriend wanted to try the punch bowl (a giant bowl of mixed drink). We got a bowl of showstopper and finished the bowl with 4 people. For $80 bucks (fairly steep for a pre-game), we all had a pretty good buzz that didn't require the usually ""shots shots shots."" The showstopper was good enough that my girlfriend did not complain that this was too strong or undrinkable even though it was made with wild turkey.

Other than the punch bowl, we also ordered the wagyu beef sliders to share. These came out perfectly! I expected the sliders to be ordinary, but the taste and tenderness of the wagyu beef took me on a taste-bud-rollercoaster ride. The problem here is that the wagyu sliders were $24 bucks, which is EXTREMELY expensive!

I also want to mention that the service here was subpar, mostly because our server (Christian) was inattentive. When you are paying these prices, you expect world class service. (The edamame was $10 bucks!) After greeting us and pouring us water, he was nowhere to be seen for the next 25 minutes. To add fuel to the fire, I clearly saw him walking around and helping out the other tables, all of which were right next to ours.

Sat us at a gorgeous table, even took out photo like 4 times (we were also celebrating my friend Lauren's birthday.) we had a server, Kip, who was just an angel to us the whole time! took care of us really well and gave us good recommendations and was prompt to notice if we needed anything else. 

We started with the Seafood on Ice and got the larger portion which had 4 GIANT grab leg, 4 jumbo shrimp, 6 (i think) oysters, scallop salad, lobster salad, and tuna poke. This was a pretty expensive app at $98 but I would say its well worth it. Not a single piece was bad. The crab legs were soooooo buttery and succulent. and the scallops were perfect and not fishy smelling. Those and the lobster salad were my favorite. I ended up having the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll and it was seriously amazing, the inside was super soft with the fish and avocado but the crunchy part was VERY crunchy so you had a multitude of textures the whole time you were eating.

This restaurant is definitely on the pricier side but the layout is so beautiful and the food was such good quality and everything was extremely fresh. They didnt rush us out when it was past close and I loved that you could see the encore pool club right outside. It made you feel amped and ready for the night rather than tired like i usually am after a big meal.

I would have enjoyed eating dinner at the bar if I had felt welcomed, but alas...I got my drink as I waited for my table and watched the bartenders talking to each other and not their guests. 

We were whisked away by the host who took us to our table. You can transfer your bar tab directly to your table, but we opted to pay out the bartender directly so they received the full tip. Even when service isn't top notch, I always leave 20%, because the former server in me just won't quit. Tipping karma is real people!!

Out table side service was phenomenal. Our server, Christian I believe?, had a gentle elegance behind his service that was flawless. We sat in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and stairs.

I also had the miso soup and cucumber salad - those tasted typical. The shishito peppers were really good, and they're fried rice was perfection!  Service at the bar was exceptional. I didn't have drinks, but what the bartender was churning out all looked delicious. Will definitely come here every chance I get. Highly recommend the place if you're vegan/vegetarian. Tons of options. Wynn is known to have a vegan and vegetarian menu on hand at each restaurant, which makes their restaurants excellent choices when accommodating dietary preferences.",f62D2OZofCk7vNTfxjx1CQ,1,1,5,jaXu1grlFJCTg5LbDj6g_g

The food is good, the drinks are great, but the draw is the scene.

The food is delicious; cucumber roll, Waygu beef, short ribs, try them all. 

The staff is super friendly, super attractive and I always enjoy myself.....so will you",ex3p_Qnza72AuCG1pme6Xg,0,0,5,JuxEnvD4U5ycVP9sN3jkOQ

The ambience was very classy, but the blinds were not pulled up to see the nice view of the pool and the outside until we had already finished our meal which was a bit odd to me. None the less the experience was great and the service of the staff was very nice and friendly. My husband and I did look on yelp to try to find something good and within our budget to try so we chose the wagyu sliders (these were highly recommended by many other yelpers) crab fried rice, and shrimp pad Thai. Everything we had was great and very delicious. We even had room for dessert which we chose the chocolate orange sphere, the sphere didn't melt correctly like the other side of the tables sphere did so I was a little disappointed when I was recording but it was delicious. Overall, our party was a pretty big party and everyone enjoyed their food and desserts. I really loved how there was a a nice view outside but would've enjoyed it more if we were able to see if during our meal.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,yO0f5CmkaH-xCP6ev_mJzg
