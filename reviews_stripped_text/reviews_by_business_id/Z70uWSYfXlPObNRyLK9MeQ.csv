556100,2015-12-04,0,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"Course is decent. Keep 1 thing in mind this a a par 3 course. Greens are hammered. Staff was cool and only $20 I can't complain, though I should have read up more when I was trying to sneak in 9 as I arrive in Vegas",vUx8-ctO1a9fHAnY84iEqw,1,0,2,GVwbUdE_xeFCZKQiGqRQaA
578713,2015-07-10,0,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"Price is really great. The course is nicely maintained. Staff is overall nice except for one manager, Adam, who was not customer friendly. He would not honor a promotion on a phone app of which he had no knowledge of, although other managers have in the past. Carlos and the female bartender are really nice and accomadating.",eS2bsJLts0OUBuruQ7KrXQ,0,0,4,8d-MiRBAVKndfeBuaI4r-g
987377,2015-08-01,0,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"This course is in beautiful shape and I would love to rate it much higher. BUT, I went out with my 2 sons who are learning the game and we were treated so rudely by the individual who identified himself as the General Manager. We were following the rules of etiquette allowing several groups to play through, yet the GM felt compelled to come off with attitude that makes me not want to return.  We spent money in the restaurant (food was actually pretty good and the bartender was very nice!). Sadly, this course is ideal for those new to the game who are looking to learn. Not sure if I'll be back unless customer service improves.",PJTqIxVv3eQw_73irfodNw,2,0,2,PB4G1gzu53RcSvDsOH8JSg
1163164,2014-03-02,1,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"I most recently played here in early February. I usually play this as my ""warm up"" course when visiting Vegas before moving on to higher end ones. It's usually in pretty good condition, and due to the short length, it plays fast. I was paired up with 3 other folks, including a female beginner who could barely hit the ball outside of her shadow, and we finished in 3 hours with nobody pushing us and very little waiting in front of us. Good choice if you don't have all day to devote to a round. This course, like Las Vegas Golf Club, is also one of the few courses you can walk in Vegas, so that's a big plus in my book although most other folks I saw were in carts.",hr4TBY_sz5vwjVn8llE3sg,3,0,4,Vy81CRKXZ9J9JQtsEfVP_A

Nice looking place overall though I'm not a golfer I enjoyed seeing the ducks and rabbits everywhere.  No gophers that I could see.",3NW_sfFhRFxxmo3x4P7Dig,1,0,4,BKngnRvtwSVhir7jEHAyhg

3467900,2010-05-05,3,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"Getting to be the first to review this course seems fitting since I went there twice in the past 3 days. I only have a few issues with this course seeing as it is basically a glorified par 3 course.

One glaring issue is that the green fees are comparable to Rhodes Ranch which makes no sense. However, the coupons make playing a round less strenuous on your wallet. Another issue is the fact that one of the workers basically hassled us on the 15th green asking if we had actually paid for 18 holes. I'm pretty sure he is the same person who we paid so he should've already known that answer.

Other than that the course is definitely a bit short but fun for beginners. If you are looking to finish a quick 18 holes you should definitely check out this course.",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,5,2,3,sLEgBV22ddDsY9qqEYGM6Q
3839189,2015-05-19,1,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"Great executive municipal golf course. It's a little bit of a trek from the strip, but nothing crazy if you have a rental car. 
For 2 rounds of golf with cart rental and rental of 2 sets of clubs (which were brand new, mind you) it was $150.  The course is very well maintained and has a beautiful backdrop of the mountains. All par 3 holes which is good for me since I've only been playing a few years, and there were 4 par 4 holes. 

Staff was very friendly and then gentleman loading/unloading the carts was wonderful. I wish I could remember his name. 

I was told by a local he only gets charged $10 a game plus cart as a resident, which is a smoking deal!",ZpkLIzO7jkUFrLyRf2KbMQ,1,1,5,nF2GcR4eckcugIrgXbwhzg

5531178,2015-09-10,0,Z70uWSYfXlPObNRyLK9MeQ,"My sister and I decided to try out this course today since it was $10 and we are somewhat beginners. It started off great! Then we golfer out tee and unfortunately during this tee she lost multiple balls. As we were golfing our tee my sister picked up and looked at a ball that wasn't hers (it was on our green fairway). We were verbally attacked by men and called vulgar names for ""picking up"" a ball that was in our green. After being called and approached by 2 men for hitting their ball on our green we called the manager. They were very agressive and even at one point attempted to hit us with their golf ball. Due to them being ""regulars"" they felt untouchable. Which proved to be accurate... The manager, after speaking to the men that angrily rushed to him before we did said ""that's not like them, they weren't even drinking "".  As he heard these men tellinng us girls to meet them in the parking lot. 

I'm all for a cheap beautiful course. I am not ok with being called vulgar names and being threatened by ""regulars"" that pay $10!!!

Although cheap and a great deal, not worth it if your not a ""REGULAR"". Even after telling them that the men were waiting in the parking lot for us nothing was done.",c6Tmkli2ZKtq3pQ4wuzToA,3,0,1,HadeTnTygai0RUvFwgteHA

It's a nice course, only complain were the greens. They were kinda long and pretty bumpy. Not a bad course for a beginner.
