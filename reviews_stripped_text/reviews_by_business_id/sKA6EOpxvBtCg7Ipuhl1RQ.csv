490227,2017-12-29,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Been wanting to check this place out since I'm pretty sure this is the first revolving sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (as I miss places like this back in Hawaii).  
Place had a very modern/trendy vibe to it from the music they were playing and the I-pads you order from if you want something other than what is coming out on the conveyor belt.  We were seated immediately around 7 the day after Christmas,  but it was 2 of us, I think for larger groups there could be a longer wait.
If you are looking for an AYCE sushi place this is not it....but if you are looking for a quick sushi fix the fish was fresh and quickly served.  
My husband really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri. I tried a roll that had shrimp tempura in it (dont remember which one) but stayed away from other rolls that had it because I thought the tempura tasted stale.
Even though this is supposed to be a sushi restaurant we really enjoyed the garlic ramen, the broth was one of the best we've had in a while!",e5mj9DaE1ZWRGxWDCUgUQg,0,0,4,zQjE2J2eRjGtLwPgDqjMAQ

Your bill could be double want you normally spend. Two of us spent over $40 without alcohol, but we were still hungry after we left. My suggestion to the restaurant, the price should be lower or the size should be bigger.  This place is more for rich Asian people or people with small appetite.",GE_24bZyFzi2UIHbXjZQuQ,0,0,3,IyZr8SCEdU0_i10ru3C1tA
929547,2018-02-25,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"This might be our new favorite sushi spot! When we moved here from Hawaii 16 years ago we wondered why there were no rotary (or revolving) sushi places here - and now....there's one!! We were pretty excited to try it out. We went on a Monday afternoon & considering the reviews I read, I was surprised to see that it wasn't crowded (but maybe because it was a Monday). Anyhow, on to the review. The place was not too big and not too small.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered.  The host explained how everything worked - basically all the revolving plates were $2.50 and if you wanted something else from the menu then you ordered it via the iPad on your table. Then a little robotic thing comes out, stops at your table, beeps and tells you to remove your order and then you're done.

The variety for the $2.50 plates wasn't bad at all. The salmon and toro were good and I really liked that they didn't put so much rice with their sushi.  We also special ordered 4 pieces of uni ($2.50 per piece) and seared scallops with mango salsa ($7.95). Okay, so this is really the only thing we didn't care for. I know uni comes in different grades but this had to be the lowest grade. But I guess you get what you pay for.  And then the scallops....they looked beautiful on the plate but when we bit into it it was still very cold in the middle. The only thing worse would've been if the scallops were over cooked.  We just decided we wouldn't order those things again.

Overall, food was good, service was good and price was fair. Our bill came to $64 (including drinks).  I love that you don't have to wait for your food like you do with AYCE!",JT2OJOA04sep0Aqml_lBzA,0,0,4,BaPwtiU07O5SX3ZcMkPPCw
937513,2018-01-10,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,Nigiri sushi were some of the smallest sushi pieces I have ever seen. Two pieces together were about as big as one normal standard sushi piece. So really you are paying $5.00 a plate for2 pieces of sushi since they are half the size. But having said that it was pretty fresh for being in the middle of the desert. Service was good. And the drinks were good. So instead of two stars I'm giving it 3 stars. A solid C instead of a D.,pbPU2aL8-KIabVXQlbdSbQ,0,0,3,bITYGUrd1lMDLxgSqGUu4A

The location is very convenient, just off I-15, not too far from the the Strip, and a few exits away from the Airport. We wanted something that didn't have us sitting around waiting for our food, so this was a perfect option for us. It was around 1pm when we got inside the restaurant and we were seated right away. It got much busier towards the end of our meal, the tables and booths were filling up quick. The food was very good. The quality was definitely better than any other conveyor sushi places that I've had. They ensure freshness by removing plates that has been on the belt every 30 minutes or so.   They had an array of nigiri sushi,rolls, and other selections like poke tacos and popcorn lobster.    All the plates on the belt was 2.50, which wasn't bad especially for the quality of sushi they had.

Such a great way to try new things without committing to a whole roll. Nice ambiance and smart layout. There are touch screens at each booth to order from the menu. A robot brings it right to your table on the track. So fun! Items from the conveyor are fresh and replenished frequently. The tempura was piping hot with asparagus, sweet potatoes, and onions.

Cons:  If you are a sushi/sashimi connoisseur, then you might seek elsewhere.  The nigiri portions are about half of standard sized pieces and made with not all that particularly good quality fish.

The food was very fresh! They offer multiple types of tuna (and they do tuna tacos!!) Given that this is a landlocked state the fish was very good!!!

1079032,2018-01-26,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Pros - Beautiful new place. Neat concept. Decent sushi and prices. 
Cons - all the food is made behind a wall, so you can't see it being prepped. All the rolls are either made with crab mix, shrimp tempura, or spicy tuna. When I asked to have a roll made with regular tuna, I was told they couldn't do that. When I asked why, the waitress said there is too much of a price difference between the spicy tuna and the sushi tuna for them to do it. I have heard this excuse before, and what it means is that the restaurant is buying tuna that is not sushi grade then dumping it into a blender with a bottle of hot sauce and that is what goes into those rolls. There is so much hot sauce and other items in the rolls that you don't notice the fish you are eating isn't meant to be consumed raw. They do this to maximize profits, by cutting corners. This is why they won't swap out the regular tuna to make the roll not spicy. Meanwhile, they are charging $9 - $13 per roll which is the same as the other restaurants in town that don't buy cheap fish. 
I went twice for the novelty of it, but I won't go back. I question the integrity of an establishment that does this.",68wjznRnXzSSD2sQj2kN-w,0,0,2,g0bPhgDreGGRul3iVdnQsQ

    Vegas has many MANY sushi restaurants, and I have been to my fair share, but Sapporo deserves a place at the top. It combines the fun of the conveyor belt and the friendliness of eating at a dear friend's house.

You can also order full size or additional items from the tablet at your table.

I came at lunch time on a Monday so it wasn't entirely busy and I admired how attentive the servers were. They explained to us the process of ordering conveyor belt style and there was an iPad available at each table for you to order from. I ordered the shrimp tornado which was extremely flavorful as well as the garlic edamame. I realized that ordering from the iPad would give you the full size order of the rolls while grabbing items off the conveyor belt had smaller portions for $2.50, which was pretty nice. I took a popcorn lobster off the conveyor belt because I wanted to try it, but my review is 4 stars because of that. I loved the flavors they were trying to present but the lobster itself wasn't doing it for me. It seemed almost all batter in comparison to lobster meat. Nonetheless I do enjoy this place and I look forward to coming back because their quality seems fresh and I want to their speciality kitchen menu items. Overall, with the full shrimp tornado roll, garlic edamame, and mini popcorn lobster roll off the conveyor belt the price came out to be $15 which isn't too expensive at all!

1380599,2018-01-08,1,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Came here for the first time with someone who has came during the soft opening. This is my first revolving/conveyor belt sushi experience. 

Located in between Decatur and Arville on Spring Mountain, next to Hotai Furniture, it is the new ""hype"" thing to come to Las Vegas ! There was a small wait as they had not opened the standalone section to the right. The restaurants layout is a bit different from what you usually see in other revolving sushi places. Typically they'd have 1 line that runs through all the tables. For Sapporo, they have 1 that runs through 2 sections, and another small one that runs the 3rd section. As they were still in the early stages of opening, they didn't open the 3rd section completely. 

We were sat in the new section shortly and was greeted by the waiter and owner, Freddy. Throughout the dinner, he showed his passion and timeline on how this restaurant came to be. Who would have guessed it took 3 years for this all to come to be? To even hear chains like Kula, etc had failed as well ! 

We had ordered a Kirin draft beer to share and then we had waited for the conveyor belt to be filled. There was some deal for draft beer NOT including blue moon (of course ..) so we picked Kirin. 

I had a few friends come here previously, including her, and showing pictures of how amazing the uni and toro looked, so i was really looking forward to these two, as well as some other items. 

Sexy Mama Roll, Tiger Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll - Can't really say too much about rolls. As expected to taste like whats in it. Can't really judge rolls that well. Lol

Salmon Nigiri - Fresh fatty salmon sushi. What more can i say? Can't say much about the rice. Its ok. Prefer more of a vinegar-y taste but thats all personal preference 

Orange Salmon - Very similar to the sake orenji at Yonaka. Slices of fatty salmon belly on top of wedges of orange, topped with orange masago with yuzu oil around. This dish is like an orange/citrus bomb. The salmon was very good but im afraid the orange/citrus covers the salmon flavor almost completely. Need a tone down on that citrus explosion ! 

Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll - Lightly battered crispy soft shell crab hand roll. pretty yummy overall over those who like soft shell crab. Never seen this before. May prefer just a straight up normal soft shell crab appetizer vs handroll though. But thats not their fault. Just personal preference

Red snapper Nigiri, Surf Clam, - Very typical nigiri

Yellowtail and Salmon Taco - by special order train. This reminded us of the tostadas at Soho that we used to love getting for happy hour. Small bite sized tacos with fresh fish was quite yummy. Good little bite sized snack/appetizer ! .... as if everything else wasnt bite sized anyway XD 

Uni Nigiri - creamy sea butter, comparable to a specially ordered tray of uni i had the night before from Santa Barbara. 

Toro Nigiri - this first found, was disappointing. Was not how i had expected the toro to be like. This was grabbed from the conveyor belt. Quite lean to be called toro. 

Green tea roll cake - Specialty dessert created by on-site japanese patissier. 

Toro (Round 2) - before i go into talking about this round, here's some back story. I was talking to freddy for like the 5th time during this meal and he had mentioned in the system, there should be different selections for grade or type of toro you are ordering. Makes sense since there's theres typically chu-toro, o-toro, or just different grades in general. If i were to ""grade"" the first found, it would be borderline normal tuna vs any part of the belly. I had a round two sent out, and this was completely different. Melt in mouth, fatty goodness. Even the marbling of the fat and color and look was completely different. THIS is what toro should be, AT LEAST. I'm not a fan of otoro as it has too much fat, to point where its almost more fat than flesh, some with thick banding of fat. This piece was more similar to like chutoro. Which was great ! 

Anything you see on the belt can be ordered on the iPad. Only downside of it all is you dont get to see prior to receiving it.  Which is what i did for the 1st round of toro. The 2 that was out on the belt didn't look good so i took a chance and ordered it on iPad. Nope. Lol Of course since it was still soft opening, there were still glitches in the system that had to be worked out. Can't ding them for that. Would love to come back to try again to see what new items they will have !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,3,4,bHgwpCN6t2ncJuW-8imO2A

I really enjoy the way we can easily pick our sushi off of the conveyor belt and the ease of ordering from the tablet menus. The servers are quick, courteous, friendly and fast with our order. The dish on the conveyor belt are all $2.50 a piece. You can also order a full roll, appetizers, ramens, and desserts. All reasonable priced. 

We ordered everything to try, everything was delicious! Our favorite were the shrimp tacos, popcorn lobster roll, salmon skin hand roll, Sapporo salmon roll, crunchy roll, pork belly, and the various ramens. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to try smaller serving of different sushi verses going to an all-you-can-sushi place where you have to eat it all or pay for it.

They have toro=fatty tuna, uni=sea urchin, salmon roe=ikura and mackerel=Saba. They are my favorites and I usually judge if they are good, they are good Restaurant and I will come back again.

I had black garlic ramen at the end which was surprisingly good. Portion was 1/2size of regular ramen. It was perfect size as Shime=closing of meal.",csvo3wv5_epzAvcHhieFnA,0,0,4,UGTx1jV9xwt8yz9l1Ms5nw

The prices help control costs if you don't want to do AYCE. I did enjoy the hand rolls but everything else was okay.,_7PfR6Tvh2xTbiVi1GELoQ,0,1,3,HJjKTjmG42W3BacoDlGyLg
1446051,2017-12-31,2,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"This is probably the most fun you'll have at a sushi restaurant.  Conveyor belt sushi is something I have always wanted to experience since I saw it on an episode of Lonely Planet about 20 years ago.  The thing is when you have 50-100 pieces revolving around at room temperature you're not guaranteed a fresh piece every time; it's not really about the quality here as much as it is about the gimmick.  But, anyway, staff is very friendly, very accommodating, and the environment her is very positive.

Also the pepper tuna is absolutely nasty; its like licking the steel on a WWII battleship.

Edit: from a comment from the owners, the plates are RFID tracked for freshness, which is refreshing to know. Just a tip to the restaurant, it would be comforting for the staff to inform their customers of this when we sit down.",PoLD7pGH6hxAx3iTRygF4w,0,0,3,QGYfevqA4vidSWIpN5fK-w
1450887,2018-01-17,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday night expecting it was going to be busy. Turns out there was no wait so we were seated right away. Living in Hawaii we were already used to the conveyor belt system, since we were so obsessed with Genki Sushi in Oahu, so it wasn't as amusing for us. It's nice to have one here in Vegas though. 

As we walked in, the restaurant looked very clean and interior decorations were nice. I wasn't craving sushi at all that night and not being able to eat raw food, I didn't enjoy the food as much as my fiancé did. He ordered most of the plates that were very popular on yelp like the orange salmon, uni, sashimi, toro, blue fin tuna, etc, which were pretty high quality, fresh and so tasty he said. I ordered the ramen which was great for the price, and very flavorful. The rolls were decent like any other sushi place. One thing I really liked is how they have smaller portions of the rolls in the conveyor belt rather than paying $7-$12 for the full roll. Which I think was very clever of them. 

I'm giving 4 stars because as for service, the first waitress we had didn't bring us water, she seemed too busy walking around chatting with other workers. We had to ask another waiter to bring us glass of water and to ask to take our plates because it was getting a little cramped. Our first waitress finally came around our table but didn't even check up on us, she only came by to take some of our plates and wipe down the table next to us.

Since I didn't eat much and my fiancé ate like we were at an AYCE, we did pay a little bit more than expected. My only advice is, do not take your other half here if she/he is very very VERY hungry! Or You'll be paying more than an All You Can Eat bill. Other than that, it was a nice experience.",oYMpPlokWRrw-11AKEQMhA,3,0,4,p5gsL66nPyLIeqvrHOofkQ

1500331,2018-01-21,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"This was certainly a new and pleasant experience for my friends and I. Informative too. 
Upon entry, the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. Our server, Jay (?) was nice to explain the process of food going around the restaurant, such as chefs putting fresher items on the conveyor belt after every 30 minutes. Another detail to note was that, certain nigiri dishes had to be ordered specifically from the table's iPad (e.g. uni). The amount of stacked plates were also counted at the end of the meal to calculate your total, along with the billed amount from the iPad. For example, my friends and I pulled off 16 plates off the conveyor belt ($2.50/each), and ordered at least 5 other dishes (primarily special rolls and dessert) from the iPad (alone, totaled around $96) with a bottle of sake. Total bill came out to be around $145 (includes tax, but excludes gratuity). 
Back to service... Knowledgeable and accommodating staff was appreciated. Also liked the way Jay had us check the bottle of sake (right brand and size) was alright with us before bringing out a cold one to chill in an ice bucket. Not to mention that he and his co-workers checked on us throughout the meal, and managed to throw in a joke or 2 around with us (e.g. we ordered all three dessert cakes). 
The food, itself, was good. Made me think of what's served at other sushi restaurants around town, so it's up to par in terms of quality. I think I just appreciated the overall experience as a nice introduction to this kinda restaurant. 
If I could mention one suggestion, it would be to stack the covers instead of the plates from the conveyor belt. I understand that the items need to be counted/tracked, but the covers looked neater stacked on the side, and did not have food (crumbs) on the plates to look at during our entire meal.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,0,4,A2iCA9fV3fxSoKoN1igSjg

Coming here, I didn't have a much of an expectation since a lot of revolving sushi restaurants I've tried in Cali are just fads. When we walked right in, the place is very roomy and has a bunch of tables, we came during dinner rush but only waited for about 5-10 minutes. 

Everything on the menu is $2.50 a plate, unless you want full-sized rolls then they'd be about $7. They explained that they have a timer on each of their plates that come out of the conveyor belt and after 30 minutes of being on the belt, they automatically get rid of them. Salmon is my favorite sashimi and I must say, I was very impressed with the quality! Super fatty and fresh. I also really liked the lobster popcorn roll. If you ever want something that you're not seeing on the conveyor belt, you can always order on the ipad and it'll come to you hot and fresh!

You are able to order a la carte items as well as choosing from the great rotating dishes. The service is also great!

1729371,2018-03-06,5,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Ever since I went to a conveyor belt sushi spot in LA, I've been wondering when we'd get one here. Sapporo opened about 3 months ago, and I come here fairly regularly. They use a microchipped plate system to stay within health code regulations and ensure that product is not sitting out for very long, so everything is fresh.

I initially came in for their grand opening and was able to try several of their dishes and have since come back for birthdays, with visitors from out of town, and just as a general spot to catch up with friends at a new and interesting place. Management knows they are competing with AYCE pricing and having the variety of belt and higher-quality kitchen dishes makes them stand out. You'll probably spend about the same amount as AYCE, or a bit more.

The conveyor belt has apps, 3-piece rolls, nigiri, and the occasional dessert, with all plates priced at $2.50. The fish has been consistently fresh on my visits, and the belt allows you to grab a bite as soon as you sit down without waiting on service. I especially like their kitchen items, which are electronically delivered as well- they've consistently added to the menu over time, offering dishes that are similar to other spots in town (Yonaka's Sake Orengi, Pier 215's soft shell crab, etc.) but at a lower price point. I'll be trying their new Truffle Octopus dish next time.

Favorite items include the garlic tuna, orange salmon, scallops and branzino (cooked), the hand rolls, and the Valley of Fire roll (full size only). The guests I've taken have been especially excited about the sushi tacos, pork belly, and mini-ramen bowls (black garlic especially), but the novelty of the technology doesn't get old. 

Service has always been attentive and helpful. Though staff is not actively coming by to take orders (you use the iPad), drink refills are consistently timely and everyone has been polite. Occasionally, orders will be delayed due to tech issues, but it's only happened once across several visits.

TIP: Check their social media for the occasional contest. This brand is opening a KBBQ conveyor belt business soon, too!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,30,17,4,KmAgoxVXNhvANaPcSiXstA

I have to say that I am not a fan of mayo and cream cheese with my sushi, so many items were lost on me. I did enjoy the crab sushi, plain so you could actually taste the crab, which was good--and it wasn't Krab. I'd prefer a California Roll with a piece of crab instead of the smooshed up mixture found here and elsewhere. The cooked scallops were great, because they weren't overcooked; some might call them undercooked, but I don't. I wouldn't order two plates of tempura again; one is all I can handle, for sure, before the fat drags me down. I wouldn't go that far just for the sushi, but I would take kids there.

The atmosphere & dining area here was clean and very modern. Our server was Jeremy and he was attentive & checked up on us frequently. Since it was our first time here , he explained to us how everything worked w/ their iPad ordering system & conveyor belt. Their ordering system was user friendly. Everything on conveyor belt was 2.50$ which I appreciate that they kept it simple.
Onto the menu items - the quality of the fish w/ their rolls is similar to what you can get at AYCE. What I HIGHLY recommend is their orange salmon (order it on their iPad). Their orange salmon was my absolute favorite , definitely worth the 7.95$. My boyfriend loved the cheese tonkatsu appetizer & spider handroll. I liked that their handrolls aren't stuffed with just all rice.
The only menu item we didn't like that we ordered was the black garlic ramen. The broth had good flavor especially with the black garlic oil , but the noodles were way too overcooked. If the noodles weren't so soggy and had more than just one small pork slice then it would be good value for it's 4.25$ price. 
Dinner was around $52 total for the two of us. So it's pretty much about the same price as doing AYCE & we left pretty full and satisfied. Could've just ordered like 6 or 7 of those orange salmon only and left happy too. Overall - decent quality & great service.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,5,4,5,dSYCkGQjA24N43XoAps1hg

1790216,2017-12-18,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I was really looking forward to having a rotating sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, I was used to going to many of them in Los Angeles... which gives me pretty high standards. 

And I know they just opened but, my experience was terrible and I'm not going back. 

They did give us a discount because were so many problems over all that night with lack of food on their conveyor belts and slow service. But that still doesn't make me want to go back. 

Pros: 
The staff was nice, large space, clean, and nice aesthetics. 

Cons: 
1. The conveyor belts had like nothing 85% of the time we were there. When there was stuff on the conveyor belt it was only sashimi and no rolls at all or any variety. (Tried to attach a video I took but it doesn't give me an opinion to post it, I see if I can post it at some point) and we were there around 8pm on a Saturday and there were a lot of people. Also some of the times that they did have items on the conveyor belt they didn't match the title card that was in front of them. (Towards the time we were leaving, like after an hour was when they started to have more items on the conveyor belt, but again all sashimi and nothing else)

2. A lot of the food had no taste

3. The pictures on the screens don't really match to the size that you get. For example I got an avocado roll and it was the size of my finger it was so tiny(looked much smaller than the picture see attached) 

4. The iPads they use for the orders don't swivel to your direction so it's very annoying, it stays perpendicular to you at all times. And screen is so sensitive that if you tap on something by mistake, it puts the item in your order list, then when you go to your screen were you double check your order before ordering it, things will pop up that you didn't even know you pressed. You can delete them before you press order. But it's very annoying. 

5. There are no descriptions of what is in any of the food. If you're ordering a roll for example you don't know what's in the roll unless it's like a basic California roll or something. If you order a specialty roll or more pricey food you have no idea what's in it. 

6. The rotating belt delivery boat for when you order something off the screen didn't work on our row but It worked on the other two. All our food had to be delivered by servers. The servers kept asking us over and over which items we had received from our order, which got really annoying. 

In my opinion, It's a very large conveyor belt sushi restaurant which shocked me that they weren't prepared for the amount of people that they had that night. It's the first one in Vegas.... you're gonna have a lot of people. Any place that I've ever been to has tons of food on the conveyor belts at all times and are much smaller places with people waiting outside for 2 hours. 

When you go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant you want your food then and there, it goes very quick. You shouldn't have to wait because there's nothing on the conveyor belt, then you have to place the order without knowing what half of the food is and then wait for a server to bring it to you. (some food is self-explanatory by looking at it, but certain items are not) If that were the case I could've gone to a regular all you can eat sushi restaurant that lists all the food and ingredients and it's only brought by a server.


Take a look at Kula in Los Angeles for an example of how to run a restaurant like this. There restaurants are small and are super crowded and sometimes you have to wait outside for two hours. But they always have food on the conveyor belts from the second you sit down. And it's a variety of salads, rolls, sashimi, desserts, etc. They even have sashimi that isn't raw fish and alternatives if you don't eat fish or raw fish other than tamago. (Though the aren't perfect by any means, but there a great example of always being busy and being on top of their food and having their conveyor belts and boats work.)

Maybe doing research on other conveyor belt sushi restaurants would help to fix certain problems.",T_OFSHBdfOHcT7QlM-2qDw,1,0,1,w9oUX7NQfoNh4V6PGC-JUA

1876137,2017-12-12,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"So I've only given this restaurant 4 stars because I didn't get to try as many diverse items as possible. I ordered a couple apps, and tried a few specialty rolls. 
The sushi was really good, you have the choice of picking it up from the conveyer belt or having it delivered to your table from ordering on the tablet. I noticed that when I ordered from the tablet my food was a lot warmer. Nonetheless, the plates on the conveyer belt are kept for 30 minutes and then new plates are placed afterward. Also, not every single item from the menu will be on the revolver, it was mostly nigiri and a few specialty rolls and appetizers. The most memorable appetizer I got was the shrimp taco, pictured, it was so delicious! 
I'm making this my #1 for sushi, and reason being, 1. The food was great compared to other AYCE spots, 2. The prices are cheap, and 3. It's easier to keep track of how much you're eating so that you don't get too full or can't finish what you've ordered.
The ambience is great for different occasions. The booths are quiet spacious, making it welcoming for large groups.

1907613,2018-01-03,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"This place brings rotating sushi to a new level! I've been to rotating sushi places in Asia, but this place is more hip and fun. Instead of bar seating, there are private booths that surround the sushi conveyor belt. Service was really good since the place was pretty empty. Our waiter came by to explain how each plate off the conveyor belt was $2.50 and how to work the iPad. Numerous other people came by to fill up water and pick up plates.

Each dish on the conveyor belt is never left on there for more than thirty minutes, meaning the dish is fresh. The plates typically have two pieces of sashimi or three pieces of a roll. Along with common sashimi pieces and rolls, there were some trendy items, such as sashimi tacos or unique rolls. From the belt, I had a salmon taco and octopus nigiri. We then ordered a few items from their main menu off the iPad. Their prices are pretty good. We ordered a $5 small bowl of ramen, $7.50 tiger roll, and $2.50 squid nigiri. The tiger roll was medium sized and beautifully presented. The ramen noodles were delicious, but their broth was too salty and there were not enough toppings. I really enjoyed the quality of the squid nigiri. It's incredibly fun when the iPad pieces come out, since they send this robot that zooms down the conveyer belt to where you sit! 

I loved how modern and chic this place is. The prices are too high for me to order everything I wanted, so if I wanted to gorge, I would go for AYCE.",57a4rVQ2Po6csI7VxBEjGA,1,1,4,A5BEjlFHSfbZG7P76TOeqw

With that being said, I'll just list a few menu items I really liked and thought was a great value to get at the place. Deducting a star because the rice was dry and a little on the tough side. 

1. Uni, really sweet and fresh. Unlike a lot of AYCE places with salty sea water tasting/fishy uni;
2. Premium Yellowtail nigiri: the fish was just so buttery!
3. Salmon belly: same reason as #2.
4. The yuzu dessert cake: two pieces of perfect bite sized cake to end a meal

We also ordered some large plates (tuna tartare, something of yellowtail, scallops, etc.) They were just okay. They have ramen as well. With $2.5/small plate, I can see it being a good place for a quick lunch and a quick stop to satisfy some sushi cravings.

I'd definitely want to go back and try more things.",M2whdwvMtNxLllxOvt7cOw,3,0,4,5dfPt-SNEazDjGjFLCrzIQ

1981815,2017-12-13,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"My sister has been waiting for a place like this so we came for dinner after the movies, around 8pm. The place was very clean, very spacious, with modern decorations, overall a nice and comfortable environment. 

Our server Ann Marie was very sweet, attentive, explained the menu and their system to us very well. Food was also pretty good, fish were fresh, rolls were decent, they don't have a big appetizer menu but what they do have were very good. 

Now the cons:
- Their ""Popcorn Lobster Roll"" - the description said ""deep fried lobster..."", they did not use lobster meat they used crawfish. First off the fake lobster came out cold and soggy, not crispy. My sister was the first to notice that it was not lobster meat because it did not look like chunk of lobster meat but looked like a whole crawfish. I then peeled the batter off and saw that it was indeed a crawfish. I included a picture. False advertisement!!
- We were seated in the far right ""lane,"" as soon as we sat down I saw that at the end of the other two lanes there were cooks working constantly putting plates on the revolver, there were no one at the end of our lane working. As such, we picked up a few that we wanted then sat there waiting for more to come, our lane had 6 tables with no new plates coming out while the lane next to us had 3 tables and their lane was filled with plates. We ended up ordering from the iPad, which to me defeats the purpose of coming to a revolving sushi place. The head chef needs to keep an eye on the floor and make sure they assign cooks where necessary. 
- My sister and I ordered an udon and a ramen to end our meal, mine came out while hers did not. After a little while we asked about her ramen and our server told us that they had made the ramen but lost the ticket so the ramen was sitting in the window. The ramen was cold so we asked them to heat it up for us, the waitress brought it back to the kitchen saying ""They want it hot"" - and I saw the cook annoyingly say something to the waitress and shook her head, she then saw me looking at her and stopped. If you have an open kitchen please advice your staff about making faces and complaining in front of the guests.

Overall, I have no issue with the quality of the fish or most of the dishes. We ordered a few items from the iPad and they were very good. But for a first impression this place fell short, from the lack of plates on the revolver to the mishaps (telling us we ordered more than we did because they got multiple tickets, the ramen not coming out) and the false advertisement it was not a great experience. For me personally I chose to come here and was willing to pay more for it so I had higher expectations. I think they are still new and still have some kinks to work out.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,1,2,9ktF_IcaFxnOqWojegy5Cw

2006839,2017-12-09,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"The wife and I are big fans of ""track sushi"" in general and used to go out for it frequently when we were living in the NW; apparently, this style of sushi restaurant is relatively new to the area, as Sapporo Revolving Sushi was one of only two or three listings in the entire city. We decided on SRS because it was close to our home and also because it was newly opened and we like to support local businesses, being local business owners ourselves :)

We arrived about 10 minutes before their 5pm opening and were able to find parking right away, even though the lot is one of several on Spring Mt. that are quite small and obviously not intended for its current use/tenants. 
Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by warm and friendly staff who, after a brief exchange between the two servers about who was assigned where this evening that actually served to make us feel more comfortable (laugh), seated us in a small booth, left of the right-most aisle.

Our server took our drink orders, after informing us that the night's special included all 3 imported beers on their beverage menu for a reduced price of $1.95 per draft ( a deal that both the wife and I took advantage of!), left, and shortly returned with our beers, leaving us to peruse the menu and eyeball the delicious items passing us on the conveyor belt next to our table. 

The menu itself is an ""Ipad-style"" touchscreen which features all of the selections at SRS and even allows diners to review the individual ingredients before ordering, to ensure that they know and like what they will get.

While I played with the shiny gadget, my wife pulled a few items from the sushi track. (We had been informed, while chatting w/ our server, that all the track dishes were priced at $2.50 per plate and had sensors timing them to a freshness of 30 min. or less). 

We finally found a few items we would like to try on the touchscreen menu and placed our order for a few half-rolls ($3.50 ea.). We were surprised to find out that orders placed on the pad arrive via a motorized cart (that we had not even noticed up until it arrived, flashing and beeping at our shoulders, lol), which rides along a dedicated rail that is installed at eye-level on top of the sushi track. 

Grab your order, press a button to send the little robot back down the track to its next order, and enjoy!

The food itself was wonderful and all of the items I sampled were delightfully fresh and flavorful. The staff were friendly and helpful, gladly explaining how to order when asked, and the owners themselves were even in attendance, going table to table greeting guests and showing off neat menu features and items (try the ""mexican roll"" if you're a fan of spicy crab!)

We will be making SRS a weekly night out from this point on and highly suggest you do the same ;)

This place is all around great. First off the food and prices are amazing! Every plate on the conveyor belt if $2.50, specialty rolls are $7 - 9, ramen is only $4, and drinks are $2 - 7.
I thought the sushi was pretty high quality and definitely worth $2.50. The garlic edamame and black garlic ramen are insanely good! Seriously $4.00 ramen, you can't go wrong. 
They also offer hand rolls, tempura and dessert. Make sure you look through the menu as they have nigiri not usually on the conveyor. 
I really like how updated this place is. It's very sleek and clean. The staff are super friendly and are very efficient.  
This place is a great option for those who don't want to explode from all you can sushi places and who don't want to go to a fancy overpriced sushi bar.
 
TIPS: Visit this place before their prices go up. It is super affordable for the quality and novelty. 

Get there early. We arrived at 11:35am (5 minutes after they opened) and they were almost full.

They had only been open for about a week and a half when we went , so our server was kind of new to everything. Our wait to get seated was about 15 minutes on a Friday evening around 7pm.
The whole conveyor belt thing is pretty neat. Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50. Nigiri will either have 2 pieces or 1 piece depending on the fish. Special rolls are about 4 pieces. 
They have an ipad at each table as well where you can order other items. The food ordered from the ipad will either be delivered by your waiter or come out on the robot straight to your table. It was like a mini surprise each time the robot came to our table! 
Our table ordered lots of food and grabbed many plates off the belt. 28 plates to be exact from the belt alone. I lost track of how much we ordered from the ipad.  We ended up splitting the bill at the end, and the  price comes out to about the price of an AYCE place. For some reason, they could not split the bill into 4 cards evenly. The amount kept getting messed up. No big deal though....we just had 1 person pay the whole tab lol. 
They do have a bar in the front of the restaurant. I definitely see myself coming back for more sushi.
My favorites would be the Toro, Blue fin tuna, Pork belly, and Orange salmon.",dAfdS9l7DOMze3orptDxiQ,6,1,5,tFZqkYNLRnoA91GqBohAVw
2183797,2018-04-07,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I have been wanting to try a revolving sushi spot for years and was very excited when my girl told me there was one in town.  I jumped at the chance to meet her there and try it out, even though it was pretty late.  Got there and the place was large, which was surprising due to it being in Chinatown.  Even though it was large, half of the restaurant was closed which resulted in us waiting for an hour to get in, even though it was past 11:00 pm.  Maybe they didn't have enough chefs scheduled that late, idk.  I would definitely recommend staffing more though in the future, especially since it is HH late at night.  
Finally sat down and it was so cool!  The food just comes around your tables and you grab what you want!  I know this is the core concept but for someone who has never experienced that, it was pretty dope.  Normally the plates are $2.50 each but during HH the plates were $1.50!  $1.50 sounds awesome until you find out that each plate has like 3 bites of food on them, which again, I suppose is part of the concept, to try a bit of everything without breaking the bank.  The sushi itself was just alright too, nothing over the top or amazing although I did see a few things I haven't before (sushi tacos and some lobster thing).  Let's just say I was lucky I wasn't that hungry or I would've ended up spending a whole lot more than $9.  Yes, I could've ordered whole rolls and other dishes at full price from the iPad on the table, and yes, I could've seen them delivered to my table on a cool light train but as I said earlier, I wasn't terribly hungry.  
Concept: Awesome/Awesome
Decoration: Pretty nice
Service: Staff was very very nice but when everything but seating and drinks is automated it makes tipping a bit weird.
Food: Not bad sushi for the plates that I had.
Hipster factor: Yes
Will I go here again?: Yes because my friends are dying to try it and I can always go for a few cheap bites of sushi.  I also want to try their other dishes!

Tips:  Go during HH.  Don't go if you are really hungry/have a big appetite and are on a budget.  Go to experience something new.  Prepare for a long wait if half of the restaurant is closed and there is any semblance of a line.  Definitely a cool experience though.",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,3,1,3,oIGbfkqCGucuTRxBBWWLaw

I had to switch spots with my husband to keep an eye on the fresh sushi plates the chef in the kitchen are putting on the belt to avoid grabbing a piece that's been sitting on the conveyer for a while. They need to put Sushi on a chilled plate to keep the temperature control. This is important esp knowing how hot our summers are here & people can get sick eating warm raw seafood. This should be fixed IMMEDIATELY!! 
Service was excellent everyone was friendly with a happy smile on their face. 
Fish quality- i would give a C+ but for $2.50 a plate I didn't expect Nobu Or Raku quality. I'm also not a fan of AYCE due to the lack of quality. 
Please use chilled plates or else i see trouble with food poisoning claims in the near future.

It probably didn't help that we had ultra premium sushi at Yui Sushi Edomae just a few hours prior to eating here with friends.  From the 4.5 star Yelp reviews I had overly high expectations that were not met by the quality.

Most of what we ordered was from the conveyor belt, with a few add ons.   Prices are a very reasonable $2.50 per plate except for items ordered from the iPad at your table.   Some of our more memorable dishes:

* Black garlic ramen:  while it looked good, the broth had no depth or richness of flavor.  3/5

* Cheese tonkatsu:  ordered this out of curiousity.  Interesting fried cheese bits -- worth trying once but a bit dry.  3.5/5

* Gyoza:  Very standard, could be a little crispier.  3.5/5

* Black pepper tuna:  one of the more interesting nigiri.  Almost tasted like jerky.  3.5/5

* Hamachi tacos:  nice crispness from the taco but the fish flavor was a bit muted.  3.5/5

Revolving sushi is a neat concept and a fun experience, but it does tend to add up if you order a lot. Plates here are $2.50 each no matter what it is, which I'm assuming is to help streamline the tally at the end. A bit different than other revolving sushi spots I've been to where the price will vary depending on the item. 

The quality of the nigiri really surprised me. I had some tasty plates, such as the hamachi and the maguro. On the flip side, if you come at a down time, you'll have the same six rolls going around the conveyor. You also have the option to order other sushi/side dishes off a tablet that is at your table. There is a little robot train thing that delivers your food above the conveyor, which is adorable. To send it back to the kitchen after you grab your plate, just press the button. 

I'd say that if you are coming here with a big appetite, do expect to pay more than an AYCE restaurant (it was about $75+ tax/tip for the two of us). However, it's a cool experience and the food is good too.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,2,1,4,wNLR8ddGKfzHhz1BPbuhow

Inside is a smaller lobby that opens into the dining and bar area. On a side note, the architecture art wall is so cool to stop and look at. Solid wood octagons are hand carved and manipulated to give a 3D effect.

Food - of course you cannot compare revolving sushi quality to high-end omakase.  But for $2.50 you can get otoro, bluefin tuna, and uni, I would highly recommend ordering these! The quality is better than your average AYCE on these items.  However, if you were to eat your heart out as if you were at an AYCE like I did, if could get pricey.  My bill was $85 for two ppl. (I did most of the ordering and eating :/)

The toro is a hit or miss.  I've gotten the perfect ones, but I've also gotten the ones with tendon :(

Salmon sashimi with orange.  It's refreshing but be sure to order it with light sauce so it's not drowning in ponzu.

Tuna tartar - the first time I ordered it, it was drowning in ponzu so I returned it.  I gave it a second try during my second visit and asked for light sauce, turns out the heavy ponzu was probably used to mask the fishy taste.  Will not order this item again. 

Service - I've been here 3 times and you can tell they really got the whole service thing down!  Great experience every time!

Granted the quality you get at any revolving spot is usually mediocre at best, but that's where Sapporo stands out from the rest. The quality for all the fish was excellent, extremely fresh, and priced decently at only 2.50 per white revolving plate.

Their ordering system works good as well and is very user friendly and easy to figure out; allowing you the options to order, remove orders, pictures, and even an info section that informs you of what is included in certain specialty rolls.

I'm not particularly a big sushi roll eater because most places seem to over sauce their concoctions but at Sapporo they figured out how to perfect the amount of sushi to yum yum/eel sauce ratio. Trust me on this one, nothing is worse than an overly sauced drowned out roll.

You can also order items from the kitchen that comes out via a plate on a track that comes presented to your table side. Items on this menu can range anywhere from 6-10+ dollars. My favorite from this section was the orange salmon. It's almost identical to a similar favorite dish of mine at another restaurant here in Vegas but cheaper ($7). It's citrusy, fresh, and spot on so good it'll make you wanna ""slap yo mama.""

The experience is both fun and entertaining to order and allows you to get just the right amount of food you want without over eating. The only dish I don't think I was over fond of was the baked cod and soft shell crab. The crab was a little salty while the presentation was beautifully done, and for the baked cod it came out in this sort of mushy texture which was sort of strange despite the flavor still being pretty good.

Aside from these minor details though, the over all experience was amazing and I would definitely come back to try their scallops, ramen, or just stop by for some fresh sushi.

Staff were both informative and polite upon the moment we entered to the second we left, and the owner (Freddy) was extremely kind to our party and generous to us. We definitely plan to come back again in the near future for some more!",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,10,2,5,O2OghQNt5DsCnoAkomM-qQ

If you're looking to try conveyor belt sushi, stop by the original - Sapporo! Looking forward to many more visits and more awesome sushi!",RYcAA2oVx8iKHzBAhVcHkg,0,0,5,ldHoyHZ2Cnsz-6Ejvc2ziA

I enjoyed the novelty of delivery and quality of food offered here.  at a $2.50 price point per item on the conveyor belt the night was met with a well appeased appetite.  They offered other foods besides sushi....I tried the Ramen.  Not bad (considering this restaurant focuses on sushi and my experience with ramen dedicated venues).

We were seated and immediately got to see a wide variety of small plates displayed on the revolving belt. We chose a couple drinks and looked over the menu / iPad which is on each table. We ordered the Ginza Mule and Hana Sake which were both delicious 5/5. Plenty of great items to choose from, made fresh and placed on the belt for quick turn around or place an order on the iPad on each table and the item will either be sent via a robot who blinks and plays music at you or by the less conventional human being ;-). The server told us the items stay on the belt a maximum of 30 minutes. 

We began grabbing plates off the belt including: sea bass, salmon, tuna, shrimp tacos, squid, white tuna, New Zealand salmon which is delicious, a couple rolls, seaweed salad, halibut. And before we knew it had devoured 18 plates worth of sushi! From the iPad we chose the hamachi carpaccio which was superb 5/5!

For dessert we shared a bowl of pistachio ice cream 5/5. 

Overall this place was amazing! Can't wait to come back and update this review.

***update a week later:
We came back with the family this time and enjoyed more great sushi, some ramen noodles and popcorn lobster. For dessert I highly recommend the strawberry shortcake 5/5. The table for 6 was about a 15-20 minute wait but well worth it. The entire family enjoyed a great meal for lunch. We devoured 22 plates and about 8 items from the menu.

The conveyor belt goes pretty fast and theres this interesting robot machine thing on top that drops off food (which confused us a bit cause we never knew if the food on there was for us or the table next to us).  I did like that we were able to order from the tableside tablet.  Everything is pretty good but can get pretty pricey.

2543289,2018-06-20,3,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Came for their Happy Hour and wasn't disappointed. We arrived at 11pm on a Saturday and of course there was a wait (but not too long!). 

Decided to kill time by stopping at the bar to take advantage of their 50% off Japanese Draft Beer. The bartender was helpful. He even gave me a taste of Asahi since I don't recall which one I liked better (Sapporo vs Asahi). Costing only $2 a glass, how can you say no to that Happy Hour deal? 

Even before we were done with our beer, we were shown to our seats. The booth was huge and comfy. (You can fit six people easily.) The conveyor belt was easily accessible. Appreciated the fact that there was a cover over each dish. (Some guy at another table was sneezing like no tomorrow.)

The conveyor belt had a variety of choices. The slices of sashimi was generous, while the rice underneath was minimal. The sushi rolls are 4 pieces per dish for the most part. There were appetizers such as seaweed salad and edamame. (Note: Garlic Edamame is spicy. It isn't labeled that way so beware!) And don't worry! If by the time the conveyor belt comes around to you and you're only greeted with a plaque with the name of the dish and no dishes to follow, it will be quickly replenished the next time around. Oh, and I nearly forgot, each dish is only $1.50 during Happy Hour. 

And whatever you can't find on the conveyor belt, you can order it from the screen located at your table. We wanted a miso soup to wash down all the deliciousness and was not disappointed when it was brought to us. (Sorry soup doesn't come flying out on top of the tracks of the conveyor belt!) However, Happy Hour prices doesn't apply to items ordered off of the screen.

30 minute wait for robotic gimmicks and below average sushi. Sure it's a fun idea, but the majority of sushi offered were not great, if not questionable. I think Ayce sushi offers better quality than this place. I was also shocked that the yellowtail was covered in brown sauce and tasted fishy. I knew right then that my stomach was in for a long & painful night. Oh and do not get the sauteed softshell crab, it tasted foul like it wasn't cleaned properly and was filled with poop in the center of the body. It was truly a disaster. 

On a positive note, I did enjoy the mini black garlic ramen and the handrolls were filled proportionally so it wasn't all rice. If I had to recommend something, get the salmon skin handroll, spider handroll & salmon crispy tacos.

If you're not feeling what's on the conveyor belt, you can order specific entrees from their iPad menu, and a little robotic trolley will deliver the food right to your table! Each dish off of the conveyor belt is $2.50, and they range from edamame to nigiri sushi to special rolls. 

The ambiance is nice and modern. All tables are booth style, and there are three conveyor belts. It looks like it gets pretty busy around the evening time.

2956060,2018-01-13,1,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I've been to Sapporo Revolving Sushi three times now and it's about time I write a long, insightful review about this restaurant!

This place is already one tier better than regular sushi places because of the convenience of the belt. How many times have you waited in line to get seated at a sushi restaurant, only to take another 10-20 minutes just to receive anything to eat? I know I have countless times. At Sapporo, once you're seated you can start eating right away. I love the convenience of that and better yet, the items on the belt are actually FRESH and DELICIOUS.

""But I don't want to eat sushi that's been sitting out!""

Don't worry! They monitor each plate that's sitting on the belt. How? Each plate on the conveyor belt is equipped with a microchip on the bottom. If a plate has been sitting on the conveyor belt for an extended period of time and deemed not fresh and delicious, the microchip sends a signal to the staff to remove it from the lineup. How cool is that? Quality assurance at its best 

To flex more technological awesomeness, each table at Sapporo is mounted with an interactive iPad menu. On this menu you can order items that are on the conveyor belt and much more. If you truly insist on eating nigiri fresh from the kitchen and not from the belt, you can order from the iPad menu.

Alongside nigiri you can find more items such as oysters, popular rolls, ramen and some unusual items such as bite-sized sushi tacos. Very tasty too.

And that's the thing. This restaurant has tasty and delicious varieties. Even after the novelty of experiencing the conveyor belt, it still holds itself as a great sushi restaurant.

I almost forgot to mention there's a full bar at one corner of the restaurant with some amazing drinks. My favorite is the green tea cocktail. A must try!

Will I return? Hell yeah!
Is the conveyor belt cool? Too cool.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,9,3,5,XadtUEJ7GTRF9F9W5o9Qxw

My family and I have been looking forward to coming here since it first opened and we finally did today! Pros - clean, neat, friendly staff. I love restaurants where the kitchen is visible so you know what goes on back there, and this is one of 'em. Everything on the conveyor belt is $2.50 and there are other varieties that you can order off the menu (iPad). Wanted to see what the hype was about with their black garlic ramen and the hype is real! Love it! Cons - with all the AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, coming here can be pricier (especially if you love sushi, like my family and I). Most of the nigiri plates on the belt mostly comes in twos. Their ama ebi & uni, which is always a must for me whenever I go to sushi restaurants, only came in one piece. Their fish to rice ratio is like many sushi spots. Our total came out to a little over $60 for three adults and a 5 y/o. Were we satisfied? Not really. Would I come here again? Maybe just for the black garlic ramen.

The fun part was watching my friend experience revolving sushi for the first time and hoping she didn't drop everything coming off of the belt. The food was delicious. I tried everything from toro to raw oysters. The only downside is that it all adds up very quickly. For our party of three, the bill came out to $99 (not including gratuity). Which compared to the all-you-can-eat options in the area it was a bit more expensive than most. However, the atmosphere was pleasant and the experience was fun.

I was real hungry and anxious to try several things but I still felt a little hungry after spending $40. I hope they offer ways to give better value for locals in the future. I wish they'd offer a buy 7 plates get 1 free, or free drink or dessert on orders over $30 maybe. 

This place is perfect for me because I love eating a variety of small dishes. My stomach is happy when I avoid the a.y.c.e. places where it's so easy to over stuff and feel bad afterwards. I left feeling like I could of ate more but was satisfied and happy to not be in pain. 

Several of the items I didn't get a chance to try because they were not on the conveyor belt and I'd of had to order a full roll to try them. A lot of the rolls are not on the belt. You must order 5 pieces of shrimp tempura, nothing smaller. It would get cold by the time I ate 2 so I passed on those. 

I had the owner/ manager walk back and forth past my table a 10x but never said hi or asked how I was. Not mad just something I suggest to the owner to do. The service is good though, employees were helpful and answered questions and kept the table clean and ice tea refilled.

My family and I have been wanting to come and try this place since it first opened up, but the few times that we had called to inquire about the wait times, it was a no go. Especially if you want to hit up this place on the weekends. So, we've put it off for a little. In the meantime, we have been faithful to our other go-to sushi joints lol

For our first visit, our group was told that the approximate wait time would be about 15 minutes. This held true as we were seated shortly after. Customer service was great and our table was constantly being checked up on to see if we needed anything else. But pretty much everything is done by yourself because all additional orders can be made on a personal tablet that is located on every table.

The restaurant's layout and design is modern yet simple. It has two sushi conveyor belts that past by all the tables, as well as two ""food monorails"" (as I call it lol) that deliver items that were ordered from the tablet. They run above the revolving sushi and will automatically stop at your table for you to grab. Awesome!

All the revolving food are covered with clear tops for visibility, but most importantly, to ensure freshness. That was my main concern for this place, as the food is constantly passing through tables.

To sum it all up, I had a really great dining experience and had fun handpicking and choosing everything. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake is good, as well as the matcha cake.

I have mixed feelings about this place though but didn't want to give a low star rating because I understand they are new. I am just here to put in my two cents:

I think with AYCE places everywhere in Vegas, this place has a lot to compete with. The quality of sushi at AYCE places I frequent was actually better than the quality here. I am not saying the quality of the fish was terrible, just not as good. For $2.50 a plate, it sure adds up fast, and I was still hungry by the time I had spent what I could have spent at an AYCE place. On a side note, for $2.50 a piece, the toro was amazing!! 

I was very impressed with how fast the iPad orders came out. I was not impressed that there was a bug crawling on my plate of toro when it came out though. 

I would probably come back if I am just craving a few pieces of nigiri or toro...or if they  up the quality of the fish. If they added fresh scallop or conch to the menu, that would be even better. But perhaps this place is not for me.",7Nm51v1DgqNfrx4Njieqaw,0,0,4,kA87MQ-1bWpNbwmvo_iC5Q

The quality of the sushi taste amazing! They have a good amount of variety on the belt. You'll find some specialty rolls to nigiri and some desserts! If you want to order a entire roll let's say for a dragon roll, you can place the order on the iPad that is on the table. While on it you can order which ever sushi you crave for or something different. I also ordered their tonkotsu ramen. Their ramen is served in a small bowl and it's simple. You got your broth, ramen, a slice of Chasu, and some bamboo shoot.

All plates were $2.50 on the rotating belt.  Most of the rolls on here were 3 pieces and nigiri was 2 pieces or for some things 1 piece.  You could order other items such an udon and edemame from their touch screen menu.  

You could also order full rolls or things like uni from the touch screen.  When you ordered these specialty items they came out on a little bus thing that was on top of the normal conveyor belt.  If it was for you the little truck would blink on your side.  If it was for the people across from you it would blink on their side.  As far as quality it was good.  Not the best I've had but not the worst.  The servers say there is a sensor on the belt to tell how long something has been there and they don't leave anything there for more than 30 minutes.

It was definitely busy but not crazy.  The servers were very attentive to refilling our waters and removing the lids from the plates we took off the conveyor belt.

The way they charge is they keep the plates you ate on the table.  You can see your bill for all items you ordered via the touch screen and drinks on the screen.  

The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is they had some technological issues.  The major one which was quite an inconvenience to our dining experience was the touch screen went black.  The manager had to ask me to get out of my seat so he could go in with a tool and open it.  They apologized however it was quite an inconvenience.  Also the bus up top blinked at the wrong side of the table which can cause some issues with the tables getting the wrong tables sushi which has already been paid for.

It kinda has this Futurama feel because they send your food out on little roombas from the kitchen when you order from the iPad at the table.

The revolving sushi has so much to choose from and the little plates are only $2.50 a piece so it really allows you to just try a little bit of everything. When it came to the sushi rolls the selection was a little weird such as their surf and turf but nonetheless good. The only complaint that I would have is that they leave the white plates on your table because they tally them up to finalize your bill. For example, $2.50 x 10 = $25. So it's kinda annoying that they take up space on the able. My only advice for you is that $2.50 starts to add up super quick once you get going!",lf_hJmK9H7t4L2JXNdkF2A,1,0,5,oHsqqGljZMt_GE3fQUuumQ

Gyoza were solid but a little cold; that's a hazard with the conveyor belt system.  Every dish was eaten in full and nothing went to waste.  The only thing they're missing is a late night happy hour.

3352538,2017-12-27,2,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Been wanting to try the first conveyor belt sushi place in Vegas and finally stopped by this place last Friday. My friend and I got there around 6:30 and were promptly seated. The place was nicely decorated and being new, looked really clean. I noticed that almost all the tables were taken and by the time we left, there was a line, so this place is quite popular. It seems like parking is quite limited as a lot of spots have signs reserved for certain stores/businesses. Just to be safe, I ended up parking all the way in the end by Joyful House.

The food was really disappointing though. We tried their salmon carpaccio, which came in 4 pieces. The salmon was good, but the sauce was too overpowering. For nigiri, we tried salmon belly, uni, and chu-toro (we only tried three because after we tried the first one, we knew we didn't want to order more). The fish on the nigiri all tasted ok, except for the salmon belly which tasted a bit fishy to me. The worst thing about the nigiri was the sushi rice. The rice was soft, but packed super tight when they shaped it. It tasted like a mushy rice ball. All the fish are also cut way too thin. With the packed mushy rice and too thin of fish, the nigiri are just bad. 

We also tried their ramen. I had the black garlic ramen and my friend had the tonkatsu ramen. We agreed that both ramen were the best dishes we had there and we only ordered them so we wouldn't still be too hungry after dinner LOL. 

If you don't see the sushi items you want at the conveyor belt, you can use the ipad on the table to order from the menu. Once the items you order are ready, the kitchen will send them through the conveyor belt (for sushi) or the waitress will bring them out for you (for ramen, appetizers, etc.). 

Price for each plate is $2.50. You get 2 pieces for salmon belly and 1 piece for uni and for chu-toro. The ramen was $4.95 for a small bowl and the carpaccio was $7.95. We also ordered hot tea, which was $2. Our total bill came to almost $40 for only that much food. For another 10 bucks, we could've eaten at an AYCE, had better sushi with varieties of appetizers and desserts, and actually be full after dinner.

For only being open for a few weeks, the service was great though. Our waitress was very polite and kept checking on our table. She also made sure our hot tea is never empty for too long.

I don't recommend this place, unless you really just want to check out what the conveyor belt is about. If you're looking for delicious sushi, look elsewhere.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,4,0,1,4wBAyh0rgU-4Cjiy7aPs6Q

We were seated at the happy hour time, so obviously we assumed that we could start eating. Through our 5th plate, we were told that those 5 plates will still be charged as $2.50. Noone told us that we had to WAIT to get a ""happy hour plate?"" They kept telling us how they just started doing happy hour so its a new thing, then they should of at least explained it to us better and even been more lenient if they wanted to keep customers coming back.

You can also order sushi or appetizers or drinks or desserts through an iPad. They have one at each table. What's cool is that someone either brings out to your table or a machine slides down to your table.

The sushi was okay. Honestly, for $2.50 a plate, I didn't think it was worth the price. One can't help but wonder why it's that expensive for how it tastes. I'm sure the quality is great with fresh ingredients and good quality fish but it just didn't taste all too great for me. It was just okay. I would much rather go to an all you can eat sushi place and get the same amount of food for better taste.

The service was great. They were attentive and nice. They were friendly. They were also very quick but they weren't hawkish.

3416163,2018-01-04,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I was pretty excited to hear of a revolving sushi here in Vegas.  My first experience was in Hawaii and I did enjoy it.  I had high expectations for this place, expecting a variety in appetizers and rolls.  I was expecting a few rolls similar to places where I get AYCE sushi.  

It'll probably wow first timers.  I think this place is for only people who do not eat a lot of sushi or that does not do AYCE.  
The waitress kindly explained how this all worked.  She even explained to us how after a plate has been on the conveyor belt for 30 minutes, it gets discarded and replaced which I think is good.  
We had technical difficulties on the tablet a few minutes after using it.  I wished the tablet was swivel capable.  That way it can be turned to either side of the table.  They should include paper menu as well so that they are able to see what ingredients are in their sushi rolls instead of trying to read from afar and having the person closer to the tablet read it for you (I find it bothersome, especially when you're trying to eat).  With menus conveniently in front of you, you can figure out your order and have the person closest input the order instead of having that person scroll through each submenu to see what exist.

Coming from the islands, we know what fresh, good quality fish looks like and this place did not meet those standards.

Things that we tried:
Hamachi & Salmon Tacos - I thought they were so cute.
Popcorn Lobster Roll - I enjoyed it.  I like it because of the sauce they use on it.  I like spicy mayo.
Gyoza - They were okay.  No different than any other place.
Cheese Tonkatsu - To me, it was okay.  Its got chicken (at least I think it was chicken, could have been pork) mixed with cheese and then deep fried.  
Lobster Roll - This was okay.  Probably taste the same as any other place.  I just wonder if they use real lobster.  Kind of looked like imitation crab on top.
Surf and Turf - For me, it was okay.  Spicy for my liking.  
Sexy Girl - I liked it, but I wish there wasn't any jalapenos in it.  

****That is one thing that you can't do on the tablet which is substitute/remove an ingredient from your roll**** (unless there is and the waiter just didn't tell us)

And that was about it.  This was sharing amongst 3 people.  We didn't have much.  Our bill was a little over $50.

3431224,2018-06-27,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I was in Vegas for EDC weeknd and I came here with a group of friends. I live in Orange Country and we have a revolving sushi bar called Kula but this place beats Kula by a whole lot.

Reason why this is the best revolving sushi bar that I've been to yet. The price you can't beat. $2.50 a plate! That's extremely fair for the quality of fish offered here (which I'll talk to about it in a bit). But even better, during Happy Hour it's $1.50 a plate. So worth it.

So comparing this to other revolving sushi joints I've been to. They carry fish that is not your average type of fish. Most places like this will have salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, eel, etc. Your average type of fish.

Here at Sapporo, they have kanpachi (baby yellowtail), sea bream, halibut, snapper with yuzu (fav), sweet shrimp, uni, 4 types of salmon - ccean trout, king salmon from New Zealand, salmon belly, smoked salmon. I'm surprised they didn't have cherry salmon from the variety of salmon they offered. There's so much more that they offer but I can't remember all of the fish that I had off the top of my head. The uni was better than some places I've had before and $2.50 for one piece! GAME. I told my friends about this place when I came back to Orange County and now I can't wait to go back to show them this hidden gem.",-keGVPsNuiBafntOOf7kSQ,2,2,5,5J55TI9-G_Jhs3XySAAHBw
3432261,2017-12-14,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Finally! Revolving sushi in Las Vegas. I'm super happy it is finally here.

I know it seemed like a fading fad from the 90s but I assure you, where I am originally from, it never went out of style. Where I moved from, revolving sushi made a come back around 2013. But for some reason, it never made it to Vegas until now. And I understand why, when there's AYCE sushi almost everyone where in Vegas.

The layout for Sapporo is different from what I am accustomed to.  As my husband and I figured out a few minutes after being seated, there are three sections in the restaurant. Therefore, there are 3 conveyor belts.  They serve the same things, just on three different belts. So if your belt is running low on dishes, well, the other one is full. However, you can't just get up and reach over someone's table to get that one dish because that's just plain rude.  In the normal revolving sushi restaurant, the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant and the belt goes all the way around the restaurant. In this way, the belt is always full.

Sapporo does have a nice system on each table where you can submit regular orders of sushi, order dessert, miso soup, three different ramen options, udon, and other items that are on the belt. In fact, the family that sat across from us had two little boys. The boys favorite dishes were the taco shrimp and taco yellow tail. The taco shell is made of deep fried won ton wraps. Because people were snatching up the tacos faster than it could get to us, the family submitted three separate orders of the tacos using the tablet. The tacos were electronically zipped over to the family right above the belt. It was so cool!

The items from the belt had your usual items like tuna, yellow tail, crunch, shrimp, tamago (egg), crab leg, philly rolls.  They also had something called sexy girl.  Depending on the roll, there is either 1 to 4 rolls to a plate. For example, the tamago had 2 items, the crab leg had only 1, the mexican roll had 3 items, while the philly and lobster crunch had four rolls. Each plate is reasonably priced $2.50/each. And I have to say, it was pretty good. My favorites, the tamago, lobster crunch and yellow tail taco. Damn! I just realized, they didn't have any gyoza! I always get gyoza! :(

My husband ordered the miso soup and the broth was really good.  My husband also ordered a bowl of tonkatsu ramen, which is a small bowl at $4.25. I thought the broth for the ramen was ok, but I would order it again. I do think the size and the price is really good.

The one thing it didn't have, desserts on the belt. :( You have to order from the tablet menu. And the desserts are slim pickings. There's no mochi ice cream, but there is tiramisu (which is Italian) and ice cream (pineapple sorbet, vanilla, pistachio and green tea). Tiramisu is $6.95 (yipes) and ice cream is $2.95/each.

And although garlic spicy edamame was on the belt, that was $3.50. The typical revolving sushi has different plate colors that determine the price of the dish. Sapporo has one dish color with a set price of $2.50/each. However, the edamame is in a bowl. I'm assuming that anything in a bowl on the belt is $3.50?? In any case, during this visit, the only thing on the belt in a bowl was the garlic edamame.

Get here early or get here really late as they close at 2 am. My husband and I got here around 5:30 when they opened up the last section. However, when we left at 6:45, there was a lot of people waiting.

The service was good. The restaurant is nice and clean with contemporary decor. 

I definitely like the price. My average number of plates at revolving sushi is 5. For me, the price is right. However, if you have a husband like mines where he wants to try everything, then a dinner/lunch date is actually comparable to AYCE sushi.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,1,3,ikNQCU0hJ0262_l26XQH3w

Prices are reasonable, but if you order a lot, it is easy to quickly rack up a bill. The sushi itself was of decent quality, and some of the small dishes offered are fairly unique and fusion-y.

If you're looking for super fancy rolls, this is probably not your place - instead, Sapporo focuses on the simple: delicious pieces of nigiri and simple rolls with only a handful of specialty rolls. For its simplicity, the food is done well and is reasonably priced at $2.50 per plate off the conveyer belt. Most plates come with 2 pieces of nigiri or as 3 pieces of a roll, making it perfect for trying a lot of different dishes to find your favorites. If you don't see a dish that you want, you can also order off of their iPad menu which offers larger specialty rolls, sashimi, tempura, ramen, and desserts (ranging from $4.95-10). A small car-like robot will deliver it direct to your table!

Our favorites from the night were: 
1) Salmon belly - so fatty and melts in your mouth
2) Salmon and shrimp tacos - mini fried wonton tacos with a mixture of salmon or shrimp in a creamy sauce; easy to eat in one bite
3) Garlic tuna - tuna nigiri with fried garlic on top with a peppery sesame sauce
4) Bluefin tuna - definitely worth $2.50 for 1 piece (one of the few plates that only comes as 1 piece of nigiri)
5) Popcorn lobster roll - basic crab roll topped with tempura fried lobster with a yummy mix of creamy and eel sauce

First time I came, my experience was really bad, so I decided to give it another chance, and it's still the same. Our server came by our table two times, that's it. It was to take our drink order and bring our drinks. He didn't come to give us our refills or check up on us, NOTHING. When we were finish eating, he didn't even come by for 20 minutes to give us our check so we just went up to the front. 
Moving onto the food, it was okay. The fish just didn't taste as fresh to me, the rice was a little too hard and warm for the fish. I also saw a couple of the nigiri lids were kinda foggy. Me and my boyfriend ordered 3 hand-rolls, the T.N.T., and a couple nigiris. 
Our iPad kept breaking down too and we had to have someone come over three times.

I tend do drink a lot of water during meals, but my glass was never empty and when the our iPad stopped working, the host was over right away to fix it. 

Not only that, but for a sushi bar like this, the quality of the fish not terrible. In fact, the salmon quality is very comparable to some sushi bars. The tuna, however was quite fishy. Some recommendations are the smoke salmon, salmon belly, the squid, the spider hand roll, and if you want to be adventurous, their mini tacos aren't bad either.",YMF7w4fuW9bocGukfuJ8RA,1,0,4,R8cXhsEn_ShYJGNU2ZQFVw

It's cheap in my opinion because everything in the conveyor belt is $2.50! They have 2 piece nigiris and 3 piece rolls along with small appetizers going around in the belt and they're actually REALLY GOOD! They even have small tonkotsu ramen bowls with all the veggies and even chashu! It was only $4.50, same with the udon noodle soup bowls! You can order full rolls but I suggest you just grab three different kinds of the 3 piece rolls for $7.50 ($2.50 x 3) because that's cheaper than paying 10 dollars for an 8 piece roll of the same thing when you can have 9 pieces of assortment! Your table will also have an iPad so you can order food/drinks/dessert anytime! 

This place is so good! Besides the food, the place is really clean and the ambiance is so nice and relaxing! All the servers are nice and attentive! Definitely one of my favorite sushi places now.

In addition you can use the screens they have at each table to order a specific order and those prices varies. We ordered Shrimp tempura, and Soft pork Belly. When it's ready, an automated monorail robot deliver your food above the conveyor belt, that is so cute.

The restaurant was pretty much full when we walked in but we were still seated with no wait- which was awesome and really exemplifies a well run business. Also, the restaurant was very clean and had nice modern decor. 

As soon as we were seated a server came to our table and explained how everything worked; essentially the ""concept"" of the conveyor belt of sushi. Each dish is 2.99 and there is also a tablet at each table where you can order full size rolls or other menu items that are not on the conveyor. At the end, the server just counts the number of plates you picked up and totals it with any additional full size rolls and/ or menu items you may have ordered off the tablet. 

The sushi itself was pretty good but the number of plates available on the conveyor was lacking- it seemed like they weren't refilling it as quickly as tables were picking them up. We sat waiting multiple rounds as the conveyor went around with barely any plates on it. Also, there wasn't much of a variety of full size rolls you could order off of the tablet either. 

On another note, when you do order full size rolls they are rolled out on an electric cart above the conveyor directly to your table which was pretty awesome!",xFIJOdPk3SQWUm4wadPnUg,2,0,4,m0PYQhSp9xUOuOGeXjc1Xw

I went with a big group and we are definitely the type to ask for one thing after another, the waitress we had was so incredibly nice and was never once annoyed by any of our requests. 
The food was on point. I love the train/robot thingy system (lol) that brings out some of your dishes. It gives the restaurant this futuristic vibe. It's also a very well-decorated/cute restaurant too if you couldn't tell from the pictures.
Prices here are incredibly reasonable. Being from Seattle, I think we're a little used to paying more for food. I hope that if they do bring it here they can somewhat honor the prices ;) !

Also, being used to AYCE, I was feeling a little uneasy about the fact we had to pay for each plate we picked up.
We actually ended up placing more orders than picking up sushi from the conveyor belt, since many rolls they had on were half rolls.
We also placed orders on bluefin tuna and toro. To our surprise, they turned out to be one of the best ones we've had compared to most sushi restaurants here in Las Vegas. Most of their fish were fresh compared to AYCE as well. Service was also amazing, servers immediately cleared empty plates as we finished eating them.
Wait time was not bad at all, we went there on Sunday, and we were seated right away. But I would recommend calling ahead to check on their wait time, because my friends have told me that they had to wait close to 30 minutes when they visited this place.

There is still a waiter assigned to you to help you with things such as drinks, to-go orders, and any confusion you may have with the process. 

As a vegan, there were very limited options. They do offer a cucumber roll and an avocado roll, but that's the extent of the veggie sushi. I'd like to see them add some more vegetable rolls in the future. They do offer miso soup and white rice as well for very low prices. You can ask your server for sauces, such as garlic ponzu, to put on your side of rice. They also offered a variety of ramen and udon noodles, but I did not have the chance to ask if they were (or could be prepared) vegan. 

The person I went with was not a vegan, and was very impressed by he quality of the food. You can see the chefs in the kitchen preparing fresh sushi as you sit which he really enjoyed.

Sapporo's take on revolving sushi has thoroughly convinced me that you don't have to sacrifice on having both quality and convenience. I also give them mad props for being the first revolving sushi restaurant to break into Las Vegas' very competitive restaurant scene! If you're gonna do it, do it right and Sapporo most certainly does it right!

The wait was minimal for a party of three on a Friday night. Bonus, the bar features super affordable glasses of wine to help you pass the time. Do keep in mind that they will not seat you unless you have your entire party present.

From the toro to the popcorn lobster roll, offerings were fresh and plentiful. I never ran into any issues with an item I wanted being unavailable.

It was closed at 3:xx when we passed but opened back up for dinner at 5:00 . We arrived at 5:15 on a Sunday and there were already more than a few tables full . The parking was tough to decipher with various signs looking reserved for certain stores. When we approached the door there was a sign that said ""park anywhere . "" We now know and will just find a spot . 

The food !!

The sushi was very good . Compared to the ayce' in the area the quality is above that of those places . The rice was seasoned well and the fish portions were Above average . We ordered the branzino which was very fluffy and seasoned great . The toro is very buttery . The sushi rolls that come on the conveyor were mostly 3-4 pieces and are perfect for trying a few of the rolls especially for 2.50 a plate . I would skip the tuna tartare next time , although the sauce complimented the fish well it was missing a certain crunch . The oysters were tasty a well.  The nigiri Conveyor selections came by pretty often and there was a medium selection of fish to choose from . I will definitely try the ribeye  next time it looked great . 

Overall a great new restaurant . Very clean and simple on the inside . It's going to be a very busy spot I'd imagine because of the conveyors newness in town .

Sapporo is a unique dining experience which included a revolving sushi conveyor belt, robotic ""servers"" which is a mini robot car (looks like roomba) that delivers your special orders to your table, and an iPad ordering system. Very space age. 

Shout out to Chris our great bartender! The Sapporo Sour was the best drink ever! Order 3! You can sit st the bar while you wait since they don't take reservations. The wait shouldn't be longer than 20 minutes. 

The revolving selection changed throughout the dining experience but I would estimate about 15 options every 5 minutes, with the most popular rotating often. Each plate is labeled so you know what your picking up. 

All the plates are covered for health safety reasons, as the germaphobe in me was worried if everyone in the restaurant would get the flu from the line. Definitely not something to worry about. Clean and safe! 

All revolving plates are $2.50. You get to stack them up while you eat and they count them at the end to tally your bill. 

They do have many a la carte options all under $12. If you don't see the option your looking for on the conveyor, you can have it sent to your table via the robot server in under a minute, for the same $2.50 price. 

It was such a dining experience! Stacking the plates was actually fun because you get to assess and compare ""the damage"" with your friends or against the tables sitting around you.",moPeVo2BVmpUC9HqTiR5_A,0,0,5,QiX7eIT2WggnvWifKLYnrg

If this review was on presentation alone I would give it a 5, heck I might even push for a 6.  Unfortunately, I came here to eat sushi.  The way it works is that there is a constantly moving conveyor belt that has plates with a couple of pieces of sushi each.  Just take the plate you crave.  After dinner they count up each of these plates at $2.50 a piece.  For whole rolls, appetizers, and bigger dishes there is a computer screen.  These orders are prepared in the kitchen.  When they are ready a little robot that looks like it may be from Star Wars wheels down a track and stops at your table.  After repeatedly announcing your food is ready, it races back to the kitchen after you take your plate.

Unfortunately, for me the food did not stand up to the presentation.  I am not saying it was bad, it just wasn't sushi to me.  Everything is on the sweet side.  When I want sweets I go for ice cream.  That being said, I really loved the Strawberry roll.  It was really unique.  It tasted more like strawberry pie than sushi, but hey I love strawberry pie.  Go ahead and call me a hypocrite.  I do think this is the perfect place for a first time sushi patron or someone who is on the fence about trying sushi.  It felt like sushi with training wheels.

Actually got a chance to try this super popular and trendy Japanese restaurant that is hard to missed with the crowds of foodies, baby boomers, conventioneers, tourists and everyone else drawn to see multiple conveyor belts filled with sushi. Including Nigiri, Gyoza, Seaweed Salad, 4 piece sushi rolls including some desserts like Match and Chocolates cake pieces. You can see and hear the aha, wow and umm from everyone! 

This place gets really busy and plan ahead, especially the durning evening hours and weekend. However, we were seated within the 15min that was allotted to our party of 3. Upon being seated, our friendly server was helpful and attentive to the point our table was clean and water cups was consistently filled. Kathryn, our server explained the concept and made sure we were ok. We ordered a good amount of items through the touch screen tablet attached to the table. We personally like the concept especially if your feeling hungry. 

A few delicious items that was impressive was the Salmon, Blue Fin Tuna, Super White Tuna and Toro. Every plate is micro-chipped that allows the kitchen to keep track how long each dish has been on the conveyor belt that assures you that everything is fresh. We also got a Sapporo Special roll, this was made just right with a consistent texture and balanced ingredients. We did notice that the Sushi Rolls we got wasn't over stuff with too much rice like other Sushi places. Ramen and Udon soup bowls were good in size and make a great meal combined with Sushi. For desserts, I really enjoyed their Strawberry Cake. Moist and balanced flavor with a good amount of strawberry flavoring. Even, Ms. Strawberry Shortcake herself would be proud of this dessert, lol. 

I would come back and play pick and choose my favorite or if I need a quick bite to eat this would be on top of my list.

I will be frequenting. 

The concept is not so unusual outside of Vegas, but, if I'm not mistaken, this is the first the valley has had. The revolving sushi setup with a clean, considerate look about it. 

The fish quality is great. I pray this never changes. The menu items you can't find on the belt are excellent as well. Drinks are wonderful. Pomegranate margarita and sakatini were both awesome. Beer selection is decent also. 

The carrot puree which garnishes some of the dishes is delicious. At least drop by to try it. 

Prices are fair. It's  $2.50 per plate, which sounds harmless until you're 15 plates in. 

It's definitely somewhere to drop by for the experience as well as the food.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,4,2,5,_soq1S4VD0-aIwzUDainxg

3852574,2017-12-07,3,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Yep, that's right. Vegas finally has their own revolving sushi joint. In the sea of AYCE sushi spots, Sapporo is joining the many options for sushi in Sin City!

After hearing about this place recently opening (Dec 2017), me and a few friends stopped by for dinner and enjoyed ourselves. Don't get me wrong, it's a great place. The fish quality is good and the service was very attentive and nice. But I think I still prefer AYCE... 

At $2.50 a plate, they can really stack up and we ended up paying about the same, if not more, per person as you could get at AYCE. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by the price at revolving sushi joints in Hawaii. But $2.50 for some of the items they offer is a little overpriced. 

You can either order from the iPad or grab directly from the belt. I tend to like ordering from the iPad (so you know it's made somewhat more fresh)

In the end, we enjoyed ourselves and left thoroughly stuffed. The restaurant is very clean and nicely designed. It was a little empty when we were there but here's hoping more people catch on.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,5,3,3,v0ZN-pxub7dQfCQbCVA72w

So if you look at other peoples pictures and the name of the place, the sushi is served on a conveyer belt for the most part. 

So first off it's a fairly nice place when you go into the restaurant. There's a little waiting area but not too many seats are available to those who are waiting. I was standing with my friend for 15 - 20 minutes. When we were seated we ordered drinks and started picking things off. I got edamame and it was a good amount off of the conveyer belt. I also took spicy tuna, crunchy lobster, and gyoza. Now I wasn't the biggest fan of the gyoza but everything else was fine. 

I loved the experience, the atmosphere, and the food. It was a very sporadic experience in all honesty. You only have a few moments to decide whether you want something and if you don't decide then it's gone till the next round. I think this place would be fun for truth or dare.

One of the best kept secrets of the entire menu is actually the black garlic ramen for $4.25. The portion is smaller than what you would typically get, but the flavor is way better than any of the other ramen shops around town. 

Each sushi plate that passes by will run  you $2.50 each with most common pieces featuring two pieces of nigiri. Some of the premium fish such as bluefin tuna will only have one piece. Unfortunately, they did not having toro during our visit. I really enjoyed the salmon belly and the yellowtail mini taco. 

All in all, the bill still ran around $20 per person. If you really want your fill, AYCE sushi still might be the way to go for a little more, but I would definitely come back for a couple of bowls of ramen with a few pieces of sushi!",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,7,3,4,k4clWI743HbIh34_wPYGmA

Every dish that was pulled off the belt tasted good and was surprisingly fresh. Now don't expect super high quality fish. C'mon it's only $2.50 per dish so you get what you pay for.
But, if you want a dish freshly made or don't see it on the belt you have the option to order it on the ipad. It will then be shortly delivered to your table by a robot. You'll know it's yours because it will stop in front of you and will blink yellow.
There are many other dishes on the ipad so be sure to peruse all items. A few dishes that tickled my palate were the yellowtail & tuna tacos, peppered tuna sushi, & the steak.
As for the space, it's chic, modern, and spacious serviced by friendly waiters. Btw, there's a call button on the ipad if you need to holler at one.",tp77HGAm4JVX3BL50v7Ajg,1,1,4,H1EkcbvVx3FmwfQDhOabsA

-The COST. It's $2.50 per plate while in CA revolving sushi it's $1 per plate. These plates DO add up, I only got 8 plates because that sums up to $20.

What my family and I love about this place is the fact that you can come here with any sized appetite. If you wanna stuff your face, it's perfect! If you aren't that hungry and just wanna snack on a couple of things, also perfect!

We got here at a great time before the dinner rush, and they were just opening one of the sides of tables so we knew everything coming out was going to be fresh.  Little by little, the tiny round plates of sushi started coming out and soon, there was an endless stream of nigiri and maki to our delight.

You can't beat the $2.50 a plate deal.  But wait, there's more.  We ordered a few items from the touch pad and like kids waiting for Christmas, we anxiously waited for the upper tray to shoot out from the kitchen and arrive with our dish.  Again, I am easily amused by technology.  Definitely a good selection and options on the menu for those that aren't into sushi, though why go there if you're not?

Conveyor Belt Sushi: I loved the signage that leads with the sushi following.  The plates have two pieces to make it easy to try new sushi at $2.50 a plate, fantastic.

Upper Level VIP delivery Sushi & More: If you order sushi and other items from the kitchen, it will get delivered to you via a motorized tray that rides on the track above the conveyor belt.  It stops at your table, flashes a yellow light and a robotic voice instructs you to remove your order. Very cool, your social media fans will love it.

The conveyor belt sushi was fresh for sampling.  The sushi rolls we ordered from the kitchen was even fresher.  The half size ramen bowl, scallops, sushi tacos, scallops and steak were flavorsome.  The portions are smaller sampling sizes but good quality dishes for a great price.  Fantastic.

Ambiance: Contemporary lighting and decor, dark wood tables, black leather booths, pairs well with the conveyor belt for a clean high tech look.  Family night or date night, the vibe works just as well.

Sapporo just cracked my list of best places for a first date.  If the vibe is good, order slowly and try new dishes with your date.  Create that new memory together.  If the vibe is one star, order less dishes, save money and get that dessert dish delivered when the time is right.

The sushi is better than average for a conveyor belt sushi place.  It isn't a significant drop in quality like a lot of others with the same model.

4107057,2017-12-09,6,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"This is actually fast food sushi. Well, as long as you can avoid the waits just to get seated during peak hours.

I heard about Sapporo Revolving Sushi through the grapevine and almost had a chance to try a soft opening, but that fell through. Fortunately, after mentioning this restaurant to a friend, he suggested that we try it out this weekend. We showed up at about 5:45 on Friday night and only had to wait upwards of 10 minutes for a seat, which was fantastic in light of the crowd that had materialized by meal's end.

The server strangely asked whether we'd eaten at a revolving sushi restaurant before, and my friend said yes (although I hadn't), which ended up in us skipping the tutorial. That kinda added a wait for me as I naively blundered my way through the tablet-based ordering system (note: press the ""i"" with a circle around it for hi-res photos of a food item) until my friend's gf pointed out that I had to press ""Place Order"" to send my list to the kitchen, so let me help out other newbies and say this: don't forget to press ""Place Order"" when you're sure of what you want to order.

That said, the tablet orders took about 2-3 minutes to come out, which is insanely fast for any restaurant anywhere. Most of them arrived on the top ""rail"" of the conveyor belt system, via a machine that travels to the appropriate spot, lights up to signal the correct table, and plays prerecorded messages prompting you to grab your order then press the button to return the bot to the kitchen. Occasionally, a server would bring out your order. Not much interaction with employees aside from that, ordering drinks, removing lids, and finalizing checks.

Oh, that's right, lids. So the potentially faster way to get food is by grabbing it off the lower level of the conveyor belt, which constantly runs clockwise with signs naming foods followed by a small number of plates containing said foods. Small appetizers, nigiri, and half-rolls all makes appearances, and each plate is $2.50 (tallied up by hand-counting plates at meal's end). No different colored plates or anything in this restaurant's belt system.

Now, when I said potentially faster, I mean that some items weren't always available, such as various ""taco"" appetizers, premium nigiri (1 piece per order, not 2 pieces), and hand rolls (don't know that they even a belt item despite pricing). Fortunately, you can order everything for delivery via tablet, so use/abuse that as needed.

I think I've waxed poetic on the concept enough. I can and should probably say a lot about the food too, and I usually talk about each individual type of fish, but I can summarize it this time by noting that every single piece of seafood which I tasted was fresh. I'm talking about upwards of over 20 bites, with over 10 different varieties. Nothing was absolutely the best quality you can find in town, but almost everything at least matches if not exceeds expectations for ""entry-level"" sushi.

Highlights for me included the toro ($2.50/1 pc), orange salmon ($7.95 for a more affordable yet surprisingly comparable version of ""sake orenji""), mackerel ($2.50/2 pc), and Branzino with Carrot Puree ($4.95, not too huge but moist and tender w/ crispy skin; caution that puree may be too sweet for some).

Assuming that they can maintain that consistent quality, Sapporo Revolving Sushi offers a very solid balance between value and price. I just found myself wanting more in the value department after seeing my final check. I wasn't starving, but I was quite hungry, so the sizing of the nigiri reminded me of all-you-can-eat sushi experiences all over town, which would have cost less for a potentially gluttonous feast with relatively marginal decreases in quality. I'll probably save future trips here for when I'm craving particular foods and/or only moderately hungry.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,16,10,4,6XBsq9PudazP8cpKHjLppg

4122630,2017-12-15,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Conveyor belt sushi finally hit Las Vegas! I've been itching to experience revolving sushi and I'm so thankful it finally arrived in the Valley!

The concept is pretty simple. There is a conveyor belt full of different kinds of sushi (with labels right before the plates) where you can pick up the food you desire. From what I've seen, most of the plates come with 1-4 pieces. Do also note that desserts are not available to pick up on the conveyor belts. I learned that the conveyor belt actually has sensors on it that will alert the staff if the sushi has been there for more than 30 minutes so it can be replaced with fresh sushi, which settles my original apprehension of the safety of the food revolving around the restaurant for hours. At the end of your meal, the servers count how many plates you have on your table and add it to your bill since it is not automatically counted. Since I had come a little later in the evening (around midnight on a Thursday), there wasn't much going around the conveyor belt. Because of this, we had to get our food through the ordering system on the tablet.

Each table gets a tablet with the menu to choose from. These items include nigiri sushi, specialty rolls, tempura, ramen, appetizers, and dessert. The menu is not extensive, but it surely is enough. Prices are pretty reasonable. It is $2.50 for two pieces of nigiri (1 piece for some choices such as toro, ama-ebi, and bluefin tuna), a little under $10 for speciality rolls, etc.

After selecting the items you want to order, you place your order and wait for the chefs to make your dishes. It took about 10 minutes for the chefs to complete each of my orders. You receive your order from the kitchen via an electronic track on top of the conveyor belt. A machine travels to your table, lights up and plays a prerecorded message signaling you to pick up your food, and returns back to the kitchen.

Sushi quality was pretty good and tasted fresh. It is comparable to most of AYCE sushi spots across town. I was also able to try the salmon tacos and enjoyed them. The crunchy wonton shells were a great contrast compared to the fish.

Service was very limited. I did not interact with any staff aside from getting seated, introducing us to the ordering system, the occasional drink refill/plate clean-up, and receiving the bill when prompted on the ordering system. However, the interactions I had were all positive.

Overall, the price is competitive to the AYCE sushi prices around town for a higher quality without the inherent pressure to stuff my face with food to get my money's worth. I would warn you to be cautious if you are a big eater, though. Prices can add up fast if you don't pay attention! For anyone who hasn't experienced conveyor belt sushi, I would recommend trying this place out!

Freddy, the manager of this very first revolving sushi restaurant in Vegas, gave us a warm welcome upon our arrival. Walking inside the entrance, we were seated at a booth right next to the open kitchen areas where the executive chef and sushi chefs did their magic. 

The conveyer belts of sushi are split in the middle of each booth. It's really appetizing to see each belt filled up with actual sushi and no empty plates or huge gaps in between. On a cleanliness level, so far so good! Plus the concept of a sushi-go-round restaurant is always entertaining while grubbing on your favorite roll of sushi or nigiri. You are also able to place special orders (nigiri, special rolls, appetizers, side dishes, gourmet orders, desserts) via tablet, in which each dish speeds towards your table atop the conveyor belt like a Roomba but instead of cleaning, it serves you food!  

Several servers would always stop by to take our trays and larger gourmet plates so that it wouldn't stack the table space. Our main server, Jeremy, was very attentive and provided us with outstanding hospitality. He definitely made sure that nothing was amiss and our glasses would always be filled. Since it was their first day and management is still working out the kinks, even when the conveyor belt system had an internet slowdown, Jeremy was able to make sure we had our orders readily by jotting them down specifically on a notepad until the system came back online. 

To start with, the cocktails we ordered are: sapporo sour (matcha on light alcohol without so much of the bitterness), tokyo summer (definitely my fave as there is yuzu flavor and hints of citrusy elderflower in it), peach saketini (this is pretty strong in the alcohol department, i would go for this only if i'm ready to paint the town red), and lychee margarita (also somewhat strong, but it creeps up on you later on).

They have $2.50 TORO!! Super, duper fresh. Didn't even need much soy sauce to soak most of the nigiris and rolls in and they were plenty tasteful. I also do believe that they have salmon belly nigiri. It was juicy and satisfying with every bite, and strangely filling. I didn't have to over order this one at all.The sushi appetizer, orange salmon, is extremely similar to a local restaurant's sake orenji (but without the yuzu tobiko and thinly mini jalapeno slices) which is a huge plus in my book. It's also affordable so at any possibility, I would come by every week just for this dish as it's my favorite out of the rest! Fresh and juicy but not an overdose of yuzu! It was just right, especially with the portions to share among 4 people. 

Gourmet dishes that we ordered but not limited to: ribeye (medium rare; juicy and of decent portion), pork belly (warm in cute cube form, also juicy), black cod (light and buttery soft), and shrimp (loved that they deshelled the center to make it easier for customers to eat - it means that the chefs put careful consideration on how they prepare their meals for us). I feel that each surprisingly nicely presented dish had an array of flavor however I would like to see a slight improvement on the black cod because it's so mushy. 

Because their solid desserts weren't available at the time, we opted to try each of their ice cream flavors: vanilla, pineapple, pistachio, and green tea. The vanilla was surprisingly not lusterless or plain at all, very creamy in texture, and when you mix it with the pineapple its like eating dole whip! The pineapple honestly reminded me of a yuzu sorbet-- citrusy and I would love to order this in between sushi dishes to clean my palate. Pistachio was definitely nutty but did not overpower my tastebuds at all. Green tea didn't have a bitter aftertaste at all so it was easy to eat with every scoop. 

Ultimately, I would definitely come back here again for their salmon belly nigiri, orange salmon, and the rest of their dessert selections when it becomes available!",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,14,10,5,Yvfdtv7t33JPKEDjtOxreA

You walk in and are immediately greeted by several workers (I went in during lunch, right after they opened, around 12) but might change if they're busy or not. We sat down and was immediately awed with the great atmosphere and conveyor belt full with nigiri and other options. I'm personally not a fan of sushi based on my first time but I decided to jump the gun and try it once more. We started with the yellowtail tuna which was a tad fishy but what do I know? Then tuna, which I did not like at all. I decided that I couldn't eat anymore of the nigiri and opted for the more traditional rolled sushi. Sapporo has very interesting options, including: Popcorn Lobster Roll (deep fried lobster with eel sauce and chipotle mayo) and Tuna Tacos. I also tried the Black Garlic Ramen ($4.25), which was extremely flavorful and tasted beyond fresh. 

All in all, a positive experience at Sapporo Revolving Sushi and my only complaint is that the ""request a server"" option on the iPad does not work and you're better off just waving them down.",m_8LPpNg_4YonaEDZoY5Hw,0,0,4,paXyL-gyV0Sn7ZgeeC0xxQ
4252048,2018-05-19,1,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I had been looking forward to coming to this restaurant for quite some time as I was intrigued by their concept and eager to try new sushi items I never had the courage to try before. After trying Sapporo Revolving Sushi, I feel conveyor belt sushi is a brilliant concept, one I believe all sushi restaurants should adopt as a way to encourage guests to try new things in order to see exactly what sushi dishes are their favorites and reduce waste. 

I mean, let's be honest here, we've all been to one of those ""all you can eat"" sushi restaurants where you end up ordering a sushi roll that wasn't what you were expecting and now you're forced to eat it or the establishment will charge you for wasting. Nothing sucks more than to be disappointed with your meal choice and to be forced to eat it anyway. Sapporo solves that problem completely.

Guests are either able to order from a wide touch screen menu at their table or simply just grab a plate from the conveyor belt as an ample variety of sushi items pass by them. Each plate from the conveyor belt will have two to three pieces of a particular sushi roll, such as the Mexican roll or the smoked salmon roll, which you can taste on the first round or, if you'd like, grab again the next time that item comes your way. 

I tried a wide array of items including the sexy girl roll, yellow tail tacos, lobster roll, and even a white cake dessert! I simply loved having a variety of food items arriving to my table because there's nothing better than be able to sample great food over and over again. 

Also, our server was fantastic. He made sure our drinks were refilled often and was able to provide great suggestions as to what menu items to order in between our indulging in the revolving sushi dishes. One of my friends who dined with us decided to try the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked and topped with a succulent sauce that left him yearning to order the dish a second time. 

Definitely impressed with the great food and service Sapporo offers to their guests. I have no doubt that my next sushi craving will be satisfied at this fine establishment and I will continue to recommend it to all the sushi lovers I know!",KJRQUJEkWVebUImqc4vW_Q,7,4,5,XXE-gI4DR9aDAJdD85OMzQ

My first conveyor belt sushi experience took place in Japan. The restaurant I went to was called '????(??????/Kaiten Sushi)'; '??(????/Kaiten)' means 'rotation' so 'Rotation Sushi'.

Sushi are placed on top of a conveyor belt and it moves through the restaurant while the customers can just easily take whatever they fancy. Unlike Japan, all the plates on the conveyor belt are $2.50. You can use the screens they have at each table to order a specific order and those prices varies.

The Sushi was fresh and had a good amount portion of fish. Salmon is my go to fish and it was delicious! I enjoyed the sushi. They have some special rolls in either two to four pieces, then if you want an actual full roll you can special order it on the touch pad. 

My friend and I each got full from 7 conveyor belt plates and the price was $18.94 which is a pretty good price for us since it's similar amount to an ayce sushi restaurant.

One thing, I checked their yelp for their address, but it lead me to a different location then the actually restaurant. Luckily, it was close by to where the yelp address lead me. Sapporo is on Spring Mountain, past Arville, but before you hit the Decatur's traffic light. It is located right next to Hotai Furniture, so I recommend looking up Hotai Furniture to make it more easier to locate Sapporo.",SiXUv1oE6uTAbbHXOaXy4Q,3,1,5,Mp0C25Hh0mC6zb5pYVt5PA

Living in the Northwest before moving to Vegas, I've had the convenience of eating sushi at conveyor belt sushi restaurants such as Blue C Sushi and Sushi Land. I was happy to find a sushi conveyor belt restaurant in Vegas at Sapporo Revolving Sushi. They have sushi, a few small warm dishes, Japanese desserts (cake or ice cream) and ramen or udon soup. It is a fun experience to bring friends or family to because at each booth (I believe each booth takes 6 people comfortably or 8 tight), you can grab small plates of sushi ($2.50/plate of 2 or 1). You can also order from the table's tablet (each dish $2.50-$10 and $15-30 for sashimi), which comes to your booth via machine unless it is soup). I only found it hard to tell if it was your table's order or the table on the other side of you.

I do wish they had more non-spicy sushi roll options since my boyfriend doesn't do spice. The spicy rolls that I ordered weren't too spicy to my taste. It seemed that about 75% of the sushi menu contained spice of some sort. I'm sure you can call the waiter to your table to make adjustments to an order, but it would be nice to have an option to do so on your table's tablet.

The ramen ($4.95/Bowl) that we ordered was delicious and enough for two people if also eating other dishes. The Bonzino fish was soft and flavorful inside and crisp on the outside.

I'd say compared to other sushi places, the Nigiri choices that come in 2 at Sapporo are a tiny bit smaller.

They have a bar while you wait to be seated or you can order from your table. It was a 1st experience for my boyfriend, but certainly not his last!",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,2,0,4,jUDk_YwzucZ_iOlAdkoJXw

You can also place orders, like ramens, handrolls, and specials from the kitchen (like sashimi) from the tablet that attached to each table. The main complaint I have was the Gyu Katsu.  It was a very small piece of pork cutlet, that was cut into 8 pieces.  Each piece was half of my thumb and very thin. For the price of $8.95, it is not worth it at all.  If it was really tasty, then I guess it would be OK, unfortunately the meat was so small, I could only taste the batter. Hence I knocked one star. There are several star items I like: mini tacos (all of them were good), black garlic ramen (we have ordered once of each and this one has the best taste), and all the nigiri sushi were very fresh.  For the 5 of us, we ate a total of 24 plates and ordered a small sashimi (9 pieces of fish for $14.95, slices were on the thin side compared to other Japanese sushi restaurant), 4 bowls of ramen, gyu katsu, and drinks.  The cost is averaged out to be about $25 per person.  And we were full but none of us was a big eater so if you are an AYCE person, you may want to go to an AYCE and paid a little more, because the cost would come out to be the same. But we will revisit this place if we come back to Vegas because we don't like AYCE.",eF4gCAhlDQ-b6aiKBeLDsA,0,0,4,7rpVBPkk1kzRX5m3xh-MLw

I have to admit I did wait about a month or so before coming here for all the hype to die down. My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday around 7 pm and waited maybe around 20 minutes for a table, which isn't bad in my opinion. We were also easily able to find a parking spot right in front. 

Once we were seated the host explained the concept to us. All of the conveyor items on the white plates are priced at $2.50 and there's also an iPad at the table to order specialty items which are different price ranges. The iPad orders arrive on a separate little cart which stops right at your table and lights up. We tried this with the Orange Salmon which was really cool.

During this visit we tried quite a few different things, but our overall favorites were the New Zealand salmon nigiri, the Garlic Tuna nigiri, and the Mexican roll. All of the fish was very fresh and the portion sizes were just right for trying multiple things. 

We will definitely be back again soon. Awesome concept & great food!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,8,4,5,f85e4yFmn-xvrFcTupGsmg

With so many AYCE sushi places in town it's hard to justify going to a place that charges by the plate.   Not anymore.   This place is so reasonable that even if you come hungry,  you will likely pay about the same as an AYCE place but have the option of just grabbing whatever strikes your interest as it passes by.   

Easy parking, amazing Happy Hour prices.  Servers are all amazing but Maria is the best. 

I love the popcorn lobster and the pepper tuna,  the dragon roll is always good.  If it's your first time you have to try something on the menu so you can experience the robot delivering the dish.

However, Sapporo staff told me I could park anywhere, even in spots marked for patrons of other businesses. Once inside, you are promptly seated at the table by the sushi-belt.

4699357,2017-12-10,10,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"The first revolving sushi restaurant in Las Vegas has arrived and I love it! I've seen the concept before on T.V. in Japan and I thought how convenient! However, this place does not sacrifice quality for novelty. It is actually functional and practical. Let me tell you more.

Right when you walk in, you will notice the modern decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. Textured walls with warm lighting gave way to a sleek stainless steel conveyor belt  displaying a menagerie of covered plates of sushi. I was greeted right away and asked to write my name down for the waiting list. There was quite a few people waiting ahead of me, but it wasn't too bad. There was a mixed crowd of couples, friends in pairs, large groups, and every age group imaginable. I love how this new concept is bringing everyone together to have some great food easily. It wasn't before long before my name was called and I was seated along side the belt. Rows of food with a name sign right before it rolls towards you and you can just pick it off and set it on your table. The owner came by to go over how the conveyor belt works and showed me how to order other kitchen items on the iPad. He was incredibly helpful, patient, and hard working. He also explained that all of the rotating plate items are on a 30 minute timer, so after 30 minutes the unsold plate automatically gets kicked out and is not served. The fish served is also flown in daily. Hooray for freshness! 

All the white plates on the conveyor belt has a set price so it is easy to keep track of how much you are going to spend by how many plates you stack up. So if you get pick happy, your tab can run as high as your plates! The special kitchen items on the iPad ranges from single hand rolls, to ramen bowls, full sushi rolls, desserts, appetizers ( like marinated pork belly ) and more of things I can't pronounce but I am sure to try in the future. If you order items from the iPad, the robot Roomba looking thing on top of the conveyor belt will roll out to you, flash some lights, and tell you your food is ready. You just pick up your dish and then it goes back in the kitchen area! So simple, but I just love it! I ordered the soft shell crab, tuna taco, yellowfin taco, and pork belly just to have it come out. Yes, I was amused by the robot, but a robot that brings me my food is a robot that makes sense. All of the sushi was really fresh. No fishiness or mushy textures. Just clean and bright flavors.  They are not big on putting mayo and creamy sauce in everything, do for once you can actually taste the quality of the fish you are eating. However, if you are into that yum yum sauce and the like you can find something on the iPad menu. The ramen noodle soup was brought out by a real person so that it won't spill. Smart. The soft shell crab was ok, not as soft as I wanted, but everything else was top notch. One of my favorites was the yellowfin taco. Firm and meaty with the crispy wonton taco shell. It was the perfect two bite tuna delight for me.

Service was really good and I think for being open on their sixth day, they are doing a great job. Everyone was working really hard and moving very fast. The owner was even helping  out with the tables and refilling drinks. The dedication and pride really shows in the product and how good the place looks. I think the growing popularity of this spot will only make them busier. I have no doubt that with the continued passion of the owner, chef, and workers of this new sushi concept in Vegas that this place will be a success. I will definitely be back and highly recommend.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,26,18,5,sPCDtsZXoCSSLuCbZNxb9w

Pros:
*Only a ten minute or so wait on a Friday night! 
*Very clean
*Cool high tech concept 
*Nice employees 
*Everything ordered on the iPad was made to order
*Fresh ingredients
*Everything on the belt was $2.50 so you could try some of the speciality rolls without committing to a larger portion size and higher price

Cons:
* You have to click on every specialty roll to see what's in it..should have a sort by fish type feature on the iPad.
*Time consuming dining experience
*Pretty long wait time from placing and order to receiving it (BUT everything is made to order so that is nice) 
*Expensive. $40 for one average person's fill of food. 

Food: 

California roll is good. 
Spicy salmon was pretty damn spicy. 
Rainbow roll was my fiancé's favorite! 
Popcorn lobster roll wasn't so good. The sweet sauce they cover it in is really off putting...unless you like your sushi sweet. The eel sauce isn't bad or good it's just strange.

Pretty easy to find off Spring Mountain. Well kept, clean restaurant with 4 belts that rotate 2 sections. Great selection of sushi: albacore tuna, halibut, salmon, shrimp, crab. Along with a nice selection of rolls and soups. Everything was so incredibly fresh and delicious. Little white plates roll out, covered, and you just grab what you want.

The Sapporo Revolving Sushi experience is just so much fun. All the plates are on display like little food gems just waiting to be picked up by you. When you order from the iPad a little trolley robot chan comes to deliver your food. So cool, I need one now. 

The quality of fish is great and the base price of $2.50 for everything on the rotary is more than reasonable. Most people I know find themselves full by the time they have eaten the equivalent of the price of an AYCE sushi dinner. You can find most of the popular Nigiri selections, half orders of special and classic rolls, side dishes, and desserts on rotation. Other selections and full rolls can be found on the iPad menu and will be delivered by the little trolley robot chan. Please remember to let her know that you are satisfied with her service by pressing the little button to return her to her home.

Inside there 3 different conveyor belts that have sushi going around.  There's a little label that tells you what sushi is coming up.  

The best sushi here is the Toro & the popcorn lobster.  The Toro is super fatty and buttery and melts in your mouth!

The popcorn lobster is tempura fried lobster on top of a Cali roll and with spicy mayo.  The owner gave us their garlic ramen on the house and that was really good as well.

The best part about this place is that you can still order off of the tablet located at each table.  A little electronic cart that comes out to your table.

You pay based off of how many plates you pull of the conveyor belt.  $2.50 each plate that consist of either 1 or 2 pieces of nigiri or 3/4 pieces of a roll.

4843236,2018-03-23,2,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I am giving Sapporo 2 stars because I rate a sushi restaurant based on the quality of the sushi, not its novelty of an old and tired concept of conveyor belt sushi that has been happening in Asia for more than twenty years.  

If you're expecting fresh sushi, you're at the wrong place. The belt is way too long and you cannot beat the traditional cut-it-plate-it-bring-it-to-your-table sushi.  These sushi were prepared then a lid is put on top of a plate and it travels the length of the belt, which is pretty long and sometimes a couple times around.  If you're an avid sushi eater, you'll notice the fish is starting to dry up.  (Side note, revolving sushi restaurants in Asia are usually much smaller and are built like a bar.  The length of the belt surrounds the chef area and that's it.  You see the chef preparing the sushi and putting it on the belt.  And the patrons have a quick turnaround; you eat and you leave so the next person can come in, ensuring the turnaround of the sushi to be short and fresh.)

If you want to give this place a try for the novelty of it, then yes, it's definitely a fun and new idea for Las Vegas.  A great way to impress your non-Asian date, but I won't be coming back.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,0,2,AOOFAM1qrA6TyWocfrbHXw

I'm a hardcore sushi person but it was the Black Garlic Ramen soup that was absolutely scrumptious--I know it's a goofy word but trust me, the right word. Conveyor belt sushi that really goes to the next level.  An RF label under the plates signals to staff to dispose of anything circling the dining room more than 30 minutes!  But I loved the robot that delivers special orders on a track suspended over the conveyor belt! Just grab your order and press the return button and the robot sails silently back into the kitchen.  We ate like little little piggies and the bill was a Benjamin for 4 people (no liquor). Our server Elina, was a super sweetie.",ABX2oCd-9kIyvNlhoibLNw,0,0,5,aj-DMoNrW_xAUcwLBQYKLQ

My family and I enjoyed it a lot.  The sushi was fresh and the ambiance was nice. I am a sucker for yellowtail, uni and red wine, and this place had it all. The wine was relatively inexpensive. I paid $5 for a glass of cabernet sauvignon. I also loved that you can order on an ipad aside from the conveyor belt and a little drone brings your special order to your table. 

Our server, Elias and the rest of the staff were really nice and attentive.
Everything on the conveyor belt is $2.50 a plate, not bad. They have a good variety. My husband ordered the tonkotsu ramen and he liked it. My kids had the miso soup with a side of rice and devoured it.  I ordered several plates of yellowtail, white yellowtail, bluefin tuna, and uni yummy!

We had to wait quite a while to get a seat, the place is a hot item right now.

$2.50 a plate of the conveyor 
There is a menu you can order from off the ipad mounted on the inside of the booth, when it is not rebooting that is.
When you order something on the ipad don't forget to send it, we had selected some things and they just sit there until you confirm.
Black garlic ramen was very flavorful
Special sushi order come out on a separate track on top of the conveyor and you get excited even when you haven't ordered anything :D
The softshell crab is so delicious.
We ordered a lot off the menu, not the belt.

We were seated on the right side, which has its own conveyor, so less variety and stuff hangs out a lot longer. Somebody said that it gets kicked off after 30 minutes, I can tell you it doesn't, there was a bunch of sad looking items that just kept going round and round for the whole time we were there.

The sushi tasted clean and you can order a whole roll when you don't see what you are waiting for running around.

The bill caused me to have some chest pains.

The nigiri on the conveyor is an extremely thin slice of fish on rice. the two pieces you get might equate to one piece at a regular sushi place and then it would still be small.

You get a varied number of slices of rolls per plate depending on what you pick.
These were also really small, AYCE sized, not I ordered a roll at a sit down sushi place sized.

So.. 
decor, nothing really.
price, seems inexpensive but it is not for the portion size.
service, ordered items show up pretty quickly, fun to get the little tram to deliver you some food.

4888559,2018-01-01,1,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"I came here on a Friday night with a group of friends. We saw that it was a hot & new spot on Yelp so we wanted to go and experience this whole sushi on the conveyor belt thing. Our waitress was pretty friendly & provided good service. When we went it had only been open for about 1.5 weeks so she was fairly new to the whole experience also. 
Basically any plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50 & you hang on to the plates towards the end so the waitress can keep track & count how many items you grabbed. There is an iPad on the table that's screwed on only at one end of the table. That was a major mistake because it was a total inconvenience for the ppl sitting at the opposite end. They couldn't see the menu on the screen & we would have to read out loud what was on the menu or they would have to stand up & lean over to look at the menu. We actually even ended up switching seats with each other so a couple of my friends could see the menu. Hopefully they figure out a new idea how to implement the iPad on the table without the inconvenience. 
Anyway, whatever you ordered off the iPad came out on a robot type machine & it lights up on your side if it is your order, pretty cool. The menu has different foods & prices including udon noodles, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. The appetizers were disappointing, I really wanted to love everything but unfortunately that wasn't the case. The branzino, shishito peppers, and pork belly was good. The clams (3 tiny, tiny pieces) tasted like it was just cooked in water, very disappointing because it cost $5 so definitely not worth it. The scallops were cold & I thought it would be thoroughly cooked, warm, & delicious but it was not. The soft shelled crabs are also very small & I wasn't feeling the flavor at all. My friend tried the oyster & she said it tasted like it came straight from the ocean and didn't know how she managed to swallow it. I felt like the appetizers were priced too high especially because they weren't that great. But the cooked sushi was good & I couldn't eat any raw sashimi or nigiri because I'm pregnant so I can't review those items. My friends did say they were delicious especially the blue fin tuna & toro, so I'll be back to try out the stuff I couldn't eat. I think at the end of the night we ended up with 28 plates, so average about $35-40 (6 of us) a person including tip, not too bad.",XBvqoM6BaeAA-zdpB4Vctg,2,1,4,0SI2M_i0MjX6KykUjhGLjQ

After the novelty of the conveyer belt and the delivery ""tray"" for the specially ordered kitchen items wears off, there was really nothing about the place I would come back to check it out.

Service was prompt and friendly. That's the only thing that the place has going for them. You get charged by the plate which is $2.50 (*edited pricing*) unless otherwise noted. Waters were refilled on a timely manner. The cons outweigh the pros:

1. They do not carry natto (fermented soybeans). 

2. The ordering tablet doesn't allow you to make special requests from what I've seen unless I was completely blind.

3. The skin on branzino with the orange purée looks pretty on the tablet but fails upon delivery. Skin was not crispy at all. The carrot puree underneath was lacking seasoning, however, the sweetness of the carrot came through. 

4. Some of the sushi on the conveyer belt had dried out edges to it. Some of the ""higher"" priced items like salmon belly looked iffy.

5. Limited dessert selection.

If you want to try it out, come for the novelty. Prices does get out of control if you don't watch it. It averaged out to about $30 for 3 people, so basically stick to your AYCE spots unless you're here to entertain friends.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,4,DijHLIqvGpBjZ8ViLfDj3Q

We went to Sapporo after checking out the reviews. We came during their late night happy hour that had several liquor specials as well as half off the sushi on the revolving belt. 
We first started by the bar to grab some beer as we waited for our table to be set. The bartender was great and was nice enough to have us sample the beers offered before ordering.
Once we were seated, the staff informed us how it worked. Mainly you grab the plates of sushi off the belt and keep the plates at the end for them to calculate the total. You can also order other dishes on the tablet, but they are not counted in the happy hour special. The special order items either are served by your server or comes out to your table on the robotic tray above the belt of moving sushi.
The sushi selection on the belt was a mixture of special rolls and nigiri. The sushi was very fresh tasting. I thought that their special rolls were interesting in combination of flavors. What's also cool is you can see a slight view of the chefs making the food in the back.

You can have small portion of everything like buffet does

Fresh ingredient for sure since the turnover was pretty high and busy
Server was attentive

Cons :
If you eat A LOT, like really A Lot; well I consider myself to eat a lot too, of course all you can eat place will be a better choice for you since bill stacks really easy and quick

I had the black garlic ramen and oh my it was DELICIOUS!  The menu prices were good and I definitely didn't think anything was over priced.  Their sushi menu was nothing to get excited about though, it was a little small however the few plates I tried were good.  The rolls on the plates were a little small too.  

When I ordered a specific roll, it got delivered to my table on a little flat mobile trolly type device. It was pretty neat but after I took my plate off of it, it kept telling me to take my plate. It took me several seconds before I realized I was supposed to push the button on it, to send the device back.  

This place definitely missed the mark on 1 important thing. The table tablet display.  It was bolted to the far end of the table, and couldn't be rotated or angled at all.  I was dining by myself and even I had trouble viewing it and ordering from it, because it wasn't facing ME.  The tablet also couldn't accept any form of payment.  Go to Olive Garden and check out their table tablet display. It's mobile and anyone at the table can use it and see it.  You can also pay by card with it.

Every table is on the line and able to grab things from the belt at any time. Each plate on the line is $2.50, which can add up quickly. Service was ok but not great.

The rolls come in 3, but you can try them before you decide to get a full roll. Not everything is on the revolving track but a lot of decent options.
As for the food the best thing we had by far was the deep fried soft shell crab. All the rolls were pretty standard for a sushi place, definitely had better in other spots. Sexy girl, tiger roll, bonzai.

Some of the misses were the garlic edamame and miso soup which was too salty. Gyoza didn't have a a sauce.The popcorn lobster on the belt ended up being a little cold so be careful when getting hot dishes from the revolver. 

They also DO NOT have fresh wasabi! Very surprised. If you've had fresh before you would never want the paste. 

Overall the place was a very fun and unique dining experience. Unfortunately the food didn't back up its modern style. Don't think it's a repeat next time the sushi craving comes back around.

Their sushi pieces are so small! It's like they cut a whole roll into 10-12 pieces that is supposed to be sliced into 8 only. If a piece of regular sushi is 1 inch thick, here it's like 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, the sushi's in the popcorn lobster was like this. We had a hard time using the chopstick because it was falling apart from being too skinny! Same thing with the diameter of their sushi it's so small! 
2 star is for the customer service and the flavor/ taste of the food, it was good but I would rather spend my $$ somewhere else. 

2nd pic - tamago, where's the rice? Hiding because it was so tiny, seaweed that wraps around is so skinny too, even the tamago itself, have to hold it to eat it because it would fall apart. (That is a kid hand). 

You should try it and see it for yourself. Maybe after they read my review they would make improvements. Or probably we just came at a wrong day and the person assigned in the kitchen was not trained well in slicing/cutting the sushi .",ldIBLeflqehwYj_T6r0yOg,0,0,2,edHurRxOOyMd4WacjcvXlQ

The host, Christian (not 100% with his name), was attentive and the most helpful of the staff during our experience here. This plan was given three stars because of him. Our server was a Caucasian lady who was really nice but wasn't around much? She came around like once? Other than that, the busser and host was always there to answer our questions or tend to our water refills. During our FIRST order on the Ipad, we ordered a bunch of nigiris, ramen for my son, and two udon bowls for my nieces. We probably had three rounds of orders through the Ipad and realized their udon never came at all. My cousin noticed the table that was sat maybe 10-15 minutes after us, had their udon orders. It definitely killed our vibe since my nieces had a long day of cheer competition. We first brought it to the attention of the busser, then the host, then our ""server"". Once they got it, my cousin wanted to take it to go but again, no one was around to bring to-go containers. Everyone in our party was done eating while they just got started on theirs. Poor girls. Don't get me wrong, they were all nice but if they came around more to make sure our orders were brought to our tables and scarfed down into our hungry bellies, this would've been a better experience. As for the menu itself, it's okay...I think it's not as generous as what we're used to. Hence, I'd rather get some sushi at an AYCE spot than here. We left hungry and dissatisfied but, tried to make the best of our experience. I guess I had HIGH expectations for this place...maybe that's why the outcome seems more disappointing.

5319352,2018-01-17,3,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"The first and only conveyor belt sushi in Vegas. Despite the roots and reasoning behind conveyor belt sushi restaurants (to sell cheaper cuts of fish to the masses), it's still a neat concept to me. You plop yourself to your seat and wait for food to come to you. If you must eat, might as well go all out lazy!

I've only been to under 10 conveyor belt sushi restaurants in the US and other countries and my review would be based on those experiences.

So, hooray for Vegas having conveyor belt/ revolving sushi. The biggest gripe I have is that the food selection is very limited. Tuna, salmon, crab, tamago, spicy tuna, a sprinkling of fatty tuna, surf clam, caterpillar roll, and a few others + dessert. I'm not sure what their policy is when it comes to taking off a plate that's been around a few times. They have an iPad at each table so if you want a specific item, you can order it and a little tray comes zipping above your head - you have to be alert though and pay attention because you might be grabbing other people's food across from you. If the light is on on your side, it's yours. However, their iPads need to be reset a lot.

The quality of their fish is just okay even during their first week of being open. Each plate is like $2.50 depending on what you get, you'll get 1-4 pieces per plate for the same price. You pay based on the number of plates.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,7,3,rAw_j9TVtFUr4RWMvHPSMQ

5349116,2017-12-03,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"Las Vegas' FIRST conveyor belt sushi restaurant! 

Came here tonight with some friends and my husband. It was their soft pre-opening or something? Apparently they were opened the last two nights as well but it was invite only. I'm super jealous that some people got invited! 

I saw on Facebook that they were opened for a limited time on Dec. 2nd for dinner 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm. When I saw that, I immediately showed it to my friends and husband, planned for an early dinner at 5:00 pm. The parking situation is a little weird because they had a lot of parking spots but a lot of them had names of other establishments or they had the word ""reserved"" on them. Except there's a sign in front of Sapporo saying that you can park anywhere. Sooooo not really sure how that really goes.

We got there a bit early and got seated right away. They told us already that the food won't come out until 5:00 pm and we were fine with that. They have an iPad system on all the tables where you can order things if you don't want to grab it from the conveyor belt. The iPad also keeps a tally of all the things you ordered, which is great. 

As you can probably tell by now, they have a conveyor belt with different types of nigiri. They even have signs before them so you know what you're grabbing. What I did notice is that the sushi starts in the middle of the room before making it to the other side, which kind of sucks because if there was something we wanted ... but everyone else also wanted, we wouldn't be able to get it. We could order it .. but we also noticed that the fish isn't consistent. Some pieces would be fattier and other pieces would be more lean. There wasn't enough salmon on the conveyor belt for us so we had to order two more orders but they came out quite lean. We like our fatty salmon belly pieces! Booo! 

Also, for the ordering system, they have a custom cart that stops right in front of your table with your order when it's ready. It also tells you, ""Your order is here. Please take your order."" Super cool. It reminds me of some of the sushi places in Japan that does that. 

Onto the sushi! We focused mainly on the nigiris. They have rolls too. Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50. They have hand rolls too but you have to order them. They weren't on the belt. They are also $2.50. They have udon and ramen to order. The nigiri are mostly two pieces to a plate unless you get the premium items: toro, king crab, uni. Those are one piece per plate for $2.50. Honestly, toro for that price is a STEAL. Most establishments charge $8-10 for one piece of toro. The sushi is quite fresh. I think the only thing I didn't care for is the rice. It was good but it was missing something. They also packed it a lot where it doesn't feel as soft -- felt a bit more hard and squished. 

Don't worry about the fish staying out too long. Their conveyor belt has senors whenever a plate gets put on there. They have a timer for it so if a plate has been on the belt for 30 minutes and hasn't been eaten, it will be trashed!

You keep the plates at your table so at the end of your meal, they can tally it up and give you your total. Service was great -- they were willing to split our check in anyway we want! 

TIP: If you're a huge eater, this may not be the place for you. These things can add up fast. I would suggest you do AYCE if you eat a ton. Haha. 

This place brings back memories of when I used to have the boat sushi back in San Francisco with my mom and grandma. 

Overall, decent quality. Good service. I would come back :) And would suggest people give it a try.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,3,4,UMGT6goNShGzB8UCBsUhVQ

Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50 and you can order other items from the tablet at your table. I took several items off the belt and also ordered from the tablet. 

Conveyor belt items -
Snow crab nigiri - crab was sweet and tasted fresh
Popcorn lobster roll - covered in mayo/sauce, heavily breaded
Lobster roll - doused in a sweet sauce, couldn't taste anything else
Seaweed salad - refreshing, good quality and flavor
California roll - had a generous amount of crab
Gyoza - greasy and soggy, flavor was good
Shrimp taco - shrimp was in a tart mayo/sauce?, wasn't into it
Tuna taco - like poke in a tortilla chip shell, delicious, would eat a whole tray of them

Tablet items - 
Udon soup - broth was really sweet for some reason, wouldn't order it again
Vanilla ice cream - this was a big ""womp, womp"" for us. We put in the order for the ice cream on our tablet. Then the waiting game began. 5, 10, 15 minutes went by. Someone finally stopped at our table and asked if we ordered vanilla ice cream. I said yes, but we hadn't gotten it yet. Another few minutes went by until we finally got our bowl of ice cream. Strangely, the person brought it to us from the front of the house so I'm not really sure where they store their ice cream. My kiddo was kind of bummed it didn't come out on the automated tray that runs above the conveyor belt. C'est la vie. 

The service was pretty good for a busy Friday evening. Staff was attentive and we didn't feel rushed even though there was still a line of people waiting to be seated. This experience was a little rough but I'd give it another shot. There are tons of items we didn't get to try so we'll be back again.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,0,0,3,nP6N7R2Mo349H4nOUrGP8Q

The concept is familiar in areas like San Francisco, so I was excited to see some parts of that concept being brought to Vegas. They pretty much nailed that part at Sapporo. However, I feel as though their quality in taste needs some work.

Because it's a la carte, I would expect everything to be at it's best, as you would do if you're paying 2.50 for two pieces of fish. However, I was kind of disappointed; there really isn't anything special about the fish, and if you're looking fish with more quality for the price, then I suggest AYCE would be a better choice. I don't mind it being expensive, but if it is, might as well be worth every penny right? Unfortunately, this selection did not offer that case.

My favorite sushi dishes from this place was Salmon Belly and Uni. Both were memorably fresh and mouth watering.

My favorite from there was not the sushi, but the black garlic ramen was exceptionally good, and a taste that I haven't tried out from other place. Definitely give that one a go.

There was also this dish that you could order, I forgot the name but it has clams in it. Please save yourself some money and don't get that. It has a bunch of flavored water surrounding it that was completely unnecessary, and the taste was just salty rather than savory.

One of our favorites in Hawaii back in the day was very much like this place, a moving conveyor belt of freshly made sushi moving past your table. You picked what you wanted and price was based on the color of the plate. Sapporo differs slightly, all plates off the belt are $2.50, but the smartly added bonus, a computer pad at the table, allowing you to order everything from specific sushi rolls, ramen, tempura, to dessert. 

One thing to note, when you order, a small robotic tray comes on top of the conveyor belt to deliver your order, it stops in front of your table announcing that your order is being delivered. Our first time, had no idea and took the plate only to discover it wasn't ours. The robotic delivery tray will flash yellow and announce your order, it's a little confusing the first time.

- When you specifically order something, a specialized cart gets shot to your table. Super cool!
- The orange salmon was very very delicious.
- Garlic edamame (Order it via the iPad, it's $1 more but made to order and a bigger portion) was yummy!
- The service was great. I was really impressed with how our waitress was smiling and recommending dishes to us. I wish I caught the waitress' name because she definitely needs to be commended for being so friendly and nice to my family and I.

Overall, I can't wait to come back to eat there. Quality of food was good and service was wonderful. Price wise it was very reasonable for what you were getting. Definitely a jewel in Chinatown.",3IYAg_uv6w4N9-KF5nerKg,2,0,5,Ae-DTv9wMvWT-dQl70cFzg

5485507,2018-02-01,0,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,Super mediocre sushi place but of course I had to try it since it was our first revolving sushi restaurant in Vegas. Maybe I just went on a bad day but who knows. The fish to rice ratio is a lot of rice with a little fish and I definitely do not like that. I also thought the fish was pretty dry as if it's been sitting out for a long while. The good thing about this place was that our waiter was very nice.,rYnHybeEX8U22M3waYztLg,1,0,2,ddY2uhviaAAm0RbBm1XmGw

All the plates rotating around are $2.50, and most of the rolls were 3 pieces per plate and nigiri 2 pieces per plate.  I ordered the nigiri off the tablet so it would be made fresh, since some of the rolls we got off the belt were not very fresh. I think anytime you fry something and slap a plastic cover over it, it gets kind of chewy.   The fish seemed fresh from the orders off the tablet. If you know what you want, I would just order off the tablet and skip the belt.  I think the belt is just a novelty and it at least gives you a visual of what you are ordering.  We saw the rave reviews about the black garlic ramen, so we had to try it.  Surprisingly tasty for a sushi joint, the broth was pungent and the noodles were well cooked, but don't expect more than a sliver of meat.

5517431,2017-12-31,1,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"4 stars for the experience, really. Here it is, if you are looking to get full on a budget, perhaps you got a big stomache...don't come here! Bring your money to an AYCE. You aren't going to get fancy shmancy rolls jizzed with 3 different type of sauces and a partidge in a pear tree. You aren't going to get a novel of a menu either. Walk....out...now.

If going to an AYCE isn't worthed because you don't got that big of a stomach, but you pay the AYCE price anyway because it makes more sense to or you're not really maximizing your money at an AYCE...then walk...in...now.

I love the layout, the spaciousness, and that there are 3 different conveyor belts for each area of seating. The revolving sushi I've been accustomed to...literally revolves. You'd have to pray no one takes the plates that have been put out...which means you're better off just ordering the dang thing. Their system here with different belts running, perfect. They have a sensor so that if the plate has been revolving around for 30 mins, it gets pulled off ensuring we get the freshest quality. 

At 2.50 per plate...it was pretty worthed. Think of it as happy hour pricing if you need a brain-psych. The hubs and I have kinda been off the AYCE train for a bit as we prefer to just ala carte when we  have sushi. This place is perfect for us! My favorite is their garlic tuna nigiri! My hubs has pretty much had all the nigiris they have to offer, and he said they all tasted as fresh as this desert can offer, no chewy pieces, and nothing flooded in sauce! They also offer oysters, however, at 2.50...tis only plated with 1 oyster. Eek.

There are other things available through their iPad ordering system where you will find items that are NOT 2.50. Through this, I have ordered their spicy tuna and salmon skin rolls, veggie tempura, and ramen. I purposely ordered the spicy tuna and salmon skin on each visit to gauge it properly, and both times I thought it needed work. 

For one, my salmon skin was soggy each time. Ugh. I was literally playing tug of war when biting into it that it kinda pulled my handroll open and when I looked in it...it was pretty skimpy. They do that illusion trick where they stick the salmon skin out of the wrapmaking you think it's pretty filled when really...whatever peeking out is literally it. My spicy tuna, while spicy...was bland. Most likely will never order those handrolls again. I'm sure they fry it in advance to be efficient...but in that situation, I don't mind a wait. Though I can't speak for the thousands of other people who do. 

My vegetable tempura was visibly oily as the plating told me so. I ate it anyway chasing it down over hot green tea. Lol. Despite the plate showing evidence of it not draining long enough...thankfully, my tempura was not soggy and even more thankfully they didn't plate me with vegetables I wanted to throw under the table. Hi mom! I also had the black garlic ramen offered, and sadly...that was bland. Edible...but bland. But I'm here for nigiris! The quality of my nigiris did not fail.

One thing I highly suggest, they should consider giving a menu to large groups. It could just be a laminated menu for people that have noooo way of getting to the iPad to conveniently browse through as the tablet is fixed at the end of the table closest to the belt. With that said, if it's your first time in and you're rolling in deep...you're shorting yourself of the full experience so I suggest coming back with just another person or 2. When you're at the end of the table, you have to make your other friend at the belt go fishing for you. Boring. I'd like to sit where I can scroll through the menu and nab my own plate of choice daghang salamat (thank you very much)

Service has never been neglectful, always attentive without being overly about it, and it was my birthday the last visit....and got my waiter and the manager to sing to me over ice cream! I thought that was fantastic as I knew the waiter was not so willing which I'm sure was out of embarrassment...but after some encouragement from his manager and me asking where's my song...he did!!! Which sounds very diva of me...but if you know my humor and all the little things that led up to that moment...You'd get it. Loosen up a bit will yah. Lol. I really really appreciated It! That was awesome of them. Made my night.

Perfect place to go when you wanna quickly grab some nigiri/sushi. If money isn't on the mind, by all means. I've been waiting for  revolving sushi since I've moved here (2004). While I certainly have had better...Sapporo is definitely a winning option for me and the hubs. I'd say it's even perfect for those with kids who have a small stomach. 

You could get away with a stroller in here so no need to fret if the baby is sleeping...roll on in. 

It's definitely worth the try or to check off your list especially if going to an AYCE is too much for you.

Enjoy!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,3,5,4,jttZcMPsVMLauFDvBgvdDA

This place is MODERN, and I just think the concept of the revolving sushi (and other food besides sushi) is SO cool. They have a set price for every plate you pick of the revolver which is supposed to give you a little of everything and if you like it, you order a bigger plate ($2.50) and in the end they count how many plates you have and add that to your total. You can also order ""bigger"" meals off of the iPads! If you order any type of roll, they come out on the revolver. The food is GREAT! We came back to order the Lobster Roll and the noodles are great as well as the Black Cod. We also tried the Green Tea cake and it was AMAZING. Prices are reasonable (a special roll of 9 is $7.50). Service is great, everyone is friendly, and it's just something new from the Eastern Coast.

For a place that is pretty much automated don't think it's not a personal experience, they have plenty staff and you can see the cooks through plexiglass and see just how this place operates and see they're hustling their butts off. 

Now I came here 2 times in one week, it's more than affordable and if you come during happy hour, plates are pretty much half off.

We mainly resorted to picking out from the conveyor belt...ordered a few appetizers from the iPad on the table, as well as a few drinks from the bar. The restaurant itself was crazy busy. One thing I do have to point out was the staff was very friendly. Also, one thing I like is seeing everything clean and everyone diligently working. The staff matched the pace of the restaurant traffic. Another thing I liked was the management was also very nice and was also helping the wait staff with tables and bussing. I have already recommended this place to a few friends. I enjoyed the food very much I could barely breathe! We took about 17 different plates. My favorites were: peppered tuna, lobster roll, their gyozas (cooked to my level of satisfaction). I didn't really like the drink I ordered the peach melon margarita because it was strong (but I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol) so I'm sure others will enjoy!

(im guessing 30 mins tops - before they discard it).. but if you order from the tablet.. it will be freshly made and shuttled over to you by a small cart that zooms on top of the belts and straight to your table..

With happy hour after 11, this place was a little gem in an area full of new and happening Asian restaurants. I understood it to be busy during regular hours, but it wasn't really busy around midnight. For someone who doesn't enjoy all the crowds of people on the strip, this might be the place to go for a decent meal where you could polish off decent sushi at a $1.50 per plate at happy hour. Normally they're $2.50. Not bad. 

They have all the usual on the conveyor, and an iPad menu for all the regular stuff which is all very reasonably priced. Should you order something off the iPad, you get a cute little robot tray that comes to you and stops with your sushi and a friendly greeting. How fun, right?

It's a no brainer to come here before your big plans or early adventures, especially when its past 11pm because it won't be too bad. You can polish off all the sushi - rolls (popcorn - my favorite, tiger, garlic tuna, lobster, and more), nigiri (salmon, tuna, squid, octopus, striped bass, mackerel, yellow tail, sea bass), sashimi and lots of apps like gyoza.

There were many more dishes to choose from besides your typical sushi, such as carpaccios, ramen, and appetizers. We sampled the yellowtail, super white tuna, unagi, bluefin tuna, toro, and salmon and found them all to be pretty fresh and tasty. 

The only major negative was that all the nigiris were so small! The pieces of fish aren't that big and they only give you a tiny amount of rice. Usually i get full off 6 plates at a revolving sushi spot, but I was only half full here.

5716287,2018-02-14,7,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,"""Vegas' first revolving sushi restaurant has arrived!"" is what I heard about Sapporo's opening.  This is a big deal!  Sushi on a conveyor belt?  How exciting, I must try!  However, it's not my first time seeing this concept and I had expectations going in.

I want to preface by first saying I've been to two amazing revolving sushi spots prior to my Sapporo visit: (1) in rural Fukuoka, Japan where most will eat sushi with their fingers, not chopsticks; and (2) Kula, a revolving sushi chain in SoCal and Texas.  Both of these were great and I thought nothing could be better, so I was carrying bias and was a little reluctant about Sapporo.

The food is fresh and nicely proportioned at $2.50 per plate.  If I wasn't very hungry this would be great place for a quick bite.  However, I suggest coming in for lunch like I did.  Prior to this lunch, I foolishly came starving for dinner on a Friday night and waited 30 minutes before leaving to eat somewhere else - Sapporo gets packed!

Knocked off at least one star for this: Sapporo's appeal is through its tech.  If it doesn't work properly, we don't get our food.  Aside from the belt, there's an iPad from which you can order additional items and on more than one instance, it would not take our order (see my attached photo).  When it does work, your order comes out on the top shelf, delivered to your table... but sometimes it goes to the wrong table like it did for one group next to us - they just watched their food go back and forth, passing them to another table.

At the end of the day, it's just another sushi spot.  This one just has the conveyor belt.  Game changer would be if this was AYCE.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,8,7,3,z0JeKhL-CYmJjKeRTa0Rqw

Good pricing & the sushi was wonderful!
The conveyor goes through the kitchen where the chefs are preparing the rolls and new items are constantly popping by you!

 Pick a spot next to the kitchen where the conveyor is coming out if you are eatting solely off the conveyor so you get first choice!",4FIN5i-xk8d5GoF8ikjAKg,0,0,5,pG0Q5f8ELGrJ1kaiMgfqOA

Freddy is very friendly and makes you so feel so welcome. Learned a lot from just talking to him both visits, like why Vegas hadn't had a revolving sushi yet and some info about their conveyor belts and how it all works. He gave us a nice little tour around the restaurant the first night to explain how everything works. Very passionate about this industry and all of his restaurants. 

Food is delish, and even the single dessert that they had available. Can't wait for them to add more flavors for it, like strawberry. There was different looking toro first and second visit for me so one of the chefs explained how they're actually 2 different kinds of toro and so we will probably request that next time :)

Overall I love the vibe and the atmosphere. Everyone is super friendly and nice, and they are pretty attentive to your needs. I will be back many times over and look forward to their infinite amount of new ideas to be implemented.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,1,5,CfJuN2NO83rzPIH9P2VQQQ

The so-so: the sea urchin was not particularly good. I passed up some salmon items because some of the salmon did not look to be of a good quality--clearly farm raised fish.

This is better than the revolving sushi place I went to in Atlanta, but I would still say that it is still a place better enjoyed with a group more interested in a fun experience than particularly high quality sushi.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,0,3,s2kYdfhjjIc-hKQXBJOXog

It is so fancy and nice for local to have conveyor belt sushi place in town. But at the first bite of mine was just okay. Fish not fresh and tasteless. maybe just because that plate I took it sitting in the belt for awhile but shouldn't be, because dinner time just start.  I think then I should try something that order from the menu. I order orange salmon since I saw so many reviews talked about it. It's still just okay for me. Then my husband and I just decided to leave after we tried so many dishes but we are not satisfied at all. And with the bill came out around 50$ which we should be full but NO. We are still hungry.

The quality of the sushi is pretty great.   REALLY fresh.   We actually thought it was the best tasting super white and spicy tuna we've had in quite some time. 

They have an iPad at every table so you can place orders of items that don't pass you on the conveyor belt.   You can also hail your server through it as well.   Although this wasn't really necessary for us because the server and the bussers were always around and checking on us. 

We weren't that hungry so all we just got a few rolls and nigiri but I'm actually quite excited to come back and try some of their hot items appetizers.

Food - AMAZING. They offer different varieties of sushi, ramen & other cooked items. This place is very affordable ($2.50) for items on the belt. But they also had other items $2.50& up but was totally worth it. The fish was fresh & the ramen was so big and delicious for ($4.50). I HIGHLY recommend the orange salmon. It was so gooooood!

Ahi was very fresh and the quality was very good. I'll say it would contend with some of the best in Hawaii. Prices are super affordable, each plate on the conveyor belt are $2.50. They have daily Happy Hours that start at 10pm-closing, where ALL plates are $1.50 and japanese draft beers are half off.  They also have a menu where you could order rolls and other dishes, which range from $4-$9. 

The fact that they have lids on their plates and they have sensors beneath it, so after 30 minutes they're removed from the conveyor belt..is absolutely genius. You never have to worry if dishes were sitting out too long.

There's a touch screen menu at your table where you can order ramen (I hear the black garlic ramen is great), udon, sashimi plates, and more. Once your special order is ready, it comes on this funny little train above you that tells your your is ready and starts singing and lights up.

Once I got the hang of it all I was totally immersed in the experience. Plates off of the conveyor belt are only two dollars which is super reasonable and you can either pick up 1 to 2 piece sushi or half rolls for that price. However if you'd like a full roll or anything from the kitchen you were able to order that as well. The selection was pretty large.

They put a few different rolls on a belt and after 10 or 15 minutes they toss them if not eaten. So unless your there at a busy time they don't put the good stuff on the belt. You have to order full rolls. I like the plate idea 2.50 per plate with one to four rolls on each depending on what it is. Also depending on what you order a robot like tray brings your food out or the server. They have desert but I feel they need mochi. I only gave four stars because during the day they aren't busy so you don't get as many specialty rolls to try and it's boring stuff on the belt.

Plus, with all you can eat establishments everywhere in the area where Sapporo is located, this place is definitely a go-to when we don't feel like eating too much. They have plenty of selections when it comes to appetizers and (of course) sushi but they also have ramen too! I highly recommend their Black Garlic Ramen if you're in the mood for ramen. 

The only issue I have with this establishment is customer service. Although most of the job is already being done by the revolving machine (to bring your food, since you can just grab most of the things that you want), it still takes a long time to get our drinks refilled or to find a server that would help us. I understand that there's a lot going on behind the scenes, but if you don't watch your customers attentively then you will surely deter them from possibly coming to your establishment again.

Negative experiences aside, if you would like to try this place, please do so! We don't have revolving sushi in Vegas, so this is definitely something that you should try.",gvs53lmnU-rwlwjOGstMFw,0,0,3,JyUZrnbs1ZFeGM4xqAaBeg

When I go for sushi, I start off with miso soup and lots of nigiri. And I felt like Sapporo did a good job on them both. The miso soup was flavorful and the fish quality was fresh in terms of off-strip prices. We roughly ended up spending $25 a person for rolls, tempura, and lots of nigiri including more premium pieces (toro, ebi, and uni) to share.

As others have stated $2.50 for a pair of nigiri is extremely fair, however quality of sushi is comparable to AYCE. I ordered the Orange Salmon which is an original at my personal favorite sushi spot. I would have gladly paid the few dollars more as Sapporo's orange supreme still included the orange membranes which made the experience less enjoyable. The black garlic ramen surprisingly was decent but don't hope for a generous portion of chashu. The bowl is about a half size and also half the price($4.25).

Definitely would recommend it to anyone especially if you've never experienced a conveyor style sushi restaurant. The prices are good at 2.50 for anything on the conveyor belt plus some various items at different price points you can order on a tablet. Your total dinner cost can add up quick though if you eat alot of the premium fish which only comes with 1 piece of nigiri per order. 

We had a great time, but I knock off a star mainly because water, wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce plates should come either right before you are seated or right after. The great thing about conveyor style sushi restaurants like buffets is you can eat almost instantaneously. It took at least 5 minutes to get water and another 5+ after that for the wasabi, ginger and soy sauce plates. I also hope the tablet problem gets fixed, most of us were finished but my gf wanted green tea ice cream and the tablet just wasn't working. The same thing happened to the table across from us. The placement of the tablet and the secured stand make it very awkward to fix while someone is having dinner, luckily we just ordered the ice cream from the waitress.

Not only do I get spoiled with the fresh AYCE options but now I get to be served without a wait. Coming from Hawaii and California, I am pretty spoiled when it comes to being served sushi with finesse. I've seen sushi on revolver belts, trains, and boats in water so being in Vegas where AYCE sushi is a BIG thing I was shocked there was no place like this until now. Me and my party arrived at 5pm and I suggest you all do the same as there was a wait soon as the restaurant opened and filled up all their seats. Our hostess gave my friend the rundown on how it works. Everything on the belt is $2.50! Yes TWO-FIFTY a plate! Such a deal for the options they give you. Please consult pictures for some of the mouthwatering options made available to to you. i would recap them for you but I fear I would start drooling. Now for those who want more than what's being on the belt, you can order off their computerized menu. Yes no waiting for your server to come around. You just choose what you want and send it on through. Sounds like heaven right? Wait, there's more! Most orders (not soups or desserts) will come out on their robotic food tram is what I called it. It plays music and stops right at your table all lighted up like a Christmas present! 

The restaurant itself is very clean and put together so well. 3 rows of booth tables with each row having their own belt and robotic food tram. They do have a bar so you are more than welcomed to sit there but why bother going if you are't going for the experience? Oh yeah, the FOOD!

AND SERVICE! Ann took great care of us and even offered to set my dessert on the robotic food tram if I wanted. Deep down I did, but she had more important things to worry about. Sadly, the strawberry shortcake I wanted was unavailable but the manager compensated for any other dessert on the house.

For now, I'll give 5 stars.

Room for improvement? I would hope they can add more items to the menu. Less rolls and more nigiri options could be a good idea. On another note, could it be a possibility to create an AYCE option without sacrificing the current quality? A higher price point may be acceptable especially with this set up.
