Since day one we could not get this grill to work (60 plus days). We had the gas company out, our pool company to check the line they ran and the company we bought it from, and no one had answers to what was wrong. I found John from another source of friends and called to explain what the issue was before I ripped the grill out. We set up a service call the following day and John was there. John did his research with Evo grill before arrival and when he opened up the grill we found the problem. It was not the gas or the pool companies issue,  it was the company that sold it to us. We bought a gas supplied system and says on our paperwork, but the company delivered and installed a propane supplied grill. John had the parts to transfer it over to gas and within a few minutes the grill was working.  We called the other company we bought from to complain and the owner, was not having it and said John was wrong. I told him how was John wrong when he fixed the issue. Then the started blaming the sales rep that he must have given us the wrong unit. I asked for a discount from that company, but he refused of course. I now know who I will be calling when any of my grills goes out and I have three.   Thank you John for making me not hate my Evo grill.",mq123QC63YymVb3UxeeguA,0,0,5,7MQC_Sj38YGc1j4C4HHSKg
833357,2017-07-27,0,PEFcy5D1nXdHS67Ge0h0Kg,We were looking for a BBQ store to merely purchase a rib rack when we stumbled upon the newly opened BBQ Concepts. Omid was technically closed but opened the store for us and we were so impressed with both him and  the shop that we purchased a Traeger Wood Fired Grill! Omid waited for us leave and come back with our payment even though he was already closed! Omid went out of his way with his kindness and information. We will for sure be back to try all of the awesome rubs and wood chips! They even build outdoor kitchens!,V51ECJPV96CFVxq0QhGueQ,0,0,5,WMi-jx4I23uAbEkDxHgjXw

They went the extra mile and overcame a challenging set of conditions.  Omid and Zane were innovative, thoughtful, skilled and meticulous in their execution.  I am in their debt for a truly above and beyond installation.",bcjtXTpbHWEof9gk4Y70zQ,0,0,5,aBxdlX6OGTuFxXTdpk6sig

These guys are great. Omid knows his stuff. He explained all the features of the different models and was by far one of the most helpful sales people I've ever dealt with. We got a great grill and will definitely be going back for accessories. When I get ready for my outdoor kitchen they'll definitely get my business.",nhkL2-Wn7OFMiwXMdxvB1w,1,0,5,6y_gUWsE1dMpfMNXUc3h-g

From the initial call to schedule our at-home consultation with Omid, I had a good feeling about this company. Omid listened to exactly what we were looking for, educated me on some products as well as made recommendations. We had a quote back with renderings same day! It took the other company an entire week for a generic quote. We were so impressed with Omid's responsiveness & professionalism, we decided to use them. From the the day we paid our deposit to job completion was 2 only weeks. The crew did a great job & we could not be happier! We highly recommend BBQ CONCEPTS! Can't wait to use our new outdoor kitchen!",WvanLjQlrp1OBScCI5o4Qw,1,2,5,cnSnYxXXlAUUnzOctkwa8w
