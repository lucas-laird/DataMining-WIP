My company had me 'just swing by and pick up' FOUR SANDWICHES that had been called in on my way back from a meeting. Flash forward 55 minutes and sixty bucks later and I'm still in the shop, having watched at least twelve other customers walk out with their food, some of which came in and ordered in-house. Not sure what takes four sandwiches so long to make or why so many others were served before me... but there I was. Finally got my sandwiches, rolled out and back to a very hungry team. One bite of my roast beef and I knew there was no way I was finishing it. It was the driest sandwich I've ever had in my life. I've had mouthfuls of sand that had more moisture. Another coworker had the same sentiments. After FOUR phone calls over the next 3 days with no manager on site, but four promises to have one call me back, Capriotti's gets the crap review. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant. I'm sure others have had great experiences here, but I'm not willing to flush $15 a sandwich when there are other options.

I asked to speak with the manager as their service is usually amazing, but alas he was not there. Gus told me he didn't feel comfortable making them. HELLO aren't you solely a sandwich shop? I suggest that a business shouldn't have an employee who can barely speak with out saying um every other word answer your phones. Also quick suggestion, someone who can't make sandwiches that works at a SANDWICH shop should probably not open alone! Moral of the story is the location on Sunset and Marks answered my call, spoke to me like professionals and said, ""absolutely no problem!""

Only one choice of bread: a soft, white baguette

Veggie turkey sandwich: I've never had vegetarian turkey, but it tasted fairly good. It went well with the condiments and the oil and vinegar. A good, light sandwich.

Cheesesteak: We always get this with the mushrooms, all the peppers and yes, lettuce. Being asian, I guess we can't really take the all meat sandwich. Made on the spot, the sandwich is good hot with the the melted cheese and some sriracha, tapatio, and some chips.

Others: They sell bags of small, medium, and large-sized chips that I've never seen elsewhere, but are good. Slightly more oily than other chips, but taste fine. They also sell brownies and other sweets.

Service: Always greeted, fast service, cheers for beer money when receiving tips, but one negative, the guy in the front had to make a side comment about our ""preposterous"" order of adding lettuce to our cheesesteak. wutevs. people are entitled to their opinion.

Everyone in my family LOVES Capriotti's. I seem to be the only one asking, ""What makes this place so great?!""

I'm not joking when I say I'd rather have Quiznos (preferably Togo's, but I have only had Togo's in California).

They are never consistent. When you order a sandwich on Tuesday it'll taste different from the one you order next Saturday. Guaranteed. They kill everything with peppers, even when I ask for NO peppers.

I'd rather have a toasted Italian from Subway. Or ANYTHING from Quizno's. And I haven't tried much other than the Italian from most places (just my preference - I know what I like).

One time I went here with my mom and my brother to pick up lunch and they closed the store without locking the front door because they RAN OUT OF BREAD.

We opened the door, stood there waiting and heard people in the back, and they laughed and came out and said, ""Oh, sorry...we ran out of bread a while ago. We should get some tomorrow.""

So AFTER we left, disappointed, they locked the door.

A sandwich shop with no bread...that's a new one.

Since this location was convenient, I walked in to find that it was pretty darn small, two tables for four and just a handful of two-seaters. To be honest, my first impression was that it was pretty run down, being in an older building. Even the loud level when I walked in was close to being bothersome.

However, as I saw how efficient the staff was servicing their lunch line coming in, showing their appreciation every time a customer generously left a tip saying ""We got beer money, guys!"" followed by hootin' and hollering. The line went amazingly fast, orders being completed and rung up in great speed.

The sandwiches. Not much to say, except the obvious, they are awesome. We ordered a couple of Bobbies, the Grilled Italian, and a turkey sub with all the fixings for me. To top it off, they carry Becky's Bundt Cakes. That day, the flavors they had were marble, carrot cake, and Chocolate Chocolate Chip. We grabbed two of the chocolates. Equally as yummy!

Great sandwiches. Great service. Even though it being very run down, small, and a little loud from the hustle and bustle, this location does an awesome job, that's what matters.",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,1,0,4,Pw4ZW8QXm_qrLedszOaV6g

This location had a persistent and on-going ROACH problem!!! 

I've seen multiple roaches in the bathroom... eek!! I was told by a member of management they were ""water bugs"" and nothing to worry about. Riiiight. I don't know about you, but when I see a pile of roaches writhing around in the corner of a bathroom I don't exactly feel particularly enthused about what's going on in the kitchen.

Then the owner dude who wears a baseball cap was extremely condescending and hostile towards his own employees, which didn't exactly encourage me to spend my money at his business, either, which is too bad as the employees themselves were always pleasant enough.... unfortunately, on top of everything else, my boyfriend has found a bone in almost each and every single one of his Bobbies that we'd ordered. Being REAL turkey it's understandable to find a bone every once in awhile, but he found full on VERTEBREA. How do you miss that?!

 Tonight I ordered my usual Chicken Cheese Steak from Capriottis, it's one of the only things I order there, other than the Bobbie. My wife picked it up on her way home, after a long day (we wanted easy dinner). When she got home she savagely ripped into her sandwich excited for the cheesey chicken goodness. She took a bite without looking only to be surprised it was beef. She spit out the bite and put it back on the plate she was eating it on. I volunteered to call and go back to the store for us and replace the sandwich. When I called and explained what happened (this has happened before, no big deal), I was asked to BRING BACK THE WRONG SANDWICH. I have had my order wrong before and this is the first i've heard of this. The town square location literally will deliver the sandwich if they get it wrong. 

Anyway, I drove back to the store with the sandwich bag and gave the guy working (really nice guy) my sandwich. He opened the bag and looked and said ""There is only half a sandwich here..."" I remembered that I only brought 1/2 the sandwich back because the other half was still sitting on the table. I said ""Ok.. well I thought the purpose was to make sure you in fact made the wrong sandwich- which you obviously did"". He then calls Carl Zwick, the ""district manager"". Carl informs him that I am only to receive half a replacement sandwich because I only brought half my sandwich back. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I go to this capriotti's a couple times a month, bring all my friends there when they are in town, etc. This is how you treat your customers? 

Carl Zwick, if you read this- you really need a lesson in customer service. First of all, mistakes should be expected when you are making food- it happens. However, the mistake should be rectified with as little to no hassle for the customer. I already had to drive back to replace it, wasting more of my night. 

Is half a sandwich worth losing a repeat customer from your location?",_rh-Mld2lippq1Vv2p8HoA,1,0,1,sLUMgD1YTJs5PfiYjHtpmw

Trying to be courteous, as they close at 8, we called ahead. We were told by the guy to call another Caprioti's that closes at 9pm. She was told it was too late for pickup orders. So then she said well we'll be there in a few minutes and maybe then they'd like to make us some sandwiches? By then he kind of changed his tune, but I was already irritated.  Off to a biz that wanted money. Why can't these small businesses treat customers right?  Do these workers understand they are going to be replaced by machines? The service will certainly be better.  With large sandwiches inching closer to $20 each now, you're better off going to a true restaurant.

Capriotti's is certainly consistent.  And the uniqueness of their Bobbi gets them more interest - however ... 
We were first introduced to Capriotti's in 1997 at their Buffalo/Cheyenne location.  Been back there once
Over the years they seem to have become more like a McDonalds of Gourmet Sandwich shops .. 
Dont care for the tip jar nor the comment by cashier when a tip goes in.
Husband enjoyed his Italian .. I got a salad - Roast Beef was chewy and tough and I asked for no peppers - they actually put extra instead.

First and foremost, the fact that I'm giving a sandwich shop 5 stars is pretty impressive.  I'm typically not much of a sandwich person.  Often times I find sandwiches to be kind of boring and really, only eat it if I'm trying to find a healthier alternative to fast food.  Well, let me tell you, Capriotti's is not boring and it's probably not much healthier than a fast food joint.  What Capriotti's is, is delicious (how many times can I use ""is"" in a sentence and still be grammatically correct?).  

I checked this place out while I was out in Vegas through the recommendation of a co-worker who swears by the Bobbe.  Basically a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form, it comes packed with real chunks of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/t3AWGr757V4Fvcun6sDsuw?select=K9tLR5HkxU-9tYZ1STmqYw).  Being a huge fan of cranberry sauce on my turkey sandwiches I just had to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint.  The turkey was tasty and not dry, the stuffing was flavorful, and the sandwich had just the perfect amount of cranberry sauce.  It was DELICIOUS!  

I also had a chance to try the cheese steak and a roast beef with coleslaw sandwich.  Both were phenomenally good.  I really wish this place were in California.  Please come to California Capriotti's!",_yJlV4FLvIr4J92XJiyEUw,2,1,5,nKhoR3T6EKM0I9u4SKWsIw
