I went through the drive-thru last night at rush hour and between the menu board order, where the nice girl over the speaker told me my total was $5.52 or something like that, and the window,I pulled out my wallet and got a $5 bill out then dropped my wallet in the car.  I spent the next minute or so feeling around the car to find my wallet but failed.  I got to the window and said that I only had $5 now and please remove an item from my order so I can pay with the $5 bill.  Apparently the manager on duty in the background told the nice girl to let me have the whole order anyway, for $5.  

This place is just awesome and corporate DT needs to know it.  I fill out their surveys and I always give them top scores.  I've been to others, this place is really great.",NU3RKnTbfnZJ3uSPJoNLOg,0,0,5,kntpRL9loikaAN9iYiYuBw

Revised review; I gave just place another chance. I went in this morning for breakfast and got the usual bad service. Not only that, I was short changed because she said she didn't have the change in the register to give to me. Are you kidding me!! If I'm short one penny, I have to break the bill and walk around with a pocket full of change. The lady behind me heard that and walked out. Then I get my food which was to stay, go to sit down and I can't because every single table in the restaurant was filthy so I ate outside. What kind of operation is this!? who runs this place!?who's the owner!!?? True, honest review this place just sucks!! Never again",L54qlH_WGhpF0n8Nojv6ZQ,0,0,1,W-HKg5MGigMN__vyhcs-HA

I was considering leaving after that display, but was out of the way of an affordable meal deal. I'll make a return to other Del Taco locations, but this one may have lost my respect and patronage. I also understand the amount that 2 packs would've been, but I'm paying for the service and it wasn't packed. Heck, this is at 9pm and there were no more than 7 people in the restaurant. I would appreciate it if my server didn't show any sort of unhappiness for something they're being paid for.",dcAUKw5GyBqwJB3wPg-qdw,0,0,2,fkW7iGBUh5ITFNDPboz5-A

It is only now that I write them a review, as I feel this specific restraunt is at its peak! When I first started to come here so long ago the service was terrible, the employees were rude, and the lounge was disgusting. However, over the years I have come to see this change for the better. Today this restraunt has the most friendly, organized staff i've ever seen in a fast food restraunt. Their food quality is on point, and they serving time is unbelievable. Everytime I walk in they greet me, take my order, and have me on my way within 2-3 minutes.

Their lounge is always spotless, and their customer service is always amazing. Two employees that always come to mind are Mabel, and Kevin. They always make sure my experience is the best, and they are the biggest reason I continue to come back every time i'm in need of some fast food!

Thanks for the amazing improvements guys! Keep up the great work!",NNsrBR25olLGM_vX6fO3cw,0,0,5,Bg-Q3kOeZgIS39eER9uA1Q

Service wasn't great but what can expect from fast food employees working third shift. I ordered the #1 del taco combo which comes with 2 hard shell tacos, fries, and a drink. Was told that the fryer, grill and other appliances were down for the next 2 hours. They gave me nachos and cheese instead of fries and they also gave me tomatoes after I said none. Despite the service quality I would go back.",QNPnUUfXXntykgPkg8Z9KA,0,0,4,GTOuLFn7k99vSNsJei3Oxg

Your order will ALWAYS be wrong. Always.

I don't know how many times I have asked for a ""bean and cheese burrito with NO sauce"" and ended up will a sauce explosion. Nachos with no cheese, ask for a side of secret sauce... Get sour cream. 

Flour tortillas should be soft, not crunchy. Also, why are you hoarding the cheese? Put some on the tacos. 

Will drive the extra miles to not give them my business.
