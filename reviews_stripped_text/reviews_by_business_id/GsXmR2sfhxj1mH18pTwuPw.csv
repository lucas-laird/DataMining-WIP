The burger had great flavor and cooked well but no toppings ( where was the lettuce tomatoes onions) just bacon. The bun did not hold up at all and wound up soggy. Unsure if we would stop by again.,EwnKi6_3XE10jcyTyyVA6A,0,0,2,HnUQlLaQaZ7Qc-E4LElJ_A

We would constantly pass by this street vendor, and after a few weeks passed, we decided to give it a go. Situated on an open lot at the corner of N. Grand Canyon and Horse Drive off US 95, you can't miss the huge white trailer or the signs advertising BBQ and SLUSH PUPPIES!!!(yup, he has a Slush Puppie machine inside the trailer)

We were the last customers of the evening(about 9 pm) and by then, Mr. Jorgenson had already run out of ribs and brisket, but still had burgers, hot dogs, hot links pulled pork, and of course SLUSH PUPPIES! His Hot dogs and Links aren't made from scratch, but his meats, burgers, and sides are. Meats are either sold by the pound, or you could get them in a sandwich(brisket, pulled pork) We decided to split a Pulled Pork Sandwich and a Smoke N Pig Burger at $7 each and two SLUSH PUPPIES!!! We chose Grape and Sour Apple, $3.50, 24 oz. He also has Cherry and other flavors too.

Conversating with Mr. Jorgenson while making our order, we found out a few things-

This man is very passionate about his barbecue, very personable too...

Mr. Jorgenson is kinda like MacGyver....He was out of hamburger buns, so what does he do? Sandwiches the burger and Pulled pork with two hot dog buns! Love It!

He's known to have off the menu specials every once in a while
*He recently had Baked Spaghetti that he sold out of...

He also accepts credit cards-suh weet! most Street vendors are cash only

He is one of the last (if not, the only) vendor in Vegas that has SLUSH PUPPIES!!!
(Sorry if you don't get the nostalgia behind it...:P)

The Pulled Pork was nice and juicy without being too fatty with a nice smokiness to it, and the sauce is a combination of sweet, tangy, and smokey with a little kick at the end. The burger which is his own blend of chuck and brisket was done over an open flame grill to a perfect medium rare/medium with a nice char flavor with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and your choice of cheese. Wifey went with the Jalapeno Havarti as suggested by Mr. Jorgenson. We were very pleased with our choices, but would ask for more sauce on the pulled pork and to toast the buns for sandwiches/burgers.

His business hours vary...He opens at 5 pm, closes between 9 and 10 pm, depending on business, availability of items, and takes two days off a week.
If his trailer isn't there, he's off doing a pop-up service at a local business in town.

*The best thing to do before taking the drive out is call to check hours, availability of items and location so you won't be disappointed. Definitely looking forward to returning much earlier to try Smoke N Pig's Ribs, Brisket, and sides!  ALOHA!!!

Had the angus burger with pulled pork (see pictures) - simple and delicious. Baked beans w/bacon as a side prepared with perfect consistency. Wonderful flavors come out of this truck. Had an order of brisket to go which was equally well done. Current truck location is MLK and Bonanza. Give them a call first to check future locations.",VMAFv8KALDgeg1gSq_BumA,0,0,4,jCbyFOvVEyIdrCgR4NlCwA
