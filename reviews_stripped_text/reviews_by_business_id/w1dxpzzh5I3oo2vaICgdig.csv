I hung up the phone and went right there from Summerlin so my kids could get a taste of what I've been telling them for years ... now all they want is the taco man on Sloan ... my only wish is that he wasn't so far away and he was open every day ... it's a long wait for Wednesday at the auction or on the weekend when he's open ...

1339656,2017-12-26,0,w1dxpzzh5I3oo2vaICgdig,I can't even explain how much I love this place and how good the tacos are. Hands down some of the best tacos I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of tacos). The flavors are most authentic and I believe they have a vegetarian option for those interested (although I've never had one because the carne asada and chicken tacos are amazing). The best thing is that this is near my home and I can visit if I ever have taco cravings (but only Thursday through Sunday of course). Would definitely recommend for late night taco runs with family and friends!,i1PPLOF5Bc7_mVx__5k_xg,0,0,5,YpvAzIcO2b5FkVjbZZkzjw

The meat was moist and flavorful, the toppings were fresh.  The tacos are priced appropriately for their size, these are not the tiny little street tacos you would typically expect.

However; it's well worth the wait and eating outside or in your car. They have a few chairs where you can sit, but its always busy. I like it so much that i don't mind eating standing. I'm giving 5 stars because the food it's just great. Also, because it's hard to find clean, fresh and great food.

4040071,2015-11-17,2,w1dxpzzh5I3oo2vaICgdig,"This is for the food truck on Sloan and Sahara on the east side. The one open Thursday - Sunday from 5-11pm. The one that has like three employees. The one that has THE BEST TACOS EVER. 

I've gone through taco phases. I used to like street taco combos that came with with three tacos and some rice and beans tortilla chips from places like Pepe's. Then I graduated to tacos el tizon where they melted cheese onto the tortilla as a taco base. Then I graduated to Tacos El Gordo street tacos that had adobada and tripas. Then I graduated to Los Tacos where a $4 filled to the max with everything taco was totally worth it. 

This taco truck is like a mix of all of them.

They serve tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. They have perfected the taco in my opinion. 

They take two medium sized tortillas an melt cheese between them. The bottom tortilla touching the grill makes them crip and crunch. They then fill it with the meat, onions, cilantro, beans, and salsa. Wrapped in some foil and it's the taco PERFECTED! The textures are just awesome. I suggest the carnitas- super flavorful OR the lengua or tongue tacos. 

Eat them there while the tortilla is crisp! Then you can add extra salsa and sour cream.

I've been here a handful of times and they get busy. Ive never waited long, but I totally would. I heard the owner used to work at Los Tacos and I'm a Los Tacos of Tacos El Gordo kind of guy so I love this place. Tax is included also.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,5,5,gcsJUfdT9J4xHfRPI_5P9g
4085275,2016-11-07,0,w1dxpzzh5I3oo2vaICgdig,"After going to the springs preserve. My family (my kids, my brother, sister in law, and my nieces) decided to get something quick on the way home. I suggested this place because I've had it a few times and it's been pretty decent and as well as the service. Tonight was really weird and just off. My sister in law ordered food came out to like 21 and some change she paid with 40. The lady at the register took awhile to give back the change. I seen her open up the register and lift it. No clue what she was doing. All of a sudden the guy in the taco truck decides to come out and he's on the phone saying he's calling the cops. Me and my sister in law looked at each other and we're very confused. He then tells us that one of the 20s is fake. He's was acting very weird and sketch. I understand at any establishment they can take any counterfeit money and keep it and call the cops. The lady at the register didn't even check the bill in our sight we had no clue what was going on. For all I know when she lifted her register she swapped out her fake with our real money. It just didn't make any sense to us. Last place my brother got change from was at the springs preserve. So nothing added up. We even called 311 a few times. But it just got so late for the kids. They waited a 2.5 hours no one showed up. These people even said they went to the liquor store right across the truck to check the bill. Which I feel like was total b.s. Just didn't understand this whole thing. They were really rude to us. She could have easily pointed out what was wrong with the bill and we would've went on with our night. We had plenty enough money to pay for the food. But man they made us feel like we were criminals just for a $20 bill. One thing I know for sure we will never come back here and for sure will spread the word of our experience. They deserve no stars for service. The food deserves 3.5 - 4. But my overall experience tonight they deserve 0stars. Not even 1.

When you ask for every you get guacamole beans pico de gallo and cheese. They half grill fry their tacos and it give it this crunch that is amazing. The quesadillas are so cheesy that you forget the tortilla and if you get it with everything....forgot about eating a taco unless you don't mind not driving anywhere for a minute. They only have three stools so best to get it to go or if you are only going with one or two friends. I have seen the bust out 20 tacos in about 5 minutes!!! So the service is pretty fast.
