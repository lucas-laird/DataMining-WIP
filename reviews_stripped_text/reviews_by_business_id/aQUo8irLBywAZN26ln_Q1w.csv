WildLV is not pretentious by any means. It has a feel like I'm a little different then your normal restaurant and your going to like eating here

It was lunch time and the place was busy (good sign) I got seated at what I call the chefs counter. I was reading over the menu and my waiter who was obviously the only one taking orders was very busy  Here is where the magic began 

A voice across the glass separating the counter from the kitchen asks me What looks good to you? I said to the chef Tatiana what do you recommend?

She asked if I liked spicy""love it"" and suggested  The spicy red pepper prosciutto pizza .It was great and healthy and it really was pretty big for an individual pizza. She asked me If I like carrot cake I said kinda She told me I would love hers.. I did. It was possible the freshest tasting carrot cake I ever tasted.

The menu is really diverse and caters to all tastes 
Its also in a hip location The ground floor of the Ogden ..Check it out!  

Say HI to Elyse the manager she's very personable and cares a great deal if the customers are having a great experience",Q8uTqwmv2XA2ojDyE9uNXw,0,1,5,bwHDD26B7IF7eruEVWxopg

Since she loves Pasta and Pizza we are always on the look out for places that serve these dishes without the gluten. The rating on Yelp made me very excited to take her there. What we found was a mixed bag which overall left us disappointed. 

The service was painfully slow, on a not busy night, and not terribly competent. We asked what were the roasted seasonal veggies. We got an answer explaining the concept; something we already knew. The waitress did not know which seasonal vegetables were included. We could see our appetizer waiting on the kitchen bar, whilst our waitress played with her phone.

The Bruschetta appetizer was excellent. The pizza not so much. The crust was below average for gluten free pizzas, which for a place specializing in such crusts is not acceptable. The flavor of the sauce was bland.

I cannot recommend this place.",KJ2PKrBdDDBdIUbvHNCn6Q,0,0,2,9P8Zyk-oZfDHBwvL6XUoMA

But we went with a basic pizza and a grilled chicken sand which. For starters we shared a square bowl of their tomato soup. Warning- the soup has a bite to it, so if you're a weenie like myself, be prepared. The pizza was good, nothing remarkable and the chicken sand which was terrific. Although it too had a bite to it , pleasantly surprising for my husband. We were seated next to the pastry display and after gazing at them for 45 minutes were forced to order. Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my! The Tres Leche cupcake was divine, probably the best gluten-free dessert I can remember having and I will be back for more. Why did I only give 4 stars?

This is the one place in town where gluten free is all they serve unless you specially order something with gluten that takes longer to make. Nice change of pace, and absolutely delicious food.

(located ground floor of the Ogden)

WILD has a friendly menu with many options to choose from for my vegan palate.

I can't wait to read the owners book, I took a sneek peak of the book and the forward (written by Tony Hsieh) and I found it super fun! This is her third resturant. 

The decor inside is a beautiful selection of upcycled items and the thought wall is super clever and inspiring. Make sure you add your thoughts, dreams, manifestations to it when visiting. 

I had a wonderful lunch with friends and my friend and I chose to get two plates then trade half/half.

This chilly day many of us ordered hot tea. We were brought our steaming glass mugs of water and then chose an organic beauty out of a box of selections. I chose a amazing chocolate coconut organic tea. 

The two lunches we chose were portobello steak burger with side kale salad and the second being tomato soup with grilled cheese.

The portobello steak was perfectly marinaded and not tough like they can sometimes ruin a beautiful port. The bun was nice and not over toasted or hurtful on the mouth. I'm not a fan of bread so to have a nice bun was refreshing. The kale salad was super yummy with a perfect blend of citrus dressing and the kale was massaged well. Yum. I would go back just for a large kale salad.

The grilled cheese on sourdough was divine. I normally do not like Daiya (pretty sure they use it) but the small amount that they used worked perfectly inside the fresh sourdough. I'm really impressed with the tomato soup. It was a special that day because my friend returned a few days later for it and she had to get butternut to dip (which she said was also divine). Creamy and warm it's been years since I took a dip in a bowl of tomato soup. It reminded me of my hometown when upon the first snowfall...it became soup season. 

We were sent out a special dessert and it consisted of a savory chocolate ganache filled cake with a side of rice milk ice cream.

I had the pleasure of meeting the GM and she is wonderful. The service was excellent and since we had a large table of guests I was very impressed on their timeliness. 

A perfect meal full of love, compassionate company, insightful management, and of course the strong vibe of Downtown inspiration.

1412179,2013-10-12,2,aQUo8irLBywAZN26ln_Q1w,"I am giving Wild 5 stars for their server Adam, who was awesome.  Friendly, funny, and he made the experience so much better!  

When we arrived we didn't know if we should just sit or wait for someone to seat us, but we claimed a long wooden picnic table in the center of the main dining room.  Adam came over and greeted us, told us the quote of the day, explained all of the gimmicks within Wild and took our beverage order. Pretty standard...

He sold me on a ginger lemonade which I loved, but could only drink so much of. I thought it was too strong to finish a whole glass of, especially now that the summer heat is gone. *insert sad face* 

My friend ordered a wild blueberry wheat ale / the Sea Dog. He said it was good, but it was served in a can which wasn't too impressive. I think they should have served it with a cold glass/mug. 

For dinner we ordered the bruschetta to start and then the salmon special they had + the perfect pasta.  We shared all of the items. I loved the perfect pasta. It was really flavorful, although when you first see it, the pasta looks quite plain and unimpressive.  The flavor definitely makes up for that. It's really good. 

The salmon was good, but nothing amazing. It had a lemon caper sauce and was served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed veggies.  It wasn't impressive in flavor, but I squeezed more lemon on it and it did the trick. 

The bruschetta was large and we didn't finish it all. The bread didn't taste any different than normal bread, although the entire menu at Wild is gluten-free. It was pretty impressive in that regard but other than that, what you'd expect of a bruschetta dish. 

As we wrapped up our dinner we asked for the dessert menu and Adam told us that there is no dessert menu yet. Bummer!!!!  We joked with him for a minute and asked if they could make something with the ingredients they already have. We were totally kidding but he went to chef and asked him to whip something up. This really boosted our experience as about 10 minutes later they brought out a gluten free pizza with butter, cinnamon and a home made whipped cream sauce.  Man!!!!  What service!!!  The dish needs some work as the gluten free pie crust overpowered the other flavors but they made that on the fly and it was pretty amazing that they took the time and not only considered it but executed!!!  We felt pretty special. The homemade whipped cream they made was REALLY REALLY good. 

Overall the experience was definitely enhanced by our server who was attentive, entertaining and just overall pretty awesome.  The menu is perfect for those who need to eat gluten free...it's not supposed to be culinary genius out of that kitchen, but more of an alternative dining experience for those who cannot have gluten in their diet. 

We will likely be back again to try more menu items + I'm excited to try their juices when the juice bar is open. We had a great time tonight, and at the end of it all, that's really what matters. :)",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,6,4,5,JnNIMEbswPfF6_98U13a_A

The Happy Hour pricing was good, but I'm not sure I'd be as happy with their regular prices. The house wine was actually drinkable, something I haven't found a lot of here. The food is good. Very high quality ingredients, and made well, although someone was a little heavy handed on the truffle oil on our flatbread pizza. The salads are wonderful. The service is great. The ambiance is okay...The kind of place you walk into and think ""this is nice"" and then don't give it another thought the rest of the evening. 

It's downtown, so know where to park before you go. Easy 1-block walk to several parking structures. 

Overall, a nice place to eat light and healthy, or get a nice glass of wine or a cocktail downtown, but nothing that will have you craving to come back, unless you're so gluten free that this is one of the few options in town.",O11n5wP5sq_NtxEGF6dwMA,2,0,3,8z2eSQZZQHAN1D5JDQtw_A

I've never thought a flatbread with Prosciutto, marinara and basil can go wrong like this. I won't waste my time describing in details but simply, it wasn't tasty. Also the pasta was not only too greasy but the pasta was overcooked.

2952738,2013-11-09,2,aQUo8irLBywAZN26ln_Q1w,"I really wanted to like Wild, but after 3 visits over the past month or so I just cannot commit to anything other than two stars.  On the surface I love the restaurant's decor.  Digging deeper into the service and food, both of which are what matters most, something just isn't right here.  All three times I've dined here I sat at the bar (as I often do) and while the service was decent and pleasant it almost seems as if they are winging it...of which I would not expect given that this is not their first venture into the restaurant and bar world.  One would think that service and processes would be better dialed in by the time you open your third establishment.

Case in point, on one of my visits I placed an order for an entree and was later told that the selection was ""sold out"".  After deciding upon something else I was later told that the initial dish was available to me, to the detriment of the person who had ordered it prior to me.  What!?!  While I do appreciate the offer, it seems odd that you would accept someones order, then take it away to give to someone else.  Maybe I seemed more important, maybe more needy; nevertheless it's an awkward position to be in, on both sides of the equation.

On to the food:  The menu, in my opinion, is quite limited.  You essentially have a few flatbreads and a few pasta dishes to choose from; all of which are seemingly gluten-free.  Here's the issue, the population that requires gluten-free is what? 1-5% depending upon which study you reference?  What I feel is happening is that the owner(s) are choosing to offer what they like/enjoy while sacrificing the wants of their larger demographic that could be dining at this location.  That's not a good business model and I feel that they need to change up the menu with more offerings or else shuttering the business will be immanent  I just don't see their targeted demographic supporting this venture in the long term.  The last meal I had was a pasta dish, the name escapes me; the pasta was very overcooked. While the ingredients seemed of high quality and flavorful it was ruined by the overcooked pasta.  If pasta is one of two dishes you offer, you ought to be able to prepare it properly.

The ambiance:  I like the way they decorated the place with levels, natural wood, steel and soft indirect lighting...that all fits my style.  What I disapprove of are arguably the most uncomfortable bar stools my posterior has ever been on.  Logic (and business acumen) dictates that the more comfortable a guest is, the longer they will stick around to eat and drink...well, that's just not in the cards with these chairs/stools.  My friend and I both work long hours and came in for a meal and a few beers/cocktails after closing up shop one evening.  Well, unfortunately that plan was overruled by the uncomfortableness we encountered.  We ended up eating our meals and were out the door immediately to find more comfortable accommodations to unwind at; that's a shame, both for us and your bottom line.

Other musings:  Low quality bar towels are not a sufficient substitute for a napkin.  First, low quality bar towels are very lint-ridden, second they are coarse, third they cheapen the experience.  Invest in proper napkins, both white and black...if you need to know why, close the doors now.  Bar towels are for the staff to clean with, not for your patron's lap and to wipe their face/hands with.

While the pasta didn't have a noticeable ""sauce"" it was well seasoned and the chicken was full of flavor.  I would have not guessed that it was gluten free.

I was hoping to try one of their smoothies or juices but the waiter said they were unavailable (on a Sat night??).  

The atmosphere is great, very hipster as you expect from downtown, with rough, wooden tables and neat light fixtures.  The floor to ceiling windows make it great for people watching as people walk from the El Cortez to the Gold Spike.

From the minute my takeout order was brought from the kitchen, I knew I was in for trouble. Here's a rundown of the eats...

Chicken Tikka Masala Pasta- $16 - Take away the creamy goodness of a masala sauce, take away any resemblance of chicken and imagine yourself eating dry, leftover spaghetti from a few days before. Voilá! You have made this dish in your mind. Tamest masala this side of Bombay. Nothing against the pasta itself, I'm not hating on the lack of gluten, I'm hating on the lack of chicken, sauce and flavor. 

Chana Masala Personal Pizza- $13 - Take a generic flatbread you can buy in Walgreens, add a box of frozen chana masala from TJ's (minus most of the flavor), a bit of tomato sauce and some mozz cheese, then cook in a toaster, but take it out a few minutes before it's ready. Voilá! You have again made a dish in your mind! Seriously, isn't this 'dough' the 'homemade specialty' of the house? When pizza is thin, isn't it supposed to be crunchy? Why does it taste like someone made this in Home Ec class... and got a C-? 

And yes, I ordered two Indian style dishes from an American/pizza place. But it's not a large menu. It's not like I was expecting fresh sushi from a diner. For the area, you can do way better with your money. 

While waiting for the food, I overheard some people wondering why the place is empty most of the time. 'It's this side of the street!' they said. No, friends. It's all of the above. 

Why 2-stars instead of 1? The place looks pretty slick. Would def have a brew at the bar.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,21,11,2,KkWQlFtSt7Z-P_r03OFOHg

WILD serves up locally grown/sourced completely gluten free fare. The server told us no gluten enters the place, which is good news for celiacs.

We arrived around 6 on Wednesday night. There was only one other party in the restaurant. There were people eating in the bar, too. We were immediately greeted by the bartender and some people sitting in the one comfy booth by the kitchen (women who had a laptop and appeared to be doing some paperwork. One of them asked how everything was as we were walking out, so I presume they worked here).

Now, my youngest, who is 8, was super cranky on the walk over, having been unable to nap. We were worried, but she had a nice time here and relaxed quite a bit.

I liked the decor: rustic wood meets industrial. Initially we were seated at the picnic table, but it was not comfy, so I asked if we could move to another table. (I like that table better too, said our server, leading me to wonder why he hadn't seated us there in the first place. Although he was super duper nice).

We ordered 3 pizzas. Local mozzarella with cherry tomatoes and basil, and the chicken tikka marsala. One pizza ($9) could be big enough for 2, but there were 4 people eating pizza, and we ended up eating all of it. My son ordered the wild mushroom pasta. I also got the ginger lemonade, which is made fresh (chunks of lemon and seeds to prove it!) and pleasantly sour ($4, no refills).

I really liked the gluten-free crust. It was more like a flatbread pizza, crunchy yet chewy. I loved the mozzarella and the cherry tomatoes were sweet, though I wished they'd been cut up and distributed more instead of plopping whole ones on top. The chicken tikka marsala was also good-- actually I could not discern any chicken at all and figured it was cut up into the marsala. 

The wild mushroom pasta consisted of a bowl of vegan spaghetti noodles broken into two-inch pieces, topped with lightly sauteed mushrooms and (vegan cheese?) and raw spinach. It had no sauce on it. I guess it didn't say it did in the description, either. It was bland. I thought it was a pretty pricey bowl of nothing for $14. He did not eat much of it.

We also got a plate of sauteed veggies for my kids to eat, since they hadn't eaten a proper veggie in a couple days. This was a generously sized platter of broccoli and red peppers and mushrooms.

We also got vegan cupcakes: the dulce de leche, chocolate with coffee frosting, and the spinach kale with avocado frosting (yes, you read that right). I liked the dulce de leche the best-- you could not tell it was vegan. I liked the coffee-tinged chocolate frosting because it cut the sweetness of the chocolate, though that one didn't taste non-vegan like the dulce de leche. The spinach kale was surprisingly good-- it tasted like a spice cake with a sour cream cheese frosting.

So, definitely stop here if you're in Vegas and need to have some gluten free food. The people in there are really nice, and nobody was smoking, and everything was clean. A good break from the hubbub.

Two suggestions for the place: tweak the pasta dish we had to be, well, tasty. And,let the customer have the one booth in the entire place that has padded seating (or just get comfier chairs).",eijfUFNF6flY-cY4Ff6BIA,3,2,4,758adR6N4oF8BCXLmMBX5w

As someone who's healed an auto-immune disease through diet,  I would not consider this establishment a wise choice for celiac patients or any other auto-immune disease.  Rather it is a refreshing watering hole for people who don't mind a tasty gluten-free bread replacement with their meal.

Would also be great if they had a non-dairy cheese option that does not contain msg or casein so that people with dairy allergies can enjoy their product.

I really like the vibe of the place and hope they modify their menu in a way that is more consistent with a gluten-free lifestyle.

Update:  The good news is that Wild has parted ways with Miki Agrawal and appointed Natalie Young to make the menu more interesting.  It may not be as health minded as originally intended, but at least all the ingredients won't be falling off the Sysco truck.",vJi2PxtLlRFDzTgYmf552Q,1,0,2,0bQaTezz5VCnFld-dWzhtA

I have no need to eat gluten free and I'll be the first person to say, hey, sometimes I eat Taco Bell, so obviously I am not a food purist. However - WILD lives up to expectations as to what it is and how its food should  taste - an all natural, pleasantly surprising experience awaits you.\

The menu boasts flat-bread pizzas for the most part, but I was not interested in those. Instead I opted for their delicious (not to mention picturesque) bruschetta. Topped with usual suspects of tomatoes (yellow and red), basil, mint, mozzarella, sunflower seeds, and a balsamic. All together presents a sweet and spiced-up medley of flavors.

I also enjoyed their tomato soup. I creamy-grainy rendition which packs quite a punch of flavor in every bite.

Lastly, I ended with a slice of apple pie, which I hate to say, was pretty dang bad. Very dry and flavorless. I suspect this may be from the gluten-free and less-sugary ingredients that went in the pie to make it natural and gluten free. It was really lacking that sumptuous apple-pie flavor and texture I am so used to.

Besides the dessert, my experience was great. Service was good and food, although on the pricey side, lives up to the standards the restaurant boasts.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,4,98sIpG7PkgGO3ivO8oeWgA

I think this place would be a welcome respite from Vegas's slow response to address a market with growing dietary sensitivities.  So, I can see why locals would like this place, but seriously, if you live in any other major city, this place would be on the bottom of your GF establishment lists.

Uncomfortable?  Yes.  Tables small, even for the audaciously meager portions?  Yes.  Poorly educated waiters who clearly haven't gotten familiar with different types of diets, allergies and the fact that these are the sole contributing factors to why anyone would come to this place?  A HUGE YES.  A place where you'll walk in hungry and walk out hungry?  Yup.  Overpriced, too.

Service was slow.  I waited 30 minutes for my server to come over.  After she complained about a huge party that was taking up her time, I looked around to see a room full of empty chairs.  When she was at our table (clearly indicating this ""inconvenienced"" attitude) she wasn't familiar with the ingredients on the dishes and had to run back to have long conversations with the chef.  Even TGIFrday employees know ingredients.  THIS IS A SPECIALTY RESTAURANT THAT CATERS TO PEOPLE WHO CARE A HELLUVA LOT ABOUT INGREDIENTS.  Servers need to meet an acceptable level of standards related to its clientele.

Sorry to hate on this place so much, but seriously, this is some full-of-itself amateur hour stuff.  The impractical (yet beautiful) interior design is not enough on it's own.  Just because you're the only game in town for the Zappos crowd doesn't mean you shouldn't step up your game at all.",UJAsDuKc4X99ukdK9X5Epw,5,3,1,T69MHVJYLx8_o7Q7hGsjfw

I am for the most part on a gluten free diet. I do cheat, but I have allergic reactions to it. 
I have a friend that is a vegan, so we wanted to accommodate her. They do have a pretty small menu to choose from. So, that was not a challenge in finding something to eat. The only thing that really caught my eye was the pizzas. 
Oddly enough, we went on a Sunday and this is prime time for Vegas and the brunch goers. Most places you try to go to for brunch in town are packed. This place was dead - I think there was only one other person in the restaurant. In order for this place to keep going, they must be kickin' some serious ass during the week or at night. It is in a corporate building and it's an odd location. 

I had the Spicy Prosciutto Pizza - 
To my surprise, it was very good. The sauce was excellent and it had a perfect amount of topping. The crust was okay, it is gluten free. Anything that is bread without gluten is usually disgusting. Like dried out spongy cardboard. But, I was surprised at how well they did with making it taste as normal as possible. 

I had tried some of the pastas that my friends got and they were okay. Very dry tasting, very bland and I could tell they were not happy because they barely ate any of it. 

Another plus, the mimosas were good! 
Also, the waitress was super nice and made sure we were taken care of well. The staff was friendly and the food and drinks came out very promptly! 


Not sure if I'll go back. If I do, it'll be because of another vegan or gluten free friend.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,5,3,3,MZ35f5jPZwYdAm0e1i35zQ

It has three locations, LV, the West Village and Williamsburg. Located in the basement of the Ogden in a very narrow but long space that spans what must have been three units, maybe 4, Wild hopes to attract healthy Zappos workers and Rachel's Kitchen hipsters.  A quick read of the menu and my first thought was, if I was gluten free or vegan, this place sounds good.

Ogden serves Brunch but we got there for the lunch menu. 
The menu has soup, salad, pasta, pizza and entrees with a lunch menu with a few sandwiches.  I decided to have tomato soup and an arugula salad with apple.

The Tomato soup was actually quite good.  Service was very quick and everyone was friendly.  The waitress had to give us the quote of the day from Lao Tzu and when we asked for another one, she was actually ready with more.  The salad was the problem.  While the ingredients were fresh and tasty by themselves, it was basically thrown together almost as an afterthought.  There was no dressing on the salad, offered to me, or even indicated that it was available.  This is ok, I thought, I don't like dressing on my sald and everyone thinks I am crazy, so victory for me!   However, I do like fresh pepper on the salad... not offered, hot sauce, parmeson, anything? not offered?  

Also, aside from the apples, there was nothing distinctive about the salad, just arugula walnuts, apple, and onion.   Very disappointing from a place that would scream salad if you asked me to guess what is good there.

The soup was definitively the saving grace. Also you can people watch as everyone walks down Ogden.
