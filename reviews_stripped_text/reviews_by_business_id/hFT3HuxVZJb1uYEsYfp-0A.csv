So it always was really annoying to try & relax when there were drunk girls being sloppy everywhere. However, I really liked this hookah lounge because people did just that: lounge & smoke hookah. The DJ was great & the customer service was awesome. they were really attentive & made sure our hookah was just right at all times. The manager, Nixon, was very charismatic & a joy to have had sit & smoke hookah with us. The hookah prices were typical ($15/hookah & $8/refill) but that's okay.

We all felt like she was taking advantage of us because it was our first time there and none of us were very experienced in ordering. Ordered something simple, but decided to branch out and try the pineapple after her persistence. She then kept pushing for upgrades with ""this is only 10 dollars more."" I politely declined and she kept going through the menu pushing for us to order juices and more and more things. I was really uncomfortable at this point. After ordering she said it's one of their rules that everyone has to buy a drink...in order for our safety so that everyone stays hydrated. ???? Soda and tea and the drinks they offered are DE-hydrating. We all looked at each other because at this point we really felt like we were being hustled and pressured. My friends wanted to leave. She could probably tell we were hesitating and offered ""even if it's only water."" We agreed, thinking we were getting glasses of water. She conveniently failed to inform us that the waters we got were child size water bottles at $2.50 each. Four people and one hookah ended up costing $70. I've been to hookah lounges before and I have a hard time believing it's this expensive everywhere else. Table next to us were very into hookah and told us the tobacco at this location was not the best, but the pineapple makes it smoother. Told the watermelon was a waste of money though. Nice environment, cool interior. Music choice was interesting...seemed to be some kind of 80's R&B. For the price, would've thought the booths had been nicer.

It causes you to lounge on the pillows and it can make you tired combined with the dark lighting and soothing music. 
There is no food served here, so if you are hungry eat before you arrive.

The hookah was delicious. We had mango strawberry mint with a pineapple bowl. We were told it was the special but it cost us $40. We were s bit surprised at the end, but since I'm not an avid hookah smoker I am unaware the going rate. Haha. Seems a bit steep to me. Also, 2 people are included in the hookah charge but you will be charged $5 for any additional person smoking. The tobacco lasted for about 2 hours! I'm sure we didn't even exhaust the bowl when we left.

Update: the owner has let me know that the type of hookah we received was meant for more tobacco and they are currently renovating to fix the low seating/high tables situation.

Not sure if he owns the place, but he's definitely an asset to this place. I smoked ""blue gummy bear"" first and was pleasantly surprised. Most candy flavors are cloyingly sweet. Not this, this was like better balanced version of blue mist in the best way possible. After that I refilled with lemon pound cake on a complete whim. Asked Mark what it really tasted like as some lemon flavors can taste like soap. He legit said ""have you ever had the iced lemon cake from (that one Seattle based coffee chain?) It tastes just like that."" He wasn't lying. I smoked my dessert... The entire experience was awesome and by a MILE the best hookah experience I've had. Oh yeah, did I mention they have Thai Tea?

I was a regular at Azuza 1 for years and loved the place. Now that its Blaqcat, I am not disappointed at all. New management changed up the interior to maximize space. Several booths line each side, black lights are everywhere and a few tvs on each wall. 

What really makes Blaqcat one of the better lounges in town is their prices and quality. The happy hour is awesome: $10 for a bowl. This includes all of their flavors: Starbuzz, Al Fakher, and Fumari. At these prices, the hookahs are a great deal. Let your server recommend a bowl, they haven't done me wrong. Service is awesome, they come around regularly with fresh coals and keep the hookah smoking well. Blaqcat also features a pretty good list of teas and drinks, my personal fave: Peach Fuzz. 

Overall Blaqcat is great experience and I'll definitely be back.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,5,1,5,are2frmPd5I-rdu_H9w60w

They come by often enough to check your coals, but usually just leave you alone.  During the week it is super chill, but I went on a weekend one time and the music was so loud (and terrible) you couldn't hear the person sitting next to you even if you were screaming.  I'm not sure if that was a special event, or something they do every weekend.  The atmosphere is very nice, but the benches on many of the booths are so high that you feel more like you are waiting for the bus, than hanging out smoking hookah.  Last time I was there, I asked to move to another booth with lower seats, and they told us it was reserved.  We were in there 2+ hours and there was only one other booth occupied the entire time so I'm not sure what they were waiting for.  The tea selection is great, but I feel like they've changed the recipes a bit.  The ""Buried Treasure"" iced tea used to be my favorite, but the last few times I ordered it, it tasted like they dumped in a ton of strawberry syrup instead of using fresh berries the way they used to.  All in all, its not a bad place to hang out sometimes, but its not usually my first pick.",2evZH-p6dVNqyB0V-wYT7Q,2,0,3,9twRMhpSwY1F03efU09SNg

It has a relaxing atmosphere with music and TV playing pictures of customers. I brought my motorcycle that day and they really liked it and allowed me to park it pretty stylish by the entrance and the owner asked to take pictures with it. I felt flattered but this is not the reason for the 5 stars. The bowl was made tailored the way I asked for it which was a pineapple bowl for like 30 dollars but it lasted over 2 hours I usually finish the bowls and leave but I'm almost certain after two hours it still had more hookah. I had to work so unfortunately I couldn't finish it. The employees would change the coals and move them every 5-10 minutes it seems they always made sure I was taken care of.

The hookahs are always on point never harsh and great hits, the guys are always coming around and clearing and replacing the coals.

The price is amazing, we always go on happy hour, the prices are reasonable and they give not only give yelp discount and Military discount!!!

The teas there are amazing love it!! No complaints there.

It never got harsh and the flavor remained the entire time we were there. The staff was great at helping us too. We were three woman who don't know much about hookah and they kept changing the coals and ashing  them for us. Super attentive. 

We also ordered tea! We were in heaven the tea was delicious and so fancy with the pretty tea cups and sugar, honey and mint leaves. Super nice. Highly recommend the jasmine pearl. 

The hookah lounge closes at 2am but they don't kick you out. They have you settle your bill and let you leave when you are ready. I LOVED that!

I always come here for the tea because I love hookah & tea . I got the vanilla truffle tea and we got two hookahs- sex on the beach & strawberry daiquiri . They were fairly busy for a friday night but not slammed. The hookah took a little bit to come out but the service was great! Both employees were very apologetic about the wait which was no problem because we were just chatting and sipping on our drinks. 

When my hot tea came out I asked if they had honey, but they said they were out. Bummed, I decided to go to the Wal-Mart next door to get some (im picky - I know). I asked if it was okay if I brought some in and the same guy (assuming a manager or something) insisted he would get me some. He left the store, came back with some, and put in the little dish for me. AMAZING service . He went so ABOVE & BEYOND it was great .
