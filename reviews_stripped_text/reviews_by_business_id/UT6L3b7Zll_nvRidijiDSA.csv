Drinks were fine, but overpriced even for a Las Vegas strip resort ($15 draft beer) and the food just wasn't good. Had a few small plates, most notable the meatballs tasted odd...not recommended.

Do yourself a favor and get the truffle pizza without the potatoes, and have them add on some of their jalapenos. They get the jalapenos fresh and pickle them. They complement the richness of the pizza quite well. Don't forget to start with their chicken wings accompanied by their homemade bleu cheese dressing. Also, the Five50 chopped salad is a must. Its like antipasti meets salad in a bowl and throws a party. It has so many textures and flavors, and the vinaigrette on the salad keeps you salivating for more. Do yourself another favor and wash it down with a pint or two of their seasonal Citradelic Tangerine IPA made by New Belgium that they have on draft.It is quite evident with even just a small sampling of their food that this is a chef driven restaurant with solid grub and a beer selection to top it off.",DbApWbSx-SECCGAHNshVBg,0,0,5,cToWcXg6HtwVXc8l5RmU1g

Service was terrible. Server did not come around for about 10 minutes. When we ordered our food, we then waited for 30 minutes before asking to see our server.

This pizza place is superb and by Vegas casino standards, inexpensive. Massive slices of delicious pizza at $5.50 a slice or you can order  lunch or dinner pizza/pasta/salads etc. Located in the Aria hotel on the casino level between the poker room and sports book it gets really busy so try and go at off times. The service is also fantastic as they go out of their way to accommodate any and all special requests. Although  the pasta and meatball entr√©e is  incredibly enticing, in the end I personally love the five cheese pizza (it's a little greasy, but every great pizza has to have some grease). Clearly the high quality of all the ingredients coupled with the proper care in preparing their menu makes the difference. Turns out Five50 is operated by well know chef Shawn McClain (Sage restaurant among others), who I had the pleasure of meeting when he was actually working behind the bar in the restaurant one night. Nice guy, but more importantly- great pizza! Here is a tip: their desserts are also incredible, in fact on my bday they treated me to this delicious milk shake type creation  -fantastic!

This place does nothing cheap or low-end.  Every ingredient is carefully picked and often of the organic/sustainable variety.  The dishes are carefully thought-out, and pay close attention to flavor profiles and presentation.  The meat and cheese plate was fantastic, the polenta is an absolute must here, and the clams were just great.  Way better than expected beer and wine list too.  The servers know their stuff.  Foodies will love it here.  The price is right for what you get, which is a nice surprise too, considering I expected more of a Strip mark-up.

First, we were served breadsticks and Artisan Sparkling Water.

Then I enjoyed the excellent appetizers and salads. The Grilled Garlic Sausage with white beans and fennel salad was my favorite and I also enjoyed the Arugula & Fennel salad. The Tomato Salad and Pork Porchetta were enjoyable too. Note: There were 3 adults a toddler and infant in our party, so we shared the tastes.

Our server, John, was professional, courteous and attended to our needs.
I told him a type of beer I liked and I asked what he recommended. He said a Ballast Point on tap - smooth.

We ordered two pizzas, a Truffle Pizza (more than mushrooms) and a Margherita Pizza topped with basil (my favorite of the two). The pizza was not greasy like some fast food delivery places. It was crisp and fine.

Having something sweet to go with your pizza is a must.  I shared a Fried Zeppole with powdered lemon sugar and limoncello sabayon, and also the Milk-Chocolate-Lavender Custard dessert.

The architecture was fascinating: the cylindrical features, variety of materials, and choice of artwork. In different areas, you have black and white tiles, a dark wood, a long chalkboard (possibly 2) with menu items and drinks listed, light wood, a mesh of wood or metal.

We spent just under 90 minutes there. The All-Star Game was on the TV, but the TV wasn't ""in your face"" or the main focus of the restaurant. 

After paying the bill, and was getting up, I asked our server about the different types of seating, just because I wanted to know.  There is a private table for a group of about 10, some booths like the one we sat in, table seating from semi-private to what I would call ""center of attention"", and bar seating which is well spaced.  As we were leaving, I saw the counter area and the ovens set at Five50 that's [550 degrees Fahrenheit].  I saw Shawn McClain and it was good to talk to him for a few seconds.

There were 4 pizza choices but they seem to fly off the pan with everyone in line.  I had a slice of the forager pizza and 4 cheese.  Both slices were great tasting and the thin crust was nice and crispy.  It motivates me to try the full restaurant the next time I came.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the lack of choices at the quick service counter...it didn't look like they could make enough pizza's to keep up with the walk-ups so it was a downer not being able to get what you want...instead..settling for what was there at the time.",WmXouMxdpbiXen4H-PCMUg,1,1,4,Hj3Jg7wbNycPEPa8p2MU1g

I always judge a restaurant by customer service first then the food. The customer service was spot on the evening we were there. We had no wait, our order was taken quickly, drinks arrived in a timely manner, as did the food. The server, Sam, was very  friendly and courteous.

We had a basic pizza with onions and bacon. It came with full on slices of bacon and chunks of onion. No cutting back which made the price more than worth it.  It was hot, cheesy, and messy just like you'd expect a great pizza to be.

I'm not sure how to judge the cost. Yes it was expensive but it's Vegas and it's the Aria. What do you expect? As long as the customer service and food are above par then I'm fine with cost.

I wasn't expecting any different of Vegas, but upon a casino shop worker's recommendation we tried Five50 for a slice and a beer one night. We sidled on up to the bar for a late night snack. I had the forager, a white sauce, mushroom, spinach and ricotta concoction, while the wife had the simple five cheese.

Wow, good pizza. Really good pizza. No, seriously, really good pizza. So good, we came back the next night and ordered a whole cheese with whipped ricotta and wood oven fired tomatoes. Even better. Really an eclectic take on a classic east coast pizza, done wood oven style with crispy crust. They also had a good selection of pricey but tasty tap beers. 

Put aside for a minute that its rather expensive for pizza , a single pie is $25 to $30, and beers run $8-$9 cocktails $14, then again everything in Vegas seems to be pricey these days, this was easily the best pie I have had in LV to date. Cost knocks it down from 5 stars, and service was spotty at times, but certainly not terrible.

Instead of just getting a slice, we decided to sit and eat.  Well, while it was ok, it wasn't the best compared to other places we ate.  First things came slowly and service was only ok.  We split a basic pizza, mushroom and peperoni; the flavor was great but the large slices and semi dried (over cooked maybe) peperoni cut the roof and other areas of my mouth.  I should have cut my slices but the dough was too tough and cutting was not an option unless I asked for a steak knife as I had already tried to cut the ends and gave up.

The pizzas here are priced in the high 20s and it is a 16 inch pizza which will definitely fill up 2 people with 3 large slices each. Getting one slice is not an option unless you take it to go. Note there are a few standing tables right outside for this purpose so if you don't want a sit down dinner, do that instead! Place is very cute, host staff was okay, waiter was so great (thanks  Wissam -shaved hair with goatee) now to the food. Got one pizza to share half Forager and half Truffle. Got the Forager with Mortadella instead of bacon and it was the most delicious thing ever! So juicy and yummy and so many mushrooms and the mortadella gave it a fresh kick and I'm in love! The truffle was a bit of a disappointment it was kind of dry didn't have many truffles and barely had any sauce all cheese. Another big issue I had... there was way too much oil/grease on both the pizzas. I soaked out the grease with four napkins and my hands were still drenched.

Oh, really now? We then see the original girl who was supposed to seat us walk by, and asked her why we were being told there was a 45 minute wait when she already told us she would be seating us. To our complete shock, her response was ""I spoke to you guys before???"" Yes, she had spoken to us less than 10 minutes ago, and claimed to have no recollection of it. Her lame excuse was the restaurant being new and busy. It was not THAT busy; only one other table had arrived in the entire time we were waiting around. Regardless, you as a hostess would know that there is a 45 minute wait and have a responsibility to inform the customer of that. Not only had she wasted our time as we did not have 45 minutes to wait around to eat, she embarrassed us by making it seem as though we were not important enough for her to remember having met a few minutes prior. After explaining this to her, loudly enough for the entire staff to hear, all we got was a babbled apology from her and an offer to point us in the direction of another restaurant.

Anyway, all I can say is that this place is GREAT.  Now, we like a good straightforward cheese pizza, not all the bells and whistles, and theirs was honestly the best pizza either of us have had pretty much anywhere.  No lie.  This comes mostly from the crust which, on our pizza, was perfect.  Crisp on the bottom, yet still chewy, plenty of those great dough bubbles (you know what I'm talking about!), and really flavorful.  The sauce was delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet.  And the cheese was also perfectly flavorful, not super stringy like you get on a gimmicky cheap pizza, and not totally greasy like...well, like on Secret Pizza, a total grease bomb if you ask me.

We had salads, too, and my beet salad was great.  Something special, if you want to splurge (which we did).  

The atmosphere was pleasant, no blasting music like you get in some Vegas restaurants now, and there were games going over the bar so it felt comfortable and casual.  The service, in our case, was prompt and pleasant.

I see a lot of people complaining and criticizing on here about the $5.50 cost of a slice of Pizza and it's size. This isn't Domino's folks or little Caesars. It's an upscale pizza place by a well known experienced higher tier chef and the food shows!

We dined at Five 50 over the weekend and thought it was awesome. We weren't sure what a pizza place would be like coming from a chef of Shawn McClain's caliber but we weren't disappointed in the least. It was even nice seeing him there expediting all the dishes and adding the finishing touches!

Our server John expertly guided us first through the drink menu and then through the food. We ordered everything he suggested and couldn't have been more pleased. The truffle pizza was to die for. Yes it was pricey, but you are paying for high end ingredients and it shows. The pork belly Carpaccio was equally as impressive.

If you want a down and dirty cheap slice of pizza that's as big as your head and mediocre in taste this isn't the place. If you  want to enjoy a good slice of pizza or other dishes, made with high end, fresh ingredients...

It was WAY overpriced and not worth it at all - the slices are TINY - and I mean TiNY (think of what a slice of quiche looks like) and true to the name of the place, each mini slice is $5.50!!! Two slices for $11.00 do not even equal one normal regular slice anywhere else. Last night all they had left was Margherita pizza (I was told it was a 40 minute wait if I wanted another kind!!!) so that is what I tried - it was just ok, certainly not worth $5.50.  

For slightly more than the cost of two of these ridiculous slices, you can get an entire pie at Wolfgang Puck right next door at Crystals (yes, even to go, and without an insane 40 minute wait) and Wolfgang Margherita pizza blows the $5.50 slice right out of the water.

By the way, I am a native New Yorker and I know good pizza - while this pizza certainly isn't bad, I have had way better.

The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call.

We stayed at the Vdara and because there's not much food option at Vdara, decided to order pizzas for carry-out.  Went for the Gotham, which is sorta like a meat-lovers with a spicy kick, and the North Beach, which is a pizza with clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano.  

Gotham's tasty, just as expected, especially if you're a fan of pepperoni and/or salami.  The North Beach was sort of a gamble since we wanted to try something different and man, we lost.  We expected a pizza with clams sprinkled onto the pizza, but what you get is actually one clam in the shell per slice.  Yup, 8 slices, 8 clams.  After you eat the one clam, it's just a cheese pizza essentially.  The smoked mozz and sweet onions was very tasty though.

We also ordered an order of wings after the girl on the phone said it was very delicious, and she was right, it was very tasty!  Not really a buffalo sauce, but it does have a slight kick and sweetness to it.  We were quite glad we were convinced to order it haha.

Now, for the price, each pizza is close to $30 (why we also thought there would be more clams), and for some reason the wings aren't on the online menu when we ordered so we didn't know, but our bill was $90+ with two cokes after taxes.  We knew Vegas was expensive but man, $90+ for pizza and wings was sorta crazy.  

They sell by the slice as well, but I think I'd rather walk a little more to Cosmo and eat Secret Pizza next time.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,2,2,3,yT5Ss8p2yKzu6ghQVN_O6A

I rarely go into CC due to it being so difficult getting in to, but meeting my friend was totally worth it. I came in on a Friday, during a very stormy monsoon out on the Strip, As soon as I showed up Valet had to be closed due to the lightning and heavy rain. then I went into the self parking. The walk is a little long getting in there, but the food made-up for the long walk.

Now to the food, I was impressed with this upscale pizza place! It had a fun vibe, and the decor was very nice. I tried the polenta with egg! YUMZ!

For a salad we shared a beet, peach, frisee and hazelnut composition. Beets and peaches! Can't go wrong!

My favorite was a bread with cheese and garlic sauce! I ate like 3 pieces! Carb overload right? 

The pizza was amazing, I believe it was the Gotham. Pepporoni and sausage. I absolutely loved the crust. It was chewy and crunchy at the same time, and you can just tell there's something different in the water they use. It couldn't have been Vegas water. We don't have crust that good with the water from the faucets in town. Idk what the secret is, but I loved it.

For dessert we shared an ice cream sandwich and chocolate custard w lavender. The custard was yumz! Got thicker the further down you went:)  Not too impressed w the sandwich.

The very decently sized (I'd call it a ""large"") Pepperoni Pizza was extremely oily and slightly too wet underneath, but was decent tasting.  The Meatballs were small and ridiculously overpriced for only getting three tiny ones and a few tiny plain crostini pieces that desperately needed a drizzle of olive oil.  Tiny portions at high prices were also seen with the admittedly yummy garlic cheese bread that was basically four half slices of an Italian loaf.  It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.

Refills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.

The ""Gotham"" tasted good, the crust was soggy.

The ""Forager"" tasted good, The cust was not as soggy as the following nightmarish Pizza but far from crisp.

The ""North Beach"" just was horrid. Clams were in the shell and just baked on top of the pizza? What did we miss here? Why include clams if the pizza could not absorb the flavor of the seafood? The Crust was a MESS! The Clam liquid obviously bubbled onto the pizza and just soaked the pizza. This was a complete FAIL!

The wings were meh, ok in a chain restaurant type of place.

After going the first time, I wasn't impressed. It wasn't bad or anything but it def wasn't memorable. We ordered the Gotham pizza which comes with pepperoni, sausage and salami. It was a little too much for me. 

During the most recent Restaurant Week, I noticed they had a good lunch deal so my friend and I decided to give it another try. After we got there and saw what was including in the deal, it seemed like a better idea to just order what we wanted. It probably came out to the same price and it was good we wanted to eat.

The garlic knots were decent. Nothing to rave about. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven, at 550 degrees. :) This time we ordered cheese and pepperoni. It wasn't bad but like I said, its not my favorite or that memorable. The service wasn't great. It took a while for drink refills and they weren't even that busy.

We ordered WAY too much food for out table. In total we ordered 4 whole pizzas (Gotham x2, North Beach, Farmstead, Forager,) . We should've asked our server to see if she'd think 4 was too much T.T We ate about 3/5 of all the pizzas we ordered. Had more than enough for breakfast tomorrow.

The Gotham was your typical meat lover's pizza. We all finished that first and pretty quickly also. You can never go wrong with meat over's pizza if you fancy protein and red meat.

The North Beach was really good. I wish I had more, but I was trying to avoid seafood thise weekend (allergies) The clan they put on top of each slice was bomb. Really isolated from the whole pizza itself so you can really taste it.

The Farmstead was my most disliked pizza. It had so many flavors going off at one time, but the salty flavor dominated everything. It was very distasteful to me. Of our 8 only 1 of us didn't mind it much. As you can guess, we had this the most of our leftovers. I tasted okay after being intoxicated, still tasted that salty sour taste though.

The Forager... I can't really remember this pizza well. I really liked the Gotham and North Beach, and the Farmstead ruined my appetite a bit. This wasn't that bad though. We barely had any left for this, probably like 1 or 2 slices. I do remember the yolk though. I tasted awkward at first, but then it tastes good afterwards.

I probably will not come here again though, just because there are so many restaurants in Vegas that i have tried before and this played didn't really 'wow' me. Probably because of that Farmstead... lol. Service was great. Watched a baseball game while waiting for our food. Lost a Parley. Ate some good pizzas, ate A bad pizza.

We ordered the Gotham pizza to share, which was, as we Italians say, ""mezza-mezza"". It tasted great, fresh meat toppings and perfectly cheesed, but the crust was not consistent in thickness. Some slices were evenly thin-crusted from the center to the edges, and some were thick at the edges (the way I'm used to being from NY) but so paper thin at the middle that the toppings and oil soaked through and it all fell apart.

I'm by no means cheap, and I certainly understand ""strip pricing"" in Vegas, especially since I work in the same hotel that this place resides, but the pizza carried a $28 price tag for 6 slices, plus $4.50 each for a 6"" tall x 2"" diameter glass of iced tea that was almost  1/2 full of crushed ice, and I can't help but feel that I could have put that $40 to better use elsewhere for lunch. Also a disappointment (which won't apply to most people but I'll mention it anyway) was the fact that they don't honor any sort of employee discount, making this the first place I've personally been to in the MGM lineup that has stiffed me on my employee ID. Boo for that. All things considered I'd give the experience a 6/10, and I think this will likely be my last time there.",w5p02wAC5NXh0iwV2zHvSQ,1,0,3,J9cNzVec9UKr770x_OX89g

1876558,2015-03-04,1,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"For those of you who have been to aria, you know it's a rather upscale ritzy place. Not really the type of place you'd imagine a pizza by the slice bar, right? Enter Five50....a sit down Italian restaurant serving artisan specialty pizza as well as the typical overpriced dishes and a huge selection of craft beer. Sit down with a group and expect your tab to be in the high hundreds. 

Then, aria decided to try to be like the cosmo (in my opinion) and added the ""to go"" line that sells slices of pizza. (no, you cannot get a single slice when you sit down inside) there are 3 or 4 types to choose from... Cheese, a meat slice, a veggie slice, and a rotating seasonal slice. I've had all of them. I find the pizza here to be very artisinal, If that makes sense. The crust is more of the wood fire baked pizza or stone fired pizza etc. It's chewy and yeasty and quite good, especially if you're into that type of thing.

All slices are just under $6 with tax and all of them are good. The tomato sauce is A1...i was thinking in my head that the pizza was a 3/5 but then the sauce really just pushes it to a 4..its probably the best pizza sauce ive had. Not overly sweet, with a nice zest to it and it complements the crust perfectly. 

The overall atmosphere here is kind of weird.. Like I can't walk up and get a slice and feel normal walking through the casino with this pizza. It's right next to the sports bar and right across from the high limit slots...strange. However, I think aria did a nice job of trying to combine their atmosphere with a place for guests to get drunk quick food without leaving their property.

The server we did have was extremely slow at everything from taking our order to bringing out our drinks and refilling our water, and then finally taking forever to bring our bill.

There were four of us, and we each had ceaser salads, and determined that we'd share the truffle and margherita pizzas.  The salads were great, no complaints there, as was the margherita pizza.  The truffle pizza was completely overwhelming, and I think it has put me off truffles for a little while!  Too much truffle!!

Ultimately, looking back on how much time we spent debating over which pizzas to choose, I think some of the choices were a little too ""out there"" and there seemed to be something on each one of them that one of our group couldn't handle.

Definitely wouldn't return to Five50, considering all of the other choices for food in Vegas.  To get more stars in Vegas I have to leave feeling not only satisfied, but like I'd return for another meal.",VvJzTulR17HDj7PDyc789g,3,2,3,wOoRhDHPz4ke6jyui99WwQ

Unfortunately, quality is usually on par with your local mall food court. 

Five50 is different. Not only is it easy to find within the casino (straight through the lobby on the left from the parking garage), but it's priced cheap ($5.50 a slice including specialty styles) but doesn't taste like it. On any given day, there are four featured pies available by the slice: the Gotham (meat heavy), Forager (cheese and mushrooms), a cheese-only version, and a featured daily special. 

if by the slice isn't for you, they also offer an extended menu of whole pies, along with salads, sandwiches, shakes, and small plates. But their pizza is obviously the highlight.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,0,3,ugOxl_yNcJr-gVLNdQnCAg

1991272,2017-01-10,5,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"I liked Five50 Pizza Bar. So much, in fact, that I ended up coming twice in the course of one night at the Aria. It was an easy, comfortable spot for dinner as well as for drinks and dessert after some time on the casino floor. The only problem with Five50 Pizza Bar was that the pizza was no good.

We came for an early Sunday dinner after driving in from LA with no particular plans. We were thinking about leaving the Aria, which is where we were staying, but inertia got the best of us when we stumbled across a pizza place right by the sports betting station. It was only 5:30, but we were hungry after our time on the road, and the restaurant was beautifully empty.

I liked the vibe of the place. Very much of one piece with the Aria, ritzy and modern with high ceilings and interesting decor, but casual and fuss-free. There was a large bar that ended up being half the point of the place, and service was solid. We ended up coming back with a couple more friends when we needed a place to catch up later in the night. We brought our leftover pizza for them to eat, and our server didn't call us out for having the take-out box on the table.

That pizza, though, was some of the worst I've had in a while--no contest when measured against others in its price range. These were expensive personal pies, and they just didn't taste good. They were flawed on a basic level, limp and greasy with way too much cheese. The toppings were good, at least. The Catania came with white sauce, garlic pur√©e, Italian sausage, rapini, and roasted tomato; the Forager with white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. Pretty good ideas, but not enough to redeem the pizzas.

Weirdly, everything else was great. The beet salad was excellent, a colorful mix of local beets with watercress, farro, pumpkinseed vinaigrette, and grissini. One of my friends doesn't like burrata, so we got it with goat cheese--accommodating kitchen, and a nice substitution. When we came back after dinner, I had some kind of craft beer on tap (I forget which, but it was a good one), and partook in a couple of decadent milkshakes. The Vegas root beer float was a satisfying shake loaded with vanilla ice cream, caramel, Butterfinger crumbles, and Boylan's root beer. The mint chocolate swirl mixed mint ice cream with chocolate syrup and chocolate mint cookies--what's not to like there? All shakes were available in adult iterations, but the beer was good enough for me.

I enjoyed Five50 Pizza Bar despite its failure to deliver good pizza. I'd recommend it for an easy drink or meal if you're hanging out at the Aria. I wouldn't hesitate to go back; I just might avoid the signature offerings.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,7,6,3,vDO62Rm8YAXX_gIWdCBmzA

Sure yes they all want to make ""real"" pizza but through all of this a lot of the fancier places have sort of lost the plot a little bit. 

In the land where a $30 pizza serves one and has exactly five pieces of mushroom and a thin veil of cheese, 550 is a nice refreshing fun place to visit. The ambience is youthful and cheerful and the menu is quite creative with solid 16 inch pizza's being the focus. Our server was one of the coolest guys we met, super casual and friendly yet very attentive. 

The Catania pizza was really good. It had chewy tasty cheese on a really well cooked non-greasy crust and perfectly cooked toppings. We had left overs we took back to the room and tried the following day and it still tasted just as good, goes to show the quality.

But then there is more. You have got to try the Floats here, especially spiked! The Creamsicle  float was simply stunning with Absolut Mandarin, and the most memorable drink we had in Vegas. Will be back for more for sure!",1y24ataICzIEMLOJdA8R8Q,0,0,5,v7xhs-GdpFqnlk_FL3vG0A

1. I should say ""greats""!  For someone who says pizza is one of my favorite foods, this is my hands down favorite pizza of all time!  One word GOTHAM.  I always get this pizza and I prob will always get this pizza.

The sauce is tangy spicy and very mildly sweet.  Combinations of the toppings just put it over the top!  I can't stop eating slice after slice

1. Gotham for one
2. Also try the buffalo wings, they come on a wood block and taste amazing!  Even though it isn't BWs, I honestly would say they taste better.  more meat on the bone, and tender with a slightly spicy BBQ sauce.  
3. Arancini: also better than some Italian joints, ironically.

I ordered the Gotham which consist of mozzarella cheese, grana padano and meats (sausage, salami and of course, pepperoni). The slice is pretty decent sized and thin in height but there was more than enough toppings for it. Unfortunately, it was sooo oily, too oily. I folded my slice to take a bite and quickly, drops of meat oil dripped down. I get it, it's the toppings fault for all that oiliness but that didn't make me want to get another one of those slices.

First, stay basic here. Work from the Margarita base and add pepperoni. Or build your own with cheese, pepperoni, and basil. I'd go with half the amount of cheese, by the way.

The crust is outstanding but I do not like that the cheese oil soaks through it so quickly. That's why I recommend that you go with half the cheese. It still tastes great but it preserves the crust. The crust, by the way, is very good. 

The five50 chopped salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. 

The desserts were disappointing. The ice cream sandwiches had potential but the ice cream simply has too much air stirred into it. It's not premium ice cream. A few other desserts were simply not noteworthy. I'd really avoid the desserts. Make your way over to the Aria and grab dessert from Jean Philippe Patisserie. Cannot lose there.

I even took my family to Naples's, Italy  this June to eat the best pizza in the world which by the way turned out to be the worst pizza we've ever had and the worst part of our trip. Anyway I've been staying at the Aria for several years now. So when they added a pizza place I was over joyed and hoping it would be good. The restaurant it self is very lively and well decorated. The wood fired ovens make a great back drop as you walk in. We were seated right away since it wasn't that busy yet. We ordered a Pepperoni pizza and Coke's. Yes Coke in Vegas again at a place that is dominated by Pepsi. That was one of our favorite things about this place. But the  pizza was seriously one of the best pizzas i had ever eaten. I only wish I hadn't eaten pizza the 3 days before so I could've went back again before we had to leave Vegas. Our waitress was also very good at her job. I can't wait to eat here again the next time I'm at the Aria. Like most of the places at the Aria it's not cheap but worth every cent. One large pizza easily fed my family of four.

If you're in Aria and like pizza, this is a great joint to hit up with a group and share a 16"" pizza. You can get it half-and-half to appease picky eaters :)

The North Beach is yummy (I love seafood haha)! Clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, oregano. I don't think I've had a seafood pizza before this. The other half was the Picante -- ghost chili salami, shishito, calabrian chili, roasted sweet peppers. It was a bit too spicy for me, but it was really good too; I had to unwillingly hand over the other half of my slice to my friend. $28 + tip and tax for the full pizza isn't bad since the pizza feeds 4 people. Don't forget to grab a spiked shake! I ordered the Las Vegas Root Beer Float (vanilla ice cream, caramel Butterfinger crumbles, Boylan's root beer) -- it's kinda pricey at $9 + $6 for the Jagermeister, but hey, it's Vegas. I enjoyed my boozy lunch :) 

This past trip, my friends and I just wanted a snack, so we took a look at the to-go display case. There are fewer options to choose from when you're getting a slice to-go, but oh well. Since it was the week of Thanksgiving, they had a turkey confit pizza! It was quite an interesting pizza -- turkey and cranberries with a white sauce. 

Props to the executive chef, Shawn Mcclain. Oh yeah, the bonus? He was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Best New Restaurant award for his new restaurant Spring, at the time.",_iSS1m_QBY9E1f1xOZovlg,2,0,4,60fHqDSMR1l3kBv5a9YE_w

Reasons for the 4 star rating:
Problem is though that if you grab a slice there's really no where to sit. Unless u order a whole a box at the bar.

My best friend and I wanted to grab a small bite and beer at Aria.  We decided upon Five50.  For starters, it took a solid 10 minutes just to seat us.  I figured the place was packed, but once we entered the dining area, over half the tables were empty.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly hungover from Saturday night escapades, and was particularly thirsty.  It took a SOLID 15 minutes (yes, I looked at my clock) for any server to even acknowledge us! Once we were finally acknowledged, it took another 5 minutes to bring over a carafe of water.
I understand that there seemed to only be 3 servers...but again, the place was not that crowded.  The servers weren't in much of a rush either. 
The food itself was very, very good, as was its presentation.  I got the mac & cheese and my friend got the wings.  If I were rating Five50 solely based on food, I'd give it 4 stars.  The service definitely merits no more than 2 stars though.  While our waitress was friendly, the lack of attention and length of time it took to get our water, food, or really to ask for anything additional that we needed was just way beyond what it should have been.  I'm patient when I need to be (place is packed, servers running around)...but this didn't merit much patience (not crowded, servers chatting it up instead of checking on their guests).
As mentioned previously, I'll definitely give it another chance and try the pizza.  If I ever come back here for a sit-down meal though, I'll bring a bottle of water and anticipate delayed service.",o5RQvOlSjTk5AHqrTRoXNw,1,0,3,4hXMxd_hsweU159XWlWGJQ

It's 10000 points which seemed like a decent price for lunch.  We arrived at 11am and went to the hostess stand for the restaurant and told her we were there for the My Vegas deal.  She said the restaurant was not open and to go to the walk up place.  We did.  The person there acted confused and started to say they weren't open, but of course, there were pizzas sitting there, so that made no sense.  She told us that the place where they get the beer is under construction so she had to go get the beers from the bar in the restaurant (like 20 feet away).  We're like, ""OK"".  Then she says you can have Bud LIght or 3-2-1.  So what we weren't sure about because she was not very clear and it was really loud in there from the overhead music was if we could only have Bud LIght or 3-2-1 because the regular beer thing was closed or if that is all you get on this deal.  Either way that sucked.  If you're using an offer like this to advertise your business, giving me shitty beer is a sure way to not impress me enough to come back.

Next, to the pizza.  There were four options.  I chose the mushroom and spinach with a white sauce and the husband had the many meats selection.  They stick the pieces into the over to heat them for a couple of minutes.  Then since we were told the restaurant was closed, we took our food to the sports book to eat at a table there.  The pizza was fine.  It's that thin crust type which is not my favorite.  The ingredients seemed good, but between the crap beer and the ok pizza and weird service, I have no desire to return.

The forager had white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. The farmstead consisted of proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm egg, and country olives. Both pizzas were pretty good and offered some unique, interesting flavor combinations. They were generous with the toppings although there was quite of bit of grease on them. Some of the slices had quite the soggy crust. At close to $30 per pizza, it's definitely not on the cheap side either. I'll probably try to find someplace else to eat next time I'm in the Aria.",zXynZ1Gvr9Bkqz5mJDaLEQ,0,0,3,sb_vPgZqHffRRO3YDPetFw

The pizzas are supposed to be a quick gourmet pizza, so don't expect to find your typical toppings aside from just pepperoni. There were maybe 4-5 options. The pizzas themselves were just meh. The crust was not that thin and crunchy. For a better late night pizza, secret pizza at the Cosmo is a much better option.

2747240,2013-11-22,0,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Stayed at the Aria for the weekend and after many meals in some of the higher end restaurants we decided to check out Five 50 for something a little cheaper and easier.  We went there on Sunday around noon to grab some lunch.

To start off, the girl at the register was extremely rude and seemed as though she just didn't want to be bothered.  We both got a couple of slices of the Mushroom Cheese pizza.  The girl pulled it out and didn't even bother to put it in the oven to warm it up so we assumed it must have been still hot already.  We also asked could we get it to go so that we could go back to our room and eat it and she just handed it to use on a couple of paper plates.  When I asked her could we get it in one of the boxes she looked annoyed and gave us one of the smaller boxes to stuff 4 giant pizza slices into.  Overall probably the worst customer experience I had at any of the restaurants in the Aria.

Now as for the food.  I was again disappointed.  I know it's pizza so I don't expect some high-end gourmet meal but this stuff was just bad.  It was cold, soaked in grease/oil, and almost rubbery tasting.  It's extremely heavy so I do not at all recommend this place if you care about your health.  This might rank among the worst pizza I've ever had and I've had a lot.  

Overall I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. At least when it comes to the pizza they serve upfront.  Even the low end looking pizza restaurant across the street next to the Walgreens tasted better and that was surprising considering that Five 50 is inside the Aria with all those other quality restaurants.  A combination of bad service and bad food is never a good thing.  Not recommended.",8Y0HmTx-kLMW0zsyCPPvwQ,0,1,1,wQKFuMHJjfE8z9qqt12ggQ

Anyway, they have a great beer selection, about 13 taps of all varieties, some national brands but a lot of regional beers.  The salads are good portion sizes but the thing that I really enjoyed was what they called Pigs & Truffles. This was a shredded pork cannelloni on top of spinach in b√©chamel sauce with some truffles on top.  The shredded pork in cannelloni was awesome, I love cannelloni but it usually comes with ground meats, not shredded. The pork wasn't dry at all and had a nice texture to it. The spinach had a bit of a peppery taste to it and it mixed very well with the creamy b√©chamel sauce.

I'm not sure if it was an off day...which would be unlikely because the place was hardly busy. Well anyway, things started off good. We ordered the garlic knots and meatballs. Garlic knots were good and the meatballs were overwhelming (too many spices). We decided to go with 2 different pizzas (1 per couple Margherita and Gotham) 
1. Margherita had too much sauce and just oily. I mean it's pretty hard to mess up a Margherita pizza. 
2. The Gotham was tastier but sooooo oily. 
3. Elvis Milkshake was amazing according to my husband. 
3. Our waiter was just rude. Very cocky and not very attentive. Maybe his tight ass jeans and hipster glasses only made him seem  older than he already was or they were cutting off the circulation...Either way his attitude needed work.

The Forager Pizza consists of a white sauce and plenty of mozzarella topped with mushrooms, spinach, large pieces of ham and whipped ricotta. It had a balance of salty and sweet but the ham became overwhelming and it could have used a better ratio of veggies. My friend ordered the Spaghetti and added Housemade Meatballs.

I believe she smiled 1.5 times in our hour sitting.  A .5 when we sat down (it looked more like a grimace) and a HUGE smile when she brought our check and said I hope you enjoyed your meal (in other words, when tipping time came).  The rest of the time she was angry, or perhaps heartbroken, or suicidal, or I do not know what.  I understand bad days happen.  Everyone has them.  They are rough.

Especially when one is the nicest lady ever and friendly and cheerful and you just keep scowling at her.  It looks bad.

Their Pepperoni pizza slice was the best we have had so far. Secret pizza still has the best while slice though. The ""secret"" to secret pizza""s white slice is that the ricotta is seasoned. This makes all the difference. No other white slice we have encountered has done this and it makes.all.the difference. 

The other offerings were just ok. The white after heated was.just a mess and did and was.very bland. The meat lowest was just ok. The issue was that all.the meats did.not have individual rates and just tasted a bit bland. 

Reheating the slices usually makes a big difference to the taste an texture. For the pepperoni I felt it.did not improve the slice so I always got is not warmed.up up. I simple.love their pepperoni. 
Ceasar salad was good. Each leaf is dressed with the dressing. Very fresh. Nice flavor. Real Ceasar dressing with anchovies which we could taste in the background.

I think the crust often makes the pizza and this one is primo.

It seems that wherever we go in Vegas, we order a Caesar Salad. And other than not offering anchovies (a preference of mine, but not Joleen): this one was fresh, had a nice tang and had some of the best croutons (their own). Excellent!

Five50 offers four or five pizzas by the slice but I think the value here is in the whole pie. 28 dollar pie about a 15 dollar salad and 10 buck blonde ale. Dinner, done!

The next time I eat here I am going to try the Chef's Selection Charcuterie/Mozzarella....and of course, a strawberry shake!!

Nothing really stood out to me regarding service, which means that it was probably fine.  In general, the location is good, the ambiance is cool and I like that there's the option of grabbing a slice to go.

I walked up to the pizza counter, curious about the pizza. I asked if this was Neapolitan Pizza and the guy seemed annoyed I was asking him a question. He said it was a hybrid between New York pizza and Neapolitan. I then asked him why the pizzas on the counter looked different than the one being made and he said because they are different pizzas. Obviously I knew the pizzas were different because of the different toppings, but I was basically getting at the pizzas have been out for too long that they look completely different from the one being freshly made. I then asked to speak with the manager to tell him about his employee who clearly was annoyed answering questions. He seemed to hear me but at the same time did not offer me a discount or anything to make up for the disappointing first impression. I should have left after this but I still ordered a slice of pizza. I ordered the spinach/ricotta/ mushroom pizza and it was just rich enough without being sickeningly rich. The crust had a sour flavor which is completely different from a New York pizza or Neapolitan. I appreciated them trying to be different but it was a little to sour for my taste. The crust was chewy, all the ingredients paired nicely together, and the sweetness of the ricotta helped balance out the sourness of the crust.

My friend ordered the meatball sandwich and I ordered the eggplant sandwich and we both shared a salad since the sandwiches didn't come with sides and we thought we would need more food.  WRONG!

McClain's creativity at this particular restaurant is a fresh and contemporary twist on foods that are very approachable, with many outside the box fun ideas as well.  I've had the pleasure of eating at all of his restaurants (Chicago and Vegas) over the years and he's really hitting his stride with a fun and totally new concept with this place.

The pizzas are amazing and not to be missed... but if you want, you could easily skip past them for some amazing other dishes at this place.  The beers on tap are different than most all places, and the bartender is quick to make a suggestion. The appetizers are amazing and different - I'd recommend ordering a few to get a try of the different fun things he has to offer.  The gotham or the blanca is my favorite... it would be impossible for me to make a choice between the two.

Overall, this place has a fun and casual feel but with an upscale elegance to it... it could easily be an appetizer & a quick drink type of place, or a slice to go.... but I would really recommend relaxing and having an interesting beer and a long night of fun tastes and fresh bold food.

They converted the sports book into this restaurant and like everything at Aria it looks great. Stylish modern interior, comfortable seating, and friendly staff all made it an enjoyable experience. As Chef Shawn McClain's new spot, I had high expectations. I mean he did beat a Iron Chef right?

We ordered the gotham and truffle pizza off their signature menu; like most pizzerias you can build your own as well. The 16 inch pizzas were thin and crispy and easily fed the four of us.
Overall the pizza was good but not really worth the $30 they charge. I guess its not too bad considering that one pie can feed two people but I expected more for the price. You can probably get the same pizza at Grimadlis. In the end you are really just paying for the name and surroundings.

They have a pretty good draft and bottled beer selection. The 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm is a damn good deal if you are lucky to enough to find a seat.

I really wanted pizza from seeing other yelp reviews so I asked her about the Forager pizza and she said ""oh don't get that, you can't have it to yourself it's way too big."" Okay, fine, no slices. So I ordered a small salad and stood in the ""slice to go"" line and brought it back to my table. By the way, the lady working the slice counter could not have been sweeter!

I must say, pizza is terrific. Perfect sauce, crispy rustic crust not paper thin but not over thick either. Toppings lively and fresh; had pepperoni and shrooms, great shrooms. Cheese amount good to a little too much, its fine.
2 appetizers that grabbed my gastric attention were the calamari with shishito peppers (good but small portion not worth 20 bucks) and the house wings (very good and different sauce on them, like a bbq/classic buffalo hot sauce fusion). 1 pizza sets you back 25 to 30 bucks; 6 big slices will feed 2 good without need for appetizers, if your a normal couple.

It takes less than 5 minutes for them to reheat it in the oven for you, and we tried:

-Gotham (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Granda Padano, $5.50/slice, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five50-pizza-bar-las-vegas?select=hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q#hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q): Really salty. I wish they did a plain sausage and cheese by the slice since it was the pepperoni and salami that were salty. I wouldn't get this combination again.
-Forager (White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach): Sadly, this was bland, and I wouldn't get this again.
-Special of the Day: BBQ Pulled Pork: This was the best out of the three pizzas. The bbq sauce was good, and the pulled pork tender. I would recommend this if they had it as a special again.
-Vegas Root Beer Float (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Butterfinger Crumbles, Boylan's Root Beer, $9): Good, but you only get a small cup for the price. I don't think I would order it again for $9.

Overall, you can get decent pizza here for a quick meal, but it won't be that cheap. The crust is pretty thin at least, but I didn't like most of their pre-made combinations, so most likely won't return.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,5,1,3,zu7w7_yxqiutKAMfLE7XBA
3397786,2017-12-01,0,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Five50 pizza was a convenient place to go.  So I made three dinner visits. Twice I had a dish that was half order spaghetti and half order meatball; which I learned about from one of the nice waitresses behind the bar.  Strangely, the menu only has spaghetti or meatballs but not both.  The sauce was perfectly spiced and meatballs delicious.

Here's where the points get docked: I also ordered slices of pizza. And on two visits, the pepperonis were hard like poker chips.  I would assume that the slices had been prescribed strong light therapy under a heat lamp and then was reheated for my order.  And in contrast to the pokeronis, the dough was soggy towards the wedge.  This was supposed to be a pizza restaurant, not 7-11.",TVcUVUYbiUEe9Un84g6oxg,0,0,2,Rcq_AIRtOGGj3h2JlzvWKw

The atmosphere is pretty loud  so don't expect intimacy if you are on a date. There was almost no wait to be seated and we had a lovely server named Aaron who was speedy and polite. We ordered a strawberry lime cider which tastes amazing!  Not too overpowering but just right. Our appetizer of choice was the calamari which is just average. Let's be honest though, it's a pizza bar so would you really expect to have amazing calamari ?

We asked for a pizza to go (half pepperoni and half cheese) Aaron was gracious enough to leave it in the front so we can just grab the pizza and go. This place is definitely one of the better pizza places to eat at in Vegas.

We ordered the Gotham pizza which comes with pepperoni and sausage. The meat had plenty of flavor and the pepperoni was crispy and thin. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed eating the toppings lol. Cheese was abundant and delicious as well. Lots of stretchy gooey goodness with each bite! I would have given this place 5 stars, but I feel it really falls short in terms of the crust. With everything so flavorful and delicious it really contrasts the plain and burnt tasting crust. It felt like I was eating cardboard at some parts lol. If they added some garlic or cheese flavor to the crust then it would have been perfect.

One pizza was enough to fill up 2 people and it only cost about $35 which is pretty good considering it is a meal on the strip.

Overall I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't don't do yet. It is easily one of my favorite pizza spots on the strip and I'll probably be back to try out their other flavors. Hopefully the crust will be better lol.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,5,4,4,97VoiBcmyt3eJwPqqQttbQ

If you're looking for just slices they have some to go however they do not offer slices of pizza when you sit down in the restaurant. 

The pizzas are hefty and good sized, enough for 2 people (maybe even more depending how much you eat). We ordered the Catania which is a pizza with white sauce, Italian sausage and tomato. I personally really liked this pizza. It came out nice and hot with a slightly charred thin crust and an abundance of cheese. The white sauce made the top of the pizza have a creamier texture, so you get the crispy texture from the crust along with the softness of the cream all in the same bite. The markings of a good pizza. 

We are also ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer. The wings were dressed with flavor. Had a little kick to it but it was sort of a sweet and spicy type of dressing. Came out with a little bit of ranch for dipping. I could have done without the wings. Anyway, overall four stars all around.",YxWG-OtTP8B8CSdih8Fbcw,0,0,4,6NUj3W4Feg_ofvV7YPYU7A

The pizzas were excellent, both in quality and taste. Certainly, this isn't delivery pizza, and is a just a notch above a CPK. The crust is fluffy and yet at the same time crisp, and the toppings are clearly of a high quality.

We tried the Blanca with spicy italian sausage and the Truffle as well. We enjoyed both of them thoroughly. 

Certainly, you are paying a premium here. 22 (cheese) to 29 (truffle) for a (non gigantic) pizza is at best considered ""casino"" pricing, and at worst, just flat out a rip-off. I don't think I could even justify coming here to spend 5.50 on a slice, as the slices aren't really ""meal"" sized like some places.

We also had the pork belly appetizer, which, when digested with all the ingredients in a single bite, was just absolutely incredibly. Still, it would be 15 dollars had we been paying ourselves.

In the end, it wasn't a bad experience at all - in fact, service was really good and we came away very happy.

GOTHAM: sausage, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella, grana padano

THE FORAGER: mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, and whipped ricotta

Both were very delicious, and the crust was perfectly crunchy with a nice chewiness, and tons better than Secret(ly pathetic)Pizza across the street. Other offerings they will have-

MARGHERITA: tomato, basil, and mozzarella

NORTH BEACH: clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano

FARMSTEAD: country ham, cr√®me fraiche, farm egg, olives

SICILIAN: pancetta, broccoli rabe, pepper flakes, and white anchovies

TRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, b√©chamel, fresh thyme, truffles

BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar

I also overheard  one of the guys saying that a couple of different sizes were going to be offered and prices weren't available at the time. they were also in the process of finalizing all menu items.

Other fun facts:

550- The ideal oven temperature for Chef McClain's pizzas, and 5:50pm....the start of Happy Hour!

It will be an open kitchen with three different areas:

SLICE COUNTER: You will be able to walk up and order a slice and grab a cold one

CRAFT BEER BAR: Full service bar in a centralized location featuring 6-10 craft beers

MAIN DINING ROOM: a combination of two and four tops with communal dining to accommodate all guests

Service 3 stars- our server was friendly and attentive, yet had very little food knowledge, and was slightly over bearing. Seriously dude, I know what kind of beer I like, although I appreciate your input, I chose it because I like it, not because ""you suggested it"". You want a gold star?  I get that it's a new restaurant too, but you should know what's in the food, especially since people could have allergies. 
Food-3 stars. Overall the food was alright, but everything was severely under seasoned, with no salt and pepper shakers on the table. Call me meek, but this is a chef run restaurant and I was not about to ask for them. Warm ricotta was just that, warmed up cheese. No herbs, no salt, just some EVOO. Yawn. The calamari looked delicious, until you picked it up with your fork and bam! All the ""fritti"" falls off, leaving you with oily, naked squid. The truffle pizza was probably the best part, although those potatoes, like everything else, really needed to be seasoned. 
Value 1 measly star-$22 for a cheese pizza, are you kidding me?  Even with strip pricing this is a little ridiculous. Our bill came out to be $90 for a snack, an app, a pizza, and a couple of beers. For that cost per person I could eat someplace a little less casual and a lot better tasting.

I went with the Gotham (pepperoni, salami, sausage) for my first slice with every intent to go back for a second.

However, the slice was big enough to fill me up and more than justify the $5.50 price.

It was hot, quick and served with a smile by a manager who said I came at the perfect time because lines form the closer it gets to 3am on nights like this.

There was a sports bar right next to it where I could sit down and order a drink while I enjoyed my slice.

We started out with a couple apps, sampled four different pies (which we we able to do halves on) and finished with a few desserts.

Small Plates:

Pepperoni Arancini- Rice Balls, Red Sauce and Roasted Garlic Aioli. $12. Three small arancinis, they were pretty good.

Pigs and Truffles- Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel and Summer Truffles. $18.  I'm a sucker for bechamel. That intrigued me more than the truffles. This was pretty outstanding.

Signature Pizzas are 16"". 

North Beach- Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions, Oregano. By far one of the weirdest tasting pizzas I've ever had. I think what threw me off the most was the sauce. I'm used to a clam pizza with a white sauce. The red sauce did not pair well, even worse was the smoked mozzarella. I felt like I was eating BBQ. It was terrible.

Blanca- Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Chedder, Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil. This was decent, the ricotta was the best part. 

Truffle- Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme, Shaved Truffles. Would you like a side of oil to go with that? Wow, only thing I saw on this pizza was oil. Someone call  the nearest Cath Lab and book a room for me? I couldn't finish my slice, it was terribly overwhelming. 

Margherita- Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil. This was pretty standard. Nothing to write home about. 

At $28 a pizza, you walk away thinking, ""did that really just happen?"" 

Desserts:

Warm Apple Pie & French Toast Cubes. Both made up for the horendous pizza.

We noticed that the person who ordered before us had their pizza warmed up.  This was never offered to us.  The pizza slices aren't too expensive but for how greasy and bland the pizza is, I wouldn't have even paid the $6/slice and would have just starved until the morning and eaten at a buffet.

The white pizza was gross (cold, hard/flavorless cheese).  The slice with sausage and pizza was greasy.  The margherita pizza was completely forgettable.

My most recent Vegas trip ended on a great food note and this place is it! It's located at Aria next to the sports bar and is open pretty late. I stayed at Vdara again and walked over here before Jewel ( another story for another time) and decided to eat!

Be warned. The pizza is somewhat expensive but it's Vegas. If cheap is an issue, and I love cheap food, go to Norms. Ordered the basic Margherita and calamari. The calamari had a good flavor and was fresh but the breading was a bit soggy. I prefer for it to be more crispy but it was good. 

The pizza is the real stunner. 26$ for Margherita seems expensive to most but it is easily one of the best pizzas I've had in life. Usual Margherita with thin crust, buffalo mozzarella and basil. The cheese is amazing quality and there's overall shredded mozzarella on the pizza so it's not just sauce with tiny pillows of mozzarella. They also add the basil post bake so it doesn't get crispy and tasteless. Not much to disliked here! Service wasn't bad but the place was busy at 8pm on a Friday night.

Admist the casino and other dining options, located next door to the sports bar area, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait but then called immediately. Score!

We were seated and given drinks shortly after. We saw the table next to us of 3 young boys (10-12) given 3 large pizzas for the 3 of them! We were in shock as they annhilated all 3 pies! they all passed out right after, and it was fun free entertainment.

My friend and I shared their caeser salad, which was really good but glad we asked for the dressing on the side. If you're not a fan of anchovies, avoid this salad as it's really strong. They also provide a side of egg yolk for the dressing as well, but we didn't touch it.

We then asked if we could do a half and half pizza as I'm a white sauce fan, friend is not. The waitress warned us that it would turn pink in the middle and we were okay with that. When I ordered the forager (mushrooms, bacon, spinach) and my friend ordered the margherita, the waitress then told us the whole pink sauce again (within 30 seconds of telling us the first time) and again, we told her it was okay.

Pizza arrived not too long later, and can't go wrong with woodfired pizzas. Mine was slightly burnt around certain parts, but it was super tasty. Hit the spot. My friend's margherita was excellent as well. I couldn't even finish 2 of the 3 slices, so we took it to go and it was a great midnight snack. The pizza was around $26 which was not bad at all.

They also had a huge line for pizza slices to go (and table top seating) which is super smart for people who need a quick bite or craving after drinking.",iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw,3,2,4,Tj3jUv152hQh3GOruUjZrg

I asked her if she had that right, a small can of coke for $5 and she nodded affirmatively. The balls of these greedy owners to think of marking up a can of coke 2000% from their cost.

The gotham and the spicy one (I cant remember its name) are very delicious. They obviously use high quality ingredients, and have consistently made a delicious pizza every single time. The crust though...I never knew that crust on a pizza would make me say ""wow, this crust is so good"" at least 3 times per pizza. It's perfectly cooked/burnt to perfection sourdough. 
The drinks are good, and the service is also very good.
One thing to consider before you sit down though is that they only serve certain things at the bar, and certain things at the table. So that can be a little confusing, and really the only thing I can say is maybe not great. Other than that minor detail its all good.

For $20.13 I received an amuse bouche of super addictive cheesy, garlic bread, a cup of white bean soup, 2 margherita pizza slices and a vanilla ice cream sandwich with a shot of blood orange soda.

Everything was super delicious; the soup was nice and hearty (although I could've done without the dried herbs) and the pizza was super delicious. For dessert I expected a run-of-the-mill ice cream sandwich, what I got was a sandwich comprised of two galletes with vanilla ice cream, how cool is that? The blood orange soda is made in house and was amazing as well. 

The service was great as well; our waitress told us a ittle about the chf and asked us where else we were going to go for RW. She recommended Sage, which I tried at RW when it opened and is mind-blowing.

If you have been to Five50, you might can understand why. If you have not, let me explain. For one, there's a pizza entree called Gotham (comes with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano) which is a must. Second, there's a pizza entree called Margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella, and basil) which is also a must. Out of the two pizzas that I just mentioned, Gotham is a must-must.

4295368,2014-03-27,1,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"When you find yourself in the more upscale casinos in Vegas, you'll often find yourself pressed to find affordable food. Secret Pizza in The Cosmpolitan is always a fan favorite, but sometimes you just want to try something out. Enter Five50.

I find the line in Secret Pizza always really intimidating when I'm just really hungry for a quick slice, and Five50, located in Aria, is a great alternative. Lines are never really long, and pizzas are just as great. What Secret Pizza lacks in variety, Five50 offers more unique flavors.

Still, I would say the price has something left to be desired. $5.50 is a bit hefty for a slice of pizza, and although it is a large slice, I can't say I was all too happy parting with my cash. Nonetheless, still a very solid pizza place, and it definitely is worth checking out, if you're ever sick of Secret Pizza and looking for a change of pace.

I would just raise one caveat though: beware of the soda prices. I was looking to grab a quick can of soda, and the price ended up being $10 for the combo of a slice and soda. Lo and behold, they charged $4.50 for a can of soda. Whereas I don't mind getting ripped off if offered in tap, it's nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can I can get from a grocery store. $2-$3? Sure. $4.50, please no.

The chorizo was tasty and obviously a nice quality meat. The Mozzarella was my favorite of the cheeses, but the Burrata was nice and creamy.

As we were seated our server introduced himself, a soft spoken guy, and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave his honest opinion when making recommendations. He seemed like a nice guy but came off sounding very condescending at times. I really don't appreciate servers who stereotype their tables based on their age and attire. All we ordered were a round of water and didn't get any refills after our initial glasses! 

To be honest, most of the staff was pretty soft spoken as well. I'm not sure if it was because of the intimate/luxury feel they were trying to give but all of the team members in the restaurant were very quiet and quite honestly not very helpful either.

Anyways, we ended up ordering the Gotham and Truffle pizza which were large 16"" pies. Both of which our server had recommended as being popular choices among guests. 

The Gotham was basically a meat lovers wet dream, it was topped with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and a handful of other ingredients. Overall it wasn't bad, but tbh I can't say I fell in love with it either.

The Truffle pizza was a major disappointment. Beware when you order it, it was very oily and certainly takes a refined pallet to enjoy.

Overall, we were not very impressed by what this place had to offer. Five 50 seemed like a knockoff more expensive dining version of Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan and the service was not worth what we paid. It was certainly a 1 time experience.

The pizza flavor was unique, and enjoyable, the dough definitely fresh. The only thing was the amount of oil running down the slice, and the ingredients kept slipping off, I had to use fork and knife. Also while the crust was cooked to perfection, I felt that it was very doughy in the center, I could not hold the pizza and eat it with my hands because it would flop. 

 $14 drink was in a small glass, and tasted watered down. Go for the beer instead. 
Staff was amazing, as I believe all Aria staff are. Very attentive without hovering our table.",UIoF_PQfhv0usBazHehbGA,1,0,3,0k4cMwp4uUZhnGf6HqEYiQ

4593238,2016-05-23,2,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Lunch is a forgotten meal in Vegas.  Endless crowds queue up and drop benjamins on brunch and dinner -- but nobody gives a damn about lunch anymore.

While I mourn the decline of lunch, I also take full advantage of it.   That means finding the best lunch specials available -- and the lunch special at Five50 Pizza Bar is a perfect example.

I normally wouldn't go out of my way for a place like Five50, since similar concepts are a dime a dozen in San Diego.  What San Diego doesn't have, though, is an excellent pizza-centric lunch special, consisting of soup and personal pizza for a mere $18.  (San Diego also doesn't have a restaurant with Shawn McClain's name behind it.)

When I dropped by at around 11:30am on a Friday, the crowd was evenly split between twentysomethings nursing hangovers with take-out, business travelers and solo diners at the bar, and larger families and groups in the dining room.  Five50 is actually very easy on the eyes, with retro-style murals on one wall and cool interlocking wooden brick latticework on another.  Since Five50 is tucked in the very back of the Aria casino, thru-traffic is minimal, making it a surprisingly quiet and subdued place to grab a meal.

Like I mentioned, it's really all about the lunch special here.  The soup of the day was minestrone, which was absolutely perfect -- warm, hearty, comforting, and healthy to boot.  For the pie, I tried the truffle pizza, which comes with salami, potato, and creamy bechamel.  While the flavor of the pizza was good, it was also a total greasebomb.  I also wish the potatoes hadn't been so hard and undercooked.

Service is fine in that stand-offish, I-have-no-reason-to-friendly-to-you-since-you're-a-tourist-who'll-never-come-back-here sort of way, which is typical of the Strip. 

That said, I'll still probably come back next time I'm in town, if for no other reason than that lunch special.  Join me in my crusade to make lunch the new brunch!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,5,3,4,L0Hz_978nI5OhVwJueb9XQ

The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that ""That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza"".

The reason why we waited fifteen minutes is beyond my knowledge, for the restaurant probably had less than ten diners excluding us.  

Upon much contemplation, we agreed upon ordered four pizzas, and two pasta dishes to share.  The pizzas were the margherita, gotham, truffle, and north beach.  The pastas included the ricotta cavatelli, and a secret dish, not on the menu, which featured freshly arrived clams, and linguine.  The pizzas and pastas came out fairly quickly.  The pizzas were all very tasty, my favorite being the truffle and margherita.  One does not get to eat real truffles every day, so they were a welcome treat.  The margherita had a sweet and savory sauce, and the cheese was equally appealing to the palate.  However, the pastas, lacked anything they would deem them of a worthy restaurant quality dish.  The cavatelli was overpowered with a sour and salty lime taste that went into every spoonful.  On the other hand, the secret pasta lacked any flavor at all.  It was bland, and very oily.

Draft beer choices were plentiful. The garlic knots caught my eye. And my tastebuds. Good choice to start a Vegas trip, if I do say so myself.

5022987,2013-07-29,2,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"The fianc√©e and I are big fans of Chef Shawn McClain's other Aria restaurant, Sage, having enjoyed memorable food and drink while there.  Given our past enjoyment of his cuisine, we decided to try his newly opened FIVE50 Pizza Bar.  Our decision was made even more palatable since we'd gotten coupons for a free slice and beer from MGM's myVegas game on Facebook.  

We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night.  There was no line at the slice counter where pizza by the slice was sold.  We noted immediately that not all pizzas available in the sit down part of the restaurant were available by the slice.  No matter, since the Gotham ($5.50 per slice/$28 for a 16"" pie), a meat pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano was what I wanted and it was on the abbreviated slice menu.  FIVE50's slices are taken from their 16"" pies, which are divided into 8 pieces, so slices received aren't very large.  Also, since they're pre-baked, there's no telling how long they've been sitting on the counter.  My slice was plucked off of the counter and slid into the wood-fired oven at what I'm assuming was 550 degrees to warm it up.  A few minutes later, I received my slice.  The crust was decently flavorful, crispy at the edges, but not necessarily chewy throughout.  I attribute most of the lackluster quality of the crust to the fact the pizza was pre-baked, had cooled down absorbing the grease from the relatively ample amount of meaty toppings, resulting in the crust becoming soggy and limp.  I was pretty unimpressed.  My fianc√©e didn't fare much better with her selection.      

The beer selection at the slice counter was also abbreviated with only two beers available on tap and a handful of bottles.  It was also surprisingly unimpressive with only one of the beers available (a bottled Dogfish Head) sounding remotely interesting.  Unfortunately, they wanted $13 for it, which combined with the slice of the pizza, exceeded the value of the coupon.  I could've paid the difference, but as a matter of principle, I'd never pay $13 for a 12-ounce bottle of beer.

My parting thought was that FIVE550 may be a very good pizza joint with a solid craft beer selection.  Perhaps our luck would've been much better had we sat in the dining room, ordered a whole pizza, and tasted a freshly baked pie.  However, you won't get that experience by the slice at the walk up counter.  It's overpriced...expect to pay $16 for a beer and a slice, and it, sadly, underdelivers.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,8,2,2,ZuNxm6oLk-dT8RrcgQLI8A

It was a bit early for dinner (5:30pm) so we decided to have a quick snack before the show. Yelped the place beforehand which had mixed reviews but pretty much consistent good gourmet pizza though a bit pricey. (understandably being on the strip) 
There were six of us but two didn't want to eat as they were at the buffet earlier. So we decided to share one 16 inch pizza - the Forager- between the four of us and a beer each for two people. Our waiter, who will remain nameless as we were so pissed off we forgot to get it, decided for us that one pizza was not enough. Motioning with his fingers how tiny slices we were gonna get. We looked at each other and I was like, I know how big a 16 inch pizza looks like! But my friend decided to order another pizza, I guess just to make the awkwardness less subtle. NOT! 
Anyway, while waiting for our pizza, the next table's order arrived and I pointed to my friend how having 2 pizzas between the 4 of us would be waaayy too much considering we weren't that hungry and we'll be watching a show for a couple of hours with those pizzas sitting like rocks in our bellies...
She got up and cancelled the other pizza. Our food arrived, had a slice each and two slices were left which we just picked on. The server gave us our check and we split the bill of $43. (For 1 pizza and 2 beers!!!) and left a 15% tip despite the lack luster service. We were already out of the restaurant when our waiter tapped us and showed the bill and said, "" Ladies, you forgot your bill."" I was like, Seriously??? We left our cash payment on our table! Did you even check at all???!!
I was mortified. The nerve!! And all he did was turn his back to us and walked back to the restaurant without a single word of apology.

5118354,2017-01-19,36,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Two course lunch special at 18, not a bad deal. We were staying in the Aria and were hungry before checkout and decided to give Five50 Pizza Bar a try. The service was ok, the food was okay. We didn't have reservations and checked in with the hostess who said there was about a forty minute wait for a table but there were open seats in the bar. We decided to sit at the bar, but soon realized that the service at the bar was super slow. One bartender, ten plus seats. The bartender finally gave us some menus and more than enough time to decide. We went with the two course lunch special: first course: seasonal soup or the spinach and pear salad, second course: mezza luna pasta, personal pizza (up to three toppings), or a specialty pizza. I went with the seasonal soup which was tomato bisque and the Farmstead specialty pizza. The bartender was super sweet but was also super busy which led to a lot of wait time.

The tomato bisque was served first. It was a mediocre soup; creamy but a tad bland. I would have liked to have a piece of bread or some type of carb to go with it. It was not anything beyond mediocre. After what felt like a long time of waiting, our individual sized pizzas arrived at the bar. The Farmstead pizza is topped with creme fraiche, country olives, prosciutto, arugula and a farm egg. This sounded a lot tastier on paper than when it came out. They are very stingy with the ingredients and my pizza was a bit bland. I was expecting the egg to be cooked over easy on the pizza but instead the yolk on the egg was fully cooked and I was not able to disperse it all over the pizza. Disappointing. I was also missing the ooey gooey cheesiness of a traditional pizza.

Conclusion: I should've went with the personal create-your-own pizza. I assumed that the specialty pizzas were the way to go but it just meh. I saw a few unoccupied tables throughout the meal and wondered why the wait time was said to be forty minutes. The pros about Five50 Pizza Bar is that you can get a whole pizza or an individual slice, the two course lunch special for 18 bucks, and they are open late for that nice greasy ""had too much to drink"" slice. The cons: pizza was dry and the ingredients were scarce, the flavors did not blow me away, and you can get a tastier (and cheaper) slice of pizza on the strip.

We started off with the Pepperoni Arancini ($8). These were pretty tasty, but most of the flavor was in the Garlic Aioli...yum!  Good portion size / price ratio.

Pigs & Truffles ($18): Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel & Summer Truffles. This was delicious but felt a bit spendy. It had a wonderful truffle essence from the fragrant smell to the taste!  I probably wouldn't order this again though.

We got two pizzas...both SPLIT into halves.  So we were able to try a total of FOUR different pizzas :

Truffle Pizza ($29): Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme & Shaved Truffles. Blanca ($27): Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Cheddar, Olice Oil, Garlic & Basil. Both were excellent, but the Truffle Salami with shaved Truffles was outstanding! Loved the flavor explosions here!! Highly recommended!

Margherita ($24): Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella & Basil. North Beach ($28): Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions & Oregano. The Margherita was good, bit sweet with a nice mozzarella flavor. The North Beach was surprisingly smokey in a red sauce, which was an odd combination in my eyes...I would have much preferred a white sauce for the clams.  I can't really recommend either of these.

And to finish, we tried the Warm Apple Pie ($9?): White Cheddar, Oatmeal Streusel & Smoke Salted Mascarpone Ice Cream. Good variation of the classic. 

Crispy Sourdough Fritters ($9?): Winter Spiced Cranberry Sauce & Orange Glaze. These were great, but the cranberry sauce was perfect! Just the right amount of tanginess to compliment the fried sourdough.  Recommended :)

I've stayed at the Aria for the past 3 or 4 trips since this place opened earlier in the summer and hadn't gotten a chance to try this place yet until now. After eating here, I kind of wish I was either drunk at the time or craving a quick bite or maybe buzzed or about to pass out from too much fun because the pizza was just not that good.

First off, the appetizer options on their lunch menu is almost non-existent. I saw maybe some garlic bread and salads and meat and cheeses but not even calamari or something interesting? Kind of a big deal, especially since these pizzas take a while to make. We ordered two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white sauce. The cool thing is that they let you mix two different kinds of pizzas into one if they have the same sauce so we did just that. Half of one pizza had clams and the other was more of a meat pizza. The other one we tried was a white truffle pizza that had truffle salami and truffle shavings sprinkled throughout. Oh my....everything was so salty!! Not to mention that we couldn't eat half the crusts because they were burnt from the wood fire ovens. The portions were bigger than expected but since we don't like wasting food, it just made us eat more of these salt monsters. 

When this place opened months ago in its infancy, the reviews were not very good at all. I was bummed until I saw that the reviews recently have been much more well received so I thought it was a soft opening type thing. NOPE!!! It's ok - I very rarely eat pizza in Vegas anyways but if someone were to ask me, I would say go to the Cosmo secret pizza place instead.

BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar

FARMSTEAD: country ham, cr√®me fraiche, farm egg, olives

I would say the crowd favorite out of those three was the Truffle, definitely a unique pizza! The Blanco was very good as well, and the Farmstead wasn't our favorite.

5244490,2017-12-21,1,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"The most delightful New York style pizza in Las Vegas. Highly recommended pizza from someone that could live off of pizza 3 meals a day / 365 days a year. Great for a late night dinner after a show, a quick snack, or to just hang out with friends in a trendy place. They have a full bar and menu selection to please even the pickiest of eaters. 

For the fellas that line pizza as much as I do, I'd suggest ordering an extra appetizer or two - this way you have leftovers to put in your fridge (most rooms in the Aria or Vdara have a fridge in the room) / snack for later on. 

This pizza joint is located with in the Aria resort, just off of the casino floor. There is a very warm feeling (ambiance) when you walk in.  You have two ways of ordering. Either through their To Go window or via a Sit Down dining experience. I've done both. 

Servers are fun and really seem to enjoy being there. No pressure to order anything fancy, the way you sometimes feel at Vegas restaurants. 

This pizza is simply amazing. 

A number of the other reviews are critical of this place because of the price. If you are used to paying $10 for a Dominos pizza, then you will be surprised. But if you enjoy treating yourself / your family to something special, this is the place for you.",D8k2A5_Z-ptEDo4O3fe8ow,2,1,5,6FnipD83BvthlWqODx8ofw

A fan of Shawn McClain dating to his Chicago days and a truly impressive experience at Sage it was with high hopes that our party of four paid a visit to upscale pizza parlor Five50 after the disaster that was Yellowtail and while I personally enjoyed the experience more than my companions it would be exceedingly difficult for me to recommend a $30/pp pizzeria with awkward service as a place to visit in a city where far better pie can be found off-strip at a fraction of the price.  Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16"" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the ""style"" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,3,ssNEvvNp6LOn_n9lqu7GVw

Numerous restaurants state that they use only the freshest ingredients, but at Five50 Pizza you can taste the freshness. 

I brought two finicky eaters with me for my first visit. We ordered a Margherita pizza and a Caesar salad. Five50 Pizza took two very simplistic dishes and made them extraordinary. I loved the crust, the sauce, the cheese...EVERYTHING!! Even my picky eaters couldn't get enough of the pizza and salad.

Five50 Pizza doesn't try be something they're not. So, don't come here expecting Chicago style pizza. They actually have more of a East Coast meets Italy vibe, so it's big but not greasy. You can't go wrong getting a pizza pie here.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,1,2,4,mE0Vz42rQvWOTQRKFYn1lA

Cannelloni with pork shoulder, spinach, bechamel and truffles. This dish is fabulous. It's creamy, rich and you can absolutely smell and taste the truffles. The pork is tender and juicy. 5/5

Gotham Pizza:
Sausage, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano. This was just alright...quite ordinary. Grana padano is cheaper than Parmigianno-Regiano and all the other ingredients aren't hard to find/ expensive so, I'm not sure why this is $28. 3.5/5

Truffle Pizza:
Truffle salami, parmesan, bechamel, thyme, and shaved truffles. This was amazing! Fragrant, rich and truffly. 5/5

Their pizzas are 16"" from $26-29 (some are worth it, some are not - just read the ingredients and use your own judgment). The crust is fantastic, crisp and tasty.

My boyfriend and I had seen the advertisements all over the Strip for this pizza place (they showcase their Margherita pizza on the ads- which is my very favorite) and he'd heard good things about it as well, so we thought we'd stop in for lunch. Boy, did we make an incredibly poor mistake. 

First of all: the prices are absolutely insane for the quality of food. I know that it's Vegas, and that Aria is mediocre disguised as upscale, but come on. The Margherita pizza is a $28, and it definitely is big enough for two (I'll give it that), but when that pizza arrived at our table I was confused that our server had mixed our order up with another table. The Margherita is 100% just a cheese pizza with a few pathetic basil leaves on top, and you could tell just by one look at it. False advertisement, much? Granted, I'm somewhat of a pizza snob and I've had Margherita all over the world - I know a good, authentic one from a downright bad one. This disgusting cheese concoction definitely fell into the latter. I've truly had better pizza from Papa John's or Dominos - this was that bad. The cheese, which our server condescendingly proclaimed was ""PURE BUFFALO MOZZARELLA"" was absolutely NOT of high quality and was rubbery and gross.

Speaking of our server: a 20-something brunette, whose name I regret not remembering, was downright condescending and rude - I was literally appalled by her flippant and accusatory tone when we asked if we had the right pizza (because we were genuinely confused when it arrived). A simple request for a Coke ($5) and a side of Ranch ($2) genuinely seemed to put her out, the poor thing. 

We spent $40 (without tip) on a terrible pizza, a coke and a side of ranch. There's a million and one overpriced places to eat on the Strip - save your time and energy and most DEFINITELY skip this one.",ASRwhWkDjMATyHJTI2Vk6w,0,0,1,HuXEIkveBbEdbxfhy7UvTg

Highs: 

- Meatballs (so I was told since I don't eat them) However I noticed out of all the plates people were gobbling them up the most. 

- Hummus and Veggie plate: Pretty darn good. I wish that they had maybe picked the veggies or did something with them, but I am embarrassed by the amount of flatbread and hummus I ate. I swear if someone even LOOKED like they were going to get it away from me I would growl! 

- Olives: Don't order these on a first date or with someone you are trying to impress, or even, act as if you are not a total animal. I always say, let them find that out later with a little time! heh

Lows:

- Cesar Salad: Just god awful. Right when we put it in our mouth we all knew something wasn't right. We didn't want to offend out host or anyone else at the table who may have enjoyed it.

- Marg Pizza: I felt it wasn't truly a margarita pizza. I mean it was good, but had too much sauce and too much cheese with not enough basil flavor to really pass itself off as a margarita pizza. I mean, I love sauce and such and so the pizza was awesome. I just think that if you order a marg, then you probably want a traditional marg if that makes sense.

I didn't drink as this was my last day in Vegas before I drove back to SD. The water helped me stay alive though! 

Over all I have TOTALLY had worse pizza in Vegas but I wouldn't make a huge special trip here unless I was hosting a little party and needed a place with a great set menu option with a TON of food.",kornl8kHXI9X86Blbs55rg,5,7,4,mroV5sMm8EXhUlGmmXF-Tg

5452855,2013-07-11,1,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"So I've been meaning to write a review about this place, bc I came here with a group of 11 and they were SO accommodating!

We got to sit at their special table reserved for larger parties, which was super luxe and somewhat sectioned off, which I like.  The only problem with this table is the fact that there really isn't much room between the chairs and the ""wall,"" so it seemed like the servers were having a hard time getting around us.  Not a big deal since we made do, but a bit of a design snafu.

They have a great selection of cocktails, wines, and beers, although it's vegas and I was pretty hungover so I had iced tea instead (this was ok, but had an over-steeped, bitter aftertaste).

Since a portion of our party got there first, we decided to order a couple of salads: we had one with arugula and one with burrata.  Of the two, no contest: the burrata was the clear winner, the perfect riff on your classic Caprese.

Being that our group was so large, we just decided to order one of each of their specialty pizzas.  In addition to your standard fare like Margherita pizza and Sicilian, they also had a few more unique ones - one with clams, one with truffles, and another with egg!  The pizzas are actually a lot bigger than I thought they would be; they're 16 inches in diameter.  I didn't get to try all of them, but the two I did have were SO delicious: the Forager (with mushrooms) and the Farmstead (the one with egg - mind you, I'm a huge sucker for runny eggs).

TIP: Not sure if it's standard that they bring hot chili oil with the food, but if you don't get it, ask for it.  That stuff is amazing.

Because we ordered so many pizzas, they notified us that it would take a bit for them to come out.. That being said, they brought out a few of their appetizers to tide us over.  The toasted marcona almonds were good (although not as crunchy as I would like), the olives were really unctious and delicious (but if I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would probably be olives, so I'm slightly biased), the veggies were pretty standard (good but unremarkable), and the chicharrones are the best darn chicharrones I've ever had (haven't had a wide variety, but these were perfectly seasoned and fried).

The service was great, although there were a few kinks here and there.  Drinks took a while to refill and such, but it was their second day of operation and the rest of the friendly service more than made up for it.",XjjhZnQOD4YbPP3V1nv5RA,4,3,4,fb7Gqtd7GZhBwdvU0TgunQ
5464819,2013-09-16,1,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"My boyfriend and I walked into a restaurant filled with screaming football fans this past Sunday afternoon.  Being that we are not sporting fans we were quickly annoyed but got over it and settled in at the bar (which was not crowded)  We ordered a couple of cheese slices, caesar salad, and the italian hero.  All were awesome, fresh, and decent in portion.  However, service was lack luster.  Originally my boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and out came the Italian sandwich instead.  We didn't care and we have both worked in the industry and understand these things happen but when the bartender looked at us like you have two heads and claims that we didn't order the meatball sandwich, I was a little put off.  Whatever, I was hungry and with that I ordered an additional cheese slice and again I got that look from our bartender like ""Really, you guys want ANOTHER slice, how could you?!""  It was odd.  Also, our drinks were left empty after we finished our first glass and remained that way for the entire meal, we were never offered a refill (again we didn't mind and god forbid we ask for something else we would like to consume!).
Food....awesome.
Design.....awesome.
Acoustics......not so awesome.
Service......with an attitude.

It's the kind of pizza that surprises you. You're not looking for much, maybe, as you pass by or running back to your sports betting table, or between dice rolls on the way back from the restroom. But that's the beauty of it...

My friends and I crave this pizza -- it's the first thing we all mention when talking about returning to Vegas (well, that and the craps tables at Bellagio). Whether at 2am after a long night of dancing, 11am while watching some sports betting next door, or 4pm after a long day at a pool party, the food is perfect.

Crust: Thin -- but not brittle. The crunchy/chewy balance is near perfect every time. They've got their science down. You won't have a soggy slice that drips all over you. It'll hold up without being too tough to bite into.

Toppings: All top quality. The italian cured pig varieties on the Gotham and spicy do not disappoint. The mushrooms on Forage are prime. The cheeses are rich. 

Taste: Phenomenal. They don't over do it or try to make things too complicated. Even if you get the clam pizza, it's like PePe's -- basics but good. Like any good cooking. Quality ingredients well-done are the best.

Service: Always tends to be polite, efficient, and to the point. Heated-up slides taste great and only take 1-2 minutes to get right again.

Price: .... Five dollars and fifty cents. Very inexpensive. They're selling crap pizza all over Vegas with a Rolling Rock for $7.",QwYUgv2fSLbtelKZd4MdAg,3,0,5,s2aT3p5Iuhoqcnsmvxn_tQ

After walking off and coming back, he said he could deduct the price of the slice and beer from our bill at the end.

The garlic knots sounded good but instead of pretzel-like things or breadsticks like we thought, they were these little (and I empasize little) balls that were nothing but oil and grease. 

The pizza was just average. Typical New York variety where you have to fold it like a taco or eat it with a fork.

I ended up redeeming for two slices of pizza and a bottle of diet coke for $15. I got the Gotham and the Margherita - both were good, but nothing I'd clamor to return for.

5515016,2014-05-14,13,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Given how popular Cosmo's not-so-secret Secret Pizza is for late night eats, I always wondered why more hotels didn't offer something similar.  Especially ARIA, given how far they are from just about everything else.  However, it looks like I wasn't the only one that wondered about that because helllooooo Five50 Pizza!

Located next to the sportsbook (taking over the old sports grill), Five50 is a trendy pizza joint with both a regular dining room and a to-go counter to get pizzas by the slice.  Both are open relatively late, though maybe not late enough for the post-clubbing crowd (the restaurant closes at midnight, the counter at 2:00am).  Still, they're great for midnight cravings, or people on the go like me.

Of the four types offered, I ordered the GOTHAM since it was simply my kind of pizza - Sausage, Pepperoni, Salami, Mozzarella, and Grana Podano.  Each bite was full of unhealthy, meaty goodness and I liked how the crust was thin, but not soggy.  At the same time, the flavors aren't exactly unique.  I've had others in the past that had more creative and compelling flavors, which brings me to the next point...

...that as much as I liked the pizza, I'd rather spend the money on something I can't get elsewhere.  Yes, it's the Strip, but $6.50 a slice is nothing to scoff at (thank goodness for resort credit!).  Just getting a single slice might not be that bad, but it can get pricey if you're hungry.  If you're with friends, you might be better off splitting a pie ($20-$30) or simply dining in for the full menu (which looks pretty good, I might add).

While I would otherwise round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS based on taste, I'm rounding down only because of the price.  Five50 is nice addition to ARIA's collection of restaurants, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try the full menu, but I don't know if I would come back to grab just a slice unless I had resort credit or if I was in a pinch.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,15,14,3,Fn9JzXkJaiWZ4zvrPpDbIA

- Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) from the movie ""Threesome""

I originally came for the 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm and ended up with dinner.  The bar was packed when we rolled in at 5:20 but fortunately a couple of guys were leaving. 

My wife and I probably wouldn't have come here had it not been for this phenomenal deal on brew.  The reviews have been mixed at best and since there are now some pretty legit spots for pizza in LV, I wasn't exactly rushing to try any of this at strip prices.  

The only thing that was pretty consistent with all the reviews was how good the crust was.  If that's the star of the whole damn pie, I figured I would just be screwing it up by adding things like truffle, clams, rosemary or broccoli rabe.  We went with their margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil) with extra cheese.  I definitely wasn't getting good value since all the other pizzas with toppings were only $1-$5 more but we did have 8 beers for 50 cents each so that justified my whole deal.  

The sauce was sweeter than usual which surprised me upon first bite but it worked.  Cheese was cheese and basil was basil and that was all just a vehicle for the crust.  The crust was really good.  I like it a little well done and there was a good balance of chewy and crunchy.

oh look, something floating in my drink! oh wait, it's not floating, it appears to be swimming. oh dear...

our waitress was young and super sweet, i honestly feel she meant well, however clearly still learning the way of her industry,  as she was not the smoothest in handling this situation.. situation being: a tiny green insect swimming around in a customer's beverage. rather than apologize for this disturbing and perhaps anomaly of a circumstance, it became somewhat of a confessional, in which we were informed that she hears insect complaints on the daily and the restaurant is constantly having to spray.. and it's a huge problem. apparently the bugs are coming in via the fruits and other produce. 

had the waitress just apologized, replaced my drink, and perhaps docked 30% off the bill, this review would not be written. instead i was given TMI, left somewhat mortified, hoped the insect problem was local to that restaurant only..

Went to Five50 for lunch. Had a slice of the Gotham pizza. It was pepperoni, sausage and some other meats. The meats, cheese and sauce were all great. Especially the sauce. They should bottle and sell the sauce.

You might notice I didn't include the crust.

The crust was, well, crusty. And too much so. Maybe as an Italian I am just too picky about my pizza, but I like crust that you can fold in half, New York style. This crust was just hard and really distracted from what was otherwise an amazing slice of pizza.

Fix the crust and you have guaranteed 5-star pizza.

Service was also good and the pricing was good for being in a 5-star Vegas resort. I think it was $5.50 for a slice and it was a good sized slice.

The first time, we sat at the bar before seeing Zarkana. It was a busy night and the service was a bit slow, but friendly. Not a big deal - we planned quite enough time before the show and weren't in a rush.

We shared everything:

Garlic Knots ($6): Great portion and huge knots. Really tasty.

Beer Mac 'n Cheese ($12 - half order): Again, good portion size and really good - the prosciutto is a nice touch.

Chef's Selection Charcuterie (6 for $28): I know it seems pricey, but man was it worth it! They were not stingy with the meat/cheese and we actually got to choose the 6 we wanted. We went with both Burrata and Buffalo Mozzarella, as well as the Humbodlt Fog. For meats we had Mortadella, Soppressata and Prosciutto. Everything was really fresh and SO SO good. i would definitely order this again and it was perfect for sharing.

Finally we got the Gotham pizza ($28): Also pricey, but we both really enjoyed it. It had pepperoni, salami and sausage. 

We ended up with way too much food and were stuffed. They also have good drink specials - I thought the prices for the beer/shot combos were really good and they have a great selection of beers.

The 2nd time I dined there, I just grabbed a quick slice from the slice counter. The great thing is that the counter is open until 3 AM on Fri/Sat. It was just $5.95 for a HUGE slice of pizza and it was really good. This time I got the ""Forager,"" which has whitesauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta and spinach. I've been dreaming about this slice ever since.

Overall, it fits a certain ""niche,"" it's connected to the Race & Sports Book and can be considered a fast casual experience. Or you can grab a slice on your way back to your room - both are great options. I'll definitely be back soon!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,2,4,SQe0tYRrsJFs-LKSgNIWag

5736205,2013-09-26,3,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Pizza, renowned chef, located in my fav LV  hotel...what's not to like? I'll get to that shortly.

I guess the name comes from the ideal temp to cook a pie in the oven. What I will say is it made for a comical exchange between me and concierge to see if we could get a reservation:

[Curtains part, our hero stands outside in sunny SoCal in front of a non-descript office building filled with boring ass people.]

""[Man answers phone] Hello, mlife concierge, how may I help you today?""
""Hi, can I book a reservation at Five50?""
""Certainly sir - which restaurant?""
""Five50.""
""Yes sir, but which dining establishment?""
""Er, Five50?""
""[A slight undertone of frustration is sensed in the man's voice] Yes sir, but which of our restaurants are you inquiring about?""
""Five50! The new pizza joint you guys opened a few months ago.""
""[Sincere apologetic tone] Ohhh, I'm so sorry sir - of course, I'll look into that for you right away.""

[Camera cuts to the man and our hero sitting opposite each other in front of a raging, elegant fireplace in matching burgundy leather armchairs, toasting glasses of finely aged scotch whiskey and laughing heartily as they reminsce about the good ol' days and that one time when the hero called to make a reservation. End scene.]

So I made that last part up but yeah, no reservation needed. ANYWHO.

Layout of the restaurant is cool, and the divider from the casino floor is made out of wooden blocks stacked on the ends of one another so not to fret, you can still peek through and people watch, i.e. dudes can still oogle at girls dressed to the nines (I myself wouldn't partake in such an activity as a gentleman but good info for the rest of you dogs out there - you get a pass since it's LV after all) ;) Plenty of space so you're not elbowing the table next to you.

Meatballs were really good and garnished with arugula and radish; tender and yummy. Calimari was okay...a little too much flour and fairly greasy. Real disappointment was the pizza; we got the Forager which had mushrooms, ricotta, brussel sprouts and something else but there was clearly a thick layer of oil on top of the cheese; don't think I've ever witnessed oil as a topping, even at fine pizza places such as Pizza Hut or Dominos. I mean, it was so bad the crust was almost translucent...that's just nasty and sloppy work imo. Speaking of the crust, it was baked too long so it was hard to bite into; maybe this place should consider a name change to Five00? I will say the pizza tasted excellent overall, a bit too cheesy and rich for me (lol @ diets), but the flavors were all present and intermingled well.

Service was good, though our server was an awkward little deer which was kinda cute and endearing - I'll chalk it up to Five50 being relatively new.

I'm definitely down to give it another whirl, but please, do something about the oil - think of the children! Price is fair for what you're getting, and c'mon, you're balling it up at a pizza joint in Vegas. Watch out Cosmo Secret Pizza, there's a new player in town. And other than the slightly confusing name, it could give you a run for your money and potentially be a future jackpot spot for pizza lovers.

I ordered the clam pizza and am sorry I did. The only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. You had to scrape them out yourself. I would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. Furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. Lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. They were hard to see. Thus, there were 2-3 bites I literally has to spit out as I was chewing clam shells. 

When I pointed this out to the waitress Amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. She even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. Despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate.

We got appetizers of the fried calamari and the pigs and truffles, i didn't really like the calamari, it was just too much batter and hardly any actual squid.  I did like the pigs and truffles- the spinach was delicious underneath and the sauce they use just brought everything together really well.  Don't be fooled though because it's actually quite small, at least for $24

We ordered the Gotham and the Forager.  I was definitely a huge fan of the forager, the cheese was cooked to perfection, deliciousness in every bite, i did wish that they had a bit more of the mushroom though.   Gotham is definitely for the meatlovers, it's pretty good too but a bit greasy compared to the Forager, but both definitely worth trying.

5763419,2014-01-13,4,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"REAL RATING: 2.5 stars

I love Vegas. I also believe everyone else does too. You'll often meet people who say they're over it or hate it, however, I believe they're obsessed with it deep down inside. Vegas brings back a lot of great memories - birthdays, bachelor parties, weekend getaways with past girlfriends, taking a roadtrip out there with some of my closest friends, etc. It's one of the few standing places in the world where you can go and do, literally, whatever you want, whenever you want. I've grown to appreciate Vegas more and more with age. 

However, one thing I don't like about Vegas is how much the restaurants located on The Strip rip you off - average food at a below average quality. Everybody, I introduce you to Five50 Pizza Bar. 

This was my last meal in Vegas during my most recent trip. I was out there for CES (Consumer Electronics Show). A few of my buddies and I decided to have dinner here before my 8pm flight because we were all extremely hungover. Something carby, cheesy and greasy sounded good - PIZZA! Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Aria Hotel and Casino, I thought this place would really impress. However, like many of my Strip dining experiences, I was incredibly underwhelmed. 

SHAVED PORK BELLY ""PORCHETTA"" ~ 4 stars ~ $15: Shaved apples, apple butter and celery sitting on top of a thin bed of shaved pork belly. To be honest, the first bite didn't impress me. In fact, I thought it was very bad. However, my friend convinced me to try another bite, which I did. It actually turned out to get better as I was eating it. The reason is because my first bite was dominated by apple flavors with hints of saltiness from the pork. But after another bite, my taste buds settled down the apple taste and the pork belly took over. I recommend this dish as a starter. 

FARMSTEAD PIZZA ~ 2 stars ~ $25: Proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm eggs and country olives. Look, if you're going to charge 25 bucks for, essentially, a medium sized pizza with only six slices, it better be awesome. Where Five50 falls flat on their face is their crust. They claim they're a spin on East Coast style pizza, but it's so far from that. The crust was flimsy and doughy. Another thing that sucked? It was WAY to salty. Proscuitto, olives and cheese? Yeah, it was a sodium bomb! The eggs were runny but damn was it salty! I must have downed three glasses of water with each slice. I had to eat it though. My body was in dire need of food. 

The worst part about Five50 was the service. This is a little surprising considering they market themselves as an upscale pizza joint in the middle of a high-end casino and resort. Our server would literally drop our plates and flatware on the table, not gently place them in front of us. He was spilling everywhere when pouring our water. What pissed me off the most is that he didn't even apologize for anything. He wasn't cool. In fact, he was a total douche. I hope he chokes on something (it's Monday, I'm kind of in a foul mood. You gotta excuse me.).",CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A,6,5,3,2x6xz5mEeankvxi3gfBt_w

The Patriots are playing (and losing to) the Kansas City Chiefs, I've been eating rich seafood for the past couple of days, and all I want is to toss back a Moscow Mule and eat a slice of pie (with more seafood on it lol).  We got some wings and the North Beach pizza.

Those wings are ridiculously good.  I didn't even think I wanted wings at first but I'm glad they were ordered.  Perfectly fried, enough vinegar for a decent pucker, and the sauce had a nice steady heat. 

The North Beach Pizza [Clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano - ""An Italian immigrant neighborhood, the home of Marilyn and Joe Dimaggio, the cradle of the beatnik movement, and a delectable pizza inspired by the heritage of the north bay.""]: This pie was also delicious.  Served hot from the oven with a delicious grey char on the crust.  I was hoping for a white sauce but it worked well with the sweet tomato sauce.  The sweetness from the tomatoes complimented the sweetness of the clams.  I would still rather have clam pizza with white sauce though.  The pizza was foldable without dropping any toppings and easy to chow down.  We ended up boxing the leftovers to eat cold the next morning.

5863132,2013-09-10,2,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"This pizzeria has been open for about 2 months.  Decided to come here after much hype.

Good selection of beer--Intl & domestic--but not quite extensive as a Yardhouse...  Good wine options for a pizzeria, alas I don't drink wine with my pizza.  From 5 - 6pm, they have happy hour and offer 50 cents for a glass of selected draft beer.  The establishment picked up at 5pm....

My party opted to have an appetizer.  At the recommendation of the uber-friendly bartender, we ordered the wood-fired clams & linguica sausage.  Clams cooked in a buttery broth.  Came with bread with baked on tomato and cheese.  Load up sausage, onions, and potato on the bread.  This works well after finishing the clams.

For our pizza, we chose the Gotham.  Your traditional American pizza...  The crust was extra crispy and thin-thin--just the way I like it.  Given a choice, I would prefer the butteriness of JJ Dolan's crust though.  Generous cheese and zesty tomato sauce on the pizza.

Every trip to Vegas, I try a new pizza joint.  I have to rank Five50 my #3 pizza in Vegas after Secret Pizza and Project Pie.  I would rate here #4 if I could remember the name of a small mom & pop pizzeria next to a liquor store about a mile down the strip.  That pizza was superb with a crumby & crunchy crust.  But not to digress away from Five50, the pizza here is worth trying.  Is it a must-stop for vegas?  Not sure about that...",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,3,3,4,19dczTqO0KP0Z-5SmqFTdA

""The chef has decided he won't serve you pizza by the slice.""  Why not?  Well, it could be so that I would pay $40 for a whole pizza even though I only wanted one slice.

Also, ""the chef?""  It's a pizza place. Pretentious much?

But the pasta was good, wasn't it?  Sadly, no. It was ""ok.""

Overall opinion: As is tradition for me when trying a new pizza place for the first time, I had the Margherita pizza. It was delicious, and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. My only issue is the value proposition, which cost it a 5th star.  They only offer one size (16""), which is too much for one person, but not enough for two, and they run around the $30 range. It was a great pizza, but should have been at least $10 less.  Because of the price of the pizza, I didn't get one of the delicious sounding milkshakes on the menu.  I would have ended up spending close to $50 for one person on a light meal.

Bonus:  Located at Aria Resort in Las Vegas, this is the only location and is headed by James Beard Award-winning Chef Shawn McClain.",1Lh1ZVjBeliwP4E3CDb1UA,0,0,4,Lw3QlR9N5guLB4tqtsgbMQ

5918865,2013-07-18,3,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"I was really excited when I heard there was going to be a new pizza restaurant opening up in Aria.  So I dropped in to check out this new pizza joint at Aria called Five50 with a friend after work. It is the second restaurant opened by Chef Shawn McClain (Sage) at Aria, so the expectation of excellent food was high.

The Five50 name seems strange, but according to them is the ideal temperature for cooking your pizza in the oven (so is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?). And until just last week, 5:50pm was the start of their Happy Hour and the promotion was 50 cents beer.  Now HH is from 5PM to 5:50pm (is it still considered a happy HOUR if it only lasts 50 minutes).  $5.50 might also be the starting price of their pizza by the slice (don't hold to it in case I am mistaken, but it would fit the pattern of this gimmicky name). 

The restaurant is beautifully designed.  It looks great from the outside, although the ""VIP"" area near the back and by that ""wall"" is just too cramp to be fully functional.

Service was friendly and efficient. Since the restaurant is still new, it also appears that they have way more staff on duty than are needed.  Will be interesting to see if the staffing level will remain at current level in 2-3 months.  

After looking over the menu, which is mostly a beverage menu (the entire outside cover of the menu is the wine, beer, etc menu), while the inside menu consist of Snacks (5 items), Small Plates (your upscale appetizers), Salads, Pastas, Meat & Cheese, and the 8 pizza selections or you can customize your own.

Tried the Forager Pizza (Mushrooms, Spinach, Rosemary, Whipped Ricotta) and it was good. The pizza crust was the star, while the toppings were quality it was also  not exactly generous.  If I was hungry and didn't have a late lunch, I can totally finish this 16"" pizza myself and not break a AYCE sushi coma sweat.  So it was not even a challenge to split it with another person.

If I come back I will want to try their Gotham and Truffle pizzas.  Their Small  Plates and Pasta items sound interesting too, which may actually be the more exciting offerings from Chef Shawn McClain's new pizza joint/craft beer sports bar.

Food:  3.5/5  Quality ingredients used on tasty flat bread pizza, part of the overall tasty crunchy crust was sadly burnt.

Creativity:  2.5/5  Nothing that I have not already seen done somewhere else.  Considering the talent of a chef that bested an American Iron Chef, I know this place has way more to offer in this department. 

Price/Value:  3/5  Casino pricing for the convenience of not having to walk or take a cab somewhere else.  If you want better value for your dining dollars, get a panini sandwich from Jean Philippe Patisserie (in Aria and Bellagio).

Service: 3/5  Never had bad experience from any of the wait staff at Aria, but waitstaff could be better trained on what is offered on the menu.  Are breadsticks complimentary? If so, we didn't get any while we waited for the pizza.

Decor:  3.5/5  Hip, upscale decor with dim lighting that fits the overall darker color scheme of Aria (not my style preference, but I just like the brighter more energetic look of other interior decorator's executed vision more).

A-OK and perfect for guests in Aria and CityCenter complex.

5949391,2013-10-03,0,UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,"Came here after soaking up the sun in the Aria where we were staying in las vegas.  We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).

We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).

I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.

So for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.",RL1QQZ0EhFnvOQVTeT0wHg,0,0,2,Gd55rs8_n0RzxMC7aoVJPw
