The food at DJT...disappointing!  Your house wine is just ok. I ordered the lamb and ...YUK!  Had to send it back. Which I don't do often. Replaced it with the 6oz filet. Which was simply mediocre. How hard is it to by decent meat and cook it well?  NOT hard. For $36 for lamb, you'd better know how to cook it. c'mon!!

My husband and I just returned from Vegas and dined there on our last night in town.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess was gracious and seated us right away.  We had a lovely view of the restaurant and were treated to the sounds of a singer  and piano wafting in from the bar.  The decor was quite swanky and we were pleasantly surprised to find there was no casino in the building.
The waiter immediately brought menus and took our drink orders.  We pondered the offerings and finally settled on a rabbit and tortellini appetizer to share, salads and then went over the main menu selections.  While there was not a long list to chose from, all of the offerings sounded good.  I ordered a double pork chop, braised cabbage with bacon and whipped sweet potatoes.  Hubby went with the beef tenderloin, fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  We were not disappointed.  The meal was awesome! I seriously believe it was the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  We were so impressed that the waiter brought out the chef to meet us.
The wait staff was very attentive.  My water never got half empty and they were so polite.  While the dinner, with 4 cocktails and no dessert cost close to $200, in my mind it was well worth it.  We have a great memory of Las Vegas and had a real dining experience.   We will surely go again when we return to Sin City.",TxeYIVkvV5Rh0rGAlKGgbw,1,1,5,YF5PTQVeetUzYslPh5oc9w

Food: 5

Decor: 5
Other: 5

So, I normally reserve my 5-star rating for a place that has impressed me more than once.  However, I will bend my rules for this place.  Although I only dined here once, I had a number of interactions with the restaurant (see below).

I had high expectations for DJT since the three Yelpers who had previously posted about it all gave it 5 stars.  Normally, when I have high expectations for anything, I find myself disappointed.  However, DJT did not disappoint!

I found the whole experience, from making a reservation, to changing my reservation (more than once), to the warm welcome at the restaurant, to the food, to be as impressive as expected, if not more so.  When we arrived, 5 minutes before our scheduled reservation, our table was ready and waiting for us.  We didn't have to wait for 5 minutes or anything like that, and the hostess was expecting our party.

The possible negatives are that the Trump International is off the strip and that it does not have a casino.  However, it may be because of these facts that the hotel focuses more on presenting a superior quality dining experience at DJT.

All around, I was thoroughly satisfied, and I definitely expect that I will become a repeat patron over future visits to Las Vegas.",kwDumMrsKlljbUBBaZI52g,1,1,5,xHBJQAbkJ9FFdxhKyh0m-w

How should I put this.  The juiciest part of the last minute get-away, I think, had to have been the burger from DJT - the restaurant located in the new Trump International Hotel.  I'm saying, on the one hand, that the mar-a-lago turkey burger, crunchy pickle and curried (""Donald Trump special seasoning"") and seasoned steak fries were no joke, standout.  I wanted to write home and cry.  

On the other hand, it's also an implication of a rather tame weekend.  Hey, don't call me a liar!  It can happen.  Sure, it's Vegas, the City of Sodom and Gomorrah, where vagrants and degenerates battling clinical addictions with last weekend's poker chips still buried in their pockets fly solo to fade into the background.  (""Sir, I don't mind so much your musk of ashtray and sweat and vodka, but you are 5'1'' and I have no idea why your little elbows and knees require so much room that they must dominate my seat as well."")

So sorry to disappoint, babe.  We are classy (old) ladies -- the few found that weekend without teeny weeny tank tops obscenely stretched thin just barely over our buns*.  You were there with us in spirit though, especially when we spotted a softer Clive Owen-type displaying his package in speedos.  You would have had him for lunch.  For sure.

Next time!  You and your bewitching dimples are coming with us.  Let's make sure to retain a good attorney and have that phone call ready.

We were in a rush to get to XS, so settled for DJT in the Trump Hotel (where we stayed). Service, ambiance were classy & impeccable. There weren't too many people (weeknight), so we got a private booth. Booth comes with covers that you can pull to cover the whole party. Very intimate and waiters are super nice to be courteous as to not interrupt anything. 


Everyone ordered their prix fixe (~$35 for app, entree  & dessert). 

starters: we had starter bread. bread was cool to the touch but had several choices: rosemary, french, olive. Favorite was the olive one. 

apps: a simple salad with sliced tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar. fresh salads are a win win in my book. 

Main Dish: 
--Shrimp w/ halibut w/ a side of salad: Large fresh shrimp with a nice sized slice of halibut. Pretty good, but on the salty side. 

-Steak n fries: Pretty standard aside from the steak being too salty. They did do the medium rare sear perfectly, though. 

-Scallops: Apologies for forgetting what sauce it was in but overall the scallop was fairly well with minimal charring. The cream sauce it was in 
was overwhelming though. 

Dessert:
Brulee w/ berries -- they gave one on the house. The brulee was so creamy and yummy. It's a simple dessert, but one done well. 

Overall.. okay. I think it tries a little too hard to be something that it isn't - e.g. fancy high end dishes (but not actually offering really unique items). However, if you're in a pinch to go somewhere and you're staying at the Trump, then DJT isn't a bad choice.",9akppeqi5dnaIqPyJ75aCw,2,2,3,hz1wg_pMmN6PB5Zfq6q9Ng

Note - I was here for business and experienced both Dinner & Lunch....

Before I dive into the not so great - let's chat about what was right:
The ambiance, decor and service was supreme.  In fact, the waiter actually comped us our dessert b/c our entrees weren't up to par (which was a good sign)   The wine selection was also pretty good... The one saving grace was the DJT burger at lunch - a total heartattack - but absolutely wonderful - (think 2 grilled cheeses as the bun for your burger w/criss cut fries as a side - oh so freaking good! - the Donald would definitely approve!) The Trump Hotel is spectacular in itself - it's so luxurious and five star that i'm so surprised the food was sub-par.

Now onto NOT making the cut.... -- Dinner was odd.  I'm unsure what to make of DJT's whole menu as it appears to have quite an asian flare.  The eggs rolls, tempura shrimp & apps were fine - nothing too special - which is my theme for this review.  The watermelon & caprese salad just just OK as well.  the biggest downer was our entrees- As for most of the group - our food was overdone.  The halibut with curry sauce was tough - and the Duck Confit (which btw is apparently DJT's favorite thing to order according to our waiter) was also very dry --  what killed me was the mozarella eggroll that was paired with my duck - wtf? it was odd.. very very odd. The steak was apparently OK but nothing really special. The dessert might have saved the evening.  The free panna cotta w/fresh berries was very good but the chocolate dessert option was also a little dry.   Bottom line -  nothing was spectacular - at least not what the Donald would love anyway...  It's hotel food at its best.  It'll do if you are staying at the hotel - but it might  best to take one of the free shuttles to the Wynn or Caesars for a real meal...",ZGgheWqp5TbGsNLt5lze5w,2,0,2,ecCtDfllYp9aCn02b0jvSg

It is apparent that the staff has been highly trained for even the most classical of French service but they manage to keep it friendly and down to earth.

The quality of the food is spectacular and equals perhaps the more famous named restaurants in Las Vegas. 

This time I went for breakfast. I was seated immediately and was told I could choose my own table. The second I sat down my waiter was already asking if I would like juice, coffee or water or all three. 

I decided on the Smoked Salmon on a bagel. The platter is better prepared than you would experience at a classic Jewish deli. A giant everything bagel (my choice), chive infused cream cheese, capers, chopped red onion, tomatoes, a hard boiled egg and at least half a pound of beautiful and delicious smoked salmon. 

The price was so reasonable for the quality and the quantity of the food that I realized I might pay more for just the salmon at a deli take out counter.\

I enjoyed a special, quiet and elegant breakfast that felt more like I was being served at home then at DJTs. Bravo to the management and staff for getting the entire dining experience just right.",n0mvVYcr4FR5l4Jh7B-dFg,0,0,5,ev39BJR8ksQsvAf-3dxejA

Trump cut half of the staff at the restaurant because the demand for a finer dining establishment wasn't there.

It was a very empty restaurant and we witnessed the hostess tell a group of three that she cannot seat them in the restaurant and they would have to be sat out in the bar!  To which the lady in the group promptly replied absolutely not....  Ha!   Hostess was very flustered and finally seated us with our menu but no wine or drink list, I  had to ask twice for a wine list before receiving it.  Then the waitress gets my boyfriends drink and doesn't get mine to which I have to order and ask for it again.  The menu for what is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant had a buffalo wing appetizer.  While I like them just not as a fine dining option.  Your steak comes automatically with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables, no other sides to choose from that is it.  For dinner I ordered the Wagyu burger which came cold and the cheese wasn't even melted it was like they stuck it on as an afterthought.  My boyfriend ordered the Filet and it came out well done with 3 random globs of mashed potatoes (wished I took a picture of this crazy plate).  One blob of mashed potatoes was smashed flat into the plate drizzled with some sort of sauce on it and the other 2 blobs of potatoes had the zucchini added into the mashed potatoes!  They literally took the vegetable and mixed it into the mashed potatoes. Very interesting.....  We sent everything back and left the restaurant asap and went to Del Frisco's Steakhouse and had an amazing Valentines dinner with fantastic service!  We are locals and will never go back or recommend we are also in the Concierge industry and will never recommend unfortunately.  The staff was not up to par for a fine dining restaurant.

We didn't want to travel far to get breakfast our last day at the hotel so after looking at the menu, we decided to try the restaurant at the Trump.  I know it's hard to mess up breakfast food but our breakfasts here were really great.

I ordered classic eggs benedict with country potatoes ($15) and a side of minted chopped fruit ($8).  The bf ordered the American breakfast ($14) with egg whites, toast, hashbrowns and choice of meat - in this case, spam!  

The American was quite good...egg whites were not overly greasy or buttery here & the hashbrowns were perfect - really crunchy on the outside, super soft inside.  I know that spam seems like a weird choice but we never see it on a menu so he ordered it and it was actually very well prepared here.

The eggs benedict were great!   I hate when it's drenched in hollaindaise BUT here they put it on the side - I love that!  Eggs were perfectly poached and I dipped each bite in the hollandaise - yum!  The country potatoes were thinly sliced potatoes cooked with chives and were very good.  The fruit did not have the mint taste I was hoping for but they did chop the fruit into tiny bite size pieces which I love.

It was a good breakfast but I do have one problem - I ordered a cranberry juice with ice and it cost $7!!  Usually, my restaurant rule is to just order water but I felt like a juice and I certainly paid the price for that - a small cup of juice should not cost half the price of my entree - so ridiculous!  

Besides the hefty juice price tag, everything was great.  Food here was great & I would come here again if I stayed in the hotel.",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,2,1,4,Tc97ULthv2YDHPahsV_JXA

Their breakfasts are also wonderful, pricey, but I ate there every morning during my 5 night stay - the service was outstanding and Trump is one of the best hotels I've stayed at.

We started with the 5 hour Kurobuta Braised Pork Belly. The pork belly was fine, but the blue corn meal pancakes were mushy and incredibly salty. So much so, that it made the entire dish impossible to eat (it was integrated into the entire dish).
I ordered the chestnut papperdelle, the texture of which was so off-putting ,that all I could bear to do was pick at the small pieces of pork on my plate. The surface of the pasta was dry and hard, but the inside of the pasta was all too mushy. 
My mom got the miso braised black cod, which just disintegrated when she pierced it with a fork. Inedible, hated the texture.
My brother chose the rack of lamb, which, though ordered rare, was served medium well. Curry flavor was also too strong. 
The list goes on...

There was just an egregious flaw in every item we ordered. Though the menu looked appealing, execution of each dish was an outright failure.

Lastly, the bill totaled over $700 for a party of 9, entirely too much for what ended up being a completely sh*t meal.",6Ya_TDoU8jQcGc3hxeHcdg,1,2,1,QVFRhlFde1GYdMOscWbNOQ

Apparently these ""mar-a-lago turkey burgers"" are only available for in-suite dining but we were lucky enough to try them this afternoon! (see my posted pix!)

they tasted as good as I had hoped and maybe even better! the ground turkey burger had so much flavor (special ingredients include chopped celery and granny smith apples and chipotle tabasco) and is served on a delcious brioche-like hamburger bun with generous slices of fresh avocado and a side of seasoned fries. YUM!

for the actual recipe, go here:

the bf also had the chelsea cocktail which includes fresh blackberries, mint leaves, sugar can 10 rum, and club soda. that drink was so refreshing and tasty that he ordered it twice.  even the bar snacks were addicting -- the bowl of wasabi covered gobi berries were our favorite.

We decided to check out the new Trump Hotel in Vegas since it was right across from the Wynn, where we were staying for the weekend.  We found out that the DJT was the only restaurant they had here but, since time was very limited with our imminent departure to the airport, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat here anyway.

Let me first say that service was impeccable with our waiter kind and friendly despite the fact that only half of our party of 6 even had anything to eat (the other 3 had breakfasted a few hours earlier)   My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the panini.   While I suppose the sandwich I got could qualify as a panini, it certainly was  not much better to the sandwiches you can pick up at Safeway.   Worse still, the french fries were simply fucking atrocious.   I don't know if these are fries the way ""The Don"" likes them, but they plain simply fucking sucked.   I'll take microwaveable frozen-aisle tater tots any day over these repugnant pieces of reconstituted potato sticks.

I'm going to stop there before I prolong the torture... Let's just say that I won't be eating here ever again and you probably should avoid it too if you have a palate.

A very thin layer of skin was left on the breast and it was cooked exactly perfectly (can you say that?  whatever, I am :)).  It was juicy and tender.  Mixed with the cheesy risotto/orzo (again, sorry, I'm not a foodie AT ALL) and mushrooms underneath, it was heaven.  I wanted more although the portion was just right.  The bread that came out before the meal was delicious as well and wasn't too much or over-powering so that we didn't have room for our actual meal.
We sat in a booth that has a curtain so if we had wanted privacy, we could have closed it.  But the place was pretty quiet so it wasn't necessary.  The servers were all wonderful and super friendly and helpful.  We were almost full so for dessert we just went with the Ice Cream Sundae.  Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream with fruit on top and whipped cream.  Simple but delicious and I'd get it again.

Lobby bars are the crossroads of the hotel, and usually a great place to chill and watch the neverending Vegas tragedy. The lobby bar at the Trump is more tragic than fun, though...kind of like sitting at a lobby bar on a Sunday night in Moldova, three days after the apocalypse, when the liquor supply's running low and the few surviving hookers are glowing with radioactivity.

I was here on a Saturday night, on a very busy weekend, so the place should have been jamming. Instead, I found a cavernous, bedazzled lobby strewn with a few tired married couples sitting in shitty, flimsy banquet hall chairs, sipping coffee from paper cups, listening to the creepy lounge duo croon adult contemporary schlock.

I sat at the bar proper (no shitty banquet chair for me) and ordered a $9 vodka cranberry. The other bar customers included a few cognac-swirling, cardigan-wearing, eerily sedate Irish bachelor party-goers, and one crazy New Age prostitute who was boring the bartender with talk of astrophysics, positive thinking, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which she was allegedly reading. Neither one seemed interested in starting up a conversation... so I finished my drink and bailed. 

Verdict: maybe I just hit it on a bad night, but it wasn't much fun. Better hotel lobby bars are to be found at MGM Grand (Zuri), Caesars Palace (Galleria), and my favorite, the Petrossian Bar at Bellagio.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,3,3,3,ucIsWO1VUc8T6LN1uL3f1A

This restaurant is located within the Trump Hotel. Since we were already staying at Trump and didn't want to venture out for food, the group of 9 of us ate lunch here. 

Throughout the entire lunch, service was extremely SLOW. There weren't many guests at the restaurant and the wait staff seemed to be standing around a lot of the time as if they weren't working. We waited a long time for our water/coffee to come, and even longer for our food to come. The service was pretty terrible as the staff seemed rude and even disengaged. They came to our table a total of 3 times (once to take our order, once to serve water/coffee and once to serve our food). 

The food here was mediocre but definitely not worth the price tag. A burger was $18, but definitely did not taste that great to justify the price. I would NOT recommend this place, even if you were looking for something convenient.

I made reservations for three on a Sunday night for 6:30. I understand that this is not the prime time for dining in Vegas but this joint was Dead with capital D; no reservations would have been needed. 

The menu had some tantalizing choices, among them a $29 prix fixe which my two coworkers went for and seemed to be pleased with. I on the other hand, was seriously disappointed. I ordered the caesar salad--just fine, nothing amazing, and the pasta which was a carbonara cream sauce with cured meat. My pasta was so salty it was inedible. I understand that this type of pasta is going to be salty but this made my blood pressure skyrocket and my hands swell so much my rings started to cut off my circulation--after only six bites (I tried!). Absolutely disgusting, and I LOVE salt; I couldn't eat it. 

Our server (if you can call him that--another bus-person/server brought all of the food/drinks out and cleared all of the plates) kindly removed the offending dish from the bill but only after trying to patronize me by saying the dish is salty by nature (duh, dude but you taste it and tell me it is supposed to taste like a salt lick).

So I asked the hostess if we can switch to the booths and she told us that those were normally for larger groups. But then, these two ladies came after us and they were seated in the booths. WTH man!!!  When our server came, we decided to asked him if we can move to a booth. He went to check with the front and came back and moved us. The seating was definitely better and more comfortable at the booth. Kudos to our server!!! Nice fella and recommended some great wine.  

I ordered the prix fix meal for $29 and my boyfriend ordered the 28 day aged prime rib filet. 

My prix fix meal came with a hamachi crudo dish which was excellent. It was very good..my favorite course of the dinner. For my entree, I ordered the duck confit over squash. This was a good dish but a little bit on the salty side. For dessert, I had creme brulee.. it was good but  the portion was very small. I was also able to try some of my boyfriend's steak and it was pretty decent but definitely not one of the best steaks I have had. 

The wines that we had were the Brazin red zinfandel and the Justin Cabernet. Both were very excellent wines.

We decided to have dinner here because we were tired from the long days work and wanted to eat quickly.  We arrived at 8:05pm.  After about 15 min we were finally greeted by a staff member.  (The bus boy).  Our sever was busy with a large party so the manager came over to help (although we didn't know she was the manager).  We ordered two glasses of wine and asked about specials. After 20 min we asked the bus boy to get the manager.  She came back over and said she was still looking for one of our wines. (Which is one of the cheaper wines.  It could have been substituted for another wine.).   We ordered a soup and salad and pork tenderloin as the main course all to share and asked for some bread since we had now been sitting for 45 min.  We were brought bread which was was on par with the roadside diner certainly not a five-star restaurant. At about 9:05PM our salad soup and tenderloin were brought out at the same time however it was cold.   We kept the arugula salad which was very good but sent back the rest. At 9:20pm the soup came back however it appeared to have been microwaved based on the cooked edges and the hotspots. Although despite this it did taste good.   At 9:55 PM for tenderloin came back out which was only okay as it was very very peppery. The black pepper flavor overpowered every other flavor in the dish.   It was also rather small.  The chocolate mousse was very good and arrived at 10:24 with our check. We were billed for the salad and the soup.   It was 10:33 when we finally received our check billed to room.  

If you're looking for a quick bite and you're staying at the Trump do youself favor and catch a cab to any other restaurant in the city.  If you just want to have a glass of wine or drink and eat dessert this restaurant can accommodate you.

No dessert here...we went to the Carnegie Deli for a disappointing cheesecake...oh well.
The entree's were well prepared and nicely presented. Sometimes I think the essence of fine dining is simple food, well prepared and tasty, presented nicely in delightful surroundings, and DJT does a good job of that.
The service was very good, and everyone in the restaurant seemed anxious to please, going out of their way to say ""hello"", and smile.

Excellent dish, not the best I've ever had but it was very good. Mum & I aren't fond of risotto but was able to substitute for sautéed spinach instead. Brussel sprouts also isn't something I would pair with salmon but the way it was prepared was appealing. Balsamic added zest and flavour.

-Steak & Frites $39 (medium rare)
12 oz NY steak, thyme and garlic infused double roasted potatoes, Beaujolais sauce

Dad didn't seemed to mind the steak being a bit rare for his likings.

-Turkey Club $18
Applewood smoked bacon, Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, Hass avocado mayo, toasted sourdough

Served with an unsalted golden brown fries. I can't comment on this one since I didn't have a taste of the sandwich. It did looks really good though.

-French Onion Soup $10
Melted Gruyere, herb croutons

Mum & Dad both enjoyed this one as a starter. Repeatedly stating how tasty it was every time they take a bite.
