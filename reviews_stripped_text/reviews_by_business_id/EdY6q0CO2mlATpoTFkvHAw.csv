271328,2013-11-12,0,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"I'm Asian and I've eaten at many dim sum restaurants, and this is my take on the Dim Sum Cafe: 

The variety of dim sum dishes is good. You might think that this restaurant doesn't carry as much variety as other dim sum restaurants, but that is because this restaurant only has several carts circulating around the restaurant at any given time, so it looks like there is less choices.  However, they do not have the more traditional dim sum houses choices like preserved duck-egg congee and tofu/ginger.

The quality of dim sum is good. Thumbs up for taste & freshness. No difference in portion size, and dishes were not greasy. The chicken steamed buns were a bit dry & doughy, but all other choices were excellent.

Price is comparable to other dim sum restaurant. Our check for 4 was the same as other dim sum places.

No pushy dim sum cart lady coming by every minute disturbing your meal. The cart comes out maybe 2-3 times total in the whole meal. Only a few of the staff is Asian, which is OK because the non-Asian staff appeared to be knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive. This might be a good dim sum starter restaurant for those who want decent dim sum but don't want the hustle of Chinatown.

The decor is clean with some fish aquariums, but there is absolutely nothing Asian about it. You wouldn't know you're in an Asian restaurant and thought you were in a really clean Denny's. Perhaps restaurant management can put a couple of inexpensive Asian-like items (lanterns, bamboo, red color, etc) to be consistent with the restaurant's name.

Crazy menu needs to be refined. What is with the hamburger and sandwiches? Not sure why they feel the need to stick American breakfast stuff and other items in the menu, and why customers will go to a dim sum restaurant to get American food.  This is very confusing and gives the impression that management does not know what they are doing.  

Their dim sum is good, it's also the name of the restaurant, so they should clean up the menu and stick to what they do well...dim sum!",5jgGp15H_0GRS_daM2AC7A,4,2,4,v9PqnAnxyKh3WmNZUZql3w

Of course, I skimmed through the reviews on yelp before heading here and seems like most people took off stars because they don't have the carts so it's not a true dim sum experience. Well I think the quality of the food makes up for all of that! Even the beef and broccoli off the regular menu was delish! Everything from the sauce for egg roll to the steamed pork buns and rice noodles was just so tasty. Some yelpers pointed out that most dim sum places have the food out on the cart so long that it's not really fresh and some are probably even microwaved. I totally agree with them and actually really enjoyed the made-to-order freshness of the food. Best Chinese food I've had in a while!",eyFBtxkY96vrAaoQc15rHQ,3,0,5,VMOESOxsFUj7FuSTwn-1wg

came in at 1130am for sunday dim sum and ordered 10 typical dim sum selections, as the regulars of this cuisine are well aware of.

items ordered from menu, no carts...the kitchen made everything on demand based on the order ticket, which has its pros (fresh, hot and very tasty morsels) and cons (when the walk ins started coming in your order may take longer than expected). everything was well seasoned and not overly salty (leaving you with the typical MSG thirst as with other eateries)

quality and flavor are at least comparable to main Chinatown dim sum eateries in a very clean environment, courteous staff

however, I recommend coming in early for dim sum and order all your items at one time so the kitchen ticket will be prioritized before other orders that come in subsequent to yours. We ordered baked bao and after a half hour wait, told the waiter to cancel it since we were done with our meal. When he settled the bill, the brought us the order, on the house!

I personally loved my dinner here at Dim Sum Cafe. I love the location! Not on busy Spring Mountain Rd! Finally, a close Dim Sum spot by my place. The servers were really nice, all of them smiling & very helpful.

You pretty much order all the Dim Sum you want on a menu. As hungry as I was, I wish the food came out quicker but I appreciate & love the fact that they cook it & the food is not simply sitting on a cart.

I thought the food was delicious too! Not bland at all & seasoning was just right. I think the bad reviews stems from people having delicious Dim Sum outside of Vegas but think about it, we really don't have an extensive list here in town in the first place. Honestly, I think this place is underrated. The atmosphere was nice, the lighting was bright, ambiance was welcoming, seats were comfortable, the whole place was clean.. & most importantly, the food was not bad at all.

I was first excited about a dim sum place close to our Vegas house but then I was let down when I saw the menu. Their name ""Dim Sum Cafe"" implies that they know what dim sum is...but this place has little idea what they are doing.  The serving staff is predominantly non-Asian and had no clue what cheong fun noodles and traditional dim sum fare are.  I explained what I was looking for ""beef cheong fun"" and the server said they have it. When the dish arrived it was beef noodle stir fry- not even close to the flat rice noodle filled with beef, pork, or shrimp.  I ordered 2 and those plates never touched my table- I sent them back as soon as I saw them. It's like I went to a so-called hamburger stand and they had no clue what a cheeseburger is. Gawd. It took a while for them to figure out we need plates and I guess they didn't have chopsticks ready.  

$4.25 eggroll (2 pieces): you think it would be good or large for the money, right? Wrong. It seemed like they just fried some eggrolls from Ranch 99 and charged $2 a piece. Super rip-off because the eggroll was not very tasty. Adding insult to injury my kid ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and they didn't have cheddar cheese so she got a grilled mozerella sandwich. Yuck. 

Confused menu: small dim sum collection, American breakfast of oatmeal, waffles, french toast. Salads, spaghetti, and fish. 

Wait staff was slow to figure out we needed place settings and our server acknowledged that they were having many customers complaining about the menu. Restaurant was clean (it's 2 weeks new) and the TVs on the wall still had the Energy Consumption sticker on them. No fish in the tanks yet, either. 

I hope these reviews serve as a wake-up call to the owners. Vegas is not the kind of place that supports or tolerates a bad restaurant- especially one that leaves customers feeling tricked and overcharged. I would love to pay good money for good food, but this place is like its indoor wooden trellis: the structure is there but it isn't polished and leaves people asking the question ""Why?!""  I'd skip this place until they get many of the wrinkles ironed out.

We then ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special (7.95) which comes with 1 egg roll and a cup of egg drop soup. Usually the entree is spicy hot and I asked to have it toned down a bit. The soup and egg roll were very good and the Mongolian Beef was prepared just the way I requested...not too hot.

Soup dumplings, must try, they are smallish enough to pop in your mouth whole. Most places I have been to serve them much larger and accompanied by a soup spoon. I didn't mind being able to take them whole. Very good.

The eggs rolls were ok, slightly undercooked for my personal taste. I'd get them again but ask for a bit well done. 
Pork ribs my hubs loved, me not so much. If you like cartilage you will like them as there are bits of soft bone and gristle to work through. Similar in texture to chicken's feet. If that's your thing, rock in and order these. (They also have chicken feet FYI) The flavor of the meat was wonderful just not my preference. 

Hard no
Rice paper pork, no go for me. I don't like a slimy texture and even though it's normal for this dish I personally wouldn't order it again. 

I'll be back to try their regular menu items as this review is strictly dim sum menu items. Thanks again friends!",6e3oMOiqlSKX6kaEgoDjSw,1,0,4,hD2lKnJScmsE4usbuVR_LQ

Both not in Vegas and near china towns.  So I tell my friend after seeing the add on Facebook then yelping it I tell her we need to check this place out it has tons of potential for a authentic dim sum restaurant. Wow was that a great choice. No they are no carts but the made to order appeals to me more because the food is fresh and fast. The food tho! Amazing honestly we both looked at each other and had these faces of WOW! So I recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and authentic dim sum.

My favorites were the red bean sesame balls (super fluffy and chewy), the fried taro, the shrimp dumplings, and the congee. The egg tarts were delicious, I just wish they were a little bigger.

1747172,2014-09-02,3,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"This restaurant is one example of why I can't trust Yelp very much anymore.

If I were to rate this cafe, I'd give it 4.5. And like most users, that .5 stars is merely because they market themselves as dim sum, but does not have the carts to give you the ""full dim sum experience."" But you know what? Who cares if they don't have a bunch of old, middle-aged, rude Chinese women pushing your food around?

Here's the deal Yelpers, it blows my mind that most of the reviews take out so many stars or give this place a bad review because of the lack of carts. Let me inform you guys that this place serves the best dim sum food in all of Vegas (bold statement, but true.) The reason why this restaurant does not cart their food around for you is because they know they aren't located in Chinatown with millions of customers everyday, but they want to preserve the quality of their food, which is why they cook their food fresh for you. I can guarantee you that even the other great dim sum places in Vegas (Cathay House, Chang's) will sometimes microwave your food, or heat up leftovers for you to eat. 

Oh and ""how's the service?"" You might be asking. It is incredible. It may be because I came for a late lunch, but we had the most excellent service ever at any dim sum. Waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, then had kind service through my whole meal. There are simple key things that waiters and waitresses should do (say ""May I...Please... Thank You..."") I mean very basic things that most restaurants don't accomplish, but it takes you a long way. The waitress was even kind enough to hold the door open on my way out. I won't say to expect these kinds of things at peak hours, but they definitely do put a lot of care into their customers.

TL;DR don't come here if you are looking for cart pushers, come if you want some quality food.",P0Zd9BjnCgbfzsHiQFdhoA,7,2,5,RrOhgWOWjtrZz-RufdhAJw

1827669,2018-06-25,0,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"After sampling a bunch of different plates, I'm honestly surprised that their ratings weren't better. DSC will probably be my new go to for Chinese food, EVERYTHING I ordered was delish. Even as take out it was still better than most places in Vegas. The curry cream cheese rangoons were a welcome break from the normal rangoons that have so much grease you could lube your car with them. They were crispy, light and tasty. The dim sum approach of less is more definitely works here. I took one bite of the baked sweet cream buns and saved the rest for dessert. They were incredible, light, flaky with custard that wasn't too sweet or overdone inside. Just a taste was enough.
I love udon noodles and cook at home with them often, so I'm partial to this place as they don't just offer them in soup. The combo udon lo mein with shrimp, beef and chicken was perfect, not too salty or sauced with the noodles still firm and plenty of shrimp. Most chinese places try to save $$ by calling something a combo or shrimp dish and then giving you only 1 or 2 shrimp and loading it with cheaper beef or chicken. Not DSC. 
The lemon chicken was light with a bit of zest, not too sweet or drowning in sauce like many places offer. My only gripe was that I would have liked a little more sauce in it, but ordering a side of extra sauce is an easy fix.
The cashew chicken was loaded with vegetables and hot, filled with tons of chicken. While a pretty standard offering, it was done well. Bonus was that all the chicken in all the dishes was clearly white meat, firm and cooked perfectly. Almost every chinese place I've been to in this town uses dark or thigh meat that's chewy and gristly to save $$$, and it grosses me out. 
I'm extremely impressed and looking forward to eating there to get the full-on dim sum experience. All of the staff were very friendly, more than I would have expected for a take out meal.
Nothing but good things to say about them. They have very large menu that should accommodate just about any taste or flavor you can think of. Kudos.",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,0,0,5,dqb02Y73uy-nBIbu0D0HKA

1882011,2017-01-17,1,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"Sundays are for Dim Sum and when in Summerlin, I say give this place a try.

Went in for Sunday Dim Sum this past weekend and left feeling more than satisfied by my meal.

A party of 3 ordered: Beef fried rice $9.25, Snow pea leaves with garlic sauce $11.95, Chinese sausage bun (2) $3.50, Pork Shu Mai(3) $2.5, Chicken Shu Mai (3) $2.5,Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (3) $2.5, Coconut Roll (2) $2.5, Baked sweet cream bun (3) $2.5, 2 Steamed Pork spare ribs $3, Steamed Pork Dumpling (3) $3, Pork porridge with preserved egg $4

Taste: Hot, delicious, and fresh. Server recommended the snow pea leaves and they did not disappoint; I believe we will be ordering that from no won as our ""green"" for the table. Baked sweet cream bun were so good. Honestly, I could finish an entire order of 3 buns on my own.

Portions: Most dishes were portioned out for 3 pieces...perfect for a party of 3. Beef fried rice and Snow pea leaves were served family style & we were able to box up plenty to go.

Service: This was my first time ordering dim sum vs. stalking the rolling carts for specific foods. Our family size plates arrived first and were soon followed by all of our ordered dim sum in quick succession. It was nice having all of the food out on the table to choose from (as opposed to usual experiences where you are waiting on your proteins to pair up with your sides).

Menu: Well organized with prices listed. Also had a photo menu which made ordering easy, especially if you don't know what the dish is called or if you are feeling adventurous. Listing the dishes is also more food-allergy friendly. There was no question as to what each dish included (so I was able to keep my epi-pen stored).

So it's not the biggest and busiest dim sum place but it was clean the people were nice and the food was GREAT! 

To me when you go eat dim sum you want to experience the whole cart table service and crazy mad house atmosphere if it was your first time having dim sum ok, but if you just want some food and go about your day then this will satisfy your fix. 

It's all about the food anyways and they have very good dim sum. The service was pretty fast and you order exactly what you want and it comes out all at the same time instead of waiting for a cart to come by so you can fight for what's left. 

But here at Dim Sum Cafe you can choose from an awesome menu they have everything and then some just as good as a menu as the busy dim sum places if not better and the prices and portions are perfect.

The Shrimp Har Gow is steamed and really shrimpy, if that makes sense?  It's not gross if you like the taste of shrimp like me!  The Sesame Chicken was recommended by the person taking our order over the phone and it is a good amount of crispy and saucy- the sauce has good flavor, too.  Unfortunately, the BBQ buns have a lot of breading (like 3/4 of an inch thick) and not a lot of filling.  That's too bad because the filling is the best part!  

I'll definitely order from Dim Sum Cafe again, especially because they are so fast!  The delivery guy also said, ""Enjoy your food"" which was friendly, too.

I really love the dim sum, the fact that it's closer than china town and the that they always have EPL, but it's just the service in this place is terrible.

I'm gonna start picking my servers like gladiators from now on. There's an older south East Asian lady that won't stop talking and the stuff she comes out with is just plain old awkward. She once stood at the end of the table telling everyone how I looked Chinese. I'm European. I think she meant the way I used chopsticks but like I said, you could hear crickets. There's an older south Asian guy that works on the floor too; he just comes across like he's really unenthused to be there, you have to wave him over constantly and he's the reason I'm writing this review.

The owner and his sons are really friendly and hospitable but between the rest of the people working there it's a real crap shoot. I'd give em 2.5 stars if I could because it's 50/50 if you're gonna have a good experience or not.",uaDuEUElim16e8KNXqU0Bw,3,0,3,yZ9ZwnIcv4Oq_72xvpubng

They have the standards on their dim some menu. The shrimp har gow is pretty amazing and so is the salt and pepper shrimp. Others that I've gone with said the pork shumai and the BBQ pork bun were pretty stellar as well.

This last trip we had the har gow. Served in the traditional bamboo steamers, the wrap wasn't overly sticky and held together pretty good. Can't stand when they are overlooked and the wrapper sticks to the bottom. My friend had the mushroom dumpling. These were made to perfection. Funky diced mushroom in the traditional wrapper and seasoned very well. Also had the salt and pepper shrimp. The amount of shrimp you get on the dim sum menu for 6.50 is pretty good considering the portion size and the fact that usually it's about double the price for a dinner portion. Also tried the curry cream cheese wontons. If you're a fan of curry you'll love these!

The wait staff was very courteous and helped with all our decisions. Service is pretty quick and when we went it was lunchtime. They had an ample amount of tables filled but they still were very attentive and very courteous. 

This isn't one of those Chinatown places where they have the carts being pushed up and down the isles by someone. I actually prefer the menu style of ordering dim sum. Some people tend to like the traditional carts. Every so often for Sunday brunch I'll go to one of those spots but for day to day dim sum I like the convenience of ordering from a menu.

I can't even remember what this location was before it was Dim Sum Cafe, but I eagerly waited their opening. With the bad reviews coming out as soon as they opened, I decided to hold off coming here until they could find their groove. I finally paid a visit here last weekend. The restaurant is clean and spacious, but the table tops are a bit bare for a dim sum place. If you want soy sauce or any other of the condiments like hot sauce you normally see at a dim sum restaurant, you have to ask your server to bring you some. 

As far as the food, it satisfies the craving for dim sum, without having to drive all the way down to Chinatown from the westside. Their fried rice is a small serving for the price, but has good flavor and is enough for 2 people. My husband enjoyed their fried shrimp balls, which came with a generous serving of mayo. The filling for the stuffed eggplants was tasty, but the skin on the eggplant was tough and inedible. Baked BBQ pork buns weren't too flavorful and lacked filling. Pork suimai  had melt-in-your mouth meat, but the wrapping fell apart when trying to get it out of the container. Unfortunately they were out of the baked cream buns, so I'll at least be back to try those out. Service was very attentive and my water never went unfilled. Menu shows that charge for hot tea, but we actually were not charged for, which I appreciate.

Well took the chance and as I walked in on a Sunday morning at 11:15 which would be prime time in spring mtn, I walked in to an empty restaurant.   We decided to give it a shot and ordered 6 items including steam beef tripe, ha gow, siu mai, pork steam noodle roll, congee, and steamed beef spareribs.

Other than the ha gow which was literally whole baby shrimp compressed together, everything else was pretty good.  My favorites were the steamed beef spares and the beef tripe.

All the dishes we ordered (beef chow fun, har gow, steamed pork bun, baked custard bun, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fries taro dumpling) tasted as it traditionally should but was not as greasy, actually. If come again for dim sum fix in the neighborhood. The selection is pretty good but not as much as a trad tea house. For that I give 4 stars. Also, very reasonably priced. 

Him: The chow fun tastes almost as good as my grandpa's. It's really good. It's kind of weird my mommy speaks Chinese to the waiters. They're from Hong Kong. The pork buns are good and different because the meat is not small and dry but chunky and juicy. I like the siu mai too because it was really meaty and juicy and not fatty. The bathrooms are so clean, I went twice. I faked it the first time to inspect and then the second because I really had to go. The sticky rice could have had more flavor but my favorite sausage (pork wine ""lop cherng"") was in there so that was good. Order the Siu Mai.

3499635,2015-08-13,0,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"Was expecting this place to be a frequent future haunt but no such luck sadly. After reading the reviews and living not too far from this area, was banking on it given the amazing Chinese/Taiwanese food scene in Las Vegas. I added almost as much chili sauce in food weight to get any sort of a flavor or desire to eat. So bummed.

Ordered -

1.) Baked bbq pie (Char Siu Soh) - Commercially made and pre-frozen. And, if they did make and then froze, where's the pork? Yikes. Had two bites. It tasted like pre-made canned puff pastry that hasn't been cooked enough and had what I call, 'The Sheen'. Horrid.

2.)Hot and Sour Soup - Clearly the base for all soups is used and they forgot which soup was ordered. It was the worst hot and sour soup I've ever had, and that's saying a lot. The soup also had 'The Sheen' and tasted as if re-heated several times with oil and water. No flavor aside from oil. Ingredients were old.

3.) Baked bbq pork bun - We were getting desperate to like something. It reminded me of fast food Chinese bakeries. The dough is like sponge cake and it had been pre-frozen. Would be surprised if onsite creation. 

4.)Shrimp shu mai - We were in need of liking something and this was okay but not fresh and pre-frozen fast food taste.

5.) Beef and Broccoli - Luckily for my kid, she was neutral on this one due to hunger. Ate some of the beef but the broccoli, as she noted, tasted weird. At first thought it was her pickiness, but the dish was tasteless, the broccoli had a rancid taste, and again w the beef, 'The Sheen'. Carrots were also commercially frozen. Given it was 9.50, could have done so much more.

Am giving an extra star because the staff were so friendly. It was takeaway, and the sauces were placed first in the bag under the food which looked like Jackson Pollock got a hold of brown toned oils and went crazy in a plastic bag and all over all the styrofoam food containers.

Still mourning. Ambiance of place was quite pleasing, though there were only two tables occupied and that may have been a sign. if they completely re-vamped their culinary situation, they would be packed.",XrRLaAeV20MRwdSIGjj2SQ,2,1,2,cZiPwYI5MJOqEgcYepy5fw

It is located on Twain and Hualapai in South Summerlin area.

The place is clean and laid back. There is no steam carts rolling around but your food is made fresh to order. 

My favorite in order are:

Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf $4.50
Sharkfin Dumplings $$3
Red Bean Sesame Ball $2.50
Steamed chicken feet $3
Steamed Beef Tendon $3.50
Pork Porridge $4
Fried Smelt $6.50
Fried Chicken wings $6.50

The service is great, and they speak pretty good English :) The food is fresh and up to par. Just a couple of plates were flavorless and you need to add chilli sauce or soy sauce.

The ordering style does not involve chasing carts, but more like choosing tapas off a menu so food is made to order and therefore steaming hot when it gets to you. Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) was done right, and any dishes with buns were meaty and surprisingly very fresh! The pan fried chive dumpling is a popular pick, but it wasn't my favorite - too oily and average. 

Dishes are reasonably priced IMO, making this cafe a hidden gem. Service is friendly but may be a bit pushy/influential? - if you know what you want, order it. I've only had Dim Sum when making a visit, but they have a full menu of Asian entree dishes - including lunch specials from 11am-3pm.",T1ECVGXE_vwCoCOY5s4esg,5,2,4,KxJ9W0YSALVuQJt5WMe3Wg

 Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean and tidy. There were about 5 people dining in, which I thought seemed normal since it was 7pm and dim sum is usually enjoyed as a breakfast food. We were seated promptly and were handed menus as the server took our drinks. I love the fact that the menu included pictures of the dim sum to make it easier to order. Upon review, here's is all we ordered:

1. Rice noodle roll
2. Pork shiu mai
3. Shrimp shiu mai
4. BBQ pork bun
5. Sweet rice cake 
6. Shrimp har gow 
7. Chive dumpling
8. Cream cheese curry wonton 
9. Daikon cake
10. Beef tendon (we never received). 

Alrighty, here it goes... 1. The rice noodle roll came in hot, as well as all the dishes. It was served with a tasty soy like sauce, but not as salty. There were small chunks of BBQ pork throughout the entire roll. Not my fave.. it tasted a bit bland and somewhat watery. I'd probably enjoy it more if it had a stronger pork flavor. 
2. Pork shiu mai was hot and juicy. Nice delicate flavor, but again was a bit bland.  3. Shrimp shiu mai was also juicy with a nice shrimp flavor, but once again bland.. see where this is going yet? 4. BBQ pork bun was fluffy and full of flavor but nothing special since it tasted like most pork buns I've had. I just wish there was a bit more filling. 5. Sweet rice cake was fluffy, moist, and sweet. Perfect as a dessert. 6. Shrimp har gow was ok. In need of salt and was overpowered by the dumpling wrapper. Tasted a bit watery as well.  7. Chive dumpling was my favorite of all the dishes! Pan fried on both sides and gave a nice crunch when bit into it. The dumpling didn't need any sauce to go with it since it was delicious on its own. A word of advice... let all your dumplings cool down!!! They are hotter than the devils ass! 8. Cream cheese curry wonton was pretty good. Pretty simple and the curry wasn't too over powering. 9. Daikon cake was nice and crispy on both sides. It gave a nice crunch but was a bit too soft, almost runny on the inside. It was ok.  10. Beef tendon... we actually didn't receive it. 

All in all, Dim Sum Cafe was just ok to me, nothing special, and definitely not better than KJ kitchen at the rio. I left full, but not satisfied as I had anticipated. The only reason I gave 3 stars and not 2 was due to the tasty chive dumplings, pork shiu mai, and pork buns, and friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness. I hope to be back one day, since I like to give restaurants a second chance especially since this place has such great reviews!!! Maybe it's just me or perhaps it was an off day for them.

She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added, ""I don't think you'll like that.  You should order something else.  We have fish and...."" and she gestured to other items on the separate, non-main menu.  I just got profiled because I'm not Asian.  I won't like it!!  I don't think she'll like this 1 star review!!!!

I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken.  In a short time, the curry chicken was brought.  Note that since I didn't say hot and sour soup a second time, it was left off the order.  In a few seconds, she brought the small bowl of rice.

They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic.  I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork.  The server saw this and asked, ""Do you want a spoon?""  My answer was a quiet but firm, ""No!""  In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child's spoon.

The chicken was OK.  The sauce was heavy.  There should be more curry flavor.  This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I've had to stress heavy on the curry.  That was my mistake this time.

I finished my meal, paid, crossed off the line for tip, signed the charge, and left.  

As you can tell, the service experience was awful.  But I would like this server to know that if she ever came to my restaurant, I wouldn't tell her she wouldn't like the scrapple.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,22,9,1,D4xqeB6ukvi3W0S8F8AMFg

True...you may miss the ambiance of traditional dim sum. There's no steaming carts rolling around. You simply order and your food comes from the kitchen. The major advantage to this is everything comes up fresh and hot! The menu is clear and easy for any novice with pictures and prices. 

They have all the classics and favorites and they are done well! They have specials as well to keep things interesting. 

There are fish tanks in the wall and it's big and open inside. Service is friendly and sufficient. I have yet to see it packed so you can sit and eat right away.

4201891,2016-10-24,0,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"It's our typical day after drinking, lazy Sunday and the boyfriend and I were craving dim sum. After getting a business card for Dim Sum Cafe from Orchid Garden, our usual go-to spot for dim sum, we decided to try it out and apparently Dim Sum Cafe has the same owners as Orchid Garden. Dim Sum Cafe skimped on the normal dim sum cart experience and instead provide a menu to order off of. 

We ordered the following dumplings:
-Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumpling)
-Pork shumai
-Chicken feet
-Shrimp noodle
-Pork spare ribs
-Fried chive dumpling

Har Gow has been my most favorite dumpling since I was a little girl and in all honesty, it's hard to mess it up and tonight it did not disappoint. The shrimp noodle, chicken feet and fried chive dumpling didn't taste any different than any other I've had before so it's safe to say that it satisfied my cravings. With that being said, the shumai and pork spare ribs lacked in flavor. The sauce for the spare ribs were more liquified than the usual thick, stick to the meat sauce. I do want to say though, where the food lacked in flavor was made up by the customer service and mouth-burningly hot food, which was a plus! To me, the next best thing to flavorful food is super fresh food!!",UgSH2kQf1XvCYWl5QHUNUQ,1,0,4,oqZ5v8OI6TenUK9pdepubQ

Har Gow: I liked them. Ok they might not be the traditional dim sumy kind but 2 orders of them (4 pieces/order) found their way into my tummy.

Sweet Rice Cake (honeycomb cake). I felt like a kid going to the Bakery in Chinatown with my parents. I haven't been able to find these cakes and it was exactly the way I remember. Slightly sweet, glutinous honeycomb, bouncy texture with a hint of fermentation.

When I walked in, there were about a dozen employees standing  behind the counter for a staff huddle.  One gal seated me and a another guy brought me water.  

They had 3 small flat screen tvs and 5 fish tanks.  The booths were really hard.  They didn't have much cushion to them.  Where I was seated, I could hear the kitchen staff and the servers behind me talking and hanging out.

They had nice laminated menus.  The only problem was that they didn't have enough menus.  A woman tried to pick up my menu after I ordered.  But I wanted to hang on to it in case I wanted to order more.

They offered 15 Dim Sum options, breakfast, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fish, From the Wok, and soups.  I ordered 4 Dim Sum dishes.

Fried Calamari ($6.50):  There were 9 lightly breaded rings of calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server asked if I wanted sweet and sour, hoisin, hot chili, or soy sauce.  I choose sweet and sour sauce.  It was served in a little plastic container.  It was watery.

Stuffed Mushrooms ($3.50):  There were 4  piping hot mushrooms stuffed with tasteless ground shrimp and calamari served on a saucer plate.

The server brought me hoisin and hot chili sauce in a little plastic container, and a bottle of soy sauce for the dumplings.

Pork Shiu Mai ($2.50):  4 pieces served on a saucer plate.  They were filled with ground pork and mushrooms.

Steamed Pork Dumplings ($3): 3 dumplings served on a saucer plate.  These were the best out of the 4 items I ordered.

They could at least invest in proper serving plates, offer chopsticks, and have little jars of condiments on the table.  They need a website and a Facebook page.

The prices are great and they accommodate take out orders~ 

The only thing that I've recently noticed that needs to be fixed ASAP are the steamed dim sum dishes. They keep coming out over steamed and way too soft... Ugh. Hopefully they fix this.

However, that does not change the fact that we love good food!  We normally go to Chinatown's Orchid Garden for good Dim Sum.  But found good reviews for Dim Sum Cafe and it's in our part of town.

Needless to say, this place is awesome and we now have no need to go to Chinatown for authentic Dim Sum!  Here's what we got when we were there:  Vegetable Fried Rice (it has egg in it), Chinese Broccoli, Veggie Chow Mein, Red Bean Sesame Ball, Mushroom Shumai, & Vegetable Eggroll.

So, from what we ordered you can see we didn't actually have a ton of Dim Sum.  Based on the Dim Sum we received I know for a fact this place knows what they are doing.  We eat a lot of Dim Sum but due to the dietary restrictions we've recently took on we were a bit conservative on what we ordered.

Overall, this place is a great value for the price.  The location is extremely clean and stylish (compared to Orchid Garden in Chinatown).  The food is excellent and has a bit of the Hong Kong flair to their cooking.  The Dim Sum isn't sitting on steam carts which mean it's way more fresh than we're used to.

I've wanted to try Dim Sum since I watched this TRUE LIFE episode on MTV years ago. Watching all the small plates on little conveyer belts and carts looked pretty cool... DSC doesn't use carts which is okay because even my friend agreed the food is so much more fresh made to order (she's very experienced in the dim sum tradition). 

The service is fast and efficient. All of our food arrived fresh, hot and equally delicious. 

Highly recommended!

You order dim sum from a menu and it comes out piping hot. I was a little doubtful about this as I'm a dim sum ""cart"" guy but I've now seen the light.

I highly recommend the fried chive dumplings. I've had these in plenty of places and this was the best I've had.

What makes this place such a good deal is the size of their portions along with quality. Most dishes come with 4 pieces instead of the standard 3. Much  better deal and flavor than Orchids which I consider to be massively overpriced and overrated.

Highly recommend the fried chive dumplings and the chicken baos. Actually all the baos were very good and a steal at $2.50 for 3. The seasonal snow pea ""leaves"" were excellent but a bit pricey for a vegetable dish. Very good though.

The shrimp har gow and siu mai were average to me although ymmv.

Restaurant was very nicely furnished and QUIET. If you go to regular dim sum places you'll know what I'm talking about. A bit out of the way in the very nice suburb of Summerlin.

When I saw the menu it seemed funny to have so much of everything that was not Dim Sum. They did not have a lot of Dim Sum on the menu, maybe 15+ items...no Har Gau (shrimp dumpling), a must have for any restaurant wanting to serve Dim Sum. 

I ordered 3 different types of Siu Mais (Chicken, Pork, Shrimp), only the Shrimp was okay, the pork and chicken both needed flavoring. Imagine flavorless pork, yuk. I also got the chicken pot stickers (made from store bought pot-sticker skin) which was also tasteless. The eggrolls, ehhh...stuffed mushroom/shrimp ehhh...and a fake sharkfin dumpling (was told that's what it was) also ehhh.  The waiter said all their Dim Sum is made to order or heated up when order...it all came out not very hot. I had a red bean ice to drink, that was okay but not enough since it came out in a short glass.

 This restaurant just opened a week ago and I think they are trying to be jack of all trades and unfortunately they have not even mastered their namesake (Dim Sum). If they named the restaurant Dim Sum Cafe, you'd think they serve really good Dim Sum, not so here.

1.  the bean curd skin roll
    Rate: 1.5
Note: The bean curd skin roll tasted old- more of the boarder line spoilage taste. 
2. Sticky rice 
     Rate:0 (yes, it's a zero star) 
Note: The sticky rice had too little stuffings.  Most stuffings are pork fat with very little meat.  It has a very mild rotten meat kind of sourness taste which is rather unpleasant for me.  

3. Shrimp dumpling
     Rate: 3
Note:  it tasted average. Neither bad nor impressive! 

Facilities: 
Restroom

The bathroom was dusty, things were broken everywhere. There were one missing light bulb, one broken paper towel feeder, one very dimes light bulb.  A very dusty soap bin and sink counter.   The sanitation standard is not up to my standard.  My biggest pet peeve for a restaurant is dirty restroom.  If they can't keep that room clean, their kitchen won't be any better.  

Overall-I would give negative stars if allowed.

5566616,2014-04-23,1,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"I live in the area and was excited when I saw a Dim Sum place opening up.  Sadly food is borderline inedible.  

The Mushroom Shiu Mai....the mushroom it was served on couldn't be cut!  It acted like rubber.  You put a knife to it and it would retain it's shape once you lifted the knife from it.  I've never seen a mushroom do this.  Needed to make serious effort to cut through it.  I tried a small taste  and had to remove it from my mouth.  

The shrimp dumplings/potsticker seemed old.   The shrimp in the dumpling was mushy and fell apart.  It was not seasoned and was bland.  Took one bite and left the rest.  

The one cart of food they were selling looked old.  The egg rolls did not look like they were made in house.   When asked about some of the other dim sum on the menu the said that was made to order as it doesn't hold well.   Which gave me reason to believe the food on the cart wasn't made right away and looked its age.  

The pork buns were ""OK"" nothing special.  Could use a bit more filling in the buns.  

The Chicken dumplings were average.  They were actually the saving grace of the experience.   Found it odd you had to actually request the standard sauces that are served at normal dim sum places.   We had the hot mustard and the red chili.  Both sauces were good.  

The ice tea was fresh......I wasn't offered a refill or asked if I wanted another drink.

More like if u need a quick fix and don't feel like driving to chinatown, which is ultimately what u should do for fresh dim sum.

The service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. From the moment we walked through the door the middle aged man who sat us and waited on us was impolite. It didn't bother me at first. I considered it was due to a language or cultural barrier. Then I saw him interacting with an elderly couple who sat in the booth next to us. He wasn't exactly bubbly with them but he sure treated them with a lot more respect than he did us. The slightly younger gentlemen who looks like he might own the place, also began helping the couple next to us, asking them if he could get them hot sauce, soy sauce, etc. While our cups remained empty and no one ever returned to ask how we were doing or if we would like anything else, even though we kept the menu after our initial order and indicated that we would order more food as we went on. 

The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food wasn't terrible. It wasn't out of this world. It was... mediocre at best. Had our server returned to our table, I could've had more of a chance to judge the food. But so be it.

I found this place as a desperate attempt to skip lines, get good service, and most importantly, stuff my face with the glories of dim sum awesomeness. 

This isn't your typical ""authentic"" dim sum where you'll see carts coming around. Yeah, I like that part of dim sum, too, but, having had eaten here, I've come to appreciate the beauty of a sit-down made-to-order dim sum. 

For the first time in my life, I was able to be present during my meal, focusing on what was on my plate and appreciating every bite of what was happening to me  rather than having my eyes darting all over the place, looking at what the next cart has to offer, frantically attempting to grab every goodie from each cart.

Pros: 
No wait here. No lines. 
Fresh items that are cooked just for your order. 
Lower possibility of over-ordering, because my eyes are always bigger than my belly. 
Good pricing. 
Delicious
Quick/good service


Cons: No cart people walking around? 

Items ordered: 

Pork Porridge- 5 star. Who knew porridge could be so good without adding soy sauce. The broth was so delicious, I was amazed at how they had made this. 

Stuffed eggplant - 5 star. OMG. Do it like Nike, because this stuff is sooooo good.

Steamed pork Dumpling - 5 star. It ain't Din Tai Fung, but, you can't compare anything to that standard. This is as good as it gets for a dim sum spot. 

Pan fried chive dumpling - 4 star.
Pork Shumai- 3 star.  
Chicken Shumai- 3 star. 
Egg roll- 2 star. Good, nothing extraordinary
Combination chow fun- 3 star.  
Red bean sesame ball- 5 star. Crisp, light, fresh, not too oily. 
Steamed bok choy- 3 star. It's veggie. What can I say. 
Radish cakes - 4 star (special menu). My fave, but not on regular menu :(. 

I can't believe in my dim sum history, I'd pick a sit-down place to be one of my fave and best moments, but, yes, I think I have found my spot. I shall report back after I have tried the other famous spot at the Rio casino...but, till then, I give this place my solid 5 star.

Oh, and I hope they carry white vinegar in the future. I can't enjoy dumplings to the fullest with red vinegar, which is apparently all they have for customers to use for the dumplings.

Don't forget to pick up an almond cookie for 50cents on your way out. This isn't that cheap, nasty, hard almond cookie you can get at CVS or in a box. It tastes homemade, and crumbles in your mouth.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,9,5,5,-yZoJGG0egwuGLIt-eSxYQ

5836823,2014-06-15,1,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"They have some things to work on, but I'm giving 5 stars because I've never gone to a dim sum place in town that I really wanted to go back to of my own free will. 

First, a little history of my dim sum perspective. Since I was young I've gone to the best dim sum restaurants in San Francisco with my parents, and since coming to Las Vegas we've also tried practically every dim sum joint in town available. Cathay, KJ's in Rio, PingPangPong, Orchid's, Chang's.... The only time I go is when my parents are in town and it's all the same to me. The best communication is in Mandarin or a dialect, otherwise its pointing at things. There are a variety of dishes, lots of shrimp based things, many dishes are very salty, very heavy, very oily. I don't like any of those latter points. 

I'm not saying that Dim Sum Cafe food is bland. Not at all! But in comparison to all the others, it is not so heavy that it makes me want to stop eating after a few tries. It also seems to be less oily and heavy than other places I've tried. 

One big thing I really like is that you can order dim sum any time of the day and they make it to order so its hot and fresh, not on a cart for who knows how long. This does mean it will take a little bit for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait to me. I was initially a little wary since another review said it was a sister of Orchid Garden, who gave me cold dim sum so I never went back. Fortunately, nothing was cold, stale, or old here. The quality seems to be quite good, and everything tastes great. 

There are some Chinese only speaking employees there, but they do their best and mean well. It did take a little while to be noticed and seated, and service seems a little bit slow depending on which server you get. It might be a little bit of language barrier, a little shortage of staff, a little less experience with customer service, but whatever it is a little training or hiring of experienced servers would smooth these bumps quickly. 

For a Saturday night there were not many people there. I don't know if it was the location or that it's still a new place, but I hope they can make the right improvements and stay in business so that I can keep having dim sum that doesn't overwhelm me!",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,5,1,5,vlK6UzFpLLOjajMD2RofzQ

A friend of mind had told me that the owners were the same as Orchid Garden, so I was quite weary to try this place only because I am not the biggest fan of their dim sum. However, I figured I'd give it a go and the bf and I ordered...

- FRIED TARO 8/10: Really yummy savory taro filling with a delicate fried outer shell. Bf said it was a little salty. 
- PORK SHUMAI 5/10: Did not taste like the shumai I'm used to. It had a weird smell, kinda like a dog, but it tasted okay. The bf did say he liked this.
- BEAN CURD SKIN 9/10: I actually quite enjoyed this one. It had vegetables on the inside and wasn't too salty. I would come back for this!
- SHRIMP HARGOW 2/10: I've never had hargow I didn't like until today. Shrimp was not fresh and had a weird texture. The bf and I didn't want to eat more than 1 bite. 
- RICE NOODLE w/ SHRIMP 2/10: this is usually my fave dish anywhere I can get dim sum, however the rice noodle was over cooked and was soooo mushy.
- SWEET RICE CAKE 7/10: This was good! I even brought some home to my mom since it's her favorite. My only complaint is that it's not as moist as most other places.
- RED BEAN SESAME BALL 9/10: Served hot and fresh, really yummy.

My review as I come after my massage (medical massage next door at Body Kinetics). I've been twice and I'm a major lover of Chinese food. This did not disappoint. For quite literally next to nothing you can eat a whole lot of dim sum. They are quick and terse (not really service with a smile) but when they are that busy and running around you can't blame them-especially with these prices. 

A few tips-don't rely on photos as they aren't always the same as the food served-for the most part yes but if you don't do dim sum ask, also the spare ribs are quite nasty, not the red long spare ribs seasoned as you may be accustomed to but a little bowl of fatty, very little actual meat and embedded bone (got it twice so I vouch for this). Also TIP-an egg roll is a SPRING ROLL. I knew this and they clearly show it but if you are looking for good old fashioned DEEP FRIED, CRISPY, PORK AND VEGETABLE EGG ROLL-go to a Hunan restaurant.

All said I really think for $20 to get beyond full is a bargain-especially when the food is good.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,4,1,5,D6fOjHqFf6F4OAZZlSQU0w

Open area clean..wanted to try the sweet cream buns but I didn't have room since we were going for ice cream up the street",HEdhMjPZINpAtRE7jq1i5Q,1,0,5,WdFfxnYVcenxVXkNlLFNuA

Everything was at perfect, warm temperature...made to perfection! The workers were a lot more friendlier, especially Carly, and the manager even came by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything. We ordered the pork shumai, shrimp shumai, pan fried chive dumplings, and pork steamed bun. So so delicious and definitely sufficed my dim sum craving!

I really like the fact that this restaurant is close to where I live, so that way I don't have to go to Chinatown for some good dim sum. They also make the food fresh, instead of having it pre-made and ready to serve. It may be a wait but its worth it. In addition, the staff is super friendly and nice. I highly recommend this restaurant.",3QaV_AF2FrZxrlEWPfoOfA,0,0,5,9w2Y_ThU_Yx-D2uujeGQGA

Not all speak English but that's okay as long as they're smiling :).

5996466,2017-08-02,0,EdY6q0CO2mlATpoTFkvHAw,"I love dim sum and one day my husband and I took hualapai to get to target and I saw the restaurant. Since we live close we decided we'd come by and try it. 

It's small on the inside and not traditional where you'd see a lady come up to you with a variety of foods from a cart where you can pick your dim sum from. Instead they provide a menu with pictures which was nice since we don't exactly know what we're getting when we do get dim sum from a cart anyway. 

We choose quite a few dishes and I enjoyed most of them. We got the pork shumai, Steamed shrimp dumplings, shrimp hargow, pan fried chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle, crab claws, sugar cane shrimp, and the waitress convinced us to try this snow peas vegetable. 

Overall, I was full after all the things we ordered. My favorite was the crab claws. They come like the shrimp ball but on crab claws which is cool. The snow peas vegetable reminded me of the Chinese broccoli we usually get but without hoisin sauce. I'd come back to try other things on their menu in the future.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,4,1,4,tGgxqvNnJGewMkGaCNPMgw
