742397,2016-02-01,0,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"We've been here a few times for their Saturday Night Prime Rib special.  

Gilligans is definitely a Hideaway, and takes a bit of searching to find it.  Their food is good, the service is INCREDIBLY friendly, and the place is always clean.  The drinks are cheap and poured heavy, and the food portions are generous for the price.  

It is an older restaurant and is a smoking establishment, so it's great if you are a smoker but for the non-smokers out there, the years of smoke build-up may be a bit too much.  We've been several times, and we will keep coming back.  Keep up the good work.",WiFoxHzZANvwcC4aQKR7uQ,2,0,4,sCZwsB-FIxi0EmYOzfdtAw

I went here for the 1st time on Wednesday(checking out bars/resturants in my soon to be new neighborhood)and was very thrilled that I did. Amazing delicious food specials. I ordered chicken nachos: the chips were fresh home made & the tons of chicken on it were right off the bone. AND it only cost 5 bucks! The chef came & talked to us for a bit & I could tell the man clearly loves to cook, I could tell just by tasting his food! If you enjoy home cooked meals, awesome service & cold beer, then check this place out!",XnTE_-_kevfyYQQ3eErp7w,1,0,5,s9-Qw-iY8LY2loE_eSrDCA

1376265,2016-02-03,0,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"I've been here a handful of times for the amazing Prime Rib Saturday special!!! 
My sister had an overnight trip to Las Vegas and we wanted to go somewhere to eat and chat a bit.  She said just a neighborhood type place versus the Strip would be great...Gilligan's was it!  My sister had the special, ribs and chicken and I had the fish and chips, absolutely delicious food and we went home with doggie bags! 
And yes, it is a smoking place, however we sit in the back and with the fans on, it is not that bad.  (I'm an ex-smoker and it can bother me)
And very friendly staff, always helpful!!!",umRhPu0IzXTXpz9vQ7evzA,1,0,5,6vRvgN3czTu6XPtRD5BkaQ

We only ordered an appetizer. Mozzarella ""sticks"" more like mozzarella logs. These things were frickin' huge! Definitely not frozen and cut straight  from a fresh piece which you'll never see in a PT's. 
Zoe and Matt; incredibly friendly and attentive and are the reason we're going back. The place isn't a dive but it's definitely hidden away. Worth going to if only for a drink, some mozzarella logs, and a football game.",ixg9slI38gXsxT3CCfhU_A,0,0,5,GHs8orUJSU1Ghncdenk6fg

2220062,2016-05-12,0,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"This is my third time into Gilligan's. The first time I had the Frisco burger and the Gilligan fries and the only thing I can say is it was outstanding. The second time I brought my wife and she had the clam chowder and salad on a Friday night and I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich. Both were extraordinary. Today we came back in for lunch I had their pork chop special and my wife had the meatball parmesan sandwich, and I can say they were as good as any we have ever had. This is a bar so if you're looking for casual dining this is your place. If you're looking for formal dining go somewhere else and have much worse food.",Nsv9dDRMN8S6OceY_bL_Jg,1,0,5,hqYyXBmibbLrvF5WzIzNyg

i was craving chicken fried steak since  i seen it on the menu they left on my door. 
i was very satisfied with it. i dont know what it was. maybe a little plain? i dont know.
the pizza was the same. just Meh. 

im sure i will try them again another day.",m0aeKCg9AAvwvnKUf1Evcw,0,0,2,lTVb-Ohr70341JQJDoNEog

Amazing!...but don't wait too long because They often sell out.
They also do a really delicious Cobb salad.

3274202,2015-10-15,0,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"O-M-G!! I just noticed Gilligan's Hideaway on GrubHub today and I was craving baby back ribs, so I ordered half a rack, jumbo garlic-butter shrimp scampi, and plain chicken fingers with a side of ranch to dip them in. 
Let me tell you...I was FAR from disappointed!!
The chicken fingers were hot and crispy on the outside with tender, white meat on the inside. They were really good.
The garlic-butter shrimp was hot and very flavorful, without being drowned in the garlic-butter sauce. It was just right.
As for the ribs...
I have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever!! They were cooked PERFECTLY, with just the right amount of BBQ sauce.
Their baby back ribs were, BY FAR, thee BEST ribs I've ever had.
They were fall off the bone tender and had no fat on them at all. They just had LOTS of tender, delicious meat!! 
Needless to say, I will DEFINITELY be ordering from them again in the near future!! I HIGHLY recommend you try their baby back ribs. 
And last but not least, even the customer service and the delivery time were amazing!!",xxOrNm6ntvKJe3h4isSfeA,3,1,4,Qv5M5xH3ui7th1VCtSho6A

Daily lunch and dinner specials, plus a 4 - 6 list of happy hour specials that include oysters, claims as well as the usual bar food.  Today we stopped in for the pork chop dinner, which came with apple sauce, just like Mom used to serve, green beans and a mess of potatoes au gratin.  Home style food is available in Vegas for a most reasonable price.  And even though we don't drink, the long time staff did not ignore us, on the contrary, treated us like welcome members of the family.",y3taInVgrfDTelUkQYQtEA,5,1,5,dJnNJyf5G0C3ewNVJn94pg
3795561,2014-08-05,2,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"I stumbled on this spot while reading an article about the Las Vegas mob. This place used to be called Starboard Tack in the 70s and Al Bramlett the local culinary union leader hired 2 men to plant car bombs here in 1976. The bombs failed to detonate and Mr Bramlett didn't pay for the job. One thing leads to another and Mr Bramlett ends up dead in the desert. 
Now on to Gilligans, I really like the decor. The nautical theme is evident outside and inside, a true throw back to the old days where the outside looks like a dock, the inside is made to look like a ship (on restaurant side) etc. They have really cool stained glass art behind the booths. Now my problem is I read the website menu that included things like filet and shrimp for 13.99 and many other enticing items. The problem is when I got there the menu was totally different and about 15-20% more expensive than the website shows. Have to knock off stars for that.
I ordered chicken marsala made by the waiter/chef , who looks just like Norm Macdonald and was an awesome guy. The chicken was great and the pasta and garlic bread were plentiful and adequate. The marinara was not great but its not like this is an Italian place. I paid about 20 for my meal and 2 bottles of domestic suds. I will come back for the Saturday prime rib special. Just a note, the location is very very odd. It seems to almost be in an apartment buildings parking lot off a side street in a worn out area of town. Don't let that fool you because this is the type of homey bar/restaurant (with some interesting ""mob"" history) you don't really find in this town anymore (like the Coachmen).",bW2fmK-FnGDvAVQo-PH1Nw,2,3,3,9HqaWyiTEyhk4WgmdZbNqQ
4090053,2015-05-24,0,8fjF2NIPSM0Ar1hed2tdog,"Let me start with the service. Very kind people and the cook even came out and had great conversation with us. He explained all the popular specials. The food came out pretty fast as well.

The food was the best bar food I've had in a while. I enjoyed the heck out of their pastrami sandwich with spicy mustard on rye bread. The hot wings are to die for also. The prime rib was as good as it gets as far as flavor and texture goes. 

The price was unbelievable for the quality you get. The Saturday prime rib special is $16.95, and you get a huge baked potato, salad, dessert, and a choice of wine beer or soda. That's unbeatable!

All in all I'm going back!!!! ASAP",XVzcjajl8LPkjx05vUJZ1w,4,5,5,gC176Z3LqkorSVUooAiLZA

The menu has been upgraded from the old typical bar food selection to more of a neighborhood family place. The staff and service were great but the place is small so there was only one bartender and one waitress to handle everything.Not having any beer on tap is something of a drawback but otherwise the bar is a nice cozy environment.
