The teriyaki beef was very tasty, loved it!  The spaghetti salad & kim chee was good.

I just feel like it wasn't as good as I expected. I got the hawaiian poke bowl and hawaiian style tako poke. I personally think that their bowls are a little too pricey ($9.95). The hawaiian poke bowl came with kalua pig, lomi salmon, and spicy tuna (but you can choose whichever poke you want). Honestly, I expected much better than what I ate. It was good, but it felt like I was missing something to give it that ""umph"". I liked the tako poke and it had a nice spicy kick. I thought it would be more expensive, but I think the price was reasonable ($5.50 for 8 oz). I'll be back to try a different bowl and hopefully I'll like it more, but I know I'll definitely be back to buy some poke and even desserts!!",8lBKLHCatV3ZFuw6DYQgPg,1,1,4,c0K25s3onr45cXpl03eiMw

1241444,2017-07-17,2,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"Paina Cafe is one of my go-to spots. From Sunday breakfasts to Lunches and dinners to midday mochi snacks, this place can satisfy my cravings. 

There breakfast is only available on Sunday mornings and how I wish this menu was available 24/7. The tsunami cakes (which I got with Ube custard sauce), is dense and fluffy at the same time. Since the pancakes are made with mochi powder, it gives the pancake a nice bounce to it. The Ube custard sauce is not overpowering and is creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. The Kalua Benny is also delicious. The pork is tender and flavorful, while the Yuzu Hollandaise sauce accents the pork well. The croissant it sits on is flaky and goes well with the pork as well. 

For lunch menu items, the Kalua pig bowl is delicious. It was a simple dish with shredded pork and rice; I wish the item came with some cabbage to have some veggies with the dish, but the pork was already great by itself. The Fried Saiman was also very good, with tender cuts of beef and delicious noodles. 

Paina cafe wins with all of their pastries. Though I still have many to try. I really enjoy their mango mochi. The mochi is sticky and the filling is not too sweet. Mochi is only sold on Monday, so make sure you check it out!",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,3,4,BtkVIm-SfTSim0wOzxbtUg

Prior to visiting, Pokinometry in Anaheim was my favorite poke bowl place. But this, this place is the real deal. (And I guess that's pretty obvious, since this place came from Hawaii lol)

The process is very simple. You walk up to the counter on the left and place your order. There are desserts in a glass display that you can choose from. They also had spam musubi when we went, but I did not see it on the menu. You give them your name and wait for it to be called. Easy peasy. 

Since it was our first time, my boyfriend and I opted for the preset bowls: a regular nanea salmon poke bowl and large kewalo bowl. You got to choose white or brown rice. We also had the option to choose two types of poke in our bowls. They also have options to make your own. AND they sell poke in containers to go too. YES YES YES. I love masago, and I love that they were so generous with their masago topping. The kewalo bowl sauce (pretty sure it had wasabi) WAS SO GOOD.

1994025,2016-11-08,14,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"Great food, great service and great atmosphere! So glad Paina Cafe expanded to Las Vegas.

Located in a strip mall next to Greenland Supermarket, the restaurant is bright, welcoming and their menu offers a variety. From poke bowls, to sandwiches and salads.

I highly recommend the ahi katsu bowl. It's basically ahi (fish) coated lightly in bread crumbs and fried, not too greasy or too dry. Served over brown or white rice, with additional sides of your choosing. Very good and filling!

The kamaboko (fishcake) dip is done just right. Not too rich, not too heavy, but still flavorful.

Currently, my favorite menu item is the pulehu tako (dried octopus), mostly because it reminds me of something my grandfather used to make. It's not too chewy, not too dry, and the sauce adds a little bit of heat. I've had similar items from other places here in Vegas, but nothing comes close. I had to exercise extreme constraint not to eat the entire container in one sitting.

Regardless if you're from Hawaii or not, they have something for everyone. I'm from Hawaii so some of what I ordered may seem unusual (like the kamaboko dip), because you don't find it on menus here in town. But back home, you'll find it at potlucks and family gatherings any day of the week. 

Highly recommend and definitely going back again soon!",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,30,27,5,be6GRYjeprmgehhEvKk1Tw

My favorite poke spot right now! It definitely has the home vibe to it. Being from Hawaii it's hard finding a good poke place that lives up to expectations. I have yet to try the other options as today was my time, but I got the kewalo bowl. It contained furikake, spicy shoyu (they also have regular kine), onions, white or brown rice, and ahi poke. The poke tasted fresh and everything blended perfectly together! I believe it's around $9-10 bucks for the regular size. They also give a good sized portion! A lot of poke places really lack portion and wanna be very cheap on the fish. This place will give you a good amount. I also got to try my girlfriends salmon poke and it was good and smooth like buttahhhh. 

Overall I will be back soon to try their other options. Specifically I wanna try the ahi katsu bowl that one sounded bomb! The staff is friendly and the place is clean with a good amount of seating.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,1,2,5,E5waZv4Ivo3idnmZhxfkBA
2016928,2017-03-23,11,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"Paina brings the original Hawaiian style poke bowl to Vegas! Though there are many poke bowl spots opening around town, all the native Islanders have been quick to point out that they're not the real thing- Paina is. 

The poke flavors at Paina are traditional and fish-forward; there is actual Hawaiian poke in your bowl rather than just fish and sauce. If you're used to the usual overly-sauced fish bowls with tons of toppings, you may find these underwhelming- note that each topping comes with a 60-cent charge. You can also purchase the pokes by weight to take home, keep an eye out for the tako poke, which sells out!

The Nanea salmon bowl was the first one I tried, followed by the Hawaiian bowl, which combines hot and cold protein with lomi and kalua pork with your choice of poke.  The fish is fresh and flavorfully marinated, and the fish quality is higher than their competition. The ahi katsu Caesar salad was also an interesting menu item; the protein portion goes further than it looks and crisp Romaine and flaky parmesan add a lot of texture. 

Bonus star for partnering with OnoSweets for fancy Hawaiian-influenced desserts, like strawberry mochi, ube tarts (love!), and matcha roll cakes. Definitely plan on having something sweet to end your meal!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,27,24,4,yB__u6ZZYyO8XK83fN9tJQ

The ube tart is overrated, not flavorful basically just sweet custard with bright color, while their passion fruit tart is delightful with a great combination of sweet and tart, soft and crunchy. Other tarts are good too, all worth trying. The green tea custard is very matcha and it's awesome. I got the ube cake roll as well, cake part is great, again the ube custard, along with the Chantilly custard, not very impressive. The Aloha tower (not sure if it's exactly the name, it's banana pound cake, cream and Chantilly custard) the banana pound cake is very good. The other one I got is the Haupia bar, it's good, period. Overall the desserts are decent, will go back and try other items. Big disappointment for the ube custard but it's not the cafe that advertised the ube is crazy good. I didn't expect the chantilly custard to be too special anyways cuz it's basically just butter sugar egg and milk, and that's what the ube flavor tastes like, maybe if you try really hard, you can taste some starch.

The atmosphere of this place is super cute and hip, I love the canvases throughout the store that add a touch of Hawaii to the store. The menu is pretty self explanatory but I felt like it was not what I was expecting. I had the spicy ahi bowl and would probably rate it a little more on the spicy side compared to spicy ahi I've had. 

You do get a great amount of fish for the price of the bowl, but I dislike how they charge you an additional 60 cents per topping... I didn't end up adding toppings anyway because I felt like it took away from the poke. Another plus would be that they serve it with just plain white or brown rice and not sushi rice; I hate it when poke places give you sushi rice (it's a poke bowl not a sushi bowl). 

They also have a variety or desserts to choose from like chantilly tarts and ube tarts which looked delicious. I am definitely putting this on list the next time I visit.

Heck, I had to add shoyu to my beef patty to drown out the sweetness I was tasting.

But otherwise. The poke here is TO DIE FOR. It's my favorite place now in Vegas to get fresh, quality poke. The Shoyu poke and the Spicy Ahi are my favorites. I definitely want to try the other flavors.

2332569,2016-12-28,2,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"The Poke Bowl ride made another stop at one of the newer ones Paina Cafe. Unlike all the ones before Paina Cafe definitely STANDS out lot for different reasons. Not that I will stop my endless journey because seems like every month another poke spot pops out. Paina Cafe is my GO TO spot comes to local grinds. Why I went back try more of the menu and so much more of the menu need to try. I just might need make run after write this review.

My first visit went off the beaten path went with the Ahi Katsu and two orders side action  spam musubi. The Ahi Katsu basically chicken katsu style just with fish. It was awesome. The panko style crust was nice golden brown and the ahi was cooked through on point. It was not dried out at all (just in case thinking ahi cooked all the way..huh) nice moist and then combine with the sauce on top. You can add any amount of toppings want some of them vary in price. I went with kim chee because love kim chee. Kim chee and the spam musubi the perfect compliment. The spam musubi they add furikake into the rice. So not just straight rice looking at it. Nice touch because not everyone does it that style. Spam musubi is universal everyone does it there own way. End the beauty of it is spam, nori, and rice. WInnah!!!

Second visit had go with the tradition some poke action. I was not sure Hawaiian style, shoyu, or spicy? I always go for spicy poke more times then not. Poke Crunch Bowl. Another winnah!! The fish always standard comes Poke make or break. The fish looked fresh nice color, tasted fresh, not fatty at all, and nice square pieces (unlike other spots on the ride hate it when minced up and not nice dice cause true POKE lover know the difference). Add kim chee shocker. The kim chee not sure if make it or buy it. I could just have bowl of the kim chee be set. It not spicy spicy kim chee but just the right amount of kick. Also add masago not only adds great color and makes for great pic. I love the added texture plus the depth adds to the dish. The crunch of the little fried tempura batter, masago, and spicy tuna. Heavenly. The mac salad sort of traditional. They add spaghetti noodles. I have had before give mac salad twist. The star of the show is the poke action for me. 

The menu...stands out is the diversity. Not just like every other poke/burrito bowl. It so so much more. They have kalua pig bowl and beef bowl. Course not just tuna, salmon, and tako. Unlike other spots enjoy and appreciate being from 808. The poke action is legit poke action. It none of this pick your sauce or two just over kill not let the fish stand out. Good poke is all about quality fish. Paina Cafe got u covered. All the poke forgot the bowl just order it by the half pound action or pound. I could have gone there but wanted more full meal with white rice and add some extra toppings. I have not even tapped the menu and look forward to my next visit. 

The interior decor big fan of it. It feels like own style. 808 style for sure!! Some poke places chain multiple locations. Great about this one couple local boys believe owners this only one. The minute you walk in with the slippah action. Scream local style take your slippah off before go into someone house. The hawaiian flag, some of the signs, and the artwork. All the Aloha brand shoyu action. The vibe when you walk in truly got aloha spirt. 

Everyone that works there super cool, friendly, next thing know talking stories like where you from, and again aloha spirit. The music got local hawaiian music chill playing the whole time. 

No doubt. Hot and new Paina Cafe deserves the shout out. I look forward next visit thinking hawaiian style poke.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,7,5,5,pnSnmQILbeDvNctXR5rVYQ

If you LOVE Hawaiian deserts like I do? LoL. (And if you never tried them? What are you waiting for? You're missing out man! Haha) you should definitely try Ono Sweetz deserts (check their instagram @onosweetz) Her cakes and deserts are beautiful and soooooo delicious. 

I absolutely LOVE their tartes. You can buy tartes individually for I believe $1.40 a piece, 6pk for $8 and a 12pk for $15 and you can mix the flavors, so you're able to try each of them. Today I got a 6pk with Haupia [coconut chocolate],Chocolate Macadamia, Paradise[Passion fruit] and my favorite Ube. Yummy!

They have different deserts to choose from. Tartes[comes in different flavors], ube rolls[comes in different flavors], Mango/Haupia Bars, flavored Cakes like Passion fruit, Haupia Pie parfaits and many more. Just keep in mind that some of the deserts do change, so you may not see certain ones twice.

2596186,2017-08-11,1,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"My review is solely for the Hawaiian desserts that they sell in the store. 

- Guava Long John: donut with chantilly creme and two strips of guava inside and out lengthwise, with powdered sugar on top. This one was my favorite out of the bunch. The guava was very flavorful and was wonderfully paired with the soft donut. 

-Ube creme puff: creme puff with Uber filling and purple creme on top. This looked better than it tasted. The creme puff tasted dry and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a couple days old. The purple creme filling on top was hard and unpleasant to eat.

-Choco creme puff: creme puff with chocolate filling topped with chantilly. I liked this better than the ube creme puff. The chocolate filling was literally a chocolate pudding. It oozed out of the creme puff as it was sliced. Paired up nicely with the chantilly creme on top. This creme puff was more moist than the ube creme puff.

-Paina Roll: ube sponge cake rolled between layers of chantilly. This dessert was mediocre. I didn't taste any ube flavor, only sponge cake with sweet creme. 

As you can already tell, they have a very common theme among their desserts: chantilly--sweet whipped creme. Mostly all of their desserts will have this incorporated one way or another. Aside from the vibrant purple color, the ube desserts weren't impressive. They also sell tarts in the refrigerator on the side.

We were starving, didn't know where we were, but the scent of the ocean banging off the boats docked in the marina behind us ping ponged their way through our nasal passages onto our taste buds and begged us for fish. So, we consulted Yelp and it took us across the street to a little shopping center and just like that, we met and fell in love with poke.

So, how awesome was it to see listed under the ""Hot and New"" section or whatever it's called that the Paina Cafe was up and running here in the 9th island called Las Vegas? I thought it was too good to be true but we came anyway. And it was a good thing too, because although all the traffic coming and going through the door of this tiny establishment was brown-faced like mine, they were the faces of my Hawaiian brothers and sisters, which could only mean one thing: this was real deal Hawaiian!

Paina Cafe LV, DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I had the large Poke Crunch Bowl ($11.25) with my choices of brown rice and Spicy tuna, which were served with their special teri glaze blend, shredded nori, and topped with crispy tempura flakes. I added avocado and crispy garlic chips for an extra 60 cents for each topping. I asked the young lady behind the counter for chili water, and at first she said they didn't have any but she'd double check in the back, and she did, and it must've been from their secret, private stash, but she kicked me down with it and I really appreciated it.

Since the young lady was so helpful, we asked her if it was connected to the one in Honolulu, and she confirmed it was. To sum it up, I don't know what they do to their fish, but it was like poke crack! It was SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD!

Both deserts were ono and added the finishing touch to the meal.

2764148,2018-03-18,0,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"Seriously the best Hawaiian Poke place I have tried so far in Las Vegas. Other places don't marinate their fish and still call it poke, but Paina Cafe  marinates their fish and makes it more Hawaiian style. 

I always get their Salmon Poke, and the price varies but it is usually around $10 including tax. You can also get their poke by oz without rice and toppings and that is usually around $8 including tax for 8oz Salmon and Ahi Tuna. Their Ahi Tuna is okay, but it is not as good as Salmon, and they get their 5 stars because their salmon is so good. 

Paina marinates their salmon in soy sauce and what taste like ponzu (but I don't know for sure) with onions and other stuff, and it really brings out the flavor. Also, because it is marinated the poke doesn't have a fishy scent either. When you take a bite in to the salmon poke, you get all the deep flavors and the salmon is so tender it will melt off your mouth. 
I do have to include that their rice is not cooked all the way sometimes and that you can crunch into your rice. That only happened twice, but that is why I get their poke by oz not the whole meal. 

Paina also serves some great Hawaiian treats such as ube rolls and pastries and even snow puffies when you order beforehand. The ube rolls are delicious, but I am not really into sweet pastries. However, if you really love pastries I recommend it!

Their service is also great! And what I love about this place is that service is pretty fast. That having said, try Paina cafe rather than some mediocre poke places that costs just as much.",FgAa6TCVvckaklGXlbqnnQ,0,0,5,2ToTQxG5CCoc1EgEB3CjXw

The friendly staff and ono food make it worth the 25-minute drive to get here...literally almost every week. When you walk into Pa'ina - you instantly feel home.

Some of them come with a hefty price tag, especially if you're like me and buy multiple,  but it's definitely worth the indulgence. 

Here is a review of todays meal:

Sunday Morning Brunch : Loco Moco with Mushroom Gravy. Definite A- ; the flavor of the patty itself is amazing, combined with a beautiful shiitake gravy and egg, the brunch special is a winner. I could certainly do without the chili flakes though. I'll opt-out of that next time.

Spicy Ahi: Pa'ina Cafe is definitely one of Las Vegas' best poke spots. It doesn't get much closer to being in Hawai'i than this.

Combined with Chef Annette's amazing desserts - you can't go wrong. Todays featured desert was a strawberry tart that is literally to die for. Desserts vary every day, so if I'm looking for something in particular, I always call first to see what they have for the day. You can also pre-order all that she has to offer through email. Check out OnoSweetz702 on instagram guys! You'll thank me later ;) I've ordered from her for at least 5 different occasions - and I've never been disappointed.",Ih85YhFRDzOnB09yS__94g,0,0,5,8XBUmkgsGlWd6jsJsA_7Hg
3001795,2018-01-25,1,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"I came specifically to get some tarts as a little souvenir for my housemates back in Omaha (we're all from O'ahu). I had seen pictures of the ube tart on Yelp at both Paina Cafe and Hi-Coffee Cafe and tried tracking down the source (Ono Sweetz 702). After some intensive research, I managed to contact Annette, the mastermind behind the goods. She informed me that she no longer sells to Paina and Hi-Coffee and instead takes online orders. Unfortunately, I was leaving in a few hours and we agreed it'd be cutting it too close to place an order at the time since she makes everything to order. She suggested I head over to Paina as she personally trained them on her recipes.

I decided on two each of the ube, Iilikoi/guava, chocolate haupia, and chantilly tarts ($1.40 each). I also picked up an ube flan roll and a coco puff ($2.95 each) to share with a friend.

My favorite was the ube flan roll. Although the outside was a little dry from being refrigerated, the inside was soft and had a light sweet potato flavor. Huge fan of the flan and ube cream in the roll. Coco puff (cream puff with chocolate filling and chantilly frosting on top) was yummy. I'm not too big on cream puffs, but I could go for another one of these. My friend who has had Liliha Bakery's (home of the OG coco puff) said it's pretty similar, except Paina's is like twice the size. Also ended up trying some of the tarts I brought back haha. They were pretty good, but not worth $1.40 for such a small treat (especially when Annette sells a dozen for $10)!

Paina had a good selection of the tarts left around 2PM, but I was kind of disappointed with the selection they had of the other pastries. I didn't see the Moana roll, matcha/ube cream puff, or guava cake (all of which I wanted to try after seeing pictures of on Yelp). I highly recommend ordering through Annette herself if you can (give her minimum 2 days notice) as it will be FRESH (who knows how long it's been sitting in the display at Paina) and CHEAPER. If not, Paina will do.",3Br2kVqplyN3jbnqwsR2kQ,5,3,3,xIqMPVEwJKqhA3sGLq562w

Very chill music playing in the background and there's a beachy theme going on. There are 5 tables that can seat 4 people each and a larger one in the middle with single seats as well along the wall. 3 different types of soy sauce are on the table: original, premium and low sodium. 

Then build your own bowls are $9.45 for a regular and $10.45 for a large. The small is pretty small so get a large for a dollar more. Their poke choices are spicy tuna, shoyu ahi tuna, wasabi masago ahi tuna, Hawaiian style ahi tuna, soy ginger salmon, sweet chili tofu poke, and two other interesting choices. With each additional topping costing $0.60, the price of a build your own bowl can add up pretty quickly.  I recommend ordering pre set bowls. 

My sister ordered the kewalo bowl which came with white or brown rice, choice of poke with shoyu or hot shoyu with a wasabi mayo drizzle, shredded nori, radish sprouts and red onions. The wasabi added a nice kick to the bowl and wasn't too strong. The ahi tuna was well seasoned and firm, not mushy unlike a few other poke places I've been to.

Moana roll :) whoa totally not expecting the mango flavor.  At least that's what we think it is.  Cuz the bold happy colors in it throw off the mind set.  It's a fun cake roll.  Would make a great kids' cake!

Checked out the poke bowls too.  These were okay.  Already flavored like so no picking your sauces.  Got the brown rice large bowl with Spicy tuna, Hawaiian style ahi poke, Masago, Crunchy Nori, and Avocado.  Only thing that made me :/ is their large bowl only allows 2 poke choices. (4.25****)

Unlike other poke spots in Las Vegas, this spot makes delicious traditional Hawaiian poke where the fish is marinated over time allowing it to have so much more flavor--I've noticed that many other poke spots just throw some (not so fresh) fish into a bowl of rice and add some sauces. 
I ordered the kewalo bowl and everything was absolutely amazing!
I would go here more frequently f it wasn't so far from where I live. Otherwise, this place is top notch and comparable to poke express which has my favorite poke.",ZRezH7CQ0UIeBQqJnF0Czg,0,0,5,8tNba4lNZJCX9C8B-nuYig

Instead they wanted me to buy a california poke bowl and just leave off all of the toppings and just purchase the other 2 poke on the side. That makes no sense! Poke sucked.

Located next to my favorite Asian market, Greenland, is a little slice of home (sweet home).

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with a Hawaii radio station playing all the ""local kine"" jams. Then the workers are extremely happy and smiling, even as I walked in at their 11am opening. Aloha shoyu are the condiments on every table, fun/beachy art work are on the walls and even on the floor.

I ordered the Hawaiian Beef Bowl and my friend got the Poke Crunch Bowl.
I wanted taegu and takuan but, figured my beef bowl wouldn't be as tasty with it so, I ordered it for my friends' bowl =) lol
Also got the pickled garlic on the side. Which I have to tell you, I've never had outside of Hawaii. **in fact, the first time I've ever tried pickled garlic was this past October when I got to try Tanioka's pickled garlic. Paina Cafe's pickled garlic was sooooo gooooooood to eat with ever single bite of my beef bowl...ONO!!!!!!!
Beef bowl was super yummy and not overdosed with ""teriyaki"" sauce, like other places/bowls. Their teriyaki sauce wasn't as sweet as other teri sauces, too, which I love! The GARLIC CHIPS were the best addition to the bowl because, well, who doesn't love garlic -- like really!!??!!!!!
Their Poke Crunch bowl was very tasty with fairly big chunks of ahi and not too soy sauced and overly sweet. The one thing my friend wished he had in his bowl was the garlic chips lol
***note to self: ALWAYS ADD GARLIC CHIPS TO YOUR BOWL!!!!

So happy that another piece of home is right here on the 9th island =) It's (almost) as good as having Zippy's here! Almost.",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,8,6,5,V3G0DUCLoX-aGyA5RajyOQ

Located in the same plaza at Greenland supermarket, Paina Cafe serves up poke bowls the way they are served at home: fish on top of rice. That's it plain and simple. The recent trend of poke bowls and sushi burritos that has been plaguing Vegas has changed the way meaning/expectation of what poke and poke bowls really are in Hawaii.

I still love poke and pretty much any fresh seafood, so I was excited to try Paina Cafe after reading the reviews. I went with my wife during lunchtime. I ordered the Hawaiian Poke Bowl with shoyu poke, kalua pig and lomi salmon, my wife had the nanea salmon bowl. When we got our food I noticed that the poke  cut very small and warm to the touch. The flavor wasn't fresh, and I didn't taste and soy or onion just sesame oil soaked warm fish. The kalua pig was easily the worst I've had, very dry and stringy, also didn't taste fresh and had a pungent gamey flavor. The lomi lomi salmon was the worst part though, I even had to take my bowl up to the counter to let them know they didn't put any salmon in my bowl. They said 'that's it' and pointed and some chopped onion and tomato that I thought was salsa. Upon closer inspection found tiny little pieces of salmon that tasted very fishy. All the lomi lomi salmon I've had in my life had big pieces of fish not unlike the poke I'm used to getting in Hawaii. The bowls had a small amount of protein, were swimming in sauce, lots of rice, and no veggies.  My wife didn't enjoy her meal either, salmon was warm and had no ginger or soy flavor was just sweet and had tons of 'lemon citrus aioli' (mayo),so we just ate enough fish to not leave totally hungry, dumped our bowls, and left completely unsatisfied and disappointed in spending $25 on such an underwhelming lunch for two. No one came by to ask how our meal was and were defensive toward me asking about the missing salmon.

4108288,2017-01-22,1,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"I absolutely loved parts of my meal today, but not all of it, so I must break the seemingly endless tide of complete praise.

I finally followed the hype train to Paina Cafe today. Anyone who follows food has witnessed the increasingly popular fad of ""poke bowls,"" where you can create your own bowl of sauced raw fish with various toppings, but this is the first one I've heard of that actually started in Hawaii, home of traditional poke. This location is in a strip mall next to Greenland Supermarket facing Spring Mountain Rd, and the parking lot was quite packed in the late afternoon.

I didn't feel up to building my own bowl (or Googling some of the names of the toppings), so after consulting a few reviews while in line, I ended up ordering the Large Poke Crunch bowl ($11.25) with my choice of white rice (instead of brown) and toppings including teri glaze, shredded nori, and crispy tempura flakes. The cashier told me that I could order two proteins with this particular bowl, so I did: Hawaiian style ahi poke, and shoyu ginger salmon poke.

The shoyu ginger salmon was at first just a casual add-on for variety's sake, but it become the star of my bowl very quickly. Having had quite a bit of salmon belly lately, I was shocked to find that this tasted just like those recent experiences, rather than standard salmon. It was about as decadent as you can get in anything savory that's not pure globs of fat.

I was rather disappointed with the rest of the bowl. The warm, non-sushi rice did nothing for me, and neither did the Hawaiian style ahi, which was more reportedly sesame oil-focused than the shoyu ahi poke that I was also considering, but didn't really carry that flavor strongly, or any other traditional ingredient for that matter. The ahi itself wasn't that impressive either, with some pieces appearing haphazardly chopped instead of in cube form. Adding some of the Aloha shoyu available table-side did help, but I still couldn't help but see and taste a stark contrast between this so-called ahi poke and the delicious, flavorful by-the-pound poke from a local business that predates the poke bowl phenomenon.

I almost wanted to give the full 5 stars anyway because of the salmon and because of dessert. As confirmed by the cashier, the huge variety of pastries on display are made by a local business called Ono Sweetz 702, and I've tried and enjoyed several of their treats before at a Henderson coffee shop.

I wanted to try pretty much everything, but I settled on just the Mango Carrot Cheesecake ($3.75). It was my first time trying this pastry from Ono Sweetz, and it was spectacular. A shortbread cookie foundation is topped with a carrot cake base and followed by a large layer of mango cheesecake, and the crown is an ube whipped cream garnished with gold flakes and a long, thin piece of chocolate. The ring-shaped piece of dark chocolate was also awesome. This was flavorful, balanced, and pretty enough to be in any high-end pastry shop. Don't tell them about this review or else they'll start getting ideas...

Paina Cafe is a great poke bowl shop with great desserts, but judging from my meal today, it's not the be all and end all of all things poke. Still, I'd come back any time for the salmon and the pastries, and I'd also love to try the shoyu ahi, tako, or their cooked offerings such as kalua pig, beef, and ahi katsu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,8,4,q6Vqu2SBG2I61z56SVscvg

4147685,2018-03-16,1,9km51KaQujxsSgdaG9gYSw,"I don't like poke but I came to a place that specializes in poke for lunch yesterday. You may be wondering why. Well, I came with a couple of co-workers and they like poke. Besides, Pa'ina has more than just poke. 

I ordered fried saimin with bulgogi beef. It also came with a side of rice and a side of kimchi. I enjoyed it all. Fried noodles are always good. The beef was ultra tender. The rice was simply white rice but mixed with the kimchi was very good. Kimchi has a strong enough flavor that it makes an impact on even the plain white rice. It all made for a delicious lunch. 

I got a little more bold and adventerous when I tried a bite of the tako poke my co-worker ordered. It was my first taste of octopus. Sure, I've had similar creatures like squid (fried calimari) and cuddle fish (freeze dried and dressed with chili sauce). But this was a full on tentacle with suction cups. Thats has always scared me a bit. But I tried it. It was chewy and didn't really taste like much. It was not as bad as I expected but I would not order for myself in the future. Just not my thing.

No burrito-style poke on this menu. So, we are good. 

It was 'ono. Just like the P?'ina Cafe back at Ward. I ordered the Hawaiian bowl with spicy ahi. Only bad part was when the bowl was empty!

I used to eat at the original spot back home in Hawaii and needless to say, it definitely did not disappoint. I ordered the Paina bowl which is one of their original bowls. It consists of rice (I got white), topped with spicy tuna, nori flakes and their own teri glaze sauce. To my surprise the cashier told me that I was allowed one other protein so I added the Hawaiian Style Ahi poke. Let's just say, I devoured it! The poke was so fresh and the sweetness of the teri glaze was a great addition to the meal. I'm very simple when it comes to poke bowls/burritos and I would much rather not have all the additional toppings to it was perfect. Another plus is all the delicious desserts! They have several different flavored tarts - we got the north shore and ube tart. The north shore tart was a layer of haupia under a layer of chocolate...soooo damn ono! The ube tart was also good however, you don't get the flavor of ube as much but it was still good. Aside from what we ordered, they have many more local Hawaii desserts. 

I read a review regarding the service and that person wasn't too pleased with it. With that said, my boyfriend and I did not get any snarky attitude.

I know I should being Asian and all but ginger and cilantro is a yuck in my book. 

The sweets...I have to say that I've enjoyed the puffs and the tarts the most. I've tried the snow puffies and aloha Haupai bar and that was way too sweet for my taste. However, I definitely would go back to get the puffs or even order an chantilly cake. My husband said that people just go there to order sweets too so heads up if you want some they sell out quick.

The eclairs are definitely one of kind, and this Hawaiian style is pretty difficult to find on the mainland. 

Bowls ordered were the salmon Paina and the Hawaiian. The salmon was a great taste and color and a good portion. With the Hawaiian, the Lomi salmon was on point, but the Kalua pig was subpar, lacking the smokey flavor and juiciness, I'm used to having. The pulehu Tako was good, although, I prefer the plain, and much thinner cuts. It's so chewy to begin with.

Walked in after work (I just found out it's on the way home from me!) - atmosphere is modern, open, and clean with an island feel. The staff greeted me right away, I ordered to go and was offered a water cup while I wait. Don't mind if I do!

Now the food - Got 4oz of Tuna and 8oz of Salmon as well as a half dozen of assorted tarts.

The fish is extremely fresh and they pack it full. Poke is always a balance of sauce and fish. Sometimes it's too strong and you lose the fish flavor. Sometimes it's like ""did you even add sauce?"" - but Paina does it right! The fish flavor comes through but is not drowning. The green and white onion are a nice crunch and punch of onion flavor. 

The tarts - must get! There were maybe 6 or so flavors when I was there, but got 3 of them.  Paradise, Chantilly, and Ube (thanks Yelpers!). Paradise was a nice mix of tropical fruits (that I forgot, sorry!); Chantilly, sweet whipped cream topping with chocolate on the inside, and of course the Ube. All of them were damn good. But Ube had to take the tart! Paradise came in second and I am not sure if I would get Chantilly again, but I would recommend the others! All of the fillings are velvety and smooth and the tart ""shell"" is buttery and flavorful. One thing to note is that these tarts are two-biters and do not crumble after you bite into it.

Since coming here, I have dropped all other poke places from my mind. I will also be looking into getting one of their specialty cakes for a party coming up. Will update in the future about those!",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,5,5,5,eZhaysCjRzsV7IcTQQQu5A

Options from local plates, desserts, coffee places and most recently poke places have been sprouting left and right. Some are definitely better than others.

A recent discovery is Paina and quickly becoming a favorite. Not only is the food good but the Aloha spirit is strong here, service is always on point and the 3 times I've been here not once did we leave disappointed.

Concept is pretty simple and fail proof. Order your base, either white or brown rice then poke of your choice: Spicy tuna, Shoyu Ahi, Hawaiian style Ahi, Wasabi Masago Ahi, Shoyu Ginger Salmon, Sweet Chili Tofu and Tako poke when available. After that you choose from the variety of toppings they offer like Masago, Furikake, Takuan, Crispy garlic chips to name a few. Then voila! a bowl of deliciousness before your eyes, meant to be savored and not devoured lol. If you're like me and too many choices confuse you, they offer Paina signature bowls. Of those the Nanea Salmon poke bowl is the one that calls to me: Brown rice with Ginger Salmon Poke drizzled with lemon citrus aioli with red onions, radish sprouts, masago and shredded Nori. Yaaasssssss!

If raw fish is not for you, their menu boasts of options like Kalua Pig, Beef bowl and Ahi Katsu. I have tried the latter and I loved it! Perfectly crisp on the outside but still moist. Also a must try, the hubby's fave! Inari with rice topped with Spicy tuna, it's genius! A meal in itself but perfect to be shared as an appetizer. Salad is offered for those that are conscious of their carb intake, and poke by the ounce is sold as well.

In one of the visits we spoke with the owner and he excitedly shared with us that they have a lot of stuff in the works right now. Promos, new offerings, menu line up and such. So excited for what's to come! Recently, I heard that they've partnered up with Ono Sweetz bringing in more sweetness in the joint.

1. Ube cake roll: filled with ube cream and custard. Little fancy gold paper on top, the cake part was super moist and not over sweet! Also the gold paper on top made it look so fancy~

2. Mango cheesecake: I loved each bite of it ! The texture of this cake was on another level. I could taste the light cream, chunks of mango fruit and, creamy cheesecake part, at the end the the shortbread! The chef mixed toasted pecan with the shortbread, so yummy

3. Cream puffs: so so so good!! I was wondering what's on top of the puff before I bite into it. Also I was worried abt it being too creamy and sweet! But no! When I bite in! Oh god !!!! It's was just so balanced and perfect texture !!!

""Help yourselves, it's better than those silly bowls you ordered"".  Famous last words as they devoured my offerings (and lunch) while discovering don't mess with a good thing.

It's about time.  A Hawaii poke restaurant in Vegas.

Sure, it doesn't have the best rating in Hawaii (we got high standards since lots of places make killer poke from fish and limu pulled from the ocean just hours before), but it definitely blows away the other pretenders hawking ""Hawaiian poke"".    Wisely, they also serve enough ""Cali"" style poke and poke bowls to keep everyone happy.

Straight to it, the ahi poke, previously frozen fish, properly thawed and well handled (not gassed nor color added) cut into mid sized cubes.  Firm texture and good flavor as expected.  The shoyu ahi with its crisp, sweet white onion, finely chopped scallion, sesame oil and most importantly Aloha shoyu and wasabi masago, just as its name implies.  Zero complaints. If they have it, grab some tako poke.  No translucency (sign of repeated freezing and thawing), tender and tasty.  For a special treat, the pulehu tako.  Sure it looks bad but it taste oh so good!

Spicy ahi, salmon, and tofu poke also offered (not sampled).

All poke sold by the pound or if you absolutely must, the dreaded poke bowl.  Signature bowls adapted for Mainland taste.  Do it yourself with minimal but chosen to match toppings also offered.

Friendly off Strip counter service.  Pricing slightly higher than others in the Valley.

I also tried their ube custards, and they are DELICIOUS! For Thanksgiving, I ordered the big ube custard, which turned out to be more like an egg pie with ube on the top layer.

Best Poke in area.  I've seen new Poke or sushi burrito spots pop up around town, and they're good, but the quality, creativity, and authenticity of Paina stands out from the rest. I feel like I've locked in my go-to spot for this dish, and let me tell you why...

Great location: It's right at the intersection of two major streets, Rainbow and Spring Mountain (NE corner). Plus, there's a huge lot, so parking is never an issue.

Authentic atmosphere: I haven't stepped into the adjacent businesses, but I can say Paina's got the cleanest, patron friendly, comfortable environment.  It's all attributed to the Hawaiian music in the background, Disney's Lilo & Stitch playing on the tv's, USB outlets for your charging needs, and all the simple Hawaiian decorations that all exist to transport you to the islands. (It all makes sense too, because this Vegas location is their first mainland venture after years of business in Honolulu)

Friendly staff: Now I haven't been to Hawaii in a while, but I know the moment your plane touches down there, you're welcomed with a smile by the community.  It's no different at Paina. The owner (I've met one of them), individuals taking your order, and preparing your meal execute a fantastic dining experience whether dining in or taking it to go.

THE FOOD: So delicious. On this visit I went with my first choice, Hawaiian Poke Bowl ($9.95) which is simply choice of poke (I chose Spicy Tuna), along with Lomi (a type of salted) Salmon and Kalua pork, over choice of white or brown rice.  Customize it more with several choices of toppings for $.60 each - I added shredded nori (seaweed) and furikake (chopped sesame, and more nori seasoning). And it was oh, so good.  

I want to also mention, on my first visit I had the one of Paina's signatures, the Kimura Ahi Katsu Bowl ($10.25) and today tried my friends Poke Crunch Bowl ($9.95), another signature bowl, and both were so good it's tough to choose a favorite.

Salmon lomi was very good too, but very little salmon and mostly tomato. Fine for me, but hubby likes a little more fish in his lomi than tomatoes. Spam musubis were the bomb!

Next time I will do without the pickles and roe but the avocado and crab were delicious. I'm obsessed. 

They have spam musubi and it was pretty tasty! They were down to two and she gave me the last one on the house. Their dessert case is awesome too. Ube flat roll, Ube cream puff, Ube tart, Ube custard pies. I was in Ube heaven.

But we had the chicken katsu and poke bowl and my husband loved it! He even said the Kalua pig in his poke bowl was kind of weird but when he started eating it, he ate it all! Lol. Even tho the chicken katsu didn't look like zippys it is definitely the best out here in the mainland! I mean portions and taste. The salad was different but still good. Thanks for the ono local food, we will be eating here more often lol. My husband also tells me he thinks you guys have Chantilly cupcakes!? Been craving Hawaiian Chantilly since we moved here last year! Lol need to check that out!",UCpNBr3pKF1OqdBmVzjjLw,0,0,5,NT3zl4PEIxpYgdzNKN-hcA

My husband and i are PICKY when it comes to our food. We only eat out sometimes unless its a spot we love. And we havent found that here. More so because its lacking one thing more than the other. Until we tried Pa'ina cafe that is...

Lets start with customer service: 

EXCELLENT - they were open on easter! Amazing. Gave them a phone call to see if their hours changed and the girl over the phone said that their hours were the same. Super impressed. We took the drive and when we arrived, we were warmly greeted (just like back at home!) 
I was so excited and she didnt seem uninterested in my excitement and gave me GREAT poke recommendations. 

Food - high quality, PACKED! Two plates of their teri chicken all rice fed all four of my kiddos with a little extra for my toddler. Poke was PRIME we ate at poke express had other pokes here in LV but this took us back home big time. Big props to their cube size poke too. Impressed with everything!!!!! I also bought their tartes. That is also amazing!!!! Im not sharing with anyone haha. 

Oh and they have hawaiian sun juice  

AMBIENCE - oh my gosh, simplicity but local style at its finest. Very clean lots of room. 

Over all i'll be back hopefully weekly for this especially since its right up the road from our house. We received a warm welcome and a warm goodbye from the whole staff. Thank you Pa'ina cafe for making our easter AMAZING!!!",ojT9F7EuGFvuxvnUmtgEWQ,0,0,5,QCW-HcYaIzFn5_Lg8zu3tw

I savored each and every bite, I had one half for lunch and saved the other half for dinner. They have a good selection of dessert that I'd like to try on my next visit. This place will be my go to for my poke bowl fix.",0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,0,0,5,SaOxqAKCGAJDfWvXvohsqg
