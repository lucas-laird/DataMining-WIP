Well, the lettuce was wilted, the steak was tough not tender like in Cali.  My daughter got quesedilla with fries and I would say the fries were the best thing but is that what they're known for???  They came to ask how was everything?  I showed them the wilted lettuce...the waitress  said oh...I'll tell the manager...and we waited...nothing happened.  The manager didn't come out to say anything or may be she didn't even mention it.

182873,2015-04-27,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"I give Wahoos a one star due to the sad fact that they actually MICROWAVE some of their dishes. If you are in Las Vegas Boca Park location (franchise) and you order an enchilada for example, be prepared to eat some Styrofoam from the take out box that they put the enchiladas in before microwave heating. My and my wife's enchiladas packed in separate Styrofoam holders for takeout,  both are overheated cheese stuck to the perimeter of the foam holder with clear signs that the holder and enchiladas had been superheated in the microwave oven.   Forget fresh food for some of their dishes. Now the phish? tacos that I get always seem fresher and show no signs of microwave usage. A restaurant is only as good as its food and this is presented poorly. Sad, as I have been eating at the original Wahoo's in Costa Mesa on Placentia St. and never had a bad dish there. I guess Wahoos is no different then the other fast food joints now that they have found success. Farewell to quality.",B1t2ppj3yKkEDg9gNqJCqQ,0,0,1,IqNwbiwrbHwEAls8p8-8dQ

About 10 years ago, they opened a location on the strip in the Hawaiian marketplace. Unfortunately, it went bust after only a few months. Luckily, there's a new Wahoo's in town and now I can get my Wahoo's fix. My go-to meal is the Maui bowl - marinated steak with seasoned rice and beans. This particular Wahoo's has gotten it right (tender steak, slightly rare) and gotten it all wrong (beef jerky on rice, anyone?). Your mileage may vary.

There's a special late night menu at the bar, along with a discount if you're in the hospitality industry. Hey, it sure as hell beats Del Taco at 3 am.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,3,1,4,UYFQZT6uvc2z6KC6P81LBw

My husband and i got take out at the nearest wahoos on rainbow. We purchaced $30 worth of tacos and condiments. When we got home we discovered that none of the tacos had any dressings. They were nothing more than tortilla, meat, lettus. No pico, no slaw. NOTHING. I would never pay 30$ for meat and lettus. Not to mention the meat tasted terrible that night. No flavor at all. I called immediatly assuming I would just speak to a manager and come get some replacements. Well the employee Vinny explained to me that he couldnt help me and their manager was not there for the night and there was no one else I could talk to. So I asked him to take my name and number and have them get back to me the next day. 2days later I called again at 5pm and another employee again tells me there is no manager on duty. So I gave him my name and phone number and explained the situation he said he would put my info on his managers desk. Its been 3weeks and no one ever got back to me.

Now, I am a bit picky when it comes to that. I ordered the fish ""taquitos"" and asked the cashier if it was spicy and he said no. I then proceeded with the order and around 6 minutes later a lady comes and hands me what appears to be a beef taquito. I was confuse because from the picture, I thought I had order ""soft shell"" fish tacos. Plus, it did not look like fish it looked like beef because the meat inside was black. I was baffled and the lady then asked me if it was the order I had ordered. I didn't want to make a situation worse and then Tashia, our food delivery attendant that was assisting us asked, ""Would you like me to bring you the correct order and would you want it with the same side orders?"" I was thrown aback because nowadays, no one does that, they first argue with you or make you pay extra for an incorrect order! I was so ecstatic that she asked.

And I hear they will be opening another location soon in Boca Park.  The atmosphere at this Wahoo's is even better than the one I remember from California, although it was cold the night we dined there (doors were open). Large restaurant -- respectable list of beers, which I loved. And several truly healthy options on the menu, too. I happen to be addicted to the power chopper salad with spicy white beans and fish. We also ordered a Banzai Bowl. Check out the happy hour from 3 to 7. This place also has extensive options for vegetarians. And their beverage options are fantastic. I'm not a soda person so usually do water or beer with my salad at Wahoo's, but here, they have three kinds of iced tea - mango, tropical green, and plain. Sodas and sobe lean beverages. (Definitely buy the large cup so you can get 75 cent refills on your return trip)  They were SUPER accommodating to my special requests (brown rice on the side, dressing on the side)",il9YGi12gRza4IcfskDcRw,2,0,4,fMBbRZGD5DeCuuycrAyHvw

The food is just as great as SO CAL. Service is excellent. Go see Nikki in the bar. Very friendly.  But what is better about  the Vegas location is a 24/7 full menu and bar.

Funny name for a Mexican restaurant that doesn't want to be a Mexican restaurant.

Is all about surfing and skate boarding and biking and all the kinds of clothing that goes with it like vans and Oakley and volkom etc. etc. I felt like I was at the mall food court.

2028450,2017-07-14,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"Yesterday I felt the need to try a new restaurant, and was really feeling fish tacos, so my boyfriend and I ended up here. We walked in and instantly notice the laid-back vibe and half indoor, half outdoor bar, which we thought was pretty cool. The woman who took our order was also very nice and helpful, so we decided to stay. 

The first thing I found very interesting was that, for a place called Wahoo's Fish Tacos and More, Fish tacos were really underplayed and there was definitely a lot of focus on the 'more'. The selection was sparse and not really what I was looking for so I ultimately ended up getting the monthly special: a California Burrito (Carne Asada, Fries, cheese, pico, and lots of avocado/avocado sauce), chips and salsa, and a drink. My boyfriend got the Shredder Sandwich with Fish and we decided to share an order of Baja Rolls, all of which totalled about $28 (not bad!).

We found a table, and did not have to wait long for our food to arrive. My burrito looked great, but ended up being rather unremarkable. My boyfriend felt the same about his sandwich, and the only thing you could really taste in the Baja Rolls was the cream cheese. After adding some hot sauce, things got better. 

All-in-all, the food was alright and the experience was good, not great. We did notice that they had some bar specials ($2.95 Pacificos!) and they seem to have a pretty good happy hour, so we decided we would return someday to try it out.",I4rTxVq_coTwbWTn2LYKrg,0,0,3,JnWy8jIy5c1KbOyZdr3zDg

2206299,2012-01-25,1,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"The Skinny: supposedly healthy Mexican fusion with very little flavour (2) counter service is efficient but nothing special, where the hell is the salsa bar? (2) value: $6.50 for a huge tasteless plate of white rice and beans with little protein and veg? that's a little pricey (2).

We've been waiting forever for the Wahoos to open at the Boca location. However we spotted the large sign on the 215 stating that there was one just off Rainbow. Ecstatic, my hubby brought us in to taste their fusion healthy take on Mexican classics.

This particular restaurant is outfitted to serve as both a bar and a restaurant. If you are adverse to cigarette smoke, stay away from the booths closest to the bar area. Even though there is a wall separating the two areas, the smell of smoke does waft through the open door to the bar into the eating area. You have been warned!

Ordering is a breeze really. Pick your filling (Chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, fish, mushrooms, tofu, veggies) then decide whether your want it in a taco, enchilada or burrito style. If you don't feel like doing it Mexican style, you can also order in a bowl over rice. Or you can just get a salad, soup or your standard sides (quesadillas, chips and salsa, nachos, etc.) Combination plates come with rice and beans instead of your standard chips.

Well, feeling a little hungrier than usual, I opted for their standard combination plate ($6.50) - two carnitas tacos with white rice and black beans. The hubs tried two different styled fish tacos and tried their white beans instead.

I would like to say that the combination plates aren't that healthy. Even though they might be low in fat, you can't tell me a massive plate of white rice with very little vegetables (what was on top of the tacos) is healthy. Filling, yes. Healthy, not so much. It may be healthier if they offered a salad option instead of beans and rice.

Okay, enough of my rant on nutrition and on to the food.

I have to say for the above mentioned carnitas and fish tacos (grilled in two different styles) were rather lacking in flavour. I actually used the salt shaker on the table. Here's the thing - I never use salt at the table (you can ask my husband). The pico de gallo served on top of the tacos used rather mealy overripe tomatoes which lead to an unpleasant texture. As well, I don't think they really dried off the cabbage/lettuce very well because the tortillas were sopping wet.

The beans were okay but nothing spectacular. I think the white cajun beans had more seasoning and hence, tasted better than the black beans. The rice was standard issue, nothing that exciting.

I was also disappointed to the lack of a salsa bar. As a Mexican fusion place, you gotta at least have some sort of salsa and limes around. Nope. The closest thing was the stack of lemons for your iced tea by the soda fountain. Lame.

Overall, given the lackluster flavours, the soggy textures and the lack of a salsa bar, I feel no overwhelming urge to have a repeat experience. Although relatively inexpensive, the food just isn't that good and holds no value in my books. A 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,2,2,EV7SO2Pkw-smQjhfdA7EtA

The only thing that was missing was the sand all over the floor. Darn they need too work on that one. Lol! Wahoo Fish Tacos is affordable tacos, good portion, and like laid back southern california feel too it. If billabong, quicksliver, go on and on surfing. Then not too mention all the skateboard brand names. The posters it totally feels like rad place too hang out with friends whether it be in the restaurant or the bar area. Not that into any of those things but if your fan definitely love the decor and vibe.

The food its your basic mexican food nothing really out there with WoW factor. I ended up getting the The Kahuna Grande. Like mention earlier get great value for the price because all the Combo Platters comes with rice (choose from steam, spanish) and beans (refried, black, and believe one other option). The Kahuna Grande you get choice of one taco or enchilada I went with the enchilada. Also three tequitos for all three get choose your protein. That another list of things too choose from so when it comes too options there are plenty too choose from plus even go healthy. I when with carne asada for enchilada then chicken for tequitos. Overall I liked the whole dish felt like everything was okay. The carne asada had nice flavor too it and combine with the enchilada sauce on top nice combination of flavor. The tequitos just okay. The black bean side was fabulous! I liked that the black beans was cooked perfect and had nice flavor. The steamed rice was just steamed rice nothing special. The guacamole was terrible. Me if there was anything that not fan of it was the guacamole. I feel like not even fresh made and just off with no flavor whatsoever. The salsa was ok. I came with my brother family so got too try the cajun chicken nachos. Just not fan. It was way heavy top loaded and not very good. 

I like the fact that the prices are great for under $10 get lot. Food is ok nothing special but being close too home if ever want quick mexican food other then Robertos. Wahoo Fish Tacos is place that come back too again..",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,1,3,77XNVnfzWpGl7IdgAGGaCQ

About two years ago I started writing wahoos about opening a las Vegas restaurant and they kept me in the loop contacting me every so often about the plans. So I literally jumped for joy when this location opened. No more driving five hours for me.

Driving up, I felt like a little girl headed to Disneyland, I wares to jump out of my seat. I was a little taken back by the location and the out side look. For starters it's in an unpopulated area and it's also weird looking. You can tell this wahoos used to be a bar. At all of the wahoos I've been to in ca none of them looked as weird or out of place as this wahoos.

The service was fast and friendly but you could tell the workers are still a little not used to the place. Rey are polite and helpful but lack the outgoing personality that I've seen from other workers at other locations. At least it's one step in the right direction. Prices were cheap especially compared to the Pasadena location. Portions are huge, like always. I noticed that the fish was a little more fishy than I remember an lacked a by of spice. Over all it was still pretty darn tasty. Good amount of cabbage and salsa. Personally one line is not enough for two large tacos but then again I'm a line whore :) the black beans we're rich an full of flavor. You can tell they are coked with good spices when I asked they said they are cooked with onions.. I knew it! The white rice was good. Way too much for my appetite but for others in are they like that. There's way more than enough for two people do for others I would suggest ordering the combo and splitting it

Its weird to see inside that it's 24 hours, with an open bar, and slot machines but I'm not in too much shock because I know this is las Vegas an they have to compete with other restaurants and what they offer. It's just something I'm going to have tiger used too but heat the same time of I'm craving fish tacos at one in the morning I know I'm going to get my fix. Now that rocks my socks folks.

This place could use a little improvement but I'm cutting wahoos some slack cause t just opened and it has some different qualities that makebit different from the other ones

Come on out an give wahoos a try, it's a great fast and healthy alternative to the normal lunch places",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,2,0,4,0vUGwb_iKk9Z0vJOIeG2pQ

2549867,2012-10-15,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"This is a bitter sweet restaurant to me.  I always go here when I am feeling health conscious.  The fish is grilled instead of fried, the food is not very oily.  I love that.  On that same note, the food lacks a punch.  I think because it is prepared on the healthier side, the food lacks flavor.  I wish the fish had more spices, I hate having to compensate for it with their homemade hot sauce, it's so spicy!!  I end up mainly tasting the hot sauce instead of my food, I have made this mistake several times!

But I still give it four.  The portions are big, and the food can be prepared clean and healthy, everyone is really nice, the restaurant is fun and high energy.

Random thought:  I secretly wish the veggies could be added to the burrito without teriyaki sauce.  Never been a fan of the teriyaki.  Since we're going healthy here, we might as well go all the way and go no sauce!!",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,2,1,4,XSt1yJKWjPBVqU_wGtkQ3Q

A few weeks ago ( Thursday night) we returned after midnight to go have a drink with friends since we live close by. The place was empty maybe about 5 people scattered around the bar. We came into the bar area just my wife and I to wait for our friends... The bartender at the moment was talking to one of her customers so we sat patiently to wait for her to get to us.. ( by this time she had seen us and turn back to talk to her customer friend and not even acknowledge that we were there, not even the smallest gesture she could ever made to make sure we knew that  she knew that we were waiting)... but still sat patiently and waited .. now I work in the industry and after 3 minutes of waiting and hearing their loud conversation from across the bar I think that will piss off any customer since you don't even have the smallest delicacy to go and say "" Hi , how are you guys doing? Ill be right back "" that would have sufficed instead of ignoring us and keep your ladies night talk which every other customer ( 5 people maybe) are  hearing  you , my wife said lets just get up and go just to prove a point so we did!...

2927295,2012-02-15,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"I've never been to a Wahoos before, so I didn't know what to expect. When you walk in, it's definitely has a California/Hawaiian vibe with pictures of people snowboarding, surfing, biking, etc. It's one of those places where you go up to the cashier and order, then wait at a table for your food. We were probably staring at the menu for about 5 minutes before ordering because we were a little confused at first. I kind of thought they'd just have something that said FISH TACOS, but they didn't because you pick what filling you want (chicken breast, carnitas, fish, carne asada, shrimp, tofu mushrooms, Banzai veggies). They have starters, tacos, enchiladas, combo plates, bowls, burritos, salads, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and a pretty nice drink list. In fact, one of the first things I noticed was their daily drink specials. On Wednesdays, women get a complimentary Mimosa with any purchase, so of course I brought that to their attention when we ordered our two combo plates (2 taco plate and burrito plate). 

On the way to our table, we stopped to get a fountain drink and noticed they actually had a pretty decent selection of freshly brewed iced tea (Mango, Tropical Green, and Natural Black). Our food came our pretty fast and the first thing we noticed was that the plates came with a LOT of rice. Now that I think of it, this place IS suppose to have a Mexican/Brazilian/Asian menu and I can see they executed that with the rice, tofu, tacos, enchiladas, etc. I had one grilled fish taco and one Cajun fish taco. Both had a lot of cabbage and salsa, which made them very fat. I really enjoyed the grilled one. The Cajun taco was a little over seasoned for my taste though. I hardly touched my rice because it seemed a little flavorless to me, so I stuck to the black beans. This was the first time I've ever preferred brown rice over white rice because it had more flavor (I tried some of Don's).

Overall, this is a great place for lunch or even some very late munchies since they're open 24 hours! They also have A LOT of drink specials, which is always a plus.

Tips:
-Join their player's club
-You should try their Banana margarita and tell me how it tastes
-Don't just stick to fish tacos because it's in their name. They have lots of other tasty looking menu items
-Happy hour daily 3-7pm: 1/2 off draft beer, house wines, well drinks

Their mild green sauce is pretty good but I really enjoyed Mista Ree's sauce the best.  It tastes like the main ingredient is Korean hot chili paste.  The cajun and grilled fish is pretty mild, so I would smother the sauce all over the taco's.

The taco platters are huge.  You get a big heaping serving of rice and black beans.  Seriously, you can probably share the meal with a friend.

Their chicken tortilla soup was also very tasty - very homey with a little bit of heat.

On a late Saturday afternoon, I was expecting there to be a bit of a wait and to my surprise it was actually pretty dead.

Wahoo's is one of them. In fact they have just the opposite of both. Great food and great service!

The set up on how you are helped is not the standard but it works for them. You know the walk in and a server seats you whole thing? Yeah.. No here you walk in order at the counter pay at the counter and then they bring your food out to you. I always wonder what is the reasoning of some food places who do this but hey if it works for them it works. 

The menu is extensive and I found myself a bit overwhelmed with what to actually order and not even that but what option to order it in. For example.. If you order the fish burrito like I did you have about 3-4 different styles it can be made. People like me struggle with menus who provide too many options because the inner fat boy wants ALL the options.. The cashier who also was our server helped me out and I decided on ordering my Salmon burrito ""Mr. Lee's SCReaM'n style"" awesome suggestion because I loved every last bite. Only thing that kept them from getting that 5th star was the margaritas weren't good..

FOOD
- Combo Platter - 2 fish tacos and a bowl of Cajun White beans (no rice): The portions are large, and I was glad I didn't order this combo with rice (you get a choice of white or brown rice). The beans were floating around in too much liquid. Also, I just didn't like the taste. I ordered one Cajun taco and one grilled. The tortillas and fish for both tacos were dry, not flavorful. 

- Wahoo's Fish Bowl: I went with the grilled fish option, though there are Cajun and teriyaki choices. The ""bowl"" comes with a choice of rice (white or brown) and a side of shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. Again, my meal was bland and dry. The popular ""Mr. Lee's"" sauce didn't do much with improving the flavor (not spicy enough for my taste anyway). 

- Wahoo Salad (shrimp): It's an enormous salad, but basic. Topped with cheese, salsa, guacamole, and whatever kind of fillings you want to include. The salad was the best entree I ever ordered at this Wahoo's, but it was still just average. 

SERVICE
If I had to choose one aspect I like about this restaurant, it's the service. Service has always been good at this location.  When one of the cashiers forgot to apply a discount to my order, he gave me a coupon for a free taco for my next visit, which is worth more than the discount. There's also a kind and helpful waitress who's always served myself and dining companions with a smile. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name at the moment.

I'm sorry fellow Yelpers, but I was hugely disappointed.  After reading everyones reviews I was excited when I finally had the chance to try this place.  I was so hungry but not even that gave me a reason to rave about the taste and quality of the food.

I ordered the combination plate with a grilled fish taco, and a carne asada enchilada.  My plate came with black beans and white rice (even though I specifically asked for brown).  Everything on my plate was bland except for the mild green salsa which I'll have to say was the only good part of my meal.  I had to dip everything into this salsa to get a good taste out of anything on my plate.  The grilled fish taco had no taste at a;;!  The fish was a thick piece, and because it was o thick, it's bland taste took over the entire taco.  It was dry, and disappointing.  The carne asada enchilada I had was mediocre because the meat inside was chewy and in addition, difficult to chew down and swallow!  I was questioning how old the beef is or if they cooked it too long.  I like my beef to be tender!

I was really upset that my experience turned out the way that it did.  I guess I'm used to the authenticity of some other mexican food joints.  But even the american infused ones such as Rubios taste way better than the food here.

I do give it a couple stars for the bar they hav in there w/ video poker and TVs to watch your favorite sports.  They also have daily drink specials which is pretty cool too.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,0,0,2,n-iKa3IMLHHtOE9L6L0t_A
4014510,2012-01-03,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"Let's start the new year off with some healthy eating!

I have been waiting a long time for Wahoos Fish Taco to come to Las Vegas!  And it's finally here!  And it's a big step up from that place with the bell in the logo!

Fresh, fast, and wholesome..Wahoos is a place every personal trainer can love!  The X-treme athletes and surfers dig it as well.  Pretty evident by all the cool skate, surf, and snowboarding stuff used to decorate the place.  It's a nice change of pace and a good place to hang out and grub with your friends after a long day of play.

Wahoos is a nice mix of Mexican-American with an Asian flair (founders are some righteous Asian surfer dudes) with a great amount of good complex carbs and protein.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor with lots of items having low amounts of fat.  You got starters, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, bowls, and salads and sandwiches to soothe a hungry appetite.  The kids get their own menu too.

My fav starters are the Maui Onion Rings (which coincidentally are fried and fatty yum) and the nachos with chicken.  The choice of fillings for your entrees are phenomenal:

-Chicken - Grilled or Cajun
-Carnitas 
-Fish - Grilled or Cajun
-Carne Asada
-Shrimp
-Tofu
-Mushrooms
-Vegetarian
-Banzai Veggies - bell peppers, onions, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, and cabbage all sauteed with their house teriyaki sauce

My go to is usually one of their combo plates, combo #4 to be exact ""The Kahuna"".  It has your choice of one taco, one burrito or enchilada.  Each combo comes with white or brown rice (for a little more), and black or cajun beans.  My #1 filling is their grilled fish, it goes excellent on their tacos!  I like the fish or chicken on my burrito, and I often add some Banzai Veggies to it.  It's a full meal!

Wahoos is good on the wallet too, items on the menu go from the $5-8 range.  Gettin' full on a tiny budget, that's what it's all about!  Service is fast and friendly too.  This Wahoos is also fully equipped with a bar!  Wanna hang out with your friends and get some primo drinks and eats?  Do it all here in one place!  Sure beats some of the local dives around town here.  

You'll be glad to know too that Wahoos will be opening another location here in the Summerlin area of town real soon...right in Boca Park!  All I need now is some sand beneath my feet, a pair of bright floral surf shorts, my Blu Blocker sunglasses, some SPF on my nose, and a shave ice in my hand.

The prices are reasonable, especially for alcohol.  On this particular day, wine was 1/2 off so you could get a glass for $2.50.  Pacificos were $1-$2.  

I ordered the Baja-ladas (essentially a spin on enchiladas).  When I think of enchiladas, I salivate in anticipation for something piping hot with molten cheese and flavorful sauce.  I got a cold chicken wrap topped with luke warm sauce, filled with raw spinach.  Big boo.  Literally, the inside was cold, and raw.  Not good.  The rice and beans lacked pizazz as well.

What I love the most about this place is it is opened 24/7 with food and drinks.  Oh yeah!  

As for the food, my enchilada was tasty and my shrimp tacos was ehh. My guy pal got the bonsai plate with Cajan fish that was oh so very good.  I was pretty jealous.  Otherwise, this is another great place to grab a late night dinner or another place to sober after a night of partying.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,4,5,5,SJxx90cFdo0B0bYLiRGOEw
4154398,2013-04-06,6,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"I've read numerous reviews this Nevada Wahoos is not what you'd get in California. I don't know about that. I've never had Wahoos in California before, but all I can say is that place is sub-par. 

The ambiance is basically totally generic. There are lots of snowboarding and skate stickers pasted all over the place. I'm not sure what that means. Do snowboarders and skaters know what really good Mexican food is? Is that supposed to sway me or be cool? I've frequented really dumpy skater restaurants/bars before, but they were much worse, but in a good way (which gets points in my book because they're actually good). I've frequented really dumpy Mexican restaurants before and they were ALL good.

I usually give a place two chances (unless I love it) before I dump on it, but this place is pretty mediocre. 

You basically order at a fast food window, sit down at a table, then a guy brings the food out to you. Which he did. The first time my friend ordered a burrito and told them no cheese (like four times - he hates cheese because he's an idiot in my opinion - but he hates cheese). I ordered basically the same thing with cheese with sour cream. They never game me my sour cream and gave my friend cheese on his burrito. When i bit into my burrito, like 4 ounces of mystery liquid came out of it. Gross. 

The second time I came to this place a friend of mine bit into a chicken taco and was about to throw up. I'm not sure it was the food though. It's pretty bad, but not enough to throw up. He's probably just a drama queen. 

My second time I ordered a burrito without any vegetables and it was just okay. Nothing I'd come back for.

In my opinion, if you're really lazy and want to eat something good there are like a hundred other places down the street. However, the bar looked decent and probably had some NCAA basketball games going. That's about it.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,3,1,2,Nk__YLb5tx_lWPGys1vRgQ

This place has such good vibes! 

Let's begin with the staff. This group of people and the management were all PHENOMENAL. Everyone was so incredibly friendly. Each employee went out of their way to smile, make us feel welcome, and ask how we were doing. It wasn't just us. I watched as each table was checked on, greeted, and asked how their meal was. 
It seemed like every single person working was happy to be there. It made for a super pleasant experience. 

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A NEW FAVORITE for my family. Not only were they so kind and attentive to us, but they were super sweet to my 4 year old. I love how family friendly this spot is. 

Okay, okay! Now the  food! Everything was delicious! For you fellow yelpers out there- with a check in you get free chips and Salsa. (Which were bomb!) 
I ordered shrimp tacos with black beans and rice. I got the citrus slaw on it. YOU GUYS, IT WAS SO YUM. I devoured my tacos like I had been starved for 3 weeks. My husband got the chicken quesadilla and he was just as  pleased.  The quac that came with his dish was off the chain. Next time I go I'll be ordering a side of it for sure.  Anyways, Everything was super duper delicious. Portions are great and the price is right on point! They told us on Thursday's kids eat free and on Tuesdays you get a free taco with the purchase of a drink! Who dosnt like a deal on fresh good food? 2 more reasons to go back! 

The vibes of this place is so fun. We had such a pleasant experience we made a promise to make it a point to set regular lunch dates here. I can't wait to go back because I saw someone order a bowl or salad of some sort that looked absolutely divine. 

Again- the smiling faces of every staff member made this probably one of my most favorite lunch experiences in a long time. We will be back on a standing basis now.

I can say that a Wahoo's with a bar/gaming area is even better!

As far as the food, it's always really on point. I almost always get a salad every time. They are super fresh, full packed, and their dressings are not only delicious, but healthy as well. I love their new Kai Kale salad. They've done a great job adding the kale and masking the bitterness of it by chopping the kale into smaller pieces and mixing it in with other greens. It's such a simple idea, but no one is doing this. If you love salad, do yourself a favor and order one of theirs. Their tofu is also really really good. I don't know if it's marinated overnight or what, but it's super flavorful. 

As far as the bar service, it can be super hit or miss. We've had some amazing bartenders here, and then some that are not so good. Michael (I think that's his name...he has a New York accent) is an amazing bartender. He's helpful with his suggestions, super super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. The rest of the bartenders here could take a couple notes from this guy.

I was bummed but I decided to try the Cajun fish taco, with a beef taco just in case I didn't like the fish. The fish taco was delicious especially when it's served with the Wahoo's Green sauce. The green sauce is a sour cream base with I think Cilantro? I could be wrong but it is so good! The beef taco was tasty. You also get a choice of either white rice or brown rice with your combo. I liked the white rice because they put some type of fresh salsa on the top. It reminds me of what my mom puts on top of white rice tomatoes, onions a little fish sauce. Don't worry this topping doesn't have fish sauce in it. My combo was $6.50. It also comes with black beans or Cajun white beans but I passed on that. 
I also had the Chicken Tortilla Soup for $3.89 it was big bowl for that price. It was light , not salty and soothing after a crazy day at the airport. 

The decor reminded me of the surfer/skater kids I used to go to school with in junior high. I think the way Wahoo chose to decorate their space is much more tasteful than Chronic Tacos. There is no graffiti here just random stickers. It was also cool how the bar is glass enclosed in the middle of the restaurant.

FYI, chips and salsa are NOT complimentary nor do they come with your meal. Our cashier asked us, ""Do you want chips and salsa?"" after we ordered our meal, so we said yes. She didn't tell us we were purchasing it or how much it would cost. We didn't know she was adding it to our bill based on how it was presented to us.

I went with the Citrus Slaw Tacos with fish (these are only available a la carte) and Ruben got a Cajun Fish bowl with brown rice and black beans. The tacos were just okay. The fish did not have enough seasoning, so almost zero flavor and the slaw was a joke. There was literally one shred of carrot on one taco and the other taco had just one shred of purple cabbage. Basically, it did not satisfy my fish taco craving and made me really sad. The rice bowl wasn't any better in terms of seasoning or flavor. Even with the addition of hot sauce.

We also ordered Cajun Fries, but for some reason, when I said ""Cajun Fries,"" the cashier thought I said ""Loaded Nachos"" (this isn't even on the menu, but I guess it's offered at other Wahoo's locations and perhaps the bar area?) and charged me for it. We didn't realize what happened until the food was brought to us, so I had to go to the cashier to re-order and correct my transaction. The fries were all right with non-existent Cajun seasoning.

We wanted to eat something that may come on buns but we weren't necessarily looking to be served by a pair of buns stuck in front of our faces every now and then. Wahoo's Fish Tacos was open. Somehow the name looked familiar after coming back from a recent Pensacola baseball game. It's a fish and their mascot!

The place was quiet and only the bar was open. Since we wanted beer and food without inhaling smoke we didn't go to PT's. If you want your year's worth of smoke in your lungs, PT's (I think their name stands for Pulmonary Terriblus?) is your place.

Ordered the 3 tacos and draft beer for $10. They let you choose from a few choices of fish tacos. Beef (what'd you expect in a fish taco?) shrimp, fish, and something else. But those were the 3 I ordered. It came pretty freshly made with lettuce tomato and some green sauce I suspect is another variation of 1000 Island (what else is in diner/pub sauce, really???). It was okay. Ingredients were fresh but it wasn't tasty or anything. But I can tell you it was not greasy though. I'll have to come back some other time and see what the rest of the menu is like.

This place is awesome. I came here because my friend had a job interview at the plaza next door so as I was killing time I saw they had a 2.95 beer special. To my surprise it was Leinenkugel Lemon Shandy. Totally took me by surprise having this already, considering it's still early Spring. When you're a kick ass bar like Wahoo's, it's no wonder you've got cool beers on tap.

Shannon, this girl knows her stuff. She totally blew us away by showing us the menu. She WOW'd me with all the cool, delicious items on the menu. I only came in for a beet, like I said I was here killing time as I was waiting for my friend's interview. Shannon, well she literally won me on the tacos. She wouldn't let me leave until I tried one, and I am so glad she did!  BEST TACOS EVER. Not even joking. I ordered the spicy chicken taco, and my god. It was heaven all over my taste buds.

It's hidden in a corner off the main road that people usually do not drive by. There wasn't anyone else there eating, but there were a few people in the bar area, which was in a separate section. I liked how the decor gave off a surfer/skater vibe.

My boyfriend ordered a ""Paleo Bowl"" & I ordered a ""Loaded Quesadilla."" The salmon is good. It was very filling & not a bad price!

If there are other restaurants open, then I would go to that, but if it's late night, I might just come back!",QSMsF78PxVYiAwwwHeZ7xA,4,4,4,OJg47X4Q811Nc8w_ZZwKHQ

I was really excited to see one open right down the street from where I live - Rainbow/215.

The format is different here in Vegas. It's 24hrs and it's a gaming bar as well. I work in the industry, so I stop there about 11:30 pm (after work) for a beer and the famous fish tacos :)

They are going to have to step up their game if I'm going to keep coming, because the service is lousy and getting worse. They are distracted with no sense of urgency and no focus on serving ... Simply put, I am one of the easiest people on earth to serve, and consistently one of the MOST generous patrons where ever I go. 

No one in this town at that level seems to give a shit about serving anyone but their friends ... I'm way more generous than they are ...

We ordered two combo platters -- one fish tacos and one burrito platter to go.  Upon arriving home we discovered that there was no burrito and they gave us two taco platters instead....oh well....$1.50 price difference wasnt worth the drive back.  Tacos were tasteless, fish was dry and not seasoned, even salsa was bland.  White rice was OK, but then you have to really try to mess that up.  I dont think that i will be eating here again.

Being that I am a part-time beach bum, I love Wahoos.. In Cali.  Their healthier portions go hand in hand with fresh air, salty beach water and sand between your toes.  But to have a Wahoos in Vegas!?  In the freakin' 125 degree desert where the lifestyle is chicken wings and beer at 3 o'clock in the morn just doesn't fly.  The venue surrounds its customers with surf boards, wake boards, skate boards and snow boards.. And then I walk out and i'm still in the epicenter of bone dry desert heat.  Wahoos is just playin' tricks on me.  Also, the building is just way.. too.. big.. with a back bar included.  Vegas already has Hooter's, Friday's and every dive bar known to mankind within a miles radius to take care of our alcoholism.  My suggestion?  If you are going to serve healthy and fresh, take away the bar.  Also, shrink the place down just a tad and make it more convenient like a Subways or Chipotle and smack your piece of Real Estate next some gym or inside a food court.  I don't know..

I then politely ask him why every single one of my drinks are on my check and he rudely says ""well that's what you ordered!"" I'm sorry but any other bar you go to, if you're gambling at least ONE of those drinks are comped. I got charged for every single one of my drinks while he made me think they were comped.

if your in the mood for some fish tacos, this is a nice spot.  they don't have the fried kind (which i prefer), but the fish they do have is a good as its a mild fish taste and meaty.  the other kinds of meats, like the beef and chicken, are good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  in my opinion, they could use a little bit more kick.  this is a good option if your eating healthy as you could substitute for brown rice.  brown rice and fish = a meal to not feel guilty about.

the portions are really large and the prices are decent.  i love their white rice..its seasoned nicely. not a big fan of the white beans though.  i'll like to stick with the normal black.

I like to order the Wahoo's Salad with Grilled Fish. I will admit that sometimes the Fish had been Overcooked in the past, but seems to have been improving lately. I've also tried the Power Chopper Salad as well, but I like the Wahoo's Salad because of the Guacamole. 

Their New Citrus Slaw Taco is really delicious. But the Original Taco is still good. Again I choose the Grilled Fish. I tried the Cajun but it just wasn't a flavor I was fond of.

The Outer Reef Burrito is quite good. I've had it with the Grilled Chicken and Guacamole and Sour Cream.

The Baja-Ladas weren't too bad, I wasn't expecting them to be on the Colder side. I guess it's because of the Fresh Spinach. Maybe of it was Hot Sautéed Spinach I probably would have liked it more.

My friend gets the Tofu with his meals and I liked the Tofu very much.

Besides this location I've also eaten at the Boca Park and one near Sea World in San Diego. What was great about that location was the SD weather and eating Outdoors. It's too bad this location has no Outdoor Dining areas, but Vegas has Very Few days of the year that has nice weather, it's either Too Hot, Too Cold or Too Windy. But what I like about this location is that it's Very Close to my Work, And we get a Company Discount!

The Atmosphere is very SoCal. I Love the Skateboarding Decor, brings back memories of when I used to Skateboard and Boogieboard as a kid and spent my Summers and Spring Breaks visiting relatives in San Diego back in the 80s. They have Stickers and Posters everywhere depicting famous Skateboarding, Surfing, and Snowboarding Brands. The back walk will project Videos of Skateboarding, Surfing, etc.

I love their secret bar menu (it's not really that secret - you just have to ask for it) I used to order the burning roll each and every time I stopped by but nowadays - it's not as tasty as it used to be.

I'm sorry Andrew that he was the one who had served you.  I promise you, all the other bar tenders are amazing.  They're all very genuinely friendly!

My boyfriend and I have been going to Wahoo's for a few months.  I love the fact that it's literally across the street from us and we can walk there and back.  The bartenders that work at nights are very sweet.  (We've only been there during the day time to order food, so we haven't met the morning shift bartenders, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were just as nice.)  They do take drink AND food orders.  They actually always offer a food menu or ask if you're hungry.  AND they check up on you to make sure the Food is up to par after the food has arrived.

Most of their food is healthy and all their foods have tons of spice.  One of my favorite dishes is the Wet Burrito. I always get that with cajun/blackened chicken and I ask for them to do half red and half green sauce on top--it makes it look pretty too ;)  Their Fish Taco is a must have.  They're healthy so they won't have the McDonald's or KFC grease taste, which I know can be delicious if you like the unhealthy flavors... I can't hate cuz I crave those too time to time!  They can seem to be a bit dry, but they have the sauces to drizzle of the tacos.  The Wahoo's Fries, which is obviously not so healthy, are a must have too.  I wish other places would make their nacho's the way Wahoo's make their fries; it's totally loaded!  You can always ask for their green cilantro sauce with any of your dishes... yummmm!  

That reminds me, one time, one of the bartenders put the green cilantro sauce along the walls of the cup and poured in the drink so every sip of bloody mary had a hint of cilantro.  It was DELICIOUS!  That's another must have if you like bloody mary and cilantro!

Anyways, you gotta go and experience Wahoo's.  I'm going to be very sad when we move away from the area :(

In fact, while delivering food to another table, she seemed to avoid looking in my direction.  I eventually had to go back over to her and ask if someone was going to take care of refunding my money.  She said she would find someone.

I have LIKED the Facebook page for Wahoo's as it provoked great memories of my days hitting up Wahoo's in Costa Mesa after a day at the beach or even for a date.  The fish tacos were always the best.  So, I had posted when they were coming to Summerlin.....They replied in 2012 sometime.....Turns out I guess they had bought an existing establishment about 6 months ago off of Sunset and Rainbow.  They will be opening a new location over in the Boca Park area in March....YAY!

Anyway, went in for lunch today....I could not really figure out the menu but just asked the manager ""where are your fish tacos...?"".  Not sure if it was on the menu as I desired but he made it happen quickly.  Two fish tacos; one cajun and one mild, brown rice and black beans.  Then, a cookie and fountain drink for good measure.  I had my camera so I felt like Junior Food Reporter.  The great thing about being a volunteer Yelper, you really notice everything around you.  The bathroom was clean and the staff were friendly and the food came fast....in fact must faster than Baja Fresh.  I do not mention that to slam Baja Fresh but just a comparison.

The tacos were just as I remembered them 15+ years ago.  The brown rice was seasoned nicely and black beans are black beans.  The soda fountain had a nice variety of soda.

I can hardly wait for the Boca Park location to open and I suspect it will not have the gaming license.  I have nothing against gambling but I purposely frequent establishments that are gambling free.  This location had the bar/gambling isolated nicely but I probably will not go back unless I really feel compelled.  Thus the 4-stars versus 5-stars.

The best thing is that everything looks and tastes fresh.... While being extremely easy on your wallet.

The bar is pretty standard fare, though I've gone to Wahoos during twilight hours only, so I am ignorant to happy hour specials they run for their food and drinks, which I am sure are numerous. If you ever visit Wahoos late night, make sure you get Brian as your bartender, great, great guy.

Read that fish tacos was the main attraction, which comes in grilled or Cajun format.  It is healthier, as there are a lot of veggies, but it is dry and relatively bland in taste.

The enchilada (also ordered with Cajun fish) is better, mostly attributed to the homemade spicy verde sauce.

The Wahoo's Salad looks great and the portion is large. Sadly, looking good is not the same as tasting good.

Anyway, glad I came and gave it a try but I have no urge to return for an encore.

Parking: 5/5. Plenty of spaces.

Food:  2/5.  Costco's frozen section probably has better tacos.

Price:  3/5.  $2.55 for a soft taco or enchilada is not bad, but better spent at a local taco stand.

Service:  4/5.  Friendly, especially towards the ladies. 

Food is the main reason for going to restaurants, so Wahoo's may scored high in other attributes, but it was not good enough to earn a repeat visit or recommendation.  Sorry.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,2,gTt7BrflBrgmZudK35kI6A

5934541,2012-06-04,3,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"It's been awhile Yelp. I haven't written a review for ages, but I was so compelled to write a review following my recent visit to the newly opened Wahoo's in town. 

Now, I've been to the original Wahoos franchise in San Diego for the first time last year and had an excellent experience. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. Before I dive into the service aspect about this particular Vegas location, I'll touch on the food a bit. Simply put, nowhere near the same. The quality of the food is average at best and the prices are a bit higher. The first time I went I was excited, a bit disappointing, but I was willing to go there again if I happened to be in the area. And so this particular night, I was.

First and foremost, I'd like to consider myself a pretty patient and tolerable person. If a server takes awhile to refill drinks and/or doesn't seem to be ""trying"" to cater to my very modest needs, I almost always shrug it off. But this particular night I was left beyond speechless. 

Me and a group of 5 or 6 walked into Wahoos looking to simply grab a bite to eat after a long night of drinking. The place was relatively empty, there was maybe one or two other people there. Right upon entering, a friend of mine immediately greeted the bartender with ""How are ya tonight sir?"". The bartender responded with ""Don't call me sir"" without a smile. We shrugged it off, sat down, an ordered promptly. Since most of us were only looking to eat, we asked if we could put in our food orders. He literally rejected our request and sternly stated that he would only take drink orders, and aggressively and rudely tried to convince each and every one of us to drink. 

After finally accepting our food orders, it took 10 minutes to get water. Another 5 to receive drinks. Most of our friends never even got theirs. When we asked about them, he spoke to us in a dumbfounded, i can do no wrong manner. 

The wait for our food to arrive was average, and I was understanding because it was past 3AM and they probably only had one cook. But I reasoned that it was slow, and most of us had simply ordered taco plates. But then the food started trickling out of the kitchen one by one, each dish coming out 5 minutes apart. Not only did he forget who had what., but every single order was painfully incorrect. Every. Single. Order. We had simple, unmodified orders. Watching your friends eat one by one is extremely unacceptable. I've been in the foodservice industry, it's an industry standard to send food out together. One of my friends, the last to have not received his food, inquired about the status of his order. The bartender asked what he had ordered, smiled and said it was coming soon. We then watched him walk over and punch in my friends order, 45 minutes after he had initially ordered it, 

After that we all had enough and a few of my friends walked out the door. I have NEVER in my life have walked out on a tab, but when we started complaining he at least agreed to comp our bill, even though I told him I had no problem paying , because I knew I was never coming back. But while we were trying to figure out why everything went so wrong, he simply shrugged.

I usually love to write reviews because I love spreading the word about great businesses and good eats, but this was the first time I came here, compelled to keep other people away from this place.

5938287,2012-12-09,0,ibFdignja_hNpgCjDYP7Ug,"Doing an edit on my original review since I hear the server I had a complaint with was finally fired in the last couple of months so now I'm alright with calling her out by name.  Had two messed up customer service experiences late 2012 with their bartender, Candi.  I've seen at least a couple other regulars complain about her on here and I fully agree with their remarks about her having issues with drinking on the job, blowing off customers to flirt with one guy and just having a bad attitude in general.  In addition to that, last time I saw her in Nov she made some completely off-the-wall accusations about me which things like security footage and looking at our phone/ text history would've easily disproved.  I was a regular of hers for a year, from before Wahoo's, and she completely turned on me when I tried to talk to her about the drinking and ignoring customers problem!

After our last encounter, I brought this issue to management's attention and never received a response, an acknowledgement that my letter had been received (couldn't seem to find a manager in person at this store), NOTHING.  I've attempted contact with managers, owners, the corporate office and filed with the BBB.  These people have completely ignored me!  Not exactly customer-friendly service, is it??  I don't know if they were cutting her a break for being hot or if she was sleeping with someone in charge but it's completely unprofessional and unacceptable that they didn't take my, or others, complaints about her seriously.  I hear the reason she got fired didn't even have anything to do with her issues on the job!  I also heard from a buddy of mine in the service industry that they transferred her to the Boca Park location a couple of times, at least once because of her inability to do her job well while working the Sunset Sunday night shift unsupervised.  Really don't understand how she kept her job so long while other employees got fired for stupid, far less serious things.

Bottom line, if you have a complaint these people will NOT hear you out or do anything about it.  They just don't care about the customers so, in my opinion, they shouldn't have any.  If you've ever had an issue with Candi or any other servers please have enough respect for yourself to just walk away and take your business elsewhere.

You order at the register and then they deliver the food to your table. The menu is extensive, verging on too many options.

My friends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth. 

The food took a bit of time to come out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before  our friends. Once we all had our meals, we dug in.

The fish was a little dry and the tofu, although nice was bland. The food was plentiful but I only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster.
