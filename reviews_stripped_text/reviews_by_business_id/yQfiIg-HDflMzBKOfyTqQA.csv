the oldest on the Strip. Unlike the Stardust however this place shows
its age. Room we had was pretty decrepit. Broken furniture,stale cig
odor even though supposed to be a n/s room. Location is not ideal.
Why stay here? One reason would be if you're going to party all night
at Gilley's (which we did one night--enjoyed the bikini bull riding). 
Another reason might be the huge pool,one of the largest I've ever
seen. Besides that this place has nothing going for it. It was slated
for the wrecking ball years ago,why is it still standing? Strange.",iw_6JAAw9FAIv2YkbLcMFA,0,0,2,D0E-lGF7zXUJjFJEgUePsQ

It's definitely not worth that much. The atrium suites are decently clean but nothing fancy. I was just glad to have a place to stay! The pool looked nice but it was too cold to go swimming. The sign out front said there was mud wrestling, but I didn't get to see it.",Ui0A8-hrpEPuEUG8EGBNaw,0,0,3,FfF0fnkXAlUk5M_yNSLxnw

Yes, high end Vegas is a lot of fun. But, I really had a soft spot in my heart for this truly old-school place.

I was first schooled on this place in 2002 by an old co-worker (thanks, Whipps) who dragged a bunch of us out for a round of rides on the mechanical bull - after which I had sore groin muscles for literally six days from the 25 seconds of leg clenching for dear life.

Last year, I had the distinct pleasure of spending a festive evening with friends (also on a business trip) in an effort to escape the corporate drudgery of the casinos and clubs up the strip. Our Tuesday evening went something like this: chicken strips, Jack Daniels, bull rides, fried mozzarella sticks, Miller Genuine Draft, potato skins, wagering on the mud wrestling, more beer.  You get the picture. 

And, I can't help but mention one of the coolest gambling contraptions in the entire state of Nevada... the mechanical horse-races. Man, I hope that thing was spared. Please let me know if anyone spots that awesome machine.  Good times.

God speed, New Frontier.",eydaYzZbJ-2cLcEDA5d5hQ,8,9,5,9kVTHiT9pBq7UvIp68t-4Q

I heard all the casinos raised their dining price, so we didn;t look around at all. lesson learnt, no buying unpopular buffet.",df3ep3RA5xoKUdHIWizdVw,1,0,2,JWxLfuEA7c2EwYFAHp1jag
2335907,2005-07-22,1,yQfiIg-HDflMzBKOfyTqQA,"OK, so I'm a sucker for the Old Vegas style.  The New Frontier has great room specials and sometimes you can get a HUGE suite for the same price as a room somewhere else.  (I'm serious -- it was bigger than my apartment in SF!)  They have $1 frozen margaritas downstairs and the biggest country bar in Vegas, complete with two-steppin' cowboys and their ladies.  It's hard to find food after midnight, but that's not why you're there...  http://www.frontierlv.com/",B0QGBVCUm54vs_waVzcScA,1,3,4,NBdzPjWUgebZOHP4cVTFlA
2507112,2007-04-18,1,yQfiIg-HDflMzBKOfyTqQA,"For those of us who are tired of hearing about the newest mega resorts and table service and Cirque shows, the Frontier is a nice change.  It's definitely a taste of what it used to be like here before the moving statues and dancing fountains.  It used to be about gaming and booze, and both are prevalent here.  The casino boasts a big center bar with poker machines so old they only take quarters.  There's a decent sized sports book and some restaurants and counter eateries scattered about. 

The one time I stayed here, we got a 'suite' for $40.  The room was HUGE with a full bar, but the only bed lived in the sofa.  Anyway, after a night of doing it up downtown style it didn't matter WHERE we slept just as long as we did.

It's not fancy, but the bang you get for your buck definitely makes this place worthwhile.  Plus, it's at the north end of the Strip making it easy to get downtown. 

Rumours of demolition abound.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,4,rjUc9pB4YVgFWYNKwcoLdA

I was starving and just could not drive anymore so I went in it really was not to bad for 12.95 pp it was an Italian dinner buffett...

Some of the Pasta's were okay ..the prime rib was good..All you can eat shrimp (tasted fresh)

its on the strip right across from the wynn hotel and right next door to the fashion show mall.  its not a tourist trap [no crowds, no mile hike to get through the casino to your room] and we get a great deal on the HUGE atrium suites.  the pool is also about 12 feet deep and thats unheard of nowadays!

5578741,2006-06-19,3,yQfiIg-HDflMzBKOfyTqQA,"The New Frontier place is kinda divey. I dont know how it got the ""New"" part in the name, as its obviously old, and there's been no maintenance on the place for about 30 years. The carpets smell musty. 

This place reminds me of the one in The Shining. You'll have to walk for about ten minutes to get to your room. The multi coloured red carpet, and fake wooden finishing spell fancy for the 70s.

After a while, the old style gaming area grows on you, and once you accept it, this place is cool and Vegas all over.

Driving in, we know we're close when we see a large hotel wrapped by a roller coaster. Paddy says, ""you ain't seen nothin yet"". When we do arrive, we still haven't seen anything yet, when we get lost in what turns out to be a hotel carpark.

Vegas deserves it's reputation, and is huge fun. On the first night, Riet and Chap get tickets to Celine Dion in the hope of seeing plenty of tackiness and kitch. Celine delivers in her new show titled ""A new day"". Chap went along just to keep Riet company, but comes back singing ""I drove all niiiiight to get to you"", and even bought her CD.",1p4wP0QzgdWXWYnRSR7MBw,0,0,3,mCs3HEQsrZDPUFP0SClo0g

I did not stay here, but only visited. I'm seriously thinking it would be a good place to stay though, the location is good, and it doesn't appear to be outrageously priced.
