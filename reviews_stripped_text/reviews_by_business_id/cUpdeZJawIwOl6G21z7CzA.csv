While other pizza joints from Chicago are good, Giordano's goes above and beyond to make it taste like back home.... just ask them how they treat the water to ensure you're getting the true Chicago flavor. 
The place is brand new so I left 4 stars because I'm sure they will tweak their processes for a completely smooth dining experience. The staff was great, the bar tenders were accommodating and of course the pie was divine. Make a point to stop by and check it out!!!",ubM9XlhrDxsAg4WIOTnsXg,0,0,4,6dWxZ5tW4gcQzR04UJOsDQ

Pizza is amazing of course but our calamari appetizer was really tasty and a good-sized portion too. Try the chopped salad--really fresh and the perfect complement to the deep dish pizza.

Its nicely done in the bar and restaurant. Cool vibe and imported  large (probably 25 oz) beers are only $8! Also a nice wine selection-- my gf had the Mark West Pinot-- a deal at $9  

General Manager Evan (super nice guy) came by and mentioned the happy hour with half price beer and wine and appetizer deals. Sounds like a plan--be back soon",692pgQeZNGPuUyCxV6jX-Q,1,1,5,D4vlWK1hJl5yWlxlX3Q1mQ

Then comes the tight seating that is extremely uncomfortable. Make sure to ask for a booth if you can. Don't even bother going for the classic deep dish pizza it's nearly 90% cheese, takes around an hour to reach your table and  definitely is not anywhere worth the prices they ask, the crust is nothing special and because of so much cheese it's insanely greasy. The waiters don't ask before taking things from the table. If you plan on getting a refill of your drink plan on waiting as long as you did for the pizza. Spend your money on something better, cheaper, and something that will not take up your entire night out.",alRCNSbBLi4CfMrsXPTTKA,0,0,1,9uaqEBZiFkNvTQ6RWjqQCg

Our waitress was CJ and she was awesome! Sweet, funny and on top of it. 

A girl at the front who was a hostess was terrible. She gets a negative star. Autumn was her name. Rude and not just to us. Others complained about her too.

2 Chicagoans living in the desert realize there's a Giordano's just 3 Miles from the House. Sheer excitement ensued! We decided to order in and I decided on carryout in case delivery would lead to colder/soggier food. So we called in and the person taking the order was very nice but clearly in training. Picked up the order, which was ready when we got there. 

Second I get home all my eyes focus on is the hair on top of the dressing locked inside the container with the salad. (See pictures.) I called and spoke with the manager who was very nice and immediately offered a $30 credit. More than generous for just the salad.

Chopped salad was obviously inedible. Fried calamari was only okay. It included banana peppers, artichokes and fennel. 

I ordered half plain/half sausage pizza. (Chicagoans note, it's not a sheet it's crumbles.)  Got home to realize it was all sausage. Ended up being ok, my husband ate it anyway, just another hiccup of a new restaurant. This as well was okay. Not the taste of home I was hoping for. Rookie mistake, I forgot to get it uncut so by the time we got home it was a bit soggy, but again that was my fault. Came with 2 containers that had half ranch/half I'm assuming was blue cheese. Crust was somewhat tasteless, the sauce and sausage compensated for it. 

Will probably return, hoping for better results.",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,0,0,3,Ch-Uj_HjpOcGuj0BB7gVPw

We came in with our 3 month old son and we asked for a sling. The hostess didn't even know what a sling was. So, we get seated in a booth and my son couldn't fit into the booth between my husband and I. We changed tables THREE times before they finally figured out that if they rotated the table, we could fit a fifth seat and put him in the chair next to us. Next, we ordered our appetizer since it takes 45 minutes for their deep dish pizza. The appetizer came out barely warm and bearable. The pizza was horrible. The crust tasted premade and the sauce had zero flavor. The best part of our experience here was the waitress. I can't remember her name, but she was beyond amazing and so sweet. Being from Chicago, I had high standards for our first experience here. I'll take the location at the Strip over the ""local"" location.

The caveat is that it takes about 45 minutes to prepare it. With four of the sharing, we decided to go for the large. We ordered a Caesar salad to help us pass the 45 minutes. Caesar was incredibly fresh and dressing was delicious. 45 minutes later the pizza arrived and it was amazing. It's a deep dish pizza with the cheese underneath the sauce.

I was able to avert my eyes and steer clear of Giordano's for months, until I received a gift card for my birthday. Who was I to say no to the pizza gods? 

I didn't feel like sitting and dining in (I needed privacy for my gluttony), so I placed an order online for pickup. I decided to build my own, with sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms. I appreciated the option to pay when I picked it up as well. 

My pizza wasn't quite ready when I arrived; there was about an 8 min wait, but I didn't mind too much. It just built the anticipation. 

I got it home, and it was everything I remembered. I didn't eat it alone, I did share it (reluctantly). A medium was definitely big enough for two people, with enough leftover for the next day. And the pizza.. sauce- robust. Cheesy. Meaty. Deep. The dough was soft without being soggy. It was amazing.

So for approximately $30, no, it's not going to be an every day (or every week) treat, but damn, when you're ready for an out of body pizza experience, this is the place to go.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,5,2,5,VqxPgfHGfqt8lFyP6RhcaA

Then he spilled our garlic fries on the table after they had finally arrived on the table so we had lost some from our order. He never offered to get us more just said they had over filled them more than usual.

Then he said they had no WiFi. 
We then asked someone and figured out they do have free WiFi and he had said well the manager informed him incorrectly then.

No... just because you put ingredients into a deep dish pan doesn't make it a deep dish pizza this was the THINEST crust pizza I've ever had topped with sauce and a tiny bit of meat leaving the hardest 1 inch leftover crust I've ever seen ... so disappointed after spending 40$ on a pizza I didn't want to eat. I was so excited to try this out as it is new to Vegas and I LOVE Chicago style deep dish pizza... I am even more disappointed because I  thought I'd try the cannolis, once again the worst I've ever had ... it was grainy cheap cheese and flavorless ... I'm so disappointed... the wait staff was fine the only people I put blame upon is the ordering staff/ownership/franchising for being either clueless, cheap, or both.",W8rctDlGRr4QZNgzX12KQw,0,0,1,6FsJ53hqJnbxL_Vz1nkLrw

My husband and I tried to order online for the 10% discount but the website kept freezing so we called in the order.  We were told 45 minutes.  We showed up a little early (40 minutes, not 45) and were told it would be about 10 more minutes.  When we paid we told the manager about the problem with the online ordering and showed him the frozen website page and he went ahead and gave us the 10% discount - nice guy - good business on a $58.00 check. We sat in the bar and watched the Vegas Golden Knights Game.  30 minutes! later we had to ask about our order and no one seemed to know the status.  10 minutes later we were told our pizzas were being boxed.  When we got home the special thin crust pizza looked like someone had dumped all the ingredients in a pile in the middle and barely baked it; the meat and more meat pizza was pretty good.  For the price (even with the 10% off) and the wait time, the food was just OK.

2447171,2018-03-15,0,cUpdeZJawIwOl6G21z7CzA,"For a newly opened location I was extremely surprised how understaffed they were. We arrived at 7pm and the dining room had about 15 tables open and there was a 15min wait. There were 4 other parties in front of us. We were finally seated after 25min. Another couple walked in and asked why the long wait. The host responded with ""they only staffed 3 servers and I'm the host and also the only busperson on duty"". For a new location I was absolutely amazed with the staffing issue. As I'm sitting waiting for our pizza there are only 14 (out of approx 40) tables currently being occupied and still people waiting to be seated. People who dine out expect to be greeted and seated asap and immediately if there are tables open. I mean, isn't that the point in having a large restaurant area with many tables? How are you supposed to make money if you aren't filling your seats? 

Tonight, incompetent managing and staffing made people, including myself, stand and wait to be seated when there were several table open to accommodate a busy restaurant. What a joke and completely unacceptable. I love Giordano's pizza but unfortunately I doubt this place will last given the extremely poor and incompetent management. 

I posted before I got my pizza because I was bored so here is my edit.....The pizza was not hot. I would not say cold but definitely not hot. The crust was also not like the usual.

If corporate wants this location to last they better step in and take over. Great service gets repeat business. Bad service loses customers. I won't be back until I see a sign that says ""under new management.""",ixNjkbbcbJNEBhYvQagCGQ,3,0,1,UYgJ-omW5SlJ6vOoiKwBsg
2465418,2018-01-07,0,cUpdeZJawIwOl6G21z7CzA,"I've been waiting to try this place because usually when a place is new it has to work out the kinks. I'm very familiar with Giordanos because I eat there or take their frozen pizza home from Chicago every time I go. (I even gave them as Christmas gifts one year, which everyone loved.)
I'm home sick, and really wanted some pizza so I decided to give Postmates a try and even though it was 9:30pm and this pizza takes a good 45 minutes to cook, I went for it. It arrived at my door in about an hour and 10 minutes later. Not cold but the perfect temperature. The large, deep dish cheese must weigh about 5 lbs. 
And let me tell you it was all that. As delicious as it is when you order it in Chicago, it was in my living room. It wasn't cheap, but totally worth it. I highly recommend Giordanos. It's the best pizza there is. I even eat the crust, it's so delicious. And I never eat the crust.

From there it was an hour wait to get our appetizer (Bruschetta) and another 45 minutes after that to get our food (Spaghetti and the Toasted Italiano sandwich).

The food was pretty flavor-less and definitely not worth the near 2 and a half hour experience in the restaurant. The waiters and servers took their time and worked slower than they should have with how busy it was. People were leaving due to long waits.

Everyone was cool coming in, but things got a little awkward when I asked for a clean glass for my Pepsi because the first glass was dirty. After that, I was pretty much invisible as the manager and the server happily conversed with EVERY surrounding table except for mine. Pizza was wonderful as I expect Giordanos to be, but the only contact I had with the manager is when he rudely slammed my glass down on the table, and the only contact with my server was when he brought my food and drinks and brought the check, which by the way was put to the side to get another tables order and drinks. Two questions were asked (only because it was part of the job) and I don't spend money to be ignored and to feel invisible. I asked for the check and was expected to be asked to stick around for dessert, but I was met with my server Daniel shoving my pizza in a tiny box that left the cheese and toppings EVERYWHERE! They should have interacted with our party as they interacted with every party.  Chicago would NEVER treat their guests in this manner. Maybe Giordanos Las Vegas should take notes. Or maybe Applebees should have stuck around. They knew how to treat every guest as equal. Great Pizza, non existent service.",zUlUmBP1W_X8etasqHoxQA,0,0,2,1FzTSAi4j7H2VcvYWox0ug

I tried ""the best bruschetta"" and it was definitely not the best. Watery tomato's, not enough basil. Wouldn't recommend. The lunch specials are awesome. The service is a bit slow as far as getting bar drinks and drink now refilled. It's fun to watch the guys in the kitchen tossing the dough back and fourth. Love that they serve 312 beer. Definitely a Chicago place with a Chicago vibe. I feel like they could do more with the menu though.

The service was definitely less than meh.  After waiting almost 5 minutes to be greeted, we decided to go ahead and place our full order. Water, iced tea, two side salads and a pizza. Some 7 or 8 minutes later our server is politely engaging a large table next to us and packing up their leftovers, while we are now pushing 13 minutes since sitting down and still don't have a beverage. (Water!  I'm dying here!)

Our salads show up, still no drinks.  The runner is so polite though when I ask him to send our server over. He offers to bring them for us, but eventually the server shows up with them. The salads - one Caesar and one Greek - are tasty.  The Greek is over dressed, and both salads the lettuce is so overly shopped that you can't stab it, you have to kinda ""scoop"" it up. 

Our server (and 4 or 5 others) walked by our empty salad plates and empty drink cups multiple times - no one seemed to care or notice. Eventually I stopped our server and asked for a refill. He said ok and left the dirty plates.  After a few minutes he returned with iced tea for my friend but not my club soda?  Hmmm.  He said he'd be back but then went to greet and take orders at two more tables. While he was at there one of the Opening Team Managers / Trainers came by and removed the salad plates and offered to refill my beverage.  I'm afraid to drink it though - not sure I'd get another and might need it for my hot pizza. 

Ordered deep dish pepperoni & sausage. A Chicago classic.  The pizza had a beautiful crunchy crust and was tasty. I love the Chicago-style deep dish with that cracker crisp outer edge that isn't greasy or oily like other deep dish pizza.  The sauce on top ensures that the more than ample dose of oh so yummy ooey-gooey cheese is melted.  When the pizza was delivered I asked for a refill - just in case. My friend thought That was ""not nice"" only to realize half way through his second slice he could go no further without a little beverage to wash it down.  Eventually a manager came by and he asked for a refill.

A few general notes:  I've been working in restaurants for over 20 years, and been a server at a new opening no less than 4 times. Even as an experienced server, management always kept the table count low to set a good tone and work out kinks. Our server was juggling a 10 too plus 5 other tables.  It's easy to mad at the server for bad service - but I lay this right at the feet of the manager.  No server should be juggling this many tables in a restaurant this new. 

Other server have some kind of gross habits. One in particular walked by with flat pizza boxes under his armpit. That same box is going to be folded at the table and have someone's leftovers put inside. Just think about that for a second.  If you've never been a server, I can share that we sweat. Kitchens are warm, and you're just shy of jogging for a lot of your shift.  I'll take my pizza to go sans sweat, please. 

So, will I be back?  Yes, and I fully expect to revise my rating upwards.  In the meantime, I have to give an honest opinion of today's meal and Giordano's earned this two star review.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,1,0,2,oqd7nLhG1yh1Z6zuFZvZrg

The size was about the size of a small sub at Subway without all the good fillings. Just a little bit of beef with a little cheese on a soft but somewhat toasted bun.

We had to ask for napkins, silverware, and crushed peppers. We ordered: house salad, personal pepperoni pizzas, and I ordered garlic bread sticks. House salad was just ok. Pizza had zero flavor and was overcooked which made it dry and the cheese and pepperoni slid off the crust with each bite. I feel the pizza had no life to it at all. My garlic bread sticks came out long after our pizzas did. The sticks tasted like the ones my mother in-law buys at the store and tries to give us at family functions. No thanks. My bill came out to 18$. I took the pizza and bread sticks to go, but ended up throwing it away because I did not want to relive that meal.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,6,1,1,tlkAk1wUvQiGhBKnVQIPuw

excellent deep dish pizza, great sauce

Giordano salad exc but over priced at $16 for a large

The Bad
very noisy (Fri evening)
lighting too bright

We came into Giordano's during a lunch rush. It was pretty packed. Walking in we were greeted almost immediately, we requested a booth and got seated in a single style booth that was perfect for two. 
For our first time we decided to try the Chicago Classic Deep Dish it has pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper & onions with extra pepperoni and a Caesar Salad. We heard about Giordano's when we went to Chicago Illinois last year and didn't get the chance to try it, we were super surprised to find out that this was the same place. That being said when the waitress told us there would be a 45 minute wait for the world famous stuffed deep dish, we didn't mind one bit. 
While we waited our server Tenikia brought us our salad and made sure our drinks were never empty. Even though this place was packed I would have to say the service was amazing. Other servers would stop by our table and make sure everything was ok. 
When our pizza was ready the manager served our first slice. I took a video of the cheese pull off the first slice... impressive!!! 
I can't even begin to express how much I loved this pizza. Definitely is different most deep dishes are greasy served in a pan, this one is more like a pie with the sauce being on top. So good! 
Five star customer service. The number one thing that made an excellent experience was having the manager stopping by your table to see how everything was and even serving your first slice.

If the service was remotely decent it would get more stars.  Our server seemed inexperienced, which is ok, but he had way more table than he could handle.  It took 20 minutes just to get our order in and we had to flag him down just to do that.  He was constantly flagged down by every table because we all needed something. Bar drinks took about 15 minutes. Later on I ordered a 2nd drink which I never got.  One persons food in our group didn't come out until the rest of us were finished eating.  I ordered a side of ranch for my crust, never got that, and was never even able to flag someone down to ask.  Other servers walked by and looked at us and ignored our attempts to get help.  The manager (man in a button up shirt with a beard) walked by us numerous times and just looked at us and kept walking. Then we saw him just standing around while I was trying to flag someone down for refills, red pepper flakes, and ranch. I was more than half way through my pizza before I could even get crushed red pepper for it.  The manager should be helping his tables and these servers need to be trained how to provide proper service to people. Working in restaurants for almost ten years I felt bad for the kid serving us.  Surrounding table were all unhappy.  Good food ruined by terrible service that appears to be from bad management and lack of training.

Next we ordered a thin crust pizza and received a deep dish version. Because of the mistake the  deep dish was comp'd and our server reordered the thin crust.

We ordered the small which comes 6 slices and can feed 2 people with leftover lunch.  We added olives, jalapeno, mushroom, and chicken sausage.  Sausage came inside the pizza rather than as a topping which is eery interesting and tasty, as each bite you get full globs of cheese and the bit of the sausage.  Jalapenos were quite spicy and made for a heaty bite each time as their toppings are very generous.  Takeout was simple and ready in 45 minutes, with a 10% online ordering discount through Yelp which makes the price reasonable.

I used to drive for Uber/Lyft and I had heard so many comments from passengers about Giordanos on Las Vegas Strip, so I had to check it out.  We heard this location had just opened on Charleston Blvd so it was worth checking out and avoiding the craziness on the strip.

OMG is all I can say.  Our waitress Lilly recommended that we have the cheesy garlic bread to start and for myself personally a ""small"" deep dish Pepperoni pizza.  Well small is a understatement, this pie was huge.  I am a big eater but I could only finish half.  It was excellent all the way around and even tasted great the next couple days finishing it at home.
My friend had the Lasagna and said it was really great too.   I have to thank Lilly for her outstanding service and making us feel at home throughout the meal.

Unfortunately, the two times I've tried this location they've screwed up my order. The first time was right after they opened the location. I ordered online and when I showed up to pick up my pizza they claim they never got the order and if they had I would have gotten an email. I showed them the confirmation email and they said it was probably an error with they're new system. They took my order again and tried to get me to repay for the original order that I already paid for. Once this was sorted out I left and came back to finally get my pizza 2 hours after the original order. I had also ordered and paid for two sides of marinara that I realized weren't included when I got home. 
The second screw up was yesterday. It was a simple mixup but made my pizza almost inedible. I ordered giardineira and I'm assuming the cook thought the abbreviation on the ticket meant garlic because there was no giardineira and lots of nearly raw garlic. I'm a big fan of garlic but it being raw made the pizza taste pretty bad. At nearly $40 for a small pizza (including delivery fee and tip) that's unacceptable.

I ordered a pizza at 5:15 for 6:20 delivery. It's currently 7:20 and I just received my pizza. They gave me a call saying they'd be a few minutes late at around 6:15, but an entire hour is much longer than ""a few minutes"". By the time they got to me, the pizza was already cold. The cheese was no longer gooey and the crust was stuck to the bottom of the box. The delivery guy thanked me for my patience, but didn't offer any other apology.

I've ordered takeout from giordano's before, and I like their pizza. Next time if I want it, I'll just dine in at the other location on the strip. They have much better customer service. If you're looking for delivery, you're better off with Domino's. Domino's has never taken longer than two hours to deliver a pizza, and a cold giordano's is not worth the wait.",iY7qj_LPKnsDNrCgdzKS1Q,2,2,1,Icoaavblkf4yzXRWlcOlxQ

I wish I had taken a picture of every staff member in the kitchen when we first got here and the line at the front of people waiting to check in and no one there. Listening to all the comments of how long they've been waiting and that they should leave and not come back. I give this place 6 months at best.

They literally just cleaned a table from a larger party that has been dirty and empty since we got here. 59 minutes ago.

It took 30 minutes just to get an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.

Meanwhile, the 3 managers are walking around aimlessly or talking to each other in the corner.

We even pre-ordered our pizza while we were waiting to be seated.... 58 minutes ago.

And my piece of lard waitress is rude as hell. I can't give you her name because she isn't wearing a name tag.

Oh wait.. The pizza is cold and the crust is soggy. They didn't serve it to show off the cheesy meltiness that they promised... It's freaking cold.

When I confronted my waitress, she denied it. They took care of the bill. Which is their only saving grace. I should have walked out a long time ago.

Clue number one.. No hostess to greet you.

I know better.

I will never eat here again. Maybe take the pizza home with their takeout and cook it at home myself. Maybe it will be hot then.",CZMuoERVFDYKprdG5TCz9g,2,0,1,ePB3r65n1Vrfck7HDBr0aQ

The crust while deep dish is very thin and very crunchy. It breaks into pieces when you try to cut it.  It's nearly impossible to cut near the edge of the crust.  We asked a manager for steak knives they said they didn't have any but suggested since it was toward the end we could pick it up with our hands. Thanks for the pizza consumption lesson. There seemed to be very little pepperoni I might as well have gotten plain cheese for the difference it made.  And the sauce, if I got light sauce I can't imagine what regular sauce is.  I scraped a majority of it off. It's also EXTREMELY ROBUST. The service seemed unnecessarily slow. We had a party of 7. We went ahead and ordered when we had 5 people present as to not hold up the table. The first pizza to arrive was mine 1 of 3 completely different pizzas and the server couldn't tell or didn't know which one it was.  I had eaten an entire slice before the other two pizzas came out which also came out at different times from each other. The pizzas take about 45 minutes to make so this is not a quick in and out evening.  I can't imagine how long you'd stay there if they mess up your pizza.

We have a friend with Celiac and thought we'd investigate.  I mention this first as we were advised that it's a glutten-free crust but it has interaction with flour, etc - so not a good choice for folks with Celiac.  So, we ditched our friend! HaHa! It was pure coincidence.  Oh yeah, bring your big wallet because if you're used to pizza hut pricing, you're going to go into shock here.  

I beat my wife to the place and was warned about the 45 minute waiting time for the deep dish pizzas but was told they were worth it and that's why they were ""World Famous!""  So, I said sure and ordered the Chicago and off he went.  

When my wife arrived 10 minutes later, she ordered a pizza that had pesto and feta on it and a thinner crust.  We also ordered garlic parm fries as an appetizer (fantastic by the way). My Chicago was still cooking when my wife's pizza arrived (and I tasted it - super good). My wife finished eating her whole dinner and we were on an 1 hr and 10 minutes and my Chicago still hadn't arrived (I'm not dinging the review for this because I know it was a glitch from freshly opening this location days ago and the crowd was huge).

Now, finally, my Chicago had arrived and It looked tasty but.....meh.  It was good, but talk about the anticipation waiting (even if 45 minutes) and expecting ""World Famous"" - well, I wasn't thrilled.  The wallet stung a lot more than I thought it would at this point because a small was $20+.  I didn't realize it at first, but I have had similar pizza at Metro that is stuffed.

Overall, we had two out of three things that were great!  The ""A-OK"" is for the ""World Famous"" which may really should be ""Neighborhood Famous"" and the price I paid vs. the goodness.

Famous for their deep dish is what attracted us to dine in. We will however order takeout instead of step foot inside again. The deep dish takes 45min to make. The service is so poor and I'm not sure if it's because they don't care or if they are seriously under staffed. 

We stood at the front for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged by who I assume was the manager in a blue shirt but no name tag. He came from the kitchen and retreated back there our entire meal. Several other customers experienced the same greeting. Our waiter was not friendly. He seemed annoyed when we questioned 45 minutes for a deep dish.

4531390,2018-02-17,0,cUpdeZJawIwOl6G21z7CzA,"Best Chicago deep dish pizza where you don't have to go to Chicago to enjoy! I've been to one of the locations in Downtown Chicago a couple of years ago and was impressed. I've been to Chicago Brewing Company in Vegas and their Windy City Supreme deep dish was pretty good, but Giordano's classic deep dish wins hands down on taste of their buttery crust, how soft and crisp heir bread is, the cheese is beautiful as is stretches and tastes superb, their vegetables (especially the tomatoes) seem to be of great quality as they taste super fresh! Even the Parmesan cheese in the shaker looked fresh and was good.

FREE APPETIZER: I suggest signing up for their free program on their website if is your first time heading there or if you haven't already so that you can be emailed a free appetizer (choices are cheesy bread or bruschetta) on your visit. I used it to get the bruschetta which was 4 big pieces. One of the best bruschetta I've had. I'm not for the super crisp bread so this was amazing as it was somewhat soft to bite into with a crisp outside.

WAIT TIME: Took my boyfriend here for Valentine's Day. The wait to be seated was 20-minutes so we ended up sitting at the bar since there was room. Plus, there were TVs where he could catch up with sports games while we enjoyed our dinner. The medium deep dish took 45-minutes and they let us know that, but not sure if it was because it was busy and Valentine's Day or if because of the size and it is a deep dish that it actually takes that long to make and bake. Either way, I didn't mind the wait because I knew that it was going to worth the wait and I had bruschetta, beer, company, chatter with the bartender and sports to keep me busy.

BEER TIP: I recommended getting a pitcher for $13-17 rather than a glass or two for yourself which is $6-7 for a pint. The beer pitchers are a good size unlike other bars in Vegas with their small pitchers.

Will definitely be back again soon! Oh and the customer service at the bar with the rotating 2 bartenders was great for a busy night.

DEEP DISH TIP:  the bartender said that if you order a deep dish and get one topping, then it will be very cheesy and when you take a slice it, the cheese runs pretty high to the ceiling.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,1,0,5,UPrFhTSZ66IahcvMFIf9UQ

We made sure to order our pizzas right away since it does take about 45 minutes to bake. We also ordered a couple apps to hold us over. I felt like the apps took a bit longer than expected to come out, but once they arrived they tasted delicious. The calamari was perfectly crisp. I also enjoyed the garlic bread and cheese triangles in the sampler. When our pizza finally got to us we dug in immediately. They were both cooked perfectly and the toppings were evenly spread.

So automatic 1-Star for being off the strip and in a local area! We walked in around 4:00 PM on a Saturday, and it was not too crowded. We approached the host stand and it took about 5 minutes to get seated because the hostess was talking to a server about where to seat us even though there weren't many tables to chose from. It was a little disorganized and irritating to be standing there while they went back and forth about where to seat us. 

Once we got seated, our server introduced herself and told us about the process to get our pizza out. We ordered drinks and decided on what to order. Each pizza does take 30-40 minutes to cook so ordering apps is super helpful especially when you're starving! Lol 

The food was amazing! Just make sure you can handle the wait for that cheesy gooey yummy pizza! The only down side is the wait time but it's well worth it!! 

As far as service, our server was helpful and checked on us a few times but I noticed their turnover process was poor. A table near us had left and it took over 15 minutes to clear the table and reset it. Yes I noticed 15 minutes because I was counting down the minutes to get this pizza in my belly!! I saw many servers walk by the table, look at it and just walk pass. They weren't busy so it was just irritating seeing a dirty table next to us.

Service was just a little bit slow. Granted, the location and staff were new and everyone may still be getting into the hang of things. But, if you've been in the service industry for a number of years and have had the proper training, then you're expected to be a little more refined and a step quicker. 

Still, the wife and I will probably give this location a few more tries until one is opened up in our neck of the woods (Aliante).",AVNV2gDRF9b6yMZ5hcij8Q,0,0,4,Y81xZQdN9ZN5_AtTvsSi3A

It sucks that it's not all in his control but 2 hours for an appetizer and  2 1/2 hours waiting for a pizza is just crazy. It was a bad night for them for some reason and I'm really willing to give it another try. As for the pizza....on my cheat day....gotta be honest as the 5th Ninja turtle....I was underwhelmed! Maybe it was the 2 1/2 hr wait but I have had better. I worked out all week for this.....and this is it?????? ? Gotta get a redo. Should we come back....I will update this review after round 2.

My favorite unfiltered dame and I dined this afternoon for lunch. We ordered a small cheese pizza with garlic and artichoke without actually looking at the menu. The bartender confirmed that we wanted ""the classic"" to which we agreed assuming classic meant cheese pizza. Nearly forty five minutes later we received are beautifully prepared pizza with pepperoni & bell peppers in addition to the artichoke garlic request. Total buzz kill considering I don't eat meat and she doesn't eat pork. The bartender was pleasant and ended up making things right with our bill without hesitation and were grateful for the great customer service.

Thanks again Evan on that referral. We also had some garlic parm fries. Again yum I highly recommend! Our pies came with a side I got the Cesar salad and my boyfriend got the tomato basil soup again these did not fail in taste either. Lastly we shared the triple chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream( we never get dessert anywhere we go) it was mouth watering. 


I also want to give a huge shout out to our amazing over the top A+ + server Danny. This guy is phenomenal!!! Hands down the best server we have ever had. Super personable, up beat and flat out great. We will definitely be requesting his section anytime we go in!

So when my friend was like 'Giordano's is amazing! I love it... let's get pizza' I literally rolled my eyes.

After reviewing the menu... I settled on spinach thin crust. And literally praying it would be Papa Johns decent. Ummm... it is now the best pizza I've ever had! It was AMAZING. The crust was perfect and so was the pizza flavor. I had a bite of my friend's deep dish (about to cringe as I took a bite) and even that was great!

End of 1st quarter:  Pizza 1  Chicago Pizza 1

I love the massive amount of cheese.  If you don't like cheese, NOT for you, Glen Coco.

Too much cheeeeeeese, not enough toppings - definitely possible.

End of Half time:   Pizza 3  Chicago Pizza 2

The crust is nice, reminds me of pot pie crust, definitely the MAIN difference between normal pizzas and Chicago deep dish.   Basically pot pie loaded pizza.

Love the ambiance and the wood ambiance.  Was just in Raleigh N. Carolina and wood just makes restaurants cozy and feels at home.  

Final Score:  Pizza: 5   Chicago Pizza 4.  There's just too much competition out there for pizza.   While Chicago pizza is definitely unique with the awesome pie crust and massive amounts of lovely bubbly cheese, I don't mind settling for a little less cheese, more variety toppings, at other high end restaurant pizza places.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,1,1,4,UspRaCYE7dA9f4YNGGIdJQ

The restaurant was fairly empty at this hour (another bonus). Our server's name was (Ryan?), and he was awesome. Very friendly, attentive, and professional.

The waiter came over after 10 minutes and we ordered 2 beers. I ordered a Stella and the beer was rancid. Not possible to drink it. I asked the bartender to taste it and he agreed but did not know why it was bad. So I ended up with water.

The waiter came to take our order and informed us it would take an hour to make the pizza. Okay-- fine, we ordered a Greek Salad. The salad took about 15 minutes and it had zero flavor. The feta cheese tasted like garbage, it did not have the salty flavor. I am pretty sure it was bad. 

So now we have been waiting about 45 minutes and are starving and have not been offered any more beer or water. I waved the waiter over and asked how much longer for the pizza. He went to check and said at least 20 more minutes. WHAT??? He suggested we order another app if we were hungry. Sounds like a scam to get people to order more food.

So we ordered the calamari. The waiter said it was the most popular app. What a mistake. Flavorless and tasted like rubber. It was disgusting and we could not eat it. So the waiter came and took it away.

We were considering leaving about 10 minutes later when they finally brought out the pizza. So we each get a piece and inside the dough was raw. You can see it in my picture. Not edible. I called the waiter over again and he went to the back to find out why the pizza was not cooked after an hour and a half wait. 

When he returned he told us it was soggy looking because of all the vegetables we had in the pizza. He said they steamed inside and caused the dough to be soggy. 

First of all the dough was RAW not soggy. Secondly the only veggie we had in the pizza was olives. Are you frickin kidding me. You didn't notice that before you came out and gave me that lame excuse?

The manager took the pizza off my bill but in reality he should have comped the whole check. This place is disgusting and they have no idea what they are doing. Waiting an hour and a half for a raw pizza is insane and people will not put up with that. There are plenty of pizza places to go to in the area.

He made a good suggestion to order the deep dish first and then decide on apps and salad afterward. We decided to have the Chicago Classic deep dish. It took exactly 46 minutes from the waiter putting in the order to getting our small deep dish. Unfortunately the system for the orders went down while we were waiting for our salad and garlic fries. So it took us 30 minutes to get our starters. We also had order an entree size Cesar salad (which was delicious) but we got two individual size salads instead because the waiter couldn't remember what size we ordered - but his customer service was excellent during the time that the system wasn't working. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing. Not too much and it was thick like the dressing should be. The garlic fries were rich with Parmesan, but the garlic flavor left something to be desired. I also would have liked the fries to be a little more done. The pizza was yummy. However, you definitely need to like cheese. My husband, my mother and I split the small and it was plenty of pizza. The sauce was rich and the veggies were delicious - very tasty. The environment is loud so if you are coming here be prepared for that. We read some reviews about the noise, so we were prepared. We really enjoyed the experience except for one thing - the cannolis. They were the worst cannolis that I have ever had in my life. The ""cream"" was lumpy the shells were either burnt or too soft and the flavor was bland - and I mean really really bland. The ratio of ricotta to sugar was WAY off. We told the waiter and he immediately went back and tasted the cream. He said he agreed and would have the chefs fix the cream right away. So good job on fixing it and listening to the customer. I think we will definitely come back. Just beware that the menu is pricy.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,1,4,iKR11z6x42twncfFTH_j4w

Our server didn't bother to tell us that apparently our pizza was burnt and had to be remade until an hour passed by and we decided to leave. We were graciously comped two free sodas and our appetizer we had received 45 minutes prior for our time wasted. Terrible service, not going back again.",kHKK7IiFwiHgS8xEhN3EVA,0,0,1,KQWFdNyBzRzlnQ24YpeaUw

My sister, brother-in-law and I made our first visit to Giordano's Summerlin location. Just walking through the entrance and smelling the familiar scent of deep dish pizza brought smiles to our faces. We were immediately greeted by the friendly staff behind the front counter. You can tell that the staff at this new restaurant have been trained by the best. That initial acknowledgement and friendly tone set the mood for the rest of our time in the dining room. Tawny took our drink order and periodically checked in with us to see if we needed anything. Our waiter, Menz, was top of the line. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, even thought this location has only been open for a few weeks, checked in with us throughout our meal to see if we needed anything, and kept a smile on his face throughout our time there. The food was amazing. We started with the Giordano's Sampler which consisted of boneless wings with bbq sauce and wing sauce on the side, cheesy garlic bread, fried mozzarella triangles and loaded potato fritters (OMG, those fritters are GOOD), with marinara sauce and one of the best ranch dressings I've ever eaten. We ordered a deep dish sausage pizza, which takes about 45 minutes to bake, but is so worth the wait & the sampler platter kept us occupied until the pizza came out. The GM, Evan, stopped by our table to see how we were doing, as did the Regional Manager, Vicky. You can tell that both of these managers are professionals who love what they do and their positive attitude seems to be shared by everyone else who works there. We will be back to try a few more items on the menu -- even though it will be hard to walk in there and NOT get the deep dish.",E95rnaSlscaxghXM62afpg,0,0,5,lvvVPyQjtuUTNwg_8P-M_g

We opted for the thin crust pizza and a deep dish. Both were great and filling. Always leftover pizza. Which is great the next day",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,5,Jh0Z4TaPcbX69ALQCjcC4Q

Thanks Ana, it was the thin crust",XxRQezAyxsOa1Pgc4wpkUw,0,0,1,n_L91fH2rFunyJH83_TB9A
