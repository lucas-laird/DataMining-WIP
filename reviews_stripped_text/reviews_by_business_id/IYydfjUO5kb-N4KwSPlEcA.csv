I always order from them, however today when i walked in after making a phone order- I was totally ignored, and Randy let my food sit for 20min. After he served everyone else before me, even though I was first in line- I asked him ""was that my food"", he stated "" Yes, but your always on your phone when you come in and i think thats Fucking rude"". I was in shock because rather Im on my phone or not, I give them business. He then ""snatches"" my card out my hand and swipe it after i told him I DO NOT WANT THE FOOD. HE IS VERY RUDE AND A RACIST. HES A REAL LIVE RACIST BUT pretends to be otherwise. I will never go there- and I highly recommend people not to go as well. Very rude guy named Randy. If he treats customers like that-  I feel sorry for what they may do to people food if their on there phone in the cafe (since he hates when you talk on your phone). NEVER EAT HERE. NEVER!!!

We were all blown away by the yumminess and affordability of the food (each of our entrees were well under $10)!

If you have ever starved from physically working long hours and had something wrong with your order, I'm sure you can relate to this feeling. 
This round i decided to choose something a little more on the healthy side so i got the Asian Chicken Salad. Now let me advise you that i had read the ingredients to the salad, including lettuce tomatoes chicken peanuts and some. Longg story short, my salad came out looking good but only one problem.. my lettuce was substituted for shredded cabbage! They tried explaining to me that it was part of the salad but as i showed them in the menu, cabbage was not even listed. I dont know about you, but for sure i can tell the difference between cabbage and lettuce. 
Of course I should give them a chance to reveal themselves so I changed my order to an Angus Steak Salad togo instead. I even stated ""With ranch, please"". We pay our bill and head back to work as i attempt to fork down my salad during the 5 minute drive. Turns out they forgot the ranch.. yes i was forced to eat a dry salad and not to mention with the bland sliced sirloin piece of what they call 'steak'.

My coworker also was not pleased with his Chicken Cordon Bleu. For $9 the sandwich was smaller than expected, came with a small cup of coleslaw and was missing avocado on the burger. 

Needless to say my expectations here have dramatically changed from 5 to 2.5 stars and dont plan on visiting again for awhile.",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,10,6,2,Vh941WRIzwHG0i5um2MZyA

It has this diner feel in a industrial warehouse feel because it seems to be in a industrial warehouse (haha). The service was great, our waiter was attentive and definitely made conversation with us. She was prompt with bringing us our waters, menus, and food so that was swell. 

However, the food wasn't that great. I ordered the philly cheesesteak with their homemade ranch potato chips. The chips were freshly made but lacked flavor. It just tasted like plain potato chips to me. The philly cheesesteak was bland for my taste. A cheesesteak from Capriotti's is way better in comparison to this place. If there was no other place to eat around that area, then I'd go here just cause I don't want to die of starvation but if I had a choice, I would not be going here. It's about $10 or so per item and if I'm going to pay that much, I'd like to enjoy what I'm eating.

Thought I gulped a little of the Atlantic ocean for a bit. The server graciously too it off and I reciprocated  with a larger tip. So if your in the mood for some diner style food before trekking to your raceway outing, I would recommend this place.",jEISjXCwz-nf86EZBvCCqQ,0,0,3,9EWKA2E8pdebQ68xiLZnhQ
5802206,2014-11-28,0,IYydfjUO5kb-N4KwSPlEcA,"Decent caf√© tucked out amongst the industrial buildings at the raceway. Service is good, selection is caf√© standard: burgers, sandwiches, breakfast in the morning. I wasn't blown away but it was solid. 

I got the chicken sandwich, which was exactly as it sounds but the highlight was it came with avocado. And by avocado they put half of an avocado on the sandwich...not sliced, just the big chunk. I thought that was pretty funny that I had to spread it around.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,2,0,3,ZVhPkPi7TtzTcAZDQcj2OA
