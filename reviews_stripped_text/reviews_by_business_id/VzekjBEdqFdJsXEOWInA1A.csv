91133,2012-04-29,0,VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A,"I have ordered albos 3 times while visiting Las Vegas. The food is affordable and tasty. That said the people on the phone don't seem to understand what people expect out of a cashier at a delivery place. The person seemed more interested in making me laugh than making sure my order was right and they could deliver it. This time my delivery driver was kicked out of my hotel and I had to come to the entrance to get my food. If I wanted to walk through my hotel I wouldn't have ordered delivery, I would have gotten food from the food court.

The previous time I ordered they had no problem getting into our room but we discovered on the receipt had my ENTIRE CREDIT CARD NUMBER, EXPIRATION DATE, CC2 CODE, AND ZIP WRITTEN ON THE RECEIPT. The driver kept a copy. This is completely unacceptable as it invites identity theft.

The person answering the phone also seems very distracted and set the phone down twice (for 5 min or so each time) to take an order from a customer in the store rather than taking the minute or two to finish our transaction or placing me on hold to deal with the in store customer.

In short fast, cheap, food with a very poor execution.",TF4-I9rnnvpjtWo85W_YhQ,1,1,2,eVz0UzV4MGXJfKPkUpjHLQ

5 stars is not enough.

I am at home recovering from surgery in a hospital bed and not able to get around very well on my own.

My room mate works odd hours right now and after finding Albo's they have been a life saver.

Thanks to Nick and the other driver that don't mind coming in and dropping my order off I get to eat a nice hot meal on those nights.

Food has always been delicious and so hot and fresh.

Love the hot chicken wings. They are flavorful but not real hot.

The double Philly cheese steak. So yummy!

Also love the Chicken Parasean with wide noodles and the sub is really good to.

They also have those great wide steak fries.

And you have to try the ranch dressing. Is so good on everything and it is handmade on site.

The only bad thing I have had from there was a chef salad and that was only because the lettuce was old and turning brown. The toppings were tasty and plentiful on it though.

I still have to try the pizza. Maybe tonight!

Always 2 to 4 Cheese Steaks because they are so good.

With the freshest bread daily and the quality of meat is outstanding with the right amount of cheese. (Boston pizza meat was too salty and didn't have the same presentation that Albo's given you and the bread sucked up all the cheese and just not as good as Albo's my ALL time favorite, I will never go anywhere but Albo's for them.

They are so good, I even put a pic on my Facebook cause their that good, staff is very friendly and we have dined in twice which is very charming atmosphere.

After writing the review below Eat24 contacted me by email to address the pricing issue. They had done the menu incorrectly and I was inadvertently overcharged for extra toppings. They sent me. $2 coupon. That really wasn't my issue. I just wanted the pizza I ordered. 

Around lunch time the day after the interaction described below, the same driver arrived unannounced with the pizza I had ordered the day before. He apologized and said he wanted to make it right. He also refunded the $6 I didn't even know I had been overcharged. 

It's not how you fall it's how you get up so I'm adding a couple stars to my previous review because of the impressive effort to correct the situation. 

***********


Ordered pizza online. Half pepperoni and half pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, and artichoke ... Each extra topping cost $2.00 and the bill shows I paid for all the toppings. Pizza arrived without the pineapple and artichoke. 

Driver arrived and I was with a customer. I acknowledged him and let him know I would be with him in a minute. Literally two minutes later he exited the office and started into the employee area ... Not cool. He let me know he was in a hurry. I get that. His total wait was less than 4 minutes ... But at least he got all the money ...

It was three of us (all males) starving after a long night of raging at EDC and we needed tons of food to recover. We ordered one or their family deals which was quite the bang for the buck. 

18"" cheese pizza w/ one topping, 20 wings two sauce flavors, 8 huge chicken fingers, and 2 liter coke to wash it down. 

All of this under $40. 

To top it off, the food was delicious. 
The place was empty when we showed up so we were greeted right away. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive at our table after we ordered. 

They were nice enough to add an extra layer of cheese on top of our pepperoni because it was our first time there. Kudos for that.

We stayed at a hotel 1.5 miles away (after looking at a map), but wound up being charged a ""$5 delivery fee"" made up on the spot by the people in the background when I placed our order. We didn't fight it as we'd been traveling all day long and were starving. 

We ordered a Chicken and Broccoli 14 inch pizza and a White Pizza of the same size and an order of cheeseless (it matters when you're ordering) Garlic Bread. Our total came to $39.40 (before tip). The delivery guy called me when he got to the hotel, but hung up on me when he saw my husband waiting. It was rude.

Anyways, the food itself was awful. The dough was okay, but the toppings sucked. The chicken on mine tasted like it came out of a can or bag--definitely NOT grilled as they indicated on their menu. The broccoli was frozen, not like I expected anything exceptionally fresh, but c'mon.. My husband's pizza wasn't good either and he barely ate two slices before dumping it. The garlic bread was a joke and not worth what they charged for it.

We wandered around until we got hungry, then stopped into Albo for a pizza.  I asked the charming Bulgarian woman at the cash register if they could make a pizza very, VERY thin -- ""New York style.""  She said their pizza wasn't that thin, but they would try.

10 minutes later, a guy proudly brought the pizza to the table and said ""this is the thinnest pizza we have ever made.""  And, to paraphrase the Talking Heads, ""it was.""

The pizza's crust was nearly paper thin, the sauce was tasty but not over-seasoned, the cheese was fresh and the sausage was moist and flavorfulywithout being greasy.

My wife and I are happily married, in large part because we have the same taste:  in home decor, in comedy...in PIZZA.  My wife lived 10 years in NYC and, the morning after our Albo experience, she expressed her confusion over the fact that she thinks the pizza we had by accident in a crummy part of Vegas was one of the 3 best pizzas she's ever eaten.

The pizza at Albo's is really good! Very cheesy. They do not skimp on the mozzerella that's for sure.

One night, I picked up a pizza from my old stand-by, Napoli, on Decatur, and one from Albo's....to see which one was better.

Albo's was better, by an angel-hair. Frankly, I think that Napoli was having a bad night; probably breaking in a new chef.

Albo's has pick-up specials: 18 inch, and 14 inch. They should have a 16 inch special, but for some reason they don't. 
(Guys; piece of advice: put a 16 inch pick-up special on your menu....immediately!!!)

Here's the cosmic amusement of it all: Napoli is run by Russians.
And so is Albo's.

4489977,2011-06-12,0,VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A,"Tried this place based on the positive reviews. . .  I visit Vegas about five times a year. It is just north of the Stratosphere in a pretty seedy area. Inside, we entered and were the only ones in the place which we thought was a bad sign. As far as atmosphere goes it is pretty basic -- ugly red paint and bleak. There is a single TV and a small very basic bar.

I had a pizza and wife had pasta -- the pizza was really good. I almost finished a 10 inch by myself. The crust was perfect and the toppings were fresh and yummy. The pasta was just okay. . .  the pizza was definitely a winner and I would get it for takeout in the future.

The price was super. . .  about 22 bucks total. They serve no alcohol at all so no cold draft beer to go with your pizza. I mean, the place was a hole but the pizza was really good and the price was right. I think most of the previous posts are just plants by the owner.

Bottom line - a hole but solid cheap pizza.",n4631GPvn0-k6yp-X1T6HQ,1,0,2,rYvi3G9EJ_1KiATS0XoGXg

Amazing if you are super hungry and don't want to think about what to get. Also their lunch specials for around $7 are great... yummy chicken fingers!!!!!!!!!!! Sometimes when they deliver they get stuff wrong... i.e.toppings or extras... but since I live so close I just walk over there and check my stuff before I leave.  It's also nice to sit in the air conditioning watching the tv for a bit anyways. They are nice people, and if they do screw up on a delivery, they will come back and make it right.

5000106,2016-04-30,2,VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A,"I got a bucket of Medium Chicken Fingers, and an order of Cheese Fries, sauce on the side, to go. It was a little overkill for just three people but I hadn't found a place that makes good old fashioned Chicken Fingers since Back East Pizza changed owners, about 20 years ago. LOL  Regardless, we each had about four fingers and some fries to hold over for snacks, and that is kind of a highlight in my book.
 They fry the fingers in a good batter til crunchy, then toss them with Mild, Medium, or Hot Sauce. I had to add my own celery sticks, so I took a star off. Honestly, what is this world coming to?
 The fries were crispy and the cheese sauce was average, not bad, just cheese sauce, you know?
 I'm not sure that I would be too comfortable eating here alone due to the area, and it's a little dark, not anything that would trouble me if I was with people but I would feel nervous at night alone. I'm getting chicken in my old age so don't let it stop you if you're young and full of invincibleness. 
 The rest of the menu looks good, and the service was very friendly. I wasn't offered the free bottle of soda it said I could get with me meal, but when I asked she said ""Of course! Help yourself."" Seems like a place you could get to know the staff and then hang out there a lot, eating and chilling.
 Parking is a little bit of an issue but there are signs pointing to where there was extra. They don't deliver to my address so I probably won't be ordering pizza unless I have a gathering, then I could hide the fingers until everyone left. I'm sneaky like that.
 Next time I'll try the Eclair for dessert and update the review.
 Now, to arm wrestle the Little Woman over whether we go here or that Barbque place that she and her brother love. (Or swing by here on the way to there and hide me some fingers for tomorrow. Shhhhh)",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,3,3,4,pFHmvyujCxI-5HuK3kNbNA

We ordered a large Albo Special:
pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, onions, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers 

Pizza was good, and plenty cheesy which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that does not skimp on the cheese! That is something that drives me nuts when you have to add cheese as an extra topping just to get a decent amount, not here!

Pizza is good and the friendly personal service is even better :)

Albo came up as an option to order delivery right through the Yelp app, so of course I was all about it. I scrolled through photos and reviews to decide on the Mr. Food Pizza and a Pepperoni & Pineapple Calzone. The calzone was a last minute addition in order to reach the order minimum of $12. *cough, cough * Okay, if I'm being honest, I met the order minimum with the pizza, but I really wanted to try one of their calzones.

The order process was simple since I have my card information linked to my account. If you don't already do this to take advantage of easy ordering and the Yelp CashBack program, stop reading right now, set it up, and come back to this review when you're done.

Our order came pretty quickly, I'd say about an hour, which is really great for online food delivery, and our delivery guy was really friendly. I would love anyone who showed up to my front door with pizza, but he was really nice. I opened the boxes to discover my Mr. Food Pizza was lukewarm, but they did take note of my request to only put onions on half. The pizza is covered in their marinara sauce and melted mozzarella, and also holds pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, and garlic. Overall it was okay, similar to a supreme pizza, but the crust was lacking flavor and was quite chewy.

The calzone was equally disappointing. The outer crust was burnt on the edges and what wasn't burnt was also chewy.  When I cut into it, it was super greasy. The amount of pepperoni and pineapple was quite small compared to the amount of cheese. It was stuffed, which is awesome, but the lack of toppings made it feel more like I was enjoying a very large serving of fried mozzarella. The marinara on the side was also pretty bland, so it really didn't add much to the experience.

I might order them again, but only after I give a few other pizza deliveries a try.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,12,3,BkZcWbD4vAzIQdSoKRCg-A
